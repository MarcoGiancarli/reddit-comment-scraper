dbz,3e0phw,NemesisPrimev2,7,Tue Jul 21 03:43:58 2015 UTC,As much sense as people that can blow up planets with punches and 7 orbs that grand wishes.

dbz,3e0yjl,Dunkcity239,4,Tue Jul 21 12:56:25 2015 UTC,Basically Team Rocket financed Mewtwo's creation and when Giovanni found out he knew he made a terrible mistake making a pokemon that was unrivaled so he went to Silph Co. to get the Master Ball which was the only ball capable of capturing Mewtwo and atone for his sin but you as the player stop him which makes you the bad guy.
dbz,3e0yjl,NemesisPrimev2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:13:06 2015 UTC,Yeah after I read your comment I googled it. Pretty interesting stuff
dbz,3e0yjl,Dunkcity239,13,Tue Jul 21 15:22:47 2015 UTC,this and the fact that a good chunk of the z fighters are only alive cause goku spared them so he could fight them again later
dbz,3e0yjl,mrtangelo,3,Tue Jul 21 04:44:21 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure all of them minus krillin  goku spared to fight again later, and never kind of does because we'll fucking goku"
dbz,3e0yjl,whiterungaurd,8,Tue Jul 21 05:11:19 2015 UTC,"I think Vegeta might actually be the first. Let's see. Yamcha doesn't get KOed but retreats, and then they join forces. Goku kills or thinks he kills a bunch of Red Ribbon dudes. Tien wins his tournament bout against Goku. Goku kills King Piccolo. When he beats Piccolo Jr he does say he wants a rival, but he also needs to let Piccolo live because Kami."
dbz,3e0yjl,SJHalflingRanger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:11:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but they're buddies by then, he's not going to kill him."
dbz,3e0yjl,SJHalflingRanger,5,Tue Jul 21 13:43:56 2015 UTC,"Yamcha was beating Goku up before he saw Bulma, and Tien pretty much tied with Goku. Master Roshi was Goku's master, Oolang just tagged along, and Bulma was the one who dragged Goku into everything, if we count them, etc.    It's true that almost all of his friends were once enemies of some sort, but iirc only Piccolo and Vegeta were ""spared so he could fight them again"""
dbz,3e0yjl,Etonet,4,Tue Jul 21 14:39:04 2015 UTC,So what you're saying is... Bulma is the real hero?
dbz,3e0yjl,Nikolai_Roze,6,Tue Jul 21 07:43:27 2015 UTC,"Well she is the catalyst for everything starting, presumably if it wasn't for her, Goku would have still been living in Grandpa Gohan's shack punching fish to death for dinner for the rest of his life (if Goku never attacked the Red Ribbon Army, the androids would have never been created to kill him, Majin Buu wouldn't have been released, so really there wouldn't have been a huge threat to humanity unless Frieza decided he wanted to take over the Earth or something. Although this actually makes for an interesting what-if scenario, if Goku never met any other humans, who's to say that he wouldn't just side with Radditz when he shows up to Earth."

dbz,3e0yjl,AgentPaint,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:44:25 2015 UTC,wouldnt the red ribbon army eventually take over the earth?
dbz,3e0yjl,burnXgazel,3,Tue Jul 21 13:07:26 2015 UTC,"perhaps, that wouldn't really affect Goku though as he lived in seclusion. I would think that the RR army would care about taking over cities, and gathering the Dragon Balls, not bothering a kid who lives in a shack in the middle of nowhere."
dbz,3e0yjl,applepwnz,4,Tue Jul 21 14:34:41 2015 UTC,Goku had the 4 star ball in his possesion. Eventually Pilaf would have came poking around.
dbz,3e0yjl,Venkerman,2,Tue Jul 21 14:42:48 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, so I guess conflict WOULD find Goku eventually, the question is, how well Pilaf could steal the Dragon Ball from Goku, if he played it smart and like snuck in and took it while Goku was sleeping, then Goku would never find him because he wouldn't have a Dragon Radar, so that'd be that. Given that Pilaf isn't exactly the best tactician, he'd probably underestimate Goku and try to take it by force from him instead, so it's kindof an unknown whether he would succeed, if he was able to use one of his robots or something to incapacitate Goku long enough to get out of Goku's visual range, he would be free and clear, and presumably Goku would cut his losses and just go back to his simple life in the woods."
dbz,3e0yjl,applepwnz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:15:35 2015 UTC,i think Frieza's the real catalyst to everything actually
dbz,3e0yjl,Etonet,2,Tue Jul 21 15:41:55 2015 UTC,Piccolo is the first time Goku spares someone evil (Tien had come around by the time their battle ended). He let Piccolo live in order to keep Kami and the Dragonballs alive.
dbz,3e0yjl,Lord_of_Bored212,6,Tue Jul 21 17:50:09 2015 UTC,im sure he spars with them all the time.
dbz,3e0yjl,mrtangelo,3,Tue Jul 21 12:51:23 2015 UTC,"Yea but, honestly I don't think goku takes any of that seriously at this point, to him it's the equivalent of a toddler and an adult rough housing for fun but the adult knows full and well there is nothing this kid can do to hurt me"
dbz,3e0yjl,whiterungaurd,0,Tue Jul 21 05:14:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, like training for the Androids, Piccolo and Gohan could never begin to touch Goku if he went SSJ"

dbz,3e0yjl,Max_Insanity,19,Tue Jul 21 14:14:22 2015 UTC,The reason shit keeps happening is because dangerous forces keep seeking him out. He doesn't cause problems for the universe; problems come looking for him.  He's never done anything outright malicious before. He's commonly said to have a pure heart. One of his besties is the goddamn god of the North Galaxy. He's only terrifying if you're looking to start shit on his turf.
dbz,3e0yjl,porcubot,2,Tue Jul 21 14:15:05 2015 UTC,"Except he let Frieza get to 100% full power to prove a point, he let Vegeta escape so he could have a fight against him again in the future, he goofed around with Cell who could have easily destroyed the planet in their fight and almost let his son get beaten to death rather than give him some real advice on how to win, he let his ego and need for a good fight allow Majin Buu to get released and he challenges the God of Destruction to a fight (which according to Old Kaioshin could have destroyed galaxies).  Also King Kai gives Goku shit regularly for being selfish and only caring about fighting."
dbz,3e0yjl,Commando_Joe,11,Tue Jul 21 05:50:02 2015 UTC,"LOL you really hate goku, you are always talking bad of him"

He's better than Superman because he's a short sighted fighting maniac that regularly fucks up everything.  I like him for that and it blows my mind that everyone paints him as this paragon of good that always tries to do the best thing for everyone (like Superman, who's boring and sucks)"
dbz,3e0yjl,Commando_Joe,2,Tue Jul 21 12:37:56 2015 UTC,"Superman's really not that boring, I always thought the fact that superman is s God among men but yet a man (lex Luthor) is his arch enemy. The interesting dynamic about superman is that he had all the power and has to figure out what to do with it while the interesting about goku is his will to achieve power or become the best fighter (however you want to word it)"

dbz,3e0yjl,Unclehouse2,3,Tue Jul 21 18:51:22 2015 UTC,actually majin buu being released can for sure fall on goku's shoulders because every hit he took from majin vegeta gave power to hatching majin buu. If he wanted to avoid that he should have went ssj3 one shot vegeta and be done with it.
dbz,3e0yjl,infestedjoker,9,Tue Jul 21 19:12:57 2015 UTC,"Except Goku was relying on Gohan to destroy Buu's egg, and Vegeta gave into Babidi to have enough strength, or so he thought, to combat Goku."

Goku just gets destructive when he gets overly excited for battle. He wouldn't hurt a fly other wise.   All the battle lust and prowess of his father and all the kindness of his mother. Opposite of his brother with all the blood lust of the father and all the weakness of the mother.

Supes is reliant on the sun and has a stupid weakness. Goku's only weakness is that he would fight Superman fairly and not take advantage of him. He has the power to do so. Vegeta on the other hand would finish the job if Goku's stupidity got the best of him.  Basically it would be the plot of Spoiler!"

It arrived with the background attached to it...it seems they actually paint-bonded the black background to the cel itself, which is why it looks like there are two different blacks.  Still, I'm very happy with it."

dbz,3dysly,JustVan,5,Mon Jul 20 19:16:57 2015 UTC,That looks fantastic! I assume that's an original cel from the series? Where did you get it?
dbz,3dysly,JustVan,7,Mon Jul 20 18:31:27 2015 UTC,"Is indeed an original, from episode 90 (uncut), purchased from eBay, then took it to a friend for the framing, he did a fantastic job with it!  If people know other sources for buying cels please let me know, I'd like to get a contrasting Goku."
dbz,3dysly,fingermebooty,3,Mon Jul 20 18:34:32 2015 UTC,"I get most of my cels from YahooJapan (search セル画 ドラゴンボール but be aware 99.9% of Japanese sellers don't ship internationally and you'll need to use a middleman service) and Mandarake auctions or Mandarake website. Auctions has better stuff but it goes for more whereas the website ones you can just buy directly at a fixed price.  eBay has stuff too of course (usually overpriced), and sometimes good stuff pops up on Rubberslug from collectors thinning out their collections. I've got a great Goku one I've been trying to sell for a while."
dbz,3dysly,SXA89,5,Tue Jul 21 05:50:47 2015 UTC,"Always be very careful with framing cels. They were not made to last (just to be around long enough to film). The black lines will fade in sunlight if you haven't used UV glass, and if not treated the back of the cel will stick to the glass if it's not floated. You may not care, but I always have to warn people about it. I have a decent cel collection but don't have any of my cels framed because I don't want to damage them. Framed cels look amazing, but for me it's not worth the risk. Just make sure you keep this in a dark room, ideally one that is climate controlled most/all of the time. I keep mine in a closet in my bedroom in cel books."

dbz,3dysly,whiterungaurd,3,Mon Jul 20 19:28:42 2015 UTC,What is a cel and where can I get one?
dbz,3dysly,JustVan,3,Tue Jul 21 01:11:33 2015 UTC,"A cel is basically a drawing on a transparent sheet used to mostly draw animation, and eBay is a good place for these, but can be quite expensive."
dbz,3dysly,SXA89,3,Tue Jul 21 01:34:45 2015 UTC,What is a cel  and why is everyone buying them? Why can't I just make it is there something special I don't know here?
dbz,3dysly,Panda_In_The_Box,2,Tue Jul 21 05:42:48 2015 UTC,Cels are the original animation paintings that were filmed to make the original show. Every second of footage you watch in Dragonball Z was originally drawn and painted on acetate paper and filmed in front of water color backgrounds. They are individual paintings roughly the size of a piece of paper. No two are alike because each was drawn for a unique scene. You could recreate a painting but it wouldn't be the original that was used to film the show. When you have a cel you are holding an actual piece of the footage from the anime. When your cel appears on screen you are looking at the same piece of artwork. Your cel is there on your TV. It can be pretty awesome to own key sequences.  They're not fanart or whatever. They're original production art. I've been collecting on and off since 1999 so let me know if you have any questions.

But he could, no problem. If Goku as a child handled the wave from a 1st try there's no reason for a Super Namek not to. It's just that it's the signature move of the Kamesen'nin school, only Roshi's students did it, and enemies that either had acces to genetics of one of them or proved a point to Goku"

It has a couple boring arcs but I'd generally say it's good.   Also, Arc-V (the newest anime) is shaping up to be the best one imo. Very few plot fillers and back to back action for like 60 episodes."

dbz,3e1r6a,Justarseddit,3,Tue Jul 21 08:01:09 2015 UTC,"He seems to me he's like a Father Time.  He can move through the universe at amazing speed and really is a neutral force.  He mentors Beerus to keep him in check and make sure his destruction is within the means of space and time.  That is Whis makes sure Beerus doesn't upset the balance between good and evil.  From Dragonball Super, it seems Whis has been aware of Goku all along letting Beerus figure it out for himself.  I'm sure if the Kais were more powerful than Beerus, Whis would be making sure Supreme Kai and the others were kept in check.  Then again, Whis probably knows about Goku the whole time and is barely helping Beerus at all.  Whis wants to let Beerus find Goku without helping much because he knows that will naturally push Goku to Super Saiyan God and would bring balance back to the universe."

What do you know of meaningless? spend most of your life ruled by another, watch your race dwindle to a hand full, and then tell me what has more meaning than your own strength""(in respond to getting questioned about his motives)"

He never speaks well or thinks of his father and considers him weak, having surpassed him since childhood.  He also expressed no interest in repopulating the Saiyan race, or wishing his homeworld back.   Vegeta: Everything else aside, Kakarrot's son's battle power... ...was unusually high, compared to Saiyan children. Nappa: It could have been some kind of mistake, couldn't it? Vegeta: No, there's no mistake. Raditz did actually take a great deal of damage from that kid's strike. Apparently, when our blood is mixed with an Earthling's, it results in a hybrid with mighty power. Nappa: Hmph, a Super Saiyan, you mean? I get it. If we were to produce those guys one after another, then once again, Saiyan rule will no longer be a dream. Vegeta: You've got to be kidding. Just watch those guys grow and gain even greater power for themselves. Then it will be our positions that are in danger. Nappa: That would be true. Vegeta: In any case, we will exterminate everyone on Earth. Three days should be enough for that. Until then, let's have ourselves a good, long sleep for the first time in a while."

It looks like Goku's never used ki before, but he sees how roshi uses it, and somehow is able to control his ki immediately. The way goku moves his hands, its as if he's playing around, seeing how the ki he just saw used work.   Makes me think of some headcanon where Saiyans can actually see ki, outside and inside people, so where roshi takes 50 years to develop the attack, Goku see's how roshi controlled the ki, and just mimicked."
dbz,3dz8x2,yoisthatme,3,Mon Jul 20 22:02:16 2015 UTC,I don't think it has much to do with being a Saiyan.  The fact is that Goku is a fighting prodigy. Even among the highest tier saiyans he is the best.

Super Gotenks 3  異次元からの脱出！！超ゴテンクス３  That episode was the one where Gotenks first transforms into a Super Saiya-jin 3, and Gotenks pulls that position right after Piccolo struck him over the head for playing games by trying to be secretive about his Ssj3 transformation.  You see him rubbing his head, and then just as his arm is swinging down, that's when it shows the pose from that cel.  Now, I can't speak for the authenticity of the actual cel, but that episode is where that Gotenks pose comes from."

The part of the cel where Gotenks is doing this happens within the 13:50 mark. It only happens with a frame of that second. If you do pause at the right time, you see his hand already in the fist position. But with the right timing at the right pause, you can eventually get the right position.   I took the time and got every single frame that happens within those very few seconds. An Imgur album can be found here /u/Damone75"

First: You all are a wonderful community. Thanks for all your help and great discussions over the last year. Seriously this is one of my favorite subs.  About the show!  KHH is a two person show featuring the fight (read: Vegeta's brutal defeat) between Freeza and Vegeta. The idea started as a joke about a year and a half ago while watching DBZ Kai with my partner (The director). Now it's an official play opening in less than two weeks.   This thing is absolutely ridiculous but possibly the coolest thing I've ever done.   I'd love to answer any (well most) questions if you have em.

dbz,3e1k7h,Skorpii,4,Tue Jul 21 06:30:42 2015 UTC,"Discussion of GT doesn't crop up very often since it wasn't well-received by many fans. As for what GT is, our FAQ in the sidebar answers that:   Q: What is Dragon Ball GT? Should I watch it?  A: Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z are based on the comic book (manga) Dragon Ball by Akira Toriyama. When the manga ended, Toei Animation, the company behind the production of the anime, decided to make their own sequel to Dragon Ball Z, entitled Dragon Ball GT (Grand Touring). While it's not by the original author, or part of the main storyline's continuity, it's a part of Dragon Ball's history, and is certainly worth a watch.   While there is no officially defined ""canon"", in terms of main continuity, you would start with Dragon Ball and move on to Dragon Ball Z. Once finished, you would read Jaco the Galactic Patrolman and start watching Dragon Ball Super. Optionally, you can preface Super with the JSAT special, Battle of Gods, and Resurrection 'F', but since Super is adapting these movies into story arcs, watching them isn't mandatory.  Dragon Ball GT and the rest of the movies/specials are completely separate from the main storyline. If you like, you can watch absolutely everything in the order it all came out using this list."
dbz,3e1k7h,EmmaWinters,3,Tue Jul 21 06:35:32 2015 UTC,Why is everyone recommending reading Jaco? Is he actually necessary to know about just because he might be in super?
dbz,3e1k7h,Venkerman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:17:57 2015 UTC,"Not completely necessary, but his story ""counts"", and was authored by Toriyama himself."
dbz,3e073c,CcaseyC,10,Mon Jul 20 23:11:09 2015 UTC,"Kanzenshuu has a wonderful section on the animation process which details what cels are and their role in older animation.  Basically, they're the final drawing that was filmed. People collect them because they're literally pieces from the anime."
dbz,3e073c,EmmaWinters,12,Mon Jul 20 23:16:12 2015 UTC,"Cels are transparent sheets that characters/objects are drawn on/painted on. They are used for hand-drawn animations. Computer technology has made production cels basically useless. That is why animation studios do not use cels anymore, because computers and tablets are a lot easier to work with.  When the characters are drawn on the cels, they are drawn on a static background typically. This helps reduce the times a certain image has to be drawn on. You can see throughout animations if you pause frame-by-frame that the background typically does not change.  To answer your second question, people collect them because they're very collectible. You'll typically see more collectors collect more of the older stuff, like Warner Bros. or Hanna-Barbera. Disney is also very collectible, especially old Mickey stuff. Very rarely you will come across cels that were only meant to be made for someone, or sometimes meant as a way of showing off work. But really though, most people collect them because they're apart of an animation. They have sentimental meaning to them. Someone literally drew that and painted it by hand. Now you see it come to life in a film/cartoon."

dbz,3dzcqj,rizefall,11,Mon Jul 20 19:30:31 2015 UTC,"Probably not. According to Saikyō Jump's June 2014 interview (which is probably what you're referencing):   Goku endlessly keeps getting stronger, with Super Saiyan 3 in the manga and Super Saiyan 4 in the anime; does Super Saiyan keep getting limitlessly stronger too? Might we eventually see things such as a Super Saiyan 5…?! Super Saiyan 2 and 3 are nothing more than powered-up variations of Super Saiyan. After the fight with Beerus, Goku realized that mastering his normal state and Super Saiyan would raise his level more and sap less strength, so I think he probably won’t become Super Saiyan 2 or 3 any more.   Super Saiyan 1 differs from the other two forms; I believe Goku describes it as efficient. The other forms are good for quick power-ups, but it seems that they burn off too much energy to be practical for extended periods of training."
dbz,3dzcqj,EmmaWinters,3,Mon Jul 20 19:35:38 2015 UTC,"Probably not as in, he wont, or that he CAN'T"
dbz,3dzcqj,EmmaWinters,8,Mon Jul 20 20:31:54 2015 UTC,"I imagine that if Goku thought training himself with SS2/SS3 would be beneficial, he would do so. It seems that he can't master the others like he did with Full Power Super Saiyan 1."
dbz,3dzcqj,mlerb,5,Mon Jul 20 20:34:06 2015 UTC,"Does that not go against what occurred previously in the series? Gohan didn't seem to have any problem staying ss2 while he fought Cell, and he would have never had a chance without it. Goku and Vegeta fought for an extended period of time at ss2, and neither could have won without it."
dbz,3dzcqj,EmmaWinters,3,Tue Jul 21 17:47:51 2015 UTC,"Super Saiyan 1 was masterable; you could sleep in it if you trained your body properly. SS2 is probably too ""heavy"", even though you can use it for extended periods. SS3, as explained in the series, is so inefficient that you can't keep it very long before you're drained."
dbz,3dzcqj,JonWood007,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:58:25 2015 UTC,"Oh definitely. Look at Goku and Gohan training for the cell games and in the hyperbolic time chamber. They would intentionally LIVE in SSJ form so they could better handle such a state.It arguably is what makes higher states of SSJ possible to achieve. In the cell saga, vegeta and trunks tried to bulk up their forms into the ascended saiyan varieties, only to lose to cell due to a loss of speed. Only by mastering the SSJ state and making it easier to handle did Gohan reach SSJ2.  SSJ3...who knows. That form is highly unstable, but perhaps goku could train himself to handle it better too. Goku himself admitted in the buu saga to not having much experience with it. It would be interesting to see if he could handle it better in Super, Spoiler!"
dbz,3dzcqj,AzoGalvat,3,Tue Jul 21 00:58:20 2015 UTC,"I imagine he could. Perhaps if he sat around as SSJ3 like he did with SSJ after the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, his body might acclimate to the strain and make the transformation easier.  However, I imagine that SSJ3 eats significantly more energy than SSJ, so doing that all day every day would exhaust him rapidly and just isn't worth the trouble to do."

dbz,3dzcqj,EagleLiteHawk,2,Tue Jul 21 04:29:18 2015 UTC,"Another thing to point out is that the higher level transformations burn energy quickly. Not only that, but the transformations greatly cloud the user's judgement. This can be seen easily when Sean is voicing Goku and has a new voice for each form. When Goku goes SSJ3 against Beerus, he get extremely cocky and believes he can defeat Beerus easily because of the power going to his head. This is also seen back when Gohan goes SSJ2 and becomes cocky as well and wants to make Cell suffer rather than just ending the fight."
dbz,3dzcqj,xXsavagewulfXx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:49:40 2015 UTC,"I think the Super Saiyan 2 form is their normal transformed state by now. They seem to immediately go Super Saiyan 2 like they used to with Super Saiyan 1 (Goku vs Majin Vegeta, then Vegeta vs Beerus in BOG). Super Saiyan 3 seems to be the only flawed power up, its alot more brutish than the others."
dbz,3dzcqj,EagleLiteHawk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:18:45 2015 UTC,"You're right that both Goku and Vegeta are SSJ2 during their fight but it has become very hard to tell. Vegeta's only difference is the electricity while Goku's hair changes slightly. But in BOG Vegeta and Goku both only fight Beerus in SSJ form and not SSJ2. (Aside from the SSJ3 fight on King Kai's planet) Vegeta or Goku have no electricity during their fights and Piccolo even states the Goku dropped from his god form to ""a mere Super Saiyan."""

dbz,3e0893,Paterfix,6,Mon Jul 20 23:20:26 2015 UTC,"I think it makes sense. Kaioshin are creator gods, with their emphasis being on the ability to create new planets and life. It makes sense that their abilities would be more magical and less battle oriented.  On the flip side of the scale Beerus (asaik) has no magic oriented abilities (with the possible exception of prophetic dreams) and is forced to rely entirely on his battle abilities.  From a literary perspective I think they work pretty well as mirror images of each other."
dbz,3e0893,Cronos000,2,Mon Jul 20 23:29:36 2015 UTC,"Seeing as how Beerus was the one to seal Elder Kai away in the Z Sword, I wouldn't doubt that he has powerful magical abilities, but chooses to use fighting techniques and abilities because of his role in the universe.    Who was it that sealed the Elder Kaiōshin away in the Z Sword? The Kaiōshin (who create planets) and the Gods of Destruction (who destroy them) have never gotten along that well, but once every 1,000 years they go to each other’s realms and hold a coordination meeting. At this time, they got into an argument over some trifling thing, and a certain short-tempered God of Destruction sealed Elder Kaiōshin away inside a sword. Naturally, it wouldn’t have been proper for him to destroy the Kaiōshin Realm itself. By the way, that God of Destruction was Beerus."

dbz,3e0893,TanooksPlus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:10:21 2015 UTC,"Also, there's only one Hakaishin (presumably, depending on who Champa is), while they had up to five Kaioshin at one point."

They have powers that make them good at what they do. It just happens that what they do and fighting don't mesh very well.  Beerus can blow shit up really well. But he hasn't displayed any other type of ability besides that which would be useful in him doing his job  Strength and power don't always need to be calculated in fighting ability, despite what Dragon Ball tells you"
dbz,3e0893,Mattyx6427,-1,Tue Jul 21 04:13:45 2015 UTC,because toriyama never though of gods of destruction when he created kaioshins and since he needed a new enemy that could easily lead to an entire new series and made logical sense he created the gods of destruction

dbz,3dxnh6,fatman40000,27,Mon Jul 20 11:30:30 2015 UTC,i think the moment he learned about it is also the moment he learned he killed Grandpa Gohan. i think Goku would be ashamed to use that form.
dbz,3dxnh6,Jiscold,18,Mon Jul 20 13:25:01 2015 UTC,I don't think he would. Goku said during Battle of Gods that he didn't like that he didn't obtain the god power on his own. I think Goku would see turning into a great ape as a cheat. He didn't train to obtain that form. It's a powerboost just because he's got a tail. I don't think he would see it as fair. Goku always wants to fight on equal terms to get the best out of each other. Being a giant would give Goku an unfair advantage.

Oozaru would still be his own thing. I think the 100% real reason is because the creator didn't want the series to turn into giant ape battles and wanted to keep the ""human"" side of it so we'd have a better hero... but a fan/creator who is defending this decision could say, ""the form was too big and not quick enough, like how goku/cell describe ascended saiyan form (bulky muscles)""."

Potara  First Appearance: chapter 501  Category: miscellaneous  Explanation: Ear decorations worn by Kaioshins and their attendants for generations. Despite being worn so casually, they’re actually an incredible power-up item. The Elder Kaioshin gave them to Goku as a trump card for defeating Majin Buu.  Special Characteristics: To use them, the two people who will merge simply each take one of the two earrings and put in on their left or right ear, respectively. Furthermore, after merging the power is greater than with Fusion. However, the two people will automatically merge as soon as the earrings are put on, and in principle will be unable to ever split up again, so caution is needed when handling them. The merged person will only split up when touched by the air inside Majin Buu’s body. Also, while with Fusion the post-merged clothing is the native dress of the people of Planet Metamor, when merging with the Potara not only are the two people’s bodies mixed together, but their clothing is as well. In addition, pathetically enough the East Kaioshin and his attendant Kibito merged together without knowing a thing about Potara fusion. (Daizenshuu 4, p.163)"

dbz,3dxre6,Nickolaus,10,Mon Jul 20 12:56:14 2015 UTC,"The Fusion Dance was created by a race known as the Metamorese, and according to what is said in the manga, there's no racial limitation on the matter. This is what Goku described the dance as in the original manga.   Goku: “So you know about it, Dende…! That’s right, some people from Metamor who I met in the afterlife taught me that art…It’s a merging technique which can only be performed if two people are fairly close in both power and body size…In other words, by having two people merge into one, they’re able to become a single, new human with amazing power which either of them on their own absolutely wouldn’t be capable of. It really is incredible! Those two from Metamor were completely weak and gentle on their own, but by using Fusion they transformed into a substantial warrior! …I was just taught the art, but I ain’t never tested it out…There wasn’t anybody on par with me in the afterlife…”   This is what is stated about the technique in the Daizenshuu   Fusion  First Appearance: Chapter 469  Category: special  People: Trunks & Goten  Special Characteristics: The specialty technique of the people of Planet Metamor. Goku learned this art from some people from Planet Metamor who he met in the afterlife. It is an art where two humans can merge together only if their power and body size are very close, and through merging the two users give birth to a separate person who possesses power and techniques far surpassing what they had on their own. When merging, the two users must perform the Fusion pose symmetrically; this pose if very embarrassing for two adults to perform. In the story, Trunks and Goten perform this Fusion, but they fail two times because their pose is slightly wrong. When they fail at this technique, it greatly changes the body type of the resulting person, making them fat or thin, and rather than strengthening the two users, it makes them weaker. The name after merging becomes a combination of the two users’ respective names, and in Trunks and Goten’s case, they ended up named Gotenks. Furthermore, after merging, their clothes are those of the citizens of Planet Metamor. (Daizenshuu 2, p.118/Daizenshuu 4, p.116)   In addition, this is what Toriyama had to say about fusion in an interview he did for the full-color release of the Kanzenban.   Q4: Can anybody perform Fusion if their body size and power are the same?  Toriyama: It’s hard, but they can!  I think it’s possible to merge no matter the conditions, as long as it all goes well. I even think it’s possible for a larger number of people. However, since it’s quite hard for both parties to strike that delicate balance, it’s very difficult for two extremely different people to fuse. In that sense, synchronized swimmers would probably be really good at Fusion. By the way, there are many different types of Fusion, and the kind Goku learned is the one for increasing battle power.  If a man and a woman fused, maybe they’d end up like a drag queen? A super-duper strong drag queen; it might be kind of interesting. I should have drawn that back during the serialization. (laughs) I kind of regret [not doing it].   So yes, there is no racial limitation surrounding it.  However, I think the reason you got downvoted wasn't because people disagreed with you in that topic. That topic was about relatively unknown facts, and in general I think it's fairly well known that the Metamorese fusion isn't limited to just Saiya-jin. It's stated in every version of the manga, anime, etc that it was an alien race that created it, and Goku simply learned it from them while in the afterlife."
dbz,3dxre6,axevillager5,10,Mon Jul 20 12:27:18 2015 UTC,"Namekian Fusion (Assimilation) : Beings from the Planet Namek are able to absorb each other completely into their being (the term in Japanese is ""dôka suru,"" meaning ""assimilate / absorb""). One character serves as the base body, while the other donates his life energy, strength, memories, and intelligence to the base. Dance Fusion (Fusion-ha) : Two characters must equal their fighting powers and energy, and perform a three-stage dance (stepping away from each other, stepping back towards each other, extending their index fingers, and touching their index fingers together; they must also say ""Fu / sion / HA!"" during each step, respectively). The resulting character has its own persona and attitude, as well as fancy new clothes (such as the ubiquitous vest). Under normal circumstances, the fusion lasts for 30 full minutes. Stages like SSJ3 and SSJ4 reduce this, however, due to the strain on the body. Also, each character must wait a full 60 minutes after de-fusing before being able to do so, again. Potara Earrings (Integration) : When one earring (of a pair) is placed on the opposite ear of another character, the two will be drawn together and fused into one being (the Japanese term here is ""gattai,"" meaning ""combination,"" ""integration,"" or yes, even ""fusion""). There are no requirements such as having an equal power; the two must simply exchange and wear the earrings. The resulting being wears a combination of the two characters' clothing, and has its own personal and attitude (similar to the dance-fusion characters). This fusion is supposed to be permanent.

Even if he succeeded in his mission, returned, and had this thought, he would have reached the same conclusion that Vegeta and Nappa did.   Vegeta: Everything else aside, Kakarrot's son's battle power... ...was unusually high, compared to Saiyan children. Nappa: It could have been some kind of mistake, couldn't it? Vegeta: No, there's no mistake. Raditz did actually take a great deal of damage from that kid's strike. Apparently, when our blood is mixed with an Earthling's, it results in a hybrid with mighty power. Nappa: Hmph, a Super Saiyan, you mean? I get it. If we were to produce those guys one after another, then once again, Saiyan rule will no longer be a dream. Vegeta: You've got to be kidding. Just watch those guys grow and gain even greater power for themselves. Then it will be our positions that are in danger. Nappa: That would be true. Vegeta: In any case, we will exterminate everyone on Earth. Three days should be enough for that. Until then, let's have ourselves a good, long sleep for the first time in a while."

dbz,3dvnwz,Usermane01,15,Mon Jul 20 19:38:28 2015 UTC,Why do you assume Raditz would want to repopulate the saiyan race?
dbz,3dvnwz,DarkPhoenixMishima,5,Mon Jul 20 00:55:15 2015 UTC,"More help for conquering planets. Plus, Raditz showed a lot of pride in being a Saiyan. It makes sense that he would want to spread his genes and continue the cycle of destruction and violence caused by the Saiyans."
dbz,3dvnwz,mgm666,9,Mon Jul 20 03:30:10 2015 UTC,raditz also seemed disgusted his brother had mated with earthlings.  so maybe that saiyan pride would be more of an impediment than a motivator.
dbz,3dvnwz,spartan_155,3,Mon Jul 20 03:40:58 2015 UTC,"That's what didn't make sense to me. There are no female saiyans around anymore, You either create hybrids or die off completely.

dbz,3dvnwz,-Vertex-,2,Mon Jul 20 04:28:43 2015 UTC,Logic and Saiyans don't mix. They have potentially doomed the planet just because they wanted a good fight. In Vegeta's case it happened after it was clear he would defeat Cell.

dbz,3dvnwz,tmanz06,3,Mon Jul 20 00:31:27 2015 UTC,"Even if we ignore that this is from filler, Vegeta's plead to Goku before he dies makes me think Vegeta did care when pushed."
dbz,3dvnwz,darkbladexd,4,Mon Jul 20 06:03:45 2015 UTC,"Well, Vegeta didn't want to repopulate simply because the plan was to get immortality. Who needs offsprings to carry on a legacy of an immortal?"
dbz,3dvnwz,PM_ME_THE_BEST_STORY,7,Mon Jul 20 05:47:50 2015 UTC,"The Saiyans could have interbred with the Tuffles, and probably a lot of other races as well. Your average Saiyan is born with a power level around 500-4000. The average human is born with a power level around 2-3(assumed) and has a power level of 5 when an adult.   Radditz probably could see that nobody on the entire planet was worth breeding with. There was probably more enticing races power wise that he'd want to exploit for those purposes.   Heck even Goku during the Raditz fight was only around 400-500. By the time he found out that the 1300 power level was coming from Gohan it was too late. He ended up dying in the fight against Kakkarot and Piccolo."
dbz,3dvnwz,_SpaceCop_,2,Mon Jul 20 00:05:34 2015 UTC,"Sure there are stronger species than humans in dbz, but humans were the most sexually compatible with the Saiyans. There's a good chance that Saiyans would not be able to breed with say Dodoria's race for instance, due to genetic differences. I assume basic principles of biology still apply in the dbz universe."
dbz,3dvnwz,MrOverAnalyzer,5,Mon Jul 20 01:57:32 2015 UTC,"Right but humans weren't the only human looking humanoids. Tuffles, looked exactly like the humans. HOWEVER, planet Vegeta(which was originally the Tuffle homeworld) has around 10x the gravity of earth. Meaning that they would have to be more powerful than humans just to survive on that planet.   Even with the Tuffles being more powerful than humans the Saiyans still didn't see them as a compatible race to interbreed with. However at the time they still had a race to begin with.   The point still stands though. There were human looking humanoids that were in space like the displaced ones that Krillen and Gohan rain into in ""Held Captive"", the 5th episode of the Namek saga. There were even ones in Frieza's army. Who knows what their average power levels are or planetary gravity.  The benefits of finding a more powerful race with higher gravity would be astronomical for training and Galactic Takeover."

For a proud race like the Saiyans, mating with an earthling would be more a sign of disrespect and he would've prefer to face extinction than to tarnish the Saiyan legacy. Also ..... We are assuming Raditz is into Earthlings. Technically he grew up meeting other races in the galaxy I'm sure he is/was attracted to other ones.  Finally, Raditz was on a mission to recruit Goku because they were on their way to conquer another planet. Nappa and Vegeta were waiting on him and since those two are way more powerful than him I am sure the last thing he wanted was to make them angry. He had no interest in killing the people of Earth, that was more a challenge to Goku to proof his loyalty."

dbz,3dv3ia,Denizenn,7,Mon Jul 20 10:59:15 2015 UTC,"I have a theory I've been pondering about your last point. Android 18 from the main timeline wasn't an evil killer and I don't think she ever wanted to be. Allow me to explain;  Android 17 and 18 in Future Trunks timeline were evil as fuck, they delighted in destruction and inflicting pain on others, it mainly stemmed from pure boredom as when they awoke Goku already died from the heart virus and they came into a world with nothing to do and no one to greet them other than Dr. Gero whom they knew they hated, and thus destroyed. Destroying the man who (I'm sure they remember) kidnapped them and stole their lives to turn them into his pet machines probably developed a bit of bloodlust for them. I don't think they're too different from the good 17 and 18, but rather didn't know any better and had no one to tell them otherwise as they were the strongest due to the Z fighters being unprepared to train for their arrival. They were just like kids with no one to discipline them, and with their overwhelming strength and abilities the most enjoyable thing for them to do was blow shit up, however that said I think their desire for violence mostly stemmed from their programming. Dr. Gero awoken them exactly when he intended to, so their programming would've still worked to some degree to tell them to conquer the planet and kill Goku and his friends.  Android 17 and 18 in the present timeline woke abruptly which may have hindered their programming, much like 16 being prematurely awoken had the same effect on him. They basically woke up, got revenge on the old bag that they wanted to kill for what they done to them (imagine what it would've been like, I picture a scene from the movie Saw where they're bound to a surgical table and he shows them all these plans, motors, gears, cybernetic limbs to be implanted in them, that's some pretty morbid shit man). Then after getting their revenge they're like hmmm, now what? We can see from the way they act in contrast to 16, a purely synthetic Android that 17 and 18 in this timeline had 100% overcome their programming and acted and sounded like normal people, cocky of course knowing how strong they are but human nonetheless. Unlike 16, robotic voice, speaks like on in monotone, initially only responding to anything to do with killing Goku. Android 17 and 18 when awoken were immediately shot at by Trunks trying to kill them, so naturally they're like, well I don't like these guys, fuck em.   So naturally they're thinking; let's talk to our new friend 16 who isn't trying to kill us. 16: Let's go kill goku fellas. 17/18: got nothing better to do I guess.  Then after beating up the Z fighters for trying to stop them, 18 shows how human she really is by showing Krillin that she wants his dick, how very un-android of her. Moving on we see them acting like kids with a get out of jail free card because they know they're the strongest currently. They steal a van, and cause a bit of mayhem by robbing the clothes store, but still they don't kill anyone. The cops who tried to arrest them got what anyone would do with their kind of power, bloodthirsty or not; trash their cars to send the message to not fuck with them, and then continue on.  Lastly, the Krillin thing. I believe Krillin's the main reason she changed, 17 I don't know we don't see him except for in the episode of Call to Action when he gives Goku energy. Anyways Krillin would've been the first guy to show her kindness by sparing her life with the remote, and saving her after defeating Cell when everyone else intended on leaving her to die. Granted, at first she reacted as if Krillin just pulled a dick move but I'm sure the traumatic experience of being eaten by Cell, spat out, then being surrounded by people who were all planning to kill you at one point is a little overwhelming even for the strongest minded of us.  So that's my theory; 18 and future 18 awoke into the world with the same mindset but future 18 was probably much less aware of her human emotions due to more effective programming, and she never met Krillin properly as 17 killed him IIRC from Free the Future.  This theory was in response to you calling 18 an evil killer android, when I believe, if you stick to the main timeline, she never was.

dbz,3dxay5,Nickolaus,3,Mon Jul 20 13:43:44 2015 UTC,"Because people have made it out to be so expensive. The game is quite common. You can typically find it around flea markets and used game stores. Most people will put a generous price around it. I have seen copies come and go from used game stores that I have been to for $25 complete in box.  How people think eBay works is if they see a price of a game that they own, they think that they can get the same price for it. So you then have this train of sellers following other prices around, causing more people to go through that cycle.  Another reason is that the game is probably the best in the series. It is also considered one of Atari's best produced games for the Dragon Ball video game series."
dbz,3dxay5,makethemsayayy,0,Mon Jul 20 15:22:10 2015 UTC,"So it was one idiot who unknowingly taught other idiots none of which know their ass from their elbow, let alone economics, and therefore artificially raised the market price on it, while refraining from learning the difference between their asshole or a hole in the ground?"
dbz,3dxay5,Nickolaus,3,Mon Jul 20 15:27:57 2015 UTC,"That is how reselling goes on eBay. It has been happening for years. You can especially see this in older NES/SNES games. There are a lot of other factors that can increase a price change, but there is no way in Hell that this game is worth $70 complete in box. Absolutely ridiculous."

Future trunks still resides in his time line where he was the only survivor of the Z fighters. In fact, I would love it if we get to see him again in the new series.  There is also a third timeline we saw in a flashback, the one where Cell the one from the Cell saga killed Future Trunks and stole his time machine. If you remember correctly, the Cell from the Cell saga is actually from the future. The cell from the ""normal"" timeline was actually destroyed in Geros lab.  You could also argue, although its never explicitly said, that all of the Dragonball movies take place in an alternate timeline since most of them are not consistent with the main timeline."

dbz,3dv9yu,Vegeto30294,4,Sun Jul 19 22:11:24 2015 UTC,"We don't know how the Hakaishin are assigned their roles or positions yet, but for the Kaiou and the Kaioushin, it's simply a matter of a lottery. The race that both the Kaiou and Kaioushin belong to, the Shin-jin, are born from the fruit of the Kaiju Tree, with both normal fruit and rare golden fruit growing from it.  If an existing Kaiou dies, a Shin-jin born from the normal fruit is chosen via lottery to become the next Kaiou in their place. While it's not said for sure if the same happens with Kaioushin and the gold fruit, we do know that only those Shin-jin born from the gold fruit can become Kaioushin."
dbz,3dv9yu,erhanfr12,3,Sun Jul 19 20:48:21 2015 UTC,Is it explained why king kai wasn't replaced since he died?
dbz,3dv9yu,vlorsutes,4,Mon Jul 20 01:01:30 2015 UTC,"Because dying does very very little to his actual role. Since he permanently resides in the afterlife, him dying would just send him...to the afterlife."
dbz,3dv9yu,vlorsutes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:06:51 2015 UTC,Thanks for your answer!
dbz,3dv9yu,vlorsutes,3,Mon Jul 20 01:29:44 2015 UTC,"No, it's not been explained yet (though it might come up in an upcoming special chapter of Dragon Ball Super that a few pages were leaked of), but it's potentially either the fact that he had died before his time (thus a replacement wasn't ready for him) or that, despite being dead, he was still readily in a position to perform his task."
dbz,3dv9yu,newtype06,0,Mon Jul 20 02:02:40 2015 UTC,ooh ok I didn't know about the kaiju tree. that makes sense but I hope they explain how it all started much later in the series like how this tree was created. I just googled and it said there are also evil fruits(demons) from the tree that the hakaishin take. so there may be a special fruit for them too.
dbz,3dv9yu,MoldyCat,5,Sun Jul 19 20:54:48 2015 UTC,"Not quite. There's not evil fruit from the tree, so much as there are Shin-jin that simply become delinquent and evil, and those Shin-jin are cast out as Makaiou, and those Makaiou are said to generally be weaker than Kaiou.  As such, there seemingly is no connection between the Makaiou and the Hakaishin.  In addition, in Battle of Gods, Whis makes a comment about Goku becoming the next Hakaishin after Beerus, which, while potentially just a joke given the context of the statement, could also mean that Hakaishin are given the job in a manner closer to what we know about Earth's Kami. That the previous Kami chooses a successor, and they take it on like a job, rather than it being a race-specific position."
dbz,3dv9yu,AgentPaint,9,Sun Jul 19 21:01:48 2015 UTC,"According to the backstory given to us through Battle of Gods as well as other information Toriyama's given us, Beerus is far from the only Hakaishin (rather he's simply one of at least twelve), and the Kaioushin and Hakaishin, while they don't normally get along, still see eachother as vital all the same for universal order."
dbz,3dv9yu,adrianmalacoda,7,Sun Jul 19 20:43:15 2015 UTC,"In episode 3 of Dragon Ball Super, the Kai's mention only one with deity status can sense other gods."
dbz,3dv9yu,Contramundi324,5,Sun Jul 19 22:41:23 2015 UTC,"To go with this, Old Kai states to Supreme that Beerus is the opposite of them. They create worlds and life, he destroys them."
dbz,3dv9yu,MoldyCat,2,Sun Jul 19 23:27:35 2015 UTC,So then why is Beerus so much more powerful than the Kaioshins?
dbz,3dv9yu,newtype06,8,Sun Jul 19 23:57:27 2015 UTC,"Probably because, as a god of destruction, he needs to be powerful enough carry out his duties. Whis offers Goku the job at the end of Battle of Gods, suggesting that this level of strength is a prerequisite for holding the job.  The Kaioushin, being gods of creation, do not need to have such excessive destructive power. However, the Kaioushin are extremely powerful themselves (the current Kaioushin even stating he was powerful enough to take out Freeza), just not at the same level as the Saiyans and Beerus. The Kaioushin probably have powers that Beerus doesn't, which don't involve destroying things."
dbz,3dv9yu,fullnelson13,2,Mon Jul 20 00:45:23 2015 UTC,"We've seen Kaioushin spontaneously create objects from seemingly thin air and unlocking the fighting potentials of other people. They also have telepathic communication and in King Kai's case, omniscience.   Interestingly, they also have their own forms of fusion, which might be how they were able to take out stronger opponents, but there might have been strict rules in place due to its permanence which might be why it wasn't seen as a be-all-end-all solution to dealing with Majin Buu."
dbz,3dv9yu,tmanz06,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:35:16 2015 UTC,"Trained under Whis? Or maybe they are equal. That is why Beerus turned Elder Kai into a sword, not able to kill him..."
dbz,3dv9yu,Supablue24,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:44:52 2015 UTC,"Yes thank you, I wasn't sure how to word it.   That makes me wonder,  since Gohan trained with the Supreme Kai's, does Mystic Gohan have god ki of a different type?"
dbz,3dv9yu,LX_Theo,2,Sun Jul 19 23:53:30 2015 UTC,No he has his potential unlocked for instant power access. No additional ki added.
dbz,3dv9yu,tmanz06,13,Mon Jul 20 00:24:41 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that Whis is the true Hakaishin not Beerus. Whis even looks like a Kaiōshin. Beerus is just the guy that... It's like the Emperor and Darth Vader from Star Wars. Beerus is the tool that Whis uses to destroy. When Beerus gets out of control, Whis just rewinds time 3 minutes and stops him from going overboard. When somebody stronger comes along the current ""destroyer"" gets replaced.  Kind of like what happened when Beerus was blowing up planets left and right up until Whis judo chopped him to stop the destruction. Beerus probably got the job by being the strongest mortal in the universe. So he got a promotion."
dbz,3dv9yu,LX_Theo,7,Mon Jul 20 00:16:12 2015 UTC,Interesting theory.
dbz,3dv9yu,tmanz06,4,Mon Jul 20 01:35:24 2015 UTC,"Unlikely, since it requires deity ki/power/whatever its called that is inherently different than the mortal version."
dbz,3dv9yu,LX_Theo,8,Mon Jul 20 02:06:37 2015 UTC,Who is to say he didn't get it from Whis.  It's stated in the movies that Whis is the fastest in the universe and is more powerful than Beerus.
dbz,3dv9yu,NOT_ah_BOT,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:14:43 2015 UTC,"Every instance of it being mentioned is something established by the species. Genetics. Not something that can be given.  So yes, its a bit silly.  The logical assumption for Whis being more powerful is simply because he has been training more Gods of Destruction than just Beerus over the years. Longevity seems like the most likely explanation over anything."

I walk in one day and he was in the space between my computer and the wall. Stuck. So I put him back. A few days pass and I find him standing up on the book-shelf that my computer sits on. I didn't put him there. My family didn't put him there. He did it on purpose. But I just went ahead and put him back. The final day. He's on the floor by the window. Which is across the room from the computer. I've had enough of his attitude by this point. So, now that I've gotten it signed by TFS and Kyle Hebert, I have grounded my Vegeta POP Figure to the box.

dbz,3duyrk,Moonwrath,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:43:22 2015 UTC,Universe 6 tho. Just wait for everything (Or most of it) to come out before passing judgment.  Multiverse is good but IMO it got boring eventually.

Love all the what if stories, of Cell winng, what if Buu absorbing everyone with intelligence/creativity/strength, and Goku never losing his memories and joined up with the saiyans.

Never have I been happy to see Dragon Ball revitalized to laugh at that assumption. Also, I never felt that Vegeta hated Chi-Chi. Wasn't that after-Namek part filler anyway? I would argue that Goku and Vegeta's love for their wives would cancel out Vegetto's love for either of them, and he wouldn't pick one family over the other.  Saying that it is better than Super is definitely pushing it though."

dbz,3dtf2x,Elevas,113,Sun Jul 19 07:33:42 2015 UTC,"Here's a theory. The Kais were able to agree on a voice between the two beings that fused, but Goku and Vegeta argued on whose voice to use so they settled for both at once."
dbz,3dtf2x,xSloke,35,Sun Jul 19 08:13:29 2015 UTC,That theory does make sense.
dbz,3dtf2x,Odin527,4,Sun Jul 19 08:47:08 2015 UTC,"This makes the most sense, not unlike when Piccolo fuses with Nail and merges with Kami, they agree to use Piccolo's body and voice.  The Supreme Kai, obviously more powerful than Kibito, is an obvious choice for dominant traits (and Kibito would have agreed).  It is hard to say if Elder Kai's fusion is the same, as his higher pitched voice could be from the fusion with the old witch, or from old age, or both.  As for Gotenks and Vegito/Gogeta: Goten/Trunks and Goku/Vegeta are very similar in power and role, and thus the fusions show traits of both, including physical appearance and voice."
dbz,3dtf2x,TyroKith,34,Sun Jul 19 21:10:24 2015 UTC,"The idea for characters who've used fusion to have their voices fused as well was introduced by none other than Akira Toriyama himself!   A section on “anime effects” on pages 94-95 of Daizenshuu 5 notes that it was Toriyama’s idea to create the voices of fused characters by having the actors of each character say their lines simultaneously.   In Elder Kaio-shin's case, they simply had no way of knowing that he was going to be someone who has already fused by the time he's introduced."
dbz,3dtf2x,TyroKith,17,Sun Jul 19 08:31:05 2015 UTC,"Good contribution. Please accept my upvote in the spirit in which upvotes were originally intended.  That's fine... And it'd be fine in the context of just Elder Kai. But Supreme Kai fusing with Kibito resulted in the same concept, right? Do we take away from this that Kais are different/special/automatically dominant? Or is there instead something special about Saiyans, do you think?"
dbz,3dtf2x,NeuroticNyx,15,Sun Jul 19 08:46:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's ever said why Kaioshin and Kibito's fusion is an exception. Ryo Horikawa (Vegeta) talks about how difficult it can be to record two people speaking simultaneously in this interview:   Q: Was there anything that you had a hard time with?  A: Goku and Vegeta’s fusion, Vegetto; I had to speak at the exact same time as Goku’s voice actress, Masako Nozawa-san. At first, I was unsure whether I’d be able to do it, but it went surprisingly smoothly. The only things we decided in advance were the spots where we should breathe.  Q: It was so exact that you’d think they aligned it by machine.  A: Really, it was almost mystical in how we made it through without a single flub. Granted, I’m singing my own praises here. (laughs) We could have gone with having one of us record their lines, then the other person match them, but we simply didn’t have the time. (laughs) We thought we’d just go ahead and try it, and when we did, it was a complete success! Normally, I’d think we wouldn’t line up.  Q: Could that be the gift of years of teamwork?  A: It is. I think that was a big part of it.   So even though it was Toriyama's idea to have the fused characters speak with a fused voice, perhaps production wasn't moving quickly enough with the voice actors who played Kaioshin and Kibito, and since they're not a main character, at least compared to Gotenks and Vegetto, only Kaioshin's voice actor, the more important of the two, was chosen.  But I'm just spitballin' here."
dbz,3dtf2x,MakeNoERROR,5,Sun Jul 19 09:04:18 2015 UTC,"Heck, it's a well thought out and researched theory."
dbz,3dtf2x,stewincubus,19,Sun Jul 19 09:09:20 2015 UTC,"If you noticed, the Kais generally remain the dominant one in their fusions.  I imagine that's why. The Kai influence overpowers the other participant, so you more or less have a Kai gaining the traits of the other fusee. Since neither Goku nor Vegeta are kais, they have just as much influence as the other in the fusion."
dbz,3dtf2x,JokeDealer,14,Sun Jul 19 09:02:55 2015 UTC,"Because there is no dominant personality between the two.Both of them are too proud to let the other be the dominant personality, or even have a dominant voice, so they end up having two."
dbz,3dtf2x,choss,12,Sun Jul 19 11:40:31 2015 UTC,well Elder kai had a deeper voice in the flash back where we see the witch and him fuse. That gives him the annoying high pitch old voice. But i dunno maybe thats from age? lol. Kibito kai has a deeper voice too which doesn't sound like any of the voices of the two in the first place.
dbz,3dtf2x,Armaada_J,3,Sun Jul 19 07:46:41 2015 UTC,Exactly. Pretty much explains my dilemma.
dbz,3dtf2x,IAteQuarters,7,Sun Jul 19 08:47:32 2015 UTC,"My own personal theory was that it had to do with which of the two personalities were stronger and/or more dominant.  Elder Kai was leagues stronger than the old witch and Supreme Kai was stronger than Kibito.  In the case of Vegito, both Goku and Vegeta have equally strong personalities, so there was no clear winner.  Hence the two voices."

An attempt was made for Vegito to maintain both marriages for a time, but ultimately Vegeta's (believable) contempt for Chichi and Goku's (generally platonic) love for Bulma saw Vegito move in with Bulma.  Bra in that universe was born to Bulma around the same time as Bra from GT.  Not canon, but they addressed it in a way that I had no difficulty accepting."

They've also done fantastic dubs on other anime - DBZ just wasn't one of them (they were too new at it as I believe it was their first - looks like they got better with practice).
dbz,3du4p7,Zcherub,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:25:11 2015 UTC,"How different is Funi's Kai dialogue compared to their original dub? I ask because I own the orange bricks and wanna do a rewatch, but I'm really not interested in filler. I'd appreciate any info."
dbz,3du4p7,Haktuar,6,Sun Jul 19 18:01:30 2015 UTC,"To me, a lot more interactions made sense. As I write this I'm trying to remember specific moments, but one thing I noticed throughout is that Kai not only cut the filler but really fixed the dialogue. It's a much more accurate translation. I rewatched the series via orange bricks, then less than a year later I watched Kai. Kai isn't completed in English yet (Buu story arc isn't out in English) but I can't go back. I watched a clip from Kai like 2 years ago and wasn't a fan, but once I tried watching it from the beginning I loved it.   The characters all have a much more consistent personality and dynamic.   Edit: thought of a very minor example. When Goku is powering up to fight Cell, Vegeta says ""no...fool..."" but in Kai he says ""damn...Kakkarot"" IIRC. The Kai dialogue makes more sense in that context because the scene is showing other character's reactions, and how they're overwhelmed by how strong Goku is. This is backed up by the fact that it cuts to Gohan who is focused but not phased by his strength, something that was done to support the scene later where Goku surprises Gohan by telling him that he hadn't been holding back."

For example, here's the infamous Freeza vs Nail scene in Funi Z vs Funi Kai.  My favorite part: right after Nail regenerates his arm, Funi Z Freeza says that he is ""copying that power because... it might come in HAND-y."" (in the original dub, he emphasizes the pun, but not so much in the redub). This creates an obvious plothole because we never see Freeza use this supposedly copied regeneration power during his fights with the Dragon Team, when it would have been very HAND-y indeed. Yep... they created a plothole for the sake of adding a hilarious pun. Funi Kai Freeza instead remarks that, even though Nail has regenerated his arm, his power level has gone down, which makes more sense in context.  ROF spoiler (example, still spoilers)."

This dub, which is commonly referred to as the ""Westwood dub"", began at episode 108 (uncut 123), and ran through the end of the series. The Westwood dub was never released on home media.  You'd have to find it online for streaming or download if you want to watch it."

dbz,3du4p7,sybest,2,Sun Jul 19 14:59:18 2015 UTC,"The only official releases of that dub are the original VHS/DVD Saiyan and Namek sagas and the Rock the Dragon Collection, which is just a re-release (and remaster?) of those two sagas. Nothing past ep 53 has ever been legally available for purchase. No streaming sites have it either.  As Nickolausthey says they did not dub from eps 54-107. There was a fan project to use the Japanese Dragon Box footage and audio from VHS recordings of the UK broadcasts for eps 1-53 and 108-276 but only the first 53 eps where finished, the rest where just tv rips in very poor quality. They sites that had them are long gone though.  Best bet is youtube. They have a bunch of clips, some full eps both fan remastered and original broadcast, but thats the best your are going to get."

It became a huge mess and caused many episodes to be censored. So the original 67 episodes were reduced to 53. From their onward Funimation hired their own in-house team to do the dubbing from episode 54. Eventually, the license Pioneer had would end. This is where Funimation re-did the episodes that were censored by Ocean group.  Eventually, this would make way years later of AB Group picking up the second half of Dragon Ball Z. (108 → 276) They re-recorded these episodes for broadcast in Canada and UK. Sadly, they never made it to home media.  Your best bet on finding these is scouring the internet."

Also there was a Youtube user who uploaded most of the episodes from the Westwood & Blue Water dubs, although sadly his account got terminated by Toei recently."

Really loving the show so far, I really don't understand what people are complaining about. Beerus' line about being able to watch an episode of an anime in the time it would take to get to Kaiō-sama's planet cracked me up! Totally broke the fourth wall.

dbz,3ds5u8,Mw3beast2013,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:56:21 2015 UTC,"So Beerus locked Rō Kaiōshin away in the Z-Sword, and he had Frieza destroy Planet Vegeta?    Where does it say he had Frieza destroy Planet Vegeta? All Whis mentions is that while Beerus was asleep he mumbled about wanting to destroy Planet Vegeta himself not that he ordered Frieza to do it, he even explained that he was just pissed off at King Vegeta's attitude which is why he mumbled about destroying it but no where did he claim to have given an order to Frieza and lastly i feel it heavily undermines Frieza's motives for destroying the planet, i mean his motive was to stop the Saiyans from becoming so strong that they'd pose a threat to him and if Beerus ordered it then that completely defeats this motive and essentially makes Frieza a puppet who followed orders rather than the cold blooded killer who nearly eradicated the Saiyans."
dbz,3ds5u8,Mw3beast2013,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:42:12 2015 UTC,"Here are some screens from the scene to which I'm referring. Whis says that it was Beerus who asked Frieza to destroy the planet. I do agree it undermines Frieza's character, because initially he simply wanted the Saiyans dead (or was afraid of a Super Saiyan being born if you listen to Vegeta.) I definitely like to think of Frieza as the cold blooded killer that you described him as, really fits his character and was the intended background for him in Dragonball Z."
dbz,3ds5u8,Drumada,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:45:07 2015 UTC,"Im not sure which translation is that but heres the one linked by /u/EmmaWinters that i watched and in it Whis only mentions Beerus talked in his sleep about wanting to destroy the Planet, not actually destroying the Planet or asking Frieza to do such a thing.  1 2 3 4   I definitely like to think of Frieza as the cold blooded killer that you described him as, really fits his character and was the intended background for him in Dragonball Z.    I agree, although honestly i feel the FUNimation mistranslation in BoG is the fault of this ""Beerus asked Frieza to destroy Vegeta"" line, FUNimations line was ""Tell me Whis, did that upstart Frieza manage to destroy Vegeta for me?"" And thats what led to widespread speculation that Beerus ordered Frieza when in the Japanese version of BoG Beerus simply asks ""What become of the Saiyans of Planet Vegeta while I was asleep?"". For this reason i believe the true intention here was that Beerus never gave the order nor had any direct communication with Frieza about the destruction of Vegeta (or anything else for that matter) but was rather elated to hear that Planet Vegeta was done away with since King Vegeta's attitude pissed him off and thats why i believe the translation in the link above more correct."
dbz,3ds5u8,DiggaDoug492,2,Mon Jul 20 04:13:12 2015 UTC,"The translation that /u/DiggaDoug492 linked to is DragonTeam's translation, which is the best out of any translation. You should base everything on their work until official subtitles are released.  While the wording was ambiguous in Battle of Gods, it isn't in Super: Beerus ordered (言付ける) Freeza directly to destroy planet Vegeta and the Saiyans."

Well thats a bit of a let down, It just feels like they're inserting Beerus into all sorts of events in Z, this also means Frieza's death wasnt all that significant because one of the symbolic elements of killing Frieza was to avenge the Saiyans and eliminate the tyrant who brutally betrayed their loyalty, now however, Frieza was but a henchmen of Beerus who had him destroy Vegeta which means Frieza is a mere puppet and his death is far less significant since the one responsible for Planet Vegeta's destruction is still alive. I guess it just bugs me that they would undermine Frieza's role like that."

They say it's been 6 months after Majin Buu, at least, but are there any time skips after that? In Episode 2, Bulma suggests having a cruise for her birthday, after seeing one on the vacation. That sort of implies there's a time gap in-between episodes 2 and 3. But then Elder Kai says Beerus has only been awake for half a day, implying all the events from Episode 1 onwards have happened almost simultaneously.  Unless the Beerus and Whis stuff wasn't happening at the same time as the slice-of-life stuff on Earth.

dbz,3ds5u8,TheFaised,5,Mon Jul 20 21:56:26 2015 UTC,http://gfycat.com/FewApprehensiveEquestrian
dbz,3ds5u8,Mr_Propane,2,Sun Jul 19 18:17:02 2015 UTC,"That wouldn't make sense though. The whole reason why Future Trunks showed was was to help the DBZ current timeline and to change the future.  When he returned to his own timeline, things were still the same as when he left, leading to believe that those timelines did not converge and are a reality separate from each other.    If Future Trunks did not show up in that timeline, then there would have never been a warning for the androids. Let's say the Z fighter do beat them with the help of Goku. What about Dr. Gero's Lab? I was hard to find even with Future Trunks help so I'd think that it would be harder to find without him. Also, remember that since we are considering different realities, the Future-Future Cell (the one that killed Trunks in the Future-Future, and went back to the current timeline and is the main villain) would've caught them by surprise.  Since we are taking the account that Goku did survive, we have 2 scenarios:    1: Goku and Z fighters beat all 3 androids released, and Future-Future Cell remains in his base form. That Cell was significantly stronger than 17 and 18 so I would imagine the Z fighters having a tough time beating him. Let's say eventually they did. Gohan would've never turned SSJ2 and none of that invaluable training they received over the course of that time (from 2nd form to perfect form Cell) would have happened. That would drastically alter the current DBZ timeline in a way that would not fit continuity in DB Super.    2: They aren't able to beat the androids in time and Cell is able to absorb them and become Perfect Cell. Things play out similar to what we see (w/o Future Trunks) up until 2nd form Cell. Future Trunks and Vegeta training in thr hyperbolic time chamber together was be a significant factor in the power boost at that time, and w/o Future Trunks, it's safe to assume that Vegeta would be quite weaker. We see that Vegeta allows Cell to absorb 18, but if Vegeta were weaker and understands that through fighting (since he would never say it out loud, that prideful prince) then would take all costs for Cell not to absorb 18. Future Cell however, did not weaken since he is built for the purpose of absorbing the androids. Cell doesn't get ""added"" power, Cell progresses to his next form with an insane power boost. Even at 2nd form, Cell was still hard to stop. Now various scenarios can play out which can drastically affect continuity of the current timeline.    So even if Cell was stopped in his 2nd form then Gohan would've never had the chance to go SSJ2.  Gohan is now extremely weaker in the Buu saga. Without all that training in the Cell Games, I honestly doubt anyone can stand a chance against Fat Buu if he is awakened by Babidi.    Ehhhh, went overboard on writing like usual, but my point is that by Future Trunks not showing up on the current timeline has huge effects on continuity and it would not be reasonable to suggest that Future Trunks just ""did not show up."""

I know the series will retreat the same plot as the two movies, though a tiny bit differently, but in an episode like this it really shows the downside to that. There just isn't much that can suprise at this point in time.  And while it was funny in the movie I think that the food obession of Beerus/Bill is a bit too much if it keeps up like this.  Though my only real problem with this episode... is it just me or does the northern's Kai japanese voice actor kind of... suck? His voice so sooo monotone and almost entirely devoid of emotion. The animation, especially the facial expressions and the tone of the voice rarely really match each other. At times it even feels like there isn't even any lip synchro going on, like the sound comes out of the off... like this is a really really bad dub.  Anyone know what I mean?"
dbz,3ds5u8,NefariousRaccoon,0,Sun Jul 19 18:01:12 2015 UTC,"Ah, just wait for the english dub to come out.  Until then, Japanese dub is all we have."
dbz,3ds5u8,Mw3beast2013,3,Mon Jul 20 03:45:58 2015 UTC,King Kai's voice actor is very old now. He probably just doesn't have it in him to shout as often as King Kai does.
dbz,3ds5u8,ZeroAbomination,4,Sun Jul 19 17:51:10 2015 UTC,"He sure sounds like he's lacking the energy or motivation.  I don't mean to disrespect that VA or anything, but maybe they should've replaced him with someone who sounds similar.  It was really jarring listening to King Kai being ""upset"" with Goku...really took me out of the episode."
dbz,3ds5u8,wildthing202,2,Mon Jul 20 03:26:04 2015 UTC,He's on Dragonball voice acting for 20 years. Do you really want to fire that 80 year old man.

dbz,3ds5u8,yungwerther,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:58:31 2015 UTC,Since they moved Bulma's party to a cruise ship what does this mean for Battle of Gods originally ? Does that make it non-canon ? Or do we pretend like that perspective didn't happen ?  I'm kinda lost here. Fellow DB friends help lol
dbz,3ds5u8,whiterungaurd,2,Mon Jul 20 02:20:19 2015 UTC,"It means BOG is semi canon.   Everything is the same except location change and maybe some clothing changes(Gohan, trunks, goten). There are new dialogues as well but overall the theme is the same."
dbz,3ds5u8,shockzz123,2,Mon Jul 20 10:17:46 2015 UTC,"That its retconned, Super is the most recent and up to date incarnation of the series and as such takes precedence over past works, so as a result, since BoG was canon, Super's BoG arc retcons the movie and takes precedence as the canon version of events. So Bulma's birthday party happened on a cruise, not at capsule corp and happened 6 months after Buu, not 4 years."
dbz,3ds5u8,Zcherub,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:36:22 2015 UTC,Another good episode. I love Beerus and Whis' relationship it's great. Kinda worried about the next episode because it looks like the animation quality may get worse.

dbz,3ds5u8,Zcherub,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:27:15 2015 UTC,so it's not just me who was thinking that? I really don't understand why they didn't get the voice actor to give more emotion when he was recording his lines. he sounds asleep for everything he says
dbz,3ds5u8,ATDghost,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:15:44 2015 UTC,I love his voice actor when king Kia is not angry but when king Kia is throwing a fit it's still mono toned and that's just weird

They don't know anything about the original cast & wouldn't even be watching it in Japanese at all if a dub were available (no matter how inaccurate that dub might be).

dbz,3ds5u8,Kamina-,7,Mon Jul 20 01:04:32 2015 UTC,Oh look at me I would watch it in Japanese even if there were dubs because I'm so much better than everyone else
dbz,3ds5u8,NefariousRaccoon,-2,Sun Jul 19 22:04:09 2015 UTC,"No, I enjoy the dub of a lot of shows (Cowboy Bebop, Death Note, etc.). I watch the original when it comes to DBZ because the dub is bad (although kai is better)."
dbz,3ds5u8,Sorge74,2,Sun Jul 19 23:50:12 2015 UTC,"Which is a fine opinion to have, but it doesn't make other people wrong for thinking differently. It's also a valid issues that was brought up, if all of a sudden the voice of one of the characters on say the Simpsons was like that people would mention it too. DBS isn't immune from criticism."
dbz,3ds5u8,Stronkadonk,14,Mon Jul 20 00:45:24 2015 UTC,That's unnecessarily insulting towards a very valid complaint.  The intonation and emotion in the voice don't match the wacky animations at all.  They should have either found a voice actor with the vitality for the part (no offense to the current guy) or had the animators tone down the visual antics.  It feels like a fan dub the way it is right now--so dry and out of place.

dbz,3ds5u8,anonpurpose,4,Sun Jul 19 14:28:07 2015 UTC,So did Vegeta get weaker? He was struggling to stand at 150G when he was capable of training at 400G during the Android Saga.
dbz,3ds5u8,anonpurpose,4,Sun Jul 19 14:08:36 2015 UTC,He was just in his base form and Vegeta never really trained in 400G because that was filler.
dbz,3ds5u8,BlackCatScott,6,Mon Jul 20 05:23:44 2015 UTC,The difference is that he is now dodging tones of lasers. Back in Buu Saga he was just punching and he was in Sayain form. So my guess would be no.

Eager to watch it with subtitles of course because there was a lot that went over my head, but I think I got the gist of it having seen Battle of Gods and knowing what direction we're headed in. The animation was fine. I was pleased at the balance in this one. We didn't spend too long with one group of characters.   Highlight: That picture of Gohans wedding makes me happy."

dbz,3ds5u8,Untu98,4,Sun Jul 19 01:26:47 2015 UTC,"Having watched the whole series in Japanese recently, I know enough words to get an idea of what they're saying. For example Beerus is wanting to find goku and then he says bento. I knew he was asking whis to make a lunch to go because during the cell saga satan and the rest hear cell say gohans name which means steamed rice so they called him bento boy thinking gohans job was to deliver lunches to them.  Bottom line, I recommend watching the show in Japanese at least once. Since you already know what's going to happen, it's not even a chore to watch. Plus you'll like some of the Japanese voices better than english. Freezas japanese voice is downright evil."

And now that I think more about it, having more time to (re)tell the events of those movies could mean that we get more information on Super Saiyan God, we might see how, when and why Vegeta gets SSG and how him and Goku attain SSGSS so that's pretty cool. Also we get to see more Beerus and Whis and that's really awesome, they became two of my favorites characters in the series pretty much instantly in BoG.  Really looking forward to the next episode and I'm enjoying watching it live in japanese every week (first time I do that for an anime and I'm surprisingly understanding pretty much the whole episode even though I haven't studied that much japanese), having a big smile on my face the whole time as if I was back to being a kid.

Goku endlessly keeps getting stronger, with Super Saiyan 3 in the manga and Super Saiyan 4 in the anime; does Super Saiyan keep getting limitlessly stronger too? Might we eventually see things such as a Super Saiyan 5…?!  A. Super Saiyan 2 and 3 are nothing more than powered-up variations of Super Saiyan. After the fight with Beerus, Goku realized that mastering his normal state and Super Saiyan would raise his level more and sap less strength, so I think he probably won’t become Super Saiyan 2 or 3 any more.   LOL, In my mind I just see him glaring at the guy and in a death whisper saying ""We DO NOT talk about GT"""

It's a side story, with only as much weight as the first 13 Dragon Ball movies - nothing more.   It is COMPLETELY non-canon.

dbz,3dq23p,MrWinks,2,Sun Jul 19 00:40:09 2015 UTC,So basically Ssj is stronger than ssj3??
dbz,3dq23p,mykeedee,13,Sat Jul 18 14:47:58 2015 UTC,"I'll explain.  Think of Goku in terms of numbers.   SSJ lasts longer than SSJ2, which lasts longer than SSJ3. The difference seems to imply endurance, so, it would be easier to think of each form as a limitation of blow to blow.    For example,   let's say SSJ can do 10 damage per blow.  Let's say (purely making up numbers/multipliers) SSJ2 does 20 damage for the exact same blow.  Following this example let's say SSJ3 did 30 damage per blow.   By this alone it would make sense to always be in SSJ3, right? Well it seems Toriyama is implying that Goku is still Goku in all three forms and that SSJ is a transformation with three states of power. What that means is that in the end all the SSJ transformations are equal in their limitation and the difference is in power output. What that means is that even though each form does different amounts of damage, as I invented numbers for above, they all have an equal amount of limit in total damage, which let's say in this example is 5000 damage.   Goku can do 500 blows in SSJ at 10 dmg each, or 250 blows in SSJ2 at 20 dmg each, or 166 blows in SSJ3 at 30 dmg each.   In the end his endurance is equal across all the forms; the SSJ transformation gives him an equal amount (5000) of dmg, while we could assume outside of the transformation (non-SSJ) he would not have that endurance (we could say 2000 dmg).  Does that make sense? I think Toriyama is saying that Goku wants to work on getting the regular SSJ transformation improved because the other forms are just power-ups of that one. It's like saying your gun can shoot 1, 2, or 3 bullets at the same time but you only have a certain number of bullets; it's better to learn to shoot more efficiently or better than to just stick to always shooting 3 bullets every time, which can be wasteful."
dbz,3dq23p,Conbz,4,Sat Jul 18 19:33:14 2015 UTC,Except SSJ3 makes Goku 8x stronger than SSJ.
dbz,3dq23p,MrWinks,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:20:16 2015 UTC,Okay but if it drains his energy at 16x the strength of Super Saiyan (Goku can stay Super Saiyan for over a week but only about half an hour at SS) then it's a less useful technique than just raising your strength.
dbz,3dq23p,mykeedee,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:38:21 2015 UTC,I invented numbers. What does it matter? In the end he still only does the same total damage.
dbz,3dq23p,MrWinks,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:05:49 2015 UTC,"No he doesn't, you are relying on SSJ multipliers being linear which is inherently false.  What would Goku do against an enemy too fast for him to deal with at SSJ1?"
dbz,3dq23p,Saratje,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:09:32 2015 UTC,"Apply the same logic to speed. The point isn't the numbers so much as the idea that each form of SSJ uses more ki and stamina that the prior, and that in the end it's better to raise one's total ki/stamina to perform best."
dbz,3dq23p,landician,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:01:18 2015 UTC,"Trick that enemy, as with Frieza and the underwater attack. A faster enemy might still be an idiot (whether arrogant or plain stupid) and Goku is a great judge of character to guess if his enemy can be fooled or not. An experienced fighter like Vegeta might see it coming when Goku pops up behind him, goes SSJ3 and uses up most of his reserves in a huge Kamehamea. While Buu'd smile and drool in awe while it impacts."
dbz,3dq23p,choss,17,Sun Jul 19 18:34:38 2015 UTC,"Well the way I read it, Goku can reach a level with ssj that is equal to what he had with ssj3.

dbz,3dq23p,AzoGalvat,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:59:16 2015 UTC,It's a little different. That scenario was the fact that they couldn't reach SSJ2 power levels without gaining huge muscle mass. Goku has the form down for SSJ3. It just takes a fuck ton of energy to use.

The Kaiōshin (who create planets) and the Gods of Destruction (who destroy them) have never gotten along that well, but once every 1,000 years they go to each other’s realms and hold a coordination meeting. At this time, they got into an argument over some trifling thing, and a certain short-tempered God of Destruction sealed Elder Kaiōshin away inside a sword. Naturally, it wouldn’t have been proper for him to destroy the Kaiōshin Realm itself. By the way, that God of Destruction was Beerus.   Well no wonder Old kai got so nervous when Beerus showed up in BoG! Didn't wanna go back in the sword."

Considering he was also stronger than Goku when he went there it is a fair enough assumption that his power raised ratiometrically the same amount Goku's did. Not counting the Kaio Ken buff. Tien was the only human worth his weight during the Cell arc. Even with his power hack Krillin was useless. Krillin gave up fighting for 7 years. Tien persevered.

dbz,3dsq3i,UWaffle,20,Sun Jul 19 02:22:29 2015 UTC,Actually dying would kinda defeat the purpose of surviving a near death experience.
dbz,3dsq3i,Vegeto30294,9,Sun Jul 19 02:56:03 2015 UTC,no because their body doesn't heal and adapt to the damage it was dealt
dbz,3dsq3i,shabaIabadingdong,5,Sun Jul 19 03:06:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think it works with death, only near death and non-self inflicted near death at that. The way I always thought of it was to liken it to Doomsday from Superman. Anything that beats him he evolves to overcome. Not on the same scale but pretty much the same principle."
dbz,3dsq3i,Krillin,2,Sun Jul 19 03:04:42 2015 UTC,This could explain why it took longer for vegeta. Maybe if he survived freiza and didn't have to get wished back he could have gained a boost. But didn't through death.

dbz,3dsq3i,sir_frog_alot,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:53:09 2015 UTC,I doubt it since normal people don't keep their bodies after death. But as for people like Goku who can keep their body after death I'm going to say maybe but I'm not entirely sure since it hasn't been confirmed as far as I know.
dbz,3dsq3i,ChuckBronze,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:36:12 2015 UTC,"It may have only been a line added to the dub but I thought Vegeta mentioned he was even stronger after coming back to life on Namek. It was when he was picking a fight with Gohan.   I kind of agree with the opinions here that death would nullify the effect. Then again Vegeta did have massive wounds that were healed when he was wished back on Namek. And we know a Saiyan doesn't have to heal by himself to get the boost- rejuvenation pods, senzu beans, and even Dende's healing technique will do it. Not sure if straight up magic from the Dragon Balls would trigger it though since they are already dead and just come back to life with a restored body."

dbz,3dt8vx,EmmaWinters,16,Sun Jul 19 07:04:00 2015 UTC,"The 'teleporting' around during combat isn't an instant change like IT. It's moving really fast as opposed to teleporting. There may be a distance limitation. If the observers are powerful enough, they can still see the movements whereas there is nothing to see with IT."
dbz,3dt8vx,redgroupclan,8,Sun Jul 19 07:47:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah I believe Vegeta made that distinction when Goku first showed off the IT. Its was somewhere along the lines of "" what's the big deal? He's only using hyper speed to disappear.""  but then after he came back with Roshis glasses did Vegeta get surprised and annoyed at the IT"
dbz,3dt8vx,alex828x,4,Sun Jul 19 16:11:14 2015 UTC,"One is called the After Image technique, which can only limit you to the proximity of your opponent, while the other one is called Instant Transmission,  which can project you across the galaxy."
dbz,3dt8vx,nameless_row,2,Sun Jul 19 20:41:55 2015 UTC,"While after images are used quite a few times in DBZ, but they are different than what OP is talking about.   After Image = Goku rushing at Frieza and suddenly his image fades away to reveal the disc behind him.  In other words, the enemy thinks their target is still in the same place.   Teleportation = Super speed movement to different point (like behind an opponent) in order to dodge or attack. It's a burst of speed that looks like teleportation.   In both of these cases you still have a trail from point A to point B. Like so:  A---------->B  They're both essentially the same thing except with the after image technique they are purposefully slowing themselves just enough to leave an image behind just after they move to distract an enemy. To someone that can see the movements you are still visible on the way from point A to B.  Now for the Instant Transmission. This is  why the Instant Kamehameha was pretty much an attack only Goku could use. This was straight up real teleportation. And he mastered it to the point where he could charge an attack and instantly transport himself while still charging it to fire it. Using a quick bust of speed this wouldn't be possible cause all energy is directed at keeping the attack charging. So the journey from point A to point B is nonexistent, like this:  A>B   So no matter how good of an eye someone might have they would literally not see Goku until he pops back up at point B from his journey from point A.   Sorry for the odd formatting I just like typing like this on the comment boxes."

For Dragon Ball, your best option is the Blue Brick DVD sets. [4:3 Native] For Dragon Ball Z, your best option is the most recent Blu-ray set [16:9 Cropped] For Dragon Ball Kai, your best option is most recent Blu-ray/DVD set.

dbz,3ds2k9,Martyax,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:01:10 2015 UTC,"There are definitely Blu Rays, for a least some of them. It's been at least 5years since they released, so I'm a little foggy on the details..But I don't think the mastering of the movie BluRays is that great. For the 90s/late 80s films, I mean.  Battle of the Gods is wonderful on Blu Ray Disc. Resurrection F should be great as well.  As a side note,for Dragon Ball Kai, Toei Animation took the old cels, digitized to HD, and then cropped them for TV and Japanese home release. FUNimation was given the pre-cropping footage, and for the home releases in North America, left it as such. The BluRays, however, have a full 16x9 aspect ratio in that the black bars are par of the image. 1440x1080 pixels is the show's footage, and the black bars on the side fill it out to 1920.  So on the DVDs, you can stretch it or leave it untouched, but on the BluRay, effectively, we only have the 4:3 image, and it will only play on a widescreen.  Still better than than the JPN releases.

dbz,3ds2k9,dopeminebeats,2,Sun Jul 19 06:57:17 2015 UTC,"Not too badly.  It aired Sunday morning (as now Super does btw), to be markets towards kids (as Dragon Ball iS a ""Shonen""-pre-early teen boys - comic advertisement), so at least from what I have heard, the first short arc with Vegeta and whatnot is toned down. but notably, from the DVDs that I own, the hole in Goku's chest after Piccolo's attack, is censored. And there might be one other scene censored. But everything else is left intact.  The music is different, though. For the out-of-print ""Part"" and Japanese releases, they had the 2009 orchestral/rock/synth track by Kenji Yamamoto, but by the time episode 96 came out in Japan, it was found to be plagiarized, so when FUNimation released the season sets and anything after ep 52, around Super Goku vs. Freeza, they gave us a rearranged, makeshift version of the old 1980s martial arts movie soundtrack. The American replacement score from the 2000's dub, by the way, is not present at all. It took me awhile to transition, honestly. Just a different feel from the little I had sampled back in the day. It fits the show, though. The American actors and script have vastly improved, by the way. Sabat, Schemmel, you name it, have gushed over how wonderful they think Kai is. Freeza is more properly gay-British-fake-nice evil, Gohan...more appropriate age wise, but it's basically a young Luffy voice. And does not fit, and grates a ton. Honestly, early on, there are parts where I switch to Japanese in this case. Nozawa had a""cute"" Gohan. As it goes on, in the Cell arc, Colleen's version gets better.I believe she does Android 18 as well, replacing Meredith McCoy, and Monica Rial replaces Tiffany Vollmer. Not that different in either regard, honestly. Either/or, for me.   Chris Sabat has many more stand-ins for his old characters, but he still has to do Vegeta,Piccolo, Yamcha,God, and Reacoom. If you don't know, back in 97, when Saban (the Canadian censorship/editing /licensing company similar to New York-based 4Kids!) quit funding the new company FUNimation, and couldn't use the Canadian crew at Ocean Group, they had to hire folks off the street for a year, and so they had 11 actors(Sean Schemmel-Goku/Kai-O, Sonny Strait-Kuri-lin, Vollmer- Bluma, Chris Cason-Tenshinhan, Karin the cat, Mr. Popo shared with Sabat, Cynthia Cranz-Chi-Chi, Linda Young- Freeza)  mostly called in by Sabat, who got the role of the Freeza saga.  Point being, it's a much bigger and better company now, and they've improved a lot of their mistakes. A lot of these people were not even real actors. Just general arts type folk. The team that remains from 1998 has grown very much into their roles.  For that reason, as well as pacing, I chose primarily to purchase Kai. I'll pick up the old version at some point, but it's really more for completeness than entertainment.  I don't have a very strong nostalgic sense for the old dub, and I mostly read the comics, so I like the ""true"" script that American Kai maintained over my attachment to the old 2000s replacement music."

dbz,3drwb9,Love_and_Beer,24,Sat Jul 18 21:32:07 2015 UTC,"Whereas Nappa, with his noble blood, is considered an elite and strong by saiyan standards.   Nappa isn't stated at any point to be of noble blood.   By Frieza saga, his power level expanded to over 10,000. By the fight with Frieza, his power level explodes to 75,000.   His battle power never reached 10,000 or higher until after his potential was released by Saichorou. Saichorou's process of releasing potential gave them a considerable initial boost, and then their strength continued to grow from there for awhile before capping out. His 10,000 was not long after the initial power-up, and then the 75,000 was after he had basically capped out.   So somebody explain how the saiyans with all their battle might and zenkai boost, couldn't wipe the floor with Frieza. If 1 year of training and fighting can lead to such insane limits being met, why couldn't generations and lifetimes of fighting and training achieve the same results?   Outside of filler and other content not in the manga's continuity, there's nothing indicating that Saiya-jin did any kind of training whatsoever, and when it comes to battle, it was likely a matter of either they overwhelmingly won (in which case they wouldn't receive a near-death power-up) or they lost and died. Even if they did come to near death during any of their conquests, they wouldn't have the benefit of senzu beans or Dende's healing to allow for quick recovery. From what's been shown, the rejuvenation tanks shown periodically through the Freeza Saga belong to Freeza's organization, and as such wouldn't likely be something that the Saiya-jin could readily use for quick recovery.  Likewise, according to Toriyama, the majority of Saiya-jin are rather simple-minded, and thus the idea of them intentionally trying to injure themselves to get stronger isn't something likely to ever cross their minds.  In short, they simply didn't seem to do any kind of training (instead relying on their own existing strength) and didn't really have a way to acquire near-death power-ups."
dbz,3drwb9,vlorsutes,8,Sat Jul 18 21:59:46 2015 UTC,"One could also argue Freiza watched the Saiyans closely, and had those showing explosive growth eliminated (see: Bardock and co)"

dbz,3drwb9,vlorsutes,-1,Sun Jul 19 01:10:17 2015 UTC,Nappa was a high class warrior in DBZ. You could only get to be a high class warrior by having noble blood.
dbz,3drwb9,Astomi,6,Sun Jul 19 00:12:31 2015 UTC,"No, according to Toriyama, there were only two high class, and that was Vegeta and his father, with ten middle class warriors and the rest being low class. Likewise, class was determined solely by strength, not by nobility.  From Toriyama's interview in the March 2014 issue of Saikyō Jump   Q - About how high was Bardock’s battle power, ultimately? (In Episode of Bardock) Also, if he hadn’t been defeated by Freeza and had continued his growth, about how strong would he have gotten?  Toriyama - To be honest, I haven’t thought it through that far, but Bardock is a low-class warrior. Although even saying that, almost all [Saiyans] were low-class warriors, and there were only about 10 mid-class warriors. And when you get to the elite warriors, there’s only King Vegeta and Prince Vegeta. Bardock is in the upper ranks as far as low-class warriors go, but he isn’t able to become a mid-class warrior.  This rank is determined by an innate latent battle power, but naturally, if their battle power rises greatly afterward, they can be promoted.   So if a Saiya-jin grew strong enough, even one that started as a low-class could easily become an elite. Nowhere in the manga was it ever implied that rank came from nobility, and by Toriyama's statement, we know that's not the case."

dbz,3drwb9,teaoverlord,2,Sat Jul 18 22:05:38 2015 UTC,"I thought you were gonna go somewhere else with that. But you went with power levels =/.   I have the same gripe with the consistencies, but not based on power levels. Just think about it:  Goku and Vegeta are really powerful when they have Goten and Trunks. To the point that they can transform into Super Saiyans at a really early age. Pan can wipe the floor with people in the Tournament, and she's like 3. She was born when Gohan was really powerful.   So, clearly, power transfers to the progeny. The stronger the parent is, the stronger the child (Goku was weaker when he had Gohan, Gohan ended up being weaker. Goten was much stronger at age 4 than Gohan was). So, if the kids are born powerful as a function of their parents' strength, then the Saiyan race, in general, should have kept getting stronger and stronger. Coupled with the fact that they always fought, the race should have gotten stronger exponentially.   It'd be different if they were a young species, but they're old. Frieza, or anybody for that matter, should actually nothing to Saiyans. If consistency mattered, no way a Saiyan should be born ""with a power level of 1"".   If there were non-fighting Saiyans, though, then that completely trumps my argument. However, I'm under the assumption that they all fought as much as possible."
dbz,3drwb9,BoilerMaker11,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:10:30 2015 UTC,"I definitely considered adding that in, but my explanation was already getting lengthy as it was. Truthfully, I feel like Goten and kid trunks basically ruined DBZ for me because of how insanely powerful the kids were. It completely destroyed the magic of turning super saiyan for me when a toddler was able to do it so easily. And even worse, they really didn't accomplish anything. They were just comic relief that was obnoxious.  My theory is that the saiyans were a clan of warriors that actually came from 2 different planets. One being the home world, and the other being planet Vegeta. The planet that we all know is Plant, and that was because it was conquered by the saiyans, which then turn was named planet Vegeta. It's stated by King Kai, that the saiyans were greatly outnumbered by the Tuffles, so it reason to believe that perhaps the saiyans led by Vegeta were only a small fraction of population, whereas the remainder of their people stayed behind to another planet.   So maybe the clan was too few in size and that's why they never really grew all that strong? What do you think?"
dbz,3drwb9,SaikoGekido,2,Sun Jul 19 03:46:40 2015 UTC,"Saiyans were brutal. You lost a fight? You're worthless. You're dead. This isn't really noticed that often in the series, but Saiyans tended to cull their own people who were defeated. A good example is how Vegeta straight up killed Nappa with barely a thought about it, because Nappa failed. Could Nappa have survived and gotten stronger? Definitely. But why would the nobility risk it?  That is where we get an interesting twist. If you rule an entire species because you're the biggest badass on the planet, you will kill anyone who challenges your power. That is seen in the Brolly back story, where Brolly was to be murdered because he could be a threat. Aside from challenges to the hierarchy, King Vegeta knew that he needed to keep his people's boost a secret. If Frieza found out how strong Saiyans could get, or even about Super Saiyans, Frieza would wipe them out. Lo and behold, shortly after Brolly was ""killed"", Planet Vegeta was destroyed because Frieza found out how strong the saiyans could become.  I'm not sure how much of this was intentional, but it all makes sense. Now for why Nappa never advanced beyond 4,000 ki is directly related to this power problem. He rarely had a chance to use zenkaii boost, because very few species in the dragonball universe are naturally powerful. Basically, everything they conquered had less than 4,000 ki. Without a challenge, there is no boost. It is also what kept him alive for so long, since failure could mean death.  For Vegeta's and Goku's incredible boosts in power on Namek, power directly relates to fighting spirit. Everything leading up to the Namekian fights was training and hardship. They were constantly getting stronger. It wasn't like with the other Saiyans who would pretty much turn oozaru and stomp planets to ash for Frieza. They were really honing their body, skills and determination. This is exactly what Frieza was afraid of. If the Saiyans had ever been allowed to realize their full potential, there would have been an entire planet full of Vegetas and Gokus (and possibly a Brolly).  TL;DR: The saiyans never rose up to defeat Frieza because of political machinations by King Vegeta to hide his people's true power, which ultimately failed. The zenkai boosts that Vegeta and Goku display in the Namek Saga are exactly what Frieza was afraid of. (Krillin's boost was from the Namekian Guru's Unlocked Potential, and unrelated to zenkai boost.)"

And during his training in the space pod, Goku doesn't get one Zenkai boost, he gets many, that's why he uses a lot of senzu beans.  90,000 to 3 million is a 30 times increase, and there's no explanation whatsoever given why he recieved such a large increase in strength, and at that time Goku was being projected as the Super Saiyan of legends, so it seems fair. Power levels are pretty much non-existent after the Freeza arc, and the Zenkai isn't seen after that saga too so we shouldn't bother too much about 'em."

dbz,3drwb9,caneut,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:21:44 2015 UTC,"I want to add that I feel like Goku's and Krillin's constant ridiculous increases in power come from the fact that they're both trained martial artists. Frieza, Vegeta, and the other Saiyans seemed to rely on natural brute strength and not fighting technique.   So somebody explain how the saiyans with all their battle might and zenkai boost, couldn't wipe the floor with Frieza.    I can think of two reasons:  A. Zenkai is extremely risky. We see it happen because the characters have access to emergency medical supplies, Senzu beans, Dende's healing, etc. The Saiyans were barbarians for most of their existence on planet Plant until they overthrew the Tuffles, and I seriously doubt they had access to any kind of life-saving technology or magic- they were more likely to die. Combine this with my above theory about training (which would have induced Zenkai, as exercising breaks down cells in your body) and you can see why Zenkai might be rare, if it ever happened at all.  B. The Saiyans are a proud people. Even when they did finally have access to medical technology, mortally wounding yourself to get stronger is a desperate act and might have been considered cowardly.  Also consider that the Saiyans considered Frieza an ally. It wasn't until Bardock (non-canonically, apparently) called bullshit that Frieza showed his true colors. Even if they were strong enough to survive the explosion, it's kind of hard to breathe in space."

Ultimately though, the timeline is more or less irrelevant to your point.  so sorry to be a pedant.    Zenkai boosts were relatively rare because a saiyan has to heal from injuries, not merely sustain injuries.     The saiyans were barbarous and lacked camaraderie.  If a saiyan was injured enough to receive a zenaki he probably just died.  There were no senzu beans on planet vegeta, no dendes with healing powers.  There were probably those liquid healing pods but the hypothetical injured saiyan would need to be carried by his fellows and placed into one.  This seems at odds with the saiyan character.    As for Goku and Vegeta's explosive gains, I think that has a lot to do with their ki awareness.  This seems to augment the zenkai for some reason."
dbz,3drwb9,Murkemurk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:22:50 2015 UTC,"Well for one, you have to take in the training received from fighting opponents way above your level, which is why we get Krillen.  Also, the show also put huge emphasis on how you become stronger when protecting the ones you love, sure zenkai boosts help, but what allowed Goku to take advantage of zenkai boost to its fullest was his love for fighting, and his love for friends.  That, is also why Goku is special. I also have a bit of head canon that Goku is just such a phenom at fighting, a true God at ki, that he's been emitting ki every since he was born. This explains so many things. How Bardock became a SS after traveling through time. Why a regular old human kid (Krillen) was able to surpass a martial artist of Roshi's caliber, (which I would also like to add, I'd love to see some quick DB ova of Gohan with baby Goku, maybe a small adventure to a small city where he incidentally contacts Yamcha, Krillen, tien and etc, which explains how they became such masters at a young age) It also explains why Bulma was able to survive or do some of the inhuman things she's done, small amount of Goku ki. Why the half saiyan child was able to absorb so much ki from his Father/God that he ascended him for a short period. And one of the biggest ones, it explains why the planet Earth, which was almost destroyed by Goku vs Vegeta 1, is able to get off without a scratch from Cell and Buu, just lol."

dbz,3dqz23,ReviewerRandom,2,Sun Jul 19 09:29:53 2015 UTC,You mean don't give them MORE terrible ideas. I kinda thought making their names puns on different liquors was sorta bad to begin with. I honestly didn't even notice that was what they had done until I found out the hefty Beerus was named Champa.
dbz,3dqz23,smccormick92,0,Mon Jul 20 06:20:49 2015 UTC,"Are you complaining about the names being puns? Seriously?  Most of names in Dragon Ball are puns of something. Videl is just ""devil"" backwards, most of saiyans are names of vegetables, Ginyu Force was milk subproducts, namekians are slugs and snails, Piccolo Daimaoh servants were musical instruments, ""Frieza"" family was cold-related, etc, etc..."
dbz,3dqz23,ReviewerRandom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:26:16 2015 UTC,I never complained about their names being puns. I said I didn't particularly like that their names were puns on liquor. I never said I hated it or anything. I wasn't even complaining about it.
dbz,3dqz23,smccormick92,0,Mon Jul 20 13:50:03 2015 UTC,"Isn't he Bilz/Bils/(something similar) in the Japanese version, though? I remember him being referred to as Bilz for a good solid year before we even knew there would be an English translation."
dbz,3dqz23,Elevas,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:25:33 2015 UTC,"His name in Japanese is Birusu, or ビルス, and was conceived by Toei originally to be a pun on the word virus. When Toriyama came on board, he saw the character's name and mistook it for being a pun on ""beer"", which is why he named Whis what he did, a pun on the name ""whiskey"".  Bills came around as a name simply because we didn't know the actual pun source at the time, and Bills is one of the possible transliterations of the name Birusu. While a good number of individuals stayed with Birusu to stay safe, the Bills name did spread around a good bit, gaining some popularity as being ""official"" due to some Japanese merchandise at the time, such as a Battle of Gods-themed Nintendo DSi LL case (albeit a third party one), that had Beerus's name as ""Bills"".  However, when the movie actually aired theatrically in Japan, official movie pamphlets from Toei listed the character as ""Beers"", essentially solidifying that ""Bills"" wasn't a correct name for the character.  tl;dr - Bills was only used by people before the name pun was learned. In Japanese, the character's name is Beers."
dbz,3dqz23,vlorsutes,7,Sun Jul 19 15:58:33 2015 UTC,"Boo was sealed away for millions of years and he was only released for two days before he was killed. If Beerus was aware of who Boo was, he likely only saw him in his kid form."

Going to the tournament, Kibito Kai being killed by Dabura, Vegeta's sacrifice to kill Buu, the fight between Good Buu and Evil Buu, and so on and so forth was all in a day. They wanted two or three days so that Gotenks could become as strong as he could to kill Buu, but he got impatient and went to the lookout."

dbz,3ds9j5,devinkiz2,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:35:55 2015 UTC,"so training is really simple. You chose a character you want to level up, select their training partners (i always chose guys I dont want or I have multiples of) and then chose some items aswell. This will just level up your character, but I found after I made my chioutzu train with another two of the same chioutzus his special attack level went up by 2.  Awakening is something I dont know alot about. Maybe look through the help section."
dbz,3ds9j5,krockhunter,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:11:15 2015 UTC,Is there any perks of training with like two orange characters or using same type items or anything?

dbz,3ds9j5,phyre1129,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:54:11 2015 UTC,"All that goes into effect, plus the higher lever fusion fodder used, the more exp per fusion material.  Also if you use the same character to train itself, you level up the special attack of that character.  Kid gohan is the easiest to do this with due to the event going on."
dbz,3ds9j5,HollowPsycho,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:26:36 2015 UTC,"Ok, here goes:  Training is done to level up your characters faster than combat alone does. To train, you first need a ""partner"". This can be any unit not currently in your teams, up to 5 units. Keep in mind, the partner you use will be destroyed, so don't use anybody you don't want to lose. You can also select up to 5 items to train with. Items boost exp, and items of the same ""type"" as the character you're training give bonus exp. Training costs Zenni based on the amount of partner/items used and the starting level of the person you're training. If you use a copy of the person you're training with, that will increase their super attack. This is the only way to increase a character's super attack level and is a good way to get rid of dupes. You can see a sum of the cost of training and the exp you will get at the bottom before you hit the ""Begin"" button.  Awakening is done to evolve your characters to the next level of rarity once they reach their maximum level in their rarity category (20 for Common, 40 for Rare, 60 for Super Rare. At this time you cannot awaken Super Super rare characters). Awakening requires material known as ""Awakening medals"". Theses medals are obtained from capsules that you pick up along the path while playing. The rarer a character is, the more/rarer medals they require to Awaken. To awaken, go to teams>>Awaken and select your character. You will see 2 rows of up to 5 medals. The top are what's required and the bottom are how many of that type you have in stock. Tap the pulsing medals in the top row to confirm that you want to use them. a yellow bar with ""Awaken confirmed"" will link the top and bottom row of medals to show you have enough. If you do not have all the medals, you can still partially awaken. Partially awakening boosts the character's stats, while a full awaken boosts their rarity level, giving them a higher level cap, and changes their type to a ""super type"" (example: Str>>Super Str) Super type characters do not have an elemental weakness to normal type, only other super types. Each character can only fully awaken once.  Hope that answers all your questions!"

Shading is also bad, there should be much more of it and it shouldn't be all scribbly, you've thought about the lightsource atleast but it's still not correct.  Background isn't very good either, but I would suggest forgetting about background until you can do a good foreground  I would mostly tell you to try and copy better artists, trace their lines and use their colors until you can do it yourself. Maybe practice on this or this Once you can do that then maybe spend a week on one single artwork, this looks like a 2 hour work. Eventually you will be able to produce better works in a shorter amount of time."

dbz,3dq9zj,fullnelson13,6,Sun Jul 19 02:44:05 2015 UTC,"My personal take at this would be introducing to a new person that the movies are ""what-if"" situations. They never happened, nor are they in the manga's continuity. Watching the series blind and not knowing that the movies are not events that are real can be a bit of a mess. A person new to the series would be better off watching the movies in the conjunction of the anime/manga. Our FAQ covers this quite well. A direct link can be found here.  You can try to fit them into the series, but they were intended on being watched in relation to the main series."
dbz,3dq9zj,Nickolaus,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:14:47 2015 UTC,"The anime itself was intended to be watched as a bonus to the manga. It was advertisement for Shonen Jump, not the main product.   This is why there are so many spoiler-ific seeming titles. They were given to be recognizably comparable to the manga chapters. ""Oh, this episode will animate that part of the story"".  It's almost as if the anime is not meant to be seriously watched, but is more like a 20-minute commercial-with-bonus."
dbz,3dq9zj,huzaifa96,4,Sat Jul 18 17:27:05 2015 UTC,"I see that you've taken a bit of VegettoEX's reply and formed it as your own. While you are right, and I won't disagree with you anywhere, the anime was pretty much the only form of entertainment outside of Japan. I personally did not grow up reading the manga and many people did not either.   The anime outside of Japan was not so straight-forward as you're making it out to be. Many kids and adults who were watching the show never read the manga. Most people thought the anime was as is. Sure, you had that select few audience who did read the manga while the show aired, but not everyone did."
dbz,3dq9zj,Nickolaus,2,Sat Jul 18 17:49:24 2015 UTC,"Are you trying to say it's possible to enjoy the anime and/or movies without reading along page-by-page in the manga and comparing it word-for-word and shouting at the anime that it's not canon if it didn't happen in the manga?

dbz,3dq9zj,Etonet,2,Sat Jul 18 18:26:24 2015 UTC,"Here's my version - Movies 2-4 have to take place earlier, because Icarus is around to help Gohan in the Garlic Jr. Saga (and he's introduced in Movie 3).  Return of Cooler has to take place later, because Dende is already the Guardian of Earth - so it wouldn't be able to happen until the 10 days before The Cell Games.  Daizenshuu 7 also says it takes place around this time.   Movie 1 - Dead Zone  Dragon Ball Z Episodes 1 – 36 (Saiyan Saga)  Movies 2, 3, and 4 - The World's Strongest, Tree of Might, and Lord Slug (3 introduces Icarus, Bulma has memories from 3 in Lord Slug)  I place these here because Goku couldn't become a Super Saiyan yet, but he knew North Kai's techniques. To account for the living Z-Fighters who should be dead, I've just always said they used their 1 free day on Earth.  Dragon Ball Z Episodes 37 – 74 (Namek and Ginyu Sagas)   Dragon Ball Z OVA - Bardock, The Father of Goku - Watched here, as to not spoil Frieza's appearance.  Also originally aired during The Ginyu Saga.*  Dragon Ball Z Episodes 75 - 125 (Frieza, Garlic Jr., and Trunks Sagas)  Movie 5 – Cooler’s Revenge – Daizenshuu 6 – takes place in 3 years in training for the Androids  Dragon Ball Z Episodes 126 – 174 (Androids, Imperfect Cell, Perfect Cell Sagas; Partial Cell Games Saga)  Dragon Ball Z OVA - The History of Trunks - I think the best place to watch it is here, so the viewer isn't spoiled to Androids #17 - #18, plus it originally aired between Episodes 175 and 176.    Movie 6 – Return of Cooler – Daizenshuu 7 – takes place during Cell Games wait  Movie 7 – Super Android 13  Movie 8 – Broly The Legendary Super Saiyan  Dragon Ball OVA – Plan to Eradicate the Saiyans  Dragon Ball Z Episodes 175 – 194 (Partial Cell Games Saga)  Movie 9 – Bojack Unbound  Dragon Ball Z Episodes 195 – 207 (Most of Great Saiyaman Saga)  Movie 10 – Broly Second Coming  Dragon Ball Z Episodes 208 – 249 (Partial Great Saiyaman Saga, World Tournament and Babidi Sagas, most of Majin Buu Saga)  Movie 11 – Bio-Broly  Dragon Ball Z Episodes 250 – 253 (Partial Majin Buu Saga)  Movie 12 – Fusion Reborn  Dragon Ball Z Episodes 254 - 288 (Fusion Saga and Most of Kid Buu Saga)  Movie 13 – Wrath of the Dragon  OVA – Son Goku and His Friends Return  Movie 14 - Battle of Gods  Movie 15 - Resurrection ‘F’  Dragon Ball Z Episodes 289 - 291 (Partial Kid Buu Saga / Dragon Ball Finale)"

dbz,3dq9zj,Nickolaus,3,Sat Jul 18 12:14:36 2015 UTC,The events of Revival 'F' take place a year after the events of Battle of Gods.
dbz,3dq9zj,shlam16,2,Sat Jul 18 12:35:52 2015 UTC,"My take:   1) The Dead Zone Episodes 1-78 OVA 1) Bardock: Father of Goku OVA 5) Episode of Bardock    I put these here because in episode 78 we get the flashback to King Vegeta told from Frieza/Vegetas POV. I think this is the best time to flash back and watch the films themselves.    Episodes 79-118 OVA 2) History of Trunks    Just before we meet Trunks. An alternative would be to wait one more episode and do it just after we meet Trunks.    Episodes 119-125 2) World's Strongest 3) The Tree of Might 4) Lord Slug 5) Cooler's Revenge 6) The Return of Cooler    These all happen during the 3 year period waiting for the Androids    Episodes 125-173 7) Super Android 13 8) Broly the Legendary Super Saiyan OVA 3) Plan to Eradicate the Super Saiyans    These all happen during the 10 day wait for the Cell Games    Episodes 174-194 Bojack Unbound    This happens directly after Cell is defeated while Gohan is still a teen.    Episodes 195-206 10) Broly Second Coming    This happens before the whole tournament stuff begins    Episodes 207-242 11) Bio Broly    This happens during the Buu saga, but before the boys learn to fuse.    Episodes 243-251 12) Fusion Reborn    During the Fusion saga, but before Super Buu comes into being.    Episodes 252-288 13) Wrath of the Dragon OVA 4) Return of Son Goku and Friends 14) Battle of Gods 15) Resurrection of F    They clearly take place after Kid Buu    Episodes 289-292     It's the exact way I recently rewatched the series and I think it worked perfectly."

Like some of them don't suit being a part of a big happy family, but they still pull it off. ie. Piccolo still always serious, and a bit uptight but still has his comical moments, like with the stupid bingo earth game. Vegeta much the same, but is focused on protecting his pride but as well as his family which he's unadmittingly become more accustom to since Buu was defeated, 18 who seems quiet and has nothing to say because she probably still feels awkward being around people whom were all trying to kill her at one point, nonetheless she still fits in well with the other characters and by now would feel at home with them.  This is the stuff I want to see more of in Super, I never realised how enjoyable Dragonball can be even without all the fighting."

By Battle of Gods, many villains have become allies and made up a big family that defends Earth from evil threats. Goku's empathy for even the worst foes and his forgiveness for everyone such as Raditz, Vegeta and Freeza are what make this show/manga so great. It shows good overpowering evil and love/friendship always winning.  The ""family"" they have by this movie is just proof of it and how ""Goku is everyone's friend"" as said by Nozawa. It's what makes this franchise so great."

dbz,3dpas0,Exsous,11,Sat Jul 18 08:47:43 2015 UTC,"Just a confession, I used to really dislike DBZ. I watched a bunch of it, and quit right in the middle of the fight with cell, at that one really climactic moment where gohan gets powered up. It was a moment of exasperation, as that fight had been going on for like twenty episodes and I was so bored that I didn't care about the show anymore. I let that one moment of boredom color my opinion of the whole series, and I thought it was a long winded, repetitive show with ludicrously overpowered, one-dimensional characters.   I eventually came back to she show after I bought dragonball xenoverse (I thought the game in of itself looked fun) and watched from where I left off. It's funny, cause I realized that if I had stuck it out for a couple more episodes I probably would have kept watching, as then I would have seen that awesome moment with the 1-handed Kamehameha from Gohan. It was after that that I really became a fan of the series.  So as someone who used to despise the show, I can completely understand where those people are coming from."

I've noticed the English dub is a much bigger victim of this than the Japanese dub.   i don't know what good anime/manga is   I wish a lot of people would just keep their mouths shut instead of saying something like this.  So many anime fans have this elitist attitude that whatever they watch is objectively superior and anything else is garbage.  Shut your mouth and let people enjoy whatever they like.  You can think that someone's tastes are garbage but don't go around telling them that.
dbz,3dpas0,Kamina-,8,Sat Jul 18 05:54:59 2015 UTC,"My friends don't like it because most fans of this show and anime in general can be insanely weird.

He looked at me and said ""Why do you like this?"". So I said ""I wanna show you something"". Then on the ""orange bricks"" I switched to the Japanese audio with subs, and about 15 minutes into it he looks at me and says ""I like this. If you and your brother watched this version back then, I probably woulda got into it."" This coming from a person who's never seen an anime in his life, and is a WW2 buff with not so favorable views on the Japanese (not really, only kinda).

That or they refuse to read it because of the crude humor, or just tell me there are better and more popular anime to get into.  Thing is, I never watched Dragon Ball Z because it was anime.

They just don't like the art. I get that, but for a good story I endure. Plus you get used to it.  2.) They don't like fighting shows. Mostly female friends, but some male ones too. And I get that. DBZ is especially long with lots of filler if you're not watching Kai. It's worth it to me to endure, but I can understand how it puts people off. Kai has been great for getting people into the series... but even it is dauntingly long.  3.) It's too long. And it is really long, even Kai. It's quite a committment to even get through the Freeza Saga and of course you want people to endure to at least the Cell Saga. But most people see 100+ episodes and tune out."

How one can enjoy a show where everyone is literally shouting every time? It's too old, bad animation, bad storyline. It's stupid. In the next century, Goku will probably get Ultimate Super Saiyan 420, what's the point of the show if they are just powering up every time, we will know that he will win always. aka shonen hater Too wild, blood and shit. I don't like fighting that's why I hate DB. Too many episodes to watch. Fightings are too long, I left watching just in the middle of Frieza Arc. Over-hyped, mainstream.  Most common reason among the other anime lovers Fighting never ends, even if Goku dies, and other dies, they're resurrected again with Dragon Balls which is like an endless loop of fight > die > revive. The fuck is the whole point of this anime? I prefer Japanese, but oh boy, Goku's voice sucks so much.   and million more reasons that I don't remember."

dbz,3dpas0,havebananas,3,Sat Jul 18 06:14:04 2015 UTC,"I mostly hear lack of intelligent plot as the main reason. On that, I can't argue much with them. It's not exactly Game of Thrones by George RR Martin level writing and Akira Toriyama repeatedly keeps saying he keeps Dragon Ball simple so that it's accessible to everybody.  For a moment, imagine if George RR Martin did get to write DBZ. Then Piccolo would secret plot to murder Goku all this time, starting by stabbing Gohan in the heart after years of friendship. Yamcha who always stands in the shadow of Goku and others would let them die because of jealousy, only to be captured by Frieza and have his wiener sliced off. Krillin would drink and spend his Zeni on ladies, while always paying his debts. Tenshinhan and Chiaotzu would be very fond of eachother. Chi-Chi would die and return undead to avenge her fallen son and husband, while Goten would learn to become the world's greatest assassin to avenge his father, mother and brother. Mr. Satan, king of the known world, would die while being drunk on a dinosaur hunt. As for the siblings Trunks and Bra, lets just not even go there. xD"
dbz,3dpas0,IvanPetar,9,Sat Jul 18 10:51:49 2015 UTC,"lack of intelligent plot   Ironically the plot is one of the things I like the most about DBZ.  It's not full of political intrigue like Game of Thrones, sure, but I love that we start the series when Goku is a kid and end it when his grand daughter is a kid. You really get to see these characters grow up, fall in love, change and grow and learn and die and everything. I think it's one of the best things about DBZ... and is also one of the reasons I'm sad we've been stuck with 7/8 year old Goten/Trunks for 20 years lol."

There are people who dislike it because it's ""mainstream"" or too many powerups, something like that.   Most DBZ fans I find are ones who grew up with the show as a kid.

She was already watching Team Four Star's dbz-abridged series (because my brother and I were obsessively waiting for episodes and she'd watch just because she wanted to be cool I guess). But then I got her to sit down with me and watch from the Future Trunks episodes (cause that's where I first got pulled in) and we pretty much marathoned for a few weeks after that.

It's very likely that Fat Buu, if properly enraged, can come close to reaching Evil Buu's strength, but as we saw, the only time he's ever become that enraged resulted in him expelling the Pure Evil Buu as a result.

In Ginyu's case, he simply couldn't tap into Goku's strength because he didn't know how to properly use his body to tap into its full strength. With Fat Buu, it's that there were two warring natures of ki and two different influences affecting him.

So, in essence, the dam was still there, just the majority of the evil ki it was blocking had been diverted around it."
dbz,3dr0qr,PiccoloTheSuperNamek,2,Sat Jul 18 18:10:30 2015 UTC,I get you. I'm just saying that if Fat Buu had full access to all the power in his body he should be equal too Super Buu.  They have the same amount of powe as a being. But Super Buu can tap into more if it.

dbz,3dqby4,choss,11,Sun Jul 19 12:16:22 2015 UTC,"It is not recommended skipping GT entirely. You do not have to watch it after watching the series, but it is still worth watching to form your opinion about it. Some people on this subreddit come and go with opinions that suggest do not watch it at all because it's garbage. GT is one of those shows that you have to appreciate for what it is. If you cannot get into it after the first sixteen episodes, then simply do not watch it. You could get way by skipping to episode 22 and then just watch the episode recaps. That is if you're looking for more action than actual plot.  The only two things that I enjoyed about GT was the Shadow Dragon saga and the Baby saga. That aside, GT does not have much to offer. Some people could argue the opposite, but it is best to form your opinion about it than taking someone's word about it.  There are some reasons why GT could not be considered canonical to the manga. It blew away source material and tried to go for two parts of the fan base. The Dragon Ball fans and the Dragon Ball Z fans.   But I just started watching Super. I'll eventually get to watching Dragon Ball Z    As stated about GT, it is not recommended to skip Dragon Ball Z and head onto Super. There is a little bit that you'll be missing. You could easily finish the Z portion of the manga in less than a week. I'd suggest doing that instead of watching Dragon Ball Kai or Dragon Ball Z. (That is if you have intentions on wanting to know about Z) If you plan on going that route of reading the manga, start at chapter 195 of the manga and work your way forward."

I should point out, however, that all this stuff about alternate continuities is fandom based. There's no official word about continuity, but GT was an anime only story that Toriyama didn't write, which is why most of us consider it to not be in the manga continuity.  ""Officially"" speaking, however, GT takes place so far into the future that Super really hasn't had a chance to contradict it yet."
dbz,3dqby4,adrianmalacoda,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:36:19 2015 UTC,"Just think GT as an alternative, it's not considered canon (which means it's not written by the original author, Akira Toriyama). You can watch it when you want to, it's somewhat good too. So the canon order would be:    Dragon Ball > Dragon Ball Z > Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods movie (They're going to re-tell the stories of this canon movie and Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F' movie in Dragon Ball Super, you can skip it overall but it'd be a great if you watch them, Resurrection 'F' English dubbed is not out yet, not even the HQ version of the movie) > Dragon Ball Super."

dbz,3dqby4,Bawlze,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:38:45 2015 UTC,"It's a bit of a grey area atm.  GT supposedly begins 5 or 10 years after the last episode of DBZ but Super takes place before and during the 10 year gap after the last major villain saga in the series so it hasn't really had a chance to contradict it yet as it's only JUST started so it's up in the air.  The more in-depth details are since BoG and RoF happened most consider the events of GT non-canon since those films introduce new characters, concepts, and ideas that were never brought up in GT since GT was made BEFORE those movies.  I categorize it into two timelimes:   Manga Timeline - This is where the events depicted in the DB and DBZ manga happen or said by Toriyama to have happened and nothing else. Anime Timeline - This is the show's timeline where events not depicted in the manga happened such as filler arcs between the major sagas as well as some movies that can be logically placed into the timeline without contradicting the series. The events GT happens in this timeline.   So really it's all up to personal taste. You can go strictly by the manga or follow the series. GT follows the anime series for me and makes the most logical sense but in the end GT is kinda like bonus material, if you watch it then great and I'm sure you'll find some things to like in it and if you choose to ignore it then that's fine too and you lose nothing. It's just a further expansion on the DB universe.  Also quit watching Super!!! Go back and watch DBZ then watch Super."
dbz,3dqby4,NemesisPrimev2,-1,Mon Jul 20 13:10:23 2015 UTC,"GT takes place around 15 years after the Buu Saga, Super takes place around 6 months after the Buu Saga.

dbz,3dqby4,noturdogg,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:11:34 2015 UTC,"As long as the person watching GT remembers that Akira wasn't 100% involved in the story line there I guess they should watch it as a ""might as well"" thing or else I can imagine the viewer constantly saying ""but why would X do this when he could've done X that he learned in super""  Personally the first episodes of GT (except the first one) are horrible and boring then it picks up again when they come back to earth but it also feels like they are random fights with little to no build up."
dbz,3dqby4,choss,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:23:55 2015 UTC,"GT isn't part of Super's continuity though, so it's not as simple as that. GT is an alternate continuity where the concepts introduced in BoG, RoF and Super don't exist, and the concepts introduced in GT don't exist in BoG, RoF and Super's continuity either.  That being said, GT can be watched anytime after finishing Z."

We see no signs of God powers or references to the gods in the final episodes of Z which take place after all the God events, so it's possible.   I could see them doing something like that where it doesn't directly lead to GT, but it leaves an open ending where GT is still possible if you want it to be."

To be fair, the last episode is more like a chill episode, nothing happens there to justify the appearance of the gods or to even to bring the god power up.  But this is also Akira and I highly doubt he thought to himself during the works of the final dbz episode ""in 18 years from now I will tell the story of how goku became a god before this happened"""
dbz,3dqby4,choss,0,Sun Jul 19 12:31:31 2015 UTC,"Technically nothing introduced has been retconning yet. Super Saiyan God can be dismissed as kid goku can't tap into the power. Vegeta isn't introduced until Baby saga where SS4 is higher power level than god.   The first scene with slightly older pan will retcon. If Krillin or any other Z fighters die that will also retcon. Its totally fine to dismiss GT if you want, but its also still possible to hold onto hope.  Cue last episode of Super: Pilaf picks up a dragon ball at kami's look out. The dragon ball has a black star something the gang has not seen before and they decide not to mess with it. They eventually find the regular dragon ball's and wish to be older to address issue in Battle of the Gods. Whoops accidentally 80 years old.  The gang comes back a year later this time for the stronger stuff the black dragon balls. Roll GT opening."
dbz,3dqby4,Atremizu,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:06:51 2015 UTC,"Side materials indicate that Vegetto was stronger than SSJ4 Goku, and in the extended version of BoG Goku indicates that not even a fusion between himself and Vegeta would be enough to fight Beerus. This heavily implies SSJ God Goku is stronger than Vegetto, and hence stronger than SSJ4 Goku.  Also as of now, Pilaf and co's age is retconning GT, and until we actually see him reverse the wish that will remain the case. RoF also completely retcons GT with pretty much everything it introduces."

dbz,3dpgfw,mmmasian,0,Sat Jul 18 09:34:23 2015 UTC,"Well inconsistency would only apply if Super Retconned something in the earlier halves of Z, such as saying Goku first accomplished Super Saiyan 2 against Vegeta, that would be inconsistent since its said he accomplished it and Super Saiyan 3 in the other world, the end of Z chornologically is after Super, so retconning it cant make super inconsistent but rather make the end of Z inconsistent with Super (which is canon), since Super is the undisputed Canon by Akira, if they retcon anything previously established (Pans age, the Super Saiyan God ritual, the ending of Z entirely) then Super takes precedence and so we are to discard those and go by Super's version of events since Super is the most recent canon."

I also get the feeling it was mentioned in Z but I can't say for sure.   The Tuffle war obviously only exists in Plan to Eradicate the Saiyans and GT.
dbz,3dp7ks,Cosmodious,7,Sat Jul 18 08:18:55 2015 UTC,I'm fairly sure it was mentioned in Z as well that the saiyans shared their planed with the Tuffles who were more peaceful and advanced.

It was done by Shueisha. You can find more information over on Kanzenshuu.  Toriyama likely did the coloring for some of the manga, but he really did not enjoy it. He brought this up in the Super Art Collection how he used to tell Kazuhiko Torishima that let him draw few color manuscripts.  ~~  He speaks of how he colored and what he used to color in the Daizenshuu:   Next I’d like to ask you about color manuscripts: what do you use for coloring? A color ink called “Luma”. A shōjo manga artist from a long time ago told me about it. Until then I had been using a water based color pen that came out squeakily and dissolved in water. This made covering a large area very tough. So when I used this color ink, it made me go “Ah, there’s something this useful? Now I can get it wet and not squeak.” (laughs)  Do you think of the color scheme for a character’s clothes and body when drawing them in black and white? Yeah, that’s right, but I don’t do it consciously. When I’m applying the color, I think “It was more or less this color”. However, with people that I’ve already drawn in color before, I generally don’t go back and check, so sometimes I end up using different colors than I did before. (laughs)   There are many other examples that I could list, but you can head over onto the Kanzenshuu translations for it. It is interesting, because he speaks of how some of his colors that he did changed often."

Additionally, just because some of those characters would let themselves get hit by it out of arrogance doesn't necessarily mean it'll work. We've seen before where techniques that did work against someone substantially stronger than the user (Chaozu's Paralysis Arts, for example), and since it's still a ki based technique on Akkuman's part, it still has that possibility of not working against targets vastly more powerful than he is."

The model for No. 16 was Dr. Gero’s son, who died young long ago. He was a high-ranking soldier in the Red Ribbon Army, but he was felled by an enemy bullet. Having a special place in his heart for his own child, Gero gave No. 16 great power and a fearsome explosive mechanism1, but not wanting him to be destroyed in battle if possible, he gave him a gentle personality, which caused No. 16 to become a failure.   In the same book, he explains Number 19's origins, as well.   Q5: Was there a model for Artificial Human No. 19?  No. 19’s model was a doll! The model for No. 19 was a doll that was displayed in the command center of an enemy base. Way back when, Dr. Gero took it back with him as a war trophy.   In volume 6, Toriyama reveals 17 and 18's real names, and what 17 has been up to.   Q5: Please tell me Artificial Humans No. 17 and No. 18’s names from back when they were humans! No. 17 is Lapis, No. 18 is Lazuli!    Q6: Where’d Artificial Human No. 17 go after the Cell arc, and what did he do? He works in the wildlife preserve area of a gigantic royal nature park, as an outstanding guard who doesn’t hold back against poachers. It’s an ideal job for No. 17, who loves to be on his own and isn’t big on cooperating with others; since he’s so good at his job, he takes in a high salary. He’s married to a zoologist; they have one child and two adopted children, and live happily in an isolated house inside the nature park.  He went and met No. 18 and Kuririn one time, but didn’t talk about what he’d been up to, maybe because he considers such a wholesome lifestyle embarrassing."

It’s got a bit of post-battle aftermath, continues with the “Battle of Gods” arc where the God of Destruction Beerus appears and the “Revival of ‘F'” arc where Freeza comes back to life, and then, I’ve written a strange new story where they finally depart from this universe. They’re fighting against their neighbors, Universe 6! They’ll yell at me if I give away too many spoilers, so I’ll keep the rest a secret, but they’re chasing after giant Super Dragon Balls; I think things will unfold in a bright and simple way, that will be really fun and exciting!

dbz,3dm7d9,mrtangelo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:16:46 2015 UTC,"Summary: My story would be set in 3 different places. 1. the main storyline would be about Vegeta vs. the remnants of Freeza's empire. 2. Goku's side story while training on Yardrat and learning the instant transmission. 3. everyday life of the z fighters, adapting to peaceful times. Until the shit hits the fan again with Vegeta's battle coming to earth (but the z fighters never meet up with vegeta. They will feel him fighting on earth but they willl be occupied with henchmen of the villain vegeta is fighting). So storyline 1 and 3 will be connected that way and Goku will stay as a sidestory with a bit of connection of the main plot. Because Goku will meet with an elder on Yardrat and that elder will tell him an important stoy that connects to what Vegeta is going through with the remnants of Freeza's empire.  The story: The battle with Freeza is over and the dead Z fighters are being wished back. Goku refuses to come back because of 'important training'. Vegeta's gets mad and leaves earth. For the rest of the z fighters everday normal life returns.   Then the story continues with a pissed off Vegeta in his space ship. He's having a classic Vegeta inner monologue about how he has to push himself to his limits. He then sets course to a remote Freeza planet. Meanwhile Goku is on Yardrat going through some unsual training and Goku is wondering what benefit it will have. Their food is also unsual but he likes it in a classic Goku style. The people on Yardrat are even amazed he can eat some stuff they find even hard to swallow. Back on earth Gohan is being harrased by his mother into studying. Krillin is trying the dating game but he has no luck. Every girl he comes across thinks he's a pervert. Tien and Chiautzu are training deep in the mountains. Yamcha is failing in life but he stops a robbery, but afterwards  Bulma is mad at him because of missing their date (the first cracks of their break up lol).  There is a powerstruggle going on in Freeza's empire. The squad next in line to the ginyu force tried to take over but a mysterious person took them out. It's freeza's brother Cooler. Cooler has always been looked down upon by freeza. He's weaker than freeza but a lot to handle for Vegeta. This is the big baddy Vegeta will have to handle during this arc. Cooler will eventually go for the dragon balls on earth and vegeta will try to stop him. And this will show how Vegeta became Super Saiyan. He will go through a rollercoaster of emotions and his past will come up. Some flashbacks will be involved. Vegeta will push himself because of Goku being better than him. Goku will learn about planet Vegeta too because of that Yardrat elder.   When Cooler is fighting Vegeta Goku will sense that and urge his trainers to hurry up with the instant transmission because his space ship is still broken. But in the end vegeta will handle everything and leave earth again.  While Vegeta is fighting on earth Coolers own ginyu force type squad will take on Piccolo, Tien, Krillin, Yamcha and Gohan. Each of them will shine in their battles. Piccolo will be his old badass self and take his opponent out himself. Tien will do the same. Krillin and Yamcha will team-up.  Gohan will be overclassed but his rage will come out and fuck people up.   Throughout other stuff will happen ofcourse. We will learn more about Freeza's empire. About Vegeta and Yardrat. It will also give us some slice of life moments on earth during a bit of peace. Launch would also make a return."

dbz,3dm7d9,Slot-T,0,Fri Jul 17 12:34:43 2015 UTC,Nappa and Raditz coming back from the dead and Vegeta tracking them down. Maybe Nappa accidentally gets brought back from one of the wishes.
dbz,3dm5nr,JohnWayneWasANazi,39,Fri Jul 17 11:44:47 2015 UTC,"Raditz. He shows up at such a pivotal point, and desperately outclasses the earth's mightiest heroes. Think of all the previous saga villains - Pilaf, Red Ribbon Army, Tien, Piccolo Daimao, Piccolo Jnr. All defeated after some trouble by Goku, alone. This time Goku had no option other than suicide via Special Beam Cannon. We see him resort to something he never would have considered, and Raditz causes the best team up of the entire series; Piccolo and Goku. At the end of Dragonball, Goku has conquered armies, aliens and madmen.  Then all of a sudden, this dude pops up, out of nowhere. He's Goku's brother, can swat away Krillin with nary a care in the world, at a point when Krillin was no joke in terms of power. Then, for the first time, Goku's family is threatened.  Raditz got Goku killed, which led to him training under King Kai. Without that boost, he wouldn't have stood a chance against Nappa, let alone Vegeta. Raditz is responsible for the characters power inflation. Bear in mind that a Saibaman is as strong as Raditz and in one year that means that Yamcha, Tien and Krillin outclassed Goku as he was pre death.  Raditz also has an awesome design(seriously, look at that hair...) and at the time he shows up he totally outclasses the Z-Fighters to an extent never before seen. For the first time we had a villain that Goku couldn't take down alone.   Tl;dr Raditz is super cool for the context of his appearance and his appearance itself."

He was Freeza before Freeza, to some degree (minus the backhanded over-politeness). He was calculating. He was devious. He took pleasure in destruction. He held grudges. He was evil just to be evil, but still had depth.  The performance of (the late and great) Takeshi Aono also added a whole lot of dimension to the character."

Sure you have generic villian themes like conquering the world or immortality or pure chaos/evil but...  Cell's goal of ""ultimate perfection"" was something else entirely.   Before the final fight scene of Gohan and Cell, Cell talks about how he thought his original purpose was merely the destruction of Goku, but he realized it was much more.   In a way, he's alot like the saiyans. Even when he reaches a power above all, he still craves for more. Like Goku, he wants to fight enemies at their max potential. It really goes with the theme in the Cell arc outlined by Goku's quote: ""There is a level beyond that of a Super Saiyan and I will rise to claim it."""

What I'm writing below is just music, so you can imagine how much deeper the rabbit hole goes.  1995: FUNimation dubs the Dragon Ball TV series with replacement music by Peter Berring.  1996: FUNimation dubs the Dragon Ball Z TV series with replacement music by Shuki Levy.  1999: FUNimation changes voice and music studios; Dragon Ball Z TV series replacement music is done by Faulconer Productions.  2001: FUNimation goes back to the original Dragon Ball TV series and keeps the original Japanese musical score by Shunsuke Kikuchi.  2004: FUNimation dubs the Dragon Ball GT TV series with replacement music by Mark Menza.  2005: FUNimation redubs the first two ""seasons"" of Dragon Ball Z as the ""Ultimate Uncut Edition"" with new replacement music by Nathan Johnson.  2007: FUNimation releases Dragon Ball Z season sets on DVD which begin to include an option for their English dub with the original Japanese musical score by Shunsuke Kikuchi.  2008: FUNimation releases Dragon Ball GT season sets on DVD which begin to include an option for their English dub with the original Japanese score by Akihito Tokunaga.  2010: FUNimation releases Dragon Ball Z Kai with its original Japanese musical score by Kenji Yamamoto.  2011: FUNimation (alongside the entire rest of the world) is forced to replace the soundtrack in Dragon Ball Z Kai with the original Dragon Ball Z musical score by Shunsuke Kikuchi.  AND THAT'S JUST FUNIMATION IN NORTH AMERICA.  Go beyond that, and you have the alternate English dubs made for the U.K. market (which also occasionally aired in Canada); their DBZ dub used recycled Mega Man cartoon music, while the DB and DBGT dubs used their original Japanese musical scores.  Over in Japan, Norihito Sumitomo (who did the Battle of Gods score) moved on to score Revival of ""F"" and the Majin Buu arc of Dragon Ball Kai.  In terms of video games, we've had scores from about half a dozen different composers once Kenji Yamamoto was let go."
dbz,3dnn3h,VegettoEX,4,Fri Jul 17 19:19:38 2015 UTC,"Dragon Ball Kai was using the Yamamoto score. However, it did eventually switch to the Kikuchi mix due to the Yamamoto scandal.

Because I actually only watched the series like 3 or so years ago (but watched a couple episodes as a kid) and I watched it with the Japanese music score. When I did that, I could see a clear continuum between Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z (like the Piccolo and Goku themes being very similar).  When I re-watched some episodes with the Faulconer music, it just seems off-putting to me, like loud and out of place."

Trunks's whole appearance and fight against Frieza was pretty good. It started kicking up consistently when Cell was revealed and Piccolo vs 17. Cell Games to the end I found it to be excellent.

I always hated when important episodes got the shitty lazy style that was almost hard to watch. The characters never looked like themselves. It's been years but all that springs to mind is when Goku met Goten for the first time, such a sweet and touching moment ruined by awful animation, which is why I've loved seeing that moment reanimated a few times over the years.

It's like they're so concerned for pacing that it eats into character behavior.   Goku has always loved sparring and tournament competitions. He's even gotten excited during fights to the death. However, every adversarial fight Goku has ever been in, he's wanted to at least know their motive, and usually attempted to get them to stop whatever they are doing and ending things in peace.   Yet in this issue, Goku has no idea what Beerus' motivations could be. He becomes aggressive toward him before Beerus can even really talk. For all Goku knows, his behavior could result in the destruction of everything.   Didn't really like the feel of that."

Beerus simply said that he was going to eventually take Freeza out because he was annoyed by how self-entitled and pretentious Freeza acted. He never mentioned or even suggested that he intended to take Freeza out due to believing that he'd become too powerful.

Also from the movie, When Trunks is taken hostage be the girl ( Maii I think ??? ) Beerus get upset thinking everyone is laughing at a child being threatened to be kill and want to correct them for showing bad manners. Vegeta had to step in and calm him by saying it just a play.  And he doesn't seem to enjoy people suffering and he is good mannered and even take part in a friendly manner to the party. It not clear why he is this way but he is certainly not evil or good.   Maybe in the anime he will be different, but am pretty sure they will keep this core aspect of him intact."

Unfortunately this is falling prey to the typical ""fanslation"" embellishment of manga just to make it seem edgier than it actually is. You'll see ""fuck"" or some other colorful language pop up quite a bit in fanslations, sometimes simply just more colorful than the intended language, and sometimes when there's no foul language to begin with.   Look at the fanslation of the Revival of F manga for example, where ""shit"" and ""fuck"" were used rather often, when in reality ""damn"" was about the most offensive word used in the original dialogue."

dbz,3dhu54,AMRAAM_Missiles,12,Thu Jul 16 12:34:34 2015 UTC,"So it appears the reason they're re-interpreting Battle Of Gods for Super is because they're going to slyly sneak in Champa & F. Whis in the background of BOG's events. Basically showing us a little bit more of what was going on behind-the-scenes.  If this is the case, I suspect Champa/F. Whis will not be playing into the main story until after the Resurrection F re-interpretation in Super. They'll be seen pulling the strings and putting finishing touches on a plan of their own. And once Resurrection F is finished then their plan will be revealed and the main crux of Super will take place.  Well then, I am perfectly ok with this if that's what's going on."

The detail that they went into Battle of Gods definitely surprised me a little bit. We're shown in Battle of Gods that Goku immediately transforms all the way up into SSJ3 before fighthing Beerus. (Clarification: To prevent confusion, Goku does transform into SSJ1, SSJ2, and SSJ3. However, he does not fight Beerus in any other forms besides SSJ3) Unlike in this chapter of the manga, we see Goku actually fighthing Beerus at SSJ, SSJ2, and obviously SSJ3.  it also appears that in Battle of Gods, Goku ends up lying down in the crater after Beerus defeats him. However, the manga shows Goku laying down in the grass.  I am quite surprised we didn't see anything regarding Kaiō speaking to Vegeta after the fight.

dbz,3dhu54,RogueAngelX,3,Thu Jul 16 14:22:08 2015 UTC,It actually makes sense. Maybe Beerus knew of the potential freiza had and that's why he was shocked to see goku hasn't reached super saiyan god because he took frieza out before he became gold frieza(haven't seen RoF and I can't remember his actual name)
dbz,3dhu54,KillTheArchitect,7,Thu Jul 16 15:41:39 2015 UTC,"Well, it's more the fact that it was a Saiya-jin that defeated Freeza, not just ""anyone"". When he was last awake, even the strongest Saiya-jin barely had battle powers outside of the low thousands, which is a far cry from even Freeza's weakest form. To hear of a Saiya-jin strong enough to beat Freeza would be shocking to say the least for someone a few decades out of the loop."

dbz,3dhu54,Tentaye,3,Thu Jul 16 21:45:32 2015 UTC,"According to the author, Akira Toriyama, at the recent showcase event, the two newest movies, Battle of Gods and Resurrection 'F', are being adapted into story arcs. Once this is finished, everyone will make their way to Spoiler!:    “Dragon Ball Super” is a complete continuation of the Majin Buu story arc. It’s got a bit of post-battle aftermath, continues with the “Battle of Gods” arc where the God of Destruction Beerus appears and the “Revival of ‘F'” arc where Freeza comes back to life, and then, I’ve written a strange new story where they finally depart from this universe. They’re fighting against their neighbors, Universe 6! They’ll yell at me if I give away too many spoilers, so I’ll keep the rest a secret, but they’re chasing after giant Super Dragon Balls; I think things will unfold in a bright and simple way, that will be really fun and exciting!  Since it’s another universe, loads of new characters will turn up. I’ll do my best to draw the tons of character designs necessary, so I’m looking forward to this too.   Battle of Gods and Resurrection 'F' are not required to enjoy Super, but since they came first, you should consider watching them if you haven't already, along with the JSAT special (which should be watched before Battle of Gods). There's also Jaco the Galactic Patrolman, which is a prequel to Dragon Ball; Jaco appears in the opening to Super."

dbz,3dhu54,xsx006,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:57:32 2015 UTC,"This answers some questions I had about how they were going to run a monthly manga and a weekly anime concurrently. It looks like the manga will cover the most important plot points; while only about one in every four episodes of the anime will be important, with the rest being filler--either that or the stuff from the manga will be stretched out over four episodes of the anime. You can sort of tell this by looking at the first five episodes of the anime, where Goku and Beerus don't get around to fighting until episode five, while in the manga they've already done their fight in the second chapter.  The fight between Goku and Beerus in this second chapter plays out almost exactly like it does in ""Battle of Gods"". I was thinking about this--while it is kind of slow and annoying for people like me who've already seen the movie several times, it serves two purposes: 1) it lets all the 9-12 year old Japanese boys (the target audience) who might not have seen the ""Battle of Gods"" movie three years ago get up to speed; and 2) it changes any details from the movie to fit into the show's new continuity (like making Beerus wake up six months after Majin Buu's defeat, rather than four years later, like the movie).  Another thing of note is how Beerus says he asked Freeza to obliterate planet Vegeta. This is another example of Beerus being inserted into the Dragon Ball mythos (see also: him trapping Elder Kai in the Z sword and shrinking King Kai's planet).  Also, note how Beerus says he asked ""the dinosaur guy with the nasty attitude"" to destroy Earth. In ""Battle of Gods"" Beerus says this a little differently--he says he is the one who destroyed all the dinosaurs on Earth. This could be an error in translation, or it could be Toyotaro changing it up, since we all know dinosaurs are still alive and well on planet Earth in Dragon Ball (I explain how that is at the bottom of my ""Battle of Gods"" post). Maybe this ""dinosaur guy"" is someone we'll meet eventually? Maybe it's a reference to King Piccolo or Babadi? Or maybe it's just an off-handed joke to a Godzilla-like kaiju that'll never be followed up on.  Beyond the ""Battle of Gods"" initial fight on King Kai's planet, the other important thing in Chapter 2 is the introduction of Champa and Missus Whis (whatever her name is). I think a lot of us had assumed the two were Beerus and Whis's counterparts from Universe 6. But, unless this is incorrectly translated, it appears they're from the other end of Universe 7. Maybe they'll be the ones responsible for opening the portal to the other universe?  Champa and Missus Whis teach us that gods are the only beings capable of sensing other gods' energy. (We learned that normals can't sense gods' energy from ""Battle of Gods""; although, once Goku transformed, he never mentioned being able to then sense Beerus and Whis. This is likely something new made up for Dragon Ball Super.)"
dbz,3dhu54,Diraga,2,Thu Jul 16 15:17:17 2015 UTC,"Well in this case the Anime is the Canon source that Akira is 100% behind. . The manga is the abridged source made by is student since Akira is now allergc to manga Ink. It almost serves as publicity in the head of manga readers.   In a sense nothing in the anime can be considers Fillers by the main definition of it.   And personally I enjoy theses slice of life and at the same time establishing what the character and their development are at since the 6 months after buu saga. Considering BoG even's are already debuting in episode 3. I think it going pretty fast. Anyway DBZ arc were always like that. Few episode of peace time than shit happens.

dbz,3dhu54,AlexDub88,-5,Fri Jul 17 01:35:23 2015 UTC,This is perfect! Why can't the anime follow this more closely instead of throwing heaps and heaps of annoying filler?
dbz,3dhu54,vlorsutes,7,Fri Jul 17 02:27:53 2015 UTC,Because the anime is one technically coming first and is Toriyama's actual story. Toyotaro's manga adaptation is just taking storyboard ideas and other concepts and going off that.
dbz,3dhu54,Hardie123123,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:52:33 2015 UTC,"I really don't think Toriyama actually writes the script from start to finish. He's credited for the original story & character design concepts, meaning that his ideas are taken and then stuffed with major filler crap.  On the other hand, the manga format (which is credited to Toriyama as well as Toyotaro) allows the story to be much more concise. It's also more consistent with the Dragon Ball manga - Gregory is missing, for instance."
dbz,3dhu54,blade55555,2,Thu Jul 16 15:13:58 2015 UTC,"However, we see a number of marked differences between the manga and the anime that are shared events (Goku's training, the planet Beerus destroys, etc) that would tend to lead to the notion that Toyotaro was the one that just got notes from Toriyama on general plot points, and went with it his own way after that.  Likewise, we saw the same thing with the Revival of F manga that Toyotaro also did in comparison to the movie, which Toriyama did write himself, so it generally seems that Toyotaro's getting the most important bullet points from Toriyama and filling in the rest himself."

They gave Master Roshi some light and he was hilarious, Krillin's girlfriend was funny to watch, and gohan's fight with chi-chi was awesome.  I loved every second of that saga"

They showed the lookout in more depth and it's one of the few times someone managed to really mess up the whole world without killing everybody. I think it was also sort of remnant of dragon ball but that could just be the relevance of the non-saiyan people. As far as weakest arc (not based off of filler because that's weak no matter what) I'd have to say a bunch of the Namekian saga because aside from seeing Vegeta in action and actually succeed and of course all the Frieza business there really isn't a lot actually happening with plot or character development. It basically seemed like showing off new aliens/ planet and some plot that, although important, wasn't necessary in the end.

dbz,3dkjqv,EmmaWinters,25,Fri Jul 17 00:46:29 2015 UTC,yeah but in that saga we got to see mr. satan bathe Majin buu which is imo the high point of the series.
dbz,3dkjqv,thatsupervillain,11,Fri Jul 17 01:17:10 2015 UTC,That spawned quite a bit of rule 34.
dbz,3dkjqv,EmmaWinters,3,Fri Jul 17 01:19:26 2015 UTC,I just love the filler part where goku and vegita are inside S.Buu  I personally don't like much the gotenks fight and Ultimate Gohan but before and after that I love it.   And that Majin Vegeta vs Goku fight. I just love it.
dbz,3dkjqv,rizefall,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:05:39 2015 UTC,I remember you having this opinion before you changed accounts. The Buu saga is actually one of my favorites because of all the new things that got shown to us. Lots of shit happened in just about two days time and i really liked it.
dbz,3dkjqv,Slot-T,13,Sat Jul 18 23:53:09 2015 UTC,"Saiyan Arc - Admittedly a little soft in the middle, what with it just being a training arc and all, but did a good job of utilizing a large portion of the characters and set the story up perfectly for the Namek arc. Love it.  Namek Arc - Drags on a little long at times, and the whole Ginyu Force period is basically just an excuse to justify the power increases the heroes are going through, but man, that ending. Goku completes the transition from little boy alone in the woods to strongest warrior and hero of the universe. Love it.  Cell Arc - Other characters doing stuff! This is the arc where the old Dragonball Gang characters officially became irrelevant, but man, at different points in time Vegeta, Piccolo, Trunks, Goku and Gohan were the strongest fighter. Awesome villains, building off an old foe. Goku, having fully completed his arc, passes the torch to his son, who has finally grown into the next hero of the world. Love it.  Buu Arc - Ok...well it doesn't build off any other arcs, so that's not good. And it introduces a bunch of new Saiyans at the expense of Piccolo any anyone else who might hope to contribute to this effort, but it actually starts off pretty well. Goten, Trunks, and Gohan are getting ready to be the next heroes of the universe, they're facing an enemy even the Supreme Kai is petrified of, Goku and Vegeta are passing on to the next life, and then...oh boy. They straight hose Gohan and Gotenks so Goku and Vegeta can come back to life and save the day...again, relegating the next generation to lives as measuring sticks for the villains. Buu was a confusing villain to follow and was pretty lame at the beginning, being all fat and stupid. It just kinda...fell flat for me.  So it's gotta be the Buu Arc. It wasn't all bad, there were parts I really liked, like Vegeta finishing his character arc, but it honestly felt like at the last possible moment AT got cold feet about passing the torch onto the next generation of heroes and just decided to bring Goku and Vegeta back from the dead (which, prior to this arc, wasn't even possible in the way they did it). It's clearly the weakest of the four."
dbz,3dkjqv,sean151,4,Fri Jul 17 01:20:24 2015 UTC,"I get that not a lot of people like the Buu arc as much as every other arc, but when I think back about the arc all I can remember are things like Vegeta's atonement, the reveal of ssj3 to Buu and the phenomenal theme for it, ""Fight you? No. I want to kill you."", Majin Vegeta brutally beating Goku, Goku meeting Goten for the first time, Vegeta's respect for Goku, ""This is for you! Majin Buu!"" etc. Maybe it's just rose colored glasses IDK."
dbz,3dkjqv,Slot-T,2,Fri Jul 17 03:06:10 2015 UTC,"I totally agree that all that was awesome, but the latest thing you mentioned was Gohan's fight with Buu, which happened just before they went off the rails and ditched the new generation for the old one in a fight against a weakened Buu and Goku as the hero again. Like I said, it started pretty well aside from Fat Buu sucking and had some really cool parts, but it just went to pieces right there at the end for me."
dbz,3dkjqv,Lord_of_Bored212,-1,Fri Jul 17 03:32:12 2015 UTC,"Are you implying Vegito is not awesome? I get people get dissapointed whenever Dragonball turns into Goku time, but Dragonball is Goku's story when you get down to it, he's gonna be the main character. As for Toriyama possibly getting cold feet about passing the torch to a new generation, maybe it has something to do with how when he tried that at the end of Cell everyone screamed ""no we want Goku back"""
dbz,3dkjqv,Slot-T,3,Fri Jul 17 04:37:23 2015 UTC,"Vegito was cool, I just felt he was unnecessary. I mean he was only around for a few episodes, and only existed because Buu got cocky, Gohan couldn't catch all of a sudden, and Tien was unconscious. And Goku certainly is the main character, but he'd been the main character forever, there's nothing left for him to do. If you like the Buu arc that's fine, but to me it really just felt like lazy storytelling with the way it ended."
dbz,3dkjqv,blade55555,7,Fri Jul 17 10:56:46 2015 UTC,"In my opinion Buu saga.  Starts off really interesting and than once the fusions kick in it goes Buu's winning, gotenks is winning, Buu is winning, Gohan is winning, Buu is winning, Vegito is winning.  Just never ending, that was a little too dragged out imo."
dbz,3dkjqv,mozillavulpix,3,Fri Jul 17 02:17:44 2015 UTC,"I was disappointed a little by Gotenks fight. If my memories is correct, so much build up only to see Gotenks getting beat up. But when Vegata and Goku goes back in action, men I just love everything."
dbz,3dkjqv,OhUmHmm,7,Fri Jul 17 02:26:03 2015 UTC,"I'd say Majin Buu. It was just a bunch of missed opportunities and failures. It's incredibly long but there's only one villain to defeat. There wasn't enough variety.  And when you compare it to other arcs, there weren't many consequences or changes to the characters. No one died for good, and a lot of characters were completely static.  Not to mention, it's the only time where Toriyama decided to contradict everything he had been saying at the end of the previous arc."
dbz,3dkjqv,Lord_of_Bored212,2,Fri Jul 17 02:22:39 2015 UTC,"I'd agree completely with this.  I mean there were a handful of interesting points like some minor Vegeta character growth, and Buu's backstory (vaguely recall).  But while Freeza represented organized evil (a whole team of henchmen more powerful than most of the characters) and Cell represented the perfect combination of the fighters (able to use their moves, etc) that was also able to regenerate, Buu was just like a big blob that was hard to damage.  They'd fought similar creatures in the past (Tree of Might movie and the original Dragon ball, if I recall), where the solution was basically ""feed it SO MUCH energy it explodes"".    Makes sense that Toriyama wanted to end DBZ with Cell, I think he was kind of running low on innovative ideas and the power scale had started getting out of control."
dbz,3dkjqv,OhUmHmm,3,Fri Jul 17 03:10:44 2015 UTC,"He also wanted to end Dragonball after the first hunt for the dragonballs, and then again after it had run for a year. I say this only because when critiquing the Buu arc people love to say ""Toriyama wanted to end after Cell but kept going cause there was demand, that's why it sucks"" when in reality there have been like 8 trillion theoretical stopping points for Dragonball"
dbz,3dkjqv,Lord_of_Bored212,2,Fri Jul 17 04:44:11 2015 UTC,That's a good point I hadn't heard before.  I had heard previously that DBZ was supposed to be a story of Goku handing the reins of Earth's protection to the next generation (specifically Gohan) making Cell saga a natural stopping point but I'm not sure if that was also retroactively decided.
dbz,3dkjqv,OhUmHmm,0,Fri Jul 17 04:48:01 2015 UTC,"I mean he was clearly building up the Gohan has crazy potential thing from the start of DBZ and he probably did plan to end it after Cell. But again, he wanted to end it after the original hunt for the dragonballs but no one says that the training with Roshi or first tournament suck despite that they were huge tonal shifts in the show as well."
dbz,3dkjqv,Lord_of_Bored212,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:54:01 2015 UTC,"I'm glad he didn't!  Thanks for the context though.  Now that you mention it, I can see the big tonal shift after the first dragonball hunt, it sort of shifted away from its ""Journey to the West"" roots.  Now that I think about it, I don't think there was a single important animal humanoid (like Puar) introduced after that?  I think some of the Tournament fighters were still non-humanoid, but it really did take a shift now that you mention it."
dbz,3dkjqv,OhUmHmm,2,Fri Jul 17 05:03:39 2015 UTC,On YouTube there's a guy called MistareFusion who does a giant Dragonball dissection of the series. He's on the Saiyan saga now and it's really interesting seeing some of the stuff about Toriyama as he was writing (he'll cite interviews from Toriyama showing his thought process during the writing of certain parts).

dbz,3dkjqv,KronusX7,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:47:47 2015 UTC,It would be the main big flaw imo to DBZ andI hope to see it gone in Super. Almost everybody is useless. And most of the time they serve as supporting characters or punching bags until Goku arrives or can do something about it.
dbz,3dkjqv,shabaIabadingdong,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:53:13 2015 UTC,"That's not just a flaw of DBZ, that's a flaw of Dragonball in general. New character will be introduced, get the limelight for that arc at most, then be pushed into the background at Kame House for the remainder of the show in favor of new characters. Outside Goku, Vegeta, and Piccolo it's like Toriyama just gets bored of characters after awhile and wants new ones to play with"
dbz,3dkjqv,pewqokrsf,3,Fri Jul 17 04:39:52 2015 UTC,"I think a big reason the Buu arc seems weak is Buu himself, and by that I mean they main antagonist, Buu  He's all over the place. Frieza and Cell have a goal and a set personality. While buu seems to change both of those constantly.  He goes from a big goof wanting to just mess around, to a purple old looking Buu whose only trait seems to be he's evil, to a cocky, stubborn, short tempered, almost Cell and Frieza-like Super Buu who just seems to want to fight and get stronger, to a chaotic insane Kid Buu who just wants to destroy everything  Buu has no set goal and no set character, this drastically brings down the arc  To put it all into perspective. I have seen countless people ask ""who's stronger or more evil, Super Buu or Kid Buu??"", but really think about that question. That's like saying whose stronger, Goku or a Goku at a different point in the series. Even in the case of asking for the Buu's respective power levels in comparison to each other, people don't debate over SSJ and SSJ 2 Goku's power levels or. And if you suggest that their drastic differences require a debate then look at Metal Frieza and True form Frieza, even in those debates Metal and True are both referred to as the same character, as in ""when Frieza was Metal after True"", but people refer to Kid and Super as separate entities in most cases. Kid Buu and Super Buu are the same character just in different circumstances though. People wouldn't ask for the difference between Goku and Goku, but since Buu is just so all over the place it legit makes the Buus seem like different characters when in reality Evil/Super/and Kid Buu are the same character just at different points in time. That's how you know you have a villain that just has no real focus. Resulting in just a jumbled mess for an arc villain wise"

dbz,3dkjqv,pewqokrsf,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:28:34 2015 UTC,Well I really did point out the weakest moments for but it hard for me to pick. I guess I would have to go with the sayain saga.

dbz,3dkjqv,Smallfrym,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:49:10 2015 UTC,"I thought the Saiyan Saga was the weakest.  It started off pretty well, but got extremely repetitive towards the end."
dbz,3dkjqv,Iliketo_mass_debate,2,Fri Jul 17 01:08:07 2015 UTC,Hm do you see the same repetitiveness in the Buu saga as well I imagine?  Just curious as I felt the Buu saga was really repetitive especially when the fusions came into play.
dbz,3dkjqv,ur_mum23,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:18:23 2015 UTC,"Actually not as much.  It definitely did do some repetitive things, but there was also always something new.  The Saiyan Saga didn't really introduce new elements.  It just seemed to give Vegeta as many hit points as he needed for Goku to show off everything that King Kai taught him."
dbz,3dkjqv,BlackCatScott,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:07:15 2015 UTC,"After reading Cell and Android and seeing all the cool exciting attacks and fights, I find Saiyan and Namek Saga underwhelming when I go back to them. They turn weak to me because they get overshadowed by cooler stuff."
dbz,3dkjqv,JonWood007,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:53:50 2015 UTC,"Buu saga gave me the most feels, like majijn vegeta talking to Goku about pride. When Gohan 'dies', and Vegeta realises, and apologises, that was incredible. But then like an episode later he atones for his sins and spoiler, and gohan getting that thing from elder kai, and then opening a can of whoopass on Buu, and then another spoiler, the list goes on.  The extent of transformations were a bit annoying, but they were fun to watch.  The weakest saga, in my opinion, was buu saga, because it just kept going on about passing the torch and then turned back on itself, and that sort of thing. For example, he built up the story, and then changed his mind. Also I felt that for a god, supreme kai was rather incompetent."

dbz,3dkjqv,anonpurpose,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:55:51 2015 UTC,"A few of the weaker ones in my opinion.  1) saiyan saga, not bad, but very drawn out and boring. Takes like 20 episodes of filler to get to the good stuff. Some episodes totally irrelevant to the plot, like gohan being trapped with that machine in an ancient temple or whatever. Represents an awkward transition from db to Dbz.  2) garlic Jr saga just felt out of place in general. Very disappointing following the enamel saga, would be been a better fit in db or pre saiyan saga.  3) buu saga was too long and didn't have the best plot. The character flaws were just too exaggerated to make it enjoyable. Between goten and trunks acting immature in fighting buu, dragging the fight out, and vegetas persistent loose cannon overconfident attitude, it made the z fighters look totally incompetent. It almost devolved into the self parody I would expect from abridged."

dbz,3dkjqv,AzoGalvat,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:37:06 2015 UTC,Garlic Jr and Buu sagas were the worst out of them all.
dbz,3dkjqv,TheGoldenSSTicket,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:33:52 2015 UTC,"I think that Toriyama started running dry on ideas around the time Buu Saga started, and it did suffer for it. Frieza Saga seemed like it was supposed to be the end at one point, but Cell was a nice capstone, with Gohan taking the mantle of Earth's protector from his father. Toriyama was building up to that anyway, it seemed. Really, the only bit of Buu Saga that seemed to tie in to the other sagas well was Vegeta being super jealous of Goku and Gohan, seeing a low-class warrior and his half-breed kid constantly outdo him.  It has been a while since I watched it, but big pink manchild seemed kinda weak compared to Dr. Gero's ultimate creation and the evil overlord basically responsible for Dragonball even happening."
dbz,3dkjqv,Zcherub,3,Fri Jul 17 00:50:05 2015 UTC,"I think the reason why Buu seemed so hard is because he could regenerate to be honest. The other villains actually felt more evil in comparison to Buu who just kind of killed for fun to a point, and then was trying to be the strongest in the universe. I didn't really care for how his motives kept changing, but I suppose that could be defended by saying that his personality changed after he absorbed people.   Personally, when reflecting on the series, the Saiyan saga felt really... lacking? That could be because it was the start of the series and there wasn't much direction, but I felt like it wasn't nearly as much of a struggle as the other sagas. I guess it did introduce Vegeta, so that was important obviously, but other than that, I didn't really think it was that great."
dbz,3dkjqv,BrianDawkins,2,Fri Jul 17 02:18:01 2015 UTC,"You could say that Saiyan Saga was DBZ transitioning from the old Dragonball style into DBZ as we know it, and that saga had the growing pains associated with the transition."
dbz,3dkjqv,AbelTaylor,2,Fri Jul 17 02:26:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess you can't be too harsh on it. It definitely was setting up a lot of the plot though compared to the other sagas. I don't find any of them bad though, they all had their charms and interesting points. I just really liked the Cell and Frieza sagas the most.  If we are speaking on terms of Abridged, then Saiyan trumps all. Nappa has to be like the literal best character in that whole series."

He's able to do some genuinely funny moments and create some endearing characters, while also doing some pretty dark and depressing material in the same story (so we'd see a darker take on DB without abandoning the humor). It would be interesting to see the story done in a way where everything is planned out rather than made up as it goes along (Tokyo Ghoul is planned out very well, and is packed with foreshadowing)."

dbz,3djawf,pabosaki,14,Thu Jul 16 18:54:49 2015 UTC,"No, he's nowhere near the level of General Blue, or arguably any of the more powerful humans to appear in Dragon Ball. Him taking those blows from Trunks, Cell, and Buu were clearly just gag-related and weren't indicative of his real strength.  Toriyama's established him as being strong by real-world terms, but still weaker than some of the stronger individuals that exist in the real world (He stated in Dragon Ball forever that Mr. Satan was weaker than the MMA fighter Bob Sapp)."
dbz,3djawf,vlorsutes,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:02:50 2015 UTC,"but he did win a world martial arts tournament on his own, so i would imagine he  would at least be able to somewhat keep up with kid goku in a fight"
dbz,3djawf,ATDghost,3,Thu Jul 16 19:17:46 2015 UTC,No way he could keep up with Kid Goku. He only won that one tournament because none of the Z-fighters participated in it since it took place during the time on Namek if I am not mistaken. Kid Goku had only lost in the finals of the tournaments prior to Jackie Chun (Master Roshi) and Tien Shinhan and both fights were pretty close. He probably could keep up with desert bandit Yamcha if anyone.
dbz,3djawf,xSloke,2,Thu Jul 16 19:28:09 2015 UTC,"Just because he won a Budoukai on his own doesn't mean that the caliber of fighters he faced off against were anywhere near the caliber that Goku and the others dealt with during the three Budoukai in Dragon Ball.   Take into account that the real Mighty Mask, Punter, Jewel, Killer, and Spopovitch (before being placed under the Ma-jin spell) were all in the actual Budoukai matches alongside Mr. Satan during the one that he won, and, while strong for humans, they were still just ordinary humans."
dbz,3djawf,vlorsutes,2,Thu Jul 16 19:36:55 2015 UTC,"But he won the tournaments that nobody from the main DB cast participated in, making him stronger than a bunch of 'regular' people (ie humans who haven't trained under Roshi/Crane Hermit/Kami/King Kai.)  You know, those guys who the main cast easily and effortlessly toss out of the ring in the preliminaries by giving them a light tap.  I'd say he's at or below Roshi's strength, probably below since Roshi was still able to beat Kid Goku in an earlier tournament.  It's a shame scouters were obselete by the time he appeared in the series; we'd have a relative idea of his strength if somebody ran a scouter on him."
dbz,3djawf,MHzBurglar,2,Thu Jul 16 19:34:47 2015 UTC,"King Choppa had won multiple (I think it was 3) tournaments without ever being hit prior to running into Kid Goku. Goku beat him instantly. MAYBE Hercule is King Choppa strong, but he's not in the league of even the earliest versions of the Z Fighters."
dbz,3djawf,Slot-T,2,Thu Jul 16 20:05:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that seems like a good area to place Mr. Satan.  I forgot about King Choppa..."
dbz,3djawf,MHzBurglar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:13:34 2015 UTC,"In the manga, King Chappa isn't even specified as winning a World Martial Arts Tournament - just a tournament.  The King Piccolo Saga's anime adaption makes it known that he won the 20th World Martial Arts Tournament.  Considering Satan legitimately won the 24th World Tournament, I'd say Chappa is definitely a great comparison (especially with the afro and moustache!).  I think this would probably be the same range of around Ranfan, Nam, Giran, and Bacterian as well.    Honestly, I think it's fair to place Satan somewhere in the 10 - 90 power level range, and that's being very generous.  We know Goku's first Oozaru transformation was 100, Master Shen was at 120, and Chi-Chi was apparently at a power level of 130 during the 23rd World Tournament.    We also know Satan got rekt and his master was killed by Tao Pai Pai around Dragon Ball, or Pre-Dragon Ball.  We also know that Tao Pai Pai and Shen had a rivalry.  Shen's power level of 120 makes it likely that Satan never broke the 100 threshold.  It's also made clear that Satan has incredible luck, and has won by default through not only skill, but fortunate circumstances.  Even if we say he was 10x stronger than DBZ's Farmer, that still puts him at a Power Level of 50."
dbz,3djawf,mmmasian,0,Sat Jul 18 09:08:19 2015 UTC,"I think you may still be exaggerating, or at least we're hitting the ""power levels are crap"" thing. At a 10, Kid Goku was able to repel bullets without trying from Bulma's pistol, but Mr. Satan still goes after Buu with a pistol. Knowing that, I wouldn't put him anywhere above that. If the farmer was a 5, maybe he's a 9 or so, so effectively the raw strength of 2 men. That's not bad, but it shouldn't be world-class strong.   The easy answer there is that Kid Goku was a lot higher than a 10 and that power level is just wrong. If we call him more like a 50, there's a lot more room for Mr. Satan to be a 30 or 40, which seems more realistic. I also have no idea how Chi Chi gets listed as a 130, but whatever.  Edit: I've never read the first part of that interview before. What the heck, AT? If Mr. Satan's so scared of super strong people, why did he show up to the Cell Games in the first place? He would've already been faking an illness, not waiting til he got slapped into a mountain."
dbz,3djawf,Slot-T,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:43:07 2015 UTC,"To be fair, we've never seen Satan get hit by a bullet. ;)   But I totally understand where you're coming from, which is why I listed the beginning of the range in the 10 area.  9 definitely makes sense, but Satan's winning of the 24th World Martial Arts Tournament makes me think that he might definitely be more of a 30 or 40.  I can't imagine the kind of contestants that showed up for the other World Tournaments all simultaneously just saying ""forget it"" on the year that Satan won - but who knows, he's incredibly lucky after all."
dbz,3djawf,mmmasian,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:49:12 2015 UTC,"To be fair, we've never seen Satan get hit by a bullet. ;)   He gets shot by the bandits shortly before Buu splits in two."

We also know Satan got rekt and his master was killed by Tao Pai Pai around Dragon Ball, or Pre-Dragon Ball.  We also know that Tao Pai Pai and Shen had a rivalry.

dbz,3djd2k,Carnanian,25,Thu Jul 16 19:10:22 2015 UTC,"No, you're right. Goku sounds like a hick when he speaks since he grew up in the mountains away from developed civilization. Chi Chi is the same way. The subtitles on the FUNimation DVDs have always reflected this, but the manga by Viz normalizes his speech most of the time."
dbz,3djd2k,TyroKith,10,Thu Jul 16 20:15:07 2015 UTC,"I had totally forgot about the whole fact that he grew up with his grandpa in the mountains before DB, so it does make a bit more sense now!

dbz,3djd2k,TheGoldenSSTicket,4,Thu Jul 16 20:30:40 2015 UTC,Keep in mind that he never had formal schooling either. They definitely highlight this a lot more in the sub rather than the dub.
dbz,3djd2k,DubZer0,6,Fri Jul 17 01:58:52 2015 UTC,He was however taught by Roshi in DB and it seemed like Roshi was serious slit their education.
dbz,3djd2k,havebananas,2,Fri Jul 17 08:39:46 2015 UTC,I always thought in the English dub he has a pretty large vocabulary for someone who pretty much raised himself on his own. He's never shown reading or studying anything.

dbz,3djd2k,EmmaWinters,14,Thu Jul 16 21:14:30 2015 UTC,"Yes.   In VIZ's localization, his lips are changed, and he speaks articulately. In the Ocean/FUNimation dub, he speaks articulately. In the Kai dub, he speaks articulately. In the Toonzai TV broadcast, he's blue, and since they broadcast the Kai dub, he speaks articulately.   All of this was done to avoid cries of racism."
dbz,3djd2k,NuwandaTheDruid,3,Thu Jul 16 23:33:34 2015 UTC,Doesn't Mr Popo's design come from the same aspect of Japanese fashion that Jinx's design comes from?

dbz,3dkic8,Nachorl250,4,Fri Jul 17 00:29:28 2015 UTC,"Don't think of the energy required to fill the gauge as an actual indicator of his battle power, so much as just the amount of power it takes to revive him from hibernation. The situation is like a car needing a jump start because the battery is dead. You're not needing the full electricity the battery could put out in order to jump start it, just enough of a charge to get the car going.  With Buu, it's the same thing. He's just needing enough ki to jump start him from his hibernation, not the full extent of his ki."
dbz,3dkic8,vlorsutes,3,Fri Jul 17 00:40:34 2015 UTC,"The reason Super Saiyan 2/3's mutipliers are commonly accepted is because they're found in the Super Exciting Guide: Story Volume:   On p.62-63, it says that Super Saiyan 2 is twice as strong as regular Super Saiyan, and that Super Saiyan 3 is four times as strong as Super Saiyan 2. It also repeats Daizenshuu 7′s statement about regular Super Saiyan increasing the battle power by a factor of 50. Somewhat interestingly, the comment on regular Super Saiyan is the only one that uses the term “battle power”, while for 2 and 3 it simply says “strength”. This may be to go along with Daizenshuu 7′s statement that the increase in the character’s strength past the battle with Freeza cannot be measured in battle powers."
dbz,3dkic8,EmmaWinters,2,Fri Jul 17 00:34:03 2015 UTC,"Goku was pulling his punches against Fat Boo, and later admits he could have beaten him if he'd wanted to. That considered, Fat Boo could very well be about half of SS3 Goku's full power. I think it makes a lot of sense, and I like to use the power meter as an indication of these strength comparisons too."
dbz,3dkic8,KaboomKrusader,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:53:57 2015 UTC,"The Super Saiyan 3 form also burns off energy very quickly, so he wouldn't be able to maintain that power for long at all. On top of that his opponent was Buu, whose regeneration and stamina are ridiculously high. Goku was also supposedly holding back a bit to give Goten and Trunks a shot at defeating Buu.   Also Buu's power is probably much greater than what was used to wake him from his hibernation."

He only expelled an evil version of himself that turned him into a candy and ate him. That's the real problem. All it takes is for him to lose is crap and he can literally be consumed by his dark side.
dbz,3di6tr,TorrentOfRelish,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:38:10 2015 UTC,"Interesting point. I mean it would happen either way because story but honestly I feel like Supreme Kai and Kabuto would be able to pull some Kai magic to do something about it or Bulma can ""science"" it or Dende. But as far as what we know he would probably still become evil Buu again. Although if evil Buu was expelled around the Z fighters it wouldn't be as much of a problem."
dbz,3di6tr,JonWood007,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:02:42 2015 UTC,"The point I'm trying to get at is it's hard to know that this would happen with buu until it does.

dbz,3di6tr,Itzie4,6,Fri Jul 17 19:02:15 2015 UTC,"umm, dude... Supreme Kai didn't know the extent of Buu's gentle side.   Absorbing personalities made him easier to manipulate and calmed him down a little from the Kid Buu persona, but that doesn't automatically mean 'good guy.'"
dbz,3di6tr,jnogueras,5,Thu Jul 16 19:02:11 2015 UTC,"I think my biggest gripe is the whole Kai system. Like, why didn't Supreme Kai ask King Kai, ""hey, you watch over this part of the universe, any strong guys? I have a bit of a problem"". What's the point of all the Kai's? Hell, what's the point of the Grand Kai (don't remember if he's even canon, don't kill me...). It bothers me a bit.  Now back to the other issue. SK knew Buu as the evil Kid Buu. That's how he met him. So that's how he always portrayed him.  Letting them take Gohans power was dumb. I mean he knew how Buu was revived. He saw how strong Gohan was (even though he was weaker than his Cell days), and still! Still let them take his power back. Sure, he needed to find Babidi, but he could've captured Spopovitch (spelling?), and sent the other dude back saying ""tell your master blah"" and followed him there without him knowing.  But...plot."

Kibito was surprised when Gohan asked if he wanted him to go SSJ2 so it's safe to say neither he nor Supreme Kai knew about it. He probably saw SSJ1 levels being stolen as an acceptable risk for finding Babidi's ship (keeping in mind they had already looked for it themselves across the whole planet).   Even then though, the plan was on track until Vegeta and Goku derailed the mission for a chance to brawl it out with each other."
dbz,3di6tr,GuntherTime,3,Fri Jul 17 10:48:59 2015 UTC,"While it makes a lot of sense you're a little wrong.

dbz,3dhj4y,Ginix,5,Thu Jul 16 16:44:12 2015 UTC,DB is also my favourite. I just think I like the fact that it's still relatively grounded and it feels a lot more fun than DBZ.
dbz,3dhj4y,Atwenfor,4,Thu Jul 16 14:09:44 2015 UTC,DB had more adventurous fights and clever techniques while DBZ is more about who is the first to go over 9000 and make the biggest ki ball.
dbz,3dhj4y,TorrentOfRelish,3,Thu Jul 16 16:47:52 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It showed Goku as a somewhat good thinker and able to come up with creative ways of getting out of sticky (see merry-go-round-gum) situations even though some of it was cheesy and childlike it kept things interesting. Goku used his tail as a propeller, come on. But it made things unique as opposed to basically the same attack with different hand movements and fighting that is just basically the same thing over and over. It was nice thinking that there was Kami as the sole guardian of the earth, that there wasn't always just some way there'll be a stronger bad guy for no reason, that Goku was actually learning, and of course there were original characters that weren't obsolete in a season."

dbz,3diwl5,Ryuuzoji,3,Thu Jul 16 17:12:06 2015 UTC,"Given that it would be most likely that they're looking for the Dragon Balls at the earliest moment they could to undo the wish of becoming young, it seems most likely that the wish was made a year before Battle of Gods. There's four years between the final battle with Buu and the events of Battle of Gods, which would give them more than enough time to have found them and used them.  May Age 774 - Buu is defeated  November Age 774 - Wish is granted to wipe the memories of Earth's population of Ma-jin Buu  November Age 775 - Dragon Balls would be reactivated  Age 778 - Events of Battle of Gods  As such, you have a little over two years between when the Dragon Balls become useable again and the start of Age 778."
dbz,3diwl5,vlorsutes,2,Thu Jul 16 17:32:40 2015 UTC,"Well in the BoG movie, it takes place 5 years after Buu.  So Pilaf and co. had plenty of time to use them.  However, it seems that the events of BoG in Dragon Ball Super will take place sooner, so no telling how they will fit that in without plot holes.  But as DB fans, we are kind of used to plot holes."
dbz,3diwl5,getting_excited,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:17:34 2015 UTC,How can it take place 5 years later? Goten and Trunks would have aged considerably in that time period?
dbz,3diwl5,getting_excited,3,Thu Jul 16 17:22:00 2015 UTC,"Well, it does take place at least 5 years after Buu, regardless of what Goten & Trunks looked like.  They drew them like that, its fiction.  I've heard theories that include something along the lines of: ""Gohan didn't really grow much until he went into the room of spirit and time.""  I read that awhile ago somewhere in this subreddit, at least something along those lines.  It doesn't imply that the Room of Spirit and Time causes someone to grow, more so that Gohan didn't show to grow much from Namek to the Android sagas.  So maybe late growth spurts.  Either way, you have to remember that its fiction.  The movie was made with the idea of bringing back old feelings of DB and DBZ to give fans something to recognize.  Goten and Trunks were known as children so they kept them as children.  Hope to see them grown in DBS though!"
dbz,3diwl5,TorrentOfRelish,3,Thu Jul 16 17:31:13 2015 UTC,"Also in Dragon Ball Goku didn't really grow with age too much until you saw him as teen Goku at the tournament and the Gohan thing.

Videl, I'm really sorry for you, and I'ma let you finish, but Major Metallitron had one of the worst beat downs of all time! Let's take out the fact that he was an android, Goku absolutely destroyed him. He beat him down, blew up his arm, punched a hole through his chest, and Kamehameha'd his head off, and Metallitron kept coming. Balls of steel on this one.

Mystery!  Edit:  I think I figured it out.  It looks like it could be Sonny Strait, the voice actor of Krillin and Bardock.  Reference 1 - If you look at the last name, it has the sloppy ""S"" into a lazy squiggle with a dot over it, same as yours.  Reference 2 - The first name bears the same look as yours, almost looking like it says ""Sny"" or ""Shy,"" similar to this.  Reference 3 - This is the closest resemblance.

This would appear to be an autograph done by Sonny Strait. He is the voice of Krillin, Bardock, and several other roles in the series.  There appears to be several signature styles that Sonny has done. Notably the one that you have done is very similar to this signature done for a fan. There are also signatures around where he has written out his full name ""Sonny Strait"". Here is an example of that as well.  Below are some other signatures that he has done, but this seems to be pretty consistent with the recent ones that i could find over online.    [1] [2]  [3] [4]   Definitely a pretty signature. At least in my opinion it is.  ~~  Looks like others have confirmed this. You should consider hitting him up over on Twitter. You may be able to find out when he did this signature. Because over time, his signatures have became shorter and shorter. Some signatures he has fully written out his name, while some of his signatures it looks like he abbreviates his first name to ""Sny""."

dbz,3dgzla,CcaseyC,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:12:26 2015 UTC,Somewhat related question:  Is the reason Trunks was able to slice Frieza with a sword due to him infusing it with his ki? I know in the movies it has a mystical origin but that isn't canon and was made after the Trunks Saga aired.   Then again Yajirobe fucked up Vegeta with his sword even though he's nowhere near Vegeta's strength so that complicated things. Is his sword special in some way? Haven't seen all of Dragonball.
dbz,3dgzla,InfinitySnatch,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:26:30 2015 UTC,"With yajirobe I think it's just because he's an excellent swordsman. in dragon ball he was able to fight at the same level as kid goku and even killed one of king piccolo's mutated namekians (which were stronger than Krillin). And in the 23rd(I think) martial arts tournaments he almost qualified only losing to hero(kami), yamcha also lost to kami so yajirobe could've been as strong as tien(based on how he was able to fight at Goku's level and Goku's match against tien was basically even) or yamcha."

Maybe Saiyans just hack a nack for picking up techniques/abilities easily after understanding how to do it. Goten learned to fly after just one day. Really just a combination of plot device, and Saiyan ability in my mind."
dbz,3die9y,pabosaki,8,Thu Jul 16 15:36:57 2015 UTC,"It's explained by the same thing that every power increase in the series not by plot device is: They trained a lot and got there eventually on their own.   It can also be assumed that everyone either figured out or assumed that Gohan hitting SSJ2 first was due to his massive amount of latent power. So the other Saiyans could hit it eventually, it'd just take longer to achieve the raw power necessary to do so."
dbz,3die9y,DavenIchinumi,5,Thu Jul 16 15:02:38 2015 UTC,Vegeta and Goku were already half way there. But they couldn't figure out how to keep their muscle mass from growing while transforming beyond Super Saiyan. They figured it out after the Cell saga after some more training.

dbz,3die9y,ChuckBronze,3,Thu Jul 16 15:47:22 2015 UTC,"There was a  7 year gap. Not like it happened overnight.  Besides, their watching Gohan balance his power/speed to hit SSJ2 and feeling his ki when that happened might have given them something to target & help them learn to do that with their own ki (just a fan theory, but we've seen Goku effortlessly master techniques he sees others do enough - especially in DB)."
dbz,3die9y,Zcherub,2,Thu Jul 16 16:52:19 2015 UTC,"Because DBZ is full of plot hole and Akira is not the kind to keep track of theses things when he write, he just think of making things interesting. He even said not to think too hard about theses things.   But in a logical sense they did have 7years to train. Also Gohan never tap his full power because of is lack of confidence and is nature to not like to fight. He is not a fighter, he fight only when he is forced to. So when he snap and got powerful because at this moment he stop holding back and trusted himself.  So would say once you unlock SS1 that those other levels are being reach with a certain amount of base level being reached and their own personal flaw is actually slowing down their base level. As for Gotenks and Trunks, since their dad at the point they made them have already unlocked it. It would say that it was written in their DNA as ''unlock'' and made it a natural gift for them."
dbz,3die9y,Mi4_Slayer,3,Thu Jul 16 23:36:51 2015 UTC,"Similar to Gohan going SSJ2, It took Krillin dying for Goku to become a SSJ, but afterwards everyone just kinda gains the ability. Goku and Vegeta learning SSJ2 isn't surprising as they trained for 7 years.  Goku reaching SSJ3 can be chalked up to his training being done in other world where he doesn't have as much strain on the body and where training can be done much more effectively. Also, he had 7 years which is a long time"

I suppose that maybe you can get to the next level by training hard enough, it just isn't easy? maybe goku got to the next two by that, but an event that triggers utter rage really helps? this 'theory' does support the reasons behind goku getting to ssj2 and 3, and also for vegeta going to ssj2, since he was strong enough to go over the 'upper limit', shall we say, of ssj1 power, meaning that he was too strong not to go into ssj2, and that this is the same as goku."
dbz,3die9y,mozillavulpix,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:06:55 2015 UTC,"It's as if Vegeta just appeared one time and went Super Sayain randomly, no one says anything at all, Vegeta doesn't explain anything and we all just accept it.   The funny thing is, that IS sort of what happened. Vegeta didn't give a very detailed explanation of how he went Super Saiyan.  Besides Goku going SSJ and Gohan going SSJ2, we never get explanations as to how they manage to transform. Ever. Just think about it."
dbz,3die9y,Breditor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:31:42 2015 UTC,"This is how I believe it happens. SSJ 1 is a reaction from an emotionally devastating event, and SSJ 2 + 3 are just obtained through power after achieving SSJ 1"
dbz,3die9y,KidBuu55,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:39:45 2015 UTC,I'm not sure I understand the question.
dbz,3die9y,GuntherTime,0,Fri Jul 17 20:02:25 2015 UTC,"They show how Vegita became a super sayin. It's very similar to how Gohan became one instead Vegita felt weak. He couldn't beat Goku, then couldn't beat Frezia while Goku did, also managing to become a super sayin and there he was the prince of all sayins being outclassed by a low level. Anger took over and he became a super sayin."
dbz,3dg3rw,TheFallen837,17,Thu Jul 16 00:18:14 2015 UTC,"Goku wouldn't have hit him that way if he thought it would kill him. His intentions were to allow the Ginyu Tokusentai to leave with their lives, which is why he was upset with Vegeta when he killed them all."
dbz,3dg3rw,EmmaWinters,6,Thu Jul 16 00:20:04 2015 UTC,"He may not be intending to kill Recoome, but I doubt Goku may know about internal bleeding. He might just think that punching Recoome the hardest he could would knock him out and that's it."
dbz,3dg3rw,RedSwnglneStplr,11,Thu Jul 16 03:00:50 2015 UTC,I like to think the most gifted martial artist on Earth who has been trained by multiple legends has at some point been educated on the cause and effect of internal bleeding.

dbz,3dg3rw,applepwnz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:17:43 2015 UTC,We have seen countless brutal punches and kicks that seriously damage people.   How many people have died from internal bleeding in the series? Zero.
dbz,3dg3rw,linknyte,7,Thu Jul 16 18:25:02 2015 UTC,"Despite his human-like appearance, Recoome is an alien, so we don't really know anything about his internal biology and  what would have caused internal bleeding in his race, so the question is unanswerable."
dbz,3dg3rw,TLO_Is_Overrated,5,Thu Jul 16 12:34:30 2015 UTC,"Blunt force trauma to the epigastric/upper abdominal/thoracic region such as the blow that Goku landed on Recoome can result in internal organ damage to the liver, spleen, pancreas, and even rupture the abdominal aorta. Given Recoome's humanoid appearance it is probably safe to assume that whatever alien race he is likely shares anatomical similarities with humans. It's unlikely that Goku (who is rather uneducated) would be aware of some of the damage his attack could inflict. Therefore, while Goku probably thinks he is landing a non-lethal blow, he could in fact be causing damage anywhere from liver/splenic rupture to a ruptured abdominal aorta (his attack is a pretty deep one) which would result in exsanguination in minutes. So  yeah, he could kill Recoome through internal bleeding."

What a letdown. I bet they won't even bring us the Dragon Ball portion."
dbz,3desq2,EmmaWinters,4,Wed Jul 15 19:38:16 2015 UTC,"I know it's crappy and I don't like it either, but I guess they might've realised with the renewed interest in Dragon Ball that they can actually afford to leave it this long and pace themselves."
dbz,3desq2,Jay_Bagel,8,Wed Jul 15 19:51:40 2015 UTC,"By this rate, it will be 10 years before Viz releases all of Z in Full Color.  I'm glad they're actually doing it, but it is such a let down.  Are you telling me that it really will take almost a full year to get these ready for release?  Viz isn't even going to retranslate anything so I don't see what could possibly take so long."
dbz,3desq2,jumpshot22,7,Wed Jul 15 19:50:13 2015 UTC,"That's the disgusting part. We're still getting the same quirks, mistakes and censorship we got over a decade ago."
dbz,3desq2,EmmaWinters,4,Wed Jul 15 20:04:43 2015 UTC,"If they were going to do a new translation, then I would gladly wait a full year for these to be released.  The fact that they aren't going to change anything and it will still take this long is a bit of a slap in the face to the fans, IMO.  I hope there is an actual justified reason for why these are taking so long to release."

dbz,3desq2,Coachpatato,3,Thu Jul 16 01:50:44 2015 UTC,Yes I got some of the them when I was in Hawaii I have part of the Buu saga
dbz,3desq2,Kooshawa,2,Thu Jul 16 02:26:48 2015 UTC,Thats. I've recently been reading them but they've been scanlated and the quality is just awful.
dbz,3desq2,Coachpatato,3,Thu Jul 16 02:32:21 2015 UTC,Look into downloading MofoGoku's translation of the Kanzenban. MofoGoku is doing what Viz should have done a long time. He is providing a very accurate translation from the Japanese source material. The scans of the Kanzenban that he is using are also very high quality.
dbz,3desq2,jumpshot22,2,Thu Jul 16 02:55:42 2015 UTC,Jesus thats so much nicer than what I was reading. Night and day. After dragon ball it was so shit it was almost a struggle.

dbz,3desq2,jumpshot22,2,Thu Jul 16 02:53:01 2015 UTC,Thats awesome. I surprised there arent any scanlations.
dbz,3desq2,Coachpatato,2,Thu Jul 16 02:55:14 2015 UTC,"There was an attempt to do it by a group but they got shut down quickly by Viz. Any group that attempts it in the future would likely meet the same fate, so it is just not worth it. If you really want them, you can purchase the Japanese digital Full Colors, which cover Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z, and read them beside MofoGoku's Kanzenban translation. That is the only current way to experience the Full Colors if you are unable to read Japanese."
dbz,3desq2,jumpshot22,7,Thu Jul 16 03:38:48 2015 UTC,Those bastards lied to us. We were supposed to get 3 volumes a year. I bet they'll still have the same censorship and errors that we have been getting in every rerelease of Dragon Ball for the past decade. Well at least were getting it.

dbz,3dhptt,XavurtheJester,7,Thu Jul 16 10:52:47 2015 UTC,"For starters, this sort of post falls under Rule #4 in the Rules of Posting, as simply posting a question in the title, and then not making any effort to say much anything in the actual post is considered a ""low-effort"" post. In the future, please add more to it. In this case, you could have said why you think it's this or that, rather than simply ""the title"".  To answer your question though, it's not definitive, though it's strongly indicated that it is the case.  In the original manga, Freeza's only reference to his ""parent(s)"" before the introduction of his father was during Goku's battle with him on Namek, where he said -    Freeza: “I didn’t think you’d be this good…You’re the first person besides my parent[s] who’s got dust on me…This might be the first time in my life I’ve been so excited…”   The word used in the original text for the word parent, oya, can be used in both the singular and the plural, so it's not certain whether he's saying ""parent"" or ""parents"" as a result.  In the Akira Toriyama-sensei Super Q&A!! from the March 2014 issue of Saikyō Jump, Toriyama had this to say regarding Freeza's parentage.   About how many of Freeza’s race are there? Are they quite thriving, with a big population?  Freeza is what you might call a mutated life-form. Strictly speaking, Freeza’s father is a mutant with an abnormally high battle power. And, born from his father alone, still in strong possession of the mutant traits, was Freeza.  Accordingly, even saying “Freeza’s race”, these two are the only ones who possess an abnormal [level of] battle power and cruelty.   Now, even though it states that he was ""born from his father alone"", it's not 100% certain if it's meaning that Cold was his only parent and that Freeza was produced asexually, or that it was simply emphasizing that Cold carried and passed those traits to him.  Unfortunately, in both the dubbed versions of the anime as well as official translations of the manga, such as Viz, because the English language has singular and plural forms of most all words, they had to simply make a judgment call when it came to Freeza's line on Namek about his ""parent(s)"", and chose to play it a bit on the safe side and just state he has two parents, even though the accuracy of pluralizing it is questionable."

A synopsis from Kanzenshuu, if you like:   Several years after the battle with Cell, a now 16 year-old Gohan enrolls in high school. With a personality that won’t allow evil, Gohan transforms into the Great Saiyaman with a transformation switch built for him by Bulma and defended justice in Satan City. However, his identity was discovered by Mister Satan’s daughter Videl, and he was strong-armed into entering the Tenka’ichi Budōkai. With Goku deciding to come back to Earth for a single day to participate in the tournament, Gohan and the others strive to train for the tournament. And so at last, the day of the first Tenka’ichi Budōkai in a long time arrives!  The final round of the Tenka’ichi Budōkai Childrens’ Division pitted Goten against Trunks. At the end of the intense battle, Trunks was the winner! At last the adult division starts. In the main competition, the mysterious participants Shin, Kibito, Yamu, and Spopovitch appeared. After learning that Shin is actually a Kaiōshin (""Supreme Kai"", in the English dub), everyone closely watches the match between the Great Saiyaman (Gohan) and Kaiōshin’s attendant Kibito. Immediately after the match begins, Yamu and Spopovitch came after Gohan, who had transformed into a Super Saiyan, and they stole his energy!  Together with Kaiōshin, Goku and the others pursue the pair, and are informed of the ambitions of the wizard Babidi. Needing energy in order to revive Majin Buu, the wizard Babidi entices Goku and co. into his spaceship. Goku and co. overwhelmed the warriors dispatched by Babidi, but somehow Vegeta was manipulated by Babidi and clashed with Goku! With that energy, Majin Buu’s revival begins!  Majin Buu is finally revived! With strength that doesn’t match his outward appearance, Dabra, Kaiōshin, and Gohan are no match for him. Vegeta challenges him to a fight on his own, but even the attack for which he sacrificed his life was of no effect. With few people left alive in the lower world, Goku proposes that he teach the Fusion technique to Goten and Trunks. Meanwhile in the Kaiōshin realm, having had his life saved by Kaiōshin, Gohan had drawn out the legendary Z Sword, said to grant one incredible power!  In order to stall Majin Buu, who was going to destroy West City, Goku transforms into Super Saiyan 3. After Goku departs, Majin Buu kills Babidi and begins enjoying himself by destroying the Earth as he pleases. Gohan is given a power-up by the Elder Kaiōshin, who appeared from the Z Sword, while Goten and Trunks become Gotenks through Fusion. Majin Buu briefly became gentle through Satan’s persuasion, but because of wicked people he achieved a super power-up. The time for the decisive battle is near!  Majin Buu, who had exterminated nearly all of humanity, commences to battle Gotenks. However, with the power of Super Saiyan 3 cut off, Gotenks is in completely dire straits! At that point Gohan arrives, having finished his power-up in the Kaiōshin realm, and overwhelms Majin Buu. It seemed like Gohan would have an overwhelming victory, but Majin Buu absorbed Piccolo and Gotenks, powering up even further! At Gohan’s crisis, Goku showed up with the potara, but even Gohan ended up getting absorbed.  Goku merges with a resurrected Vegeta through the potara, and rescues Gohan and the others. However, due to the original Majin Buu being torn out as well, Majin Buu metamorphoses into a Majin Buu of pure evil. Having obliterated the Earth, Majin Buu appears in the Kaiōshin realm, and he and Goku begin the final decisive battle! With help from Vegeta, the original Majin Buu, and Satan, Goku annihilates Majin Buu with a Super Genki-Dama!  And then, ten years had passed and our heroes participate in the Tenka’ichi Budōkai. After battling with the young Uub, Goku takes him under his wing and the two set out on a journey to train the young warrior. Goodbye, Goku. Until we meet again!"

Chronologically he's 10 years old during the battle with Cell, though biologically, with the majority of a year under his belt from his time in the Room of Spirit and Time, he's at or near 11 years old, which puts him at biologically being nearly 18 years old during the Buu Saga."

Vegeta is a dick for a little bit but does a 180 and sacrifices himself in a blaze of glory after hugging Trunks and telling him he's proud of him.   Goten (Goku's 2nd son, Goku apparently impregnated ChiChi before he died in the Cell games) and Trunks learn a new technique to fuse themselves temporarily in to a powerful fighter capable of Super Saiyan 3 levels of power.  Goku shows off Super Saiyan 3  Gohan meets Hercule's daughter and they start dating.  Gohan has another power unlock (like Guru did on Namek) but this time he's stronger than his Super Saiyan 2 form (what he was when he killed Cell) without having to transform  Krillin marries Android 18 and they have a daughter  Buu is defeated but a good version of him exists and is befriended by Hercule.

The King Kai (Kaio in Japanese) we know is the King Kai of the Northern Galaxy, with the other 3 galaxies have King Kais of their own. The Grand Kai is the one above them, and above him is the Supreme Kai, who is the one who tells Goku and the others about Buu. The Supreme Kai has a sidekick named Kibito incidentally.   Originally there were 4 other Supreme Kais (including a Grand Supreme Kai), but 2 were killed by Buu, and another two were absorbed by him, leaving only the one we see in the series. The Grand Supreme Kai was absorbed by Buu, which resulted in Buu having a good side. This part of Buu is the one that survives.  At some point in the Buu Saga, the Supreme Kai ends up combining with Kibito, making Kibito Kai. A former Supreme Kai (Elder Kai, or Elder Kaioshin in Japanese) who was sealed inside a sword is also freed by Gohan, and then unlocks Gohan's potential. So there are currently 2 Supreme Kais."

The paper can handle both Watercolor and Acrylic just fine.  If you find yourself wanting to paint in oil, stay away from paper (the oil bleeds, and takes forever to dry on paper).  You can also ""fool"" a canvas look by taking poster board, and with a natural hair brush (stiff bristle) you can create a criss-cross pattern with the gesso or just a few layers of white acrylic paint."

It's not the worst thing ever, but I think it would have looked nicer/cleaner. I don't like Goku's eye as it looks too gray and out of place, almost cartoonishly inconsistent with the rest of the painting.  Outside of all the artsy critique, I think it looks nice. The canvas created a fun bubbly effect, which gives out almost a real life filter of sorts. The colors are playing and are generally correct. Overall, could use some improvements, but for someone learning the ropes, it's nice."

dbz,3dfy1e,Raxtzle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:31:51 2015 UTC,"SSJ4 isn't cannon at all though. We also most likely wont see it in DBS. The only reason Golden Oozaru was a transformation in DBZ is that the original Super Saiya-jin wasn't strong enough to reach that form without first going Oozaru. Which killed him because he couldn't control himself, let alone the power from both forms. Therefore he exploded and took the entire planet with him.  However, yes that does sound pretty cool. Even though I don't like the idea of ssj3 let alone a ssj4. There are way too many ""forms"" in this series and it gets obnoxious. They need to tone down on the forms and accentuate, personal development. Plot armor isn't a good for story advancement. Having the saiya-jins being the only race worth mentioning is getting pretty old."
dbz,3dfy1e,tmanz06,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:58:06 2015 UTC,I would really like then to do more in the way of refining/evolving the existing forms rather than adding new ones. Kind of like how Ichigo's bankai changes in bleach as he hones his powers etc
dbz,3dg5x8,Silver898,8,Thu Jul 16 00:35:02 2015 UTC,"Universes have their residents exclusive to them, all of Dragon Ball has happened on Universe 7, for instance Goku cannot have another version of him in say, Universe 3. Timelines are more akin to ""What if?"" Scenarios for characters, so the Movies do happen in different Timelines for Universe 7."
dbz,3dg5x8,Danbito,7,Thu Jul 16 01:10:14 2015 UTC,"The first thirteen Z movies exist within the same continuity as one another, but they all still took place in the same universe as the manga's storyline, which is Universe 7. Don't think of universes in the Dragon Ball franchise as different realities from one another, and instead as simply different locations."

dbz,3dg5x8,totheark1,2,Thu Jul 16 00:44:32 2015 UTC,That would make the most since because the Broly movie wouldn't make sense in terms of time placement (unless you like to believe that it took place in the peaceful days before the Cell Games).

dbz,3dfbpk,DemoORAS,4,Wed Jul 15 22:53:07 2015 UTC,DBS has been confirmed to take place 6 months after the buu saga.
dbz,3dfbpk,BrennanBr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:49:04 2015 UTC,Yo! Son Goku was written in a time where DBZ was the conclusion and nothing was supposed to happen until Uub. It was written to take place during the 'ever lasting present' after Buu was killed. Try not to take the time the narrator says in the special TOO literally.
dbz,3dfbpk,Itzie4,2,Thu Jul 16 07:22:29 2015 UTC,Thanks for taking the time to write this
dbz,3dfbpk,Etonet,2,Thu Jul 16 03:40:53 2015 UTC,"It's a cool theory. Problem 1 is DBS takes place 6 months after Buu. So the timelines are a bit off. Also, if I remember correctly, the public still knows of Buu in the special, whereas in DBS they have no clue who he is.  And then didn't Mr. Satan open a hotel in the special? It hasn't been shown or implied, but we are only 2 episodes in.  I would like for Tarble to be 'canon', but not his 'wife'. Also, I hope we get to explore his background more, and maybe retcon his size (he was way too small)."
dbz,3dfbpk,jnogueras,2,Thu Jul 16 03:41:51 2015 UTC,"The timeline being a little off doesn't matter. The special was simply written to take place in the present after Buu. This was before any new material was ever conceived.  It's not like it matters. Akira Toriyama retcons time all the time. Hell, Battle of Gods shows a teenage Vegeta watching his dad, when it was showed previously in the series that Vegeta was destroyed when he was much younger.   My point is: Don't take time too literally.   In my screen writing classes when we talk about setting, my professor has mentioned things taking place in the ""ever lasting present."" I think this special was a case of that."
dbz,3dfbpk,Itzie4,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:28:29 2015 UTC,Good point. I don't take time seriously anyway. Either way I want an older/taller Tarble to make an appearance.
dbz,3dfbpk,jnogueras,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:36:19 2015 UTC,"With the changing of the event time frame of the events of Super re-telling the events of Battle of Gods, the 2008 JSAT Special doesn't fit into the manga's continuity with it being 2 years after the events of the Buu Saga.  Super, given what's been shown, has changed it so that rather than four years after the battle with Buu, Beerus's encounter with Goku and the others takes place six months after the fight with Buu, which would mean that the JSAT special would be taking place AFTER the encounter with Beerus if it were to be considered into the manga's continuity anymore.  The only real way that the JSAT special could be placed in the manga's continuity again, given the adjusted time frame Super's giving us, would be a retconning of the time frame of the JSAT special so that it took place within that six months, which would also serve to explain how it's known in the special that Mr. Satan explicitly saved the Earth from Ma-jin Buu, as it would have been before the wish was made to wipe their memories."

Also filler flashbacks explaining things that were never really explained to begin with.   Examples; Goten when he first became super saiyan, Trunks when he first became super saiyan, what Android 17 is doing, how did Krillin get 18 who was all pissed off over being saved by him to become his wife (especially need a flashback here, I want to see exactly how Krillin has enough game to bag a girl like that), what Tien and tiny chinadoll man are doing and why."

That is, a relaxing take on Dragon Ball with my favorite characters. I can do without the stale concept of power struggles that last many episodes, eventually taking up the majority of the episode count. This is literally the last thing I want.  The second episode was perfect for me. A balanced mix of the franchise' signature humor, and just the right amount of extraterrestrial combat, setting up future episodes. I loved it!  If I had to make a wish for something I'd like to see happen, it would be seeing Goku's mother, or Goku just knowing about her existence. That would make me happy.   Additionally, I wouldn't mind seeing Tarble once again. I realize that he might have some issues getting in due to him being a character commissioned by Shueisha, but that's my wish."

I know Goku/Vegeta are the main duo of the show, but that doesn't necessary mean they need to be in EVERY episode.

They go out in space, together they can form a super Saiyan 3 power fighter so Goku and Vegeta aren't too worried. Have them do their own thing for a bit like GT, but better. Vegeta and Goku are off training with Whis and Beerus, so they are occupied. Same thing with Piccolo as my last comment, MAYBE add some chemical X to the human fighters to beef them up, and have Piccolo and the humans defend Earth for a small villain or two. This process wouldn't drag on like GT either. Then one day, Goten and Trunks get attacked by a supervillain from another universe. Killed or beaten up, doesn't matter.

As for the gods fusing I feel it will be something more permanent due to the fact of having god ki. Unlike goku and vegeta who get god ki via transformation. Thus gogeta being able to transform ssgss.  Honestly I feel like this will happen. I don't know why I mean I could be wrong on some things like the gods of destructions fusion being permanent them being from 2 different universes(i think i don't know any info on the new guy or his name for that matter lol ive just seen pics i dont think this is really a spoiler everyone should have seen the picture by now.) but I would think you would need a more powerful fusion to work with god ki.

And what's great are the draw backs. With the potara it's basically irreversible unless you got buu's stomach acid.

dbz,3de857,Etonet,2,Wed Jul 15 21:10:02 2015 UTC,"DBZ is all about transformations, so the fusion was a unique & original way to bring in some more transformations."

dbz,3dclqt,Martyax,6,Wed Jul 15 19:41:30 2015 UTC,"The short answer would be probably that the scripts that they were using were translated from French to English. There are probably some things that you can point out, but no one really has the definite answer of why the dub was bad. I'm sure that they never had any intentions on making it bad, but it just resulted in being bad.  There are several theories behind why it possibly turned out the way it did. Someone over on the Kanzenshuu board wrote a pretty informative way on how French dubbing works. A direct link to the post can be found here."

He was also employed by Baba, who was generally on the good side but could be pretty selfish, so she might've tried to prevent putting her star fighter in danger. And they might've figured that if he wasn't strong enough to beat Kid Goku, any villain they faced in the future would be able to just dodge the beam, so why bother getting him killed?"
dbz,3dd7wf,Slot-T,7,Wed Jul 15 11:32:37 2015 UTC,I don't think goku would have let spike just defeat their enemies. Goku is the kind of guy who will push himself to beat someone before resorting to anyone else or 'tricks'.  Plus people like frieza and cell were so fast they could have just moved behind him and shoved an arm through his chest.
dbz,3dd7wf,krockhunter,2,Wed Jul 15 11:28:51 2015 UTC,"In the PS2 game, Dragon Ball Budokai Tenkaichi 3 there's a sequence where you play as Devil Man and fight against King Cold and Frieza when they got to earth after the battle on namek. I think his powers would have been great on Frieza and Cell but on Buu, it would have blew him up but then he would just regenerate."

English Z is really inaccurate and has a lot of cringe-worthy dialogue, but it's the version most people grew up on, so you might hear a lot about it.  English Kai is the best way to watch dubbed DBZ. The voice performances are better, and the script is more faithful to the original.  Japanese Z probably has the best voice performance and soundtrack, but it does have the pacing issues. The pacing is fixed in Japanese Kai."

dbz,3dclb6,ATDghost,8,Wed Jul 15 10:48:16 2015 UTC,"what would be the order to watch the series in?    Finish Dragon Ball. Choose Z or Z Kai. If you choose Z Kai, switch to episode 200 of DBZ after episode 98, or watch 99-159 fansubbed.  From there, watch the JSAT special, and Battle of Gods. Read Jaco the Galactic Patrolman, which is a prequel to Dragon Ball written after Battle of Gods. Watch Resurrection 'F'.  From there, watch Super. GT, and the other movies/specials are entirely optional. GT takes place after Dragon Ball Z's ten year time skip, while Super takes place 6 months after Majin Buu.  If you'd prefer, you can watch everything in the order it was released using this list.   Is it better to watch the English dub or the original Japanese?   Do you care about accuracy? Because the English dub changes quite a bit. I would recommend the original Japanese, because you will be watching Super in Japanese anyway.   Finally, where is a good place to stream all of these episodes?   FUNimation: Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball GT"

dbz,3dceuq,Griffzilla,11,Wed Jul 15 04:32:48 2015 UTC,"Daizenshuu 4 indicates that only those members of the same clan can merge together -   Two Namekians can fuse as long as their types aren't different. This fusion is similar to the merging that comes from using the potara, and once fused the two people cannot return to normal. By deciding who will be the base, this determines who will be in control after fusing. The unique trait is that the fused person's power is absorbed, powering up the person who is the base.   As such, members of the Warrior Clan can only merge with other members, and members of the Dragon Clan can only merge with other members of the Dragon Clan. Therefore, it'd be impossible for them all to fuse together, since there'd end up being one Dragon and one Warrior Clan member left.  Piccolo and Kami were only able to combine because they were originally the same being, so while it was still merging, it wasn't constrained to requiring the same typing."

dbz,3dcj3c,Nickolaus,4,Wed Jul 15 05:17:00 2015 UTC,"Dragon Ball releases have been a trip in terms of quality. Our FAQ covers a good bit of the differences in quality per set release. Here is a direct copy and paste of the FAQ:   Q: What is the best way to purchase the anime?  A: There are many different ways to purchase the anime. While all releases of Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball GT are in their native 4:3 fullscreen aspect ratio, most English releases of Dragon Ball Z were cropped to 16:9 widescreen.   For Dragon Ball, your best option is the Blue Brick DVD sets. [4:3 Native] For Dragon Ball Z, your best option is the most recent Blu-ray set [16:9 Cropped] For Dragon Ball Kai, your best option is most recent Blu-ray/DVD set. If you prefer Kenji Yamamoto's musical score, you want ""Parts 1-4"" of the Part set. [4:3 Native] For Dragon Ball GT, your best option is the Green Brick DVD set. [4:3 Native]   Other releases include:   The Dragon Ball Z Orange Brick DVD set [16:9 Cropped], which are criticized for their aggressive filtering, over-contrasted colors, automated center crop, and excessive detail loss during scenes with shaky picture. The Dragon Ball Z Dragon Box set [4:3 Native], the now-out-of-print collector's edition which is considered by many to be the best DVD set of the series. Unfortunately, they run around $700 for a complete set on eBay, and don't include the American broadcast soundtrack. The Dragon Ball Z Blu-ray Level Sets [4:3 Native], the now-cancelled Blu-ray set which was praised for its faithful colors, grain preservation and original 4:3 aspect ratio. The Dragon Ball Z ""Rock The Dragon"" set [4:3 Native], which contains all 53 episodes of the original Ocean Group dub.    Not a problem. Definitely consider taking a look at the additional links I edited in, if you haven't already."

I grew up watching the English versions and it blew my mind how much it changed from the original Japanese dub when I started watching the original. The original version had totally different elements at certain points. Like Goku not giving Vegeta  mercy at the end of the saiyan arc. He just wanted to let him go to fight him again. The English dub make it look like Goku was being super boyscout and an honorable man. While he just wanted to fight Vegeta again because he was excited by it as a Saiyan.

dbz,3d9jav,Hieillua,3,Wed Jul 15 19:34:46 2015 UTC,Many people are complaining that it's really slow and that there's no action and that there are goofy jokes. I guys those people only watched a few DBZ english dub episodes and never really got what Dragon Ball is about.
dbz,3d9jav,pianomancuber,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:42:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, evidently they never watched DB or even GT (I know it's not canon and it had problems, but I loved the slice of life bits in it)."

dbz,3d9jav,Bushybutt,54,Wed Jul 15 17:52:17 2015 UTC,I just sighed and shook my head. Another one of these shit articles by people who didn't even watch the show properly. And i can't believe some people are actually dumb enough to agree with what he said.
dbz,3d9jav,applepwnz,22,Wed Jul 15 20:00:21 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say I raged, it just seems like lazy writing to appeal to casual fans: ""DAE Goku is a bad father??? ROFLMAO!"""
dbz,3d9jav,pkbronsonb,2,Tue Jul 14 15:48:15 2015 UTC,"I did try to back up my claims with solid examples. If I made this article last week, I would have included the bit in Dragon Ball Super when Goku takes the first chance he gets to ditch his family and train on King Kai's planet."
dbz,3d9jav,ExpAwesome,2,Tue Jul 14 15:55:07 2015 UTC,"Goku IS an awful father. And they could flash more often, though the enemies would probably not be affected by it eventually to up the difficulty.  But most of the other things you wrote were wrong.  Even if Bulma had a gun, that gun would never be as powerful as Krillin, and we all know how well Krillin's power levels get him.  Ain't nothing wrong with a little popo in your life.  Goku is dumb, but it is his nature. He is a fighter, he has been dumb since the first episode of Dragon Ball. But for Instant Transmission, he has to know where he is going, King Kai's place is the first place he could think of. And while you may think he had time to teleport King Kai off world, the timing in the show is usually off to make room for dialogue, in reality Cell blew up almost as soon as he was teleported.  And for the dragon balls, their power can not exceed the power of their creator. It hasn't even been confirmed that they CAN grant immortality. So they certainly couldn't wish away all the bad guys."

dbz,3d9jav,Christobal711,24,Wed Jul 15 22:34:01 2015 UTC,"The gun and solar flare argument makes sense, lol, but Goku being stupid? He's no intelligent by standard academic means, but he's a battle genius! His parenting is a little bad, arguably, but circumstances made him appear that way. He is shown to truly love his family multiple times! Such an Ill advised article..."
dbz,3d9jav,Bushybutt,32,Tue Jul 14 18:50:14 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, but guns don't make sense. You've seen Bulma shot Goku with a gun in the first episode of DB right, Goku was at his weakest and it didn't do shit to him. Crane Hermit caught all of Launch's machine gun bullets. Gohan crushed the pellets shot at him. And android 17 barely flinched. Therefore, guns are pretty much nerf guns to them. In any case, the solar flare argument makes sense, however, just a thought, they have already become so strong they don't rely on their eyes when they fight, they can sense ki easy while they fight."
dbz,3d9jav,ariarr,8,Tue Jul 14 15:47:31 2015 UTC,"in fairness, he did say that maybe the world's greatest scientist could create a gun that could hurt someone. But I disagree with that since they still haven't found the technology capable of this. I mean the kiblasters are the best the universe has, and they're really really bad. although bulma's gun from jaco is pretty good.  my point is they didn't think their article through.  edit: Now that i've registered what he's saying: tien and piccolo are death-prone?! what the f***. This is ridiculous. These people are stupid."
dbz,3d9jav,Authentically,3,Tue Jul 14 15:53:51 2015 UTC,"Weapons like that would only make normal people targets for these superpowerful villains. I'm sure Bulma and her father would prefer to leave such dirty work to Goku and the rest. Plus, Dr. Gero may have created the androids and Cell, but it took him decades of obsessive trial and error."
dbz,3d9jav,Christobal711,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:25:49 2015 UTC,"Did no one see resurrection of F. Im not going to spoil it for people who haven't seen it, but he's not to far off from the gun point. The other points he makes aren't that bad either. Even the solar flare/destructor disk, though even those are probably stoppable at a high enough level. Gohan stops 2 at super saiyan 2."
dbz,3d9jav,Etonet,3,Tue Jul 14 20:37:47 2015 UTC,"Even if you could sense Ki as greatly as you think, getting hit with a blast of light that may or may not be as strong as the sun would still stun you for a little while haha."
dbz,3d9jav,Bushybutt,5,Wed Jul 15 15:38:03 2015 UTC,It's like a one-time trick anyway. Goku found a way around it in the middle of a fight as a kid

dbz,3d9jav,sawddit,3,Tue Jul 14 22:01:42 2015 UTC,"I think that it was too overpowered for them to keep in, haha. I mean an attack that can blind your opponent long enough to score a finisher would mean every villain would have been easily killed meaning less action and suspense."
dbz,3d9jav,pkbronsonb,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:11:24 2015 UTC,Even if they did somehow make a Ki gun that could damage a strong fighter it would be hard as fuck to get a good shot in

dbz,3d9jav,pkbronsonb,5,Wed Jul 15 01:32:39 2015 UTC,"and the IT to King Kai's planet. You need someones ki to teleport with IT. Plus if you were him, do you have 10 seconds to think of a nice place with no life? IT takes concentration."
dbz,3d9jav,Etonet,7,Tue Jul 14 19:16:18 2015 UTC,"Hi guys! This might be dangerous to admit around here, but I wrote this article. I have indeed watched Dragon Ball Z and genuinely love the show, I just thought it might be fun to pick it apart in places. I did consult with some DBZ aficionados before writing the article, and apart from some flubs -- I did trip up when it came to the rules of Instant Transmission -- I stand by my thoughts in general."
dbz,3d9jav,SonicFrost,16,Tue Jul 14 20:58:18 2015 UTC,"Gonna upvote in case other people are downvoting, but i disagree with most of what you wrote (also what was with the Mr. Popo thing?):     Giving the weak characters guns would level the playing field, or at least afford weaker characters some form of self-defense. It sure would beat watching Bulma cower in a cave for weeks at a time     Guns aren't going to be useful for someone like Bulma; it doesn't matter how fast the gun is if the user is slow. Read this. In the time it takes for Bulma to pull the trigger, 13-year-old Krillin could have disarmed her and made off with the Dragon Balls     Why wouldn't you just pop Solar Flare and then toss in a quick Destructo Disk and call it good for like every enemy ever?      Solar Flare is easy to predict after the first time, isn't that useful on the characters who can sense ki, and we don't really know the requirements of the technique and whether or not it's spammable    Destructo Discs aren't that hard to dodge; Nappa dodged one right in front of him, Vegeta dodged one from behind without being able to sense ki, and Frieza with two Destruco Discs couldn't hit Goku      but he's also straight-up stupid when it comes to fighting. Not when it comes to the act itself, but when it comes to winning.     Here Recoome starts to set up for his attack and gets punched in the stomach. Also Goku is called a combat genius like every other chapter; not sure why you're saying he's stupid at fighting     Example: Dude had Frieza dead to rights after he went Super Saiyan for the first time, but he wanted a fair fight -- so he let this guy who had just murdered Krillin power up to 100%.     That was when he had first obtained the Super Saiyan; King Kai said ""Goku wasn't like himself""     After Frieza was cut in half by his own attack, Goku still showed mercy. And so for a hot minute, the mass-murdering psychopath floated around as a torso before betraying his savior at the first possible chance.     Showing mercy is stupid? Frieza had been cut in half, was completely out of energy, begging for forgiveness and lying on top of an exploding planet. Goku gave Frieza one chance. When Frieza showed up on Earth in the Future timeline, Goku just teleported over and killed him     Even at his greatest moments, Goku still manages to screw people over. Like the time Cell was about to self-destruct and destroy the earth, Goku sacrificed himself and teleported the both of them away -- but he didn't teleport them somewhere devoid of life like deep space, the sun or Ryan Seacrest's dead eyes. No, Goku transmitted himself and the exploding Cell right onto King Kai's planet.      Yeah you know this already; Instant Transmission requires a ki signature     Despite his somewhat pervy past, the Goku of DBZ seems almost asexual in his childlike naivete. Imagining Goku desiring someone enough to get it on is almost as weird as considering the fact that Goofy had sex     That's like saying dogs are pervy because they sniff each other's butts, and that it's weird for them to reproduce because they're cute and childlike     By raising his Gohan as a fighter, Goku puts his child in incredible danger on a daily basis     Goku didn't ""raise Gohan as a fighter"". Chi-Chi said Gohan would grow up to become a scholar, and that was that, until Raditz showed up. Also Saiyans didn't invade Earth on a daily basis     Before Gohan can learn long division, he's pitted against grown adults way out of his league. The kid isn't even seven years old when his dad encourages him to fight against Vegeta (or rather, get his kindergarten shit kicked in)     Gohan had been stolen by Piccolo, and without him, Goku would have undoubtedly lost the fight against Vegeta. Goku didn't really have anything to do with this     Goku just watches from a distance, trusting his 11 year-old son to defeat the most powerful being known to man in order to save the entire Earth. Even when Cell puts Gohan in an inescapable bearhug, Goku just smiles on.     Goku was trying to use Cell to get Gohan mad and unlock the hidden power inside him. Goku wasn't certain he could defeat Cell himself, but he was sure Gohan could    Goku had also been fighting since he was a kid, and he's never been revealed to Gohan's soft side before. Goku comes back form the Other World and sees Gohan in the middle of a fight; Goku gets to Namek and sees Gohan in the middle of a fight; Goku says ""let's train for Androids"" and Gohan agrees immediately. When Piccolo told Goku that Gohan wasn't actually like him, he was going to eat a senzu and jump right back in. Gohan did become stronger than both Goku and Vegeta      Goku abandons his wife, his two sons and his granddaughter in order to help a stranger.      Chi-Chi didn't really care and his sons were old enough. What was wrong with that?     The Dragon Balls are a plot device so powerful that the show is named after them and the heroes never use them to their full potential     Pretty much the only thing i agree with, but using them like that would ruin the series"

dbz,3d9jav,Christobal711,3,Tue Jul 14 23:14:17 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna try to play devils advocate here, although most of the points are nit picky, I'll agree. He's not to far off from some of them.  Guns: Sort of spoiler! Of course if someone can see a shot coming at them, they can block it, or move. An example would be a blast from Vegeta throwing off Cell during the kamehameha power struggle.  Goku is pretty stupid, but a genius at fighting. He clearly loves his family, but he also loves fighting, it's sometimes hard to tell which he loves more.  Solar flare/destructor disc: Solar flare might work, but the disc probably aren't too useful by the time ssj2 came around. Gohan stopped 2 at the same time from cell as a super saiyan 2. And besides, the fights wouldn't be too interesting if they did that all the time, which we all know is the reason why they don't do it.  Goku, again. The only point here the guy gets wrong is he didn't make gohan fight cell to teach gohan a lesson, he did it because gohan was the only one who could possibly beat him.  Immortality: someone mentioned here that no ones really sure if shenron could do it. The closest is probably Pilaf, and they screwed up the wish. Though I might be mistaken, I haven't seen Dbz in probably around 10 or so years except for fight clip here and there.  Oh yeah, and Mr. popo is awesome, but a clear example of blackface.

These Z fighters have blasts that destroy planets, anything short of a nuclear warhead would be completely harmless to them. And developing weapons that have that strength that a normal person could use sounds like a bad idea.  For the Instant transmission, If I remembered correctly, he needed to teleport to a place where he feels a presence. An energy, a person. To be fair, he definitely didn't have much time to think and King Kai's planet was pretty remote. s  For the Freeza powering up - He wanted to embarrass him to the max and a monkey defeating him at his best is the ultimate embarrassment."

It's meant to surprise your opponent to give yourself a quick opening to retreat or connect with another technique. If they used it all the time, it would be so predictable and virtually worthless.

In general during that self destruct scene with Cell Goku had enough time to teleport Cell and come back or flee King Kai's planet with his friends if he didn't stop to say goodbye beforehand. I get he's a Saiyan and all, but that moment where he gave Cell a senzu bean before fighting Gohan was a poor choice. Gohan could've been strong enough to beat him then and there. If not, he'd probably end up unlocking his SSJ2 transformation anyways since it was fueled by anger and not from being overpowered. And yeah, with the power of IT he could totally train Uub during the day and come back home to his wife and kid at night. Kind of like a day job. We know he values relaxation time as part of his training anyways, so why not do that at home?  So yeah, before you go raging on the article you have to admit it's a mix of good and bad points.

It DOES change, but not that dramatically.  Toriyama probably made it like that so it would be a more drastic change when he went SSJ2."
dbz,3dbkh3,mozillavulpix,0,Wed Jul 15 01:56:40 2015 UTC,"But the problem with comparing it to Vegeta is that Vegetas hair is in his normal state already lifted up/spiky so there is no way to make it even more lifted up so it stays the same. Same thing with Adult Gohan, his hair is already like that. Trunks hair is also really short but can be lifted up during his SSJ state so Gohans hair being too short is not really a good explanation."
dbz,3dbkh3,dannydgriffin,2,Wed Jul 15 08:43:05 2015 UTC,Why even try to pry it apart? Its a gradual step up that makes sense and makes ssj2 look fucking awesome. just enjoy it man
dbz,3dbkh3,Nickolaus,6,Wed Jul 15 14:26:07 2015 UTC,"All there is really speculating of why it did not stand up. It could be possibly that his rage was simply not enough for his hair to stand up, causing his hair to look the same as in his normal state. Another possible reason is that it could avoid confusion on who is who.   Another possible reason, which may be the case, is that hair growth does not occur with most characters. Take a close look at SSJ Vegeta for instance. His hair looks very similar to what his normal state looks like. In this case, Gohan's hair looks the same and does not spike up until SSJ2. This would however not explain why Goten's hair goes up and why Goku's does too."
dbz,3dbkh3,jumpshot22,9,Wed Jul 15 02:17:05 2015 UTC,"There doesn't appear to be an in-universe explanation as to why Gohan's hair does not behave like the other Super Saiya-jins.    The only character whose hair is sometimes displayed the same as in their base form is Vegeta, but even then there is a lot of inconsistency.  For example, in this side by side, Vegeta's hair in his SSJ form has more spikes than in his base form.  However, when Vegeta first turns SSJ in this panel, his hair is less spikey.    Ultimately, it likely came down to Toriyama's personal preference.  Giving Gohan's hair spikes might have made him look too similar to Goku so he opted against it.  It's really hard telling."
dbz,3dbkh3,TheGraic,3,Wed Jul 15 03:20:41 2015 UTC,They mastered Super Saiyan to control the energy output. Maybe his ki was more under control and thus his hair wasn't as affected. It could also just be it was shorter than the other Saiyans so not much to really stand up.  SSJ2 caused his hair to grow slightly longer and the energy was more out of control. Goku's also stood up slightly more when he went SSJ2.
dbz,3dbkh3,TheGraic,5,Wed Jul 15 06:37:48 2015 UTC,Vegeta's hairstyle never changed because he's the Prince of All Saiyans and he's ALWAYS looking stylish.

dbz,3dbkh3,NeuroticNyx,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:27:22 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'd chalk it up to genetics. Maybe Gohan's hair is just different, or his Super Saiyan state doesn't force his hair up as much as other saiyans."

dbz,3dbkh3,Authentically,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:04:30 2015 UTC,in the pictures you provide his hair is slightly spikier as a ssj.   i think i'ts partly due to the fact we only ever really see gohan as a full power ssj.  as such he doesn't really have an aura to life the hair.
dbz,3dbkh3,tangential_quip,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:28:38 2015 UTC,"Future Trunks hair doesn't spike up when it gets super long. Probably just a hair weight, length thing. Of course there is no real reason though, but that's the explanation I would make for it. Same with ssj3"
dbz,3dbkh3,choobafier,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:09:25 2015 UTC,"His hair does stand up in his first transformation in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, when he still had a long mullet.  Clip.  After he cuts it his hair, outside the front is meant to be short which is why only the front spikes up when he is transformed."

dbz,3dc6av,DrLickitung,6,Wed Jul 15 03:11:02 2015 UTC,"The best way of catching up with the series is reading the manga. If you read about 72 chapters a day, you could catch up with the series in about a week. Then all you would need to do is watch Battle of Gods and/or just go into Super blind without knowing who Whis or Beerus are. Super has really yet to go into the personality of Beerus, which is kind of a disappointment. They just throw Beerus into the whole plot and expect you to just accept him who he is.  Your other option is watching Dragon Ball Kai and after episode 98 of Kai, continue with the series Dragon Ball Z at episode 200. This would significantly be slower than reading the series."
dbz,3dc6av,Nickolaus,4,Wed Jul 15 03:20:15 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for this. I'll see how reading the manga goes.  How long, in your opinion, does 72 chapters take to read?"
dbz,3dc6av,Nickolaus,4,Wed Jul 15 03:22:54 2015 UTC,"Definitely. If you want to make the series even shorter, you could skip the whole Dragon Ball portion of the series and start where Raditz kidnaps Gohan. If you do go that route, which isn't recommended, you would begin at chapter 195. You would only have 324 chapters left to read. That would roughly shorten the series by two days, if you were to read about 72 chapters a day.  How long would it take reading 72 chapters a day? It's been awhile since I've read the manga, but it wouldn't take to long. A couple of hours at the max. You could probably read a chapter in about five minutes. If you were to read a chapter every five minutes, it would take you about six hours to read 72 chapters. Of course, some chapters are shorter, and some chapters are longer.   It honestly just depends on how many words you read per minute."
dbz,3dc6av,jumpshot22,3,Wed Jul 15 03:28:34 2015 UTC,"72 chapters is around 6 volumes.  You should be able to comfortably read a volume in 30-45 minutes.  So I would estimate 3-4 hours.  The great thing with the manga is that you can read at your own pace.  So if you just want to get the story quickly, you can read through it quickly.  If you want to pay more attention to the detail in the art, you can read through it slower.  It's all up to you."
dbz,3dc6av,Spartn90,2,Wed Jul 15 03:27:49 2015 UTC,"If you dedicated about 10-12 hours, you'd be able to read all of it, that's what I did before I watched the first super episode, even though I've seen the amine and read the manga 3 times and 2 times respectively"
dbz,3dc6av,Pedicabo_Irrumabo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:09:11 2015 UTC,"You don't need to watch Dragon Ball, but it is a great story that goes into the background of many characters. If you don't want to watch it, plot summaries are fine. You probably will want to watch Dragon Ball Z, but if you want to cut out the filler, watch DBZ Kai. At the moment the Dubbed version of Kai is only up to the end of the cell saga, but if you want you can watch the subbed or switch to DBZ episode 200 after you finish Kai episode 98. When you're finished with the main series, read Jaco the Galactic Patrolman, and watch the JSAT special, Battle of Gods, Resurrection 'F', and Dragon Ball Super. BoG and RoF are being covered in Super though, so it isn't necessary to watch. Also Jaco and the JSAT special aren't necessary either, but are recommended."

But even when vegeta is with his family he's STILL absent. Especially considering the way he treats trunks in the buu saga, and when he acknowledged the fact that he never held or hugged trunks since he was a kid.  Plus if you watch the most recent episode of DBS Bulma and trunks act almost like they have Stockholm syndrom. It was actually kind of sad when vegeta acted like a dick and bailed on his family and trunks was yelling that he had a great time and thanks.   To him that's a normal family interaction with his father. Imagine (or maybe you don't need to) that your father is so distant that you're idea of a god time with your father is him being there ignoring you."

Not just once but he spent most of the time he had allocated left with him.   Lol, Gohan does pull him up on how he's waited since he promised when being on Namek for him to take him though :/"
dbz,3d9rf7,AzoGalvat,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:42:32 2015 UTC,"I like to think that Goku was a decent dad before Raditz showed up. There's a moment when Gohan is out survivng in the wild for Piccolo where he remembers something Goku showed him, and it helps him survive and learn. That, to me, shows that Goku at least was trying to spend time with him and be a good father, then all the shit hit the fan. Without any of it, I think Goku would have been a pretty good dad, I think, given his own upbringing. Yes, he wants to train a lot, and wants Gohan to train with him, but doesn't seem to have been super pushy about it until there was no other option, and Gohan had already done training with Piccolo.  Vegeta, on the other hand, is the ultimate hardass, being brought up saiyan. He's probably emulating his father to an extent, as that's what he knows. He fits your theory better, I think, as he was the one actually raised not only saiyan, but saiyan royalty."
dbz,3d9qt9,kyuuby1391,5,Tue Jul 14 16:35:29 2015 UTC,"Let me know if you guys want to see more of this. It's too much work to do the whole series in one go so I decided to take a crack at the first Saga. Also let me know if you have any suggestions or feedback, or if you see plot mistakes, visual glitches, etc.  Here are the basic ground rules for the way I did it.  Static characters, that don't move around much, don't do any fighting or plot exposition, as well as characters that don't die/revive are generally not included, since their inclusion would just be a straight line through the whole graph. This way, I'm not including characters like Chi-Chi, Ox King and Oolong. I DID however make the decision to include Master Roshi, Popo and King Kai because I felt that they live in locations that pop up frequently throughout the series and they might be a good way to track a recurring location. I didn't include, however characters that are redundant in this way, like Turtle or Bubbles. I am also not including one-off characters.  I am not including movies, but I have no hard ban on filler material. I mostly went through the fillers on a case by case basis, including those I found memorable, like Goku's fall into Hell and Nappa wiping out the navy.  EDIT: Updated version, minor corrections, text formatting and slightly higher res here"

dbz,3danpb,stephen_hawkqueen,18,Tue Jul 14 20:18:34 2015 UTC,"It varies. Mostly it stems from Turles's concept being an evil version of Goku, but it's also tried to be reasoned with both being low-level warriors, and low-level warriors have set looks to identify as low-levels, Turles's and Goku's look being one of them. People also think that they're related somehow, but this is never covered. The movie doesn't even confront WHY they look alike, they just simply note that they do."
dbz,3danpb,Danbito,11,Tue Jul 14 20:25:26 2015 UTC,"Mostly it stems from Turles's concept being an evil version of Goku   Yeah, I always thought they were trying to show that if Goku had not hit his head as a child and completed his mission, he would have pretty much been Turles."

dbz,3danpb,MetalGearKaiju,6,Wed Jul 15 17:55:58 2015 UTC,"From Kanzenshuu's rumor guide:   Tullece states that there “weren’t that many types” of “expendable lower-level warriors” like themselves. This does not mean they had the same parents; rather, it seems to suggest that there were many other similar-looking Saiyans (but remember that this is a movie, where plot continuity does not really matter).   This is reaffirmed by Minoru Maeda, one of the animators:   Since Tullece was supposed to be Goku’s lookalike, it’s basically Goku drawn as-is. However, I gave him a cruel expression and a scouter, and his build has been made a little bit bulkier, as well. His skin color is different, and more than anything else, his costume is completely different, so there was no need to go and deliberately make him seem like an “impostor”."
dbz,3danpb,EmmaWinters,3,Tue Jul 14 20:28:59 2015 UTC,"In-universe: Saiyans lack genetic diversity and members of the same class/caste resemble each other.  think of how bardock, goku, and goten look more or less identical.  or vegeta and his father.   artistic: turles is a dark mirror of goku.  he's what goku could've been if his life had turned out differently.  same as raditz or vegeta but turles really drives the point home by having the same face as goku,"

dbz,3danpb,Cosmodious,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:50:59 2015 UTC,I assumed they were related but that's been thoroughly debunked. The only logical suppositions are that a) he's evil Goku or b) lots of Saiyans look like that.   IMO both explanations are bull and the only real one is unbelievable laziness on the part of Toei.

Bulma didn't know what was going on the entire time they were there. When Trunks killed Freeza, she thought he was Goku.

dbz,3daeir,EmmaWinters,6,Tue Jul 14 20:38:50 2015 UTC,"Do you care about filler? Most of the filler content was removed in Kai. Do you insist on the US replacement score (electro-rock music from Toonami)? Kai does not offer this soundtrack. Are you planning to watch the series dubbed? Kai has a much more faithful-to-the-Japanese English dub than Z does, and as a result, it is often recommended for new viewers who do not wish to watch the series subtitled.  The Majin Buu arc of Dragon Ball Z Kai has yet to be released outside of Japan. Because of this, if you choose to watch Kai in English, you will need to switch to episode 200 (Season 7) of Dragon Ball Z after finishing episode 98 (Season 4) of Kai.  Kai was heavily censored for American television, but it is uncut on DVD and Blu-ray. Unfortunately however, the first few episodes, remain censored for content on all mediums."

dbz,3d9bar,WildBizzy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:03:22 2015 UTC,Is it a form? Because he tried to turn SSJ after unlocking it. I always figured it was just him powering up to that unlocked potential sort of like how it worked with Guru's unlock.
dbz,3d9bar,WildBizzy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:25:33 2015 UTC,"It probably is. He needed to power up to achieve the power, i suppose"

dbz,3d9bar,Mw3beast2013,9,Wed Jul 15 18:27:06 2015 UTC,"In the DBZ universe, Ki works as a muscle and you need to exercise that muscle to build strength. Since Gohan doesn't train past-Buu (allegedly) he weakens. Frieza is a mutant of his race and is naturally stronger than the rest of his people. He was just naturally born with his level of power and never needed to train.   But, I think Gohan's strength is NOT one to go down as much as fans think it does. I think that now that he has had his Potential unlocked, he will always be a capable character. But he has also chosen to go with the family/scholar life so fighting is no longer important to him. Just something I wanted to point out and throw in for discussion. I just really hate when people say Gohan is a weakling when he's not."
dbz,3d9bar,mlerb,2,Tue Jul 14 14:52:08 2015 UTC,Well if he didn't get so many free power ups he would be :P.
dbz,3d9bar,Stevezilla9,3,Wed Jul 15 03:46:21 2015 UTC,"He didn't go back to pre-Cell levels. Vegeta even comments during Gohan's fight with Dabura that Gohan's strength had not changed since Cell, which Vegeta looked down upon since Gohan could have been training since then and gotten much stronger."
dbz,3d9bar,Stevezilla9,2,Tue Jul 14 18:17:12 2015 UTC,"Actually, i believe he said something a long the lines of ""He was stronger in his fight against cell than he is now"" which would mean Gohan's strength dropped below his kid selfs Super Saiyan 2 which is definitely weaker than Super Perfect Cell."

dbz,3d6jzp,InquisitorAura,9,Mon Jul 13 22:33:35 2015 UTC,Vegeta isn't the only developed character. Piccolo has an arc that hinges on his relationship with Gohan. Gohan has a--disappointing to many--arc that doesn't make much narrative sense but deals with his reluctance to fight.
dbz,3d6jzp,AeoSC,10,Tue Jul 14 00:18:54 2015 UTC,"This might be just me looking at things too deeply, but when Piccolo was a kid, one of his first acts was attacking a family due to jealousy of a lack of a father. Later on, he saves a kid from falling rubble. Piccolo always longed for a father figure, his was dead obviously. So when it came to Gohan and seeing him lacking a father, Piccolo felt his first feelings of sympathy. So yeah, Piccolo is definitely a dynamo character as well."

dbz,3d6jzp,AeoSC,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:37:58 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree. Much of Gohan's arc made sense, and unlike many fans I don't mind that he ended up a nerd. But the last leg of his arc after defeating Cell was an abortive mess. The whole build up with the Z-sword and Elder Kai wound up being pointless because Toriyama changed his mind about Gohan succeeding Goku as Earth's protector.  As an aside, as much as I enjoy Goku, I really wish someone could start doing that soon, but Super is the wrong time frame for Pan or Uub, so it doesn't look likely."
dbz,3d6jzp,Mattyx6427,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:36:33 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about gohan as if his arc ended after cell. That was his complete arc that made sense and was focused on him. I'm not counting the buu stuff because that was after his proper arc ended and he more or less became a minor character when all was said and done.   Also you actually want someone to take Goku's place? I dont, and I don't think it would go over well"
dbz,3d6jzp,AeoSC,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:50:05 2015 UTC,"That's one way of looking at it. He was definitely intended to take top billing in the Buu Saga, though, with Goku staying dead. His story would have made more sense if he was simply treated as another minor character during Buu."
dbz,3d6jzp,true_bacon22,2,Wed Jul 15 01:17:47 2015 UTC,"That's true but at the same time Piccolo's is a lot more sudden.Over the course of half a saga he goes from a near-villain rival at the start of Z to completely dedicated to Gohan, despite no event really happening to accelerate that,in comparison to Vegeta who made smaller steps towards being a fully certified good guy."
dbz,3d6jzp,HerenIstarian,11,Tue Jul 14 00:33:46 2015 UTC,"It is less gradual than Vegeta but that takes into account Piccolo's personality as well. He is a far more level-headed and logical character than Vegeta. Also, Piccolo never seems entirely comfortable with his change until merging with Kami. When training on King Kai's planet he really didn't want to associate with the other warriors and when 17 and 18 first showed up and beat the tar out of everyone Krillin makes some remark about Piccolo being a friend and Piccolo throws a fit and flys away. The thing about Piccolo is his rationality trumped any malignant feelings he had and eventually with Gohan's help found something to care for.  Despite Vegeta being a dynamic character (which does make him interesting) his arrogance and 'pride' make him a very foolish character that just got under my skin to many times. No matter how many times his arrogance caused problems he never learned from it and his delusions of grandeur always returned. I'm hoping in DBS he finally grows out of that, it would be good to see a wiser Vegeta."

dbz,3d6jzp,Slot-T,2,Tue Jul 14 18:27:10 2015 UTC,"I agree, Vegeta is the most dynamic character in the series, I thought that this showed when he allowed himself to be possessed in the Buu saga, and then blew himself up to try and save them all. Piccolo does show a great deal of character development as well, his change after Gohan was pretty awesome. Not to mention the fact that before that he questioned himself after killing Goku about how he could hate such a self sacrificing and kind person. This I believe shows that Piccolo was never entirely evil to begin with. Back to Vegeta however, his character development is much slower and he still shows parts of himself throughout all the series. His relationship with his family is ultimately what turns him into a good guy. From the Frieza saga to the beginning of the Android saga there is a grey area. Sorry for the ramble, Vegeta is hands down one of my favorite DBZ characters."

dbz,3d6jvz,ExpAwesome,18,Mon Jul 13 22:32:45 2015 UTC,"Goku was a Saiyan   It cleared up where Goku came from and I like how it linked him to Vegta. Like one of the people who you would consider an enemy ends up being close to you, kind of.   Goku dying   Him dying shocked me. How the hell is the series supposed to continue? How he died was cool. At least I thought so. Giving up your life like that to take out your brother.    Piccolo training Gohan   I thought it was awesome! I already thought Piccolo was a cool character and him training Goku's son was even cooler. I would give my good arm to train with him!   finding out Piccolo is a Namekian   At first I thought it was cheesy but then I slowly accepted the idea. It made more sense than for him to be an actual demon and then he was all ""My people!"" on Namek. That was cool too."

dbz,3d6jvz,tr00perman567,4,Tue Jul 14 00:52:33 2015 UTC,Piccolo being an alien and not a demon sort of makes a few random parts of the last DB story arc a little odd. I thought it was an unnecessary explanation.  Goku being an alien didn't really matter since nothing about him had an explanation at all so it did not feel like anything was retconned. He was just some strange fighting kid that was stronger than normal and occasionally turned into a giant ape.
dbz,3d6jvz,Bert0lz,3,Tue Jul 14 03:12:02 2015 UTC,I don't think Piccolo being an alien changed anything about the last arc. The only real question it brings up is how Kami got to Earth and didn't know where he was from.
dbz,3d6jvz,Bert0lz,2,Tue Jul 14 03:32:33 2015 UTC,"I mostly mean things like the jar, evil containment wave, how Piccolo could be sealed with a simple demon sealing ofuda, the demon summoning he did etc. The other demons just being mutated nameks seemed a little weird to me."
dbz,3d6jvz,suludo,5,Tue Jul 14 03:34:23 2015 UTC,"The demons that Piccolo birthed were literal demons. Piccolo himself was also a real demon, regardless of being an alien. He was an embodiment of pure evil which disregarded life for chaos, wreaking terror on everyone and everything."
dbz,3d6jvz,Djinnji,2,Tue Jul 14 05:43:58 2015 UTC,"I liked how this was addressed in the games as a real ability of the evil priest class. They summon demons to be their minions and fight with them. Poko Priests was an interesting take on the whole  idea and formed a totally separate fighter type outside of just martial artist, sword martial artist, and magic martial artist."
dbz,3d6jvz,petersaints,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:57:22 2015 UTC,"The technique could also seal non-demon beings. So, I see no problem there.  King Piccolo was the evil part of the Nameless Namekian. So, considering him a demon of itself is wrong, but he is demon-like evil. The worse part were really the demon's he spawned from eggs. Well, we can retcon it and consider them Namekian-like demons twisted by King PIccolo's evil. But it is a bit of a stretch."
dbz,3d6jvz,HuhHarding,3,Tue Jul 14 06:11:23 2015 UTC,"King Piccolo was the evil part of the Nameless Namekian. So, considering him a demon of itself is wrong, but he is demon-like evil.    No, Piccolo Daimao is certainly a demon. Kami states in the first arc of Z that people killed by demons are unable to go to the afterlife. He would know this because he literally works guiding souls to the otherworld, and was alive during Piccolo Daimao's first war on humanity during which he slaughtered countless humans."

dbz,3d7djs,Itzie4,6,Tue Jul 14 02:26:57 2015 UTC,"With the direction that the show is going in, I feel that Toriyama and the directors of the show would have already explained something relating to the JSAT. It is not to late to do something like this, but it would be a bit weird. If they do decide explaining something relating to Tarble, I would see either Bulma speaking about Vegeta's brother or possibly something relating to  Spoiler!  I really do not know how I feel about knowing more about Tarble. We never really got any feelings towards him. I felt that he was just one of those characters that come and go. if they do decide on introducing him, it'll be interesting to see how he is presented. As Emma stated, he kind of seemed like pointless character."

dbz,3d7djs,Nickolaus,3,Tue Jul 14 04:47:34 2015 UTC,"I don't see why they'd need to. Super needs to incorporate the movies if it wants to roll with Super Saiyan God and Beerus/Whis. Viewers need to be able to follow the story if they haven't seen the movies.  But if they want to use Tarble, he doesn't need a lot of introduction. Super could retell that story, or they could just have someone say ""oh hey, it's Vegeta's brother again""."
dbz,3d7djs,SJHalflingRanger,9,Tue Jul 14 06:25:22 2015 UTC,"""oh hey, it's Vegeta's brother again"".

Although maybe it only works on bald people."
dbz,3d7djs,drscorp,2,Tue Jul 14 08:36:21 2015 UTC,"I actually think it's possible now that we have the tie to Frieza's army with Resurrection F.  Since they're expanding the movies into arcs I don't doubt that Abo and Kado could be in one the early episodes of the RF arc.  This is a little out there so bear with me but Abo and Kado could serve as distractions while Sorbet and Tagoma are resurrecting Frieza and escaping from Earth  Also Nappa wasn't actually shown in DB Minus  so I took that as a hint that there could be more saiyans off planet, so that Toriyama could leave it open if it ever needed to be revisited.  I understand that it's quite a reach but It's a way to bring Tarble into Super and get rid of the problem concerning Pan. This way Tarble can be used to make Goku into a Super Saiyan God and after a timeskip , Pan can help Vegeta become one too. That is if they're intent on kepping the six saiyan rule."

This ending carried over to the recent Full Color releases, so we'll probably be getting it officially in English several years from now. From Kanzenshuu:   Tankōbon Ending Goku thinks it’s exciting to meet someone so strong, and Uub agrees. As the two zoom by, Goku tells Uub he’ll get even stronger, and Uub says, “Yes!!” Thinking that’s not excited enough, Goku tells him to yell, “Yeah–!!”, and Uub follows suit, as the two disappear off into the distance….  “The great adventure of Goku and his friends, concerning the Dragon Balls! I can only show it to you all up until here, the end… Even after this, there will probably be various troubles, but somehow they’ll surmount them, without a doubt… It’ll be all right, because they’ve got the Dragon Balls…!”  Kanzenban Ending As the two fly along, Goku thinks he has something he should give him, but Uub isn’t sure what he means. Goku calls out, “Kinto-Un!!” The two stop, as Kinto-Un flies up to them. Goku says it’s great to see Kinto-Un, as it’s been so long, and he tells Uub to try getting on. Goku then nonchalantly drops Uub, who is kinda freaking out, onto Kinto-Un. “You got on just fine! Just like I thought!” Goku tells Uub to just think of where he wants to go, and then Kinto-Un suddenly zooms off. Goku follows along, with a big smile, and the two fly off into the distance…  “I am only able to show you the story of Son Goku, his many friends, and the Dragon Balls, up to this point, the end. Even after this, we can probably expect that there will still be various troubles, no different than before. But somehow, they’re definitely going to overcome them… It will be all right, because on Earth, there are some incredible guys…!!”  Back at the Tenka’ichi Budōkai, as the crowd cheers on, Vegeta smirks. “Sooner or later, Kakarrot, I will show you defeat… Hmph!”"

That's why it's so easy to send weak babies like Goku and Tarble off to distant worlds without a second thought.   It could just be a matter for Nappa not considering that Earthlings are usually a bit more attached to whoever they're having kids with than your average Saiyan. He's never been to Earth or met an Earthling. In a Shonen martial arts book like Dragon Ball, I doubt ""Rape Factory"" (read that in TFS Nappa's voice) was on his mind."

dbz,3d6z0q,Vegeto30294,2,Tue Jul 14 00:42:51 2015 UTC,they did that in DBZ too with scenes from dragonball.
dbz,3d6z0q,Old_Crow89,6,Tue Jul 14 01:58:10 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z weren't nearly 20 years apart."

dbz,3d6z0q,Old_Crow89,2,Tue Jul 14 02:10:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I kind of found it jarring as well. But oh well."
dbz,3d6z0q,hennalang,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:06:54 2015 UTC,Saves on the ole animation budget. God knows they need to based on the last scenes of the two episodes so far. The episodes have been gorgeous throughout until the last 5 mins or less at which point it's worse than a 13 year olds flash animation.
dbz,3d6z0q,Cosmodious,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:37:45 2015 UTC,And the preview for the next episode looks like it's gonna be pretty bad compared to the previous 2
dbz,3d6z0q,Cosmodious,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:07:00 2015 UTC,Dammit. I haven't seen it. We're going downhill so soon? I can only hope they're saving on the budget for when the story fully kicks in.
dbz,3d7qud,GigundoCock,4,Tue Jul 14 04:16:21 2015 UTC,"I think he will just remain an enigma. Just never really explaining what he is, as he himself may not even know what he is."
dbz,3d7qud,Mekeji,3,Tue Jul 14 06:34:50 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I kindof think of Whis as a Mr. Popo 2.0. You notice that we never really learn anything about Mr. Popo's background, the character is better when he retains an air of mystery."

dbz,3d5a1m,v3xx,2,Tue Jul 14 23:32:26 2015 UTC,Lol same thing man. They only had like 2 or 3 episodes but I'd watch them over and over until the picture quality turned to crap from the wear.

dbz,3d4dz4,mgs4manj,32,Mon Jul 13 12:49:55 2015 UTC,Frieza was the broly of his race so it only makes sense that he didn't need to train.
dbz,3d4dz4,Xcells,8,Mon Jul 13 13:22:34 2015 UTC,"Akira Toriyama was explicitly asked whether Frieza belongs to a super strong race and he said no, they are unique ""mutated life-forms""  interview source   About how many of Freeza’s race are there? Are they quite thriving, with a big population?  Freeza is what you might call a mutated life-form. Strictly speaking, Freeza’s father is a mutant with an abnormally high battle power. And, born from his father alone, still in strong possession of the mutant traits, was Freeza.  Accordingly, even saying “Freeza’s race”, these two are the only ones who possess an abnormal [level of] battle power and cruelty."
dbz,3d4dz4,Atwenfor,7,Mon Jul 13 13:58:35 2015 UTC,That actually perfectly explains why a Time Patroller of that race can't transform in Xenoverse.
dbz,3d4dz4,thecheat420,3,Mon Jul 13 14:20:11 2015 UTC,Which I wish I would've known before I picked one as my char :/
dbz,3d4dz4,writhinginnoodles,17,Mon Jul 13 16:23:05 2015 UTC,"Frieza's race is just naturally born powerful, they have a mutation in their DNA that make them so powerful i believe has been said to be the reason.    Gohan is half human half saiyan, Frieza is an entirely different race so comparing the two in terms of training is sort of pointless.  I mean, Frieza had to train four months to surpass SSJ 3 and SSJ God I believe (Haven't seen RoF yet) and he was starting out at a power level below SSJ.  All the main saiyans had to train a full year to ascend past SSJ."
dbz,3d4dz4,Triceratastic,12,Mon Jul 13 12:52:33 2015 UTC,Spoiler Rant from RoF  Somewhat related RoF note
dbz,3d4dz4,Zogeta,9,Mon Jul 13 14:46:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of what you said, I thought it was bizarre when it was revealed Frieza trained for four months for this boost in power, and all he says is that he never trained but if he did four months would surpass buu.  He says how Cold would always tell him to beware Beerus and Buu, why beware Buu if you know four months of training is enough to surpass him?  Frieza's men wished him back with dragon balls, I think it would be entirely okay for them to make a wish to be stronger than Goku or something like that.  It seems more practical than what actually happens."
dbz,3d4dz4,Triceratastic,6,Mon Jul 13 15:11:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Man, that would've been a showdown. Power gained va a Shenron wish vs power gained via a Saiyan ritual. Neither gained through training, but it'd be a good excuse for an over the top display of new power."
dbz,3d4dz4,Zogeta,3,Mon Jul 13 16:58:56 2015 UTC,"Shenron doesn't have that power he can't just grant any wish, this was explained in the Xenoverse game. Trunks asked for the power to stop what was happening but Sherin couldn't, but he was able to bring someone who was. And as for Freeza Shenron couldn't fully bring him back he had to revive pieces and his men put him back together."
dbz,3d4dz4,GuntherTime,3,Mon Jul 13 19:26:42 2015 UTC,"It's something that I hope they fix in DBS, really."
dbz,3d4dz4,Ferllys,2,Tue Jul 14 00:24:22 2015 UTC,"Why beware of Buu/Beerus if he can train for 4 months and possibly beat them? Let me ask you, you can go train for a whole year and becomes one of the world's greatest body builders, catch is you need to keep doing it for the rest of your life your else you'll be right back to where you started, also you need to train about 10Hs/day 6 days a week for the whole year, sound good? Personally I'd say 'fuck that shit' I'd rather play games/watch shit and take it easy. Freeza would rather rule his empire than be training all day. Buu? pink slob hasn't been seen in millions of years, Beerus? I get along fine with him so fk it! I doubt he wants to train day in and out like Goku and Vegeta which is also why Gohan gets so weak (since so many people seem to complain about it). Anywho makes sense to me."
dbz,3d4dz4,Zubine,5,Mon Jul 13 19:43:27 2015 UTC,"Let me ask you, you can go train for a whole year and becomes one of the world's greatest body builders, catch is you need to keep doing it for the rest of your life your else you'll be right back to where you started   Honestly if that's all it took I would do that.  If you get into a routine enough of exercising and working out, it becomes second nature and I've only been doing it for 2 years.     also you need to train about 10Hs/day 6 days a week for the whole year, sound good?   Is this Friezas training regiment in the movie? And that doesn't sound so bad considering that empire of his is null and all he is set on is revenge. Besides, a whole year?  Frieza needs four months that is one third of the time in your example.  If I had to train ten hours a day 6 days a week for four months to be the greatest body builder ever you bet your ass I would do that.  I'd have to tack on a few more hours than what I normally do anyways.   Freeza would rather rule his empire than be training all day. Buu? pink slob hasn't been seen in millions of years,    I never said go and hunt down Buu and kill him and neglect what he was doing.  I'm saying if Buu were to show up Frieza is fully aware (and possibly Cold is aware too) that they could beat him if all he had to do was train so why bother to beware of him, unless of course it was to have him beware of his absorption technique.     Beerus? I get along fine with him so fk it!   Never said anything about Beerus in my original comment;  ""He says how Cold would always tell him to beware Beerus and Buu, why beware Buu if you know four months of training is enough to surpass him?    I don't think four months of training would be enough to surpass Beerus anyways.   I doubt he wants to train day in and out like Goku and Vegeta which is also why Gohan gets so weak (since so many people seem to complain about it).   I don't necessarily know Friezas anatomy/physiology but how do you know that he even has to keep up with the training?  For all we know he could train for the four months, stop, and his power level will never go down.  Frieza is his own species besides his father, not a saiyan.  You make some good points to where it makes sense but I still find it more logical just to train when you know you can surpass the only two threats to you.  Who knows, if frieza wanted to maybe he could pass beerus and then become the God of Destruction, thats ruling an empire to the nth degree."
