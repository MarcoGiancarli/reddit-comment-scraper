For me its problematic to consider something that may happen to a white person (say being called a honky) is similar to what happens to all non-white people. This is not a moral judgement or anything like that, assholes are assholes, but rather pointing out 'racism' (even with added descriptors) is a technical term for a reason--racism on for non-whites is fundamentally different from than anything a white person is going to experience in a white dominated society (again even with the added descriptors--personal racism is going to be different if you're in a society that systemically oppresses everyone but people who look like you and so on)."

I mean, if they truly don't believe that white males are more privileged than other groups in the west, who do they think has the power? If not the group that dominates the corporate, political, media spheres then who? The fact that the white male has always been the default archetype representing power is a coincidence?   Unfortunately, one of the privileges of being born in a powerful group is being blind to your own privilege.  I am a white South African, Afrikaner,  and even in our undeniably, terribly unbalanced country, you have trouble convincing people like me that we are not in fact the most downtrodden people of all. We are living comfortably in the white-and-jacaranda suburbs built on the back of a century's subjugation, far above the mean, and yet we refuse to even acknowledge that maybe our society is sick with unearned privileges.   I'm so frustrated with people. It is, in my eyes, an act of pure evil to dismiss inequality for the sake of preserving a false innocence. I am reminded of the MLK quote:  ""First, I must confess that over the last few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action;"" who paternalistically feels he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a ""more convenient season.""

She acknowledges that culture adapts, but doesn't seem to realise that culture doesn't ""progress"" as such, and that it doesn't have to conform with her views to still be legitimate.

BadSocialScience,3d9gow,Anwyl,4,Fri Jul 17 16:30:23 2015 UTC,"More likely it's if you have a level of testosterone higher than what your body regulates for. The body would then increase aromatase activity to get it back to normal level, and that would produce more estrogen, which would then lead to aggression (my opinion/guess, I don't have studies to back that up). In fact, in males, it looks like you could end up in a situation where you have reduced/blocked aromatase, which might cause increased testosterone, but lowered aggression.  Just found another study which analyzed studies on a variety of animals, which TLDR says it's likely that estrogen in male animals causes aggression vs other males, but testosterone level doesn't have any effect.

When people say that men ""can't"" get sex very easily, they always implicitly mean good sex with a woman they actually want to have sex with. For all the talk about men having lower standards, they at least limit themselves to having sex they expect to be enjoyable.  So it's cheating to turn around and suggest that women can easily get laid by lowering their standards, when you're not even willing to consider it in your framing of men's options. All the more so because a bad sexual encounter is both more likely and more dangerous for women in general. In practice, this all amounts to looking at a drunk man aggressively hitting on a woman in a bar and concluding that she has the better position because she could get laid simply by saying yes.

The first thing being described is melting pot dynamics which usually only takes place when the minority is either very small or very similar to the greater population at large.  (e.g. Germans in the US or Scot-Irish in the UK)  The concept is also fairly outdated as the mainstream culture of the US, UK, and many other Western states have far outgrown the simplicity of being ""white"" into a complex sociopolitical thing for the better. Minorities that maintain their own cultural identity are not trying to destroy the host nation and in repeated consistent cases across the Western world, acclimate and succeed in the host country just fine. (e.g. ""model minority"" stereotypes) The claim that multiculturalism destroys the home nation or encourages parasitism has been levied since the late 19th Century against every conceivable minority from vitriol levied at ""hyphenated-Americans"" like French-Americans, Italian-Americans, and Irish-Americans by Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt (the descendant of Dutch-Americans who maintained a distinct identity into the 19th Century) all the way to the present day against Turkish guest workers in Germany, North Africans in France (who took on the French tradition of rioting against unfair conditions fairly adeptly), and Asians in South America. This is a particularly moronic charge from anyone in the more Western states that has benefited from a long history of globalization, purposely importing foreigners (by incentive or force), and dominating the affairs of foreign states.   I still find it odd that ""multiculturalism"" is this apparent dirty word considering how nebulous it can be but hey, if you can't blame Blank-Americans or Blank-Britons for your problems, who can you blame, right?"

Here is a great peer reviewed article about just how shitty his methodology and analysis are: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289609000634  And in case you thought that wasn't harsh enough you can read their response to Lynn's sad attempt to defend himself: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289609001470   I'll quote them, though, for fun:    This suggests that Lynn and Meisenberg excluded samples of Africans who average IQs above 75 because they deemed these samples unrepresentative on the basis of the samples' relatively high IQs. We conclude that Lynn and Meisenberg's unsystematic methods are questionable and their results untrustworthy.   But why stop there? Wicherts is my hero at this point. It is clear Lynn is full of shit but Wicherts isn't letting him get away with anything. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1041608009001071   The majority of studies on IQ test performance of Africans not taken into account by Lynn (and Vanhanen) and Malloy showed considerably higher average IQs than the studies that they did review. We judge the reviews of Lynn (and Vanhanen) and Malloy to be unsystematic. These authors missed a large part of the literature on IQ testing in Africa, failed to explicate their inclusion and exclusion criteria, and made downward errors in the conversion of raw scores to IQs (Wicherts, 2007). Lynn (and Vanhanen)'s estimate of average IQ of Africans of around 67 is untenable. Our review indicates that it is about 78 (UK norms) or 80 (US norms).   And Lynn limps a pathetic response and again Wincherts shuts him down http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S104160801000035X  The sad truth about journals is that anyone can start one. And the editors get to pick the peer reviewers so if they have agendas they can produce ""peer reviewed"" products that are biased pieces of crap. That's why the reputation of a journal matters. Mankind Quarterly's reputation is horrible as it should be. Its founder Robert Gayre literally called African Americans ""worthless"" and was a white supremacist.   But in case you don't believe me let's dig a little deeper into  Gayre's past. While editor of the journal he was part of the Northern League which was a rallying point for (wait for it) NAZIS after the war. Yeah, Nazis. Though don't worry he disagreed with Hitler because he thought that capitalism was too Jewishy. He invited other eugenicists to be honorary editors of the board including R Ruggles Gates who literally thought there were five species of humans he was that into racism. When he died he was replaced on the journal's board with Corrado Gini who was Mussolini's scientific advisor and wrote things for the Reich's journals. The very first issue included an article from Hall arguing that ""Orientals"" shouldn't even be allowed to vote and said they weren't even the same subspecies as white people. And really you can go through the journal and find all kinds of awful obviously racist things. For example, their review of KKK Ernest Servier Cox's book calls it a classic written by a truly great man. There is no doubt whatsoever that Mankind Quarterly is a 100% racist journal and it was from the start. It literally has ties to Nazis and KKK sympathizers.

He made up a story about Morton faking the crania data (which all turned out to be accurate when remeasured recently). He was not a reliable source, and was happy to lie to get people to support his ideology."
BadSocialScience,3cdz2z,babyreadsalot,4,Thu Jul 9 23:37:02 2015 UTC,"You're probably referring to this:   In 2011, a study conducted by six anthropologists reanalyzed Gould's claim that Samuel Morton unconsciously manipulated his skull measurements,[83] and concluded that Gould's analysis was poorly supported and incorrect. They praised Gould for his ""staunch opposition to racism"" but concluded, ""we find that Morton's initial reputation as the objectivist of his era was well-deserved.""[84] Ralph Holloway, one of the co-authors of the study, commented, ""I just didn't trust Gould. ... I had the feeling that his ideological stance was supreme. When the 1996 version of 'The Mismeasure of Man' came and he never even bothered to mention Michael's study, I just felt he was a charlatan.""[85]   ...which is somewhat mitigated by this:   The group's paper was reviewed in the journal Nature, which recommended a degree of caution, stating ""the critique leaves the majority of Gould's work unscathed,"" and notes that ""because they couldn't measure all the skulls, they do not know whether the average cranial capacities that Morton reported represent his sample accurately.""[86] The journal stated that Gould's opposition to racism may have biased his interpretation of Morton's data, but also noted that ""Lewis and his colleagues have their own motivations. Several in the group have an association with the University of Pennsylvania, and have an interest in seeing the valuable but understudied skull collection freed from the stigma of bias.""[86] The group's paper was also criticized by philosopher of science Michael Weisberg, also of the University of Pennsylvania. Weisberg argues that ""most of Gould's arguments against Morton are sound. Although Gould made some errors and overstated his case in a number of places, he provided prima facia evidence, as yet unrefuted, that Morton did indeed mismeasure his skulls in ways that conformed to 19th century racial biases.""[87] Biologists and philosophers Jonathan Kaplan, Massimo Pigliucci, and Joshua Alexander Banta also published a critique of the groups's paper, arguing that many of its claims were misleading and the re-measurements were ""completely irrelevant to an evaluation of Gould's published analysis."" They also argued that the ""methods deployed by Morton and Gould were both inappropriate"" and that ""Gould's statistical analysis of Morton's data is in many ways no better than Morton's own.""[88]   You can say he was wrong about Morton in certain ways, sure, but it's not really clear Gould was an ""outrageous liar."""
BadSocialScience,3cdz2z,thor_moleculez,-2,Fri Jul 10 02:46:15 2015 UTC,"Well, that's not what the anthropology field thinks of what Gould did. Statistically, enough of Morton's data was sampled to show no malfeasance on his part, the same cannot be said of Gould.  John Hawks in particular was pretty scathing, and I agree.  Essentially, what is posted up in wikipedia is not the consensus opinion. The only real explanation is that Gould knew he was fudging the data. In fact, he was challenged a few times about when he had ever checked Morton's data himself (he never responded to this, and no one can find a record of him ever examining the crania himself) and was also asked for his source story about Morton fudging the data, and again wouldn't respond. Modern work has also backed up the Morton work on cranial capacity.  Essentially, that wikipedia entry text is a pretty lame attempt to explain away a really obvious lie by a well meaning but dishonest man who thought the ends justified the means. I don't know an anthropologist who came out in support of Gould when that story broke.   Hawks said:  Gould systematically selected data from Morton’s tables that tended to inflate the measured volumes of Native American crania. He did so by averaging some group means instead of overall means (although Lewis and colleagues show that Morton himself had used group means for many comparisons, contrary to Gould’s claims), by excluding some small-skulled groups entirely (claiming sample size as a criterion), and by omitting crania that had not been measured in the earlier, seed-based analysis. There is no logical reason for these choices other than selection bias – Gould began with a conclusion about Morton’s unconscious motivations, and worked to confirm that conclusion by selecting some data and omitting contrary data.  This stuff really ticks me off. I don’t think that Gould’s errors can be written off as “unconscious bias”. Reading back over his 1978 article, I cannot believe that Science published it.  Also Dienekes comment:  Lewis et al. pretty much demolish both claims. By remeasuring almost half the original skulls studied by Morton, they show that Morton did not inflate ""Caucasian"" cranial volumes at the expense of non-""Caucasians"". Indeed, most of his measurements deviated only a little from those done today, and, in the few cases where large discrepancies were discovered, they were in the opposite direction of Morton's perceived bias.  Weisberg:  Gould's critique of Morton ought to remain as an illustration of implicit bias in science.  Ralph L. Holloway, an expert on human evolution at Columbia:  ""I just didn’t trust Gould,” he said. “I had the feeling that his ideological stance was supreme. When the 1996 version of ‘The Mismeasure of Man’ came and he never even bothered to mention Michael’s study, I just felt he was a charlatan.”  Gould's name is currently dirt."

BadSocialScience,3cdz2z,babyreadsalot,-4,Thu Jul 9 22:20:05 2015 UTC,"You should read citation 88 from the article I linked,   I read it when it came out. In essence Morton measured the crania correctly, Gould's whole claim was that he mismeasured on purpose by packing the seed down in Caucasian skulls, which was apparently made up.  Another issue is the cranial volumes have been backed up in later research which measured brain size. So...Gould, not a reliable source. A liar, a manipulator of data, and slanderer of the dead."
BadSocialScience,3cdz2z,babyreadsalot,9,Thu Jul 9 22:54:01 2015 UTC,"Well, now it's clear to me you didn't actually read the paper, or even Gould for that matter. So first, Gould never accused Morton of purposefully manipulating his data or analyses. Gould only ever said that unconscious bias caused Morton to pack seed when he used it, and to use fudgy statistical analyses (again, unconsciously) to obtain an outcome which jived with his biases. And the paper backs Gould up on this claim (pg. 5, section 5). So it's not clear at all that Gould's claim was ""made up"".  Second, the paper does accuse Gould of the same sort of statistical manipulation Gould accused Morton of (fudgy groupings due to unconscious bias), which is fair enough (pg.5, section 5). Gould is hoisted by his own petard. However, that doesn't mean Gould's criticism of Morton was wrong, only that Gould's own analysis of Morton's data was biased.  Finally, one can only say Gould is a slanderer of the dead if one has not read Mismeasure in an honest way. As the paper states Gould did not think Morton was guilty of scientific misconduct, and in fact Gould praises Morton for his constant worry about bias in his methods. Once again, Gould's project was to show how unconscious bias could spoil even the most careful objectivist's science, and indeed the paper seems to say Gould was successful there.   baby, it seems, does not read a lot"

So that's saying something. I also showed that they have a small sample size, and are mostly non-academic, so that's something too.   EuropeanNationalist2 made great points on this. The sources cited are written by people who have actual experience with science. Would you accept a blog by Dr. James Thompson? He's a doctor, but uses a blog to get information out. Same thing, no?   And several people, some of whom I referenced in OP, claim we do not have the technology or the ability to empirically verify this claim.   I found a paper on PNAS on the matter. I only have enough time to read the abstract and reply to you now, but I'll finish reading it tomorrow and reply to your next reply to me about it.    Genomic surveys in humans identify a large amount of recent positive selection. Using the 3.9-million HapMap SNP dataset, we found that selection has accelerated greatly during the last 40,000 years. We tested the null hypothesis that the observed age distribution of recent positively selected linkage blocks is consistent with a constant rate of adaptive substitution during human evolution. We show that a constant rate high enough to explain the number of recently selected variants would predict (i) site heterozygosity at least 10-fold lower than is observed in humans, (ii) a strong relationship of heterozygosity and local recombination rate, which is not observed in humans, (iii) an implausibly high number of adaptive substitutions between humans and chimpanzees, and (iv) nearly 100 times the observed number of high-frequency linkage disequilibrium blocks. Larger populations generate more new selected mutations, and we show the consistency of the observed data with the historical pattern of human population growth. We consider human demographic growth to be linked with past changes in human cultures and ecologies. Both processes have contributed to the extraordinarily rapid recent genetic evolution of our species.    http://www.pnas.org/content/104/52/20753.full   No, I just don't think that they had a significant behaivour, nor do I think that these differences correspond with what people usually mean when they talk about race. I said in my post ""genetic differences between human populations have likely arisen since the development of agriculture."" Did you even read the whole thing?   Yes I did read the whole piece. So you don't think races differ by behavior? How about cognitive function?   49% isn't most, its as close to most as you can be without being most, but it isn't most. This may be true, I haven't read the article, but if you are going to claim this you should source the article, so I can read it! Don't just be like ""Well Nature said this."" Be like ""Here, look at what Nature has to say on this matter."" There is nothing wrong with saying ""most traits are inheritable"" there is a problem with saying that without discussing what is meant by a trait, and without posting sources.   Eh, it's 50/50. For instance, intelligence is one of the most heritable traits we have. I'm only partly through the paper myself, I'm going to finish reading it tomorrow night.  http://www.gwern.net/docs/2015-polderman.pdf   And I don't believe that. The truth of this proposition does not, however, entail race realism.   How so? It implies that there are differences between races because there are differences depending on where your ancestors evolved.   Probably not. I'd probably link someone more recent. And my goal isn;t to say who is right or wrong, my goal is to critically analyse things and see, at the end of it all, which claims are reasonable and which aren't. I am not the independent, omniscient verifier of knowledge, it's not my place to say whose right or wrong. I do, however, have the ability, through reading widely, to critique arguments, and that is what I am doing.   Well both of them are known frauds. Fair enough on your last point."

I believe in the paper it is referred to as cognitive function. I will finish it tomorrow and let you know. For instance, height is 80 percent heritable and 20 percent controlled by environmental factors.    Where your ancestors evolved =/= race.  Race is used to describe much more than that.

I suppose some of those are kind of valid. But the video then says same sex marriage does none of that.   Because there isn't an overflow of children in the foster-care system already? Or the overpopulation in other countries? Straight people make plenty of extra babies for all the same sex couples who want them.  Same sex couples can't have good homes, apparently. Because reasons.  It protects the woman in a woman-woman marriage if one of them wants to work and the other doesn't.   It keeps men employed in a man-man marriage.

For the philosophically minded, I'm almost led to think of Peirce's trichotomous 'semeiotics' of sign, signified, and interpretant; this is about transforming the audience into witnesses.

I made no demands, I simply suggested that the situation you've found yourself (which you clearly find uncomfortable given your initial hostile response) might be less aversive if you were able to support your claims.   I was personally interested in whether there was any evidence for your positions because, frankly, they sound a little out there. Psychology is my field though so if there was some truth to the claims then it would be incredibly interesting to read the studies.  If we're going to be honest with each other though, we both know that no such studies or data exist, right? And that's fine. Like you say it's a reddit comment and not an essay so you can say whatever you like, it doesn't all have to be evidence-based.

For example, just like psychopaths in general, they are very adept at feigning the empathy they lack when it serves them.

Consider Ivy league-educated executive Pao whining about being subjected to alleged misogynystic banter ... in a fucking private jet. Yeah, women are often mistreated and exploited and victimized. Claiming the victim status of those who are when you yourself aren't is typically narcissistic.

BadSocialScience,3bgipv,SinfulSinnerSinning,16,Mon Jun 29 11:36:01 2015 UTC,"That's what they claim to want. That's not what they actually do. See Christiana Hoff Sommers trying to talk at a university, or feminists pulling a fire alarm to prevent a MRA meeting, and so on.   I'm talking about speech in the more general sense than individuals. There's no problem with telling individuals to shut up, the issue is about whether what they want to say is heard. With people like Sommers and Farrell, what they want to say is extremely common and there's no problem protesting that.    That would be bad science if I was claiming to be doing science, which I'm not. I'm seeing a pattern and pointing it out. I could be wrong. You could be pointing out facts that contradict my hypothesis.   You don't need to explicitly claim to be doing science. You are invoking a scientific diagnostic category and practice in order to make your judgements. It's bad science.  In the same way that if I say a ton of bricks will fall faster than a ton of feathers, I don't get out of my bad science by saying I didn't claim to be doing science. I'm making a scientific claim, I have to be consistent with science.   Instead, you choose to focus on me and the errors of my ways.   At no point have I focused on you or the ""error of your ways"", I'm simply pointing out why your ideas and approach are bad science.  Thinking an attack on your ideas is an attack on yourself is just a little bit narcissistic...   Most of the official diagnostic criterions would require having direct, intimate knowledge of the person. We have to instead rely on the image they project, which in the case of narcissistic people is clearly not the reality. For example, just like psychopaths in general, they are very adept at feigning the empathy they lack when it serves them.   ...Well yeah, that's why it's bad science to try to diagnose someone you've never met. The solution to that bad science isn't ""we can just make vague claims about self-selected data that is forced into our personal biased view of the situation and claim it's evidence!"", and instead the solution is to not diagnose people you've never met.   Incidentally NPDs hardly ever get officially diagnosed as such, willingly anyway, because it's not something they usually suffer from; more like something they make others suffer because of.   Whoopdeedoo. Doesn't make trying to diagnose someone you've never met any better.   Let's look at the DMS-IV criterias (the DSM-V are more abstract)   Okay, hold the phone a second. The DSM5 isn't ""more abstract"", it's more rigorous and clear in its definitions, that's why there was a change. Specifically it was changed so that it would be more accurate and rule out problems like false positives or casting too broad a net.  And you want to ignore that in favour of the less accurate and outdated version of the diagnostic manual? In other words, you're saying that you can only prove your point if you use an inaccurate diagnostic manual? Okay, we're off to a good start.   (1) has a grandiose sense of self-importance I find it always amusing how SJWs carry such grotesque causes as manspreading or microaggressions as if they were a modern day Rosa Park or Spartacus. Who else does that?   Microaggression is very real scientific issue and is an example of a very persuasive and harmful bigoted action in society. What ""SJWs"" will tell you is that trying to play oppression olympics is stupid so there's no need to compare it to Rosa Parks but it's undeniably a serious issue in society. As with ""manspreading"", it's mostly a funny name for a real demonstration of privilege (another scientific concept) in society. We can debate how serious the specific instance is but nobody is saying that there's a serious problem because men occupy more space than they need to, but rather it's an example of a wider issue.   Importantly, even if your claims weren't contradicted by science in this case, your examples have absolutely nothing to do with grandiosity. They aren't exaggerating their achievements or anything we'd expect from someone with grandiose beliefs.   (2) is preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love, (3) believes that he or she is ""special"" and unique and can only be understood by, or should associate with, other special or high-status people (or institutions) and (4) requires excessive admiration. This fits perfectly with the description of social dominants by Altemeyer.   Altemeyer's description of social dominants ruled out what we'd think of as ""SJWs"" but, more importantly, you can't lump criteria together. They're supposed to be independent of one another.  Also your categories aren't at all representative of ""SJWs"" (god I can't believe people use that term seriously). Generally these people aren't interested in success or power and are actively fighting against success and power, they explicitly state and believe that they aren't special and are part of a larger group, and they reject admiration in favour of actual change.   So you're gonna have to find some specific examples that are all independent of each other.   (5) has a sense of entitlement, i.e., unreasonable expectations of especially favorable treatment or automatic compliance with his or her expectations, (6) is interpersonally exploitative, i.e., takes advantage of others to achieve his or her own ends The appropriation of the suffering of others towards obtaining social dominance is extremely typical of SJWs. Consider Ivy league-educated executive Pao whining about being subjected to alleged misogynystic banter ... in a fucking private jet. Yeah, women are often mistreated and exploited and victimized. Claiming the victim status of those who are when you yourself aren't is typically narcissistic.   Again, they need to be independent but ""SJWs"" don't have unreasonable expectations, their demands are just to be treated with basic respect and dignity. And I haven't seen any examples of them being exploitative.  Your example of Pao is just hilariously wrong.. How does being economically privileged affect her experience of lacking male privilege? Because she's rich are you saying that people treat her like a man and don't do things like direct gendered slurs at her?  Plus Pao is awesome, do you remember when she banned FPH? That was a glorious day filled with the tears of bigots.   (8) is often envious of others or believes that others are envious of him or her and (9) shows arrogant, haughty behaviors or attitudes -- gamergaters are virgin neckbeard rapists who can't get laid and are jealous proud womyn are stealing their hobby, or so I've heard.   Again, not independent but your example doesn't relate to the criteria at all.   And after all that, when we take into account that you can't double up examples using diagnostic criteria, we find that even if every example was true you've only found 4 criteria to fit. You need 5. You've demonstrated that they don't fit the diagnostic criteria."

It'd be like being for gun control and accusing all gun owners of being mass murders. Actually, at least that would be relevant, albeit false, addition to the argument.

But one question that keeps bothering me is: How does post structuralism differ from post-modernism? And more specifically how is it affected social science? Most of the literature seems to focused on art and while interesting not exactly what i'm looking for..."
BadSocialScience,3bgipv,Atropa_belladona,2,Thu Jul 2 04:08:12 2015 UTC,"This is a bit late now, but I might be able to explain some of it.  Post-modernism is a period of thought that began somewhere in the early-to-mid 20th-century, depending on who you ask, that acted in reaction against the previous period of modernism and affected the methodology used in the arts, social sciences, and philosophy. I don't really understand it much myself, but it's in the same vein that Romanticism was to Enlightenment-era Neoclassicism. Basically, it was an all-encompassing zeitgeist that affected how people thought about things and saw the world.  Post-structuralism, however, is a more specific term applied to a philosophical movement that occurred primarily in France from the 1960s that rejected and reformulated the ideas proposed by the Structuralist thinkers that preceded them, most notably Swiss Linguist Ferdinand de Saussure. Many post-structuralist thinkers, like Jacques Derrida, Roland Barthes, and Jacques Lacan, wrote extensively in response to Saussure's linguistics, making drastic changes to its original intentions and boundaries. Other philosophers who were called post-structuralists (almost no prominent post-structuralist was actually willing to apply to the term to themselves) included figures like Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze, whose works directly challenged much of the thought that had come before them and proposed a totally new understanding of the fields they wrote about (politics and history for Foucault, ethics and metaphysics for Deleuze).  One of the hardest things about trying to read about post-structuralists is that much of post-structuralist philosophy involved the criticism of all language, including the language post-structuralists speak and write in, meaning that there is a need to invent language and grammar so as not to fall into the traps that they themselves point out that we fall into when we try to stick to ordinary language, though there are critics who say that this is just an excuse to be deliberately vague and not say anything.  The difference between the two is that post-modernism is the movement in thought that affected the post-structuralist tradition. Post-structuralism is all post-modern, but post-modernism isn't all post-structuralist. Structuralism itself is arguably a post-modern philosophical tradition as well.  That's my understanding, at least."

BadSocialScience,3a1w0r,twittgenstein,11,Tue Jun 16 16:11:16 2015 UTC,"The problem here, in case it isn't obvious, is that McCants seems to view society as the sum of a series of linear causal relationships: since Islamic texts have supposedly remained constant but Muslim political behaviour has changed, non-textual variables must determine that variance in Muslim political behaviour.    This is an exemplary illustration of what Andrew Abbott called 'general linear reality' in this superb article. And for all his criticism of AHA's causal story, McCants' own view is thus deeply flawed.    Theology (the interpretation of texts) is an interaction between the text and the interpreter. Changing dominant movements in Islamic theology, which may include seriously reframing what texts are considered to be in a fundamental sense, may have all sorts of reverberating political effects, because theology is implicated in other aspects of culture.    We could also push back at McCants for even claiming that scripture remains constant simply because the squiggles on the page do, since the meaning of those squiggles is itself a dynamic, historically situated product of interpretation, but we don't even have to go so 'po-mo' to see the problems in his social ontology"

BadSocialScience,39yi4b,Vladith,8,Fri Jun 19 02:36:33 2015 UTC,"The left right dichotomy describes, and only describes, an ideological groups view on the nature of social stratification; specifically, whether or not it is necessary, good, etc. It is typical to perceive faction in that way first but that's  just a result of the political framework brought on by western modernity.  But the point is, it's purpose is limited to talk of social stratification.   Nazi Germany and the USSR were both bureaucratic, hierarchical, killing machines, fine. But the left-right spectrum doesn't describe an ideologies propensity to build bureaucracy, or kill millions, or justify structural hierarchies. Being similar in action doesn't need a special theory and does not conflict with the left right dichotomy at all, it's just politics.   So yea, when people bend the political spectrum into that stupid enraging horseshoe they are either saying:   That the far left and far right have similar views on the nature of social stratification.    Which is absolutely ridiculous and completely wrong.  Or that a persons view on the nature of social stratification is a dominant, or even significant, factor in determining the way ideological groups or individuals deal with practical, real life, issues.   Which distorts the purpose of the left right spectrum and literally contradicts all but the most basic understanding of post-enlightenment history."

I guess an example would be how white supremacist rhetoric about a Jewish conspiracy is worded very similarly to many progressive arguments about corporate dominance: a feeling of helplessness about being ""ruled"" by an alien group and a belief that members of this group are unequivocally equal.   To speak more generally, I feel like the horseshoe theory (or at least as it appears in casual online discourse) means that ideologically opposed groups are not similar in thought or theory, but are similar in practice. For instance, the political killings by both Castro and Pinochet.  I don't believe that these recurring similarities really suggest anything (except maybe that people tend to behave similarly regardless of political belief), because more often than not, self-described left-wing and right-wing governments or movements are not very similar. But do you find it harmful to point out instances in which they may be?"

I find it harmful because it reinforces a distorted view of political socialization and action as being dominated one's place on the left-right spectrum. I don't disagree with what you are saying; I, and most people in the field of political science, disagree with the fact that it's not treated as a truism. Because that is really what it is: a non-statement. It does not help anyone understand politics, it doesn't explain anything, it's just an edgy statement based on a misconception of what the political spectrum is supposed to be. Any semblance of meaning or usefulness is a result of it patching a hole in someones flawed understanding of political science."

But even it completely skips over the idea that one's view on the nature of social stratification has any effect on the propensity to become a tyrant (it's about the formation of tyrannies). It's understood to be no more relevant to the discussion than Hitler and Stalin's favorite ice cream flavor. When he goes on to argue that certain traits, political climates, idiologies, leaders, etc lead to tyrannies more easily, the traits, ideologies, and leaders are coincidentally pretty evenly divided between left and right leaning groups.  Some people will look to that as meaningful but a political scientist would tell you to stop looking through such a small window. After all, plotting those traits on a far-chocolate to far-vanilla spectrum would give you a similar distribution. And it would be technically correct to say that chocolate lovers often act like vanilla lovers. But the lack of correlation between ice cream flavor and tyranny is much less important to the actual causes of tyrannies."

BadSocialScience,39wunv,firedrops,29,Mon Jun 15 13:28:28 2015 UTC,"In China there seems to clearly be a lack of empathy understood between people and therefore their everyday actions cause distress to others not directly associated with kinship or social circle. For example queuing is a common activity in most societies and politeness tells us that we should wait, take our turn and be patient... In time they take on the cognitive social rules internally and apply them in their own situations through behaviour, this is the beginning of an understanding of empathy. So why then in China do people push-in, ignore others when entering buses, trains, the metro excreta? Why do they read a newspaper in a crowded trains causing others to be uncomfortable, inconvenienced or pushed aside? Why do they shrug their shoulders at others distress or misfortune?   Queuing is very western behavior as evidenced by all the distressed colonialists having to teach the colonies how to line up properly. If forming a line is proof of empathy then most of the world lacks it. Plus, he is conflating empathy with learned social norms. People don't line up because they feel deep empathy with the person in front of them.   Their methods are literally just that they talked to an unspecified number of Chinese people (language used and translator not mentioned) about recent events.    When Westerners were asked the same question almost all replied the passenger would feel, scared, guilty, fearful of consequences and sorry about the victim. When this was pointed out to the Chinese respondent - they often shrugged their shoulders and replied how would you know this? ... When [random Chinese people were] asked about how they felt about the people's plight, most gave stereotypical answers that they recited from Government state issued sentiments and media sound bites. In other words - they were not feeling but simply reciting the sentiments they had been hearing from the media.   And the westerners responses weren't stock answers? Really? We say oh it is a tragedy often because it is what we should say not because we personally feel grief. Cultural norms about whether we should pretend to know other's grief doesn't indicate actual empathy or lack thereof. (Not to mention the work of people like Kleinman that show PTSD and serious depressive issues in china in response to such events.)   He tries to analyze this utilizing social impact theory but it is very superficially applied. His real explanation seems to be:   The one child policy has many social problems but in the case of empathy the author points out why a lone child growing up in a home with adults only can lack the social skill of empathy when dealing with adult situations later in life. In the West where two of more children grow up together as siblings, many social lessons are learned through observation.   For real they are making the argument that only children lack empathy. Typically most arguments about Chinese ways of being make some communal argument (see the rice vs wheat cultivation line of thinking.) I have to admit I at least give props for being creative enough to argue Chinese people are too socially isolated to develop empathy.  It goes on and is so full of bias and poor research methods that I could quote the entire thing. The scary thing is this guy has a PhD in psychology and actually treats patients in China."

She was upset because she thought it was purposefully mean or uncaring, while he just was responding with a pretty stock response. C'est la vie. This is life, no?  But whenever family has died I eventually get annoyed at the platitudes. I'd prefer the honest response even if it is just no response.

I live in Shanghai and I realized someone I just hired is basically racist in the same sense as this guy. They have the culture all figured out and sorted into what is good and bad. It's got me worried about my own view of things here, as I have some polarized opinions on things.  For the queuing part he is describing something that generally occurs, but ignores that it is not consistent across the country, or even within Shanghai. I sit through an orderly line up every day at the dumpling place, or Starbucks, near my home.  I've also lived in other places where there is a fairly large Chinese expat community, and you see people adapt to local norms with more or less the same rate as people from anywhere else.  I get where he might be coming from because there are things here that I don't like, but it crosses the line to justify a dislike by pinning it to something inherently wrong with the people or culture."
BadSocialScience,39wunv,SnapshillBot,2,Tue Jun 16 07:16:13 2015 UTC,"Everyone has culture shock when they move to another country. A well informed traveler is usually less impacted by the big things (language, environment, food) and more impacted by the small everyday things like manners, body language, attitudes towards time, etc. Those build up and it can be refreshing to step into a space where things and people seem to act ""right"" even if you can't always put your finger on it.  That's OK as long as you're aware of yourself enough to know it is more about habitus than good or bad.   I suppose the classic example of culture shock gone bad is Malinowski. WWI started while he was doing fieldwork and being Austrian the Australian authorities were suspicious. So the arrangement was he could do ethnographic fieldwork in their territories but was basically under island arrest - he couldn't go home. And so the long term fieldwork method was born! But it was rough on him. He also decided to read Heart of Darkness while in the field which perhaps isn't the most empathetic book to be reading while trapped amongst ""the natives."" In his journal he said:    I see the life of the natives as utterly devoid of interest or importance, something as remote from me as the life of a dog.    And    At moments I was furious with them, particularly because after I gave them their portions of tabacco they all went away.  On the whole my feelings toward the natives are decidedly tending to ‘Exterminate the brutes,’    (Exterminate the brutes is a quote from heart of darkness)  On the one hand it is his journal, he was trapped, and he's experiencing the exhausting disassociation with surrounding culture that many do. On the other hand, he's clearly done and no longer able to academically understand what he's experiencing because he's too overwhelmed. And even giving excuses for the times it is not the kind of thing you expect from the father of modern ethnography. Later, of course, he left and was able to write some very compelling and not laden with racism classic pieces. But in those moments if he or anyone tries to make sense of what they are experiencing it will be too thick with their own bias to really be useful or fair."

Think about this for more than two seconds: how does it make any sense from an evolutionary or biological standpoint for a man to impregnate many women? Babies are not easy. They're helpless and require at least 1 1/2 years of dedicated work to get them even close to a surviving age. Does it really make sense for the man to pump it and run? No, he would want to stay and make sure his offspring lives.   Because the point of evolution isn't about reproduction, which is what you think, it's about survival. Impregnating 1,000 women means jack shit if all 1,000 of those babies die.  And women are promiscuous too. It's not like women hate sex. There's a reason for the clitoris and there's a reason for the female orgasm; women enjoy sex. It's not women sizing up potential mates and deigning them to enter her vagina. She gets just as much pleasure as the guy does (maybe not with you and your ilk, though, since you seem to think that men and women are so diametrically opposed that we can be summed up in two words or so) so why would she not be trying to get pleasure?   Because sex isn't just about babies. It's never been just about babies for us. It's a bonding action and it's just as much social as it is reproductive. Take a look at bonobos the next time you get the chance and see just how often they fuck. Hint: It's just as much as humans, which is to say all the goddamn time.

BadSocialScience,39lc7j,Tiako,2,Fri Jun 12 22:39:08 2015 UTC,"This is probably an ill-formed thought due to it being maybe over a year since I've given Bourdieu's corpus corpse rigorous rigor mortis thought:  I always, at the very least, appreciated how in Bourdieu's attempt at a post-structuralism, that he preserved some of the nice elements of thinking about structures, while making room for individual ""improvisation"" or conscientious negotiation on the rules, the forces, or the social whatever. The habitus seems to be in us, but it isn't us. And because of that, in a way (not entirely unrelated to our other discussion on Hacking) knowledge of habitus seems to produce effects on how we think and act in a way that produces a renewal or growth of habitus. Maybe that's nonsense, but I do think that unlike a lot of preceeding social theory, it allows for a kind of intelligence in our being social that often seems missing.  lol, also apropos to the other thread, I totally just remembered that one of the first paragraphs in An Outline of a Theory of Practice talks explicitly about how anthropologists use the metaphor of a map to talk about culture. Ha!"
BadSocialScience,39lc7j,olddoc,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:48:58 2015 UTC,"Right, but the individual improvisation is confined to tactical manoeuvring. I'd say that Bourdieu is not able to grasp transformative or creative potential as a result, and this is a major deficit of his approach.  I'd put it like this. It's actually really in the dispositional qualities of Bourdieu's 'habitus' are really where the most interesting ontological action (so to speak) seems to me taking place, at least in terms of getting beyond struturalism. It's nothing new to imagine that the mind consists of some reflection of one's social position, or that knowledge is inscribed onto the knower through social conditioning. What makes Bourdieu's approach interesting is that mind, that inscribed knowledge, takes the form of a set of action potentials or propensities oriented around certain activating circumstances. This is the dispositional aspect of habitus: a dispositional theory of the causal origins of action, quasi-intentional because directed at the world but sub-representational because not born of conscious reflection.  This raises all sorts of ontological questions, like what the epistemic status of 'habitus' is (Bourdieu wants to be a realist but I am sceptical that this could refer to a natural kind), whether it makes sense to distinguish habitus from the practices in which it is supposedly instantiated, and how disposition itself arises as a distinct property that some kinds of social structures (qua habitus) possess but others don't.  But all that said, by assigning this pivotal role to dispositions, Bourdieu is getting away from the idealism of the French structuralist tradition from which he emerged, providing an explanation for how structures produce tangible and self-reproducing action without falling into the reductionism of Marxian materialism. Whether he succeeds or whether he ends up committing the worst sins of both is a matter for debate."
BadSocialScience,39lc7j,olddoc,2,Sat Jun 13 00:18:28 2015 UTC,"I mean in all seriousness, I don't think that's quite it either, though you're at least bringing in dispositional qualities. Habitus is, simply speaking, the socially conditioned register of pragmatic dispositions. We can unpack this more, of course. By disposition we mean something like 'a directedness towards the world and a propensity to act upon it'. By pragmatic we mean things like the cognitive and performative tasks of sorting, manipulating, interacting, and the like. It's actually not that hard of a concept to figure out. It only gets complicated when we try to explain things like creativity or transformation, because of some of the problems in conceptualising agency under a still-structuralist view of the subject (however admirably corporealised)."
BadSocialScience,39lc7j,firedrops,2,Fri Jun 12 19:29:23 2015 UTC,"I also don't think that definition above is quite right. I just remember Bourdieu as: Positions plus dispositions cause practices. Or ""structure + habitus = practice"". So habitus is nearly synonymous with dispositions, but these are shaped by the outside social positions as you perceive, experience and internalize them.      Then Bourdieu also does his big reflexive trick, where he stresses how you must always be conscious of your own dispositions when observing other people, because they colour your way of looking and classifying."

This person has a terribly poor understanding of Gnosticism in general and apparently no understanding of the historical context in which it arose. His ""anti-gnostic sensors were tingling"" and my anti-ignorance sensors were through the roof."
BadSocialScience,39gqz0,expanj,2,Fri Jun 12 05:55:52 2015 UTC,Could you elucidate a little more?
BadSocialScience,39gqz0,shannondoah,4,Fri Jun 12 07:16:33 2015 UTC,"My objections are in two parts, I guess:    1) On a very basic level, I think he covers Gnosticism in an okay sort of way, but because Gnosticism was eradicated when it was so young, there was never really an established canon, theology, or philosophy that could be considered ""Gnosticism,"" so while his overview is somewhat accurate if you were trying to introduce someone to Gnosticism, it seems too simplistic to base an entire contemporary argument off it, in my opinion. 2) But what I really take issue with is his appeal to ""Biblical religion"" and how he imposes the biblical canon as it stands now on Gnosticism (which is both problematic and misleading to his audience). When Gnosticism was alive and well there was no established canon, and they had so many additional texts that did support what they believed. Even Irenaeus could not have claimed to be following ""Biblical religion"" because there was no set ""Bible"" for him to refer to.    Basically, I just found his argument a bit sloppy, because while he claimed to know something about the history of the early church, he completely ignored the history of the biblical canon and the existence of numerous other gospels and texts with competing authorities that the Gnostics (and Irenaeus) would have had access to and would have had reason to give credence to."

BadSocialScience,39gqz0,expanj,2,Fri Jun 12 07:43:28 2015 UTC,"We certainly have enough of an understanding of gnostic teachings to discuss it in a brief article, and there doesn't seem to be much to object to in his characterization of it outside maybe the voegelin-like assertion that gnosticism rearose in the early modern period. There is no augustine of Gnosticism, sure, but that doesn't stop us from saying what they thought about the material world and spirituality, which is what his brief citing of irenaeus is doing.   And I'm not sure what your second point is, that Revelations, the Deuterocanonical works and a few others were up in the air until ecumenical councils doesn't mean by the second century there wasn't a clear acknowledgement of the Gospels and epistles as the central scriptures of a developing orthodoxy. Irenaeus couldn't have written Against Heresies if there wasn't an orthodox theology these heresies and their (far newer, decidedly fabricated) scriptures were starkly breaking from. He wasn't ""biblical"" in a strict, almost protestant sense, but he was the heir to an at least somewhat continuous Christian philosophical and ecclesiastical tradition that the gnostics were not, but borrowed from."

BadSocialScience,39dnzt,queerbees,56,Thu Jun 11 02:29:13 2015 UTC,"Interestingly describing the reaction as a 'tantrum' makes it easy to frame this in behavioral science terms, in that what we're seeing is an extinction burst. When you cut off the reinforcement that is maintaining a behavior you tend to see the behavior get worse in frequency or intensity before it eventually fizzles out.   This is why when you are teaching your kid that crying in a store doesn't get them the chocolate bar they want, they don't immediately stop crying but instead throw a bigger tantrum. Eventually though, the behavior stops completely.   In summary, fatpeoplehaters are big babies and science says they'll shut up pretty soon."
BadSocialScience,39dnzt,completely-ineffable,28,Thu Jun 11 04:01:30 2015 UTC,"Well, the thing with GG is that it was this vague issue with some women somewhere about video games.

BadSocialScience,39dnzt,deathpigeonx,22,Thu Jun 11 20:15:22 2015 UTC,"Since low-hanging fruit is allowed I may as well get past the KiA ban while I'm at it. This beauty showed up on KiA shortly after it was announced that Reddit had removed several subreddits for harassment. The short version is KiA feels Reddit is trying to gentrify itself by banning content that women and minorities (skeletons) would find objectionable, pushing out white non-cuckolded heterosexual males in the process.  The OP is just a screenshot of a comment that makes lots of vague claims; they claim to have work for an unnamed advertising firm contracted to a company that only worked with an ill-defined demographic called ""skeletons"" and ""low-status males"". They claim that the banning of FPH et al is part of a business strategy by Reddit and 4chan to cater to women in order to make the site more profitable, equating it to a sort of gentrification -- which means gentrification joins cultural appropriation and colonization in the list of terms that GG has misappropriated to advance a bad cause.  The reasoning itself is fairly sexist, the commenter argues that women are a more attractive demographic for Reddit and 4chan because they're too stupid to navigate to Chrome's web store and download Adblock, he then fellates the mediocre technical abilities of redditeurs because they can use VPN, piratebay, and google. He's already identified reddit and 4chan as high-traffic areas of the web, and any marketer should be able to tell you what a risky move alienating an existing customer base in favor of an unproven one is, but I have doubts this guy actually works in marketing.   That's not really the reason I'm posting it, the comment itself is five months old but KiA's use of it is ridiculous. Gentrification doesn't work like that, it's not a conscious internal decision made by a committee of interested parties to sell the neighborhood off to wealthy people for greater profits, nothing about that analogy actually works. If anything, it could be said that perhaps Reddit is selling out, maybe. It's certainly true that the old ""lawless"" days of the internet never were profitable and with the internet having long since attained mass appeal there's a push for companies to sanitize content to make it more profitable. This is not a feminist or skeleton thing, people in the real world live by certain socially enforced expectations of politeness and civility, expectations that makes the never-ending shitshow of reddit unappealing. Instead of seeing the writing on the wall and working as a business does, KiA would rather 4chan and reddit cleaved to the status quo and remained Fisher Kings of vanishingly small Fisher Kingdoms.  There's some other ridiculous stuff that annoyed me about the comment, particularly deriding ""skeletons"" as bigoted in a thread defending fatpeoplehate and transfags. There's another pot calling the kettle black moment when the commenter mocks ""skeletons"" as consumerist, equating the purchasing of t-shirts with a ""pro-feminist message"" to buying things like American flag bandannas or patriotic t-shirts. That may be true, but I don't see how it's functionally different from buying a headcrab plush hat, a t-shirt with Mario on it, or any of the pro-GamerGate merchandise that gets sold. Gamers calling anyone consumerist is probably going to go down as one of the most tone deaf things I've ever heard."

Unfortunately my copy of Les régles de l'art is just that: in french, and I've been trying to improve my french comprehension to the point that I can read it.

I had never actually made that overt connection of Bourdieu's figures as being cartographic, though I suppose it's not that subtle with him always calling them ""fields"" and such. I didn't want to add a fuel to our ""art historian's"" fire, but I do remember this figure from The Field of Cultural Production seeming somewhat less obvious than I would have liked it to be.

As for Hacking, I've just started on this compendium, so I have no thoughts yet other than that I am feeling very friendly to his views. I will head to the coffee shop in a bit to read more of it, so I'll let you know then. The only niggling concern I currently have is that he seems quick to dissolve, or claim that we have sort of 'move passed', some debates in philosophy which I understand to still be ongoing. I am reading him mainly with my philosophy of science hat on, though. What did you find him helpful for?"

Oh, um, because philosophy is not my main bag, I actually find that his ease of slipping the contributions of history in his philosophical work a smooth read. Though, this might be part of his quickness to dissolve ongoing debates. I don't know if this is one of those debates, but I've rather enjoyed how constructive he is in a post-disunity of science kind of way. (In fact, my own take on disunity is less philosophical and more ""empirical,"" I guess, so him not laboring on the point is okay with me).  I think it's in the title essay, but somewhere he makes the point that very many of our categories for people take form in this way where they simultaneously become self-conscious for those within it and coalesce for those without. In a way, he takes some of the stronger points from Foucault and casts them differently, so in a way it's much smoother (it feels less like sudden discontinuities). It gives me the feeling that the whole knowledge/power connection becomes a little more democratic and a little closer to the ground, socially speaking. Because his ""looping effect"" of social sciences brings the subjects and objects closer, it makes for a more interesting account of things like mental illness and sexuality; which in the 21st century are deviancies that exist on throughout society. Just taking for example, the category of ADD or autism, we have now an entire generation of people who grew up in these categories now entering into society with (arguably) technically informed experiences. They are not only subject to the knowledge of disability, but can speak on it, they can create it. I don't think it is entirely different from how Hacking finds multiple personality disorder emerging (or being ""made up"") in this ""dynamic nominalism."" But I haven't read the essay in over a year or so, so now I feel like I need to pick it back up!"

And this is a good observation about what he's doing with Foucault; basically, he's (in a manifestly pragmatist manner) locating agency and reflexivity in the discursive formations and practices that Foucault would have seen as wholly dominating and producing their subjects.

And this semester, it wasn't always said as some statement of fact, that sociologists do suffer this, but as a normative statement/prescription, that it would be good/helpful if we suffered this.

Sadly it is still raised by naive positivist and realist types in the social sciences, who still see experimentation or the analysis of huge datasets as the sine qua non of good science full stop.    Happily I find that if you describe your approach as historical sociology, people assume you're a lost cause and leave you alone. I just have to make sure I kick the habit of doing this by the time I'm on the market. As it happens, though, the lone sociologist I have on my committee is a hardcore neopositivist.

It was pretty funny to me because Bourdieu is held in very high esteem by the bureaucrats and art school teachers. And: What's the point in laughing at 4chan? It isn't supposed to be good. That I said there as well.  to Huntington: He got barred from the NAS for using pseudomathematics, for writing equasions with things you can't quantify. And bourdieu does the same: you have a cartesian diagram with the semblance of three linear functions. But they don't relate time to anything. The ordinate is vacant. Apparently this kind of bullshit is suggestive of something so deep Galious couldn't stop to keep providing new interpretations in the thread, which was funny as well.   And Huntington did the very same thing: he painted pseudo-equasions suggestive of something deep (to people who haven't had basic analysis in high school) but actually perfectly meaningless. He was doing pseudomathematics on purpose, like Leibnitz with his ""donc il existe"". He was doing that to give random banal claims the semblance of science and keep the mathematically illiterate people shut up. In other words: he was using mathematics ""as a witch doctor's incantation"" and the National Academy of Sciences of US America didn't like it at all.    I mean, it's pretty clear you didn't get it from the actual source.   What made you think so? I love art history when it's good. When it's S.M.Volkov telling you what happened to all of the sculptors, painters and composers from the 1910s until the 1970s in Russia. His book is called ""the Magical Chorus"". I also loved ""Back to the USSR"" by Artemy Troitsky. It is about the unrecognized and banned arts (rock music; fashion costumes; random dadaism onstage) in Russia from the post-war era to the fall of the USSR. This is good art history.  Then I read a book each on rock & chanson and on the comic books in France and I didn't like either one so much, because the authors spent way too much time trying to distill some Lenin style «laws of history» (or: Shklovsky style «laws of art») and near to nothing on the stories (except some anecdotes cherrypicked to fit their ""laws""). Both books were citing Bourdieu a lot so I have tried to read him as well. Disappointment. In the linked example he does not say anything at all.   But such bad art historians as Galious are, as you can see, always ready to strip it into random universal laws, like: ""first comes one generation, and then another""."

I'm a bit flummoxed considering he literally wrote books about it and the academic web is littered with summaries and quotes explaining it for undergrads. Example: http://faculty.washington.edu/cbehler/glossary/habitus.html  He of course is appropriating the term from thinkers as varied as Aristotle and Durkheim so you may need to actually read his work to understand how he used the term. But really he might be long winded but he isn't obtuse. Even if you haven't read Durkheim and Mauss for the context of the conversation you should be able to figure it out.

I just figured that was easier than telling you to go read a book passage when you might not own that book. But here are some relevant quotes:    Habitus is, ""society written into the body, into the biological individual"" (Bourdieu, 1990 In Other Words, p. 63).  It is a ""...system of acquired dispositions functioning on the practical level as categories of perception and assessment or as classificatory principles as well as being the organizing principles of action...Constructing the notion of habitus as a system of acquired dispositions functioning on the practical level as categories of perception and assessment or as classificatory principles as well as being the organizing principles of action meant constituting the social agent in his true role as the practical operator of the construction of objects."" (Bourdieu, 1990 In Other Words, pp 12-13).   Also relevant is his concept of hexis which is the expression of habitus. See:    If all societies … set such store on the seemingly most insignificant details of dress, bearing, physical and verbal manners, the reason is that, treating the body as a memory, they entrust to it in abbreviated and practical, i.e. mnemonic, form the fundamental principles of the arbitary content of culture. The principles embodied in this way are placed beyond the grasp of consciousness, and hence cannot be touched by voluntary, deliberate transformation, cannot even be made explicit; nothing seems more ineffable, more incommunicable, more intimable,. and therefore more precious, than the values given body, made body by the transsubstantiation achieved by the hidden persuasion of an implicit pedagogy, capable of instilling a whole cosmology, an ethic, a metaphysic, a political philosophy, through injunctions as insignificant as ‘stand up straight’ or ‘don’t hold your knife in your left hand’. (Bourdieu, 1977 Outline of a Theory of Practice pp 94)    Of course in In Other Words and in Distinction and in Outline of a Theory of Practice he goes on to explain how it is a transferable skill, is durable, distinguishes class & ethnicity, and is both structured and structuring. I can't quote entire books here though so if you want to debate Bourdieu it would help if you picked out some points where you think he's wrong or confusing."
BadSocialScience,39aty9,Galious,9,Thu Jun 11 12:33:13 2015 UTC,"Habitus: a classificatory scheme that's built up from the way we get classified.

Most people who bring up violence in gender debates (on reddit) usually assert the opposite. ""Black & Middle Eastern"" is ranked as the most oppressed racial groups.

BadSocialScience,38kyjz,Goatf00t,2,Fri Jun 5 20:38:08 2015 UTC,"Geek show:       Geek shows were an act in traveling carnivals and circuses of early America and were often part of a larger sideshow.  The Online Etymology Dictionary give the following for ""geek"": ""sideshow freak,"" 1916, U.S. carnival and circus slang, perhaps a variant of geck ""a fool, dupe, simpleton"" (1510s), apparently from Low Ger. geck, from an imitative verb found in North Sea Germanic and Scandinavian meaning ""to croak, cackle,"" and also ""to mock, cheat."" The modern form and the popular use with reference to circus sideshow ""wild men"" is from 1946, in William Lindsay Gresham's novel Nightmare Alley (made into a film in 1947 starring Tyrone Power).  The billed performer's act consisted of a single geek, who stood in center ring to chase live chickens. It ended with the performer biting the chickens' heads off and swallowing them.  The geek shows were often used as openers for what are commonly known as freak shows. It was a matter of pride among circus and carnival professionals not to have traveled with a troupe that included geeks. Geeks were sometimes alcoholics or drug addicts, and could be paid with liquor – especially during Prohibition – or with narcotics.

Yeah, nothing's going to pass.   Any referendum in the Free Republic of Liberland shall be conducted online via the Internet.

No law shall establish the institution of slavery, conscription, indenture, or any other form of involuntary servitude other than the Jury duty   ""Jury duty's slavery, but it's the only kind we're going to accept, guys.""

BadSocialScience,38an4z,Snugglerific,3,Wed Jun 3 00:54:37 2015 UTC,Moral/cultural relativism is one of those issues that ends being good social science but bad philosophy. If i'm not mistaken the first proponents of moral relativism were anthropologists.    http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-relativism/

BadSocialScience,38an4z,PopularWarfare,3,Sat Jun 6 02:26:44 2015 UTC,"Cultural relativism is an anthropological thing but it isn't moral relativism.   Edit: here is a good article covering the issue as it relates to human rights https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&type=summary&url=/journals/human_rights_quarterly/v023/23.3engle.html  Some people think the 1947 refusal to sign the declaration of human rights indicated cultural relativism was about morality but as the article points out it was simply the frustration that the UN's declaration failed to take into account culture and context. The 1999 declaration of human rights put out by the AAA is actually quite similar to the 1947 declaration. But we still struggle with the same debates: Where are the limits of tolerance and accepted cultural practices? What if the people don't see it as an issue but it violates our sense of autonomy and rights? How much should the right to practice your cultural beliefs be protected as a right and at what point is that right being infringed? How specific can you really get about human rights while still appropriately addressing everyone around the world? How do you step into a worldview to understand and explain it with their own cultural sense of rights (cultural relativism) and then place that into the larger context of humanity, politics, economics, etc fairly but accurately?  Papa Boas who pushed cultural relativism was the academic face of anti scientific racism. He absolutely did not see cultural relativism as moral relativism. Just because it brings up important debates doesn't mean it is bad or lacks any morality"

Such judgements are not of empirical value, and refraining from them does not require one embrace moral relativism. Moreover, stating that one culture is superior to another is a value judgement—inherently subjective, and not of interest."

They're the social sciences. If you allow your personal views to influence your conclusions about empirical phenomena, you're being a bad scientist. Epidemiologists don't constantly remind people that people dying of disease is a bad thing. Materials science researchers don't feel the need to note that building collapses are bad.   So you can judge a culture morally but you can't say one is better than another?   You can judge a culture morally. You shouldn't do so while attempting to study or explain something about it. That's the whole point of cultural relativism- cultures should be studied in an objective manner, not one informed by your own beliefs. Saying one culture is better than another tends to be frowned upon because of how often it's a prelude to racism, but there's nothing intrinsically wrong with it, if you can back it up with evidence and a coherent moral framework. But that's the job of a philosopher. Social scientists are not doing philosophy."

While i dislike the tone of the article, think his argument is poor, I think I'll have to disagree with you here. While i dislike the tone of the article, not familiar with the examples he uses (beyond the link in the oped itself) and generally dislike david brooks as an academic and general human being (holy qualifiers batman), i think protecting freedom of speech on college campuses is incredibly important.   I think you touched on it a bit, when you said that its meta, in that speech issues  blur the lines between philosophy, social science and personal experience.   Coming from an extremely right-wing home with an odd mix of randian free market fundamentalism/cultural Marxism from my dad and xenophobia and racism from my mom, I held some pretty abhorrent beliefs not too long ago. If you go back far enough, i'm pretty sure its all still there in my post history and was probably part of why I was banned when I first got here (that bot is fucking thorough). It was not until i started community college and found my first real love, philosophy, that i began to question my beliefs. And if i'm completely honest not, till I transferred a second time that i held anything resembling respectable opinions.   The evolution from borderline right-wing radical/extremist to what i now like to tell myself is an ambitious, somewhat open-minded future academic, was not particularly smooth or graceful and looking back, incredibly embarrassing. I am forever grateful to my professors, (especially at community college) who were understanding and compassionate towards me even as i subtlety (and not so subtlety) insulted them and/or their culture/gender/religion/whatever.    I'm not so naive or ideologically blinded as to think freedom of speech is perfect or that there are not instances of failure. The constitutional rights that were originally intended to protect minorities and unpopular opinions can also be abused by the majority and powerful to solidify their position in society. I don't know what can be done. While restricting or banning certain speech  seems like the obvious choice, I remain skeptical of its effectiveness and long term viability. In fact, if allowed, i think the power to ban certain speech would be co-opted by those in power rather quickly. At least by guaranteeing freedom of speech to everyone we create a small bufferzone.    I'm sorry this turned into incoherent rambling and became more of a diary entry than anything useful. My dad has been especially generous in letting me know that I wasted his money getting my degree and disapproval of my decision to go to apply for grad school. I'm not sure why it feels therapeutic to tell this to strangers on the internet, but it does. If you read all of this, thank you, i really appreciate it."
BadSocialScience,387zbu,PopularWarfare,6,Wed Jun 3 09:35:51 2015 UTC,"I do agree that we should encourage discussions of difficult subjects and push students to explore areas and topics that are a little uncomfortable. I still hold to the idea that college can produce not just someone ready for the market but well rounded individuals who are better citizens. In cultural anthropology we learn about some seriously dark shit sometimes - extreme poverty, infanticide, rape, violence, slavery, etc. And that's just in intro (seriously, our intro class readers have some really heavy subject matter!) Students should question a lot of previously held beliefs during the process and learn to step into someone else's shoes. And that's tough. Emotionally tough. Psychologically tough. And exhausting. But important.   I always warn my students we'll deal with difficult topics, encourage them to read the syllabus, and advise them they have one miss a day with no consequences ""free pass"" so if they need to use it to avoid the discussion of a subject matter they can. But they still need to know the material for tests and papers. I feel like that's a fair compromise. I've been in a classroom where a professor knew a particular student had undergone a particular trauma and then proceeded to relay a story that was very similar to her trauma and get upset when she politely excused herself from the classroom for a time. I of course don't know about my students experiences but I don't want them to feel as though they cannot excuse themselves from a lecture that hits on a trauma. But I also don't want to avoid topics that are important to discuss.   So should we talk about and debate limits of academic freedom if any? The consequences of censorship? Whether ""trigger warnings"" are overblown or really helpful? Sure. I think he just does a very poor job of articulating that debate and conflates too many things to be productive."
BadSocialScience,387zbu,TaylorS1986,5,Wed Jun 3 11:11:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the article itself is pretty much what i have come to expect from Brooks. And I'm not particularly thrilled to be on the same side of the debate, though for different reasons.   I have only UGTA'd for one economic history class, where the only really contreversial  topic was slavery and its economic impact and only for about two weeks.  The questions asked tend be less controversial and more autistic, for example :    ""Was slavery Profitable""   ""Would the rise of the United States as an economic super power have been possible without slavery?""   Or that provincial banking most likely evolved out of the need for people to secure loans to buy slaves. While these questions are important and have provided new data and perspectives, its important to be aware of the bigger picture. Whether slavery was profitable or not would not change my opinion on it. It could have10,000% returns and cured cancer, slavery is still morally reprehensible and has no place in any society.   My formal academic interests and degree make it unlikely that I would ever teach any of the shit you mentioned and much happier to leave it to the experts. But if i was, i'm not sure what i would do. Is it okay to use slurs and racial epitaphs in class? When does a student cross over from ignorance to bigotry? Of course everyone should always feel physically safe and implicit or explicit uses violence are never acceptable, but part of studying social science and humanity more generally, is that we have done horrible, sadistic, fucked up shit to each other. I feel that if i was to sugar coat it, i would be doing disservice not only to the students but also to past,present and future victims.    The Smith racial slur controversy in the brooks article shows how controversial or offensive speech can create a positive outcome. I can't say definitively what she did was right or wrong, but I think its results were net positive. It spurred student activism, dialogue and brought the problem of past and present institutional racism at Smith into the spotlight. There are several good cases you could make about what she said, but demanding her job does not seems more like a witch hunt than justice.   I think it also showed us something we as a society and more narrowly as academics/intellectuals we often forget, which is that freedom of speech requires us to remain vigilant against hatred intolerance in the public and private sphere. It's why i continue to have the same five fucking discussions over and over again, even if it makes me want to smash my head against the fucking keyboard.    http://mountholyokenews.org/2014/10/11/smith-college-community-reacts-to-racially-charged-remark-by-alumna/   http://studentactivism.net/2015/02/21/on-wendy-kaminers-use-of-racial-slurs/"

As of October 2013, Richard Lynn is the primary contact for the Pioneer Fund.   Two of the most notable studies funded by the Pioneer Fund are the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart  and the Texas Adoption Project, which studied the similarities and differences of identical twins and other children adopted into non-biological families.

Nobody in my dept (of political science) is remotely convinced, nor are any of the political scientists and sociologists I follow on twitter, from whom I've been getting most of my news on this. I'm not a stats monkey, and thus can't evaluate some of the data-analysis nitty-gritty, but at first glance it isn't a particularly coherent defence. It certainly does nothing to address the major areas of concern that Brookman et al raised, like the fact that his surveys appeared not to have actually happened."

It wouldn't be hard to do so for anyone that actually went through the process, either."
BadSocialScience,37u98o,firedrops,9,Sat May 30 16:22:01 2015 UTC,"I'm getting the sense that this is still some bad social science.  The most alarming thing I see is that he doesn't do much to corroborate that the survey actually happened. He previously sent Broockman an email from a person that didn't exist from a survey company to validate that it did, in fact, happen. You'd think he would pull a massive list of emails, contacts at the survey firm, some pictures with canvassers, something, since he's evidently so fastidious with keeping his records.  If he deleted his email contacts specifically for IRB than he violated his IRB's requirements by giving people like Broockman information about it being the survey, so that doesn't add up to me. Feels like a retrospective rationalization. Until he proves that the survey data actually got collected his responses to statistical problems are totally irrelevant.  I don't find the purchase of several apple computers and devices several months apart to be compelling in this case- receipts can be faked (I'd love those bar codes to be tested)- and I have no clue why they are so far apart if they are for the same survey. The receipts also make me a little confused because they were using different credit cards. Usually researchers have just one card that is used for all expenses and reimbursements. Not damning, but just weird if you're going to claim those were for the study. We'll also see if anyone that he says emailed him comes out to validate that the emails did actually happen.  Some of his points are vaguely interesting. His claim that they used the wrong variable for the gay feeling thermometer might be an explanation, but I don't buy it. His data still has a conspicuous resemblance to the data in the other dataset, incorrect variable or not. He claims N/A being recoded to 50 is an unheard of strategy as well. That's only kind of true, though I'm speaking from experience from other measures. One strategy for handling missing data for multivariate models is to code missing values to a valid but arbitrary values and then to control for missingness on that question with a dummy variable. It generally isn't a good strategy unless the data is missing by design due to a skip pattern. Still, he' tries to claim that because the peak on the far right side of the graph is half as big, his data is not fabricated. But the rest of the graph looks incredibly similar to my eyes, just with a much larger N to push bars up a little higher. Even his QQ plots are really, really close to each other after ""fixing"" it with the right variables.  There's also the fact that the guy was caught lying about other things, like his grant funding and receiving different teaching award, on his vita. No mention of any of that in here."

My university may be out-of-date here, but in every unit I've worked for, holding different cards for different grants (or pools of money in the operating account) has been the rule.

BadSocialScience,37qfjb,Quouar,1 point,Sat Jun 6 11:23:18 2015 UTC,"Sure. The term 'genocide' is a rhetorical nuclear bomb. Anything that gets the label becomes the wost thing ever. Because of this, I think it's very important that we use it with an honest and attentive deference to its moral potency. And that potency comes from the fact that it refers, ordinarily, to the systematic taking of human life in order to exterminate an entire community. But the extermination of culture doesn't need to involve the taking of life. Culture doesn't live, die, or feel pain and loss in the way that human beings do; if it can be the subject of genocide, then genocide would no longer exclusively refer to wholesale lifetaking. Moreover, as we can see with this situation, when a so-called cultural genocide is 'bad enough', it often can simply be called a 'genocide' anyway."
BadSocialScience,37qfjb,twittgenstein,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:30:02 2015 UTC,"At the same time, the people whose culture is being exterminated absolutely feel that loss and that displacement as a people, as is illustrated by the Indian schools in Canada and the US, or the extermination of Tibetan culture in China. I completely agree that the term ""genocide"" is a bit of a morality bomb, and that it shouldn't be tossed around willy-nilly. Culture may not feel pain, but the people losing their culture absolutely feel it, and that's why the term ""genocide"" - albeit a modified version - is appropriate."
BadSocialScience,37qfjb,Quouar,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:37:23 2015 UTC,"Well first, feeling the pain of cultural displacement is worth differentiating from feeling the pain of having most of your family actually murdered on the basis of their (typically racialised) position within that culture. Identities are a lot more mutable than human flesh. Second, the residential school system actually fits within the UN's definition of plain old regular genocide (which can include the forcible separation of children from their parents for the purposes of assimilation), rendering unnecessary the contentious category of 'cultural genocide' in the first place.    More generally, I think we'll find that in any situation where the destruction of identity approaches the level of widespread systematicity and maliciousness that might warrant a cautious application of the label 'cultural genocide', it's likely to be an actual genocide. Meaning that 'cultural genocide' is almost always either hyperbole or redundant, and thus diminishes the moral potency of the category no matter what."
BadSocialScience,37qfjb,twittgenstein,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:08:40 2015 UTC,"If I'm remembering the precise structure of it, Micheal Mann distinguishes genocide from ""ethnic cleansing"" in The Dark side of Democracy. Genocide is mass killing based on racialized/cultural differences, and ""ethnic cleansing"" (which I think he even puts in scare quotes to recognize his particular usage) is all other other ways racialized/cultural differences are diminished in an effort towards assimilation or whatnot. I mean, it actually make the use of ""cultural genocide"" seem really out of place, as in it already accounts for a cultural element (that the group being killed is culturally different), so then making it ""cultural"" twice breaks down into what what what? I don't know actually. But it's not like genocide had a meaning prior to being specifically massive mass murder, so it's particularly unhelpful to elucidate the complexities of other forms of ""ethnic cleansing.""  In fact, if I would want to use a powerful term, I do think ethnic cleansing would work and it is much more specific as to what the concern is. But maybe the large problem is that people don't really want to get into conversations about the value of culture(s) because it particularly sticky. But I don't know."

In the context of discussing:   The objective was to ‘take the Indian out of the child,’ and thus to solve what John A. Macdonald referred to as the ‘Indian problem.’”   … Precisely residential schools, whereby aboriginal children were taken under duress from their parents, kept at church run schools where not only were they prevented from speaking their maternal tongue; any part of their cultural identity was completely destroyed. Forcefully being ripped away from your family and culture for the sake of assimilation is severely problematic on its own, but combine the dehumanization inherent in this experiment in white supremacy with the way these schools where run by the Church for the State (just to name a few examples): sterilization, physiological/psychological testing, nutritional experimenting in the form of limiting caloric intake, isolation, systemic violence including the very prevalent sexual kind…  To say, as per our IT friend:   Genocide seems a bit strong for an era when every child had to practice christianity, speak english, and basically be a good and proper subject of the British empire in school, regardless of their actual cultural practices and religious beliefs. But for sure, the Aboriginal kids had it especially bad.   So, no. Genocide is not strongly worded because white kids also had to go to school, as well as church and speak English, that small but non negligible overlap says nothing overall in the face of the lived experiences of Canadian Aboriginals facing institutional racism and colonialism."

I just love the Relationship Health section.   43% of homosexual men estimated 500 or more partners, 28% estimated 1000 or more   lol, okay, statistics taken from a book published in 1978. And taken from that very same book we have   given the variety of circumstances which discourage homosexuals from participating in research studies, it is unlikely that any investigator will ever be in a position to say that this or that is true of a given percentage of all homosexuals.   As for any of the discussion on open relationships 1) there's nothing wrong with consensual non-monogamy, and if you want religious precedence you can look at any of the kings in the Old Testament who had concubines 2) That graph doesn't match any of the data they're presenting.  And to the ""1.5 years average length of marriage"" line, we have this to think about in regards to that cited study:   For this study, Dr. Xiridou received her information from the Amsterdam Cohort Study of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and AIDS Among Homosexual Men. To gain this information, researchers studied 1,800 gay men between the years of 1984- 2001. Same sex marriage was legalized in the Netherlands in 2001, thus making the information irrelevant to points about gay marriage.   Took shit unabashedly from this site."

Wow, that is an epic-level hedging statement.   Anywho, the mental health claims are actually sort of interesting and important independently of the agenda of the infographic. Usually disparities like that are chalked up to minority stress (I know this has been done for anorexia, for example.)   Weirdly, they emphasized illegal drug use and not drinking and smoking, which are pretty widely known to be major health issues for LGBT people in the aggregate.    Putting aside the tacit claim being made the being gay is a mental illness (and part of the point of classifying it as a mental illness was to lessen religious stigma in the first place), and the fact that the infographic doesn't know what a population is (you can find lots of populations with high mental health risks and have no idea about causality: you're making inferences about a very generally understood complex medical phenomenon from a complex social category) there is a tendency to kick the can down the road when it comes to assessing social causes of health risks for LGBT people. The criteria for internalized homophobia are the same as the criteria for ego-dystonic homosexuality, which in turn we used to call 'homosexuality.'"

You're absolutely wrong in your claims about what was adequately controlled for and what wasn't.   He presents no evidence for this so we can't really accept it. It's a simple fact that large scale IQ tests aren't going to be perfectly controlled for - that's just an inevitability. What we do know is that the better we control for these factors, the smaller the gap becomes.   And of course there are some factors that we can't ever really control for - we can't create a control group where a white US family grow up in a world where white is bad and yet everything else is identical to the US. For that we infer evidence from research into things like stereotype threat and see that a couple of points of the gap would be knocked away.   Moreover, in one of the studies in the screenshot I took above, it is explicitly clear that IQ was studied across 119 nations, completely destroying any argument regarding stereotyping, culture, or what have you.   He presents no reasoning for this.

One might have reservations for example about using a small sample test for Croatia in 1952 to allocate Croatia an IQ of 90, extraordinarily low for a central European country, and then to apply the average of this and a figure of 95 for Slovenia as their data point for 'Yugoslavia' – that is, Serbia – which is not a neighbour of Slovenia, and it is not hard to find other anomalies and assumptions verging on the heroic.

Basically, IQ is just a measure for when we get people to perform a number of cognitive tasks that we believe require intelligence (maths, language, spatial abilities, musical ability, etc) and when we statistically analyse it we find that there is an underlying thing which is common to all of them - we call it the g factor (or general intelligence factor). There is no reason to assume this is purely innate and I don't know any scientists in the field who believe that (even supremely racist ones like Jensen and Rushton believe that we need another intelligence measure to measure ""innate"" intelligence)."

Girls and women tend to excel on tests of verbal fluency, arithmetic calculation, and memory for the spatial locations of objects. In contrast, boys and men tend to excel on tests of verbal analogies, mathematical word problems, and memory for the geometric configuration of an environment. Meta-analyses have revealed that some of these sex differences are reliable, although most are small. Indeed, most of the variables that have been tested in men and women have yielded sex differences that are small or close to zero in meta-analyses, leading Hyde (2005) to advance the gender similarities hypothesis.

Second, much of the primary literature on these spatial tasks merely describes or documents these differences without attempting to make conjectures about causality. If you read on to the conclusion, this review is arguing against the idea that men are superior at spatial skills in general:   Research on the cognitive abilities of males and females, from birth to maturity, does not support the claim that men have greater intrinsic aptitude for mathematics and science. Male and female infants do not differ in the cognitive abilities at the foundations of mathematical and scientific thinking; they have common abilities to represent and learn about objects, numbers, language, and space. Male and female children harness these abilities in the same ways, at the same times, to master the concepts and operations of elementary mathematics. Although older boys and girls show somewhat different cognitive profiles, the differences are complex and subtle (it is not the case, e.g., that women are verbal and men are spatial). These differences tend to be small, and they stem primarily from differing strategy choices."
BadSocialScience,37ee1u,Snugglerific,0,Thu May 28 01:22:54 2015 UTC,"First, sexual dimorphism is a thing.   As a taxonomy, sure. But this taxonomy is itself a product of a culturally specific concept. As Thomas Laqueur demonstrates, the concept of sex has varied across time and space. The decision to sort people into ""classes"" based on genital observation is a cultural decision. We could just as easily sort based on eye color or fingerprint pattern -- physical differences have the same ontological status as genital differences. Yet we do not ask the question ""are people with whorled fingerprints better at spatial reasoning tasks?"" This is the point that Butler makes in ""Bodies that Matter"": ""Sexual difference, however, is never simply a function of material differences which are not in some way both marked and formed by discursive practices.""    much of the primary literature on these spatial tasks merely describes or documents these differences without attempting to make conjectures about causality.   But the decision to describe these differences (as opposed to others) is culturally decided. This is, of course, a fundamental problem with science in general: Of the infinite set of possible events that we can observe, the choice of which to focus on is necessarily normative. Since there is no such thing as ""value-less science,"" I think it is important to ask which values your science is promoting."
BadSocialScience,37ee1u,Snugglerific,2,Thu May 28 02:42:26 2015 UTC,"I think we're talking at cross-purposes here. This is the problem with ""biology."" I brought up sexual dimorphism because your reply to my first post made it sound like you were endorsing cultural determinism. I think we can agree that, on average, men will be taller than women. We could take this as a straightforward ""biological"" fact, although it can obviously be dependent on environment. This trend could be reversed if we had a society where boys were all malnourished and given poor medical care compared to girls. This demonstrates the flawed reasoning of trying to look at organisms separate from their environments. However, there is still clearly a biological component or aspect in height differences.  Now can we extrapolate this to differences in cognitive abilities? No, for a number of reasons that I won't get into because we seem to be in agreement on this point. My point in posting the Spelke review was to demonstrate that the categorical statement that men have superior spatial abilities is false. Men do perform better on some (but not all) spatial tasks. However, where there are differences, these are well-documented. I gave no argument as to the cause of these differences. But the review as a whole is an argument against their innateness. Additionally, the OP's evolutionary just-so story is completely divorced from empirical data. So I'm not seeing what the problem is here."
BadSocialScience,37ee1u,shannondoah,-2,Thu May 28 04:35:34 2015 UTC,"However, there is still clearly a biological component or aspect in height differences.   This is the problem (and to be clear, I'm not trying to accuse you of sexism or anything, your position is quite reasonable imo). How can any observed difference between males and females be attributed to biology? How could this be identified? The (untestable) identification assumption in your empirical analysis is that females would be taller but for their sex assignment at birth. But there is no valid control group to serve as a proxy for the counterfactual -- there is no way to hold culture constant and vary genital assignment. The claim that there is a biological explanation for height difference is unverifiable and thus unscientific, by any normal definition of the word ""science.""  But I'd go further than that -- not only is there no valid control, we cannot even conceive of what the valid control would look like. Our concept of sex is formed by a discursive process that all people are subject to. The validity of our empirical analysis depends on identifying a person of an opposite sex who is not subject to the discursive process that defines sex, which is a contradiction.   Edit: Reviewing your comment again, it seems that you may be using ""biological"" as meaning ""empirical"" or ""observed,"" in which case we are in complete agreement. ""I think we can agree that, on average, men will be taller than women."" As an empirical matter, we of course agree on this. But I interpreted ""biological"" as meaning ""genetic."""
BadSocialScience,37ee1u,SnapshillBot,4,Thu May 28 04:59:46 2015 UTC,"The (untestable) identification assumption in your empirical analysis is that females would be taller but for their sex assignment at birth.    No, the assumption is that females would be taller but for their lacking expression of genes typically found on a y chromosome, and this is very much testable: there's no significant genetic variation between males and females except for the presence or absence of a y chromosome. If we raise males and females with identical diets, levels of nutrition, and any other factor that influences metabolism, and there's still a consistent height difference, it must have a genetic origin, and the only possible genetic origin is the portion of the genome that actually varies. Genital assignment obviously isn't a causative factor in most of the traits linked to sex, but genital assignment isn't what is meant by sex. Genital assignment strongly correlates with the state of a person's sex chromosomes, and so it may appear to be the same thing as sex, but it's the chromosomes, their activation or lack thereof, and the state of receptors for the various hormones that they produce that are responsible for sex differences.   Look at it this way: everything you just said is applicable to differences between species. A species is clearly an artificial category. It's equally clear that there's no one who can evaluate height differences between, say, a human and a dog without believing beforehand that the two are different animals. And yet you would never entertain the idea that it's impossible to demonstrate any biological differences between a human and a dog. Certainly, shrinking the genetic differences to the tiny amount of variation between human males and females makes biological variation much smaller, and thus vastly harder to identify, but there's no point at which it makes a qualitative shift to being impossible."

BadSocialScience,37d726,Tiako,48,Tue May 26 19:40:41 2015 UTC,"The two main arguments I'm seeing -  Human nature -  The whole ""human nature"" argument is just an attempt, intentional or not, to naturalize either current material conditions or current human behavior by ignoring the relation of material conditions to human behavior. Essentially - ""the way we behave under current material conditions is a reflection of the way humans always behave, regardless of material conditions"".   Economic calculation problem -  This is a problem that assumes a particular normative framework - mainly the end goal of profit - in order to argue that profit is necessary for resource allocation/""efficient"" resource allocation. Of course, because of this assumption the qualifier ""efficient"" just circles back to profitability and becomes a tautology (you have to be profitable in order to allocate resources at a financial gain).  But more importantly, this metric of profitability is then applied to non-monetary markets (read - markets that by definition do not calculate based upon profitability) in order to argue that they can't calculate at a profit and thus are not solutions to the question of how we allocate resources. The metric by which the status-quo operates is being applied to alternative methods that do not rely upon this metric in order to demonstrate that they are not pragmatic solutions. That is clearly flawed. Instead of operating as a critique of non-monetary market systems, the calculation problem simply highlights the limits of monetary market economies.  And this entire argument occurs while profit isn't even substantiated as the only, or best, method for allocating resources (again - you circle back to profitability as being the determiner for ""efficient"" resource allocation and its begging the question).   The truth is that mis-allocation happens in a monetary market economy as well. And sometimes that mis-allocation is incentived - like in cases where it would be profitable to do so. But because of the internal circular structure of the argument, this is still deemed ""efficient"", regardless of whether resources were allocated based on need or not.   It's utterly unconvincing, especially when you realize that the number one reason why over 800 million humans go without food in this world is because the fundamental market barrier to entry - cost - prevents them from purchasing that which they need, is a necessary and efficient condition of this market economy all while the world makes enough food to feed everyone.  In summation - don't be fooled by the bourgeois claptrap going on in that thread (and I use that word to push buttons just in case we have unfriendly lurkers). >:)"
BadSocialScience,37d726,Bosco_Sauce,20,Tue May 26 20:25:20 2015 UTC,"Economic calculation problem    This argument usually comes in two versions, the pure ""economic calculation"" version pushed by Mises which you have already tackled and the ""decentralized information"" angle pushed by Hayek. What i find the funniest is that the decentralized information argument when pushed to it's logical conclusions is an attack upon centralized and hierarchical capitalist institutions as much as it is an attack upon Government management, and serves as an argument for decentralized socialism better than what it does for any form of capitalism. It is for this very reason that the Mises Institute-dudes tend to dismiss Hayek's version of the argument as a distortion (and dismiss Hayek as a proto-keynesian traitor or something).  And another problem with the original ""economic calculation"" pushed by Mises is that it is empirically false. Mises argued that having a non-monetary economy with a complex division of labor is impossible. Not just ""inefficient"", ""wasteful"" or ""crisis-prone"" but literally impossible. So how does Mises explain the existance of the economy of the Inca Empire? How does Mises explain the origin of money in Sumerian temple bureaucracies from fixed equivalents used to administer things with out a 'market'?"

BadSocialScience,37d726,say_wot_again,6,Wed May 27 01:25:50 2015 UTC,"It depends a lot on which model for decentralized socialism you think of. For example, council-communists and other brands of left-communism usually imagine a planned economy where rather than planned by a central bureaucracy the economy is managed by a huge network of directly-democratic councils that are as decentralized and varied as possible. They believe that before this type of planned economy can exist the forces or production must be well-developed enough so that this thing called ""directly social labor"" is realized, here's a discussion on that (though most of it is intra-marxist polemics too).  Anarcho-syndicallists on the other hand do away with the concept of ""planning"". What was put in practice in revolutionary Barcelona1 worked basically like this: Factories, shops and etc were all collectivized (i.e self-managed) by their workers, and they joined together in ""federations"" (so there was a city-wide barbershop federation, a woodworkers federation, a metallurgic workers federation, etc; though no collective was required to be part of it nor did any federation have a monopoly on their particular industry). The federations themselves were organized by recallable delegates elected from the collectivized industries.  The federations exchanged with one another on a sort of gift-economy2 like basis, rather than have their exchanges and production goals ""planned"" by a central authority. Each collective pooled-in their surplus (that is, their ""profit"") in the federations they participated in and could take from that common pool to finance expansion and the like, so each federation also acted as a sort of ""mutual bank"" that socialized capital. Each federation had complete autonomy to organize how this was to be done:   The woodworkers federation chose a model by which the elected delegates effectively acted as an executive director, ordering the collectives how much to pool-in or take out. The textile federation on the other hand was organized on an entirely different line, the main function of the federation was to keep public statistics on how much everyone was contributing, and there was this mutual self-policing to make sure everyone was producing efficiently (collectives that seemed to be leeching off were given a public warning to change course, or otherwise they could be kicked out). In some ways, i think the woodworkers federation reflects Marx's communist views (based on a ""common plan"") while the textile federation reflects Bakunin's anarchistic views (based on spontaneous federalism). I think this system of collectives and federations, and particularly the model employed by the textile industry, could also be seen as an Elinor Ostrom-like common-pool resource3.  Then there's other ideas around like Schweikarts market socialism or Parecon or Takis Fotopoulos's ""Inclusive Democracy"" but i don't really know much about them."

Would it be fair to say that, like Montesquieu's vision of representative government, decentralized socialism works best at small local levels and doesn't scale well to large states?    This sort of generalized self-management does rely on close relationships between the people involved, but i think it can scale well to large states by having multiple levels of nested enterprises (with the small, local units at their base) or as a horizontal network.   To use the example of Spain: Since they managed to get Barcelona (and the country-side aswell) up and running, there is nothing preventing other close-by cities being ran in the same way and ""federating"" and exchanging horizontally with Barcelona, and the cities close to those cities federating with them and so on and so forth; so that even if Barcelona is not in a direct relationship to Madrid it is indirectly tied to it by a wide network of exchange.   This sort of happened to a degree in Spain, as the rural collectives maintained Catalonia while also sending surplus food off to Madrid. I think it also bears some resemblance to the political system the Paris Commune1 tried to set up (a ""Federation of Communes"", where each ""Commune"" is a city), though insurrections in the rest of France were quickly smashed and Paris became isolated."

I'm not going to pretend I know the nuances of the logistics of resource allocation, but I think there is a lot of hub bub over nothing when it comes to the logistics of how this can be done. Retail stores already operate on software that does a lot of the heavy lifting, so to speak, when it comes to keeping their shelves stocked. It's just that the director is profitability and these logistical mechanisms are closed off to competitors. Think if every available distribution center worked in concert, rather than competition, to supply needed/desired goods to particular areas. For a lot of this stuff it seems to be just a matter of scaling up and localizing (no more outsourcing labor for the sole reason that it is cheaper, just to ship tons of goods by means of polluting cargo vessels), not starting from scratch."

But money is pretty much necessary once the economy reach a certain degree of complexity because it allows the abstraction of value which in turn makes it easier to calculate the viability of exchange or production.

Mises's work was fundamentally not about the lack of a monetary system of some sort, it was fundamentally about the consequences of eliminating the capitals market. Mises himself said consumer goods aren't that big of an issue in a Socialist economy because there are exchanges in those goods and therefore value can be determined.

But all a currency really is is a medium by which you can reference all goods by. I suspect even in Sumeria or w/e they used gold or silver as a reference point for all the other goods.  I also find this to be pretty suspect because pre-modern states tend not to be able to enforce fixed prices. You didn't have a police capable of cracking down on black markets.    And i stress that Mises's view regarding economic calculation in such complexes was not that it would be ""inefficient"", but that it would be ""impossible"".    He said it's impossible to do ""rationally"" not impossible period. Because yeah, you can just define prices arbitrarily without doing any calculation, it just doesn't work very well.

Presumably people who gift each other expect certain values in return over time.   The inner logic of gift-exchange is completely different from the logic of market exchange. There is no agreed upon quid pro quo or mathematical calculations of value (no ""exchange ratios""). When you receive a gift, you end up having a ""social debt"" of equivalent value, but ""value"" in this economy is not measurable (it is an inter-subjective notion of utility), you don't necessarily owe this value to the person who gifted to you (sometimes you are supposed to gift to an entirely different person, pushing this debt ""forwards""), you have no set date to pay this debt at all, there is no such thing as interest and you don't get arrested by the police when you fail to pay this debt.  Calling gift-exchange a ""market, but of a different kind"" is disingenuous - like Austrians often do you are trying to prove that only markets exist by defining all economic systems based on spontaneous exchange a ""market"". Yet this way even Marxist and Anarchist conceptions of 'communism' suddenly fall under the umbrella of ""market"" so what you are doing doesn't give any strenght to your argument.   Ummm, how do we know there were no black markets and people trading under ratios other than the officially approved one?   First, there are no ""officially approved"" ratios in gift-exchange. But onto your question, there is simply no archeological evidence or historical sources that imply the Inca Economy had a ""market"" economy (and after studying a shit ton of societies, archeologists kind of know where to look for signs of this stuff), it was a society based on kinship relations that had a different logic. You could read what the historians have to say about it, i recommend Huarochiri: An Andean Society Under Inca and Spanish Rule by Karen Spalding.   You are using a pre-industrial society of which we have limited economic data on as evidence for the viability of your kind of society which is always kind of suspect.   I'm not using the Inca Economy as a point in favor of ""my kind of society"", specially because i don't see a kinship-based class society as a model for anything good. I mean, having a State and having to give aciprocal gifts and perform corveé labor to a nobility are both things i abhor. The Inca economy points to anarcho-communists that a large scale gift-based economy is possible, but it also points to anarcho-communists that even a gift-economy can end up having a ruling class (a theme that David Graeber also touches upon a bit in Debt) so even an anarchist gift-economy would rely on social relations and a cultural framework that prevents the growth of any potential ruling class, as the gift-economy won't automatically do that by itself.   This is kind of like when the right tries to use the Roman economy as argument against inflation, it's trying to project modern political views on ancient systems because we lack data on those systems so it's easy to project one's own ideals on them.   I haven't projected any political views upon anyone. My only comment was that the Inca managed to do economic calculation in a way that Mises didn't really think was possible. It would be a serious anarchronism aswell as technically and politically incorrect to refer to them as a ""Socialist"" economy.   The fact that modern governments (see Venezuelan) which tried to price fix and failed suggests to me those examples are not all that relevant anymore, or that we simply don't have sufficient data to understand them anyway.   When an economy has a capitalist market economy, and then tries to impose price-fixing upon it, then of course it will fail. I'm trying to discuss economies that don't have market economies, nevermind capitalist market economies, in the first place. I'm not a supporter of the PSUV and i think Venezuela under Cháves/Maduro is yet-another failed experiment in social democracy, so i'm not sure what you hope to accomplish by citing them to me.   Let's just leave it at pre-industrial societies might be able to function without it but it's not all that relevant to today's world.   Even then i think you are shifting the goal-posts, but even assuming this shift is valid, i still think that Austrian economics fails to explain the management of Barcelona's economy by a network of anarcho-syndicallist trade unions un 1936 and fails to explain, say, how common-pool resources that resemble Elinor Ostrom's model have been shown to work (regardless of the technological development involved)."

BadSocialScience,37d726,DeSoulis,3,Wed May 27 16:02:29 2015 UTC,"So how else do you calculate efficiency and value?   It depends upon what is meant by efficiency and value. But I think it is clear that if the goal is to sustainably allocate resources based upon need/desire (I'd argue need is easier to figure out), then adding the barrier of monetary cost contorts this process - where non-scarce goods (goods in sufficient supply to meet demand) are not allocated in a way that meets demand, and scarce goods (supply is not sufficient to meet demand) are allocated in non-sustainable ways (overuse of resources reducing carrying capacity).   I think once you start to realize that the issue of unattainable desires is either overblown or equally impacts monetary markets (that's essentially the argument that nothing is ever enough for anyone), the problem looks less daunting because you realize that monetary calculation isn't actually solving any of the problems, or it is only doing so by coincidence and for those with sufficient money.   Capitalist apologists present the status-quo as a meritocracy, and this lie feeds into the dream that all the wildest desires of anyone can be met if only they worked hard enough. Alternative systems grounded in reality, actual economies attempting to allocate resources as sustainably as possible in order to meet the needs of everyone, don't tell you this lie and so it starts to look a little ridiculous when you think of a minority of individuals in, say, a communist society all owning three, four, five homes across the world and living in extreme extravagance because the lie of earning it doesn't exist.    Because even externalities tend to be calculated in dollar terms and even Communist countries kept currency as a system of accounting. You can argue that there's better ways of calculating value than using currency but the thing is nobody have actually came up with a method.   Right, my contention is not that monetary markets do not or cannot calculate - my contention is that it hasn't been substantiated that they are the only possible ways to calculate, or the best possible ways to calculate.

If you want a more detailed list I'd be happy to provide it.  And oh jesus god help you if you are honestly learning about Socialism from youtube videos.    By what metric is price considered fictional or not?    By the metric that under a planned system prices are hence determined by a single agent: the central planner. In a market system the price is determined by every agent within the system to some degree. What this means is that in a planning system far less information was taken into account during the calculation process because by single agent at the center has far less information than everybody else in the system put together. Furthermore when you have markets you have a bargaining process between two or more parties which helps to determine the actual value of a good. In a planned system there is no bargaining process to the price is whatever the planner think it is without the need to consult reality. Even if he does his information as to what the ""real"" value is is far more limited than a market. The net result is under planning pricing becomes arbitrary.  As a thought experiment think of it this way, if you in a planned economy you are trying to determine how to build a car, how do you determine what's the most efficient material?    I'm not convinced value is calculated in a monetary market anyway, and where it is it can only possibly occur within the bounds of price. Which is shorthand for saying it fails.    Value is absolutely calculated in a monetary system and it happens literally the moment you go to the convenience store and buys a candy bar. You, personally, have probably calculated value using monetary system dozens of times today alone.   You might argue that it doesn't sufficiently take into account externalities and that is a weakness of the system (but even then the government compensates for it by imposing things like carbon taxation).     where it is it can only possibly occur within the bounds of price. Which is shorthand for saying it fails.    No, it really doesn't    Calculating value based upon price already assumes price as the means by which calculation occurs    What?  You are basically making a nonsensical statement, of course you need to calculate value using price if you are calculating value using price.  I think what you are trying to get at is that certain things cannot be encapsulated by -pricing-.    so it's not really persuasive to hold this up as a point against alternative models when aspects of the alternative model were only ever attempted in a system that requires price.    Actually the USSR tried to abolish money in its early years and it turned out to be so unworkable it was very quickly abandoned.  So this is why I keep asking, what other system are you proposing here? Mises is essentially saying that you need a market to calculate value for capital goods. You can prove him wrong by offering some alternative system which works."

If you had one grandparent who was Jewish, you were a viable target. This is why Israel uses the same criterion today for determining the Law of Return.  Second, I'm not going to make any direct comparisons to Nazi Germany or play games with headcounts, but GB committed horrible crimes during the colonial period that led to mass deaths. Manufactured famines were particularly deadly, such as the Great Bengal Famine that occurred under Churchill and the Irish Potato Famine. India also suffered another manufactured famine in the late 19th century, which is documented extensively in Mike Davis' book Late Victorian Holocausts:   In his book Late Victorian Holocausts, published in 2001, Mike Davis tells the story of famines that killed between 12 and 29 million Indians. These people were, he demonstrates, murdered by British state policy. When an El Niño drought destituted the farmers of the Deccan plateau in 1876 there was a net surplus of rice and wheat in India. But the viceroy, Lord Lytton, insisted that nothing should prevent its export to England. In 1877 and 1878, at the height of the famine, grain merchants exported a record 6.4m hundredweight of wheat. As the peasants began to starve, officials were ordered ""to discourage relief works in every possible way"". The Anti-Charitable Contributions Act of 1877 prohibited ""at the pain of imprisonment private relief donations that potentially interfered with the market fixing of grain prices"". The only relief permitted in most districts was hard labour, from which anyone in an advanced state of starvation was turned away. In the labour camps, the workers were given less food than inmates of Buchenwald. In 1877, monthly mortality in the camps equated to an annual death rate of 94%.  As millions died, the imperial government launched ""a militarised campaign to collect the tax arrears accumulated during the drought"". The money, which ruined those who might otherwise have survived the famine, was used by Lytton to fund his war in Afghanistan. Even in places that had produced a crop surplus, the government's export policies, like Stalin's in Ukraine, manufactured hunger. In the north-western provinces, Oud and the Punjab, which had brought in record harvests in the preceeding three years, at least 1.25m died.   http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/dec/27/eu.turkey"

If he wants to be douchey, let him be douchey.  The comments on that thread are reactionary as fuck, though. Here's one that was gilded:   I was raped as a child. When I was finally old enough and mature enough to deal with my issues, I was still too poor to be able to afford anyone but the free group therapy type places. If I could have afforded it, I would have gone to a private therapist.  No one wanted me. The group therapy places were female-only or if they were ""open"" to everyone all of the other people there ignored me as hard as they could and wanted me to leave.  If you are a male rape victim, no one wants to help you. You are supposed to suck it up and deal with it on your own.   OK, valid issue raised. Male victims of rape aren't treated well. Then...   One of the reasons I can't align myself with feminists is this. If you ask them why there is no funding in the budget for male victims, they call YOU the sexist. It's women first, women second, women third, and men never at all. If you are a man and need help, the feminist mantra is to tell you to go fuck yourself because you are part of the patriarchy, how DARE you need help.  Thankfully I worked through most of my issues on my own. I had to, it was the only way. I had major trust and intimacy issues I had to overcome, and mostly I did.

BadSocialScience,374lpj,redwhiskeredbubul,15,Sun May 24 20:53:50 2015 UTC,"Pretty good indicator as in it's a pretty good one among all tests that measure those aspects that psychologists care about. However, if we are looking at sociology, economics or political science, they have their own indicators that measure better of what they themselves care about. For example, socio-economic level might be a better indicator of other intelligence than IQ test alone.   The problem with using IQ to judge one's professional capacity is largely flawed for many many reasons.   Intelligence measured with IQ may not transfer well with the skills required at those professions. Corporate executives is not just about making decisions. If no one is willing to follow your decisions, it doesn't matter whether you can make the right decision or not. You need charisma as well. Therefore in this case, may be some other test like EQ is a better indicator. The article assumes that IQ alone is enough to make you successful in one's career. Many successful people in today's world are not there just because they were smart alone. Your social capital, cultural capital, and economic capital may be a bigger influence of success than your individual intelligence. Social capital matters in several ways. Not only can someone you know directly influence the decision of your employment, may be they can introduce you to more people who are likely important in your career. Even in software engineering where you would assume your quality of skill matters the most, you can easily get an interview if you know someone inside even if you may be less skilled than others, or even bypass several interviews as well. Also, cultural capital matters in that your dad's profession is a very good indicator of your profession as well. So, if your dad's profession is a well-paying one, you are likely to be in one as well. Furthermore, education and skill costs money. You need economic capital to be able to fund private school and private tutoring. If the Zuckerberg family could not afford the private programming tutoring or the private institution like Phillips Exeter Academy for young Mark, could he have been this successful? I very much doubt it.  Last of all, this ignores the fact that IQ test can be trivially increased with some preparation while it will be hard to argue that studying for IQ test specifically increased intelligence at all. There are many books out there that have practice questions for IQ test, and this may mean that with enough preparation, you can be as ""smart"" as you want, while not actually gaining any relevant intelligence.    In all, the author is probably not excluded because he's smart. May be it's a small fraction of the reason, but it's most likely that he does not have the necessary skills to succeed in a profession, that he lacks either social capital, cultural capital, economic capital, or all of them, or that his IQ does not correctly correspond with his intelligence at all."

This creates the paradox of stupidity, though -- how can smart people be so stupid? Sternberg (an intelligence psychologist) put out an entire volume dedicated to this question (Why Smart People Can Be So Stupid). I find Keith Stanovich's argument, that intelligence and rationality are not the same phenomenon, to be the most compelling. He expands on this, based on research in cognitive biases and heuristics, in his book What Intelligence Tests Miss."

Your desire to rob others of their autonomy is vastly more disturbing than whatever the ""root issues of their plight"" are. You are in no position to determine what their pursuit of happiness entails, as that is solely theirs to determine. The obvious limits to this are when their endeavor causes real and demonstrable harm to others, but that is never the case with transgender people. The best thing the transphobes can do is point to some vague and undemonstrable damage to society or family structure or some other bullshit.  That being said, I really don't care much what Dr. McHugh's views are. You can probably find biologists who hold that the earth is 6000 years old and a variety of other insane views. What I'm more interested in is the consensus, which states that Gender Dysphoria is a real disorder for which the only treatment is physical transformation. But to be honest, even that doesn't matter as much. Medical and psychological findings are not what determine a person's rights, and whatever the literature says, it is up to transgender people to makes the choices in their lives, not to you to choose for them."

That's right; that doesn't impact anyone either.

Sexually, yeah, they are, a transgendered female is still a male. Even after surgery, still a male. Unless you're going to talk about something akin to de la Chapelle syndrome, this will always remain so. You're confusing, or conflating, my use of the sexual term with the gender term; one is derived from reproductive organs/chromosomes, the other is generally culturally learned. So while a person may be a transgender female...that person is still a 'he', is still male.    Gender-neutral bathrooms would solve this issue altogether.    I wouldn't care about gender neutral bathrooms, but I'm sure it would make a lot of other people uncomfortable.    So far you haven't actually demonstrated any real harm that transgendered people have inflicted upon you or society.   Here's one, that I believe is sort of explicit in the article mentioned. Children younger than ten years old - younger than puberty - are susceptible to all sorts of irrational thoughts. When you make something as real as Gender Identity Disorder (because it's disordered to the natural cause of things..) conflated to be something simply accepted from any and every angle, and encouraging children so young they can't even properly demonstrate sexual desires to have extremely major life-altering processes like a gender flip, it can cause irreparable damage and exacerbate the already real problems people with Gender Dysphoria face, such as anxiety disorders and depression. This is why people like Dr. Paul McHugh do not do sex change operations, even in adults, because such things don't see resolution from their psychological problems post-surgery. This isn't because of society - this is because there's something else at play here. And subjecting kids to this? No thanks.   This becomes especially troubling when the vast majority of people want this to become permissible because feelings, and not off of any scientific basis that there could, in fact, be more to this than a person just getting called a lady, putting on some female clothes, and bam, problem solved. This person feels this way, and it doesn't directly affect you (!!), so why should you care, huh bigot? Well ok then, I feel like a lady today, and that doesn't affect you or any of the other women in the gym's locker room, so I want to change in there with them today. What do you mean the woman's bathroom doesn't have any urinals? Gender is just a social construct, and since I feel like a woman today, and since it doesn't affect you or your children, you need to put a urinal in the woman's bathroom or I will sue you to do so, because I demand equal rights.   This becomes even more troubling whenever anyone wants to say ""this doesn't affect you!"" - which is what led me to the examples I gave. Same sex unions don't affect you! But I will sue you to force you to participate in them against your religiously held beliefs because! Transgender people don't affect you! This transgender person just wants you to teach your children that he/she is perfectly normal and not at all disordered (Gender Identity disorder, where there are psychological problems and abnormalities at play to cause a person to feel this way) because feelings!"

When you make something as real as Gender Identity Disorder[1] (because it's disordered to the natural cause of things..   That's not why it's called a disorder. It's called a disorder because it causes real problems in a person's day-to-day life. It has absolutely nothing to do with the ""natural cause of things"".   encouraging children so young they can't even properly demonstrate sexual desires to have extremely major life-altering processes like a gender flip, it can cause irreparable damage and exacerbate the already real problems people with Gender Dysphoria face   This just tells me you've never met, spoken to, or read anything about a transgender person. Talk to any of them and just about every one of them will tell you that they felt they were the wrong gender since like 4 or 5.   Besides that, gender identity and ""sexual desires"" have nothing to do with each other. Children identify with genders from very young ages. A young boy will say ""I'm a boy"" and do things he associates with being a boy. Same with a girl. That argument is useless.   This is why people like Dr. Paul McHugh[2] do not do sex change operations, even in adults, because such things don't see resolution from their psychological problems post-surgery.   That is 100%, unequivocally, demonstrably false and just shows how little you actually know about transgender issues. Living as their identified gender is the only known cure for gender dysphoria. And not every transgender person gets reconstructive surgery. In fact very few do because of costs, risks, etc.   This becomes especially troubling when the vast majority of people want this to become permissible because feelings, and not off of any scientific basis that there could   No, again, you are completely wrong. You're the one basing this because of feels and not scientific basis. The amount of studies published verifying that transgenderism is a real, verifiable thing and that transitioning is the best course of action is staggering. You're the one who doesn't like the idea and so deny it.   in fact, be more to this than a person just getting called a lady, putting on some female clothes, and bam, problem solved.   That's exactly how many transwomen live their lives, you fucking moron. They live their lives as women and bam, no more dysphoria.   Well ok then, I feel like a lady today   That's not how being transgender works. They don't feel like a lady today. They've felt like a lady for their entire lives.   Gender is just a social construct, and since I feel like a woman today   Clearly you have no idea what a social construct is. Gender is a social construct, but that doesn't make it any less real. The economy is a social construct as well, but that doesn't mean it doesn't affect everyone's lives and is a real thing.   This is probably the thing I hate the most that people say. ""It's a social construct, that means it's not real!"" No, dipshit, it means it's a thing that was created by society and people. Just like our laws. Or our jobs. Or pretty much everything. Jesus.   you need to put a urinal in the woman's bathroom or I will sue you to do so, because I demand equal rights.   You don't need a urinal to use the bathroom. You have one in your house? No, you use the toilet. No problems. Your lawsuit would be thrown out before you could file it. Use whatever bathroom you want, you're the only one who cares.   This becomes even more troubling whenever anyone wants to say ""this doesn't affect you!""   It doesn't. Not even a little. No one's forcing you to become transgender.   which is what led me to the examples I gave.   Those were the shittiest examples ever. None of what you said correlated with reality at all or affected anyone in any negative way at all.   Same sex unions don't affect you! But I will sue you to force you to participate in them against your religiously held belief   I'm pretty sure churches don't have to marry same-sex couples. I admit I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure that's true. So again, it doesn't affect you at all.    This transgender person just wants you to teach your children that he/she is perfectly normal and not at all disordered (Gender Identity disorder, where there are psychological problems and abnormalities at play to cause a person to feel this way) because feelings!   Jesus Christ, no one is saying gender dysphoria isn't a problem (the dysphoria part), but we're saying don't hate someone because of it. Would you relentlessly hate and abuse someone because they have ADD? That's a mental disorder too. What about Alzheimers? Or autism? No, that's a super shitty thing to do. So, if we concede that being transgender is also a mental illness, what's the difference? Why do you harass and care so deeply about them and not any other mental illness?  I'll tell you why: because you're a fucking bigot and a terrible Christian.  Edited formatting and finished the last paragraph."

Though it would be nice, and modest of you, to note that McHugh is going against the consensus established by his peers and others studying neuroanatomy. McHugh may be a very noteworthy psychiatrist but his authority is somewhat lessened when so many of his peers are objecting.  There are objections I could raise myself, McHugh's characterization of heterosexual urges as an intrinsic quality of masculinity really underscores the fact that this man received his initial college education in the 1950's. Otherwise his interpretations of answers given by trans women are downright uncharitable, nor is showing favor to autogynephilia as an explanation of gender dysphoria doing him any credit. Much like Blanchard and other proponents of autogynephilia, the existence of FTM persons are completely ignored.  If I wanted to be completely uncharitable, I would suggest a Kuhnian explanation for McHugh's thoughts. McHugh was born in 1931, when he graduated from Harvard Medical the APA still had homosexuality listed in the DSM. McHugh is a hanger-on of the old paradigm, it's what he knows and what he's comfortable with no matter how many anomalies poke holes in his theories. At the end of the day, McHugh is a product of another era and his position shouldn't be taken as indicative of prevailing thought.  While I don't think McHugh's position is particularly well thought-out, I don't doubt his sincerity or his desire to help those people. I do, however, doubt your sincerity and the sincerity of the people at /r/Catholicism. The opinions of people like McHugh aren't presented out of a good-natured desire to present contrary opinions and discuss them, but to grant your own bigotry a pretense of being legitimate and respectable.

I'm going to make the conjecture that everything you know about Christianity/Scripture/what Christ says comes from pop-culture pseudo-isms, and basically nothing about actual knowledge. We'll skip past the parts where Christ;   Tells people to buy swords Says that His servants would fight to prevent His arrest were the earthly kingdom His kingdom Literally says He did not come to bring peace, but the sword   What did Christ say...about a lot of things? He didn't really say much about quite a lot. So, what's your point exactly? Christ came to start a Church to be His vicar until His return, which He did, which He intended to guide us in His principles, which it will.   Nobody even said being transgendered is a sin, where did you even come up with that? Oh, I know exactly where you came up with it - you're projecting onto me what you've decided I already think and believe (this asshole hates gays! he hates transgendered people! he thinks they're terrible sinners because of it!) because it makes the narrative in your head that much easier for you to accept instead of actually reading what I'm saying. It is even the Church's position that in the most rare of cases, a sex change operation can be the greater good for a person - in the most rare of cases, not because ""I feel this way!"" There is something disordered about a sexually male person feeling that they should in fact be sexually female. Except people right now aren't concerned with treatment for the root cause, they're more concerned with how people feel and offenses being taken."

You seem to subscribe to some form of utilitarianism, which is a philosophy readily available in Western culture, although the philosophical articulations tend to be a lot more admirable than the forms that are widely practiced. But utilitarianism is by no means the consensus among ethical philosophers, and while I don't know a whole lot about this field I'm aware that there are some highly effective critiques of utilitarianism you might want to read if you want to expand your thinking.

Seriously, she has a MBA and a JD from Harvard, she's worked for the big guys like Microsoft, and she's worked for Reddit since 2013. Reddits freaked out about the salary negotiations thing without even reading the studies or examining the proposed alternatives. They freaked out about the whole reddit isn't actually a place where you can just say or do anything piece but were ok with the new anti-bullying stuff. There just seems to be a group terrified she's an evil SJW who is going to come and take their cookies away."
BadSocialScience,36mvhx,Danimal2485,3,Wed May 20 22:08:15 2015 UTC,"freaked out about the salary negotiations thing without even reading the studies    What do studies say on it? I know reddit freaked out because they saw it as evil SJW feminism, but I get the impression that a no negotiation policy is a blatant corporatist strategy to keep labor cheaper."
BadSocialScience,36mvhx,firedrops,8,Thu May 21 02:15:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was ever a conspiracy. Just studies showed when women come to the table and ask the same way men do for a salary bump it can not only fail but hurt them. Employers see women who negotiate or ask for a raise in a more negative light after the discussion than men who they also decline to give an increase.   Bowles, Hannah Riley, Linda Babcock, and Lei Lai. ""Social incentives for gender differences in the propensity to initiate negotiations: Sometimes it does hurt to ask."" Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 103.1 (2007): 84-103.   This is felt most strongly when stereotypes about women as nurturing, communal, social, etc. are relevant for the job role or in some way are referenced during the discussion. When she is then assertive and asks for a raise it backlashes because it undermines her perceived value. To get the opportunity to be seen as competitive, interested in climbing the corporate ladder, and competent they need to present themselves as atypical women but rejecting the feminine stereotype hurts social perceptions of her and can backlash in the corporate setting.   Tinsley, Catherine H., et al. ""Women at the bargaining table: Pitfalls and prospects."" Negotiation Journal 25.2 (2009): 233-248. Rudman, Laurie A., and Julie E. Phelan. ""Backlash effects for disconfirming gender stereotypes in organizations."" Research in organizational behavior 28 (2008): 61-79.   But then there are also studies that women are also simply less likely to negotiate salary in the first place.    Amanatullah, Emily T., and Michael W. Morris. ""Negotiating gender roles: Gender differences in assertive negotiating are mediated by women’s fear of backlash and attenuated when negotiating on behalf of others."" Journal of personality and social psychology 98.2 (2010): 256.   However, another study suggests that women don't really negotiate less than men but they do get less return for that negotiation. In other words, men and women negotiating for comparable jobs with comparable resumes don't see the same results. Men tend to get a 4.3% increase vs women's 2.7% increase. This was just with MBAs, though.    Gerhart, Barry, and Sara Rynes. ""Determinants and consequences of salary negotiations by male and female MBA graduates."" Journal of Applied Psychology 76.2 (1991): 256.   So there has been a lot of debate about how to best handle this. It isn't fair to give women an entirely different metric or system for salary discussions. But clearly there are a lot of socio-cultural hurdles to having equal outcomes. One solution has simply been to not do salary negotiations with anyone. Salary baseline amounts for each title are equal and openly known. Raises are standardized metrics associated with performance. And if someone negotiates for a raise for their job everyone with that title gets the bump. No stress about salary negotiations or whether you're getting the same as the person in the cubicle next to you. Shy guys, women, people of atypical ages for the position, etc. should all fair equally as long as they are competent at their jobs.   Edit: Though I suspect you're right in the sense that it makes them look good and eliminates the need for the salary cushion. I used to work HR at a big bio-tech company and for good positions we always had to get approval for both the baseline and how much we could bump it up if they played hardball. Now budgets, hiring salary approvals, and all are much easier plus you probably spend less on salary. And you look like you care about women! Win win for the C class execs.   Similar thing for donating to charities or going green. If you can save money and get good PR why not?"
BadSocialScience,36mvhx,Danimal2485,3,Thu May 21 12:25:02 2015 UTC,"Oh I must have phrased my question badly because I don't think there's a conspiracy or anything-I think you addressed all I was trying to say in your edit. I totally agree that the negotiating process ends up favoring men, I just worry this solution ends up hurting middle class people more than anything else by making both genders take less-and I'm suspicious that is the real purpose of it. I mean it's smart if you think about it, if you set the bar at 30k and you usually hire 10 people a year-men at 33k and women at 31k-and you make a new policy saying no one can go past 30k anymore-well you've probably saved about 20k a year. In this case we get more equality in one sense but trade it off or less class equality.   So I don't know a good solution to solving the gap, but this is why I think this is more of a pro corporate solution, that's not really about equality. That's why this policy caught my attention. Other than that I like the changes Pao has planned for the site, because they really do need to do something about harassment."
BadSocialScience,36mvhx,firedrops,3,Fri May 22 00:11:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah agreed about the salary savings being the true motivators. Even if she has high minded goals I doubt that's the entire reasoning everyone else went along with it. And I agree about the problem of solving one issue only to exacerbate another. I don't really have a great solution to the negotiation debate either, though. There are all kinds of self help books to teach women how to overcome but clearly we need to address the structural issues as well. But how to do that fairly and productively isn't easy.  Of course most objections to the policy aren't about that. At least not the ones that make it to the front page"

Paired with things like   “Murder accounted for 6.0% of deaths across the sample, but was the cause of 51% of deaths in rap musicians and 51.5% of deaths for hip hop musicians, to date,” Kenny wrote. “This could be due to these genres’ strong associations with drug-related crime and gang culture.”   and   “It’s a cautionary tale to some degree,” Kenny said in a phone interview with The Washington Post. “People who go into rap music or hip hop or punk, they’re in a much more occupational hazard profession compared to war. We don’t lose half our army in a battle.”   It seems to lead one to the conclusion that going into Hip-Hop/Rap leaves you with 50% or more chance of being murdered, when this sample is looking at Hip-Hop/Rap musicians that are already dead, ignoring the relative age of the genre as well as those that are, in fact, still alive.  Of course, the person conducting the study did address this:   “In the case of the newer genres, it’s worth pointing out that members of these genres have not yet lived long enough to fall into the highest-risk ages for heart- and liver-related illnesses,” she wrote. “Consequently, they had the lowest rates of death in these categories.”   Which is all very well, but it could do a clearer job of stressing just what the numbers actually show. I'm not too taken with the methodology."

An obvious example is that the non African population most genetically distinct from African populations are the so-called negritos of southeast Asia. They were called such because early Europeans thought they were African based on physical identification. Genetic populations do exist to a point, bit they don't really map onto social definitions of race.  Here is a little thing on this: http://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_04-experts-01-09.htm"

BadSocialScience,36h2t2,reginhild,18,Tue May 19 09:59:40 2015 UTC,"Don't forget his opinions on capitalism from the same thread.    It depends how you define capitalism. The earliest economics were capitalistic if you define it as a system based on exchanging the value of labour via some some other measure. It wasn't money but instead trade goods.   -on capitalism not being a natural state of affairs   Trade IS capitalism.   -on trade being distinct from capitalism.  Apparently if you change the definition of a thing to fit your views, that thing suddenly becomes anything you need it to be. Capitalism doesn't need a strict definition if /u/THHUXLEY needs it to have existed by another, barely recognizable definition for all of human history.   EDIT: Bonus round: Some guy doesn't put any effort into his cunning ruse that he's an anthropologist, who has read Weber."

Some of the things said that people, in the thread at least, are reacting to seem to be the standard tension between Biological and Socio-Cultural Anthropology, u/THHUXLEY seems to be more on the Biological side. He definitely did not defend himself as well as he could have, although I wouldn't have agreed with him anyway mostly because I believe it is incredibly difficult to prove universals simply because of the sheer amount of data you have to know.  As for the list of ""Universals"" they are either vague and meaningless or, occasionally, are just wrong. I know, for example, Strathern argues that the people she worked with in PNG don't have property as a concept. Leaders is another one that I think has shaky foundations.  I was too afraid to get embroiled in it yesterday and was going to ask in that thread, how did ""Cultural Relativism nearly destroy Social Science in the 90s""? Nobody on the thread won't to get into the debate on that matter.  I don't know what to really make of it all. I'm guessing u/THHUXLEY didn't learn the same type of anthropology as me, which is entirely possible there are many fields. If he's in Bio Anth the idea of seeking universals makes more sense, it is easier to be a positivist in those circles, but if they are in Socio-Cultural Anthropology that's an uncommon perspective to have, but I imagine it might exist. (This is not to say Biological Anthropology is set on finding universals, it is just as diverse in perspectives as Socio-Cultural Anthropology).   I probably have contributed a lot to the discussion of the bad social science in that thread (although there is quite a bit), but I was more confused by what the basis for the claims was and what lead them to those conclusions. I wish people had said what field of anthropology they were coming from in that thread, it allows for a better understanding of their statements."

My personal favourite bit was looking at neandertals as a lot of evidence suggests that they were just as intelligent as us, but did not have the need or opportunity to develop the technology Homo sapians did. Basically we covered a heck of a lot of ground in a semester and a bit.

Surely it's ludicrous to think yours is correct and all others were and are not.   I've bolded the part that is the most egregious misuse of social science. First, anthropologists do not observe single groups and then make normative claims about all people everywhere. Second, the goal of anthropology is not to observe groups and then use any aspect of their ""primitive beliefs"" to justify western exceptionalism. Third, this is clearly not how something as integral to social lives as religion works: anthropologists examine how people become empowered by belief systems (both in spite of and in confrontation with other such systems) but do not end the analysis with ""wake up religious sheeple"". Because religion is important to lots of people and makes their lives meaningful in unique, sometimes conflicting ways: an anthropologist asks why this happens, a bad social scientist claims atheism as the supreme intellectual paradigm and then jabbers about scientism.    In short: an anthropologist would not so much as find the first claim suspect but would definitely question it (or the intention behind it) in the context of the claim that this means all religious people are silly."

Those are beliefs I don't often see touted by other anthropologists and are part of why I'd assume OP marked this as bad social science"

Cards on the table, Discipline and Punish is the book that has probably had the single biggest influence on me, and Foucault was pretty open about his stance on psychology.  To me, psych seems to be insufficiently critical of the politics of subjectivisation (people are abnormal, disordered, or maladaptive without much query of what they're adapting to) and somewhat prone to scientism with an emphasis on internal, brain-related causes.  Am I going to get meta-linked or are there any social scientists that have made such critiques? I'm smart enough not to complain that all psychology is a crock of shit because, like, everything's constructed by the system man, and I've been to therapists myself in the past, but I feel like there might be a bunch of objections that have been made by people like Foucault."
BadSocialScience,36dq1c,mrsamsa,21,Mon May 18 17:09:16 2015 UTC,"There's a voluminous literature on the problems or biases of psychology research that makes similar criticisms; much of it is in psychology journals and is produced by psychologists. Psychology is actually a pretty diverse field, both in terms of methodological self-awareness and in terms of substantive focus. Many social psychologists, for example, are well attuned to processes of subjectification, and are able to study psychological interventions as part of those processes. Though not from a Foucauldian perspective, of course, since that would effectively dissolve the subject to begin with. Some of the most thoughtful and informed criticisms of unreflexive pathologisation of non-typical minds that I have read has come from psychiatrists, who bestow it with the added bonus of expressing it in language more accessible to scientists otherwise unfamiliar with French theorists and their aspiring emulators."

BadSocialScience,36dq1c,mrsamsa,7,Mon May 18 17:53:44 2015 UTC,"OK, I have read some of his relevant work (Madness and Civilization esp.) and I agree with a lot of the points. You might also want to look at Nikolas Rose's work -- a former biologist who is now a Foucaultian-style sociologist. As Twittgenstein remarked below, there is a lot of self-critique on this within psychology/psychiatry and sweeping dismissals of clinical and other research is just ridiculous. Another problem is conflating clinical and abnormal psychology with all of psychology. I think Foucault himself (or maybe it was someone else, I don't remember) used the term ""psy-practices"" in some places.  As for neuroscience, I'd take a look at things like Critical Neuroscience or Steven Rose's (he's Nikolas' brother) work. Again, many of these criticisms are coming from neuroscientists themselves.  I'd also say that certain segments of psychology went wrong in largely ignoring neuroscience. Classical cognitive science and psychology was in fact heavily anti-reductionist in this way in its early days. This rejection was based on a great extent to Fodor's influential ""multiple realizability"" argument."
BadSocialScience,36dq1c,redwhiskeredbubul,11,Mon May 18 19:46:34 2015 UTC,"I'm unsure what you're reading to give you the impression that psychologists accept such things.   To me, psych seems to be insufficiently critical of the politics of subjectivisation (people are abnormal, disordered, or maladaptive without much query of what they're adapting to)   This is a massive topic in psychology and there is so much discussion on what it means to be ""disordered"". The main definition (broadly speaking) is that a behavioral or cognitive pattern meets some combination of the ""4 D's"": deviance, dysfunction, distress, and danger.   So if there is a statistical deviation from the norm, the problem is large and significant enough that it's causing noticeable problems in the person's life, the person is subjectively reporting that this is upsetting to them, and/or there is a chance they'll hurt themselves or others, then there's a good chance we're talking about a mental disorder. The specifics of each of those things (like where exactly to define ""dysfunction"" will differ for each disorder and is usually clearly spelled out for whatever test they are using to measure it, which of course has significant discussion behind it saying why the line was drawn there).   This definition is unashamedly entirely culture specific and encourages the person to adapt to the environment rather than looking at whether the environment is healthy and should be changed, but this is purely a pragmatic approach. Ideally we'd change the world and make it better but even if we could, it's not going to happen overnight and we'd still have our patient who can't get out of bed, or clean or feed themselves, to help.   This isn't to say that psychologists aren't looking at our environment and trying to change them (this is one of the goals of the ""positive psychology"" approach) but it does address your concern that psychologists aren't aware of this issue.    and somewhat prone to scientism with an emphasis on internal, brain-related causes.   Generally psychologists are arguing the opposite, and most of the criticisms of the applications and methodology of neuroscience has come from psychologists. Satel and Lilienfeld's ""Brainwashed: The Seductive Appeal of Mindless Neuroscience"" is a great book collating a lot of the arguments and research behind it.   Also keep in mind that these concerns are only really relevant to clinical psychology, which is a subset of psychology."

BadSocialScience,36dq1c,Bahamuts_Bike,4,Mon May 18 23:04:53 2015 UTC,"From the point of view of clinical psychology, given what I know, I think there is a fair amount of concern for the historical and social context of clinical practice and diagnosis, but it tends to be more heavily emphasized in Social Work tracks. Without a deep appreciation of the context around a particular diagnosis, for example, it's hard to see how Foucault's theories have concrete applications to what you do in practice. Also, Foucault tends to write against the grain of the whole discussion of mental illness, which is can be hard to grasp in the context of clinical practicioners who basically want to defend the legitimacy of their approaches relative to familiar criticisms.       For that reason, the clinically related stuff I've seen that integrates some Foucault tends to be about very specific topics and social justice related. A lot of it also seems to be written by psychoanalysts. A really good example that came out recently is The Puerto Rican Syndrome, which is about the history of the concept of hysteria and its modern descendents (for example HPD and somatoform disorders) within the context of Puerto Rican politics and culture. How Schizophrenia Became a Black Disease is another one, though I've not actually read it."
BadSocialScience,36dq1c,Snugglerific,5,Mon May 18 21:25:35 2015 UTC,"I largely agree with this —without maybe the close allegiance to Foucault. It is unclear that psychology manages to escape the pseudo-analytic of things like rational choice theory: that is, it provides a nuanced picture of how the status quo is (or how the status quo shapes us) but then goes on to make claims as if this post-facto description represented a priori insight. To me this is an extremely dangerous paradigm in social science —consequently, why psych/econ get more attention from non social scientists— because it does, as you said, reproduce a certain scientism that delimits the scope of further inquiry and present imagination. If we know, for example, that gender differences are innate —they are not, but psych studies often show internalization then claim naturalization of phenomena— then what is the point in talking about socially altering fundamentally natural problems?   This is not to say all psychology is ""bad"" nor that it need to always make these types of claims that conflate socialization and nature, but I do also see these problems persisting. To me the critique voiced in the other reddit thread is weird because psych is exactly the type of social science the status quo (reactionaries, no less) need. Add this to the fact that a lot of pysch students do not learn social theory like their peers —I know some that didn't even read Marx until some time into grad school, let alone even Foucault— and you do get a paradigm in claiming insight that, as someone from an anthropological background, I am personally skeptical of."
BadSocialScience,36dq1c,Bahamuts_Bike,8,Mon May 18 17:30:42 2015 UTC,"It is unclear that psychology manages to escape the pseudo-analytic of things like rational choice theory....   The opposite is the case. The cognitive biases and heuristics research program initiated by Kahneman and Tversky is directly opposed to rational choice.   If we know, for example, that gender differences are innate —they are not, but psych studies often show internalization then claim naturalization of phenomena— then what is the point in talking about socially altering fundamentally natural problems?  If we know, for example, that gender differences are innate —they are not, but psych studies often show internalization then claim naturalization of phenomena— then what is the point in talking about socially altering fundamentally natural problems?   This seems to be the product of some nativists and the relentless promotion of this rhetoric in pop sci. If you look at the original experiments, many do not remark on the innateness or lack thereof of the results. This is usually misrepresented or amplified in synthetic or pop sci lit. Many psych researchers on gender differences (Tavris, Spelke, Shibley-Hyde, etc.) dispute this.   Add this to the fact that a lot of pysch students do not learn social theory like their peers...   This is a huge problem. Many psych students seem to have little to zero exposure to social theory."

BadSocialScience,36dq1c,mrsamsa,7,Mon May 18 19:39:15 2015 UTC,"I don't really think there's much to refute. During Szasz's time there were ethical issues in psychology and he made some great points about not viewing mental illness as being the flipside of ""normal"", about treating patients with respect and dignity, about being careful not to separate the person from the treatment, etc., and psychology took all of the good stuff on board.  Szasz's critiques simply don't really apply to current psychology because we no longer really do the things he was mostly concerned about."

Yes, it's a shame that his critiques have continued on despite the changes made as his name has gone from being an important and influential figure in the field to a name associated with crank beliefs..    However, there were a lot of problems with the philosophical underpinnings of his critiques. For one, he denied mental illness entirely, arguing that the term could only be applied to the body. If you could find a biological basis for it, then it was not a mental illness, but a matter of neurology, effectively shifting the goalposts.   Was that his argument? I thought he argued against the overly biological approach of psychiatrists and psychologists of the time who believed that mental disorders were caused by the brain. So I was under the impression that he was questioning them on their own claims, meaning that if they were 'brain diseases' as claimed then where is the medical and biological evidence for them?   Maybe I've only read generous interpretations of what he was saying but I thought he was part of the impetus for shifting away from the biological view and accepting something closer to the biopsychosocial model. Hence the changed in terminology from 'mental illness' to 'mental disorder', to avoid those biological and disease-based implications (not that Szasz was satisfied with that switch).   He was also an exemplar of overzealous Popper-ianism.   To be fair, weren't a lot of people at that time (and arguably still are today)?"
BadSocialScience,36dq1c,Snugglerific,4,Mon May 18 21:39:40 2015 UTC,"He did argue against the sort of hyper-reductionism of psychology and culture to purely neourological or biological factors. However, he denied claims of mental illness from two directions. On the biological side, he claimed that any mental illness tied to neurobiology was not mental illness, but a brain disorder. (In other terms, diseases only affect physical bodies. The mind is not a physical entity. Therefore, mental illness does not exist.) On the other hand, any purely psychological explanations were dismissed as normative judgements. In his paper ""The Myth of Mental Illness,"" he writes about brain diseases:   To sum up what has been said thus far: I have tried to show that for those who regard mental symptoms as signs of brain disease, the concept of mental illness is unnecessary and misleading.  For what they mean is that people so labeled suffer from diseases of the brain; and, if that is what they mean, it would seem better for the sake of clarity to say that and not something else.   http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Szasz/myth.htm  ETA: I'd add another way in which his critiques are now dated, which is how heavily he attacked Freudian psychoanalysis, which was way more popular at the time he began writing."
BadSocialScience,36dq1c,mrsamsa,4,Mon May 18 22:00:02 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, any purely psychological explanations were dismissed as normative judgements.   Maybe I need to re-read ""The Myth of Mental Illness"" but I think this is more of a semantic distinction he's making rather than an actual issue with the concept of a mental disorder.  From what I remember he wasn't necessarily against psychotherapy or helping people with problems in life (he claimed throughout his life that he wasn't anti-psych), he was against what he viewed as a mistaken attempt to be scientific, a coercive approach to diagnosis, and the normative judgements. But he still accepted what are essentially mental problems:   Our adversaries are not demons, witches, fate, or mental illness.  We have no enemy whom we can fight, exorcise, or dispel by ""cure.""  What we do have are problems in living -- whether these be biologic, economic, political, or sociopsychological.  In this essay I was concerned only with problems belonging in the last mentioned category, and within this group mainly with those pertaining to moral values.  The field to which modern psychiatry addresses itself is vast, and I made no effort to encompass it all. My argument was limited to the proposition that mental illness is a myth, whose function it is to disguise and thus render more palatable the bitter pill of moral conflicts in human relations.   and I think what he's calling ""problems in living"" are essentially mental disorders of today. His concerns just seemed to be with how problems in living were conceptualised in his time (as biological diseases) and how they were addressed by mental health professionals (as normative judgements), but he didn't deny the existence of the 'problems in living' as a whole. Again, maybe I'm being too generous though."
BadSocialScience,36dq1c,Snugglerific,3,Mon May 18 23:14:58 2015 UTC,"True, he wasn't against psychotherapy. This might be more relevant to his libertarian politics. Even if psychotherapists were pushing pseudoscience, he thought that people should be allowed to seem them if the relationship was voluntary. His own practice is recast in the sense of the concept of problems in living as you mention. His concept of problems in living does not seem to be directly analogous to mental illness or mental disorder, though. It seems to be more analogous to ""ethical dilemma"" or maybe even ""existential crises."" I say this because there are certain disorders which he dismissed entirely, such as schizophrenia which he called ""fake"" and referred to ""malingerers"" who were merely faking symptoms. Another way the Szaszian conception of problems in living does not comport with contemporary biopsychosocial models is that the Szaszian conception is extremely dualistic (seemingly an overreaction to hyper-reductionist medical models). Biological, psychological, and social are not unified. There is a dichotomy between brain diseases or problems of living. You go to the medical doctor for the biological and the psychotherapist for the psychosocial.   You're also correct in that he dissociated himself from the larger anti-psychiatry movement and didn't argue that psychotherapy/psychiatry should be entirely elminated. However, I look at this claim with some suspicion due to his involvement with the CCHR, a Scientology front group. (Although from what I've read, Szasz was a staunch atheist and never believed in Scientology or worked directly with the church.)  In any case, it's been quite a while since I read about the Szaszian debates, so maybe I am missing some things here."

Okay, lets start with definitions.  Sex is defined as ""either of the two major forms of individuals that occur in many species and that are distinguished respectively as female or male especially on the basis of their reproductive organs and structures""  Gender as ""the behavioral, cultural, or psychological traits typically associated with one sex""  While the general public uses those interchangeable (and as you see the second link also refers to gender as ""sex"") the terms are used different. Gender is the social construct. Sex is what you're born with.  Feminist argue for now at least over 20 years for a seperation of gender and sex.  Then there is the case of transgendered people but I'm not equipped enough to get into that."
BadSocialScience,368lax,TheKasp,13,Tue May 19 08:47:36 2015 UTC,Have you never even heard of a transgender person before?  Here's a Buzzfeed video about a man who is biologically a woman has chosen not to bother passing as a man.
BadSocialScience,368lax,thatoneguy54,-6,Sun May 17 20:10:58 2015 UTC,I was under the impression that it was politically incorrect to say that a trans woman is in any way male/a man. I thought that their gender and sex was both female. That's why their birth certificate gets rewritten (to alter their sex recorded there); that's why gender reassignment surgery used to be called a sex change. Am I wrong?
BadSocialScience,368lax,greenrd,8,Sun May 17 21:00:23 2015 UTC,"That entirely depends on whether they get a reassignment surgery. Many, many trans people do not get reassignment surgery for many reasons (finances, risks, FtM penises are not really functional, etc).   I don't think there's anything wrong with saying a transman who still has a vagina is biologically female. The vagina doesn't make them less of a man, but it still means that they're of the female sex.  Edit: male to female"

BadSocialScience,368lax,fps916,34,Sun May 17 13:24:18 2015 UTC,"Funny enough, this is sorta similar to the kind of logic TERFs use to argue that all expressions of gender are invalid, especially nonconforming expressions, when they bump up against third-wavers. The way it goes is that you can either admit that gender is pure construct and be a real feminist or you can be a (insert ominous sounds of animals fleeing in panic, thunder striking, etc) liberal feminist and have a completely inconsistent worldview. I'm not a big proponent of horseshoe theory but, well, yeah."
BadSocialScience,368lax,KingOfSockPuppets,35,Sun May 17 05:56:15 2015 UTC,"TERFs use to argue that all expressions of gender are invalid   What really bugs me about TERFS is that their philosophy and politics clash to create pretty extreme cognitive dissonance. On the one hand, they often say that gender don't real. But on the other their politics are super hardcore ovaries-to-the-wall woman identity politics good. They're fundamentally incompatible positions that negate each other which makes having discussions with them extremely frustrating, especially since being trans I'm on the boot end of their politics.  They also seem to have exceeded the Bechdel event horizon and become so left they're right."
BadSocialScience,368lax,Danimal2485,11,Sun May 17 07:44:47 2015 UTC,"I think they view gender as something forced on them-that yes ""woman"" is a complete social construct(to them), but it was created largely by a patriarchal society, and forced on them, and their actions were policed to only allow a specific range of acceptable expession because they were born with a vagina. So in that instance I don't think having an identity politics is necessarily contradictory to their philosophy. I'm not a TERF though so I could be wrong, that's just the understanding I took away from some of their writings."
BadSocialScience,368lax,SteadilyTremulous,20,Sun May 17 10:30:17 2015 UTC,"I'm going to borrow from John Stoltenberg's introduction to his book Refusing to be a Man. The radical feminist view here is parallel with James Baldwin's view on race: while race is totally a social construct, ""If you insist upon being white, I have no alternative but to be black."" For radical feminists, gender is forced on them, but if people insist on being men they have no choice but to be women. I'm assuming the TERF view is in line with this, although it's worth noting that Stoltenberg is trans-inclusionary and has clashed with TERFs in recent years."
BadSocialScience,368lax,KingOfSockPuppets,8,Sun May 17 13:23:00 2015 UTC,"Well the TERFs I've interacted with have been fairly clear that they consider gender as a system to be oppressive. the only liberation to be found is in destroying the whole thing. That's what's wrong with trans women (other than 'mutilating' our perfectly healthy bodies);  by expressing ourselves to have a gender preference we're buying into the whole system of gender and tacitly supporting it. For at least those TERFS their politics don't make sense given that ""man vs. woman"" is absolutely core to their worldview, politics, and identity. However this view might only be limited to reddit, or only expressed when interacting with transgender people so they can claim to be 'gender critical'.  I don't have any real familiarity with their writings however. For obvious reasons I don't really seek out things like the Transsexual Empire to read."

BadSocialScience,366619,EmergencyChocolate,10,Sat May 16 15:08:06 2015 UTC,"The entire article ignores most of history to shape its own narrative. Instead of discussing slave culture as a place where a more American/subversive version of ""shade"" may have legitimately incubated and been honed, it breezily asserts that ""sidelong insults"" simply didn't exist before slavery in America. That's the central thrust of the whole piece. And it goes on to assert that even though ""shade"" is a hallmark of drag culture, it is also one of the ""African-American art forms that have been taken up by mainstream culture"" and is somehow in danger of being diluted by internet culture. The whole article is an incoherent jumble and it's annoying to see that it got column space in the NYT.  What bothers me the most about it is that instead of presenting itself as a style/trend piece about a specific sort of insult that's currently media-friendly and popular on social media, it dons a veneer of academic/sociological authority. It's a weird sort of cultural revisionism I see pop up occasionally.  I am not really on the Gawker media hate train, but I do think its worth noting that Anna Holmes, the author of this piece, was the founder of Jezebel.com. I can't help feeling that her roots in blog culture enabled this sloppy social science.  No excuses for the NYT eds who published it, though.

Keith Brown summarized her (among others) in his recent piece saying :   Second, in a discourse that remained masculinist and heteronormative, the term bore connotations of softness and effeminacy. Its association with preparation for peacekeeping rather than combat only stigmatized the term further, because the skill set of peacekeeping, which demands nuance, restraint, and negotiation, has been similarly categorized within the U.S. military as feminine and therefore unmilitary or civilian.

The sub has an unfortunate significant under representation from feminists, which is problematic and makes it less productive. So are the majority of comments critical of this post? Certainly. But what exactly is disrespectful or not taking it seriously? That everyone's attitude is respectful, again, is truly remarkable. There are other places that are better for certain topics and conversations, but if you wish to engage respectfully with people of vastly different belief, where do you go? Where else are all views welcomed and taken seriously? What other community so actively encourages dissenting views and polite rhetoric?    Its problems are significant, and it really only excels at this niche (which really is the point of the sub). But it's the only community in this niche on the entire internet I have ever found. I think may have come across as praising the sub a little too hard; it seemed that you may be implying that a red piller on the board is a bad thing, but I would argue the contrary.

I... don't see that.     The top post, for instance, seriously asks us to consider if addressing toxic masculinity is worth more expensive buildings because men demand higher wages for dangerous jobs. What that has to do with anything or why he believes that already isn't the case (what does he think construction workers are paid?!) is beyond me.     Although it would be difficult for him to have said that more ineloquently than he did and his example was spectacularly absurd, underneath the terrible rhetoric was a solid point. Toxic masculinity isn't completely toxic. In fact, components of it are necessary for many men in physically dangerous jobs. So while people like me who don't take these jobs (I did previously, but do so no longer) can easily abandon stoicism and aggressiveness, for example, these are indispensable tools for many that do legitimately keep people safe. If you desire to truly change toxic masculinity than you need to come up with a way to help gruff men and not just ask them to shoot themselves in the feet. The point of the criticism is that this post and academic study in general are completely ignorant of working class masculinity and why components of it will necessarily always exist. That is certainly relevant.     The response to the top comment is about child labor...wut?     We want to dismantle toxic masculinity, yet its existence is necessary for the creation of the entire infrastructure we live in. We are quick to point out the flaws in the culture, slow to realize that there are significant benefits to us and that causing real change is going to require more than just telling people that they're wrong. Child labor is a reasonable analogy- we are quick to say it's wrong, but it's convenient. We emotionally care about it a great deal, but in practice? Not so much. When the rubber hits the road we'll predominately take the $20 shoes made by a child and push aside the difficult and uncomfortable thoughts. Why isn't this analogy appropriate?    The second top-rated comment seems to be accusing firedrops of racism and sexism? more wut! In a follow-up response they state their dislike of sociology because it generalizes too much, apparently we should think of observable behaviors across groups as a coincidence?        Ehhhhh... kind of. The meaning of Karmaze's statement is that there isn't any discussion about what creates and propagates toxic masculinity, which is heavily enforced by both sexes. Identifying problems is certainly productive conversation, and so I can't fault this discussion specifically. Over all, however, there is an overwhelming tendency to completely ignore the enforcers of toxic masculinity and to focus only on the performers.    Regarding the sociology comment, I agree that it's not a quality criticism, but I also don't see why this should be an example as to the discussion being low quality. Low quality criticisms are inescapable in any gender issues community. I'm sure I wouldn't have to look very hard in this thread to find some- I'm not sure what point you're trying to make.     The next comment down is asserting that the REAL problem with the discussion around toxic masculinity isn't that MRA-types don't understand it (observably true) but that it's framed as a women's issue. I don't actually see that, typically I see toxic masculinity framed as a series of problematic behaviors that men will engage in.      We are in complete agreement. And this is to me a good example of the real problems in the discussion, which ultimately stems from a significant under representation of feminists. Yes, there are many bad criticisms, but again, I don't know where else I can go for the quality discussion that does take place.    The next guy makes a bizarre comment where he challenges academics to out-lift a fellow redditor, ostensibly because weight-lifting is how you prove your point in academia?     That guy is a red piller. He is welcome just as a TERF would be. Again, in a community built on encouraging controversial debate, surely this is a good thing?       Do you see where I'm going with this? It's a trainwreck of a sub if that thread is the best it gets.     So I think that you missed the meaning in some of the comments that you quoted. This isn't spectacularly relevant to your point, however, as there are other comments that we would agree are simply bad. But this is what is so important to me- if the only place I can have quality, respectful conversation about highly controversial issues with various perspectives is on a train wreck, than I will rejoice that I am able to do it all. As I stated previously, the sub's problems aren't insignificant, but it is the only place that I know of where I know I can ask any question, no matter how hard or controversial, and I will not bet met with hostility or made unwelcome. Sincere discussion > no discussion, which is what I'm finding everywhere else."
BadSocialScience,35yc5l,thatoneguy54,7,Sat May 16 18:18:03 2015 UTC,"Amusingly, someone actually badmouthed me over there this morning and I wrote a simple response inviting him to inbox me if he wasn't comfortable addressing my points here. It was promptly deleted and I received a message about not being an approved submitter, I'm starting to see why there aren't many feminists over there.   Toxic masculinity isn't completely toxic. In fact, components of it are necessary for many men in physically dangerous jobs. So while people like me who don't take these jobs (I did previously, but do so no longer) can easily abandon stoicism and aggressiveness, for example, these are indispensable tools for many that do legitimately keep people safe.    I think you're making the mistake most everyone is in the femradebates thread, you're conflating masculinity with toxic masculinity despite protests to the contrary. The issue not simply one of finding undesirable traits but the hegemonic effect their enforcement has on everyone else who is male, toxic masculinity seeks to make itself the only acceptable form of masculinity and men regularly police each other to enforce it. It's not a matter of merely being stoic and aggressive but also violent, shaming of men who display emotion, sexually aggressive (to the point where a man will seek to ""wear down"" a woman's resistance to his advances), and emasculate men who do not conform.  The terper who questioned if academics who study masculinity even lift is enforcing it, he's stating that masculinity and an understanding of it are connected to one's ability to be a ""certified alpha"". The comment we're discussing here is enforcing it, he's excusing the effects of toxic masculinity as an economic and social necessity as a this is just the way men are point.   We want to dismantle toxic masculinity, yet its existence is necessary for the creation of the entire infrastructure we live in.   So was slavery, child labor, feudalism, etc, etc. The mere fact that something forms a foundational part of where we happen to be now isn't a powerful defense for keeping it around, especially when you're talking to people who are wholly unsatisfied with where we are now.   The meaning of Karmaze's statement is that there isn't any discussion about what creates and propagates toxic masculinity, which is heavily enforced by both sexes   I don't understand their objection then, they literally just answered it themselves. Toxic masculinity is propagated via its enforcement through both sexes, what created it is a slightly different matter as many behaviors we exhibit can be difficult to trace.   Over all, however, there is an overwhelming tendency to completely ignore the enforcers of toxic masculinity and to focus only on the performers.   I wouldn't say so, those two groups are hardly mutually exclusive.   but I also don't see why this should be an example as to the discussion being low quality   It's not that comment by itself, but the quality of the discussion entirely.   I don't know where else I can go for the quality discussion that does take place.   If you're actually wanting an understanding of sociologist's opinions on these issues, there actually are academics on this sub. If you don't want to be part of it, then I could suggest /r/asksocialscience and /r/AskAnthropology.   That guy is a red piller. He is welcome just as a TERF would be. Again, in a community built on encouraging controversial debate, surely this is a good thing?   The sub has a list of approved submitters, this effort at curation has still left the quality of discussion very low. I suspect the reason for this is maybe the mods rarely approve feminists? Or maybe approving so many MRA-types gives the impression that feminists aren't wanted? Either way, the conversation is extremely one-sided, to the point that I would honestly consider the sub to be a circlejerk."
BadSocialScience,35yc5l,Leinadro,0,Sat May 16 20:13:59 2015 UTC,"First off, thank you very much for engaging me in this discussion. This is the sort of discourse that I search for but rarely find.      It was promptly deleted and I received a message about not being an approved submitter, I'm starting to see why there aren't many feminists over there.     That's actually a community control measure, and it's pretty effective. I haven't seen trolls or insincere people there ever. It is highly moderated, which given the subject matter is a really good idea. Also, amusingly, some MRAs are convinced that the mods are crazy feminists or feminist-leaning due to the large amount of moderation, which they view as an assault on liberty that no self respecting egalitarian or MRA would make.   I think you're making the mistake most everyone is in the femradebates thread, you're conflating masculinity with toxic masculinity despite protests to the contrary.     I am actively trying to not do that, and I don't see myself doing that, so if after this post you still think I am doing so, please point it out.     The issue not simply one of finding undesirable traits but the hegemonic effect their enforcement has on everyone else who is male, toxic masculinity seeks to make itself the only acceptable form of masculinity and men regularly police each other to enforce it. It's not a matter of merely being stoic and aggressive but also violent, shaming of men who display emotion, sexually aggressive (to the point where a man will seek to ""wear down"" a woman's resistance to his advances), and emasculate men who do not conform.     But this is what I think I'm talking about. Let's take one example. Say we look at a physical, potentially dangerous job that require everyone to be on guard at all times and often to think fast to avoid damage or harm. New guy comes into the job, and he's going to get hazed. Although some may be doing it purely for sport, this is actually serving a really important purpose. I'm not saying that I condone the way it's frequently done, but the necessary components of it will always be there.     Does the new guy think quickly, or is he a hazard to himself and others? Does he have integrity and can he be relied upon? Would he harm himself or in some other way make a significant sacrifice to protect others, the project, or the company?     And this aggressive behavior that requires one to ""man up"" and fight back will never end while among peers as one will never stop being a potential liability. In the office where one has plenty of time to contemplate and discuss issues before acting, this behavior is actively harmful and of little benefit.     This is absolutely toxic masculinity and meets two of the criteria you mentioned. Shaming weakness is necessary, as weakness gets people hurt and has no place on the job site. After work when having beers I agree that it is misplaced, but the best answer to weakness on the job site absolutely is stoicism. And emasculating men is necessary- it's brutal watching someone being slow to learn and getting a lot of harassment from everyone, but I don't want to work with that guy, either. Putting your safety in the hands of a knucklehead is an extremely unpleasant experience. And when I enforced this masculinity, I would do it respectfully, saying that complaining has no place here, that having his head in the clouds is legitimately dangerous, etc. I wouldn't call it hazing, but it sucks to receive almost as much.      The terper...     Oh yes, absolutely. I'm not delighted at what he's saying, I'm just delighted that he's there. He is sincere and respectful and as such deserves a place in the conversation. He nutty tho     So was slavery, child labor, feudalism, etc, etc. The mere fact that something forms a foundational part of where we happen to be now isn't a powerful defense for keeping it around, especially when you're talking to people who are wholly unsatisfied with where we are now.     Oh, absolutely. There's much of toxic masculinity that simply needs to go. But we should endeavor to understand why these aspects of it exist and if they serve any purpose. And if they are actually productive traits to the majority or a subset, than we require a more informed and nuanced view and shouldn't try to remove them completely and take away peoples' tools, but to modify it and turn it into something productive. This is something I have never heard discussed from an academic perspective.     I don't understand their objection then, they literally just answered it themselves. Toxic masculinity is propagated via its enforcement through both sexes   Why is there so little discussion on the causes of toxic masculinity here and elsewhere? I think that is a key part of understanding it. Men's behavior will change when culture and the expectations on them change. Pointing out behavioral problems without any interest in changing the causing factors is not just futile, but actively harmful. It will cause an enormous amount of resentment among men who are now stuck between a rock and a hard place as they desire to meet these new explicitly declared expectations but then have all the old expectations strongly implicitly enforced. If that man receives simplistic criticism of the aspects of masculinity that he requires than his resentment will be much stronger.    I wouldn't say so, those two groups are hardly mutually exclusive.     Were we to discuss the high rates of crime that exist in poverty it would be unfair to focus on the criminals and not pay any mind to the significant causing factors. Those in poverty and those that propagate poverty are also hardly mutually exclusive. If the conversation were specifically about one aspect of the problem than that is of course fine, but if the general theme is ignoring the causing factors than that sends a strong implicit message that we're more interested in blaming than fixing.     If you're actually wanting an understanding of sociologist's opinions on these issues, there actually are academics on this sub. If you don't want to be part of it, then I could suggest /r/asksocialscience[1] and /r/AskAnthropology[2] .     I am really glad to have found this space, and I will absolutely subscribe to those others, as well. Over the last year or so I have become fairly familiar with the various gender issues communities and their perspectives, but I would very much like to learn more from an academic perspective. Thank you very much for pointing me to these subs.     The sub has a list of approved submitters, this effort at curation has still left the quality of discussion very low. I suspect the reason for this is maybe the mods rarely approve feminists? Or maybe approving so many MRA-types gives the impression that feminists aren't wanted?     The mods are certainly happy to have feminists. You may be right that feminists may dislike having so few ideological allies. The social network problem, I guess. It's the Google+ of feminist communities. =P     Either way, the conversation is extremely one-sided, to the point that I would honestly consider the sub to be a circlejerk.     Well, it depends on how lenient you are with the definition. If you mean to say that there is a majority consensus, than yes. There's like six times as many non feminists as feminists, or something. They did a survey recently and it's pretty bad. In some of the petty and smaller topics in can definitely feel really hive minded. But they actively encourage and welcome feminists and their perspectives, which to me is the complete opposite of a circle jerk.     There have been enough quality discussions that were highly informative and productive to make me absolutely love it despite its glaring faults.  It's unfortunate that you haven't had positive experiences with the subreddit, but if you have any interest in participating, I and many others would highly value you.    Also, sorry that my writing is so bad- four years in the USAF destroyed my ability to write well. These sentences are horrendous, I know, I'm taking English 101 again soon, so forgive me. Dammit, that one's bad, too.    Thanks again, your time means a lot to me."
BadSocialScience,35yc5l,ChokeZero,7,Sat May 16 22:00:58 2015 UTC,"You're baking a lot of assumptions into your response but you aren't endeavoring to demonstrate why they're true, you're mostly assuming. Why is hazing a healthy way to determine someone's aptitude instead of, say, professionally created and administered aptitude tests? The Russian military has enacted several policies to attempt to curtain the practice of dedovshchina among the ranks, a form of hazing that is often abused by more senior military members for an easier life, where more senior soldiers will force the junior soldiers to perform their duties and such. When the junior soldiers don't comply, they're typically beaten for it, which has resulted in no shortage of suicides when recruits are worn down by the cycle of abuse.  No doubt you'd say this is bad hazing, but hazing by it's very nature endures because of society's ambivalent view of it. At the macro level we often look on agasp at it's more overt abuses, but at the micro level we shrug off what we see happening around as ""boys being boys"". The problem is that those aforementioned serious abuses rely on the permissiveness of the latter. The suggested attitude you have towards hazing is more-or-less the status quo, no one thinks hazing is good when they see its excesses but everyone ignores it when they can rationalize it as ""harmless"", then the more serious abuses occur when the cameras aren't on and no one is watching. Few people deign to come forward for the fear of the impact it will have on their social status.  Let's return to the subject of dedovshchina, there's actually a really interesting paper (PDF warning) on this topic that makes the claim that the practice of hazing in the Russian military has eroded unit cohesion. One citation in the paper refers to a study that claims the practice of dedovshchina accounts for as much as 50% of causalities among Russian military recruits in the Chechen area. A consistent note when discussing morale is how much the practice of hazing undermined morale, those units with strong traditions of dedovshchina often broke under fire and had higher rates of desertion than those who didn't, Russian conscripts captures by the Chechen rebels often reported on how much better the Chechens and fed and treated them than their own units.  Targets of hazing are expected to stoically endure it, even when the excesses go too far and someone is seriously injured. It can also be used as a litmus test to determine who will ignore the group when they do blatantly illegal things. If you let your college buddies shove something up your ass to prove yourself to them, why wouldn't they expect you to turn a blind eye as they're carrying a woman passed-out drunk into a bedroom? If your friends on your construction crew watched you endure their own hazing, why wouldn't they expect you to ignore OSHA violations when they cut corners or use ill-advised techniques to finish their jobs quicker?  There's actually a lot I could say on the expectation of quiet stoicism in the workplace, such as how an expectation like that could result in ignoring all of the terrible hazing practices I just mentioned. Or how it can lead a person to ignore an injury and come in to work anyway for fear of being thought of as weak. In fact, I actually fail to see why stoicism would be that great of a boon anyway. It seems to me like stoicism is used more as excuse to force people into accepting the status quo, no matter how terrible it is. No one wants to rock the boat for fear being labelled a pussy and emasculated by your peers.   There's much of toxic masculinity that simply needs to go. But we should endeavor to understand why these aspects of it exist and if they serve any purpose.   This is coming from a confusion over terminology, if it's productive and non-harmful by definition it is not toxic masculinity.   Why is there so little discussion on the causes of toxic masculinity here and elsewhere?   Why are you assuming we don't know the causes?"

Firstly because the opposite side is almost as guilty of that as MRAs. The reason I bothered writing a reply in this thread, a month after it was posted was that I noticed a comment by SRSthrowaway mocking those who complain about the demonisation of men. Given that SRS is self admittedly a place to unleash ones hatred and that, in my experience, often things that attempt to give broad descriptions of power structures in society get dumbed down to ""that thing that makes it ok for me to hate x"" (see ""there is nothing wrong with hating your abuser"") in the minds of quite a few people in the social justice sphere (especially of the ""empowerment through abuse"" variety) by linking masculinity to far worse and also far rarer behavior like rape (which OP correctly abstained from doing because, unlike a common behavior like binge drinking, I don't think they would be able to convincingly associate masculinity with a practice that an infinitesimal percentage of it's population engages and is universally seen as a heinous crime) it is almost certain that the only thing that SRSthrowaway learned from OP is that the term ""toxic masculinity"" is a term approved by academics and is therefore a-ok to use it as a stick to beat certain people with, which is a far cry from what is described by OP, according to whom the most prominent example of toxic masculinity in college campuses is excessive drinking.  Building on that, I think that if a term like ""toxic masculinity"" gets so often misused that, for all intents and purposes, is a stick to beat a certain demographic with, gets treated like one, as opposed to what it theoretically represents, I don't think it's fair to criticize the people who despise it for they empirically know it represents.  TLDR: If a term is often used in Motte and Bailey argument, it's ok to treat the motte like the bailley   PS: the ""out deadlift a true alpha"" comment is too good not to be satire"

BadSocialScience,35yc5l,isreactionary_bot,38,Thu May 14 16:37:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, identifying and unpacking problems surrounding concepts of normal and normative behaviors is so hard because we see it as the obvious. Sometimes when I teach I suggest they think about how hard it would be to step into another way of being and pass for a member. Just look at all the actors who spend hours and hours training with experts on speech patterns, gait, attitudes, facial expressions, etc. and who have people doing their clothing and hair. And yet still we often mock an actor's bad accent or awkwardness or poor costume. If someone who is an expert at putting on another way of being has difficulty why do we expect it to be easy for everyday people to do?   Once we establish that code switching convincingly is hard we can get into how the need to do so in order to succeed suggests someone's own cultural way of being is wrong and bad. While every culture has practices, beliefs, taboos, and restrictions that are problematic they also have ones that are beautiful, fascinating, and worth being proud about. Balancing the desire to retain your background and not feel ashamed about it with the need to hide your background to succeed is difficult psychologically and just practically. Couple that with the drawbacks that white masculinity has (just as any normative role has) and how you have to handle embodying something you might disagree with at times. No wonder it is a source of tension and debate. No wonder people test boundaries and try to contest or change the norm. No wonder people try to carve out spaces within system of power for themselves.   And then we can have a civil debate and discussion about how to resolve this tension. Not that an undergrad class is going to resolve the problems of multiculturalism, racism, and the boundaries of cultural relativity. But at least a conversation can happen.  But yeah I'm not really expecting that from trolls. I kind of just needed to get it out somewhere. So instead of ranting on a hundred threads I just put it here. Where no one who needs to read it probably will but oh well."
BadSocialScience,35yc5l,commanderspoonface,-43,Thu May 14 17:00:47 2015 UTC,"Good for you.   Similarly you'll not catch me victim-blaming women for feminine toxicity. It's not their fault that social norms have created the widely accepted and horrific levels of misandry: (the Guardian newspaper places it at 4 times the level of misogyny)[http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/sep/14/gender-studies-male-blaming-bias]. The mainstream discourse refuses any claims about interpersonal male/female issues unless made with the authoritative voice of a woman; the level of denial is extraordinary and so it shouldn't be surprising that many women find the topic tense and uncomfortable, and something they would be unwilling to debate.   This feminine norms of duplicity, hysteria and amoral efforts at resource extraction of males are, unlike masculine toxicity, a true taboo since it cannot be even considered. Firedrops' extensive references precisely disprove her claim of masculine toxicity discussion as a taboo.Feminine toxicity is understood as normal and unremarked upon, except in sudden narrative collapses when the hysteria or histrionics break out in false rape accusations and the like.  Of course, I'm sure firedrops will be keen to write about feminine toxicity--the last taboo-- and not try to derail onto the victim-blaming topic of masculine toxicity."

Do you people understand how citations work? The article you link, which is an op-ed rather than research, doesn't make this claim anywhere I can see. And to support the factual claims it does make, it links back, in turn, to another youtube op-ed video.   Nothing else you claim here is subtantiated by anything, and you're bizarrely misrepresenting the claims in the OP, which states among other things   Manhood is a seriously understudied but very important subject that is only recently getting a lot of attention.   These two ideas together create concepts of manhood that hurt the ability of male victims' attempts to seek justice when they are beaten by significant others or raped  This all together creates a toxic concept of manhood for both individual men and their communities.    What's being claimed here isn't all that different from what feminists in the 19th and 20th century claimed about women: that gender roles created harmful strictures that damaged people psychologically and materially. You seem to think that it's somehow advocating against men if it's not specifically fingering women as the culprit.   Do you know what the idea of  'projection' in psychology is? It's when attitudes, desires, and  inclinations that one holds but finds to be intellectually unacceptable are attributed to another person or group. So, for example, you seem to think that feminism is out to blame men but you simultaneously hold that any advocacy on behalf of men that doesn't blame women is insufficient. Or, for example, when you talk about women you frame things in terms of what 'women are really like' ('feminine norms of duplicity, hysteria, and amoral efforts at resource extraction') whereas when it comes to men you're elaborately evasive about what 'men are really like' (objecting to characterization of men's attitudes as 'being like x' as actually an attempt to deflect). It's actually like a gender-reversed caricature of the worst rhetorical excesses of 70's second-wave feminism.   In other words, yes, this is about you. I don't know you--there's internet anonimity to thank for that, but it might surprise you to learn that, yes, I've been punched in the face by a woman in a dysfunctional relationship. I didn't call the cops because I was certain it would backfire on me. I spent the next two weeks in aviators because I didn't feel like lying to people about how I got that black eye ('I fell down the staiirs?')  I actually do care about some MRA claims. But by soaking them in irrelevant screeds about the evils of feminism is doing nobody any favors. You're not just making yourself look foolish, you're making the issue look foolish.

First, scholars study taboo subjects all the time (though I didn't label it as such) - part of being in academia is being able to take a hard look at difficult subjects most people glance over. Its existence in the literature doesn't make it not taboo. Second, lots of people have written about various problematic aspects of the construction of womanhood in America and elsewhere. But more to the point, toxic masculinity isn't just a male thing. Women internalize it too and then it shapes perceptions of and expectations of men's behaviors, attitudes, and appearance. If you want to understand gender relations you have to understand cultural constructions of idealized manhood and womanhood and the tensions, debates, and boundaries constructed around them.   There are TONS of academic critiques about topics such as TERFS (trans exclusionary radical feminists) who tend to be quite misandric in addition to being transphobic. Somewhat related is an even larger body of work about benevolent sexism. Just because the term ""feminine toxicity"" isn't used academically it isn't as if people are failing to write about issues of exclusion and problematic femininities.   Your link is pretty awful with no citation for the misandry being four times more prevalent than misogyny, though. Literally many of the ""citations"" are just youtube videos. Can you provide some actual reputable academic work on the subjects? Something that evaluates women's attitudes towards men's status, abilities, value, worth, and intelligence?   Also, I've been a teaching assistant for college level sex & gender courses. We split time about equally on men and women's issues.

BadSocialScience,35yc5l,LemonLenin,37,Fri May 15 03:32:52 2015 UTC,"Great post! Sort of tangential, but you made a really good point with   When black men wearing baggy pants and a gold necklace are told to dress and speak ""normal"" they are actually being told to dress and speak like a middle class white American man.   I'm in one of the whitest fields there is (ecology/zoology/evolution) so I'm less familiar with the race aspect, but my field is also at or near gender parity and the proportion of women is constantly increasing. A conversation that comes up time to time is professionalism.  Everyone, at least at the level of graduate student, is completely aware that women are held to much narrower standards- for example, I can inject a lot more humor, fun, and silliness into a talk than a woman can before being labelled unserious and unprofessional. I talked to a public radio reporter too and she said that the station constantly gets letters saying that the women reporters don't sound professional- they actually keep a stack of such letters.  The basic thing is that professionalism is defined by masculinity so women are, to many people, unprofessional by definition. Most people who are ""concerned"" about women's unprofessionalism aren't really aware of that, and they don't really think of what a ""professional"" woman would be like or how their ideas of a ""professional"" man or ""professional"" woman differ. I think they actually can be receptive to changing their ways; I gave a talk to a small group of mostly older conservative-leaning people once about linguistic discrimination and they were surprisingly receptive."
BadSocialScience,35yc5l,LemonLenin,25,Thu May 14 18:15:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks! The normative expectations for professionalism are really interesting especially in academia. There is a very delicate and contested balance between an almost hyper-masculinity vs trying to avoid being labeled a bitch or bossy. On the one hand, women report that they tried to downplay femininity through avoiding pink, being very modest with makeup, avoiding too many family photos or mentions of children, etc. Another study found   Our empirical findings show that the paradox of visibility enables us to explain why female students tend to make themselves invisible by acting and dressing like boys and, at the same time, they need to make themselves visible if they want to pursue a career in the highly competitive field of earth sciences.    On the other hand, denying femininity too much and putting on manhood can result in snarky comments and accusations that she is a bitch or aloof. And, as the second article suggests, it can make women too invisible thereby reducing odds they will get academic positions. When it comes to the label of professionalism it seems women have more to prove and lose it easier in many ways."
BadSocialScience,35yc5l,bunker_man,11,Thu May 14 19:45:24 2015 UTC,"I'm finding the normative academic expectations really frustrating. I'm only masters level, so take it with a grain of salt, but I'm doing gender studies. We spent several weeks discussing queer theory. But it's still so obvious how strong the pressure is to fit 'the good academic' subjectivity.   We got so many panicky emails from our course convener about getting the punctuation 100% perfect in our bibliographies, for fuck's sake. Don't get me wrong, I'm 100% for not stealing people's shit, but it's ""here's weeks' worth of lectures questioning stable identities, established power structures, and processes of subjectivisation. Now here is exactly how all of your assignments should look and how we interact in class and about a thousand websites' worth of admin. Please do not include the word 'irony' in any responses you may have to this statement.""  Now I've gone on a tangent to a tangent, but graarrr it really annoys me how fussy academia is about its subject positions."

BadSocialScience,35yc5l,Leinadro,6,Thu May 14 15:20:32 2015 UTC,"This is a little bit OT and not a critique, but I'm genuinely curious about the Connell citations, as Connell is a transwoman now writing as R. W. or Raewyn. Of course citing her pre-transition work means she still would've been publishing as Robert, which I understand, but I'm curious about the, idk, etiquette of referring to her as ""him"" in this case. Does anyone have thoughts on this or know Connell's own preferences on the matter?"
BadSocialScience,35yc5l,vamoose1,7,Fri May 15 03:13:04 2015 UTC,"Most of Connell's stuff, even before her transition, was printed under the gender neutral ""R W Connell."" My 1987 print of Gender & Power was authored by ""R. W. Connell."" So that would be the preferred way to write it."
BadSocialScience,35yc5l,thatoneguy54,3,Fri May 15 12:28:08 2015 UTC,"In-text it makes sense to just call her ""Connell"" anyway. I guess my approach, if I'd ever had to cite her, would be to refer to her as ""Connell"" and let the bibliography sort itself out based on how it was listed by the publisher. If I absolutely have to use a pronoun, I'd use ""she"" even for the ""Robert"" instances, but I wasn't sure if this instinct was the same as what standard practice is/ought to be.  Thanks for the reply."
BadSocialScience,35yc5l,Leinadro,7,Fri May 15 16:24:49 2015 UTC,"You know I totally forgot about her transition. I don't know her preferences to how she should be referred to in her earlier work. An admittedly quick search didn't turn up any preference discussions. I am on my mobile now but I'll change identifiers to a neutral ""they"" later today.   Edit: just fixed it. I also updated zotero which i was too lazy to use originally (citations are how Google has them and I didn't look closely which is my fault). But my zotero entries were outdated too because I'm old and my entries from her older publications."
BadSocialScience,35yc5l,thatoneguy54,4,Fri May 15 12:26:53 2015 UTC,"The work has been reprinted under her new name, so I don't think there's any reason to use her old pronouns."

BadSocialScience,35yc5l,Gruzman,2,Fri Jun 12 10:35:29 2015 UTC,"Hi there- I hope you don't mind me popping in to ask this, but you seem like someone who might know.  You mention   Manhood is a seriously understudied but very important subject that is only recently getting a lot of attention.   I've read Connell and been wondering if anything like Masculinities has ever been written examining different femininities and studying intra-gender relations between women?  Is there anything similar to the journal for men's studies that examines womanhood in a similar manner?"
BadSocialScience,35yc5l,Gruzman,1 point,Sat May 16 04:05:58 2015 UTC,"There are lots of journals that focus on women! Anything specific you are interested in? I can just give a couple of interesting reading suggestions if you want. It will also give you some journals that focus on these things. In general, the term you often see coming up is Barbara Welter's ""the cult of true womanhood"" as opposed to ""toxic masculinity"" but there are other tropes that are discussed too like jezebel. They aren't all journals specifically looking at womanhood but you'll find lots of articles within that are relevant for gender studies of both men and women.   Welter, Barbara. ""The cult of true womanhood: 1820-1860."" American Quarterly (1966): 151-174. <--- origins of the term  Roberts, Mary Louise. ""True womanhood revisited."" Journal of Women's History 14.1 (2002): 150-155. <--- Good discussion of the term  Buchanan, NiCole T., Isis H. Settles, and Krystle C. Woods. ""Comparing sexual harassment subtypes among Black and White women by military rank: Double jeopardy, the jezebel, and the cult of true womanhood."" Psychology of Women Quarterly 32.4 (2008): 347-361.  Emerson, Rana A. ""“Where my girls at?” Negotiating black womanhood in music videos."" Gender & Society 16.1 (2002): 115-135. DuCille, Ann. ""The occult of true black womanhood: Critical demeanor and black feminist studies."" Signs (1994): 591-629. Scheper‐Hughes, Nancy. ""Culture, scarcity, and maternal thinking: Maternal detachment and infant survival in a Brazilian shantytown."" Ethos 13.4 (1985): 291-317.   So those are just some random articles I liked. If there is a specific topic you want reading suggestions for just ask. And /u/queerbees or /u/Fishing-Bear could probably give you many more suggestions than I. But here are a few journals to check out. Note that in the states anything to do with women, womanhood, femininity, etc. gets lumped into ""feminist"" regardless of whether there is any political or social policy aspect to it. That can be confusing for the journal titles because some are more political leaning and some aren't at all.

BadSocialScience,35yc5l,Gruzman,1 point,Wed May 20 19:20:15 2015 UTC,"That's a lot to start with, thank you.   Anything specific you are interested in?   You may have already provided it- basically examinations of norms around which femininity is constituted, the intra-gender power relations that those reinforce, and I'd also be interested in extra-gender power relations that weren't limited to economic or political power (I suspect postmodernists will have done a lot of that).  Basically, I don't agree with everything connell and messerschmidt say about masculinities as they relate to femininities- but I think that there is a lot which is compelling in their examination of masculinities as they relate to other masculinities.  I hadn't found anything which tried to construct an ontology of femininities and discuss the mechanisms through which their hierarchies were reinforced, and I found that strange."

Messerschmidt. ""Hegemonic masculinity rethinking the concept."" Gender & society 19.6 (2005): 829-859.   There is only one Connell who's authored these pieces. It's just Raewyn Connell, or more often R W Connell. I tend to favor the latter."
