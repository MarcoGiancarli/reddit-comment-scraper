h1z1,3e34b3,calvv,8,Tue Jul 21 16:20:43 2015 UTC,Yeah would be nice because the only way to get rid of it is by igniting them and that gives our position at night or if near container cars ect to put it inside them. So stupid that there is no drop option
h1z1,3e34b3,XxFri3ndlyxX,4,Tue Jul 21 16:33:57 2015 UTC,Add a little cloth and shoot that shit into the air lol.
h1z1,3e34b3,kittykittyhatesme,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:34:59 2015 UTC,No we want a stealth option so we want a drop option. We can drop eveything exept that. So stupid

When I die in my base with multiple doors closed behind me, it was a hacker. Face it H1Z1 has a hacker problem STILL (granted it's not as bad it was a few months ago). Sure not every death is from hackers, but the ones that are become SUPER obvious"
h1z1,3e2rqm,JustiniZHere,3,Tue Jul 21 15:13:23 2015 UTC,ESP is definitely the biggest issue right now.
h1z1,3e2rqm,SealTeamSixx,3,Tue Jul 21 16:21:55 2015 UTC,Yes there's a lot of hackers around these days (mostly no-clip + aim bot). But there's a difference between hacks and exploits.... A lot is still not working properly.... (shooting through walls for example) You can die in your own base if someone is shooting you from far away so that your walls and shelters aren't rendering.... (happened to a teammate yesterday)  About ESP.... Let's not forget the zombie virus which gives you literally ESP powers...

But if you keep putting yourself in that position day after day, when there is clearly a viable alternative, I feel no sympathy for you"

h1z1,3e2rqm,BradlyKG,3,Tue Jul 21 15:23:51 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty accurate post, though it won't get anyone anywhere being posted here because you will get all of those people posting here claiming they've seen 50 hackers in the past 5 minutes and you are wrong lol. They don't understand this is meant to be a rhetorical thread, not a thread where you argue the truth and exaggerate to tip the tables in your direction.   I see exactly what you're saying Ninja and I know exactly what you mean. I play both PvP and PvE and guess how many hackers I've seen in the 350-400 hours (sorry, not as hardcore as some) I've played...  ZERO. I repeat, ZERO.   Sure, plenty of people killing me with good aim and a bit of luck, but not one of them were hackers. Now I'm not saying they don't exist, because obviously they do. I've had to log out to protect the clan's base (by not being in game and showing up on ESP or something, not even sure how that shit works, I just do what I'm told in that situation lol) when my clan is shouting on Teamspeak that a guy is teleporting around picking off members lol.   People just blow shit way out of proportion when things don't go their way. When I die by a player, my go to response is ""good shot haha"" because I'm fully expecting to die at any minute. When I kill someone (which is rare by the way, I suck ass at shooting moving targets lmfao), it's usually a lucky spray and pray shot that catches them in the face or something. And almost every damn time, I hear those stupid, bitter words of ""reported you fucking hacker.""  Get over yourselves."

h1z1,3e2rqm,MormonDew,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:02:29 2015 UTC,"I think the most frustrating thing to both camps (those that think this game is mostly cheaters and those that think there are virtually no cheaters) is that except for a few obvious ones, most cases could easily be explained as cheating or just a good player. A lot of bases can be raided by hoping over a gate so maybe it was a no clipper cheater or maybe it wasn't. People can stumble upon even the best hidden player or base so maybe it was esp, maybe it wasn't. And sometimes people get lucky (or skilled) long distance headshots with any type of weapon, so maybe it's aimbot and maybe it's not. Tough to tell who is right, but my guess is it's somewhere in the middle."

h1z1,3e2rqm,GordonNewman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:10:37 2015 UTC,I think game bugs cause alot of these false accusations. The ghost ammo bug I am sure has caused dozens of reports. I would report too If I unloaded a shotgun on somebody and they didn't even bleed. Yesterday this guy were were trying to shoot in PV was desyncing pretty bad and I saw half his body sticking through this  wall he was hiding behind.

He specifically admitted to cheating, and said he bought a ton of accounts during the Steam Sale so it doesn't matter if he gets banned half a dozen times. A few nights ago, 50%+ of the ALL bases on our server were raided.  We know several of the clans and they all got hit and wiped out.  Bases all over the map, different designs, different locations.  All exterior gates intact, just interior doors blown off.  If that doesn't smell like no clip cheaters, please tell me what you're smoking. Just the other day I watched ONE guy kill the last 20 people in a BR match.  He wasn't even trying to hide the cheating.  Once it got down to 20 players, he killed 1 player every 30 seconds until he won.  Oh, and he's from the region we're not allowed to talk about.   So you can take your ""I so gud, you so bad"" post somewhere else.  H1Z1 does have a severe cheating problem."
h1z1,3e2rqm,ChinaIsFree,2,Tue Jul 21 15:55:18 2015 UTC,"so it's server related then. I play on another high pop eu server. We have 2 bases with some ammo inside, got raided by noclippers only once. MAYBE.  The way this sub makes it look is like every server is flooded. It's just not true."

Between Battleye and Server Admins they kept 95%+ of the cheaters out.  There were very few if any hackusations there, because there were very very few cheaters.  If the anti-cheat actually works, hackusations decrease, because people run into less cheaters.  If the anti-cheat doesn't work, hackusations increase, because people run into more cheaters."
h1z1,3e2rqm,keichler,0,Tue Jul 21 17:21:37 2015 UTC,go 1st person servers.. much fewer cheaters
h1z1,3e2rqm,FreaKtmnz,3,Tue Jul 21 21:06:21 2015 UTC,"Right when you said you play on EU, now I know why you're in a different  situation. You have barely ANY South American/Asian players (which make up MOST of the cheaters in this game. And if you deny this, you're just being delusional) on your servers.   For this reason, and this reason alone, is why you've not yet encountered cheaters like some others have. I play everyday (probably around 700 hours now) and EVERYDAY, I encounter someone using cheats. Whether it's blatantly, a guy speeding around, or a situation where I KNOW the person/s are using ESP to find me in a random, remote area/s, or the good ol, get shot by a bow from miles away.  This stuff happens on my server (US Antidote), DAILY!  I've reported people who I KNOW are cheats, and still see them playing, lol. Hitting the in game ""report last death"", does practically nothing, and reporting to email is a joke as well.  I was told by someone in an email response, that the person I reported had killed 108 people in ONE DAY!   ""How is he cheating?   I took a look at his information for the past couple of days, and he doesnâ€™t set off any huge triggers.   He also seems to get a large amount of kills 108 yesterday with only 3 people reporting him.""  LOL, now honestly. Who the hell kills 108 people in ONE day? You'd not only have to be on all day, but you'd have to have the best shot/luck to never be killed and have to restart/regear, even if you had a base. I don't believe for a second that the person I reported isn't a cheater, but apparently 108 kills and ""only 3 reports"", isn't enough, lol.  A lot of people that play this game, aren't even aware of hackers/cheaters. So why would they even hit the, ""report last death""?!  Cheaters are thriving because a lot of them are smart, and will not use the cheats that will get them detected. How do you exactly detect, ""aimbot""? Well, you can't unless there is something I'm missing. How do you detect, ""ESP""? Oh right, you can't...  So two of the more deadly cheats, and the ones that annoy most players, are undetectable?   Great!"
h1z1,3e2rqm,insanemoose33,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:21:19 2015 UTC,"I was killed in my base at least 7 times in the last few days, by clippers. All different no clippers, they simply phase through one shot me and leave. So it's fun to laugh at posts like this, thanks."
h1z1,3e2rqm,insanemoose33,-2,Tue Jul 21 16:59:04 2015 UTC,Funny you say you've died to cheaters 3-5 times. Using your medicine just because you died doesn't mean they were cheating. Provocative.
h1z1,3e2rqm,Brainbloggerr,0,Tue Jul 21 15:00:00 2015 UTC,"Dude warping around like Quicksilver around Bubba's? Yeah, that's legit.  3 headshots in less than a second, killing all 3 of us with a pistol from 100+ meters? Yeah, that's legit.  Dude casually walks through the wall in front me, kills my friend and then kills me? Yeah, that's legit.  EDIT: I probably died dozens of times, heck maybe even 100+, so 3-5 deaths to cheaters is not a situation you can  call ""littered"" with hackers. Some of those other deaths might have been from cheaters as well, it's hard to know if some1's ESPing, but in my book there was nothing suspicious there."

h1z1,3e1ute,Couchy007,2,Tue Jul 21 16:04:47 2015 UTC,"Rubber Banding? Is this the reminiscence of a new form of Anti-Cheat being implemented into the game?   Rubber Banding is an issue in DayZ because the server keeps track of everyone's location simultaneously. It takes a LOT of the server's resources to keep track of everyone position, compared to not at all. If the server thinks you're somewhere shouldn't be (AKA it thinks you tried to no-clip though a wall, or fly though the air), then it will rubber-band you back to your original position. When that was implemented into DayZ, it introduced SOO many bugs. The biggest bug being, you can be running up stairs in a 5 story building, and instantly be teleported outside the building, on the other side of the wall, and fall 5 stories to your death. I lost characters I spend days gearing up because of desync issues, but you know what? I never saw a teleporting/no-clipping hacker since they did it.  I could be speculating out my ass here, but more anti-cheat stuff could be on the way!"
h1z1,3e1ute,Tenetri,0,Tue Jul 21 16:14:13 2015 UTC,"Rubber banding is basically client - server desync.  The server thinks you are in a different place that the client is showing, so it tells the client to throw you back.   Normally its poor server performance that causes it."

Since this post will probably get a decent amount of views, hopefully it will get attention to be fixed at the risk of it being more abused.

h1z1,3e0dw9,itsJVbaby,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:02:39 2015 UTC,This is very good feedback and stuff I have experienced myself regularly. The point at which your bullets originate when fired is a particular concern to me as it makes crouching a huge liability. I've more or less abandoned crouching completely due to the number of times my bullets hit the object i was crouching behind despite my gun model being well clear (above) of said object.  I fully support AK nerfs as that gun has rendered the AR15 completely obsolete and I'm sick of getting into medium range firefights where we both kill eachother. This is further compounded by the amount of teaming that happens in solo BR. Killing a group of 2+ in solo BR is much harder with the addition of the AK since between the 2 of them they only need to hit you 3 times.  The only other thing I would add to the list is that the range I can throw a frag grenade is pathetically low and makes the item inferior to molotovs in just about every way.
h1z1,3e0dw9,EpicHuggles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:05:17 2015 UTC,Couldnt agree more on the AK. The amount of what I like to call double KO's is far to great. Take the damage down a little bit. Great read Grimmybear.
h1z1,3e0dw9,ANGRYPUG_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:13:59 2015 UTC,"agree with everything except your AK nerf ideas, I believe AK is horribly underpowered for the round it fires, AK should be 2 shot to body, ! to head no matter what helmet your wearing, if you do this then also buff AR-15 cause it lags behind some weapons namely .45 pistol and shotgun, AR-15 should kill your with three body shots, probly should also kill you in the head no matter what helmet as assault rifles are designed to penetrate armour. SHow me somebody taking 4 .223's rounds to the chest before they drop"
h1z1,3e0dw9,Sgonzo6Ds,0,Tue Jul 21 18:31:48 2015 UTC,"One bug I noticed, AK47 accuracy on the first shot is literally a laser beam. I've had encounters trying to 1-shot snipe complacent targets with the AR15, only to have to switch to AK47 to make the shot. The inaccuracy of the AR15 compared to AK47 on the first shot is obscene. Either the AR is shooting rubber bullets, or the barrel is a pretzel.  Either way accuracy, damage, and fire rate is tremendously better on the AK47 compared to the AR15. Real balance would involve trade offs when choosing between the rifles."
h1z1,3e0dw9,crabmandu,4,Tue Jul 21 21:28:28 2015 UTC,"Good post, but i disagree with nerfing the AK . we should increase recoil or something instead. The problem in the game is that the weapons are all nerfed out, thats why when players get shot at, they all jump on you like savages that are not afraid to die. The guns should be very hard to shoot but super deadly, so players would take cover when bullets are flying by, knowing that one bullet could cause severe damage."

h1z1,3e1upf,Conzilium,2,Tue Jul 21 09:55:32 2015 UTC,"Take it a step further and look at Ark:Survival Evolved. The devs behind this game are making a new name for early access. Constant community involvement and steady regular updates that not only include fixes but add plenty of new content.  Often, while a patch is in pre-release testing and a good suggestion is made on the forums/reddit, it will actually make it into the patch when it goes live. The game was released as early access on Jun 2nd and it's had probably double the amount of content and fixes that H1Z1 has had since it hit EA on Jan 15th."
h1z1,3e1upf,xEverdred,2,Tue Jul 21 11:28:19 2015 UTC,but I don't like ark at all. it has a steep buy-in in terms of experience. a new player comes in and gets destroyed by people who have been playing forever. You can't compete unless you level grind. Ark and H1Z1 are very different games and shouldn't even be compared. Unless you are just talking about how the devs work. That is a valid comparison.
h1z1,3e1upf,MormonDew,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:31:44 2015 UTC,I'm just talking about how great the devs are as far as speed/quality of updates and community presence.  I do have plenty of hours in both Ark and H1Z1 and I don't feel that way about Ark at all. The levels in that game do not mean anything whatsoever. The real difference in terms of power in that game comes from the amount of time you can spend grinding for mats and taming more/better dinos.
h1z1,3e1upf,xEverdred,2,Tue Jul 21 16:19:24 2015 UTC,I'm not sure how that's any different than H1.  I've played both extensively.  Whenever you join a new server on H1 you're at a severe disadvantage to other people that already have built up a solid base and stocked up on IEDs/bio/eth who can just blow up any new base they see pop up.  I know because I used to do that when I was playing H1 very actively.
h1z1,3e1upf,sweetdigs,2,Tue Jul 21 17:38:14 2015 UTC,"It's not the game play, xEverdred, is stating the development is much better, they can even add in player suggested items on patch day, what that states is their not doing much work over at Ark compared to H1Z1 which makes H1Z1 have a slower development because they are doing it right not quick and easy, the game play comparison has to wait until both games are complete it's unfair to judge either game in alpha since they have not yet got that far for this, once their released it should be working how they want for both games and then we can compare that, once the ideas stop on Ark you will see it slow down extremely bad"
h1z1,3e1upf,WhitenineOne,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:52:54 2015 UTC,"What's your basis for saying that DBG is doing it ""right"" as opposed to ""quick and easy?""  It's pretty clear you're bringing a lot of buyer bias into this argument, but I'm curious as to what other basis you have for this statement?  The Ark devs break very little or nothing in each of their new content patches, which are issued every other day.  DBG, on the other hand, has some of the worst code control I've ever seen and introduces tons of new bugs in every new release, often bugs that are completely unrelated to the ""fixes"" or ""new content"" they added in that patch.  Their QA is just as atrocious as their code control."
h1z1,3e1upf,sweetdigs,3,Tue Jul 21 21:20:29 2015 UTC,But on H1 you don't have to literally level for days to just get access to the same recipies other people have. It may take you a half hour to get guns and ammo but not days of grinding.
h1z1,3e1upf,MormonDew,2,Tue Jul 21 18:15:50 2015 UTC,"Ever wonder why?  Any third-party software or service intended to make development easier by abstracting from lower-level APIs and tools, to offer a more user-friendly experience with mouse-driven GUI interfaces, visual-scripting editors, animation editors, drag-and-drop functionality, and other level-editing features. In addition, such engines often include pre-coded script files from which users derive and build new features without even needing to fully understand what the original code base does. Making your own engine is much harder than what Ark does so yes they can push anything that they want in any given time because it's that easy for them, however they will lose quality.  http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/AlanThorn/20140328/214178/Is_it_cheating_to_use_a_game_engine.php  http://www.quora.com/When-is-it-a-good-idea-to-build-your-own-game-engine"
h1z1,3e1upf,WhitenineOne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:41:53 2015 UTC,"Are you suggesting that the forgelight engine was made for H1Z1? They have plenty of tools that allow them to streamline many of their processes as seen in the numerous behind the scenes videos done for OMFG (operation make faster game) in Planetside 2. When H1Z1 first hit EA and people were snooping through the files many things were found that were directly copied from Planetside 2. It's not like H1Z1 was a fresh slate, it has a foundation that has been worked on for a while now."
h1z1,3e1upf,xEverdred,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:27:22 2015 UTC,"What he's trying to say is that H1Z1 didn't use a very well established game engine, and instead used one that was absolutely not ready for prime time, as evidenced by playing Planetside or H1Z1."
h1z1,3e1upf,Deranged40,3,Tue Jul 21 18:09:12 2015 UTC,"However this is a engine made by daybreak now from a third party company, they have different programmers than planetside 2 and the coding HAS to be different you can't copy and paste it all and expect it to work it's not like that, plus they are making forelight engine 2 at this time, they need this to make H1Z1 how they want it, if they used something like unreal engine such as Ark does we would never see a 16,000 KM map with tons of players on it only the same map as we have now"
h1z1,3e1upf,WhitenineOne,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:35:21 2015 UTC,H1z1 uses the exact same game engine as planetside 2. Forgelight. Please know what you are talking about.
h1z1,3e1upf,shuwstah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:38:48 2015 UTC,"It does CURRENTLY use the Forgelight engine, but as he correctly stated they are working on the Forgelight 2 that this game will eventually run on. Please know what you are talking about"
h1z1,3e1upf,MajorTokes,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:29:14 2015 UTC,"All i said was they use Forgelight game engine...so given the fact that you say ""It does currently use the Forgelight engine""...seems like i know what im talking about. Fucking idiot... Have fun waiting on Forgelight 2. Takes DB over a month to add first aid kits and you think they will have their new engine out within the next 3 years? lol..delusional..."
h1z1,3e1upf,shuwstah,3,Tue Jul 21 17:40:45 2015 UTC,"Still this is a engine made by daybreak not a THIRD PARTY ENGINE, Ark uses unreal engine it's third party very simple. Even though forelight engine was first designed for PS2, but they still have to write EVERY SINGLE code for H1Z1 they can't copy and paste and slap this game together from PS2, doesn't work like that. Plus they are making forelight engine 2, doing this will allow us to have what they dream of a 16,000 KM map with tons of players on it. Ark doesn't even really have to program anything into their game lol I do know what I am talking about, just because it was used in a previous game doesn't mean they didn't make this, the difference I am referring to here is using your OWN engine vs a THIRD PARTY engine there is a big difference in using the two, one is hard the other is super easy."
h1z1,3e1upf,WhitenineOne,2,Tue Jul 21 16:43:28 2015 UTC,"so... you cant copy and paste from PS2 yet apparently you can copy and paste in UE... only becasue its ""third party""?  if anything your own engine IS the easier way since you actually have people who know it in and out instead of having to learn from scratch"
h1z1,3e1upf,xSergis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:06:33 2015 UTC,Unreal Engine is designed using blueprints(google it) to adapt and add content. Unreal is a GUI driven interface that allows developers to make games in a simple and rapid way. Quality suffers because of this but it allows for rapid addition of features and content due to the use of blueprints. Unreal engine is the game design equivalent of building a house out of Legos as opposed to the real thing.
h1z1,3e1upf,MajorTokes,2,Tue Jul 21 17:33:00 2015 UTC,"It's hard to prove this point, they will never understand until H1Z1 has forelight engine 2 and blows Ark out of the water with how capable it is to run what they want, as I will always state Ark is forever limited to unreal engine and will be their bitch until the end"
h1z1,3e1upf,WhitenineOne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:35:31 2015 UTC,blueprints shmoeprints  nothing but a gui way of putting code together  if anything for an experienced programmer straight up coding will still be simpler
h1z1,3e1upf,xSergis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:10:33 2015 UTC,"Never stated Ark copies and paste, what they do is add in a object, UE has prewritten codes they can use, all they need to do is edit the object to how they want it to be used, UE does the rest for them. Besides using the same engine that PS2 has used, even if they do PS2 is owned by Daybreak which is opened source code for any of their games meaning they have full rights, if they did this game would be progressed much further than now, however their not going to make as shitty copy and paste survival PS2. Would you care to explain to me how it's easier to program a game vs adding in objects and just editing them. Ark doesn't sit there all day programming in everything, as previously stated if a player suggest an item on PATCH DAY, they can add that in right before the patch, that proves they are not doing much programming at all, if they did program they would have to add that object in, how it works in the world, how it effects other things, how it would be interacted with, where it would be placed, and how it would look and all of that would take hours to days to have finished, not on patch day before you release it. Go download unreal engine you can start making your own game RIGHT NOW and you don't have to program in anything make your own Ark."
h1z1,3e1upf,WhitenineOne,2,Tue Jul 21 17:25:51 2015 UTC,"we've had this fancy thing called inheritance for a couple decades now so dont try to tell me that dbg has to code up every single object from scratch  now i dont know, they might have, but i sure hope that a gamedev company has some experience beyond the level of cs majors"
h1z1,3e1upf,xSergis,0,Tue Jul 21 18:17:47 2015 UTC,"Some of the H1Z1 devs are literally people pulled from Planetside 2 to work on H1Z1 so I'm not sure where you're getting the idea that they are different devs. And yes you can copy paste certain aspects of 2 different games using the same engine and have them work, it's exactly like that. It has already been stated many times that the development of H1Z1 would bring with it some additions to planetside, one of which being the new weather system."
h1z1,3e1upf,xEverdred,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:49:49 2015 UTC,"I don't look into the devs to know their work history, I have heard about new additions for planetside from what H1Z1 can bring, however it still has to be programmed to work proper in the game. The difference I am wanting to show is using your own engine vs the third party engines, this doesn't matter if the engine was made for planetside to, this was made by DAYBREAK so it's their engine for ALL their games period, look at ubisoft every game uses their engine it's common for all game companies that use their own engine to use it in all their games. I assume you never even opened the links I posted the first one is really great, allow me to provide you with a paragraph from it, maybe long but it's the truth! http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/AlanThorn/20140328/214178/Is_it_cheating_to_use_a_game_engine.php  The engine itself is not the main issue, however. It's how the engine makes you feel and the regard that using it has among peers. The point is: there are some tools available for game development whose use many regard as just cheating, plain and simple. The idea, I believe, is that when using those tools, you're not doing proper development; you're simply engaging in unprofessional pretence. True, you may make a professional looking game with the tools, and you may even fool gamers into thinking you're a bonafide developer. But, in the last analysis, you won't fool other developers, because they'll somehow know you really cheated by using an engine for your game, avoiding the real and hard work.  They bring up many great points about this subject please read it for the sake of Ark. BTW not saying it's ""cheating"" as they state, I am saying they have it easy, very easy."
h1z1,3e1upf,WhitenineOne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:06:12 2015 UTC,the group feature for example was an accidental leftover from PS2  but h1z1 engine isnt a third party engine and therefore you cant copy and paste lol
h1z1,3e1upf,xSergis,0,Tue Jul 21 17:08:00 2015 UTC,"Sure they can copy and paste something like that over, it doesn't work as good as PS2, however the proof of them not simply copy and pasting is how the game works, if they did copy and paste everything this game would already be near complete since they just need to add in survival aspects all the guns, damage, shooting, physics should be complete, but that's not the case, H1Z1 has to be done different on those aspects, not every single piece of code is capable of being copy and pasted over to a game, however using good ideas like that is better than making something shit. Now to get the point across anyone can make Ark, if you download UE right now, you could have a game up in a few months, it's simple, you edit how your map is to look, edit objects around the map and how they can be interacted with UE prewritten codes, then you release the game $$$$$$."
h1z1,3e1upf,WhitenineOne,2,Tue Jul 21 17:32:46 2015 UTC,thats why we see millions of people making their own arks getting dat $$$$$$...o wait.
h1z1,3e1upf,xSergis,2,Tue Jul 21 18:18:55 2015 UTC,"So much this, anyone comparing the progress of the two games really don't understand this whatsoever."
h1z1,3e1upf,chips709,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:03:56 2015 UTC,"Yep, they will not understand it's so easy for Ark to put anything into their game, even though forelight was made for PS2 originally they still have to write every little code for H1Z1"
h1z1,3e1upf,WhitenineOne,3,Tue Jul 21 16:39:13 2015 UTC,"It's very easy to understand, actually.  H1Z1 did not pick a very well established game engine (nobody wonders why they picked their own game engine, though). ARK did choose a very strong game engine. ARK devs don't have to spend very much time at all getting the game engine into a workable state. H1Z1 devs have had very little opportunity to do anything else."
h1z1,3e1upf,Deranged40,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:10:11 2015 UTC,"There we go, finally another person understands, Ihe reason H1Z1 chose theirs is because they want it compatible for forelight engine 2, if they have a good and proper engine team at daybreak it should turn out to be a engine capable of what they need, they want a 16,000 km map, with way more players and AI on the map, they did make EQ1 when pre made engines wasn't available so making their own may work better for them, but I'm unsure on how Unreal Engine would be to their goals no one has really tested it, Arks map is the same size as H1Z1, if they expand with keeping it opened world we will know. But this is just my opion, only daybreak knows for now, I'm glad you shared!"

h1z1,3e1upf,ZiXXiV,2,Tue Jul 21 10:21:02 2015 UTC,they are looking for developers again.   More like finding better dev replacements that can communicate and be upfront.
h1z1,3e1upf,JudgeDredd81,2,Tue Jul 21 10:51:20 2015 UTC,DBG needs to fix things at the top before you'll see this get fixed.  The problem isn't the devs.

h1z1,3e1upf,Pointless_arguments,3,Tue Jul 21 12:28:30 2015 UTC,"Ah, I thought it was in already. I played a good amount of Legacy, haven't really returned to it since the switch over (nothing against the game, I'm just really busy at the moment) but I still follow the dev blogs and visit /r/playrust occasionally.  At least Gary seems to be pretty in touch with the community and if people really don't like it, there's a chance he will act accordingly."

h1z1,3e1upf,Ravenloff,0,Tue Jul 21 12:57:55 2015 UTC,"You realize Rust was released in 2013.  The game has been out for 2 yrs and its still in alpha.  I played A LOT of rust when the legacy version was out and it was a great game.  IMO they ruined Rust when they decided to start over and make it into a whole new game.  H1Z1 has done way more in terms of updating and taking in the players opinions.  The Devs are also way more interactive than Garry and his team.  At the peak of Rust, cheaters were running rampant and to this day, Garry does not implement any kind of anti-cheat and it is up to the community to seek out and ban them.  For these admins, this was a full time job and they were unable to enjoy the game.  If you were there from the start of Rust, you would have a very different opinion.  It went from the most popular game on steam to almost non-existent now and there is a reason for that.  The amount of work they did since the time of release is abysmal.  You should do your research before you criticize H1Z1 on ""theyr progression"" and ""how they patch"""
h1z1,3e1upf,Jbrahmz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:30:43 2015 UTC,"^ this. Alltough, if H1Z1 doesn't do something about cheaters (an anti-cheat instead of manually), they will end up the same way having a fulltime job banning and finding cheaters. If they don't already have their fulltime co-workers on them. But guess not, as banning messages are usually have the same busy moments on each day.  The rest +many! Agreed!"
h1z1,3e1upf,ZiXXiV,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:49:18 2015 UTC,Well said Jbrahmz. The grass is not greener on the other side. H1Z1 is a very unique and fun game. It is progressing quite remarkably.

h1z1,3e1upf,Nosko81,2,Tue Jul 21 13:30:23 2015 UTC,If anything you should compare this game to the ark devs. Those guys have more substantial and meaningful updates in one month compared to h1z1 devs or the rust dev.

h1z1,3e1upf,Faust8D,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:44:25 2015 UTC,You obviously havent payed any attention to Arks development. That dev team is far from incompetent where as this h1z1 dev team is barely even trying.
h1z1,3e1upf,drkknight74,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:18:51 2015 UTC,"ARK is a lego style built and developed game, hence their high rate of content additions. They are good at modeling and art design. That's it. They have no real development ability as they're using Unreal's super user friendly but highly limited engine. This is why they're outsourcing, they have no actual knowledge of game development but lofty aspirations, which may be admirable. BTW I am a Day 1 ARK player with 250 hours in it and 1000 in H1Z1. H1Z1 is the far better game in all aspects."
h1z1,3e1upf,MajorTokes,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:42:09 2015 UTC,Outsourcing development to a 3rd party to fix optimization issues. Placing online bounties to try curbing the insane amount of cheating.   Sure sounds like a competent team of developers. ;)  Got to love idiots that think tossing in minor patches on an engine that even the novice of programmers can utilize is such a major break through.
h1z1,3e1upf,Faust8D,3,Tue Jul 21 14:21:34 2015 UTC,"But they are, when it comes to technical aspects. Networking. Optimizations. AI. They can't do it.   Design, visuals, they can. Too much of one type of dev with them."
h1z1,3e1upf,crazy_muffins,0,Tue Jul 21 14:22:53 2015 UTC,I agree I want deeper dev blogs but Rust has been in dev for over a year. Don't forget Rust was like H1Z1 when they first started and they eventually decided to change the look and direction of the game. H1Z1 has been out for 6 months and they changed the way the game looked at the start and changed and formed a new company. I want new features and bugs to be fixed as much as the next person but we have to be patient and wait. Items aren't implemented and games arent made overnight .

If bases could only be raided while players in said base are online you would just run into your shelter and log off with the goodies thus completely screwing over the raiders who just invested in attacking your base"

h1z1,3e3nht,ChinaIsFree,3,Tue Jul 21 19:00:15 2015 UTC,"I don't really like the idea of having to be online to be raided, because building strategy plays a huge part in defending your base. if anything changes like this, they should make it like Lineage 2's siege system, you sign up and at the attack time you have 2 hours of opening to take it over. (this would make it so when they get in, you all but lose your base if they put new doors on. kinda kicks the ownership thing out the door. he who has the key (passcode to the doors) owns it."
h1z1,3e3nht,plgdg,2,Tue Jul 21 20:55:30 2015 UTC,"Yep, base raiding will always be super easymode.  You just wait until nobody is there, and raid in pvp free super easymode.  That's why I'm hoping the Humanity Servers will be indestructible with clan based permissions systems (not codes).  In the meantime, they could put a cooldown of 30 seconds for incorrect codes.  That would slow down those brute force combo attacks."

h1z1,3e3nht,SaevioGaming,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:06:37 2015 UTC,I posted a while back that they needed to make Bases have a 2nd locking option to just lock to the Owner for those really sensitive base areas.  Something like a Lock that will ask you for a code but no code will work.  As the door owner once its set to Lock you will always be able to open it.    That or some way to lock the door while people are in it to set the people inside to being included in the Door Lock List.  I also don't think a Pin number is secure enough.  Pins are used alongside full blown passwords to protect the data even more not as the sole method for protection.  I Agree With Most Of This OP :)
h1z1,3e3nht,SaintMudknot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:35:53 2015 UTC,I agree that using a 4-digit passcode is very unsecure. Adding an additional digit tacks on 90k more possibilities to guess your code.
h1z1,3e3nht,daddycanuck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:40:12 2015 UTC,Why dont you and your group just raid bases? like you said ''  or like it even matters because a landmine will just blow the door off..''   you make it sound easy why dont you do it yourself then ?  a single landmine wont help you raid a base tho ;) its part of the game go play on PVE if you dont wanna get raided?
h1z1,3e3nht,shuhmac,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:41:39 2015 UTC,"We have no interest in destroying what others work for..

h1z1,3e3nht,ShamblingDead,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:47:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly, its still incredibly unlikely they simply guessed you PIN, even if they 'admitted' to doing it. Reason being, I too would admit I guessed it if it meant you didn't report me for hacking or exploiting glitches to gain access to a base. There's always a chance they did actually guess it though, of course.  In regards to the theme of this post, here's a link to a fantastic suggestion! http://imgur.com/a/HWlTC#0"
h1z1,3e3nht,Teflon187,2,Tue Jul 21 18:53:17 2015 UTC,I thought that as well.. But considering today they just blew it up kind of gives me the impression they were telling the truth.. Why waste the landmines if you already have a system to hack passwords. Also.. They told me what the password was.. I doubt the game itself would have returned the password even if exploited. (but I dont know that.)  That is an awesome idea! I would love to see an app like that!
h1z1,3e3nht,DecayBob,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:02:45 2015 UTC,"Curious indeed. At that point, I'd still doubt the validity of them simply guessing or having some sort of password hacking capabilities, I'd almost assume someone leaked them a password.  /foodforthought"
h1z1,3e3nht,orimdoom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:17:39 2015 UTC,"nah no one leaked the password, its a group of 4 irl friends who all play together."
h1z1,3e3nht,orimdoom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:45:11 2015 UTC,"Part of te fun of this game is base raiding. It's a survival game. I happen to be one of those assholes blowing up walls to steal your stuff. I'm not going to stop, being raided can't be avoided but it can be slightly slowed down. 1 location location location - do you live near a spawn point? What resources are in the area? Does it have a lot of through traffic?  2 doors. Don't use one door, if you feel your easily raided make better passwords(never had someone gues my password) build a base that requires 2 door to enter with 2 different codes.  3 build more places to hide your stuff. It's a rule of thumb in survival games. Your base isn't permanent, nor should it be. Part of the fun of this game is to be attacked. If you were invulnerable the game would get old faster than when It does get attacked.  Have I been raided? Yes. My group also has now made multiple bases and we make IEDs daily.   It takes around 25 IEDs for a gate and 10-15 for a room door. It takes time to find these materials. Unless they are in a area that flourishes with it."
h1z1,3e1nb6,m4nuel88,2,Tue Jul 21 07:06:56 2015 UTC,"I have tested it myself on gates that have been up on my base for over a week. They didn't show the health bar till I used a couple IEDs on them. When I did the gates health was over 90%.  I've asked han twice now and he never responds, yet he comments on my posts.   I've also tested this on shelters, all the same. Always at full health.  Also, hit your structure with a demo hammer, you will see the health bar that way. I keep my stairs at 10% health. They haven't decayed a single point in almost 2 weeks now.  I think Han has accidentally spread a false bug and made everyone insecure"
h1z1,3e1nb6,h1z1builder,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:42:13 2015 UTC,Interesting... although you can't destroy foundation stairs even with a demo hammer. Are you talking about stairs inside your base?

h1z1,3e1nb6,h1z1builder,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:11:41 2015 UTC,I blew up a biofuel on a gate a random guy's gate just to test the damage. Either the bar won't show or they nerfed raiding so much that one biofuel doesn't even do enough damage to show the damage bar.
h1z1,3e1nb6,AceKingSuited18,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:07:09 2015 UTC,"I posted on last week asking this stuff. Biofuel, Ethanol and IED, none of those did damage to gate, but anything around the gate got health bars."

Else I will come back at my base, all walls being gone.. I use IEDS for raiding, but mostly just jump over the gate while boosting eachother on the car in front of the ramp, then IED the shelter doors which are just fine on health showing."

h1z1,3e1nb6,astanar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:20:23 2015 UTC,I couldn't place an IED on a metal gate. Put it in front of it on the ramp and no damage was done (at least not shown).
h1z1,3e1nb6,k00k,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:04:33 2015 UTC,"Well, 1 week ago we (5) raided a base. We got through 2 Metal Gates. 2 Metal Doors and 2 Shelters. We used around 300 IED + (~50) Biofuel.  Another raid: We struggled going through a Metal Gate in front of a Shelter. To start with we tried 100 IED + Ethanol. Then another 100 + Ethanol and Biofuel. No response from the gate. But objects around were getting blown up. We ended up investing all of our IED to get through the Metal Gate in front of the Shelter with no results of doing damage.   Right now we're not going to make the same mistake. Which results in going from the side or from the top to the bottom. Gates seems to be bugged placed in front of a shelter."

It's not fun. No one likes to do it. It simply is reality."

h1z1,3e035w,MormonDew,10,Tue Jul 21 17:38:57 2015 UTC,"That happens quite frequently when a company purchases another. Basically they analyze every single person in the company, and do a cost analysis on whether or not they are worth keeping for what they do. For every $ they work, doesn't it equal $1+ of profit? So they basically went. Okay you're redundant, so and so can do your job with their load, at 3/4 the salary. So that's what happens. Now, as H1Z1 makes Daybreak money, and ultimately their parent company, their salary budget opens up, and they can hire new programmers (like they are now) :)"
h1z1,3e035w,Newkd,2,Mon Jul 20 23:17:06 2015 UTC,"Except they don't have a parent company anymore. Previously they were owned by Sony, now they are independent."
h1z1,3e035w,Newkd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:55:28 2015 UTC,"Not true, they would be independent if Daybreak bought itself out. But they are owned by Columbus Nova (an Investment Company) which is owned by Renova Group (A russian conglomerate involved in Oil, Aluminum, energy and telecommunications).   That investment company is who Smed reports to I would say. So yeah, they do have a parent company, and the gross and profit margin is their priority as is the nature of business. It sucks yeah, but that's how it is."
h1z1,3e035w,Newkd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:58:55 2015 UTC,"They were sold to Columbus but that is not the same thing as a parent company. Daybreak operates independent of any overarching company, Columbus is just where the money comes from. A private equity group does not have the same oversight as Sony did previously. Columbus Nova is a holding company.    On February 2, 2015, Sony announced the sale of SOE to the private equity group Columbus Nova for an undisclosed amount, and that it would be renamed Daybreak Game Company. The studio will operate as an independent company and continue operating SOE's existing games.   Source  EDIT: another source"
h1z1,3e035w,Faust8D,3,Tue Jul 21 06:03:19 2015 UTC,"They are still a subsidiary company of Columbus, who is supplying the main capital. If Daybreak doesn't generate money, they will be sold, and possibly to a more controlling entity, or worse, shut down and liquidated (super worse case scenario). So it's better for them to generate profits for Columbus, and maintain their independence, rather than be sold to say... EA and get ruined as they make H1Spore1 :P  So right now, this is a good sign. Daybreak is generating enough profit for both themselves and Columbus to actually hire more staff. Plus, in the gaming industry, people get hired from other companies with offers. LinkedIn is a bitch sometimes! So they need to replace people."

Get rid of redundant employees (in the opinion of the ""auditer"") in order to decrease their overhead.

Dont ban them, just ruin their game to the point that they will quit and never comes back."
h1z1,3dy71i,Fmk0,17,Mon Jul 20 15:24:09 2015 UTC,"When I ran a minecraft server for some of my nephew's friends, i would grief the cheaters.  Simple things like teleporting them into the sky.  They'd rage quit and wouldn't come back on because apparently cheaters hate being the ones getting griefed."

I admin'd on a 7DTD server and would put on godmode and punch the cheaters to death while they unloaded guns on me. So much fun. I also built a jail with 4 cells and made a server command that would spam teleport them into whichever cell I chose every half-second, so even if they were no-clip flyers they would be stuck in that jail cell. GG"
h1z1,3dy71i,JuneauWho,8,Tue Jul 21 20:08:55 2015 UTC,Ruining their time would be an amazing taste of their own medicine.

Make all their guns do 0 dmg, and when they shoot someone, the server spawns in a NPC and shoots and instakills them, and the NPC starts mic spamming like a 12 year old mic spam calling the cheater shit and telling them to uninstall and crap."

h1z1,3dy71i,Makoh1z1,2,Mon Jul 20 23:02:36 2015 UTC,"Really we just need a more secure login and account creation for Daybreak. Maybe PvP only is allowed for registered customers and/or for those who have played the game longer than 2 weeks and invested more than 20h ingame. PvE is a GREAT way to learn the game, and it comes at a reduced cost; like Planetside 2 where you start off in a low-level beginners land and must graduate a handful of levels before being able to participate in the full game.  Beginners servers?"

h1z1,3dy71i,howsyeronions,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:05:13 2015 UTC,It would be funny to have the server stop responding to their client generated traffic and not allow them to interact with the environment. They would be effectively banished to playing single player and at the same time they may not realize they've been spending time their time with the intention of griefing players only to later realize they had wasted that time doing nothing but running around an empty world.

Outright ban them, this is good because it allows the devs to make more money if the banner comes back. Allowing for more funding for banning systems and manual systems."

h1z1,3dy71i,Biomed,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:16:06 2015 UTC,A long time ago playing cod I thought that is what should have happened.  Once caught as a hacker it would only spawn you in games with other hackers.    But I do know the devs are taking doors and gates off of cheater bases then send out a broadcast message which is great.  But please don't forget to tell us the quadrant and server name so we can get to there stuff before they do via a second account.

h1z1,3dy71i,Craucho,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:38:51 2015 UTC,"They would just ban them, because in the end it generates more money for them.  Unless they are buying keys to skins."
h1z1,3dy71i,kcxiv,0,Mon Jul 20 21:54:26 2015 UTC,It doesn't generate more money for them. They have to pay people to go on and look for all this stuff. And they pay them to clearly watch multiple people to make sure they really are actually hacking. Some don't make it very obvious. They also have to pay people to go through the hundreds if not thousands of support issues (proof of cheaters and other things).
h1z1,3dy71i,Shadow14l,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:18:39 2015 UTC,"They've have to be doing all that work regardless of people buying back in or not in order to try and keep the number of cheaters as low as possible and not ban innocent players, so wouldn't make any difference if people just got moved servers instead of banned as they'd still need people to actually check to see if they were cheaters first, but if people are being banned and buying back in then it obviously does create more money than if they weren't buying back in.   Don't get me wrong though, I'd rather just see the cheaters gone."
h1z1,3dy71i,Tobax,0,Tue Jul 21 00:23:38 2015 UTC,"except any game for any company is going to have people who do that. its just a job that every  online gaming company has.  Thats part of PC gaming. So,t hey are still going to get income incoming from that."
h1z1,3dy71i,kcxiv,-5,Tue Jul 21 00:53:55 2015 UTC,Absolutely NO.   Why the hell would they put up and maintain a private server just for cheaters? There is no logic whatsoever in doing that.
h1z1,3dy71i,Ely_Bob,2,Mon Jul 20 14:59:16 2015 UTC,"It's a silly idea, I'd prefer it to be shadow banning in a different way (perhaps they get all sorts of bugs such as very slow door/container openings, louder footsteps, worse hit registration, voice comms randomly not sending, IEDs not lighting, biofuel not exploding when shot, codes on doors not working, etc.).   But the OPs reasoning only works if the idea is to have them waste time so that they aren't going and buying new accounts right away to come back and harass us. If you can't keep them out, then perhaps do their best to keep them busy with nonsense.  Edit: I kind of like the idea of the server just not showing them any players at all anywhere. They see zombies, loot, and animals, but they don't see cars, bases, or players. It will just look to them like a 'Very Low' populated server and maybe they'll get bored and leave. :)"
h1z1,3dy71i,thorax,-2,Mon Jul 20 16:49:21 2015 UTC,"They wouldnt waste time. Theyd see whats happening, and go buy a new game anyway. Or when the game is f2p, figure out how to get around the detection system and get a new account"
h1z1,3dy71i,Ely_Bob,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:04:55 2015 UTC,"Nah, the trick is to make it a different, subtle discouragement all the time and be sure that it is server side and hard to tell the difference between alpha bugs, lag, and whatever else.  It's not exactly great, but they already are doing something like this, I wager. The devs have said before that suspected cheaters are having a very ""different experience"" than the rest of us. No clarification on that but it's surely something like a simulated degraded experience (either in the works or already implemented)."
h1z1,3dy71i,thorax,-1,Mon Jul 20 17:08:17 2015 UTC,"Nope. Theyve already talked about it. There istn a degraded experience. If they get caught cheating, they get banned. Plain and simple. They arent wasting any code time on silly mechanics just for cheaters."
h1z1,3dy71i,Ely_Bob,2,Mon Jul 20 17:42:30 2015 UTC,"You're saying that they didn't say they had a different experience, or are you saying they later changed their mind? Because you're definitely wrong if you're disagreeing with the former statement.  Edit: In case you forgot-- https://www.reddit.com/r/h1z1/comments/2ydnu8/a_few_words_about_anticheat_measures/   Secondly, the automated systems have been on for a while. We monitor many things (and we won't give details here) and the systems already take automatic actions. Those people using cheats experience a different kind of game than the rest of us. I spend a good part of my time reviewing logs to make sure the actions are not penalizing innocent players, although at times they have. I do apologize for this, but it will happen."

You know,  cheaters that buy 10-20 accounts at a time.  They dont play them all at once, but chain them."

h1z1,3e29zt,Ely_Bob,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:36:25 2015 UTC,"I provide proof.    Where? Where is your proof that there aren't thousands of hackers? You said some people have up to 20 accounts. So if there were 20,000 banned, your still talking 1000 hackers and most of those guys probably don't have twenty accounts and they just logged back in. That's just one ban wave that didn't even cover all the hackers. So the numbers just confirm that it is very likely that the number of hackers currently in game is in the thousands."
h1z1,3e29zt,Callsemlikeiseesum,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:27:24 2015 UTC,The onus is on the person who first implied there were 1000's of cheaters( not hackers) to validate their assumption.
h1z1,3e29zt,Ely_Bob,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:23:59 2015 UTC,Not all the cheaters come back after HW bans.  They aren't all hardcore hackzorz with work-arounds or unlimited swappable HDD/SSD

h1z1,3e3hzf,Jellysickle420,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:16:50 2015 UTC,Exactly We are going to see Patches on Test Server being worked out then put on Live for Final Test with large numbers.  Right now the Test Server is having alot of issues including not being able to Hammer/Repair things and lack of Blackberry Bushes.  I think The Developers should test a bit more on the Test just to root out the worse and easiest to see errors.  If they come out with a good build then put on the Live for Massive Testing by the rest of the Alpha Testers.  If Professions come out in a month that would be a good testing Cycle in My Honest Opinion :)

It turned out to be one of the hairiest raids I've had the fortune to record. The position was a nightmare, 2 bases up on top of the highest elevation in the area with almost ZERO cover within hunting rifle range except a single low-walled developer-placed compound. Both bases had defenders inside them and we had to plant explosives under fire the entire time on the first deck. We could not reliably hit the guys in the bee-box base further away from our cover so we resorted to suppressing fire just to keep their snipers' heads down. It worked. We had little loss of life and we dealt with the reinforcements that kept showing up in a truck. Quite a nice loot haul out of those 2 bases."

h1z1,3e2o59,MormonDew,2,Tue Jul 21 15:46:28 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. With nearly 900 hours of H1Z1 behind me, I start getting very tired of having to switch servers after losing all of mine and my group's stuff to a hacker. I have no problem with dying and losing my gear to a legit player, but hackers... they frustrate me.   I report hackers and I try to catch them on video (Nvidia's shadowplay) and send those videolinks to Daybreak's hacker email address. I'd love to get some confirmation or feedback or just some way of knowing if the person has been banned or not. Otherwise it just feels pointless.  I get they don't have the time to reply to every single email they get, but some kind of public list would be great. It's not like these people deserve some kind of ""secrecy"" anyway if they cheat, they should be publicly shamed.  Also it probably wouldn't be so hard to make this list since they already post those announcements in game?"

But hey, it's not my job to weed out the hackers if they are or aren't hacking. I feel it is my job to report who I truly believe is using cheats, and unfortunately, that's a lot of the player base."

h1z1,3e2dft,Hypnotekz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:46:22 2015 UTC,"I don't have a problem with people building in cities, or in general, but if they block off loot spawns, that should be some sort of offense. I feel that devs should remove the buildings, and  NOT refund the items required to build it back to the players, and give them a day ban or so.  I don't remember where I saw it, but there was this giant campsite blocked off by some guys who put up shacks all around it, and made a base as a connector, and the only way in was through their base. What a bunch of jackasses man."
h1z1,3e2dft,TalonHere,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:14:55 2015 UTC,"This is only a noticeable issue now because the map is so tiny, this will be a non-issue when the map is at full size.  The map is currently only 0.4% of its final size, the devs WANT players and groups to be able to control whole areas (think TWD Woodbury).  When people think they see an issue like this, they need to step back and think ""will this effect the game when its finished""? In this case, the answer is no.."
h1z1,3e2dft,HaniiBlu,2,Tue Jul 21 17:00:53 2015 UTC,Is that .4 an exaggeration or is it seriously going to be bigger then some Arma III maps?

h1z1,3e2dft,Catastrophe85,-1,Tue Jul 21 20:24:11 2015 UTC,This has been called for a thousand times over. I hope the devs listen.
h1z1,3e2dft,DayZedConfused,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:01:13 2015 UTC,"Never going to happen.   besides, when the map grows substantially larger, it will be a complete non issue.  As for those ""traps"", you do realise you can destroy any object not on a player made foundation pretty easily right?"
h1z1,3e2dft,Ely_Bob,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:01:42 2015 UTC,"How will it be a non-issue?  On the high-pop servers, a given clan will simply camp a major area.  Another, whom they were currently competing against, will simply pull chocks and go camp the other place.  Or, if the first clan leaves Because Shiny New Object, the second clan will camp PV.  In any case, you get casuals, solos, and small groups unable to use the cities.  There's got to be some sort of artificial constraint on this sort of thing.  I saw the video ""breaking into the biggest base ever"" and was absolutely amazed that the team that owned the base had entirely surrounded the Farms with small shacks like a wall.  Ineffective, but that's not the point.  It's game-ruining."
h1z1,3e2dft,Ravenloff,0,Tue Jul 21 13:17:45 2015 UTC,"The map will be substantially larger than it is now with many cities. Also,   ( it's not yet implemented), if a player builds a base next to a loot spawn and tries to camp it, loot will not spawn while that player is in that area.   Also, if a player or group takes over a building in an effort to camp the loot spawn,  the loot will not spawn in that building anymore until the barricades and fortifications have been removed.  You and others dont seem to understand that many of the features to stop what you are afraid of, arent implemented right now."
h1z1,3e2dft,Ely_Bob,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:22:08 2015 UTC,"""Afraid of"" is absolutely the least accurate term for how I feel about the development of a video game.  This isn't my first alpha rodeo either.  We have a game that is currently out and it functions in a way that should be regarded as a state of flux.  I do not expect it will remain in the state that it is in, but I know enough from previous alpha and beta builds to know that anything that gets implemented is to be treated as icing on the cake, not something I or anyone else is owed.  In other words, what they promise and what they end up implementing are two different things.  If they implement everything you outline, great.  It will preserve those areas for everyone to fight over, as should be."

We had a guy on my server (sry can't remember server or his name, few wipes ago now, somebody might know) who took it upon himself to be the bear protector, every time a bear showed up he would run around the bases shouting ""Emergency PV Animal Services Alert, bear in vicinity"" In return he wanted us to leave food and water on our steps'...he would stop, take his supplies and have a quick chat...happy days."

h1z1,3e2a15,datrig,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:09:20 2015 UTC,I dont remember a walk around for it but it has to do with the spacing. The walls are touching or overlapping so they cant be placed.
h1z1,3e2a15,africanjesus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:34:13 2015 UTC,There is a workaround. I have seen extension bases with full walls around them.  Some posts say place right side then left.  Others say vice versa.
h1z1,3e2a15,b15hop88,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:48:20 2015 UTC,when you cant place demo the wall that its overlapping off then place the one you first couldnt. shacks will also bloke placement so best to lay all walls and upper before building on the foundation.
h1z1,3e2a15,bluets,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:37:00 2015 UTC,"I found a way to place the walls down without issue. Its a bit too much to type out. I thought about showing it on stream at some point.   You have to place the one wall with upper first. then the opposite side. I usually stand on one extension and place the wall that will furthest away first (the side on the adjacent extension). Again, you need to place the upper wall on it immediately after placing the lower one. I hope all of this makes sense. I have a huge headache today. I apologize."

h1z1,3dzh6t,Kuldred,4,Mon Jul 20 20:32:10 2015 UTC,"Right before each wipe, I spend a couple of days exploring the map, looking for potentially cool base spots.  I've made bases up by the Gov mansion, just outside of PV, a few areas west of Rancho, and the extreme south tip of Pisspot creek.  Nice areas all.  But for the past three wipes, I've been making the SE corner my home.  For all the reasons you list above, and also about the certain amount of control you have over encounters.  Not many people over there, so if all I want to do is make loot runs, it's great.  If I want more PvP action, I can choose to make a PV run.  And it takes only one run to the PV church for all the nightvision you could ever need.  That place spawns what, like 8 of them at once?  Yep, love that whole area."
h1z1,3dzh6t,Kuldred,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:29:05 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah! I totally forgot about the PV church. The van up there always seems to have like 6 metal sheets in it for some reason, and the gates/walls surrounding the graveyard are littered with night vision, ammo, bottles, etc."

h1z1,3dzh6t,ChaosAverted65,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:37:23 2015 UTC,"After god knows how many respawns, this does seem to be the case. I spawn around there, or in the field further south, constantly. That's why I like making my big decoy base in that big field, because new spawns are likely to see it and become fixated. If you're a ganker, it's a great way to fuck with people. If you're like me and just wanna hand stuff out in between scrap runs, you can find plenty of fresh spawns to set up with gear and make friends with."
h1z1,3dzh6t,ThisMetalChick,2,Mon Jul 20 20:43:18 2015 UTC,I've spent about 120 hours in this game and have never built a Base once.  I normally play by myself and try and meet random people and see what happens.  I've never felt the desire to build a Base.  Am I missing out on something? Idk  even how to begin Base building
h1z1,3dzh6t,LommyGreenhands,3,Mon Jul 20 21:27:03 2015 UTC,"I guess it really depends. I mostly play solo too, so I like knowing I have a safe place to store back-up weapons, ammo, backpacks, etc. that way, if I end up in some kind of conflict with a group or something, I can keep fighting back without scavenging from square one, or take my stack of fertilizer, find their base, and do it up right.  Once my main base is up, one of my favorite things to do is drop my stuff off in a container, and just /respawn to some random spot on the map and make my way back on foot, or just run around exploring, whatever. You can have a big base up in the SE in a couple hours, then spend the rest of your week playing as you normally do, occasionally stopping back home to drop off any sweet hauls you might wanna use later.  To start, get yourself some scrap, make 1 metal bracket, 1 metal sheet, a wood plank, and some nails. Discover all the building stuff you can with those, then whip yourself up a small shack/metal door/storage container(s). It should only take you a half hour or so, tops, and you can decide if you like it or not long term."

h1z1,3dzh6t,sev1nk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:00:16 2015 UTC,"Oh, lol.  Now THAT puts me in the mind to suggest some sort of ""survival"" ratio, akin to a kill:death ratio in pure shooters.  It would be a measure of number of total spawns and hours played.  This would reward those that spawn where the game puts them and just suck it up :)  Previously, I had been making a home near devil's pass, back in the days before I started building.  I would make a beeline straight there whenever I got killed."
h1z1,3dzh6t,Ram419,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:45:29 2015 UTC,"""There are car spawns all over around there. A jeep and a cop car both spawn at the SE gas station, with plenty of truck/jeep spawns on the roads both ways and more at the other gas stations.""  Are we talking about the same SE corner of the map (I9)? I've never seen any vehicle spawns in that corner except at the top house on Corona Drive and none on the roads anywhere near there."
h1z1,3dzh6t,sev1nk,2,Mon Jul 20 21:36:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I promise. The blue house farthest back from the gas station has a regular jeep spawn in the driveway, and a cop car spawns right next to the service shop. A jeep will spawn next to the campsight there too sometimes. And right after a server wipe I found 2 trucks on the road up to Lone Pine and 2 more to the west just past de soto. Plus, there's another gas station I forget the name of past de soto, just below a bridge by some houses, that spawns a cop car and jeep, and i found a jeep at those houses once, too.   My guess is they're getting snapped up and hoarded pretty quick, which does happen. It can be a real pain in the ass being set up way out in the woods until you find one, so if I go days without seeing any I'll usually gear up for a wander and go hunting for hoarder bases."
h1z1,3e1e52,nobodymustfindmyporn,5,Tue Jul 21 05:22:05 2015 UTC,I picked it up during the Steam sale and have already put 119 hours into it. The only bad part about the game is the community. Survival PVP is basically a deathmatch with a slow pace and a survival component.
h1z1,3e1e52,sev1nk,2,Tue Jul 21 05:45:46 2015 UTC,Buy it and you'll get your moneys worth
h1z1,3e1e52,UltimateJim,2,Tue Jul 21 05:38:41 2015 UTC,"I love the game! Definitely worth the buy. It has its bugs but its still pre alpha release. I think survival pvp is great, there is always something for me to do such as raiding someone elses base, going around and hoarding the cars ;), looting all the goodies, getting materials for building the biggest base ever and just killing people for their loot!

h1z1,3e1e52,Tallahasee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:11:39 2015 UTC,If h1z1 had arks base building features it would be amazing as shit. Ark pvp is more like reign of kings tho.. shot someone in the head 8 times to kill them kinda deal. H1 is a lot more satisfying for pvp but if you wanna build crazy ass bases and structures it's ark.   H1 is worth its price tag considering the hours of fun you will get.

h1z1,3e1e52,drabo7777,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:08:08 2015 UTC,I would say no. Whit such speed of developing the complete version of game you see maybe after 5+ year or so. Very very slow developing here either way you like CS:GO skins opening boxes maybe you will like it here tooo.  If u havent tried Rust try it. I just started 2 weeks ago its unique game and developing is realy promising. Every week new stuff. Every hour new fixes. Havent seen any survival game in such pace.

Like professions:  should come out on 30. June or so.  Now they should come this week, but im pretty sure they wont make it this week."
h1z1,3e1e52,aytrax,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:49:44 2015 UTC,"I'd say buy it. I love the game and have about 100 or so hours into it. At first, I mostly played on survival (even though I haven't touched it in months), but now I mostly play Battle Royals every now and then. If you have friends to play with, it's definitely worth it. They're constantly updating the game week by week, and so far it's been fun."
h1z1,3e1e52,hardujuu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:14:43 2015 UTC,"If you enjoy Battle Royale, then yes.  The 'usual' survival aspect is a bit bad right now, everyone kills everyone on sight. Only the other players are a real threat."

h1z1,3e1e52,Hhffgfrfghj,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:46:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, play low population servers if you enjoy survival and not getting spawn killed"
h1z1,3e1e52,Biomed,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:36:01 2015 UTC,I was so reluctant to buy it that a friend ende up gifting it to me. Coming up on 100 hours played. Any game I can get 100 hours out of I would say is well worth it.   Definitely having friends to play with adds a lot to the game though. If you are solo you may want to find a clan or something.
h1z1,3e1e52,Biomed,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:46:01 2015 UTC,I would recommend it but I definitely suggest playing on low population servers as a beginner. The number one downside to this game currently is hacking. I just wish they would implement an automatic hack detection system.
h1z1,3e1e52,iReptarr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:49:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not a scrub, part of the experience is interaction with other player IMO, not passively farming loot with no challenge/encounter"
h1z1,3e1e52,Callsemlikeiseesum,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:44:50 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean a beginner as you being a scrub, I mean just new to this game. In terms of it's better on low population servers because there is less kill on sight than on high pop servers. I bet it would be disheartening for you to get the game go on the high pop and keep dying when you spawn, as that is what it is like on some of the high pop servers. Also with the high population servers there is a higher chance of hackers. I only play on low population server (sometimes it goes to medium) you still get plenty of action and I have only came across one clan of hackers since I bought the game three months ago. Hope they do implement automatic banning of hackers as it will ruin the game if not."

h1z1,3e1e52,marcjpb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:58:30 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for a survival game than you should maybe wait a bit. At this point in time it's just COD on a big map, and it seems more and more that the community and the devs want it that way so at least at this point, and it might change, it does not fit into the survival genre. But battle royal is really fun. Its not why I got the game and I could care less if they scrap it as I already own Arma 3, but its fun enough that you'll get your money's worth out of the game."
h1z1,3e1e52,TalonHere,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:37:36 2015 UTC,"Listen I've see. Ark, DayZ, Rust, played 7 Days to Die, and I absolutely love H1Z1. I have put tons of hours in. Sometimes I take little breaks but find myself coming back. This game is great and getting better. Most complaints you see fail to recognize this game as an Alpha Test, and more of a release because they can buy it and play it. Truth is, it is an alpha test and things change and add and remove. Should you buy it? Yes. I think if you enjoy the survival style games this game will be enjoyable. I love the crafting system and I think the guns are made well so far. Expect lots of stuff in the future of this game. And remember Daybreak has a good streak of popular fun games and I doubt this one will fail. (The other games being EVERQUEST, and Planetside/PS2)  Its easy to get your money's worth out of this one too"
h1z1,3e1e52,ChinaIsFree,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:22:27 2015 UTC,"Three thing to know   Its a real Early Access, not as bad as Dayz at the start but still buggy. Survival aspect atm aren't too present. It very trivial right now to survive once you learn the rope of the game. Very kos oriented atm.   If you can keep that in mind and enjoy pvp & fps, this game will suck you in.  Its fun and well worth the buy, even not on sales. You get an update almost every week making the game progress pretty well. If you can play with a friend (or friends), its even better."
h1z1,3e1e52,marcjpb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:20:41 2015 UTC,"Imo, the entire KOS orientated aspect is something that just kinda spirals out of control.   I used to only KOS based on if somebody had a nice gun or backpack, or something that I really wanted. Needless to say, I didn't KOS everyone. Just people that had something I wanted. I let new spawns be, or told them to leave, and warned them that I'd kill them the next time I saw them in my same area. I was a merciful person.  Now, I kill on sight all the time, for one reason. Everyone else seems to do it. I don't LIKE killing everybody I see, but I don't like losing my gear even more. The constant fear of being KOS'd myself, has taught me, if I don't kill them, they will kill me. It spirals out of control, because people end up developing the same mindset as I have: ""Kill or be killed"". Another thing I've noticed. New spawns seem to not KOS. Probably because of a lack of gear to lose. Go figure.  I'd like to see some sort of ""Humanity meter"" or something of that nature. IE: KOS players have a red dot, or name, or something next to them. Neutral players have a white name. Good players have a green name. There would be no penalty for killing a red player. Basically, the red players live a life of constantly being KOS'd, and KOSing, and everyone else just goes on with their surviving. Maybe a system like DayZ Epoch's, but with a color code.  Also, as a rule of thumb for me, if I find a base that has blocked off loot spawns, I go out of my way to kill the people who built that base, over and over, and over, until they move out."

I restart my game every BR because if I don't, I get 20-30 fps in cities due to this STILL NOT FIXED memory leak.

Reddit is good at throwing out daily content for the average person, but on the other hand, this website is horrible for long-term discussions. I can't think of any word besides 'joke' when they think one-day-threads will bring any kind of deep conversation between users and admins/devs.   And consider that anyone, no matter who he/she is, can downvote threads and make them disappear and/or make them look unimportant, irrelevant or non existant.

Reddit or an other shitty blog won't change anything, you're just looking at the wrong problem here.   And anyway, it is just SCIENTIFICALLY impossible to deny the fact that everyone is quiting because of this. Servers are going more empty everyday, this game will die because they released it too soon, the mistake has already been made.

CB radios are in game already fyi and recipe wipe is meh, unless they add some blueprint you have to find in the world to unlock recipe, recipe wipe is a mini time sink that have no reason to be imo.  Most of what you are asking / wishing for can be done with a whitelist server. No TS is the hardest to do because its 100% honor since you can't detect it in any way.  I would remove Nameplate also. I hate that shit.  I really like the idea of having a big clan that control each main cities (Cranberry, PV, Ranchino) and every member of that clan spawn with the clan's uniform.  A member of an opposite clan or an independant player could infiltrate the clan by wearing there uniform :p Infiltration with only in game chat / radio and no nameplate could really make fun encounters."

In my opinion that only demonstrates  that the bug is getting worse!!!. Plus farming crops in H1Z1 is a very important part of the game, even if it is true that you could just use IED and Biofuel.  Another point of view: the devs just stated they had fixed some problems with crops, shouldn't they be aware that the problems are not solved?"

I deleted my character. With the tamper timer bug back having my base taken over and destroyed was the final straw. Hammers don't work anymore but my base was far from being in need of a repair. And yes I logged in every day, several times a day so that wasn't the issue either. Six bases around me were also gone today that were there yesterday. But no worries I guess.... On to other things."

h1z1,3e1rbk,AsteroidMoney30,2,Tue Jul 21 07:59:59 2015 UTC,"im still pretty new myself, but you should probably start off on a pve server to get the hang of the game"
h1z1,3e1rbk,gamer_ditzy,2,Tue Jul 21 08:14:10 2015 UTC,"The goal of a BR is to be the last person alive. Down in the bottom right corner you'll see your grid location (A1/B2/C3 and so on) press M to bring up your map so you can see where you are on the grid. After a few minutes of a BR the Toxic Gas will be displayed on the map with a Green Circle and you have to get inside that circle to be safe. Any part of the map that is solid green now has gas in it and you will die (as you learned) if you stay in it for too long without healing/escaping. This is a mechanic to keep people from camping and having BRs last forever. In the top right corner you'll see which direction you're facing on your compass. IF you get stuck in the gas you can use your gauze and any first aid kits you've found to heal yourself, and you want to run so that the red hurt indicator is at the bottom of your screen. This means you're running out of the gas.  When you first load in to the Box of Destiny (You'll know you're here by all the idiots screaming racial slurs and the word ""Summit"" over and over and over again) Drop your flashlight, place your flare and put your binoculars in one of your Item slots and unpack your gauze. Then you'll be ready to go when you parachute in.  Speaking of parachuting in you can control to a modest extent where you land and how fast you get down. If you want to get down fast aim down at the ground with your mouse and press the A and D key back and forth over and over again until you get down.  I'd recommend taking gamer_ditzy's advice and playing some PvE to get the hang of the game mechanics. Also check out http://www.twitch.tv/omniskillz as he's a nice guy who I'm sure would help you out with some tips and has 374 BR wins as of this writing.  As an aside I also got 40th in my first BR, and got 4th in my second so good luck. :)"

h1z1,3e1rbk,FreaKtmnz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:01:27 2015 UTC,"Learn the map / direction you are facing.  When playing BR, smoke gets released and you have to head to the safe zone whilst killing other people."
h1z1,3e1rbk,Diamondandy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:04:43 2015 UTC,"Asteroid,  When you see the message that tells you a safe area has been marked, you should press ""M"" on the keyboard. The safe area will be marked by a green circle.   Using the compass (Top right of your screen), you should head in that direction, to make sure you are inside of the green circle.   Once the Toxic gas has filled the area OUTSIDE of the green circle and new circle will be drawn on the map. Press ""M"" again, and make sure you get yourself inside of that green circle.  Just keep repeating."
h1z1,3e1rbk,1amShaw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:15:30 2015 UTC,"BR is fairly simple. Try to land by houses ideally or failing that a campsite. You want a tac helmet, tac vest, AK and/or AR with a few mags of ammo, shotgun with 12 or 18 shots, throwable weapons like grenades if you are into those, and at least 5 or 6 med kits, and ideally a car but it isn't necessary. Then head for a safe zone as marked on your map. At this point to can either hide and hope everyone else kills each other, or you can be agressive and try to kill everyone yourself which will net you more ammo and med kits and maybe cars. If you have a med kit active the gas doesn't do much damage to you so you can survive in the gas for a while if you have enough."

h1z1,3e1qwy,PineappleHumdinger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:48:53 2015 UTC,"the point is that at short range, ak > shotgun, which is pretty much the only the only range the shotgun has a place, and now that ak is better in that, it just makes shotgun useless"
h1z1,3e1qwy,L00n3y,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:17:38 2015 UTC,The shotgun is not better than the AK for close encounters. Most people just have crappy aim and miss with the shotgun.

It has a desktop application you can run which looks at your clipboard for coordinates you've just copied. So when you copy the coords in game it automatically updates your position on the map. You do need to be registered with the website and signed in.  Also if you make a run to the dam at some point, the lockers inside usually have lots of tan military backpacks."

Theyve stated that right at the start oF Alpha, and again when they were changing the loot mechanics.  Building materials for example, theyve said that bases will require MUCH more resources to craft and repair, and when destroyed, youll get a very small amount back."
h1z1,3dyked,Ely_Bob,2,Mon Jul 20 16:36:35 2015 UTC,Metrics.  An essential part of alpha testing. I wish more people realized this.  The game isn't balanced towards survival gameplay right now.  It's balanced for testing and data collection.

E - I think the metal spawns is fine, I would however like to see re-inforced versions of all build materials that we have now. So a re-inforced metal gate could  be 5x stronger and take 5x the materials. You could determine how strong you wanted it to be, would really throw a krinkle in raiding :) 2x the normal materials and you would get a 2x gate. All structures would be able to be re-inforced."

In real SHTF situation guns and ammo would be the most valued asset one could possess.   Truly the H1Z1 is far from perfect but I love it. My main complaint is that it does not allow a true team or group effort and it encourages each individual to build individual bases rather than all pulling together. Permissions should be permanent and only revocable by the team founder/leader, NOT a day to day permission. Problem is than when leader is absent from this game the other team members are restricted from base functions. This causes everyone to be lone wolfs."

h1z1,3e183a,OldSchoolRasslin,2,Tue Jul 21 05:09:08 2015 UTC,"The change is abrupt and offsetting, It would be more work on their part but a gradual change across 2 or 3 patches would help tune item spawns over time. Right now I'm finding there's way more Magnums than .44 rounds."

h1z1,3e2ekg,Faust8D,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:34:12 2015 UTC,Sure will because hackers did in fact try getting into the base and failed. This was just after the same hacker took out my previous floating unraidable base (built before the new design that was built after that one during the 1st wipe session that it lasted). My base has lasted two consecutive wipes and the 3rd will be secured shortly after this one ends. Just like the other nay sayers... you will eventually see my design when it becomes popular. Only a matter of time son.

Well we finally sent in the reports and about an hour later he got the first account banned. So we were celebrating and then he comes flying through again and kills another one of our guys. That's when our guy said something along the lines of ""you guys are not going to believe this but I just got killed by him again even after he just got banned"" (we were not in the same area when he died and he was telling us over TS). That's when the second message came and we laughed so hard. It was just major justice. This was at crescent reach on the antidote server by the way. We haven't seen him since this happened, hopefully he doesn't come back. He was trying so hard to say he wasn't cheating too but it was so obvious. I kid you not, he would hit arrow headshots from 50 - 100 meters away while you were running and then say he was just really good. So glad he got banned. Thank you to the devs for handling this so fast. I was afraid his second account wouldn't be banned right away, but what a great turn around.

My personal opinion on this matter is that there are a lot of things that need to stay persistent across restarts.  Furnaces however, I don't think are a big deal.  I actually don't agree with the mechanic right now were furnaces are fire and forget.  They should need constant attention to prevent burning out."
h1z1,3dxhgb,ScionoicS,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:09:31 2015 UTC,"The furnace should visually show it's lit if it's lit-- then you wouldn't have to check and it would handle things properly. It's been a bug since Day 1, let's get the persistence fixed so that things you do actually aren't reverted randomly."
h1z1,3dxhgb,thorax,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:57:09 2015 UTC,"Would kinda be awesome to indeed, have constant attention and when u stand next to it, and the furnace almost go out, there activates an option to 'Blow at Furnice' to make it don't go out or something."

h1z1,3dxhgb,fishcustard85,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:18:43 2015 UTC,+1 thrown your way OP.  We have a massive base that involves multiple tampers and use that same technique to cover the gaps between tampers.  Ideally some day they'll add the ability to simply expand the size of your existing ground tamper when adding another one instead of having a gap between them like they do now.
h1z1,3dxhgb,fishcustard85,2,Mon Jul 20 17:00:59 2015 UTC,"Or you know, you people could stop making stupid bases that have doors open...."
h1z1,3dxhgb,ScionoicS,-1,Mon Jul 20 14:11:14 2015 UTC,"You comment doesn't add anything really to the discussion. Why bother to post anyway?  Try to put 2 foundations next to eachother without space. Without using doors. Goodluck. While these limitations are still there, people try to find other solutions.  Like when there wasn't a ramp, They just made a couple basic shacks with open door to make a garage.  Its humanity once they limit stuff to do.  Its awesome to have a 8-deck foundation base, not stupid. So its either, safe door states or rebuild the building-structure. Like blocks 1x1, you can build everything then. Now you're stuck with the default squared foundations, which you can expand, but how bigger the better right?"
h1z1,3dxhgb,HaniiBlu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:17:37 2015 UTC,"Stopped reading after first 2 words, it's just pointless QQ. Why leave doors open? Just make a REAL BASE and stop crying. The end."

Shack's also do not have health bars, and these decay in two weeks, I placed a shack on Friday 3rd, I repaired the Metal Door on it a few times, July 17th the Shack had gone but door and everything build inside it was still there.  I'm not 100% sure how decay and damage work, but they could be separate which is why you see damage from damage but not decay maybe? Weirder things have happened during this games development lol."

It will be easier to see the door opening from the inside during placement.   As for the overhanging shelter, your trouble is probably coming from a lower wall being in the way.  Demolish the lower wall from the area you want your shelter to hang and you should have no problem."

There's also a reason the Event Tickets won't be taken yet (also because the game is still in development, but still). The game-mode is still in development as is the whole game, and you might experience bugs like this.

h1z1,3e0c62,GGGregg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:45:15 2015 UTC,"From the last base my friends and I raided, barring weird IED placement issues and weird bugs, it took 25 IEDs for a base metal gate.  Last time we checked the biofuel to IED ratio was still ~2:1.  So like Trunks said, probably about 50.    For metal doors, our IED count varied but I'd estimate about 15 IEDs for a full strength door...so 30'ish.  Hope this helps!"

h1z1,3e074w,Primadude,-2,Mon Jul 20 23:30:16 2015 UTC,"If the servers are lagging, it can have a small effect on client performance too.  Most fps drops are caused when the client is attempting to load and render in new assets as they come into render distance, if the server is struggling, it may take longer to send the client that data and in turn the client spends longer than it should loading assets, which will cause fps drops."

h1z1,3dym12,TreeFaceLeaf,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:29:12 2015 UTC,"It's only a problem when players don't take the time and effort to look in out of the way places for bases that are full of cars.  Most players still don't realize how easy it is to blow up a vehicle that's locked inside a base from the outside.  On our server we usually spend an hour or two just roaming around and inspecting any player base we come across. If there's a car in it, we blow it up, problem solved.  And if we come across a car we don't need, we plant a mine under it. =P"

My base is currently setup that my park spot is surronded by a inner gate (gate between the foncdataion and the fondation expansion) + 3 shelters.

The best thing they could do is give players base garages with a personal car for scrap or whatever, that they can sell crate skins for.  Alternately, have all cars despawn when they aren't being used, say 5 minutes or 20 or whatever.  With so few cars it makes no sense people should hoard and then stop playing, no more than hogging shotguns when the game came out.  Features of the game should be kept for those who are playing"

h1z1,3dym12,Jolaxle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:53:30 2015 UTC,"i know it is a pain, we have 5 cars between 5 bases and a group of 20. we only take cars we come across, never hunt for them as we dont need them (PV has all the supplies we need). i think it is human nature to horde as much as we can. also i think that running around and walking is so much effort in this game, the car makes life so much easier and fun. they should add something in between to balance the  OPness of the car so people don't always go to them. they could balance it by making it so you can only get fuel from looting it, but each fuel you find is worth 100% of a tank. i think crafting fuel is silly imo."

I rented a TS, started a group,  but theres nothing you can do against rampant cheating especially in this sort of game. You get rewarded for rushing and killing on sight because you have no idea when youll go down to a hacker, and you have no idea when your stash will be ESP'ed. When I Was actually trying at this game I was unstoppable, I had stashes all over the map, I spent hours scouting for the best stash/base spots, but it was pointless because of ESP and teleporting hackers.

If the auto-ban still isn't ready after 6 months of development, you need to hire more anti-cheat people or get a new anti-cheat team.  The players they're losing aren't leaving because they're bored, they're leaving because blatant cheaters are ruining the game for them.  Example:  We have several clans we're allied with that have bases all over the map.  Several days ago, ALL of their bases got raided in one night.  Doors blown off, gates still up.  It wasn't just them either, there were eternal fires at bases all over the dang map.  So some group of low skill cheaters no-clipped half the bases on the server in a single night.    How many of those players are going to quit and never come back?  Rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat, until your game ONLY is played by cheaters.  They need MORE bans, not act like they're doing something about cheating, actually make the cheaters FEAR for their accounts.  If Cheater XXX was getting auto-banned once a day, even if he was buying new accounts, it would cost $600 per month just to keep cheating."

I, for one, am not a gas camper, but feel PV is more of a camp fest than the gas. In my experience once uv got your gear and the initial wave of fighting is over you'll inevitably get killed by someone camping a cupboard or someone you're pretty sure was cheating (they tend to hang out in PV 'cos higher numbers there).  Landing over east side, north east or far south just a different set of challenges and a different combat style (far more tactical imo). It's not so much the medkits are missing it's that no-one ever goes there anymore because of the missing medkits so there's no combat.  Anyway, for those who miss the old lone pine and ranchito like myself, medkits are still in hardcore. Come play!"

h1z1,3duofx,JamesTrendall,8,Mon Jul 20 01:32:17 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure he meant on purpose.

h1z1,3duofx,KooZaa,-9,Mon Jul 20 01:37:53 2015 UTC,"It dosnt mean everyone is guilty. I believe that gives a case to dispute the charges for the game and with steam unless DBG contacted them first and they ignored the issue.    I'm a little concerned that people can get banned from games for just being associated with a cheater.    What is stopping DBG from just banning everyone named ""Shaun"" because they hate the way its spelt but ban them for playing with a cheater? Its very bad bussiness practice which i'm pretty sure will warrent people claiming refunds and contacting steam giving DBG a hard time.    Not trying to stick up for the cheaters but a little concerned about everyone else that may be playing with someone running ESP without them knowing for example."
h1z1,3duofx,JamesTrendall,5,Mon Jul 20 01:43:02 2015 UTC,Not me the least bit. Any legit right minded individual should turn their scum bag team mate in for cheating. Do this and you won't be banned.
h1z1,3duofx,Bob8D,3,Mon Jul 20 06:01:43 2015 UTC,I don't disagree with your caution. And I also don't think the mods do either. What I'm saying is they probably had good reason to group-ban those guys. The screenshot makes it seem like they had all the evidence they needed.
h1z1,3duofx,KooZaa,3,Mon Jul 20 02:00:23 2015 UTC,"It's quite easy to tell if your playing with a cheater unless they are using esp very discreetly.

If someone is cheating you'll figure it out. Plus they love to brag so... If someone knows and they don't report it then there's no sympathy to be had for them. Guilt by association yea"

PS: To all people that might come up saying ""i am not sure if i agree with this"" Please get a brain, they knew he was cheating, like he was not hiding it at all, and they knew, they talked like heroes when they killed people, suffer the consequences, no pity at all, just get REKT, hope 1 of you assholes from sector5 reads this.

I reported a group of 5-6 people in a clan, 2 of which were confirmed banned for hacking, but the rest of them were allowed to stay. They all tagged up and grouped together, so it was pretty obvious they were together. Just odd because Ive seen the clan ban thing happen a few times, but was pretty disappointed when I saw 4 of these guys still playing, and then 2 days later they got 2 more guys with different names hacking again, which were probably the same 2 that got banned. Shoulda banned the whole crew..."

Until we get GM's that we can contact as soon as we detect a cheater, and have it dealt with by the server GM""s immediately, the cheaters will just keep coming back... they know they can last x amount of time before being caught... cheaters on the server I played on, got banned a  couple of times per week, they always came back on a new account saying accounts dont cost much blaH BLAH.  IF we are not going to get GM's at least for the love of the game delete any bases and shacks they have permissions for ..... if they lost all their stuff when banned, they might be less inclined to come back so quickly"

Sometimes you don't realize they are a hacker, other times yu might be afraid to leave them because they could destroy everything you've ever made. Not all people are guilty of playing with a hacker just to ruin people's days. Some are innocent."
h1z1,3duofx,Bob8D,2,Mon Jul 20 04:28:21 2015 UTC,I don't know why but for some reason this post is hilarious.
h1z1,3duofx,JamesTrendall,2,Mon Jul 20 00:06:56 2015 UTC,"These guys all knew they were teaming with hackers. DCG banned all of them because they probably have metrics to that tell them what bases these players enter codes into, who they share space with, and generally who associates with whom, and surely have plenty of reports as well.  If you're dumb enough to not notice anything suspicious about a friend or teammate who is hacking, then you probably shouldn't be playing video games, or operating heavy machinery, or doing anything requiring deductive reasoning skills beyond the second grade.  If you know or suspect that someone you're teaming with is hacking, then report them end of story. Abetting and willful ignorance are generally serious offenses IRL; seems reasonable to expect DCG to react to that shit in a similar fashion.  I highly doubt that DCG is going to be banning every player who has made non-hostile contact with a hacker. This seems like a pretty contained instance. People who clearly are frequently teaming with hackers get banned. The average Joe who runs into a hacker once in a while does not."
h1z1,3duofx,Bob8D,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:36:25 2015 UTC,"I did say in my post that this group deserved to be banned, I'm in no way trying to defend this group. What I am saying though is that this shouldn't be a normal thing, because believe it or not people can hide their hacking very well. Not every hacker flys around spawning in thousands of guns and ammo and aimbots everyone. Some just spawn in some rounds here and there and guns every so often and get away with not really being noticed."

h1z1,3duofx,Ruknar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:05:31 2015 UTC,they were cheating as a group. One person was cheating and everyone in their clan knew it. If you allow a cheater in your clan then your whole clan is getting banned. Simple as that
h1z1,3dwmkr,Phadenz,4,Mon Jul 20 03:37:46 2015 UTC,"Cheers! This is BradC, the animator for the creatures. This is a great list..actually very close to my list...hehe. Some of these great Ideas are already in the works. I'm a big proponent of making the PVE experience as well rounded as possible. I've got a list of creatures coming that will satisfy that need a little better. The eventual goal for each creature is to be better harvested. (example: killing a deer and using the meat, the bladder, the fur, and the antlers for different things.the Whole Buffalo as they say) we're gonna get there. I just finished a chicken. The first of many farm-like animals to raise and harvest. There's some big cats coming for the more remote areas.Rest assured, we will pass this list on to the right folks and we'll do what we can to make as many of these types of things happen as best we can. Just remember, For each new system we introduce to the game(raising critters, breeding, crafting clothes from hides, etc) these all need art, code, and design support. so it's gonna take time to create and implement. One of the pitfalls of doing an Early Access is that we are literally Making the Game as people test. It's a real give and take of adding cool new stuff and fixing the broken things that come in daily. Thanks again for such a great list of cool stuff....back to the old drawing board...err...screen. Bradc!"
h1z1,3dwmkr,Bradc001,2,Mon Jul 20 14:00:16 2015 UTC,"Thats awesome to hear! I'm a really big fan of the game and definitely see how there's room for so much more! Not saying the game isn't coming along amazingly, because it is (in my opinion, of course) and I figured it wouldn't hurt to throw a few suggestions out there. I agree that allowing the player to use more of the animal (using the Whole Buffalo as they say) like you mentioned is an amazing idea, can't wait! As for the pitfalls of Early Access, I assume players understand it's part of the process and it's our way to show our support to the devs/everyone making it happen/game itself! Thanks again for the feedback!"
h1z1,3dwmkr,Sugarina,3,Mon Jul 20 14:17:31 2015 UTC,"Sounds really good. I like all your ideas, specially the trainable dogs thing. I thought maybe we could train those wolves already in the game - max one (maybe two) pet per player, or things might get silly!  I'd also like to see:   Underground Sewer System. I've seen manhole covers on the road in towns... Maybe a large underground network under Cranberry, Pleasant Valley, Ranchito and any other Major City they might add in the future.   There could be a few REALLY tough zombies that live down there, but some chance of finding very rare loots, like waist packs, etc... It could also be a bit like a maze, and very scary to go down there alone.   They could even make the sewers instanced. It could be a good way of encouraging more co-operation between players to help each other out. An underground Subway System. Similar to the sewers network, but this time set in a Subway. There could be broken down train carriages; nastier zombies; rarer loot, etc.. More character customisation. I'd like the option of darkening/lightening the skin, changing it's tone slightly. More hairstyles/colours. Ability to customise facial appearance. Choice of where you respawn on death. Maybe use a system like in Ark,  where you can build a respawn ""bed"" in your base.  Able to scavenge your own vehicle. Ability to be able to collect parts and build your own vehicle. Choice of customisation on it (speed/storage/#passengers). You would have to log in regularly to maintain this vehicle, if you failed to log in within a specific time-frame to service it, the vehicle would decay over time and finally dissappear.  Max one vehicle per player.  Generally adding more choices/recipes to do with basebuilding/crafting. Different materials, more decorative items to personalise bases inside and out. Extra food/drink recipes."
h1z1,3dwmkr,lsperandio,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:13:30 2015 UTC,"I agree, wolves are already in the game; however it would be nice if they remain the wild dog and the players are provided with one or maybe two (three would be nice, of course) domestic breeds with the ability to train. I also agree there should be a limit/max like you mentioned, one would get the job done. (in my opinion, of course)  The underground sewer system (maybe even catacombs/caves) is also a great idea! This certainly has the potential for tons of ideas, large chain quests, require players to form groups to clear and claim a section or just good old exploration! The subway system could also tie into one of these caves, so many possibilities!   I do believe I've read previous that the character model is only 30% of the devs goal and will be refined as we go, but I agree having the ability to select between an array of features would be nice.   The respawn mechanic would be interesting, however there would have  to be limits. Limitations such as, disabled in hardcore PvE servers and recipe wipe servers. This way players have the ability to play a more forgiving PvE experience or can turn up the risk factors. Basically make the ability to designate a respawn location a server condition/rule.  The ability to customize or even craft a vehicle is certainly a great idea! I can see this providing a huge time/resource sink (all MMOs have them, because it's a core part of true character progression) which personally I'm a fan of.  Generally adding more choices/recipes/crafting is certainly a great idea as well! There's always room to add cook books that players find and can learn new recipes! (quest ideas!)   Thanks again for the amazing suggestions, I hope everyone does the same and provides their feedback! It's great to see what other people come up with!"

h1z1,3dyw9d,Tallahasee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:43:31 2015 UTC,"I disagree. You are probably posting this after dying to the bombs in a top-10. I know, it can be frustrating... But there is a lesson to be learned!  Learn the bomb patterns. If you haven't already noticed, it drops in a line and this line doesn't change until there is a new air drop.  The air drop gives you a significant advantage over others (.308, medkits, etc.) so there should be more of a risk involved in looting it.  That's my theory as to why bombs currently exist.  It also makes things more interesting as it adds another threat to BR aside from Players/Gas.    It is far from 'breaking the gameplay' if you know how to avoid them.  Honestly after a few BRs you should probably never die to bombs."

h1z1,3dyqu4,FROSTSHOX,2,Mon Jul 20 16:57:38 2015 UTC,Basically you had the same thing happen to you what happen to us the other night. No Clipping.  They no clip into the shelter where there is loot and blow up the place from the inside.  How to counter this: Sleeping Mats. First put all your containers/BBQ/Furnaces down. Then fill the entire inside and outside the door with sleeping mats. They will not be able to place IEDs to blow up your base.
h1z1,3dyqu4,Drakkur,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:15:02 2015 UTC,Does it help at all to keep loot in an upper shelter?  Thanks for the sleeping bag tip.
h1z1,3dyqu4,Drakkur,2,Mon Jul 20 17:20:10 2015 UTC,"This is the base design we use: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hxCzNz-S6I  Basically impossible to raid, cheat, you name it if you liberally use sleeping mats.  Also use furnaces up top so that way you are protected while trying to open the gate that leads to the floating structure. between 2-4 of us we have collected thousands of rounds of ammo/other stuff; basically emergency stuff if our lower base gets raided (which it has by hackers)."
h1z1,3dyqu4,Faust8D,0,Mon Jul 20 18:22:42 2015 UTC,Not unraidable but would be considered difficult to a legit raider. Hackers can easily take out those bases though. Had a similar one (but way better) and it was hacked when he flew up top taking out the door and noclipping through the gate blocking the door way (sleeping mats on the roof is just a deterrent but definitely doesn't make it impossible). I now use a different design that I came up with and it's truly unraidable (legit players & hackers). Waiting on the day to see it being used or someone posting it up.
h1z1,3dyqu4,Drakkur,2,Mon Jul 20 18:49:08 2015 UTC,"The one I linked is unraidable for legit players, that is a fact. If you can state the method to the contrary then I would be inclined to test it and prove it. Otherwise it is just BS talk."
h1z1,3dyqu4,Faust8D,0,Mon Jul 20 19:51:33 2015 UTC,"The base you linked is not unraidable to legit players. The large shelter can be blown and the items looted by standing on a car. However, this base: http://imgur.com/a/iZhpg#9AybY7J is truly unraidable from legit players outside of the small percentage chance that they manage to produce a 25+ man world war z stack. This unraidable base owned by me was in fact raided by a hacker.   Secondly, my latest base design is much different and doesn't look anything like the sorts... and truly is unraidable rather you want to believe it or not. I'm the original designer of unraidable bases well before it was patched and warned the development team of their pending conception before the patch. When the design finally becomes known than I will be glad to let you know (gladly marked a reminder for you) that I told you so son. Until that day I will be reaping the fruits of my labor. =)"

Once someone starts chasing, you have to be quick, and try to let them think they know where you are running to. I run by bears, wolves, zombie hordes, and even into Cranburry or Pleasant Valley. Let the other things in the game distract the player.   We've upgraded our looting when we have others on. We have people camped out in bushes or behind a car.

It may seem mindless to you, but believe me, there are people in this game who get a kick out of killing anyone, geared or not.  Also, the chance for them to rage through voice chat can often lead to hilarity.  It's not necessarily a 'waste of time and resources' if they find enjoyment out of it.  Also consider that these KOS group likely have endless amounts of ammo, so wasting a few bullets really isn't noticed.   Edit - To add to this: Some people also just run out of things to do. They've built a base, they have an ENDLESS amount of guns/gear/ammo.. They have friends.. then they run out of things to do so they literally go on a murder-spree"

Â  Here is some info regarding giving a Empty Bottle back when refueling:     I tried to set up the fuel to return a bottle but the problem is, the vehicle is being targeted so it is trying to give it to the car and it is failing. Going to look into some different method for returning the fuel, but it likely won't make it in this week.   /r/h1z1/comments/383l02/view/crs107c  Â  And insight as to why they only have the one type of bottle currently:     We chose to keep it at one bottle for simplicity for now. Otherwise people would want to fill up gas cans with water which would double all the recipes that use water. Our recipes currently look for specific items, rather than an item class. I like it for realism, but I hate it for data bloat. If/when we move to item classes or groups we can do this.   /r/h1z1/comments/383l02/view/crs1rce  Â  Hopefully they will work on this and we could see multiple containers! :)"

DayZ Mod with Battleye and Server Admins did a pretty good job of keeping the cheaters out.  It was very very few and far between that I thought someone was cheating.

Many more weapons to choose from and the entire gun and weapon system is more realistic in nature.   Just as an example, you can catch diseases from drinking dirty water or you have gun attachments and fire mode selectors.  It does not have a base building mechanic, only Tents with storage.  H1Z1 is dumbed down majorly in every way except base building in comparison to Dayz, It's only other big redeeming factor is it's user interface and controls are not nearly as clunky as dayz.  The main reason I don't play Dayz right now is it's just too damn clunky controls/UI wise.  The zombies are glitchy garbage just like in H1Z1 as well.  Honestly, both H1Z1 and Dayz need years of work still before they are considered good games.  Infestation doesn't even need to be mentioned, it's complete shit."

Could have been some broken features or something, but I liked it. I'm waiting for the fully dynamic wellness (weather, seasons, illnesses etc) system. There has been so many weapons / grenades / armour / br additions, which is nice, but can anyone tell me what, in terms of survival, has been added?

h1z1,3dui3u,Quigleyer,6,Mon Jul 20 03:44:16 2015 UTC,"No offense or ill will intended- but people ran around with wooden bows and were scared of gunshots.  There were not many guns in the game, they were a real treasure.  You could hold people up if you had a gun because there was a good chance the player you were holding up did not find one yet.  If they had a gun maybe they didn't have ammo- that was a common situation.  Now there are guns in the game.  EVERYWHERE.  And now people just shoot each other, run towards gun shots to get a piece of the action, and hold-ups quickly turn violent because... well, everyone's packing.  And you're telling me there's no correlation?  It's all due to the newness of the game, has nothing to do with the VERY increased gun, ammo, and food spawns from what was present at launch?    How come I can play Project: Zomboid and never lose that feeling in my stomach that something bad is about to happen?  I've got a LOT of hours into that game- never gets any less threatening.  When I first started playing this game I left my guns at home- they were too valuable to just carry around!  Fast forward a few months and we have so many firearms we're LITERALLY melting them down into metal.  You don't think that's indicative of over-supply?"
h1z1,3dui3u,HaniiBlu,-4,Sun Jul 19 16:44:20 2015 UTC,"The problem is your own expectations of what this game should be, this game's timeline is set a few weeks after the outbreak, so weapons, ammo food etc would still be pretty plentiful.    But at the same time, this game is far from finished and balance is way off, things like vehicles, backpacks and footware are far too rare.  Â  This is NOT a primitive survival game, this is modern world, guns are king.  Also, this game is NOT set decades after the outbreak where processed food, weapons and ammo would be a lot more damages or rare."
h1z1,3dui3u,Quigleyer,3,Sun Jul 19 17:11:47 2015 UTC,"No my issues are all gameplay related.  I have no qualms with ""unrealistic"" numbers of guns if it makes the game a better experience.  None of your points are remotely close to things I care about.  You're side-tracking this discussion with points that don't have to do with my original argument, which all stemmed from gameplay issues with the deathmatch style of play.  We're not talking hypothetical situations here- we're talking about things that ACTUALLY happened and were changed.  The gameplay experience for those of us with like-minds is that it is less enjoyable."
h1z1,3dui3u,HaniiBlu,-1,Sun Jul 19 17:43:02 2015 UTC,Then why complain about guns being in the game if your issue is not about guns being in the game?
h1z1,3dui3u,Quigleyer,4,Sun Jul 19 18:25:00 2015 UTC,"My post specifically says ""unrealistic"" numbers of guns I don't care about.  I don't care about how plausible the gun count is, I don't care about how many there ""should be"".  I'm talking about gameplay.  Gameplay.  The experience of playing the game, and how I feel guns in every third house is detracting from that.  I'm almost positive this is something I explained in the first sentence of the post you replied to- are you trolling me?  Like I said there are so many guns we're LITERALLY melting them down.  EVERYONE has a gun."
h1z1,3dui3u,HaniiBlu,-1,Sun Jul 19 18:27:20 2015 UTC,"What server are you on? Because out of the 3-4 PVP servers I play on, guns are not as abundant as you describe..."
h1z1,3dui3u,Quigleyer,4,Sun Jul 19 18:29:55 2015 UTC,"Doomsday, Grimwood, Alastor, and another B one (Bloodscorn?  might be right).  Haven't played in a few weeks, but no patch notes mentioned gun spawns (I mean, except that there are now MORE types of guns... lol) so I think I can safely assume it's no different.  Every server I play on this game everyone has guns.  You don't find guns everywhere?  They're EVERYWHERE.  I'm estimating every 3 or 4 houses has 1 gun and ammo is A) easy to convert and B) also everywhere.  I mean if I spawn in I can get decently geared with guns and ammo in one or two settlements, depending on their size.  This game is a deathmatch."
h1z1,3dui3u,HaniiBlu,-1,Sun Jul 19 18:38:37 2015 UTC,"This game is a deathmatch.     So is every other survival game on high pop public servers. DayZ, ARK, Rust, Miscreated are all basically deathmatch on popular public servers. Is this your fist multiplayer PVP survival game?"
h1z1,3dui3u,Quigleyer,2,Sun Jul 19 18:46:10 2015 UTC,"Project Zomboid is not, 7 Days to die is not.    No, not by far my first experience.  But this was my first experience in a survival game that, for a time, actually felt difficult and like survival was the key aspect.  Then they changed it.  You seem to be forgetting the game did not start like this, it was changed to this through increasing of gun spawns, more loot, etc."
h1z1,3dui3u,xSergis,3,Sun Jul 19 18:52:04 2015 UTC,"visit those fancy new military checkpoints sometime  playing on abomination, every time there is 1-3 guns  also if you hang around the same area, ammo and guns just keep respawning long after you have more than you'll ever have a use for"
h1z1,3dui3u,Quigleyer,3,Sun Jul 19 18:54:30 2015 UTC,"Come to think of it- the last few map additions were kinda like this:  Cranberry PD- go to get guns and ammo  Military check points- go to get guns and ammo  Dam- go to get guns and ammo... in a hydro electric dam (lol, why there?)"
h1z1,3dui3u,xSergis,3,Sun Jul 19 18:56:49 2015 UTC,soon we'll get a hospital... to go get guns and ammo

h1z1,3dui3u,HaniiBlu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:22:54 2015 UTC,"This tells me then, that weapon spawns are directly related to population numbers.  I only play on one high pop server, but rarely, the others are mostly low and one hits medium sometimes. Â  But if you play on high pop PVP you're basically choosing to play deathmatch... high pop pretty much guarantees at least 2 people every km2 Â  As I see it, high pop is NOT a true apocalyptic survival experience, 200 people in a 64km2 area, very easily rebuild society at that point lol.."
h1z1,3dui3u,xSergis,3,Mon Jul 20 18:00:24 2015 UTC,"returning to the point of this thread, high pop used to be choosing interactions with people, not deathmatch  micspam parties, roleplays, just teaming up, now every newspawn area has a bunch of bases and a bunch of gunners just waiting for fresh target practice  shit was fun 100%, now 90% of the time it's just a generic arcade shooter with bases"

h1z1,3dxsuv,Buckmagoo,3,Mon Jul 20 12:27:10 2015 UTC,"well bases aren't over powered... it a zombie apocalypse what would you expect. you put hours of time in your base to make it harder to get raided... ive put 20+ plus into my base and i still add stuff to my farm bases and many other things, and i am on a med pop server. So its not the easiest thing in the world to do with people always running around.  if you put hours into a base then it should take you hours to gather the resources to break in."
h1z1,3dxsuv,Hardlin3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:30:30 2015 UTC,"Yes but a survival game on a pvp server should be about player vs player  interaction..not base building, that's what the pve servers are for"
h1z1,3dxsuv,TalonHere,2,Mon Jul 20 15:41:29 2015 UTC,"You are confusing PvP with survival.  PvP, Are things like Battle Royale, where the entire point is to kill the other players.  A survival server with PvP enabled, the point is surviving. The only difference now, is that players are an active thing to be wary of. Bases are a key part of surviving long term. They protect your loot from the threat of other players.  There is no reason base building shouldn't be an important part of Survival mode."
h1z1,3dxsuv,Hardlin3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:07:55 2015 UTC,"I don't agree at all. The best part of a survival game is player vs player interaction, having to be out in the world to find materials (food, bandages and such) to survive is what makes it fun. I think base building ruins that a bit.  I think base building is a cool concept and should belong (to a certain degree) in survival games but I feel that this has gone way to far when all cars are hidden inside bases, most players hide inside their bases and if they die it doesn't really matter because they are so stocked up inside their base so dying doesn't really matter."
h1z1,3dxsuv,ShamblingDead,-2,Mon Jul 20 16:53:09 2015 UTC,only way i see you getting enjoyment out of the game since you believe bases being over powered is buying hacks. or finding and making an alliance with alot of people. you're always stronger in numbers.
h1z1,3dxsuv,anthson,3,Mon Jul 20 12:32:38 2015 UTC,"To answer your question, there is a way to raid bases that doesn't take hours. Using ieds to blow open gates actually barely takes minutes let alone hours. With practice you can be in and out of a base with all of their loot in less than 5 mins. Now the preparation for the raid, that's what takes hours. Each ied requires a fertilizer, charcoal, metal sheet, metal shard, and scrap of cloth. Farming the materials to make 80-100 ieds for a good base raid can and should take days. It wouldn't be balanced if it took you a week to build up a base and loot enough junk to survive and I could take it all away with 5 minutes of work."
h1z1,3dxsuv,ShamblingDead,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:46:24 2015 UTC,"Farming the materials to make 80-100 ieds for a good base raid can and should take days.   In my group, two of us can have about a hundred IEDs in around two hours."
h1z1,3dxsuv,anthson,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:43:27 2015 UTC,"But in that same amount of time you could have a decent base built instead. My point was that the time devoted to farming materials for ieds, scouting out a base to raid, and raiding that base should take an equal amount of time as it takes the owner of that base to build everything."
h1z1,3dxsuv,ShamblingDead,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:47:52 2015 UTC,"Except it doesn't. I have a triple-gate base completely roofed in with a grenade-proof garage and more metal doors than I guarantee anyone has time or explosives for. It took me hours and hours of grinding scrap, probably 800 scrap total, to get it up.  To reach my vault, you'd have to blow 80 or so IEDs on the three gates, then another 10 on the metal door before you're finally at my chests. Assuming you know exactly which doors/gates to blow, you'll get in using far less effort than it took to put the place up.  I've raided quite a few bases and most don't have anything more than an outer gate and a few inner doors."
h1z1,3dxsuv,Hardlin3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:55:41 2015 UTC,"The issue with the comparison you're making is that I'm not leveling your entire base, just gates and doors, and I'm taking your loot. Therefore the comparison would be the amount of time it would take for you to gather the materials to replace the gates/doors I blow up and the loot I take. The loot is the only wildcard in the equation because if you put every single item you've ever gathered into one shelter than I will come out ahead, if you spread out your gear it will probably be a wash, but if you log off with the stuff I want (ammo and fertilizer) then you have made me expend more time (assets) then I have gained."

Sorry to say you're just not getting more interest from us over here because you didn't teabag that guy or humiliate him in some way to show your superiority.  I really liked your video, the other guy in the video was also a good sport.  Did he give you that hunting rifle after he shot at you?  That's awesome.  And you didn't backstab him afterwards?

These people won't be happy unless they're dying 12 seconds before they even log in. They want the last food on the map to have been edible 27 years before the story of H1Z1 and the water to infect your computer with a virus that distributes all your pr0n to various Sesame Street forums on the net if you drink it and transfers all your financial information to 4 chan.

When I tried dayz i hated it, it was way too hard to survive. h1z1 on the other hand has the req to survive to a minimal which i love. Me and friends play and it reminds us of ultima online in the late 90s. We have our base. We gather stuff and try to get player interaction.  I think if they added more player interaction other than just killing each other the game would be even better(trading, currency, more quests, more zombies etc).  Having said that, they should also make servers that are hardcore survival for people like you who want that."

I was conducting a raid last night on a shack that was in a fairly isolated area. There were zero zombies around when I first arrived and the whole time I was checking out the shack. The second the first ied went off at the door I could see all the far away zombies begin to head my way. Within a minute (with several more ieds being set off during that minute) I had at least 15-20 zombies on the scene. They are easy to kill and not much of a threat, but they do react to noise."

I chop down a tree and obviously it makes a lot of noise, even shakes the ground... suddenly all zombies on a 1 mile radius start running towards me. Felt pretty damn good! Amazing.   But yeah, it's bugged, it doesn't work as it should... Running or crouching, no difference in sound."

I have a base right near Rancho Taquito and sometimes there's 50 or more Zeds right outside my base.  I've been killed by the mob exactly once, thanks to Windows Sticky Keys dropping me to desktop, where I got surrounded and devoured.  Otherwise, the Zeds are not really a threat.  The hackers on the other hand are another problem entirely.  I play maybe 2-3 hours per day, and get killed legit by another player every other day or so.  I get killed pretty regularly by guys flying around, ESPing and running out into the forest to kill me, guys clipping into my base through the foundation or through the cracks in the gates."

I would love more player to player interaction without the fear of death. But, it is what it is. I remain friendly, until thats clearly not working.   It sucks for those people who aren't used to playing the COD/HaLo/BattleField type games. This game is sooo much simpler and easier to use, and for those of us who are COD/Halo fans.

h1z1,3dxneu,TenderHeartOwns,2,Mon Jul 20 12:41:49 2015 UTC,"The idea would be that YOU creat the groups and YOU place the items in there  For ex: you want to look like a sexy american, so you would make a group called 'Murica and put in the pants, gloves, and bandanna for it."
h1z1,3dtvcv,Octopus01,12,Sun Jul 19 12:21:51 2015 UTC,"Without BR, (not created by daybreak, but by Playerunknown as a mod for A3) h1z1 would be so empty of content.   Give it a few years and every game will have it's own version of BR, so unless they start working on THEIR game they'll be overtaken by games that do have much more than just BR."
h1z1,3dtvcv,GwinnyWinny,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:55:27 2015 UTC,"Survival mode will never have that competative edge of Battle Royale. Survival is about exploring stuff and random encounters, so it will be interesting for a much longer time when they expand the map and the loot."

h1z1,3dtvcv,TenderHeartOwns,6,Mon Jul 20 13:16:10 2015 UTC,"+1, the first 2 months where the best! by far! right now we build our base 3/4 in 2 days and said yep this is boring we got everything right now. Looting new guns was just more metal ... seeing other people everywhere and only guns guns and guns. zombies who cares! their AI is so easy being alone on the server makes zombies harder. Food has no need its so easy, same for water. the only think i did when we decided to play h1z1 again was build a base. After this there was nothing. BTW yep i play ark right now too the survival is so much better it just amazing! would love to see some survival features from ark into h1z1."
h1z1,3dtvcv,Khornath,4,Sun Jul 19 16:21:07 2015 UTC,"When people day they want harder zombies, what do they mean. Cause there was a bug where zombies took 2 headshots to kill and people went insane over it. Also the zombies already run. I'm just not sure what ""harder"" zombies means. People complain about a ton of unrealistic zombie spawning and the complain about hardly and zombies. I'm seriously curious here. The thing about any game is it can't be made for everyone. Fort people like you how the 30 minds of running and hiding is boring in a br, believe it out not is fun for others. I too have stopped playing h1z1 to go okay ark for a bit but I know that it's still s great game that's cone a long way. They're adding tons of things and there's lots to come but they can only do so much before going back and bug fixing things, changing features according to public opinion and whatnot...."
h1z1,3dtvcv,Melk73,2,Sun Jul 19 15:59:44 2015 UTC,I'm seriously curious here. The thing about any game is it can't be made for everyone   that why rule sets exists.
h1z1,3dtvcv,DallaEllune,2,Sun Jul 19 23:51:32 2015 UTC,"What ppl mean when they say they want harder zombies? Well for starter at least 3 times more zombies than there is in a PVP server, smarter AI, make them a real threat. Zombies dont even react to sound properly... Shooting a gun should be a last resort thing in a zombie game the sound should attract lots of zombies.  Truth is Zombie AI in H1Z1 sucks really bad. Zombies dont react properly like 90% of the time."
h1z1,3dtvcv,Bl1ndVe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:01:00 2015 UTC,Yeah I'd have to agree. Zombies reacting to sound should be a bigger part of the game
h1z1,3dtvcv,Melk73,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:11:51 2015 UTC,Watch the Walking Dead and you have your answer. That is what the majority wants with the zombies. We don't want mutants or anything of the likes coming straight out of temporary arcade shooters like l4d. We just want the zombies that exist in the Walking Dead. Simple concept.
h1z1,3dtvcv,Faust8D,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:26:51 2015 UTC,"I mostly agree, but zombies from walking dead don't really pose a threat if they were placed in a game. They're a lot slower and easier to kill."
h1z1,3dtvcv,Melk73,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:49:34 2015 UTC,"Are you going to tell me that if they actually fixed physical limitations on players (limitless stamina from running), zombie AI (physics & proper heat mapping), make zombies head shot only, etc... just like from Walking Dead that they are not going to be a threat? If that is the case... doesn't sound like you are looking for a zombie survival horror game and something else."
h1z1,3dtvcv,Faust8D,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:51:05 2015 UTC,All I'm saying is that what's good in atv series and what's good in a game isn't always the same thing. Zombies in walking dead can go faster than a walk and are so stupid they impale themselves. Nor do I want that mutant lfd2 crap. I would say they're okay now but they need their spawning and sound recognition changed. Zombies are only a threat in large numbers which doesn't really happen much in this game.
h1z1,3dtvcv,Melk73,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:11:55 2015 UTC,Think the walking dead. That's what I want atleast. A game that feels like that series (survival-wise).
h1z1,3dtvcv,AndrewRO,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:19:00 2015 UTC,Okay so not the difficulty of the zombies but their spawning? Like roaming heards and zombies that spawn in houses
h1z1,3dtvcv,Melk73,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:28:51 2015 UTC,There is more to it than that. No one can sit there and tell me with a straight face that these zombies and their AI function like a zombie from the Walking Dead. lol
h1z1,3dtvcv,Faust8D,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:28:23 2015 UTC,And I wouldn't try that either because I don't think that's true.
h1z1,3dtvcv,Melk73,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:48:38 2015 UTC,"What would you try? What, retarded mutants from L4D and Resident Evil making it just like every other zombie hack wannabe game that is in reality nothing but a mutant game instead?"
h1z1,3dtvcv,Faust8D,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:51:55 2015 UTC,No as in I wouldn't try to tell you they function like ones from walking dead cause they don't. Imo their problem is lack of response to sound and spawning locations/ amount
h1z1,3dtvcv,Melk73,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:06:02 2015 UTC,"Oh, didn't really understand your response. Sounded like you said that you wouldn't try to make them that way, as if making them differently would be better.   The problems are enormous.   Sound response Sight response Proper heat mapping Head shot only should be on ALL servers No way to hit a person when running Needs better grappling abilities Bites should matter, virus is pointless to a degree Hordes/herds are practically non-existent More zombies   The list could extend for miles. =/"
h1z1,3dtvcv,Faust8D,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:08:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I wasn't really saying the zombies are good, just that people just keep saying they suck and don't give descriptions on what they want."

h1z1,3dtvcv,wopawien,8,Mon Jul 20 08:28:24 2015 UTC,"FYI to OP: There are hackers in ARK, difference is since you can have your own private server you can simply ban them or place a password on your server ( which is what many people do ).   Imho H1Z1 is easily 2 to 3 years out before it can be deemed release ready at their current pace. Not to say I'm not enjoying it atm, but unfortunately many of the critiques against it when compared to ARK are valid. That game, which I also play, is not only graphically superior, but also seems to have significantly more dev support."
h1z1,3dtvcv,OldCuban,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:20:26 2015 UTC,"Ark does have hackers, but they are few and far between, especially on official servers.   This is because the Devs are very quick with bans if you have concrete evidence, and the hacks are much harder to find/buy. (I know this because a Dev offered a cash reward if you could find a site where you could download a hack for Ark.   Every game has hackers, some just have more than others."
h1z1,3dtvcv,finnay1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:55:24 2015 UTC,Don't know what fantasy world you are living in... hacks are easier to get for that game now than it is for any of the other survival titles including h1z1. Clearly you don't frequent the other side very often.
h1z1,3dtvcv,Faust8D,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:30:19 2015 UTC,"Im not sure what you're trying to convince me of, I told you I did a search myself and couldn't find many hacks.  Of course there is ESP out there, as there is for nearly every other game. But there are no fly hacks, god mode, noclip, or magic hands for Ark. Also, the same sites that host hacks for Ark, almost always host H1 hacks. Saying that Ark hacks are easier to find is just a blatant lie."
h1z1,3dtvcv,finnay1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:28:30 2015 UTC,"But there are no fly hacks, god mode, noclip, or magic hands for Ark. - finnay1   Wrong, straight up from a hack site that has had these hacks out since the first week of ARK's release.    Our ARK Survival Evolved Hack includes Aimbot, God-Mode, 3D/2D Radar shows Players, Animals and Items. It works on multi-player in all servers and in a local game. - Gaming Hack Site   Hacking is so bad in ARK right now that they are offering $200 bounties to help combat it.  http://steamcommunity.com/app/346110/discussions/0/523890046867909905/  How about we look at some cheats that took all but 30 seconds to find that are available in ARK right now?

I frequent all the popular hack sites on a constant basis. Finding hacks for ARK is so much easier to obtain than H1Z1 now days. The majority of the programmers have moved to that game due to its popularity and left H1Z1 in the ruins that it caused to the game. ARK will follow in suit, but will still be the terribly optimized piece of crap that it is and still have the same hacks available like in all other games."
h1z1,3dtvcv,Faust8D,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:23:09 2015 UTC,"Well, I was wrong about the hack sites, sorry. If that site does host those legitimate cheats, your should report it for the reward.  I disagree that the hacking in Ark will bring the game to an unplayable state as it did to H1, but we will see I suppose.   In my opinion, the Ark Dev team is much more productive and responsive when issues like this come up, so the hacking problem may be short lived."
h1z1,3dtvcv,finnay1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:45:24 2015 UTC,Given the fact that they are hiring and outsourcing a company to help them combat optimization issues (h1z1 hasn't even done that)... doesn't make me believe their devs are quite reliable or competent in terms of developmental issues. The engine allows them to easily make modest changes that amateur developers could accomplish. When it comes to the significantly difficult modifications ARK will fall behind badly unless they keep forking the money out to the experts time after time but let's see how long a company will last under those conditions.   ARK is clearly in its early flavor of the month hype period just like all the other survival games that went through the same phase. Only a matter of time until that roller coaster comes crashing down from the peak. At least H1Z1 developers have the experience to make the difficult changes unlike those working on ARK.
h1z1,3dtvcv,Faust8D,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:59:59 2015 UTC,"There isn't any evidence suggesting the developers of Ark can't make larger, more difficult changes. The H1 devs only started issuing bans on a large scale long after hackers had been active.  Hackers have just become precedent in Ark, so we can't really say how they are going to handle the situation yet."
h1z1,3dtvcv,finnay1,0,Mon Jul 20 19:20:30 2015 UTC,"Who doesn't reach out to a GUI company to only add ""special effects"" after struggling with such terrible optimization issues, right? lol   http://www.develop-online.net/press-releases/studio-wildcard-enlists-nvidia-gameworks-to-add-visual-effects-to-ark-survival-evolved/0207276"

h1z1,3dtvcv,OldCuban,10,Sun Jul 19 16:03:29 2015 UTC,"I actually have two opinions on this subject. My first opinion as to it not being a zombie survival is that my impression when I heard about this game was that it was a survival game that just happened to be based around zombies. It is that. There are many things you have to survive against though, with zombies just being one of them. You also must survive against hunger, thirst, wolves, bears, and of course PLAYERS. That fact doesn't make it any less of a survival game. I won't speak for anyone else, but I would find it very boring if the only thing you had to survive against were NPCs of any sorts. No matter how well they program AI, it will never be as challenging as surviving against other thinking humans. Zombies, by tradition, are less threatening because they tend to be dumb. We can look at what is arguable the current best example of zombie lore, the walking dead. In the comics (and even in the show) zombies haven't been a real threat in a long time, it's other people you have to fear.   The second issue is the plethora of guns and ammo. I realize that many don't like this, and that's a legitimate complaint. The easiest solution would be to take 5 or 6 low pop servers and convert them to a limited guns and ammo spawn server, NOT to change the game for everyone. I believe that a viable option until this happens is to just play on the lowest of the low pop servers (typically hardcore pvp server). Although there isn't less guns/ammo, you can generally play for days without seeing another player. The zombies are also far more relevant on these servers and can and will kill you if you gather too many and then stop for any reason (to loot or bandage for example).  Just my opinions on the matter."
h1z1,3dtvcv,ShamblingDead,3,Sun Jul 19 13:18:31 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree on hunger and thirst. it's easy to get food and water. Correct me if i am wrong. But i have 20 bottles, and rabbit meat in half an hour."
h1z1,3dtvcv,Salelesa,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:21:28 2015 UTC,"This can be tricky on a public server though. Or when they have full balance at release. With a larger map you could spawn in a tundra biome and there's no berries. That means racing time. Or a desert where you've gotta sacrifice hydration to get out. There are a lot more possible elements when you think about the ""end"" result. I say with quotes because it'll always get new content and cosmetics even after release."
h1z1,3dtvcv,PhazePyre,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:23:11 2015 UTC,"You can always ""/respawn""and get out of that biome si it will not change a thing. I would really love the idea of the survival..but I don't see it coming in this game very soon. Also a Countdown Timer should be added from '/respawn"" to ""/respawn"" so people would be forced to play on the area they are respawned rather than spamming the command and respawn only on their preffered places."
h1z1,3dtvcv,Desthro,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:42:56 2015 UTC,I personally think they should remove /respawn.
h1z1,3dtvcv,PhazePyre,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:02:26 2015 UTC,"I agree, takes a lot of fine tuning to balance this out. We shall wait and see. I hope for the best"
h1z1,3dtvcv,Salelesa,0,Mon Jul 20 15:37:00 2015 UTC,"You can disagree if you like, but since it's something that can kill you technically, you're surviving against it. It's just that it's something that is extremely easy to survive against right now. Blackberries are everywhere and water bottles and steaks are easy to come by. It is a system they can tweek later though and turn it up a few notches to make it become a real factor in living from day to day.  Edit: after rereading this post I want to explain my first line in the answer I gave you. It came off as confrontational and that wasn't my intent. I was saying you can disagree and would have a valid point, but in my mind anything that can kill you I consider having to survive against. Hope you didn't take that the wrong way."
h1z1,3dtvcv,ShamblingDead,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:24:45 2015 UTC,"I didn't take it the wrong way, i get you.  No worries mate.   But as you said its to easy to survive against.   For me core of survival should really be fighting for food, water, and shelter. its really easy to accomplish all of those."
h1z1,3dtvcv,Salelesa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:08:22 2015 UTC,"While I agree with you, some may not like that part of survival so it's a tough job for the devs to walk that tightrope. I would say that since the hunger and thirst system is at least in place, they can now fine tune it (either for core game or on special servers). Imagine a server call day after tomorrow (or something like that) that is set not weeks or months after the outbreak, but years. Now since so much time has passed the above ground water is all contaminated with H1Z1 virus so we can only drink from the wells that are in the game. Imagine that all animals are now infected also, so you can no longer eat their meat (canned food and MREs are the only useful food source). They could even tie in the professions and say that only a certain profession can make the water that doesn't come from a well safe. Only a different profession can make animal meat safe to eat. Maybe even only a certain 3rd type of profession can build a base above a basic shack. If they implemented all of that into a special server I think that would've more what you want.  It's all there for them to use, they just need to decide to do it."
h1z1,3dtvcv,ShamblingDead,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:55:08 2015 UTC,"If we are already creating a hardcore server, why don't we remove healing with bandages and first aid kit.  Bandage could stop Minor Bleeding, First aid would stop any bleeding .  And good Hunger and hydration could regen health.   Its kinda dull that i can regain my health with bandages, while i am hungry and dehydrated."
h1z1,3dtvcv,Salelesa,2,Mon Jul 20 15:35:44 2015 UTC,how many devs were cutback on the daybreak acquisition? how many actual devs are on project now? When was the last time someone from Daybreak streamed this game?  Why are they charging money on a Early Release game for keys and item boxes and still charging a one time purchase fee. Is this greedy?  where is the free to play model at supported by cosmectic purchases if your already employing that model in an early access game.
h1z1,3dtvcv,LemonKurenai,3,Sun Jul 19 19:43:41 2015 UTC,"I agree with you partly, but in H1 your not really surviving against hunger and hydration. The rates are slow to decrease and if you are close to any town you never have to worry about hunger.  I think that surviving against these things means that you actively need to be thinking about your supply of food/ water."
h1z1,3dtvcv,finnay1,2,Sun Jul 19 17:59:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but if they are too fast, you are better off playing progress quest for a more authentic progress bar experience.  Constantly eating and drinking is not fun."
h1z1,3dtvcv,RoyAwesome,2,Sun Jul 19 19:40:54 2015 UTC,"I didn't really mean constantly eating and drinking, I meant that you always have to be wondering how your gonna get food and water, especially when you move around the map.   In ark for example, if you move around the map food and water will become more or less accessible, forcing you to problem solve.   In h1 there is either a well, river, or hearty supply of bottled water somewhere near you, along with packaged food."
h1z1,3dtvcv,finnay1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:03:12 2015 UTC,I complete agree with you.Here is a post that combines many top voted suggestions from redditors on how to make the game more real survival game and also make it harder.

What people dont realize, when you take those 5 or 6 servers and make the guns spawn less, they will all be low pops just like the current First person and hardcore servers. Then they will come back and complain that they dont ever see anyone."

h1z1,3dtvcv,ShamblingDead,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:27:15 2015 UTC,Same but the only way they can manage doing that is by giving people the ability to host their own servers and change the rules. Which I think they should do as well as host their own servers.

What about tweaking biomes and weather?  DBG needs to get it together. Is Clegg the only game designer left? The reason Ark's CCUs are so high is because their game designers are amazing. Make a good survival game and the players will come back.
h1z1,3dtvcv,darkscyde,2,Sun Jul 19 14:57:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah.. I would come back to consistently play h1z1 if they added the things they said they were going to. Like pets, horses (would be amazing on a primitive server), and especially if they made fortifying existing buildings actually useful."

I can't find an actual dev quote where they say it, but if you just Google h1z1 horses there's plenty of sites saying it is (was) a confirmed feature, I'm pretty sure confirmed during a stream, but I could be wrong. Later when asked about horses more recently during a stream, they said they no longer planned to add them but to ""never say never"". :/"

I reckon these were as follows: weather from the get go (with snow, until pulled), even seasons. Biomes added later on. There's a whole lot he doesn't mention that people were expecting though in addition to things like his first point of fortifying existing buildings, which was a very exciting feature. I'm sure they're still on the priority list somewhere not very high, but it should be talked about imo. EDIT: stupid mistakes and tired tired tired"

Skins, some bullshit military post that could've taken 2 weeks, same models, etc. That does nothing to gameplay. I call that fluff.

h1z1,3dtvcv,Johnny_Bigshot,3,Sun Jul 19 16:45:48 2015 UTC,"I think people are forgetting how many people have already interpreted the zombie apocalypse through games, novels or movies. Often times the zombies aren't the ""real"" threat"", it is usually other people or a mix of it all.   I think the game is in an awesome spot at the moment and once they tweak the spawns a little, after they are finished testing most of the items, i think this game will be a perfect Zombie Survival Mmo. Just because interaction in this game isnt the same as other mmos doesn't mean that is bad. It just means that you have to approach playing this game differently than WoW or Eso"
h1z1,3dtvcv,mmosb4hoes,2,Mon Jul 20 07:16:01 2015 UTC,"If you dont think they have made significant progress in this game you are crazy, go here and look at the patch notes from the start.  http://survivorsrest.com/patchnotes/"
h1z1,3dtvcv,africanjesus,2,Sun Jul 19 16:02:21 2015 UTC,"This game is a survival game forsure, there are a lot of things to survive and especially trying to solo or duo grab scrap metal from big cities.                   lol @ ark."

h1z1,3dtvcv,thegooorooo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:22:53 2015 UTC,"I agree that there isn't much external threat, but that doesn't make it not a survival game. They should add 3x the zombies and I'd prefer a headshot only server that wasn't first person only as well. I also hope that once they actually get the HUD working properly, that they will make it so you get thirsty and hungry faster. Like, if I haven't eaten some chicken or steak at least twice in a day then I should be really hungry.                       I'd play this game all day over Ark, especially with the complete lack of optimization and the memory leaks. I can play H1Z1 for hours on end with no frame dip. There is definitely a lot of potential for a quality zombie survival game."
h1z1,3dtvcv,Riposte_This,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:56:02 2015 UTC,"well, it seems more of a shooter than a survival game. It didnt seem this way back in the earlier days of the game. Seems as time progresses each update it gets easier and easier to survive and get armed up. It should take more than 10 mins to get fully geared up."
h1z1,3dtvcv,thegooorooo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:47:31 2015 UTC,"hmm, ya I can agree with it being a little too easy to gear up, one cabin area had literally 2 or 3 re-curve bows in every cabin. I think they should have more ""hardcore"" servers. Less weapons, lose hydration and energy faster, more zombies, etc. I can understand from their point that an ""easier"" server help bring in more players, because lets face it, the hardcore player is a minority when it comes to gaming these days. WildStar was a perfect example of that."
h1z1,3dtvcv,Riposte_This,2,Mon Jul 20 13:51:38 2015 UTC,"My only gripe (apart from obvious bugs) is that guns, rifles and ammo is way too easy to find, and lots of it. It should be a little scarce (not too much), also random spawn locations needed all over the map (also this for cars, batteries and spark plugs. Hate the fact after a wipe everyone knows where everything is and hordes it)."

h1z1,3dtvcv,Bananastomp,2,Mon Jul 20 07:36:35 2015 UTC,"My opinion is that they need to test everything they are putting into the game and if everyone is worried about where they get food and water 90% of the time they can't test the rest of the game. If guns/ammo are super rare, then players can't test guns/ammo.  My opinion is that survival can entail a lot of different things and many players in this community try to trap it in the hole of previous survival games. Special servers will resolve this in the future, but IMO it is not needed now. This build is for testing, playing, and making some easy cash. Many people seem mistaken a about this and worry about launch. Don't. Let the devs worry about it, it's actually their job. Play the game, test the game, write comments on how you think it should go, but everyone needs to stop acting like they are the experts, they know best, they could design a better game. They could do this and do that. Every day it's the same thing in this reddit and because of it I am starting to feel like the odd man out, simply because I have common sense, I don't jump to conclusions, and am under no false illusions that I know what is best for this game."
h1z1,3dtvcv,prncedrk,3,Mon Jul 20 12:43:25 2015 UTC,"People of reddit will never understand patience they have to have all of this now! This game has a lot to offer and it will have a survival aspect to it in time, but comparing H1Z1 to other games they are doing a great job, sometimes dayz makes you wait a month or more for an update I quit over that, and im not comparing H1Z1 to any premade engine games such as ARK they have it far easier than H1Z1 to add shit in and for it to work but they will be forever limited"
h1z1,3dtvcv,WhitenineOne,2,Sun Jul 19 13:14:13 2015 UTC,"People paid for Early Access to voice their opinions and test their game and react.   They also sold the game as something, a Zombie Survival MMO, something we currently do not have. The devs also told us to use Reddit to help guide them. Remember when the Road Map was supposed to be based on player input and suggestions? They also said we could vote on what issues or features to focus on, has that happened either?  So being sold one thing and then be given something else is a classic bait and switch. This isn't jumping to conclusions, this is looking at 6 months of false promises with little to show off besides explosives, colorful hats, and rain.   People who are upset when feedback is overwhelmingly negative should maybe reconsider that the majority is unhappy. Maybe look at the numbers. Maybe you are the odd man out because your opinion is in the minority. That doesn't mean its wrong, but it doesn't mean you are justified or right either."

In a normal PVP the zombies are idiots, rarely spawn, and there are so many players it's damn near impossible to get any joy of the game because there is no consiquence as you stated above. However, in a HCPVP there are rarely any players, a SHIT ton of zombies that spawn in 1min or less keeping you always moving, always running, making it damn near impossible to build a base and having you retreat into a house to make your home till you have sufficiant materials to rush out and build a quick base to survive. This is great, wish the spawn rate was the same in PVP people would shit themselves...but you are right. Loot is WAY to easy, hell I can find water and food now. Before if I found a bottle of water that was purified already I felt like I had discovered god. Guns are to easy, as is ammo I agree. Especially if you build a workbench. Oh what's that, you have 300 .380 rounds? Well since that gun is useless fear not for now you have 150 shotgun or ar15 rounds YAY! I don't mind your bitching as you are making great points but I do believe the devs are attempting what they can with what little they got. Also, the map is doubling in size in a month, they are adding a hospital shortly I believe, cranberry has a police station now...and yeah there are some minor fix's. Soon BR will be perfect so it will be 100% game play. I mean how many freaking times do you need to add features to a death match game, seriously? You collect ammo, armor, guns. Shoot people, you die or you win, restart and repeat. I think that this scoreboard thing will probably be one of the last big things BR will do. They already have a hardcore version which is awesome fyi but yeah, nothing really needed in it. I feel your pain though..."

It's a snow ball. Once they get the annoying initial ball, it's easier to add snow and even easier as it grows.   It is an alpha game. Meaning an incomplete, who knows what tomorrow holds kind of situation. That's the nature of early access. People demand more yet it's coming at a pace that suits their development team and management style. It takes time but we will see it man. Just don't burn yourself out in this game. I've only played 200 or so hours. Involved as I am in the community and with daybreak. That's because I want to enjoy the content. If you mass play an early access game. Doesn't matter who,  and especially survival. You'll get bored. You'll think there's no new content. It comes with time mate :) and you'll be happier in the ""end"" that they did."

I'm usually opposed to zombie suggestions as most people just seem to want to buff zombies overall, however with these changes it would completely change the way we interact with them, in a good way.  Right now I can't stand zombies, they're more of an annoyance than a threat. They run after you forever and constantly rubber band so that they are always a set distance from you (, which is really annoying when trying to run in a staggered line with a clan). They constantly attack through walls and seemly ignore closed doors as well. There's also no option to turn down their sound effect without turning down the gun sounds, etc."

h1z1,3dulrg,JuneauWho,2,Sun Jul 19 21:03:45 2015 UTC,"A 'heat' system to trigger hoards would be pretty sweet as well. Things like shooting, excessive engine noise, high populations of survivors, and many more actions in a small area for too long should have a chance to trigger a hoard on that location. The 'heat' would rise and fall for different areas depending on what's going on and who's around. Examples: if someone sat in the PV PD and shot at everyone they saw and wouldn't move along, the shooting would increase the heat level for that area and they'd eventually get attacked by tons of undead who were investigating the sound. Using a campfire instead of a barbecue creates more light and smoke and would increase the chance of a group of zombies seeing/smelling you and coming to see what's for dinner. This could also work really well alongside zombie 'population caps'.  An area like Pleasant Valley should have a considerable amount of zombies, sure, but a group of 20-50 well armed survivors taking to the streets in force should be able to do some cleanup for a few hours at the least. But all the noise they (may or may not) make would add to that heat map and have a chance that they encounter a massive hoard at some point that might just fill the streets right back up with walkers, maybe even more than there was to begin with!"
h1z1,3dulrg,Whitmoore,3,Sun Jul 19 21:58:22 2015 UTC,Things like shooting   Firing off a round in an urban center at night should be 95% a death sentence.
h1z1,3dulrg,Isksmf,2,Sun Jul 19 23:12:19 2015 UTC,This exactly
h1z1,3dulrg,Cest7,2,Mon Jul 20 04:38:51 2015 UTC,"I see it as this. Zombies should be easy to Kill, But deadly if they get the jump on you. They should spawn in houses and cities in large numbers and it should require a combination of Stealth and numbers to be effective in cities.  Right now anyone can enter a city on a PvE server and loot at their pleasure. Zombies rarely spawn in buildings and even if you get dozens of zombies mad at you they can be easily rounded up, Herded and taking down with little threat.  Firstly they need to remove the ability to Backwalk and kill zombies. Once you learn how to do this its really hard to die. Using a spear, bow or dagger you can kill endless streams of zombies. Zombies should not slow down when they reach you they should continue at whatever speed they move and if they reach you they grapple bit claw and devour you.  DBG should try an experiment by making zombies as powerful as bears but require 1 hit to kill. Have them do 40% dmg with one hit + add Bleed. They could have it be like this for just one week. Its Alpha lets do some Crazy zombie tests!"

h1z1,3dt9bj,gravballe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:59:16 2015 UTC,"Take a look at mortal online, it's a pvp sandbox inspired by uo. It has a similar red / blue system."
h1z1,3dt9bj,Snippa,-3,Sun Jul 19 17:44:35 2015 UTC,"See, I don't like the red/blue system. Let me just kill whoever I want whenever I want, for whatever reason I want. If you're not in my clan or someone I respect, you bet your ass I'm gonna shoot you down and take your stuff."
h1z1,3dt9bj,Valariya,-1,Sun Jul 19 19:08:51 2015 UTC,"The reason you don't see this system in many, if any other games, is because UO was never very popular as compared to other MMOs. Therefore, in the eyes of ""suits"" who run most game companies, they don't trust in systems from that game and won't risk using them.  Hell, even EA who bought UO from Richard Garriot didn't like the system and turned the entire game into one big care bear land, aside from one single server called Siege Perilous, which retained the pvp flagging rule set that you described.  More on topic. It is a great system and would work great for H1Z1, especially if they eventually add in safe zone markets or trading posts. Anyone flagged as a murderer wouldn't be allowed to use them, giving an actual penalty to murderers who always kill on sight."
h1z1,3dt9bj,kpd157,0,Sun Jul 19 12:33:18 2015 UTC,"I was reading the modified OP and I have a few problems with it.  First of all Ultima Online is an Online Role Playing Game.  H1Z1 is an Online Open World Sandbox.  Permanent Classes have no place in OOWS type games.  I like the Concept of having people flag though from Blue to Grey then Permanently to Red.  However I do not like the idea of Safe Areas.  I also don't mind that Blue people can loot Grey's and above where the Greys and Reds cannot loot Blue people.    I actually posted a similiar idea where you got a negative and positive charma level based on individuals you killed or harmed and or defened from the enviroment (Saved a guy from a zombie attack or bear attack).  The Charma System would make someone negatively effected by you not lootable and you also couldn't hear them in proximity chat.  On the positive side anyone who had positive Charma with another person could hear them at longer ranges and also be able to loot corpses of those players and eventually secure trade with them.  Simple is probably better for H1Z1. This system that was put in UO might have worked for their Server Sizes and the fact they have Classes to create a ""Police"" Class.  In H1Z1 I don't see this as happening at least not with me playing it anymore.  I upvote this whole topic however because of its potential ideas but I also want to caution those who want to go down the RPG Path.    H1Z1 Should Not Go Down The Dark Path Of RPG As ARK Survival Evolve Did :)"
h1z1,3dt9bj,MormonDew,2,Sun Jul 19 19:12:00 2015 UTC,They have already said classes are coming soon. They called them professions.
h1z1,3dt9bj,Ziggy71,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:19:55 2015 UTC,"The idea of being unable to loot a bag which is sitting right in front of you doesn't fit the open world, survival, sandbox.  This idea may not be any more realistic, but perhaps if a red killed a blue that player/loot could have a very high chance of respawning immediately as a zombie at a random spot on the map.  Perhaps you could also add a chance for the loot in the belt, shirt, pants, or backpack to drop at the site of the kill as loot for the murderer.  The percentage could be different based on name colors of the attacker and victim.  Basically, the worse your name color the better chance you have to drop loot when killed and the less chance you have to receive it when you kill.  The rest of the loot either disappears or spawns on a zombie somewhere else."
h1z1,3dt9bj,kpd157,2,Sun Jul 19 20:33:58 2015 UTC,Possible but what about the person who dropped the loot ?  What if they want it back and they return to the scene of the crime only to find it gone ?  You have to concider all the possibilities and scenarios.  Which idea is easiest to do and gives the best results.  Promotes Working Together vs just Working :)  I Still Beleive Rewarding Cooperation And Penalizing Being Another Monster Is The Best Solution :)
h1z1,3dt9bj,kpd157,3,Sun Jul 19 21:19:25 2015 UTC,"Hehe you guys really misinterpreted it. There were no classes in Ultima online. There was only professions, just as they plan to add in h1z1. You gained skill level by using those skills, same as is planned in h1z1. There is no not being able to loot anything, you can loot anything, but if you loot a blue player yoy will become grey for a short time. Anyone can loot anyone stuff same as it has been."
h1z1,3dt9bj,DallaEllune,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:20:13 2015 UTC,Your telling me that all you do is change color in UO?  You cannot even prevent the Blues from being Looted ? Oh well then I guess the whole thing doesn't work without a Paladin Class ?  No one will protect the Blues and eventually everyone will end up Red :)    Which Is Exactly Where Everything Is Now In PVP ?
h1z1,3dt9bj,Skorpazoid,-2,Mon Jul 20 05:23:36 2015 UTC,"It seems as good system, but it won't reduce KOS by significant amount. Because those who KOS don't care how the rest of the players in the server perceive them or because they perceive as badge of honor having red name. They will keep killing  on sight anyways even before the other players are able to see that red name.  why not take a more realistic approach like sanity system? After all managing your sanity and the moral of others is just another aspect of surviving in a post apocalyptic world. Check it out:   https://www.reddit.com/r/h1z1/comments/397xt5/discussion_simple_and_realistic_way_to_reduce_kos/"
h1z1,3dt9bj,DallaEllune,4,Sun Jul 19 13:16:11 2015 UTC,I'm a KoShole. I'd love this feature. It would be a badge of honour to get the red name and it would look cool driving round with reds.  But it would help the rest of the player base. Sometimes I'm caught in a bad position and people show me mercy because I'm just another random player. When it's unlikely I would be so kind put in the same position. So this is a good chance to get a bit of post-apocalypse justice.
h1z1,3dt9bj,Skorpazoid,0,Sun Jul 19 14:33:42 2015 UTC,"You got a point, but I am not against the Humanity system as a rule set, it opens up more game play mechanics and that is what we need right now. But it wouldn't reduce KOS that much right? Would you KOS less with this system?  All I wan't is another rule set as the one I mentioned above, that is opted at reducing the KOS.   Don't get me wrong, there should be KOS in this type of games because that is what make the game scary to go in certain places, but should not be as frequent (95% of the time) as is now."
h1z1,3dt9bj,DallaEllune,4,Sun Jul 19 14:50:31 2015 UTC,"I think it could possibly actually reduce KoS.  Anyone with a red name will be a legitimate target for all players. So they will never be spared. Now for people like me that won't be a problem as I don't care. But for a more passive player, it might make him think twice about taking that shot on a lone guy who seems to have a nice gun - because he knows that will flag him and it will make his life harder.  But it is also good for the lone-wolf, I think. Not only are neutrals going to get an easier time because some people will be reluctant to get the tag, but from an RP perspective I can see it being really fun being a solitary red flag having to evade everyone. Taking sniper shots and moving on, knowing your a KoS to every honest man.  It will also help players to form more good alliances. I drive round with my friends and kill everyone we come across. I think it would be even more fun (if my friends were on board) to form a protective alliance and go out hunting all who have a red flag.  I don't think it would have a huge impact on KoS.But it would have some, and it would make revenge for victims easier and create a more meaningful PVP environment. Especially because it allows people to form protective alliances. The more of these the harder life will be for red flags, the easier it will be to get help from friends (who will jump at the opportunity to go hunting).  Rather then ""dude there's a player lets get him""."
h1z1,3dt9bj,Skorpazoid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:57:15 2015 UTC,"I see and you are 100% right. Also it doesn't seems like system that is hard to implement into the game so the devs should definitely make and use the humanity system as a rule set.   The only thing I dislike about it, is that is not realistic (seeing red , gray names,) or at least is less  realistic that the sanity system.  As you said it will reduce the KOS only from the more passive players who care not to get the red tag. The one I am suggesting would make impact on every player so it would reduce KOS even more then the humanity system and it will introduce more essential items to search for, alcohol , pills , drugs.  Don't get me wrong, I think the devs should definitely start making the humanity system and further in the future when they have the time and resources  they should take the more realistic approach and work on the sanity system."
h1z1,3dt9bj,DallaEllune,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:27:03 2015 UTC,"Well it's down to personal preference. I'm not really trying to argue here because it's just personal opinion. But to me personally, realism holds no form of argument except in terms of aesthetics.  I can imagine people arguing:  'Well part of the game is not knowing friend from foe. You have to make wise judgements and your constantly on your toes. You can be who you want to be and you are judged on how you are with each individual in each context. It allows you to be a fluid character adding more depth.'  Now that I could understand. Although I would disagree that this would be better then a system with humanity. But if it went on to say:  'Similar to real life. People don't know your past actions'  For me it would add absolutely nothing to the argument. I mean you could argue that the realism would make things more immersive. But realism is really a very abstract concept, and nearly all games I've been immersed in have been complete fantasy. A game has never been so eerily similar to life that I have got lost or immersed in it.  You know, it's like people enjoy games when you eat and drink, claiming it adds a depth of realism. But personally I think it is just because it gives you more things to do. More to focus on. More opportunities for action and more considerations. Realism just gives a believable justification. A justification which is only needed when the mechanic doesn't obviously contribute to good gameplay.  A good example of this is the party system which shows your team members with a green name. It is absolutely necessary to make the game more enjoyable, but holds very little value in terms of realism. But it doesn't need the justification for its presence because it is self-evident.  Basically TL;DR - I think the idea of realism holds value when it is used to justify interesting game mechanics. But holds little when arguing against fun gameplay mechanics (except in terms of visuals which is an entirely different discussion).  I have read your humanity system and I think it is a really cool idea. And by the looks of the thread so did a lot of other people! I'd really be interested in seeing it implemented. However I don't think it's strengths lie in it's realism. In fact I'd say it is lacking in realism. It forces human emotions and reactions to different events in a quantifiable way, which would be the complete opposite of any real human interaction.  It also treats various different interactions as being the same, because ultimately they had the same outcome. Your killing of an innocent in a fit of anger would in real life would create different emotional responses after the killing if it were one of a nihilistic indifference for example.  So the sanity system doesn't hold much weight in terms of realism for me, but as a gameplay mechanic it does look awesome. It would definitely give interesting consequences to killing and a variety of factors which would help to nuance PVP.  Ultimately though my personal preference would still be the humanity system. Due to its simplicity. Not only would it add a lot to the game, but it would be very straightforward to grasp, and would add the fluidity of the gameplay. That's my preference. i like simple rule sets which create complex gameplay.  Though I can't argue that your system would bring more relevance to item and use classes in a clever way which humanity would not."
h1z1,3dt9bj,derpbox99,3,Sun Jul 19 16:51:20 2015 UTC,"I understand your point of view.   I will give you my opinion about realism in games, I don't want to argue , just to exchanges opinions:   Realism brings immersion especially to survival games.  It is a game and the realism in games needs to have limits that is for sure. But the realism or as close to being realistic can be, makes h1z1 the game that it is now. Let me give you few examples:   Loosing all gear, skills, progress upon death is as close as one game can get to the realistic death. Will you feel the thrill / adrenaline rush the game provokes if you lose nothing when you die or if you have 10 lives or smtg before you die??? The need to drink , eat, stay warm and healthy (later on it will be implemented, sanity too I hope) is one step closer to the realism. So you need to hunt, scavenge, boil the water etc and that is another thing that makes h1z1 the game that is now. Would it be more fun if the basic needs system wasn't implemented??? The interaction with other people, not having predetermined missions is one step closer to realism. Yes it is close to realism to go out in the world and do w/e you want instead of doing missions given by the AI like: kill 10 wolves, bring me 10 bottles of water, kill the horde, bring me sparkplugs, go there and come back etc. Daybreak can make and maybe it will make the base building more complex and realistic. ( it is what it is now because the game is in alpha and in won't be the final version of base building).   Now, just for a moment, imagine an animation in which your character places the logs, planks etc. one by one as he makes the shack or the building. In the process of doing it he loses stamina, uses tools, hammers, nails etc. which make noise and attracts zombies. So the building animation would be like 2-6 minutes depending of the complexity of the structure.  And during the process, from time to time, you will have cancel it and defend your base from zombies. It will be something like mini event. And you know what? Once completed, it will give the players sense of accomplishment because they worked hard to have a secure place to call home.  (I am talking about state in which the game has no bugs and bases are not easily raided and there is higher need for safe place because of hordes).  And most importantly if it takes time to build and if during the process zombies are attracted, there wonâ€™t be many basses in the city so less fps drop there   Healing. In DayZ it is more complex more realistic (no one complains) and it opens fun game mechanics. Wouldn't be more fun if wounds can get infected if not treated in the right way or with the right tools, maybe slow you down just a little bit or lose 1 hp every 1 min or something like that? It is survival game and it would just increase the sense of struggle. There's so much space for improvement to the healing system. Not being able to teleport is realistic and it makes h1z1 the game that is now. Will be be more fun if everybody could teleport to some points on the map like in the city? ......I could be going on and on and on about how the realism bring more immersion in this type of games...   tl:dr So the more the game is realistic (within the reasonable limits) the more immersion it brings to the players and thus is more enjoyable. It is in the small things. They accumulate and have big impact.  Just imagine what h1z1 would be if:  -when you die you lose nothing, -you don't need to search for weapons -you start with pre chosen set of weapons, -you have unlimited ammo -your health automatically regenerates if you haven't received damage in the last 10 seconds -you don't have any basic needs, -and you can teleport to the different towns.     The game would become killing arena with zombies included. Which is not bad idea for a rule set, but that is not what H1Z1 (defined as a survival game) is.   How you seen Video Games The Movie? In one point it talks about how the improved technology made the games more immersive , and it says the the most immersive experience it will be the virtual reality.   Will it be more immersive if there is some karma system that changes the color of your name from green to red deepening how many people you killed? Or  if there are the quasi-realistic effects to the mental sanity of the charter?  Please, just please, and am talking to everybody, do not set the threshold for realism in h1z1 too low. It is the realism in h1z1 what makes the game that is now. Do not sacrifice realism for simplicity.  Editing:   It also treats various different interactions as being the same, because ultimately they had the same outcome. Your killing of an innocent in a fit of anger would in real life would create different emotional responses after the killing if it were one of a nihilistic indifference for example.   I didn't complete understand the last part, maybe to my limited English vocabulary. There is different quantity of sanity lost based on who you kill and what happened before that, gonna copy paste that part:      **LOOSING SANITY:**   - (self defense) if you kill person that damaged you first, (or shot at you)  -90 sanity  - (a kill) if you kill person that didn't damaged you first, -200  - (murder) if you kill unarmed person that didn't damaged you at all beforehand, - 330  (unarmed person has no firearms visible on him, for ex. new spawns)  - (friend killer) if you kill a friend that didn't damage you at all beforehand, -400 (a friend can be a steam friend or someone in your group)  - (panic) if a friend dies near you -50  - (revenge) if you kill a person that killed at least one of your friends, you don't lose sanity   - The more the person you kill is zombified in the less sanity you lose"
h1z1,3dt9bj,DallaEllune,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:15:45 2015 UTC,"with increasing loss in sanity it would be cool to have an increasing number of hallucenations i.e.   Noises that aren't there, doors opening and closing, gun shots, zombie grunts and growls Seeing zombies/players appear and vanish, running by you etc. Seeing items and having those items vanish when you interact with them   to regain sanity or reduce hallucenations you would have to stop all actions that increase the loss of sanity, so in game time spent behaving normally would reduce the effect"
h1z1,3dt9bj,Feythfil,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:38:33 2015 UTC,"Yes yes, great ideas! That is  what I had in mind about negative effects when you lose sanity, I even made in depth post about possible sanity system as alternative to the karma system:  https://www.reddit.com/r/h1z1/comments/397xt5/discussion_simple_and_realistic_way_to_reduce_kos/  If you have time check it out.  I used some of your ideas :D"
h1z1,3dt9bj,Skorpazoid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:15:41 2015 UTC,I don't think it would reduce or encourage KOS.   However it would give a depth to the game and help individuals be able to form communities even on pvp servers.   That would give a US vs THEM thing without having to do factions.  That's what happened in UO.  Blues could kill reds without a reputation hit or risking their blue tag.  If anything it makes the red tags more KOS.
h1z1,3dt9bj,JDogg126,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:41:21 2015 UTC,Yeah to me it is just a win-win. I do think it would reduce KoS. But even if it didn't I could see it giving non-KoSers a lot more to do. PvP wouldn't be limited to assholes such as myself! And you would get experienced PvPers to stand up to the KoSers.
h1z1,3dt9bj,h1z1plus2,0,Sun Jul 19 16:54:05 2015 UTC,"The only thing that would really address bandit play is to attack the play style head on.  You're right.. If the player intends to KoS pvp in deathmatch style, changing name color does nothing to curb that.  It's necessary to have a consequence that actually reduces power the more you do the undesired behavior.  The problem is that the game does nothing to really put the player in a survival situation.    Hunger and thirst are just not the only things a survivor needs to deal with.  Morale and sanity are vital too.  I just think those concepts are too complex for a free to play game to deal with adequately.  How do you represent that a player is hungry or thirsty?  Just give a bar on the UI that the player can try to keep full like hit points and maybe add a sound effect if thirst or hunger are too low.  Easy.    How do you affect game play if a player has become depressed or deranged?  Not so easy.  If I am hungry or thirsty that doesn't affect me much and I can easily address it by using food/drink.  How to address low morale/sanity?  It should not be as easy as using an item but what makes sense in the context that it's still just a game?  No lt so easy.    I think a survival game needs to be built from the ground up with the concept of complete survival beyond just hp, thirst, and hunger because it's essential to build the game around the survival concept, not start with a shooter and cobble in ideas later."
h1z1,3dt9bj,JDogg126,3,Sun Jul 19 14:20:57 2015 UTC,Blue vs Red creates conflict. Not some bullshit shoot someone in the back scenario if you know what I mean.
h1z1,3dt9bj,DallaEllune,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:32:54 2015 UTC,Red vs blue works if you select red or blue before logging in and the server balances the sides.  I don't think it works for this persistent open world model though.
h1z1,3dt9bj,masters1777,0,Tue Jul 21 14:50:19 2015 UTC,"I completely agree.   The problem is that the game does nothing to really put the player in a survival situation.   We think alike. Yes that is one of the problems, and I have worked days on combining into rule set (or game mode) many redditor's suggestions  that would make the game harder and give a survival feeling, if you have time check it out:  https://www.reddit.com/r/h1z1/comments/3djhkf/discussion_ultimate_survival_v_01_rule_set_for/   How do you affect game play if a player has become depressed or deranged?   Well it is not that hard, I will copy paste my some of my suggestions from the sanity model as a rule set post:  1000-750 Crystal Clear  No negative effects.  750-650  A slight headacheYou vision gets blurry at random times, every now and then. Frequency: very rare, like 3 or 4 times in single game day.  650-500 Minor depression Includes the previous effects plus: you character starts weeping at random times for 10-15 seconds. During that time you are able to do everything normally, but the weeping may give up your position to other players and/or attract few zombies.  It can open up some role play :D Frequency: very very rare like once a day.  500-400 Major depression Includes the previous effects plus:    ""Being tired and without energy"" results in reduced max stamina ""Trouble concentrating or making decisions""  at random times the frame rates of the game drops to 20 or 30 FPS for half or full minute (this is meant to show that you lost concentration) Frequency: 3-4 times in game day. ""Trouble getting to sleep or feeling sleepy during the day"" getting the exhausted de-buff at random times. Also when you sleep you don't get the full rested bonus and it needs more then 30 seconds to fully rest.   400-300 Persistent Depressive Disorder includes the previous effects, additionally:   ""Being tired and without energy"" results in even more reduced stamina ""Trouble concentrating or making decisions"" is more frequent ""Loosing your appetite"" You character refuses to eat and drink until is starved / dehydrated for extended period of time (thus loosing HP)   300-200 Broken Includes the previous effects, plus sometimes when you rest you character refuses to get up for a few minutes and cries. Unless you sleep in your base you are very vulnerable.  200-100 Minor Psychotic DepressionThe previous effects are gone. Instead: ""Head is pounding and hands are shaking"" at random times frequently. During that time: your aim is very very bad, you experience blurry vision or FPS drop, you can't craft, build, bandage up or drive...  100-1 Major Psychotic Depression The ""Head is pounding and hands shaking"" effect plus:      Hallucinations  that include:  hearing footsteps around you, hearing shoots near you, seeing figures of people afar and up close making you waste ammo; having flashbacks of the places and the people you killed (the game could use capture screen every time you kill a person and showing you them at this stage it could be smtg like the flash-bang effect with high pitch noise in your ears).   This will make the game horror :D   At reaching 0 sanity % chance to commit SUICIDE after some time of reaching this stage, there is random chance that your character will try to commit suicide even if you increase the sanity afterwards. He puts his pistol on the head and he ether kills him self... or decide not to. If he decides not to your sanity increases to 300.  If you want to know more in depth about this rule set: https://www.reddit.com/r/h1z1/comments/397xt5/discussion_simple_and_realistic_way_to_reduce_kos/  It the devs could implement even simpler mode, and if it reduces KOS could work more in depth later when they have the time and resources."
h1z1,3dt9bj,DallaEllune,2,Sun Jul 19 15:07:40 2015 UTC,"This kind of reminds me of the game ""This War of Mine"". It uses a similar depression mechanic so you don't just kill everyone. I like the idea though."
h1z1,3dt9bj,masters1777,2,Sun Jul 19 15:34:35 2015 UTC,"It is inspired on This War of Mine, good game tho. Also on the TWD series where people in general struggle to stay sane spoilers ahead   the Governor who went insane, or the solder Abraham who tried to suicide, or Tyreese who lost concentration or just lost his will to live and got bitten by a single zombie, now Rick is struggling to maintain his sanity etc."

h1z1,3dt9bj,DallaEllune,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:45:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I suppose this would reduce KoS in the way that I would just stop playing the game altogether. I don't want to be punished for choosing to play the game in a certain playstyle. Why would I want to play a game where I'm unable to move for minutes at a time, and have a random chance of dying by suicide? I am supposed to be in control of my character, not the game. It's my aim versus the other guy's aim. That's where the fun is for me, why should I be punished for that?"
h1z1,3dt9bj,trackerk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:21:04 2015 UTC,"You won't have to punished for anything at all.  All the time we are talking about a rule set.

Those who want less PVP can chose to play on servers with this type of rule sets.   Those who want more survival feeling in game like fighting the elements, managing the food supply thus managing the hunger, thirst;fighting zombies can chose to play on server with rule sets that increase the danger that come from non player factors."
h1z1,3dt9bj,DallaEllune,0,Sun Jul 19 16:51:11 2015 UTC,"Since there is no skill progression, once I don't like the effects, I bury my stuff in a cache. Delete my character. Make new character. Pick up loot. Return to my naughty ways with a clean soul."
h1z1,3dt9bj,trackerk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:11:46 2015 UTC,"In the full post I have talked about ways abuot preventing thing like the one you said. I will copy paste it:        And preventing people taking advantage of the sanity model   How to prevent people KOS as usual and once they get hit with enough de-buffs, suicide or respawn  Possible solutions:    Weekly or monthly rewards, something like the skin drop in CS GO, but instead of getting the rewards when you reach the next level, you get them when you reach certain number of hours survived. I think with the new profession system that DBG is introducing when you die (or suicide) you lose all progression even outside your profession like shooting, cooking, running, building etc. So there is less incentive to suicide. player who use the /respawn command, commit suicide as an effect of losing mental sanity, die due to hunger or thirst (who dies unintentionally due to hunger and thirst?) can't join servers with the sanity system for 5 days also people who die to NPC and because of fall damage (who dies to NPC unintentionally in this current state of the game? you can outrun every NPC) can't joint servers with the sanity system for 5 days"

You know the latest bear changes right? Same for zombies.... Even if there is horde of zombies chasing you, all you need to do is to run as long as you need to find and get into a house, and one shoot them from the windows with the easy to find sticks with the makeshift bow.  And the /respawn thing could be removed for the servers with sanity rule set, btw it is left there in the game unintentionally.   Also, since I deleted my character and made a new one,   about the creating new character there could be limit where it won't block you entering the sanity servers. For example you can create 2 characters every week and still be able to enter the servers. There is no reasonable  need to create 1 character every day.    are you going to prevent new players from joining the server?   Yes, as I have written in my post, just gonna copy paste:   this rule set to be available only for players who survived with one character certain number of hours in PVE.     The logic behind that is those who prefer the KOS play style usually are not that type of people who would spend hours in the friendly PVE only to be able to KOS on servers with  debuffs for those who KOS. On the other hand those who want more survival experience less death match, if they haven't already, would gladly spend time in PVE only to able to play on servers with less KOS.)"
h1z1,3dt9bj,DallaEllune,11,Sun Jul 19 17:42:44 2015 UTC,Played the original UO :) and remember that system very well and agree that it would be a good starting point to fit over this game.. Definitely looking forward to play on a server with those rules :)  vvv
h1z1,3dt9bj,MyNameIsNurf,4,Sun Jul 19 06:39:37 2015 UTC,"It seems as a very good system. It will reduce the KOS  from the more passive players who actuality care not to get the red tag but it won't reduce KOS by significant amount.   Those who have the KOS as main play style really don't care how the rest of the players in the server perceive them or they perceive as badge of honor having red name. They will keep killing on sight anyways even before the other players are able to see the red name.  why not take a more realistic approach like sanity system? After all managing your sanity and the moral of others is just another aspect of surviving in a post apocalyptic world. Check it out:  https://www.reddit.com/r/h1z1/comments/397xt5/discussion_simple_and_realistic_way_to_reduce_kos/  Don't get me wrong, I think the devs should definitely start making the humanity system because it seems easier to make and further in the future when they have the time and resources they should take the more realistic approach and work on the sanity system."

h1z1,3dt9bj,DJWheeze,3,Sun Jul 19 21:31:06 2015 UTC,What if someone's trying to raid your base? Your friend who is blue will have to shoot another one of the raiders who is also blue. I think there only should be a penalty if you're killing a fresh spawn who has no weapons equipped. But then the guys you're killing can come back as fresh spawns and cause trouble.
h1z1,3dt9bj,DJWheeze,5,Sun Jul 19 08:05:16 2015 UTC,I will answer this and hopefully you will take back your downvote and change to an upvote. Causing any damage to player buildings would flag you as a criminal. This would allow the owner to shoot you without penalty. The same goes when you go into someones home. The system would go through death meaning that the new fresh spawn will maintain his old humanity.
h1z1,3dt9bj,elastikspastik,2,Sun Jul 19 08:07:55 2015 UTC,I didn't downvote. I just disagreed. Not all of the raiders will be damaging the base. Most would just be guarding the guy blowing shit up.
h1z1,3dt9bj,Diamondandy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:15:38 2015 UTC,"blue on blue makes you a criminal, but lets face it thats part of the game in itself. there is no downside to the criminal system being adapted to, even in this situation. your blue friend will simply become a criminal for a short amount of time. no harm no foul. you as a red however, if adapted like UO's system, will have to play for a few hours per murder charge you have to be come a non-murderer again. the system is really designed well and is the PERFECT solution for any sandbox game, honestly."
h1z1,3dt9bj,h1z1plus2,-1,Sun Jul 19 11:21:19 2015 UTC,Say they're trying to no-clip through and you shoot them in their attempt? They haven't caused damage but the intent to raid is clear. Would be tough to work around.

h1z1,3dt9bj,bidwood,2,Sun Jul 19 10:07:31 2015 UTC,"Myself among others have suggested this system. It's extremely simple yet effective in my opinion. It may not reduce KOS (unless you put penalties on death like UO did for ""Reds""). It's too easy and simple so DBG will not do it. They will likely spend 4 months on a Humanity system that will have to be reworked 2 months later.  They should also take a note out of UO's housing system/decay system for the people who want bases non raidable since DBG will likely never fix no-clip. Basically it is a key system, you have a key, you can enter the house, pretty simple. You lose key, people can loot your house. Don't log in for 2 weeks, your house decays and free reign on your loot. This would likely take very little coding time I would have to think...  I know most will bitch and moan but perhaps there should be atleast 1 safe zone? Perhaps where you could bank/atm (keep X amount of storage so when you do get wiped out you can have something left..). Would this have people camp around? Sure would, but a game like this needs things to happen by the playerbase...otherwise it's a build/loot simulator."

I don't like any actual in game mechanic consequences that will inhibit my normal play style. Karma systems that don't inhibit specific play styles are a good thing.  I shouldn't lose profession stats, or become less efficient at aiming, or some other crap because you don't like the respawn button. Get better at the game IMO, rather then punish another player for pwning you.  Basically Karma system involving colored name plates, possible rank rewards for killing appropriate targets seems great. Punishing players for playing the game their way(including KoS) seems terrible."

House system: House owner with co-owners and friends. Would be awesome for base building.  healers: having npc ""healers"" or something like that. When you die you have to run to a rez point instead of doing /respawn non stop till you are close to where you died/where your friends are.  currency + market: player interaction is where this game is at. As of right now player interaction consist of only fighting and nothing else. Trading items and having a currency would help.

h1z1,3dt9bj,SaevioGaming,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:29:00 2015 UTC,"This system sounds a lot like the one in EVE Online. I think it will work about as well as the one in EVE as well. Gankers in EVE (KOS for H1Z1) don't care about the negative repercussions. I know, I was one (https://zkillboard.com/character/93093573/). It was a badge of honor and we celebrated every time one of our group reached the maximum negative security status. The Paladin mechanic would just be gamed by the KOSers. In EVE, where I had over a billion ISK bounty placed by other players, I would have my alt shoot me during a gank to collect some of the bounty. The same could be done here with a 2nd account Paladin, or just have one of the KOSers be a ringleader for awhile and let his status stay at blue so he could do it. Since the KOSers want to fight, and really there is no death penalty in H1Z1, sending Paladins after them would not be a deterrent any way. Finally, since there is no character progression, if I don't like the effects, I bury my stuff in a cache, delete my character and make a new one, then pick up stuff with a clean soul.  I don't KOS in H1Z1 because I chose to RP a good guy, same way I chose to RP a bad guy in EVE. But I do not see this having any affect on those who KOS."

h1z1,3dt9bj,ChinaIsFree,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:48:09 2015 UTC,IMO UO up until 99' was the best game until this game was released. I am against UO's noto system because it was always easily abused. It had its flaws and one way is to delete your character. Yes they can implement ways to prevent this but there are more ways it can be abused. Every karma system will be abused one way or another. If the game is F2P this would be another way to abuse this system. Something new will just sprout up to abuse it. It will go on and on and isn't worth it.
h1z1,3dt9bj,xSergis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:59:46 2015 UTC,"Good point being F2P because it likely would be abused, however you would just have to keep making account after account (you eventually after X amount of kills will be Red anyway...so...I don't see the point really) .

h1z1,3dt9bj,CodeBridge,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:21:57 2015 UTC,"To add to this, they could make skins that are exclusive to reds/blues so that you can tell from looking at them what kind of player you are dealing with.  More kill counts on you would also make your character look more menacing, bloody, and dangerous (I think the devs have this planned to some degree, or so I've heard.)  This could also be extended to vehicles, so that raider type players could skin their cars to look like some crazy Mad Max type vehicles while friendly players could use... well, I'm at a loss for a good example here, but you get what I mean.  Also, what about an introduction system?  When you meet players, they have the option of introducing themselves to you, thus allowing you to recognize them at a distance.  Any player who hasn't been introduced will be a stranger, you won't recognize them (i.e. see their name) from a distance, and will have to be wary of them.  That way, if you meet nice players who are your friends, you can make friends with them and spot them at a certain distance.  It just makes sense for a character to recognize his friends and distinguish them from complete strangers, especially in a situation where you might be trying to save a friend from an attacker, only to find that you can't tell them apart.  This would add a whole new level of notoriety to KOS status players, especially ones who like to befriend others before turning on them, since they would forever be recognized and hunted down by those they betrayed.  It would make interactions between players more fun rather than just having to KOS everyone because you have to be 5 feet away from them to even see their name."

h1z1,3dt9bj,in420weblaze,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:05:50 2015 UTC,"I too also played UO originally, and was on Lake Superior (to whomever I saw say that) and really enjoyed their notoriety system before the change from Dishonorable/Dastardly/Dark/Dread Lord=Grey to Grey/Red to their later design where Murderer=Red+Statloss @ death and must agree that their scheme for negating the mindless pvp worked but they killed off an important player base in their game at the same time which is why I disagreed with their stat loss system strongly and see no reason why this game would embark on the destruction of their game by doing something in this fashion; I would suggest an approach that would impede the Murderer/Dread Lord but do not destroy their purpose in the game otherwise you end up with the carebear world of Trammel (UO evolved PVE) where people provoke un expecting players into pvp situations/zones or either grief players by means other than the designed in game mechanics.    I think a simple system that only identifies players as ""Unfriendly"" easily would help me with the KOS players as I have no problem with the PVP interaction but find it difficult to filter out the bad people from the good people until they have already begun to fire; If I could identify a player as a KOS player then I could, hypothetically, kill them before they have a chance to attack me and the ""grief"" situation then becomes reversed and thus the player must be prepared to be attacked on sight if he/she wishes to attack on sight.  In addition, I typically play games online for the player vs player interaction and would also have no problem being signified as ""red"" or a ""Murderer"" if I decide to play that way. . .  in a game like H1z1 it would be difficult to further dilute the notoriety system to understand other ""Dishonorable"" acts, e.g., base destruction, murderer, corpse looter, general grief tactics, etc.     It seems like the easiest solution is a system similar to the UO guild/faction wars but instead use it only to identify people who you want to KOS instead of identifying those people who are going to KOS you; this may be accomplished though a system allowing a clan to mark their KOS targets by individual name and/or for all rival clan members; with this system you then ultimately fix any hesitation regarding KOS. This way I login and see someone marked as a ""Rival"" and know to KOS him/her as they will more than likely KOS me and relieves the game designers from having to implement tedious checks and balances to identify a ""Bad"" player who needs to be punished.    Thanks for letting me throw in on this discussion and please keep up the great work on the game and don't let those pesky ""Downloaders"" get ya down!"
h1z1,3dt9bj,The5thSurvivor,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:31:01 2015 UTC,"In other games and genres of games, yes. For H1Z1, and this genre of game, no.  In WoW, flagging is important. I need to see a nameplate with some indication of who to avoid or engage on in world PvP. In RuneScape, lol, skulling in the Wilderness is an important flag to know who to engage or avoid. In these fantasy games, its pretty critical to be able to gauge risk v reward, and your chances.  In H1Z1, in this relatively realistic interpretation of a zombie apocalypse, you /shouldn't/ have any flags to make informed judgments. People are the biggest threat in a post apocalyptic, zombie ridden world. In a real setting, which again this is trying to be barring zombies - spare us the lecture thanks - you live by scrapping for food and supplies, everything is valuable. People want what you have, especially if it means getting a lot, for very little effort. Trust should be rare. People should be on guard to protect their lives, and their things.   The PvP element this game has is as real, and perfect, as it gets. It allows the players to be trusting and try to build a community with strangers, or control everything and relentlessly pursue valuables by any means necessary. That is real. That is what this game stands for. Each and every encounter will be different, depending on you, and the player you meet, its always up in the air what will happen.   My .02."

Perhaps not let Reds spawn for x amount of time or they can't craft for x amount of time. Statloss won't work and people will macro off the initial murder count scenario.  We need risk vs reward it's what makes these games last. UO is still bringing in money unlike 95% of MMO after it.
h1z1,3dt9bj,paziek,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:51:30 2015 UTC,Since this thread exists and didn't realise so many people from those UO days played we should all get a clan together. Something happened to gaming after he 90s....  I feel gamers in that Era atleast appreciated he aspect of these type of games.
h1z1,3dt9bj,andrelopez360,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:56:23 2015 UTC,"They'll have Humanity Servers in during EA.  That should be the Hero VS Bandit system you're looking for.  I'm hoping it's more persistent than UO, so a player just can't sit idle for X amount of time to get rid of bad humanity.  I'm hoping they'll have safezones as well in the humanity servers.  You can see what a Humanity System looks like here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/h1z1/comments/2j47lo/karma_humanity_system/"
h1z1,3dt9bj,Snippa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:51:35 2015 UTC,estimating the intentions of a random player is a part of the game imo  id rather not colorcode human interaction
h1z1,3dt9bj,Snippa,2,Sun Jul 19 08:06:54 2015 UTC,"In ultima online, when you saw a blue walk up to you, you still were estimating his intentions. He could be waiting until you were low to kill you, to follow you and kill you when you are off guard, and so on."

h1z1,3dt9bj,Waywardson74,0,Sun Jul 19 06:18:37 2015 UTC,"Sorry man but it would throw off the balance that banditry has right now. In IRL, a murderer could look like a baby faced model at one end of the spectrum, and a hardcore tatted up maniac at the other.   The thing is you would never know except for clues in the mannerisms possibly or the clothes. I rather have a KOS bandit have blood on his shoes or hands for example then a red name tag completely letting me know this guy is more than likely gonna kill me.   How am i supposed to ask travelers for water and then shoot them in the face as I put on the ""nice guy voice"" if they can see my name is red?"
h1z1,3dt9bj,DrakenZA,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:21:39 2015 UTC,"Yes blood on their bodies would be nice, but how likely do you think it is that is what they are going to add?"

h1z1,3dt9bj,DrakenZA,0,Sun Jul 19 08:42:39 2015 UTC,"Pretty nice concept but not really functional for this game... I would prefer a system like GTA V where you look totally normal UNLESS you start killing too many people (lets say more than 3 in less than an hour) doesn't matter if they were good or bad people, you killed 3 an now you are wanted... you have a couple of hours with a bounty and then it goes away, pretty simple and really functional. It would be really boring for me to find a stranger and know how he behaves, I really like PvP because you never know what kind of people you are dealing with. The element of surprise! I think it should have a ""karma"" or ""most wanted"" system implemented but not like UltimaOnline, this is too complex and ruins part of the PvP Experience in a zombie apocalypse. Yeah, remember they are trying to make this game feel like a real life experience they don't want you to fly a dragon zombie shooting fireballs to highlighted players :) not knowing = suspense = adrenaline rush = great game"
h1z1,3dt9bj,DrakenZA,2,Sun Jul 19 10:21:16 2015 UTC,"Don't be silly. Almost everyone does KOS. There is no incentive not to, other than maybe role playing. I hope you don't believe that sane people will apply their IRL morals to video game and don't shoot you in the face, because it is unethical/wrong?"
h1z1,3dt9bj,Waywardson74,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:39:17 2015 UTC,"You still wouldn't know. And the system is very simple really. Remember, this apocalypse is years after it happened, at which point people would start to form civilization again (basebuilding) and not just killing each other at random anymore for anything."
h1z1,3dt9bj,DrakenZA,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:31:03 2015 UTC,"Who says it's years after the outbreak? According to the h1z1 website the game takes place a couple of months after the outbreak. All I'm saying is that this system is too friendly, it promotes a sense of justice. Justice shouldn't exist in such a scenario, unless it's being applied by players! For example, I play on a server with many ""Police Officers"" who chase down the bad guys, we all help the police officers and chat by radio with everyone to promote peace. However, anyone, even police officers should be able to have an outrage and kill 1 or 2 innocent people without a glowing red aura for 2 days! xD (I'm exaggerating to show my point, justice should come from players not from the game itself entirely, of course, mass murderers should have a bounty)"
h1z1,3dt9bj,Waywardson74,0,Sun Jul 19 11:44:15 2015 UTC,"no no no no no no no. Ultima is a world with rules and governments in place to enforce those rules. h1z1 is an apocalyptic world with no government and no rules.  I am sick of seeing people beg for a penalty to killing other players. I will be so pissed off if this game becomes like UO and has red v blue and eventually (because people will continue to complain that they're being pked) a tram/fel split.  There are PvE servers already, go play there."
h1z1,3dt9bj,DrakenZA,0,Sun Jul 19 16:29:59 2015 UTC,"You didn't play UO then. PVE servers are trammel. In trammel the system meant nothing because you couldn't attack players no matter where you were. In fellucca, you could attack anyone anywhere, steal from anyone anywhere, the only places that there were specific rules were in cities. Even then you could do most of the above."

h1z1,3dw46t,Knotwood,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:25:45 2015 UTC,"I'll talk with you.   I KOS.   Why? Because one strategy is to play AS a Bambi, respawn, make a bow and try to take out a geared player. Bambis have ZERO to lose and EVERYTHING to gain. If I'm fully geared, what do I have to lose? All my gear to a ""Lels fegt, u got rekt by a bambi"", to ""oh man sorry, that headshot was an accident"", and they're gone with my loot before I get back.   Kill or be killed. All can be lost to that Bambi with one lucky shot from them."
h1z1,3dw46t,Knotwood,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:13:54 2015 UTC,"Ty for engaging into meaningful conversation.  - If you are the fully geared player and KOS a random Bambi without talking to him first , only because you are afraid that the Bambi could one shot you, well you are just person who gets scared easily, you have exactly 0 courage. Here is why:   Unless you wear a motorcycle with 0 durability, or Tactical Helmet with less then  1000 durability you can't get one one shoted from a bow. Even if the Bambi gets you by surprise and starts with one head shot advantage, between the first and the second shot from the bow you have enough time to kill the Bambi with any firearm.   If you don't trust your ability to kill a Bambi before he hits you 2 times with a bow in your head you don't have self confidence or simply you know that you have bad aim.   If you are the fully geared player and the Bambi shot at you first and you kill him it is not KOS, it is self defense.  If you are the fully geared player and a Bambi start talking to you only to try to trick you and by the his sound of the voice you figure out that he wants to kill you as soon as he got the chance, and you kill him it is not KOS. If you are the Bambi and you engage someone in conversation with the goal to trick them into thinking that you could become theirs friend and kill them the first chance you got, it is not KOS.  If  you are the Bambi and you try to KOS fully geared person, well you will die 95% of the time   TL;DR It still takes courage not to KOS even a Bambi, way way way way less courage compared to not KOSing fully geared player.  At the end your way of playing the game is just one of the many types of playstyle , the easiest one.  How often do you think it will happen to get one shoted by a Bambi with a bow? once in 100 times?  here is some info about the Helmets:  About the Tactical Helmet  , It makes no difference whether the player character is shot in the face or in the Tactical Helmet; the result is always the same and:   The first shot will take 15750 durability from the Tactical Helmet, leaving it with 9250 durability. It will result in the player character receiving no damage to health provided the helmet was 25000 durability to begin with. The second shot will take 5827 durability from the Tactical Helmet, leaving it with 3423 durability. It will result in the player character recieving 66% damage to Health, leaving them with 34% Health. The third shot will take 2047 durability from the Tactical Helmet, leaving it with 1376 durability. It will result in the player character recieving 91% damage to Health, leaving them with 9% Health.   So the Bambi will need 3 head shots in order to kill you if you have Tactical Helmet with max durability. You have all the time needed to kill him first with any fire arm."

h1z1,3dw46t,keichler,0,Tue Jul 21 03:24:43 2015 UTC,"Your saying Kos'ers have no courage is laughable.    I didn't said every KOSer got no courage, I said THE ACT of Killing someone On Sight takes no courage, ESPECIALLY when you kill new spawns.  There are  Kos'ers who will  engage into shootout bigger groups even if outnumbered, and in THAT scenario they got COURAGE (still less than engaging into conversation with that big group instead), but there is nothing courageous in the ACT of KOSing new spawns.   As I said it is your way of playing the game, the safest one, the easiest one, where the risk is waaaay much lesser compared to the other play styles. And in NO WAY it's  the badass play style."
h1z1,3dw46t,ChinaIsFree,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:09:28 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. But my main reasoning for not kosing is because this isn't a FPS game. If everyone kos, then this is not a survival and it is a fps game. People say that killing helps survive. That is true some of the time. But most kos moments are not really about survival and are more about the actual kill. And I've never actually hated being killed by another player. I hate when I'm walking up to a car and I'm shot by a silent player when I clearly had nothing. Or if someone attacks me and when I run, they chase me down. That isn't survival. That's playing a FPS"
h1z1,3dw46t,ChinaIsFree,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:16:14 2015 UTC,"EXACTLY!!! Right on the point.  How does help you survive killing a new spawn that has nothing on it? it is the reverse cuz you are wasting ammo.   I was testing stuff, so I was wandering around with noting on me, not a satchel not a makeshift bow nothing, just the things you start with. And when groups would  noticed me they would start chasing me. I would bonny hope to make them waste ammo but they would eventually murder me even even if I was begging them to leave me alone and tell them I have nothing on  me.   Some groups even would use to bows to save ammo, and they would just miss and miss until after few minutes they got annoyed and I got shotgunned in the back.  Even more absurdly people who are not fully geared up would waste all of theirs ammo on me and hunt me down with melee till I would eventually die to bleeding. That is just plain wrong, you just wasted all your ammo to gain nothing and risk not having ammo when you will really need it to defend your self? da fuq?  As you said that isn't survival ,that is playing an unbalanced shooter game where not every body is equal. At least in other shooter games everybody has firearms and ammo."

When a car blows up, any of the locations around the map have a chance to spawn said random vehicle.  Time frame, no idea. If I had to guess, I'd guess nearly, if not, instantly."

Cars will not spawn exactly where the spawn points are shown but rather in the general area. I play on low pop servers and can find 3 or 4 cars at any given time. There are HUNDREDS of car spawn locations. As to where they will spawn next, I believe they spawn in areas that dont have a lot of cars nearby. Just from my experience. Today I cruised through Rancho and found 2 jeeps and 3 trucks, two of which had full parts. If you look at any of the online maps there arent 5 car spawn ""points"" in rancho.

Of course you did something illegal to get me killed. That's the mindset of someone that can't come to terms with ""maybe he did something better? Maybe he was quicker? Better weapon/build/setup?"". They can't come to terms with them sucking or "" get gud"", so they throw lame and baseless accusations of hacking/cheating. Happens in every MMO PvP, and its nothing to worry about if you got nothing to hide. Let them cry, the tears will sustain you."

I kind of took a break while I ask on Reddit if anyone has a solution for this. I found something online about changing my PhysX to use my GPU instead of my CPU.

LOVE IT!!! :D  I had similar idea:  you have 1 life along with the rest of the players and once the server (or game mode) has started others can't join. The last 10 players alive if have survived 1 or 2 full season rotation get rewards. It should be harsh environment where players need to team up to survive. One should be farmer, other beekeeper, construction worker, gunsmith, doctor etc.  Check it out:  https://www.reddit.com/r/h1z1/comments/3djhkf/discussion_ultimate_survival_v_01_rule_set_for/  it is in part 2, chapter IX."
h1z1,3dtmjb,DallaEllune,2,Sun Jul 19 13:44:31 2015 UTC,"This is a really cool idea. Reminds me of some browser games I used to play, where you would team up with other players to conquer the server. Then it would shut down and you could start on a new server."

H1Z1 is an infant being nursed to life with the threat of impending doom due to hackers, Dayz players, and people getting so fed up being killed by players it's virtually no longer fun to play.  Is this something I wouldn't mind seeing AFTER post beta (official) release. Sure, give it a shot. But as it currently stands for the next year and a half or so it takes for official release we will need to focus on bug's/glitches, GETTING A FLIPPING ANTI CHEAT SYSTEM PLACED!, utilizing game play features, crafting options, etc. I.E.

It was just an idea I had, but actually I do see the major flaw in my logic. I was only thinking of myself and my friends I play with, I never considered new comers. IF weren't for that, this would be perfect. I guess the only way around it would be to get 50/100 or x amount of hours in battle roayale or a low pop server."
h1z1,3dx50w,kpd157,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:04:29 2015 UTC,I think Hackers play alot longer than Legit Players do sometimes.   Perhaps the problem is that like I said above the amount of hours you play in a game has no bearing on being concidered a Veteran.  Like you said 50 to 100 hours in a game mode that is basically PVP or a Low Pop Server which I assume is PVP as well makes you as likely to be a Veteran of H1Z1 as much as a guy playing 1600 plus hours on a PVE High Pop Server.   If you can define a number some person you concider not to be a Veteran or a Hacker can meet it :)  But Anyway Keep On Looking For Ways To Improve The Game It Is The Root Of Why We Post To This Reddit :)

h1z1,3dvgnv,EpicHuggles,2,Sun Jul 19 23:27:32 2015 UTC,It's frankly getting out of control. What's most confusing to me is why the hell can more than 1 person get into a vehicle on SOLO BR. There is absolutely no acceptable reason that should be allowed.
h1z1,3dvgnv,gandiesel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:39:49 2015 UTC,"I don't see the issue with it?  If the goal is the be the last man standing it seems like banding together with a few people would be the logical thing to do. Plus it adds a sense of anxiety in the fact that it's not a question of if someone will betray you, but when.   Don't berate me here since I see that it isn't a popular opinion, in fairly new to the game and especially new to BR just an opinion from a noob."

The problem I have is people who are friends that team together BEFORE the game in SOLO BRs (Since you know your friend isn't going to shoot you until the end). It's just unfair. ESPECIALLY teams of 2 since there a specific mode MADE FOR THESE PEOPLE. UGH."

h1z1,3dvq6t,HaniiBlu,0,Sun Jul 19 22:51:27 2015 UTC,Sure it does if we were part of a Military Experiement and we were subjects who had a limited immunity :)  I highly suspect that to be the case and it makes sense with how the game plays so far.    Another thing I want to add is that from 1 to 15% you should take no energy burn or have any adverse effects from the Virus.  After 15% till 31% we should take the normal effects we see from 1% to 31% :)  Think About This As A Way To Make Zombies More Dangerous And Medicine More Nescissary :)  PS what I am proposing is not new its what we would call a Possible 2nd Iteration of the Zombie Virus Progression.  As the Devs have stated the Zombie Virus is in its first Phases of Developement and we will probably see more changes to it.  This is just hopefully a good idea for the 2nd Iteration :)

Sometimes they are alone people thats why it can be even 8 or 9 teams and thats why you won't get any awards.

In my example i died and left my friend alone vs other guy from other team. We won and we got our awards, same happened when we ended top 3. What i said is that seeing 10 people alive doesn't mean you are in top 5 because they can be alone people around here because their friend died as well.  It just doesn't give reward when your friend leave the ending screen or crash (my friend just crashed and i made it top 2 but there was no reward) and thats what should be fixed."

Not saying to make it easy to make them go, but they all have their own issues.   There is a ton of griefing going on with the roads getting blocked (which is kinda cool and makes things interesting) and cars pop like soap bubbles in garages...honestly... with only a small amount of cars being available... it's not good for collecting data.

Hate the idea of weather and fog with the current cheating issues, but lots of new base building stuff would breath new life into the game for me. In general I wish core game play issues and content involving base building  and zombies will get polished out sooner rather then later. I hope they balance out and expand on crafted items like wooden barricades, and make them more of an option other then one story houses.  I also hope they start dedicating resources to reworking the zombie threat/difficulty/spawn system. I'm sick of getting every single zombie in the area on my D regardless of how stealthy I am, also they apparently  possess 'Star Trek' warp technology as we all know. This is not immersive and promotes run and LOS play styles.  Not only that, zombies are extremely easy to deal with whether you kill them or lose them. You can murder an entire horde of zombies efficiently with a small shack and a few punjis.  What exactly is the point of ten thousand zombies spawning and chasing you, if they can't kill you anyway? This is literally the current system."

h1z1,3dwrho,Batchiii,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:46:15 2015 UTC,"I'm a fan of as close to realism as possible. Even though I really do believe this is a silly notion all around, I don't like the idea that the hoodie covers the motorcycle helmet. The thing is massive, your hoodie cannot cover it like that.  The Tactical Helm, maybe. Its fairly small in its current state of design, I think it could be hidden under a hood easy enough.   For the sake of realism, I would agree with the OP. I would like clothing to properly display or show signs of irregularities underneath or in this case, altering the model altogether to accommodate other equipment, even though in most cases it'll simply be for cosmetic purposes for the player wearing the clothing, most of the PvP combat happens so quickly or far enough away you couldn't tell anyways."

h1z1,3dwrho,Batchiii,2,Mon Jul 20 04:44:27 2015 UTC,"I.. guess... but with how difficult it actually is to headshot with Bow and Arrows, is this really a valid concern? Between aiming well, travel time, and of course how much the target is moving, it isn't the same as headshotting with a gun.   I think if you actually have a chance to headshot with a Bow, you'll have enough time to logically determine whether or not this character is geared enough in other slots to assume they have a helmet."
h1z1,3dwrho,Jgage01,3,Mon Jul 20 04:51:06 2015 UTC,"still it is a design flaw, if the game is going for realism survival you shouldn't be able to not see a piece of gear on someones head."

Alpha is all about laying the foundations of the finished game and that is what DBG is doing right now. Adding in base systems that later on when they start the Beta they will begin giving all these features the polish they need for launch. I personally like to play every other wipe that way I don't get to burned out.

h1z1,3dsd9e,DallaEllune,0,Sun Jul 19 12:54:44 2015 UTC,"I don't know, populations in games are not necessarily dependent on how much people enjoy the games.  It might come as a surprise to us as more ""hardcore"" gamers, but a lot of people buy games and play them for what I  would consider a very short amount of time.  As a funny piece of anecdotal evidence I was playing AC: Black Flag on a friend's Xbox 360 a few years back.  He just got the game and when you earn achievements the game tells you the % of players that have that achievement.  We got to around the middle of the storyline, probably 10-15 hours in, and were told that we were in the 80th percentile of players.  That likely means that... 80% of the population that bought the game played it for less than 10-15 hours.  I was floored, that seemed really ridiculously low to me. This was a fully developed product in a big franchise by a big company, not an unfinished game undergoing development.  We like to think that 1 million copies sold means 1 million people should be playing, but that's insanity.  I like the game, it's okay- it's doing well, good updates.  But I really don't want to play this game right now.  I'll play it in a bit, once I'm missing it."
h1z1,3dsd9e,Quigleyer,2,Sun Jul 19 17:01:17 2015 UTC,"Yeap I agree with everything you said, and i am aware of everything you said. I will just add this opinions in my defense:  from 1 million only 20 000 are left, and the majority of those are ok with the death match arena with some zombies  that h1z1 is now. If there are more game mechanics or if take make rule set that make h1z1 actual survival game there will be plus around 20 000 player, even more when the game becomes free to play.  what I am saying is this:   the majority of the current player base is form by players who want more shooting less hard core surviving and the current servers and all the modes (BR, HC BR, BR 2-5) allows them to do exactly that. They are the majority of the current player base, not the potential one, not the one has stooped playing because didn't find what they want.  Without introducing new stuff Daybreak won't get new players or make some of the non active player base return and this is a fact.  Will they continue to please the majority of the current active player base with new ways of killing people and zombies or they will add new survival game mechanics is up to the devs."

You're right- right now the player base is made up of people who don't want to play this game as many people who originally bought this game do.  The people who continue playing are the ones who enjoy the current way the game is being held together- and that's probably not good for a game receiving feedback in early development.  Never thought about it that way before.  I wonder if I'll play this game again... I got another similar game that is very survival focused (7 Days to Die) and it's going to take a lot to get me to try H1Z1 again over playing 7 Days, which already pretty much has the elements I want in it."
h1z1,3dsd9e,Quigleyer,2,Sun Jul 19 18:08:36 2015 UTC,Lets just hope that the devs one day will have the resources necessary   to make h1z1 a real survival zombie game.  I think should try 7 Days to Die.
h1z1,3dsd9e,DallaEllune,4,Sun Jul 19 18:36:30 2015 UTC,"7 Days is a great experience!  It does feel a bit easier if you survive two weeks, but week 1 is VERY brutal.  After a while the progression ceiling is hit (took me to day 52 this time, about 50 hours) and you can kind of ""game"" the zombies with your base.  The developers are actively making the game harder and trying to counter-balance these tactics, but it does take time.  Right now I highly HIGHLY recommend that game to H1Z1 players.  The survival experience is a lot more tense.  base building in that game is ten fold what it is in H1Z1 (voxels, so you can even dig), and you can supe up pre-fab houses (something that H1Z1 really needs for that zombie survival experience)."
h1z1,3dsd9e,Quigleyer,2,Sun Jul 19 18:42:31 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, I jumped from H1Z1 to 7 Days to Die and haven't looked back since in alot of ways. I found a great server where cooperation and trade is the core goal, and turning a POI town into a defendable ""Alexandria"" is the main focus.   It is an actual Zombie Survival game, not a Sandbox Shooter pretending to be something else."
h1z1,3dsd9e,InfectedHeisenberg,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:14:37 2015 UTC,"I stopped playing for the time being because I was tired of being kos'd at every turn.

h1z1,3dsd9e,Sevv09,2,Sun Jul 19 07:01:54 2015 UTC,mostly i hear that people didnt get an answer after they send there application ! And a lot of people saying the server is dead! Pretty sad!
h1z1,3dsd9e,Brainbloggerr,0,Sun Jul 19 16:00:12 2015 UTC,"They cycled the apps letting in some people first with a secondary process happening now. Many people also applied saying ""I want away from the hackers"" and no other reason for wanting to join. If you can't take 5 mins to write an application then I don't see why they should take a chance. Population wise, it was gated very slowly which gave the super low pop feeling at the start. Add in the quick turn wipe cycles to add to that problem, as of recent the population is stable but smaller with more people coming back and arriving each day. Still a smaller community but growing each day unlike many other servers."

h1z1,3dsd9e,DallaEllune,8,Sun Jul 19 01:56:14 2015 UTC,Yes it is the most beneficial way but also the  easiest play style as FRANKIEonPCin1080p said:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s96Hi-44Fp4&feature=youtu.be&t=472
h1z1,3dsd9e,erich3983,4,Sun Jul 19 01:26:54 2015 UTC,"Great explanation in that video and spot on. There is no consequence to KOS and things/life in H1Z1 mean nothing at all. You'll just quickly respawn and within 30 mins be geared again. Bullets and guns are way too abundant so, again, there are no consequences of just ""wasting"" bullets on fresh spawns with little-to-no rewards, other than simply seeing how big your e-dick can get. Hopefully this upcoming professions system will evolve so much so that people will need other people in this game. Wouldn't that be a change of pace? =O"

The hardcore people the game would be much harder to survive and killing zompbies would need more of the clans attention than KOS would. Like he said the idea would be when you see a person alive you would be more willing to ask them to help you then to want to hurt them, because if it where harder to survive you'd want all the help you could get. Not all the kills you could get, call of duty style. If that kind of thing is fun for you then I ask why aren't you just playing call of duty instead? its much better at combat than this game"

h1z1,3dsd9e,Brainbloggerr,2,Sun Jul 19 13:10:55 2015 UTC,we probably help with our data they collect! We maybe help and dosent even notice that we helped!  Like the last stress test.! Same with Test servers! You also help when you report a bug!

h1z1,3dsd9e,keichler,3,Sun Jul 19 13:46:13 2015 UTC,Exactly. So I'm not insane. YES!
h1z1,3dsd9e,deathwhitch,-2,Sun Jul 19 13:55:02 2015 UTC,"yes but repairing it suggest its already built and cant be changed  helping me ""shape"" something would still make it mine, but would have you influence on it and would effect the final product.   we're not testers in this game. we're suckers. They will continue to ignore 90% of the suggestions and focus on everything I can to keep the BR players/crate key buyers (streamers) happy. Because they are the ones making them money. Core game at this point is an afterthought"
h1z1,3dsd9e,keichler,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:23:54 2015 UTC,"You're under the assumption that because you paid $20 for a game that it gives you a right to shape it as you put it. Unfortunately not as your 20 does not buy you a slice of pie. They can choose to not develop this game today. Or they can turn it into CSGO. They own the game and have allowed us to have input. Up to them whether or not they choose to listen. Same with your car. I could tell you what it needs but it is your decision. Your car.   Granted I can see their side but alas I am not on it. The road this game is going down is unfortunate. They still have time to right the ship. I just don't think they will. Realistic, not pessimistic."
h1z1,3dsd9e,PinkestCougar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:34:45 2015 UTC,"As you can tell by the player count, the developers are not supreme masters of the universe that can just do whatever they want.

h1z1,3dsd9e,keichler,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:43:02 2015 UTC,Well I had been upvoting you but your attitude sucks for us being in agreement on 99% of things.   You're misinterpreting the word help to mean so much more than what it does. Help simply means pay $20 to play the game. Nothing more.
h1z1,3dsd9e,deathwhitch,-3,Sun Jul 19 13:51:59 2015 UTC,"I'll just quote from them so you can understand why I expected the word help to mean more than ""give me money""  Again from the steam store page:  ""we want to transform the way our players interact and participate with our games. H1Z1 Early Access will be your chance to experience and make a difference in H1Z1 as it evolves throughout the development process. . . ""  "". . . Early Access is designed for those wishing to support the ongoing development of H1Z1 and be a part of shaping its future and allows us to develop H1Z1 side-by-side with our players.""  and this last part is the part where I got that ""assumption"" that my feedback would matter and they where interested in more than just my money  "". . . H1Z1 will continue to grow and evolve throughout development, and features will be refined and adjusted based on player feedback""  i meant no attitude, I was only responding to yours. Had I known 90% of the feedback I see players giving on here would have been ignored during the dev process I would not have given them my money, as I bought into this for the chance to help the devs with my feedback, not with my wallet. A promise that is clearly made on the store page and used to influence my purchase. I made no assumptions, I simply read the description in its entirety"
h1z1,3dsd9e,keichler,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:03:38 2015 UTC,I have no attitude. Only a desire to see all sides of an issue.   When I read that originally 5 months ago or so I just thought BS. I think you're reading into it too much. A lot of games promise somewhat the same.   We can go into the agreement clauses where it pretty much negates that whole blob of crap up there. It would be a little naive to read that and think they would be able to make a game AND read thousands of suggestions AND then implement those.   And speaking of naivity...basically we are doing what that says. Feedback incorporates bugs and game breaking issues. They DO respond to those and in that sense our help is being utilized.   In the end that mess was written very well by a PR guy or lawyer. It is mostly BS and I thought we all kinda knew that. I never bought into h1 under the belief they would listen to ANYTHING I had to say. So far I've been right...they haven't listened to me at all. But those were my expectations after reading the early access garbage.
h1z1,3dsd9e,itsemptydog,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:21:56 2015 UTC,"Maybe they just don't like the feedback. Maybe most people are coming forward with shit ideas. Maybe it means exactly what it says ""features will be refined and adjusted on player feedback."" It doesn't mean features will get introduced based on player ideas. It means that if enough people complain about the damage of a certain weapon, or the weapon's reticle, they may make adjustments.  You read the description, you didn't comprehend it."

h1z1,3dsd9e,FreaKtmnz,7,Sun Jul 19 02:08:21 2015 UTC,he thinks he is hardcore.... probably isnt thou...most likely 1000 of those hours are from sitting at the launcher whilst he is at school.  I say this because of the wild mistruths about what the rest of the map contains.... seems like hes spent 100 hours in PV and 1 hour the rest of the map .... another 999 sitting at the launcher.  like he said the police station in cranberry isnt as good cause theres no basement .... never bothered to notice it has an armory upstairs where the PV one doesnt... Facepalm at 1000 hours in the launcher newbs
h1z1,3dsd9e,Sevv09,3,Sun Jul 19 03:01:20 2015 UTC,"Actually the Cranberry Police station sucks in comparison to the PV one, the amount of lockers alone and the average loot pulled out from each location doesn't compare. The most important thing he may not understand is that you never need to live near any town, each area on the map has a nice set of resources and spots some players don't know how to capitalize on."
h1z1,3dsd9e,Sea_Moss,0,Sun Jul 19 06:54:08 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the armory kinda sucks. But so does the PV police station in my opinion. I can find more weapons and ammo in many different places."

Secondly they chased off hardcore players by not addressing problems that affected people who play head shot only.  Third they should not take advice from anyone who does not play hardcore( pvp or pve but preferably pvp) as if you are not playing hardcore pvp you are not actually playing the full game.  And there for how do you call yourself a ""alpha tester"" as so many do?  Wow I have been waiting so long to say that.  Feels good to have it off the chest.  Shall we begin the down voting?

But hardcore is by far the most painful to play on"
h1z1,3dsd9e,PinkestCougar,0,Sun Jul 19 13:06:36 2015 UTC,"So you are better at giving PVE feedback, just because you play the game in 1st person - hardcore mode?  Okay great.

h1z1,3dsd9e,THESEVENSGUY,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:43:28 2015 UTC,"There is a bit of validity to trying a minimal amount of of the other rule sets, for example how would the devs have known all you had to do was stand next to a shelter in third person and pan around to see through the roof to see which shelter had the crates in it, you could only find that by playing third person.  There are bugs that you will only see if you play hard core.  But if you want to test something don't you need a large number of people playing by the full rules of the game?  And then actually listen to them when they say something is wrong, or potentially not working as intended."
h1z1,3dsd9e,PinkestCougar,0,Sun Jul 19 15:25:54 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I mean you came out and said they should only listen to people playing hardcore.  My reply was they should probably listen to the respective players, pve players for pve etc."
h1z1,3dsd9e,Trickyninja420,2,Sun Jul 19 16:22:31 2015 UTC,This post is why I want hard mode servers so all the whiners who want the game to be so hard you die 4 seconds after spawning can get their rocks off and leave the sane people in the rest of the servers alone.

I don't consider myself a hardcore player as you put it. But I play H1Z1 quite a bit and watches streams a lot. Mostly BR, but still. So just because you have so many more hours than others doesn't mean you're more right about stuff. That's probably the word that caused most hate in here.   Issues I can see:   Big clans locking huge areas down, harassing new players trying to get a base built.  The no risk no loss situation of people sitting in their base sniping travelers. There's literally no downside for the snipers and no gain for the travelers. You can kill them, but their loot is safe in the base. Make it drop outside the base! Cheaters, but this one is obvious and not easy to just fix.    I think the loot might be a problem, I wouldn't know cuz I haven't been able to base around PV. But building elsewhere have been just fine, loot is a bit stale, but that's how it should be. You shouldn't get 100 round in 15 minutes of looting.  Also the only chance of meeting friendly people is when you have no weapons on you. Especially if you run into a clan."
h1z1,3dsd9e,Mollelarssonq,0,Sun Jul 19 08:55:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah brother, I'm one of those clans.... WE kiled every clan there was to kill, and curently are siting on 2000+bullets in our base inside of Pleasant valley, and I have no risk for having one inside of PV.  80% of the players I meet scream ""friendly dont shoot"" People should man up.. get gear. But thats the problem. You can only get gear in PV. Thats if My clans not taking over the city. This game needs balance.  And it's all because I abused the broken mechanic this game offers. build a base in PV with lookout towers and have 0 risk of death/base raids."
h1z1,3dsd9e,Brainbloggerr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:35:18 2015 UTC,"Well. You killing everyone you see is not something the devs can fix, that's up to people themselves. They should make loot drop outside the base when you die in it though.  Apart from that i don't see a problem. you can get loot outside PV it's just a bit harder, as it should be overall. From your explanation it just sounds like PV has ridiculous amount of loot for no reason."

I'd guess they don't have anywhere near as many devs as most people think they have and are working their butts off to get us the little bit we have seen in the last 7 months. Doesn't help either that SOE didn't get purchased outright by a company that would've actually invested significantly more funds into development. And all because Smed wanted to keep his job.

h1z1,3dsd9e,dontshootiamfriendly,3,Sun Jul 19 13:16:12 2015 UTC,"^ this. Zombie spawning, the heat agro system, all of it is terrible. If you're the only one in a city, or anywhere with high pop zombies, they will begin spawning around you. Within 5 minutes of being in any of the three cities alone, pretty much every zombie will have spawned and gravitated towards you. You can hide in the tallest building with every door closed, crawl around prone, they still agro to you.  IDC what some pve newb spouts in this reddit, this zombie system is terrible in every possible way."
h1z1,3dsd9e,Mollelarssonq,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:46:29 2015 UTC,The loot spawns are too frequent and too much loot is available. Loot needs to spawn less frequently in order to make it a challenge. Once you have looted one area you should not be able to get anything from it for a while.. Encourage people to venture outside where they feel safe. Force them into the larger towns/cities and then that increases PVP action for those that like it. Food should be more of an issue also
h1z1,3dsd9e,dontshootiamfriendly,-1,Sun Jul 19 00:49:11 2015 UTC,"No, because if you do that you are actually taking from the game, Less loot=less killing=less things to do.  make it a chellenge... balance the loot, increase zombie difficulty in numbers/AI/Responsiveness.

Every clan, group of sissies automatically KoS even when they see a guy with a dusty white tee, blue striped tee with nothing on.   The op is guaranteed to a persistent offender of this. Why kill people automatically. If they haven't shown aggression towards your base or you?   Worn Letters are about the only ""side quest"" we have.

It's the only challenging/entertaining element to the game after you've built a base and filled it with gear and ammo.   As to killing players that obviously have nothing, I do it because:  A) It's still more fun than slowly collecting more gear I already have plenty of, or killing zombies that drop nothing.  B) They might have friends who they will call, resulting in an actual fight. With any luck they'll try to build in our area and we can have an ongoing turf war."

If a freshy runs past me, he/she will be fine, but have a big gap."
h1z1,3dsd9e,DallaEllune,2,Sun Jul 19 09:00:15 2015 UTC,"Exactly. This is generally the same policy my clan have. People complain about KoS from clans, but most of them are solo players who don't realise that 90% of the time geared players will try and take shots at us in our base, so it's just safer to KoS.   New spawns that we don't recognise generally are fine unless they start chatting shit or whatever."
h1z1,3dsd9e,MrCalamiteh,0,Sun Jul 19 11:24:43 2015 UTC,Well that is the conundrum. You kill on sight. People don't want to play. You're left looking silly.   I know at times there are times that warrant it. Though t b at is a whole lot O typing.

Oh and btw the those you kill on sight are ones who can't support the tension you get when talking to fully gear up player. They are the ones afraid. They are the ones who can't risk their in game life in order to try to reach a greater good like forming bigger group or stmg.  If you can't understand why aiming and shooting at some one is easier than engaging in a conversation with stranger that could be potential threat..."

Even when the Gouvner come with a fuking tank, Rick went alone to face him in a conversation. If Rick was one of the KOSer, he would start shooting first or retreat because they are outnumbered.  It takes courage not to KOS. But how the players that think are badassescuz it killed new spawn with a sniper rifle, could possibly know what  courage is?  Killing unarmed person is like kililng a civilian, do you think solders fell as bad asses if they kill civilinas?"

h1z1,3dsd9e,Sea_Moss,0,Sun Jul 19 01:43:44 2015 UTC,"It's a pretty good video. But even he comes to the natural conclusion that it's not going to work. He skirts around it in the end.   He says the way to get players to KOS less is to give other players more value than their loot. With important profession bonuses, for instance. That's a good idea, but playing with friends from real life or another game completely invalidates it. I'll get into the game, meet up with them, and since there is nothing to do except build a base and fill it with stuff(the quickest way being to kill other players) we're going to go hunt some people.   Implementing some messy mechanic like a randomly chosen locked in skill set to force people to play with strangers is just absurd. It would just drive players away. Some players aren't going to play with strangers no matter what. Other players have a dedicated group of friends they play games with. They aren't going to play a game that they can't play with their friends. I'm in both of those groups. If I can't play as a lone wolf or with a group I organize outside of the game, I'm not going to play.   Making the game harder to push people together isn't going to reduce KOS. It's just going to kill the game. Trying to make other people valuable in some way isn't going to reduce KOS. It's probably not going to matter much at all.  Giving players something to do other than collect loot and kill players is what will reduce KOS."
h1z1,3dsd9e,DallaEllune,-1,Sun Jul 19 02:33:16 2015 UTC,"I agree  with everything you said.   The professions systems alone in no way will reduce KOS.   I am  afraid  that making the game harder, even along with the professions system won't reduce KOS because big groups of friends will have every team member for every class needed so they will keep kosing as usual.   The only thing that will reduce KOS is if some negative effects from killing people are implemented. Not the karma system but some negative impact on the sanity of the character. Many don't like this idea, but it could work as a rule set.  After all, managing your sanity is just another aspect of surviving in a post apocalyptic world.

h1z1,3dsd9e,Gadreuw,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:56:19 2015 UTC,"Your post on ways to reduce KOS is not ""simple"". It is very complex. Some of the points you make would be extremely difficult to calculate or require systems that don't exist.  You would need systems that track who does damage to whom, systems that not only track the items a player has but is constantly communicating this information to everyone else, an unimplemented trading system, a system that keeps track of who you killed and determines the relationship between them and everyone else, just to list a few.  Realism in games is nice, but only to a certain point. It would be realistic to have to tie my shoe from time to time and brush my teeth twice a day, but that wouldn't add anything to the game and would probably become annoying very quickly.  Not trying to give you a hard time. Just pointing out some flaws I see in your old post that you have pushed four times already."
h1z1,3dsd9e,Sea_Moss,0,Sun Jul 19 03:51:19 2015 UTC,"The idea is simple, the process of turning that idea into reality it is not, and I am aware of it.  It is just a suggestion, the devs could make much more simpler model for ex (it is just an example)    you kill someone  you lose 100 sanity you kill someone that hasn't firearms on him you lose 300 sanity,  with even simpler negative effects,    and maybe when they have time and resources, will resume working on it more in depth  BTW   a system that keeps track of who you killed ,    simple log of events will do, smtg similar to the report last death they already have, the log could be checked when needed   You would need systems that track who does damage to whom   they already have that (for anti cheating purposes), if they don't have it is another simple log of events,    systems that not only track the items a player has but is constantly communicating this information to everyone else   only to those near you, and not the whole inventory, only for few  pre determent items (firearms). But w8  that system already exist. You are now able to see the weapon other players carry right? So it means  there is a system that tracks the firearms a player has and is constantly communicating this information to the players in their visual range.   unimplemented trading system   ok they don't have it, but because evey MMO game has it I don't think the process of making it is a very complected one   determines the relationship between them and everyone else,    Determinating the relationships between player is already implemented we have the group system right? and the steam friend list  Not trying to say you are wrong, it is complex system and it will require many work hours, just pointing out some flaws about your list of examples about it's complexity.   It would be realistic to have to tie my shoe from time to time and brush my teeth twice a day, but that wouldn't add anything to the game and would probably become annoying very quickly.   well that is just wrong example, i never said i want full realism, of course it is a game and it needs to have limits. And the sanity system will add much to the game - less KOS  And I will push this old post of mine to reddtitors that think like me, as much as I can until some of the devs notice it."
h1z1,3dsd9e,InfectedHeisenberg,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:46:38 2015 UTC,"While I agree with most of your examples, I also disagree with a lot of them too.  IMO this game is not ment to be played every day in the state it is in.  So a hardcore player is going to want certain things to be finished in the order that fits their play style but aren't necessarily good for the progress of the game.  It seems the devs want to make as much content as they can before fully finish and polish the content.  Im not sure if this is good or bad at the moment but we will all find out in the end I guess.  I agree their is to much loot spawns but I think that is because this game is being tested, even on the live servers, so a casual player would not be able to test much with the little time they have.  I play on low or med pop servers and I agree they should consolidate a few.  I prefer a low pop server because once the map becomes big enough, you shouldnt see people very often, just as on a low pop server.  I disagree that all the big towns should have the same loot because this makes for more points of interest.  Some people want to avoid other players at all cost so they wouldn't go to PV but instead they would go to a smaller city.  A smaller city doesn't have the same loot/time capabilities as PV but they can still get the job done. People play the core game like its a BR so why not make guns which can be used in both game modes.  I do not use guns much as I tend to stay in the woods and avoid people."
h1z1,3dsd9e,Sea_Moss,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:05:45 2015 UTC,"I also play on low pop because it doesn't feel like an apocalypse to constantly run into people. There should be some loneliness.  As far as the hardcore/shouldn't be played everyday bit, if I was making something, anything, but especially a video game, I would listen to the one guy who has put in 1,000+ hours than 1,000+ people who have put in one hour. Not only is that hardcore guy going to be the one who keeps coming back, but he is also the one who has seen everything. The one who has done everything. He knows the game. While you will get a bigger consensus from the 1,000+ group, they don't know anything except first impressions.  Think of it this way. If you wanted to learn something, would it be better to ask many novices or one master?"

The player that plays 1000+ hours likes the game enough to do so.  When a player who, as you say, played one hour and stopped playing, the reason they stopped playing could be the same things a hardcore player is demanding.  A hardcore player definitely knows more about the game and has done everything, and that's just it, a hardcore player stayed and played.  I feel the opinion of the player who left the game is just as important."

Eastwood Truck stop on the east side of the map, between Ranchito Taquito and Villas Development, for instance.  As a solo player I can, in one 15 minute loot run, gather 25-40 scrap metal, corn/wheat seeds, 10-30 pieces of ammo, pistols, rifles, shotguns, AR15s, AK47s, 4-10 bottles of water, 5-20 cans/pieces of food, 4-5 biofuel.  The loot is there in nearly every POI, the issue is that players do not LOOK. They run in, see what's visible, grab and go. However, if you slow down, and spend +3-5 seconds you will see that there are items hidden all over the places.

Ark has tons of content, it offers many things to do, and it actually fells as survival game. h1z1 it is just death match arena with zombies in it. Which is good game play but for a rule set.  What I am saying is the devs should focus more on giving h1z1 the survival feel (at least as a game mode or rule sets) in order to appeal also to player base who wants survival game, not shooter. They already have the sand box experience adapt for pvp shooting and the BR mods."

And as far as the zombies, I keep saying that they can be drastically improved by just increasing the times they grab you. They eat things. Why do they almost exclusively slap you? They should be biting. Grabbing guarantees a hit, slows you, and puts you in danger of the group. This makes melee against zombies much more difficult.  To help with KOS, they should have elements of the game that are impossible to do alone (or are at least very difficult). Then you would be looking for people because you need help and not because you want to kill them.  Also, late game starts almost immediately because there isn't anything you need that isn't super easy to get. Rabbit traps provide easy food with little material and no work. Dew collectors are the same. Even if you don't cook/boil them the health drain isn't a problem because bandages are easy to come by as well.  Guns are everywhere and so is ammo. Difficulty finding cars depends on the server pop. Gathering resources for base building is a bit tedious, but not difficult.  And this doesn't even cover all the little things that aren't necessarily an issue, but still don't make sense.  TLDR I agree with you. Zombies too easy. Not enough to do. Too easy to survive."

No.   It only took your ban 5 mins bc I'm betting 500 other players complained about the same guy. They finally got to it and you just saw a coincidence

Both times were by hackers though and both times were when we attracted them by doing a shit ton of airdrops by the base. We raid like two bases a night but have yet to have a problem with getting raided ourselves.
h1z1,3duyxp,Sea_Moss,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:46:52 2015 UTC,Seems like the further down the list you go the fewer people on the servers. Do a low pop server near the top of the list. I have been in low pop servers that were covered in people.
h1z1,3duyxp,ShamblingDead,3,Sun Jul 19 22:20:33 2015 UTC,"Are you moving locations? Are you improving your base in anyway other than to just replace the doors? Although it could be cheaters, you may just have a poorly designed base and they know how to jump in. If this is the case then you're basically just giving them lots of stuff for the low low cost of about 20 ieds.  Make the base much harder to enter. If you make it so it's not worth them expending the required ieds then they will move on. Or pick a new location that is far away from any loot spawns or pathways/main roads and you should be fine. I personally would take this as an opportunity to restart somewhere else (maybe even another server). Be a fresh spawn again, work hard for that shack with a metal door, gather back up all that cool stuff. You may just wind up having fun while you do it!"
h1z1,3duyxp,ShamblingDead,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:17:04 2015 UTC,i could imagine they could jump in yeah but i mean i think they should remove that one and then they only blow up the doors that have stuff in them i have multiple doors they know exactly which one it is. its annoying. im just salty
h1z1,3duyxp,Zombiewhisperer1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:01:37 2015 UTC,"Sounds like cheaters, but who knows. I would report your base location (with /loc), server name, and approximate raid timeframe to the h1z1 cheater email. They should be able to see if they were no clipping and ban them"
h1z1,3duyxp,AceKingSuited18,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:09:57 2015 UTC,"Basicly comes down to 2 options: 1 = jumping 2 = noclipping  They can use a car to ram the gate and jump on car and than the gate and hop inside, once inside they blow up the shelter door and exit base by lookout towers.  Do you have a large shelter hanging over the gate? if not it might be a case of jumping in the base by this method or by some dirty tricks/glitches.  and no clippers dont need to blow up a wall they can simply get in and out. So fix your gate issue make sure you have uper metal walls and use a large shelter hanging over the gate/behind it. (BTW when you log off take some valuable items with you just incase ;)  you can take all the ammo with you)"
h1z1,3duyxp,ShamblingDead,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:50:54 2015 UTC,Make upper walls and block off your gate with a roof. It's that simple.
h1z1,3duyxp,AceKingSuited18,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:01:23 2015 UTC,"The fact that they only target rooms with stuff inside means it probably is cheaters, unless they can see the health bars of the containers because they are too close to the shelter wall (don't know if that's a possibility). Therefore blocking off gate probably won't help. But I guess if he does that then it virtually assures him it's cheaters."
h1z1,3duyxp,GetDeleted,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:16:03 2015 UTC,With a roof you can still jump in but it takes an army of people.
h1z1,3duyxp,Cest7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:52:06 2015 UTC,"Yea the no clippers raiding is getting pretty annoying.  My friends and I have to fill our backpacks with shit before we log now because every day we get on our doors (only the one with chests in them) are blown off.  We also have crops that we haven't been able to harvest once because people clip in and harvest them.  Also my base has upper walls and even if they did manage to boost in with a bunch of people on a jeep or something, the crops they keep harvesting are on a tamper in the middle with no way back over the walls.  Server is Another Day.  It doesn't make the game unplayable for me, it just gets really annoying."

h1z1,3duyxp,Makoh1z1,0,Sun Jul 19 20:58:33 2015 UTC,"If they were clipping why wouldnt they just clip through the door as well. I have seen groups running around and stacking up 6-8 people to get over outside walls, then blowing the doors on the shelters. This isnt cheating its just a bad game mechanic being taken advantage of."

Plus when they get low people like me see a prime opportunity to waste 2-3 ieds to see what you have. I recommend to anyone reading to get at least a regular shack and metal door as fast as you can if you want to play the base game on a pvp server.
h1z1,3duwug,ShamblingDead,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:43:10 2015 UTC,Thanks four the tips! How do you tell how decayed a door is?

h1z1,3duwug,HaniiBlu,-1,Sun Jul 19 21:24:49 2015 UTC,What type of shacks? and are you on PVE or PVP? If PVP they probably got blown up.  Basic Shack Door ~ 1-week Wooden Door ~ 2-weeks Metal Door ~ 4-weeks (pretty sure this is bugged and decays in 2 weeks)
h1z1,3dvmv5,FuzzyCatballs,4,Sun Jul 19 22:20:01 2015 UTC,7.62 is bigger than .223 so it does more damage auto vs semi has no  effect on damage.
h1z1,3dvmv5,SPIDER3006,3,Sun Jul 19 22:44:11 2015 UTC,Ar is more easier to aim when shooting
h1z1,3dvmv5,ardaaytac,3,Sun Jul 19 22:50:57 2015 UTC,"Semi auto is more accurate, Ak47 uses a bigger bullet."
h1z1,3dvmv5,Ohhhshet,2,Sun Jul 19 22:55:19 2015 UTC,Yeah but none of that shit matters though really? It's a game and in every other game a gun that's permanently semi should always do more damage than a full auto. I hate it so much when people relate real guns to a game. Debating on bullet sizes but nobody wonders why they're finding ak's in bathrooms. Discussing velocity and bullet drop but a knife will kill a zombie quicker than an axe?
h1z1,3dvmv5,McNuggets025,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:22:43 2015 UTC,Perhaps in those other games they used the same logic. For example the hunting rifle is bolt action a type sort of semi auto and it kills in one shot almost every time which it should being that it shoots a .308 which is a longer jacketed 7.63x39.

It was supposed to ramp up.  Like one is louder but more durable (boots) Less durable and silent (barefoot) but you take more dmg to stuff(punji stick/etc.)  Dunno if its fully implemented how they wanted it.

h1z1,3dvfr4,ogurin,0,Mon Jul 20 05:53:57 2015 UTC,"What about H1Z1 would be taxing on a ps4 or Xb 1?  Currently, the engine just isn't running efficiently due to the numerous memory leaks and other assorted bugs.  Once that's all fixed, i'm sure it'll run just fine. Also, having a platform where you know everything is running the same hardware is really beneficial for optimization.  Where as with the PC you have to account for different drivers, processors and other shit that can mess the game up.  And finally, the number one reason they should bring it to consoles =  $$$$$$$$$"
h1z1,3dvfr4,ogurin,-2,Sun Jul 19 22:05:31 2015 UTC,nah it should shouldn't come to xbox one or ps4 it would make the developer focus on the console because they would get more money on it making they lazy on pc were the community is bit more careful with there money.

h1z1,3dqlfk,zenlon,4,Sat Jul 18 17:46:02 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more. At this point, I can walk into pretty much any town (particularly pleasent valley) and immediately know of 10+ static gun spawns.   I remember the coolest thing that ever happened to me in this game and it was a long, long time ago a month or two after H1's initial alpha release: I found a pistol and some ammo for it. I ran into a group of 3-4 people and one of them asked, ""do you think he has ammo for that?"" - to which I replied by firing the gun a few times in the air.   Having the gun, I called the shots in every respect. The group ended up asking to follow me, and rolled with me; having me as the boss, picking up others to join our group on our way.   We ended up with 8 or so of us that joined us - and I believe a large part of that was because I had a gun and guns were the ultimate protection back then, and so rare that if you did have a gun, you were not challenged.   TL;DR: A long time ago I found a pistol and ammo and controlled a squad of 8 players because guns were that scary and rare once upon a time."
h1z1,3dqlfk,Jollysixx,2,Sat Jul 18 17:54:27 2015 UTC,"That's what I love the most about this game that you can pick up all these people to have fun with.  My first time in Ranchito I think, I found about two AR spawns and a hunting rifle, when I saw people walking around that looked suspicious, I'd just tell them about the numerous weapons in the houses.  Used all those as a way to get to safety when a player was distracted with the guns."
h1z1,3dqlfk,wgewgwega,2,Sat Jul 18 17:57:49 2015 UTC,My group has so many guns we just melt them for sheet metal. I have like 3 storage containers just full of guns and finding anything other than a shotgun or M9 is meaningless.

h1z1,3dtt1e,rudie187,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:49:45 2015 UTC,"There is some timer or something for them -- every wipe, the first few stashes we built will disappear after a week or so. Some later ones stay longer but our first few decay and take their contents  with them. So we don't use stashes for permanent storage now.  Note that some disappeared that we hammered recently, so it doesn't seem to be a hidden decay problem as far as we can tell."

h1z1,3dtsv2,ZanicL3,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:46:52 2015 UTC,"The same for me. But i fixed it ""temporarely"". Before you go in Team Battle Royal, you need to join a Server, like Frankfurt (EU), or any other Server, where it loads the map. You can left directly after you join and start playing Battle Royal.  Thats how it worked for me."

h1z1,3dts5i,SkullSIR,3,Sun Jul 19 11:33:41 2015 UTC,Did one of you die and then disconnect? If yes then next time stay in the game after one of you dies. You should be able to get the prize that way.
h1z1,3dts5i,Hellmaze,0,Sun Jul 19 12:39:31 2015 UTC,"No, we waited until the server shutdown. The prize box showed up but nothing was inside it, I have a print screen if needed."
h1z1,3dts5i,Milfshaq,2,Sun Jul 19 13:00:22 2015 UTC,Yes. Probably not but it is this now. When everything runs fine u will get another price then in normal br

h1z1,3dts5i,thomas410,0,Sun Jul 19 12:29:02 2015 UTC,Your teammate has to stay in the game until the end. Sometimes it still glitches even when both players stay in I think.

h1z1,3du48j,DeaconElie,0,Mon Jul 20 15:38:00 2015 UTC,What you don't understand is that region locks DO NOTHING in reality. A person can easily bypass it via VPN and it's not possible to detect. Trying to implement a region lock is futile and a waste of time if it can easily be bypassed. This has already been stated more times over than what it should have been on here.

h1z1,3dsryc,MrRonniefar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:10:44 2015 UTC,I've experienced this lately aswell. Seems like its very important to have a fully flat ground in order to place your foundations and shelters. Probably to avoid the glitching through the ground tampers and what not which we had alot of trouble with in the past. I can still place ground tampers if i go to flat areas. Try go to the water its the flatest spot you will find. Hope this helps you.
h1z1,3dsryc,BEATE_SCHINKEL,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:20:44 2015 UTC,I agree with that flat area's  however I've noticed areas once accommodating are now restricted. Distance from other builders / groups are taken into consideration also.

It's been affirmed time and time again that they are NOT pay-to-win, so those who want to call them in on low pop servers, who cares if they have little resistance securing them?  There's probably only 5 people playing that server anyway.  If someone wants to pay $5 for mediocre building materials or a slight chance at a gun and some ammo you could gather in 5 minutes in PV, more power to them, and it shouldn't be restricted to population at all."
h1z1,3dqthg,Tatsuuuu,3,Sat Jul 18 16:50:19 2015 UTC,Pretty sure they can be called in on medium pop now

h1z1,3dqthg,keichler,5,Sat Jul 18 20:23:58 2015 UTC,They could introduce a lower tier airdrop ticket for low pop servers. Would be a way for them to make money and appease the players who frequent those servers.   Maybe it isn't as good as a high pop drop...or you can't call them with the same frequency. Some kind of downside to it since there wouldn't be much resistance securing the drop.
h1z1,3dqthg,AceKingSuited18,3,Sat Jul 18 15:56:07 2015 UTC,Yeah. Anything is more favorable than nothing.
h1z1,3dqthg,Mr_Roger,3,Sat Jul 18 16:18:42 2015 UTC,The regular airdrops are already pretty bad for how much they charge.
h1z1,3dqthg,AceKingSuited18,2,Sat Jul 18 18:35:06 2015 UTC,You can buy the tickets on the steam market for extremely cheap compared to their market

My point is they should not make shittier airdrops. If anything they should improve the airdrops. They should consolidate most of the low pop servers and leave a few for those who wish to play on low pop IMO."

h1z1,3dqthg,ChinaIsFree,4,Sat Jul 18 20:06:12 2015 UTC,Airdrops on a low pop server would give a higher chance to actually run into someone else!
h1z1,3dqthg,Wrel,2,Sat Jul 18 17:52:02 2015 UTC,I think it would be ok to use Air Drops in medium and low pop servers.  They're definitely not P2W.
h1z1,3dqthg,MyNameIsNurf,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:55:27 2015 UTC,"Easiest way to do this, in my opinion, would be to allow Air Drops when the server is near its average server population."
h1z1,3dqthg,_Blue_Waffles_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:33:53 2015 UTC,The low pop server I play on just about everyone knows eachother.

h1z1,3dtjs2,finitebees,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:20:20 2015 UTC,"The external doors were just metal doors, not gates. I can't see how they could manage to get over the double height walls, because of the slope of the land it was more like 3 levels high. @finitebees, no ramp, the door was the low point of the base floor, you had to jump into the doorway.  This was the most vulnerable part, but we also had an inner and an outer area, so this would only get them into the outer area, unless they could walk on the top edge of the walls to get around to the inner area? But who knows maybe they are very talented acrobats :)"
h1z1,3dtjs2,Easternmaxim,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:21:20 2015 UTC,Do you have a ramp? if so that is how they got in. Almost all bases can be jumped into if you know how.
h1z1,3dtjs2,finitebees,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:34:05 2015 UTC,Also people can drive vehicles up ramps and stack their characters up to get in.

h1z1,3dtjs2,Easternmaxim,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:55:46 2015 UTC,WE have found a way to prevent jump ins but nothing is going to stop someone with 100+ IEDS at 6am.  Ww just build multiple bases usually two mains and a base for each individual and we spread the loot around. If one base gets taken it takes about 5 minutes to get it up and going again and we still have plenty of ressources.

h1z1,3dr35q,Lsurah,2,Sat Jul 18 21:30:13 2015 UTC,I don't think /sit works does it? I thought pressing X to sit was technically an emote like F1 through F11.  highlighting a chair and pressing E seems like a better approach.  What you suggest is very unintuitive and it wouldn't take much to make every chair sittable as it would apply to all existing chairs in the world anyway.
h1z1,3dr35q,Lsurah,-1,Sat Jul 18 21:33:52 2015 UTC,"I meant it as a blanket statement, meaning if we use X to sit now maybe code a different button/letter to with a different animation as to sit in a chair or anything where you can let your legs hang over."

Gives you more incentive to go other places. Just like how building materials are best in ranchito. Gives you more incentive to go there

h1z1,3dtlgh,FreaKtmnz,0,Sun Jul 19 09:39:54 2015 UTC,"well my friend, it is another resource you now have to manage. you would be forced to loot more areas which puts you in more survival situations. also with the incoming implementation of the new medical facility, you will be able to find the ""cure"" for the virus and that could be a fun goal for people like you who don't like being bit. :P"
h1z1,3dtlgh,andrelopez360,0,Sun Jul 19 10:02:47 2015 UTC,"You should inform yourself better about the virus before creating a post like this. (It's still in process, it doesn't works like it is supposed to, give it some time, probably months.)  It makes no sense to start infected as you are a survivor already. (upcoming professions) EVERYONE would be looking for meds instead of food and shelter. No no no... You can only get infected by zombies biting you (which they DO right now if they grab you).   Hopefully in the future people will be able to infect others with infected arrows, knives or simply using syringes on each other. THIS would make it more survival-ish :D"

We moved to a whitelist server, which has actual hybrid anti-kos rules and the majority of us have had fun.   A system will potentially hurt the game if forced across all servers, however rule sets and custom rules find their way in to make non kos players happy."
h1z1,3dt7lz,xSergis,2,Sun Jul 19 07:12:11 2015 UTC,"Why attempt to limit KoS at all? I am confused as to why you would play any type of game with PvP in it then? I thoroughly enjoy PvP and the thrill of looting while having to be ninja stealthy! And if found, I love the challenge, win or lose... it is fun. This is what makes PvP games so much fun... it brings out the bandits, the heroes and everyone in between! So lets say you take away or limit KoS... what do you expect? People having to run up and ask if you would not mind scheduling a PvP match with them later on? ""Maybe we can meet at your base and fight each other?"" Nah man... what is the point of having any kind of PvP in the game at all then? If you roll on a PvP server... KoS/ganking is going to happen... it does in all games with open world PvP. I would recommend rolling PvE if you don't like it... or gear the heck up and kick some booty! :)"

We didn't ever build on a spawn point, however we were always near at least one (not anywhere close to render) due to being outnumbered by a large margin against other clans. We quickly started to notice that fresh spawns would come near our base trying to scout it out (obviously they have nothing to lose), usually got told to leave.   We started to track names and many of them would return after getting back to their bases and gearing up and attack us with friends, which in turn lead to us just killing these people who got within render of our base.   Spawn point protection (or build protection of these) would be something i could agree on."

Tip: To strafe far, dont rely on up and down directions. Use left and right. Face down and strafe at a 45deg angle roughly and you can strafe really really far in the parachute.   Example: You spawn at f6/f7 area. You can immediately turn towards south/southeast and make it to the de soto service stop/ the bottom southern road where more house clusters and cars spawn.  If you want to get good at the game and learned with the guns, I'd recommend keep spawning at PV, get a single gun and go hunting. Dont spend a lot of time looting more guns, or looting the dead bodies. Heal and move on. Get practice with the mainstay guns. AK AR Shotgun. Pistols only good as a first gun. Next learn the vehicle spawns. Soon you'll be winning BR's easy. Grab a car/gun and hunt for 20minutes. Win with 10-15 kills."

h1z1,3dqydn,Tenetri,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:23:05 2015 UTC,"Player Movement is not controlled or regulated by the server. Player movement is determined by the player's client. If you're cheating, and you 'cheat' your client that you're now on the other side of the map/wall, the server just believes you. The server never says ""Oh hey, you're not supposed to teleport 8 miles in a second, lets teleport you back into spot like DayZ"". Now this is where DayZ gets its 'Desync', if the server is controlling everyone's location, eventually the server will run out of resources to control everyones location and will start generating errors, like teleporting you outside of a 5 story building, and you falling to your death.  Its a give and take, either they stop no-clip, and players will desync-teleport everywhere, or the server can rely on the client 100%, and rely on player-reporting to catch cheaters."

Currently, bans are all done manually.  The only ""automatic"" bans that come out are IP/HWID if their system registers a banned user with another account; not a real anti-cheat measure.    They have a very small team doing this, and with the amount of reports that come in, it is impossible for them to ever catch up.  I'd estimate that at least 40% of the reports are not real, just sent in by butthurt people that either got outplayed, are suspect for no reason, or got cheesed.  In the current system, relying on the client 100% and falling back on player reports is a terrible method."

h1z1,3dqydn,TimmyLuvsU,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:58:36 2015 UTC,"Maybe I am missing something here and please someone chime in if I am, but why don't they just add locks to the storage containers? Make the containers penetrable, with explosives of course but it could allow us to make dummy rooms full or storage containers as players can only hold so many explosives. So if they noclip into your base, they still need the resources to gain access to containers. This gets rid of the ease of stealing peoples loot and would deter people from doing so as they only do it because it is easy. For the legit players make base demolition easier, but containers harder to get access into. If you think about it a house is easy to break into, but a safe takes much more resources and time. The game should reflect that idea."
h1z1,3dqydn,porkchopjorheto,0,Sun Jul 19 00:01:33 2015 UTC,"If you have the resources, you can replicate what my group and I did back when we were still playing.  Now, granted we always had at least 8 people on and we had a crew of around 15, but we made a large 3 x 4 ground tamper base, and loaded up EVERY room with the same amount of storage containers.  90% of the rooms were bone dry and had basically no loot; we each had individual rooms but did not store much there, and had a main loot room.    This way, since people who clip in can't proximity search your container, they have to play a guessing game, or systematically blow off every single door until they find some loot.  Either way, it would take them hours, or they would run out of resources."
h1z1,3dqydn,Tobax,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:25:00 2015 UTC,"The protection of storage lockers not being accessible inside a locked room is currently not working, so any no clipper could search through them just by standing next to them and seeing what shows up in local."

So no, there is nothing that they can do except manually ban offending players once they have proof.. Which is pretty rare."
h1z1,3dsdoq,Jonesy1977,2,Sun Jul 19 00:32:48 2015 UTC,"that information would be sent back to server? even if it is client side, they could add it in."

h1z1,3dpao2,africanjesus,6,Sat Jul 18 15:50:19 2015 UTC,"Looks like a lot of work and detail has been put into the hospital, cant wait to see it"
h1z1,3dpao2,xSergis,4,Sat Jul 18 04:16:45 2015 UTC,"so far it seems for a solo player medic profession wins right now  survival is irrelevant, repairing things faster is barely useful... although if the repairman will be able to restore wrecked vehicles, he'll be op as fuk"
h1z1,3dpao2,Brainbloggerr,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:59:29 2015 UTC,"i think its more op for big groups! Cause they can have  2 medics , 1 survivor and 2 repairman! And as a single player its still hard to fight against 5 people.. and when they have 2 medic which can heal the other faster and stuff like that.. its way more hard! I realy enjoy the lone wolf thing. i played a lot of other survival games in groups, but for now i realy enjoy playing alone!"
h1z1,3dpao2,xSergis,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:01:47 2015 UTC,yeah my favorite thing about h1z1 is that you can play solo without being... tenderly and hopelessly loved by groups  would suck to lose that

h1z1,3dsbpv,UltimateJim,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:05:06 2015 UTC,"Cheesy tactic? Tell that to any solo player wanting to build a base, it's damn near impossible to transfer things even a small distance sometimes...  But hey, I respect your opinion."
h1z1,3dsbpv,ChinaIsFree,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:14:46 2015 UTC,Cool I'm solo and i can build a base in a night without being a scrub and hiding behind a locked shack door to farm
h1z1,3dsbpv,gawgler,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:47:21 2015 UTC,"You just have to keep trying, it takes a lot of moving around and rotating the shack while you try to place it."
h1z1,3ds9xs,iPrey,2,Sat Jul 18 23:39:38 2015 UTC,"Really makes me wonder how the cars state/position is saved, surely this shouldn't be able to happen and it should always render on the stored location/direction?  Edit: Thinking about this, It might pay to sit in your car and idle for a few seconds before you get out, so any syncing issues don't screw up the cars location/direction. I would give an example but i think everyone has tried to open doors while lagging and gets what i mean."
h1z1,3ds9xs,ArgonautNZ,2,Sat Jul 18 23:45:57 2015 UTC,I used to have that problem. Found it was due to me having the car near the edge of the deck foundation. Now if I park up near the centre its always there when i log back in. Tried with all cars for differing lengths of time.
h1z1,3ds9xs,dontshootiamfriendly,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:54:11 2015 UTC,"I did have end car in the corner of the deck..  Also after I thought about it..  it was also resting on an ""extension""  Further more.. It was under two upper large shelters...  I use the regular/lower shelters then demo them..  didn't know if that could cause any problems.  Something else I noticed was that when I'm on an extension under the upper level large shelters... I can not get out of a truck.  I get the buzzer sound. But I can get out of a car. Haven't tried a jeep yet."
h1z1,3ds9xs,dontshootiamfriendly,2,Sun Jul 19 00:03:41 2015 UTC,You usually get the buzzer if your too close to an object/wall/shelter and theres not enough room for you to get out but defo try parking nearer the middle... works for me
h1z1,3ds9xs,BradlyKG,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:32:35 2015 UTC,"This actually makes sense! The same thing happened to my jeep before this past wipe (fell through the foundation) and it was parked ON the deck foundation but near a corner. The base I have now, the car is parked in the middle of the foundation and I've had it for over a week now."
h1z1,3ds9xs,TimmyLuvsU,2,Sun Jul 19 15:24:49 2015 UTC,"So here is how I have had a truck for the past 2 weeks.   Base: Tamper with deck and all 4 extensions shelters on top and bottom but from one corner the bottoms are demo'd to create an L shape (truck sits on main deck, not the extensions). The only way I can get out of the truck is to back up, drive forward and spam E. The truck sits with its bumper against a shelter wall so I don't think that causes them to blow up like some say.   Now, before this I had a police car in the same base but I let it sit there for over 12 hours and it was gone, no one can blow it up as we tested with everything possible and nothing was able to reach the car so it either de-spawned from rendering (a theory I have read that cars spawn before bases so if a area isn't rendered and then it is the car will spawn, have nothing to sit on and fall through) or a noclip bubba came in and blew it up his or herself.   Also, just read someone had there car near the edge of a deck extension, I do as well with no issues so I don't think that is it either."

If you are upset that someone HACKED their way into your base then phrase it as such. If someone legitimately raided your base (blew or hopped over your gate and then blew up your door to loot you), then you don't have a thing to complain about.

I also believe that many players take break of this game giving it more time to mature and plan to come back once a big update.  I wouldn't be to worry about game dying anytime soon.

h1z1,3dqmv3,erich3983,3,Sat Jul 18 14:43:01 2015 UTC,Try crafting all the the materials first and double check that you have them all before you finish the stairs.  There is a problem with the autocraft function.
h1z1,3dqmv3,RenzOmega,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:57:42 2015 UTC,"Ok, so they can be made, just not via the autocraft? I just haven't made any since last patch so didn't know if was a known bug or not. Thanks, I'll try that!"
h1z1,3dqmv3,RenzOmega,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:59:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's the best fix I have to offer.  I find that your problem mostly occurs with stairs and workbenches.  I have a small idea of how it happens, but I've really not looked into it much."
h1z1,3dqmv3,ObiWanBaloney,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:01:25 2015 UTC,"They can be made with auto-craft, but if at the end there are any missing bits the game will consume the materials and then not give you stairs. Do what RenzOmega said to bypass this.  I believe the reason it does this is that it looks very deeply at all of your mats. If you're building a metal wall and you are short one sheet metal but have enough metal bars to turn into sheet metal, it will let you auto-craft. If you're not near a workbench though, you won't be able to make sheet metal then the bug hits. Same thing if you need wood planks and have plenty of logs but don't have an axe or machete on you, it will let you auto-craft then fail when you can't turn logs into planks and poof go your mats.   The other fix is to put a workbench near your storage containers, but another bug can hit. Say you want to make gun repair kits. If you have a gun you want in slot 4, another gun you want in an open storage container, and a gun you want to break down in your backpack, there's a chance the game will pick one of the guns you want to keep and break it down in the auto-craft sequence. I do have a workbench near my storage containers, but I never ever do anything with guns or ammo while standing near them. I use a separate workbench that's away from my containers for that, and I also make sure I do not have any guns on me that I want to keep."
h1z1,3dqmv3,fazzmanic,3,Sun Jul 19 03:17:25 2015 UTC,The problem is with sticks and planks. Insure you have the sticks and planks fully crafted before you hit craft on the item in question. The issue happens with workbenches and dew collectors as well. Most likely anything with sticks and planks in it.
h1z1,3dqmv3,Wyld420,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:15:29 2015 UTC,"Ahh good to note. Usually I'm fine with the work benches and dew collectors but that's prolly because I have the sticks separately so good note, thank you."
h1z1,3dqmv3,Pharaohless,2,Sat Jul 18 15:32:04 2015 UTC,"The issue with the stairs is that it crafts the wooden planks first, then when it crafts the sticks it uses the wooden planks to split into the sticks. End result is missing material for the auto craft. Change the order they're produced would fix it. For now if you insure you have sticks at the start, the auto craft will work."
h1z1,3dqz3y,GottaBlast,2,Sat Jul 18 16:42:15 2015 UTC,And maybe make running shoes and/or sneakers slow you down when scaling mountains and rough terrain as opposed to Work/hiking boots
h1z1,3dqz3y,Glaxono,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:24:58 2015 UTC,Nice idea. I'd also like it if equipping a weapon affected run speed. Give the unarmed a slight edge (have you ever tried running while pointing a rifle?!!?).

Side Note for devs... adding a alternator to each car would be a clever trick to do. For those who do no know, the alternator is what charges your battery and maintains that charge while driving. Without a functional one, your batter slowly dies; killing the car. Naturally, most cars may have a broken alternator which would add to the survival aspect."

We knew there were people because it was impossible to find vehicles (even with 7 of us looking), and we'd occasionally see a base. Had no idea how many there actually were. My advice: get a radio and turn it on. First and last channels will likely be overly talkative people."
h1z1,3dqk88,davvii,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:22:22 2015 UTC,"I agree that this is currently the best way to get a hint at how active a server is.  I still would love to see server stats with how many characters were created on a server and how many players are currently online without having to join somewhere and spend time trying to find a radio, only to get trolls or silence in return."
h1z1,3dqk88,nulleffect,7,Sat Jul 18 23:23:15 2015 UTC,"I disagree. The experience on low population servers is way different than on medium to high. People like me, and I know there are a lot of us, really dislike the constant run in with people, and their bases. It really takes away from the immersion of this genre of game.  On low pop PvP servers, you get a better side of PvE without the constant harassment of players, and you get more options for real estate because there aren't bases littered all over the map, but don't completely lock yourself from PvP. It feels more, what we'd consider, real, if you know the zombie Apocalypse were a real thing.  Even on a low pop server, you still see 5-10 bans for cheating per hour during peak hours. I can't even imagine what its like on high pop servers. You do run into cheaters on low, just not ones as blatantly obvious like teleporting and etc, just ESPs, invincibility and aim bots."
h1z1,3dqk88,SaevioGaming,7,Sat Jul 18 15:52:46 2015 UTC,"Bans are global my friend, doesnt mean its on your server. So your statement makes no sense. ;)"
h1z1,3dqk88,nordix84,4,Sat Jul 18 16:05:37 2015 UTC,"I didn't actually know that. I figured that the broadcast was for your server, seeing as it doesn't really make sense to me that I'd want to know the name of a cheater getting banned on some other server.  Learned today, thanks.  [edit] The point aside from cheaters is still relevant though."

Anyways, as far as I know and feel free to prove me incorrect again, you can sort servers by population. The lower on the list when you have it sorted via population, the lower the actual population on that server. My assumption based on the fact the list fluctuates.  So, sort it, then pick one of the higher low population servers on that list, you should be able to airdrop?"
h1z1,3dqk88,SaevioGaming,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:54:08 2015 UTC,"To somewhat agree with OP however, there may be some excess servers that could be trimmed to very likely, help reach the result you're looking for and still likely maintain the low pops players like myself enjoy.  Just for players like me, I dislike the idea of being anywhere even near a medium threshold. I like /very/ low population."
h1z1,3dqk88,InsaneVizir,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:57:47 2015 UTC,"I love low pop servers. They are the closest you get to a real survival zombie experience.  Lots of zombies and whenever you get to see a player,  tensions are higher. We need the low pop."
h1z1,3dqk88,ChinaIsFree,2,Sat Jul 18 18:39:36 2015 UTC,"Once they turn on auto-ban and they're catching 95%+ of the cheaters, I'd say go ahead.  Until then hell no.  All you'll be doing is concentrating the player base into less servers with more cheaters.  That's the #1 reason people leave the game, no skill loser cheaters."
h1z1,3dqk88,lleeroy9611,-1,Sat Jul 18 14:22:45 2015 UTC,"everyone is talking so much about cheaters/hackers, dont know on what server u are playing, but i dont see much hackers at all, maybe 1 or 2 per week and that is no problem for me cause i know they get punished for hacking.  every game got hacker, way more than h1z1 and h1z1 is still on alpha remember this."

h1z1,3dqk88,keichler,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:58:32 2015 UTC,Consolidating of servers isnt a key to game growth. WoW had server merges and its population has not magically risen because of it. It wouldn't by any historical degree (from any game I know in recent history) grow playerbase by reducing server count.
h1z1,3dqk88,Actaea,2,Sat Jul 18 14:19:31 2015 UTC,What this type of initiative should hope to accomplish is to create healthy populations on each server.  What I mean by healthly is a generous amount of low pop servers followed by a good amount of medium pop servers followed by a small amount of high pop servers.
h1z1,3dqk88,Actaea,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:28:52 2015 UTC,Thank you. I don't think people even try to comprehend. They just form an opinion without thinking it through. Consolidating does NOT mean people will have to play on a high pop server. There would still be plenty of servers for those who dont want to play an mmo.
h1z1,3dqk88,davvii,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:03:02 2015 UTC,Your argument in this is that it would increase the game's population. I'm trying to find evidence to support something like this happening and I can't find it. I'm hoping you can. Not for your stance's stake but my general interest as well.

h1z1,3dqvks,HaniiBlu,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:24:58 2015 UTC,"I had thought about that, but you wouldn't be forcing anyone to do anything they do not want to do. it would just be a part of the game, like crafting , farming , building, you can be who you want,   Currently we are all the same looking people, with the only difference being skins. and how we play..  Adding another option in how to play would not take anything away from the sandbox nature, and it would add another dynamic of cooperation, rather than the current dominant system of group up, scavenge, kill for the same items you scavenge, and build up the base.  I want to see this game being very succesfull as im sure we all do, but the current trend is that games like these die out becasue people migrate to either new versions or competing developments.   Currently Ark`s optimisation is awful, like uber bad, but when that gets fixed , H1z1 will lose ground.  Also Miscreated, has an amazing atmosphere to it, but the content currently is terrible.   H1z1 is in a great place, it has a really awesome atmosphere, it has a strong development team behind it, it is growing all the time, it has the potential to be truly ground breaking but i fear that without a story, something for people who are sick of grinding for loot, sick of building there base, sick of KOS for loot , then players will migrate.   I sure agree that forcing people to do things in a free to roam sandbox environment is a big no no, but the idea wouldnt force you too, it would simply allow others to take time out from the slog of the usual and pursue something interesting.

Don't encourage MORE hacking by boosting the rewards UNTIL the anti-cheat/hacker catching part of the game IS more polished. - tehbantho   Let me try understand this one paragraph in your Post.    1) Your Opinion is that BR Rewards are not Worth getting. Because you agree they suck.  2) The Reward associated with getting a Key you beleive is a great solution to it sucking.  3)  There is a Downside (Monitization of the Game) however to it which causes Hackers to take advantage of it.  4) The Solution to the problem is to have the Developers Stop making a Good Idea Better till they can put in better Anti Cheat?

h1z1,3doo7w,thetinker86,2,Sun Jul 19 04:00:41 2015 UTC,Adding on to what he wrote  Bad rubber banding. Open a door go inside building and a second later you are back outside or on the other side of the room.   Inventory lag is atrocious. Dragging and dropping items to and from containers sometimes does not work. It will lag for a second and then drop in.  Zombies take three steps towards you then rubber band back to where they were and teleport to you. Also zombies are sometimes requiring 2 headshots.  Hydration and energy bug still present.  Punching when switching weapons still present  Blackberries are the new Worn letter lol.
h1z1,3doo7w,JaxTeller718,2,Sat Jul 18 05:21:30 2015 UTC,"Agreed, there are lots of issues, but one that needs addressing is THE INVENTORY  (developers!), when we first started the game, it was not so bad to manage, but with so many items, the inventory in its current state is highly inefficient and messy, I think it needs to be redesigned...  Ammo needs its own inventory space, it just goes everywhere, its poorly implemented at this stage...  More hot keys are needed, this should include bandages, binoculars, flashlight, axe / or knife etc these are basic items. Move these away from the main inventory, they are the most used items to start and into the quick slots (weapons are next) This would also reduce inventory lag somewhat as constantly opening it to bandage every time is getting bloody annoying...Nevermind anything else!!!  As more and more stuff gets added to the game, eventually it will  be impossible to manage."
h1z1,3doo7w,rangerlukas,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:43:05 2015 UTC,That is a great idea with hotkeys. I never even thought about that but yes that would make things a whole lot easier and simpler. Great idea.
h1z1,3doo7w,JaxTeller718,0,Sat Jul 18 23:24:15 2015 UTC,"devs said they wont hotkey bandages, but there is no logical reason not to implement bandages into a hotkey...  The cooldown would still apply, you cant move while applying a bandage, all you have done is applied a hotkey, there is no logic to it not being added to the hot key / quick key list...  Making hotkeys for flashlight and binoculars was a wonderful idea, now extend it to bandages, it makes sense..."
h1z1,3doo7w,rangerlukas,2,Sun Jul 19 01:49:59 2015 UTC,"But I don't want you to be able to press 5 then left click (or a keypress etc...) and heal while we are in a firefight, sorry.  If you've got your bandages in a good spot in your inventory and have time to open up the window and fire one off, be my guest.  You limit your movement and view for a small amount of time for the tradeoff of the bandage.  Also, you may have forgotten and not actually have any bandages. On the same token, it may take you a minute to find where you put them in your messy inventory. If you hotkey bandages, all of this is a nonissue and you just bandage in the middle of firefights.  Not logical?"
h1z1,3doo7w,JeffHanson368,2,Sun Jul 19 16:54:03 2015 UTC,"Agree with this. It makes it more ""realistic"" that you have to pull up your inventory to find your bandages, like you would look through your backpack in real life - it's not instant."

h1z1,3doo7w,PLEYOR,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:00:14 2015 UTC,"I disagree completely, its those times when you need a bandage and cant find them, and cant use them or run out that it lets you down...The entire inventory structure lets you down...  You still have to craft your bandages, you still have to stand still while using, you still have apply them, You still have to wait for the cool down to expire, the threat parameter is the same, the only difference is: You do not have to open your inventory for every single moment that you want to do something..how realistic is that?  It changes nothing, only accessibility, it also reduces lag...   A bandage only restores 10%, I simply want it implemented into the hot keys alongside flashlight, binoculars, all other healing items should be restricted to backpacks still, only basics should be allowed in the hotkeys...  Bows are automatically reloaded as long as you have ammo, If you had to reload it via the inventory you would be up in arms and rioting...  Ammo style Weapons are the same, consuming ammo, if you had to reload it via inventory after every 6 shots, again you would be screaming change it...You have to change ammo clips out, in the real world, should they alter that then to make it more realistic? after 2 shots you have to go into your inventory and reload the shotgun manually, yes lets make it more realistic as you say, and force you to manually reload your gun, from the inventory, once your clip is empty every time. Assuming you have actually loaded these clips first, you did remember to load the clips did you not?  In conclusion your honor regarding bandages and hot key:  If you are attacked, the bandage effect is lost / interrupted, if your moving, the bandage effect is lost / interrupted, nothing changes, the cooldown prevents spamming/exploits. There is no reason not to add bandages to the quickslot..."

In the 7 hours; rained most of the day, I was on yesterday I found 14 berry bushes. That was pretty much across the lower half of the map. Found more branches on zombies then bushes. Meaning branches for torches and ground tampers are going to be a precious commodity.  Got stuck in an animation loop coming out of a house, kept dropping me off the roof. Logged out, and logged right back in to it. Ran and jumped till I finally poped out of it.   My character keeps getting stuck in the drawing an arrow animation loop and can't fire. The only fix I have found; because going to a different weapon and back to the bow wont fix it, is to drop the bow then pick it back up.   And I know not everyone is effected but I can't place any crafted/constructed items. As in I can't even place campfires. The graphics doesn't show; intel2500HD{yes you can laugh}.   Got hit several times by teleporting zombies. Be in front of me, go to shoot it, and it's behind me attacking.   The chain link fences at night look star wars electrified. Sorry but would the graphics artiest go look at an old chain link fence, they don't shine.   This update has been a train wreck since Friday night.

h1z1,3dp0oc,omgitspngu,2,Sat Jul 18 02:03:40 2015 UTC,I'm sure they will add some kind of screen effect down the track. If they could simulate your eyes drooping shut it would be funny.   I would like to be able to lie down anywhere and rest though. Maybe it should take a minute as to add some risk.
h1z1,3dp0oc,Leweegibo,2,Sat Jul 18 05:16:33 2015 UTC,"Being able to rest if you have 0% stamina, but NOT if you've just jumped 100 times in a row to lower it. I run out of stamina so often for some reason just jumping around occasionally when I have to. I would like to be able to rest when not tired to raise my stamina again, don't even give the well-rested buff. It just needs to be able to be used to restore stamina, because waiting around standing for it to go up (and then your hydration and energy go down...) gets annoying. Thanks for looking"

Of course there would be better ways to do it. I'm quite experienced with sleep deprivation and a nice implementation could be   higher contrast and gamma slight jittering of the fov have more and more parts away from screen center become blurrier the more exhausted you are   I know that right now none of the devs should waste their time on this, but I think it'd be a great feature."

h1z1,3dmggs,SamiNami,38,Fri Jul 17 13:41:39 2015 UTC,2s and 5s are stupid they should just let you queue with up to 5 people.

h1z1,3dmggs,MormonDew,3,Fri Jul 17 15:15:35 2015 UTC,"I agree, People are already doing double 2 mans so I don't see the point. If I want to play with two friends now we're forced to go solo queue to play together which shouldn't have to be the case and also kinda ruins the idea of team BR."
h1z1,3dmggs,freshhorse,9,Fri Jul 17 15:36:47 2015 UTC,"This is correct. Teams should be able to be 2,3,4,5 in all increments in same BR."
h1z1,3dmggs,Knotwood,7,Fri Jul 17 15:01:37 2015 UTC,In the same BR? Ummm...I don't know if I agree with that. Don't you think the 2 man team has a disadvantage over the 5 man team?
h1z1,3dmggs,Dontblameme1,5,Fri Jul 17 16:58:42 2015 UTC,I think that depends upon the skills of the players. We have seen some good examples of people managing to take on 1 vs 4 situations. I know personally I would queue up with max numbers due to my lackluster h1z1 combat skills.
h1z1,3dmggs,dcherry88,6,Fri Jul 17 17:33:31 2015 UTC,"by that logic, a 5man team of really skilled players will wipe the floor with every 1, 2, 3, 4 man teams"
h1z1,3dmggs,Tenetri,2,Fri Jul 17 17:41:36 2015 UTC,You are correct. and this might be why they decided to make team sizes mandatory.
h1z1,3dmggs,dcherry88,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:55:17 2015 UTC,this is easily defeated by all friends grabbing a partner and all 2 team partners grouping together. its slightly more difficult when you have an odd number of players.

h1z1,3dmggs,Dontblameme1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:13:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not stating that based off my post it would be ok. For that matter I've not stated my opinion at all.   If you have an issue with there being uneven teams, does that mean that every team would lose a team member of a person dies, so as to continue to keep the teams even? I doubt it. Situations are always going to be in play that make it advantageous for one group over the other.   For the record, my opinion is that the BRs should start with equal team numbers across the board. I just point out that there are other points of view."
h1z1,3dmggs,dcherry88,2,Fri Jul 17 18:52:03 2015 UTC,"Yes and no, they will obviously have more players and therefore potentially a better chance at winning. But in my experience the large groups are extremely easy to see, and you will usually see at least one of them before they see you. I play solo and at least for me the team's are a lot easier to deal with than the other solo players. I get a sense of relief when I see a team."
h1z1,3dmggs,Callsemlikeiseesum,-2,Fri Jul 17 19:09:47 2015 UTC,A large group can always split up. So your argument is bullshit.
h1z1,3dmggs,Dontblameme1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:26:36 2015 UTC,"If a large group splits up. Then they are not a large group anymore. So if each individual is by themselves they will be a lot harder to spot as they are more quiet and the chances of catching one on the corner of your eye is much less than the chances of catching 4.  So yes, you're right. If you take a group, and make it not a group, you will have a higher chance of surviving."
h1z1,3dmggs,Callsemlikeiseesum,0,Fri Jul 17 18:42:37 2015 UTC,Not when they're all of a sudden a 3 man team and panicking.
h1z1,3dmggs,Knotwood,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:10:21 2015 UTC,"The smart thing about 2-man and 5-man BR is that you'll know how many enemies you can expect after finding (and assumably) killing the first guy.  So, if you're a 2-man group, and find some dude who's most likely scavenging with his team, you can't just assume that there's one more. Could be two more, three more, what the hell even 4 more, which kind of ruins the game.  The game is ruined anyways since there's usually several 2-man groups playing together in the 2-man queues, but putting different sized groups in the same BR is just another problem added.  This is not a rant, I'm rarely bothered by multiple groups playing together, this is merely a prediction of the 9001 QQ-topics if this were ever to happen."
h1z1,3dmggs,hyssia,2,Mon Jul 20 20:48:53 2015 UTC,"This doesn't fix the core issue team br is trying to fix. If I am a team of 2 and I land in a caravan site, and suddenly an entire team of 5 land there as well since they can all land together, I am absolutely screwed."
h1z1,3dmggs,asaprusty13,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:37:37 2015 UTC,"I think they are saying to have separate match-making based on team size.  If you log in as a two-man team, you only go against other two-man teams, etc"
h1z1,3dmggs,Ravenloff,3,Sat Jul 18 09:20:26 2015 UTC,"I feel like if they allowed separate matchmaking for teams of 2, 3, 4, and 5, it would take much longer to start a BR."

h1z1,3dmggs,TnelisPotencia,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:19:23 2015 UTC,I don't really see why this is a problem. If you get one car in BR it's pretty easy to get a second.

h1z1,3dmggs,TnelisPotencia,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:03:32 2015 UTC,2s and 5s is pretty standard for competitive gameplay. I wasn't surprised that's what they went with. Also can't you queue with 3 or 4 and be given randoms to fill in?   If they have 3s and 4s it might split the playerbase too much.

I'm a huge fan of hardcore... but whatever... people dont like first person.  the other BR modes are jam packed man.

h1z1,3dmggs,HaniiBlu,3,Fri Jul 17 14:28:34 2015 UTC,They should just make a system where you can join in groups of 2/3/4/5 and have all of those spawn together in one game (maybe skip out on the groups of 4/5 but give 2/3 the same server).   Basically the same as normal BR.

Maybe like a little chopper that you could pilot around maybe with enough seats to fit 3-4 players so that groups could transport their friends to different locations safely and much move quickly. I don't think the aircraft at this point should have any weaponry until they develop the auto turrets for bases so that its not Hunting rifle vs Tiny impossible to hit Heli with rocket pods (which having aircraft in this game with a viable weapons system would be soo amazing i could just fall over dead if they did that :D). Plus they would need a craftable recipe for parachutes like 20-30 cloth maybe (could be another use for the tons of cloth you can accumulate late game).

Aircrafts will be here soon after the expansions I'd be willing to bet.   Much like others are saying, however, aircrafts with weaponry won't likely make an appearance in my opinion. Assuming they'll be moving at a somewhat quick speed, they'd be nearly impossible to shoot down before the victim dies to a mounted chain gun. I think they'll stick to small gyros, probably 2 to 4 passengers tops, including the pilot, with no form of weapons."
h1z1,3dq857,SaevioGaming,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:31:41 2015 UTC,"At this point aircraft is pointless because the map is 64km, they plan to make this map 16,000 km that's a massive difference.

Who needs a jet in this game thats absurd, helicopters are more realistic shit it's America all of this would be around anyway including jets, for the pilot part we will have professions....
