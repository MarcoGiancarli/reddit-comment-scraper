Seriously, there's something wrong with its face."" Then I saw Mom and realized I was looking at hyenas. Maybe I will go get some coffee.  Also, as an aside, I always thought hyenas were related to dogs. Turns out, they're more like cats than I thought, although they share some of the familiar characteristics of both. From wikipedia:   Although phylogenetically they are closer to felines and viverrids, hyenas are behaviourally and morphologically similar to canines in several aspects; both hyenas and canines are nonarboreal, cursorial hunters that catch prey with their teeth rather than claws. (In fact, cheetahs have been known to climb trees to escape hyenas.) Both eat food quickly and may store it, and their calloused feet with large, blunt, nonretractable nails are adapted for running and making sharp turns. However, the hyenas' grooming, scent marking, defecating habits, mating, and parental behaviour are consistent with the behaviour of other feliforms.   Bonus closeup of a hyena eye, showing the vertical slit pupil. (from this gallery of animal eyeball closeups)"

They need to keep that strength so that they can work together in a hunt and protect their young. Unfortunately, if a pride's male is killed, it can lead to the death of many other lions as new males move in to the territory. They will kill all cubs that aren't theirs and adult females can be seriously injured trying to protect them. It's something that trophy hunters should think about. Their unfortunate trophy is not the only victim"

hardcoreaww,39bcrr,soup2nuts,2,Thu Jun 11 03:45:25 2015 UTC,"https://instagram.com/p/2ewbutTGoJ/  I did a rip of the entire instagram account 1 week ago and I've been looking through that to make the gifs, so finding this video I had to go through 5 weeks worth of stuff. They post a lot, so it took some scrolling.  I won't do that any more. You'll just have to trust me that the pic/gif is from that reputable source when I say it is, because that is where I got it from, and then those that are specially interested to see the same thing (because it is the same thing, the majority of their videos are 15 seconds and I gif the entire thing) on Instagram can click the link and do the scrolling. Spending 5-10 minutes for every source from them means I might as well stop, since I have to use Opera to look at Instagram to find the video (since Chrome likes to spend 10 seconds to load every picture) and Chrome to actually watch it (since Opera doesn't want to load the video, only the preview)."
hardcoreaww,39bcrr,BigBassBone,3,Thu Jun 11 05:07:55 2015 UTC,"Ahh ok, the way I did mine was to save the video source immediately after I made the gif, as well as add the video link on the description section in imgur - that way I will always have the video link."
hardcoreaww,39bcrr,Wordygit,2,Thu Jun 11 06:39:05 2015 UTC,"With the ripper I use I can get everything from the account, but I can't go to the page of the specific video and get it. I want the .mp4, because I can make better quality gifs with that compared to using GifCam to rip it directly while playing. In either case, I'd need to find something interesting with Opera and then view it with Chrome because both are bad in their own specific ways. For example if I want to reverse google image search an image I have to use Chrome because it doesn't work in the Opera version I'm using (at some point google.com didn't load either), but if I then want to look through an image gallery I swap back to Opera because if I open 10 pictures in background tabs in Chrome the entire browser freezes for 20 seconds until all background tabs are fully loaded.  If I was taking 5 seconds from a 3 minute interesting video then yes, I'd post the full source. But the longest I've seen from that instagram are 15 second videos, so when I make a 10 or 15 second gif that is pretty much the only thing interesting about that video.  It's the same with sdzoo.tumblr, I ripped all of the 3500 pics they had uploaded up until a couple of weeks ago, and then sort those by size or similar to find the good stuff to post. Even then I'm having troubles using reverse google image search to find that specific image on their tumblr, so I'm just going with the ""this is their tumblr, they are trustworthy, and I hope that if they reblogged something that it was from a trustworthy site as well"" sourcing.  When I find something from other sources I do keep that specific page in a .txt document for later, but that's also so that the flickr user gets credit. But for sdzoo and blackjaguarwhitetiger it's going to be bulk sourcing for a while because going through each manually or reverse sourcing with google is horribly slow."

hardcoreaww,38jbpn,BlLE,5,Thu Jun 4 16:31:07 2015 UTC,"Like other genus Taricha members, the glands in the skin of Taricha torosa secrete the potent neurotoxin tetrodotoxin, which is hundreds of times more toxic than cyanide. This is the same toxin found in pufferfish and harlequin frogs. Researchers believe bacteria synthesize tetrodotoxin, and the animals that employ the neurotoxin acquire it through consumption of these bacteria. This neurotoxin is strong enough to kill most vertebrates, including humans. However, it is dangerous only if ingested.  Due to their toxicity, California newts have few natural predators. Garter snakes are the most common, and some species have developed a genetic resistance to tetrodotoxin. The mutations in the snake’s genes that conferred resistance to the toxin have resulted in a selective pressure that favors newts that produce more potent levels of toxin. Increases in newt toxicity then apply a selective pressure favoring snakes with mutations conferring even greater resistance. This evolutionary arms race has resulted in the newts producing levels of toxin far in excess of what is needed to kill any other conceivable predator.   I'll take it :-)"

I was paddling back out into the line-up on a big day once and three dolphin came racing by me out towards the take-off spot. A big set wave came in just then and they flipped around like synchronized dancers and took off on the wave right at me, I was about forty-five yards inside of them. I stopped paddling and sat up on my board to watch, and they came racing right at me. When they were about ten feet in front of me the ones to the side split to either side of me, and the one in the middle dove just enough to go right under me. . .my heart was in my throat and I was laughing in utter delight. I've never felt so blessed in all my long life as that moment."
hardcoreaww,36w2f2,surfnaked,2,Sat May 23 15:16:51 2015 UTC,"Do you think they were checking you out given the shape of your surf board must look like one of them? Or they just want to play? I have a theory that if they live on land they may interact with us like dogs, but we can't really get close to them since we don't have all access while in the water.   I guess I felt the same when a big brown bear came close to where I was standing, fear wasn't there, just in awe. I could sense she wasn't trying to ""get"" me, just wanting to pass through to get on her way."
hardcoreaww,36w2f2,970souk,2,Sat May 23 15:50:17 2015 UTC,"I think that for a lot of animals, most of the time we're kind of incidental. More of less just there. They're well aware of us but not really interested at all in interacting with us. At least as long as we leave them be.  When those guys charged down that wave like that though, I just happened to be there in the way. So they just made their ride a little more fun by using me as a slalom flag. I could almost hear them laughing."

I'm aware that bottlenoses aren't the only type of dolphin, but the others – the Amazon river or dusky, for example – also have fins on their backs and beaklike noses.

hardcoreaww,35pyw9,grapesandmilk,12,Tue May 12 21:38:14 2015 UTC,"I'm hesitant to say that they don't. Lions were once found as far north as Armenia. Wikipedia says that they were found near Yerevan in Armenia, which has a decent amount of snow in modern times. They were also found in Northern Spain and even parts of modern day Ukraine, where they certainly encountered snow. I found this which shows historic range of lions. Lions in the northern areas of this certainly encountered snow. Additionally, for modern day lions, there is this. While I don't believe there are permanent populations in the mountains mentioned, but there are populations, even now, in parts of South Africa that occasionally see snow. The page I linked mentions snow as far north as Johannesburg, which is north of a few current day lion populations.  TL;DR yes, occasionally. Even more over a thousand years ago and before, when they lived in regions far colder than where they live now."

hardcoreaww,35o1z0,KarnickelEater,7,Tue May 12 02:01:25 2015 UTC,"All that remains of the guy who wore it. ;)   Nice picture, but no human needs to be afraid of a cheetah, unless they corner the animal (in which case any animal is dangerous). It's been discussed quite a lot (since lots of cheetah pictures with people are posted on reddit, like a cheetah chasing a teenager around a room), but it comes down to bite strength, bite size, fragile bones. They are built for speed with few engineering compromises, they don't fare well in the robustness category. So if they have any chance they'll avoid things that can hurt them, and because they are animals (without health care) that means they really want to avoid a fight with you because even just getting hurt means a death sentence for them.  That is why you'll see pictures like these most often with cheetahs and less frequently with other big cats:   http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/01/13/article-2538529-1A9F3D0500000578-47_964x571.jpg http://image-cdn.zap2it.com/images/man-cheetah-wild-discovery-325.jpg http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/02/10/article-1140625-034C7EE9000005DC-569_468x395.jpg http://www.catersnews.com/uploadedimages/0504201212393317704.jpg http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/11/11/article-1328911-0C07BED9000005DC-198_634x353.jpg   Story of an actual cheetah attack on a human: http://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/9145753.Keeper_at_wildlife_park_says_cheetah_is_not_dangerous__just_hormonal/"

hardcoreaww,352h33,HighSorcerer,2,Thu May 7 05:10:29 2015 UTC,"A lot of people do, and it's okay! I'm just poking fun at that it happens on the sub all the time, not at you specifically.  Some helpful advice though, because it's true for adults as well as cubs:  Cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) Cheetah spots are solid and small. Cheetahs also have the black streak-marks on their face. Absolutely no other genus of cat has those black streak marks. At least, not that I'm aware of. Also, their bodies are a lot slimmer than any other large feline, as you can easily see in the pic provided. Bonus fact, their claws don't retract, and I hear tell that scientists are saying they have more in common, genetically, with canines than felines(though take this with a grain of salt, I don't know for sure that it's true).  Leopard (Panthera pardus) Leopards have black and brown spots, clumped together in small groups of 3-5 called rosettes. They're smaller and rounder than a jaguar's spots. Their bodies have kind of a medium build of these three. Their heads, compared to a jaguar, are also smaller and have a rounder shape. Bonus fact, leopards can haul prey their own body weight up a tree holding it in their mouth. They can also kill things up to ten times their body weight so, y'know, good luck if you meet one in the wild.  Jaguar  Whoops, I meant  Jaguar (Panthera onca) Jaguar spots are much larger than a leopard's. They're more spread out, and noticeably so. In addition to having the biggest spots, they also have a larger, stockier build - kinda like the tough-guy mafioso of the big cat world. Their heads are larger and more square-ish, like their spots, when compared to a leopard(note the flat-top in the pic). Bonus fact, jaguars are the only big cat that kills its prey by biting through the skull. Other cats go for the neck. Jaguars do not fuck around with that nonsense.  Keep in mind that their cubs are the same way. King Cheetahs(specifically) have a badass mohawk when they're cubs. Otherwise their spots and stripes identify them as the kind of cat they are.  A quick note on black panthers, also. It's a genetic mutation in leopards and jaguars that causes a condition known as melanism, which results in them being born with all-black fur. It's harder to tell but their spots are still there, but at that point it's easier to go on body type(medium or heavy/stocky build) as to whether they're a leopard or jaguar. Keep in mind also, Florida Panthers are not leopards or jaguars. They're cougar/puma/mountain lions, and they're their own species of cats, Puma concolor. Here's one reenacting the Puma sportswear logo.  I hope that this is/was/will be helpful and informative!"
hardcoreaww,352h33,HighSorcerer,2,Thu May 7 07:09:50 2015 UTC,"It was, but it doesn't help with trying to find images of leopards or jaguars, because so much of it is mislabeled. For example:  http://7-themes.com/data_images/out/65/6993156-wild-animal-leopard.jpg  http://wall.alphacoders.com/by_sub_category.php?id=134825  The first comes up if you google animal leopard, and the second if you google animal jaguar. Same picture. By the head shape, it looks like a jaguar, but the spots look more like a leopard's. It becomes even more difficult when looking at pictures of the kitties, because there you don't have the same muscular or spot development that you'd see in a fully grown adult. So I saved like 5 of each leopard and jaguar picture, but I fear there's not a single jaguar there because they all look the same to me.  Not to mention that if you search for ""baby leopard"", just the first page shows leopards, cheetahs, amur leopards, snow leopards, lion, tiger and jaguars, oh my."

hardcoreaww,33wu77,SWATZombies,11,Sun Apr 26 16:44:48 2015 UTC,"Souk was pretty much right on. A GOOD zoo (read ""not all of them"") is just barely equipped to handle a wild animal, and that's with a ton of funding and professionals that are trained in the upkeep of the animals. A private individual, unless funded like hell and able to provide an incredible amount of land and trained support, have no idea what they're doing and end up putting wildlife at risk. Not only that, but frequently there will be big huge problems. A Jaguar might be okay to look at,  but if you keep it on a chain it's never going to lose its wild side (no matter how subdued it may look). The animal will almost assuredly lash out when it gets a chance (not its fault) and not only will the handler be responsible, the animal will probably be put down (fucked up considering most of the home animals are close to endangered).   Lose/lose situation regardless. Don't do it."
hardcoreaww,33wu77,L4NGOS,-8,Sun Apr 26 16:54:38 2015 UTC,"The animal will almost assuredly lash out when it gets a chance (not its fault)    Not the animal's fault that it's had a bad upbringing and is now aggressive, sure, but it is it's fault that it lashes out. Obviously that doesn't make a difference to the ideas you were actually talking about"
hardcoreaww,33wu77,PlumbTheDerps,8,Sun Apr 26 23:40:05 2015 UTC,"I would like to give you a personal anecdote about why large cats and ""exotic animals"" are generally not good pets.  My grandfather was a licensed animal trainer and a professional animal breeder, and had raised animals for zoos all across the country. He was particularly well known among feline zoologists and biologists for successfully breeding a number of uncommon small cats, including the serval and caracal from Africa and the golden cat and smokey jungle cat from Asia. Typically he would get a couple cats on loan from a zoo and try to breed them at home, although he had a few that were kept for a more extended period of time.   He was killed by a 3 year old leopard that he had raised from birth - there are even pictures of my grandpa bottle-feeding his eventual killer. He went to feed the leopard and I guess just let his guard down and that's all it took. As cute as some of these creatures are, they have millions of years of evolutionary programming that makes them vicious killers, and you can never completely remove that. This is basically what /u/970souk and /u/earthceltic where saying as well."

Often doesn't work out. They don't react the same as domesticated cats.  And, because most people think a large cage is good enough, when really, they need several miles of wandering space. Check out The Wild Animal Sanctuary, for example."

hardcoreaww,32s6eg,cuddIefish,5,Sat Apr 18 07:30:36 2015 UTC,"Predator prey relationships like the Yellowstone wolves are still being researched. For much of recorded history, human attempts to control animal populations have focused on numbers and ratios where they should have been equally focused on movements and locations, as that's what matters to the base of the food chain.  Desertification is starting to be curbed in many areas by simply moving animals around - livestock and such. Mimicking predator prey relationships where prey animals are constantly moving is much more in line with natural phenomena and is bringing entire ecosystems back into balance and curbing desertification in many areas. Here's a really interesting Ted talk on some of the research and results. http://www.ted.com/talks/allan_savory_how_to_green_the_world_s_deserts_and_reverse_climate_change?language=en  Edit clarity"

hardcoreaww,32s6eg,Furbush,9,Thu Apr 16 20:48:41 2015 UTC,"The elk population was way higher than the ecosystem could support long-term due to that giant fire that turned way too much forest into grassland that elk like better. The fire was a human fuck up too. Went from decades of putting out every single fire to just letting all that accumulated fuel go up at once. Instead of helping the pines reproduce and clearing underbrush, it just burned much hotter than a normal forest fire and killed everything.  More important than the elk numbers is the fact that the wolves made the elk move around instead of destroying riverbanks. Those deer were fucking up everything before the wolves came along."

hardcoreaww,30hqnu,Francotanko,12,Fri Mar 27 17:40:26 2015 UTC,"Wolves get a bad rap for being vicious, but honestly, that's not all that often true from what little knowledge I have of them. I've heard they're usually quite timid and prefer to avoid human contact when possible and usually only attack to defend their pack or if otherwise starving.  I thought I read that wolves usually try to spook their prey into running because they require that stimulation to chase it? Don't quote me on that, I've got pretty fuzzy memory and most of this is likely second-hand knowledge from my sister working at a wolf dog sanctuary."
hardcoreaww,30hqnu,whatthefbomb,9,Fri Mar 27 18:09:05 2015 UTC,"I think the reason why they might spook their prey into running is part of a strategy of the hunt, where one wolf scares the prey towards the rest of the pack, so they dont get stuck wasting the energy chasing an animal that is much faster then they are."

Kamara spends 12 hours every day, sometimes in pouring rain, watching over the vulnerable baby rhinos. He loves these animals and calls them his children. He is part of the reason Kenya’s black rhinos, whose population had plummeted to near extinction, are doing so well here. Much needed attention has been focused on the plight of wildlife and the conflict between heavily armed poachers and increasingly militarized wildlife rangers. But very little has been said about the indigenous communities on the front lines of the poaching wars and the incredible work they do to protect these animals. These communities hold the key to saving Africa’s great animals.

Did you know white tigers are the result of an extremely rare genetic mutation that is only found in Bengal tigers? Also that they do not occur naturally in the wild? Bengal tigers are native to India and their orange and black fur helps them camouflage in the shadows to hunt their prey. Along with this rare genetic mutation comes physical deformities including cleft feet and palettes, crossed eyes, scoliosis, among others. Because of these deformities and their white and black fur, they would not be able to survive very long in the wild.   Also a final tidbit, the genetic mutation that causes their unique coloring is a result of inbreeding mostly commonly done with fathers and daughters."
