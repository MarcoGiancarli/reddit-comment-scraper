personalfinance,3e2wcz,IAmVladimirPutinAMA,34,Tue Jul 21 15:23:45 2015 UTC,congrats on the new job
personalfinance,3e2wcz,crownjewel82,29,Tue Jul 21 15:43:23 2015 UTC,"It really pays off to network. Not just going to networking events, but even striking up a conversation with someone while you both wait at the grocery line or just telling people that you're in transition an open to new opportunities. Congrats OP."
personalfinance,3e2wcz,Fell_On_Black_Days,14,Tue Jul 21 16:19:45 2015 UTC,"Not just going to networking events, but even striking up a conversation with someone while you both wait at the grocery line   Yep. In my opinion networking always work best when you're not actively looking to do it or get something, if that makes sense. ""Networking events"" are good and all, but its even better to have an established network of people in advance, and then turning your network when you ""need"" something."
personalfinance,3e2wcz,Dunder-MifflinPaper,12,Tue Jul 21 17:09:05 2015 UTC,"This is the crux of the advice that Scott Adam's (Dilbert) gave in his column on ""being successful.""  (Emphasis mine)   I was seated next to a businessman who was probably in his early 60s ... I asked what he did for a living, and he told me he was the CEO of a company that made screws. He offered me some career advice. He said that every time he got a new job, he immediately started looking for a better one. For him, job seeking was not something one did when necessary. It was a continuing process.  This makes perfect sense if you do the math. Chances are that the best job for you won't become available at precisely the time you declare yourself ready. Your best bet, he explained, was to always be looking for a better deal. The better deal has its own schedule. I believe the way he explained it is that your job is not your job; your job is to find a better job."
personalfinance,3e2wcz,lolexecs,5,Tue Jul 21 17:52:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying this is wrong, but I do have a question:  Where should loyalty fit into the picture?  I mean, yes everyone is like ""screw loyalty"" and ""employers aren't loyal these days"", etc. and that last one is to some extent more true than it ever has been.  But what about when your organization actually has been loyal to you and / or your peers?  Should you always be looking for a new job then too?    Remember, there are substantial costs to changing jobs too.  Besides just stress, there's also the fact that one typically loses vesting power in any ESOP or 401K.  You typically lose PTO seniority and (at least in the US) get busted back down to 80 hours / year.  Etc.    I always like to say ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it""; so what's the best rule of thumb when you consider all of that?"
personalfinance,3e2wcz,vplatt,6,Tue Jul 21 18:47:52 2015 UTC,"Speaking as someone in their late 20s, I would be happy to find a job that offered all the basics of what you just spelled out."
personalfinance,3e2wcz,IndustrialSabotage,5,Tue Jul 21 18:51:39 2015 UTC,"Loyalty should only factor in to the extent that it benefits you to be loyal. In other words, if there's some tangible, calculable benefit to sticking it out instead of going elsewhere, stick it out. If not, leave if you have a better offer.  This can be anything - making partner at a law firm, for example, requires that you put in the years of work to make it. Suck up to the right people, show you can be trusted, etc., and there's real value in staying. For technical work, like software engineering or web development or something like that, there's very little benefit to being tenured. Unless there's equity w/ a vesting schedule at stake, which is obviously a different story (and quite tangible and easily calculable)."
personalfinance,3e2wcz,Cricket620,3,Tue Jul 21 18:52:53 2015 UTC,And what do you say to your new employers when they ask about your employment history? That you switch jobs every few months because you found a better one? It might not come off as a good trait to them.
personalfinance,3e2wcz,jackerlus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:55:28 2015 UTC,you don't have to lay it out like that in your resume - what they don't know won't hurt them

personalfinance,3e2wcz,jackerlus,2,Tue Jul 21 19:22:44 2015 UTC,"I could get a big raise if I moved about 120 miles to the east (which would be closer to my sister, a plus) and took a different job.   But, we like where we live now, and the company I work for is awesome. Great benefits, 100% ESOP, work from home, pays for my internet and phone, etc.  Sometimes a little more money or a higher position isn't always worth it. I actually ran a web department at my last job, now I'm just a programmer. I like my job now so much more.   Given that I make enough to live comfortably, you couldn't get me to go back to a 9-5 in an office even if you doubled my current salary."
personalfinance,3e2wcz,andrewsmd87,2,Tue Jul 21 19:02:56 2015 UTC,Loyalty comes from both ends and it's not something you demand but give.
personalfinance,3e2wcz,krneki12,2,Tue Jul 21 19:03:09 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, you should always be looking.  Should you take the jobs however, is another matter entirely."
personalfinance,3e2wcz,derpandlurk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:05:33 2015 UTC,"Preface: I've only been in the full time or nearly full time workforce for 10 years, but I've -never- experienced loyalty from an actual employer. Loyal clients from independent contracting but never a company, much less the outright fuckery I've been put through. As a result I'm pretty mercenary, so take this with that in mind.  Look for a new job anyway, even if it's semi-passively. How much are the benefits of that loyalty worth for you? A week or two more of PTO, the vesting schedule, those all (typically) have finite numbers you can attach to them.  So if someone offers you a job and it's significantly more than what you're making now+those benefits, would you take it?"

personalfinance,3e2wcz,andrewsmd87,2,Tue Jul 21 19:00:31 2015 UTC,"better yet, invite them over for dinner or a round of drinks and get to know them better. Chances are they will more likely to return the favor and invite you to events where they can introduce you to more people to network with."
personalfinance,3e2wcz,lethal_teapot,9,Tue Jul 21 17:43:46 2015 UTC,"Once you begin, spend the first six months as if you could lose the job any minute.  Build up emergency fund, keep expenses as low as you can tolerate.  Pay off any debt (credit cards, auto loans, etc..  At six months and one day... you might find you REALLY like your new position and the freedom of not working to play catch up with your bills.  Good for you!"

personalfinance,3e2wcz,thesouthpaw17,4,Tue Jul 21 17:08:44 2015 UTC,"Look into your state's unemployment compensation rules; in my state you'd likely be eligible to claim benefits retroactively for the weeks you were unemployed.  When I was between jobs last year, the benefits were more generous than I'd expected (~$500/week) and really softened the blow while I was looking for a new position.  You've been paying that insurance premium your entire working life; may as well file a claim for the benefits now that you need them."
personalfinance,3e2wcz,mumbling2myself,4,Tue Jul 21 17:42:18 2015 UTC,"Just an FYI - you can most likely leave your 401k in your prior employer's Plan.  Usually they only require distributions of account balances under $5,000 for terminated employees.  If I were you, I would just wait until you establish a new 401k with your new employer and rollover the funds then.  I think you're probably receiving better fund management in the 401ks then if you started managing it yourself in an IRA.  Plus you might make a mistake during the process and have to pay a penalty/tax.  Just my 2 cents..."
personalfinance,3e2wcz,tallmuscle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:00:32 2015 UTC,"I dunno about that, my IRA with Vanguard has much better fund choices than my current 401k."
personalfinance,3e2wcz,Kahnarble,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:51:09 2015 UTC,Most 401ks will start charging you fees if you're no longer an employee of the sponsoring employer. Rollovers are almost certainly the optimal strategy.
personalfinance,3e2wcz,Cricket620,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:54:28 2015 UTC,That's generally not legal unless the fees apply to all plan members (employees and former employees).
personalfinance,3e2wcz,btvn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:01:11 2015 UTC,"You misunderstand. Normally the fees are paid as part of employment. When that relationship ends, you now have to pay the fees, so it is generally in your interest to migrate to a rollover ira or new 401k at the new job."

personalfinance,3e2wcz,Libra8,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:12:35 2015 UTC,Let me ask you a question: Is that pay about average? Is pension and/or benefits included?  I just did some calculating and it just seems like a helluva lot more than what I'm used to. I've always viewed € 50K as a solid income but that does include pension and some other insurances.
personalfinance,3e2wcz,SuccumbedToReddit,2,Tue Jul 21 18:03:21 2015 UTC,"He doesn't say where he's at, which makes a huge difference, but $73k for an engineer with some experience is good but not exceptional in the US.  There are generally not pensions in the US for private jobs any more. Typically they would offer some matching percentage contributed to a 401k, which is a tax advantaged retirement account (you don't pay income taxes on money going in, but do pay when you start taking money out in retirement).  https://www.mtu.edu/engineering/outreach/welcome/salary/"
personalfinance,3e2wcz,leeloodallamultipass,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:39:40 2015 UTC,"Depends on the discipline of engineering he's in and where he lives. In my area (boston) I started at $76k as a software engineer,  but in the Midwest it's a bit less - likewise probably higher in Silicon Valley."
personalfinance,3e2wcz,noodle-face,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:43:25 2015 UTC,What about the living cost? I would have loads of money left with that income. My housing costs me about € 1000 after taxes.
personalfinance,3e2wcz,SuccumbedToReddit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:47:34 2015 UTC,"It depends where you live and how far you're willing to commute.  If I were to live in Boston I could get a small apartment for ~$2000/month if I had to guess, I've never looked. Outside Boston you're looking at larger apartments for $1000-1500 for example.  I live south of Boston and my mortgage on a 1500 sq foot house on 0.25 acres is $1900 a month. You can factor in the other living costs as needed, but that's my largest expense. I definitely don't have loads of money left at the end of the month even with my wife's income."
personalfinance,3e2wcz,noodle-face,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:54:12 2015 UTC,"It's a decent amount of money, about $10k more than the median American family.  I'd say it's towards the higher end of a normal income for an engineer with a few years of experience.  I'm starting out as a contractor with no benefits/paid time off/healthcare/retirement plan, working for $35/hour, which comes out to the 72.8k if I don't take any time off (I will take some time off, though, so my actual income will be probably more like 70k).  After six months, if they're happy with my work, they'll hire me as a full-time employee with benefits and everything.  There would be some more salary negotiating associated with that.  I would be not at all surprised if my salary takes a bit of a hit when they start giving me paid time off and healthcare and such.  The monetary value of my benefits at my previous employer came out to a little over $10k/year.  I live in a fairly expensive area about 15 miles outside of a major American city.  A very basic 1BR apartment would run me around $1200-1500 per month.  I am fortunate to be living rent-free with my parents in a mutually beneficial arrangement:  I help out with yardwork and fix the wifi when it stops working, they give me a free place to live."

This is an arbirtrary choice  - we could have chosen anywhere. It doesn't matter where we choose to label 'dx' because the integration will cover the curve.""  They can be great for gaining intuition / clearing up topics that professors can race through because they feel it's ""simple"" when in reality understanding something like ""how to find and label 'dx'"" is one of the most important pieces in solving certain problems.  At my campus, the physics teachers would derive formulas using multivariable vector calculus and linear algebra at 1000mph so watching Khan break it down was a lifesaver.

Interestingly enough, Vanguard does have an Australian-operated branch, so looks like it's available there.  I'm in New Zealand. As far as I know there aren't any ETFs other than NZX Smartshares. They look decent, to be honest."
personalfinance,3dzge3,SpudOfDoom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:51:34 2015 UTC,Vanguard stuff is more expensive in Australia. ETFs are basically the only good vanguard option as they only charge 0.2% rather than the 0.5-1% charges on their index fund accounts.

personalfinance,3e2io2,catfish491,18,Tue Jul 21 13:37:21 2015 UTC,I recently got a credit card from Citi and they mentioned the large number of inquiries when I bought a car as the reason my application wasn't automatically approved.  This 'counts as one' thing seems to be more of the popular wisdom of credit that isn't actually in the real algorithms.
personalfinance,3e2io2,leeloodallamultipass,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:49:53 2015 UTC,It is a real thing.  There are numerous credit scoring systems and the lender ultimately has discretion regardless of what your numerical score is.  It could be the case that Citi's algorithm flags applications with multiple hard pulls for human review.
personalfinance,3e2io2,IMNAD,13,Tue Jul 21 16:17:27 2015 UTC,"And it's at the discretion of every single other lender, thus making it conventional wisdom, not a real thing that's practiced across the board."

You should be able to call your sales guy and ask what the ""permissible purpose"" was and to get it corrected. They should be able to scamper around apologizing and get it straightened out for you.

Your credit report is required to show all inquiries, but the score does not have to include all of them as separate ones. If you think about it, what would you expect them to do? Just pick one randomly and delete the others?"
personalfinance,3e2io2,tinydonuts,3,Tue Jul 21 16:52:02 2015 UTC,"This is incorrect. Credit Karma just shows what's on the report from the credit bureaus. And the credit bureaus do individually track every inquiry. But when scoring, Credit Karma provides a Vantage Score, which does group multiple inquiries within a rolling 14-day window into one."
personalfinance,3e2io2,tinydonuts,2,Tue Jul 21 15:48:48 2015 UTC,"Not exactly. For the score, they will count as one. But individually they will all show up and some lenders count up how many inquiries there are in a period of time individualized to each lender.  OP, are you going to be applying for some other form of credit in the next 6-12 months? You might want to dispute them then. This sub often forgets that there's more to lending decisions than just your score."

personalfinance,3e2io2,peesteam,6,Tue Jul 21 14:21:30 2015 UTC,"When I bought my car, we had already agreed on the price and everything and then they wanted me to fill out the financing form. Saw the field for the SSN and refused to fill it in. They kept saying it was just for verification checking since I already had my own financing prepared. I didn't believe it of course and insisted that I will not fill out the form. They then tried to play it off as like ""If you aren't using our financing, we just use the form for record keeping."" Uh-huh, sure. The only time I would fill it out is if you think the dealer can get you a better interest rate. In my case, I pretty much had the best I could get (I shopped around a few places already) so there was no reason to fill it out. I think the dealer was surprised that I pushed back on it at all; I guess most people just fill out whatever is put in front of them."

If you go to an oil changers for a $50 service, and they're operating on a 20% margin, they make $10 profit. If they sell you an extra $10 service, or 20% more product, their profits increase by nearly 100%, assuming that the extra service doesn't cost them much to provide. My friend, who sold computers back in the day used to double his commission if he sold an extended warranty. Same with extra insurance at the car rental place.

It's a risk/reward thing. It's of great value to them to know who can and can't get a loan. The last thing they want to do is spend four hours on a Saturday showing cars to somebody who doesn't have a chance in hell of getting approved for financing."

A cheap lease in the US with downpayment  and your monthly payments for 3 years is around $8-9k for 3 years. Yes you may find a deal for maybe 6-7k but that is not the norm. A used car for 6-9k will last well over 3 years and if you sold it again after using it for 3 years you'd most likely get at least half of what you paid for it.

Hopefully someone here can clarify whether it is only personal assets or joint assets that must be used to satisfy a deceased spouse's debts.

personalfinance,3e3ipp,madhattergm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:01:03 2015 UTC,"A couple of things:  - make sure you can cover the minimums on everything you owe right now so you don't get hit with fees (I know, you're still paying interest, but you'll get to that);  - look on craigslist or similar situation for sublets/rooms to rent ($800/month sounds like more than you can afford for housing, but that's manageable).  You could get a room in someone else's apartment, or you could even find someone else who's really in a pinch, and have an actual roommate (like, two twin or double beds in one room - people do it lots of places).  If you find someone with an opposite schedule, you probably wouldn't even see each other too much.    Once you've got your rent stabilized at an amount that is between 1/4 and 1/2 your take home monthly income (so, if you're making $2K/mo total but lose $600 in taxes, you take home $1400/mo, meaning you should spend absolutely no more than $700/mo on rent, better to do $400-$500), then you can start paying down your debt.  The best way to do that is to pay more often than once a month - I used to pay weekly, now I pay every two weeks, but you cut down on the interest that's being charged, and reduce your overall balance, faster if you pay more often then monthly.  So if you make tips every day, why not make a small payment to your credit card every week?  Put a $5 in the back of your sock drawer every day, and at the end of the week, deposit that $35 in the bank and pay it to the credit card.  Do that for 4 weeks, and you'll have paid $140 off that card - 4 more weeks, and you're below $1000 on that card.  8 more months like that and it's done.  At the beginning, you can pay 3 weeks to the credit card, and 1 week to the phone bill until that's done.  Also, if you do this, call the phone company and tell them you don't have the money all at once, but that you're going to pay some every week, and ask them to put any fees on hold while you're paying it down - when they see you being proactive and responsible like that, they often will work with you.  Really soon you'll be at a point where you've paid it down and can move to a nicer apartment.  Good luck!"
personalfinance,3e2xza,ridingthepine,9,Tue Jul 21 15:35:31 2015 UTC,"Unless you have the worst plan imaginable, you can change your allocations at least quarterly. Just submit something that's close to what you want so you can get the paperwork in on time, then over-analyze everything and submit a change.   If you don't put in allocations right away, it should go into some default selection. The important part is to get the ""yes, I'm participating"" paperwork submitted in time. You can sort out the allocation later.   Make sure you set up an account with the plan administrator website so you can do this all yourself."
personalfinance,3e2xza,dakboy,7,Tue Jul 21 15:46:50 2015 UTC,"You have good index fund choices available for your domestic stock:  LargeCap S&P 500 Index  (0.31 expense ratio)  MidCap S&P 400 Index  (0.31% expense ratio)  SmallCap S&P 600 Index  (0.31% expense ratio)  For International, you don't have a great choice, but Diversified International at 1.06% expense is probably the best available.  For bonds and fixed income, there's no reason for you to allocate anything to a money market account, unless you're already at or very near retirement age, and it sounds like you're not.  I'd go with the lower expense ratio of the two available bond funds, the intermediate term at 0.71%.  As a quick-and-dirty allocation, to keep it simple, I might do:  40% Large Cap  10% Mid-Cap  10% Small-Cap  20% International  20% Bond  You can always tweak that to your personal preferences later on, but that should give you a reasonable starting point to meet today's deadline.

Remember, past performance is not indicative of future returns.  One of the big drivers of the star ratings is recent results.  In the short run, an actively managed fund can get lucky and beat their benchmark, but in the long run, studies have shown that the passively managed index funds will beat the vast majority of actively managed funds, and that is compounded by the lower management fees.  In short, low expense ratios / management fees trumps almost everything else."

personalfinance,3e2xza,bondsman333,4,Tue Jul 21 17:53:01 2015 UTC,"Two things:   Do you have any other retirement savings? Does the information you have mention anything about load/transaction fees when you drill down to individual funds?   If you have other retirement accounts to balance things out, I would take the advice of the Bogleheads wiki to approximate the total US stock market with 82% S&P 500 (large-cap), 11% S&P 400 (mid-cap), and 7% S&P 600 (small-cap), then rebalance your IRA/other savings to compensate for your underexposure to bonds and international stocks. (Edit: The rationale is because your 401k's domestic index choices are relatively cheap, while your bond and international stock choices are relatively expensive. You can get much cheaper choices on your own in an IRA.)  If there are no other retirement accounts, you'd have to make a judgement call between whether you want simple or cheap.  Simple:   100% target date fund, expense ratio around 0.95%   Cheap: I'd try to approximate a Vanguard-style allocation, so you'd have an 80%-20% split between stocks and bonds, and then a 60%-40% split between domestic stocks vs. international stocks; that would make your portfolio look like this:   40% S&P 500 (large-cap) 5% S&P 400 (mid-cap) 3% S&P 600 (small-cap) 32% diversified international 20% bond and mortgage   That gives an effective expense ratio of 0.63%, saves you 0.32% off of the target date fund.  Load fees would change this completely, though, since you'll probably want to avoid anything that has them unless you're planning on staying at this job for a very long time."

personalfinance,3e33up,ducktaleslol88,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:02:45 2015 UTC,Was your name on the CD? If not this probably falls under the gift tax realm. So $6k is under the exclusion and is not considered income to you.  It would not go on your tax returns and have no effect on your financial aid. If you're name and info was on the CD you will get a 1099 at year end. The taxable income will only be the earnings on the original investment (significantly less then $6k). It would also have little effect on financial aid.  If you really worried about it don't cash it until you start your last year of college.
personalfinance,3e33up,RV1982,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:46:58 2015 UTC,"It's not record-able income until it's claimed on something like a tax form.   While depositing it in a bank account is a paper trail in the event of an audit, that's not what determines income.  I could deposit, and withdraw the same $6000 ten times in a month- that doesn't mean I made $60k.   Until you claim it as income on your taxes (which legally you ought to do) it's not part of your income."

Aside from the psychological benefit, it's perfectly reasonable to pay the minimum for the lifetime of the loan and invest instead after down payment."
personalfinance,3e3gc2,whiteraven4,2,Tue Jul 21 17:44:32 2015 UTC,"Do you have enough to put a 20% down payment on a house?  That amount enables you to purchase without private mortgage insurance, which can add a couple hundred dollars extra to your monthly payment.  The student loans are not hurting your credit score and are actually a desirable trade line, more so than a credit card for example.  The interest rate is so low if you are getting more return elsewhere it does not make sense to pay more than the minimum."
personalfinance,3e3mi4,cinsurance,3,Tue Jul 21 18:24:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah a lapse in coverage will typically make your rates increase for a while, also being on your own insurance rather than piggybacked with your parents will be more expensive.

My personal bias is to use Vanguard mutual funds as an easy way of getting into the whole market. I have the majority of my entire investment portfolio invested in one fund: VTSAX, which just basically tracks the US stock market. It's done quite well since the market bottomed out in 2008."
personalfinance,3e3be5,I-Am-Work,12,Tue Jul 21 17:09:16 2015 UTC,529 invested into a broad market index fund is the only of those 3 things which would make sense with such a long time horizon.
personalfinance,3e3be5,ChillyCheese,9,Tue Jul 21 17:16:11 2015 UTC,"This is what a 529 is for!  529 savings plans are a state sponsored, tax sheltered, account where money can be deposited and grow tax free as long as the distributions are used for ""education expenses,"" which loosely means tuition, books, room and board, school supplies, etc. while the beneficiary is in school (any type of college, or even a trade school).  Some states provide a tax deduction to their residents to help get their residents to college. Other states don't. To find out if your state has a deduction, go here, click on your state, and pay attention to the ""State tax benefit"" line.  You can invest in any states 529 plan, but if your state has a tax deduction, it is normally best to invest in that plan. If your state does not have a tax deduction available, it is best to go with the lowest cost provider. The lowest that I have found is New York's 529, which is administered by Vanguard, so you have access to their no-load, low-cost, broad-market index funds, but has only a $25 minimum to start (unlike other Vanguard plans which have a $3,000 minimum).  If your child gets a scholarship and does not need all/some of the money, they can withdraw all/some of the money penalty free with some paperwork. However, income taxes would still be due on the gains. The principal deposits would not be taxed or penalized when withdrawn.  If your child decides not to go to school, they can take a non-qualified distribution by paying income taxes and a 10% penalty on the gains (I personally see this as a benefit, as it will encourage them to attend higher education and avoid this). The principal deposits would not be taxed or penalized when withdrawn.  If you have further questions, please feel free to ask."
personalfinance,3e3be5,AngryEEng,2,Tue Jul 21 17:18:38 2015 UTC,This sounds like a great plan of attack however California does not offer a state tax benefit. What if my child does not want to attend any type of schooling ... does the income tax and penalty fee outweigh just putting it into a savings account ?
personalfinance,3e3be5,PatternrettaP,3,Tue Jul 21 17:46:38 2015 UTC,Almost certainly. The rates on savings accounts are so low that even after 20 years it would have only earned 200 bucks or so. Now rates may go up. But an index fund will perform better over 20 years almost guaranteed  If it doesn't we will have bigger things to worry about.

You get to know neighborhoods, don't need to worry about where you're pointing that moving van, meeting work obligations when you can't find your toothbrush, etc. Yes you need to pack and pay for movers twice, but buying the wrong house because you were in a rush is much much more expensive. You always have the most leverage in a situation when you can walk away.   This gives you a chance to have the wedding, start new jobs, get used to the new and lower incomes, physically move house, and get used your new lives and what you'll want out of your new house. Room for a garden or a shed for storing skis might not matter now, but with more free time?   If ""West"" means Denver, good luck with what is currently one of the most competitive real estate markets in the US.

By contrast, if I take the sort of pay cut she is taking, then our opportunities to keep cash may be a little more limited. But I guess every bit helps.  Without going into too much detail, we are expecting a competitive real estate market. That's been part of what makes this whole house-hunting bit more stressful. I'm hoping that chatting with a real estate agent we know personally might help us get a little more direction.

No. Having read your post and comments, I would say you are anything but that. She's already in debt, the extent of which you do not know, and she refuses to change her habits to reduce her debt. Buying a house would only cripple her more, and likely make the entire situation much, much worse.   What does PF think in this regard?   I can't speak on behalf of the entire community. Looking at the comments, I would say the consensus is that you and your girlfriend need better communication, and that your girlfriends debt is ABSOLUTELY your concern BEFORE getting engaged, or sharing any finances.

Pop the question now, and assuming she says yes, start talking about wedding plans and costs of various things. Talk about where the money will come from to pay for it, and express how important financial transparency will be going forward.  3. Ignore it and keep going with your 2 year plan.

Without getting too much into relationship territory, you guys should seriously talk about financial situations, attitudes, goals, etc. before even thinking about getting engaged. You are absolutely not crazy for being worried about this. It sounds like you guys have some very fundamental differences in how you manage money which could create some really big issues for both of you down the road. Buying a house right now is her decision, true, but if you guys are serious about getting married you'll need to be able to talk about financial issues openly and honestly at some point."

That's pretty arbitrary, and it's not like you're asking her for her social security number and the passwords to her bank accounts.    You two should be able to talk about your finances and get on the same page before you get engaged, not after.  Money troubles can seriously wreck a relationship.    You should talk to her about how the decisions she makes now will affect the both of you should you choose to get married.  You can remind her that you're not trying to veto her choices, or control her money, but that you care about her and want to make she she is okay financially."

personalfinance,3e2ogk,twopointsisatrend,6,Tue Jul 21 19:18:26 2015 UTC,"Do not marry or get engaged until you find out how much she is in debt. Get all of her financial statements before you get engaged. One of the reasons why marriages end are due to financial problems. The fact is she is a debt consumer. She is in debt for her car, her school, her business, soon her house, and eventually she will need to be in debt to afford a wedding. It's not being handled appropriately here. Debt should be used short term, to make money, not have it linger around long term for decades. Any debt lingering past 7 years is a liability. If you can tackle a house between you two by living frugally and paying it down in 7 years you will be fine. But you can't if she has an exhaustive amount of debt. Never guess or assume how much she is in debt, if she owes the government it could be quite steep. Not only should you be worried, you should be terrified. Give her a strict talking to, and be assertive. Tell her to grow up and handle her financial issues if she ever wants to marry you. If you are intimate and marriage is a strong possibility, tell her directly about how you feel. It's just a plain bad idea to purchase a mortgage while in a state of uncontrollable spending and debt. Another possibility is to get a prenup, to separate finances upon marriage. This would be the smartest thing to do if you want to marry but don't want to be liable for her debts. What you pay upfront with a pre-nup you save long term by preventing the cost of the debt and divorce just in case."

IMO, let her make her choices and postpone your marriage plans.  If she can't trust you with her finances, marriage shouldn't be something to go forward with especially the way you are phrasing her reactions.

The deposit goes via your mortgage company and they would normally deal with the ins and outs of transferring money to the builders or developers. The developer can request a ""deposit"" on a new build to secure the plot. This would normally be refundable against the house price once you complete. If you don't complete they keep the deposit. This is to prevent people reserving the house and then having no means to complete the purchase. When I bought a new build in 2009 for £140k, the deposit to reserve the plot was around £500 which I had to pay direct to the developer. The house price was then reduced to £139500. So in essence if it is a deposit to secure the plot , yes you have to pay now to ensure the house will be reserved for you. Your mortgage deposit is not paid to the developer at all.

personalfinance,3e3qgz,angryblonde313,2,Tue Jul 21 18:51:27 2015 UTC,"Hello! Let me offer some advice, but first a brief story: My parents raised me right, but absolutely failed when it came to talking about finances. They always kept their finances in order, never in debt, or anything even close. But, they would not talk to my brother or me about it. ""That's for adults."" Not sure why they were like that, but when I went into the military, I was a financial  idiot! I could not balance a budget, and got into some credit card debt. I finally got it figured in my early / mid 20's out and 20 years later I have a solid understanding of personal finance.  My parents were super great with everything else. I love them both to pieces!   Credit cards are good to have provided you have discipline. If you are paycheck to paycheck right now because you are young and still partying, buying silly stuff, you may not have it in you to not incur tons of credit debt. Just be honest with yourself. That's not a dig or supposed to be insulting. I just wish that I knew that back then.  Getting a credit card is fairly easy. Find one you like and has good usage rules. Cash back and the like are awesome too.   Did I mention interest rate? No. Why? Here is why: Don't EVER put yourself in a position to have to pay interest. EVER. You don't have credit debt now, so interest is not a problem. Keep it that way. If you ever wind up thinking ""oh, it's just x percent and I can pay y."" You may get into trouble fairly quickly. I did. Please don't do that.   So, now you have a card and you want to use it help build credit scores, do this: Use your credit card for gas, groceries, phone bill, cable bill. Anything you ALREADY pay monthly bills on, try to put that on your CC. This way you get two things: 1) it shows that you use your CC AND you pay it off every month. We do this all the time, for the past 11 years. We have never paid interest and 2) we get a ton of points! Points can be used for different things, depending on the CC company. Ours lets up divert it to cash. So we get around $1000 per year in cash back. That's a whole lot better than any .1% interest the banks are giving.  But, it takes a lot of discipline. Please be careful. That is a hole that is hard to dig out of if you are not careful.   Wife and I are almost 40. We own our house (as in, no house payment! paid off last year). Own both cars outright. Zero student debt (she has a masters and I a bachelors.) All this is from someone who did not even know how to balance a check book when I was 22 years old."
personalfinance,3e3qgz,cqmaps,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:12:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you. That makes a lot of sense to pay monthly payments, and normal grocery and gas payments with a credit card. Should I use a debit card then for purchases like if I forget my lunch, or decide I need to buy an umbrella, or even clothes?"
personalfinance,3e3qgz,d57348937,2,Tue Jul 21 19:24:45 2015 UTC,"Figure out your credit situation. It is possible to get a general idea of your credit score from Credit Karma or mint.com. These are not your FICO, but they will be relatively close to you FICO score. Also you have the option to check your credit reports online. You get three reports annually, one from Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax. You can request them here https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action Based on your level of credit (you can usually search online for the level of credit needed for each card), determine what card meets your needs. http://www.nerdwallet.com/ is a good resource to search cards based on multiple criteria such as cash back and rewards. I would recommend CitiBank Double Cash Back or Discover IT/IT Chrome. Those are pretty good well rounded cards with decent APRs and some pretty good perks (no transaction fees, first late payment forgiveness, etc). Apply online, or in person, for a card. Most big banks have instant approval applications set up, or they can take up to a few days to process depending on your application. If you are denied then you can call the bank and ask why you were denied and maybe search for a cosigner. If you do not have the credit needed to be accepted for ANY cards then try a secured card from some place like Capital One. Basically you give them a sum of money and that is your credit limit. Then when you apply to an unsecured card you get the money back.    Tips: Do not apply to a ton of credit cards right off the bat. Hard inquiries like this stay on your report for two years and can add up if there are too many of them. Also, it is usually recommended to pay off the statement balance every month so that you do not pay interest on your transactions.   I apologize for the novel  TL;DR Check credit, find card, apply for card"

That's a shame from a planning perspective if it's the case since you'll have a ton of wasted tax-free space you could have taken advantage of with traditional tax-deferred accounts. If you're planning on working any more I'd immediately switch to putting any further contributions into a traditional 401k, at least.  That said, if you're already 55 your 401k is accessible immediately upon retirement, no need to do anything special around the 59.5 cutoff in this situation. If you really do have all of that in Roth accounts I'd probably pay off your mortgage in a lump sum, since there's no tax consequence to the large withdrawal."

personalfinance,3e37u2,bigw86,2,Tue Jul 21 16:45:34 2015 UTC,"Your credit score might decrease slightly if you close a card, for several reasons:   It lowers your total credit limit, which will increase your utilization percentage. It lowers your average account age. If you close your oldest card, it could reduce the overall length of your credit history. If you close your last card, it could reduce your credit score based on having a lower variety of credit.   The exact magnitude of the impact on your score depends on your individual situation. The last time I closed a card, the effect on my score was not noticeable.  You should not keep a card you don't use open if it has an annual fee. It isn't worth it.  The fact that you have 70% utilization on some cards will have a much, much larger effect on your score than closing one card will.

Some excellent no annual fee cards on the market:   Sallie Mae MC that /u/wutjustidonteven mentioned Chase Freedom: works broadly similar to the Discover IT, although it earns UR, 1 point = 1 cent, instead of straight cash back. I recommend not redeeming it like that and just accumulate points. They can then be transferred to the Sapphire Preferred, which can get much better value when transferred to airlines and hotels CapitalOne Quicksilver: 1.5% on everything, 20% discount on Uber until 4/2016), and no forex Citi Double Cash: 1% on purchase and 1% on payment (effective 2% on everything) Fidelity Amex: 2% on everything"

I think I saw a write up somewhere (maybe nerd wallet) that shows you the break even point above which it makes sense to have the AF version. And as you probably know AMEX has amazing customer service (at least in my 5 year experience with them) so thats a plus.

personalfinance,3e2wjg,Theriskyclick,4,Tue Jul 21 15:25:10 2015 UTC,"It's a crap shoot. If the company succeeds your future self will love you for having done the early exercise. You'll be able to cash out as soon as you're allowed and only pay ltcg tax. Whereas if you exercise later you're going to have that much more AMT income to realize and pay taxes on and then either have to leave those shares in a volatile market for a year, having already covered the tax liability (which is how people got wiped out in 2000), or you're going to be paying stcg if you cash out immediately.  But, most companies don't succeed :) Even companies that have a liquidity event get bought at such a price that common shares just break even and you're lucky to get back what you put it. Also, if you don't stay at the company, there's a good chance your shares will be diluted. And in the worst but most likely case, the company will fail or go in a firesale and all proceeds will go to the investors and you will never see any of the money you spent to exercise the options, and you'll have paid taxes on ""income"" you never saw.  So it largely comes down to a question of the bigger picture of your financial situation and live. How much is $20k to you (and how much will you be paying in taxes)? How committed are you to staying personally invested in this company? It's great that you believe in it, but realistically, what are the chances it'll succeed?  There's no obvious answer here. If you're young and have debt that could be paid off with that $20k and are likely to want to switch to something new and exciting in a year or two, I'd hold off. If you're a decade into your career, are well on-track with retirement investments, and have $20k lying around to gamble with this, then I'd strongly consider doing it. The main thing is I wouldn't put any money into this that you aren't prepared to never see again."

Pay $0 to wait on exercising and pay 28-40% STCG to sell immediately if your company goes public or exits. Pay $0 to wait on exercising plus $20,000 to wait for an extra year to pay 15-20% LTCG if your company goes public.

personalfinance,3e2ym0,Runrun110,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:33:49 2015 UTC,If you can handle the increase responsibly go ahead and do so. Continue to do so in the future as you earn more and are able to have higher credit lines. The larger that credit line and the longer the history will pay off in the future. In my case credit card piggybacking has become very profitable due to long histories and very high limits. Something to consider for the distant future. Additionally I think someone else mentioned utilization will look much better as well.
personalfinance,3e2ym0,dumbestFIquestion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:02:58 2015 UTC,"You mentioned to continue to ask for credit line increases in the future as your income increases. At what point is asking for more outweighed by the extra credit checks? For example, assuming my income steadily rises every few months, would it be detrimental to ask for an increase every few months or are those extra credit checks not worth it?   In other words, I'm just trying to get a feel for what you mean by ask for more every so often in the future."
personalfinance,3e2ym0,dumbestFIquestion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:16:50 2015 UTC,Personally I routinely make the increase requests once a year after job review and raise. I am not a credit expert but I'd suspect a credit check once every sixth months would be fairly safe and once a year (in my case) to be very safe.

personalfinance,3e2ym0,kanji_sasahara,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:23:38 2015 UTC,Not all credit cards do a hard pull for a cli. It depends on the bank. Amex is super generous. You can ask for a 3x increase 60 days after you get the card and they usually great it with no hard pull. Discover will also do increases without a hard pull up to a certain amount. And warn you if your requested increase would trigger a hard pull. I'm not sure about other banks.   Also lots of banks will review your file every six months or yearly and dish out small increases without prompting. So if you wait it may happen anyway. Depends on the bank.  One final note. The cc company doesn't have anyway verify you salary. It's all self reported. So minor fluctuations really don't matter. Just report a reasonable estimate of what you make or expect to make and leave it at that.   Edit: http://www.doctorofcredit.com/credit-cards/which-credit-card-companies-do-a-hard-pull-for-a-credit-limit-increase/  Seems boa always does a hard pull for a cli with a chance of an automatic increase every so often.
personalfinance,3e2ym0,Dunder-MifflinPaper,-2,Tue Jul 21 19:17:07 2015 UTC,"Soft vs. hard inquiry for credit limit increase  Honestly I don't think you need a credit line increase. Sure it might help with utilization, but utilization has no memory in that it resets each month. As long as you use it responsibly and pay the balance off in full on-time each month your credit score will be fine."
personalfinance,3e2ym0,Dunder-MifflinPaper,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:48:35 2015 UTC,"This makes sense. However, my personal expenses will be rising next year (since I am slowly transitioning to financial independence from my parents). Thus, currently, my average anticipated monthly expenses will be around 50% of my current credit line. That seems like a pretty high utilization, which will be consistent month to month. So, I'm not sure how the reset each month will help? Could you clarify?"
personalfinance,3e2ym0,crownjewel82,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:09:08 2015 UTC,"So, I'm not sure how the reset each month will help? Could you clarify?   Basically what he or she means is that theoretically if you had a 90% utilization for nine months and then on the tenth month you utilization is 2% when your credit score is checked by a lender, the only utilization that reports is the most recent. Therefore, your past nine months of bad utilization don't count against you. Its not a cumulative part of your credit score.   Conversely, say you had nine months of 2% utilization and then on the tenth, when you apply for a car loan, you're at 90%, those past nine months of low utilization effectively do you no good. The 90% is what is reported.   Its an instance in time, not a cumulative record (unlike other credit score components). If you were applying for credit soon, you could pay your balance early to make sure it reports a low figure for that month. But regardless the CLI wouldnt hurt except for a few months of a small hit from the inquiry, so go for it if you want it!"
personalfinance,3e1ucm,Creechrfeature,19,Tue Jul 21 08:42:57 2015 UTC,It depends on how much free time you have and how much money you make.

Typically, this applies to the property owner being responsible for repairs that impact the livability of the apartment.  For instance, the lease may state that tenants are responsible for any repairs under $50, but if the toilet is overflowing because it needs a $25 part, the obligation still falls to the landlord since that impacts the livability of the property."

They have closed the lobby, the roof deck, the common area, and are working soon on the elevators!  But with my lease, the amenities are covered by an ""amenity fee,"" not by the rent itself, so if that's the way yours is set up, you can maybe ask for a partial refund of that.  I doubt your lease promises any specific amenities though, so I'm not sure you would have legal recourse through the lease terms."

If so that smells like bullshit.   Check your state's laws. They may have a landlord/tenant court that will let you file a complaint about the amenities that you're paying for but not getting. You may even be able to pay your rent to the court while the dispute is being resolved.  Regardless, immediately go now to every apartment review site you can find and explain that the pools are not currently open and are not planned to be open any time soon.

personalfinance,3e2t6q,RocketSafety,4,Tue Jul 21 16:59:24 2015 UTC,"Here is how I approach this (YMMV)   True ""emergency"" money, meaning the power is out, the banks have shut down, we are snowed in, whatever. This is cash under the mattress (not literally but it's cash in the house): $350-500 dollars. It fluctuates as my wife forgets to go to the ATM and takes some now and then. My emergency fund: In an online high-yield (LOL!) savings account. 5-10k. This takes 24-48 hours to put your hands on, but let's be honest. If my transmission goes and I need $1,200, I don't need it right that second. I need it when the credit card bill cycles.   When it gets up to 10k, I take 5k and put it somewhere else, investments, debt repayment, kids college fund, etc.  If interest rates were higher, I'd suggest a CD ladder. Again, if you lose your job or something happens, you very rarely need all the money right now. A 6 month job loss, with CDs that mature quarterly, would be fine to carry you through.  But don't put it in the market. That defeats the whole purpose. If you look at the risks and rewards of how much you might need, what you might gain or lose, etc, and you decide to put it in the market, OK, but I think it stops being an emergency fund at that point."

If you don't have $6k in the bank, you probably can't afford ownership.  The house might be cheap, but repairs could still be expensive.    Also, why's the house so cheap?  Just a really cheap area, or is it ""as is"", has a tax lien on it, something to that effect?  If you're in a economically depressed area, consider whether you want to be tied down there."

Also, I'm guessing that any house listed at $29,000 is going to need significant repairs or back payments to clear the title, hence why it's so cheap - meaning that your necessary investment is going to be far above $29k. Let's say $50k all-in for nice round numbers. Original point still stands: if you can't save/pull together $10k for a down payment, then you have no business being a homeowner."

personalfinance,3e2jf6,_Berticus,4,Tue Jul 21 13:39:57 2015 UTC,"OP, I'll assume you're based in the UK.  The agency needs your sort code, account number and payee name (and bank) in order to perform a BACS payment into your bank account. As for passport (and your NI No.) this is for tax and immigration purposes and as they have the legal obligation to ensure you are legally allowed to work in the UK. Passport is the the most common acceptable proof that most people have so that's probably why that's the only document they asked for."
personalfinance,3e2jf6,S__L,3,Tue Jul 21 16:30:09 2015 UTC,This is the correct answer.  If it's an employment agency and they are looking after payroll then they need these details in order to:   a) Confirm that you have the legal right to work in the United Kingdom.  b) Pay you.  There is normally no other reason to give your details to an employment agency or (and especially not) a recruitment agency.

You'll live there a long time and will have the chance to re-fill your Roth IRA account.  But if you don't want to be tied to with a mortgage, then don't.

But -- most of the houses in this area (Clear Lake, Webster, League City, Friendswood, etc) have at least something of an HOA, which means you'll have annual community fees. Your trash/sewer is usually part of the water bill so you don't get out of that either you just pay it to someone other than your landlord. Don't forget that you'll also be responsible for property taxes and homeowners insurance (which is more than renter's insurance).  It also doesn't bode well if you've ""squandered"" your first few years working and have nothing to show for it. Houses can have a lower mortgage payment than rent but the costs can add up quickly. If you think the valet trash is expensive, you should see what it costs to have your A/C replaced. Or your roof replaced. Cash is king if you own property."

You're going to want to stop working at some point. Or your car is going to need a new engine. Or your kid will need to see a doctor. So on and so forth.

It's great that you're deferring enough to take full advantage of your employer's matching.  I can't tell you how many peoples' accounts I have seen that are not doing this.  The only thing I can think to add, is that you might want to spend some time really understanding what investments your currently holding and what their fees are (if any).  Make sure you're investing with an appropriate risk allocation that will gradually become less risky as you age.       Also, good job on assessing interest rates on your loans versus investment returns.  That is a solid decision making tool.    Oh yeah, and try to never repay your family loan haha (jk).  Though, the longer you wait to pay them the better off you'll be (not nice if you're looking out for their interests).  But any dollars you pay on the family loan are dollars that you can't invest and you're missing out on the opportunity for earning interest/returns.    I might be wrong but I think there might be specific federal accounts that you can open for saving for kids' school.  You should look into if there's something that exists that might let you invest (maybe even pretax dollars) for specifically saving for school without having to pay penalties on withdrawals (or taxes on the gains).  Most 401ks have terms for qualifying events (such as first time home buying, certain higher education expenses, etc...) that might work too.    Good luck!"

personalfinance,3e3jgk,phat1forever,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:29:42 2015 UTC,"I think the answer is much more complex than a $1500 bond.  There are many other important factors and items that need to be known.  What is your income?  Are the loans all federal, or are some private?  Do you have an emergency fund?  Lets assume all the loans are federal.  First, get set up for IBR or PAYE repayment plans.  They will help reduce the monthly amount you have to pay.  Work on your budget and dial it in a bit (assuming it isn't).  Build an emergency fund of 2-3 months.  Once you have that, see how much extra monthly income you have left and pay that towards your loans.  I wouldnt really use the bond right now, personally.  So to give you a break down from personal experience.  I had ~70k in loans 2.5 years ago.  At the time, I graduated and was making like $17/hr working sorta full time.  I made ~2k per month.  I was making like $200/month payment.  After 6 months I got a job at my current company making ~ 45k.  Then, my monthly payment went to ~700/month.  After 6 months I got promoted to full time real employee.  Then I bumped it up to 1000-1200/month.  However, I had ~7000 saved at this time in an emergency fund.  Over the last 5 months I burned the emergency fund on various emergencies and things.  So for the next 6-10 months I will be dropping my monthly payment to $600 to build my fund back up to ~6-8k again.  My minimum payment is currently like $240 on IBR and will become ~$530 in October once IBR runs out (my income is to high in relation to my loans to qualify for IBR again).  A few other things.  With IBR, if your income is low, then your required monthly payment could be $0, and interest will be covered, so it wont accrue on any subsidized loans.  Setting up auto-pay for most providers (I have Nelnet), will reduce your interest rate by .25%."
personalfinance,3e2n73,ulta,3,Tue Jul 21 14:12:17 2015 UTC,"""It's complicated"". I'd recommend reading http://fairmark.com/execcomp/isoexer.htm, and you may want to seek professional advice if this is a lot of money.  At a high level, yes, if you're in AMT-land you pay capital gains on the difference between the sale price and the value at exercise (on which you were taxed). But, if it's a small amount of AMT income when you exercise the ISO you may not end up liable for any AMT on them, in which case the basis would just be what you paid.  You probably also want to think about whether it would be a good idea to do an early exercise and 83b election if the 409A valuation is still close to the strike price."

personalfinance,3e3bln,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:30:27 2015 UTC,"You can't be kicked off IBR or PAYE for making too much money. They'll just increase your monthly payment until it maxes out at what you would have paid on the 10-year standard plan.  As for the best approach going forward, keep in mind that the loan repayment estimator isn't going to be 100% accurate since you're already a couple of years into repayment. However, if we use a starting AGI of $42,000, you end up paying a little under $95,000 in principal and interest over the life of the loan. Then let's say for the sake of simplicity that you owe another $15,000 in taxes on the forgiven balance. This brings the total up to $110,000 which is significantly higher than what you would have paid on a 10-year plan (~$87,000). Paying off the loan in 15 years would also be a bit less expensive overall (~$100,000)."

Common wisdom is to them save for retirement (at the very least get the matching amount), then save for a house.  This is because tax advantaged retirement is great to sock away when you are young, and every missed tax advantage is something you cannot get back.  Ultimately, this means you probably won't have enough for a down payment till you are late twenties.  You could skip retirement, and just save for the house, but most people wouldn't recommend that.

Save as much money as you can.  ** please read ** Student loans don't work the way you think they do in Canada. You apply for student loans under your name. The only way your parents are involved is that you have to include their income. Because if all rich kids applied too, there wouldn't be enough money for everybody.  I have applied in both BC and AB. I got $11000 and decreasing down to $4000 in my 6 years of school. Some of the amounts I got were like $2000 grants (so free money because I was low income).   Sure you can think of loans as a burden or you can think of them as an opportunity to go to school. I have $38000 now because I did 6 years. I graduated in April and don't need to start paying them until November. My minimum payment is $400 which is doable because I now have a good job.   I'd recommend doing an on campus job during school or something flexible like babysitting - do more date nights on good weeks of college, say no I can't when it's midterms. Even in the summer, I would work as a summer nanny with a rich family. I'd take care of 2-3 kids from 7-5 M-F at $17/hr. I ate all three meals there and did fun stuff all day.

Car is the 2nd biggest money pit after a house due to gas, maintenance, insurance, and parking. Pretty clear why a house is the number one money drainer.  Share a room with a friend or a girlfriend/boyfriend instead. This splits the cost of 1 room in half. Just like it was in college where you get a bunk mate in a dorm.  Google the 1 dollar a day diet, and try to eat for only 2-3 bucks a day if you can't do 1 dollar a day. It's not that bad, just buy in bulk and mostly grains and unpackaged foods.  Limit your cell phone use, find a plan for 5- 15 bucks a month, they exist. Do comparative shopping.  Doing just these 4 things, you will have HUGE margins of savings. Thousands a month. If you save 2k per month you can tackle your debt in about 27 months!  For the extra boost, working as a waiter for couple of days over the weekends is a great way to add to your income. Huge margins for tips especially on busy Fridays and Saturdays. Many people live off tips."

I think you are jumping the gun working out the monthly payments. First you need to work out if the deal is actually worthwhile at all.  Easiest way to work this is find out what the value of the house is. How much more than 250.000 Euro is it worth? And is that extra amount enough for you to basically pay your parents 14.400 Euro each year for the rest of their lives. All depends on the value of the house and how old your parents are.  Once you are satisfied with that, then you can work out if it also works out with your monthly income and expenses.

I honestly think that 1000€/appartment earnings is way too high in your calculation. there are many many things you have to pay from the money your tenants pay you and assuming that those 1000€ are without betriebskosten, you expect a total price of about 1400€ per appartment for the tenants?   but assuming that your calculation is right (i have a lot of assumptions which my be totally wrong), keep in mind that you will be in troubles as soon as one of the flats has no tenants (which will happen!).  imho you can't afford this ""offer"". not if your parents are not willing to pay anything for the years they'll live in it.   and like others said, it's also not a fair offer. you will pay about 336.000€ for the house. how much money do you think is it worth? only the difference between 336.000 and the market value is what you get from your parents."

If you decide to do it, I would recommend that you go through the formal house purchase process including procuring your own mortgage for the 250,000 euros, getting a home inspection, and getting an appraisal.  If the home inspection turns up serious issues, don't go forward with the deal.  If the appraisal shows the house isn't worth much more that 250,000 euros then letting your parents live there for free would be at your expense and you would be better off not going forward with the deal.

There are plenty of places around to read about how to make your allocation more risky to chase a slightly higher return, or how to make it more conservative if you really want to, but just going with a 20XX 'target date' fund is your best choice.  If you're worried about losing money now, you're looking at too short of a time period. The market may go up or down in the short term, but just because the entire market is doing poorly for a few months, or a few years, that doesn't mean you can't still do well in the long term (and vice versa).

The hard pull may have brought down my score a bit, but since it cut credit utilization by a large amount, my credit went up.  This had the domino effect and the better credit meant I got higher limits, high limits meant even more better credit.  I had about 50% utilization though, so if you're not using as much you might see a much smaller change in your numbers.  An obvious but much needed word of caution though, just because your credit card balance appears to be $0 doesn't mean it's suddenly time to spend it!  Also, personal loans do charge a fee to take over your loan and if you plan to pay it down quickly, this fee will likely mean you're actually paying MORE than if you just quickly paid down the credit card at the high APR.

personalfinance,3e2qhb,ToonisAtNight,3,Tue Jul 21 14:38:49 2015 UTC,"I personally think the best thing you can do for yourself is to hold onto that $60k and use it to pay for your schooling.   Student loan rates can vary greatly, and it's something you'll be paying off for the next 30 years.   Also, unlike a mortgage, deducting student loan interest is basically useless for a lot of people. You can only deduct (if I recall) up to $2500 in student loan interest per year, but ONLY if you make less than $80,000/year.   If you're serious about school, then save it for that. Interest rates are still pretty crappy for banks, so there's no way to accrue any real interest in that money. But just shop around for the best rates you can find, and use it to pay those tuition fees.   Oh, and if your mom lives close to the school you eventually want to go to, just stay home and save that money."

personalfinance,3e2qhb,APartyInMyPants,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:12:01 2015 UTC,"Part-time vs. full-time is a question more for you than anyone.   Personally, I couldn't do part time. I would get too distracted by work and social life that it would hurt schooling. So I'm the type who would just need to go back all in. However if you do full-time, still work. I found I was more motivated and did better in school when I had a part-time job. Something about knowing 15-20 hours a week was going to a job made me use my free time better focused on my schooling.   How you choose to do your schooling should have little bearing on getting a job in finance. You'll likely need (or want) an internship at some point. Partly to fulfill college credit, partly to get your foot in the door with a company. Some places may like how you worked hard through school to get where you are. Some places may not care. But no one will see it as a negative, as long as your grades are good, you get some good internship experience and maybe you make a few connections along the way, those are the only things that matter.   In terms of investing in a vanguard fund to pay off loans, that's generally a bad idea. Keep in mind when you buy into, and especially sell out of, a fund like that, not only do you pay a commission to the broker on the sale, but you also have to pay taxes on any profits you earn. Whereas there's no inheritance tax on the initial $60,000. Plus. Let's say you finish college in three years. The amount you'll end up making in the fund before you have to start paying off your loans just may end up being an absolute wash.   In terms of taking out loans to build up credit. Yes, while that will help build your credit, there are other ways to build credit as well. Credit cards. Paying your bill on-time. You're still young, so don't concern yourself with giving yourself an unnecessary loan just for the sake of building credit. Because shit happens. You may encounter some unforeseen reason where you suddenly have to leave school. But you've already saddled yourself with this loan. And once you're not in school, that lender is going to want to get paid. So now not only are you not in school, but you're now eating into your $60,000 principle with a loan that isn't currently getting you anywhere. So pay as you go, and if some life event pauses school for you for a period of time, it doesn't matter.   You may also want to look into Illinois' 529 plan.   http://www.savingforcollege.com/529_plan_details/index.php?state_id=14&page=plans_by_state  http://www.forbes.com/sites/learnvest/2013/07/18/529-savings-plans-9-mistakes-people-often-make/  You can put all $60k into a 529. There are fees associated with a 529, and someone more knowledgeable than me will be better suited in explaining the benefits of one of these funds (the Forbes article provides some info). But I believe you can then continue to contribute to your 529 until, and while, you're in school. You receive a smaller tax deduction in Illinois for doing so, but it should help in the long-run."

More specifically, I have a checking account that my work deposits money into. No one else has that account number. I have a savings account that is my emergency fund. No one has that account number. I then have numerous money market accounts, one for each servicer so that if something funny happens in an account, I can easily trace who screwed up. I look at what the auto payment is supposed to be and transfer that money into the account each month.  This ends up being more work, but (1) I make sure that nothing that you have described can happen, (2) I can quickly glance to see which bills have money allocated and which ones have the auto-payments come through, (3) I have a list of bills to check every single time, and (4) pushing that money into the accounts lets me know how much money I actually have that isn't accounted for.

If I pay it by phone will that be reflected on my online account? I've been only paying online up until now.   And can I direct all of my payment to the 6.8% loan (I pay $200 a month) each month?
personalfinance,3dy0hr,SmashedCarrots,2,Tue Jul 21 00:29:01 2015 UTC,"1: Depends on your loan provider.  Some of my loans are with a provider that didn't allow online principle payments to a specific loan, so I did minimum payments online and paid additional principle by telephone.  Another loan provider is wicked cool and lets me run it all online.    2: Your payment history should reflect all payments, whether online, by telephone, or through snail mail.    3:  No.  Each loan has a minimum payment every month.  Say you have three loans with minimum payments of $100, $60, and $40.  You must pay those amounts to those loans every month.  However, you can then choose to pay an additional $30 or to any one of those.  As you've seen, the convenience of allocating that $30 can vary by loan provider."

A My FedLoan rep once gave me a ""Financial Summary"" that was incomplete and had edited dates in it. When I said I'm looking at my Bank statements and I don't see anything on or around 12/29 he said ""Maybe someone hacked your account and made those payments."" I was speechless.

Why do you have to call its a mystery.....  3 different reps have said this to us. And 2 reps have done it for us.   My honest interpretation from the outside is that basically these loan servicers is that they are uninterested in providing more than the required services. As such they dont hire A plus tech talent nor do they make improvements that people really want.  Their technical architecture is probably a set of islands that are held together by duct tape.

After I make that non autodraft payment I call them and direct which loan I want that money to go to.  That's what a rep told me when I asked about targeting a specific loan (like the site says you can do).  I assume they do this because it makes them more money. I have two loans: Big Loan Little Interest, Little Loan Big Interest. I'm trying to kill the LLBI first, but if I went with auto draft only, the lion share of my payment would go to BLLI- extending the amount of time LLBI would take to be paid off.

Eventually I talked to someone that actually explained how they apply payments really well. For sake of ease, let's say your minimum payment is $500 every month and it is due on the 1st of the month. If you pay $500 on the first of the month it is applied to all of your loans ""equally"" as your payment breakdown constitutes. If you pay $600 on the first, $500 is spread across the loans as normal, and then the extra $100 goes to the highest interest rate loan.(I don't know if it is the loan with the highest or lowest remaining balance if they are the same interest rate)   However, let's say you make your $500 on the first of the month, but then the next day realize you have $100 you want to put towards your loans. So you make a separate payment and they will then split it across all of your loans evenly unless you specify otherwise through email or calling. Note: the payment has to be posted before you can specify which loan it goes to, which is normally a couple of days."

personalfinance,3dy0hr,constructionPE,3,Mon Jul 20 21:03:15 2015 UTC,"I actually tried doing this with GL a few weeks ago and they never reduced my interest rate. I tried contacting them, no response. Just an FYI, don't assume it's automatically going to happen. I might need to call some people to get it working, since I've heard bad things about Great Lakes especially."

personalfinance,3dy0hr,s1eep,3,Mon Jul 20 20:15:46 2015 UTC,I'm in my grace period so I've been putting this off. But you've motivated me to start my payment plan early!
personalfinance,3dy0hr,rengarenekton,5,Mon Jul 20 20:29:28 2015 UTC,"Glad I could motivate you, but if you haven't paid off your interest yet do it right away, before you enter repayment. Once you enter repayment, it capitalizes. So if you had a $5k loan with $500 interest, once it capitalizes, you're now paying interest on $5.5k."
personalfinance,3dy0hr,ANGR1ST,3,Mon Jul 20 20:40:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you! My loans are held by FedLoan Servicing and I had no idea I could do this. My total balance is around $50k, so any interest reduction is a pretty big deal to me."
personalfinance,3dy0hr,siphontheenigma,2,Mon Jul 20 20:19:35 2015 UTC,"I'd love to do this but due to past mistakes, I have a shit load of fears."
personalfinance,3dy0hr,Potterless12,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:22:31 2015 UTC,"Look into it a lot, they've got a very helpful faq section. You could also write down all your questions and then ask them, as well as leave space to write down their answers."
personalfinance,3dy0hr,anxiety23,2,Mon Jul 20 20:23:54 2015 UTC,"I have enjoyed Great Lakes but I will let you know something I did that really helped me control how I have paid my student loans.  Call them and ask them to split all your different loans (they call them toekns) into different accounts.  They claim that they apply everything to the token with the highest interest rate, but that is false.  They apply it evenly across every one.  Splitting them into different accounts allows you to control where your extra payment goes and helps you not pay as much in the long run."
personalfinance,3dy0hr,moose6434,2,Mon Jul 20 18:24:07 2015 UTC,"SOFI does as well. it's a common practice. I love SOFI because they took off 10 years on my 30 year loan and saved me almost $200,000 (also lowered the interest rate)"
personalfinance,3dy0hr,moose6434,2,Mon Jul 20 19:36:03 2015 UTC,"LPT: If you have multiple loans, check to see which loans the money is getting applied to. I had three total federal loans serviced through Nelnet, two low interest and one grad plus that was relatively high. They were all paid ahead. So, I was still making monthly payments, but just paying down the balances before they came due. When I went to auto pay, I lost the ability to direct my payments to the loan that I wanted and a lot of my money was going to the low interest loans in stead of the plus loan. I actually saved more by canceling auto pay and then directing all of my excess payments into the high interest loan."
personalfinance,3dy0hr,MidnightBlueDragon,2,Mon Jul 20 20:39:01 2015 UTC,"Apparently, Nelnet does this as well. The only thing I was worried about is the way I have been paying, I have been paying extra towards the highest interest rate loan, so that way I pay it off first (which it should be paid off by the end of this year, huzzah!). So, to the chat I went:   Candace S.:    Hello. Thank you for contacting Nelnet, my name is Candace. Don't forget to sign up for automatic payments with our Auto Debit system (KwikPay) on your online Manage My Account page to stay on top of your payments and take advantage of a .25% interest rate reduction! (for eligible >borrowers) May I please have your first and last name?   Samantha [last name]:  Samantha [last name]  Candace S.:    Thanks how can I assist you today?   Samantha [last name]:  Hi Candace, I was actually looking at setting up KwikPay, and was wondering where any extra money over my monthly amount due would go  Candace S.:    Interest accrues daily. When a payment is received, it is first applied to outstanding accrued interest, and finally to principal. Any additional payment amount received is automatically applied to outstanding interest to satisfy and then remaining principal.  Samantha [last name]:  I get that. I just mean which account.  Candace S.:    Group?  Candace S.:    All of them as evenly as possible.   Samantha [last name]:  Is there any way to specify that I want any extra applied to a single group?  Samantha [last name]:  Trying to pay off the highest interest rate one first.  Candace S.:    Sure you can email our customer service team and >request special auto debit directions and state how you would like the additional funds applied.   Candace S.:    Please email: nelnetcustomersolutions@nelnet.com and include the following in the body of the e-mail: 1) Your account number 2) First and Last Name 3) Address 4) City, State, ZIP 5) Date of Birth   Samantha [last name]:  Alright; thanks Candace!   So, if you have any special debiting options, you can do it. We'll see about how well it works. I'll try this month, and if it doesn't work like I want it to, back to paying manually."

personalfinance,3dy0hr,moose6434,3,Mon Jul 20 23:02:53 2015 UTC,They also accept payments and then claim you are overdue by one payment on your next statement! Incompetent.
personalfinance,3dy0hr,BadWolf89,4,Tue Jul 21 12:59:18 2015 UTC,"That's like getting tossed a mint by the person who raped you when you were too naive to understand what you were getting into.  The reason college is so expensive is because there exists such a thing as a standard ""Student Loan"". The same is true for homes and autos. It is why a car depreciates over 50% once it's driven off the lot, and why houses in a ghetto are dirt cheap (everyone has bad credit and can't get a loan).  Remember that episode of Futurama where Nixon gives everyone a $500 and shops all raise their prices by $500? That's basically what is happening. Except we're expected to pay back $750+ after we spend it."
personalfinance,3dy0hr,moose6434,3,Mon Jul 20 19:45:32 2015 UTC,"For me, it was actually NOT worth it. My loan servicer does not let you use the avalanche method for loan repayment if you use automatic payments. If I did the automatic payments, the cost to me of having my higher interest loan carrying longer far outweighed any benefit of slightly lower interest. Maybe when I'm down to just one loan I will take advantage of it, but it doesn't make sense for me now."
personalfinance,3dy0hr,BurritoNipples,6,Mon Jul 20 19:46:24 2015 UTC,"You usually have to sign up for auto-debit for the normal minimums on all loans. Then you can manually make an additional avalanche payment. (Sometimes you need to ""un-group"" the loans to do this.) So you can still do both and that the free tiny bit of money it saves you."
personalfinance,3dy0hr,Lost-OneJadeMonkey,0,Mon Jul 20 21:33:00 2015 UTC,Fedloan would not let me do this. They made me get a cashier's check and send it by certified mail to make additional payments once I was on auto pay.   Then they were kind enough to continue withdrawing payments from my checking account for THREE MONTHS after my loans were paid in full. Still can't get them to reimburse me...
personalfinance,3dy0hr,imhere2party,4,Mon Jul 20 17:48:30 2015 UTC,You can still apply manual payments even with the automatic payments set up. I signed up for absolute minimum and then I use the extra to focus on which one I want to pay off first.
personalfinance,3dy0hr,MidnightBlueDragon,2,Mon Jul 20 18:01:21 2015 UTC,"That's what I plan to do, since I'm not in repayment, I don't necessarily want to start paying everything right away if I need the money for books or whatever, so I'll just bum Netflix off my roomate for a few months to sacrifice a measly $5/month toward my loans."
personalfinance,3dy0hr,NoMedlenWithMinors,0,Tue Jul 21 00:02:30 2015 UTC,You do know that you can set your automatic payments to be more than the minimum due right? Also you cN manually make as many payments as you want. It literally takes 30 seconds on your part.
personalfinance,3dy0hr,BadWolf89,2,Mon Jul 20 18:14:44 2015 UTC,FedLoans makes you mail in like 3 personal proofs of who you are - drivers license and whatnot. It's SUCH a pain in the ass. Doesn't auto-pay help the lender like WAY more than .25% - you would think they would make it easy for you to sign up for.
personalfinance,3dy0hr,jdfertig,3,Mon Jul 20 18:19:21 2015 UTC,Great Lakes is my services and I didn't have to do anything. A girl called me before I went into repayment and we set it up.

I have loans ranging from 3.4% to 6.8%, and what I found was that by paying the 6.8% down faster, they would use my autopay to ""catch-up"" the lower interest loans that were not as far paid in advance.  Sometimes none of the payment would go to the 6.8% loans.    In essence they were allocating my funds as poorly as possible for me.  I decided I was better off cancelling autopay and allocating the funds myself.  Not even close to worth the 0.25% in this case."

personalfinance,3dynqe,eccitaze,12,Mon Jul 20 20:25:25 2015 UTC,They're under pressure to deliver quickly plus statistically I'm sure delivery drivers drive more than your average non-delivery worker.
personalfinance,3dynqe,LogicalFool420,0,Mon Jul 20 20:34:40 2015 UTC,"As others have said: There's a huge incentive to drive aggressively due to the time pressure (faster deliveries=more tips and more deliveries per hour=more money). In addition, delivery drivers have to drive to over a dozen different places over the course of one shift, leaving them more prone to getting lost, making wrong turns, driving illegally (i.e. wrong way down a one-way street), etc. Compare this to your route, where it may be longer, but you know it well enough so that you can navigate it by heart. You might know that it's better to turn on one street versus another to avoid traffic, A pizza delivery guy might not know that, and unintentionally end up in a situation where he has to cut across 3-4 lanes of traffic to make a turn.  It's all that risk--both from the incentive to drive aggressively, and the nature of the job forcing drivers to drive constantly in unfamiliar territory--that pushes insurance rates so high."
personalfinance,3dynqe,viveislife,2,Mon Jul 20 20:53:37 2015 UTC,"Not really correct. Doesn't have so much to do with the driver as it does the litigation and settlement end of claims.

However, the guy you were talking to probably didn't know what he was talking about and didn't think about re-writing the policy commercial. Call an independent broker who represents Progressive and they can hook you up easy."
personalfinance,3dynqe,TheLordB,4,Tue Jul 21 14:47:42 2015 UTC,"They likely only have Hired & Non-Owned auto liability as part of their policies. It would be ridiculously expensive to schedule each employee's auto onto an auto/fleet policy.  And with high turn around of food service industry, it's not feasible or smart business to do so - there would be many more contracts/waivers needed from employees to have this happen.  With HNOA tacked onto the company's general liability policy, employees' personal auto policies would respond first in the event of a claim, and should the limits of that policy be exhausted, then the company's policy would respond.  The employee's personal auto policy is primary."
personalfinance,3dynqe,crazy_eric,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:34:27 2015 UTC,Except almost no personal auto policies cover you at all.  So basically there is no primary and their other insurance is always primary at least if the employee is truthful to insurance.

personalfinance,3dynqe,ratbat2000,33,Tue Jul 21 07:51:46 2015 UTC,"Never looked into Lyft, but with Uber this is not exactly true.   Uber COMMERCIAL insurance is primary when there is a passenger in the car. Their collision/comprehensive insurance is SECONDARY in all cases where they claim it is applicable. Never is Uber's collision/comprehensive primary; it is always SECONDARY. Meaning they need you to fess up to your personal insurance in order to get a denial, which you don't do because you'll lose your personal insurance. Meaning, they really expect you to make a claim with your personal insurance leaving out the fact that you work for Uber and were working during the accident. Only way to get insurance to cover your ass is to lie.  If you don't lie, your insurance company will refund the premiums you paid, and cancel your policy. When you try to get another policy, you'll be screwed because there is a question on the application about having your policy canceled and refunded before.   And even when you're not at fault for the accident, you're still in very bad shape. Your passenger may have gotten hurt, in which case s/he might have gotten a lawyer to get a claim from your insurance. Even if they don't, the at-fault driver and his insurance will try to game you by lying. Usually when that happens your own insurance company and their lawyers on retainer (which comes from premiums you've paid) will get involved and put the other insurance company in its place. Since your insurance would have been canceled, you're shit out of luck and all the premiums you've paid prior to that meant nothing. You would have to get your own lawyer, file your own claims, and do everything yourself.  This is why I think driving for Uber is much more riskier than most people realize. People are not pricing into consideration of the difficulty after getting into an accident."

personalfinance,3dynqe,dan_232,3,Mon Jul 20 23:39:55 2015 UTC,"In practice, the whole thing is very shady. The additional insurance is far too expensive to consider even doing the job for minimum wage + tips - car upkeep. Managers just tell you to make sure you don't get in an accident that's your fault and in any case to hide all evidence that you were at work. Your best chance is to hope that the other driver doesn't mention to your insurance company that there was a delivery sign on your car. Tbh, companies like Pizza Hut need to eat the cost of insuring their own drivers. Instead, they just downplay any accidents (speaking from experience) and just fire anyone who is at fault because there is always another driver ready to take your spot. I've never met another driver who opted for the special insurance, but that's hardly a comprehensive sample.  TL;DR - don't get in an accident but if you do then LOLSUX"
personalfinance,3dynqe,bokbok,5,Mon Jul 20 23:41:12 2015 UTC,The 'business use' endorsement doesn't usually cover delivery drivers so that's out of the question.

The straight dope, from Uber's insurance policy:   B. General Conditions, 4. Other Insurance a. ""For any covered ""auto"" you own, this coverage form provides primary insurance. For any covered ""auto"" you don't own, the insurance provided by this coverage is excess...   ""You"" is defined in the Declarations section of the policy as Raiser LLC, aka Uber. Not Uber's independent contractors (drivers).  People are foolish to expect appropriate insurance coverage without paying the appropriate premium. Furthermore, Uber and other rideshare companies define their drivers as ""independent contractors"". That is a legal and tax term. Don't expect someone else's insurance carrier to be looking out for you when they qualify your relationship with them as ""independent contractor"". They won't.  Excess liability means when you exhaust the coverage limit on your primary policy, the excess coverage policy kicks in. If your claim on your primary (personal) insurance is denied, excess coverage doesn't kick in! You cannot file your claim with Uber's excess liability carrier, you must file with your primary first.  If you file a claim with your primary and you know that your policy has commercial exclusions (virtually all retail auto insurance policies contain commercial exclusions), you are at worst committing insurance fraud, and at best violating the ""good faith"" clause in the policy.

personalfinance,3dynqe,M00SE110,2,Tue Jul 21 15:38:07 2015 UTC,"Yes under the right circumstanced Uber's liability coverage is primary, however under no circumstances is their collision coverage primary.  So you may dodge the 100k+ liability claim, but your car still won't get fixed and your personal auto policy will still get canceled at your next renewal."
personalfinance,3dynqe,Choreboy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:41:22 2015 UTC,"Very true. That's why I specified ""Uber's liability""."
personalfinance,3dynqe,JillyPolla,2,Mon Jul 20 19:08:52 2015 UTC,Ubers app terms and conditions define the policy as excess. Check my other comments
personalfinance,3dynqe,Choreboy,6,Mon Jul 20 19:45:07 2015 UTC,"Please understand this everyone: YOU WILL NOT BE COVERED FOR ANYTHING if you use your vehicle commercially. The insurance company doesn't care when you were doing what. If they find evidence you have been doing business with your car they do not have to pay your claim, even if you were not working at the time (unless you have a commercial policy obviously). If you have any doubts or concerns about this feel free to verify with your agent, but I would be careful how you ask the questions because they will drop you if they find out you use your car for work.  EDIT because this is important: Keep in mind, this doesn't just mean you might not get your car damage paid for. It applies to liability coverage as well, so if you are ever at-fault you will be 100% responsible for the other party's damage and medical... potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars."
personalfinance,3dynqe,JillyPolla,4,Mon Jul 20 20:31:08 2015 UTC,"This is not exactly true.  Yes, the insurance company will investigate to see if you might have been using the car for an unauthorized use such as uber/lyft, delivering pizza, etc.  But if they cannot find evidence that you were using the car for one of those things at the time of loss they have to pay the claim.  Of course just having signage on the car might be enough to deny the claim so take the Pizza Hut sign off at the end of your shift.  They will likely cancel or nonrenew your policy afterwards though, regardless of whether they pay the claim or not.  I do agree that you should be careful how the speak with your agent.  We aren't trying to trick or trap you but if you tell us something we have to adjust your policy accordingly.  If you tell us you have a 16 year old with a license in your household we have to add them, if you tell us you drive for uber we have to tell underwriting(so they can non renew you), if you tell us you moved from the middle of nowhere to New York City we have to charge you way more money for car insurance.  Make sure that any hypothetical quotes are established as I am not currently doing this but wanted to know what would happen if I did.  Source:  I am an insurance agent and deal with this on a regular basis."
personalfinance,3dynqe,Choreboy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:45:22 2015 UTC,"If you tell us you have a 16 year old with a license in your household we have to add them   I'm pretty sure this isn't true. I grew up in a large household and all of my siblings had the option of driving the family car only if we paid to be added to the policy; you can't just add someone to the policy and force them to pay more if they aren't going to be driving the vehicle(s) covered in that policy. I remember one of my sisters got her own policy, as did my brother, because he didn't want anyone to be able to drive his El Camino."
personalfinance,3dynqe,deathbybadgers,2,Mon Jul 20 20:52:01 2015 UTC,"In most states that is exactly what happens.  Legally the insurance company has to pay any claim that qualifies as ""permissive use"".  Permissive use is when someone has your permission use the car or when anyone that lives in the household uses the car.  Most insurance contracts spell out somewhere in the fine print that you must notify them of any licensed drivers in the household.  Some states notify the insurance companies when a driver in the household gets a license, but in other states the insurance company relies on the policy holder to let them know about new drivers in the household.  There are a few states that offer named driver exclusions(NDEs).  An NDE is a form that the policy holder signs stating that a certain person will not be covered if they have an accident.  Odds are either your parents signed a named driver exclusion form for each of you that wasn't driving the family car, or more likely they just never told the insurance company about you getting your licenses.  Technically not telling them about a licensed driver in the household is grounds to cancel or non renew a policy, but generally when insurance companies find out about additional drivers in the household they just add them to the policy.  If you didn't live in a state where he DMV reports to the insurance company, the only way they would find out about you is if you had an accident or if you parents told them.  Source: I am a licensed insurance agent and deal with people who had children force added to their policies several times a week.  Edit:  Just to clarify, most insurance companies will not rate for a driver that has insurance on another policy.  So your brother would not generally be forced onto your parent's policy since presumably he had insurance on his El Camino."
personalfinance,3dynqe,Choreboy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:00:29 2015 UTC,Fair enough.
personalfinance,3dynqe,deathbybadgers,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:36:59 2015 UTC,"So, just to clarify, is this exclusion solely talking about not covering vehicles while/during ride-share work? (A window that Uber/Lyft are already providing coverage for.)  Or, more problematically, is it excluding any vehicle used for ridesharing in any capacity - even if an accident were to occur during personal use?"
personalfinance,3dynqe,Choreboy,3,Tue Jul 21 03:33:43 2015 UTC,"As an agent, my best guess would be the former. You don't automatically invalidate your policy by ride sharing once, but you wouldn't have coverage whilst sharing."
personalfinance,3dynqe,deathbybadgers,2,Tue Jul 21 03:35:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is true. If you're driving for profit, your insurance will cancel your policy when they find out. Even if you're not driving commercially at the moment of accident, they'll pay out the claim, but will cancel and not renew your insurance next time. Once you've had your insurance cancelled, it's very hard to find another one."
personalfinance,3dynqe,boxsterguy,2,Mon Jul 20 21:41:01 2015 UTC,"Your statement and mine are not mutually exclusive.   You wouldn't automatically invalidate your coverage by driving once or twice or whatever. You would not be covered for an accident if they find out you were driving commercially at the time. If you were going to the grocery store, you would have coverage. If they find out you're driving commercially at any time then yes they would probably cancel you, but if there's a claim and you weren't driving commercially, they'll pay it and then cancel, so you're still covered for that."

personalfinance,3dynqe,boxsterguy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:12:55 2015 UTC,Most of the time someone on the policy tells us they are planning to join uber and need proof of insurance.  In this case we non renew the policy unless we get documentation from uber thst they are no longer working for uber.  If a third party tells us about the uber driver we would send the policy holder a request for information on how the car is being used.  If they do not respond then we non renew for failure to provide underwriting information.  If they do respond we ask for something in writing stating that they are not using the car for ride sharing.  If they do not provide it we non renew the policy for failure to provide underwriting information.  If they provide writen documentation that they are not ride sharing we renew the policy and clearly let them know ride sharing is not covered and document that they are aware of that fact.

personalfinance,3dynqe,mikeincolumbus,3,Mon Jul 20 18:55:54 2015 UTC,"Technically you are covered on your personal auto policy while doing your non uber driving, but if you get in an accident while carrying an uber passenger or going to pick one up you are not covered.

personalfinance,3dynqe,chris41658,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:37:10 2015 UTC,"I heard that, at least for awhile, a lot of the cars at those 1 day/week driving schools were rentals.  Rental companies now use gps and engine monitors to tell where and how fast you've driven the car. If your rental agreement restricted you to one state and you go to another, they've got you. Likewise, they'll see if you've driven well over the speed limit. The fine print will allow them to charge you a lot more in those cases."

The gap is when you are driving with the app open and don't have a passenger in the vehicle.

No extra people in the car means to extra cost, so they can cover me. If they'd have asked me, I might have seriously considered telling them because at that point it could be considered fraud, but since nobody asked, I decided not to tell. My insurance covered me and I got a new car. Ironically, I was hit by a cab driver who wasn't insured. He was arrested, and I took a Lyft home."
personalfinance,3dynqe,deathbybadgers,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:07:06 2015 UTC,In your situation Uber's policy would have covered the loss since you were in period 2 (selected to provide a ride and enroute to pick up) when it happened.  If the accident had happened in period 1 (driving around with app on but not selected for a ride yet) Uber would not cover you and if your personal insurance would have discovered this they would deny the claim also.

personalfinance,3dynqe,aga080,2,Mon Jul 20 18:17:06 2015 UTC,"The model supposes that taxi regulations are shit.  Well, obsolete, that a private self-regulatory system would work better.   The govt system skims a LOT of money in regulatory fees.  And the large non-opportunity costs- like a large annual licensing fee, that doesn't go by how many fares are run- pushes the market into a few people overworking and delivering a poor product.    5 people casually taking fares in their spare time, they cannot afford to buy a special care and go through ""taxi driver training"", and an annual license fee.  The regulatory model proposes this is GOOD, on the belief that casual providers are unprofessional and deliver poor, even dangerous product.  The belief that casual drivers who may cause accidents, be rude to their fares, cheat them, even assault their fares themselves would not do so if they'd planned for this by buying a formal taxicab and taking and expensive class and getting an expensive license.  But this is unproven.  In fact Uber has shown to deliver a superior product at a lower cost."
personalfinance,3dynqe,JonnyHall,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:33:22 2015 UTC,"One of my problems with Uber is that they DO require drivers to have a special car - iirc there's a list of approved models and a 2010 model year cutoff.   I'd tell them, if you don't want to play by taxi rules, fine. As a rideshare/carpool organizer, you are required to;   Count drivers as full employees (part-time if they cruise - not carry fares, cruise - fewer than 40 hours a week), OR charge a one-time fee no more than one dollar for your app and take NO further payment from the driver or customer. Allow drivers of ANY vehicle which meets the basic roadworthiness standard required of private cars WITHOUT REGARD TO vehicle age or configuration. Two-doors. Two-seaters. 1992 Geo Metros.

personalfinance,3dynqe,metaridley18,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:43:30 2015 UTC,"They aren't skirting taxi regulations. Uber's vehicles would fall under livery laws not taxi laws. The framework to regulate uber drivers exists in most states but no lawmakers have taken the initiative to try to enforce the regulations on them, or some have that I don't know about.  Uber's model is pretty much identical to every limo or black car service around. EG: dude buys lincoln town car(or any other passenger car), Get's it registered as a livery vehicle at the DMV, gets a commercial insurance policy, gives his number to a local black car service(or even several different dispatch services), people will call the service(some services even have phone apps like uber) who dispatch the driver to the people and drives em around, people pay the driver who gives a cut to the dispatch service. Uber takes this model and modifies it by not requiring their drivers to register their vehicles or purchase insurance. If this was legal then every limo service would have adopted it overnight to save tens of thousand on taxes every year.  People driving co workers to work or friends out camping don't charge per minute or mile, they'll ask for a gas tax and snacks at most."
personalfinance,3dynqe,Lolaindisguise,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:53:45 2015 UTC,"Insurance agent here, this isn't new at all, it just wording differently because lets face it, your auto contract can be confusing.  It never covered for hire services, the wording change is just so people can understand what is and isn't covered.    Real estate agents that drive clients around are covered under a personal policy but rated for business.  contractors using their vehicle visiting multiple job sites would be considered business use but still under a personal contract. (higher pricing).  However at this time most insurance companies would call driving a taxi (essentially what uber, yft, etc are as commercial.)"

personalfinance,3dynqe,blowjobjesus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:47:02 2015 UTC,Yes.  If you are using you personal car at work it is probably considered business use by your insurance company.

personalfinance,3e2h18,maaku7,4,Tue Jul 21 15:35:45 2015 UTC,Why are you in S&P 500 and not VTI?  Personally I would look at adding international coverage (e.g. VXUS) before sector funds like a REIT.

But it's only the largest of the large caps so its not actually that diverse in some ways. It has no small or mid cap coverage, which is where most of the growth is, so it underperformes what a total market index can do by a few percent.  You probably want a blend of VTI, VXUS, BND, and BNDX. That's what your typical lifestyle or target date fund is."
personalfinance,3e2h18,marcphive,2,Tue Jul 21 15:24:25 2015 UTC,"Actually the advice I typically give to new investors is to buy the Vanguard lifestrategy Growth Fund. That's it -- just a one fund portfolio. It is a mix of total market stock and bond, 70% domestic 30% international, 80% stock 20% bond. This is pretty close to the sweet spot for financially independent folks, and buying one fund all the rebalancing is taken care of for you. Furthermore the minimum investment is low at $3000, and there is only one share class in that class gets you effectively Admiral shares in the underlying funds. So it is convenient and the expense ratio is about as good as it gets.  I'm micromanage my portfolio but that's just because personal finance and investing is a hobby of mine. The Vanguard lifestrategy Growth Fund is by no means training wheels, it really is best of breed and the end of story as far as most investors should be concerned."

The classic three fund portfolio is very diversified exposing you to thousands of stocks across all the global equities markets and to US government and corporate bonds.  If your stock exposure is only the S&P500, you're right that isn't as diverse as it could be. Use a total US stock market index fund (such as vanguard's) and a total international index fund that includes emerging markets."
personalfinance,3e2h18,xkeep12,3,Tue Jul 21 16:34:56 2015 UTC,"a large downswing in the stock market could really hurt us.    Only if you panic and sell while the market is down.  You're young and have time to ride out market downturns.  You ought to have some international equity exposure, although tbh, many US large cap companies are multinational and offer that diversity.  I'd also change from the S&P 500 index in your Vanguard account to a total market index, which includes more diversity in the form of mid- and small-cap businesses.  If you want, you can make it a total world, or buy US total market and international indices separately.  REITs are not a bad idea, but you don't absolutely need them.  There is not a lot of pattern in their correlation with the stock market (http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickferri/2014/01/07/reits-and-your-portfolio/), so you may still experience highs and lows in your portfolio."
personalfinance,3e2h18,UMich22,4,Tue Jul 21 16:40:25 2015 UTC,"i'm worried that we are not nearly as well diversified as we need to be.   You're well diversified.  You realize close to 90% of the diversification benefits with as few a ~30 positions and everything above 100 or so doesn't even matter.  The only thing to consider would be to spread out over a few other assets classes such as bonds or emerging market equity.   maybe a real estate index fund (REIT ETF) would accomplish what we are looking to do?   S&P 500 includes plenty of real estate exposure including a number of REITs.   I was also thinking when interest rates went up we would invest more in bonds as well.    This would be the opposite of the right thing to do.  When interest rates go up it drives bond prices up, which drives bond yields down.  Don't time the market."

personalfinance,3e1h6z,AnxieShe,26,Tue Jul 21 05:55:00 2015 UTC,"You mentioned that you made $260 over ten hours at a craft show which is higher than your current wage however you left out some details like the length of time it takes to produce your items. If it took you ten hours to make all the product you sold in ten hours at the craft show then your hourly wage was $13 not $26. Also how frequent are these craft shows? It doesn't matter if you did make a higher wage per hour at the craft fair if you can only sell at the craft fair for ten hours a week instead of working for 40. Your post really scares me because I think you are about to make some really bad decisions without thoroughly examining all the issues. Your job sounds really sweet actually ( pays well + good benefits + work at home) and a lot of people with your experience would kill for something similar. You mention it is stressing you out, but I guarantee you it is a lot less stressful than struggling to make ends meet being an entrepreneur. It is awesome hearing you talk about saving money. It is clear that this makes you feel good. How will you feel when this savings account starts to go down every month instead of up?   I hope I haven't discourage you yet because I think what you are doing with your crafting is really really cool. I actually just set up a shop on etsy and I am checking my email hourly to see if I have made a sale yet so I am super jealous that you actually have demand for your product and people want to buy it. The fact that people are buying your goods mean you could grow this hobby into a full time gig, if you do it right. You just need to take it slow and easy. If I were in your shoes, I wouldn't quit my day job until my side income was at least equal to my man income.   I think you should be examining ways to increase the income from your hobby. I am not sure what you are making, by maybe you can transition to good that bring a higher price or take less time to make."

personalfinance,3e1h6z,Wolfie305,6,Tue Jul 21 16:34:18 2015 UTC,"My angle is from app/game development, but a lot of the basic principles apply.  I've thought about this too, and decided it wasn't really feasible.  For reference, I'm 30, live in the US, own a house, live on a single income, and work in the tech industry.   Benefits: Depending on the benefits your employer supplies, it may be very expensive to pay for similar benefits out of pocket. Unpredictable income: Depending on what types of crafts and whether or not they come/go out of fashion, the income might be unpredictable.  It will likely spike around holidays (as people buy gifts), and you'll have to play a budget around an unpredictable income. Taxes: A lot of people forget that for things like this, especially if it's a primary source of income, you do have to pay tax on it.  It's great if you can turn $100 of supplies into $200, but did you consider having to pay income tax on that?  It's easy to forget that the money you see from your current job has taxes withheld. Lack of motivation: I love working from home, but I think I'd go a bit crazy if I worked from home ALL the time.  Going to an office, socializing with people, having a manager to help guide me, etc...  You really have to be a self-starter if you're going to try this. Opportunity cost: While you're doing this, you're putting your other career on old.  Are you in an industry where things move quickly, and your skills might be out-of-date when you return to the workforce?  Are you comfortable explaining a gap in employment?   I work as a software developer as my job, which I really enjoy but I did consider leaving that to work independently on game development.  Unfortunately, I came to the conclusion that for me, it just doesn't make financial sense.  I still do it as a hobby and for me, I think that's good enough."

How many hours, total (both creating the craft and the selling time) did it take to earn that $615?  Does that $615 take in to account the cost of stock? I.e. did you sell $1000 of goods, which cost you $385 in materials, to net $615? Or did you gross $615, and have yet to deduct the cost of materials?"

personalfinance,3e1h6z,catjuggler,4,Tue Jul 21 14:54:22 2015 UTC,"$615 over 15 weekends is a profit of $40/week. You cannot work conventions 40 hours a week 50 weeks a year. Even if you were able to double your profit and make $80/week, that gives you an annual income of $4000. Maybe I misread your post and you made $615 every weekend for 15 weekends. That is annual income $16000 if you could do it every week. Still pretty close to poverty level.  Please don't be ""impulsive"" about this. Do what most creative people do: enjoy this as a side income, but it won't pay the bills. Explore what happens if you try to increase the time you devote to it. You can learn more gradually whether you could support yourself doing it full time. The etsy suggestion is one avenue.  Also consider this: a craft or pastime you enjoy when you do it to bring in a little extra money can turn into drudgery and stress when it becomes your only source of income."

I continue to sell throughout the year, but could never rely on it as my sole source of income.  Have you tried opening an Etsy or an online store? If you really want to see if there is a demand for your product, opening up yourself for potential customers from all over the world is the best way. Craft shows are great, but they're not all the time and not a good way to gauge your product's success.   Keep in mind that selling full-time also means you have more to worry about when it comes to taxes, you'll have to pay for independent health insurance, and you probably won't take any vacations. Not to mention all the selling fees, shipping materials, and costs to make your product as well.  You also mention your job is stressing you out, but keep in mind there is nothing more stressful than dealing with horrendous, shitty customers that you and your business are now solely responsible for. Customers who think you're a mass producing business with employees and expect things done in an unreasonable amount of time (despite the production time being clearly listed to them before purchase) because it's Christmas and they need everything by Christmas even though they placed an order after shipping cut offs. Customers who rage when USPS loses their package, or the CUSTOMER gives me the wrong address and then gets mad when I ask them to repay for the item because I cannot afford to just take the hit and send them a new one for free after they made a mistake. Customers who DO NOT READ your god damn product descriptions and then leave you a bad review because they didn't realize the shape of the item was flat instead of a ball and this is somehow your fault. Customers suck and no matter how diligent you are or nice you will make mistakes or take a loss to make someone happy. Holidays for my Etsy are the most stressful months of my life."

I thought it would be awesome, thinking it would support me and I would never have to ""go to"" work again. However, when you're relying on sales to pay your bills and you don't get any for a week, it's ridiculous stressful.

There are plenty of products that will sell out when 10 per week are available, but would only sell 50 units a week if 100 were available. It may be a mistake to extrapolate current demand over a much larger supply. Hence it may make sense to test the market in some way before you make the leap."

Multiply that number by the amount you sell them for, and that's your theoretical ""maximum"" income, if you spent 0 time doing sales/accounting/marketing. e.g. if you can make 5 a day if you work all day, and they sell for $20 a piece, then your highest possible income would be $100/day.   Plug in these numbers for yourself and ask yourself if that would be sustainable for you to live off of.  Also realize that you will not hit those numbers realistically, because your items might not sell as fast as you can make them, and you will have to dedicate time to doing non-crafty business stuff like accounting, customer support, etc."

personalfinance,3e3ipz,ekoostikmartin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:59:00 2015 UTC,"I think that sounds like a pretty reasonable approach in regard to your age and risk allocation.  With the individual, high risk, stocks you choose to purchase, choose companies you really like what they do.  It makes it really fun to hold investments in companies you enjoy.  If you lose all $10k (which is likely if you really gamble) you have the rest of your life to make it up.  A lot of investment strategists would say you're at the right age to invest 10% in high risk investments.    You definitely have the right idea with your investment strategies. However, I think $50k is too much to be holding in cash.  At the very least, put it in a money market account, short term CD, or some other low risk and easily liquidated investment.  Cash just sitting in a checking account is losing money based on the time value of money concept.  However, at least it's insured by the FDIC up to $250,000.   If I had that cash, I would invest in real estate (depending on which market in which you reside).  With the rapidly growing population, real estate in/near desirable cities is becoming so valuable.  There is a limited amount of space near cities and the demand just keeps growing.  I'd avoid condos though... During periods of market downturns, when everyone is selling, condos seem to sell for less because there are so many identical units that you and your neighbors will all be selling essentially the same thing.  Makes it hard to differentiate your property and the more desperate neighbors can drive the price down."

Excel is simple and straight forward, but these other tools will give you access to all sorts of reporting and alerts that you'd need to be an Excel Ninja to create.    There are also some pretty decent apps available for tracking your budget.  My wife and I personally use an iOS app called GoodBudget.  I really like it because it syncs your budget between multiple devices and is one of the few that I found with that feature that was free.   With GoodBudget, you can create envelopes like groceries, gas, and utilities and deduct expenses from those envelopes.  It lets you set monthly limits so you, and anyone you're syncing with, can instantly monitor and track spending throughout the month.  I also lets you enter your income to fill the envelopes.  If you have anything left over at the end of the month, you can sweep that money into a savings envelope if you wish.  There is a paid version, but I'm not sure what additional features or benefits you gain...perhaps more envelopes or something."

He really pushes cash based spending for everything because of the mental impact.  When you have to count out crisp $100 bills when making a purchase rather than swiping a card, it makes you stop and think about it first.  He teaches that you should have a physical envelope with cash for every designated expense category.  It's a great method if you're looking for ways to curb spending and aren't good with self-control.  I'm not suggesting you go to a cash based envelope system, but you could if you wanted to.  For instance, you set up an envelope in the app for gas and set it to $200 per month and another for food for $500 per month, rent for $1000, utilities for $400, etc.  When you get paid, you add money to your account in the app to fill up your envelopes.  They each have a progress bar that shows how much you have used and have left.  When you buy $50 worth of gas, you deduct it from your virtual envelope in the app.  When you pay rent, buy food, etc you deduct it from the app.  Your actual money can either be in cash in physical envelopes or sitting in your checking account.  Either way, the app, and others like it, just helps you track and manage your spending.  Getting so granular with your finances may seem like unnecessary overkill, but it makes budgeting a non-issue at that point.  If you have a strict budget, and stick to you, you never have to worry about what you're going to pay when and never forget to pay a bill."

This will provide you with a social life, flexibility, a sense of achievement and self-worth.   That being said, living at home to save some cash isn't a terrible idea either.

The industry you're in (financial services) looks particularly unfavorably on resume gaps and to compound it you're quitting a new job you just started a year ago.  It will be difficult to get recommendations and any prospective employer will ask questions because it raises all sorts of red flags.  It may permanently knock you off of your career path.

After we talk to someone that knows a lot about the loan forgiveness and is able to steer her in the right direction on the best repayment method, would it be advisable to talk to a financial planner?

personalfinance,3e1mq2,xtrexjpsouz,3,Tue Jul 21 15:05:45 2015 UTC,"/r/studentloans is definitely a better subreddit for this type of question.  To clarify: What exactly do you mean when you say your girlfriend works for a ""public service?"" Note that PSLF eligibility has very little to do with the type of work you do, and everything to do with where you work. Specifically, your employer has to be a government or non-profit organization. AFAIK most pharmacies are for-profit so they don't qualify. Hospitals usually qualify though.  Assuming she does have a qualifying job, the first thing your girlfriend needs to do is make sure all of her loans actually qualify for PSLF. Depending on the types of federal loans she has, she may need to consolidate. If that is the case, she should do that immediately so she doesn't miss out on any qualifying payments. (Consolidating creates an entirely new loan, so any payments made before the consolidation would not count.) Also, if she consolidates, make sure she selects FedLoan for the servicer as this is the ""official"" loan servicer for PSLF.  Next, she needs to make sure she is on a qualifying repayment plan - either Income Based Repayment or Pay As You Earn. These plans will tie the monthly payments to her income, so the more money she earns, the more she will have to pay and the less she will eventually have forgiven. Note that these types of plans need to be renewed annually with updated income information. Make sure she does this on-time every year or she could end up messing things up (significantly higher monthly payments, administrative forbearance delaying her progress towards PSLF, etc.).  The next step is to track her progress towards PSLF by periodically submitting an Employer Certification Form. You don't have to do these on an annual basis, but it's generally a good idea since it may be difficult to verify 10 years of employment all at once when she's ready for forgiveness. Once she submits the first ECF, her loans will be automatically transferred to FedLoan if they are not there already.  Beyond that... just make sure she is making all of her payments on-time. Signing up for auto-debit through her loan servicer may be helpful, particularly if she is the forgetful type."
personalfinance,3e1mq2,lupusmagnus11,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:23:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks! This helps out tremendously. I did post the same question over at /r/studentloans as well.  She is working for the VA. She stated that it would qualify for the PSLF (I'm still learning all about this myself as I don't have any debt or know much about this) but based on what I have researched it would qualify.   I'm not 100% sure exactly which loans she has or which ones do and don't qualify etc (working on finding it all out atm). At this point the information I know is that they are currently all unconsolidated as she was told that if she consolidated a loan that didn't qualify it would make all of the loans not qualify. No payments have been made towards the 120 months. She just started this job a few weeks ago and is wading through all of the information and I'm pushing her (maybe too much) to get started on paying this bullshit off.   Few questions I have.    I found this calculator but it shows 300 months for IBR. Is this for the non PSLF only? Is there a calculator for PSLF?  Since she is working for the VA, they have the THRIFT saving plan. I believe this is the case but just want to make sure. If she puts in the maximum amount into that ($18k) this should reduce her Adjusted Gross Income and her monthly payments under IBR would be lower correct? If this is the case...that is huge...because its reducing the amount of money she would have to pay monthly for her IBR payment on top of allowing her to save the additional amount of money. With me paying all of the living expenses this shouldn't be that hard for her to do (other than taking a little bit longer for her to save up for what she wants in a wedding).  If we got married and with my understanding of IBR, they would take into account my salary as well. Is this true? With my income which is pretty close to 6 figures itself. Is there anyway around this? If we are married but file separate tax returns would this work to get around it?"

This is not correct. The only way she would disqualify herself is if she refinanced through a private lender. As long as she keeps the loans within the federal program, she'll be fine.   I found this calculator but it shows 300 months for IBR. Is this for the non PSLF only? Is there a calculator for PSLF?   Yes, that is for regular IBR without PSLF. As far as I know, there is no calculator specifically for PSLF.   If she puts in the maximum amount into that ($18k) this should reduce her Adjusted Gross Income and her monthly payments under IBR would be lower correct?   I'm not really familiar with all the details of a THRIFT plan but generally speaking, if she contributes to pre-tax retirement accounts like a traditional 401k or traditional IRA, those contributions will reduce her AGI and lower her monthly student loan payments.   If we got married and with my understanding of IBR, they would take into account my salary as well. Is this true?   Yes, that is true. Married couples who file their taxes jointly have to include both incomes in the IBR calculations.   Is there anyway around this? If we are married but file separate tax returns would this work to get around it?   Yes. Filing separately would exclude your income from the IBR calculations. You will most likely end up paying higher income taxes filing separately, but if you expect to have a lot forgiven under PSLF it's probably worth it.  You could also just not get married until after she gets her forgiveness. Granted, this isn't the right choice for everyone, but you'll want to think carefully about why you're getting married (aside from ""we love each other and want to be together forever"" which you can obviously do without a marriage license)."

Based on your shopping budget you're looking at $7K-$8K for the down payment and at least that much for closing costs (insurance & escrow prepayment, lender fees, etc.). The lender won't like seeing you empty your entire savings account to close the loan and it'll also mean a huge risk for your in the event of an unforeseen emergency or job loss.  Also if you do go FHA now you'll be paying PMI for the life of the loan - there's no more getting rid of it at 78% LTV."

You don't want to blow it all without a safety net.  FHA is also a bigger pain in the *** with all the paperwork and and the lender scrutinizing every part of your life for the last 10 years.

personalfinance,3e2x9h,throwaway_234231,3,Tue Jul 21 15:30:11 2015 UTC,"Interest on student loans is compounded daily.  For example, the loan at $15,148.36 currently accumulates interest at $3.02/day.  If there are 30 days between payments, your interest will be $90.60 for that period.  If you pay it 25 days after your last payment the interest will be $75.50.  Use this calculator to see how it is affected:  http://www.aie.org/manage-your-money/reduce-debt/calculate-daily-interest-on-your-loan.cfm  In other words, the more frequently you make payments, the more $ will be applied to principle and less to interest as every payment reduces the principle more quickly, so the interest calculation changes every time you make a payment.  Look at the daily rate factor on the web link provided.  That is the number for that particular loan based on the interest rate that gives you the amount of interest per day that you are paying.  You would really have to figure out each loan individually because they are different interest rates and different balances.    Long story short, if you pay the same amount you are paying, but divide it into 2 payments a month instead of 1, you will save interest over the life of the loan because the principle will reduce with every payment, and the amount of interest accumulated is less."

personalfinance,3e2x9h,constantino1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:30:11 2015 UTC,"its hard to identify with the formatting.  but the general idea is that you have a principle balance every month.  They tack on interest to that balance then subtract your payment.  The payment will offset the interest, and the excess will go to the principle.  Next month you have a slightly smaller principle (reduced by the amount in excess of interest that you paid last month), which will accrue a slightly smaller interest amount, and your payment will do the same, with slightly more going to principle.  The interest rate could fluctuate if its variable, but that shouldnt happen too frequently."
personalfinance,3e2x9h,constantino1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:36:10 2015 UTC,Right thats how I thought it worked.

It may have to do with when you make the payment, if they are accruing interest daily, then making the payment later in the payment period (not late, just closer to the deadline) would mean they continue to accrue on the higher prepayment balance longer.... still... that should be pennies here.  Id call them up and see whats up.  maybe the interest rate is fluctuating month to month."
personalfinance,3e2x9h,Pinewood74,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:56:36 2015 UTC,"I think the variable interest is due to paying on different days and it being after the due date.

I just downloaded my wife's payment history from Great Lakes and I'm noticing ALL SORTS of screwyness.  They don't seem to be following along with what an amortization schedule would indicate they should do and seem to be playing games with what actually goes towards the principal.  We are on a 30 year fixed interest loan which means that the payment towards principal should be fairly consistent and get a little larger each month.  There are months where what goes towards the principal will mysteriously drop by 15% or more.   It would be interesting to find out if you're with the same company and what, if any, explanation they provide.   My gut feeling is that they're just hoping that we won't notice and are withholding principal payments to pad out the interest."
personalfinance,3e2x9h,Betsy514,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:39:05 2015 UTC,Are you paying with the same number of days in between payments?  More interest accumulates the longer between payments and less interest accumulates the closer the payments are together.  All accumulated interest is paid first and then the rest applied to principle.  So if it is 20 days between payments a larger portion goes to principle than if it is 30 days between payments because you have 10 more days of interest to pay before anything is applied to the principle.  Interest is accumulated daily and paid before any amount goes to principle.

If the price goes down you probably won't be able to claim a capital gains loss because if you are still participating in the ESPP because of wash sale rules.

For example, if you have a certain IBR plan, a sufficient increase in income may result in the IBR plan ""becoming"" the standard 10 year payment plan.  If you can't afford those payments, you could opt instead for the extended payment plan, or possibly even a graduated extended payment plan.  Graduated payments will drastically reduce the amount you pay now in exchange for higher payments later (and thus more interest to be paid).  The idea behind this is that you won't be making enough money at the beginning of your career to make ends meet, but you will have an excess later in your career and you will be able to afford the higher payments then.  Mind you that the best thing to do is to do as aBoglehead suggested, and either: a) increase your income or b) decrease your spending.  Another alternative would be to look for a different job in an area that is less expensive to live in."
personalfinance,3e2g37,taedrin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:02:05 2015 UTC,"If OP switches to an extended or graduated repayment plan, they will no longer qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. I'm guessing this is not something they want to do."
personalfinance,3e2g37,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:18:29 2015 UTC,"PSLF requires OP to make 120 qualifying payments (on time and in full).  If OP cannot afford to meet these requirements, then OP won't qualify for PSLF anyways.  From my understanding, defaulting on the loans will disqualify OP permanently.  Also, if OPs income increased to a point that they are making standard repayments anyways, then they will be pretty much paid off after 10 years and there won't be any debt to forgive in the first place.  I suppose the other option OP has is to try to apply for forbearance by claiming financial hardship due to the car breaking down, but this would be discretionary forbearance so the lender could deny it.  Note that payments made under forbearance are NOT qualifying payments for PSLF."
personalfinance,3e2g37,taedrin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:34:09 2015 UTC,"You're right - defaulting is definitely worse than switching to a non-eligible repayment plan. Assuming OP submitted their new income information on-time and there were no errors on the loan servicer's end, they should be able to make the income-based payments work though. Hard to say for sure without seeing a breakdown of OP's income and expenses."
personalfinance,3e2g37,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:37:07 2015 UTC,"Hey guys!  Thanks for the help with this.  Income : ~3000/month, after the matched 6% to retirement  Current Savings : ~5600  Expenses: Rent (910), Phone (80), Back Taxes (140), Car Insurance (80), Car Loan (210), Electricity (150), Student loans (500), Gym (30), Credit Cards (100), Amazon Prime (8.95)  Total Expenses - 2208.95  After looking at the numbers, maybe I'm not in AS dire straits as I thought. But I definitely won't be able to put back any money for savings anymore. I mean that leaves me with about 800 a month on food and other expenses I'm not thinking of.  Total Student loan dept =62k.  At 500/month for ten years thats barely lower than what I would be paying outside of income based repayment."
personalfinance,3e2g37,xtrexjpsouz,2,Tue Jul 21 15:38:04 2015 UTC,"Even with all of your other debts (credit card, car loan, back taxes) it sounds like you can afford the $500/month student loan payments. You shouldn't need $800/month for food and other miscellaneous expenses.  If you're looking for places to cut back, I would suggest starting with the cell phone plan. $80/month is a lot of money for one phone. Look into prepaid plans; even with unlimited data, you could probably cut that in half.  Also, how close are you to completely paying off the credit cards and back taxes? Getting rid of one or both of these would make your life a whole lot easier."
personalfinance,3e2g37,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:41:51 2015 UTC,"I actually use my phone as a hotspot as well. Grandfathered in an unlimited data plan. So while it is expensive for a single phone, it actually saves me money because I don't have to pay for internet.  1200 (credit cards), 2900 (IRS), 848 (state taxes)  Actually this has already helped me, because I thought I owed like 2k on my state taxes, but after getting off the phone with them I owe significantly less."
personalfinance,3e2g37,taedrin,3,Tue Jul 21 15:50:43 2015 UTC,"Pay off the credit cards ASAP. If you make them a priority, you can easily pay them off in less than a year. This will give you an extra $100/month of wiggle room in your budget."
personalfinance,3e2g37,xtrexjpsouz,2,Tue Jul 21 15:52:58 2015 UTC,"And once the back taxes are paid for, that will be an extra $240/month of wiggle room.  If we assume $300/month for OP's food budget, then that leaves them with $500/month as extra income.  OP can pay off the credit card in 2.5 months, then finish paying off taxes before the end of the year.  OP will then have $740 of extra income to do with as they please.  OP, this is why putting together a budget is so important.  Before you listed out your income and expenses, you were freaking out, and now that you did you realize that you aren't in nearly a bad situation that you thought you were in.  I think you will be just fine - just make sure you keep track of how much money you are actually spending to keep your extraneous expenses to a minimum."
personalfinance,3e2g37,Dota-Sn00py,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:20:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks taedrin. I think I was just freaking out because I usually put quite a bit away in savings automatically. And now that I'm not going to be able to do that as much, it gave me quite the shock.  And I will have to cut back on extra expenditures. I usually make sure I have at least 400 bucks every two weeks in my checking account for food / entertainment / etc. I dont really eat out often, but there is room for cutting somewhere in there somewhere."
personalfinance,3e2g37,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:32:19 2015 UTC,"You wouldn't suggest using my savings and paying off everything? That would leave me with about 700 in savings, but an extra 240 per month."
personalfinance,3e2g37,xtrexjpsouz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:10:52 2015 UTC,That is an option... but I personally wouldn't because leaving yourself with only $700 in savings is very risky. I would pay off the credit cards now and then chip away at the taxes over the next several months.

personalfinance,3e2v4d,The_Sneer,0,Tue Jul 21 16:41:38 2015 UTC,"There are a number of possibilities with your situation to make it more affordable (hopefully) than the school's option.     Considering you could still be on your mother's plan (if she had one), you could get a family (parent & children) plan through the exchange that would cover your mother, sister and yourself.    Depending on your family's income situation, it may be more prudent to get coverage on your own.  If your income is low enough, you will qualify for move premium credits than your entire family would.     There may be some caveats to #2 as I'm not entirely sure that the exchange would allow someone with low to no income who is technically still a dependent to get their own coverage. You may want to look into that further before you proceed.     The biggest thing to take into consideration when choosing insurance is that the local doctors in FL and in PA take the insurance.   That will take some research as well."

Depending on the insurance requirements of the university, some healthcare plans offered through obamacare won't be accepted (high deductible, etc.).  So you'd have to get a better plan, which could be more costly depending on your family's income, etc.  Lots of bases to cover."

Your description of your search sounds like you might be looking below market."
personalfinance,3e3rix,loopy212,2,Tue Jul 21 19:02:05 2015 UTC,"i'd have to second this - buying a house before you are married is a bad idea. but if you still want to continue - what state are you in?   Buying houses are tricky based on state -but if you are in NY here are my ground rules: 1) Location, Location, Location. Don't buy any house that's not near the subway and/or bus line.  This is the only way your house will appreciate in price by 3x since the city is expanding from Manhattan. 2) Settle. Don't walk away from the house/table just because the owner didn't do wood floors or fix the leaky pipe. You're spending $$$ to buy a house - you can afford $ in fixing the small problems. 3) don't wait for seasons - housing market is unpredictable. One summer in Queens, you could find a nice 2 family house in the rural area(or what is left of the rural area) for $500,000. The following winter, every house jumped in price and it became a seller's market. Now you will never find a house that is $500,000 - NEVER.   Of course now the rules are different, these rules worked before the seller's market started. You have to see how much houses appreciated in price in the area you are looking - see if it will grow more - and then make an informed decision. If seller's think their houses will appreciate more in price, they won't bother to fix anything- why would they? They will have loads of buyers who will take it as is. Although, it's true, I never look at a house without garage/driveway unless it's something phenomenal inside."

I forgot to mention that in my post, but that's one of our MUSTs, too.  Even when we were looking at those 3/2s though, the prices were going into the 80-90k range, and I'm just not comfortable paying that. Even though WE won't be paying it, if we decide to move or refi, that's 80-90k we have to give back out of our own pocket. So we really have to LOVE this place.

Got most of my money back, but the ordeal was mind blowing.  Best bet is to see if ford ever recalls it. If the dealer is flashing your TCM for free, keep going back, and say it is still happening. Have them keep logging it. They have tests to test the clutches.  Even with a new one, traffics sucks, mine jolts forward as well. Drove my friends 2014 titanium and it does the same as mine.

personalfinance,3e2o6m,splat313,2,Tue Jul 21 14:37:10 2015 UTC,"I believe it unnecessarily complicates the ownership of the home.  If you or your sister dies, your ownership would pass to your heirs which may not be what your parents would want.  When you are added to the deed your cost-basis will be half of what your parents paid for the house.  This means that if your parents end up selling the house you have have a large capital gains tax bill headed your way.  I listen to a financial planning radio show geared towards seniors and they've always recommended against adding children to the deed.  http://willblog.bsgfdlaw.com/6-reasons-not-to-put-your-child%E2%80%99s-name-on-the-deed-to-your-house/"
personalfinance,3e2o6m,ZoraQ,4,Tue Jul 21 14:45:21 2015 UTC,"A couple of points.  Don't confuse the mortgage with the ownership of the property.  The mortgage is the financial obligation to lien holder (the bank).  The names on the mortgage are who will be financially obligated to pay back the loan.  It doesn't sound like that you will be involved in that in any way.  The bank will be the lien holder until the mortgage is paid off.  The ownership is declared by the deed to the property.  This can be declared as Joint Tenancy (two or more persons in which each owns an undivided interest in the whole) or Tenants in common (concurrent, or simultaneous, ownership of real property by two or more parties) and can be defined with the title company when the property is purchased.   Regardless of the particulars of the deed, as long as you are not part of the mortgage obligation there is no impact to your financial situation.  It can get sticky when there are a lot of names on the title when one or more want to sell and others don't.

personalfinance,3e1sv0,CaptinKirk,51,Tue Jul 21 08:21:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you need to sit down and start to think about where your priorities lie. To be honest you have been horribly irresponsible with your finances fir what seems like a long time. you have forgotten how to sacrifice, and now you are here with a mountain of debt and a Harley, and you are talking about bankruptcy.   Bankruptcy should be you last resort, and not at all appropriate in this case.  From what I gather, your situation is as follows, per month your net income is 3600, your wife makes 1000 and your rental property is positive 200. This gives you 4800 per month.  At the same time, your mortgage, debt and bills cost 3700.  This gives you 1100 per month to live off.  This is not unreasonable, but you need to sacrifice. A bankruptcy could ruin you for a long time, particularly given that the only basis explanation for your situation is that you have spent like a millionaire.  What you need to do is:  Downgrade your cars. Two vehicles worth 5k each would wipe 30 k of your debt.  The rental can stay, its cash positive and the other debt is the bigger issue.  Take a hard look at your bills and cut what isn't absolutely necessary. No Netflix for you. Downgrade your phone plan if you can. Shop at a discount supermarket. Limit Christmas present prices and shop smart.  This needs to be your new way of life for the next year at least. Every time you think you have been good and can afford a treat, stop! You can't. Access to finance is different to having money.  Now you need to start paying down the debt. Focus on the higher interest items. Don't pay only the minimum on credit cards. See if you can roll any of this debt (after selling the cars) into your mortgage and keep it all together on a lower interest rate.  in addition to removing debt, you need some emergency funding. At least a couple of months of living expenses. To do this, your spending needs to cut deeper than just enough to meet debt.   Longer term, your wife needs to up her earning. The notion of a single income breadwinner is old fashioned as does not match the lifestyle you have chosen to lead.  Also, think about whether a 5 bedroom house is really so integral. Your kids could share rooms. Kids all around the world share bedrooms. They will gain more in the long term from a financially responsible parent than from their own bedroom and a bankrupt father.   Oh, and sell your Harley, start acting like a responsible adult, and only buy what you can afford.   Do 70% of this and you'll probably be right. Do all of this and in 5-10 years time you will be financially stable, you'll have learned an important lesson about what debt is for and you will wonder how you were ever so stupid.   Good luck, and don't mess this up."

You could find an inexpensive apartment / house for rent near the property with mortgage 1 and your family could live in two houses a short distance away from each other.  You said property 1 (3 bed 1 bath) rents out for $1300 a month.  I assume that property 2 (5 bed 1 bath) would get you $2000-$2500 a month?  More information is needed to see if this idea might actually save you money (price of apartments near property 1, attainable rent from property 2).  Housing is generally the biggest portion of personal expenditures so lowering spending on housing generally makes a big difference.  Disclaimer: I have to say I have not a degree in finance."

personalfinance,3e1sv0,hlpful,5,Tue Jul 21 18:15:16 2015 UTC,"There are a number of pieces of information that are relevant to all debts, and it's probably worth it for you to put together a spreadsheet to track them.  1) Principal and accrued interest outstanding, 2) Value of underlying asset (if applicable, e.g. house or car), 3) interest rate today, 4) variable or fixed rate, incl. detail on how the variable floats, 5) minimum monthly payment.   You have $566k of debt based on what you listed above, with minimum payment of $4,520 excluding credit cards, and you earn ($75k + $15k + $1.3k*12) = $105.6k.  Let's make that $90k, and remove the other mortgage from the consideration (assuming that income in excess of mortgage PITI will be used for maintenance), and say you owe monthly payments of $3,400. You said your $90k results in take-home of ($1,800 + 500) * 2.17 bi-weekly periods per month = $4,991, leaving you with about $1,591 for all other expenses.  I don't see any expenses for the disabled mom - are you supporting her?  I see ONLY your debt expenses, nothing related to a personal budget type expenses.  Getting student loans onto IBR is a great step - but only a tiny portion of your problem.  Right now your fixed, reoccurring monthly expenses eat up 68.1% of your income.  Wow. That doesn't include:   Groceries and household items Dining out Consumption entertainment (beer) Utilities (at either house?) Internet / cable Home maintenance budget Medical expenses Cell phone Clothes Entertainment Gas (car) Insurance (car) Repairs (car) Parking costs (car) Public transit costs (if applicable) Costs of caring for the mom Term life insurance for BOTH you and your spouse, minimum of $500k coverage each (I can't imagine what would happen to the survivor if one of you were to pass) Savings of any sort for your retirement   Those are based on major categories for my budget, with some exclusions - I assume you have some of those expenses.  Google something like ""budget category list"" to find examples you can use.   I assume you also have costs associated with kids that you don't have in the above.  I know nothing about kids - so I can't help there.   This is not sustainable, as I'm sure you've noticed.  How old are the kids / can the spouse get a better job and can the kids look after themselves?  What would the SO's job prospects be, and is it cheaper to do daycare and have her work?    You have a pretty big mountain of debt.  I'm honestly a bit stunned that banks lent to you to buy the second house - your debt to income is way higher than the usual upper limit.  Was there a recent decrease in incomes?  Honestly you just need more income.  It's not really an option.  Given that you've firmly fixed your minimum expenses at almost 70% of your current income, there's not enough room to maneuver expenses down - your income needs to go up, a lot.  The cars and harley are absurd in your position.  Absolutely not justifiable.  You need to downgrade to one, more reasonable car, if possible.    The good news is that your current home, at $1,530 per month on a $4,991 income is 30% of your take home - that's probably something you can afford.    I don't know what to say, but you need to cut your debts and expenses ruthlessly, and you need more income."

And, as was said in the movie Vacation, ""I don't know why they call it Hamburger Helper. I think it tastes fine all by itself"".  In other words you got yourself into this mess by spending more than you make. The only way to fix is for a couple years to make more than you spend.  It's not easy I did it after totally screwing up too. I was $120,000 in debt and actually filled out bankruptcy paperwork but never turned it in. I told myself I got into this mess and I can get out of this mess. Took me five years working a full-time job and two part-time jobs. I had NO day off and NO vacation for the first three years. But five years later was debt free.   It sucked. And now EVERY time I even CONSIDER putting something on a credit card I remember what it was like to work 3 years straight (90 to 100 hours a week) with no day off and no vacation and that is enough incentive to NEVER borrow money again."
personalfinance,3e1sv0,SeahawksBandwagoner,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:41:22 2015 UTC,"There is not a simple answer to these numbers, but this is doable. It took a long time to get here, and it will take a while to get out. The first step is to recognize your choices got you here, and your choices (and a lot of hard work) will allow you to get out moving forward. Go to Dave Ramsey's website and find a 9 week course in the area; in the meantime the family members should read The Total Money Makeover and start making the changes needed. The first step is a written budget that you and your wife can look at to see where all the money goes, and how deep the hole is. That's worst case, and it gets better going forward. I'm seeing $55,000 in transportation debt, $15,000 in credit card debt, $77,000 in student loans, and $428,000 in house debt, for a total of $575,000. Thinking radically, if you cut up the credit cards (they've been helpful so far, right?), sell all the vehicles, sell the main house, and move into the rental (I'll assume the main house equity can cover 2 beater cars, which may not be true), you will have a sad family that understands you all are in a very tight spot, your debt will have dropped to $238,000 with a $90,000 income. That's 4-6 years of hard work left to get out of that hole, unless you (and/or your wife) start generating more income with extra jobs. The purpose of a 9 week course is to give you and your wife the tools to attack the problem, and a community of supporters to help you through it. BTW, bankruptcy leaves you with no houses or cars, $77,000 in student loan debt, and an atom bomb to your credit (if you keep any of the houses/cars you also keep the debt). Good luck, you CAN do this, it will take lots of hard work and a change in behavior."

Replace the Ford with a comparable used car for much less, replace the Harley with nothing.  That will allow you to stop paying the minimum on your credit cards. With your income, there is no reason other than laziness and overspending to have a maxed out $500 credit card.  Account for every dollar that leaves your hands. You need them all, you should know where they are going.  Your wife needs to earn more, your mother needs to watch the kids.  Any way you can refinance a house? We are switching from a 30 year to a 15 year tomorrow (yay!) and our monthly payment isn't changing. It also isn't costing us anything out of pocket.

personalfinance,3e2gyr,ebmoney,3,Tue Jul 21 13:37:34 2015 UTC,"6% is a common rate.  Likely it will be split with the buying agent.  So your agent gets 3% and gives the buying agent the other 3%.  Keep in mind everything is negotiable, including commission rate and who pays it."
personalfinance,3e2gyr,ryanjkoehlerdotcom,3,Tue Jul 21 13:35:44 2015 UTC,"The universal standard is the seller pays the selling agent 3% and the buying agent 3%.    Is that 6% including the 3% for the seller??  If it does not, fire her and find someone else.     You have to look at it that the market prices include 6% for the commissions.  You could make a little more if you want to sell by owner, but you are only saving 3% as you still have to pay 3% commission to the buyers agent.    The only way around this is to ask if your selling agent will take less than 3%, but they have no reason to agree to that since why would they do the work without the commission. A realtor has to pay about $3,000 to $5,000 a year just for MLS access, key access, online document service, yearly refresher classes for their license.  Then they have to pay part of their 3% commission to their broker. So their first 200K sale 3% commission pays for their yearly expenses.  Then what they sell after that goes into their profits after broker fees and taxes.  They essentially need to sell or buy 21 houses at $200K to make $100K commission a year after taxes.

I ended up going with Citi's Forward card and they have treated me well ever since. Though the review I've posted below says it's for college students, I'm not 100% sure you need to be one to get approved. Just saying it's an option.  One thing I always did, however, was to pay the entire balance off each month so that I wasn't tempted to let the balance carry. I know that some people like to spread a large item across a number of months with their credit card, but this was just my way of making sure I didn't bury myself in credit debt.  Citi Forward Review  Also: I'm not saying that OP will be easily approved, only that I personally didn't have a problem with getting approved for this card. """

The best credit score is don't have one, pay for things with cash or debit cards. THAT means a monkey will not be able to process a home loan application, you will need a lender to do manual underwriting when that day comes. The top advice from those who have become millionaires? Stay out of debt. And monthly payments for a depreciating asset (a car) will always delay your financial success. The average millionaire drives a 2 year old paid for car, which is what got them there in the first place.

Additionally, utilization is reported when your statement closes. If you want to make full use of your card but avoid high utilization, figure out the date your statement closes and set a reminder for 1-2 days before that to pay your card down to $5. Statement closes, reports the tiny amount of utilization, then you pay the $5.

After you account for that, you're going to be feeding it for a while until values and rent comes up to actually get some cash flow going. Refinancing it to increase monthly cash flow won't help with the following:  If you're running numbers based on only a $200k down payment... I disagree with the affordability calculators you're using. On the low end of a $1.4M home you're looking at $7k-ish/month on a 30 year loan, and your take home pay is maybe $16k/month assuming no state taxes, really cheap insurance, and no retirement contributions... There's no way I'm taking on a mortgage at 50% of my take home pay over 30 years.  If you sell your house you'll only be down to $5500-$6000/month on a 30 year loan for the $1.4M home, which would still be pretty high.  If it were me, I'd do a modified #5: Suck it up until you have enough money to sell the house and make a big enough down payment on the next home that the payments aren't such a significant portion of your income."

Yes it is possible to file or re-file your taxes after you have received an NOD (see above). If you do not pay or respond to the NOD by the deadline then the IRS assessment will become final.  Your brother will then start receiving ""Notice of Amount Due"" letters asking him to pay.  If he ignores those letters then his case will go to IRS collections.

Any information you can provide directly related to your ability to pay your rent is a plus, as far as I'm concerned, including any possible credit issues.  I, like most landlord, rely on that rent as a source of income.  I'm ecstatic if I have a tenant who pays their rent in full, on time, every month.    Six months of rent in advance would have me doing backflips.  (Although I'm not sure why you'd be paying rent 6 months at a time. You might want to check in with /r/financialadvice about that.)"

This took a lot of stress off of me financially since its one less bill to worry about it. For the apartments I rented, they usually did some kind of credit/background check so I don't think it's necessary to disclose ur credit history. I'd ask the landlord if they're OK with your lump payments. Good luck."

So if you have $10,000 in taxable income (not make $10,000, that's different - most single filers can subtract $6300 in a standard deduction and $4000 for each person they support including themselves, so you'd have no taxable income with salary of $10,000) then your taxes are 10%*$9075 + 15%*$(10,000-9075) = $1,046.25"

Your integrity is the most valuable thing you have, and your parents will be glad that you did the right thing.

In your case, there's not much difference ($.01 total). If you do the snowball, all your extra payments go to the lowest debt. If you do avalanche, your extra payments go to the highest interest debt.  Also, if you click on each loan individually under the graph, it will show you the monthly payments."
personalfinance,3e2k8u,Snivy_Whiplash,2,Tue Jul 21 15:32:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not 100% against taking out a 401k loan but you really have to think about a few things before you make that decision.  If your CC debt it roughly 10k, why are you considering taking out 16,700?  Don't take more than you need!  Also, find out if your 401k plan allow you to contribute while there is a loan outstanding.  If they suspend your contributions until the loan is paid back then absolutely don't even bother going this route.  You also need to do some serious math and figure out how long the loan would be for and what the weekly withdrawals would be from your paycheck and make sure you can live without seeing that money every week automatically.  For example in my case, my 401k allows me to take out a loan at 3.25% interest anywhere from 12-60 months and they don't suspend my contributions while I have loans outstanding so I can continue to dump money in.  So if I had a CC at $4000 with 18% interest I wanted to pay off, if I wanted to take out enough to cover the card and pay it back in a year my weekly payment would be roughly $86 right out of my check.  I'd have to make sure I'm OK with that.  The good part about the 401k loan though is that I'm basically paying myself back as opposed to paying back a financial institution.  So although some people are adamantly opposed to it, there are some variables and you really should do your homework.  I certainly wouldn't outright withdraw unless it's a flat out emergency but a loan might be worth it.  EDIT:  One other thing.  Make sure you're comfortable enough in your job to consider this option also.  A lot of plans require the loan to be paid back within 30-90 days of termination if you were to lose your position.  Luckily in my case I'm in an extremely secure union position with no risk of losing my employment.  So again, weigh all options."
personalfinance,3e2k8u,Snivy_Whiplash,2,Tue Jul 21 14:28:57 2015 UTC,"Initially, i was NOT talking about a loan.   If your CC debt it roughly 10k, why are you considering taking out 16,700? Don't take more than you need!   To cover the penalty and tax hit.   To get $10K cash in hand, I'd have to deplete my funds by $16k.  In my head, that made a lot of sense, because i'll be spending a LOT more than 16k to get rid of this debt otherwise     If i were to go the route of a loan, I'd only do the amount that i needed.     But someone below said that it would immediately become due if i quit my job (which is happening in 2 weeks) - so that doesn't seem to be an option."
personalfinance,3e2k8u,c2reason,2,Tue Jul 21 14:33:08 2015 UTC,because i'll be spending a LOT more than 16k to get rid of this debt otherwise   Only because you're planning to make the minimum payments.  Get your budget in control and make bigger payments.

One of the specific claims to file is for not receiving  a last paycheck.  A lot of times you can get a daily fine added on also.

I took them to small claims court after they repeatedly told me they would pay, but did not.  I show up in court on the day, and there's this greasy paralegal they sent to deal with me.  He sits down all smug and says ""my client agrees that he owes this man 700$ of unpaid wages, but all this about the 2,100 extra is completely new to us. We know nothing about the extra money.""  At which point I showed the judge signed cheques from my employer for that amount that had not cleared.  The judge has the bailiff escort me from the room, and I can hear the judge shouting at this other guy for about 15 minutes before he calls me back in and finds in my favour.  I highly suggest you go to small claims court - but before you do, get together EVERYTHING in writing that you have.  You said there's a stock purchase plan.  Did you get a contract with that?  If so, there might be a section on leaving the company. Is there allowance for paying out vacation days in your employment contract?  And remember - you might have to fight this yourself, but you're in the right, and even if it's only $1000, it's not a little thing.  There are countries where deliberate nonpayment of wages is considered slavery."

The thinking was that he'd get a bounced email message, but they wouldn't be the wiser that it was fake unless they replied all, in which case they would have acknowledged him. If you can identify a real email address there (or at your state's equivalent), even better.

Also, neither party can be represented by a lawyer, so you are on a more equal footing. The downside is that it is not enough to win, you have to collect. If the person you sued is a deadbeat or has their assets under someone else's name (quite common with the kind of people who get sued in small claims court) it can be tough, but for an established company it shouldn't be too hard."

There may have been a process to cash out your stock plan, but it shouldn't take more than one pay period to do.  As others have said, I would recommend sending them a certified letter explaining that you have emailed HR several times for your final paycheck and have heard nothing. Let them know you are hoping to hear from them within XX days but, if you don't, you will file a complaint with the Department of Labor.  The certified letter shows good faith on your part, and then you can include that in your wage complaint if they still do not respond."

Other options is to let the IRS take it and buy the land back for much less at auction."

personalfinance,3dvsdp,MikeTheVike,817,Sun Jul 19 23:07:18 2015 UTC,"When my first wife died with over $200k in medical bills I got an attorney. He informed me that her bills would be paid out of her estate and that if there were not enough assets to satisfy the debts, they were not my legal responsibility to pay. In my state, jointly owned assets pass directly to the surviving spouse and are not eligible to be seized for paying off the deceased' debts. The attorney took out public notice for anyone looking to collect a debt to file a notice with the court. Within 12 months, the process ended. My wife had no personal assets (other than clothes, jewelry, etc) and all of the main assets (cars and home) were jointly owned. My understanding is that unless your Grandma specifically signed hospital papers accepting financial responsibility for his bills, they are the responsibility of his estate to pay. I did work with the medical claimants to make sure that they had all of her insurance information. Most accepted that and went away. The only one that came after me personally was an ambulance service that transported her from one hospital to another. They refused to take her insurance info stating that they don't accept insurance. The attorney finally had to send them a cease and desist (which they eventually did). I also got allot of guilt ridden calls from the hospital accounts payable trying to imply that I was 'ethically' and 'morally' responsible for her debts. They accepted her insurance so I referred them to the attorney and they went away as well.  Note: IANAL - personal experience. Sorry for your loss. Hope your grandma is doing OK.  Edit to clarify: thanks to /u/chickenchowmeinmang and /u/Zahn_Nen_Dah for their comments. My state (PA) is a common law state. Nine states are 'community property' states where debts and assets are a shared responsibility. OP should consult an attorney to confirm what options Grandma has."

But, and this is a huge but, we have excellent health insurance and hit max out of pocket pretty much immediately (didn't hurt that there was a c-section bill a month earlier, helping to get closer to out of pocket max). Of the $600+k medical bills, I paid ~$3,000-ish and figured it was fair trade vs hiring a lawyer and dealing with debt collectors.  In OP's situation, she absolutely needs to get an estate attorney who can walk her through the probate process and tell the hospital bill collectors to go pound sand."

For example, my wife labored for 17 hours (12 without a spinal block) and still ended up in a c-section because they didn't bother to check the baby's position when we went in after her water broke.  17 hours of doctors with their hands up her bits, saying, ""I definitely feel head, but it feels like 'caput'"" (elongated conehead, not atypical with a vaginal birth).  Turns out that they were feeling butt the entire time, because the kid flipped breech.  I'm not blaming the OB, but that doesn't mean I have to be happy with the services they provided.

I suffered from sudden onset extreme headaches that were only relieved with narcotic pain medicine. The OB said that was normal pregnancy symptoms (5th baby and never had headache issues in a prior pregnancy). According to the neurologist I saw at 6 weeks postpartum, I have a meningioma tumor pressing on my occipital nerve causing occipital neuralgia. Apparently the hormones a pregnant woman has causes these tumors to grow at an exponential rate. So now I get to look forward to probable brain surgery. Mine is less dire than your wife but still frustrating that the OB said it was ""normal pregnancy stuff."""
personalfinance,3dvsdp,ScienceNerdGirl,12,Mon Jul 20 13:41:34 2015 UTC,"frustrating that the OB said it was ""normal pregnancy stuff.""   This thread is just making me dislike ob/gyn's even more. I have such a similar story (though not as dire). I have endometriosis - a problem specifically to do with the female reproductive system. Five different ob/gyn's passed my symptoms off as ""normal.""   My GP, however (and bless his heart) decided to look into it and sent me for an ultrasound first and after that to get a laproscopy done by a specialist. It was revealed that i had endometriosis lesions spread throughout my pelvic cavity. Growths and scarring almost entirely encased my bladder. They were plastering my left ovary to my intestines, and overall the cause of the abdominal pain and digestive issues I had been experiencing for years. Treatment has made my life worlds better, but it frustrates me to no end that the doctors who were supposed to be most likely to catch this disorder were actually the people who were most likely to blow it off.  For some reason there's this perpetual attitude of ""eh, women""  whenever we complain of pain or discomfort. It's like people - doctors even - believe that women are supposed to be miserable, that any pain or complaint can be chalked up to ""women's hormones / lady problems / that time-of-the-month which is supposed to suck"" or over-exaggeration of the experience."

personalfinance,3dvsdp,ScienceNerdGirl,3,Mon Jul 20 15:45:28 2015 UTC,"I think the icing on the cake was just how wrong the ob/gyn's were about it at times.  My mother had told me she had endometriosis, and I realized at some point that maybe that's what was going on with me. I was like 18 at the time, and I asked the ob/gyn i was seeing about the chances I had endo, too. He told me i was ""too young"" to have endometriosis. That's a huge misconception about endo, but modern medicine says that, actually, endometriosis starts at menses but might even exist at birth. That there's no such thing as being ""too young."" And at 19 I had my surgery that showed the conclusive evidence the endometriosis existed, and had existed for a while there (much of the scarring was old).   The very last ob/gyn i saw before my GP intervened was almost ridiculous. He tried to tell me what one of the first ob/gyn's did - that it was ""ovulation pains."" I went home, and then it hit me... ""wait a minute, I shouldn't be ovulating - I'm on the birth control pill! and he prescribed it to me!!!"" Of all mistakes for a doctor that specializes in the female reproductive system could make... that one was almost comical. An ob/gyn who prescribes the birth control pill should know that the patient he's presribing it too isn't ovulating."

personalfinance,3dvsdp,ScienceNerdGirl,4,Mon Jul 20 15:43:53 2015 UTC,"The death benefit amount is so small because for whatever reason it wasn't set up to grow with inflation like all the other benefits.  So back in the 1940s or so when the death benefit was created, $225 was a nice chunk of change and could see you through a rough patch.  Now, it's barely worth my time to even apply for the money, given my effective hourly wage (salaried, so I technically still got paid while sitting at the SSA office) vs. the amount of time spent in SSA offices trying to get things going.   Don't feel obligated to answer but did you guys carry life insurance policies?   This is PF.  That's the right question to ask.  I've mentioned it several times in several other threads when people ask about what to do, so I'll say it here, too.  I had $200k in term life on my wife.  I also have some term life on myself, though it's probably not enough and I need to get that reevaluated and updated.  My wife was a stay at home mom, so conventional wisdom of ""You need term life if you have dependents in order to replace your income if you were to die,"" doesn't seem to apply at first glance.  Except that my wife did create income, by saving us the cost of day care and formula.  So you really do need term life on a stay at home parent in order to replace what they provide.  Day care is not cheap.  In the end, my in-laws chose to move in with me to help raise the kids while I work, thus saving me day care costs (day-to-day household expenses increase a bit with the net addition of one more adult in the house).  So I've earmarked the life insurance payout as college funds for the kids instead (that was something I was doing anyway, so that freed up $1000/mo in the budget that was previously going to 529 contributions)."

personalfinance,3dvsdp,HighLordMhoram,78,Mon Jul 20 00:25:57 2015 UTC,"Throwaway account.  I work at one of the largest healthcare companies in the US; we have hospitals in numerous states, from West to East, from North to South.  I work in the revenue department, dealing with these charges and insurance adjustments, etc.  I am two steps away from direct access to the CFO (the CFO is my boss's boss), so a little discretion in case things...come back.  First - Discuss with a lawyer (that she should already have just as a course of handling your grandpa's estate).  If the bills will not pass to her, then that's good.  However, I would ensure the billing is correct so that less money can be taken from your grandpa's remaining assets or social security money, etc.  Not sure how all that works - I'm an accountant and not a lawyer, sadly.    Bills were on Medicare.  This is good.  For Part A (Inpatient hospital stays), consumers have a deductible of $1,260 for 2015.  This is the only amount that your grandpa's estate (or grandmother, depending on state of residence) should have to pay.  I look at payments from Medicare all the time that show ""Total Claims are this; your agreement with us says you will get paid only this.  Oh, but the patient has not paid their deductible yet, so you will actually get $1,260 of that money from them.""  So, $10,000 bill, Medicare says, ""Nope, $4,260.  Here's $3,000; the other $1,260 will come from the patient.""  Now, of this $1,260, Medicare has a process in place that AUTOMATICALLY sends the deductible portion as a claim to Medicaid for eligible patients.  Some patients are approved for additional Medicaid funding; these patients are called ""Crossover"" patients (or, officially, ""Dual Eligible"").  See if the hospital has a copy of the remit from Medicare, and then see if they have a copy of the remit or rejection from Medicaid.  You don't necessarily need a copy of it, but, assuming the Medicare part was right, you do want to know if the Medicaid claim was denied and WHY.  Are there any steps you or the hospital could take?  Sometimes, the hospital will get the claim back from Medicaid with a payment of only $1.  This means the patient was approved, but Medicaid is not going to pay for the difference.  The hospital has no recourse and is not legally allowed to pursue the patient.  These bad debts are claimed immediately by the hospital, and Medicare reimburses the hospital for 65% of all eligible bad debts.  I say this to you because even if there is an amount outstanding, your grandpa is not legally responsible for it.  Medicare and Medicaid were, and they told the hospital ""Accept this.""  The hospital must.    If the charges for Part A are valid and she still can't meet the $1,260 (or portion thereof), every hospital should have a request for charitable relief form.  Or they should have a discount form.  You have to supply financials or bank statements and such, and then go through a painful process where your statements and application go to a hospital board and are debated over, etc.  Another option if necessary.  For these Part A claims, the last thing is that the patient starts to incur additional copay charges if they have an inpatient stay exceeding two months.  You said it was only a few days, so this should not be an issue.  This information, and all of the above, is based on the hospital side of things.  There is also a doctor side of things (which is why you usually get two bills for each visit), plus pharmacy, plus an optional supplemental.  For physician charges (Part B), he would be responsible for $147 PLUS 20% of the remaining bill.  So, a charge for $1,147.  He pays the first $147.  Then, he pays 20% on the remaining $1,000 = $200.  Total payment due to hospital = $147 + $200 = $347.  I do not know what kinds of helps there are here.  However, I would assume and hope that the doctors have some kind of bad debt/charity process in place.  For drug costs - which can show up on the hospital statement - I do not know off the top of my head if these are going to be Part D or Part A.  If Part A - the drugs charges and payment are included based on the treatment of your grandfather, and the drugs used are customary and usually given in the course of treatment.  If separate, then it's because the drugs aren't considered part of the treatment, even if they are what is usually given.  Sorry for my lack of knowledge on B and D, but the payments we receive usually just give a code for the treatment (called a DRG code), number of days, claim amount, and actual payment amount.  I do not know how detailed the hospital bills are; we never see them or need to see them.  We only need the claim type and to know whether the remaining amount is going to bad debt or charity.  TL;DR - The hospital bill should only be $1,260 at most for Part A deductible.  The $1,260 can be sent to your state's Medicaid in some cases; see if this was done or what you need to do to appeal a denial/start this process if your grandpa was not submitted for Medicaid.  Might need to add drug costs for Part D to get hospital bill total.  Can submit a request for relief through a charity applciation (best option - usually total write-off) or discount application (good option - 35% reduction or so).  For doctor bills - which come separate from the hospital bill - Part B is billed at $147 deductible PLUS 20% of the remaining balance.  See if doctor has a charity policy in place.    TL;DRTL;DR - Options exist.  Check 'em out.  Plus, this: https://www.medicare.gov/Pubs/pdf/10126.pdf"

As to wife, however, in light of the fact that she was not liable in contract for the services provided to patient, it was essential that the hospital establish that the services were necessary in order to hold her liable for payment for such services. The common law doctrine of necessaries is the law in Missouri... Where the husband and wife have separate assets, the spouse receiving the necessaries would have the primary responsibility or liability to pay such costs; the other spouse would be secondarily liable. Under the doctrine of necessaries, if the medical services patient received were necessary and patient maintained no separate assets, wife would be liable for the reasonable value of the medical services patient received.

I have tons of medical bills for myself and I chose not to pay the full out of pocket ones for when I had no insurance. The hospitals have sent my records to another debt collection agency, but it has NOT affected my credit. However, they most certainly could. Some do, some don't. It just depends on collection agency and if they want to take it that far. If they did affect your credit, it will be erased from your record about 7 years after.

personalfinance,3dvsdp,unagirap,18,Mon Jul 20 07:50:27 2015 UTC,"I've tried saying this before, Medicare indeed only pays 80%--80% of what Medicare deems appropriate; e.g., the doctor wants $100 for something, but Medicare will only pay $50, and of that only 80% of $50, not 80% of the $100. If the doctor or hospital does not accept ""assignment"" as payment in full (and most don't these days), then you will be billed for the rest.

It already SAYS that on the report.   He didn't do anything.  His professional input was not needed, so it's not legit, and insurance says ""this is not a covered expense"".    Actually they're saying it's fraudulent, but that word carried legal liabilities.  They could face libel charges, and they don't want to go there.

Medicare part C is not a separate benefit but a plan that adds to the existing Medicare part A and B that you are enrolled in.  It does not matter for Part C or Part F, it all works the same. Medicare covers 80%, you cover 20%. Yes, the 20% can be expensive, this is why it is highly encouraged to sign up for a Medicare Supplemental or Advantage plan (State Dependent) This will cover the additional amounts owed by you the insured. Very cheap for the benefit. Again check with what plans are available in your state."

personalfinance,3e2e1e,Ricrob612,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:58:19 2015 UTC,TL;DR: No. No. Just buy it out when the lease is up (the only option).
personalfinance,3e2e1e,MyNameIsRay,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:28:13 2015 UTC,"Generally, you have 3 options at the end of a lease. 1) Turn in the car and walk away.  You will, however, be responsible for any mileage you went over the amount you 'purchased' at the beginning of the lease. 2) Buy the car.  In this situation you could buy the car for the residual value at the time of the end of the lease.  There is a new loan created and you then continue to make payments on the loan until it is paid off.  Of course, if you have the funds, you could just pay cash instead. 3) You can ""trade-in"" the vehicle toward another.  This case is less likely because it would assume that the amount you paid in on the lease actually put you in an equitable situation, which is typically not the case, but dealers like to throw this out there as an attractive, yet unlikely option.  You do not get your money back at the end of the lease.  You should have proof of the money down from the lease agreement, buyer's order, etc. from when you took possession of the vehicle.  Best course of action at the end of the lease is determine which option above is best for your situation.  If you are set on buying the vehicle then I would suggest saving as much as you can to put toward it without compromising regular personal/retirement savings."

Get the full 401k match, and then just compare funds with an IRA to 401k - IRA's will have more choices. This assumes you get the full deduction though (income <$61,000 if single since you have a retirement plan at work).

Dementia doesn't get better. While taking care of her, you also have to take care of yourselves because the emotional, financial, and physical toll is devastating for the caretakers. At a minimum, look into respite care so that you can take an occasional break. Some Alzheimer's assisted living centers offer respite care where your MIL could stay for a weekend while you get a chance to take a mental break. That could also give your partner a chance to see how well his mother does in a care facility.  Get your MIL to sign a durable power of attorney now if she's capable of it. Your partner needs to be able to make legal and financial decisions for her and he will absolutely need that piece of paper. If your MIIL is too far gone, you'll need to go to go court and petition for guardianship. You say she has no income. Are you in the US? Is she not receiving any kind of Social Security benefits? She should be receiving something based on either her past income or her spouse's. Widows are eligible to receive benefits based on their spouse's earnings. The average social security benefit is something like $1,200 a month.  She should still be eligible for Medicaid. Your income won't matter. They will calculate how much benefit she gets from living with you - the equivalent of what is free rent and food would count as ""income"" for medicaid, but it shouldn't prevent her from qualifying. The application process SUCKS, but just keep plugging along and you'll get through it eventually.  The Alzheimer's Association has a 24/7 helpline.  They should be able to provide you with some support and some ideas about steps you can take.   When your partner's father made him promise not to put his mother in a retirement home, that kind of promise almost always come from fear. If you look beyond the words, what his father was asking was for him to care for his mother to the best of his ability. With Alzheimer's that is most likely going to require professional care at some point. Your partner can still love and care for his mother if she is in a 24-hour care facility. You can personalize her room with all her favorite things from home, you can visit frequently, you can take her out to brunch, bring her to your house for dinner, etc. My mother was absolutely terrified to leave her home and move into an assisted living facility. But she wasn't safe at home. She didn't eat properly, she couldn't take her medicine properly, we worried about her wandering off at night and not being able to find her way home or burning down the house by leaving the oven on. It took my mother almost exactly two weeks to settle into her new assisted living quarters and then she loved it. Because of her memory issues, she stopped even asking about her previous home where she lived for 35 years. The assisted living facility just became her home."

I think you should at least include nursing homes and their costs/benefits in your research. Your husband might change his mind if he can see that there is a safe, clean, happy care home in your area. These homes might take her government and military benefits. If they need more money above that, it might be cheaper than in home care.   Does she qualify/have  social security, SSI, any retirement accounts, pensions, etc?  It would be ethically okay, in my opinion, to completely use these funds to pay for her care before you and your husband quit a job or spend $3,000 a month.  I wouldn't worry about preserving the principle of any account at this point.

Maybe a support group setting will connect you to people who can get you to the services you need. Sorry my reply is vague; it is the first idea that comes to me.  Lastly, those estranged siblings really need to be brought in because you cannot afford this on your own and you've already given tons of time as a caregiver. I don't care how estranged they are.

If she gets benefits, it's going into some bank account, right? Does she file a tax return? If she is still handling this herself, it's probably time to get her to sign a Power of Attorney so your partner can handle it. Also, she needs to give your partner a POA for healthcare if he does not have one already. If she is receiving benefits, she should be paying the two of you a portion of the food costs and something for ""rent"". That is perfectly OK.   A consultation with an elder law attorney might be the best $$ you could spend."

personalfinance,3e1s3v,redditorA85,3,Tue Jul 21 08:10:49 2015 UTC,"First question is how would you suggest investing the last 10,000 for short-term? My first thought was to put it in individual stocks like Google, but I’m not sure.   Keep it in an FDIC-insured savings account.  Money you know you will need in the short term should not be exposed to larger market risk.  Please read the information found in the FAQ, particularly ""I Have $[X] ... What Do I Do With It?!"" and the Long-Term Investing Start-Up Kit.  You may find Your IRA and You: Basic Information and Your 401k and You: Basic Information worth a read as well."
personalfinance,3e1s3v,aBoglehead,2,Tue Jul 21 08:59:07 2015 UTC,"The target date (actually called target retirement) funds do not mean you have to keep your money invested until that time. Rather, they are funds that lower their risk as they near the target date (i.e. they move from heavier stock weighting to heavier bond weighting). This reduces the chance that a large swing in the stock market will really hurt your finances if you are near retirement.  This also helps to answer you question on the short-term investment. Investing in individual stocks is probably the worst choice you can make unless you are an incredibly (read ""impossibly"") good investor. You really don't know what will happen to any individual company's stock in a given year. Instead, put short term money into a bond fund where you know it can't lose a huge portion of its value in the next 3 years."

personalfinance,3e0qrx,macabre_trout,17,Tue Jul 21 01:51:13 2015 UTC,"Unless that $14.5k savings is earning you more interest than your student loan is costing you... then yes, absolutely.  Edit: And good job. It sounds like you've got your shit together."
personalfinance,3e0qrx,wutjustidonteven,8,Tue Jul 21 01:53:39 2015 UTC,"Derp, I forgot to mention interest rates. Student loans are at 4.5%, savings account is at 0.7%."
personalfinance,3e0qrx,wutjustidonteven,5,Tue Jul 21 01:56:03 2015 UTC,Just to reiterate my other post; definitely ditch the loan.   You should be able to save more towards a car over the course of two years so it shouldn't be necessary to blow your e-fund.
personalfinance,3e0qrx,wutjustidonteven,2,Tue Jul 21 01:59:39 2015 UTC,"I think I'll be able to, I'm just trying to have a back-up plan in case my thirteen-year-old car bites the dust before then. I refuse to finance cars so I'd be paying cash up front for my next one."
personalfinance,3e0qrx,Hahahahahahai,3,Tue Jul 21 02:02:48 2015 UTC,"You could use that savings to pay off the student loan, then you'll have the remaining balance in the savings to use as the foundation of a new car fund?   You could even just continue to make those ""student loan payments"" into your car fund, since you know you can afford that much."
personalfinance,3e0qrx,xtrexjpsouz,3,Tue Jul 21 02:10:17 2015 UTC,You could always split the baby - pay off half the student loans or whatever portion you feel you can handle while keeping a comfortable amount as an emergency fund. Paying off $5K of the loans should net you around $225 in negated interest costs the first year alone.
personalfinance,3e0qrx,ynabismyfavoritesub,2,Tue Jul 21 05:00:41 2015 UTC,"This. Worst case scenario, if OP needs to finance a portion of the cost of the car... it's likely that the car loan will have a lower interest rate than the student loan (since car loans are secured debt)."
personalfinance,3e0qrx,appleciders,4,Tue Jul 21 14:05:53 2015 UTC,"One way to look at it is that a new car loan probably has about 3% interest right now, while you're paying 4.5% on your student loan. That means using the money for your loans instead of a car is the cheaper option (not that you NEED to get a new car, but just using a comparison).  So yes, pay off those loans! :)"
personalfinance,3e0qrx,ANGR1ST,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:33:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, especially since you could make a large down payment on the used car, maybe 60% or more, and get a small loan to cover the rest. That would leave you with some solid savings, too."
personalfinance,3e0qrx,mm0827,4,Tue Jul 21 04:03:50 2015 UTC,Pay it off. But ask for a 'payoff balance' before you make the payment. That will include an estimate of the interest in the next couple of days between when you make the payment and it gets processed. Otherwise you may end up with a $10 balance remaining that can accrue fees or even default.
personalfinance,3e0qrx,amnmonix,3,Tue Jul 21 02:35:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, absolutely pay it off. At one point my wife helped me realize that with student loans, any savings I have aren't really savings if I owe them to someone else. We knocked out the last 35k of my loans that night, erasing all ""savings"" except for the emergency fund. Now 2 years later we have paid for our wedding and honeymoon on our own, and managed to save up a 20% down payment for an apartment we will close on in the next month.  I don't think we would have been able to do it still paying the loans though. It was a huge relief and really jump started savings after that."
personalfinance,3e0qrx,mmmmmmBacon12345,3,Tue Jul 21 01:59:11 2015 UTC,Pay the loans. You won't regret it.   Way to go.
personalfinance,3e0qrx,Corky_StClair,2,Tue Jul 21 02:23:18 2015 UTC,"Whats the interest on your loan?  You shouldn't be planning to buy a new car out of your emergency fund, thats creating an emergency where there doesn't need to be one.  You can throw a few thousand at the loan to speed up the pay down process but i wouldn't nuke all your savings just to kill off the loan.  There is no penalty for paying it all off at once."

personalfinance,3dyfaf,gospursgo99,42,Mon Jul 20 15:35:31 2015 UTC,"At 40K a year with a new child, you have a very narrow margin of safety for speculative investments. Razor thin.  Paying off your house now with all of that cash you've saved -- unless you have a high interest rate on your mortage -- is not smart at all. And I am not saying you are not smart -- you are pretty frugal to amass all that cash on a 40K salary!  I know you are feeling like you might be missing out, but a great investor is a defensive investor who evaluates the risk associated with investments first and only then looks at the upside. Houses are highly illiquid and require huge amounts of capital and expensive upkeep.  A general rule for budgeting is is 50/20/30. 50 percent of your income toward necessities, like housing and bills. Twenty percent should then go toward financial goals, like paying off debt or saving for retirement. Finally, thirty percent of your income can be allocated to wants, like dining or entertainment.  You need to keep a stash of 6 months in savings in cash for: emergencies, for house repairs, and in case you become unemployed for more than a week and need to pay your mortgage. AND because you have a kid and maybe you'll have a medical emergency or a big bill coming up, something you haven't planned on. Seriously. Don't even think about investing your 6 months of savings into something speculative; keep that cash in a bank account that pays a tiny bit of interest somewhere you can't touch easily. (Put it in a credit union or an internet bank account like Capitol 360, something separate from your day to day banking account.) You really need that cash to be available though. The statistics are such that the average middle-income family will spend roughly $12,000 on child-related expenses in their baby's first year of life. By age two, parents are up to more than $12,500 per year. If you are lower income, you can certainly squeeze that down a bit, but even pets average around $100-200 bucks a month.   As a rule of thumb, obligations for total house payments should max out around 1/3 of your after tax income.    And 12-15% should be going into retirement savings every single year. If you don't have retirement set up, do that! Open a brokerage account with Fidelity or another large brokerage house and invest in a broad EFT fund, like the NASDAQ ETT or S&P500 ETF. For most people who are getting started, these are broad stock index investments that do well over time. EFTs like these don't go bankrupt. In that vein, do NOT purchase stocks unless you know what you are doing and can value a security.  From a personal perspective,  in good years, I make between 10-30% a year on my investments, but real estate where we live typically appreciates around 4% per year. My investments are liquid and I can sell them at any time; my house remains a very expensive and an illiquid investment that will take weeks or months to sell. Most of my money goes to my investments, natch."
personalfinance,3dyfaf,rainbird,6,Mon Jul 20 16:50:39 2015 UTC,"This is all great advice, I just want to put my two cents in regarding the expense of kids. I have twins, so we went full-frugal mode when they were born - diapers/wipes from costco (wasn't going to attempt cloth with twins but that's bonus frugality points if you do!), clothes from thrift shops, breastfeeding and transitioning to normal foods when they need solids (don't buy baby food - gross and expensive).   You're going to be told you need lots of specialty gear for your baby. Here's what we bought new: cribs and carseats. The safety regulations change too much to buy used there. Otherwise, thrift shops and garage sales are your friends - babies grow out of clothes SO FAST so they're basically new. I bought a trashbag of baby clothes from a garage sale for $10, and have saved it for the next little ones down the road.   Overall, the best investment you can spend on babies is your time, trust me :) Good luck!"

The delivery itself was ~$5000 after insurance. We have lots of friends with kids, so we spent very little on things like clothes. After all was said and done, I doubt we spent more than $10,000 on the first year of life, and we probably spent closer to $8000, and this includes delivery (most of that paid for by my employer via HSA contributions).  So yes, having a child really doesn't need to be expensive. If we have a second one, I bet we spend half the expected amount per child."

personalfinance,3dyfaf,mattisonholdatwork,15,Mon Jul 20 19:52:42 2015 UTC,"Please do not do this. Real estate investing should be done after everything else is done. Please create an emergency fund, then fund your IRA, 401k's and then pay off your home(assuming you have no other debt which if you do pay that off before funding retirement). Buy all real estate investments with cash and make sure you are making a profit the day you buy the property(get a reaally good deal on it)."
personalfinance,3dyfaf,dave35,3,Mon Jul 20 17:08:11 2015 UTC,"In some markets it's quite realistic to put 20% down and make an immediate, stable profit paying effective returns much higher than the market index, although the volatility will of course be high.

This is a situation where OP may be able to come up with a good business plan that's highly likely to provide >>4% returns over the long run. Obviously there are risks to deal with, but I think folks ITT are overstating how hard it is to just build possible risks (major repairs, extended vacancies) into the business plan."

personalfinance,3dyfaf,Flawres91,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:36:51 2015 UTC,"Could you clarify what you mean by investing in property?  If you mean buying a property with the intention of it being a long term investment that you rent out, then I have to strongly disagree with mattisonholdatwork's assertion that you should do this last and/or only do it with cash.  It's not realistic and is really self defeating.  The only equation that is important is whether you can, without leaving yourself cash strapped, find a property that can realistically be rented out for as much, or hopefully more than the total of the mortgage, the taxes, the insurance, and the maintenance.  Everything in that list is tax deductible, so if the rent covers that, then what you have is essentially a house that pays for itself.  If it makes more in rent than that total, then you have a small income.  Eventually, if you hold it long enough then inflation typically causes the rent to rise higher than the expenses, but either way, 25 or 30 years in the future, you have a rental that is paid off.  The only other question you need to ask is whether you want to be a landlady because if that thought doesn't appeal to you in the slightest, then you shouldn't be considering this at all.  Speaking as a landlady myself, it can be a real grind when you have an asshole in your house but when you have good tenants and a sound property without a lot of deficiencies, then it can work out great.  edit: I should add that if you do decide to become a landlady, then you need to also maintain an even larger than typical emergency fund because you've now increased your possible universe of emergencies...water heater blows in the rental, you now have to hire a plumber and get a new one installed (assuming you can't do it yourself)  HVAC blows...better get it fixed pronto.  Eventually it's going to need a new roof and that can cost a bundle.  I have half a year after tax salary in my e fund to cover this, plus my own personal liabilities."

Still owe 58K on it   Maybe I'm naive, but I would argue that you don't ""own"" a house you still owe money on.  You will own it when it's paid off, but it can still disappear if you stop making payments.  A mortgage is a secured loan with ramifications beyond your credit score.  Owning one something is generally preferable to leasing two somethings.  If you're unable to take on much risk and specifically looking for stability, reducing your liability to banks (rather than increasing it) seems smarter to me."

The first two years are typically core classes which are the same regardless of which school it is, and you'll still have a degree from the expensive private school   I understand that this is an exciting time for you and your family, especially being the first member of your family to attend college. I just graduated in May, and I can tell you that 24k/year for school is not worth it. If people are telling you that student loan debt is good debt then they are absolutely misinformed.

It's a similar situation with computer science - the starting salaries are so high already for entry level positions that having a master's with no work experience won't do much for you. If anything, it may work against you. A master's should be used to further your career, not to start it.  Also, most master's program are roughly ~36 credit hours, or 1 full year of classes, so this 4+1 program is actually a regular 4 year undergrad + 1 year master's program that you seem to be paying a premium price for under the guise of it being some special accelerated program.   I went to a small, public in-state school that specializes in engineering. We are the sister school to Georgia Tech. Tuition was 3k/semester and most students graduate in 4-4.5 years. My friend studied mechanical engineering with a focus in aviation, did several projects throughout his time in school, and was hired by Lockheed Martin after graduation with a starting salary of 60k + 10k signing bonus. As part of the benefits package, they will pay for him to work on a master's degree after 1 year of employment, and that will result in a pay raise once completed.

personalfinance,3e0xug,KarthusMain,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:20:01 2015 UTC,"I think this is a bad idea. If you are maxing out your federal loans each year that is about $27000 a year (assuming that it's just Stafford loan and not Parent PLUS or anything like that). That's generally the maximum you should borrow for your undergraduate degree as well as what the average college student with debt graduates with (in total) at the end of four years. You are planning to borrow that much each year, which is a huge mistake.  Adding another $96000 (and it will be more than that due to accruing interest and the fact that tuition will likely increase each year) is an extremely bad idea regardless of which school.  Before you consider private loans, have your parents look into the federal Parent PLUS loan? Depending on their credit score, they may find this loan more reasonable in terms of interest rates (it is a fixed interest rather than variable and it may be lower than what some borrowers would qualify for in the private market). In addition, one big protection that federal loans come with that private student loans don't necessarily have is that they are discharged upon the death of either you or your parents (God forbid!)  But in all seriousness even a Parent PLUS loan would be a bad idea for the amount that you are seeking. Student loan debt at that level is so far above the norm that people who do this frequently end up on the news. It's much much better to find a more affordable school so that when you graduate your life won't be dominated by these payments. Have you run a loan amortization calculator (you can find some on sites like this one? It will show you how much it will cost you per month to pay off this loan it's really worth looking at before you make a bad decision.)"

personalfinance,3dykd9,decaturbob,2,Mon Jul 20 16:18:01 2015 UTC,There's a special form you have to fill out if you've had the insurance less than a year to determine if it's a preexisting condition.
personalfinance,3dykd9,NTesla,3,Mon Jul 20 16:25:03 2015 UTC,"I recently had surgery for an umbilical hernia. I had it for seven years before I even knew it was a hernia. I just thought my navel had 'blown-out' somehow from being bloated a lot. I'm insured through the ACA and I didn't have a problem with the insurance paying. I told the docs the truth, not even thinking about preexisting conditions. The insurance company did send me a form to fill out because they were concerned that I may have gotten the hernia at work (I didn't), which I am assuming would have been a workman's comp claim. Other than that, no problems."
personalfinance,3dykd9,Llero,4,Mon Jul 20 16:53:53 2015 UTC,"Insurance specialist at a large clinic/hospital here. Couple steps you need to take. This is gonna be the short version.  First, establish care with a primary care provider, tell him about the symptoms, tell him you think it ""might be a hernia"" if you want, but let him do the diagnosis and make sure you tell him that you have not seen a doctor about it before. Let the plan of care be developed, indicate that he would like surgery, et cetera.   Now, in order to figure out what your insurance will cover, you'll need to check your benefits. Hospital billing is a real monster, so there are a couple things you can do to help make it a little easier. Once the procedure is planned, contact your surgeon's staff and ask to speak to either an insurance specialist, an authorization specialist, or a coding specialist. You want to get the CPT codes that are going to be used for your procedure. When you have them, you can call your insurance company's benefits department. Tell them you want to check benefits on the CPT codes, and they'll tell you roughly the rate at which they'll get covered - usually as a percentage.  Additionally, call the hospital and ask to speak with a financial counselor - ask about any charity care or financial aid programs they have, what the requirements are, and how you can apply. Those are usually pretty challenging and require a lot of verification of income, but are definitely worth investigating.  Getting hard numbers in advance is going to be really tough. Just be diligent, make sure you check all the information you're given twice, and don't be afraid to call the hospital or your insurance and ask for help."

If we start the process now will the new insurance attempt to make the old insurance cover it? The current insurance will only cover a flat $2k for outpatient surgeries according to the policy we received. The new insurance has a deductible to be met and then they cover the rest. So it will be much cheaper if the surgery is as much as people say it can be.
personalfinance,3dykd9,Watchingpornwithcas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:24:24 2015 UTC,"Good question. I messed up - didn't realize you were transitioning between plans. I would see if you can find more information about the plan you're transitioning on-to. They would almost certainly expect the old policy to cover any office visits in the interim, but I'm not sure how they would treat the surgery if it occurred after starting the new plan.  It can be really granular from plan to plan. You definitely need more information."
personalfinance,3dykd9,Watchingpornwithcas,3,Mon Jul 20 23:57:25 2015 UTC,"I am a claim processer at a major insurance company and on those rare plans that do still have preexisting condition exclusions, they are only considered preexisting if you've received treatment during the look back period (usually about 18 months prior to starting the new plan). Since your husband only noticed the problem after starting this, you shouldn't have any problems. There might be some hoops to jump through (like having the doctor fill out a form stating the exact dates he/she treated your husband), but all in all, I'd be surprised if it denies."

You might be able to get him in for a consult with a doctor on this insurance and see if the doctor is okay with postponing until the better insurance starts up.  If you're currently insured, the risk of preexisting condition exclusions is less, since what those really aim to prevent is people going uninsured and then only getting insurance when they get sick."

They really might not have checked for a hernia.  Umbilical hernias don't tend to just happen overnight (or in two months).  It's also very possible that there's no urgent need to get this fixed.  Some people deal with hernias for years without getting them fixed, and certainly many people wait until it's a convenient time (e.g., the farmer puts it off until after harvest).  He should either see a family doctor or go right to a surgeon and get an opinion before you guys get too far down the road of planning time off and everything."

personalfinance,3dy25i,shifty_coder,3,Mon Jul 20 18:07:39 2015 UTC,"This is one of the parts I don't like.  8% is a fairly significant portion of your income, and doesn't include the deductible if you actually need to use your health insurance. It's essentially a flat-tax which gives no consideration to lower-income brackets.  The penalty is going to be whichever is higher; 2.5% of your income or $695. It's specifically designed to make people who earn under $34,750 (2% of that is 695) pay a higher percentage of their income.   A single person making $30,000 would only have 17% of their premium subsidized, with 8% of their income going to premiums. Using plans from the exchange based on that income, they may have a deductible of $5,550 (before which they cover nothing). That's 18.5% of their income in deductible + 8% in premiums (26.5%), before the insurance even does anything.  I know of very few people making $30,000 a year who could feasibly use 26.5% of their income on unexpected expenses. They must avoid going to the hospital at all costs. The insurance is essentially useless to them. So they pay the penalty, which is again useless to them.  So essentially lower-middle class people are putting money into the system to make it affordable for upper-middle and the very poor eligible for medicaid."

personalfinance,3dyc61,pfthrow327,5,Mon Jul 20 23:44:48 2015 UTC,I would add her then keep the card yourself.  It helps her and gives you peace of mind.
personalfinance,3dyc61,cryoclasm,4,Mon Jul 20 20:06:16 2015 UTC,Tell her to look into the discover IT card. That's how I started to build my credit.
personalfinance,3dyc61,nutswing,4,Mon Jul 20 18:50:40 2015 UTC,"I was in pretty much the same situation as your GF, got through college without any loans, paid cash for my car, and so had nothing in my credit history. My girlfriend added me as an AU to one of her credit cards, which we (both) use exclusively for shared expenses: utilities, groceries, gas, etc. I checked credit karma after a few months and my score was in the mid 700s, which let me get my own card for personal expenses. We'd been dating for 3 or 4 years and living together for a year and a half or so before doing this, marriage is still a few years out I think but for us it made a lot of sense to partially combine finances this way.  Obviously most of the posters here are being super risk averse, but you know your girlfriend, and her spending habits, better than anyone else here, so if you trust her then this is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. Sure, she could go nuts with it, but she could also sell all of your shit on craiglist since you live together and she has easy access to it. I assume you trust her to do neither.  It sounds like you've thought it through, and especially if she won't even have a card, I don't think you have anything to worry about."
personalfinance,3dyc61,c_ronic,7,Mon Jul 20 19:53:53 2015 UTC,I want to give a counter opinion to the general consensus here. I am in a similar situation and have my gf on my amex blue cash. Not sure if it works with quicksilver but on the amex Ive set a limit on the amount she can spend. I am also able to track all her expenses on my account. At the end of every month I look at how much she spent let her pay that amount and I pay my part on the card.   Now worst case if something happened the maximum amount I could lose is her not paying off her monthly total (couple hundred) and I simply pay it off. A couple hundred is worth it to me to help her out.   Thus there is no way the card isn't paid off at the end of the month and she can also never put more on it than I would feel comfortable losing.  Although from her perspective she needs to be sure that she can trust you to pay it off every month as well. It goes both ways especially with you only having 640.  EDIT: Also earning rewards on their spend is also a nice bonus but generally only works with high limits when utilization isn't as easily reached
personalfinance,3dyc61,yodaface,3,Mon Jul 20 16:33:47 2015 UTC,"Anecdote here, but I added my fiancee to both of my credit cards, and she now has better credit than I do.

I do not see why you wouldn't do it. It worked great for us."
personalfinance,3dyc61,TheEchoFilter,4,Mon Jul 20 17:12:19 2015 UTC,Easy. Add her. Don't give her the credit card or the credit number. No risk. She will develop a credit score and won't have to do anything.
personalfinance,3dyc61,apleima2,6,Mon Jul 20 19:33:29 2015 UTC,You can make her an authorized user without actually giving her a card so there's no risk of her making charges. They'll send one in the mail but you can just cut it up.

personalfinance,3dyc61,InstantMoisture,2,Mon Jul 20 15:38:24 2015 UTC,"Some credit card companies require the SSN of the individual to add an authorized user, so it can be reported to their credit. Adding her as an AU can be a great way to help her start building credit. From there she can get another card of her own or secured card. Considering you current credit limit is higher than the maximum most secured cards allow, an AU would be a good place to start. I disagree with those that say you shouldn't give her a card. If she has never had a credit card before this can be a great way for her to learn spending responsibility and handle the spending transparently since you are the primary cardholder. You'd be doing her a disservice by adding her and not exposing her to responsibility factors when it comes to credit cards."
personalfinance,3dyc61,ThatAssholeMrWhite,4,Tue Jul 21 02:56:32 2015 UTC,"People here are assuming you will give her the extra card. The truth is, the card will be sent to your address.  Assuming you're careful with the spend on the account and making use of great utilization, leaving the account for a few years, no late payments, etc. then your girlfriend can actually benefit from this.  It will not affect your credit, however, if you screw up, this will cause her credit history to go bad. She can always take herself off of the account as an AU if she deems so. Basically, put her as an AU, but put the extra card away and never use it. You can maintain control on the expenditures but don't go overboard with it."

OP may be able to avoid that by asking Tesla to ship the car to IA where you can title it there, but OP will be responsible for sales tax in either CA or IA for sure (and maybe both, if IA doesn't recognize the tax OP already paid to CA.)"

You don't register the car in the state you purchase it, you register it in the state you will be driving it.  You don't owe sales taxes on the car until you register it, although CA may collect the registration fees for you at the time you take possession, they are required to transfer those fees to the state the car will be registered.  More likely, you will be given a 30/60 day temp registration tag for CA, which allows you to drive the car home."
personalfinance,3dx7i7,x4dm,7,Mon Jul 20 16:35:02 2015 UTC,Required by every state in the US.

It's all a racket, but I don't see it changing any time soon. The DOL does a lot of slimy things like that. When you renew your tabs in my state they tack on a bunch of ""donations"" to the bill without telling you, so if you're not savvy you'll walk out the door paying more than you needed to.

Electricity costs less than gas therefore you save money using electricity.  It's one of the big selling point about the car.  It's the same deal with hybrids.  It sounds great until you start crunching the numbers on it.
personalfinance,3dx7i7,shrodge,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:54:09 2015 UTC,"Gas isn't the only thing you would save on.  There is no transmission or drivetrain, so no oil or the lines that the fluids run through, plus less cooling because the battery is the only thing that really gets hot.. I dunno they may be worthwhile in the long run.  Anybody done an ROI?"
personalfinance,3dx7i7,BurnedOut_ITGuy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:00:00 2015 UTC,They've done the math on hybrids and they're not worth it.  I really doubt electric cars are going to be much different.  Gas just isn't expensive enough that you're going to regain anything in a hurry.  Same with the various fluids you put in your car.

personalfinance,3dx7i7,jerlasvegas,7,Tue Jul 21 13:32:06 2015 UTC,"I won a car in California in 2007.  I live in Nevada.  I only had to pay Federal Income Tax on the full purchase price of the car (that the people giving away the car had paid).  I did not have to pay either Sales Tax or California State Income Tax.  The full purchase price of the car is sent to the IRS in a 1099 form so it will be treated as additional income and depending on your income, you will be responsible for paying the income tax.  In addition, because it is a large sum of money, you may be required to pay the income tax at the end of the quarter via EFTPS, but you can ask the IRS about it.  Either way you will definitely have to pay the bill by April 15 of next year.    Fortunately the car I won was only $31K, but even at that point, had I wanted to sell it back to the dealer they only wanted to give me $21K for it.  I kept the car and found a way to pay the income tax.  Hopefully you can do the same."

If you don't have the cash, then ask the dealer for cash equivalency, pay the tax out of that, and enjoy your paid off bills, emergency fund, degree, etc. If they don't do cash equivalency, maybe they'll sell the car for you?

Well, I don't know how much the taxes would be, but it looks like the Reddit hive mind has converged on $30-40k.    I have no experience with this, but I'd like to offer a suggestion:  Talk to your bank.  Explain the situation to a loan officer, and see if they will extend you a loan (that you can afford!) for the taxes on the car.  Offer the car as collateral, just as though you were purchasing the car for this price.  Offer to sell your existing car (if this is feasible) to pay into the loan.  See what they say.  You might get lucky and walk out of there with a loan offer.  They certainly won't approve you if you never ask.  If that fails, try the same pitch at other banks.    If, ultimately, nobody bites (it is a long shot), take the cash."

personalfinance,3dycb4,megafartcloud,3,Mon Jul 20 18:45:55 2015 UTC,"Just some encouragement from a guy who graduated with a liberal arts degree.  First, don't stress it. Some of the most famous and influential people in the world got their undergrad in liberal arts. Second, if you can write, you can do anything. Every company in the world needs people whose written correspondence makes sense. Every company in the world has need for people who can succinctly make a point. Every company in the world can use people whose critical thinking is not entirely devoted to maths or coding. So while not every company in the world may have a space for YOU, you can rest assured that you can find a company that does have space.   Here's my personal experience if you like. I graduated with a degree in english, focused on creative writing. Took some time off after graduating to travel and pursue some random interests, and when I was done, decided to enjoy a job working with dogs. When my expenses started to get too much for that low pay, I decided to put my education to work. I quit my job, got licensed as a cheaufer to do some peddicabbing as financial insurance so to speak, and I signed on with a temp agency. I held out on their jobs until they had a position that fit my interests (copy writing/editing for a web marketing firm). I did a good job and stayed ahead of the work they had, and after the short week they had originally brought me on for, they asked me to stay longer. eventually this turned into a full time position (I switched roles, but that was my choice, now I'm doing media planning which doesn't involve much writing). Regardless, despite the time I took off and all the other considerations, it was my degree that got me in the door, and I find every day that what I learned for liberal arts has helped me daily.   So whether you decide to continue pursuing liberal arts, or if you choose another path, don't stress it too much. You can always find something to do for somebody willing to pay you, and if you're patient, you can find that dream job (or at least the job that leads to it).   Keep going and never ever let your doubts or concerns take you out of the game. you can do it.   Edit: two words, one period."

Many people will tell you a million reasons why taking a car loan out when you're in college is a terrible idea, but the TL;DR here is really  don't count your ducks before they hatch. Don't bet on a $12k Acura being reliable for 5 years. Don't bet on you getting a good score on GRE when you have 4 semesters in and don't know what you're doing in school. Don't bet on you being able to find a job with a masters degree if and when you graduate.   And most important of all - just be thankful that you and your parents are healthy and are financially able for now. Even a few thousands in loan will set you back for many years if you don't have your health to finish your school/work or whatever.

And since you've identified what is driving (no pun intended) your need to get a new car, you can take a step back and analyze the situation with a cool and rational head. Those euphoric feelings that come with sitting in the driver's seat of a new car, feeling the steering wheel, imagining owning this vehicle that you deserve--those feelings are only temporary and will be more than outlived by the horror that is a huge loan hanging over your head.   You know what feels better than taking out a loan and owning a new car you can't afford? Feeling like you've handled your money in a responsible manner and 'beat' the weird social pressure to finance a new vehicle so many people in this country succumb to. That feeling will last as long as the car does.   So, try to be as rational and practical about this as possible (and you've already done the first step--identifying the emotional triggers that are influencing you to finance). If your current car has more life in it, keep driving it until it's been run into the ground. If it costs more to repair than buying a more reliable (but still cheap) used car, you need to start looking at craigslist, etc. I was in the market for a used car myself and there were definitely decent ~10 year old models for less than $3k. Do your research and get a model with good reliability scores. There's no guarantee any car (new or used) won't have problems but you can use the power of statistical probability to reduce the odds you'll be stuck with something needing expensive repairs.   I know it's paradoxical, but if you don't have the money to pay for a new car in full you shouldn't think about financing. Financing can be useful in theory but too often just keeps poor people poor. The only thing someone in this situation should focus on is keeping costs as low as possible while still having something that will serve as safe (but not necessarily comfortable) transport. Good luck OP!"

personalfinance,3dy9lq,Kahnarble,2,Mon Jul 20 15:13:27 2015 UTC,makes sense. I just had a friend give me advice to not aggressively pay off student loans but instead put that money into an interest-earning savings acc.   Seemed very counter intuitive to bear the weight of the student loans for longer
personalfinance,3dy9lq,clutchied,3,Mon Jul 20 15:49:52 2015 UTC,if someone tells you to save your money in a savings account and it's not for an emergency fund you should ignore any other financial advice they give you.
personalfinance,3dy9lq,Kahnarble,5,Mon Jul 20 16:42:18 2015 UTC,"It's counter intuitive because that advice is usually wrong. Paying off your student loans is like getting a guaranteed return of whatever the interest rate is. So for you it looks something like:   401k: Your company is matching you up to X, so that's basically getting a 100% return on that money (assuming you stay long enough for the vesting to kick in). High student loans: 7-9% guaranteed Investing: 7% return (not guaranteed) Lower student loans: 4.66% guaranteed   So for you the most efficient route is to max out the company match, pay as much as you can to the highest interest student loan until it's gone and pay minimums on the others. Once the 7-9% interest rate loans are gone, then you can consider if investing for a higher but not guaranteed return is worth the lower interest rates carrying for longer."
personalfinance,3dy9lq,humidifier_man,2,Mon Jul 20 15:56:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know about the US, but in Canada you can deduct interest on student loans for tax purposes, so your effective interest rate is lower. We are going to pay minimums on my girlfriend's loans (already a really really low rate) until we have a house, since we are basically paying almost nothing in interest when you consider inflation. The payments themselves are small enough that it's not a problem either."
personalfinance,3dy9lq,JollyJoshHalo,9,Mon Jul 20 16:39:58 2015 UTC,"The max amount of interest you can claim is $2,500 and if you are under that $60,000 tax bracket that could save you a max of $375.  The idea of dragging out student loan debt to save money on taxes is not a good one.  If you have a 6% rate on $60,000 loans you owe $3,600 each year in interest. As you can see savings a max of $375 by dragging out paying off your student loan is pretty unproductive.."
personalfinance,3dy9lq,humidifier_man,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:43:10 2015 UTC,"I forget sometimes how much student debt most people have. We are very lucky as the debt is under $9000 and the interest rate is very low (less than 5%). We are not doing it for the purpose of saving on taxes, I just meant that the tax savings effectively lowers the interest rate so that may change your calculations somewhat if you are in a similar situation (living in a shitty apartment, trying to have a second child so want a house ASAP, and we aren't in very much debt; her student loan is all that's left so it is not a priority to pay that off at this point in our lives.)   edit- to further clarify, in our situation, the effective interest rate after tax savings is about 3.5% (I'm estimating because I don't have immediate access to her account or anything), so after factoring in inflation, it is a very very tiny savings to pay it off, which we discussed for a while, and decided that putting that money towards a house would be a better quality of life investment than the few hundred dollars we would save over the next few years.   I should have been more specific that this is not generally applicable financial advice but just that it is another variable to consider in some cases if the decision is very close."
personalfinance,3dy9lq,JollyJoshHalo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:05:17 2015 UTC,"It is definitely situational and based on each persons risk preference. I have about $26k in student loans, $18k of which are at 6.55%. To me isolating and paying these off is my number one priority after an emergency fund. Getting a house or a new car while I have $18k in loans at 6.55% isn't an option."

personalfinance,3dy9lq,Kahnarble,2,Mon Jul 20 18:25:42 2015 UTC,"I'm incredibly horrible at visualizing and doing math, can you explain why/how to arrive at the 60k number?"
personalfinance,3dy9lq,RumRations,2,Mon Jul 20 20:41:14 2015 UTC,"It basically works like this:  If you make up to $65,000, you can deduct all the interest you paid on your student loans that year, up to $2500.   If you make over $80,000, you can't deduct any student loan interest.   Between $65k and 80k, the amount you can deduct is on a sliding scale.   So let's say you make $50,000 and pay $600 in loan interest in a year. You can deduct the full $600.  Which probably ends up having about a ~$100 effect on the amount of taxes you owe. (Super rough estimate).   Let's say you make $50,000 and pay $6,000 in student loan interest. You can only deduct $2500 from your taxes. And it probably saves you about ~$500 instead. (Again, super rough estimate)"

personalfinance,3dy9lq,nmacholl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:32:35 2015 UTC,It would make sense if your interest rates were lower than the average rate of returns but even then investing is not a guarantee where paying your loans off is.
personalfinance,3dy9lq,ja1484,3,Mon Jul 20 21:37:52 2015 UTC,"What is your timeline for paying off the loans?  It often makes sense to invest at lower interest rates than the APR on loans if the investment horizon is long (like retirement) and the payoff horizon on the loans is short (couple years).  In gross dollar terms, 45 years of 6% compounded is way way more than 3 years of 9%.  So this plays a role. It tends to restrict near-term cashflow a bit though, which can be more important to young people than savings at times, so keep that in mind as well.  I would say invest to the point you get max 401k match and anything past that that you can allow without letting the loan repayment timeline exceed, say, 5 years. Really though, however you balance these items depends on your personal risk tolerance."

Or you could also write something in the memo like on the check itself.  Something like ""PIF (payment in full) for deletion off of credit bureaus.""

As for hassle/convenience/comfort, that doesn't have a price, so don't expect a reimbursement. IMO, losses resulting from your choices (food spoilage, gross towels) isn't the landlord's responsibility. You can try, but I wouldn't expect that to work. If that's the only costs you incurred, I personally wouldn't even bother wasting my time making an invoice."
personalfinance,3dyk3p,MyNameIsRay,2,Mon Jul 20 17:06:24 2015 UTC,"Agree. You didn't move into a brand new house, things break. The important thing is that when you bring it to the landlord's attention, he/she fixes or replaces it. I don't think you can really ask for much more than that."

personalfinance,3dyk3p,CranberryCash,2,Mon Jul 20 19:21:40 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah, they aren't supposed to do that. They can reimburse you but anything that affects rent is supposed to go to all residents.   What they likely did is gave you a credit of $200 on your account and applied it to that months rent."
personalfinance,3dyk3p,CranberryCash,3,Mon Jul 20 19:26:49 2015 UTC,Oh right. Yes that's what they did
personalfinance,3dyk3p,CranberryCash,2,Mon Jul 20 19:46:21 2015 UTC,"So the most you could ask for is a credit on your account. However, to be completely honest I'm not sure why you think you're entitled to one.  It seems like the landlord has responded to all of your issues as quickly as possible. So, why exactly are you upset? Not trying to be antagonistic, I'm just honestly curious.  Also, the toilet is probably not an issue of it being bolted down, but an issue with the initial construction. Sometimes the pipe is made too high so the toilet doesn't sit on the floor properly, that's more of an aesthetic issue than anything that's a serious problem."
personalfinance,3dyk3p,Reset108,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:37:41 2015 UTC,"I don't exactly feel entitled to a credit on our account. I am just curious.  Since other places have done it for much less. They have responded quickly to our issues, which is great. I don't want to discredit that at all. I'm honestly just curious. I don't want ruin a landlord/tenant relationship so I am trying to be sure before I do it if I take any action. As for the toilet it did have to be sealed and fixed, which took some time.  They believe it may be what was causing the first leak into my sons bedroom."

Your landlord has already replaced or fixed all the issues you were having and in a timely manner. Think of the costs you would have incurred had you owned the home, instead the landlord is rafting these costs so you don't have to, which is the point of renting.   I just think it would tacky to ask considering that your landlord seemed very reasonable about fixing these things.  Just my two cents."

personalfinance,3dyk3p,CranberryCash,3,Mon Jul 20 16:53:00 2015 UTC,"My opinion: Did the landlord replace these things for you, or did you have to pay out of pocket? If you paid out of pocket, then yes- you should talk to your landlord about cutting you a break with the rent. If you did not, go with the understanding that you moved into an older home, be happy your landlord is decent and did the repairs you requested/required, and pay your rent..."

You also have a LOT of debt. That 260k student loan is massive. A bank is going to be hesitant to lend you a whole lot as  result because a good chunk of your income is needed to service it.

You are probably going to have a hard time getting a mortgage anyway with a car or not. If you can rent a decent place for $650 a month, keep doing that for a few years while you kill those student loans then consider a house.

Don't count on a lender being willing to do this though.   Anything tax related on this? Let's say we pay 5k, can we take 5k off what we owe in taxes?

Once the money goes to the school, after the direct costs (tuition, room and board) are covered the excess amount borrowed is refunded to the borrower's bank account on file which is very easy to do for a Parent PLUS loan without the college student's knowledge since the student isn't involved in borrowing the money.  Ideally these funds should be used for living expenses for the student (rent, food) as well as books and things like that but sometimes people for whatever reason use the money for other things.   If it's a legitimate emergency then it's possible that the parents had to do what they did. They still have to pay the money back though."

No one is going to reduce that if you have an ability to pay. You'd likely have to file for bankruptcy before they even talk about reducing principal. They are going to make you ride that out.

Is there any sort of list or people in a similar position to me who have gone through Sofi? I'm just curious what kind of interest rate they would offer.  Do they also have the auto pay feature so I can chop off another .25%? Also I pay my loan through myGreatLakes and the loan amount is currently still in it's 'grace' period (Although collecting interest). I see I can pay the money as a refund (And immediatly reduce the current principle) which even though the loan will capitalize later still means I can reduce the interest amount so the overall value of the future principle is lower than if I paid interest first and then principle. Does Sofi offer something like that?

By refunds, do you mean tax refunds? Your parents could use their tax refunds on anything.  Taxes don't work the way you are hoping they work. Your student loans in your name may be deductible for the interest paid up to a certain dollar amount and there is an income threshold. If you are opting to pay the loans in your parents name, that money is a gift. If you give them more than 14,000 you will owe gift taxes. they can deduct the interest they pay if they meet the income criteria for their loans. The way to fix this was to pick a less expensive school, but that point is moot."
personalfinance,3dyld7,deathby1337,3,Mon Jul 20 18:02:20 2015 UTC,"By refunds I mean the loan would give some amount and then that amount would be paid into the school but the school would not need all the money so they would give a lot of it back.    Yes it's my fault, but now it's not something that can be changed.   I know that Student loans have a forgiveness plan where if you pay on time for 10 years you can get the rest of the debt forgived in good faith. Does PLUS loan have anything similar?"

personalfinance,3dyld7,JoeClarksville,4,Mon Jul 20 18:20:27 2015 UTC,"No, your debt would be half of what they took out. And even then, it truly would no be your responsibility, as these loans are not in your name. If they died, you should not agree to creditors to pay them as they would die with the estate.

personalfinance,3dyld7,QuickLightning,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:31:59 2015 UTC,"They did not get any cars and did not make any large changes to the house. But the way you approach it makes sense, if the loans had been paid based on what I see on the loan financial page (Adding up all the given loans and subtracting all the refund values) I should right now have a $69k principle with interest bringing that up to roughly $78k by now.   I can't say anything about that now, I'll get to the bottom of this and then figure out what exactly I'm 'morally' obligated to owe (Legally I know I owe $0).  Do you know if PLUS loans have some sort of forgiveness plan based on paying it back over some time? Normal student loans have forgiveness if you basically pay in good faith.

personalfinance,3e1ij5,unrlmth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:17:08 2015 UTC,"The student loans are back-burner. If you're interested:   7/13 - PER - $1,432 5.00% 6/13 - DSU - $2,119 6.55% 6/13 - DSS - $5,465 3.15% 9/12 - DSU - $2,235 6.55% 9/12 - DSS - $5,464 3.15% 9/11 - DSU - $2,368 6.55% 9/11 - DSS - $4,395 3.15% 8/10 - DSU - $2,524 6.55% 8/10 - DSS - $3,429 4.25%   DSS = subsidized, DSU = unsubsidized, PER = perkins. The $89 loan payment is towards a PLUS loan my mom took out for me, so I don't have that information readily available, but I pay it.   They're back-burner because my student debt is about $40k, and I'm going to grad school in about a year. I can defer my loans again while in grad school, and I will (hopefully) be making much more than I am now, once I get my PhD. I won't make enough between now and going back to school to vanquish them, without at least sacrificing my savings. And I'd like to have a savings while in grad school. So the strategy with them is to make the minimums for now, and re-evaluate before I quit working and enroll in grad school.  It's a STEM grad program, no tuition, and I get a stipend. Not bad, but it's a significant pay cut."

I'm going to make a guess here, I have been interviewing for employees recently there is a massive lack of ""soft skills"", look at this. You written english is a bit sloppy and uses slang. Do you speak like that ?  When you interview do you shake hands, look people in the eye ? Do you appear to have enough energy to even to stand, doesn't matter if you are tired, fake it for a few minutes ? I live in the south, people can barely be bothered to pick up their feet to walk, open their mouth to pronounce a word.

You could see which credit report looks ok, freeze one or two of the other ones, and focus any apps on companies that pull from that one or can be asked to pull from that one.  Example:  You freeze experian (most cards pull from this) and equifax. Transunion stays open. Now you'd have to double check but let's say Barclays only pulls from transunion. You get one or two cards from them. Amex refuses so you skip them. You skip chase since they won't approve you anyway. But you manage to get citi to give you one card and bank of america another.  Then you chill and wait for equifax or experian to look better, then freeze transunion and unfreeze one or both of the others.  However, your shopping cart trick is something I've heard about in other ways but never with credit cards so I will research as I am curious."

That will probably save a couple hundred each month.  2) Consolidate the CC debt into a home equity loan, personal loan, or 401k loan. 401k loan should really be the option of last resort, but it's still better than continuing to pay high CC rates on such a large balance.  3) Better budgeting. $70k is a great salary. If you cut out unnecessary expenses you can probably squeeze out a few hundred per month. Phone can be downsized, cable nixed, shop for cheaper insurance products, limiting take out, etc.  The question I'd try to address first, though, is how did this even happen?

If he can show you in plain writing that you have to pay for the middle month, do it, otherwise don't. If he threatens anything, tell him to fuck off.   They will likely still sell your 'debt' to a collections agency, and they will serve you with a letter giving you an opportunity to fight the collection. Ask them for legal proof that you owe the money, and agree that on receiving this you will be happy to pay the fees.

I agree that the site design is atrocious.  I bet the treasury had some grant money or something back in 2009 that they spent on this site.  Then they never spent another dime on updating it or making it look pretty in the following 6 years.

personalfinance,3dzxxi,samllr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:01:24 2015 UTC,"Hi - Did they mention getting you into some new investments?  Typically, most reputable companies won't charge you to transfer money over to them.  What's probably happening here is some advisor is looking to make a transaction on your money - they don't make any money otherwise.  This doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad idea or bad investment, though most people will tell you that you can do this on your own with Vanguard.    This is most likely a load fee, meaning that yes, it will be a 1 time fee.  That said, you'll probably then pay 1% per year.  If you're investing in loaded mutual funds then 3.5% on 100k is fair, though again - many would say avoid that completely and head over to Vanguard.  If you want someone to manage it and not have it tempt/bother/confuse you then I suppose it might be a good option for you.  Reinvesting seems like a good idea.  Yes, you can roll it to another firm, but changing investments would cost money.  Ex: Say you're in a Franklin Templeton fund and you want to invest in a Nationwide fund.  You'll likely have to pay a load fee again.  Anything within that Franklin Templeton family, however, should be fair game.  I'm not sure on a Core Investment Vehicle, but the mix sounds decent.  If you're young you should be willing to skew more towards risk provided it comes with higher expected returns.  This might come in the form of less in bonds and more in emerging markets."

The mutual funds that you are in are required to pass a certain amount of their capital gains onto their shareholders (you).

personalfinance,3dz6ns,pcglue,2,Mon Jul 20 18:46:45 2015 UTC,"If you sold your house for $550K, you might end up with about $135K in your pocket, after paying off the $385K mortgage and real estate fees of $30K.  Invest that $135K in a mutual fund, and if you happen to get a 9% return, then you'd make $12,150 in a year.  If you keep the house, then your equity may increase in two ways.  First, of your $1800 monthly payment, some of that will be paying down the loan principal.  Without knowing the specifics of your loan, I'm going to guess that of your $1800 payment, about $1200 is going to interest and $600 is going to principal.  So in a year, you'll gain $7,200 in equity by paying down the principal.  Secondly, if home values increase by 3%, then you'll also gain $16,500 in equity (3% of $550K).  Add those together with your $58 x 12 cash flow, and you'd make $24,396 in a year.  No one knows what will happen in the stock market or the real estate market over the next year, but the 9% and 3% figures above are decent historical averages.  I'd say that as long as you're ok with being a landlord, then keeping the house is a good investment."

My advice to you is to number crunch everything. Don't just post your numbers on here and expect someone else to do it. Create a spreadsheet of the costs, interest, etc of each scenario. Decide what each situation entails (the risk of an earthquake, for example; the risk of bad tenants, what will happen to the rental market when millenials buy homes, the opportunity costs of not taking advantage of other investments, what kind of investment YOU want).  For us, it makes sense to either rent out or sell because we have both the tax-free capital gains and a low interest mortgage benefiting us. It's not an exceptional investment but it's OK. We might just rent it out for 3 years after we move and then sell it so we can take advantage of both capital gains and the low interest mortgage and 3 years of possible appreciation.  Since you're in the same boat (the same region) and in a similar situation, I'd say just do the calculations and make a decision but there's no way you're going to get rich off of this.

So the first step is a transfer or deposit from my checking account into the IRA. At that point it's just sitting in a money market account in cash. Then I purchase whatever funds I want. Right now I just buy more of whatever I'm under allocated in to re-balance. Later on you can just sell shares and that money will return to the money market account where you can buy something else.  I only buy ETFs without transaction fees. So as long as I hold the fund for more than I think 60 days (honestly don't remember), it's free.  The fee structure will vary depending on the fund and the broker. Someone around here should know the Vanguard direct costs off the top of their head though.

But if you want to you can, there is no need to keep them forever.  Ultimately a basic broker can do what the elp's can, the elp provides advice in top of it.  I haven't used one beyond a initial hello though.  Others can probably provide more of a review.  But this is long term, common sense and reading the past 12 pages will give you the majority of the advice the elp can give you.  It requires work.

For example, this sub is very biased towards doing it yourself to avoid 'unnecessary' fees and lower expense ratios. That doesn't mean that is always the right approach.

Edit: they probably have a darn good version of his signature. It's one of those skills most mom's have even if they aren't fraudsters.   That is funny because they don't ask for a signature for any of this.  What they may have is recorded phone conversations proving it wasn't him on the line, but even then, you are not required to talk to anyone to open a credit card.  The company makes it easy to open credit to the point they can't prove  you were the one who opened an account in your name.

personalfinance,3dvuax,rxsda1,51,Sun Jul 19 23:36:26 2015 UTC,"She probably stole his first and moved on to you after his credit got too bad.   Edit: I'd report this to the cops unless you KNOW that she will fix this. You almost certainly do not know this.  Edit 2: Given that your parents are losing their home, what is your mom really doing to protect you and your brother? If you were only person at risk it might be okay to try to pay this off yourself. You need to think about your brother (and maybe your dad too).   Be strong!"
personalfinance,3dvuax,ikarka,34,Sun Jul 19 23:41:17 2015 UTC,"I would be inclined to speak to a lawyer before doing anything, especially given these new details; we are probably not just talking about $20,000. There are a lot of possible consequences here for you, your parents and your special needs brother, whether you do something or not."
personalfinance,3dvuax,JoeTony6,9,Sun Jul 19 23:45:34 2015 UTC,This. Many lawyers will offer free consultations.

They can be really helpful.  It is reasonable to want to preserve the relationship with your family, and some decent legal advice could really help you examine your options."
personalfinance,3dvuax,Stromtini,3,Sun Jul 19 23:51:06 2015 UTC,"This is what my brother did. He hit my mom for a little bit, but her credit sucked. Then he hit my other brother for quite a bit. Then he went to jail.   Shocker, less than 6 months after getting out of jail and my mom letting him move back home, he hit me. I'm 99% certain my parents left my FAFSA/old W-2 information unlocked in the house, which he used to open and get access to my accounts. I was 20 and attending school out of state.   It made it easier that I hated the guy already, so pressing charges was a no-brainer. The money from my bank accounts was resolved quickly, but it took a good 2-3 months to get the opened credit cards and other nonsense closed. I demanded every bit of personal information from my careless parents and they haven't had any sensitive information of mine ever since."
personalfinance,3dvuax,FinibusBonorum,23,Sun Jul 19 23:56:19 2015 UTC,"Ah, I don't want to completely tip you off but I do want to give you a heads up and worst case scenario. About ten years ago my aunt was doing something similar to her kids. Well, when the kids became adults, and push came to shove, nobody filed charges. Guess what. One Foreclosure and a bankruptcy later, she commits insurance fraud and plays with some fire. Unfuckingfortunately some homeless had been camping/living in their woods.. One died, one was injured. My point here is that you're not sure where she will stop. At what point will the metaphorical line be moved to some serious shit.    You only have one set of parents, but sit them down and discuss it with them. Enroll your other family members that you care about into credit monitoring programs and monitor their credit for them until they are able to themselves. Work something out with your mom concerning the 15k, and if she refuses or simply can't, then let her know that you have no choice but to turn her in. She can't afford it. You can't afford it. And most of all she needs help."
personalfinance,3dvuax,SmokeySmurf,14,Mon Jul 20 00:00:16 2015 UTC,"It's all well and good for you to say ""I couldn't call the cops on her and possibly send her to jail, she's my mother!""  But it's fair to point out, she should have thought ""I couldn't steal his identity and load up credit card debt in his name, he's my son!""  EDIT: Also remember, that although you're in a terrible situation having to decide this, she is the one who put you in this situation. She knew the whole time what position you would be in, and decided to take the actions she did anyway."
personalfinance,3dvuax,rxsda1,0,Mon Jul 20 00:02:52 2015 UTC,Call your brother right now and ask if he's aware. Ask him to check his own credit report. He needs to know. He needs to have chance to act.
personalfinance,3dvuax,SoundBearier,4,Mon Jul 20 15:30:20 2015 UTC,That's jumping the gun a little.  He can do a credit check on his brother too but I wouldn't immediately assume she did that.
personalfinance,3dvuax,SoundBearier,9,Mon Jul 20 02:10:28 2015 UTC,1: Wouldn't running a credit check on the brother require his permission?   2: I would assume that she probably stole the special needs kid's ID first. It's much less likely that the theft would be discovered. If it were me I would assume the worst until I had evidence to the contrary.
personalfinance,3dvuax,pentium4borg,2,Mon Jul 20 13:25:51 2015 UTC,"If you had to put money on it, you know you'd put it on her having already done it to the brother. C'mon."
personalfinance,3dvuax,SoundBearier,0,Mon Jul 20 15:47:30 2015 UTC,100% certain she did this before she did it to OP. The brother will likely never need his own credit. The situation is almost certainly worse than it already appears.

Either you eat the debt and pay it off or you file a police report and contest the bill.

Obviously she is a con artist / fraudster and is willing to do it to her own son for whatever high she needed to get. (Drugs, Clothes, a car ... buying things you want but don't need feeds you a rush)  I would have to say the relationship is pretty horrible if she defrauded you out of 15,000$ dollars. Much less this makes you an enabler for 2 reasons. 1. Allowing her to do so in the first place. 2. Not reporting all those credit cards as fraud, freezing everything and calling the cops.  What you need to do is Freeze every account you have, call everything as fraud . Contact the police and let them know what has been going on. After she has been found guilty and be sentenced to prison, turn around and begin a new chapter with your life BECAUSE you need to take care of number 1, yourself."

My advice is to wait it out with your parents for a while and hope for the best. Go to both of your parents if you can and talk to them about it together if that is an option and you trust that your dad won't make things worse.  They should be willing to make this right.  This really comes down to what kind of relationship you have with your parents.  This is a terribly unfortunate position that you are in... but let me say this: much worse happened to me financially and I dug myself out of it in a matter of two years. I don't want to be specific but this is by no means something that you can't recover from.  Sending your mom to jail on the other hand could really mess with your head depending on your history together.  My advice: give your parents time to fix this after you freeze your credit and stop this from happening."
personalfinance,3dvuax,pentium4borg,9,Mon Jul 20 16:07:36 2015 UTC,OP's mother committed a felony against OP and you're trying to make OP feel guilty if he reports it?  Come on.

Then that's a personal issue on your end. Just because you're unable to make the correct decision in your case doesn't mean OP should make the same mistake.   Tell me, what dollar amount of theft would prompt you to put your own mother into jail?   If my parents committed identity theft in order to steal from me, I would report the fraudulent activity. If the authorities decide to take further action based on that report, then that's what happens including possible jail time. You're still framing this conversation as though the potential victim (me, in this scenario) would be the one ""causing"" the offender to go to jail. That's absolutely wrong. The offender's own behavior is what caused them to go to jail.  Don't blame the victim, and don't give OP bad advice just because you're also unwilling to do the correct thing in your own personal situation."

OP is not playing a game. OP's mother seems likely to be a large part of OP's support network and OP is probably living at home if she is managing OP's finances.

If you really want to get emotionless about that, OP should think about how much OP's home, emotional support network and care provided to OP's brother as well as whatever else OP's mom does for OP is worth to OP.

Its not your fault this happened, don't blame yourself for not being completely versed in personal credit, I certainly wasn't when I was your age. Similarly, do not be mad at yourself for trusting your parents, that is a pretty natural thing to do.   You're right to take control of your finances and I would definitely describe this as fraud. But I'd caution you against having too extreme of a reaction, ~$20k is a lot of money, but I don't know if its enough money to ruin your relationship with you parents. Calling the police might do that.  I doubt your parents are going to have a ~$20k tax return next month, so don't plan for that to happen.

It sounds like your family is in a tough spot financially, but your mother as a grown adult should have thought of all that before she stole your identity and committed several felonies with it. Depending on her record and the location in which the case is tried, she may only get probation as punishment. But if you let her get away with this, I shudder to think of what might come next. What if she keeps doing it? What if she steals your disabled brother's information next? How will this affect your own credit when you grow up and want to buy a house or car, but can't because she's racked up all this debt in your name?   Family is family, but she should have thought of that before she so gravely stole from her own child."

The correct thing to do is report is as fraudulent. Because it is.  If you get a job to pay off this debt, your mother learns that she can steal from you and you will not only not report it, but let her get away with it.

You must contact the authorities immediately regarding this debt. I highly doubt that if you pay off debt that isn't even yours for your mother that she will stop, why would she?

personalfinance,3dvuax,poweruser11,18,Mon Jul 20 08:01:50 2015 UTC,"I had an extremely similar situation with my mother. I was in the same boat - my mom typically took care of everything financially. When I turned 18 I took a few credit cards out, but spent too much and didn't trust myself, so I had my mom lock them away for safe keeping.  Flash forward a year or two when I wise up a bit about finances and run my credit report, turns out my mom had been using them herself, and also taking out some accounts in my name.  (Interestingly, there was a home depot account and a brand new bathroom in my mother's house... no idea how that happened...)  When I first found out, I was of course upset - and still being young and dumb, I called up every account and cancelled them all. But, also like you, I said ""How can I put my mother in jail? How can I do that?"" I knew why she did the things she did - I knew that my step-dad was a mentally abusive alcoholic. I knew that she hid the debt from him. Plus, I had two brothers where are much younger than I. So I sucked it up.  I spent the next few years dealing with calls from creditors, paying what I could, and working three jobs while being a full-time student - but I never really made a big dent in the debt.   After finishing college, I still had about 10k in credit card debt, and not a lot of job prospects - and then my student loans came due. So   most of my pay went towards trying to make payments to the creditors and also my loans. After college,  I was working two jobs, seven days a week and living in low income housing with two friends. I felt like I was drowning every single day.  I ended up getting a job teaching ESL in South Korea, and ignored the credit card debt until it fell off my report. I've been here five years now, and the last bit of it will fall off next month.  I have finally begun rebuilding my credit - my credit rose above 700 for the first time three months ago.  I have paid off a substantial amount of my loans, I have over 15k saved, most of it invested (due to Korea being an awesome, awesome place to earn and save money.) But it has been a very difficult and stressful journey.   You need to ask yourself now if you value your relationship with your mother more than you value the next seven-ten years of your life. While I feel that I turned my lemons into lemonade - I also missed out on a lot of opportunities. I had the chance to study abroad in Europe, but I couldn't do it because I couldn't afford it. My friends went on a cross-country road trip after college, but I couldn't do it - because all of my money that I earned working three jobs during college went into the money pit my mother had created.  Unpaid internships in my field were not an option for me.   If I could go back....I'm still not sure what I would do. On the one hand, I'd possibly be putting my mother in jail. On the other hand, I wouldn't have to had miss out on any ""20-something"" experiences.   I did speak about this situation to my mother a few years ago. I told her that if she did to my younger brothers (age 16 and 17 now) what she did to me - I WOULD convince them to call the police and file fraud charges. She cried a lot after that, but agreed.   Good luck with whatever you decide.   EDIT: Some spelling mistakes."

Contact each credit card company where a line of credit was opened without your knowledge via certified mail. Send letters explaining the debt is not yours and you did not open the accounts. They will probably send you affidavits to sign -- included in the affidavit will be a line asking if you know who opened the accounts. This is a legal document and you could dig yourself into more trouble if you're not honest. Do not lie. Put her name on the form.

Perhaps you can do something that will satisfy both your mind and heart: have your mother sign a statement that she opened these accounts in your name without your permission and knowledge. Make sure that the accounts are listed. Also be sure that it states that you reserve the right to go to the authorities and/or take her to court at any time-- even after the statute of limitations has expired. Also state that if at any time in the future, she accesses your or your brother's credit/finances, you will go straight to the authorities with the info and press charges.  It's not ideal, but it's somewhere in the middle. It'll be uncomfortable, but you have to protect yourself and your brother. At least this way, you aren't reporting her right away & if she agrees to sign the paper in front of a notary public, you will feel a little bit better knowing that she's owning up to it. Sorry you're in this situation."

personalfinance,3dz432,whiteraven4,5,Mon Jul 20 18:31:06 2015 UTC,"It exists. Mastercard and American Express offer especially lucrative reward programs through Upromise and Fidelity. In addition to diverting your rewards into the 529, some cards (like Amex) will put an additional 1.5% of every purchase into the plan. I never carry a credit card balance, and this would be in addition to independent contributions into the 529, so it seemed like a no-brainer."

personalfinance,3e0zqc,dtrainmcclain,2,Tue Jul 21 03:05:16 2015 UTC,You'll need to compare your 401k funds with the choices in your IRA.  Typically IRAs have better choices but I can't say that every time its correct.    sounds like you have a good 4% match and aren't planning to reduce it below that.  That's free money.
personalfinance,3e0zqc,redditnamehere,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:17:45 2015 UTC,"My IRA is definitely more flexible, but I've got a good assortment of funds in the 401k. I'll definitely at least keep it up to the 4% match.  Was also curious if the tax break I'd get for IRA deductions would outdo the tax bracket lowering I'd get from my pre-tax 401k contributions."
personalfinance,3e0zqc,lsh99,2,Tue Jul 21 03:22:15 2015 UTC,"This tax question is probably the first thing you really want to look at. Another thing is the fees associated with your IRA (I assume your 401K fees are pretty low).    Remember that you'll get taxed upon withdrawal for your 401K contributions (and gains), but if you are using a Roth IRA, you won't be taxed on either contributions (because they've already been taxed as income) OR gains if you wait to withdraw until the designated age (can't remember when that is... 62 1/2?).    Assuming you're reasonably young, and especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket by the time you retire, I think conventional wisdom is that you prioritize your 401K to be sure you maximize the company match, then you max your IRA, then go back to the 401K.  There are other considerations (e.g., some folks need to keep their adj. gross income low, so they max the 401K first), but generally, that's the approach."
personalfinance,3e0zqc,lsh99,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:34:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah... I guess that crystalizes it: Find out if the tax break on the IRA contribution is better/worse than the degree to which my adjusted gross income is lowered by my 11% 401k contribution.  I'm 36. I'm sure I'll be in a higher tax bracket down the road. I'm already getting my max company match, so I guess it's just about the tax difference.  Thanks for your feedback!"
personalfinance,3e0zqc,rnelsonee,2,Tue Jul 21 03:38:25 2015 UTC,"Ok, yeah, I'm around that age, too.  I think you'll find that just about everybody advises to do it how I suggested.  Some folks need to keep the AGI low for various income-based loan repayments and such, but the benefits of the Roth IRA are really too good to pass up when you're looking at 25-30 years of compounded interest."

Tendering a resignation. Only when an employee actually terminates does a qualifying event occur.   This just means that you become eligible when you're actually no longer at the job; you don't become eligible when you give your 2 weeks notice, but when you are actually no longer an employee.  COBRA is expensive, but it is easy and does the job of covering the gaps. This is exactly the sort of reason it exists - definitely use it."
personalfinance,3dvynr,fsr87,11,Mon Jul 20 01:25:53 2015 UTC,What's cool is that you have some time to do the cobra paperwork. So if you don't need to see the doctor in that thirty days you're ok. It will likely take a few weeks to get the paperwork anyway.

We did this when I was moving to a new job and was without insurance for 30 days or so. Got the cobra paperwork and hung on to it, figured we'd join up and pay the back premiums if something happened, but nothing ever did so we didn't waste the money.  I do not know how/if the ACA affected these rules, though, since it's been about five years since that happened. Read carefully before you take my internet advice and screw yourself over."

personalfinance,3dvynr,picscomment89,12,Mon Jul 20 02:08:14 2015 UTC,"COBRA is also retroactive. You can fill out the paperwork up to 60 days after termination, and it will apply retroactively to any medical expenses incurred during that time, even though you were uninsured at the time.  http://www.mymoneyblog.com/cobra-and-retroactive-health-insurance-coverage.html  Do your research before doing any uninsured rock climbing or anything, but that should still be how it works."
personalfinance,3dvynr,abuani_dev,4,Mon Jul 20 02:14:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is what usually happens because COBRA is typically really expensive. So what I would do is have your husband find out the cost. Then figure out what the out of pocket or cash cost is for what you need during the month for your pregnancy and compare. If COBRA is $1200 for the month (I'm not kidding, that is a typical family plan price that is not even that high), the sonagram and appt may be cheaper.  Then just pay cash, and leave COBRA for if you have an incident and need to re-up retroactively."
personalfinance,3dvynr,SoMuchMoreEagle,3,Mon Jul 20 13:17:03 2015 UTC,"My last job showed exactly how much I covered of my insurance and how much my company covered so there was no guessing. Just reach out to your HR rep for the company if it's not showed anywhere(I had a total compensation statement that was updated monthly and it showed how much the company was paying out of pocket for my medical coverage), and I'm sure they'd be more then willing to provide it. It's not that COBRA is expensive, it's that you're paying the price your company was paying to insure you, not the 10-20% depending on your companies policy."
personalfinance,3dvynr,flipht,2,Mon Jul 20 14:21:34 2015 UTC,Also note that you can elect COBRA with or without your husband. Election is on an individual basis.

personalfinance,3dvynr,SquanchingOnPao,3,Mon Jul 20 06:24:33 2015 UTC,"Also, if you can't get insurance for whatever reason. There are a LOT of uninsured people who get pregnant, and because of that it's one of the areas with real price competition between hospitals/doctors. Call around some,  and you'll find that cash prices are more readily available than other procedures, a couple of appointments and a sonogram shouldn't be too expensive out of pocket."
personalfinance,3dvynr,SoMuchMoreEagle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:41:40 2015 UTC,Why opt COBRA? They have an SEP on the marketplace for losing their group coverage. They can probably get a subsidy too on the market place. If their income is low enough now they can get one of the best cost sharing reductions. So it will mean lower monthly premium and little to no out of pocket costs. The cost sharing reduction applies to silver level plan so look there. Fuck Cobra

He's likely making more money than before."
personalfinance,3dvynr,SoMuchMoreEagle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:45:21 2015 UTC,But if he is the only one working and if they have children its likely their family would still qualify for something.

You can elect COBRA retroactively within the election window if you end up needing it.  Talk to your doctor. Get as much done as you can now and ask him what is the minimum during the period but still getting proper prenatal care. Don't decide on your own what you can or can't give up. Talk to a medical professional. You aren't the first pregnant woman in this situation.

It means that you can continue to be covered under your husband's employer's plan for up to 36 months. However because part of the insurance premium is no longer being covered by the employer, the premium is usually high. For the amount of time you're talking about, it is probably worth it though. Your husband needs to talk to HR at his current company about COBRA coverage for you.  These are the rules for NY but they're the same all over and this explanation is pretty clear."

They kept my original insurance on file and just told me to let them know when I got my new insurance information and they would give me a recalculation of the cost.

personalfinance,3dvynr,NetSage,2,Mon Jul 20 04:59:51 2015 UTC,"I lost my job mid-pregnancy six years ago.  I changed from my insurance to my husband's as I did not start another job.  This advice is based on that experience, with the caveat that healthcare in the US has changed a bunch since then.  First of all, most OBs charge a global fee due a certain number of weeks before your due date.  This covers all routine prenatal care, delivery, and postnatal care.  When I explained my issue with having a gap in coverage they weren't worried about it.  I did not have to skip any appointments and they were willing to move up my 20 week ultrasound because it was more advantageous to have it on the old insurance.   Second of all, pregnancy was not considered a pre-existing condition under the new insurance.   At the time there were rules about having continuing coverage and how pre-existing conditions were handled but pregnancy was exempt anyway.  The pre-existing condition rules have changed for the better since then, though.    Finally, COBRA is the option to continue your new insurance for another month and it is very expensive.  You are usually way better off paying out-of-pocket for a few appointments and prescriptions than paying for COBRA. You'll get a packet in the mail with the cost and procedures. You have 60 days to enroll if you need it.  Basically it's nice that it's there in case of a very expensive medical event but otherwise you won't need it.  From a site called cobrainsurance.com:    The 60-day period permits a qualified beneficiary to “adopt a wait-and-see approach to continued coverage, and then elect if and when medical care is required during the election period.   My last big piece of advice is to communicate with your current and new OB about the situation.  Their billing departments should be able to help you navigate this.  Congratulations on your pregnancy.  I know this is stressful but it will be just fine."

personalfinance,3dvynr,wormspeaker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:28:59 2015 UTC,"HR Benefits specialist here. You and your hubby are eligible for COBRA. COBRA premium is very expensive so here's how you buy time until his new coverage kicks in AND still have coverage for in case major stuff happens. The trick is in the paperwork but don't use that insurance unless shit goes down other wise you'd have to pay back the premium. The law gives you 60 days to make your election (sign up) then an additional 45 days from the election date to submit your premiums (back dating to the day your COBRA coverage goes in effective). Once you get the COBRA package, fill it out and hang on to it. Submit your COBRA paperwork as close to the 60th day deadline as possible. From the date they receive your COBRA election, you'll have an additional 45 days to submit your payment. That gives you a total of 105 days to buy time. If you have major services (delivery/surgery), you can use the insurance and the premium will be small compared to the service bill. If you have minor services (office visits), just pay cash. The loophole you have is the time to make your election, don't actually use it or you'll have to pay the premium. COBRA premium for 2 will easily cost you $400 - $1,000 each month depending on what coverage you carry."

Usually they have specific criteria when it comes to these things, and since you have no current income, that's a deal breaker. You could try to open another credit card, but again, they'll most likely ask you for your current income. If you put 0, they may deny you outright under than criterion (and you'd have a hard credit inquiry that can reduce your score by a few points for 6-24 months). That said, having another line of credit will help increase the average age of your credit, which is a major plus in the long run (think into the future when you may take our a car loan or mortgage; that new line of credit will not reduce your average credit age by as much). However, your score is high, so it's always work a shot. You can look into student CCs that have fewer requirements.

Some quick information: 1) College student- age 21 2) Graduating in less than 1 year, MIS and Finance degrees, expecting no less than $45k initial salary. 3) Currently, I have 1 credit card through Wells Fargo- $800 credit limit. 4) 765 credit score. 5) Debt free.

I plan to continue this habit forever, and on any future credit cards.    My issue is the $800 credit limit. Although I have never run my spending up to this limit, I have come close enough that I have had to pay off the card early. No big deal, but that not very good for my credit utilization.    Wells Fargo sent me a letter saying that I qualified for an increased limit- they offered my $1,500. When I called, and answered all of their questions, they told me that my credit score was great, and that my credit history in paying off that card was great as well, but that I was denied. The reason: I have virtually no income currently.    Here are my questions:  1) Should I try again to see if Wells Fargo will increase my credit limit? If so, when, and what should I say if they decline me again for the same reason as before? Should I threaten to close the account?  2) I plan to open a second credit card (not through Wells Fargo), but should I wait until after I have graduated, and actually have a measurable income?

personalfinance,3dy1r0,minimalkva,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:12:20 2015 UTC,"Meal planning helps a lot with this. You make a recipe with X servings and immediately divide the meal up into tupperware or batches for the freezer. Putting the leftovers away and in your fridge before you eat dinner helps you to avoid accidentally eating what would have been tomorrow's lunch. It also helps with portion control and knowing exactly how much you are eating, if you are concerned with that."

Either you have to move somebody's heavy furniture, or you cover your friend's Saturday night shift while everybody else goes out to the bar and your friend hooks up with the coworker you've been crushing on, or you think you're getting a free beer and then you wake up in a bath tub full of ice with one less kidney than you had going into it.  The question you have to ask is: which one of these opportunistic antagonists is your employer in this scenario?  In all seriousness, though, I'd have a tough time living without a kitchen. Eating out adds up fast. You can work around it though, and $600-$800/mo is quite a lot. You could afford to go out with your friends instead of having them over and buy a few rounds of drinks a couple times a month and still come out way ahead on that. And your friends probably wouldn't care a lick that it wasn't at your apartment.  Plus, if you're buying rounds at the bar, good chance you can get your friends to help you move heavy furniture, or cover your Saturday night shift so you can hook up with the coworker one of them has been crushing on, or maybe you could even score a kidney.

Find where you spend, find rewards that give you the most.  Miles vs. cash back depends on if you travel a lot/short trips/randomly.    I personally go on 1-3 trips a year and I figured its not worth having miles since my trips are for work.  Then, I decided I spend most of my $ getting food (restaurants and groceries) followed by Amazon so I got an amazon chase (3% amazon, 2% restaurant) and an amex blue (3% groceries).  Both give me 2% on gas as well.  Since I travel to foreign countries for work, I also got a capital one venture (trying to get this changed to a quicksilver - 1.25% to 1.5% increase in points) since they have zero foreign transaction fees.  -note- I didnt get any annual fee cards since I don't spend enough $ to justify the higher % rewards"

personalfinance,3dzn08,xanthela,2,Mon Jul 20 20:43:22 2015 UTC,"So I only have one Canadian client so my knowledge is a bit limited, but in general it works like this:  Because you haven't 'severed your ties' with Canada (i.e. you will come back in a couple years) you are not an emigrant, but rather a ""factual resident"" or a ""deemed nonresident.""   The former means you file Canada tax returns on all of your income, as if you lived there all year. Presumably there are credits for tax paid to other countries - that's a little out of my expertise.   The latter comes into play when (1) the country you move to has a tax treaty with Canada (the UK certainly does) and (2) you are considered a resident of the UK for tax purposes. Then you are a deemed non-resident and would file for tax year 2015 a short-year normal return with your departure date written on the 'residency information' section. A deemed non-resident follows the same rules as any nonresident - you file and pay tax on Canada-source income only.   The UK-Canada Treaty is long but you're looking at Article IV. The first question is whether you have a ""permanent abode"" in either Canada or the UK - so, do you still have your ""place"" in Canada? Then you are a resident of Canada under the treaty and a ""factual resident"" for Canada tax. If you have a permanent home in both countries, you are a resident of the one with which you have the closest economic and personal connections. If you don't have a permanent home anywhere, it's where you have a ""habitual abode"" - a definition I'm not all that clear on. Still, if you sold your house/ended your lease in Canada, and are either owning or renting in the UK, you ought to be able to consider yourself a UK resident for the time being. As such, you are a deemed nonresident of Canada (going forward) and only report income from Canada sources, with the exception of the short-year normal return for January-July 2015.   No clue on the UK-tax side. Here's a link to a relevant discussion I just googled that might help you along.   Canada Department of Revenue - Temporarily Leaving Canada"

If you go to a bar in midtown, drinks are $14 each, so if you get 5, you're up to 70, add $20 for a cover charge, and $10 for a coat check--that's a hundred.  If you want to do dinner before, that's $75 if you go to a reasonably nice place, that's $200.  You could do that every weekend and still have enough to buy some cigarettes.  That being said, if you're on a budget, you don't do that.  You go to the hole in the wall divey places where drinks are $6, you go to the bodega where Arizonas are $.99, you quit smoking.  I've been in NYC 25 years and I've never spent $900 on any single week, let alone a weekend.   But YMMV, obviously."

If the IRS wants to audit you then great, you'll get them to do the work to get that information. If they don't audit you, then at least you paid what you thought you should have.

The type I chose is ""AddsUp"", meaning that I have to:     Keep a minimum of 500 in my checking account Use my debit card for the checking account at in at least 15 transactions a month (they can be tiny ones) Deposit my primary source of income into it   I already set up my direct deposit to go into my checking account today.    What I'm trying to figure out is how to have my money for bills (that I'll budget out exactly) in one place, which will have everything auto-payed out of, plus a little money on top so it'll build a buffer for any unexpected bills. I want another place to be just my money that is free to be spent. I asked and there is a Bill Pay available, it only runs through the checking account.     Apparently I can have as many savings accounts as I want to (Doesn't cost extra), and each one can be named, such as ""Car Savings"" and ""Vacation"" and so on. I forgot to ask whether I could get a card for the savings accounts, to spend money directly out of them.    Other than that, I was thinking maybe have savings accounts for things like ""Steam Games"", ""Book Money"", ""Eating Out"", etc. into which I could put my monthly allotment or something... Previously (I had Wells Fargo) I had my PayPal attached to my main checking account, and bought most anything online using that.    Anyway, I'm probably over thinking things, but I'd appreciate your help figuring out a way to make my budgeting and spending as clear cut as possible.    In case it helps, here's my financial situation:    I work 40 h/wk at a factory job for $11.50/hr (night shift :/) Weekly paycheck for now, unless I get hired on permanently, then bi weekly. There's a lot of overtime available usually, but not guaranteed. I've got $2,400 on my WF credit card (limit $3,000) at 18% APR being transferred to Westconsin for something like 9% APR. (I think my credit score is 560? 580?) I'm working on paying that off, it was used to soak expenses while I moved and found a job.    I also have @17k in student loans, but they're currently on income based repayment, where I pay for 25 years and then it's done. That's currently at $0/month but will probably go up when my new job gets figured in.    My bills (roughly estimated in head): No rent (living in a free room situation) Internet $60 Cell Phone $80 Car Ins. $330/6months Audible $17 Reddit $5 Health Ins. (Don't have yet, I'm trying to figure out where to buy it, the whole things very confusing right now) $???

Relative to your income, it sounds like you have a lot of small (or too high) expenses that must add up: $80 cell phone bill, Audible, Reddit, Kindle, Steam, etc.  You really need to cut some of that stuff out or reduce it (and then some) until you get rid of the credit card debt.  The method I personally like is pretty simple:   Always keep enough money into checking for at least 2 months of expenses.  1 month might be okay, but 2 is better in case a lot of bills happen at the same time.  Another few months of expenses go into a savings account for emergencies. Set up automated billing for everything where it doesn't cost extra, ideally through a rewards credit card. Set up automated payments for your credit card from your checking (ideally for the full amount because you should never be carrying a balance). Set up Mint so you can figure out where all of your money is going, monitor your credit and debit cards for fraud, and make sure your bills are as expected.   I would strongly recommend reading and following ""How to handle $"" in the sidebar."

personalfinance,3dygxz,clarkredman,4,Mon Jul 20 15:47:51 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you mean, so i'll just explain why they would offer a lower term:  from the bank's perspective, it is more risky to have a longer term loan, since their money is tied up for a longer period of time, and you may default on it within that time.  They therefore charge a higher rate, and you pay more in interest.  Due to the length, however, this rate is spread out over a larger period, so your monthly payments are lower.  Now a shorter term, the bank gets their money sooner, so it's less risky, and the rate is lower.  you pay less interest overall due to the shorter time and lower rate, but you have a higher monthly payment since you are paying the balance in a shorter period of time."

personalfinance,3dygxz,apleima2,6,Mon Jul 20 15:58:37 2015 UTC,"only you could accurately answer that.  Based on what you said, the 20 year would be fine, since it will save you in interest over the long term.  As long as it doesn't effect your month-to-month finances, you want the shorter term.  If you are concerned, you could opt for the 25 year term, and pay extra to the equivalent of the 20 year term.  This lets you dial back the extra payments should you need to, while still saving some on interest (though not as much as the lower rate 20 year loan.)"

If you define better as having more cash in your pocket after paying your mortgage and do not mind the idea of paying more overall for your house/mortgage, then the longer term is better.  I personally am of the opinion that you'll want to pay as much as you're willing to as not only do you save money in the long term but you get to building equity faster, which is beneficial in event of moving on to a new home.

Its your home, potentially your kids home if you're going to be there a while, not just your largest asset. If you think the benefits both psychological and emotional of owning your residence free and clear sooner are important you may want to take that into consideration. I know I know its bad from a purely financial view but a house is the one area I allow a little irrationality. try this calculator to see what you'll save:  http://www.zillow.com/mortgage-calculator/refinance-calculator/  if this is your first house or even just a house you know your not going to be in for more than 5 years or so, this decision is a lot less important.

Yeah, one could even argue that you owe it to yourself. it seems you've worked and saved enough. but that said... The cost to own is what you want to think about. It's the ultimate driving machine, sure, but be prepared for mechanic bills in excess of $1000 every time you take it in. A coworker recently bought a 2010 3-series, and kept it until his first tune-up. bear in mind, nothing was broken, just a standard 35,000 mile service... total was a little over $4000. that's standard for one of these cars nowadays. now think that you'll have to take it in for similar servicing maybe twice a year, depending on how much you drive. pair that with needing higher octane gas- you'll need to be filling up with at least 91 octane. go lower for long enough, and you'll kill your car.  and then there's things that will break- if you get one of those ""automanual"" transmissions (the kind you shift without a clutch pedal), it'll go out every 60,000 miles and that's $8000 to replace at the low end.  you'll also burn tires quickly, because let's face it, it's an awesome car to drive. so an extra $5-800 every 16 months.   Basically what I'm saying is, it's a great car. it's a status symbol, they're built like fighter jets. but a fighter jet is a precision machine, and that means precision engineering = top dollar maintenance.  so If you think you can afford the true cost of ownership, go for it. but if an unexpectedly large scheduled maintenance bill will cause you to hate the car and cause financial fights in your marriage, then look into something similar from another company... The Lexus IS series is similarly sporty and comes with Toyota reliability... and an IS-F can kill a BMW M3 on the track, if you drive it right!  do what makes you happy, but that said, do what keeps your wife happy too!"

Most, but not all, plans allow you to do this, and it's tax free. I used to audit 401(k) plans at a prior job, and we did have one plan that did not allow for rollovers - I don't believe this is common, but I've seen it happen. Your best bet would be to consult the summary plan description for a new plan to make sure this is allowed.   If you rollover your old account balance to a new 401k plan, you may be eligible for a hardship withdrawal if you use the funds to purchase a primary residence. There is a 10% withdrawal penalty to do a hardship withdrawal, and you will not be able to make contributions to a new plan for 6 months if you receive one.  If you move your account to a 401k plan that allows for loans, that could be another option. In this case, a portion of your paycheck will be withheld to ""repay"" the loan to your account."

You should not touch this money or use it right now. The entire point of a 401k is to defer the money until retirement. You are proposing to take money out of protected asset (can't be touched in bankruptcy, child-support, taxation, etc), and move it to a mortgage (an asset that can be garnished in multiple ways).  Within the IRA account, you could put the money into a CD, sure. However, the traditional IRA is a tax-advantaged account and taking the money out of that and using right now is what will cause both a 10% penalty and taxes to be taken out.  You can do a conversion into a ROTH IRA without the 10% penalty. However, you won't be able to withdraw the money until 5 years after the conversion. (and you pay the tax now).  You can also do a series of substantially equal periodic payments without the penalty. However, the payments are stretched until you reach 59.5 years of age.   So this is hardly an option IMO.

personalfinance,3dz3c9,throwawaycuntulingus,2,Mon Jul 20 18:23:56 2015 UTC,"It's hard to give specifics with the general information in your original post, but for some overview:   What are the institutions/services(banks/services provided) i should be using to save. I’m assuming an estimate dollar amount would depend on my situation so you can give me an estimate if you like but i don’t know how useful that would be.   In general, you should have an emergency savings account that is 3-6 months of expenses. This is only to be used for actual emergencies such as covering bills after a job loss, medical emergencies, unexpected car repairs, etc.  If you just keep it in a savings account (which makes it readily accessible - kinda crucial for emergencies) it doesn't matter much which one, since they all have pretty low interest rates. I don't know any of the local banks in California, but there are big national ones you could use, too.  As for retirement savings, it's possible (likely, if it's a big tech company) that they offer a retirement plan of some kind, like a 401(k). That means you can put money into it and it's automatically invested/handled for you. In a lot of instances, employers ""match"" however much you put in, up to a certain amount.  So for example, if a company matches up to 3%, if you put in 3% of your salary, they'll do the same, so you end up with the equivalent of 6% of your salary being saved for retirement. (Even though you personally only contribute 3%.) Note that contributing to retirement plans has different tax benefits and possible pitfalls, and the money shouldn't be taken out, except in extreme circumstances, until retirement.    investing   Your friend suggesting investing in real estate isn't a bad idea, but California is notoriously expensive, and you should probably think about getting a bit of a feel for the US before you consider buying.  It sounds like you should also sit down and make a realistic budget. There are tons of budget calculators and tools online to help plan that out. Your budget should include all of your expenses, including rent, utilities, food, transportation, entertainment/going out, retirement contributions, savings contributions, etc."

Storage is money down the drain.  (2) Put it up on craigslist and get it sold to put some cash in your pocket.  Do the same with anything you don't really need and would have a hard time moving. (3) Get looking for a place in a lower rent area (think rural rather than bad part of town) that could accommodate you and your parent plus offer a decent array of jobs for both of you.  Arrange it ahead of time.  The fact that you are renting right now gives you a reference to use.  Further out in the country many landlords will work with a potential renter because their client base is much smaller.  Arranging ahead of time is important because you can arrange references for power bills and such and so minimize deposits all over the place.  (4) Keep your car.

personalfinance,3dyaev,DrBrian,5,Mon Jul 20 18:03:57 2015 UTC,"Or should she go to a dealership that pays off your old car and just buy something new for around 18k?   Absolutely not.  That's just piling debt on top of debt and will immediately make her upside down on a new loan.   If her car is worth 6k and the still has 11k (assuming this is the payoff amount, could be more depending on what financing she got), then the dealership would pay the 11k on top of the loan for the new car, (you said 18k)... so now she has a loan for 29k.  Then they would offer to buy the old car and probably wouldn't offer the 6k it is worth unless they think they can sell it immediately or for more.  It's a two part transaction for the dealership.  The offer to buy the old vehicle is not inherently tied to the financing.  But let's say she gets the full 6k.  She now has an 18k car and owes 23k on it, PLUS the fact that she basically just renewed the interest on the old debt.  She could easily end up paying 25k for an 18k car.    If you can refinance the current car and pay less in interest then that's a good course of action but I have a hard time believing anyone financial institution would give a loan to someone who is upside-down unless there is some other collateral involved.  Otherwise at this point her best bet may just be to stick it out, depending on how reliable the car is and how long she has left on the loan.  If she's making 35K/year then she's going to be able to afford a payment on an 11k loan for a few more years a lot better than a payment on a 23k loan for 5 or 6 years."
personalfinance,3dyaev,DrBrian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:16:05 2015 UTC,"When you say other collateral, do you mean more than the 2k she'll put down on the car to refinance?"
personalfinance,3dyaev,dontgivethemyourssn,2,Mon Jul 20 16:02:56 2015 UTC,"Yes. In order for a bank to take on the risk of a loan they would typically need it backed by something equal to or above the value of what you want to buy.   The down payment isn't necessarily collateral.  The down payment is proof of your investment in the property.  In order for the bank to buy they want you to be invested, as well.  When I say collateral I'm talking about what happens if you don't make your payments and they have to take the vehicle.  Say she takes the loan and makes 0 payments on it.  Even with her 2k, if the bank takes her car they won't be able to sell it for the remaining 9k.  If the bank manages to sell it at its value of 6k, then the bank loses out by 3k. Most banks prefer to marginalize their risks, not take on a huge risk.  Her credit score might be enough for some places to take on that risk but don't be surprised if she gets rejected.  All-in-all, I think the best thing she can do is go to a handful of banks/credit unions and talk to them.  They might not be interested in taking the loan at all, or they might ask for her to bridge the gap with a higher down payment.  Some places might even ask to put the loan against a vehicle/property that is worth more."

personalfinance,3dzc5p,goshon021,4,Mon Jul 20 19:27:28 2015 UTC,3 options I can think of: 1)you roll it over to an IRA account 2)roll it into your new 401k with your new employer 3)if it's enough the current provider might allow you to leave it in place.  I think #1 is the best option and gives you the most flexibility with how to invest the money.
personalfinance,3dzc5p,zinner1,3,Mon Jul 20 19:28:45 2015 UTC,"Typically you can roll it over to your new employer's plan or you could roll it over to an IRA.  A traditional IRA would be a straight roll over, a Roth IRA you'd have to pay taxes on the money.  You could also leave it in the current account, but your employer may have some limitations on this.  Your best bet would be to roll it to an IRA because you have more low-cost option there than in a 401k plan."
personalfinance,3dzc5p,nowordsleft,2,Mon Jul 20 19:29:03 2015 UTC,"As others have stated you generally have 3 options: leave it, roll it over into an IRA, roll it into the new 401k. Cashing it out is a very, very bad 4th option that requires giving the government ~35% of the value.   Which of these is best depends on several factors like: your income, the 401k value, the fund options and expenses of your old and new 401ks.   In general, rollover into a personal IRA and investing in low-expense US stock mutual funds is your best option. The exception is if you have a high income and a large 401k balance. In this situation rolling into an IRA may effectively prevent you from making backdoor Roth IRA contributions. If you are in this situation then you will want to leave the 401k where it is (if they allow it) or roll it into your new 401k (if they allow it)."

By now, you should have a good understanding of how much you spend monthly from groceries to bills. Make sure you set aside that money when budgeting. Also, only put what you can in your savings. If you go under your budget, great! Place the remainder in the savings account. I did this and was saving 15% of my yearly income (not including 401(k)). In other words, your savings plan of 25% or his full paycheck may be too aggressive; therefore, you always go over budget and deduct from your savings."

We make a spreadsheet (actually, any kind of list or calendar will do, but I use excel) showing every predictable bill you have and when its due.  This will stop the surprises for the regular bills like income taxes.  It also helps us to see if a bill was late or missing, so we can catch it before it goes past due.  The key is to print it out, and use it like a checklist: mark off when each bill is paid, and see when the next one is due.  See my sample here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15O5_HVkzQhsdccYQtOGWX-_um3KN2FEtTHeerittILY/edit?usp=sharing   There are of course other expenditures you can't predict, like medical bills, etc., but those would fall under other budget categories.

Presumably your inheritances came from family. Families with this much money have relationships with a variety of professionals to assist with money management. If a single painting was worth $40MM and you own ""three large apartments across two cities"", that would imply a net worth in excess of $100MM dollars. There is no way you are currently managing that unassisted. So, if the question is ""I have $200MM net worth managed by my family office, I have no financial worries ever and need help figuring out what to do with my life"", that's a moderately legitimate question, but more philosophical and personal finance.  If you are trying to assert ""I have $200MM net worth that was plopped on my without any trust structure around it or any professionals actively engaged in managing these assets,"" then I have to call bullshit. People who have this much money to leave to their heirs have lawyers that are good enough to know that a 20-something should never end up in that situation."

Also note I am not from the USA, and I grew up in an environment where I was not the richest kid on the block!  The what should I do with my life is a great question! The kind of thing I am looking for from Reddit. The idea was to get advice I would never have gotten from a Lawyer or Tax advisor. I am very literate when it comes to Tax planning...   When it comes to ""People who have this much money to leave to their heirs"" I did not receive any cash. I got a house with an extensive collection of Modern/Impressionist paintings. The owner of said house never sold a painting and the value of the paintings nearly doubled from the time I inherited them to the time I sold the one painting.   If you have any ideas for me let me know! I am quite lost with my life at the moment..."
personalfinance,3e2kvm,c2reason,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:25:15 2015 UTC,"I was just making stuff up. One painting being significantly more than 20% of your estate's value seems strange. But if the estate is much larger than $200MM, your posting seems stranger and stranger.  I think you'd get more useful advice if you explained your situation better. You're not for the US. Are you (and these assets) in the US now, or some other country? Are you a US citizen? IS all the help you have a tax advisor and a lawyer? Who handles the income from the three apartment buildings and decides where it should go? What advice are these people giving you? Why are you dissatisfied enough to seek other non-professional opinions? Don't get me wrong, this sub is great all the way up to about $5-10MM in assets, especially liquid assets. But there is no a lot of expertise (and not enough people to sanity check each other) for dealing with large real estate and art holdings. I'd recommend interviewing other wealth managers and finding someone who will work with you for <1% assets under management that you like and feel comfortable with.   When it comes to ""People who have this much money to leave to their heirs"" I did not receive any cash.   You didn't receive cash, but you received liquid assets worth a lot of money, which is essentially the same. Was this house and everything in it really just left to you with no trust structure at all? Really, that's a bad idea simply form a liability standpoint. (I really hope you have carefully though about insurance too.)  I assume this stuff is all coming from family. Do you have close relatives still living? Do they have similar assets? Were there expectations/hopes from the people who left you the house and apartment buildings that you hold onto them and not just liquidate them?  Personally, I'd get a professional I trusted to deal with all the details and make some recommendations. I'd have them tell me how much income the assets could sustainably generate for me. Then I'd decide what I wanted to do - grow the estate, live a very nice life spending all that money, or give some of the money away. I'd use that decision to inform what I wanted to do career-wise. You could go be an angel investor, start or joint a nonprofit, or go pursue another interest entirely with no pressure of having as much income as possible."

I am seeking advice because frankly I feel lost... I don't really know where I am at in my life. I am sure I should seek out more advice from professionals, but their cues are biased. The only issue is, when you see a professional in the art world they urge you to sell (through them of course). I was left the house with no structure, and the tax code of the country I am from means that I only paid tax on the  house. The paintings are considered ""furniture"". I have no relatives still living. I am the last living member of my family. If I do not have children my family name will be extinct. I am holding on to the art because some of it has come from generations of my family. It is purely sentimental.   You give good advice on financial planners.

In the US if you own a single unit in a big building it's generally called a ""condo"", whereas apartments are in multi-unit buildings all owned by a single landlord with the units rented out. (I know several people with such buildings as family assets, so erroneously inferred this would be similar.)  Okay, so apartments in Paris and London. Getting a value on the non-art portion of this shouldn't be so hard. What are you doing with all of these places now? Seems obvious to get a property manager and rent them out for income if you don't want to sell them.  I'd work of finding a wealth manager that you're comfortable with. Come up with a plan to sell or rent the places you're not actively living in. Whatever proceeds come from renting or selling a wealth manager can handle for you and help you decide what income to draw.  For the art, maybe hit up a museum for a curator that would work with you for a consulting fee who doesn't do the selling side of auctions to evaluate what you've got and give some unbiased advice."

They will back bill you. At the very least it'll be the monthly bill x however long she's had service. Worst case scenario is (monthly bill + monthly late fee ($40 IIRC)) x however long she's had service.   Given that its comcast, if they someday slap us with back charges, it will no doubt be full of every single late fee and charge they can think of and will likely not have the original price tier we were (supposed to be) paying for. We don't really have any documetation of our own to show what anything should be. Would we be in any position to fight any of that?   If you don't have any documentation of what you originally signed up for, then you're not in a position to fight. You need to find something - anything - that shows what you signed up for initially.   If my mother moves, should we call up and try and cancel it (thereby likely allowing them to discover their oversight). In other words, if we don't, could they come after her for charges accrued through the connection after she left and someone else moved in?   Honestly - I wouldn't. I'd just return the box, modem, etc. and go about your merry way. Now, this probably isn't the most honest thing to do, but it's what I'd do.  Back in high school this happened to a friend of mine (well his parents anyway). Contact Comcast. Tell them your address and that you're receiving service but haven't been getting a bill. Preferably do this on the Comcast online chat so you can save a copy of the conversation. After that, you can't be held responsible (Comcast can try, but if you have proof that you informed them and then never got around to fixing it that's on them).   I'd also check your/her bank accounts just to make sure that they haven't been auto-paying the bill each month. I'm sure you've already done this - but want to mention it anyway just in case."

They don't want to deal with having to evict you, so work with them on a solution that involves you getting out of the lease, moving out and leaving the apparent spotless, and work from there. Collections for a month or two of rent are a lot better than for the remainder of lease plus any damages that occurred while the apartment sat vacant while they slogged through the eviction process... not to mentioned you signed an agreement, do your best to resolve it.  Once you're no longer paying rent, work out minimum payments, deferments, settlements, etc with your creditors. Always keep everything in writing, and save that paperwork FOREVER. If a creditor isn't being reasonable, ignore them for a month and work with someone else who is. Work through it as best you can, if some of it ends up in a judgement it is what it is, you'll get garnished but have so real assets so it's not the end of the world, and once you get out of school and are making decent money, clean the rest of the debt up, your credit will recover over time, and you'll be able to move on with your life."

The plans are effectively the same between the two carriers.  A 64GB S6 from Verizon is $299 with contract or $29.16/month with Edge.  Unfortunately unless you're springing for 6GB of data you're only getting $15 off a month so you end up saving $360 but paying $699.84 for the phone so it costs $340 instead of $300 for the phone.  The pay as you go plans are really only good once your device has been paid off.  Unfortunately we live in an era where people can't afford a big upfront payment so they pay more over time instead so the carriers come out ahead but the users get screwed.  Price it out, if the monthly service fee for the line isn't going to be significantly more just switch to the big player in your area, keeping your number is super easy too, i just moved to AT&T from Verizon"
personalfinance,3e0lcv,mmmmmmBacon12345,3,Tue Jul 21 01:36:37 2015 UTC,My advice would be to buy an older T-Mobile or unlocked phone on Ebay and just swap your sim card.

personalfinance,3e0lcv,cwood74,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:02:36 2015 UTC,What type of plan are you looking at? Verizon and att charge more for comparable plans. You will end up paying for that subsidized cost of the phone and then some over the course of the life of the contract. Also if you stay at T-Mobile longer then 2 years you are going to own your phone out right and your payments will lower by 28 dollars. That will not happen at Verizon or att. You have to take the total price paid for everything over the two years to see what is the best deal financially. Verizon has better coverage then any other carrier across the country. If you do a lot of traveling then that might matter to you. T-Mobile usually has really good coverage and high speeds on their lte in major metro areas. Ultimately you should do what makes sense for your situation.
personalfinance,3e0lcv,MalazVenge,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:19:22 2015 UTC,"Buyer beware: The unwritten rule behind this is, noted from personal experience with Verizon's Edge program:  If you have technical issues, you have to live out the duration of the phone's payments until you can back out of the contract, unless you carry the issue to regional executives.  I was having technical issues where my phone calls would not come through a majority of the time. I would not know who was calling me unless they texted me to let me know they called. I carried the issue to Verizon.  Over the course of 8 months, I was put through 5 new phones (as they were deemed defective), had my number reset within their system, told I should not download apps in any form as they may be causing the issue (apparently Reddit and WSJ cause the issue, he said sarcastically). Regardless of all of this, I was told if I wanted to back out, I would need to cover the remainder of the cost of paying off the original phone that was deemed defective.  So, I found a way where you can contact a regional executive for higher priority cases. After eight months of garbage service, I was finally let out of the contract with $0 due, I only had to return the current phone.  Do not get yourself stuck in contracts if the service is to save a bit now. You sometimes pay in the end (especially backloaded contracts such as DirecTV)."

I started contributing 4 years ago when I was 23 so I feel like I have a leg up on someone who may not have even had a job with a 401K until they were closer to 30. That could be a foolish assumption though. According to how this thread is going I'm apparently prone to making those :)
personalfinance,3dzs8l,Frozenlazer,2,Mon Jul 20 21:47:21 2015 UTC,You should be contributing at least 10% from your early to mid 20's.

The way the atty explained it to me was that the technically the trust owned it all, not the grantor (my mother) so there in effect was no estate tax possible, since it didn't actually belong to the estate per se. All that happens is the trust turns ownership over to me, and voila.   I am 100% certain there were no taxes paid by the trust upon death before i got my money.  Since some of it was an annuity, i did wind up paying some income tax on that years income from the annuity. But that was after the money was transferred to me, and really had nothing to do with inheriting it. It was income, it was mine, and normal IRS income tax was paid.   but zero estate taxes were paid."

personalfinance,3e0jx2,rarararargh,3,Tue Jul 21 00:55:25 2015 UTC,"I think what you want to do is recharacterize the trad IRA contribution as Roth contribution. Your custodian needs to transfer the contribution and any net income attributable to it into the Roth. The reporting includes attaching a ""statement"" to your filing describing the recharacterization, but does not cause any tax or penalty. It is as if the contribution went into a Roth in the first place and grew in there.  (I am presuming you are talking about year 2015 contribution; if 2014 contributions made in early 2015, the correction requires a quick amended filing and an annotation, described in link below.) [EDIT: The latter is the case.]  Read here, and in particular the first of four scenarios described.  http://www.irs.gov/instructions/i8606/ch01.html#d0e465  Perhaps somewhat perversely, I find the best description of what you have to do is this, hidden inside the instructions for a form you do not have to file. The 8606 is required in some scenarios but not this one. [EDIT: Actually, a revised 2014 form 8606 is likely required, to show there is no longer any nondeductible basis.]  The formula for net income attributable (i.e. the growth of just the contribution) can be seen in this investopedia article:  http://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/03/092403.asp  But IRS Pub 590a also has a chunk of material about this, with examples. The chap 1 worksheet 1-3 can be used, if your custodian doesn't take care of this for you:  http://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a/ch01.html#en_US_2014_publink1000230671  Note: If you are not eligible to make Roth contributions, say so. The other option is for you to Roth convert as a backdoor, but then you pay taxes now on the growth that occurred. The nondeductible contribution doesn't get taxed. But this is a challenging process if you already have pretax contribution balance in trad IRA, because of pro rata rule. [EDIT: OP just created the trad IRA for purposes of nondeductible contribution, so no troublesome pro rata rule if Backdoor Roth strategy is used. But this results in taxes on the growth.]  So, are you talking about year 2015 contributions?  And does your income still allow you to make direct Roth contributions?"
personalfinance,3e0jx2,wijwijwij,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:21:50 2015 UTC,"No, I was referring to 2014 contributions that I made in 2015 (get the savings in before the next tax year!), and yes, I am eligible under the income limits to make direct Roth contributions.   Thanks for the great links - it looks like, since 6 months from April 15 hasn't passed, I'm eligible for the recharacterization as you've advised. Your links are money in the bank!"
personalfinance,3e0jx2,wijwijwij,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:13:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah it looks like you are within the 6 months. Frankly I don't know exactly what needs to be amended, since your 2014 filing does not have anything related to your nondeductible contribution on your Form 1040 itself (since it was nondeductible), and your ""new"" Form 1040 would not look any different. So I don't know how to interpret the IRS's phrase ""if necessary."" They are vague because they are writing about several different kinds of recharacterizations. Yours is one that in my view leaves almost no traces.   Do you file 1040X and just say ""no changes to numbers but see attached statement about the recharacterization""?  Maybe you need to file an amended 8606 with the 1040X. In other words, now that you don't have a nondeductible contribution to report, you need to reset your basis to zero.  I find it hard to know exactly how to handle this. Does it make sense for your updated 8606 to simply show $0 on line 1, $X on line 2 if you have nondeductible basis in your trad IRA from previous years, and then line 3 and line 14 would both simply show $X? (Which means if you don't have nondeductible amounts from prior years, lines 1, 2, 3, and 14 would all just say $0!)  So what exactly do you write that ""pursuant to"" note on? Must you file 1040X to write that note? I know 8606 can be filed on its own, but it does sound like you may need to do a silly 1040X.  I have no experience with this, which is why I raise the question. Although you won't have trouble getting the money recharacterized, your custodian might not provide advice about how you adjust 2014 filing.  Edit: This boglehead thread discusses the puzzlememt over this.  https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=163442  The last commenter suggests you file 1040X even though no numbers change, and explain the recharacterization in the Part III space where you describe why you are amending.   So: Do you file an almost blank 1040X, attach that ""statement"" about recharacterization, and write the ""pursuant to"" annotation, and include your revised 2014 8606, which might just have a bunch of $0s on it? That seems to me the direction to take, but you may want to pose this over in /r/tax subreddit.  Recharacterizing a nondeductible trad IRA contribution to become a direct Roth contribution is pretty rare, so make sure if you crosspost you make this clear. If it were a deductible IRA contribution, it's clear you'd have numeric changes to fill out on 1040X.  (P.S. If you really are unsure about how to handle this as a recharacterization before October, you could just do a Roth conversion. You'd have to pay taxes just on the growth. This is slightly less optimal, because of those taxes (which you should be able to avoid by recharacterizing). But the paperwork for doing backdoor Roth is a lot more widely known and easy to describe. It just uses Parts I and II of a 2015 Form 8606, and taxable amount from line 18 gets added to 2015 Form 1040 line 15b as income. The original contribution would be nontaxable, because already taxed. How much growth are we talking about? What tax would that generate for you? There could be an argument to just pay it. That strategy would mean Roth converting any time in 2015, and all handling of this issue would happen on 2015 taxes, with no amending of 2014 needed.)"

personalfinance,3e0jlr,BrainWaveB23,2,Tue Jul 21 00:52:54 2015 UTC,"Refinancing your home does not fundamentally generate cash. In fact generally you have to bring cash to the table to cover closing costs.  If you're looking to do a refinance and take cash out, you are probably looking at 15-30 days to close. You'll need to have an appraisal done, provide proof of income, tax returns, etc. You then meet to close the mortgage with a lawyer."
personalfinance,3e0jlr,c2reason,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:06:53 2015 UTC,What if I've add an appraisal within the past 5 years? Does that matter? Or must the house be re-appraised?
personalfinance,3e0jlr,c2reason,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:30:59 2015 UTC,If you're refinancing with the same lender and the appraisal is recent enough they may be willing to use it. It depends on the market and their policies. If you are with a different lender they will require an appraisal.
personalfinance,3e0jlr,hendlefe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:37:35 2015 UTC,"They will not use that appraisal. 5 years is a long time and property values changed pretty quickly.

If you're planning to pull money out of your house in a refinance, you are borrowing against its value (treating your house as if it's a piggy bank).  As a general rule, cash-out refinancing isn't a great idea for most folks.  Refinancing to get a better interest rate is a good idea if your mortgage savings will recoup your closing costs in a timely manner."

You most likely use your checking account more often (purchasing/withdrawals, deposits) so there are more pending charges on your account until they go through. There is a delay between refreshing/updating on mint because their system has to log into each of your accounts and check the current balances. Even though you hit refresh on Mint, that doesn't have it re-check your balances on your external accounts; that would be way too server intensive for managing millions of accounts. Instead, they update at regular intervals. I know for me, with PNC, their transactions are marked as pending for a few days and Mint doesn't pick those up until they are fully through."

Employers generally spend 30% of an employees total compensation on taxes and benefits.  http://web.mit.edu/e-club/hadzima/how-much-does-an-employee-cost.html   http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2013/08/14/if-30-of-pay-is-benefits-what-about-independent-contractors/
personalfinance,3dzoh9,ekoostikmartin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:59:02 2015 UTC,"So, a couple general thoughts.    Don't let the fact that you have convenient alternatives (home office, wife's healthcare) save your company money. They were paying for those things when you were an employee and should continue to pay for them.  Don't forget the loss of PTO, unless you are billing them as a flat annual fee, then I guess it's a moot point. If you are billing them hourly, if you don't work you don't get paid.  I've heard from several sources, that its a generally a good rule to add 30% to your base salary if you are converting to W2. 7+% of that is just the additional self employment taxes you'll have to pay as an independent contractor. That doesn't typically include special things like the malpractice insurance.  Even if you billed them at 150k a year, that seems a little on the low side for an experienced GC, on salary. Outside counsel would no doubt be billing 250-1000 an hour. So 500-1M a year. (Assuming they really need 2000 hours of legal help). Why are you doing this, seems like you are giving up some decent benefits for some extra hassle."
personalfinance,3dzoh9,Frozenlazer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:02:37 2015 UTC,"Billing would be a flat monthly fee regardless of hours actually worked (similar to my salary now).  In private practice, my billing rate was $300+/hr. but my company doesn't need close to 2000 hrs. of legal help annually.  Frankly, I have some extra time on my hands on a daily basis that I may be able to commit to other clients (assuming I swapped from employee to consultant w/e a solo practice) but I don't want to figure the potential for additional work into the equation since that's far from guaranteed.  In any case, this would be only something I'd consider if my take-home (after expenses, additional taxes, costs of similar benefits, etc.) were considerably higher than where I'm at now.  And I think my company would only be willing to make the swap and pay me more if it was cost-effective for them.  Finding that middle ground that works for both of us (if it even exists) is where I'm struggling."
personalfinance,3dzoh9,Frozenlazer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:33:30 2015 UTC,"Have you considered just asking them to give you a number they'd be willing to pay.  Sometimes its hard to quantify costs of a single employee because its not like they went out and leased one more office/cube for you and will now get savings if you leave. Yet you'll have office expenses.   So you might say, ""I've been thinking... ...""my estimates put your costs at probably my salary plus something around 30%, do you want to put in a bid for my time if I were contract"".   Then when they come back and say 120 or whatever, you can compare that to your expected budget and see how it stacks up."
personalfinance,3dzoh9,brodie0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:09:20 2015 UTC,"Legality of switching someone from w2 employee to 1099 contractor aside, I'd charge at least 50% more than your salary to compensate for lack of benefits and stability. Maybe more if you think they'd go for it.   There's no point that saves the company money AND makes you more money. Compensation is not strictly the amount of money in your paycheck. Your benefits have a dollar amount associated with them.   Most companies do this to save money, though.  You will probably encounter resistance if you ask for more than even $100k, which would be a severe haircut for you.   Edit - unless your planning to go get other clients as well, that is. Then you'd need to find out what an acceptable hourly rate for your services are and work from there."

personalfinance,3e0ho8,wijwijwij,2,Tue Jul 21 00:56:22 2015 UTC,"Yes. When you have control in a few months, call Vanguard and ask them to initiate a trustee to trustee transfer from the bank to them. That keeps the status of the money protected as Roth and you have no tax consequences. Vanguard may set up a three way conference call, and you'll have to fill out paperwork. Also, you'll want to establish a beneficiary for the new Roth.   Once the money is transferred, you'll have a Vanguard Roth IRA account. Initially the funds might sit in money market fund until you tell vanguard (you can do this online) what fund or funds to invest in. With a Roth IRA there is little need to keep much in the money market account, and so I'd say you probably would set up each fund you buy to reinvest dividends and cap gains distributions. That means those forms of income get turned around to buy more shares. In a Roth account you don't have to track such dividends or gains for tax purposes; they won't be taxed. So reinvest option probably makes sense.   Once you have this set up, remember you may contribute only if you have earned income. The max is $5500/year, if you have at least that much compensation. You can contribute for year X any time between Jan 1 year X and tax due date Apr 15 year X + 1."

Typical your score will drop only a few points. Here's what I recommend. If you're going to get a card for daily expenditures and building credit, I would only purchase things you normally would out of your checking account (spending like you had the cash on hand). Its when people start buying frivolous things that they get into trouble. But yeah, your idea is a really great method to building credit fast. One extra tip, don't carry a balance and pay that interest on purchases. Also, if you have multiple cards use them the same way and pay them off every month. The credit reporting agencies will recieve reports of your monthly spending limit and report that but will also report a ZERO balance, which is good. In addition, creditors later down the road will see your debt to income ratio and understand that you know how to handle your money making them more likely to give you a loan for a car, house, boat, etc..."

Agree with others that you absolutely should not take the deal you've been offered from the car insurance place. You should try and get a card with better perks from your existing bank, where they will be more generous if you have a history of banking with them. As a good rule of thumb, you want one card that has great rewards and one card that has responsible boring things as perks (free balance transfers, 0% interest, etc.). With a credit score in the 600s you can probably get a responsible card and then wait 6 months to a year and get a great rewards card for which you need low 700s in credit (like Chase Sapphire Preferred)."

Just pay the full bill every month to avoid interest and debt.  No - Ok, now you should try to keep it under 30% to up your credit score.  Ideally you wanna keep it below 10%.  An easy way to do this, make a payment of 99% of your balance a couple days before your statement date, then your statement will have a 10$ balance or something, giving you the ideal (<10%) credit utilization for your score.   TL;DR, stop caring about nickel and diming your credit score, its pointless for 90% of your life.  Be a responsible spender, pay your bills in full on time, and your score will take care of itself."

personalfinance,3dyz6r,rnelsonee,3,Mon Jul 20 18:30:00 2015 UTC,"I don't regret my new 2013 Mazda. Until then I bought used nicer cars (Mini Cooper S, VW, Mercedes)  and always dropped a lot of money on them once they hit 100,000 miles. I drive over 25,000 miles/yr so they never lasted too long.  Quick facts: 1.99% APR, $22,000, and I had about $15,000+ liquid at the time. Financed it all and kept my cash invested in the S&P.  My rule last time was to either buy yet another used German car or a new car, but it had to be cheap and boring. Enter the Mazda 3 - it's been 70,000 miles and I've paid nothing but basic oil/filter changes, and just got new tires. The tire place joked they didn't like me because my near-perfect alignment and my pads were at 60% so all they did was a basic balance. And even the dealership prices are amazing compared to anyone working on my other cars. My oil change this weekend was free because they kept me waiting a while. The one before that was free because I had 5 punches on my punch card. Before that it was $70 for synthetic - that's Jiffy Lube prices. No Mercedes dealer would ever have deals like that. My last trip to the Mercedes dealership cost me $85 for one windshield wiper!  So in other words, my car is cheap as shit to own (1 cent per mile until I just got $450 in  tires, but still under 1.5 cents now). Sure I have a payment for another year, but it's <2% APR so who cares? The peace of mind has been worth it. If I had bought a 60,000 mile car I'd be at 130,000 miles now and spending god knows what on repairs. Now, yeah, probably less than my monthly payment now. But I'm getting piece of mind, and my car has never had to spend a day in the shop, which is always a pain in the ass unless they have a loaner car for you.   Plus, no one ever sells a perfectly-working car (I would know, I've sold 5 or 6, all right after a shop quoted me a huge repair bill). My car is maintained very well so I know it will last 200,000 miles."

personalfinance,3dyz6r,SprungMS,3,Mon Jul 20 18:24:05 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna get railed, but here goes.  Bought a brand new Subaru BRZ last April. Financed for 72 months with a low down payment (15%). I had been through a few used cars that I couldn't leave stock, eventually got bored, and traded for another crappy used car. I'm an automotive technician, and have worked on cars since I could drive. The last 2 I had were a turbo miata (that was a shit ton of fun) that something would break every couple weeks, and I traded that for an 86 Porsche 944 with 80k original miles. The Porsche was not nearly as fun, I traded entirely for reliability. It ran great, until one morning on the way into work, the timing belt snapped. I had a friend pick me up and help push it out of a center lane, and when I found out the timing belt was gone, I knew the car was scrap. I wasn't going to source another engine, it would cost more to get the parts than it was worth to me. Since it was my only ride, I had to get something else, and something reliable. I did a lot of research over a couple weeks and landed at a newish civic, a newish Kia Forte, or a newish BRZ/FR-S. Since the 86 twins came out, I was in love. It was a car I thought was perfectly designed for me as a driver. And it was. I test drove a new BRZ and a new WRX, and knew what I wanted. I couldn't get any used 6 speed BRZs or FR-Ss in the timeframe I had, so I went new. After all, they were only 5-6k more expensive, and it's a car I could/would/will keep for my lifetime. I could stand to know I was the only owner, the only one to work on it, and the only* one to drive it.  Overall, I know I could have been better off financially for the next 5 years if I had gotten the civic. Could have been. Like if I hadn't taken every extra dime I had to throw into it and try to make it more fun (yeah, right). I think I made the right choice. I have a car I'll be happy with for life, and I've since bought and sold some used cars as side work. If I needed to, I could garage the BRZ, take insurance and registration off of that, keep paying it off, and drive a used car for cheaper until I needed the reliability again. I'd rather just drive my dream machine.   Thanks for reading.  TL;DR - could have bought cheaper, happy in many ways that I didn't.   Disclaimer - my situation is unlike many others, and probably won't fit your needs."

personalfinance,3dyz6r,lepfrog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:44:19 2015 UTC,the second car i ever bought was purchased brand new.  i went from an 88 jeep cherokee that was costing a bunch in maintennance to a new 07 hyandai accent.  don't regret it.  i looked around and i could have bough a used car for only marginally less than the new one (was around 10k for the new car)  i still have the hyandai and drive it daily without anything but standard maintenance costs put into it. it was my first ever loan and i had a 9% interest rate.  other than that i would say it was worth it as from gas mileage alone i have saved the entire cost of this car when compared to my jeep's mileage.  though i do miss the space of the jeep and the option to take it off road.

I had just been hit which totaled my car, so I put 5k down on a 15k car at 0% for 5 years. It got me through college, after which I sold it for what I owed on because it wasn't a great model and was having issues. Ever since then I've bought older used cars from people I knew maintained them well, and have done really well with that. I'm hoping to get another 5+ years out of my old 2wd truck, then upgrade to a 4x4 so I can breathe a little easier driving into some of the places I hike or kayak. I'm hoping to pay cash, car payments and high insurance payments suck."

I got a lovely CPO 2010 German luxury sedan at a great price through my husband's friend/old schoolmate at 0 down payment & 0.9% APR. It's both the ""family"" car and my fun car.

It's a 2014 Evo X, about $40k out the door.  I don't regret it at all so far and it's a ton of fun.  I financed $20k of it at 3.99% for 6 years because my credit had taken a hit from the 2 cards I'd opened recently. This is also the first loan I've ever had (no student loans or anything).   I pay about $600 a month (double the minimum).  I'll probably pay it all off early next year with a lump sump - I only plan to use about 1 of those 6 years.  I could have paid cash but at 3.99% it made sense to finance and keep at least partially invested instead.  It really is a very fun car though and right now my only mod is a tune so I'm around 330hp.  Next year or late this year I'll be doing intake/intercooler/turbo back exhaust and a custom tune.

Don't overspend and put yourself into even more debt.  Especially for something you only think you need for 3-4 years.  Also, have you considered insurance costs of the new car?  They are typically higher on newer rides, especially for younger drivers."
personalfinance,3dyj1g,apleima2,2,Mon Jul 20 16:07:14 2015 UTC,"I've considered both. My initial plan was purchasing something outright for cash. Unfortunately my car went rogue and is not going to make it long enough for me to save any more toward a new car.   I started off looking at 2012-2014 honda civics. And for the 10-15k range I'm going to get a car with over 50k miles. At that point your reliability and cost of maintenance begins to factor in.   I did receive insurance quotes and it's very reasonable- I'm not a younger driver I'm 27. I just took a while figuring out a career haha  Additionally, It's not that I'll only need the car for 3-4 years. I'm just anticipating purchasing a new car in 3-4 years.    Another element I'm factoring in that I forgot to mention in my original post is that I'm planning to buy a house about a year from now.   Having no CC debt for the next year and regular payments on car/student loan for a year will help raise my credit quite a bit over the course of a year (currently a 715)"

If you make lower payments, then whatever you still owe is going to be subtracted from whatever you sell it for. The capital cost to own is purchase price - resale price. Length/type of financing is completely irrelevant."
personalfinance,3dyj1g,spacec0re,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:44:54 2015 UTC,I guess I shouldn't say it costs me nothing to own.   It costs me $14k over 4 years where as if I put a down payment it's costing me $21k over 4 years.   I should be able to sell for 15k in 4 years. So I can utilize my 10k else where instead of on a down payment.   I realize that if I put the 10k down- finance 14k instead- I will potentially make money when selling the car in 4 years. My loan will have a much lower balance and the difference will be cash back to me. But it seems like I'm tying that cash up for the length of the loan instead of using it to pay off the debts.
personalfinance,3dyj1g,throwaway50912,2,Mon Jul 20 16:54:54 2015 UTC,"Getting cash through selling a car isn't ""making money,"" it's exchanging an asset for value.  Just because you financed the car with a loan, doesn't mean you are somehow getting more value out of that money -- In fact it's generally the opposite, since you are paying additional interest on that debt the entire time you own the car.  Yes, technically, you could finance a car at a low interest rate and then use the freed capital to pay down your higher interest credit card and student loan debts, but no one in this sub is going to support that decision because there is a much better opportunity from a sound personal finance viewpoint: don't spend as much money on a new car.  Every dollar you're not spending on a car each month is money that could be put to work either by paying down your existing debt, or going into an investment and thus earning you even more money through interest.  Buying more debt is not putting your income to good use, and will make your situation even worse in the long term."
personalfinance,3dyj1g,AstulzerRZD,2,Mon Jul 20 18:40:51 2015 UTC,"You're thinking of payments all wrong. If you make small payments on a more expensive car it will still depreciate. Plus you're out the amount you have made in payments. Let's use an example:  20k car, 10k down payment, $200/mo paid over the course of 3 years. At the end of 3 years you will have paid $17200 on the vehicle including a down payment. Trade it in and get say 75 percent of value back (which is generous because more expensive vehicles depreciate faster), which is about 15k towards a new car. But, the car still isn't paid off so they deduct 2800 from your trade in value leaving you with 12200, or spending 5 grand for 3 years of car ownership (rough math).    You are worse off putting nothing down, for which you'd have paid 7200 for the car, leaving 12800 on the loan, meaning you only get 2200 credit for a trade in assuming the car hasn't depreciated MORE in which case you owe money for the car before even being able to trade it in. Don't even get me started if you wreck it! Never be upside down on a car loan. If you wreck it in the first year and only get a check for a much smaller amount when you paid 20k for the car, you're still responsible for paying off the rest of the loan and having to purchase another vehicle. Try making two car payments at once!  Take a cheap car for 10k, say you buy it outright. Say it depreciates to 75% after 3 years as well (which is unlikely to be the case because a depreciation curve on a car is less steep if the car isn't as new). The value will have dropped 2500. When you go in to trade in your car, you'll get 7500 towards your next car, so you spend 2500 for 3 years of car ownership.   Plug in any depreciation amounts for a car (check edmunds or nada or kbb) as well as car costs and your supposed payment amount and you'll find the true cost of ownership. Remember that depreciation and interest ain't cheap."
personalfinance,3dyj1g,AstulzerRZD,0,Mon Jul 20 17:01:01 2015 UTC,"I understand depreciation.   and essentially I either save my downpayment- and have that 10k now. Or if I pay that 10k, when I sell the car the loan will be 10k less so I will make it back then.   If I buy a car for 10k I'm looking at 70-80k miles. If I buy it outright I'm out 10k cash up front. And then the additional repairs and maintenance it requires because of the age/mileage of the vehicle. Plus the inconvenience of having a car in the shop."

So that absolutely means paying it down entirely before the end of the night tonight.  Your gut is absolutely right that paying off the credit card ASAP is the best thing to do. But that doesn't necessarily mean you put 0 down. You will have $4k left to put down on a car. That's fine.   Personally, If I had $4k, I'd buy a car for $4k. If you want to get a more expensive car, go for the lowest interest rate and shortest term you can afford with that $4k down payment.   When I was in your shoes, I needed a new car, and only had $8k to spend. So I got a 4 year old Chevy Impala for $8k. best decision ever. Insurance only costs me like $40 a month."

But you've said you want to replace it in a few years when you're making more money. Why not get a nice new to you car with that cash and then save up a car payment for the next few years. Then you can get whatever it is you have in mind because with such a short period of ownership it doesn't sound like this car is it.
personalfinance,3dyj1g,orochiman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:48:29 2015 UTC,"By your own admission you are going to ""need a new car"" in 3-4 years, why would you possibly spend that much on a car in your current standing? You have 35k in student loans, you have 6k in credit card debt. Why not buy a 4 year old kia or something, we just got a forte koup for 9k and pay cash for it. Lower insurance, lower investment, it has 50k now, by 100k you'll be trading it in, in that time you car eliminate all your cc debt, and most of your student loan debt. Yea, MS3's are nice, until they break, and the repairs will be more expensive, and your warranty likely won't cover all the possibilities. If you treat the kia nice you can still sell it for 4-5k or more in a few years, and you'll be in a much better financial standing to do so.  This is of course assuming that you'll take that advice. But your responses sound less like you want advice, and more like your mind is made up, and you want someone to come in with some miraculous reason why you're right, which I doubt you're gonna get here."

First of all, the engine mounts on the MS3 are bad, period. Second of all, the transmission limits torque in 1st gear - that should be enough to tell you that the components are quite stressed. Third of all, the same engine in the CX-7 often suffered turbo failures. Fourth of all, Mazda 3's like to rust. Even the newest generation GT model rusts after just 1 years around the spot welds on the hatch lid.  I would consider a Fiat 500 Abarth if you want something sporty.

During high school i became sick, wasnt even able to finish my finals. Had a shitty father, was very violent and wasnt there for us financially. He ended up taking a loan behind our back and our house is about to be taken but the issue is still in court Sickness got worse, lost my ability to walk. Attempted suicide by overdosing but didnt work. My mother became diagnosed with depression and had to take a leave from her teaching job. Her depression affected her. She even attempted suicide. My sickness and pain got so bad, almost died once at the ER. My mother couldnt take it anymore and wanted to go back to her home, but she didnt wanna leave me behind so she decided to stay with my father. Basic stuff like getting food to eat became a challenge. Life had no meaning at all. I started a business from home. Its been growing abit and i am able to pay my family's bills now.

Younger people tend to get caught up in the here and now (myself included when I was your age), but the choices you make now can shape your financial behavior for later in life... how can your current job help you get a better job or make more money in the future, how can you use your income to work toward your financial goals.   For example, if you get in the habit of saving a portion or % of your income now, it won't be as daunting when you make more money or have higher expenses later in life. You'll be setup to save for larger purchases (home, car, retirement or fun things traveling, hobbies, etc.)."

Save as much as possible, but you should be able to have some fun with your hard-earned money.  Using my own experience as an example - When I was near the end of high school, I worked a retail job in the summer and saved money to cover some college expenses (primarily textbooks and some living expenses while at school - my parents covered room/board), and continued to work weekends during the school year. The summer before my last year of college, I split time between the retail job and an accounting internship. By the end of college, my savings goals had expanded to include CPA Exam review, upcoming summer trips, car payments, and revamping my wardrobe for my first ""real world"" job."

personalfinance,3dzboj,loopy212,2,Mon Jul 20 19:43:36 2015 UTC,"Even assuming 20% capital gains taxes, the effect of the down payment should be much more. I've edited my post to make this more clear.  I also checked the PMI theory by finding that the monthly cost of increasing the down payment is linear all the way from 0% to 100%. That implies that there is no thresholding going on where 10% down payments have to pay PMI but not 20%."
personalfinance,3dzboj,loopy212,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:59:14 2015 UTC,Yeah it looks like one of those equations where a zero term or series of zero terms messes up the whole thing.  If you have more realistic assumptions then the results aren't replicated.
personalfinance,3dzboj,rnelsonee,2,Mon Jul 20 20:22:15 2015 UTC,"Or in other words, every $10,000 invested in the down payment is an effective $43.90 / per month increase in monthly price   That only happens with a 9% investment rate of return and a 30-year mortgage. Change that and the $43.90 changes. For example at 10% and 30 years, it's exactly $50.  I might play with it more when I get home, but my initial thought is that the calculator simply doesn't account for comparing down payments, because it's not designed to. Since it only compares buying to renting, it never asks you how much you have to invest now becaue that's not in your housing budget. To the calculator, it can only calculate opportunity costs by runnign the numbers on investing your down payment - it doesn't know that you have $200,000 in the bank if you only put $100,000 down. So in essence, you're comparing two different people by changing that down payment. You'd like it to be one guy with $200k investing (or putting down) $200k vs a guy with $200k investing $100k. But the calculator just sees a guy with $200k investing $200k and a guy with $100k investing $100k."

But let's do the math:    A McChicken costs $1 and has 14 grams of protein (http://nutrition.mcdonalds.com/getnutrition/nutritionfacts.pdf). That's 7.1 cents/gram.  A pound of boneless, skinless chicken breast currently costs $3.18. A 3.5 oz serving has 21.2 grams of protein, so that's 3.3 cents/gram.    Where I live, you'd also pay a 10% tax on those McChickens and zero tax on groceries. Also, the McChicken has a lot more fat and is bad for you."
personalfinance,3dtx8l,Qwerksss,4,Sun Jul 19 21:54:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly. There was an article called ""Being poor is very expensive"" (or something like that): if you can't afford a pound of chicken and you need to buy a 1$ menu, you are wasting a lot of money.

personalfinance,3dtx8l,CorpCarrot,13,Sun Jul 19 22:29:26 2015 UTC,"Or as Terry Pratchett explained it:    “The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.  Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.  But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.  This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.”"

personalfinance,3dtx8l,Qwerksss,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:37:50 2015 UTC,"Also, the McChicken has a lot more fat and is bad for you.   There's really no such thing as an explicitly ""bad"" food, it depends on the context. Someone who's always been a healthy weight and has trouble eating enough can eat McChickens without it causing them health problems. Similarly you can't just say fat is bad, certain types of fats in certain ratios can certainly be bad, but ""fat"" as a general category is not some mythical health bogeyman.   I think it should be obvious that if you're already overweight, eating McDonalds is not doing you any favors. But we need to stop pretending that just because it's fast food it's instantly going to clog the arteries of a healthy person.

personalfinance,3dtx8l,Colonial_Morphology,4,Sun Jul 19 21:38:26 2015 UTC,"The average that I've seen is more like 25-30k. But that might be federal student loans, not total."
personalfinance,3dtx8l,Dockirby,2,Sun Jul 19 23:55:46 2015 UTC,"I'm a college student in my last year of school. In my personal experience, between my own financial situation and those who I know, 25-30k is pretty much the minimum. I only know 2 people who are going to graduate with less than 20k in debt. One of them recieved a lot of scholarships and the other had free tuition because his parent worked at the university.   I went to a inexpensive, but well credited, state university for the first 5 years. It took me 5 years because I changed my major during my 1st year and also pursued 2 degrees. At $4100 (which is not expensive at all when it comes to college) per semester I racked up about 35k in debt over the 5 years (my parents helped me  out as well).  I chose to go to the more expensive medical school to do the clinical rotations for my final degree but it was definitely the right choice for me. I took out 30k in student loans and got 8k in grants, because I'm no longer a dependent of my parents, this last year. Tuition is 22k and it's impossible to have a job while in the program so I live off student loans. I could have saved 10k by going to the other school I was accepted to but it just didn't feel right for me. By the time I graduate I will be close to 70k in debt. If I could go back and do everything over I could probably have cut that down to 60k.   Either way a bachelor degree done in 4 years would be a bargain at less than 35k. I actually don't know too many people who have completed a bachelor degree in 4 years. 4 and a half to 5 seems to be the norm.  I will still make back all of the money I spent on my education within the first year of having a job. It will obviously take me at least 10 years to pay it all off but I'm not worried about it. Both of my degrees complement each other and are in fields that have a retiring workforce so jobs are easy to find."
personalfinance,3dtx8l,Colonial_Morphology,2,Mon Jul 20 05:10:23 2015 UTC,"I graduated with 15k, but I also had scholarships near the start and worked the entire time. I likely could have gotten out debt free if I didn't fuck up as much and end up attending for 7 years"
personalfinance,3dtx8l,XxmagiksxX,2,Mon Jul 20 05:22:36 2015 UTC,I worked the entire time during my undergrad as well. I worked 20 hours a week during the school year and 40-50 during the summer. That was my money to live on. I still had to pay for all of  my education through loans. I applaud those who are able to get out of college with minimal debt but doesn't seem to be the norm. I was stupid and never tried in high school so I never got any scholarships. I'll be the first to admit that I could have saved myself a rediculous amount of money if I would have tried a little harder and saved more when I was younger. When you're a young high school/college student the debt doesn't seem like a big deal because it's years away. I've preached to my younger brother about the importance of good grades and responsible money management because I want him to be better if than I have ended up. He has actually done an amazing job and will be much better off than me.   Most of my friends are very ambitious hard working students and student loans are a pretty normal topic of conversation. Of the people I have actually talked to about student debt (roughly 40-60 people) most are going to end up with at least 40k in student loans that they have to pay off.

Yes it is not like a bank account where the funds become yours every year but think of it this way.   Apple computer is worth 100 billion this year (making this up they are worth almost 1 trillion right now). Company grows 5% this year, and is worth 105B next year.

Regarding the growth in Apple, isn't it just as easy that the company stops growing, or even starts declining? I know that we are just talking about a single company here, but once can see their 401k portfolio simply erase prior growth (potentially many years of it) when things go wrong..."
personalfinance,3dz5uj,ChiantiAndFavaBeans,2,Mon Jul 20 18:55:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly it sounds like you have trouble understanding a couple things. The first is compounding. Those 2 extra years from starting at 22 would have been growing for 6 and 7 years. The amounts from those two years would have approximately doubled. Look at this chart. Just 10 extra years in the market more than doubles your investment, because of compounding.  The other thing you're not considering is the professional handling your funds. You don't buy Apple and hold it forever. You don't buy a declining company and hold it all the way to the bottom. Your index funds will regularly be re-balanced based on a professional's management. If the professional managing FUNDX has holdings in typewriters in the 1970s, then as the 1980s and 1990s come, the holdings will shift from typewriters to computers."
personalfinance,3dz5uj,Frozenlazer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:02:12 2015 UTC,"Hmm...I do understand compounding. I think my issue is skepticism about the returns that I will experience. I suppose I just have to keep contributing and, like other people have said, just hope things continue to grow (and by things, I suppose I mean the world, haha).  The index fund that I am invested in (FFNOX) is about 59% domestic stock, 25% foreign, 14% bonds, 2% other. Admittedly, the bonds are a bit high. Expense ratio is .24%.  I think I just need to shake off my skepticism and let things just play out, as I feel like the index fund I am in is fine - it is considered an aggressive growth mix."

You also should also run some numbers to see how much financial aid you might qualify for.  If your parents have a low income, you may qualify for some grant money as well as scholarships.  Unless your grades are extremely high (4.0+) and you have really high test scores, getting a full-ride scholarship is unlikely.  Even then, full-rides are rare.  (I heard my state flagship university gives out 14 full ride scholarships a year in a freshman class of 3500.)  If possible, living at home and attending community college is a good way to get started on a college education at a lower cost.  Living at home and commuting to a local university is also cost effective."

personalfinance,3dz4ff,Notorsb1,4,Mon Jul 20 18:58:45 2015 UTC,Most people here who advocate for Ally use it strictly as an Online Savings Account. They put their emergency fund/short term liquidity in there because it's interest rate is far superior to that offered at most brick and mortar banks. Therefore issues such as overdraft fees and the like are irrelevant because the account isn't being used for everyday banking.  I use Ally and personally could not care less what their overdraft fees are as there is a 0% chance I will ever have that issue. The account functions purely as a savings account for my emergency fund.

personalfinance,3dz2zf,whiteraven4,3,Mon Jul 20 18:36:47 2015 UTC,I think OP is talking about trying to get declared independent for FASFA purposes.
personalfinance,3dz2zf,crownjewel82,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:37:51 2015 UTC,"OK. I had a similar problem at the beginning of my undergraduate career and I was able to work it out with my dad so that he was providing the support to justify him claiming me and making up for my not being able to claim independent status.  If you're under the age of 26, unmarried, and you didn't claim yourself on your taxes this year then you might be stuck. The system is a pain in the ass but it's intended to keep kids whose parents should be supporting them from claiming resources meant for kids with no family or from families without means. When you fall on that borderline of not legally needing help but not having enough it sucks.   Your best bet, as has been suggested by /u/ChiantiAndFavaBeans and /u/hortonhearsatoot, is to talk to the financial aid office. Go now because the later it gets the longer the line gets and the more short tempered the staff gets (that could just be my school though). They helped me find some scholarship money that kept me in school while I was still sorting out things with my dad.  Your second option is a private student loan. Fair warning. Private loan companies are ridiculous. I applied for a loan to go back to school as a 30 something homeowner with gainful employment and a good credit score. They wanted me to have a parent cosign. I explained that I was over 30 and that my parents were dead. They basically told me I was SOL.  Your third option is to hold off on school for this year, get a job (yes I know that's difficult), claim yourself next year, and then reapply for financial aid as an independent student. It sucks but it's better than waiting around for your family to help you."
personalfinance,3dz2zf,whiteraven4,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:56:51 2015 UTC,I thought it was 24? I could be mistaken though. And claiming yourself on your taxes is irrelevant for FASFA purposes. You can be independent for tax purposes and dependent for FASFA purposes.
personalfinance,3dz2zf,crownjewel82,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:20:41 2015 UTC,You're right it is 24.  As far as the tax thing is concerned I was not allowed to get my status changed because my dad was claiming me on his taxes. It may have been that the staff at my school were full of shit but I recall my dependent status being determined by their interpretation of my FAFSA.
personalfinance,3dz2zf,ekcunni,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:36:11 2015 UTC,"Independent status on your taxes won't really have anything to do with student loans.  If you haven't filled out the FAFSA, you should do that. Your school will likely advise you to do so before they'll do anything else anyway, and you can see through that if you'll be eligible for federal aid.   $8k isn't a ridiculous amount if that's all you'll end up with for student loans, and it's likely you'd be able to acquire that through the federal government."

All they (Barclays) care about is getting their money back once the promotion expires. Alternatively, you can call Barclays and pay off your student loans that way as well whereby they send a payment from your card to pay off the student loan. Works the same as a balance transfer and has the same terms and conditions as what you have now. Not sure what Barclays' procedure is but all you'd need to provide them with an address and account number.   The only downside in all this would be the transaction fee's. Also remember you'd have to making at least the minimum payment towards the Barclays card every month."
personalfinance,3dz2z8,Kilifi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:35:12 2015 UTC,"Some people do play this balance transfer game.  The problem with paying off student loans by this method is that you'd have to keep balance transferring forever.  The 4 or 6 percent you're paying on student debt is well below the 14 percent annual average rate on credit cards. Every year, you'll have to find a new balance transfer deal or be hit with high credit-card interest."
personalfinance,3dz2y9,Merker8564,2,Mon Jul 20 18:21:29 2015 UTC,"No, it won't be affected. Carrying debt for the purposes of a credit score is dumb anyways. You can open a Roth IRA at any time. You could open one right now. It shouldn't cost you anything to open one, so idk why you are talking about $1000. You just can't make any contributions unless you have earned income for that tax year, and you cannot contribute more than you have earned. So if you've earned no income in tax year 2015, you can contribute $0 to your IRA. In 2016, once you start making $50k/year you can contribute up to the maximum ($5500 for 2015) to your IRA."

But if the upgrades increase your value at least dollar for dollar of the cost, then in theory the new appraisal would get out of PMI anyway. So I'd lean towards that.  But see what you contract says (2 year minimum? Is an appraisal needed? Does market appreciate count towards the new valuation? All of these are variables) and call your lender. After calling mine for example, I learned they were fine with whatever Zillow said, so I didn't have to bother with the new appraisal, and was able to remove it right at the 2 year mark (my minimum)."

The summer before my junior year of high school (back in 2000) I got my first part time job, working as a teller at a bank. I had the best job out of any of my friends, and made the most. It paid above minimum wage and I received regular raises. Not to mention the schedule was awesome and I still had time for homework every night (kept grades up!). Junior year I worked 3-4 days during the week, 3-6:30 and Saturdays 9-2 (full weekend bank hours). Senior year was 1-6:30 and till 2 on Saturdays. Had my weekend evenings and Sundays totally off. Summers I worked as much as they'd schedule me, which was a lot because I proved myself a hard worker and customers liked me. Also once I started college, the bank did a partial tuition reimbursement deal if you kept your grades up, so I had part of college paid for just from working. I highly recommend looking into this.

Do you actually get taxed on this when you're basically renting the car from the company at $200/month?

Lets say 300 a month, then you take out the 200 you pay to use it, so that just give you a 100 a month benefit, 80% of it is personal, so then you are only getting an 80 a month taxable benefit?

Could quit claim his undivided 1/4 interest in the property to the other 3/4 interest holders. He could get them to pay for this by threatening to sell his 1/4 interest to another party. It is challenging to sell a partial ownership like this, but not impossible. If it's a vacation home it's probably a lot easier. Alternatively, he could just quit claim his interest to the 3/4 interest holders for some nominal amount of money if he just wants to escape the property taxes/utilities. He's walking away from the full value of his equity share if he does this, but he avoids the expenses he's incurring. He could consider filing a partition suit for the property. You'd have to consult with a lawyer in your state to determine if this would work out for him. I deal with a lot of estate/probate issues in my job, and partition suits are frequently the result when decedents will real property to their heirs in fractional shares. A lot of the time fractional ownership doesn't work due to interpersonal/financial issues as outline above, or the value/utility of the property is significantly affected by having fractional ownership (think a working farm, or a parcel of land with significant mineral value).

One thing he'll want to make sure is done right (and it seems like it is) is taxes - you don't want back-taxes to jeopardize the entire property, and one person shouldn't be paying them on their own (this happened to us). When the property was finally sold, the tax payments were deducted from the person who didn't pay's portion in our case.  Utilities are easy - if it's not generating income, don't have them turned on. If others want to be there, that's on them. If it's a property in the north, you'll need to winterize it before turning off the heat. If you're in a really southern humid climate, it's harder to get away without dehumidification/A/C.  As /u/Notorsb1 mentioned, the other relatives can buy his portion off of him if they want and have the financial means. Otherwise, it's his prerogative to sell off his share to an investor.

OK, here's a quick tip, that will likely work better in the city than in the burbs, but should be ok there too.  If you need a quick job doing something....ANYTHING...go restaurants.  I'm not talking about a McJob, although McDonalds or Tims are usually hiring for general staff.  I mean like Jack Astors or East Side Marios, something along those lines.  The kitchens virtually always need help of some kind or another, they'll generally feed you, and they're also generally loaded with younger college types who are also looking for roommates, or know people who are.  As fresh starts go, there are far worse things to do, and you can likely do it through college/university as well."

Worst case scenario, you're washing dishes or bussing tables for minimum wage. Turn-over in restaurants is insane, so unless you're a total chucklehead they'll be wanting to train you on more shit and moving you on up.

personalfinance,3du416,HallowSingh,6,Sun Jul 19 16:20:48 2015 UTC,"Eh, it depends. I know a guy who just gave his 23 year old the boot. After warning him for two months, the dad made his move after the kid went to work one day. He loaded all of the kids stuff into the back of his pickup, drove it down to the local U-Store, and loaded it into a unit that he'd prepaid 4 months on. Then he changed the locks on his house.  When the kid came home, the dad met him on the porch and handed him the key to his shiny new storage unit. The kid had the temerity to call the cops, but they just shrugged their shoulders at it and told him to ""sue him and take it up with the judge"". When the kid came back an hour later and kicked the back door in, the police carted him off to jail for a couple of days.   When it comes to parents kicking out troublesome kids (the 23 year old was a drug using shithead), not many people really care about the finer points of the law. I've known MANY people who have had to give their kids a hard shove to get them out of the house. I've only known ONE who got an eviction order...and that ""kid"" was living in a granny flat behind the main house with his live-in girlfriend and two of his own kids, so it was a bit of a special case."

personalfinance,3du416,Fallout4motherfucker,3,Sun Jul 19 21:40:40 2015 UTC,"Since you have somewhere to stay until you finish school, I would do that. Then see about getting a job and a cheap place to live. Look into going somewhere near a university and find out about staying with students. Living on your own on a minimum wage job (which is a likely option for someone who needs job quickly out of high school) is expensive, but you should probably do that for maybe a year before you start getting into debt to go to university. Student rent is comparatively cheap and 99% of students live with other people, making the rent much cheaper than it would be otherwise.  Post-secondary education is important, and I definitely think it's something you should attempt, but there's no reason you should have to do it right away. Get a job and get back on your feet first.  Once you have a firm job and maybe a bit of savings, look into scholarships and financial assistance for school. OSAP is particularly good - they will often award you a loan for more than the tuition of your university to help you pay for living expenses while in school. It's not much extra and you'll likely need a part-time job to cover the remaining expenses.  Look into schools that offer co-op programs. The University of Waterloo has a pretty intensive co-op program. It's a bit of a hassle in a lot of ways, but getting income every other semester is a real life-saver for someone in a situation like yours, and can often mean that you don't need to keep a part-time job while you're in class.  Lastly, check out r/Frugal and /r/EatCheapAndHealthy - they'll be life-savers for you. Living on a limited income with no savings is pretty hard, but it's possible. They'll be able to help you figure out how to do it. Most important things are to avoid going out for meals and avoid spending money on frivolous things.  And lastly, I don't know much about the military option, but I do know that the military will pay for university for at least some of its members. I have no idea how this works, but the Royal Military College exists for that purpose, so that might be something to check into as well!"

IMO trade > military because the military does take a toll on you (both mentally and physically).  As others have mentioned, try to reconcile with family. Life is hard until you get your legs under you, and having a roof over your head (even if you have to keep up with your parents' bullshit for a while) could be well worth it in the long run.  Also try to leave the job next to your old place on as good terms as possible. You'll need the reference. (You need to ask your direct supervisor for this too, and make sure he/she is okay with giving you one. If not, it will complicate matters.)  And try to get a source of income ASAP, as others have said too. Are you a bold/confident person? You're about to become one. You need to go print off a stack of resumes (like 30) at the local library and go apply to a bunch of jobs. Which jobs? All of them. Whatever town you're in, walk into every restaurant/store and ask to speak with the manager. If not, still leave a resume, but speaking with the manager increases your chances a lot. Going during off-hours will make them more likely to talk to you, and some may even interview you on the spot. Have a phone? Good.

I would look at applying to Ontario Works in your community right away.  If you are not paying rent (with a lease signed)  you'll at least be able to get the basic needs portion of a cheque (about $300/mo. depending on where you live).  If you find a room or apartment to rent they will release the shelter portion (about $450)  If you are planning to go to university you can look at applying for OSAP once you get accepted somewhere.  However that is a loan and you will not be able to collect Ontario Works while collecting OSAP.

personalfinance,3du416,vancitything,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:49:14 2015 UTC,"Hey, I know some people who have been in your situation. I'm from Ontario. Just so you know, they all pulled it off and are successful now.   First, have you looked into OSAP? It will likely pay for your (humble) living expenses and tuition while you're in university. I think the max you can get is around $14,000 a year. To compare, tuition for 1 year at a Canadian university is around $7000. Get a part time job at your university. Usually there are jobs saved for kids with OSAP. Most universities have bursaries offered that will get you around $1000 every year, and if your grade 12 grades are good you can also get around $2000/year every year from your school. I don't think you need to worry too much about life once you get into university. You should be okay, just don't blow away all of your money on pizza and beer.  Also, applying to university is $150 and you get 3 choices.  Additional choices cost more. You might have to pay with a credit card (this may have changed), and I THINK you can apply for a refund though. It's done through the OUAC website and I believe you do this around November/December. It has been a few years for me."

These are trades that will give you a ticket you can use outside of the military and give you experience in the workplace and all your training paid for.

If you decide the military is for you, maybe you can reclass when you reenlist (I dunno how the Canadian military works, but I assume its similar to US), but when you're so stretched thin with so few options, you want to make the first enlistment as worthwhile as possible.

On the other hand - fortunately - you will come out a stronger person. It's all part of growing up.   I really felt compelled to write because i was kicked out at 18 as well. I'm now 26. I'm doing fine now, love what i do, but it wasnt easy for the first year. It was actually hell. I dont want to scare you, but you will find out everything the hard way, you will get hurt (physically and emotionally), people will take advantage of you, and at some point those people that are your friends now will get tired of your situation and eventually you.   I got kicked out because i didnt follow ""house rule"" which at that time i thought were stupid and which now i think are pretty reasonable. My father and i didnt know how to communicate, but i knew he loved me. I actually was kicked out three times before and i always went back home. But the final time it stuck cause i didnt give my father any other choice.   My advise to you is you can make it either way. Try to make up with your dad - have a plan, share it passionately, only look forward,and try to see it his way. You will save yourself a lot of heartache and hurt. Stay away from the wrong crowd (youre vulnerable and easy pray), dont do drugs (its a steady downward spiral, guaranteed) and for heaven's sake dont get anyone pregnant. Try to find a counsellor,a professional who knows what they are talking about. Get a job, help out, do anything useful to others.   I hope you and your dad can make up. I never had the opportunity to make up with my dad. Time just created a deeper rift. I should have done the first step because i was the one who screwed up. My father died a month ago - the day before Fathers Day and i have never loved my father more than i do now.   Which ever path you choose, all the best to you. My heart goes out to both of you."

End of sentence.  Insurance companies are not in the business to pay out claims. They are in the business of collecting premiums and NOT paying them out (and they have this down to a science with their risk models and the like...). And when they have to pay out a claim they sick their lawyers on responsible party's insurance to get every penny they paid out back.  So honestly, do yourself a favor and get a lawyer.

personalfinance,3dyr7q,Vangalius,2,Mon Jul 20 17:00:16 2015 UTC,"Nobody can tell you which method will be better, as nobody can predict how your alternative investments will perform.  It's the classic question of paying down a debt at a fixed interest rate versus trying your luck somewhere else.  It's your choice.  From ""I Have $[X] ... What Do I Do With It?!"":   Should I be in a hurry to pay off lower interest loans? What rate is ""low"" enough to where I should just pay the minimum?  Depending on your attitude towards debt, you may want to stop paying off loans with low interest rates once you have paid all other loans above that threshold. A common argument is that the long-term return from investments in the stock market will likely exceed the interest rate from a low-interest loan. While this has been true in the past, keep in mind that paying down a loan is a guaranteed return at the loan's interest rate. Stock performance is anything but guaranteed. Fairly common consensus is that loans above 4% interest should be paid off early in the debt reduction phase, while anything under that can be stretched out."

personalfinance,3dyr7q,ebmoney,2,Mon Jul 20 17:22:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. I'm 39, so I am very interested in not having to wait until I'm 69 to be free of my mortgage payment.  So assuming that I do want to pre-pay in one fashion or another, what I'm hearing is that it would only make sense to hold on to the money and pay a lump sum down the road if the investments are going to yield a higher percent return than the interest rate of the mortgage.  Assuming a 4% interest rate, if I had $200 extra a month for this, and I could get 6% from an investment, that would be better than giving the bank extra principal payments. But if I just put the $200 into a savings account and got 2% on it, it would be better to give that $200 to the lender instead.  Is that right?  How does the mortgage amortization schedule impact this calculation?"
personalfinance,3dyr7q,evaned,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:13:48 2015 UTC,"Should we make extra principal payments very month? Or take that money and instead and save/invest it until we can pay off the mortgage with a lump sum?   If you view your choice as between three options:   Prepay nothing ever and carry the mortgage for 30 years, investing the extra Invest and save extra until you can pay down the balance, then do so Prepay as you go   My opinion is that #2 is the worst of both worlds rather than the best of both worlds. If you think that your investments would do better than your mortgage rate, it makes sense to do #1. If you think investments will do worse, it makes sense to do #3.  If you're unsure and want to hedge to reduce risk, it feels intuitively to me like it makes more sense to hedge by taking your extra money and splitting it between investing some and prepaying some, doing both #1 and #3 at the same time (but in less measures). Now, where there you fall on that scale is up to you (as aBoglehead says), but I don't like #2 personally."

I'm assuming that the ~$11,000 I'm responsible for this year has to be taken out in private student loans, right?   You can get more Federal loans if your parents apply for a PLUS and are denied.   Should I borrow the $8,000 number stated in my financial aid package that doesn't take into account indirect costs or take out the $11,000 from the federal financial aid website that does?   I'd stick to close to the $8000 and work instead.   If I'm taking out a private loan, should I multiply the number I'll need or this year by 4 and take it out for all four years?   You can only apply for one year's worth at a time. But it's a good idea to THINK about what the 4 year total will be. You can get additional Federal loans in later years, and you usually become eligible for more scholarships later. Not to mention moving out of the dorm will same you money.

Depending on the loan terms, thay might start accumulating interest as soon as you get the money, so make sure you educate yourself. My wife was the worst borrower in history. I just paid off a $37,000 loan in full. She had originally borrowed $25,000 in 2005, paid an agreed upon low amount for years!, and still owed $37,000 10 years later. All because she didn't understand the ins and outs of borrowing. I would advise against student loan debt at all costs. If you can work part time and make a few bucks I would highly recommend it.

Depending on where specifically you live, those rights can be very different.  For example, my previous landlord took money out of our deposit, some of the things were reasonable, some were not.  When we pressured him to return the monies that were unreasonably removed, he refused.  In Chicago, tenants have a significant amount of power.  There are a set of rules that dictate exactly how a security deposit is to be stored, accounted for, etc. as well as how the landlord must account for all costs in a physically documented itemized list.   We contacted a lawyer after a cursory review of the law led us to believe that the lease as well as the way the security deposit was handled in a way not in accordance with the law.  When that is the case, the lessee is entitle to a punitive damage in the amount of the full security deposit + the security deposit itself + whatever was not paid back.  We hired a lawyer, sued the landlord, and settled within 45 days for the full amount after landlords lawyer tried to bluff us back down.  The lawyer's fees are actually governed by this law to be paid by the landlord so the only cost to us was the initial retainer.    3 roommates walked away with almost 6K."

personalfinance,3dx64g,randomghost,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:58:37 2015 UTC,File a small claims court. Depending on the lease that you have and her financial situation you can probably get some $$ out of her and get her off the lease.   First step is to talk to the landlord. Be advised that landlord can ask for a bigger deposit as there will be less people accountable for the lease.
personalfinance,3dx64g,dontgivethemyourssn,7,Tue Jul 21 04:27:47 2015 UTC,"The first thing I would do is talk to the landlord and see if they'll let you break or transfer the lease.

Typically hospitals only receive a fraction of that amount even with insurance, think maybe 20-30%. So like 1000 bucks maybe.   I'm assuming this was an ER visit.  If has been many years and they clearly made an error. You might go with ""I'm assuming had I had insurance you would have received no more than 800 or 1000 dollars for this. Look I don't have a job, and this was 8 years ago, so will you take 400? I can give you that today, but I want this cleared from my account and a letter in writing that the debt is paid in full"".   Alternatively, you are unemployed, if they aren't sending it to collections and aren't reporting it, you might want to wait until you have a job.   Also wouldn't matter if you had insurance now.

Get that answered by the county.   Certainly no harm in calling the county and talking about this debt and telling them you are in a tight spot, and need to understand the consequences at least as a first step.

personalfinance,3dzhdm,decaturbob,3,Mon Jul 20 20:38:29 2015 UTC,"""illegal"" just means ""against the law"" it doesn't necessarily imply the state would punish you with jail or fines. There are laws specifically for civil matters and they provide for civil judgments and fines.   In many places not paying your rent is illegal and a court can make a judgment that you must pay whether the lease is verbal or written.  Also as /u/holpuch09 said it does not make the place unlivable so withholding the whole months rent would open the OP up to a lot of costs that she really does not want to incur.  With all that being said, some US states provide for minor repairs being done by the tenant if the damage was not caused by the tenant. Here is an example from Arizona    Repairs Costing Less Than ½ Month’s Rent or $300 If a rental unit is in need of minor repair(s), and the damage(s) were not caused by the tenant, tenant’s family or guests, the landlord will probably be responsible for making the repair(s). The law requires you first give your landlord written notice of the problem, stating the landlord has 10 days to make the repair(s). If the landlord fails to make the repair(s) after 10 days and the cost of the repair(s) will be less than the greater of ½ month’s rent or $300, you must hire a licensed contractor and get a lien release and either forward the bill to your landlord or pay for the repair yourself and deduct it from your next rental payment. A copy of the bill and the lien release must be included with your rent.   I would check to see if you have similar laws in the UK."

personalfinance,3dy1tw,gimmedatpen,3,Mon Jul 20 13:51:33 2015 UTC,"with the interest rates of an IRS payment plan.   So you decided to go with a credit card that has interest rates from 13%-26% or more?  You can do a balance transfer, but remember there will be a fee involved as well.  You need to assess and see if the fee will be less or more than the savings you get from the slightly lower interest rate on the new card."
personalfinance,3dy1tw,GreyWalker,2,Mon Jul 20 13:53:28 2015 UTC,Problem with that is that existing balance would be subject to interest until the whole balance transfer is paid off. Never transfer a balance when you have an existing balance on a card. I wouldn't suggest doing so.
personalfinance,3dy1tw,Kilifi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:53:28 2015 UTC,I didn't know that but thanks for the info.  Any suggestions as to what I should do in this situation?
personalfinance,3dy1tw,Kilifi,2,Mon Jul 20 15:00:14 2015 UTC,A loan or get approved for another card with 0% on BT's with enough available credit to fit your balances.

personalfinance,3dy1tw,GIA15,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:17:53 2015 UTC,Im sorry I think I misunderstood. Have u paid off the whole card? If so then yes u can transfer both cards if there's a 0% offer.
personalfinance,3dy1tw,constantino1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:30:34 2015 UTC,"No, if I transfer the balance from it or if I pay it off with a loan, should I cancel 1-2 of the empty cards?  One has a 10.99% APR but a $1000 limit; the other has a 19.99% APR and $2500 limit.  One is an Amex that I got about $20 a month cash back for buying only gas and groceries for months since I got it until I had to put taxes on it, so I don't want to cancel that one.  I liked how it worked in that context."
personalfinance,3dy1tw,constantino1,2,Mon Jul 20 15:49:59 2015 UTC,"The best option is to get a new card with 0% and transfer. Chase Slate is great for this. The Chase site is fairly accurate as to whether you will get approved for the cards you are ""pre-approved"" for so I would check. Then transfer your whole balance (they must be non-Chase cards to do this). Then do NOT spend anything on the card, as they will likely apply payments to your purchases not to your balance transfer."
personalfinance,3dy1tw,Workdawg,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:53:13 2015 UTC,"Chase Slate, balance transfer, put it in a drawer and forget about it except the payments.  Sounds like what I'll probably do."
personalfinance,3dy1tw,constantino1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:33:40 2015 UTC,"I doubt you'll get a bank loan, but you can try.  The bigger question really depends what the rates are and how much you are paying each month.  When you do the transfer, you'll get hit with a 3% fee.  You might recoup that if the interest rate is significantly lower and you plan to take that many months to repay the debt."
personalfinance,3dy1tw,pho1701,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:56:56 2015 UTC,"One is 10.99%, another is 19.99%, and the one that just raised the credit limit is currently at 0.00% but will go to 16.99% in December."
personalfinance,3dy1tw,pho1701,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:00:44 2015 UTC,"Probably worth transferring then, for sure if you are paying it off by December.  If it will take much longer, that 10.99% balance may be better off where it is."

personalfinance,3dy1tw,PhillyITguy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:12:19 2015 UTC,"0% on purchases, or 0% on BT? They usually have different rates. Also, what's the fee? At the usual 3-5%, that's better than your 11-20% for sure either way I guess.  I'd look into applying for a new CC. Chase Slate offers 0% interested AND 0% fees for introductory transfers. Looks like the current offer is 15mo interest free."

Do the math, but from what I see here you seem in pretty decent shape.   Just make sure you have an E fund to cover what will inevitably break after you move in"
personalfinance,3dzdqd,wannabe_fi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:43:35 2015 UTC,"I would say that you are actually ready financially in terms of US standards and behavior when it comes to house purchasing. You have the down payment, on track to get a raise, and have margins to save. But if you're really looking to create wealth for yourself your mortgage and the amount you're spending is very high.   I personally am looking at tinier homes, a small two bedroom house  would be a reasonable purchase for 3 people. You should look at foreclosed homes in your area. A 2 bedroom house shouldn't run more than 150k. However, I'm personally looking in the 30-70k range. What's great about buying foreclosed is that if and when you're ready to upgrade, you can hire a broker, and sell the house at market price and actually make a profit that you can put to your next upgraded home.   I recommend always starting small, then upgrading to something larger when the time is right. Never rush to buy a house, sooner is not better, even if the values rise, periodically the housing market declines as well and that's when we see home owners go underwater, and begin building negative equity. If you play your cards right you can find the same house you're looking at at a fraction of the cost. For your boy, be methodological and think long term instead of emotional and short term so that you can also take these savings and pass it on to his tuition and support that he needs. The money is more valuable for your kid than the house, he will need school, clothes, his own home some day, he may even want to live else where in the future."

personalfinance,3dzdqd,BradyandBondscheatin,0,Tue Jul 21 18:34:55 2015 UTC,Not unreasonable just would wait to see where your wife finds a job before moving. Mortgage rates will probably increase so the sooner might be better option than waiting for your wife to find a job. Just get a fixed mortgage. Also if you have good credit the mortgage payment will be the same as your rent but you will have to pay insurance for your home plus all expenses that come with fixing a property.
personalfinance,3dzbsa,Westbrook000,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:23:54 2015 UTC,"The system sucks, and is very unfair for folks in your situation. The short answer is you need to keep paying.  You have a 90 day grace period in which you will not be cancelled for not paying your premium.  Unfortunately, if you haven't paid your bill for that currently invoiced month you may be refused service in the following month (30 days when you're officially paying late - there are no late payment fees, and your credit is not effected by not paying health insurance premiums). You could wait until the end of the coming month and hope it's resolved and everything is able to be leveled for the proper premium."
personalfinance,3dzblf,arbloch,4,Mon Jul 20 19:22:23 2015 UTC,"Even if you see a crash coming soon, if you put $1000 into your 401k and your employer matches $500, and you invest it in NOTHING, you make a 50% return, which is better than your student loans. So if you feel the need to time the market, which is a terrible idea, A TERRIBLE IDEA, put at least the match in the most conservative fund your 401k offers. That fund would have to lose almost 30% for you to get a worse return than putting it towards your student loans.  Remember that timing the market actually involves timing it twice. Timing it based on when you think it's going to drop and timing it based on when you think it's bottomed out and you can start investing again.  So I implore you to contribute up to the match and then use any leftovers to pay off your 6% loan."
personalfinance,3dzblf,ChiantiAndFavaBeans,2,Mon Jul 20 19:26:15 2015 UTC,"As far as your #2 from above. Some ""Financial Experts"" have been saying this for 2-3 years now, still hasn't happened. Also, your use of the word ""crash"" is hyperbolic, there may be a market downturn but a ""crash"" is a huge deal and is extremely unlikely. Don't try to time the market, only the very very very best investors are capable of doing this, and even they fail a decent percentage of the time.   Get your free money from the employer match at least, not doing so is a mistake."
personalfinance,3dzblf,ekoostikmartin,2,Mon Jul 20 19:28:46 2015 UTC,"If I were you'd, I'd contribute enough to get the full employer match, and put the rest of my savings into paying off the student loans.

personalfinance,3dy5ai,lilfunky1,2,Mon Jul 20 14:32:21 2015 UTC,"$300 a fortnight is pushing it in my opinion, however, that depends on the price of the area you are/going to live in. I'm in Aus too and currently struggle on $520 a fortnight (our rent is $521 per month each in the share house, but I also have pets and a car which puts a lot of weight on my budget).  If the rental amount also includes bills (such as in student share housing) that can be easier to budget around. Maybe look into what campus housing is like. Make a spread sheet on what you estimate bills to be (ie rent, phone, electricity, gas, internet, water), then think about how much living costs are (food, toiletries, petrol/public transport, etc). If you have a car, don't forget to factor that in to your budget somehow for services and stuff, or whatever extra expenses you may have. AND the killer when moving out: initial costs. Such as connecting electricity and gas (unless someone has freshly moved out so it would already be connected), internet, the bond payment, cooking utensils, appliances (do you have a fridge, washing machine, etc), so on so forth. ALTHOUGH most of these are covered in something like a student share house, where it is already furnished, connected, etc. So saves on initial costs. For that kind of budget, you'd probably be looking at a share house of some sort. But again, different areas have very different prices for all the different housing types. Spend some time casually browsing real estate sites to get an idea of the type of housing out there that would suit you.  And make sure to give some breathing room, if possible, to the budget. Just in case. :)  Look into Centrelink too, they can provide rent assistance or the Aus Study allowance to help take the edge off. They can be difficult/frustrating to deal with but it certainly can help.  Hope this helps somewhat! Or at least give you a point of reference to get started on what to plan/look at.

personalfinance,3dy5ai,catjuggler,2,Tue Jul 21 04:57:22 2015 UTC,Probably not.  Step one: find out how much things (such as rent) realistically cost.
personalfinance,3dy5ai,CatAkimbo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:42:33 2015 UTC,"I mean, look up what rent costs in your area to see what a minimum room-sharing situation would be. And then remember that you'd need to pay for utilities (unless included), transportation, and food AT MINIMUM on top of that. That's without any entertainment, beer or clothing money, and doesn't allow your emergency funds to ever increase.  I think the most likely answer is that if you move out on your own, you will need to take out student loans to keep afloat. That may or may not be a good idea depending on if you already will have loans to cover tuition, and exactly how bad your home situation is.  If you keep living at home, or if you are able to move in with a relative who won't charge you rent, then I would think that $600/month will keep you comfortably outfitted with discretionary funds without taking out any loans to cover your living expenses. And if you live frugally and have a lot of your food costs covered by your family, you could save a lot of that check and try to get an apartment in a couple of years."

personalfinance,3dyw5l,a_broke_idiot,6,Mon Jul 20 17:34:18 2015 UTC,So more or less $1.1-1.2k a month for expenses? I bring home about $1.8-2.2k a month after taxes.   Figure out where like $1k per month is disappearing to and you'll fix your problem.
personalfinance,3dyw5l,loopy212,2,Mon Jul 20 17:55:04 2015 UTC,This. Use something like mint.com to figure out where all your money is going.

personalfinance,3dyw5l,sanmadjack,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:21:17 2015 UTC,"That very well may be the case. Mint can seem horribly complicated due to a less-than-stellar interface, but it really does make it easy to keep track of how much you've spent and on what.  The alternative is to go through your spending by hand, which isn't the worst thing. If you use a credit or debit card for spending, you can usually get a transaction list from the card's web site. Pop it into Excel and just start labeling the transactions as stuff like ""Movies"" ""Food"" ""Rent"" and so on. Have Excel create a pie chart from the list and bam, you've got your spending charted out."
personalfinance,3dyw5l,loopy212,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:32:32 2015 UTC,"My math was actually a bit off looking back on the post, I only added for one paycheck for gas/groceries/misc.

I also didn't include me slowly paying off my car repairs, or things like going out to eat once in a while or pitching in for alcohol for a party, etc. in hindsight I probably should have. Plus buying furniture has dipped into my paychecks a lot too.   But you're right it seems like there is a lot of wiggle room after my main expenses. Maybe once I just pay these car repairs off I'll feel like I can breathe and start saving."
personalfinance,3dyw5l,daveman312,2,Mon Jul 20 19:11:40 2015 UTC,"It's still a major problem.  You'll get wiggle room and start saving when you get a budget.  Having a budget for everything but furniture, eating out and alcohol is sort of like being on a diet except for eating a half gallon of ice cream a week."
personalfinance,3dyw5l,sanmadjack,3,Mon Jul 20 19:21:54 2015 UTC,"Moving out has upped my expenses considerably between rent, the electric bill, grocery shopping, etc and plus the initial costs of moving out of your parents house for the first time is apparently insane. No one warned me unfortunately.   Welcome to being an adult - Almost everyone has felt this way at some point in their first year of living on their own. While you can't plan for everything, the trick is to have options - be prepared for the bad stuff when it happens, or have some flexibility when good opportunities come your way.   I can't keep up with him a lot of the time and it makes me feel like shit.   Why do you need to ""keep up"" with him? Aren't you two in this together now that you share an apartment? You both need to work together on developing a plan. How much of the living expenses will your boyfriend cover? It's unclear from your situation how much he is contributing to all of this.  From the info you listed, it sounds like you can net at least $600/month in savings (minimum $1800/month take home less $1200 living expenses). You can use this to start a small emergency fund first, then focus on saving for a different car.  I know it sucks, but get as many hours at work as you can for the next few months - That will help expedite your savings and help dig you out of this financial hole and give you some breathing room.  Lastly, I'd recommend reading The Total Money Makeover by Dave Ramsey. People on this sub have varying opinions of Dave Ramsey, but this book is a good read for people who need some financial direction. This will give you some ideas about how to make your plan."
personalfinance,3dyw5l,SilverSpooky,2,Mon Jul 20 17:55:07 2015 UTC,"By keeping up with him I mean like when he wants to order in or go out instead of cooking dinner, or when he wants to go to six flags or the movies or out somewhere, or when he wants to buy something new for the apartment. 99% of the time if I really can't afford it he covers for me without blinking an eye but I still feel awful about it. Plus there's the 1% of the time where he lets on that he's annoyed about paying for me which just makes the guilt sink in more. We split the rent 60/40 to make up for him paying my half of the security deposit, and we split the groceries and electric 50/50 but like I said he has less bills than I do so he has a lot more disposable income than I do and is just a lot more comfortable than I am financially speaking.   Like I mentioned in a previous comment, I think maybe I'm just suffocating under all the up front expenses of moving out plus paying off my car repairs. Like, hopefully once everything is settled and I'm not paying for furniture anymore or paying off my car repairs, my paychecks will start to catch up with my finances and I can breathe a little. Hopefully. Maybe. I just have to hang in there I guess.   I will definitely be checking out the book! Thank you for the recommendation, I can really use any help I can get."

It's kind of unfair for him to be annoyed at you when you could have stayed at home a few more months to get ahead.

personalfinance,3dyw5l,TinyBabyAlli,2,Mon Jul 20 19:19:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think I'm qualified to give you advice on your situation, but here is how I handle my money, you might get some useful ideas:  My salary is paid into one account. From this account I move the money into my other accounts. I know its a bit of a hasstle having lots of accounts, but it helps me keep track of my money and it works for me.   I have 1 bank account and all my known major expenses come out of this, rent etc. You know that you need to spend £x/month on these things so make sure that you have that much going into that account each month.   I then have a current account which is for every day expenses. Groceries, misc expenses etc. I keep the bare miminum I need in this account, and its the only account I regularly look at. I find that it helps to do this because in terms of my ""daily money"" I have very little (never more than about £100 in that account) and I find this really helps curb frivolous spending. I have an automated transfer set up with what I have budgeted myself for per week expenses. This gets paid in every week and I know that I can safely spend what's in that account that week and I'm not spending more than I can afford to.   I then have a savings account with emergency money in. It took a while to build this up but it's really useful to have. I'd reccomend saving enough in this account so that you have enough money to live off completely (rent, food, car etc) for about 3 months.   The rest of my money is then in another savings account, and I just put as much in there as I can. Occasionally I need some money from this for an unexpected cost, but I always make it a priority to pay it back to myself asap.  I've found that just being more aware of where my money is going makes it much easier to save - you quickly see where you are spending on things that you don't need to.   Congratulations in the new job, and I hope you get everything sorted soon!"
personalfinance,3dyw5l,TinyBabyAlli,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:02:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think I have the steady funds to split up into multiple accounts right now but once I start to regain my footing this is a strategy I will consider for sure. I think seeing under $100 in my ""spending"" account all the time will help me say no to going out when I don't have the money which would probably help me immensely.  Thank you so much for reaching out to me!! Your advice isn't something I would have ever thought of but it seems so efficient."
personalfinance,3dyw5l,dequeued,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:27:28 2015 UTC,"I find it works really well - I know exactly where my money is going.   In terms of the other accounts I would start them asap. Even of you can only afford $10 into the savings account and the Emergency account for now that's a start and helps get you into the right mentality and gets you onto a better money management system.   As others have pointed out you currently have $600/month that is unnacounted for, and so getting a system in place so you can figure out where all your money is going will be really helpful for you.  I've also found that little purchases add up really quickly - those Starbucks, eating out etc etc are a relatively small cost on their own, but once its a few times a week it adds up really fast, so cutting out those little luxuries for a month or two until you've got control of your spending will be a big help in starting to build up other savings.   Best of luck to you :) (and remember, working more than 40 hours/week doesn't increase productivity in the long term)"
personalfinance,3dyw5l,sanmadjack,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:35:33 2015 UTC,"I would suggest using a spending tracker to see where money is going. What you have listed is $600 at least under what you make, by my math that would pay for one of your costly repairs on your car in one month savings. Is your rent total cost you pay or total cost if apartment? Over $1000 a month on rent can be pretty high and hard on 30k little things add up like netflux is 8-20 a month depending on plan spotify another 10. Track for a month or two see where your money is going and set up separate acct with money auto deposited out of check. There is no reason you cant have enough money to buy a reliable used car in 6-12 months if you really fo have $600 budget surplus. Good luck to you, search on here fir budget tips there are some really good ones."

personalfinance,3dyvss,clawedjird,2,Mon Jul 20 18:39:09 2015 UTC,"edit: what would refinancing do? Wouldn't that just make my monthly payment lower?   It might reduce your interest rate. If you intend to keep it rather than taking the $1500 hit (probably a worse option, but who knows) that would reduce both your monthly payments and (depending on the reduction in rate) your total amount paid over the life of the loan. It would also make it easier to prepay some1 if you could find extra $$, which would further reduce the amount of interest paid over the loan's life.  1 Your observation is right that early in the loan not much goes to principal, which is why prepayments can help quite a bit. If you can pay 10% extra over the payment, you'll increase the amount of principal you're paying down by rather more than 10%."

The only alternative to selling the car and absorbing the $1,500 loss is seeking help from your parents. Why not ask your parents for a low interest loan to cover that $1,500? $1,500 wouldn't be all that much for you to pay over the course of several years, and it would alleviate your concerns regarding financial aid. Whatever you decide, act quickly. That high interest is wasting more of your money every month.  Edit: You could also refinance the car, then sell it, which might buy you some time and cut that $1,500 figure down a little bit. Just make sure there's no early repayment penalty in the loan terms, or it obviously won't be worth it."

Perhaps your SO could ask for a start date a month out or something to give you time to speak to your employer and work something out.  Any chance you could stay in your position and work remotely? It seems like something worth bringing up to your employer if they value you and your skill set.

personalfinance,3dyrz2,dequeued,2,Mon Jul 20 17:18:55 2015 UTC,"If your USAA account is continuously getting hacked you need to get out. Stolen credit cards is a serious situation. Make sure you don't use any of your major institution information with Simple and bitcoin sites. Access to your personal information from untrusted sites, malware, and viruses can create situations where your secure accounts like USAA may be accessed. This could also be a symptom of identity theft, check with your identity theft protection service and tell them your situation."
personalfinance,3dyrz2,misterhelperson,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:18:15 2015 UTC,What does USAA do when you report the fraud? Sometimes they may just change your card number (and often by a guessable number of digits). They need to do a harder reboot on your account and issue you completely new numbers. Have they done that?  You should also get a proper credit card and use that for any and all transactions aside from taking money out of the ATM.

Now, they are offering the ability for you to make Roth (post-tax) contributions to your 401k.  Both contributions are going into your 401k, its just when they are taxed that's different.    Will the company match?  Probably, but their match will be a traditional contribution into your 401k, so they aren't paying the taxes, which is fine.  Ask HR if they will match your contributions if you make Roth contributions to be sure.  Fidelity and Vanguard are companies that offer 401ks and IRAs.  Vanguard is typically recommended for IRAs due to the low fees.  Fidelity is fine for IRAs as well."

NEVER buy anything on a credit card you wouldn't pay for in cash. Especially random stuff you don't need. Doing stuff like that is exactly how you get into a world of debt.
personalfinance,3dyn9y,whiteraven4,-1,Mon Jul 20 16:40:20 2015 UTC,"Well for one im not* going to use my credit card all the time. That's what I have a debit card for. But the examples I used, I don't have 400$ laying around. At Best Buy they have a finance plan for that type of thing.

personalfinance,3dyn9y,whiteraven4,2,Tue Jul 21 02:09:11 2015 UTC,You are using a credit card in the exact opposite way you should. You want a new TV? Save up for it. If you can't afford to buy it now then you can't afford to buy it yet. You want an Xbox? Save up for it. Want a new fridge? Save up for it. That is not the kind of stuff you buy with a credit card unless you're going to pay the statement in full before it's due.  You should be using your credit card for normal every day purchases and paying it in full every month. A credit card is not to finance luxuries that you can't afford.

Instead treat it like a debit card. You have roughly 3 weeks from a statement date to pay the full amount to avoid paying interest.

personalfinance,3dtxh3,atw13,90,Sun Jul 19 22:46:44 2015 UTC,"I do car loans for a living at a major bank. It is ILLEGAL by federal law to guess what someone would get as an APR and is ILLEGAL to discourage anyone from applying for a loan. This guy is a skunk. He either has another deal pending on the car with someone else, or perhaps he thinks he can get someone else to pay more than you are willing to pay for the car, so he doesn't want to sell the car for you.  Go to a different dealer. The place you're at is terrible. Also, do the legwork with the banks where you have applications pending. They usually only pend applications if they are waiting for you to send back documents (like pay stubs or something)"
personalfinance,3dtxh3,OandO,20,Sun Jul 19 23:43:30 2015 UTC,"Also,    What I expected was the interest rate to be high since this is the case with most dealerships, whether they use their own financing services or use multiple national banks.   That's not really true either. Dealers will often give you a slightly lower rate than banks or credit unions. Dealer know that people are fixated on rates, but the interest rate is NOT the only part of the equation. Dealers will KILL you on things like gap insurance, extended warranties, etc (side note: gap insurance is a great idea for most people). The charge so much extra on gap insurance, that it completely negates the APR savings.  As an example: you're financing 5000. Let's say the dealer charges $600 for gap (on the low side for what dealers typically charge). Now you're financing $5600. Let's say you get a 5% APR. That means your monthly loan payment will be 105.68.  However now you go to your bank. They are willing to give you a 6% APR (a whole percentage point higher). They will sell you gap insurance for only $300. So you now only need to finance $5300 for the car and the same exact insurance product. EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE A HIGHER APR, in this case you will only be spending $102.46 per month on the loan.   Plus the dealer is going to send you to a bank you don't know. You have no relationship with them. You don't know if the dealer's bank is going to charge you for paying off early, making extra payments, making payments by phone, making payment by internet. Some of those banks will make you open a checking acct with them (even if you don't want to). Some of those banks have TERRIBLE customer service, with rude reps, long hold times, etc.  TLDR: The dealer can possibly to give you a lower interest rate than one of your banks, but INTEREST RATE IS NOT EVERYTHING!!!"

personalfinance,3dtxh3,abs159,6,Sun Jul 19 15:34:46 2015 UTC,In the event of a total loss it covers the difference between the actual value of the car and what's owed.

personalfinance,3dtxh3,lissabeth777,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:44:43 2015 UTC,"You want to borrow money from me? I want insurance that if that car is totaled, you actually pay me back all you borrowed."
personalfinance,3dtxh3,atw13,2,Sun Jul 19 19:03:22 2015 UTC,"This is a good product on a vehicle that you know will blue book under what you paid if you wreak it. Insurance typically will only pay out what the car is worth, not what you owe.  However, on a 5k car...gap insurance is a joke. Usually, you can afford to replace it AND usually the BB value is higher than what you owe, if anything."
personalfinance,3dtxh3,bbrown921523,11,Sun Jul 19 21:44:03 2015 UTC,"Gap insurance covers you if your vehicle is ever totaled (in an accident or a tree falls on it or whatever). It is SEPARATE than your auto insurance policy.  So whenever your car is totaled, the insurance company is going to determine how much they think your car is CURRENTLY worth. The insurance value is different than trade-in value or Kelley Blue Book value or the amount you could sell your car for. It is usually lower than any other value.  The insurance company is going to give you a pay out for whatever they think the vehicle is worth. Often times (even if you started off with a downpayment on your car) the amount he insurance company gives you is LESS than what you owe on your car loan. When that happens YOU are still COMPLETELY responsible for paying that difference out of pocket.   SO If you owe $10,000 on your car loan today, and your car is totaled today, it's possible the insurance company will only give you something like $8000 for your car. So that leaves $2000 that you still have to pay. You could either pay it out of pocket (but who has thousands of extra dollars just laying around?) OR you will be stuck making loan payments on a car YOU DON'T EVEN OWN ANYMORE. This happens because cars depreciate in value (often times cars depreciate in value faster than you can pay off your loan). You more likely to be in this situation the longer you finance. Financing your car for 60 months or greater and you should really have gap insurance.  And of course, now you need a new car to get you around. So for some time you could be stuck making TWO car payments. Once on a car you don't even own anymore, one on the new car. Again, most people don't have that extra money in their budget.  THAT'S WHERE GAP INSURANCE comes in. It takes car of the difference between your insurance payoff and your car loan. So if your vehicle is totaled, they will cover the difference and you don't have to worry about the loan.  I see sooooo many people who didn't think they needed gap insurance. ""That won't happen to me"". And then it happens. And they kick themselves and say ""I should have listened to you when you said I needed it. How am I supposed to pay my bills now? How can I afford a new car?"""
personalfinance,3dtxh3,atw13,2,Sun Jul 19 22:25:56 2015 UTC,Gap can also pay your monthly if your out of work for a legit reason like an injury.  I know someone who gap has covered his last 2 payments due to no work from a injury. He has to provide proof from his doctor each time but they handle it.
personalfinance,3dtxh3,ThatIsJustOK,3,Sun Jul 19 22:07:51 2015 UTC,"For my company, gap insurance and what you're talking about are two separate products.

personalfinance,3dtxh3,throwaway50912,5,Sun Jul 19 19:49:44 2015 UTC,"My guess is it could fall under discouraging people from getting a loan, which is HIGHLY illegal (under Equal Credit Opportunity Act).  OP's experience is an obvious example of this. Dealer saw a young guy and ASSUMED that he would get a bad rate. He discriminated and discouraged based on age, possibly gender or other factors, which is illegal under ECOA.  On top of that, I have no idea what I will find on your credit report unless I take an application (which pulls your credit report). There is no way I can accurately guess what your rate will be. There are about a million factors taken into account when getting an interest rate, including but not limited to: debt to income, payment to income, payment history, what kind of credit you've had taken out (credit cards, mortgages, unsecured loans, secured loans), the amount of credit you've been granted (checking for comparable pay history), how long your accounts have been open, % utilized on credit cards, any collections, liens, judgements, etc etc etc.  Any one of those things, or in certain combinations, could change things.   At least, at my financial institution, it isn't: ""this credit score = this rate"". It is a complicated calculation."

Our dealer went with ally financial who checks multiple places for credit, we came out with 9k @7.25%, 0 down payment.

It's in the fair-good range for most lenders, so you should be out of the bad credit rates (or lack thereof).  I was approved for a pretty good mortgage at 720 FICO, and my mortgage broker said that my rate wasn't too far off from the lowest rate (less than .25%).

If you need something bigger than a Ford Ranger, you probably need one of these anyway.

I see these everyday and it makes me sick (probably literally since air quality here sucks in the summer).  I admit they can be a little fun to drive, but I'd be willing to bet 90% of them would have more fun in a 200+ HP sports car or a 600+ CC road bike, both of which cost less than the truck, even if you factor in renting a truck when you actually need to haul something."

There is so much competition, if you get treated badly i one place you can just take your business elsewhere.  You sound really smart to have done your research; are there any sites like yelp or angieslist that are useful in your area? Sometimes the reviews are biased one way or the other, but you can usually read through and see which way they're biased. Use that to find a dealership with good service. That's important because you'll be going back there for car service so you want a place you can work with.  One good strategy for negotiating loans is to walk into the dealership with your approved loan paperwork from the other bank and ask if they can beat it. Make sure to compare the total cost of the loans, not just the monthly payments.  Good luck."

Unless he's getting free oil changes for life or something, he should find an independent mechanic shop with good reliable reviews and take it there for service.

Fluid that, you guessed it, can only be obtained at Nissan dealerships.  In these cases, a person is more likely to use the dealership service department because it's a one-stop-shop.

personalfinance,3dtxh3,jeremiahs_bullfrog,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:55:01 2015 UTC,"This is generally true, but some dealers will treat oil changes as a loss-leader and only charge twenty or thirty bucks.  Once they have a customer's car in the bay its much easier to upsell you on other services.  The benefit of a dealer oil change is that you get new rather than recycled oil and an OEM filter, which is usually much better than the generic brands that quick-lube places throw on.  The trick is to only go there for oil changes if that's the case.  If the dealer points out another problem you then want to take it to your good independent mechanic."
personalfinance,3dtxh3,LikesToSmile,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:39:01 2015 UTC,"I honestly just do it myself. I bought a pack of OEM oil filters and buy synthetic oil from Costco when it's on sale (roughly every 3 months, convenient, no?) and picked up some odds-and-ends (oil pan, funnel, wrench, etc) and just do it myself. It takes ~30 minutes and I get to accomplish something. Total materials are roughly $20, but I get a better oil filter than what the shop provides.  However, if changing your own oil is not an option (I wasn't allowed to do it when renting), I'd totally go with an independent shop. Most shops will also refill your fluids for free, which is nice.  If you decide to get an oil change done at a shop, don't let them sucker you into any extra services. They charge way more than they should and most of the things they'll do during an oil change can be done in ~5 minutes by yourself (e.g. headlights, windshield wipers, air filter), and auto-parts stores are very good at helping explain how to do repairs yourself (I actually use youtube most of the time)."

After you're done looking, go to the dealer with the best service and see if they'll match the best offer and pay cash.

Fuck that business manager.   2 there are several laws dealers deal with when offering you credit here in the US. The most important in this case is the fact that they can't over charge you for interest by that much.   (We submit your credit, bank sells us your rate at let say 6%. We can only try and sell it at 2.5% higher. Any thing beyond that is illegal and the bank won't even process the loan.   3 with your father as a joint applicant,  I'd say you should be looking at a 4-7% rate depending on what your credit is really like, where you live,  and how much money each of you make."

Different lending institutions will offer varied chargeback time periods and splits (75% to dealer (of the aforementioned 2.5%)/25% to lending institution).    Was dealer a buy here pay here or were they arranging 3rd party financing?    I know, here in TX - Not sure about laws in your jurisdiction, the office of the consumer credit commissioner oversees most of the businesses that perform financing activities.

personalfinance,3dtxh3,HolySloth,2,Sun Jul 19 19:46:22 2015 UTC,How do you know that just from Fico? I underwrite and I couldnt say for sure he would get bought.   Whats his job time? What line of work is he in? Gross income? Whats his PTI? Whats his dad's PTI? How many miles are on the vehicle?   I've seen people with 700 fico get 29.99% because no one would touch them because there income was shaky and the vehicle had over 200k. And no the dealer wasn't paid points on it.
personalfinance,3dtxh3,HolySloth,2,Mon Jul 20 00:50:58 2015 UTC,You can't have a thin file and be 800+ and with that type of credit all stips from the bank are usually waived. Such as proof of income or residence.
personalfinance,3dtxh3,KyleBumpus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:48:40 2015 UTC,No I agree with you. So assuming this large lot isn't a buy here pay here what reason could the finance manager have to say 15% or nothing. I don't see what he gets out of this.  I'm assuming something is missing from the story.
personalfinance,3dtxh3,nutbuckers,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:53:09 2015 UTC,Haha yeah normally I side with the customer but in this case it just seems baffling what the car dealers logic is here if OP story is true.
personalfinance,3dtxh3,jpdrennon,8,Mon Jul 20 00:34:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly, he was probably trying to make you buy elsewhere for some reason. Had you already made a commitment to buy the car before you asked about the loan? If not, he likely thought you were just being a jerk and wasting his time on purpose."
personalfinance,3dtxh3,fireball121,4,Mon Jul 20 01:32:40 2015 UTC,"He also might have picked up on the OP not intending to actually sign; with lower priced used vehicles, after giving a good price to the customer the dealer makes the margin by taking a cut from financing. At some point in negotiation, esp with savvy cost-of-borrowing aware buyers, the deal can get to be unprofitable and the dealer ""sours""."
personalfinance,3dtxh3,MactheDog,5,Mon Jul 20 01:35:23 2015 UTC,"I've worked in multiple dealerships and have held multiple roles including sales, administration, and management. Based on what I've seen, I would say he's not completely wrong but he isn't being totally truthful either. What he was doing was a closing technique. You said that you hadn't committed to buying the car yet. I can almost promise that the sales manager went to him and said 'put them in your office and sell this car'. He knows you've applied elsewhere and if you use outside financing, they lose their finance kickbacks, so he wants you to finance through him. In order to do that, he needs to try and make you doubt your own credit worthiness. He will say that 15% is the best you can hope for, then he will say that trying an application may be a good idea just to be sure. He gets you a 13.9% rate and now he's your hero. He then convinces you to just go through them and buy today. You walk out paying more than you should have with a higher rate than you could have gotten. And you thank him for it.  TL;DR he was trying to close you hard."
personalfinance,3dtxh3,tgwill,4,Mon Jul 20 01:46:24 2015 UTC,"Ex personal banker here.  You have to understand that it isn't profitable for anyone to finance 5k for 2%. The teens is pretty bad but 6-8% would probably be a little more. See if your dad would consign for an unsecured loan to purchase the vehicle with. A lot of times I used these to finance used cars because the rates were better. If his divorce is 820, your bank should be able to get you in the single digits. Also, get a credit card. Start building credit now. Don't incur any credit card debt. But use it and pay it off."

And get yourself a credit card, charge a tank of gas on it each month and pay it off in full. That should help your score."

With a credit score of 716 I got an interest rate of 2.74% on a 5 year loan through the dealer which was lower than the best rate I got from going to banks myself. The finance manager told me there was a very small chance that I would need a cosigner because I had never had an auto loan before, but he was pretty sure I could get it without the cosigner and he was right. It probably helped that I put $5,000 down with a $2,000 trade in and I have a good job, but I would laugh at anyone who offered more than like a 5% interest rate with your credit score."

He may not have even wanted your business, if the car was a great deal, the dealer may be counting on people with bad credit or who don't know any better to end up taking out terrible terms to supplement their revenue and compensate for selling cars cheaply.

I feel like a ton of variables have been left out.   Large dealerships and New car stores have a lot of buying power. Especially new car stores like Toyota dealerships that have very aggressive in house financing.   FICO is only one part of this and if all you have is student loans then its not much to go off of. How many miles are on the car? What line of work are you in? How long have you worked? Can you prove your income? What is your PTI? Rent? As far as your dad goes I don't know how much credit he has outstanding. Most co signers dont sign thinking they will ever have to pay and are extremely hard to a get payment out of if the maker defaults.    No one wins with you not getting financed and the market is extremely strong for lending. I've seen people in the low 500's get prime rates.    Plus if its a large dealer they have access to a ton of banks and credit unions that have auto approvals and they must have all came back with red flags.

If you can make more by investing your money elsewhere than you would save by not paying interest, it makes sense to finance. Often it's possible to secure a car loan at an APR less than 3%.  In that case, investing the same amount in pretty much any stock market ETF would very likely give you more than 3% returns per year, making it more profitable to finance and invest rather than pay cash.  Additionally, if OP is a college student with student loans, at least some of his loans would likely have a higher interest rate than 3%, so he would save more money in interest payments by paying down those than he would in paying cash for his car."

personalfinance,3dumqy,polygraphy,19,Mon Jul 20 02:01:47 2015 UTC,"Alright, so a few things here. You almost make too much money it appears to even contribute to a Roth IRA, so contribute as much as can now, because soon you won't be eligible. http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Amount-of-Roth-IRA-Contributions-That-You-Can-Make-For-2015  With your income a house of 400k is very affordable, I think you are rushing a bit to come up with the down payment though. How long have you been saving for? Did you just pull yourself out of student loan debt, or other debts? The extra savings of ~6-10k by not contributing shouldn't make or break you at your income level, I don't think your budget should be that tight that you should even be questioning not contributing. Roth IRA's though for someone at your income aren't that important, and can often be a nice thing, but a waste of money overall because it forces your investments to no longer be liquid. I would recommend investing in more liquid things now without the tax benefits because having liquid money available is going to be more important at your stage in life than money you can't touch. Something seems off to me that your budget is that tight that an extra $1k per month is confusing for ya'll to deal with. I'm not trying to nitpick, it just seems odd. Did ya'll both just start recently making this much money?  If I was in your shoes I would try to wait until I had a bit over the 20% down because what you don't want is to wrap up the majority of your savings into an asset that isn't liquid like a house. I recommend buying when your assets are split at least the following, >50% in investments, <50% in house. Hopefully this ratio is weighted towards investments and the house is just a piece in a larger portfolio.  After buying the house you will want to spend ~5-10% in crap to fill your home with, furniture, etc. even when you think you have all you need, you're realize you don't. It can be nice when you have this money expendable, get it ready.  Hopefully, you have at least 6 months in an emergency fund before buying the home as well. This is critical for when you lose your job, or other things happen in life.  As well, ya'll are both very young in your careers by ""settling down"" you may be limiting your pay now to the region you are in, this can greatly reduce the number of future job opportunities and advancements in your fields. This is not always the case, but when I bought my first house at a young age I immediately got a way better job offer from a company an hour away from my house. I moved, and the house is now a rental property, but because of that I still don't own my own home, I own a rental property, and rent myself.  I am your age as well, and have equivalent income, but I make the decision to rent because the longer I rent for, the less house I'm buying. I'm willing to rent a nice ~$200k house, even though I wouldn't buy one. I want to buy a much nicer home, but by renting I'm saving more money in my investments that are liquid (My rent is less than the mortgage, due to the market in my area, Rule of thumb is ~1%, if you can rent for less than 1%/month of the purchase price renting is cheaper)."

personalfinance,3dumqy,stephcurrysmom,3,Sun Jul 19 20:01:35 2015 UTC,Yes. The Traditional IRA income limit only determines whether you can take a deduction on your contributions. There is no income limit on contributions themselves to a Traditional IRA.
personalfinance,3dumqy,freddyknuckles,5,Sun Jul 19 20:44:21 2015 UTC,"Hi. I am commenting as someone who recently purchased a home using the 10,000 dollar first home purchase exception from and IRA AND took some money in the form of a loan from my 401(k).  I think the answer will be different for different people, but also that buying a house is probably more important for some people than is socking money away in an IRA.   If I were you I would certainly stop contributing to the IRA, considering that you can still match before the end of the tax year. But it isn't necessary as you're all ready saving much more than most average families.   For me having a home is a much better investment for many reasons. I live in the bay area and housing is very difficult to find, especially with a dog, as well as wanting more space than most people have for themselves. We are a family of 2 with a  child and a dog and we have a 2.5 bedroom house. Our mortgage is probably more than what we would be paying for a 2 br apartment but not by much."
personalfinance,3dumqy,HyperManFromSpace,12,Sun Jul 19 21:22:47 2015 UTC,"I just went through a very similar time in my life so I'll speak from experience (29, DINK, $200k/yr gross).  Last year, I bought the house- although I would actually say modest condo - for $250k.  Put 5% down.  Still paying PMI, but actually still pay less than I did when renting.  With the savings over renting I was able to quickly build my emergency fund and max out my savings contributions.    Emotionally, I feel significantly more at ease now and it is much easier to hide away savings now.  Buying the place and paying the PMI aren't the penalties that most folks describe when compared to the stability and lack of stress you may feel when 1) you have your own place and 2) you guys aren't living with the parents any more.  I have experienced no new home buyer 'horror stories' and 12 months later my emergency fund and savings are full.    So, to directly answer your question, I do not think that reaching for 20% is something you have to do.  Pay the PMI, get out of the parent's house and take advantage of the low rates.  While PMI may not be the best economic choice, for someone in your shoes it may actually be the best 'spiritual' answer just as it was for me.  For reference, PMI on my $250k place is only ~$140 per month.    ***Note: this advice isn't for everyone."

personalfinance,3dumqy,-BW-,2,Mon Jul 20 03:15:07 2015 UTC,"Based on the kinds of responses your getting, this may be too smart a question for r/personalfinance. You may have better luck asking at bogleheads.org. I'll try to answer intelligently anyway, though I'm not an expert in what I'm about to say.  It sounds to me like you've got plenty of cash that you can contribute to the IRA, any time you like, if only the IRS would let you. Your goal with the IRA should be to make sure you don't let the tax deferred space in those accounts go to waste by not contributing this year. You mention that you can almost certainly make up for the missing contributions after you buy the house, but there's a risk that if the sale takes too long, you'll lose that opportunity to take advantage of 2015's tax deduction. Deferring contributions seems like a near-optimal approach to preserving your tax privileged space, but it's probably even better to contribute to the IRA now, filling the tax privileged space now, with 100% certainty, and then take a loan from your IRA for the down payment on the house. You can pay that back even after the 2015 contribution period ends, and it will fill that tax privileged space right back up again.  The moment you borrow and repay in lump sums, you lose the benefits of dollar cost averaging. I wouldn't worry about dollar cost averaging in your case. The potential for gains from that is too small to be with worrying about in this case."
personalfinance,3dumqy,pcopley,2,Mon Jul 20 03:19:19 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to ask, why do you want to build a $400k house as your first home? Do you think your ""dream home"" now will be your ""dream home"" in 5 years? What about 10? Twenty? You're living at home, so I'm guessing you don't have a ton of furniture/stuff for the house. Do not underestimate how much this can cost you. Plus building means no appliances which aren't cheap either.   I don't know what area you live in, but I'm going to guess that building a $400k house means you're in an area where a nice 4 BR, 2-3 ba house in a nice area is $250k (give or take $50k). Why not buy a house already built with a 15 year note instead?   Rough numbers: * $400k house @ 4% with a 30 year note = $1910/mo * $275k house @ 4% with a 15 year note = $2034/mo  But look at the amortization schedules for each of those. The first 10 years of the 30 year note scenario you're paying more in interest than in principle (starting with 2/3 of your payment going to interest). This ends up costing you a total of $687k in total, or $287k in interest. Conversely with the 15 year note you're paying more in principle than interest from day 1. This ends up costing your $366k in total, or $91k in interest. This is a net of $196k that you are ""throwing away"". Is that really worth it to you?  I'm just some random person on the internet. But I fail to see any wisdom in building your first house. And I used some arbitrary numbers based on assumptions of your area and housing costs there. That being said it's supposed to be illustrative of what else you could be doing with your money. And I would argue would be a stronger financial move to really build wealth instead of just ""keeping up with the Jones"" so to speak."

There is no reason you can't do both but there is something I feel I should mention having just gone through this.  My fiance and I make about 180-190, except I contribute 15% to ESPP and 5% to 401.  We saved up for a down payment while renting a place for 1500/mo and saving for a 25k wedding.  Bought a 323k house in Feb (14 yrs old, no issues on inspection, move in ready), so 65k down.  10k in closing.  another 7k in the 5 months we have owned it on tools, paint, minor projects, small decorative things to make it more of a home, etc.  Our monthly expenses for things like utilities / lawn care / pest control / etc etc skyrocketed we work a lot and can't do all of it, so means paying for it.  We cut down on our frivolous spending a bit.. but long story short.. the only thing that changed is we bought a 323k house and now even though we are trying to be more careful with our money, we save 2000 less per month than we did last year.  Long story short, houses are freaking expensive.. we havent bought any furniture or anything like that and the downpayment/closing costs didn't weigh into those numbers, thats simple per month cost of house and living.  Just be aware of that when you are planning ahead, even if you feel prepared, you will still be walking into a bunch of expenses.  Yes they will be rewarding and make your house better etc, but they are something that will factor into your finances for sure."

I wouldn't recommend getting too invested in a single property or builder though. There is no perfect house, area, etc. Some may be more ideal than others, but buying a house and living there the rest of your life just doesn't happen for most people any more. Career locations change, areas change, that house that was perfect ends up not having what you learn through experience you really want, etc. Not to say it can't happen and you won't get it all right the first time, but with new construction it's a cyclical industry, it may be a rush for a busy builder now, but if you miss the prime of this season, there will be another one."
personalfinance,3dumqy,Easih,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:46:44 2015 UTC,I'm in a somewhat similar boat. Just moved in to my first condo two weeks ago. I borrowed against my retirement to be able to have a minimum down payment for my condo. I also backed down my retirement contribution from 8% to 6%. That's just temporary for a year or so for cash flow purposes. So I'll tell you what a friend of mine told me when I was wrestling with using my retirement for my condo: either way you're contributing to your retirement. Your home's value will be part of your retirement plan.
personalfinance,3dumqy,efficientenzyme,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:01:24 2015 UTC,"Just saying, even though you and your wife are very fortunate with your careers and salary, doesn't mean you necessarily you need to take on more of a tax burden. Depending on where you went to school, how many classes and such you paid off going through school and other variables, you could have a lot of debt from student loans. I only have a bachelor's and it set me back 40k. This next part may seem a little insensitive, but just because you have an opportunity to build a house in a particular community, doesn't mean you have to. I don't recall you saying that you have children yet, but if you do I can see the school district being a big influence. Anyway, you can still buy a cheaper house to live in. Traditionally, if you buy a place in a nice neighborhood and you treat it right, it won't loss it's value. That's all I have to say about that.  As for your 401k situation, you don't have to contribute as much as you were originally, but don't stop putting money into it altogether. Your company is matching .80 on every dollar up to 8%. You would be missing out on free money. My suggestion is to just drop your contributions to 8%.  My suggestions are just that, what I would do in the situation. So best of luck to you, and congrats on y'alls new careers."

When you go to close on your construction loan if you have a 1 note close you will have to have the down payment up front, prior to the construction starting, not when the construction loan converts to a mortgage.   Just calculate out the amount you could potentially lose for not contributing 10k to your ira vs the consequence of forced mortgage insurance over the life of a mortgage, which is throwing away money.  What's the question again?  Oh and just a heads up, even though you accounted for appliances and furniture be aware overages are going to eat at you and another 20k will be gone before you know it because you wanted nicer cupboards or granite countertops etc which wasn't built into your builders price per sq ft budget.

The thing is, that is a measure of the increase in prices over that period which doesn't account for inflation. It also doesn't account for costs like maintenance on the home and transaction costs (agent fees, closing costs, etc.).    a piece of property can be sold for hard cash far faster than an IRA    A person can liquidate an IRA within a few business days, you can ""sell"" a house in a few days (get a signed purchase contract), but you won't see any cash until you close on it, typically a month later after a due diligence period.

Inflation is the same, regardless if you're in real estate or stocks, so it doesn't matter in this case.  If he puts 10% down on his 400,000 house, and real estate increases 4% per year (simple interest first year is $16k).  Plus he gets a tax deduction for the interest, the first year at 4% mortgage rate + PMI lets call it $20k, I don't know what tax bracket he's in, but lets say 33%, that is $6600 tax savings the first year.    Alternatively, he takes the $40k and invests it in stocks at 8% a year and rents a place.  Simple interest he gets $3200 the first year, not even the tax deduction on the house.  Additionally, I believe he will have to pay taxes on at least some of the gain due to his income.  I'm too lazy to run the precise numbers, but obviously living with mom maximizes assets, followed by buying a house (the more mortgage interest the better), followed by IRA or stock market."

Doing the math out, my finance charge is only $450. Considering the additional insurance premium for comprehensive coverage, I'd say my monthly cost is relatively low for the benefit of driving around to go to work with my own car and not borrowing my parent's vehicle, etc etc.  If possible, consider biking, public transportation, carpooling, and any other means.

personalfinance,3dx2ds,evaned,4,Mon Jul 20 09:02:47 2015 UTC,"Just because you're far from retirement doesn't mean you shouldn't start saving now. Who knows, maybe you'll retire at 50 instead of 65.  What kind of retirement plans does your work provide? You are in a position where you could potentially max that out and max out your Roth IRA pretty comfortably. Other than that... want to buy a house? Could save towards that.  Investing in startups sounds like something that I'd only do once I was very secure with my other goals and retirement position."
personalfinance,3dx2ds,taintsweater,3,Mon Jul 20 06:38:52 2015 UTC,I know that I'm eligible for a 401k starting the first of August. How much percentage wise should go into a 401k vs a Roth IRA?
personalfinance,3dx2ds,Truthsayerr,4,Mon Jul 20 06:53:30 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would strongly consider maxing both for a couple of years. That'll take up most of your excess, but not all of it. An exception to this would be if you're thinking of buying a house/condo in the next few years. Edit or considering schooling. (In the latter case, consider looking at 529 plans, which will let you save and spend pre-tax. Though that probably only makes sense if school would be a few years down the line.)  But, at the very least: contribute enough that you max out any employer match in the 401(k), then decide between the 401(k) and a Roth based on how good the funds are. Again, you're looking for low-cost funds. Preferably no purchase or redemption fee (""load""), and ""expense ratios"" in roughly the 0.10%-0.25% range, depending on what they are tracking.  Different people recommend different savings, but saving 15% of gross (before-tax) income, not counting employer match, is a fairly common one. But I think you can do better than that for a couple years and really set yourself up very nicely."
personalfinance,3dx2ds,Xdes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:02:22 2015 UTC,"Start a Roth IRA, you can take it out without penalty later on in life. it is never too early to start saving for retirement. Continue your education, you cant always think that you will have that 3,000 a month just sitting there. I do the envelope system with excess cash that I have. I like what Dave Ramsey says about that system. I save and invest just about the same amount each month. Im in a pricey city myself and rent is just about the same as you. Keep a decent amount for an emergency fund just because because you never know when you will need cash on hand."
personalfinance,3dx2ds,timinator855,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:26:05 2015 UTC,"401K and Roth IRA are good investments.  They should be no brainers.  Those two are probably maxing out at $20K+.  May be you can buy your parents something? Laptops? Home improvements?   You need to maintain your skills - look into getting edu-macated... GED, classes on software engineering, may be even a degreed program,  Just because you are making $100K at 22 without a college degree will not mean that you can make $200K at 33.

personalfinance,3dy3ug,Mekhami,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:08:24 2015 UTC,"The only thing I can comment on is some of the expenses to start with.   The first month's rent ($1100ish, not exactly sure where I'm going to end up but that's about the average 2br apartment rate in the area I'm moving to) and security deposit (Could be anywhere from 200 to a full month's rent)   Maybe talk to /r/Austin and see if you can find something cheaper (like a bedroom for a year). That seems reasonable for Austin, but I have found neighborhoods can vary greatly in price (lived in Boston for a long time, and can tell you finding the right location can be extremely helpful cost wise)   A laptop. The laptop I have now I have to give back to work, and I'm a software developer, so I absolutely have to have a machine to work on, and it absolutely has to be powerful enough to run all of my tools and VMs. You may think it's stupid but it's probably going to be a Macbook. Disagree with me if you want but if you're not a developer, I don't really wanna hear it.   Will you get a work computer? If so, I would wait to see what they give you. Otherwise, maybe ask around forums for professions that use that software. Maybe there are some recommendations on other computer options or ways to get deals.   Transportation. I'm in NYC now and don't have a car and have relied entirely on public transit. Which is great! But Austin's public transit isn't on the same level. I have been estimating my commute times and sometimes it's like 90 minutes to go 3 miles. Not even remotely feasible. So, I'll need to buy a car at some point in the future.   Again I would check /r/Austin. Maybe there are some recommendations for housing near by to work, or ways to use public transit. My wife used to have a long commute to work when we lived in Boston. She found an MBTA bus that started at her neighborhood, and went to the financial district in a quick express route. She had to plan the times a bit, but it was a huge plus on her commute satisfaction.   Utilities, connection fees, internet. Other non negotiable stuff with deposits and connection fees. I could see this being over $500 easily in the first month.   Ask around and try to find an apartment that includes some utilities. I have found apartments in other major cities that had small perks like free internet, or other utilities covered. That can save some cash up front."

It's a breeze to save for retirement when you have a higher-than-average income, but a nightmare if you don't make much money. Don't just blindly put it into education, put it into education that will directly increase your income, at a very low level of risk.  An example is my workplace.

Avoid chunking money into speculative education, such as a bachelors degree in I'm-not-sure-what-yet-maybe-something-hey-college-is-supposed-to-make-you-more-money-right?

My advice would be to try to get the federal loans on an alternate payment plan like IBR (there are several options).  This will lower her federal minimum payment.  Then she can apply the extra toward the higher interest private loans.    Only do this if she'll definitely put the difference toward the private loans.    Then once the private loans are paid off, focus on the federal loans."

personalfinance,3du1yg,missintent,3,Mon Jul 20 00:15:19 2015 UTC,"As others have stated do not take any any of your girlfriend's student loan obligations.  It's up to her to refinance, but basically it depends on how much the refinance fees would cost relative to the payoff time of the loans. I.e. does it pay to refinance all the loans into one 5-8% APR loan if the refinance fees are 5-10% of the total loan amount.  I paid off $45K in student loan debt scattered across credit cards and government student loans, but it took me about three years to do so and I had to live like a poor college kid the whole time.  It kind of sucked, but it was worth the effort to get out of the debt.  A more balanced approach would have been to make a 5-10 year plan to pay off the loans and minimize interest while living a more comfortable and enjoyable life.  Google some loan calculators and play with the numbers and budgeting. It should help her make a decision as to whether it is worth refinancing or not."
personalfinance,3du1yg,theblang,2,Sun Jul 19 15:31:36 2015 UTC,"My wife started out  with around 115k in student loans and in the last 3 years we are now down to 75k and pushing very hard to get them lower. We do have a lot of disposable income so we are currently able to pay 1-2k extra per month on them. However, one of our largest helps has been putting 100% of tax return money and 100% of bonuses on the loans. This will really help her. Part of the reason we have not refinanced is because only some of her loans at 5+%...others are 2-3% (which is less than our cars and house).  Essentially the higher interest loans give us incentive to pay them off faster. Try to knock out those 10% and 11% loans first. Good luck. Also don't get discouraged...it takes time...be patient."

personalfinance,3dxvys,kapolani,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:55:17 2015 UTC,"It depends. How far away are you moving? How much underwater are you? Could you come up with the cash to make up the difference between what your house is worth and what you owe? Generally, if people are $10k or $12k underwater (or maybe even $20k-$25k depending on your financial situation and the price of the house), you should give strong consideration to just bringing the cash to the table, chalking it up to a bad investment, and moving on. Being a landlord can be quite stressful and expensive. IF you have great tenants who pay their rent on time every month and who don't lose their jobs and who take care of your property, you are golden. Most of the time, however, you will have to address some repairs and maintenance issues while tenants are living there, and sometimes the condition of the property when they move out is such that you will have to spend a fair amount to fix the house up again before listing for sale again - repainting, recarpeting, refreshing landscaping, etc. If you are currently underwater just $5k or $10k, in my opinion you are betting taking the hit than dealing with renters."

personalfinance,3dxvys,catjuggler,3,Mon Jul 20 15:51:20 2015 UTC,"That's another good point.  Rent will keep some of the undesirable tenants away.  Sounds like you have a good support structure.

personalfinance,3dqlmi,apragopolis,328,Sat Jul 18 18:11:58 2015 UTC,"This is bullshit. I'm so sorry to hear it. I used to work at a UK bank (not Barclays) - if their call chain or hierarchy of responsibility is anything like ours was, it is near impossible for the front desk to find someone who (a) cares and (b) can do anything about the problem. The most important thing to do is stay in your bank and keep speaking to the people there (please try not to get angry at them though - I'm sure they're doing everything they can).  I would definitely advise going to the press. Do you have twitter? Mention it on there, @ing Barclays in the process (and maybe competitor banks too, like '@Santander @RBS would you do this [link to pictures and reddit thread]?'. Then on this thread put a link to your tweets, thereby bringing attention to both ends. More public attention = a better response from the bank. It's sad, but it's true. Corporations only appear to get shit done when you pose a public loss of face threat.   Good luck mate. Keep us updated."
personalfinance,3dqlmi,Larose-,144,Sat Jul 18 18:14:32 2015 UTC,"Hi OP, I'm from Canada so our banks here may not operate under the same conditions. (just a heads up).   However, I am licensed finance officer (bank security). Often when your account starts behaving incorrectly and you cant get any info out of your branches or CSR's it's because said account may be part of an ongoing investigation of some form. Branch staff and customer support (with the exception of the manager) are not actually qualified to handle these situations or disclose this type of info to clients.  I'm not saying you did anything wrong, but some of the ways fraudsters are operating nowadays is incredibly sophisticated. If you keep getting stonewalled I'd try and get on the line with Barclay's Loss Prevention team (that's what banks like to call their fraud department so that if you are behaving suspiciously on the phone and can't access your card, you dont hang up immediately if you are actually trying to impersonate a client.) You may have more luck there. Don't expect them to actually give you details though. They will most likely only clarify if it is a security related issue or not.  Also like many others have suggested do a social media blast, contact your local news companies and spend the cash you managed to get back from benefits wisely as you may wind up waiting the 8 week period if Barclay's communication is as awful as they sound.   This type of mistake would have heads rolling here, but also our branch managers can contact people all the way up the executive chain fairly easily.  Hope this helps and I hope you get your cash back soon."

Even if it means filling your account from their own coffers for the time being until they figure out what went wrong.

Your best bet to get resolution and get access to at least some of your money is to claim fraud on these charges. I'm not familiar with the details of British financials but that should allow those transactions to be put in to a pending status and allow other transactions to settle in the meantime, functionally giving you access to your money.  It's surprising that it's taking this long to clear this up, something this obviously wrong should be cleared up quickly by someone in a branch maybe having to make a phone call to one superior. 100k pounds for a transaction is not an uncommonly high amount that would require some weird level of approval to remove or move.  Internally to the bank someone knows what that transaction code means. An error like that is usually a wire pointed at the wrong account"

There could be multiple things going on. There could be a levy that they're waiting to take the money, if you made a deposit returning they might have put an incorrect dollar amount on it, and past disputes could be coming back, or the system simply made a mistake and placed a hold. It happens. To tell you the truth, it's a little hard to tell without being on their end, but I think it's more of a temporary hold rather than an actual debt. Banks can't actually take your money from a checking/savings without a reason (keep in mind, I work in the US), so I don't see you actually owing this money.  So lets say it's any of those things above. In the ideal world, people are supposed to note your account so others know whats going on. That doesn't always happen. If it's the levy, it takes about a  business day to show up why, and the correct amount will be held. Same thing for any return deposits and denied disputes. If it's a temporary hold, they're usually lifted within one business day and you'll see money in your account Monday. If not, call the call center, ask for a supervisor. Even if they don't know the answer, they'll at least find one.  All in all, you're probably not getting any answers or resolution until Monday.

IME the larger the organization gets the less efficiently it can do anything at all.  This is obviously a mistake.  Anyone with half a brain can figure that out.  Yet you've been doing everything right and been there for two days in person trying to sort out what is probably a computer glitch and no one can figure it out.  You're stuck in the machine and somewhere in the process (probably more than one somewhere) there are idiots gumming it up.  I'm sorry you're having to deal with this.  It sounds like a ginormous headache.  Advice for the future would be to use more than one bank.  I have my emergency fund in a completely different bank than my regular checking account.  That way if one bank decides to be stupid (like this one is) I still have the money from the other one available.
personalfinance,3dqlmi,spyWspy,6,Sat Jul 18 17:42:08 2015 UTC,My guess as to what happened is that the firm that clears for Barclay's had an error in their system. Something broke or someone put in an incorrect account number in a transaction that caused the debit. They can't see what's happening because it probably took place on one of their legacy systems that Barclay's doesn't have access to. They have to wait until someone is around on Monday at the clearing firm to fix it. The three digit source code (BTL) is a dead giveaway. We use 3 character codes like that to track all of our transactions. And I believe their use is industry wide. If I'm correct you have to wait until they can get in touch with the clearing firm's back office to fix the issue.

personalfinance,3dqlmi,dfpoetry,6,Sat Jul 18 16:35:15 2015 UTC,"Ok, i used to work for Natwest and im thinking that this is an internal transfer that has been done wrong. The bank itself will have internal accounts that it uses for ATM funds, cash office transfers etc. If thr people on the desk dont know what the code is then its not an error done by you or member of the public. Keep on them and keep going in, there will be people working on it but you need to keep at it or they might just think its being dealt with by another department without checking (unfortunate but true) since all the banking problems a few years ago, their complaints procedures were improved so thats in your favour. Yes, they must give you access to your cash but they would only do this if its clear it isn't your fault. Problem is that they cant just let you keep withdrawing until they know the exact amounts, times, account numbers that the original error was. It really would make it more difficult and might prolong it. The call centres will be open after the branch shuts so you can always keep bugging them that way. Sorry this is happening to you. Hope they get it sorted and dont be shy to ask for compensation, all banks can do it but they might not offer it to you if you dont ask :) hope this helps  EDIT: apologies for format, spelling etc -on phone."

After several hours on the phone with them I was able to determine that there was a bug in their database software. I got a half hearted apology from them and they didn't thank me for finding the bug. Transferred my money out immediately afterwards.  I do recommend keep a few hundred hidden away in the house somewhere for emergencies.  Got hit by a hurricane a few years ago and the power was out for a week. Cash only economy during that time. Find a good hiding place for it. I never used to do it because I was worried about theft. But I have a couple of safes plus lots of non-obvious hiding places."

I ended up closing the HSBC (after getting locked out of my account for 5 days) and opening an account with Barclays and Natwest.    My electric just ran out too!   You may have bigger problems if you haven't paid your electricity for so long that they cut it - co-incidentally today. I might be reading this wrong.

In which case I wouldn't expect him to have 3 months top up. Most people do it much more frequently(some even do it weekly). What is more, as a result, you can't just delay the payment of the electric bill. If you don't have funds in the account, electricity cuts out immediately."

personalfinance,3dulrz,batsy71,10,Sun Jul 19 17:06:44 2015 UTC,"Read this section of the FAQ. It has the answers you are looking for.  A quick summary of it is that you should invest in an IRA if you do not get matching funds from your employer (Step 4). Once you have about 15% of your income going to retirement savings (Step 5), then the rest of your savings can be directed towards other goals, like a downpayment (Step 6).   Also, is company match awarded retrogressively (for 1st year) after kicking in.   No. However, I would encourage you to look at your company's plan more closely, just in case it is not that they don't start matching until after 1 year of employment, because it may be just that the match will not vest until 1 year of employment. If the latter, then the 401(k) contributions will be important as long as you see a reasonable chance of staying there for at least 1 year."

personalfinance,3dulrz,acshen,3,Sun Jul 19 19:37:33 2015 UTC,"Wow, 100% match up to 8%. That's a crazy good deal. Make sure to check with HR to see if you need to be involved in the plan for a year or just with the company for a year. If you're able to invest and save for a down payment, then see if the company has a Roth 401k you can invest in for the first year, then switch to the traditional for the match.  If you can't save and invest at the same time, maybe it's just not the right time to buy a house."

personalfinance,3dxtjd,ladycai,2,Mon Jul 20 12:59:05 2015 UTC,"It seems like you're staying on the good side of the FICO credit utilization calculation. On the other hand, if by happenstance your larger payment doesn't process until after the statement date, and this happens to be during the same month that you are applying for a loan, this will negatively affect you.  I would recommend, as a few other posters have said, to call BoA and ask them to raise your credit limit. If you have a history with BoA, this should not be an issue.

I had Mint setup forever and it upset me to think about looking at it because you look at it after-the-fact and see how much you suck at sticking to your budget. The philosophy is too much ""set it and forget it"" for my personal taste.   YNAB encourages (basically requires) that you put transactions into your budget manually, right when they happen. You have time to spend it manually, take the time to budget it manually. This puts you in control of your budget and spending instead of reacting to it.   As for bill pay, we just have auto pay setup through our bank account so I can't help you much there.   Edit: the magic behind YNAB is the 4 steps, which they give you for free. You can follow these steps without the software, but the software is great. I highly recommend trying it for 34 days, it has a free trial."

Some people complain about the time but it just takes a few seconds to enter info on purchases on the mobile app and once every two weeks or so I reconcile it to my bank account/credit card info.

One thing they may suggest is that you open an account, deposit the check, then wait x days for it to clear.  You could do that.  Also, the bank is going to be required to report a cash transaction greater than $10k, so if you are thinking there is some advantage to not depositing it in your account, you may be mistaken.

I use this to get money from China back to my US account. I can use my China debit card at my US bank's ATMs, pay 0.5% for a conversion and a $5 fee for the transaction.

This will help to save fees by avoiding repeated ATM transactions. What is your opinion on traveller's cheques?

personalfinance,3dxo31,Decuma,2,Mon Jul 20 12:20:18 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but:  The limit for not having to report cash or specific valuables is 9,999 USD. Anything 10K or more, type of currency does not matter it is judged on its equivalent USD value, you must report.  You can ask your foreign bank account to do a single wire transfer to your USA account for the total amount. It will depend on them how much it costs to send (and on your USA bank on cost to receive). And it is possible that it will be required that such a transaction occurs in person (bank dependent).   Travelers cheques I've never done so I can't talk about them.   Whenever I move countries I take the required amount of cash to set up (if there is a rent payment, etc) + ~2x my standard food/entertainment budget for 1 month.

personalfinance,3dx7fh,figureitoutk,2,Mon Jul 20 14:30:13 2015 UTC,"The biggest difference between unsubsidized and subsidized loans is that subsidized loans do not incure interest while in school.  Chances are you won't qualify for grants until you become (dependent.) I had that issue as well when I was younger. And there are so many scholarships that it definitely is a great idea to try and get some. I've noticed only a small minority that only apply to fresh out of high school students. Best of luck!  EDIT: That dependent should of said independent. My bad! But yes being dependent changes things a lot if your parents are in a solid financial situation. The way they decide how much money to offer in grant and loan is based on your EFC: expected family contribution. So if your family makes a decent amount the government is going to assume their going to pay a decent amount towards your schooling so you dont need a lot of their aid in their mind. I had the situation where my parents made over $100,000 and were unwilling to pay for university for me. Once I became dependent which takes being married/having a baby/being older then 24/some other rare situations then I was able to only use the money I earned which is a lot less to decide how much money I got."

When I was looking for scholarships I used http://www.fastweb.com  Another great resource is to talk to the financial aid department at which ever school you are applying to.

The best loans from our research (#1 son starts college in the fall so we're going through this now) is the following order:  1) Subsidized Federal Direct.  If you qualify.  Low fees (1.068%), low fixed rate (4.9% fixed this year), and interest does not accrue during school.  Has a maximum cap, flexible repayment options.  2) Unsubsidized Federal Direct.  Same fees and rates as the subsidized, interest accrues during school.  Has a maximum cap - the cap really is TOTAL direct loans per year at 5,500/6,500/7,500, of which no more than 3,500/4,500/5,500 may be subsidized during the first three years of school.  Also flexible payback options, e.g. income based, increasing payments, etc..  3) PLUS loans.  Student and parent versions, the student version has flexible payback options.  Higher fees (4.202%), higher rate (6.84% fixed) and a credit check is required.  4) Private Loans.  Fees and interest rates can vary widely, but generally are higher than the Fed programs.  You can get variable rate loans etc. and it may be what you need to do.  You may also need co-signers on these loans.  Even getting a basic rate & fee quote required me to give up private information to web sites that made me want to take a shower after seeing them...we didn't pursue this option!  https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans  Do the FAFSA when your taxes are done next spring.  Your school will get the results and will use it to determine grants.  I was surprised how many assets were NOT included in the reporting.  There are considerations for your degree of independence from your parents, but if you need to be independent for better loan/grant consideration you have a year to prove it.  Also, for the Fall 2015 year you are late for it but there are a lot of scholarships available.  We're kicking ourselves for not looking earlier, but the major my son is taking has several scholarships offered by related trade associations that he might have been eligible for.  Next year...but we could have gotten anywhere from $500 to $5,000 in additional funds from these trade groups.  There are a lot of FREE (don't pay people for it) web sites that list some of the thousands of scholarships out there.  So things like a relative in the military...there are scholarships for every branch.  Service clubs, specific fields of study...thousands of possibilities.  Good luck!"

If you don't know, go through your last few months of bank history and find out.  How good are you at your job? Are you usually on the lower end of that spectrum or higher?  Even if you averaged $2000 per month, you're saying that $900 per month goes to gas and food and etc.   Is that $200 per month for liability insurance? How many tickets do you have on your record? I really hope you're not paying comp and collision on a car worth 5 months of insurance payments. $200 to insure a 16 year old car is ludicrous.   Here's your new budget:   $700 rent $200 Utilities (I'm assuming that's as far down as you can get them, if not look for ways to save here) $100 insurance $300 food $300 gas $400 to savings for a new car   If your current car makes it another 6 months, you now have $2400 to pay for your next car with cash. Drive your current car until it dies, and then go buy a new car. Save $1000-1500 for emergency repairs, and keep building up your savings.

If that $1200 repair happens more than three months from now, you can pay for it out of pocket and hope it bought you some more time to keep saving. If it happens before then, work out a payment plan with your mechanic or borrow the money from someone.  It sucks to pay for repairs on old cars, I know this first-hand. It seems like such a waste until you realize that a car payment would easily eclipse that one-time repair cost multiple times per year."

If all you earn is $2,000 a year you should get all of that back, filing a 1040EZ the standard deduction should offset it.  California income tax probably works along the same lines.  The Payroll taxes...not so much.  In theory you get something back when you retire based on what you pay into medicare and social security over your lifetime, but its not anything you will get back in the short term.

However, with an older car or high mileage, the value of the car is questionable. It could crap out at any time. This makes the loan higher risk for the bank and they simply don't want to take that risk.   Also, I'm not exactly sure what kind of car it was, or what your down payment was, but it seems like a rip-off anyways.

I find that having a relationship with a tenant makes it all too easy for them to have expectations that you will be ok if the rent is late.  If you have to evict them, it creates bad blood.  So, if you can find another renter, you might want to consider this or use your best judgement to determine if this person is at all a risk.  Use a standard lease agreement, but also include addendums that cover things that are important to you.  Who is to care for the lawn?  What repairs is the tenant financially responsible for?  Pets?  Smoking?  Mold or lead paint?  Parking?  Pests?  Other rules?  You can find forms or create them yourself and have them signed along with the lease.  Charge enough for rent to cover your mortgage, taxes, and insurance, but to also set aside a hundred or two hundred dollars a month for potential repairs or issues such as a plumbing issue, A/C repair, septic tank cleaning, etc.  You should have a cushion for these, so that your tenant doesn't have to wait while you scrape together cash for the work to be done."

The Regular ""IT"" card has 1% CB on everything, with a rotating quarterly 5% CB in the different categories. The Student ""IT Chrome"" card is targeted a bit more towards students... You permanently receive 1% CB on everything except for Restaurants and Gas, on which you earn 2%.

Third, you should look into a Roth IRA, I believe you can use the money you put in towards a downpayment on your first home (if needed), talk to a financial advisor to be sure.

personalfinance,3dx98u,DeluxeXL,2,Mon Jul 20 08:03:33 2015 UTC,"You can contribute any time between (inclusive) Jan 1st of this year and when taxes are due (usually Apr 15th next year) for this year's contribution. It doesn't matter how much you will be taxed, since you can contribute as much as you earn (gross amount, before any tax, but after 401(k) income deferral) up to $5500, unless you make more than $116k.    If there is a $1000 minimum to open a Roth IRA at some place, for example - is that $1000 that's already been taxed?   That's irrelevant. $1000 means $1000. If someone pays you $1000 for work done, you can throw it into the IRA right now. You just have to come up with money to pay taxes (from savings, friends, parents, loans, etc.) when they are due.  Generally your tax burden is 15.3% FICA (self-employment rate) plus federal income tax plus state taxes. Income taxes usually have personal exemption and deduction. Since you are self-employed, you should set aside money for taxes."
personalfinance,3dx98u,ribnag,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:04:25 2015 UTC,"Since you file as self employed, the distinction between pre and post tax dollars doesn't really have any meaning (unless you have a shell corp from which you formally ""pay"" yourself, which doesn't sound like the case here).  All of your income could count as either, right up until you actually file your taxes.  So, using $X to fund a Roth just means that you don't get to remove those same dollars from your AGI (and your schedule C and SE's Net Profit) to lower your tax liability.  Effectively, it works the same way for (current year) tax purposes as if you just stuck it in a savings account or spent it on beer.  To estimate your total tax liability, just track what you make in the tax table, and you should overestimate at worst... But don't forget about your self employment taxes.  As for brokerage minimums and other terms of maintaining your account somewhere, that depends entirely on who you go with."
personalfinance,3dx98u,wijwijwij,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:48:50 2015 UTC,"It is a good time to put money into a Roth if you are in a low income year because it may be taxed at a very low rate going in. Since it isn't taxed on the way out, you would ""lock in"" the very low taxation.  I think you may want to wait until Jan 2016 to do your contribution. Then you will know your self employment gross income, your deductible business expenses (if any), and thus your profit.  The compensation you can put into a Roth IRA is not your gross but your net earnings minus half your SE tax if you have no other retirement plan, or $5500, whichever is less. The net earnings is 0.9235 * Sched C profit, the number seen on Sched SE page 1 line 4.  Since you won't know your profit, and net earnings, and SE tax until after end of year, it may make sense to wait, so you don't accidentally overcontribute.  There is a way to remove excess Roth IRA contributions, but it's better to avoid having to do so."
personalfinance,3dx98u,rnelsonee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:43:25 2015 UTC,"DeluxeXL's comment cover the details, but I'll chime in because the concept of fungible money should clear it up if I can explain it properly. What happens is the IRS lets you put money in an IRA whenever you want. Since money is 'fungible' there's really no such thing as ""this dollar is taxed and this isn't"". It's all lumped together and you just settle up with the IRS at the end when you file. The IRS doesn't track or care about money going in  It's easy to understand with employees. Employees receive money with some taxes withheld so it's commonly said to be ""taxed"" money (it's not really, what if withholding is off?). What if they want to put in a Traditional IRA? Well they just put money in, say $1,000. Now when it comes time to file, they tell the IRS ""I put in $1,000"" and the IRS then deducts $1,000 from taxable income and gives them $250 or whatever back. So it doesn't matter where that money came from - they have $1,000 in their account and it cost them $750 to do it.  With you it's like the opposite. Your revenue hasn't been taxed yet, but that doesn't matter. If you put $1,000 into a Roth IRA, then you can put it in whenever you want (1/1 to filing due date the next year as noted). You don't even have to have earned the money yet, since this all goes by calendar year (so you'd have to earn the money by 12/31/15). Also note for tax purposes, aside from the separate Saver's Credit, a Roth IRA contribution has no tax consequences anyway. It's like asking ""When can I put money into my savings account?"". Just put it in when you want."

It doesn't work with DVRs (Tivo, etc.), some channels allow pause, some don't. Some allow you to watch older episodes, some don't. There are pretty much different rules for every channel.  Here's a chart showing what's allowed by each channel  To me, clearing my schedule for an evening to watch the release of a TV show that was recorded months ago is insane. I suppose that there might be value if you watch a whole lot of TV and schedule around it, but for anyone else, it's pretty much all of the bad bits of cable for a price that's not too far away from cable.

personalfinance,3du26p,brokengoose,3,Sun Jul 19 15:15:25 2015 UTC,"The best part of using sling TV or Hulu plus is that there's no contract. You can cancel and subscribe at any time. I usually cancel my Hulu plus subscription in the summer because there are virtually no network shows airing new episodes (also, Hulu is good for ""delayed"" watching if you're out of the house a lot). With Sling TV, you can add an HBO subscription for the months where your favorite shows come on (e.g., just get it for April-June for GoT). You could do the same for the Sling service itself if you're only interested in certain sports (sign up in the fall for football and cancel in the spring, etc.)  I've been a cord cutter for 7 years now and I love it.

Over time you just start watching different stuff (or less stuff), rather than being annoyed that the stuff you watch isn't available.  Unfortunately if you are a sports fan, ie. you follow your favorite MLB/NHL/NBA/WNBA/NFL/MLS/etc team(s) and want to watch their games live. In that situation cord cutting is going to suck, and while Sling can make it better, it won't equal cable. When you consider all the expense of various subscription services (like Sling) and the various online sports streaming options (MLB Extra Innings, NHL Center ice..., NFL Gameday), if you're a big enough sports fan, it might make sense to hold onto the cable or satellite subscription.

If you manage to max out the limit ($17k) from ages 20-30... you'll have at least $170k in your 401k at age 30, and it should 8x to about 1.3million at age 60.... definitely enough for early retirement (if you continue contributing after age 30)"

Some company matches take one year and if you leave before then that money gets taken out of your account. Since you are only there for six more  months this would be something worth looking into.   If the match does not vest, I think investing in a Roth IRA would be better than a 401k from a fee perspective if the funds you were allowed to choose from had higher expense ratios."

You are co-owners with her brother. What kind of person is he? Does he have stable income, career, etc? Is he likely to pull shenanigans like use the land for dumping garbage or hazardous waste? There are some nightmare scenarios where owning land can turn into a liability.   Most importantly, her mother is alive, what does she want to happen? Is this her way of keeping the brood home so she can see her grandkids grow up close to home? Nothing wrong with that. People give their kids homes and land all the time. This avoids probate court and contested wills if they die unexpectedly. Accept her generosity, if you don't live locally,  visit every year. Make sure your co-owner keeps up the property and does not alter or encumber it, sell the mineral rights or other things w/o your permission, or simply ask him to buy you out by taking a mortgage on the property.

personalfinance,3dwid5,ajpew,2,Mon Jul 20 02:58:31 2015 UTC,"As someone who is in their mid-twenties and receiving a relatively low salary, should I switch over to a Roth IRA?   That's probably the right choice. What's ""relatively low""? (In particular, what tax bracket are you in? Also potentially relevant is how much to the next one, and what's your traditional IRA balance?)  The general rule of thumb I see is that if you're in a lower tax bracket, the same tax bracket, or slightly higher now than you expect to be at retirement, Roth makes sense. (""Slightly higher"" in part because the Roth has other benefits and increased flexibility.)   If so, how exactly would I go about this?   There are a couple possibilities. First, you could just open a Roth IRA and start contributing to that instead of your tIRA, but leave your tIRA as it is. Second, you could open a Roth IRA at Vanguard, start contributing to that instead of your tIRA, and move your Roth IRA to Vanguard as well. (Not sure how to do this offhand, but I'm sure it's not to hard to find on their site.) Third, you can actually do a Roth conversion where you convert your tIRA into a Roth IRA. However, this will make you pay taxes on the amount you convert, so you have to be able to pay those without using the money you're converting.  My feeling is that the conversion is likely to be the best option under all of the following conditions: (1) the Roth makes sense for your income in the first place, (2) you can afford the extra tax burden (one option would be to wait until near the end of the year, do a dry run of your taxes to estimate, and then determine whether and how much to convert), and (3) the conversion doesn't push you into the next tax bracket. But don't take my word for that. (Vanguard has a calculator for whether you should convert; you could check that out.) If any of those conditions fail, then where you keep your tIRA money is a matter of the expense ratios Schwab gives you and your personal preference of if you want the convenience of having everything in one provider. (Also note that you could convert only part of your tIRA balance, in which case the part you convert has to satisfy (2) and (3).)"

You save on taxes later but you need the ability to keep putting the money in the account to both take advantage of compounding interest and keep the tax advantage. If you are unsure and willing to entertain making a different move later then the Roth is ok to try for now. I'm not someone who prognosticates about future tax policies, and I generally see the difference between the 2 IRAs as a wash unless you have income volatility (i.e. sometimes it makes sense to avoid taxes now, sometimes it makes sense to avoid taxes later depending on what's happening now)."

Personal exemption+standard deduction is huge if you only make $20k.

Additionally, ""Roth IRAs are not subject to Required Minimum Distributions during the owner's lifetime"" That could be a very significant benefit. http://www.rothira.com/roth-ira-required-minimum-distribution-rmd  I realize this is hypothetical, and if the OP shared his expected  income for this tax year a better argument could be made for either type of account."

When you do a conversion from Traditional to Roth, the assets at their current value are sold, the cash is moved to a new account, and new assets can be purchased. But you don't lose any value in this transaction.   What actually happens on your income taxes depends on your tax brackets, which could be very low, and there will be little tax implication from this conversion."
personalfinance,3dwid5,EngineerinLA,0,Mon Jul 20 04:38:34 2015 UTC,"When you convert from traditional to Roth you must pay taxes on the capital gains. This must be paid at your current tax rate and NOT the capital gains rate of 15%. This is only advisable if you are having a very low income year and this is the exception and not the norm.  Most people fall into lower tax brackets after they retire. Unless you retire before 62.5 and spend more than you did when you worked full time (not likely due to daily commuting and food costs - most financial experts estimate you spend about 80% when retired) you will benefit more from a traditional than a Roth.  The caviet being you haven't already maxed out the traditional.

I'm not trying to be coy I want to understand what I do not understand here.   Are you suggesting a Traditional IRA is better because the small tax advantage it gives on a tax return for a low income person is better than doing a Roth IRA, because that small tax advantage allowed for more money to be contributed to the Traditional IRA, in the event this person cannot fully fund either account? If you have to wait for the tax return money, isn't too late to actually invest in a IRA for the tax year in question?  I realize its treated as income and not as capital gains for the purpose of taxation. I think you're disregarding how little tax a person who is making low income has to pay (low income is hardly an exception in America). ""Taxable income"" decides your tax brackets and tax rates, personal exemption+standard deduction makes your taxable income lower, and this difference is really huge for a low income person.

A 20 year old with a small salary can save more than a newly rich older person if the young person started at 20. If you have money split between a Roth and traditional account then compounding interest doesn't work as well if you have all the money in the same account. For purposes of law, the Roth and Traditional IRAs cannot be combined. If you do you face tax penalties (as I outlined).   Your analysis of taxable income isn't relevant here. If OP needs to maximize his resources, having money taken out before tax helps them now (by reducing the amount Uncle Sam takes now) with a Traditional IRA. It also helps later, because unless OP is really unfortunate, OP will have a higher tax bracket the last few years before they retire as compared to when they retire.  Overall folks face a lower tax burden when retired. This makes the traditional a better option. The Roth was written for folks who max out the traditional but sought another tax avoidance strategy. Financial advisors profit massively stroking tax avoidance fears pushing financial bullshit on people who shouldn't fear taxes.

Easy mathematical proof:  Formula for compound interest = Principal (1 + rate) ^ time  If you split the principal into two separate piles, you simply get 2 * (Principal / 2) * (1 + rate) ^ time, which simplifies back into Principal (1 + rate) ^ time.   If OP needs to maximize his resources, having money taken out before tax helps them now (by reducing the amount Uncle Sam takes now) with a Traditional IRA.   No it doesn't at all. You can't compare pre-tax money to post-tax money like that and say that it ""maximizes resources"", just because a Traditional IRA didn't have taxes taken out.   It also helps later, because unless OP is really unfortunate, OP will have a higher tax bracket the last few years before they retire as compared to when they retire.   Whatever tax bracket that OP has later in his working career has little bearing on what choice he should choose today.

Go to your bank, or better your credit union, and get a letter of preapproval. At this point, you know what your interest rate is and the maximum monthly payment you'll make. That number will only go down from here on out, because you don't have to penf the while amount you're approved for Email at least two dealerships (more is better) for the brand you're interested in, and negotiate the car and price you want. Play the dealers off other to get a better price. When you decide on a dealership and deal, go in and pay with your newly approved loan.   If you negotiate in person, 9 times out of 10 you will lose. If you go with dealer financing other than a 0% offer, you will lose. If you get your own financing and negotiate an ""out the door"" price in writing, you win."

Will earning money from the LLC change that? Do they care?  There's definitely a scenario where the whole plan is legit and a good idea, and not shady at all. It's called a family business. The fact that you're dubious and asking questions here instead of trusting your parents is the only thing suspicious about it."

From a tax perspective it can be like a corporation or a partnership. Run it right and your personal assets are not subject to debts or judgments incurred by the LLC, just like a corporation. There's nothing inherently shady about it whatsoever.  There's a sweet spot between having your parents make all the money and gift you up to 26k after tax, and having you receive a share of the income and be taxed in a low bracket. Without actual numbers it's impossible to say what's the best path. Hopefully one of your parents is an accountant.  It sounds like your parents want you to own a piece of a legitimate business.

personalfinance,3dwyjb,hungryhippodog1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:59:51 2015 UTC,"CVS gives you money back onto your receipt called ""ExtraBucks"". The trick is utilizing these ExtraBucks with store sales going on each week AND also pairing them with other kinds of coupons you can find (from newspapers, manufacturer's website, etc.) to get you the best deals. Trust me, there are people who are soooo good at matching deals out there...who have gotten stuff worth hundreds of dollars for merely $10 bucks per month because they know how to coupon. Some of them have garages stocked with ""free"" stuff.  There are so many videos and blogs out there that will teach you how to get started.   There are many ways to get ExtraBucks:   1) There are CVS deals each week that gives you daily ExtraBucks that you can use immediately or at a later time.   2) Also, if you shop regularly at CVS, every quarter of the year, I believe 2% of your total amount of money spent at CVS during that time period will print out in ExtraBucks. More ExtraBucks for you.   3) This part might be more interesting to you since you fill prescriptions at CVS. You can get ExtraBucks from using the pharmacy if you're enrolled in the Pharmacy ExtraBucks program.  Each individual that's enrolled in the program gets $5.00 in ExtraBucks for every 10 points you earn through filling prescriptions (1 prescription = 1 point | one (1) 90-day prescription = 3 points).   Multiple people in the family can enroll onto the same loyalty card, and each person can get up to a max of $50.00 in ExtraBucks per year. So, if you have 3 people enrolled on the card, you can get up to $150.00 in ExtraBucks per year per family.   You can also get points for EB using other pharmacy stuff, like getting flu shots, enrolling in text message alerts, enrolling in automatic refill, etc.   **NOTE:  Unfortunately, you cannot use any kind of ExtraBucks to pay for prescriptions or any kind of pharmacy stuff. You can only use ExtraBucks to buy front store merchandise, with the exception of a few things like alcohol, tobacco, stamps, etc."

People who have a high income with state income tax and/or a large mortgage will tend to end up itemizing.  Keep in mind a tax deduction only saves you the amount of taxes you'd otherwise pay on that money. So where you're in the 33% bracket, you're still only saving 33 cents for ever dollar of mortgage interest and property taxes you're spending. It's a nice advantage, but you should evaluate carefully. Keep in mind that once you own you also have maintenance costs (~1% house value per year) and if you ever need to move you'll likely pay a 5-6% realtor fee to get ride of a house."

The procedure was a bit awkward, but I felt no pain during the removal.  My dentist even mentioned it was a particularly difficult removal as far as how hard he had to work to get everything out.  I would say this specifically depends on the person and their general anxiety towards dentistry.  I suppose it also depends on how skilled your dentist/surgeon is.  People had me convinced that wisdom teeth removal would be the most traumatic experience of my life, but it wasn't nearly as bad as I feared.  I literally felt more pain having cavities drilled on."
personalfinance,3dv5to,prophywife,2,Sun Jul 19 20:34:51 2015 UTC,Is she eligible for insurance through her employer? There are dental plans available through the healthcare marketplace (sometimes) but the only worthwhile insurance (from a patient perspective) is one that has most of the cost covered through the employer. If she has no coverage her best bet is a dental school/hospital residency program as the cost will be half as much. Sedation is expensive and a luxury although it does make the surgery easier for the dentist/surgeon and the patient.

It's a credit card meant specifically for this (among many other things related to medical and veterinary care).  She can shop around see which oral surgeons will take it.  She should also be up front about having no dental insurance. Often dentists will work with their patients in this regard. (My dentist often provides me free xrays or free visits because I don't have dental insurance.). The oral surgeon I went to took 15% right off the top of the bill because I didn't have dental insurance.

Soft inquiries do not affect your credit (when you pull your credit) but you normally have to pay for those.   Personally, I pull one report every 4 months but if you want to pull them all at one time it is a decent snapshot of your current credit situation. At 17, if you have not opened any accounts you probably do not need to check it. However, there have been cases of young people having their identity stolen and realizing it when they turned 18.  I also would recommend credit karma as a free way to monitor your credit through TransUnion and Equifax I believe and it also estimates your credit score.

To me it looks like all your problems should be solved once you find a job (the debt shouldn't be a major problem right now - you'll have to pay some extra fees for not paying it back, but you won't face any legal actions right away) So I'd really make looking for a job (could be part-time) my priority - dedicate at least 2 hourls a day to this! If you can find a job and you can start paying towards your debt again I also don't see any problem with going to university. But really do make paying back your debt your priority!  Of course what you're probably more concerned about is getting money in the short term to cover your daily expenses. I don't have any advice on borrowing money, but maybe you'll find other ways to get some extra money: Do you have some stuff you can sell?

Once you have a minimum amount, you can open a brokerage account and invest through that.  Merill Lynch has very safe options for small investors.  Your portfolio is just your brokerage account's holdings.  It can have a variety of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs and other investments in it.  Don't expect huge returns.

Someone from another city without any attachment to your dad.  You might set up a rental agreement with your dad that covers the cost of taxes.   I would take the gift and set up a regular rental agreement with new tenants and hire my father as the landlord.  I'd split profits 50/50 with my dad and put 50% of my piece of profits in an investmentsavings account, probably Swedish Avanza's Vanguard S&P500 infexfund, for emergencies and to boost my fathers probably shitty pension.   I would meet up with my dad and go over his finances and set up a reasonable budget. I suggest you use a shared YNAB budget that is synced through dropbox.   All house expenses would be paid from a separate account that I put money into and he uses to cover expenses.  All house tax/lawyer/insurance expenses will be paid from a seperate bank account that I have control over. He can only view the bank statementa. I will put the money into it from the house income account.  All house income goes to a separate account which I have full control over and he can view the bank statement of. The Swedish App Tink could probably work as a way for him to view the bank statement from greece.  Budgeting would be a basic condition for even considering putting my name on the property.  I'd buy my father and myself a scansnap scanner and set it up to automatically upload scanned documents to a shared Evernote notebook. That way you won't have to wait a week for important papers to be signed or read. All house docs will be in that notebook and my father will have viewing and uploading rights.  Then I'd keep that arrangement until my dad is on his feet again.   With periodic budget and bank history reconciliation checks together with him every 6 months until I sell the property back to him for a few pennies.  Its a lot of risk and work on your part.

personalfinance,3dts9e,wang-bang,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:36:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the in depth and practical answer. We are of the same mind regarding most things. I am talking to a lawyer and a financial adviser today as a first step. I have a couple of follow up questions of the overall approach as I find the practical advice sound. First regarding    Budgeting would be a basic condition for even considering putting my name on the property.   These will be the hardest points to drive through. My father is a low life ex-hippie that has had seasonal work for his entire life. He wouldn't know what financial responsibility was if it hit him in the face. That is one of the reasons he ended up in this scenario in the first place. Luckily the property is debt free as my father built most of it himself and has payed the loan he took to buy the land. Is it sound to create a quarterly budget? During the winter months he has almost no income and I don't think it would not be feasible (albeit reasonable) to have a tight budget.    You might set up a rental agreement with your dad that covers the cost of taxes.   My father will be living in the house, at least during winter time. He has previously rented to tourists during the summer for extra cash. Presumably he could sublet it if our contract allows for it right? I am not certain I like that if I am to be economically responsible for the property. I should probably take over that business and try to make it as profitable as possible? I think there is potential that is not utilized at the moment.   Then I'd keep that arrangement until my dad is on his feet again.   He sees it as his inheritance to me, so he would probably not be interested in buying it back."

Since it is your dad you might find it easier to use YNAB together coupled with a dropbox business account. The YNAB android app lets your dad put down expenses, and track, directly in his phone as he pays for it. The dropbox account lets you sync YNAB over several computers and android phones.  I would not set quartely budgets. I would set budgets for the money that comes in, when the money comes in, and the basic expenses that must be covered in the next year. I.e. taxes, electricity, water, or other basic fees that can be predicted or hedged against.  The desktop YNAB application will then show you the amount of revenue you need to cover basic expenses up to that month.   All your dad must do is to log the purchase when he makes it.   Then, if he wants to, he can collaberate with you over the phone to set up a budget when the house generates an income or needs extra funding from either of you.  So that would be the property budget for the house.   But another, either complete or complementary, solution to this situation is to sit down with him and create a personal budget for him. It might be the cheapest solution for both of you since I guess the property taxes would be higher for ex-patriates living abroad.  My first thought was that your dad has to give up living in the house completely until his financial situation is safe again. Renting it out on yearly leases and living elsewhere might be the most financially sound option. But you have to look up  the expected numbers and see what his expectations are, and if they can be changed.   Then you test it for a year and make a decision together based on the data you have.  I dont know, but Im guessing that greek state pensions wont help him stay afloat as a retiree.     My father will be living in the house, at least during winter time. He has previously rented to tourists during the summer for extra cash. Presumably he could sublet it if our contract allows for it right?    Maybe, that is what the lawyers needs to help you with.   I would let him sublet for operating costs + a contribution emergency repairs fund since he is family.   I am not certain I like that if I am to be economically responsible for the property.   Find out what those responsibilities mean before you commit to anything. Don't let him pressure you. If he does then point out the work you need to do before commiting to anything. I'm guessing that this is going to be pretty emotional to him so stay mindful of that.   I should probably take over that business and try to make it as profitable as possible? I think there is potential that is not utilized at the moment.   Well, maybe, but you already have a job and you're trying to keep the family home.   I would focus on setting up a rental that can cover operating costs and hedge for retaining the property in the first few years.   I.e. all basic costs covered month-to-month plus 12 months costs for renovation and to cover a lack of revenue. Just in case you cant get tenants because of local unrest, or a lengthy renovation.    He sees it as his inheritance to me, so he would probably not be interested in buying it back.    Look up the rules around inheritance and buying the property. Talk to a lawyer and set up the most profitable arrangement. That seems to be what your dad wants.  This would mean a lot of work for both of you.   Can you dad help you out with this, or his he just looking to be uninvolved?"
personalfinance,3dts9e,wang-bang,2,Mon Jul 20 17:00:54 2015 UTC,"Wow, again really solid advice I will consider everything carefully. Renting the house to another family is something that has not crossed my mind.   I did speak to a lawyer today and he told me he will look into it. So now I sit back and wait.   Can you dad help you out with this, or his he just looking to be uninvolved?   He is very much involved but him being in Greece and of a Greek mind I prefer to cover all my bases.

personalfinance,3dwn7x,friendy11,2,Mon Jul 20 03:47:15 2015 UTC,"If you don't want to actively farm, you could form a corporation to seperate the farm from your personal affairs and lease the farm to someone who does enjoy farming.  You may also have a neighboring farm who would like to use the land so finding a tenant would be easier.  Incorporating is beneficial because you protect yourself from liability and you can write off an obscene amount of expenses on taxes for a farm.  You might also qualify for subsidies and other incentives from USDA and state Ag department.  Another option is to raise livestock or cross fence the pasture and rent out paddocks to recreational equestrians and/or beef co-ops.  You can have minimal involvement as the owners are responsible for the animals health and care, you would handle maintenance of the facilities and notifying owners if their animals need attention.  I think the most important thing going forward is to maintain your water rights.  Check to see what kind of rights you have because some can be revoked or reduced if you don't use them all or use them for non beneficial purposes.  Water is king and God in agriculture, a property without a water right is nearly useless and the value will tank."

You stuck with this shitty job this long, I dont see a reason why you cant stick with it alittle longer until you find a better one.  I would NOT go on a trip unless you have spare money to do so, $5,000 in an emergency fund is expected, anything over that you should treat yourself, but not too much. Your also still living at home so I would set my real goal to save money and move out and find a place of your own. Start paying your student loan debt as well.

As for the trip, you really have to decide what your priorities are.  How long is it going to take you to make back the 2K you're going to spend for the vacation?  What other major expenses do you have besides loans?  The most conservative advice you'll get on this sub is to use your savings to get out of debt as quickly as possible and then set up your emergency fund and then retirement accounts.  So then you might have spending money when you're 30.  (If I'm honest with myself, I'm probably one of these people).  However, other people have different priorities.  However, it seems you're uneasy about spending that much money given your current circumstances, so I'd just go with that gut instinct."

Where are you getting 60 days from? It's only 30 days. It must be removed from your report if the CA fails to validate within 30 days, per Federal law.   2) If the agency responds within the 60 days proving this is valid and paid off, would the 7 year marker for removal be reset to 2015?   What exactly are you contesting? A validation is not used to prove if you've paid a debt off, but only if you owe said debt.  It does not reset, that is called re-aging.and is illegal under Federal law.   3) Am I running the risk that the creditor could respond stating this has not been paid off and thus introduce a nightmare of having to prove payment?

A hard credit check to open an account will temporarily reduce your credit score, but this does not really matter unless you were planning to get a car loan or a mortgage soon.  I have no experience with lending clubs, obviously the math suggests 7%-12% interest is better than 20%-24%. Can someone else provide some input on this option?

personalfinance,3dwjkm,Kilifi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:41:40 2015 UTC,"First off, your credit score is the least of your worries if you're paying hundreds per month in interest. Secondly, opening up a new card will put a hard inquiry on your credit report, yes, but that effect is offset by your increased total limit (if approved, which lowers your utilization) and the latter has a much bigger impact on your FICO. Lastly, your credit score will increase significantly by the time you pay off the debt, assuming you do pay it off before the 0% balance transfer promo expires and you start accruing interest again.  Check out the Chase Slate, $0 balance transfer fee within 60 days of opening the account I believe it's 0% for 18 months. This would put you at $388/mo minimum to pay it off, so you'll be just fine with your $500/mo and save a bunch of money in interest."

personalfinance,3dwj6w,c2reason,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:22:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks, from that, the disqualifying makes sense.. regular tax rate is applied to the difference between the actual amount I paid and the FMV on the last day of the quarter..  However Im reading the description on the qualifying and still lost..   *Your compensation income from ESPP shares in a qualifying disposition is the lesser of two amounts.  The first is the discount allowed on your purchase, determined as of the ""grant date,"" which is normally the first day of the offering period. (Your company should inform you if a different grant date is used.) Note that this is not necessarily the actual discount you received on the shares. It's the discount determined as if you bought the shares on the grant date, even though you didn't buy the shares that day and couldn't have done so even if you wanted. Beginning with the 2010 tax year, you should find the numbers needed to calculate this amount on Form 3922 supplied by your employer. It's the difference between the fair market value of the stock on the grant date and the purchase price determined as of the grant date (not the actual purchase price).  The second number, which comes into play only if smaller than the first one, is essentially your profit from the shares. More precisely, it's the difference between the fair market value of the stock when you disposed of it (normally your sale price, but you would need to find the value if you disposed of the shares without selling them, such as a gift or donation) and the actual amount you paid for the shares.  The smaller of these two numbers (the discount or the profit) is the amount of compensation income you have as a result of the disposition.*  With Comcast I get a 15% discount off the lowest price in the quarter.  So does that mean I owe my regular tax rate on just 15% of whatever the stock was worth on the first day of the quarter in that first scenario?  The stock went up, substantially so I don't think that second scenario comes into play."
personalfinance,3dwj6w,c2reason,2,Mon Jul 20 03:45:05 2015 UTC,"They literally take the lowest closing price from the quarter? (I have to assume closing, since intraday would be crazy.) Are you sure they don't just look at the first and least day of the period? But anyway, no matter what I expect you should be using the price on the first day of the period for calculating your discount allowed (so 15% of the price on that day). I'd dig around the documents on your brokerage account. I'd expect them to list the numbers on the documentation for the ESPP purchase."

Still good since I've made a good 35=55% on each period but dang.. thats a bummer."

The Discover IT Card for students is a great option for first time credit card holders. If you want to maximize cash back then the CitiBank Double Cash card might be another one you want to look into. A lot of the cards with high cash back require a decently high credit score. http://www.nerdwallet.com/credit-cards/ Here is a great place to compare credit card offers and it is what I use to find the best rewards. I currently have a PNC Card with 1.0-1.5% Cash back and the Amazon cash back rewards card. I would recommend paying off the current balance or the statement balance every month that way you don't carry interest. Keep your credit utilization below 20% of your limit and it shouldn't adversely affect your credit score. I am not sure if becoming an authorized user will affect your credit seeing as the account is in his name but that is something google can probably tell you. Here is the best advice I have ever been given/discovered in terms of long term planning... manage your Cash Flows. For example, if you make $600 in a month you can't necessarily spend $600 in a month if you are going to run a $1000 deficit for another month down the road. Unfortunately I do not have experience with anything other than a savings account with a pretty significant emergency fund. A lot of experts recommend 3 to 6 months of expenses for an emergency fund and even though your expenses vary in college it might help to keep a few thousand saved up."

Use this to your advantage.   Side note: as you get better at faking the spending, you will be able to spot the bargain crowd -- sidle up to them quietly and learn from them, but do not embarrass them in public.  Also, there is usually a crowd of freeloaders and hustlers in NYC -- again learn from them, but try not to judge too harshly, just enough to keep yourself honest and keep them from seeing you as a mark.

personalfinance,3dw8iq,Turtlebacons,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:33:46 2015 UTC,"Some forums suggest start with the highest interest rate, but I didn’t know if the larger amounts with smaller interest rates need more attention first.   If you have a finite amount of money each month to put towards your debt, you will pay the least interest by paying down the highest interest rate debt first. Paying off low-balance debts instead is a psychological game to trick yourself into paying more than that ""finite"" amount towards your debt by making you feel good about eliminating a debt. Personally I think it's best to learn to see past those sorts of tricks than to try playing them on yourself.  Assuming you are disciplined enough to put the maximum possible towards your debts each month, the only questionable one is your best buy card with the 0% intro rate. For now, put as much as you can towards the other cards, and keep track of how much that is each month. Then figure out how long it will take you to save up that $1300 at that rate... for example if you're putting $650/month towards your debt, you could pay off the best buy in 2 months. In that case, 2 months before your intro rate expires, go back to minimum payments on the other cards and put $650/month towards the best buy card so that you never see 27% interest."
personalfinance,3dw8iq,amnmonix,2,Mon Jul 20 01:46:58 2015 UTC,"If you are paying can and will pay more than minimum payments, it doesn't matter if you choose the debt snowball or debt avalanche method. The reason that is doesn't matter is because the extra amounts will result in you paying less than projected in both situations.  When I calculated the savings in interest by choosing avalanche over snowball it was only $800. I chose snowball and paid extra on my debt ($105K). In the end I only paid $18K, when the calculator predicted $40K+ for both methods.  Pick the method that is best for your situation.  Here is an excel calculator you can play around with http://www.vertex42.com/Calculators/debt-reduction-calculator.html"
personalfinance,3dw8iq,wijwijwij,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:56:57 2015 UTC,"Sayng it doesn't matter is deceiving. You're right that speeding up your payments or making irregular payments will result in different amount of interest paid overall than modeled by strict snowball or avalanche.  But for OP, with such huge differences in interest rates, there is a clear argument for paying off highest interest rate debt first. If OP can afford to pay more than expected, OP should still direct that to highest rate debt.  OP should not target the $30K 5% student loan until after the five CCs are repaid.  The Excel spreadsheet you linked is a good one for OP to prove why tackling the $30K debt first would be costlier."
personalfinance,3dw8iq,wijwijwij,2,Mon Jul 20 02:04:27 2015 UTC,"OP: You may be thinking that attacking the $30K at 5% debt is important because it generates more absolute interest per month than other debts. It turns out this is not what you should target to pay least interest overall.  You are only able to devote a certain amount to repaying each month (after meeting all minimums). Say $200. Imagine dividing each loan into chunks of size $200. You can only throw your chunk at one such debt. Which one will you throw it at? One of the debts at 23%. Then 20%, etc."
personalfinance,3dw8iq,Persona_Transplant,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:11:28 2015 UTC,"Yup - pay off Crapital 1 first, and then the Best Buy loan, while paying the minimums on the rest. Then pick off he loans with the highest interest, one at a time. Good luck!"

There are basically two recommended methods to paying down debts: start with the smallest debt, or start with the highest interest debt. The latter, for the most part, is the ""mathematically sound"" answer; the former is probably more psychologically satisfying for most people. Starting with the largest is the worst of both worlds in your case. The 20+% cards will bury you while you're paying down the student loan; I can think of literally no reason to start with that."
personalfinance,3dw8iq,FictionFawkes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:59:25 2015 UTC,"Why cant OP open a 0% apr and 0% transfer fee card and transfer highest apr debt to that card and hit it pretty hard while paying minimum on other cards and put student loan in deferment for a year and use that money to pay to the credit card debt after graduating. Or you can do what other poster said, ask for loan from bank, pay off all cards, you would have a fixed rate and one loan to deal with except for your student loans."
personalfinance,3dw8iq,CommondeNominator,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:10:49 2015 UTC,"All the comments here are right in telling you to go highest interest rate first are correct for two reasons.   Interest on those CC's will kill you, they'll also take less time to pay off than your $30k and will skyrocket your credit score when paid down, barring any major delinquencies and chargeoffs you've had. Your Federal loans will work with you.    Let's say you pay $12k over the next 5 years and wipe out your credit card debt completely. You're making progress on your federal loans and then you lose your job, or suffer an injury or whatever. You call your federal loan servicer (who you pay the bill to) and explain the situation. They will lower your payment or defer it completely, though it does accumulate interest in the meantime and capitalizes on that interest every 6 months.   If you had paid all that $12k to your federal loans and the same scenario happens, you've got a slightly lower SL bill but all the other minimums are full fuckin price.   After the CC is taken care of, I would pay off the $2k loan since it will take a short amount of time and simplify life with only one debt. It's a lower interest rate than the feds but the difference in interest for <1yr payoff is less than $100."
personalfinance,3dw8iq,Lo1o,0,Mon Jul 20 04:19:55 2015 UTC,"Go to your bank immediately and get a loan to pay off the credit cards (and later on Best Buy).  Even if you can make the minimum payment, all new purchases will have interest add-on as soon as they hit your account.  A consolidated loan will have much low interest rate.  Good luck"

personalfinance,3dw6l8,thatguyJP,4,Mon Jul 20 01:12:42 2015 UTC,"Your credit utilization is (IIRC) the biggest component of your score. $450/500 is through the roof. What matters is the score at your statement date, so if you put $450 on it, got the bill, and paid it in full, your utilization for that month will still show as $450 even after your payment.  The good news is you have to do very little to get your score back up: don't charge so much on the card (or charge it but then pay it down before the statement date) then wait a month until after your next statement. From what other people on /r/pf have said, your utilization during anything but the most recent statement doesn't affect your score."
personalfinance,3dw6l8,evaned,3,Mon Jul 20 01:16:37 2015 UTC,"High utilization is one of many red flags for creditors. While it may not make sense to you that your score dropped this much, you should also consider that you have no other positives on your credit report which can help offset you maxing out your card.  730 feels artificially high for someone with effectively no previous credit. I seem to remember it taking me a while to break 700 once I started, largely due to the short nature of my credit history.  Keep your utilization low. Don't carry a balance (this doesn't hurt your score but is still a bad idea). Wait it out. Solid credit takes time."
personalfinance,3dw6l8,Turtlebacons,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:29:16 2015 UTC,How much would be a good amount for my bill to be at each month?
personalfinance,3dw6l8,Chadleybradley,3,Mon Jul 20 01:42:22 2015 UTC,the thing about utilization is that is has no history. So you could go 100% one month and 0% the next month and if anyone was looking at your credit report they would only see the 0%. So really it only matters if your looking to use your credit in that month. FYI they report the statement balance when the statement is generated. So it would remain 100% until the statement with 0% is published.  Friendly reminder you only need to pay the statement balance by the statement due date and you will never pay interest. Also this effectively gives you a 30+ day free loan for any money borrowed
personalfinance,3dw6l8,Chadleybradley,2,Mon Jul 20 01:48:09 2015 UTC,Oh so it doesn't really matter as long as the month before I go to apply for a loan or something along the lines of that I make sure to have a low utilization?

personalfinance,3dw6l8,pho1701,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:51:39 2015 UTC,"right, pretty much the statement balance before you need your credit to be best is the one that needs to be as low as possible."

You'll need at least 50,000 miles to get a standard round trip domestic ticket, and more for international.  1 mile is usually worth between 1-2.5 cents.  Please see the Miles vs Points FAQ.  In general, there are two types of cards, cash back and miles.  You can 2% back using a good cash-back card, like the Citi DoubleCash or Amex Fidelity.  2% back on $1200/mo is $24, so you'd be ahead $4 every month, for a grand total of $48/yr.  (Most cards, however, only give 1% back, so you'd be losing money.)  In miles terms, you'd get 14,400/yr, which will get you about a quarter of the way towards a domestic economy round-trip ticket on most airlines, at a cost $240/yr.  In other words, you'd be buying miles at 1.67 cents each.  This can be a good price, but it's highly dependent on which airline and where you want to go.  As recommended above, you should look into getting a card with a large signup bonus, as the $400 (or 50,000 miles) will significantly change the math in your favor.

personalfinance,3dvdmh,Bokbreath,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:52:00 2015 UTC,"From the FAQ thread:   Growing up, I thought that miles actually meant miles. If someone offered me 25,000 airline miles at approval for their credit card, I thought that I could travel the world. 25,000 miles should get me around the world 3 times. That's not the case, and I wish they would do away with the misleading term ""miles"" and deal strictly in points or cash back.  ""Miles"" comes from the number of miles you have traveled, not the number of miles you can travel in the future. It isn't a particularly misleading term, at least it didn't used to be. Now that the programs are so much more complicated, switching to 'points' probably makes more sense."

Any personal finances (student loans, credit cards, spending money) is your own responsibility.  (Side note: This ""percentage of income"" formula is how debt gets divvied up when you get divorced, but I digress...)  If she scoffs at this, I would seriously reevaluate your relationship.

I currently work in a warehouse and I got that gig via a temp agency. They hired me on full time, and now I have a decent wage and full benefits.  2) Take your medication. Bipolars can be really good at the ""Well, I feel great now, so apparently I don't need these meds anymore"" thinking. You can't fix your situation until your brain behaves.  3) Your friends will come back (well, most of them) once they see you have your poop in a group.  4) $500 will get you a car. Not a great car, but basic transportation. You will likely have to learn how to fix it yourself. Everything you need is on YouTube or Google. If you have a car, you can get a gig delivering pizza. Good pizza guys make $18-20 an hour.  5) The way to success is a series of small victories. Got a temp assignment? Victory. Got a nice suit at Salvation Army for $12? Victory.  6) You need to identify and eliminate self-defeating behaviors. Smoking is a financial killer (yes, I know it's hard to quit; I'm right there with ya). So is procrastination. You need to get out of the house and get some exercise which will make you look and feel better.  7) Own your sh*t. OK, you made some dumb mistakes. It happened. It's over. Move forward and see what the next 30 years holds in store for you.  8) Find a local Legal Aid office to help with your son. They exist to help out poor folks. Which is you.  Good luck!"

personalfinance,3dw14r,aBoglehead,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:36:14 2015 UTC,"How much should I contribute to my IRA per month/year?   You should contribute as much as you can afford to. I would recommend maxing out the IRA ($5,500/year) since you do not have access to a 401k. If you have the cash for a lump sum investment into the IRA then do that. If not, then making monthly contributions are good too.   Should I look into a 401k? If so - where?   If you are a salaried employee, the 401k is only available via the employer. If you are self-employed then you have additional options to open your own retirement account.   Should I look into any kind of investing?   Build an emergency fund first before you consider investing. You can consider investing in a taxable brokerage account after you maxed out your IRA for the year.   Check out the Personal Finance Wiki for more information. Some topics you may be particularly interested in are Why You Need an Emergency Fund, Investing, and How Does An IRA Work?."
personalfinance,3dw14r,frestyle,0,Mon Jul 20 00:40:55 2015 UTC,"You can contribute up to $5.5k/year into an IRA. The IRS will not allow you to exceed that limit.   A 401k is by definition through an employer, so if your employer doesn't offer one it's not an option.  While investing outside of a tax-advantaged retirement account is an option, it would be a lot better if you had a 401k. If, in a few years, you quit your job and moved to a company that had a 401k, it would probably be better to save your extra money in a savings account until then, then max out the 401k until your savings are depleted, than to put money into a taxable investment now.   Also, if you are planning on buying a house in the next 5 years or so, now would be a good time to save for that."
personalfinance,3dw14r,tccommentate,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:46:09 2015 UTC,First you'll need to work out the health insurance.  If your parents can still carry you on their policy (up to age 26) that may be your best solution.  Otherwise you need to find insurance on your own.  Consider building your emergency fund up a bit.  Consider increasing your IRA contributions. The limit is 5500 this year.  You can ONLY do a 401k with your employer.  So if you get a second job that offers 401k you could contribute but otherwise you just need to lobby your employer to add one.  Try to avoid adopting any expensive habits or renting more place than you need.

If you see how your family is living paycheck to paycheck, you'll see that you'll be following suit by blowing your first paycheck on something 'you deserve.'  Don't buy the phone.  Since this is your first job, let's get smart about what you're going to and what people think you should do:   Make a monthly budget TODAY. Figure out where your money is going to go and stick to it! Put at least 15% aside in a savings account. Put 15% aside in an emergency fund so if you blow your tires out tomorrow, you don't have to try to get some quick cash. DON'T get a credit card.

You should not be in control of the child's college fund, his parents should be. You would also most likely need his social insurance number to set up an account and no parent should give that out to anyone, including relatives.  It's great that you are excited about being an auntie, but honestly I think you're getting carried away. This isn't your child. You're overly emotional about someone else's pregnancy and think that you have some kind of right to set up this child's future. You don't. It's also a bit insulting to the parents that you think you can provide better for their child than they can.  Take care of yourself, take care of your own finances first. Sorry if you don't think that's the advice you need, but it is. Pay off your debt, set up your emergency fund, start investing for your retirement and get that on track. Then, if you have some extra money that you'd like to invest for your nephew, ask your brother and sister-in-law if they have set up a fund that you can contribute to."

This tax is in addition to your income tax liability for the year.  2015 Form 1040-ES is the form you use to compute your quarterly estimated tax liability, and you would include the appropriate voucher with a check if you choose to mail any estimated tax payments. There are plenty of electronic payment options available. You don't need to mail a paper voucher if you make an ES payment electronically.  Good luck. We're all counting on you."
personalfinance,3du992,these-things-happen,3,Sun Jul 19 17:11:41 2015 UTC,Thanks a bunch.  Looks like just about everything I'll need.  I appreciate it!
personalfinance,3du992,wijwijwij,3,Sun Jul 19 17:56:03 2015 UTC,"The 1040-ES booklet is what you should look at to determine if you owe estimated taxes during the year. For this year, there remain deadlines in mid-Sept and mid-Jan.  There are a few ways to avoid having to pay estimated taxes; see page 1 of 1040-ES.  To actually figure out the amount to pay, use the worksheets in 1040-ES. The very first line asks you to predict your 2015 AGI. Well, how the heck do you do that?  In my experience, the best way is to create a dummy Schedule C-EZ or Schedule C (gross – expenses = profit) to the best of your ability, even though you have not yet earned the money or paid out expenses.   Put your Schedule C-EZ result on a dummy Form 1040 line 12. Also, put your estimate of total W-2 wages for the year on 1040 line 7.  Next, create a dummy Schedule SE. The reason is because 1/2 SE tax is deductible on 1040 line 27. And that occurs before you can get your AGI. If your total W-2 and 1099 income will be under $118,500, the SE tax is easy to compute: SE tax = Sched C-EZ profit * 0.9235 * 0.153.  Put your Schedule SE result on the dummy 1040 line 57. And put 1/2 SE tax on line 27.  Next, complete all steps of Form 1040 page 1. That gives you your estimated AGI. That is what you'll use on line 1 of the 1040-ES worksheet.  The rest of that worksheet essentially figures out your tax liability for the upcoming year, and it also determines what the IRS considers to be your required annual amount to send in. This would likely be 100% of last year's total tax, or 90% of this year's tax, whichever is smaller.  Then, the worksheet asks you to subtract your prediction of what your total W-2 job withholding will be. In your case, OP, your W-2 withholding might be over as soon as you get your next check, so you could use your YTD value as your prediction of total withholding.  Once you subtract away total withholding, any remaining amount is what IRS expects you to send in during the year, not at end of the year (but only if it's greater than $1000). In your case, you'd send 75% of this remaining amount by mid-Sept (see payment voucher and address in 1040-ES booklet), and 25% by mid-Jan. (This is my paraphrase of the Amended Estimated Tax Worksheet 2-14 from Pub 505 chap 2, pp. 27-29. That worksheet is used if your first estimated tax payment is not mid-Apr one.)  This way, come April, you will likely owe only the remaining small amount. At tax time, you fill out your real Sched C-EZ with actual deductible expenses total, your real Sched SE, and your real Form 1040, on which lines 64 and 65 list your withholding and total estimated payments already made. Using these figures, you determine your actual total tax (income tax plus SE tax), and then see if you owe a little or you get a refund.   There is a penalty for not making estimated payments on time. See Form 2210. The penalty depends on how far short you are from the required payment amount (not from your total tax), and on when you made payments, if any. If you are assessed such a penalty, you can provide a more detailed Form 2210 using ""annualized income method"" to show the IRS info about when you actually earned your 1099 income. For example, you should not be penalized for not making the mid-Apr and mid-Jun estimated payment deadlines, because you didn't earn 1099 income until the third period. So if paying 75% in Sept and 25% in Jan still results in an underpayment penalty, see Form 2210 Schedule AI page.  The fact that for the first half of the year you had W-2 withholding helps you out, because already a considerable portion of your taxes due has already been sent in. So any underpayment penalty would likely be insignificant (or possibly just worth paying rather than filling out Form 2210 AI). The IRS specifically states you can let them compute underpayment penalty. I recommend you do, then only dispute it with a 2210 Sched AI if the savings are worth it.  Besides mocking up taxes and examining what sort of Estimated tax you might pay in Sept, you should definitely read the IRS publications about Business Expenses (see links provided by these-things-happen). You will want to keep good records to support your expenses you deduct. The details are not needed to fill out Schedule C-EZ, but look at the categories shown on Schedule C for ideas applicable to your situation. You will want to have detailed records organized in case you ever get audited.  This has been a roundabout way of saying you need to do more than just ""set aside"" money for taxes. You could take that approach, though, and just pay in April, if you are willing to also pay the underpayment penalty, or if you meet one of the exceptions to underpayment penalty.  In future years it can be a lot easier. You might just be sure to pay in 1/4 of previous year's total tax each period, and you're safe from penalty. That is, if your income is all 1099 next year."

All those factors may put you into the 200k range, plus interest compounds while you're in school as they took away sub loans for grad students.  I would aim for 150-175kk of total debt when finished.  It will make it manageable.  The current rate of interest is around 7% for grad plus loans, which is the type that most grad students take.  Chug in your expected total debt into the calculator here:  http://www.finaid.org/calculators/loanpayments.phtml    Estimate that you will take home around 70k after taxes.  Subtract the monthly payment from the calculator.  It will give you an idea of your living situation for the next 10-15 years depending on how quickly you want to pay it off.

A Roth IRA is just a container for stuff. That stuff can be anything from cash or CDs all the way up to stocks.  In other words, putting stuff into a Roth is investing in the sense you mean; or at least it can be.  So saying ""I have $$ in a Roth"" isn't very informative in terms of what you're actually doing with it. You probably want to have that in low-cost mutual funds within your Roth. And if you have your Roth IRA opened at a bank or something that doesn't offer that option, or only gives you high-cost mutual funds, it behooves you to transfer that account to some place that doesn't suck. :-) I think most people here will recommend Vanguard; that's what I use."

Step one is a written budget every month, then get out of debt, then build an emergency fund (in a local money market account), THEN invest 15% of your income towards retirement. That is usually done in mutual funds with the Roth IRA umbrella over it. If you have extra money after that, you can save for kids college (if that's an issue), or save for a house downpayment (if that's an issue), or save for the next car (car payments=bad), OR if all of that is not an issue do more investing in whatever you want (mutual funds, real estate, stocks, etc...)"

A credit union local to me doesn't want to deal with the regulatory burdens of real estate mortgages, but wants in the action of large-ish secured loans, so his bank does 'floating home loans' that are exempt from the standard battery of mortgage regulations.  Hard money loans are typically 10%+, traditional mortgages today are hovering around 4% -- he does like 6.5% last I checked. I have no idea how he deals with the security instruments floating away on him!  It's cool cuz it's a small enough CU that you can walk in and ask to talk to the president of the bank, and he'll just pop right on out of his office and come talk to you. Try doing that at B of A!  You probably aren't in the bay area, but if you're near a body of water then I'll guess some local CU near you is doing floating home loans."

personalfinance,3dusw8,2CatsAllDay,2,Sun Jul 19 19:27:00 2015 UTC,"I don't do boats, but love to learn... will a standard consumer loan have a loan level pricing adjustment if the security instrument is going to be a primary residence?   People walk away from recreational toys (eg, fishing boats) faster than they walk away from homes (eg, a boat to live on), so it kind of seems that this should be factored in as a risk factor in the good way."
personalfinance,3dusw8,aardy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:50:46 2015 UTC,"My credit union has a rate premium for any recreational vehicle such as a boat, motorcycle, camper, etc.  But we don't have any discount in place for a primary residence situation because we make them mutually exclusive.  In the case of a trailer, if you want a mortgage loan you need to have the unit off wheels and secured to the earth.  If not, you get an RV rate which would be higher.  You don't have that option with a houseboat(I don't think dry docking would count) so I don't see how that would work.  Even though it is a primary residence the risk for default and flight is there and probably higher since your literally sailing away with your house. Plus, boats are a bitch to repo."

personalfinance,3dvizs,Limit760,2,Sun Jul 19 21:47:23 2015 UTC,"There is a lot going on this question. Honestly everything depends. I'll try and stick to answering your questions directly.  Your top chance (like you point out) to get more salary is to start at a higher salary. Lots of companies just default to 4% annual raises or something very vanilla, if that is your company then you can (depending) always consider other options. Some warnings, people will notice on your resume if you have less than 1 year at a place. I am directly involved in interviewing positions etc. and we always ask a question designed to figure out why their tenure wasn't so long. Companies want people who are going to be invested.  You should likely not ask for a salary raise at your 6 month review. Either your company (like mine) will be cool/generous and just automatically give you some type of raise for being a good employee or they really only do that stuff annually. You do not have the tenure/clout to be negotiating at 6 months, you have no leverage. You are an entry level person and if you want to play hardball, or even hint that you aren't satisfied they will likely be rubbed the wrong way. If you truly are underpaid/undervalued then you need to do something about that in the form of a job search.  What you can do is ask for clarification on how performance reviews lead to salary reviews, or what the process the company goes through to consider salary bumps and ""what do I need to do to demonstrate value in the next 6 months"".  Your friend's 2 years of experience are what are garnering him a better salary. If I were you I would use that as your benchmark i.e. ""in 1.5 years I would like to be making $55k (or more) b/c that appears to be the market rate + I have a degree."" However, quickly your degree and their lack of degree are going to start to matter less and less. Also, is your friend at a different company, are your roles really comparable etc.?  TL;DR I would stick it out for at least 1 year to see how/if they give salary raises generously (at 6 months, at 1 year, and they are 'nice') or if they are duds. This will likely get past the 'red flag' of not being at a position for a full year before looking for a new job. Strap in for 8 months, evaluate after knowing all the facts. Good luck."

I know it looks bad to have some place on your resume that you worked at for less than a year. I want to stay where i'm working. I really enjoy it here :)  Oh, no of course i wouldn't ask for a raise after just 6 months. I'm using this as a sort of ""where do I stand"" review. I want to know what i'm doing right, and where I need to improve.  I will talk with my manager about how performance reviews lead to salary reviews and that whole process. Thanks!  From what I've been hearing the degree is only a way to get your foot in the door (ie. getting your first job) beyond that it's what you can do.    But yes, he is at a different company. And yes our roles are comparable. We have discussed at length our responsibilities and they are essentially the same. though his company does seem to be a bit bigger and younger as his market is currently thriving where mine is starting back up.

So for example, if you were in China January 2015 through May 2016,  then on your 2015 taxes, you would get the full 90k foreign earned income exemption (out of country 365/365).  For 2016, you can pro-rate it, by proving you were out of the country 330 days or more from May 2015 through May 2016.  This gives you january through may as eligible for the exemption, and allows you to have 5/12 * 90k exemption.   Of course I advise you get a proper tax accountant to assist you.

Hey everyone,    So I'm not one to ask for help which I know is a bad thing, because once I ask for help my situation usually seems pretty bleak. A great example is my situation right now.    I went to school and due to lack of finances and for my own mental health, I have decided to take a year off. That being said, I'm still paying for my tuition from last year. I don't have any credit because I've never had a loan in my name or a credit card. I also cannot receive the federal loans anymore because the deadline for the loan for the 2014-2015 aid year is over.     I had my financial situation figured out, but then it all became a mess. My mom quit her job and was unemployed for some time during the 2014 year. My mom and step-dad are also splitting up after 12 years of marriage.  My parents have numerous bills and very bad credit, obviously from the home foreclosure, so my mom thought telling the financial aid office at my school all of this would help. Well it did not. They basically told her that having the school do a refinancing process for my home life would mean more aid for me, instead my federal loans were taken away. The refinancing process required numerous documents, and they continued to ask for more and more documents. Because my situation was being refinanced my financial aid was taken away until the process was completed. By the time they finished it, it was too late to get my loans back. Now I owe my school $9,100 with it increasing each month, and I have no way of paying it back.    I have no credit, so getting a loan is obviously not going to be easy for me. My mom has such a low credit score that she wouldn't be able to cosign either, and I already know my step dad will not cosign a loan with me, but his credit is bad anyway. That leaves me with a debt I'm not sure how to pay back and will continue to increase each month.    Because it's so late in the year and the new school year is about to start I can't do a payment plan on my debt. Basically I have to pay it all at once in order to stop the late fees from accumulating.     The reason I wrote all of this is because I'm hoping that someone out there will be able to help me figure out an option to hopefully help me pay this off without accumulating more late fees. Also because I'm taking a year off I know my mom will have to start paying the $30,000 parent plus loan she took out my freshman year when our financial/family situation wasn't so bleak. If I am able to return in a year will she be able to defer it again, or will she have to continue to pay it off?    I hope someone will be able to read this and help out, and I thank you ahead of time for helping me.

Owning a home while paying debt is not easy as there's always the inevitable problems that arise.

You need to tell us what the estimated cost of the house is, not just the mortgage so we can estimate whether your parents will decide they're better off selling than renting - opportunity cost and all that. Zillow.com should give you a good estimate.   After that, I wouldn't spend more than 25% of your gross salary on rent or mortgage payment (less if you can). If you're planning on having roommates then that will help. I'm betting your parents will want to roll the taxes up into the cost of rent, so be forewarned.

You can't just move assets under an LLC. You and your friend are on the hook for the mortgage and the HOA fees.

Hopefully someone else can. If not definitely talk to HR to understand your options though they generally can't advise you on how to allocate for legal reasons.

You'll be paying interest on that $1k until you pay off the entire $7k.  Only do this if you:   Don't mind the balance transfer fee.

personalfinance,3dv19t,ElementPlanet,2,Sun Jul 19 19:32:51 2015 UTC,"Am I misunderstanding how the vested amount works?    It is possible that more was vested than you thought, but that would be impossible for us to determine without knowing the vesting schedule and your own employment time there.   Am I worrying for no reason?   No, you definitely want to check into it and make sure you have the correct amount, or else you will be stuck paying them back later.   I just received my rollover check   Did you receive an actual physical check or did it go directly to your new IRA?  If you received an actual physical check and then deposited that with Vanguard, realize that your old 401(k) administrator then withheld some of the money in your account for tax withholding purposes. If you do not deposit the sum total of the money within 60 days into the IRA as a rollover (and the sum total includes any money held back for withholding), then you will be taxed and fined on the amount not rolled over. Since you took a physical check, you would have to make up the difference out of your own pocket into your rollover IRA and you would get back the amount withheld by your old 401(k) administrator once you filed your tax return.  Because the usual amount of withholding is 20% and you had $24k in your account which means:  .8 * $24k = $19.2k  This tells me that if you took a physical check, then your old 401(k) administrator went with the assumption that all of the money in your account was vested and held back the 20% for withholding. You will want to get that sorted out right away if true."

What is important now is to come up with the cash that was withheld for your roll over. If you can contribute it from your savings that is OK, you'll get the withholding back on your tax return.

Each month you owe (22%/12months) in interest on whatever remains of the principal. Anything you pay beyond the interest goes toward reducing the principal. You will always pay interest. At first you pay almost all interest and at the end you pay almost all principal. Your loan was probably set up for 6 or 7 years, so after 2 years, you've made only a small dent in the principal.  You have two choices: 1. Refinance through a bank or credit union. You will put up the car as collateral, they will pay off your existing loan, then you will start a new loan term. The interest rate will be lower so more of your payment each month goes to principal or your monthly payment goes down. 2. Take a personal loan for $7k and then  sell the car. You use the money to pay off the original loan then sign over the car to the new owner. You still have to pay the $7k and you have no car, but you still save money because the interest is lower and you aren't paying for insurance and maintenance. Option 3 would be voluntary repossession. The dealer will auction the car and you will have to pay the difference.

personalfinance,3ds5gw,triallen,5,Sun Jul 19 00:47:59 2015 UTC,"Nonprofit is just a tax status for a business. Doesn't mean you can't make a profit, just means the profit has to go back towards the mission and not in shareholders' pockets.   You don't actually have to do anything at this point. You can incorporate in your state but donations, etc are not tax exempt until you file the Form 1023 with the IRS. If you go this route, hire an attorney or CPA to help you -an attorney I know charged about $2500. It costs like $800 to file, but if you mess up the paperwork it gets kicked back and you have to file again. This happens frequently - it's easier to just pay someone to do it right.   Regarding your sponsorship, someone can sponsor you now, but you cannot receipt them and they cannot write it off on their taxes - make sure they know that. That's really the only reason I see to incorporate as a nonprofit at this point."

Set up alerts or check your statements every now and then to make sure that no fraudulent purchases went through.  That way, you keep the lower utilization rate, and maintain your already good credit score.  Regarding putting every purchase on a credit card, do it (as long as there's no convenience fee for paying with credit). You get better protection, and earn free money at the same time as long as you pay your full statement balance every month.

If you use a credit card like a debit card and pay it off in full each month, it is definitely to your advantage.  One of the biggest things is if you lose your card or it is part of a data compromise (like Target and Home Depot last year) your actual money isn't apart of it.  Definitely safer.    Never cancel a credit card.  It does nothing to your advantage by canceling it.  If it has an annual fee, simply call in to the company and ask for it to be removed.  I can't tell you how many times I took a phone call for this very purpose.  Now we would look at your track record with the card and see if you used it.  If you don't, there might be a bit of a pushback but if you threaten them with canceling the card, they will transfer you to retention services which will pretty much do anything in their power to get you to stay.  Stay away from airline credit cards, there are always annual fees.  BoA's cards had the ability for a 10% bonus if you put your rewards into a BoA checking account.  Chase does not do this unfortunately as that's who I bank with.  I would check and see if your financial institution has that option.  Since you already have two cards from Capital One, I'd try to go in a different direction."

One of the better cash back cards out there.  Other options are the Amex Blue Cash ED/Preferred, which has tiered cash back for grocery and gas, and the Citi Double Cash 2% on everything.

I will often buy Amazon.com cards at the grocery store, but obviously there are dozens of stores to choose from. 3% at gas stations. 3% at major retail outlets (Macy's, JC Penny, Bloomingdale's, Boscov's, Kohl's, Lord & Taylor, Nordstrom, Sears, and many others).  1% on everything else.   Varying coupons (like spend $50 at JC Penny and get $10 back, spend $15 at Amazon get $15 back, $10 off a $10 purchase at walmart, $5 off a $5 purchase from itunes/app store, I have used all of these personally) that vary with time.  There are usually like 20-30 of these going on at one time that are good for 1-3 month periods. An extended 1 year warranty on top of manufactures warranty.  Extended 90 day return policy on all purchases. Other miscellaneous Bonuses.  Free rental car insurance.  Free 2 day shipping (and free return shipping) at 80+ online retail stores through ShopRunner ($80 per year normally).

There is an annual fee of $75 but you get $150 as soon as you spend $1,000 in the first 3 months).

I spend $1000/mo on daily expenses like gas, food, etc. If I use my CC I'm now getting back $10 per month (more actually, since I've got cards that offer 2% and 5% back) for money I was going to spend out of my account anyway.  I don't spend more, no no. I spend exactly what I was going to spend anyway, and If I want to make a large purchase I save up for it first, so I know I have the money to pay the CC off.  You're assuming everyone who uses a CC just spends money without thinking about if they can afford it. That's the trap you can fall into if  you don't properly budget your expenses.   If I know I've got $5000 in my bank account and I'm going to spend $3000 of it this month, I'm going to charge up $3000 and then pay if off in full because I know I have the money.  Spending cash hurts because I know I'm not getting any rewards for it. Spending from my debit card hurts because I know if someone dupes my card, they now have access to my bank account with my money in it.  If someone dupes my CC? I call my bank and ask that the fradulent charges be removed and they overnight me a new card, I'm NEVER out the money because it's all sitting nicely in my bank account.

Your emergency fund is there to carry you through the rough times so that you never have to carry a balance.  There are multiple cards that offer flat cashback >1%, and several others that have bonus categories that give 5% back. If you're getting cash back, it's meager earnings.

personalfinance,3du8xj,suprarz,6,Sun Jul 19 15:06:09 2015 UTC,"I know the answer to this.  There was a period of time when there were no good pesticides for eliminating termites. A pest control company would apply a treatment and then perform annual inspections to look for signs of infestation. A termite bond is a type of insurance that covers the damage done when termites get past the treatment. If you read the fine print, they have all sorts of exclusions, including that live termites must be present at the time of inspection. Then, they may or may not cover the cost of repairs. Mostly, it just means that they apply another treatment.  In the early 1990s a new class of pesticides became approved for termite treatments (neonicitinoids). You will recognize them as the pesticides implicated in colony collapse of honeybees. They are also the same pesticides often used in roach traps, fire ant bait and topical flea control for pets.  It was an exciting time for pest control companies, because they were actually able to kill entire colonies of termites, and the days of honoring termite bonds were virtually obsolete; because these pesticides are so powerful that they not only eliminate termites indefinitely, they also provide protection for neighboring homes. It quickly became disheartening, because most homes stopped having infestations and termite treatment sales hit the basement.  In France, they found that treating every other house on the street killed the termites in the untreated homes, as well. In the US, the neonicitinoids compromised the Department of Agriculture pesticide test site, because they inadvertently killed the termites that were being used in the testing of other chemicals too.  In other words: Have your home treated by a reputable company with Fipronil or Imidacloprid and throw the termite bond out the window. They are a waste of money.  Edit: And Holy Cow! $4,000? That's insane! That's way more than one good treatment should cost, which will be all that you need. Look for a sticker on your water heater or electrical panel. If the house is newer, it was treated before being built. If you find a sticker, call the company and ask them if they treated and if they used a neonicitinoid. If so, you are good to go."

personalfinance,3du8xj,JonnyHall,5,Sun Jul 19 15:12:53 2015 UTC,"I second the idea that  Fipronil or Imidacloprid is the way to go. But you have to be careful -- a lot of pesticide companies dilute the stuff or just spray water. Often the don't trench properly either.  There are ton of videos out there on how to do it. You just need a bucket and shovel and about 1-2 hours. I'd do it myself so I have the peace knowing it was done right.   Warranties don't kill termites, a soil drench with Fipronil or Imidacloprid WILL."
personalfinance,3du8xj,whatsreallygoingon,3,Sun Jul 19 16:50:06 2015 UTC,"Absolutely! That's why I say to go with a reputable pest control company. They were trenching when I left the business, but I'd heard that they'd since discovered that drenching was just as effective? It's been quite a few years, so I'm a little out of the loop.   If you do hire a pest control company, just ask to watch them mix it. They can get into a lot of trouble for watering down a treatment, so just observing should keep them honest.  A bottle of Imidicloprid is only around $70, where I live. I also recommend treating your own house; but only if you follow the instructions to the letter."

You can use a spreadsheet, paper and pen, an app or a software program, doesn't matter. Once you've figured out where all your money is currently going, you can start making changes to divert wasteful spending into paying down your debt and building your emergency savings. Knowing what you're currently spending helps you to form a realistic budget where you can make gradual changes that you'll be able to live with.  As far as paying down your debt specifically, is it one debt or several? What are the balances? What interest rates are you paying? Some people use the avalanche method of focusing on the highest interest debt first while making minimum payments on the rest to pay the least amount of overall interest. Others use the snowball method of focusing on the smallest balance debt first so they can start eliminating payments and get a mental boost to help them along. Either way will work, just decide on which sounds best to you."

That being said, if the debts are 10+ years old and no one is currently contacting you about them, you may not be able to locate them. And if you're past the statue of limitations on collections in your state, you may be better off just leaving them alone and start handling your current finances properly.

If you make a concerted effort at improving your credit after bankruptcy you will be FAR better off than trying to chip away at it for years on your own. The bankruptcy is still the only neg on my credit report, and the older it gets the less it impacts my score. Yes, there are some cards I would not be able to get with it on there, but I have plenty of cards with low interest rates and high credit limits with no annual fees now. Lots of creditors don't care. I started out applying for lots of store cards; Amazon, Target, Penney's. I used them any time I shopped those places and paid them off promptly. Pretty soon I started getting credit card offers that weren't total crap and was approved for most of them.   Filing for bankruptcy isn't a personal failing. It's a strategic financial move. Your creditors will never hesitate to use the existing laws to their financial advantage. They would sue you for the money in a hot second if you quit paying. Why should you be held to a higher standard? Bankruptcy laws exist for a reason. They don't care if your family eats, has a place to live, has an emergency fund. You have no reason to feel any sort of obligation towards them if it's just going to make things harder for you in the long run. Do what is in your best interest."
personalfinance,3duts4,seattlemama,2,Sun Jul 19 21:06:58 2015 UTC,"I would declare bankruptcy as soon as possible. It'll take a while for it to happen. Also, get a lawyer to aid you in this crusade. Your credit score is definetely screwed so declaring bankruptcy now will help you be able to rebuild your credit in 5-10 years. I had to go through this with my uncle and it took a while but we are much better off than we were before we declared bankruptcy and were sending the CC companies 400 a month each for bills. We just couldn't do it. The interest on credit cards is crazy high and they make it so you are unable to actually make any head way on it. So, do this for you and your family as soon as possible. You won't be able to make ends meet unless you follow through with it. This is just my humble advice though. I have been through it all. I live in Michigan btw so it could be a lil different."
personalfinance,3duts4,sweffcastles,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:33:48 2015 UTC,"Bankruptcy stays on your credit report for 10 years, not 7.  But it depends on your situation. Have you address the issues that caused the credit card debt?  It also depends if you qualify for chapter 7, which sounds like what you're talking about. Otherwise you could file for chapter 13 which doesn't wipe all the debt. In chapter 7 I think you can usually keep your home as long as you're not behind on payments. I think you can keep your car if there's no loan if it's under a certain value. If there is a loan then you can agree to continuing paying the loan."
personalfinance,3duts4,whiteraven4,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:27:54 2015 UTC,"So...If we choose to try to pay it off if we get it paid off in 5 years our credit score will still be very low since it will take years to get it back up correct? And it will show on our report for how many years to come? Like 6 or 7 years from when we paid off the debt?   If we declare bankruptcy, in 6 or so years of building savings and not having any more negative marks on the report would it be possible to get a car loan or anything like that? Or will it be almost impossible to get a loan until it is off the record at 10 years?   If we do chapter 13 is there a typical percentage you end up paying or is each case different?   We currently have no car loans, just a mortgage and credit card debt.  We have never been late paying our mortgage either.  And car value is probably between $8-9k What caused the debt is mainly over spending when we first got married and already starting with about $15k probably off debt."
personalfinance,3duts4,RagnarKon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:35:58 2015 UTC,"Bankruptcy typically appears on your credit report for about a decade.  So... your credit will significantly be hindered for ~10 years.  If you pay off your credit card debt in 5 years... then you credit will only significantly be hindered for 3-4 years.  Anyway, Tennessee has no automobile bankruptcy exemptions, so there is no obvious way to save your car (an attorney would know more).   Tennessee's homestead exemption is $7500, so you should be able to save your house.    As long as your debts are going down each month... then I would avoid bankruptcy.  But if your debts continue to increase, then bankruptcy might be the best option.  If you do file for bankruptcy, my gut feeling is that Chapter 13 bankruptcy might be better than Chapter 7 in your case.  But either way, I would talk to a bankruptcy attorney."
personalfinance,3duts4,RagnarKon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:36:20 2015 UTC,Homestead exemption is $7500? We have approx $10k equity in our house so does that mean we may not be able to save our house?
personalfinance,3duts4,jck73,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:55:09 2015 UTC,"If you have $10k equity then yes, the creditors may take your home to pay your debts.  But it depends on the value of your home and remaining balance of your mortgage.  Whether they actually do take your home or not depends on your particular case.  That is something that would have to be worked out by a attorney.    If the only debt you are struggling with is credit card debt, then I would avoid declaring bankruptcy.  If you are behind on your mortgage or other loans, then maybe bankruptcy is worth looking at.  5 years of time isn't a massive amount of time to pay off debt for someone who has a lot of credit card debt. Just freeze your credit cards and pay off the debt.  I imagine you'll need a new car between now and 10 years from now.  If you have a bankruptcy on your record, your ability to get a loan that isn't completely garbage will be severely hindered.  What if you need to take out a loan to pay off health expenses?  Won't be able to find a good one with a bankruptcy.  Meanwhile if you slowly pay off your credit card debt, your score will continually improve.  Each month your credit card balances go down, the more and more your credit score improves."

But clearly not something we did ourselves (black car with red paint and scraped up from side to side). I immediately called my car insurance agent and she said we could get it repaired as an uninsured motorist claim. Our normal deductible is $1k but in our state it is only $250 for uninsured motorist claim. We had to call local police department to write up a report, got an estimate from a shop, and our insurance issued a check within the week. It sucks to pay $250 to fix, but the repair ended up costing $800 total plus we had a rental car for 3 days. If we had done the damage ourselves we probably would have just lived with it. But it's a fairly new car that had the rear end redone after an accident last year and we wanted it to still look good. Call your insurance agent and find out your options. Good luck!"

I don't have a good idea as to how good they are to work with. You can also call your insurance company and work through them. They will charge you the deductible but will attempt to recover the money from zip cars insurance carrier and if they get it from them should refund you.

In California for instance, it's unlikely that you will be able to. In Texas, np you can. If you took pictures at the scene that shows your damage, and your position relative to the other vehicle and their damage you may be able to get the other cars insurance to pay fir the claim. I would wait before calling your own insurance company, some companies will create a claim even if you ask them not to and then you end end up with that showing up in your claim history (even if you do nothing). Instead call and ask if you have uninsured motorist protection or check online if possible, then try to look up info online if your state will allow you to use the coverage and if the deductible is lower than a regular comp/collision claim.

You said that you can't pay back the money because your account was banned from logging on. You just seem lazy/ entitled to me. All you had to do was call customer service and it would have been sorted out within minutes, but you decided to just not pay off your debt because it would have been going out of your way for something you caused in the first place. In regards to interest, if this was PayPal credit aka billmelater then there will be interest. And yes, this late payment/ being sent to collections will negatively impact your credit score / application. You also mentioned that you have no way to pay off the debt for PayPal, how exactly will you pay off the debt for your credit card?

It is US oriented, but will give you an idea that you can adapt for your situation.  FWIW, if you don't anticipate using it relatively soon a pre-paid funeral plan is usually not worth it. You can end up in a weird situation where, for example, you pick out a simple and economical casket that becomes a rare, special order item by the time the funeral happens years later and the funeral home locks your pre-payment in against that particular model. What's often more important and helpful to your survivors is just to have your wishes documented and leave them to get a funeral director to handle the details."
personalfinance,3du3n7,ejly,3,Sun Jul 19 15:19:32 2015 UTC,"When I took care of my will and all my other ""what if I get hit by a bus tomorrow"" financial planning, I included a document related to my funeral wishes. I didn't set aside money specifically for a funeral or make any financial commitments. What I did was put together a 1-page document for my sister (who is also my health care proxy and has durable power of attorney for me). It basically just describes my wishes but also gives her permission to make changes if she sees fit (cause I'll be dead and I don't really feel all that strongly about what happens after I'm gone). The only real reason I did it was to make things easier for her and others I will leave behind. I've had to plan funerals and make medical decisions for other family members and knowing that you are doing what they would want makes things so much easier.  My document basically just covers things like which church I'd like the service to be held at, the fact that I'd prefer to be cremated, and that if they want to put me in a box for a wake that it should be a very inexpensive box. I mentioned a couple of songs I like and a couple of readings. That's it.   Because I'm single, I also made sure she knows where all of my funds are, knows any necessary passwords, etc. We basically sat down together and went through all of the information she would need to know if I got hit by a bus crossing the street tomorrow.  I think if you cover all that stuff, you're doing the best you can for those you will leave behind and don't need to worry about specific financial arrangements."

You would have more options that way (i.e. buying vs renting).  My area is similar to yours with high rent so I built up enough to just buy a place instead and with the mortgage payments its about the same as renting.

personalfinance,3duiew,pho1701,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:40:35 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're making reasonable choices. I don't see any reason why you won't be able to maintain your current rate of increase and be well into the 700s by the time you're mortgage shopping in two years. You probably wont be ready in just one year. However, the FICO score is a black box and there is no way to know.  Depending on the interest rates of the credit union loan and the student loan it may not be necessary to pay these off aggressively especially if it impacts your quality of life.  Be careful of your credit card utilization, if you basically max your card every month in order to get cash back or miles, even if you pay the balance off, your future mortgage lender may not like that. This caused a friend of mine a problem last year on a mortgage application. Your current credit scores will probably prevent you from opening more credit cards or increasing your credit line. You could do some partial payments on your credit card more often so that the full balance does not post each month. However, just paying some of your bills directly from your checking account is a good option too.  It is good you're tracking your scores, but you should check your scores from multiple sources, and see the actual credit reports. There may be some negative marks you're not currently aware of."

Otherwise it depends on your personality.  If you can hunker down do it the smart way of paying off the highest interest first and minimum on the rest.  Or, if you're like most people and need encouragement to keep the ball rolling do the snow ball method and pay off the debts from smallest to largest (again paying the minimum on everything at least).  Debt consolidators are a scam imo.  They get something out of it and it's your money they just make it seem easier.  Call the people you have the debt with directly and try to work out a deal with them.  Unless you mean getting a loan with a lower interest rate than the debts you have or getting a new card (which I doubt will be approved at this point and time) with 0% balance transfers."

During these classes, 1 copy of YNAB is given away for free each time (and there are maybe 10-20 people per class - pretty good chance of getting a copy free!).  YNAB is also free for students.    As for comparing it to Mint - YNAB is far superior as a budgeting tool since it forces you to be aware of where every dollar is going before you spend it!  Mint simply tells you where your money went after the fact, and you aren't able to go back and hit ""undo"".  Part of the philosophy of YNAB is that by entering the transactions manually, you become a lot more aware of where you are spending your money, and start to question whether each transaction is actually a necessary one.  You check the category the purchase will go into and see if you have sufficient funds for that item.  Perhaps you see that your budget for Starbucks is low, and decide that you don't need that frappachino after all.  Mint simply says ""Hey! You blew $250 on Starbucks last month!"""

They won't accept it at first, so just say ""Okay, I owe some money to some other people too, I am sure someone will settle something with me, I'll call you back when I have more.""  Pay off all your debts from smallest balance to largest. Work your way up. No more debt, ever, for anything (except a reasonable mortgage, but that is years down the road at this point).   Work your butt off. Sales is one of the best ways to start bringing in a lot of money. You could get this all paid off a lot sooner than you think if you work it.

I have attempted to automatically reformat your text with fixed line breaks.     Hey guys,    I'm a 23 year old fresh college grad. In college, I made a lot of mistakes and learned from them but now I'm lying in the debt bed I made. I decided to grab the bull by the horns and check my credit score and learned I have a credit score of 385. I've never maintained financial responsibility until now. I have a big girl job and work on a decent livable salary. I work in sales so my base salary (the salary guaranteed without commission) is 2000/mo. Taking control of my finances and being responsible with money is a foreign concept to me so when I started making money, I created a Mint account and set up a budget:    100 - phone 100 - groceries (Food pantries surprisingly give away a substantial amount of food for free) 200 - car (will be paid off by march 2016) 120 - gas 200 - debt 190 - car insurance  Now, I have other ""misc"" expenses (Netflix, entertainment etc) but the above budget is the bare bones minimum/what I'd need to survive. I'm opening a secured credit card with a $500 limit today with my bank hoping this will be the start of Operation Fix Credit. The problem with the debt I have is that I have so many small accounts that went to collections. Owed my old internet provider $400, owed a bank 1000, credit card debt of 900 etc. And those are in addition to private student loans (I handles my federal student loans with a student debt consolidation agency so based on my income, I don't pay anything for now) and an eviction that I'm still paying for. My question is, what other courses of action should I be taking to kick start Operation Fix Credit besides opening a secured credit card? I want to consolidate all this debt and was also wondering if it'd be worth it to see a debt consolidator. This is my first time being financially responsible and actually accounting for every penny I spend. I know credit takes years to fix but as I learn more about how credit works, I would like some advice on how to fix mine and also maintain my budget. Any advice/help is appreciated!       I am a bot.

Pay other discretionary income toward your credit cards. What is your auto loan rate?

You can always roll it in your future 401k if you have one and it has good funds or just roll it into an IRA. Yea the fees are very high, but since it'll only be for the short term I suggest using the tax advantage space."
personalfinance,3du8zq,pho1701,3,Sun Jul 19 15:21:40 2015 UTC,"1- You probably wont have this job forever, so you will have an opportunity to roll your current 401k over to a new 401k plan or to an IRA. Bad 401ks can become great IRAs without a tax implication. You'd also get a chance to consider a Roth conversion at some point which may be favorable.  2- I don't know where you work, but does everyone share their pay stubs at lunch time? Its no ones business how you manage your money. The tax implication of making greater Traditional 401k contributions is that you'll pay less taxes today and you'll have more retirement money.  3- Modern brokerage accounts are not going to charge you simply for moving money from a money market into a IRA. You may have to pay a transaction fee to sell or buy stocks/funds, but that will be $7-$10 (but is sometimes free).   4- You're 23, if you're not making plans to buy a house now you are probably not going to buy a house for awhile.

personalfinance,3du8zq,pho1701,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:20:30 2015 UTC,"Okay. So maxing out the 401k is the way to go.

personalfinance,3du8zq,pho1701,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:34:07 2015 UTC,"It sounds like the plan is here for you to contribute A LOT from your pay check to your 401k, maybe so much so that you'll be using some of your windfall for your every day expenses. I think this is an interesting strategy that absolutely has some value. But if this is the case you should probably just put some of this windfall money in your checking account.   Depending on your filing status, income, deductions and credits, if you are making huge Traditional 401k contributions you may find that you're not going to pay any Federal taxes, or at the very least are now in a very low tax bracket. In that case a mix of Roth 401k and Traditional 401k contributions may be better (your employer may or may not offer Roth 401k, and some plans will let you do contributions of both types).  Be sure you're aware of any tax implications of this money. Its unclear from your post where the money is from. Not necessarily reddit's business where its from, but $115k that has to be taxed is a lot less money than $115k that does not have to be taxed.  As for money that doesn't need to be used for living expenses, isn't needed to pay down debt, can't be put in a tax protected account, isn't needed to pay taxes and that you do not need for a house purchase in the near future, just do a normal brokerage account. If you keep something for more than a year you can sell it without high short term capital gain taxes, and given the fact you're going to be potentially getting large tax deductions because of your 401k contributions,  you may not be in a tax bracket that actually owes tax on long term capital gains.  Basically you're in a pretty good situation."

I wasn't planning to do the 100% paycheck contributions, but apparently it's the only option and there's no real downsides.

Give your money more time to grow and use the GI Bill for bachelors. If you do well in school you can get merit based scholarships for your post grad. It is also easier to get larger/better interest rate loans for graduate school, and you'll have had more time to build your credit history for that. There is also some chance you'll be unable to / choose not to attend graduate school, in which case you'll have lost the GI Bill money which you earned by being in the military."

My biggest concern is racking up a lot of debt from post grad work but you're saying with good interest loans and scholarships I could manage it. Ill have to look into that thanks.

So unless you're considering a PhD or medical school, which I doubt you are, I think you could complete these degrees in that 5 year time table.   As for the cash, 3 years * 12 months * $600 = $21,600 which is a meaningful amount of money, but you're planning to spend it pretty soon.

Make sure you've got a high interest savings account (Ally, Barclay, CapitalOne360, etc., anything around 1% or so), and not Bank of America or USAA where they're paying you 0.01% or garbage like that. It still doesn't keep up with inflation, but at least it's not nothing.  I wouldn't put it in the stock market, 3 years is just too short. We could have three great years of bull market, or 3 years of bear and you wind up with less than you started.

Basically your service should have some form on tuition assistance. I say this because it is IMPARITVE that you knock out as many classes as possible NOW to complete an associate’s degree or a bachelor’s degree. I spent six and a half years in the US Navy and accomplished both of these degrees in about a four year time frame. I did have some prior navy college credits and I did take out a 1400 dollar student loan and I used about 4 months of my MGIB to cover the cost of full time course work. Did I sacrifice a lot of free time? You bet, but it was totally worth it. The more you can complete while you are in the service the more of the 9/11 GI bill you can use after the service on finishing up  the degree you are working on and follow on course work. If you can do all of this you may not have to you ANY of your savings for a degree after the military and you can use that money to ease the transition from active duty to civilian life."

personalfinance,3du86z,pho1701,2,Sun Jul 19 15:51:11 2015 UTC,"Good your doing the right things. Just remember you may have to be flexible on your degree options. It is all going to depend on what your commands allow you by way of work schedule, what is available locally in your area and the type of degrees you wish to pursue. You may have to change plans or you may have to delay plans depending on what you want and how fast or slow you may have to do them."

personalfinance,3du86z,lazydictionary,2,Sun Jul 19 17:02:08 2015 UTC,"I'd say use the GI Bill for undergrad first, like /u/pho1701 says, and let your own money have time to grow.  A 529 plan would work for you, but check that you are getting an investment account not a prepaid plan. Pre-paid plans can be good, but lock you in to a particular state. Military folk move a lot, and 3 years (from a military perspective) is a long time - so don't lock yourself in.  More info: http://www.irs.gov/uac/529-Plans:-Questions-and-Answers  So once you get a 529 plan, invest in lower risk, diversified options since you have (from an investor's perspective) a relatively short time horizon. Often there are time- based portfolios such as Vanguard's and Fidelity's.   As with any investment, low-cost options are preferred over higher cost options, so keep your eye open for sneaky fees and high expense rates.   Another thing to consider - not education related - is whether you are saving for retirement. A Roth IRA can be a good vehicle for that, you may want to consider splitting some of your educational savings off to that purpose. You can get student loans later, but not retirement loans.  Good luck!"

personalfinance,3dthzd,Carnnagex,21,Sun Jul 19 08:25:59 2015 UTC,"Family doc here.  Just thought I throw in a few recommendations:   Talk with the billing department at the hospital.  They will most likely work with you in reducing the payments.  They can also offer very low payment options (like pay $100 per month, etc..). Do you have health insurance?  If not, look into medicaid.   Sorry about your issues.  Your situation seems very unusual if your medical issues stem from true cardiovascular disease.  I am not sure why you would need to go the ER on a daily basis as chronic heart issues should be managed by either your family doctor or a cardiologist.  ER's are for heart attacks and other life threatening emergencies.  To put it into prospective, I have seen thousands of patients over the years and never had one that was going to the ER daily for any substantial length of time.  ER's are very expensive places to deal with chronic issues.  And most of the time, the ER is not the place to actually ""fix"" chronic issues but rather to stabilize the patient so that such problems can be addressed by a primary care doctor in the outpatient setting.  You obviously did not give us a lot of medical information but considering your age, multiple workups in the ER, etc... I am guessing perhaps your primary issue is psychiatric in nature.  I have many patients who had severe anxiety and ""heart symptoms"".  This is very common, and usually in young people where intrinsic heart disease is very rare.  If this is the case, I would seek out a good mental health care provider.  If you do not know any, you should see your primary care doctor and they can help with treatment and possible referrals.  Take care, and best wishes."
personalfinance,3dthzd,invenio78,11,Sun Jul 19 11:41:46 2015 UTC,"It sounds like panic attacks to me, although it's impossible to tell over the internet.

personalfinance,3dthzd,batardo,4,Sun Jul 19 12:43:58 2015 UTC,"I rarely see the ER make a direct referral to a psychiatrist (unless somebody requires inpatient psychiatric care).

All of which diagnose me anywhere from somatization disorder (Which is no longer a disorder in the DSM) to panic disorder to delusions of health problems... I've had 2-3 cardiac work-ups (Outside of the ER) all of which say my heart is completely healthy... yet it skips and beats so badly it interrupts anything that I do in my life. I'm not overweight, but I can no longer exercise without my heart going crazy... I've had 100's of X-rays, a chest CT scan, EKG's, Echocardiogram (twice), holter monitors, Hearth catheterization (Was clean) MRI of the brain, EEG (Twice), head CT scans (8 of them), and blood tests... yes it's absurd, but I genuinely feel like something is being missed, and (To me) does not feel like a mental disorder (Yes I know most mental disorders the patient is unaware of having it, which makes it so debilitating)  As of right now, no major psychological disorder... just extreme panic disorder, from which I've had to switch many doctors because they would not prescribe me anxiety medicine at such a young age.  The reason I stated my medical status in the first place, was that in hopes it could help me in my debt situation (Maybe there is help for people with a problems like this) thank you for the follow up.  EDIT: I do have Anthem blue cross blue shield medicaid NOW, I didn't at the beginning of all this... I think the majority of the debt has gone to collectors, as it has been awhile...

personalfinance,3dthzd,invenio78,9,Sun Jul 19 12:54:25 2015 UTC,"Again, I am very sorry to hear about the difficulties you have been having.  It seems like you have anxiety/panic disorder.  Your are 21 and no doctor should have problems prescribing medications for anxiety for you.  I would also caution you about getting more and more tests especially when you have the same test multiple times and they are normal.  You mention x-ray's and CT scans.  That worries me as those tests are actually harmful.  You substantially increase your risk of developing cancer from the increased radiation exposure.  Furthermore, the younger you are when you get these tests, the increased risk of developing cancer later on in life.  Have you seen a psychiatrist?  If not, I would recommend you find one.  If you do not know where to look, I would suggest either calling your insurance company up (they can give you a list of providers in their network) or go see your PCP and ask for a referral to a psychiatrist.  I'm not really sure about why your previous doctors did not want to give you medications for your anxiety issues in the past.  Regardless, at 21 there should be no concerns about treating you with a number of available and safe medications.  You really need to treat this aggressively.  Not only is it ruining your day to day life, but has now gotten to the point where you are a 1/4 million dollars in debt at age 21 because you are having panic attacks.  Don't endanger your mental and financial well being for a medical disorder that can be treated with medication that for most people cost $25 a month."

You are having panic attacks so bad that you end up in the ER everyday and the only think you are on is a 2nd choice medication which is obviously not controlling your symptoms.  I would probably have a very frank conversation with your provider about more intensive treatment.  I would also focus on coping strategies so you don't keep going back to the ER for the same non-life-threatening symptoms that you have had 100 times before.  You will never get out of debt or be financially stable with spending $2,000 a day on ER visits."

They are used to insurance just paying for it rather than the individual.  If the individual is paying for it they will usually compromise and work out a reduced payment, especially if they feel that is the only way they will get any money from you.  For example, one medical bill that started out at $2400 I ended up paying off for $100 without using a mediator or 3rd party.

SO if you are going to invest a monthly payment, invest in something likely to go up in value (your house). Investing a monthly payment in a car (while ""normal"") is financially unwise. You will be better off buying a car you can afford with cash, and in your monthly budget going forward invest a car payment in a mutual fund. Now you will be investing monthly in two areas that are likely to grow (your house and your car fund). Good luck."
personalfinance,3du3hi,Romarion,2,Sun Jul 19 15:26:57 2015 UTC,"OP is already going to invest in both. Therefore, it doesn't matter whether the value is increasing or decreasing. All that matters is the relative interest rates.   Put more cash towards the item that you're going to have to pay a higher interest rate towards. Many dealerships will offer 0% financing. If you can get this, you should put down as little as possible, and use that cash to increase your down payment on your house, which will likely have a much higher interest rate."

If you would prefer to allow your monthly cash flow to work for you rather than for your creditor, than debt on appreciating assets is mathematically wiser than debt on depreciating assets. (From a real life example when I teach this) Buy a $25,000 car on a 5 year 0% interest rate loan; 4 years later you have systematically invested $20,000; your asset is worth $17,000 (KBB private sale), and you owe $5,000 still.

If you're going to be a new homeowner you're going to have unplanned expenses. Putting more than 20% down on a house could come back to bite you if you have too much equity tied up in your house. You can always make extra payments on your mortgage at a later date to build equity and reduce the total amount of interest you pay over the life of your mortgage.   I'd pay for the car in cash because I think it's generally a bad idea to finance depreciating assets.  I'm going through the mortgage process now and car debt really hurts how much you can get approved for your mortgage."
personalfinance,3du3hi,Scipio_Africanes,0,Sun Jul 19 16:32:41 2015 UTC,"Having a car payment will really effect how much house you can afford/get a loan for.  The long term gain of not having a car payment will get you into more house now, or if you don't need more house, a more comfortable living arrangement and potentially allow you to make up the difference on the mortgage on the back end by applying what you would have paid in car payments to the mortgage.  That being said, yes, avoid PMI... 20% down is the norm, but there are programs at virtually every lender that is less than 20% down, but doesn't have PMI... just shop around a bit.  Also, don't do anything until you have talked with a few mortgage reps.  Coming from another country, there will be extra hiccups about your employment history, especially if you are switching occupations and having more of a down payment just might be something that helps you get past that hurdle."
personalfinance,3du3hi,Gashcat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:25:17 2015 UTC,That's incorrect. Between FHA and conventional mortgages you will pay PMI if you have less than 20% equity. FHA pmi stays with the life of the loan.

Money she has that is garnishable (e.g. savings from when she or her husband were working) they can go after so be careful with that.

Then, at whatever time is appropriate, you may convert some or all of it to Roth IRA, paying taxes at whatever rate applies in the year you make the conversion.  For example, next year, if you are in school and you have a lower annual income than this year, it could be much less costly tax wise to do a Roth conversion then instead of now."

personalfinance,3du0tx,ttengi,2,Sun Jul 19 13:52:10 2015 UTC,"It isn't always wrong to keep a 401k, you can loan the money to yourself which is sometimes a good move. I also think that 401k money is more 'protected' from lawsuits against you than IRAs. Similarly, a lot of 401k plans do have low cost options and are available from good providers, and its not necessarily a big help to change.  As for the OP's question. Without knowing your income for 2015, 2016 and 2017 (or how ever long the program is) and the size of these conversions its not possible to give you specific advice on the amount of tax you'll owe and if it is worth doing. However, I would generally suggest that years when you go to school you can get tax credits or deductions for tuition, and you'll be in a much lower tax bracket than years when you work full time all 12 months. Chances are you'll be better off doing this conversion, if even you feel like the tax bill stings. You may also not owe any taxes depending on your specific combination of income and deductions/credits."
personalfinance,3du0tx,pho1701,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:58:10 2015 UTC,"for 2015, my employment income would be around $40k. I have about 60k in my 401k (pre-tax). So assuming, I convert all of them, that would put to me on the 100k income bracket (are my assumptions correct?).  for 2016, assuming i get an internship, I may potentially get $20k income. so that would be 20k + 60k (for 401k) = 80k income for 2016  also, the school i will be attending is in a state with higher income taxes. I am planning on changing my residence to to the higher income tax to take advantage of reduced tuition for 2016.   current state income tax ~ 3%  school's state income tax ~tiered but if my calculation is correct 20k internship money + 401k puts me in the 9% bracket  hope that helps."

Talk to the financial aid people at your school. I hope your attendance does not depend on this. (No judgements on whether this is ethical or not, and I do not know the laws)  So your taxes aren't as simple as $40,000 W2 Income + $60,000 401k Conversion = $100,000 taxable dollars. You haven't considered the personal exemption, the standard deduction (or better if you're married or have dependents). Lots of tax breaks from student loans, from paying tuition.   Is all of the 401k in a single account? Do you have to covert all of it at once?   Maybe tax year 2015 wont be great for a conversion, but I think tax year 2016 may be great opportunity for you.  I recommend you run some theoretical tax returns in Turbo Tax or another similar software (using the 2014 version wont be tremendously different than the 2015 or 2016 versions)  There are a lot of ways to cut your Federal taxes.

You have to do something on the side. PERIOD. Whether it's delivering pizzas or waiting tables, you HAVE to have more $ coming in.  I'd focus on the smallest balance first and pay the loan of $2,200 off as quickly as possible, freeing up an extra $50 a month. As soon as that sucker is away, attack the $3,366 loan and apply the newly freed up $50 a month to it... and send them $100 a month, MINIMUM.  Just keep snowballing each and ever debt.

First of all, don't listen to anything anyone says who is not a bankruptcy attorney.  There are very precise and not always intuitive steps your father will likely want to take.  Speak to more than one bankruptcy attorney.  Only speak to bankruptcy attorneys who offer a free initial consultation.    For an example of a counterintuitive possibility, it's conceivable that after all the analysis is done, someone with a $125k house who is about to retire on social security alone will be best off financially simply defaulting on a lot of credit card debts rather than either filling bankruptcy or continuing to service the debt, as the value of a home at that level and the very low income will often both be exempt from collections enforcement actions (and also in bankruptcy).  Only a good bankruptcy attorney can help you figure out how to preserve the greatest amount of assets and income going forward.  Finally, make sure that your father's bankruptcy attorney is committed to maximizing your parents' assets and income, not to doing so in the context of filing bankruptcy.  In order to do this it may make sense for you to pay for consultations, as many bankruptcy attorneys know only about the law once you have decided to file bankruptcy and are not experts in managing debt without filing bankruptcy.  You don't want someone who only makes money if you for advising you on whether to file.  That's a service worth paying for in itself."

Banks will show you no loyalty, and no mercy; neither should you show them any. It is not shameful to default on a loan from a bank.  This doesn't hold for loans from friends or relatives. There's a social contract there that isn't present with a bank. Always, always repay your debts to friends and relatives."

The flip side being, of course, that the bank would help out people going through a rough patch even if they didn't fit a specific 82 point list of criteria. Because the bank knew who was going to do everything to try to pay it back.  Does that make the old way better? I don't know. It had its own problems.

I took a signature loan for an accreditation course that cost $10K. Bank agreed to interest rate of 10% (high I know but the only way I could do it) with an understanding that the rate would be adjusted down after one year of on-time payments which I did. I happened to check my statement 14 months later and noticed that the rate had been adjusted not down but up to 21%. No separate notice given - only the listing on the statement which I overlooked. I called the bank and received the ""Sorry. You had a 30 day window to dispute"" which I had already passed. I escalated and had a manager review which she refused to change the rate back (even down to the original 10%) and then condisendingly suggested I should talk to a debt consolidation/credit counseling service. I was able to transfer to the balance to a credit card at 6% and just paid it off.   I know anecdote != evidence but I've talked to other people who have gone through similar experiences. Banks are businesses and are inherently amoral. If they can figure out a way to legally (not ethically) make more money on customers they will - which includes causing a debt cycle spiral that their customer can't break out of.

These same banks then had to be bailed out by our governments as they didn't have enough reserves to cover their own debt.  We also have an entire country in Greece which is in serious trouble due to a bank advising it to illegally hide its debts.  Then there is the fact that many banks are currently in court for intentionally money laundering for criminal cartels.

This is not a value judgement, it's a matter of fact about of a for profit firm operating in a capitalist economy.  You should play the game with the same attitude.   The costs of default are already built into the interest. When you take out a loan, both you and the bank understand that the borrower can default on the loan (and face the consequences of bankruptcy). You are already paying, and have paid on every loan in your life, for the costs of a potential default. Otherwise there would be no loans (unless bankruptcy is say replaced with a default borrower becoming enslaved to the bank)."

personalfinance,3doj8z,2weiX,12,Sat Jul 18 10:33:40 2015 UTC,"This is ridiculous.  For the vast majority of people here, they went to the bank asking the bank for a loan, and the bank provided it to them, with terms that they pay interest on the loan.  It's not like these banks are going around making people default on loans.  We're not talking about subprime mortgages here, but even if we are, anyone who is old enough to make a choice like buying a house has a responsibility to understand what they're getting into.  It's why children don't go around buying houses, but adults do.  Because adults have a personal responsibility for the choices they make, they are expected to understand the consequences, and to find out the consequences if they don't know them already.  You don't have to ""respect"" your bank, whatever that means.  I think banks did some horrendous things, lying to other business entities about the value of their subprime mortgage securities, etc. and the executives should be (and in some cases were) held accountable for their poor choices.  But let's not pretend that was the reason someone defaulted on their loan, or that somehow gives them a pass to break their agreement with their bank."
personalfinance,3doj8z,aqf,18,Sat Jul 18 09:44:53 2015 UTC,"As someone mentioned, defaulting comes with some harsh consequences. It's never done lightly. And no one really plans to default from the get go.   But when you took out the loan, both you and the bank knew the laws surrounding bankruptcy. The bank isn't blindsided by a loan that goes bad, they have predictive models for it, and they've already charged everyone a little bit higher interest rate than they really needed to, in order to cover their losses when a few loans go sour.   No one is saying to default as a matter of course. But never say never, and don't be ashamed if your circumstances lead you to defaulting."
personalfinance,3doj8z,crimson117,9,Sat Jul 18 10:38:24 2015 UTC,"it's okay to take out a loan, and then not pay it back because ""that's just business""   Yes, businesses do this to banks all the time, and nobody blinks an eye or casts moral judgment.   It is literally the cost of doing business for the bank.   The bank is lending out money with some risk of default.  It is their job to do a thorough assessment of the risk to any given borrower,  and they are compensated for that risk with an interest rate premium based upon the risk profile of the borrower.  If you are a risky borrower, you will get charged a higher interest rate than the base (say 6%).  If you are a less risky borrower, you will be charged a lower interest rate (say 4%).   The difference between the base interest rate, and the rate charged based upon the likelihood of non-payment, is the risk premium (e.g. 2%).  The bank is being compensated for the perceived risk of default.  They are literally making more money off of high risk borrowers if they pay back.  The risk of default is built into their calculations.  Nobody forces a bank to lend to higher-risk borrowers.  They are doing so with a profit motive and a clear-eyed understanding of the risk of default. There is no morality involved."

Either start paying off debt or file for bankruptcy or default on debt or whatever (see financial councilors about making that decision) and then I'd have my parents sell their home (or rent it out depending on the market and such) and have them either move in with one of my siblings or myself or we'd take turns (maybe based on the month) having them at our house.  This used to be extremely common practice in the earlier half of the 20th century and prior (watch a few episodes of The Waltons).  It's economically efficient and practical as you will be there to care for your parents as they slowly become less capable of taking care of themselves.  And if you have children you'll rarely need a babysitter and they'll get to spend lots of time with their grandparents.  Everyone wins.

Any advice I give here is just a possible strategy to discuss with said professional as I am not a lawyer nor do I have any responsibility to you.  As was mentioned, I would keep that $100k completely separate. I would take a HELOC plus whatever else from the 100k and just pay off the PLUS loans.   After that, I would just straight up default on the credit cards and just not pay them a dime. I wouldn't go through with bankruptcy as that is actually way worse for credit than just defaulting. They won't have any access to credit and will have to live with a positive cash flow for 7 years, but after that 7 years when it drops off their credit report they will essentially be in the clear. As retirement is looming, the difference between bankruptcy and just default seems a big deal."

However you decide to untangle the mess, try to remember that on a personal level your parents were doing what they thought was right to help you succeed. At the end of the day, it's just money, and it really isn't your problem. You should do all you can to get them out of the financial hole.

personalfinance,3doj8z,flogmorton,5,Sat Jul 18 08:35:04 2015 UTC,"You have two viable options here.   Option 1   Pay off as many high interest rate (8%) PLUS loans as you can with the 100k. If balance transfers are an option, consolidate as much CC debt as you can to a 0% card.  Pay the minimums on the consolidated CC debt. Put every spare cent towards the remaining PLUS loans. Pay off the credit cards.    Option 2   Pay off all credit cards immediately. Put every spare cent towards the PLUS loans.    Option 1 sounds mathematically stupid, but keep in mind you cannot discharge student loans in bankruptcy. If you get rid of non-dischargeable debt first, you have the option to file for bankruptcy if something bad happens, and your creditors cannot garnish your wages. This option is even better if you can consolidate the credit card debt.   Option 2 is the mathematically sound way to do things. This is a riskier option if your parents do not change their shitty spending habits.   I have to say this too. You are going to get a lot of butthurt posts about how it's ""not your problem"" and you should just throw your parents under the bus. Technically speaking, it's not your problem, especially the credit card debt. Ignore these posts. Help your parents and educate them on how to do things right. With multiple people working together you will eliminate the debt in no time. Then if they rack up credit card debt again and don't change their ways... it's not your problem.

personalfinance,3doj8z,wapatilly,12,Sat Jul 18 00:06:41 2015 UTC,"I think that if you have kids that care about their parents, ultimately it IS going to be the OP's problem?  Why?  Right now they are relatively young at 61 and working and taking full care of themselves.  When they are older eventually they will not be able to care for themselves as much as health deteriorates, medical costs rise, and they lose the ability to take care of their home and day to day living.  So what may not be seen as ""his problem"" with working parents in their 60's definitely will become ""his problem"" with parents in their 80's or 90's that are restricted in mobility and have no money whatsoever for additional help outside of what they can qualify for under Medicare/Medicaid.  The OP sounds younger - based on the PLUS loans in existence still not much past 30, maybe younger.  In his/her (I will use ""her"" from now on for simplicity) 40's or 50's with kids of her own, caring for elderly declining parents will start to loom on the horizon.  That can be difficult on its own, elderly, declining BROKE parents are a lot more challenging.   So to those that say its ""not her problem"" - I'd say she is right grab the bull by the horns now and sort this out as well as possible, it will only get worse as time goes by unless she chooses to abandon her parents when they need her later in life.  Too many people don't talk money with aging parents and end up with nasty surprises when it comes time to think about assisted living, senior housing, long term care, etc."

They'll likely be able to get a much lower interest rate than the credit cards at least, but likely most of the PLUS loans as well. Use that as much as possible. Incorporate the zero interest balance transfer options, your lump sum family contribution and mint and you'll be able to make significant progress. I think you'll be able to get them to the max social security age that way. Any chance for additional part time work? Newspaper delivery, postal route, babysitting, tutoring, dog walking. Anything for a few extra bucks to throw at the debt. It's awesome that your family is pulling together to deal with this.

As for spending everything while you were at uni: don't feel bad about it at all. I did the exact same thing. Uni is a fucking grueling process and you have to sacrifice quite a lot to make any substantial savings while you're earning so little. If buying a bit more takeaway or going out once a week helped you get through, so be it.   The important thing is being able to flick the switch and commit to living in a low percentage of your salary now that you have a job.   One thing that i recommend for partners with uneven salaries is for the partner who earns less to set their own savings rate, then have the higher earner match the spending pound for pound. So if one of you earns 25k, they try to save 50% and live on 12.5k, while the other earns 60k but still only lives on 12.5k. That way nobody is a burden, nobody is envious, you can both have savings goals to work towards AND your savings are massively accelerated."

You're in a far more equal situation than you think. He may have the higher salary, but you're bringing in the near immediate financial independence with a paid for home, even if it needs an update.  My advice, get joint accounts for where you can have joint expenses (like council taxes, utilities, Internet, etc) and savings (vacations, renovations, etc) and agree on a ratio of what each of you should contribute regularly. Discuss how much you each make after taxes and where it should go, such as debt or savings. This can include each of you keeping a portion of your own money to do with as you please. The first few times you have is conversation is awkward and maybe even a little infantilizing, but it gets easier. Being happily married means having these ""personal"" conversations.   My wife and I completely integrated our finances, where all our money goes into one pot and we each have a separate personal account that gets a monthly allowance to spend on whatever we want. If I go for drinks with my buddies, it's out of my allowance. If we have dinner together, it's out of our joint accounts.

Then, once you've completed these steps, I'd save up an emergency fund, buy an inexpensive car with cash, and RENT your own place for a few years until you're finished with school and well on your way to earning a stable income. Then, I'd recommend saving up for a strong downpayment on your first home! An exciting journey! Having an emergency fund is the key to success with home ownership so that the house will be a blessing. Because homeownership comes with tons of joyous expenses.  Generally using a Roth IRA is for saving for retirement. You don't want to use them here. If you're saving for something that you're going to purchase in 1-5 years, use a savings or money market account."

I am guessing you also don't have an emergency fund (an additional savings of 6 months' expenses).   Moving out doesn't mean buying a house. In most cases at this age you will not be settled yet, so an apartment or small rental house (if they are cheap enough in your area) is much more appropriate.   Once you get to the point of saving up for a down payment I would stick it in a money market account since it will be short term.   Here is some reading to get you started."

personalfinance,3dt12t,NighthawkFoo,5,Sun Jul 19 11:50:49 2015 UTC,"You need to find out what the fees and price increases are for.  Is it to invest in the property, make investments, do work and repairs? That's well within the rights of the HOA to do provided it follows procedures.  You should have a copy of the procedures doc. If not ask for one.  And they should also have a policy and procedure to communicate with you a certain amount of time before raising the rates. Again, it should be in your document.  And who does this, how, all that stuff is in there.  If it's a professional firm, it's most likely that they are not breaking any rules.    As for not paying, that's a bad idea.  Most HOA's have the ability to impose fines and liens and even foreclose on the property to collect the debt.  Mine certainly does.  So I would do a lot more research into this situation.  It's a big drawback to being in a condo as over time fees become really high.   Now that market dynamics have changed, they are probably just looking to make major investments in the property to help get it up to value, increase saleability. They probably need funds to do that is a simple explanation."
personalfinance,3dt12t,Mystery_Donut,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:54:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, this.   I'd like to add that if OP's Association went bankrupt, it's because the revenue was less than the expenses. Not knowing anything else about the situation, I know that the dues needed to be increased. It sounds like they are fixing that problem now.  The fact that they are raising the dues is a good sign. The other way of dealing with this would be to pass a special assessment. This would have been a large chunk of money payable immediately. For an association that has gone bankrupt, this would have probably been a band-aid anyways.   If he or she can, OP should volunteer to help with the Board. If not, OP should e-mail the management company to get a copy of the financials monthly and keep on top of the spending."

personalfinance,3dsdsw,JoeTony6,3,Sun Jul 19 14:27:36 2015 UTC,"Job A, by using a temp-to-perm hiring system, knows that it will have a higher than average turnover during the temp phase, assuming that most candidates are seeking a perm position.  On the other hand, for employers, any turnover is disruptive; turnover of new employees especially so, because they've basically received no value from your employment, and taken a fair amount of time to find and hire you.  It is always in your best interest long-term to just be honest with your employer.  If you stay in the same city for years, eventually you meet your former co-workers again, and you want to avoid having the reputation of being a mercenary.  Just explain to Employer A that you are looking for a perm job, and you have another offer in the oven.  Most reasonable employers will give another week or two.

You have to modify your budget ask the time to account for the number of pay periods, since it changes the number of bills and income you get in any given month.

personalfinance,3dqxmq,sporksable,8,Sat Jul 18 21:46:06 2015 UTC,"Isn't the whole point of YNAB to only input the money you actually have? So you would only budget when you actually get paid?

personalfinance,3dqxmq,stevey_frac,0,Sun Jul 19 00:29:25 2015 UTC,"Right,  so,  that means that every two weeks,  I would have to put in my pay,  and then manually input a dozen or so payments to various things,  because they'll cross over the monthly boundaries that YNAB creates.  Not all said payments come out on exactly the same day as I get paid on,  and as much as possible my payments are all bi-weekly as well.  So if I get paid near the end a month,  which happens fairly regularly,  I have to go look up with payment comes out when, and then put the payment into the correct month,  by hand.  YNAB strongly pushes you to do monthly budgeting...  Conversely,  my excel spreadsheet just has a start day for each pay period, and all my nominal expenses that happen every pay are simply copied over automagically.  What's why I wish they would let me chose a bi-weekly schedule,  so that recurring payments / bills would all be simply auto-populated after being entered once.  I don't know.  Perhaps I've gotten this all wrong, but I didn't find YNAB super easy to use during my one month trial..."

If you are an employee, failing to pay you is almost always considered constructive dismissal, so you can file for unemployment immediately. You should also be able to file a claim for any unpaid wages (for work you performed before you stopped going to work) with your state's department of labor (or the federal Department of Labor if your state doesn't have one).   If you are an independent contractor, unfortunately your only recourse is probably going to be to sue the company for your unpaid fees, and collecting on a judgement against a bankrupt startup may prove to be difficult or impossible."

personalfinance,3dspk0,cinnamonjscudworth,3,Sun Jul 19 02:17:03 2015 UTC,"I had a similar situation while pursuing my MBA. There are a lot of interesting things to consider here.  Just to be sure I am clear. You have worked in Tax year 2015 and made more than ~4k? In tax year 2016 do you expect to work (in an internship or something else) and earn more than ~4k? If not your dad can take you as an eligible dependent and have more favorable tax brackets/deductions.  On the other hand if you do work and can't become a dependent, in tax year 2016 you'll probably have a great opportunity to convert any Traditional IRA/401k money you have with low or no tax costs. You may even wish to consider making Traditional contributions in year 2015 because you will be able to convert in 2016, which I think is a clever move. I do think you can convert a Roth IRA to a Traditional IRA in a given tax year (turbo tax specifically mentions its an atypical thing)  You'll also be in a good position to take capital gains because of your temporarily reduced income (and you may never be in a low bracket again if your MBA is a success). However, you should also consider the fact that when your father passes the cost basis of the assets you inherit will be set to the date of his death. (Sorry not trying to be morbid, but when you actually have money end of life planning is important)  Do you think your investments growth rate will be greater than the interest you'll be charged for taking loans instead? Hard to see into the future!  There are some tax breaks for education also that are worth considering. 2k non refundable life long learning tax credit OR a 4k tax deduction. Either you or your dad could take these depending on where the money comes from to pay for the tuition and filing status.  As for your specific questions.   1) Yes I believe this is correct. But he could also just give you smaller amounts over the next 2-3 years and you'll have the same result, since tuition bills come each semester and not all at once. You should also consider what the tax situation might be like if he just pays the tuition directly.  2) If you're going to use the money, I think you should cash out what you need as you need it. If you're going to take loans instead, then I would agree its best to diversity your portfolio rather than stay with a small number of specific stocks.   3) I am an idiot and I did not see your very last comment that you're continuing to work full time. So most of this not helpful."
personalfinance,3dspk0,pho1701,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:22:56 2015 UTC,"Ah, so you're saying do a mini Roth conversion ladder while my income is low to clear out the chump change I have in my 403b? Why would i want to convert my roth to a traditional though?  With regard to your cost basis comment, is your point that it may be better to inherit later rather than gift now?"
personalfinance,3dspk0,pho1701,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:34:07 2015 UTC,"Well keep in mind all of the stuff in that was post was written under the assumption you were going to be a full time student and earn very little money. When an otherwise well off person who has assets leaves a job and doesn't earn very much money in a given tax year that can create great opportunity for realizing capital gains and doing Roth conversions and so on, since tax rates are determined each year, independent of last year's taxes or the total amount of post-Tax assets you have. Since you're actually going to continue to work I think a lot of what I wrote is not helpful - I still posted it because maybe something is helpful to someone.  As for your specific questions,   Since you're not leaving your current job you probably cannot convert the money in your 403b. Honestly I don't think you can change Roth money to Traditional money in general, but I think 2015 contributions to a Roth IRA might be able to be changed to Traditional IRAs instead, since taxes haven't been filed yet- that way you'd get the tax deduction today (even if its a small deduction because your income is low since you're only working half the year - under my erroneous assumption you were going to be a full time student and not work). Then in year 2016 you could convert this back to Roth, and pay very little, or maybe even no taxes, since you'll hardly make any money in 2016 (again, I was assuming you were going to be a full time student). Sorry I was not super clear on this in my post, again probably does not matter for you, since you're not going to be a full time student. As for the cost basis question. If he gives you the stock today the cost basis of this stock is the cost basis as it is today, and if you sell the stock you'll pay taxes on the gains (unless your personal tax bracket in the year of the sale is low enough that you wont have to pay taxes). However, if the stocks are inherited by you from your dad when he dies (sorry in advance) the cost basis is set to the stock prices the day of his death, and there wont be taxes regardless of your tax bracket. So yes, depending entirely on your family's personal situation, and the nature of the particular stocks, it may be better to inherit than to gift."
personalfinance,3dspk0,pho1701,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:27:20 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. As for #3: I thought I assume my father's cost basis if he gifts them to me.

Ironically its a death that actually does let a family avoid some taxes.  As an example, your grandma got the stocks in 1930 for 17 cents (lol), she died in 1996 and they were were worth $18,000, cost basis was set to $18,000 when your dad inherited. When your dad dies in 2037, the cost basis is set to $145,000, when you inherit. (Assuming no laws change etc - again just an example). What your grandma paid originally is no longer relevant for your decision making process."

personalfinance,3dspk0,pho1701,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:12:39 2015 UTC,"If he gives you the stock today the cost basis does not change, it will continue to be based on the prices on the day your grandma died.

Technically it should have and technically it did. A person is under no obligation to claim all the tax credits they are entitled to and the state is under no obligation to force them on people.  The tax return filed indicated that you were not availing yourself of the credit. The tax that was then calculated as being owed was then not paid.  Since a lien was (in my opinion) properly filed and then paid, paid/closed is the correct notation. Paying the debt underlying a lien will not automatically remove it from a credit report.  If you want the lien removed, you're going to have to contact the state and ask them their procedures for vacating a tax lien. If/when the lien is vacated, you can then dispute the lien on your credit report."

These basic necessities are BASIC. No restaurants! No movies! The idea is that you stabilize your situation so you can begin to find margin in your budget to attack your debt.  Step 2: Save $1000 cash in the bank as your emergency fund. This protects you against life's little ups and downs.  This money is not for spending on anything except emergencies! If you have to spend any of this money you hit pause on the later steps and fill it back up.  Step 3: Attack debt. Pay the $300 you owe the phone company.  Can you get a cheaper plan? The going rate nowadays is ~$20/mo for smartphone service with outfits like Ting and Republic Wireless.  I'm rich as fuck and I'd never sign up for one of those predatory schemes that cost $80/mo.

I was down to my last $100 and had recently started a new job at far less than I was making prior to 9/11.  If you can, you may consider moving back in with family for a bit until you get back on your feet.  If that is not an option, focus on working your butt off so you earn money, impress the boss, maybe get promoted and earn more money. While doing that save every cent you can to get financially stable.  Cook so you can buy healthier food cheaper.  Be careful with expenses on alcohol.  Stretch and exercise at home - push ups, squats, crunches etc.  You need to stay healthy in order to work.  Realistically, you will not be able to earn enough at $10/h to start investing for a year or more.  I'd put that on the back burner until you've amassed a few grand in savings.  What I would do in the meantime is read some books on the topic so that you educate yourself on how to do successfully and follow the markets and companies of interest closely so that you are well educated on the topic, the markets and the companies of interest and can hit the ground running when you get to that point.

You can make due with a smaller emergency fund of 1-3 months of expenses while you still have the credit card debt.  I recommend that you read and follow the advice in ""How to handle $"" from the PF Wiki.  The diagram is based on it.  Read it very carefully regarding emergency fund sizing and paying off debts.  Once you are down to debts that only have 4-5% interest rates (or lower), then you should think about contributing to an IRA."

personalfinance,3dsja6,tubaleiter,3,Sun Jul 19 11:56:16 2015 UTC,"You could put them in Roth IRAs, from which you can withdraw contributions tax and penalty free (withdrawing any earnings would incur penalties). That's $11k/year for you and your wife combined. Even if you don't need it for retirement, it's nice to have a bit more tax-free earnings when you retire. It doesn't cost any more than investing in a taxable account and is almost as quick to access if you need it, plus the tax benefits.  529 is the logical place for college savings. Since you said you aren't paying state income tax it doesn't really matter where you open it; Vanguard is generally low fee and highly recommended around here.  Anything beyond the IRA and 529, you could put in taxable investments, probably index funds. You can withdraw that whenever you want, although you could owe taxes on capital gains (although your tax bracket is likely low enough as an E6 that you won't)."

personalfinance,3dtue5,NetSage,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:39:36 2015 UTC,"In investing, if you assume the market is efficient, then returns are tied to risk.  For example, this assumes that there is no way that you can make a higher return, with less risk, than anyone else.    If you are investing in public equity markets, I would say that this idea is probably pretty true.  Same for anything else that's traded on exchanges, like currencies, bonds, or commodities.   Any increase in expected returns above the U.S. Treasury rates (very low for short term investments, about 1.7% for 5 year bonds) you tack on more risk.  So an investment that has a 5% rate over 5 years has a 3.3% premium over the risk-free rate for perceived 'risk'.    When you say 'fast and secure' I assume you mean 0% chance of losing money.  Therefore, the answer to your question is ""no"".  How much money are we talking?  There are some checking accounts where by jumping through hoops you can get a decent return (3%/4%), but only on a limited amount of money (caps of $500 to $10,000).    What time span are we talking about here?  If you have only 3 months, that would be different advice than if you had 1 year, 5 years or 30 years.   What is the money for?"

During my first application cycle in 2012, my stats were stronger. I actually had a tentative acceptance pending completion of my degree (including OChem 3), but that was before the death in my family occurred and I withdrew from my courses. I tried taking OChem 3 as soon after as I could, but it didn't go well (not surprising, considering it was almost a year later).  I am not offended in any means. I completely understand what you're saying, and I know it's definitely a risk. The main issue with me working full-time while attending school is that I prioritize my job over my education, so if my boss asks me to work 15 hours of OT or to fly to Europe in 5 days (both of which happened last time I tried to return to school), that's what I'm going to do regardless of my long-term goals. I think it'll be more effective for me to change this behavior by having a job where my hours are limited and there's no chance they're going to send me to another country.  I have considered the other roles too. I have family who are physical therapists and nurses, and I admire them a lot. They've arranged opportunities for me to see what they do on a day-to-day basis, which were really useful. But I'd like to at least try to get into medical school. I'm trying to get into a DO program specifically, if that changes your advice any (I do know DO schools tend to do grade replacement on apps, which would be useful).  Again, I really appreciate the advice. I definitely think you're bringing up a lot of good points, and I'm interested in what else you may have to suggest."
personalfinance,3dqs2w,exFAL,21,Sat Jul 18 18:12:40 2015 UTC,"Your original post did not make it seem like you were this far along. Though I stand by my general concerns. I do think its more likely to get into a DO program. But your general GPAs are not ideal and your MCAT score is not fantastic. (Please understand, I am not trying to be derogatory, these are challenging classes and tests, you are probably a very bright and capable person)   As far as money goes, unless you have extremely wealthy parents, you will take out huge loans to go to medical school. Your savings and income today are kind of trivial in comparison.  Call the director of admissions at the program you were tentatively accepted to. He may be able to give you some advice on your situation."
personalfinance,3dqs2w,timeless_telomeres,5,Sat Jul 18 18:28:45 2015 UTC,"That's a great idea. I hadn't thought to call the director of admissions, but I think he should be able to help a lot.  I don't have a problem taking out loans for medical school itself. I'd just like to avoid being dependent on loans while working on my prereqs if I can help it. Thanks so much!"
personalfinance,3dqs2w,TulipSamurai,5,Sat Jul 18 18:40:37 2015 UTC,"You should really post to dr and medstudent reddit. And talk to a med advisor.  From my limited background, I say your grades are good enough for a small city nursing program.  For medical school, apply to some legit overseas ones since I have feeling it hard to gain admissions to a stateside one under budget."
personalfinance,3dqs2w,TulipSamurai,4,Sat Jul 18 18:39:00 2015 UTC,"DO here. Your MCAT is fine. I would retake the any core classes (bio, physics, gen chem, o chem, bio chem) where you got less than a B-. Take them at a CC if possible. Continue to build research/medical experiences. Have two DO letters of rec.   That being said, from a financial perspective I would strongly urge you to pay the max you can afford on your debt before matriculating. I would also budget for $3000-5000 for applying/interviewing. Of note many places (including both DO schools in WA and OR) require $1500+ deposits after acceptance that are non-refundable if you go somewhere else. I would also look at military and/or NHSC scholarships. Both of these programs pay 100% of your tuition and give stipends while in school. There is a pay back either to serve in one of armed force branches or work in primary care at FQHC. Tuition at most medical schools run approx $50K/yr. Most med students graduate with $250k in debt at an approx 7.5-8.1% interest rate. Do research and be prepared."

personalfinance,3dqs2w,equivocal20,3,Sat Jul 18 17:01:17 2015 UTC,"I'm 25 years old. And I should have clarified - I was able to get through my basic physics courses easily, and I'd like to take some additional upper-level physics classes. I definitely could skip them, but I feel like it's a good idea to take some classes that are interesting and contribute to my sGPA.  My undergrad degree was in a foreign language. I was supposed to get an anthropology degree, but my adviser retired and nobody would sign off on the exception he'd made to my degree requirements (subbed out two required classes for ones I took abroad)."
personalfinance,3dqs2w,amleejo,7,Sat Jul 18 17:44:54 2015 UTC,I don't recommend taking upper level physics if it's not required. It's harder than you think it is. You already have enough classes to take as it is and you should save your money and focus on acing your actual prereqs.
personalfinance,3dqs2w,Etopn23,3,Sat Jul 18 18:24:30 2015 UTC,"Okay, good advice. I might just take a few additional Bio and math classes, then. Thank you!"
personalfinance,3dqs2w,zeddit123,6,Sat Jul 18 18:41:35 2015 UTC,"Strongly consider becoming a PA instead of an MD/DO.  PA will require probably 1 year of pre requisites, 2 years of school which is cheaper than med school, and then you get a job making about 100K where you can treat patients in the office, assist in surgery, round and treat patients admitted to the hospital, and still have a wonderful patient provider interaction and a great deal of autonomy and decision making capacity.  PA's are an integral part of my practice and of medicine and are well respected, and the ones I work with are very happy with their lives.  They also work 40 hours a week.  Alternatively, if you really cannot be anything but a doctor and be happy, then go down the long path to becoming one, 2 years pre requisites with STRAIGHT As.  (If you get anything less than an A- in those classes you really have no chance with your current GPA), 4 years of very expensive school (my debt was $285K) 3-7 years of residency, 1-3 years of fellowship, and then a salary of 150-500K depending on speciality.  Oh, and you work 80 hours a week or so during training, more than that studying in med school, and in practice 50-100 hours a week depending on field.   Another point, if you don't want to do primary care then consider going to an MD program, as getting into a speciality from a DO program is much harder than from an MD program.    Financially, in your situation a job as a PA makes more sense if you ask me.  I would only go down the doctor track if that is the only thing you will be satisfied with.  It is hard, long and extremely time consuming, and you will delay family and social life for the next 10+ years while you are completing it.  Of course it is also extremely rewarding and for me personally I wouldn't have chosen anything else.  It is, however, not the best thing for everyone, and many doctors are very unhappy especially in our current doctor hate environment.  Good luck with everything."

personalfinance,3dqs2w,Aldfrith,5,Sun Jul 19 06:17:08 2015 UTC,"Nursing is great, that being said, the fastest way to become a provider would be the midlevel route - as you're not currently a RN I would consider becoming a physician assistant. The prerequisite courses are virtually identical to the MD route, it's shorter and more forgiving GPA-wise, you will be able to diagnose/treat/prescribe and be taught under the medical model, and you'll be joining the fastest growing and highest rated (as far as satisfaction is considered) job in the medical field.  Hell, if you're willing to join the military as a PA - not only will they pay off your tuition, they'll start you off as an O-2. Outside of that, by working in a medically underserved area you can have a percentage of your loan paid off in addition to your salary yearly.  That salary in Texas is starting at 100k+ (not sure about other states).  You are literally the perfect candidate for PA school. You should really consider it."

personalfinance,3dqs2w,ealpotnics,4,Sat Jul 18 22:59:23 2015 UTC,"X-post of mine from another thread:  Hey, I just want to give my two cents as someone who was accepted into medical school and turned it down.  I honestly do not think that medicine is a good career.  I have a half a dozen friends in medical school, and they unanimously hate it.    If I told you that you would have to work 36 hours straight, work with human feces/urine/vomit/blood on a daily basis, work 80-hour-weeks, work at all times of the day and night, be on call at any time, and go hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt while losing out on some of the best years of your life would you tell me that is a good career?    There is just something about medicine that is alluring.  I think it is a romanticized version where doctors are sometimes looked at like the only people who make a difference in the world.  I don't think that's true.  Imagine being an engineer who helps to perfect self-driving cars, saving 35k lives a year.  Isn't that just (if not a lot more) meaningful than what a doctor does?  Medicine is a career with an extremely high burnout and depression rate.  Physicians have the highest suicide rate of any profession in the country for a reason.  Ultimately, I'm just some dude on the internet, but I would seriously look into and research the downsides before embarking on a potential 10 year journey.  Also, how do you know that you like it?  Have you shadowed substantially?  Honestly, I don't think even that will tell you.  You really have to do something every day for months to experience the inevitable decline in enthusiasm that everybody has when their job starts to drag on.  You won't get to do that until you are already neck deep in debt.  I'll tell you a short anecdote about why I think so many people think medicine is an attractive career.  When my 7-year-old nephew found out that I turned down being a doctor he said to me.  ""But Uncle ____, I think you could do it!""  It was really sweet, but even he, at 7, thought that being a doctor is the ultimate profession.  It's indoctrinated into you at a young age.  I'm here to tell you that it isn't. Think really hard before you commit on this path.  You get what are called ""golden handcuffs"" the day you begin medical school.  The first year you will find yourself $60k+ in debt.  At this point, if you quit, you'd have nothing to show for it but debt.  There is simply no way out.  So, you have to keep going for the rest of your life.  You better not have even a snippet of doubt if you are ready for that.  I had doubt.  I said no.   Since this is a personal finance thread, I should probably include something about PF.  Here is a link to a good article about how doctors really do not make that much money.  http://whitecoatinvestor.com/the-deceptive-income-of-physicians/"

Having been through something similar before, tax treatment really depends on how this particular deal is set up.  Set aside worst case amount (assume treated as income) to cover federal and state (if applicable).  If withholding hasn't been done for you as part of the deal, you may need to initiate a tax payment ahead of time (estimated) to avoid a penalty with the IRS next year (pay as you go taxation).  Note that it is sometimes cheaper to just take the penalty rather than pay an accountant to run through the extra math associated with estimated tax payments.  Here's another aspect that should be thought about.  I assume that the husband now has a stake(shares) in the company.  It's unclear if this company existed before or just sprang into existence.  There may be tax issues with receiving the share of the company (fraction of company * company worth).  In any case, you should discuss that aspect with an accountant.  Bonus tip, get a notebook (or create a backed up digital document) and write down everything that occurs with this.  Make notes about every communication and transaction that occur relating to this, every dollar spent on taxes, every tax consultation note, etc. along with time/date that the event occurred.  Next April, you, or your accountant are going to be wondering when you made a certain dollar and trying to figure out how it should be taxed.

I had the same thing happen to me with DRB with similar numbers ($65k income, $97K debt).  I read online most places require you to be under 40% debt to income ratio and when I called DRB they confirmed they use 40% as well.  However the confusing part for me was that my DTIR was about 25% when I applied and would be even lower were I to get approved by them.  They told me they were showing my DTIR as 52% so I asked to explain where the heck they were getting that number.  I spoke with 2 customer service representatives and they both said they automatically add $1000 to your monthly debt payments for housing (even if you rent or in my case, live with family and pay no rent).  I asked them to remove this from the DTIR calculations and they refused.  They were also showing student loan payments of like $1500/month were I to get approved and they said they use their 5 year payoff plan in your DTIR calculations.  I told both CSR's that were I to be approved I'd go with the 20 year plan, not the 5 year plan as I'm trying to give myself more breathing room in my monthly budget.  Both CSR's said ""well we might not approve you for the 20 year plan so we're going with the 5 year plan for your DTIR"".  That was really odd to me as every loan I have ever been approved has given me the option to choose every single advertised repayment term.  After DRB turned me down after like a month of uploading documents and going back and forth with CSR's on what they want I applied with Citizens bank.  The entire process took about 4 days and I was approved and funded without a cosigner.  My credit score was ~740 at the time and I chose the 20 year variable loan.  With the 0.25% autopay discount and 0.25% loyalty discount (my checking account is with them as well) my final interest rate was 4.94%.  Not as awesome as DRB/SoFi's advertised rates but it sure beats the 10.75% I was paying before.  I also want to add Citizens' application process and customer service is light years ahead of DRB's.  With DRB I had to upload documents..wait..wait..call and ask what they were doing..told to just wait a little while longer..wait some more..and then finally see my documents approved.  This happened with just about everything they asked me to upload so everytime I called I had to explain my situation again to some new CSR.  With Citizens Bank I was contacted the next business day after applying by both phone and email by one person (I believe Britney was her name) and she was my contact person throughout the entire process.  When she needed something she would email me and understood my situation and when I needed something I could email her and get a very quick response."
personalfinance,3dqzrj,Cammywhiteface,2,Sun Jul 19 00:27:02 2015 UTC,"No kidding. That would explain why some of my attempts with DRB fell through even though I was only applying to consolidate two loans at <30% of my income. I had better experience with uploading documents though, it only took a few days before they responded with a denial. But your customer service experience definitely sounds preferable.   You've convinced me to try with Citizens'. Were you able to refinance all of your loans with them, or just a portion of the original $97k?"

They removed the PLUS loan because it wasn't in my name (I was almost certain they'd do that but I figured it was worth a shot) but they refinanced the 2 private loans no problem.

personalfinance,3dqzrj,pho1701,-3,Sun Jul 19 01:44:15 2015 UTC,"If you use the debt avalanche approach and aggressively pay the loans  down you can pay less in interest. The final interest will most likely be very competitive to what you would have paid in consolidation.  I paid $105K in debt (varying interest rates) in 5.5 years and I avoided paying about $60K in interest fees. At the time I was making $70-73K in the aerospace industry.   To do this I maintained a $1000 emergency fund, didn't invest in 401K (not even the match), worked part-time (48 hours per month), and like you I moved to a cheaper place. Every extra dime I could throw at the debt I did. My goal was to be debt free, now I am free to focus everything on building wealth and living life.

Behavioral finance is the reason that most financial decisions are not based on math alone.

I think behavioral finance as a field is more useful in this context for understanding the mistakes people make than determining optimal courses of action. He is an aerospace engineer, he has a career and earning growth potential, he can pay back these loans as is. I think this is the advice he wants/needs."

It is an option that I choose when my goal was to become debt free as soon as possible and pay as little in interest as possible. We all can agree that the decision had a mathematical impact on my financials. However, was not big enough to make me change my goal or keep me up at night. Every year after the debt was gone and I fully funded the emergency fund, I have contributed 15% of my income to retirement regardless of the match. Since I was debt free when I was layed off in a merger restructuring I was able to continue investing while collecting unemployment.

personalfinance,3dqzrj,amnmonix,-1,Sat Jul 18 22:35:47 2015 UTC,"You are the 3rd person to acknowledge that forgoing the match is a ""mistake"". To shed some light on the ""mistake"", I ran some numbers to determine the size of this ""mistake"" using my personal experience.  Here are the details:   Salary - $70000 Match - 3% (vested after two years) Contribution amount - $4200 annually or $350 monthly Rate of return - 8% (I chose this because I have seen it alot in examples)   calculator for calculation.  In the 5.5 years I spent paying off my debt my company only matched for 4.5 years. The amount that the company would have given was $8,400.00 and total contribution would be 16,800. In 4.5 years I would have earned $3,639.72 interest making the total equal to $20,439.72.  Let's look at where the $20,439.72 will be by the time I am 65 (34 years from the debt free date). Over the next 34 years the interest is estimated to grow $259,382.78, giving me a balance of $279,822.50.  I walked away from $279,822.50  and the number seems really big at the beginning of a financial journey. In the end this number will not seem as big.  When I got out of debt I started contributing 15% and collecting the 3% match of the $70,000 salary, which was $1050 ($875 +175) per month. When I plug these numbers into the calculator with the same assumptions from above the balance is projected to be $2,158,591.78.   Do you really think at this point I am sitting at the kitchen table crying over $279,822.50 that I walked away from 34 years ago?  Side Notes:   As a side not this calculation assumes that I will never get a raise.  Please do not forget that this retirement account is only part of my networth/wealth building strategy and it will only represent half of my household networth once married.  There was financial value from getting out of debt 24.5 years early.    In the long run the decision to temporarily pause retirement contributions to aggressively get out of debt is not detrimental to my financial future and is not the worst thing one can decide.   /u/rmlrn the personal finance reddit is the correct place for this discussion."

Just because you disagree with someones approach doesn't mean you have to be disrespectful. Maybe it's just a lack of home training.  I do understand the math and that at age 65 I would have an additional $279,822.50 to add to the $2M+ in my retirement accounts. Do you understand that when I am reviewing my wealth , at 65 years old, the $279,822.50 won't even be a thought in my mind because I am a mutli-millionaire.   From your response I feel that you struggle with seeing the big picture. In the post you commented on I clearly stated that the numbers represented would only be a portion of my networth, so the calculation you did is not all inclusive and renders your statement above (>10%) inaccurate. The reason it is inaccurate is because you did it based of my retirement contributions not my total networth.   If my money is still in my retirement account, it is clear that I didn't need it along the way and I am not hurting from the tiny decision I made to temporarily not take advantage of my employers match 35ish years prior.   In regards to you thinking it is a ""mistake"", I want you to understand that it would only be a mistake if my ONLY goal in life was to amass the most money possible. This may sound very cool to you and others, but it is not my goal. Personal finance is just as much ""personal preference"" as it is ""mathematical calculations"", therefore each of us will find a path that is right for us and our families.  People (you included) make decision everyday that could amount to them walking away from just as much if not more ""free money"". This is called ""opportunity cost"". Everytime money is spent on no necessities people are opting not to invest it and earn interest. So how much money have walked away from?  Can you sit back reflect on past and think about future financial decisions and HONESTLY say that you've never made the decision to walk away from free money?

Anyway, as someone who suffers from a pretty good deal amount of social anxiety myself, I know this is not what you want to hear, but you need to call the 1-800 number of the company that you signed up for (any store that offers a line of credit has a 1-800 number for their credit lines.. just go to their website and look for it somewhere on there).  You'll need to explain to them that you thought you were signing up for a rewards card, not a credit card, and need to get this corrected because you may of gave wrong information (essentially you need to tell them what you told us here).

It's quite similar to the Dave Ramsey style mentioned belowthread, but is much more flexible.  It allows you to use credit cards. It does take a bit of work, but I'm liking it.  In the process I use, I take a look at my YNAB budget after every paycheck. I'm hourly, and get a decent amount of overtime, so every check is different. Once I get that deposit, I look at my bills. Specifically, what hasn't been paid for this month. Ideally, I should have those categories funded from income from last month, but life happens.  Then I look at my ""necessary to live"" categories (gas, groceries, etc). Do I have enough to last me until the next paycheck? Ideally, again, those categories should be prefunded from previous income. If I need more fuel or food, I'll toss a few bucks into the categories.   Then I look at next month. I have bills due. Lets fund those now. So I figure out what my mandatory bills are, and push my income from the current month into the next month. Perhaps I can cover all bills for next month this paycheck? It's pretty sweet when that happens.   Then I take a look at what ""nice to have"" categories I can put money into. Spending money, clothing, etc. Toss some cash here, cash there.   I'm also looking long term. I'll fund my roth contribution, vacation fund, and any big expenses I'll have coming. For example, I pay car insurance yearly (saves 10%). I know on october 10th, I need to make an $XXX payment. So I'll categorize that, and as I get closer to the due date I'll pay attention and deposit more. Or, if I have some cash left over after budgeting, I'll toss the leftovers into a category like that.  This works for me because I'm pretty disciplined as it is (financially, in every other way, lolno). This method lets me see where every dollar is going, and what it's job is. Don't know if this helps at all, but It works for me."

personalfinance,3ds67f,DiggingNoMore,2,Sun Jul 19 16:41:14 2015 UTC,"I've found the following low-tech way to work best for my family: Dave Ramsey's envelope system.  In summary, you budget your expenses prior to the start of the month and allocate them into various expenditures: groceries, clothes, entertainment and my favorite, blow. (Not cocaine, but rather money you can blow on whatever the hell you want.)  So say you allocate $500 for groceries, $250 for entertainment, $100 for clothes and $100 for blow. At the start of the month you would take and label four envelopes and stick $500 in the GROCERIES one, $250 in the ENTERTAINMENT one, and so on.  Then, when you want to spend money, you have the cash sitting right there. If there is no money in the envelope, you're going to have to wait till next month.  My favorite things about this system is:   It's a lot easier to stick to the budget when, once an envelope runs dry, you physically can't spend any more. So you can't justify, ""Well, I was only going to spend $250 on entertainment, but screw it, I'm going to spend $350 this month."" (I mean, technically you could, but it's harder/more obvious when you do it.) It can help relieve tension in a relationship / marriage when it comes to spending money. Together you agree on the amounts. Then when you or your spouse spends money it's not like you are wondering, ""Hm, I wonder if that was budgeted for,"" you know it was because otherwise they wouldn't have the cash to make the purchase since the envelope would be empty. If you are a frugal person (like myself), having a blow envelope makes it easy to make silly purchases without feeling guilt or remorse.   The main downside is you lose the convenience and bonuses from spending via credit card. And of course, you can't buy things online with cash. (For that, you can use a credit card and then move the applicable amount from the applicable envelope to a CREDIT CARD PURCHASES envelope to be used when paying off the credit card at the end of the month.) And you also need to keep a non-inconsequential sum of cash in your house, which might not be a good idea if you live with family or  roommates you don't trust, live in an unsafe neighborhood, etc."

This way I can rack up airline miles (since I live in the middle of the pacific and flying is my only option) and boost my credit. Then pay the card off immediately.  Now, I do still have to keep a budget. I have to know what my paycheck is on average per month. Then I factor in all of my bills and include gas as well as food. I need to come in under the average amount by at least a few hundred dollars. This may mean restricting services (cable for example). Then I pay my bills via card and immediately pay the card off as soon as the charges appear online.  Anything that is left over, I split up. 75% to savings/retirement and 25% to luxuries or bill fluctuations. Its imperative to save money.

If yes is the tuition more expensive?   Yes, there is generally an out-of-state tuition fee.   2) If I choose now to go to a community college am I still on time to apply?   Depends on the community college, to be honest. Some allow registration all the way up to when classes start. The big question really is, will you get the classes you want/need if you apply now? For more popular community colleges, that answer will be no, as the classes will have been long filled. Doesn't mean you don't try, but it may mean that the spring semester would be best to start.   3)How can I choose a community college out of all the community collegs in the US? I mean which criterias should I use to select a school?   Depends on your US network and what you want to get out of it. Obviously if you have family/friends you can stay with, then going to a school nearby them, especially if they will let you live with them, will be the most helpful financially and for social support. If you have your eyes on a particular 4 year college, then going to a community college near them may help, as many community colleges will have deals with local universities to funnel their students towards. That would definitely be something to look for in a college. If you are looking at being able to go straight to work after getting your associates degree, then looking for trade or professional types tracks in a community college with strong post-graduation employment rates is a good idea. So is going to a community college near where you would want to employ that trade/be in that profession because the college will most likely have job hunting resources for the local area that you can take advantage of."

personalfinance,3dtf3c,concerned_student_ru,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:33:55 2015 UTC,"Getting control over your spending is a guaranteed way to feel like you got a raise. Once you start to actually budget your money and actually have just a little self discipline you will have extra money.  If you are locked in to a certain income then you need to reconsider what and how you are doing it. You may be locked in to what you have already agreed to, but moving forward you may want to put a cap on the number of hours for a flat fee, or not do a flat fee at all. I worked at an accounting firm that did flat rates, didn't audit themselves for the actual amount of work being put in to clients, and got themselves locked up not able to hire more employees, but not able to make any more money because they were over capacity. Not a way to make a living."
personalfinance,3dtf3c,guyinnova,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:32:52 2015 UTC,"for example, you've agreed on working with clients on a fixed rate and cannot at the moment get any more work due to overloading   The solution to this, in an efficient market, is to increase your rates.  If you charge $50 per hour now, and are getting 60 hours per week of work and turning down more work left and right, then at the end of your contract you negotiate a new one with your clients and your rate has gone up to $60 per hour.  At that point, you might still get 60 hours per week of work, but not be 'turning down' any excess work.  If you raise your rate to $100 per hour, you might lose a bunch of clients and only get 20 hours of work - but if you only want to work 20 hours per week, then 20 hours at $100 per hour is a lot more attractive than 20 hours at $50 per hour.    what else can be done other than searching for other clients who would be willing to pay you more   If you want to earn more, but don't want to charge your clients what your time is worth, then your only remaining option is to work more.    Investing is a good way to prepare for retirement / increase your income.  If you follow the investment advice here, then if I were you I would follow an assumption of 5% returns on your investments (net of inflation, so 7.5% with inflation).  You can also subtract some return for taxes, if your investments are in a taxable account - let's call it 20% tax rate, so 4% returns on taxable accounts.  If you have $100,000 saved up in a tax-exempt account, that's $5,000 per year of additional income - but you can't touch it until retirement.  If you have $100,000 saved up in a taxable account, then that's 'worth' an extra $4,000 per year of income.  Of course, there will be ups and downs in investing - but over the long run, these are reasonable assumptions.   Note that this won't 'increase your income' in the short term, in terms of spendable income.  You should be saving for retirement, and anything that's earmarked as 'for retirement', you should be re-investing the earnings into your retirement account, not spending it.  This is why we need to save ""only"" 15% for retirement (more if you earn a lot, or start saving later in life).  If you have an additional $100k invested on top of what you need for retirement, then you can choose to spend the earnings on that.    What else can we do?   Who is the other half of your 'we'?  It sounds like you work, does your other half work?"
personalfinance,3dtf3c,log-normal,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:29:37 2015 UTC,"""We"" as in ""people"" in this general situation.  I get what you're saying, but finding another person to tutor for such crazy money is hard to find. Especially when there are platforms for finding tutors who change 20$/hour while I charge 45$. It's a result of a long and hard work of building trust and reputation, but I can't find new clients who are willing to pay me my rate.   I have zero savings, I am 23 and I am a freelance interpreter\tutor. I earn about 500-700$/month and spend about 200-300$ of it on my needs. I can't go any lower. Finding a job with this degree will yield me about 750-800$ with zero opportunities to grow. That's why I prefer freelancing."
personalfinance,3dtf3c,log-normal,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:58:32 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I think I might be missing something.  You say you charge $45 / hour.  You say you earn $500 - 700 per month, which is about 11 - 15.5 hours of work per month?  So you work 2.5 - 3.6 hours per week (based on a 4.333 week month)?   Well then, my answer is simple: work more.  If you can keep your $45 / hour clients, and add an additional 35 (!!!!) hours per week of work at $20 / hour, you can easily add another $3,000 per month of income.  If you mean that you earn $500-700 per week, then my answer is the same, except you might only be able to work an additional 25 hours per week at $20 / hour, for an additional $500 per week or $2,150 extra income per month."

You have agreed to work at a fixed rate for a particular service.  You must work on your marketing skills to increase that rate.  Options:     Make plan to increase rates on regular basis.  i.e., announce rate increase on 12/1 or next contract renewal.  Clients don't want to hear your sad story, so research ways of announcing rate renewals with a general excuse they are predisposed to accept.  Research (additional) add-on services you can market to existing clients for additional money. You are ""general"" English tutor?  Will clients need proofreading? special exam prep?  college interview prep?  Remember McDonald's unofficial slogan: Would you like fries with that?  Make sure additional services are priced with an eye to higher income for yourself.  Must stress value to clients that you are already familiar with them, they know how much you've helped in the past, so this new service would be good for them. Research markets for skills you have other than English tutoring/interpreting.  Write a list of 20 skills you have and brainstorm if your current clients might pay to learn what you know apart from the English. Network appropriately. How can you help the people around you so they will think of you when a new $$ project comes around.    Investing depends on having money (capital) that you can afford to lose.  Having capital depends on savings, which is best achieved by making savings a line on your budget, before your rent and food.  It may not be much, but putting $50-$70 ahead of rent and food puts you in an elite class of low-income earners.    There is no easy way to do these suggestions.  It is WORK.  HARD WORK.

Get yourself an appointment with a Dean and talk about how to handle catching up for that first month; Deans are empowered to bend the rules on behalf of exceptional cases.  Talk to the professors who'll be teaching those classes about what preparatory work you can do, and ways to catch up when you start late.  Contact the Study Abroad office, if your university has one, to see how these scheduling issues are usually resolved.  If necessary, find your campus Ombudsman, an administrator whose job is to help students navigate tricky situations like this one.

Lastly, let me tell you that anybody and everybody you have ever known is going to come out of the woodwork with a sob story asking for some ""help"" or people asking to borrow money.  I know it is hard for you to tell a friend or family member ""No"" so I suggest you find someone you REALLY trust and ask them to help you. Let's say this friends name is ""Tom"". Tell anybody who asks for ""help"" or asks to borrow money that ""Tom"" is your financial adviser and the person asking for money will have to get approved by ""Tom"". Then tell ""Tom"" the answer is always ""No"".  I did this for a close relative. Her husband passed away and left a fair amount of assets and a decent life insurance policy. I told her my suggestion is let ME (call me ""Tom"" for the purposes of this post) be the bad guy. So when friends and family asked her for help or for a loan she would say ""Tom is my adviser and you will have to get approved through him"". What we found is MOST were not comfortable asking ME for the money which was a good thing anyway. There was ONE long lost relative that begged and pleaded for me to approve a loan and I just told him in a nice manner I couldn't do that and wasn't in the best interest of the person I was helping.

So saving a few thousand in cash as an emergency fund is not a bad idea, but I'd gues $2k would probably cover your expenses for a good while.  Given that you don't have any 401k available, your best bet for the remaining money is a Roth.  Your income now as an intern who lives at home is likely lower than your desired inflation adjusted retirement income, so paying the taxes now and then withdrawibg tax free makes sense - that means Roth IRA, which you can open through Vanguard.  When your income rises to above your desired retirement income, it will make more sense to defer the taxes to the lower income period, which means Trad IRA, but that's probably not you yet.  Open a Vanguard account and a Roth IRA at Vanguard.  Put your money into a 2060 target date fund, then forget about it for 40 years.

Figure out first of all if that's really realistic for you, and second, how it will compare to the salaried job (how many hours are you expected to work there?) It doesn't sound worth it to me if the alternative is $52k for 40 hours a week. That's a lot of extra time for not nearly enough pay.

personalfinance,3drm79,agreekment,7,Sat Jul 18 20:22:22 2015 UTC,Clerical work is not independent contractor work.  Your workflow is being dictated by your employer.  They tell you when to show up and how to perform your job.    They're making you pay their taxes for them.

This isn't about ethics. You shouldn't have to save anything because you shouldn't have to pay the damned taxes. Your employer should. So, your employer is wrong legally AND they are screwing you out of money.   If you're actually curious how much you should save in taxes, you should fill out an IRS form 1040-ES. You should probably have an LLC so you can protect your assets as a contractor. You should have an EIN (not an SSN) and at least one separate business account that you are using for transacting as a contractor. You should establish your own public business entity, to include a website and business cards. Since you're doing business as a contractor, you will need to carry your own benefits and you'll need to have business insurance.  Are all of those things you want to do? No? Then your boss should classify you correctly as an employee and not as a contractor."
personalfinance,3drm79,legotri,-4,Sat Jul 18 20:59:47 2015 UTC,The employer can't pay taxes! You pay taxes. Taxes come out of your paycheck. OP has to save money because those taxes aren't being automatically deducted.

personalfinance,3dsm8r,agressiv,2,Sun Jul 19 01:43:25 2015 UTC,"Loan Officer her, in California.   I've read that there are no ""loan-level price adjustments"" with 15 year loans. What does that exactly mean? Just a fee at closing?   There is no FICO/LTV adjustment for 15 year. The other LLPAs still apply. But I wouldn't stress about this -- you can choose for this to be a one-time thing, rather than take a higher interest rate. FYI everyone asking ""what's the rate?"" is asking the wrong question. You can always have any interest rate appearing on a rate sheet. It's simply a matter of the price paid (or rebate taken) for said interest rate. LLPAs change the price, holding steady a given interest rate.   I've see a few who say, ""do a 30, and invest the difference"" Thoughts on this? How diligent would I have to be?   15 year fixed has a P&I payment about 50% higher, but you build equity over twice as fast making minimum required P&I payments. I don't think most of the 'invest the difference' school really think that through.  If you can comfortably afford the 15 year option, it's a better deal in every way."
personalfinance,3dsm8r,aardy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:33:00 2015 UTC,Comparing a 15-year and 30-year loan: *Percentages in the table below are a percentage of the original loan value    * 15-year 30-year Paid off in 15 Years    Interest Rate Used 3.25% 4.25%   Monthly Payment 0.702% 0.752% (option to pay 0.492%)   Interest Paid over the course of 15 years 26.5% 35.4%    So you'll end up paying ~9% of the loan value in exchange for the flexibility of being able to make lower monthly payments. You'll have to decide whether that's worth it to you.
personalfinance,3dsm8r,cjg_000,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:28:47 2015 UTC,"the benefit of the longer term is that in the event of an emergency you have a lower obligation of payment for the roof over your head. Shop around a bit, you may find a 20 or 25 year term that gives you more protection against emergencies and still some benefit in terms of interest rate savings.   I don't understand what you mean by ""loan level price adjustments"" - perhaps that's a specific marketing term used by your lender."
personalfinance,3dsm8r,ejly,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:26:16 2015 UTC,"It comes down to weighing two pros/cons:   Interest rate difference. If you invest the difference in payments, can you make more than that in the market? Quite possibly, but would you actually do it, or would that extra money get spent on something else? Flexibility. If your income situation is potentially unstable, a 30 year gives you a lot more breathing room in the event something bad happens, but you're paying for that in the interest.   Nobody can tell you which one to do, it really depends on you."
personalfinance,3dsm8r,tubaleiter,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:54:48 2015 UTC,"I just went through the 15 vs. 30 year thing.   For me, I wanted to build equity in our house so that in a couple years we could move to another (larger) home if we wanted to.   Doing the 15 year accomplishes this goal because the rate is lower, and also the interest you pay each month is lower. So as a general example, based on a $1,500/month payment:  30 year fixed: $1,000 interest, $500 principal 15 year fixed: $500 interest, $1,000 principal  So over the course of a couple of years, the amount going to principal is significantly higher.   The other reason I chose the 15 year is because my personality is unable to comprehend 30 years from now what will be happening in life. Sure, we can make certain assumptions, but in reality it's most likely that we'll be refinancing again, moving, or selling for whatever reason before 30 years comes.   So since I could afford the small difference between the two payments (for me, approx $150 additional /mo for the 15 year) I went with 15 year.   There is a lot of other things to consider, but I think that the main thing is what is your goal? The long term flexibility with lower payments and hope inflation makes your house payment cheap in the future? Or build equity for shorter term goals?   Another thing for me was that while I would like to buy a bigger house, I would also like to rent the one we are in out. So that means that I need a lot of cash to put down on the new house. By paying down equity faster on my current mortgage, I could later refinance, cash out some equity to help with the down payment and then at that point if I go with a 30 year fixed, my mortgage payment will be even lower on the rental property!"

personalfinance,3dsm8r,arcticphoenix81,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:32:09 2015 UTC,"The math does not agree with your mother.  15 year mortgages have lower interest rates than 30 year mortgages.  To pay off a 30 year mortgage in 15 years, your monthly payment would be higher than if you just got the 15 year loan.  If you make the same monthly payment on both it will probably take around 20 years to pay off a 30 year loan.  It can still be smart to get a 30 year mortgage and pay extra, depending on your situation.  Taking a 30 year loan gives you the flexibility to pay less if you have an unexpected emergency.  But the flexibility is likely to cost you quit a few dollars over 15 years.    If you have a stable job, a solid emergency fund, and enough room in your budget then either get a 15 year mortgage or get a 30 year and put the difference towards investing for retirement depending on your risk tolerance."

Here is my take, keep the $3500 in savings (or even move some to the CC debt depending on your situation and risk aversion) as an emergency fund as well as leaving the CD alone only touching it in an emergency that depletes other sources.  Divert the extra $500 to the credit card so the total is now 1.3k/month to CC. This pays off the CC in 6 months with total interest paid at $185. Over that six months you make $120 on the CD."

CD has 2 years left but principle is capped at 5k so can't put more into except for the interest.  Expenses are ~650$ a month including food.

That's a lot of help, and the government would definitely see it that way!  Scholarships are a crapshoot, but definitely try. Talk to the financial aid office at your college. Working part time during the school year will definitely help, even at part time.

So here's what I've learned so far:  As I understand things, you need to make clear to the company that you wish to open an ""Inherited IRA account."" This account must be named ""[Aunt's Name] IRA (Deceased [date]) for the benefit of [Wife's Name]""  Once this account is opened (and it can be with another institution if you so desire, but for simplicity we'll assume you're opening it with the same institution) you must request that the company makes a Trustee-to-Trustee transfer from her aunt's account to the newly opened account.  This is very important. Should the money reach your hands at any time (say by being sent a check), even if it's deposited in the new account immediately, you will have triggered a taxable event on 100% of the IRA. The institution must make the Trustee-to-Trustee between the accounts.  You already know about the RMDs, so I'll leave it at that.

personalfinance,3drbxi,up2myears,4,Sun Jul 19 15:59:34 2015 UTC,"First, definitely get your credit report and figure out what derogatory info is on there.  Second, it's very possible that you've been a victim of identity theft. This doesn't mean that the security breach is responsible -- in fact, it's very unlikely if there hasn't been any weird activity on your bank accounts. It's far more likely that a parent or other adult opened credit accounts in your name when you were still a minor (and you wouldn't be liable for these debts, btw) or that you're being confused with someone who has a similar name."

Try explaining that to a financial institution while attempting to get it resolved through the proper channels. It took about 3 years to get it all sorted out, no thanks whatsoever to Social Security, who constantly pointed me in multiple directions at once and then rejected everything I did when I didn't go in conflicting directions, then rejected me when I did. I'm told it should have taken 6 months, tops."

personalfinance,3dsf4f,WeAreAnIdiocracy,0,Sun Jul 19 01:38:56 2015 UTC,"Check your documents. I'm fairly sure you must be the owner of record at the time the LTV is reduced to <80% to be eligible for unearned UFMIP refunds.... but then,  you may be right too. Let me know."
personalfinance,3dsf4f,WeAreAnIdiocracy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:45:54 2015 UTC,"Well, that's part of the problem too. I don't have any docs that detail pmi cancellation other than generic government docs that notify me I have a right to cancellation once LTV reached 80%.  It seems like if paying the loan in full doesn't qualify for ""reaching 80%"" they would explicitly call the that out.  It's frustrating because I was very confident selling and paying the loan in full would count. It's been quite a shock learning what some infer from that 80% statement."

Am I supposed to have anything that details what should happen if I sell the home, regarding PMI?  I have nothing that discusses selling and nothing that even addresses single premium PMI. It's simply a line on my fees worksheets, that's it.  I've been provided very little and all I have makes it sound as if selling the home would remove my PMI liability - presumably entitling me to a refund of pro-rated funds since my upfront payment was to cover my ""insurance"" until the LTV was scheduled to reach 80% in 2020-2025 or whatever it was."

Thus it grows tax free for your entire life, and when you need the money when you're approaching or in retirement, you can take it out without tax consequences."

personalfinance,3dsdsk,brainchasm,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:30:04 2015 UTC,"So both IRAs and 401Ks are investment tools to give tax advantages for money saved for retirement. The government doesn't want you to be destitute when you're too old to work. These accounts are not mutually exclusive, but you fund them differently.   401k is deducted from your pay check, while with an IRA the contribution is directly from your personal checking/savings.  Many 401k plans have a match, which is effectively free money, and that is a big selling point. Unfortunately this 401k does not have a match. So all of the posts here, including my own, will suggest the IRA is better because of various advantages it has in costs, options and flexibility.   Roth = Pay tax now, Don't pay tax later  Traditional = Tax break now, Pay tax later  But if you have so little income you don't pay tax anyway, Roth is unquestionably better."

First off if you do not have any open credit accounts you need to. Get a secured credit card. Make sure the one you choose reports to at least one of the credit bureaus. Most should, but be certain. Be sure to use it monthly. A good example would be if you spend $150 a week on groceries, have the $150 in your bank account, check out with the secured credit card at the store, then when it posts to your credit card pay it off. Consider buying something - anything - on credit. With credit like yours a car is your best bet. Your interest rate will suck but that's something you're going to be dealing with for a while. The car loan I got when I was neck deep in it was a terrible rate. But that regular monthly payment helped. I suggest working with your own bank if possible. They can help you with a plan on when you can refinance it for a better rate. Sort of a staged plan to keep getting a better rate as your credit improves. If you have a mortgage thank your lucky stars. If not, consider purchasing rather than renting as soon as your credit allows (generally speaking most lenders want to see scores no lower than 620 to 680, but some will consider a 600). This is a good monthly report on your credit rating.   It seems like it will take forever. But even with a few hiccups along the way I've almost doubled my credit score in 3 years. It can be done."
personalfinance,3dsbj2,9ifbydarkness,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:16:01 2015 UTC,"OP, please don't take out a car loan to build credit.   First, you'll get a terrible interest rate, and in order to refinance in a year or so, you'll have to put a huge down payment (~25%) or make more than the minimum payment monthly just to catch up with depreciation.  Are the payment plus insurance costs worth it, that money could go towards paying off your student loans for instance.   And lastly, the impact to your credit score is minimal. You already have some accounts with positive history, which have been accumulating for years. Another secured loan isn't going to resurrect your credit.  Get a secured card and use it, pay it off every month and wait. After 6-12 months you can ask for it to be upgraded to unsecured. Or apply for another card. Never carry a balance and don't spend money you don't have."
personalfinance,3dsbj2,CommondeNominator,2,Sun Jul 19 09:47:12 2015 UTC,"Get a credit card. Preferably, via local credit union - big banks gonna charge you annual fee on top of security deposit, and some credit union may be able to give you unsecured cc immediately. Keep utilization under 25%. Means, by the cut-off time when bank generates the statement, you have to have balance in it between 5-25% of your credit limit. Pay on time, every time. Meticulously. The whole point is to have ideal history. Piggy back someone with good credit limit - parents, spouse, etc. Have them issue authorized credit card on your name. If they don't trust you financially, they can keep the card, just so your name will be active with their bank. This carries less weight to your credit history, but raises your credit limit thus lowering utilization. Still spend cash. Your credit card usage has only point of fixing credit, not to hook you up with more money till next month. This luxury will come later.   Good luck."

personalfinance,3dsb80,GeneralZex,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:32:17 2015 UTC,This. Paying off the debt is also investing because you're effectively paying yourself that interest rate.

Otherwise I think your time table is too short to make investments."
personalfinance,3dsaul,pho1701,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:38:12 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on your fellowship! I would save it for law school--maybe pay off the car loan if it's not a great rate. 2 years is a relatively short time frame to try to invest. Wouldn't it be nice to pay cash for your first year of school and not have to worry about accrued interest until 2L year? The federal loans you can take out will probably be over 6% and the interest will really pile up during law school. I don't think you are wrong to anticipate scholarships but better safe than sorry.   Also a little tip--you may get advice to sock some money away in a Roth IRA. Be careful about that! Roths are only available to people with earned income, and many fellowships are reported as unearned income."

Your point of paying all of L1 without loans is something I've thought about a lot. But on the other hand the money I'll accrue over the next few years is quite sizable as well.   As a stem major I haven't gotten exposure to finance, but I'd like to be able to do some kind of calculation to see which option will be the best, financially, in the long run.

Social status is expressed with otherwise meaningless symbols of wealth, and common sense is drowned out in the plethora of pictures and videos of handsome men driving around with supermodels in sports cars. The average human being doesn't have the mental energy to filter out all the bullshit. In the midst of dealing with the stresses of every day life, we're more likely to seek refuge in the bullshit. That vision of a comfortable life of excess, the American Dream, carefully planted in our brains by media conglomerates.   What's worse is that our economy is built on the rampant consumption that is stimulated by this message. Replace all the bullshit with common sense, and consumer spending goes down. Revenue goes down. Stock indices go down. Jobs are lost, creating a positive feedback loop of downward pressure on the economy.   The whole thing is absurd."

More than average savings than most people my age.  I do all this because I'm sacrificing this consumption to pay cash for other things we enjoy - and to pay for life in the future.  I endure a bizarre form of social shaming for my choices:  ""he's cheap.""  I have a first-hand look at lots of people's personal financial choices - most are consuming far beyond their means - many people routinely buy cars with prices far in excess of their annual income.  And I have to constantly battle the growing suspicion that I am the sucker - because of the overwhelming number of people that will have nothing when they actually need it - and the government will - by force of vote or otherwise - simply step in to provide it all at the expense of anyone who prepared themselves.  I suspect strongly its a game that can't be won.  Whatever I have saved up - the math simply tells me it has to be multiples of what it is now to really pay for a retirement.  Everyone here has a Harley or a Vette or a boat or a cabin or more likely all of it!

My parents had a fucking caravan. Every school holiday we fucked off in that caravan. I saw the whole of Britain by the time I was 13.   My parents are (semi) retired now, 5 years early. They have no mortgage, a newer caravan, a new car. The house they now own is in the woods 20 minutes drive from the town. It's massive with massive grounds, and they say it's mine, all mine, when they kick the bucket.   My dad works part time, teaching First Aid, commanding large sums of money for little work for big businesses. He was a Fire Fighter so this isn't really even work to him. My Mum is doing the house up, and it's already awesome.   I on the other hand, have a family. I rent my house. My parents bought me a family car. They are helping with the deposit when we get a mortgage. We both work. We have aspirations.   When my eldest starts school this year we would be struggling for childcare in the holidays, except my parents have already said to send him down to them. They are already talking about booking holidays touring in the caravan and taking him with them. He will absolutely love it.   What I'm trying to say is, my parents didn't buy it to the capitalist dream, they saved, scrimped. Now, when it actually matters, they are able to help, and they enjoy it. It makes them happy. They get to hang out with the grandkids when they have the time to enjoy it, and see them happy.   I'm trying to emulate them. I see the people I went to school with, with no job, rugrats all over the place, still in social housing and relying on benefits. Sure, their kids have Adidas shoes, but they have no inheritance, no discipline, no aspirations and no real chance. It's a a cycle. My parents got out of that cycle and passed that on to me."

They honestly have no idea what to do with the money. You also get these stories about agents and financial advisers screwing players.

And take the time to educate your children and/or grandchildren on financial matters.  I don't know why it's such a taboo to talk about money within a family, but that causes so much long term harm that it's worth a little discomfort.

(maybe shorten that one just to the first bit for simplicity, since kids are pretty good at figuring out exceptions to rules)  Maybe specific investment advice wouldn't really apply (my dad would tell me to invest everything in whole life, because that saw him through the dotcom bust while his friends lost their poorly managed speculative stock-based retirement funds), but that doesn't mean advice is useless.  And finally, I'm not necessarily talking to 50-60 year olds with grown adult children.  I'm also talking to the 20- and 30-year olds with young children or teenagers.  We don't know what the financial world will look like a decade or two from now, but we do know what it looks like now and that advice can be passed on.  Anything helps.  In fact, the only thing that doesn't help is not trying because you think the info's not relevant."
personalfinance,3dl6iq,boxsterguy,4,Fri Jul 17 14:43:53 2015 UTC,I'm not even sure what's good advice anymore. Government money printing has ensured that savings get almost zero interest and that the stock market is in a bubble.
personalfinance,3dl6iq,Richy_T,3,Fri Jul 17 14:49:48 2015 UTC,"So align your interests with those who are running the country, and invest in stocks. If we pull a Greece, everyone is screwed anyway. If the ""bubble"" takes 50 or more years to pop, then you've lived a nice life. That's what I don't get about for instance the goldbugs. They know that a bunch of elite finance guys are centrally planning the economy, propping up the stock market and destroying the value of savings through money printing, all the while risking their personal assets in the stock market...and they want to bet opposite these guys?"

The only direct financial help they've given me were purchasing me a cheap car when I was 16 (with the caveat I had to get a job to pay for gas and insurance), and my housing for my first year of college. Now I'm 25 with no debt at all aside from my house and a small car loan, $20K in my retirement account, and a 3 month emergency fund (which I am now expanding).

This rule have saved me so much money in the last year alone. During this time I think that I've spent maybe $200 on things I don't really need but all of them were on huge sales and because of my background I've never had the chance to rip off the tag off of something nice before.

Many wealthy people don't ""rip the tag off"" nice things because they are foolish purchases and, conversely, many who are very poor do realize this experience because they're more self-conscious about projecting an image of wealth.  There's nothing wrong with splurging on something enjoyable once in a while, but many people who make more money than their parents seems to feel that they ""owe"" themselves certain luxuries, which justifies bad decisions."

The problem is that nowadays, everyone seems to think that they deserve to live a middle- to upper-middle class lifestyle, regardless of their current financial situation. People earning $35,000 per year with $5,000 of credit card debt and $40,000 of student loan debt still NEED an awesome 1080p LED TV, latest smartphone, high end laptop, new car (financed, of course), restaurant meals at least 1-2 times every week, vacation once or twice a year, etc."

personalfinance,3dl6iq,czechm8e,61,Fri Jul 17 18:45:52 2015 UTC,"A lot of credit cards give you incentives for using them, like cash back or discounts.  They can be a good deal if you make sure to pay them in full before interest starts to collect on them."
personalfinance,3dl6iq,KuanX,22,Fri Jul 17 12:54:10 2015 UTC,"Correct.  I have two kids, a wife and a mortgage. I also have a shared credit card between my wife and I. This credit card accumulates 1.5 points per dollar spent, and because I signed up with their energy provider (who has similar rates as other energy providers) I get 6 points per dollar on my Electricity bill.  My mortgage has an offset account to reduce the balance owing on my mortgage and thus reduce the interest. My wage and my wife's wage go directly into the offset account. Every month when the interest is due on the mortgage it deducts itself from the offset account.  All our expenditure goes onto the credit card. School fees, bottle of milk, clothes, medical, fuel, everything we can. The only exception is the repayments on the car loan (banks don't like you paying back a loan with another loan). The credit card has 45 days interest free (1.5 months effectively). At the end of the month the credit card bill comes in. Halfway into the next month it is due, and I pay it in full from the offset account.  This minimises the interest both on the credit card (as we pay it off before we accumulate interest) and the mortgage (as all of our savings is offsetting the mortgage amount for as long as possible).  The added benefit is the reward points we get. We can use these to purchase goods (it is through a major airline in our country), purchase flights, upgrade flights. We can trade them in for Gift Vouchers, stay at hotels. Quite a few options.  I have used points to fly domestically business class several times without a single cent out of my pocket, which has theoretically covered the annual fee on the credit card multiple times over. When I travel business class, I get access to the airport lounge for that airline, which means I get access to their food and drink bar. If I fly down Friday night - dinner on the plane in Business class for free. Stay Saturday for my event, fly back Saturday night - afternoon in the lounge chilling with a beer, snacks, and free Wifi, and then free dinner on the plane home. Completely worth it."

personalfinance,3dl6iq,Podunk14,9,Fri Jul 17 14:27:52 2015 UTC,"However, if it didn't make the credit cards money, they wouldn't do it.

(The majority of their business was with the big three auto manufacturers in the usa.) My first job was for $0/hr - just straight comission. I barely made enough to feed myself. I had to be frugal to survive.  Fast forward ... when I finally got a real job, I bought a house near the bottom of the market. I put a lot of money into 401k and stocks while the market made a slow comeback. Never bought a new anything. Drove my old truck to almost 300k miles.  Most of my friends who got done with college early or didnt go and landed good paying construction jobs are hurting now. They're upside down on car loans and foreclosed their homes. Sometimes it's the luck of the draw...."
personalfinance,3dl6iq,PmMeYourLabiaMajora,5,Fri Jul 17 10:58:33 2015 UTC,"I think we had similar luck with timing and how it lead to certain decisions. I graduated in 2007, but landed an entry-level position in my field a year before things got bad. I held on to that job through the recession, though it was very low pay, they provided excellent benefits and funded my graduate education.   Fast forward, I've switched jobs a few time, each time into a position of greater responsibility and pay. I own my house, also bought when the market bottomed out, and am putting 15% away into retirement. We own both of our cars, nothing fancy, and have our first child on the way.  I, and later after I met my wife, we, have been very careful and strategic with each financial decision we have made. We live well within our means and any time we've come into extra money (bonus, cashing out vacation when switching jobs -- I've left one with as many as 31 days accumulated, and never with less than two weeks to cash out), so obviously we don't take extravagant vacations, we've used it to pay off short term debt, or build up a nest egg/emergency fund.   However, despite how thoughtful we have been about every decision we've made, I think our circumstances are still based on timing and luck. My first boss, who had been around for a long time once told me that I was going to be incredibly lucky because of when the recession hit. My job was safe, and when things settled, I'd be able to get a house cheap... he said once you get the ball rolling with that, and so long as you aren't stupid with your money you'll do well in the long run. It was capitalizing on an opportunity. I got to continue building my resume while others didn't. While my friends just a year or two younger were working as baristas and bar tenders because they couldn't find a professional gig, I was gaining experience and working forward a graduate degree.  Long story short -- opportunity is what you make of it. You can't wait around excepting it to fall into your lap; but when it does you have to be thoughtful and have patience."

So I got into running the heavy equipment in the pits. After getting a feel out there, I joined the health and safety committee.   After becoming the safety rep for all the workers, I realized safety is a field that isn't going away anytime soon. (atleast until the robots come)   So I went to school and got a diploma in health and safety management. Plus I took any course my company would offer.   After 5 years of learning about mining, and enrolling in every course possible, I was offered a job at a new mine opening up from scratch.   I spent 3 years building an entire program from the ground up, and got to take even more courses to add to my credentials.   Unfortunately they went bankrupt and I was out of a job.   Because I was stupid with my money, I went broke pretty fast. I lost my job I'm January, and filed a consumer proposal mid March after all my savings were gone. (I did this strategically... Which is a whole other story)   After I wiped my debt, I was able to take a low paying job until I could land something better.   In June I was offered the opportunity of a life time.

Also, a lot of people are stuck in the ""I'm not getting paid to give a shit about any of that."" mindset and believe that they're stuck doing what they're doing no matter what, while not being aware that management is struggling to find people who can actually do the jobs you ended up doing. The jobs that require a good understanding of everything that's going on while providing a means to climb the ladder.  It's great to hear that your hard work and dedication paid off and I hope you're enjoying your current job and its benefits.

Even if you want to retire at 55 years old, you can still have 20 solid working years from 35-55 where you can build up a great retirement plan. That's fucking retiring at only 55 years old. It doesn't mean purposely fuck up your life, but calm the fuck down 29 year olds."

When do you have enough saved up that you can have a little fun? I mean, I understand saving is important and you never truly know your future, but what good is living a boring life with ton of money in your savings account? I guess this is really a personal question since that number and balance will be different for everyone."
personalfinance,3dl6iq,canikony,43,Fri Jul 17 14:36:14 2015 UTC,"I think the problem that most of these posts are conveying is that an abrupt influx of money can give the recipient the -perception- that they have a lot of money, without any kind of cash flow to back it up. It's about developing a money spending habit, becoming frivolous beyond your means in a short period of time, often spanning beyond what that initial windfall offered. Once you've got a habit, even something like spending money, it can be very, very hard to break. Even the wisest of us are prone to those little pitfalls, and when you're suddenly handed a giant chunk of cash it makes you feel invincible- and that's the danger in it."
personalfinance,3dl6iq,AnabellefromPoulsbo,29,Fri Jul 17 15:25:47 2015 UTC,"Precisely. I was cheap, frugal, before I had all this cash.

Perhaps this wasn't the best place to post my question since it's unrelated to OP's post. My question is more general... Finding the life balance of buying things while still saving. Is your ultimate goal to die with as much money as you can?"
personalfinance,3dl6iq,AnabellefromPoulsbo,19,Fri Jul 17 14:26:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly that's just up to everyone. Whenever I see posts in personal finance, I imagine a dull grey life of boring monotony just putting money away until I die at 45 in a tragic car accident with a bunch of money saved up that I never got to spend. That's the life I imagine when they talk about how much to save/invest/put away- so I get you. Personally, I found that living within my means wasn't hard while also 'spoiling' myself with small and sometimes large indulgences; it's a balance for me. I wouldn't want to live that dull grey life, and I don't. I also know life is unexpected, and shit happens; I'd hate to die tomorrow having only ever saved everything I ever made. But that's my choice, and I'll have to live with those consequences, so I guess it boils down to how much you fear the future."
personalfinance,3dl6iq,MrLlamaSC,15,Fri Jul 17 07:19:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly the big thing for me was really realizing money != happiness. I can name some of my favorite memories and none of them really involved a crazy expensive dinner or a huge gift or anything like that; they were just simple memories like painting a giant 6x9 ""The Starry Night"" with my SO (total cost maybe $60 for all supplies), playing tennis with beat up rackets with my buddy, sitting in a river looking up at a mountain, etc. Things that really didn't just cost a lot of money. Many people picture saving money early as living a grey life, but it's simply not that at all. Learning to be happy with less and to find joy in things beyond material goods I believe actually makes me happier than most people. One of my favorite examples is when my friend lost his $2k watch and he was super stressed out and so unhappy until we found it. I lost my $10 watch last month, and it hasn't had any affect on me at all.    It's just little things like that where taking money out of your life can take stress out of your life and then at that point you can realize how worthless money actually is. So at this point, money = freedom which is the only reason I'm earning it until I no longer need to do so and then I'll go enjoy all the extra time I have to be happy.    NOTE: I'd like to note that obviously some spending works out well. I spend a lot of time streaming and my computer was too old to stream well so I upgraded it. This was to enhance my experience as well as my viewers' experience. There are certain places that spending money will be extremely helpful, find those places and try to avoid the other ones (like a new $2K watch or pair of Lebrons or anything like that is just not important enough to me to ever buy)."
personalfinance,3dl6iq,nogreatcathedral,4,Fri Jul 17 07:38:24 2015 UTC,"For me, the ultimate goal is to balance my family's happiness across my lifespan. Being painfully frugal in my twenties so that I can die with millions doesn't make sense, from that perspective.   The stuff that worries me is habits. For example, my work clothing situation has been making me miserable lately, so my husband talked me into taking some of the money that's budgeted for our house down payment (in probably 3 years) to buy a few new things. It was hard for me to do not because I think those few hundred dollars are going to cost us in the long run, but because I worry that we could keep using those kind of excuses and end up nowhere. At least right now we're making excuses with our own money, not credit cards, but mentally it can be tricky to know when it's okay and when it's a sign your spending is getting in the way of your priorities, so I sympathize."

personalfinance,3dl6iq,tqhp1,8,Fri Jul 17 15:02:26 2015 UTC,"I am going through that right now exactly.  It's gotten to the point where every little purchase I calculate how much that money would be worth at retirement if I invested it.  e.g. I need a new car or to throw money at mine (slipping clutch, leaking exhaust and new struts).  I am relatively well off not having kids and such, but I cant seem to bring myself to buy something.  It's like I'm paralyzed.  Every car I like I always find myself questioning the price.  One half of me wants the cheapest car to own like a honda fit or something.  But the other half hates the idea of spending any money on something so boring haha."
personalfinance,3dl6iq,sfo2,15,Fri Jul 17 07:55:36 2015 UTC,"A couple questions for you:   What's your time worth?  I know a well-off guy who spent 3 hours on the internet trying to find a deal on a rental car to save $30.  At some point of miserliness you transition into an uninteresting cheapass with no hobbies. Why do you work?  Your income needs to go to a mix of saving and enjoying yourself right now.  If your job is simply a means to provide for you in retirement, that means your job is what is standing in the way between you and the life you want.  Pretty shitty way to spend 50 hours a week. For me, money spent on hobbies is generally money well spent (to a point) because it is providing some utility to me.  If all you can think to do with your money is buy a fancy car, get a hobby.   For my wife and I, the key is to keep our eyes open about expenditures.  Every purchase has a purpose, and we discuss it beforehand.  We have one small cheap car for commuting (though pretty new and reliable - after I had a 10 year old car break down on me in the dead of winter, that was it for junkers), and one big SUV we bought used for driving to the mountains - the SUV supports backpacking, mountain biking, road tripping, and other outdoor hobbies we do often.  We like our jobs because they allow us to live a lifestyle where we can both save and do fun stuff at the same time.  Every month we pay ourselves first (401k, other savings contribution), and then we live our lives.  Anyway sorry to be preachy.  It sounds like you don't need the typical personalfinance lecture about not getting yourself into debt.  You've done a good job and now you can live your life, so go do it."
personalfinance,3dl6iq,SonterLord,3,Fri Jul 17 08:17:38 2015 UTC,"Every purchase has a purpose...   Sounds like a good rule of thumb. Does it have a purpose? Then consider buying.  Kindof boring example but I play airsoft, and was recommended expensive pants by 5.11. Theyre like 75 bucks a pair but I ended up also using them as work pants (I work outside). That's how I justified the large purchase as they are not only useful in my pasttime but for work aswell  Sidenote: check out 5.11 these pants are amazing."

personalfinance,3dl6iq,aargo1,3,Fri Jul 17 14:37:40 2015 UTC,"For me, cover the essentials first, then it's all about how you spend on big purchases, whether than if you should.  For example, when we want something big, we will set an amount of money aside each month to reach that specific goal. We set a long-term and short-term savings goal. The short-term savings can never take out of the long-term savings.  Once you've actively saved up enough for your item, go buy it! We've been able to buy lots of big purchases this way even though we are a single-income household.  Hope this helps."

There are two extremes in this situation and unfortunately, you found yourself on the end of one of them.   I think balance is the most important thing here. People shouldn't be afraid to spend some of their money when wealth comes there way. For example, if you are guaranteed 140k and are passionate about cars, what's wrong with spending a portion to make yourself happy? Going and buying a 120k car would be utterly stupid of course. But spending a percentage of that inheritance with the knowledge that the portion of it you do save will one day bring you returns, I see no issue with enjoying some of your good fortune while you are young.   It's all about balance. I get the impression from your post that you began to spend that money to try and impress other people, and that is why you fell into a pit, financially speaking.

personalfinance,3dl6iq,lovejamie,4,Fri Jul 17 13:36:04 2015 UTC,"A good way to think about this is ""the rule of 72"" which is a really rough way to figure out how long it takes for money to double based on the rate of return. For example, if your money could grow at 10%, it would take about 7 years for the money to double (72 / 10 = 7.2). So if you were 20 with $1000, at 27 = $2000, at 34 = $4K, 41 = $8K, 48 = $16K, 55 = $32K, 62 = $64K, 69 = $128K. If you were able to get 7%, it would take about 10 years to double (72 / 7 = 10ish)... 20 with $1000, at 30 = $2000, at 40 = $4K, 50 = $8K, 70 = $16K. So you can see what a 1% difference makes over the long run, so that's why people are so focused on reducing investment expenses since that's within one's control vs investment returns."

I was already depressed and I was estranged from my dad to begin with and all of that just brought stress with having to deal with people on that side of the family that I don't particularly like and I just wanted to be left alone and gambling was my vice.   There's something about getting money that you didn't earn that will fuck you up.  All the money was gone by 8 months and I would continually be -$1000 in my bank account due to always over drafting to feed my gambling addiction. I was basically working just to get back to zero each paycheck and that went on for an extra 2 years after I got the money. I just kept digging myself in holes, making myself depressed and wanting to escape and my escape was gambling and that was also my biggest problem.

Also, had a pre-existing $5,000 car loan (was almost paid off, until I was unemployed [and depressed] for 5 months in 2014). Also, At 19 I decided I wanted a brand new Toyota GT86, and entered in to a $34,000 car loan at $150 per week (still surprises me that I was approved with $1200 fortnight wage).  I am earning enough to meet minimum payments, but I do feel like I'm merely treading water. I am waiting to start a new job in IT, with which I should earn considerably more, and be able to pay off my debt.  I always told myself as I child that I'd never have a credit card...

personalfinance,3drkr4,MeLlamoJason,4,Sat Jul 18 19:49:13 2015 UTC,"If I fail to pay the full $400 within that pay period I get charged the 29.4% variable apr interest, which then amounts to around $520?   APR stands for annual percentage rate, so to calculate interest for just one month, you need to divide by 12 since there are 12 months in a year. So, 29.4% divided by 12 is 2.45%, so if you paid off none of the $400 the first month (which would result in a late payment fee, by the way -- you must make the required minimum payment each month to avoid that fee), you'd owe $409.80 on the next bill.  I know that doesn't sound like much, but a 29.4% APR is considered fairly expensive debt, and paying any interest on something that makes you poorer (entertainment and consumer goods, etc.) instead of richer (a practical education, a cheap car to get to work, etc.) is generally considered a bad financial move. I can't tell you what to do with your money, and as a fellow gamer, I feel for you on how bad you must want that new system, but my advise to you is to never put yourself in a situation where you're paying interest on a credit card unless it's a true emergency and you can't borrow the money cheaper from anywhere else.  The value of credit cards is in their convenience, security, credit history/score building, and (once you qualify for a better card) rewards -- not in borrowing money.   Also what should I use my credit card on once I have it and what shouldn't I use it on? Food, gas, clothes, etc...?   You can use it on anything, just don't let that freedom tempt you into increasing your spending or going into debt. Buying more or less will have no impact on your credit score, so don't feel that you have spend a lot to help your credit. Just keeping the card open and paying your bills on time is all you need to do."

I hate the idea of having to borrow money to pay for something but that's essentially what a credit card does right?  I could easily pay for it with cash I have but if I want to start building my credit I have to start somewhere.  I know it is not smart to spend money on impractical things but It's a reward for myself.  I do already have a car (parents paid for it) and my employer is paying for my college tuition so I don't have any debt or any living expenses that I cannot already afford.

Yes, and there's nothing wrong with borrowing money for free by paying it all back on the due date. That's actually better than using cash in several ways.  I was just saying that paying interest on something that's not an investment is technically against your benefit. Since you have a job, own your car outright, and have your employer paying for tuition, it sounds like you're doing quite well and are certainly allowed to treat yourself, but I would recommend doing that by having the cash to pay off the full credit card bill first. Carrying a balance and paying interest does not help your credit score and may actually temporarily harm it by increasing your utilization ratio. Here's the list of everything that determines your score if you want to read more.  Sorry if any of that comes off as preachy. I'm just trying to be sure that you don't become part of the scary credit card statistics, but it does sounds like you're approaching this with a good level of caution. Best of luck out there!"

At your age and probably limited income, I'd suggest using it as infrequently as possible. I got a credit card at 18 and through college basically put my books each semester on the card and little else. The only time I racked some money on it was the last month I was studying abroad and a little tight on cash, so I put stuff on my card, which I then immediately paid off the next month.   Just don't carry a balance month to month and you'll be fine. If you think you can control your spending with it as your daily driver, go for it. If not, I'd use it sparingly."

personalfinance,3ds93q,nonchalantlarch,3,Sat Jul 18 23:31:55 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what interest rate your loan would be at.  Talk to your bank and find out what they would make available to you for a used car loan so you can have something preapproved before you go in, but remember, the most important number is the total price of the car, get that low and don't let them convince you to get more car than you want.  The first time you go in, plan on leaving without purchasing anything, it will allow you to make more rational choices than deciding while talking to the sales man.  If your bank offers you a 1-3% loan for a used car thats great, since you can then put your cash to better use.  Capital One 360 says ""used car loans as low as 1.99%"", since their 5 year CD is at 2.25% it'd be dumb to pay in cash instead of taking the loan and dropping the money into the CD.  Even up to 3% you can safely expect better returns in the market so its a good idea to make use of the leverage available to you."

I don't think consolidation loans will help you. Your parents can't meet their bills as it is and a consolidation loan is more about convenience with a potential benefit of a lower rate, thus a smaller payment. However, with bad credit I doubt your parents can get a loan with a rate that would be helpful.   My advice is to find out all the expenses and incomes. From that, make a budget. Find out where your family can cut back. If you go to restaurants or order out, for a family if your size it would be at least $100 a meal, I bet. Whatever it is, nothing will happen without knowing what's coming in and what's going out."

personalfinance,3dqlzg,Pinewood74,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:46:37 2015 UTC,"There is one extra piece of advice that needs to be added to this; DO NOT under any circumstances sell your new car with a loan still outstanding on it. You must pay for it, all off it, before buying another new vehicle. The dealer will tell you that its no big deal and they'll just roll the leftover amount of the loan onto the new vehicle but you must not do this. If you take a 5 year loan then you're driving that thing for five years. Do not become one of those people who rolls into a dealership in four years because they're bored of their car and want a new one. This is the fastest way to get into trouble."
personalfinance,3dqlzg,DerMuller,2,Sun Jul 19 03:22:09 2015 UTC,"At this point in your life, I'd stay away from buying a new car b/c it's too much of a financial stretch - you don't have enough money for a downpayment that would make the monthly affordable plus insurance is going to be way more expensive.  You may want to consider leasing a new car if your credit allows.  Honda Civics and Toyota Corollas and Ford Fiesta or Focus, Hyundai Accent or Kia Rio can be leased for about $100-150 a month with some money down.  In this case, you'll still be on the hook for insurance though and will have nothing to show for your expenditure at the end of the lease so you'll have to make sure you save for something else during the duration of the lease.  I would not buy a used car from a dealer.  Carmax is a little better than others but I still wouldn't do it.  You can always get a better deal on a used car buying directly from the owner than the dealer since the dealer has to mark up the price of the car to make a profit and pay overhead.  Plus cars that are traded in to a dealer and wind up in the hands of a used car dealer often have problems or else the original owner would have sold it private party for more money.  So you inherit the problems.  Used car dealer usually do NOT offer robust warranties.  Some are just 30 days and are very limited in scope to the point where you'd have to sue them to get them to fix the problem.  That is my experience.  I'd suggest you spend about 2,000 on a good, reliable used car.  Use it for a couple of years while paying cheap insurance and regular maintenance and saving up for a new, newer car once you are financially ready.  After those x years, you can probably sell it for $1-2k as cars at that price do not depreciate much and you'll be ahead of the game financially.  I'd be happy to point you to some good used cars on craigslist if you don't know anything about cars.  From interacting with people at work, you'll be able to find a trustworthy mechanic w/o too much difficulty.  Hyundais and Kias are good cars.  Simple to fix, reliable, good on gas, cheap to insure.  I'd definitely get a 2010 Hyundai over an older Honda.  Hyundais and Kias used to have 10 year 100k warranties as well so look into that.  My .02 cents..."

personalfinance,3dqlzg,turboboss,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:39:31 2015 UTC,"Sure, I get that. But assuming that it's the same model and similar miles there's no substantive difference in reliability between cars bought from private sellers and dealers.   With regards to cost, it's virtually guaranteed to cost more from the dealer. If you go with a certified model it's going to cost that much more because you're buying an extended warranty (which you could buy on your own if you want). And even with the warranty, there is often a deductible for repairs and there's a cap on overall coverage costs.   The only advantage I can see for buying from a dealer is that you can look at multiple cars in one place and may have more options to choose from.   So I just don't understand the recommendations to buy from a dealer. In my opinion you'd be better off taking all that extra money you'd be spending at the dealer and either save it for maintenance and repairs, or buy a newer used car."
personalfinance,3dqlzg,pho1701,2,Sun Jul 19 01:29:58 2015 UTC,"The OP does not have a long time line here, his job starts soon, he basically needs the car in the next week.

personalfinance,3dqlzg,JoeTony6,2,Sat Jul 18 16:23:02 2015 UTC,"This isn't always true. Well it is, but sometimes the go hand in hand. For instance, generally the last year of a certain body type/model are going to be the most reliable because the manufacturer will have worked out every possible problem.   For example, perhaps you've noticed that in 2014 the Nissan Sentra got a bit of a body revamp. I have Sentra with the ""older"" body type, meaning they had ~5-7 years of production the perfect the body.  I know this isn't too relevant, but a better example would be 2004 Lamborghini Gallardo, or 2006-2008 Maserati Quattroporte. There is a reason you can find those cars on the cheap, because it was the first year(s) of production and they were riddled with problems.  OP, it's something to consider. Honda's been creating the Civic for decades, but every body revamp, surely they run into problems that need smoothening, so don't buy those first year bodies. I learned this the hard way."

This is a lot of money, I recommend figuring out how much you can afford. What is your current income and current expenses?  I've seen some lower interest rates as dealer incentives for Honda, Toyota, Kia, Hyundia, Ford, Chevy, Nissan, Mazda, depending on the month. It sucks buying a $20,000 car, but you're paying a premium buying new to ensure you don't have to deal with a mechanic.  I would try finding a different dealer and compare the Versa size cars."

The Nissan versa can easily be 13-14k if you can get it down to that price, the bottom end of most car brands is between 13-18k, so I was just rounding to under 20k, The Versa itself is cheaper, but like the honda fit is more, the Yaris is a bit more, etc.  The problem with the true lower end cars is you may have to give up some normal features like automatic transmission, cruise control, automatic windows which can be critical in keeping a car for a longer period of time (greater than 10 years), you can deal with it, but you have to be prepared to understand that you're planning on keeping the car for awhile, grow a thick skin when it gets made fun of."
personalfinance,3ds78b,heyeric,3,Sat Jul 18 23:13:41 2015 UTC,"Well if you're looking into home ownership and you're in the US there are a few things to consider. You're gonna want a hefty emergency fund that you won't use for a down payment. You're gonna want like 10 k for that emergency fund (roof needs replacing, furnace breaks, etc) Also look into city, state, and federal first time home buyer programs, I'm gonna guess with that income you won't qualify for much but hey free money is free money. You'll definitely want like 40k saved up for closing costs and to get that 20% down payment to avoid PMI payments (wasted money to insure the bank in case you default) I wouldn't put that money for the house in anything that has risk. A savings account or CD would be the way to go. IRA/401k will be more valuable in the long run than owning a house so it's a good idea to put as much as you can per year because once that year is gone you can't put in extra in a 401k or IRA to replace the lost opportunity for missed years."

Nope once the money is on your side of the table it's yours.  As an aside you called it tax free winnings. Is the UK different than the US with taxing gambling winnings? A deposit of what would be $23000 would attract IRS attention. It doesn't matter if you made your money selling cocaine Uncle Sam wants his cut (but lots of unexplained income will cause other authorities to investigate. That's why attempting to launder money is often where criminals get caught). If the UK is like the US in this regard then if you had withdrawn the 15000 pounds you should see what the tax obligations are.
personalfinance,3ds241,asimpleenigma,3,Sat Jul 18 22:50:39 2015 UTC,No gambling taxes in the UK or US for UK citizens. That is why all the big name poker players are from Europe now since they don't have to pay taxes on winnings. WSOP every year just gives tax free money away since in most countries gambling winnings aren't tax and some of those countries tax treaties allow it. Canadian and Australian don't pay taxes on gambling winnings but are taxed on it by the US when it comes to tax treaties and money won in the US.  US is one of the few countries that tax gambling winnings. If you lose gambling winning in the same tax year there is no taxes on it (you have to prove losses which is pretty simple they even accept a personal journal).

I don't want to go getting my credit pulled from tons of different places just to hopefully find one that would approve me for such large balances.  Unless they approve me simply because I'd be looking to balance transfer?  But yeah the interest is killing me...  Just didn't know if I wasn't approaching it correctly or if I just need to suck it up and roll with the punches.
personalfinance,3dqv1t,frugaler,9,Sat Jul 18 16:04:52 2015 UTC,"Managers are classified as exempt employees and are thus not entitled to overtime pay per law.  There is a big push on this issue by the Obama Administration to make it more difficult for employers to label employees exempt, though.  They're talking about ensuring employees are exempt by making them track their time to determine how much time they're actually spending on managerial duties to show that they're truly a manager.  But if your girlfriend is a manager at a retail store then she probably would be still classified as exempt."

personalfinance,3dr6yg,Volmcat,9,Sat Jul 18 17:51:44 2015 UTC,"This goes into how tax withholding is calculated. Basically, every single paycheck you get, the federal and state government assume is for the exact same amount that you will receive for all pay periods of that year.  So, if you usually earn about $600 per pay period and you have 26 pay periods, then income taxes for any given pay period would be withheld assuming you make $600 * 26 = $15,600/year.  But if you had two paychecks worth of money delivered in one pay period, then the income taxes would be taken out as if you earned $1200 * 26 = $31,200/year. Obviously, someone earning $31,200/year would get taxed more than someone earning $15,600/year.  But you don't earn that higher yearly wage, so what happens? Well, when you file your tax return in the first part of next year and include what you actually made, any excess tax withholding will get returned to you in the form of a refund. A tax refund is simply paying you back the extra you paid the federal or state government that was above what you actually owed."
personalfinance,3dr6yg,ElementPlanet,2,Sat Jul 18 17:57:40 2015 UTC,"Or if OP really cared to, he could submit new W-4s for the next pay period in order to nullify tax withholding (like claim 10 instead of 2) and then the week after submit yet another W-4 to return it to their normal withholding.   Just a little more legwork for you, HR, and payroll. Might not be worth the hassle if they somehow missed a whole pay period (assuming it was their fault and not OP's - like OP failing to turn in a time card). Last thing you want is nearly half a year in taxes being either grossly over/under withheld.   If you didn't need the whole paycheck, I'd guess you don't need the ~$80 extra taken out, based off your numbers. I'd just wait to get a return."

Everytime he does, he knows he'll buy alcohol. That's something he figured out about himself.  You need to find the situations that cause you to want to spend money.  For me, I remember when I would go to CVS, I would think ""I'm only going to get the things that I came here for"", but later I'd think ""well lets go look at the ice cream section. I won't buy anything, I'm just curious"" and one thing would lead to another and i'd buy useless shit.  What do you do that causes you to spend money? I'm not talking about the actual things that you buy, I mean the situations that you put yourself in that get you to buy those things. Those are the things you need to evaluate.  also, if you're going to get serious about this, keep track of every transaction you make. Others might not find that necessary, and maybe it isn't for you, but honestly, the exact very day I started doing that, oh man did my bank account start going up.

You cannot buy a principal residence with funds from your IRA (without having to pay a penalty), although if you are a first-time homebuyer you can use a portion of your IRA tax-free, like $10,000 or $15,000 or something like that. And to be a first time homebuyer you just need to have not owned a principal residence for the past two years (that is, it does not literally need to be the first home you ever purchased).  You can use funds from your IRA to buy investment property, but it must be done entirely from your IRA. You can't get a loan, you can't chip in money from your own, non-IRA accounts. So in your case, it doesn't sound like you have enough in your IRA to buy the bottom unit, so (from my understanding) you would be unable to make this investment.  But do talk to a professional, this is just what I recall hearing from my accountant a couple years back when I was considering a similar idea.

I always suggest to customers to borrow the money from friends/family, or try to find a personal loan. Seems to work well for most customers. I know for myself, I recently had $2,000 on an amex, 700 on my Chase card, and $1400 on my Discover. I also had $6,000 owing for my vehicle. I got a personal loan through a local credit union and paid of all my debts. Rather than paying 4 different debts on a given month, I'm now just paying 1 debt each month. The interest I'm paying averages out to be lower than what I was paying total for each account. If you have good credit, it's something to look in to. If you have only ok credit, the interest you are charged may be higher than just paying each account separately. If you do settle for less than what you owe, I would definitely recommend getting that in writing. It's not that the collector may be lying to you, but I know in my work experience, it is very easy for a collector to literally forget to input the settlement into the system, or to input it directly.

Were you essentially hired by the passenger's brother to drive his car as a taxi???    If someone asks you to drive their car for them then the liability is theirs. If you did them the favor to drive 24hrs in their car for them then they should not ask you to pay the damage.  This needs to be treated like you were their employee.     Now if you wanted to drive the passenger and asked someone else to borrow their car then you are liable for the damage just like if you had a rental car.  But you only are responsible for replacement or repair value for that specific car.     So it comes down were you a hired driver for your friend or was this more of a rental/borrow a car situation.    I know one thing that if I asked you to drive my car for 12 hours for me and you wrecked it then I would not make you pay for it unless you were drunk or on drugs. If I asked you to drive my car for my benefit then all the liability would be mine.

personalfinance,3drjit,WHAT_THE_FRENCH,2,Sat Jul 18 19:38:45 2015 UTC,"Probably not.  The return on the fund is probably better, can you provide the fund symbol or name? Capital gains on the value that the fund has increased between when you bought it and when you sold it.  Your broker should have your cost basis listed, subtract that from the current price to know how much your capital gain/loss is. If you have held it for over a year it should be long term capital gains so depending on your tax bracket you'll either owe 0/15/20% of the profit on the sale. The performance percentage that the fund grows isn't determined by the principal you have in the account, but the total dollars that you account grows is.  If you have a 7% growth one year then every dollar in your account became worth $1.07."

personalfinance,3drjit,mmmmmmBacon12345,2,Sat Jul 18 19:52:20 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty solid fund(VWELX), its similar to a target date fund in that it is always diversified but it doesn't adjust as you age.  It has an average annual return of 7.8% over the last 10 years and 8.26% over the last 86 years, statistically you should expect to get about 40% more return on investment for your dollars by leaving them in the fund instead of paying off the 5% car loan.  5% is kinda high, but 7% over an eon matters far more than 5% over 6 months."

For example, if you are interested in the non-profit world/being part of something bigger that could be a good resume booster, Americorps offers so many ways to help. I did a quick search of Nashville Americorps opportunities on its portal, and it returned a list of 23 options. You may not qualify for all of them, but there are programs out there if you do some internet searching for them. Here is the link of the first search (and the website in general)    https://my.americorps.gov/mp/listing/search.do?criteria.serviceAreas=CED&criteria.programState=TN    Additionally, is it possible for Nashville to have a career development center of some sort? I know some YMCA's have career help, but I do not know the YMCA scene of the city. If none exist, there are resources online of resume boosting skills. Plus, the internet can give tips on how to nail an interview and prepare cover letters and all the job jargon.    If you are interested in trade schools/community college, you could enroll in a program and find a new area of interest. The catch is that college costs money, but Americorps does offer an education award of five thousand something dollars for education if you complete the program successfully (program is usually about 10 months long, but you can do a program twice and get 2 education awards, or about $11,000 for education).      I guess what I am trying to get at is, there are programs if you want a career, or at least in the short term enough cash to cover your needs (usually an Americorps stipend is $12,250 for the term, and is subject to taxes. However, many non-VISTA programs can allow you to enroll in SNAP and get full benefits, $194 a month, for food). Learning a trade or community college is another great way to find something you can love and generate job opportunities in the long term (though stay away from for-profit schools, they will not help).    I hope that helps a little! I am sure you have options! Please feel free to ask any questions!"

A service representative can steer them to most of the proper VA programs, including caregiver support, applying for aid and attendance, travel reimbursement, grants for making the house accessible, etc.  There are just too many variables that can't be answered simply via a message, as most depend on his ratings and claim status.  The rep can find out the status of the claim, can probably advise on filing for SSDI, and other useful info.  The VA portal will probably have the claim status, but there are many many programs that you have to know about and know the qualifications for.    If your father doesn't have a rep, if he is a member of any veterans organization there are reps out there.  Some states have reps available as well if they have a veterans agency.

I've heard from some people that the more you pay off a credit card, the more likely that company will offer a lower APR or something similar, and I didn't know if having a credit card with a zero balance would be preferable to just getting my debt down to a much less imposing number.   None of this matters. You are wasting money every month. If you have the means to pay it in full, then do so.

I'm just curious as to whether you're advocating that credit cards altogether are a bad idea because I will have to pay interest on them, a.k.a. throw money away. I was under the impression that lines of credit (as long as they are kept under control) are not only useful when used carefully, but arguably necessary to be develop a well-rounded credit record.  In this situation you're suggesting, should I pay down the credit card and then close the account out?  Thank you for your explanation so far, I hope I'm not frustrating you; I just am having a conflicting understanding of the role that credit should play in my financial situation."

Pretty much you spend what you can afford then once a month you'll get a statement and there will be a due date on the statement as well as a statement balance. If you pay the statement balance by the statement due date your interest could be 1000% and it wouldnt matter because you won't pay any interest. It's important to also know that your utilization % is determined by your statement balance so try to keep your statement balances under 30%. But that's not very important unless you are trying to finance something with credit very soon, because utilization % has no history. So you could go from 100% one month and pay it all off and have 20% the next month and all the creditors would see after that 20% statement is the 20% they would never know about the 100%"
personalfinance,3drbbl,ThatAssholeMrWhite,2,Sat Jul 18 19:38:27 2015 UTC,"doesn't it stand to reason that paying any interest at all is throwing money away?   Interest is a fee charged to borrow money. If you're borrowing money that you don't need, you're throwing money away by paying interest. If you're borrowing money that you need or can put to better use elsewhere (for example investing rather than paying down low interest loans), then you're not throwing money away.  That said, if you're paying 20% interest on credit card debt, you're probably throwing money away unless you used that debt for a necessary medical procedure or something like that.   lines of credit (as long as they are kept under control)   If you're paying 20% interest on a credit card, it's not under control. I'd go so far as to say that if you're paying any interest on a credit card, it's not under control.  The responsible way to use a credit card in non-emergency situations is to use it as a transactor, meaning you use the cards to make purchases and then pay the statement balance in full every month."

As long as the card has no annual fee, there's no reason to close it out. It will help your credit profile as long as it stays open.  As has been said already, once you have the balance down to $0, you can now use it to make purchases without paying interest as long as you pay the statement balance every month."
personalfinance,3drbbl,DeluxeXL,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:14:08 2015 UTC,"by that logic doesn't it stand to reason that paying any interest at all is throwing money away?   Yes.

Mortgages, loans, personal lines of credit, etc. are different stories.   credit cards altogether are a bad idea because I will have to pay interest on them   No, look up ""grace periods."" If you pay the statement balance in full by the due date, you do not have to pay interest. Interest only accrues when you do NOT pay the full statement balance (aka carrying a balance from month to month).  I suggest paying it in full but keeping it open as long as there isn't an annual fee. This will keep your average age of accounts up, which is another factor in determining your credit score."

My understanding is if you fail to pay the 401k loan back, you essentially are liable for the taxes on the amount not paid back plus the early withdrawal penalty.

I did a 6 year program out of high school.   20k a year is 1/2 of what I paid for school.  So you're getting a good deal.  I think how I would approach your situation is, take out loans, keep that savings, pay off the interest every year so the loan doesn't balloon up.  And then when you are a pharmacist, you'll be able to pay off the 80k loan in 5-6 years.  Or you can pay years 1 & 2 out of pocket, and take a loan out for the rest.    $I have a 90k loan, and I around $1500 a month.  Might push it to 2000 a month."

personalfinance,3dr6v7,hortonhearsatoot,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:46:11 2015 UTC,It depends on the location and your ability to network.  80k isn't bad for pharmacy school.

personalfinance,3dr4e3,stillhere1,3,Sat Jul 18 17:28:52 2015 UTC,"I'm in car sales (high end stuff but I've worked with a variety of brands) and this question comes up a LOT.  So first of all don't count your bonus in with your income - a bonus is nice, but if it isn't guaranteed money pretend it doesn't exist and use it if and when you get it.  Based on some quick math i'm showing you with an $1800 surplus ever month after taxes and after expenses.  Everyone is going to have a different opinion on this but I think you should split that spare $800 between a normal savings account and some kind of investment/retirement/paying extra on your highest interest loan.  That'll leave you $1,000 and, I notice you didn't budget any fun or entertainment in for yourself so let's take another $200 out.  You've got $800 left that you can use to budget for a car and all the associated car expenses like gas, insurance, and normal maintenance like oil changes.  Now, as for buying vs. leasing.  The argument against leasing is that you never OWN the car.  Some people look at this as a downside as you're just spending money without gaining any assets and, to some extent, they're right.  If you own a car you have something you can sell.  In your case I'm actually going to recommend leasing and I'll tell you why.  When you lease you're ALWAYS in a new car and that car is always under warranty.  You don't (well, you shouldn't) have to worry about any major expenses with the vehicle, it is very unlikely to break down, it will get great gas mileage, it will be very safe, all those things.  In addition it gives you some flexibility with your future - right now you can lease the smallest, least expensive car you can find or that fits your needs and you can reevaluate in 3 years.  Mabye you're married in 3 years, maybe you have 6 kids, maybe you get transferred to someplace where you need an SUV, maybe your town has all the infrastructure in place for electric cars, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe.    Once you're older and more established and you can see what the next portion of you life is going to look like THEN you can buy and commit to a car for 7 - 10 years.  As for what to buy if you honestly don't care what you drive do what everyone else does and lease a Honda Civic and don't put ANY money down (you will pay your 1st month's payment and any registration/doc/title fees when you sign, however).  It'll be under $200/mo for 12,000 miles per year if you have good credit.  That's a safe, efficient, perfectly fine car that'll do everything you need it to for this part of your life."

personalfinance,3dr4e3,rodion_kjd,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:07:05 2015 UTC,Unfortunately the difference between a two year lease and a three year lease is usually substantial because if the way a lease is calculated. Have your dealer run both scenarios but you're likely looking at $350 vs $200. Not that that's the end of the world.

Keep in mind I am also Canadian, and by no means a professional financial adviser, so financial situations might be different. My advice is meant to be practical. Firstly, let me congratulate you on getting a full scholarship: not having to stress about how you're going to make tuition payments work is not something you need to worry about. However, I would also HIGHLY recommend you put most if not all your free time dedicated into your studies. This means no shenanigans or fuckery of any kind. You may think I'm kidding around, but most (if not all, especially the very esteemed colleges) will revoke scholarship funding if you fail to meet their academic standards or have missed a lot of classes. So if you do well in school from the start, you won't have to worry. That being said, I would not jump into a part time job right away, UNLESS you won't have means of having spending or living expenses covered. Having a part time job during school can overstress you and bleed into your studies. I worked all throughout my 4 years of my BA, and no, it was not easy. Sometimes my job scheduled me during classes, or wouldn't let me take off designated time (because I wanted to study more). So keep this in mind when preplanning your finances for the upcoming school year. Preferably if you can work BEFORE the school year to save up for personal or living expenses, it would be more ideal.  If you feel you can handle having a few shifts a week during the school year, then yes, a part-time job is great. College works one of two ways: you work and you have money to go out and spend (but have a lack of free time), or you don't work, have lots of free time (but no money to go out and socialize). To be honest, I would not even consider an internship until your last year of your program. Internships are usually unpaid, and while they are good for practical experience, you won't have any other dedicated time to put into figuring out your own business or career (to finance everything). I would wait and consider it an option (if you are able to financially) for the last few years of your program. As mentioned below BUDGETING is a big factor. Figure out how much you intend (or want) to spend each week and try to put that aside. That way during the school year, you will know how much you need to cover your expenses.  Again, in personal experience it's better to start a business during school, while you still have teachers and peers to help you. DO NOT start trying to freelance DURING the school semester. You'll fizz yourself out. I would plan during the school year, and ask teachers and peers for any advice and questions, but do the startup during the summer when you have the time to focus on it. I would start looking into it the after your first year (to give you an idea of how the market is). That way, during your second year, you are back in school to correct errors with your teachers and peers again, but still have your business started up for when you graduate. Again, during school, your main priority is school (especially because you're a scholarship student). As for investments, a few friends of mine put money away every month into a savings account that collected interest. The more money you save into the account, the more interest etc. At the end of your schooling, if you've saved an adequate amount, you should have some extra interest to help fund your business or any future financial plans. This is just an idea, as some of my friends did this to help pay back student loans.  This probably seems like a lot of information, and yes, all the financial planning WILL make your brain want to explode. Just take it easy, and make lists. Goals, budgeting, and how much you want to save/spend per month or week. Put them somewhere where you can see them everyday, and try to reach them. That's how I made it through 4 years of university while paying for everything myself and keeping my debt to a minimum.  Good luck!  Ps. Don't underestimate your parents if they're able to help at all either. Whether it be buying you food or doing laundry during finals, ask for help if you need it."

To format a list properly, add a space between the bullet points and list items, and add a blank line before the start of the list.     When I was a small child my father purchased a $25K life insurance policy for me. He has always had the payments set up on auto pay, $6 a month I think. The policy has a 6% interest rate and at this point the interest earned pays for the policy premiums. The payments continue to auto withdraw and deposit towards the policy. The policy now has approximately a $4,300 cash out value.    I would normally just keep sending them money treating it like a savings account because 6% is pretty good. The downside is that at some point the company starts to reject the payments and sends back a portion of the payments. So there goes that idea.    I have life insurance for both me and my spouse through work that would cover our debts and funeral costs. Between the house, student loans and one vehicle we have about 150K in debt all less than 4% interest.     I have also deposited no less than 12% of my earnings into 401K with matches from my company. (I think I have a good start on retirement.)    My options:   Cash out and pay down debt:* I don't think this is worth it because the interest on my debts is less than the interest earned on the policy. Cash out and roll into 401K:* I feel like I have a good start for retirement and this just doesn't sound ""exciting"" if I'm honest. Cash out and roll into a different kind of investing:* I have been thinking about starting an investment account where I could use the money PRIOR to getting old if it does well. Vacations, luxury purchases etc. (If it does well). At least with this I could contribute more than $6 a month in addition to the initial $4,300. Keep the life insurance policy as is:* Simple but is it the logical thing to do?   I'll be honest I would really like to take the money to invest to potentially earn ""play"" money. $4,300 isn't going to relieve a bunch of stress or enable a much needed purchase. I'm asking here because I would like to make sure my idea isn't completely irrational. If it is a good a idea I would appreciate a good lead into what kind of investments I should look into or avoid.    Bonus Question: My brother (27)M has the same policy but is in a very different financial situation. Lives with GF, some debt, dodgy vehicle, living month to month.

Has an original return been prepared and filed? If he did not file his original return, it is possible the Service assessed the balance due as a Substitute For Return (SFR). This generally results in the largest possible tax liability based on the available income records, without regard to any deductions or credits he may be eligible to claim.   I recommend you file Form 2848, Power of Attorney and Declaration of Representative (Instructions) as a family member. This will allow you to speak on your father's behalf, and obtain all available wage and income and tax account transcripts. The form takes about two weeks to process, after which you will receive a letter providing you a Centralized Authorization File (CAF) number. This CAF number means you are linked to your father's federal tax account as a representative for the years you designate on the form. You can select one year (2013!) or a range of years (2010 - 2017), but you can't put ""All Years"".  If you identify the existing balance due is a result of an SFR, you should prepare as accurate a return as possible and file it.

As long as it has no annual fee, keep it and buy a coffee with it every other month or so, or put netflix on it, set up autopay on it and sock drawer it.

It has nothing to do with your Chase Roth IRA.  Bank CD's are great if you're 85, but lousy if you're 30.  You need that money to work for you by increasing in value.  You probably want to invest it with a good company like Vanguard in a couple broad-market index mutual funds like the Vanguard Total Stock Market or in a target-date fund like the Vanguard Target Retirement 2050 Fund.

The way estate law works is this: Your parent passed. Everything they owned and owed makes up the estate. The estate is a legal person that can do things like retain lawyers and pay for funeral expenses.  The executor is the person who controls the estate-robot.  The executor's job is to do all the things that the estate requires including seeing the estate through court to divide out the assets and re-title them to the new owners.  Note also that in many states the executor is entitled to a fee of about 3% of the estate's value.

personalfinance,3dqxpz,KarmanHard-On,6,Sat Jul 18 16:29:57 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't have an easy solution for you.  You have a couple things you need to do.  First off, stop signing any documents without first reading them.  Now that you're 18, everything you sign is binding.  With that being said, I'd do a couple things.  First off, get off your parents' phone plan.  You can get on Ting which is like $30 a month.  Regarding education funding, that's a big decision to make.  If they're really this controlling, I would have a contract between the two of you that clearly specifies the terms of the funding, so that they can't use it as a means to control you.  If they're lending you the money, then you have a loan contract that states the terms of repayment and that the lenders can't put it into default whenever they want.  It's black and white so it can't be used as a lever to control you.  If you're not comfortable with that, then get your own student loans and self fund.  If they want to support you they can always still give you the money to pay the loan (still get it in writing that it was a gift and not a loan).  Regarding health insurance, universities offer health insurance to their students anyways, so you won't need their insurance.  After graduating you'll have to get your own health insurance, but hopefully it will be through an employer.  If not, then you can get on Obamacare at that point.  The more concerning thing is your current finances.  You have cards and accounts open in your name that you don't even know about.  You need to find these, and find if they're in your name (and not your parents').  If they're your accounts, but listed under both your names, they're joint, and you can withdraw the full funds legally.  In that instance, funds that are supposed to be yours but under a joint account, I would withdraw the funds, then set up a separate account in your name only.  Regarding credit cards, ensure that you are the only one on them, and that your parents aren't authorized users.  Pull your credit reports and it will tell you what open credit lines are under your name.  This should help you track down your credit cards.  You can call the companies and tell them these are under your name and you need more information about them.  Once they verify your identity, you can do whatever you want, including cancelling outstanding cards, removing authorized signers, etc.  I'd also recommend setting up a PO Box (not expensive at all) to have all correspondence related to everything sent.  So you'd change the address on all of your financial accounts to this PO Box.   So, I've had a number of odd jobs over the years and gave all of my paychecks to my dad to put into my savings, as well as all of the money I was gifted at my graduation party. These savings are technically for my college spending money (I should be going off to school in August) so I haven't had the desire to touch them at all. Then, I turned 18 this past March and got a retail job at a store in a mall at $9/hr. I didn't bother setting up a direct deposit because I don't have a credit card (The only spending money I have comes from random babysitting jobs where I'm paid in cash) so they sent me a store visa for my paychecks to feed into automatically. My dad caught it in the mail first and didn't tell me about it until weeks later when he had me stand next to him while he verified it or whatever (I literally know nothing about personal finance) over the phone and set up a pin. Then he took the card back to his office. I don't have the card (which is under my name) nor do I even know the pin. [QUESTION 1: is this legal? Do I have any rights to my own money?].   Contact the bank that has the savings account with your money in it.  See if your name is on the account.  Also talk to your employer about getting a new Visa issued.  Change your address to the PO Box before doing this, if possible, so no documentation is sent to your parents'.  Have your employer help you with this."

personalfinance,3dqxpz,LegoMovieExtra,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:54:38 2015 UTC,"I was in a kind of similar situation, except my mom just spent all my paychecks to ""support us"", and then didn't. I spent four years supporting her and my brother and by the last year I was there, I had just graduated high school and was spending my summer working and living in a trailer with no running water, electricity, or sewage, and very little food listening to her crazy rants all night. When I left, I had $40 cash hidden away from tips, the clothes on my back, and a friend willing to let me crash on her couch until I got on my feet. I didn't have a driver's license or a car, and spent a while living without that.  If your parents have told you all your life there is no way you'll ever support yourself - as my mom told me - it's hard to believe you can make it. In addition to the other advice in this thread, I recommend doing the math yourself. I was convinced I couldn't until a good friend sat me down and forced me to see my income was greater than what my bills would be.  Now is the time to take advantage of things like food stamps and free healthcare. The one benefit to my situation was that because my mom didn't work (I don't know if she was mentally stable enough to if she even wanted to), I was familiar with the system and felt comfortable applying. You should too. This is the situation these things are made for. You will pay it back tenfold later.  As far as college - I'm originally from Michigan, and I'd say if you have access to NMC, it's a great place to do your first two years while you get on your feet. Depends on where you're from whether or not that's an option for you, but don't rule out community college. I did NMC and then transferred to MSU. But your first year or two could even be better at a community college. MSU's freshmen courses are giant lectures (think 100+ students). They suck. At NMC, it's more like 30 people. Worst case - no one will fault you for taking a year off to get on your feet. It doesn't make a significant difference in the long term.  If you're curious how I'm doing, I'm living and working in a major city and just paid off the last of a little over $11k in student loans. I've been out of school for four years. Haven't talked to my mom in roughly 8 years. No regrets whatsoever. Remember that you owe nothing to anyone, and it is your choice now who is in your family. I chose to keep toxic people out. Good luck.   Edit: I never saw any of the money my mom took from me - I made $7-$9k each of those four years. You do the math. You can do your best to get yours back, but I wouldn't hold your breath if the money isn't in your account anymore - she was court ordered to pay me the $7k inheritance she stole from me, and everything I made while under 18 was legally considered hers. Considering she got $150k in inheritance a couple of years ago and I still haven't seen this $7k, I don't think I'll ever be seeing it. Be prepared to write this money off if you can't get it out of the bank."
personalfinance,3dqxpz,LegoMovieExtra,-1,Sat Jul 18 22:26:51 2015 UTC,"If your parents will pay for your education in full, then it makes financial sense to forget about the relatively small loss of pay checks to stay in their good graces. Play them, get the education, use their car, then leave forever after you graduate.   However, I wonder if the money even exists. I say this because your dad is taking your paychecks and opened a line of credit in your name. On the one hand, he could be looking out for your best interests by forcing you to save your pay and then opening up a credit card in your name to build a credit history. On the other hand, he could be taking all of your money and running up debt in your name. The lack of transparency makes me think the latter, and if he needs steal from you, he's broke. As others have said, get your credit report and see what's going on.  In any case, if you are in physical danger leave. Call the cops if you are threatened or harmed.

personalfinance,3dqti8,_albatross,6,Sat Jul 18 15:49:12 2015 UTC,"That sounds like self-employment income to me. You are using the device to make money (profit). IRS considers babysitting and lawnmowing and selling things on ebay as examples of self employment income. Your project seems to merit same treatment.  The business income goes on Sched C-EZ, and you can deduct some costs (materials, supplies, advertising) as business expenses. The resulting profit -- let's say its $1200 goes on 1040 line 12.  If your profit is more than $400, you pay some self employment taxes. It supports Social Security and Medicare. It would be $1200 * 0.9235 * 0.153, or about $170 in SE tax. Goes on 1040 line 57.  You also get to deduct 1/2 of the SE tax from your income, on 1040 line 27. So you'd really only be paying income tax on $1200 – $85 = $1115.  If this gig is your only source of income, your $1115 income is so low it doesn't even get taxed. As a single dependent, you wouldn't owe income tax until you've earned more than $6300.   You would still file 1040, because of the Schedule C-EZ and the Schedule SE. You'd just pay the $170 in SE tax in April if no income tax.  If your gig really takes off, and your taxes due to income or SE tax add up to $1000, then IRS would expect you to make some tax payments periodically (4 times) during the year. But the projections you made suggest estimated tax is not an issue for you yet.  The smallness of your income is not what determines whether it is a hobby or a business. The IRS has some vague language differentiating the two. But essentially, the gist is you are intending to make a profit and want to be able to take deductions (maybe even occasionally have a loss). So it's business income.   http://www.irs.gov/uac/Business-or-Hobby%3F-Answer-Has-Implications-for-Deductions"

I thought I was doing well with the $550,000 I already had in life insurance.   Despite what it says, I would say the fact that you are married necessitates that you need life insurance. It might be an extra expense, but it is one that pays off. It is important to remember that it is cheaper to get life insurance at a younger age, than later. So the amount of ""extra money"" you spend on it now will probably be less than what your premiums will go up by when you need it in the future due to older age.  Basically, the earlier you get your life insurance, the better, due to the savings on premiums based on health factors."

When I file my US tax each year (the IRS 1040 form) I simply indicate that I'm a UK resident paying UK taxes (national insurance, etc).

He recommended filing for 3 years in back taxes I think. Because I was making less than US$100K (can't remember the exact figure) my earnings were excluded from income. I only paid tax on my earning from my investments. I think I averaged about US$300 for each of the three years in back taxes -  if I paid any penalties, it wasn't anything massive, because I can't remember it. I guess if you want to keep your US passport it will cost you a couple hundred bucks a year in taxes.

The AU account shows up on my credit report still and the card is now closed as I'm 26 now and they don't use that one.  After graduating from college I applied for the BOA Cash Back card and was approved (I banked with BOA since 16, not sure if it matters, and I got a low limit but a real card nonetheless).

personalfinance,3dqlh6,fragglepated,2,Sat Jul 18 14:27:56 2015 UTC,"I guess my only hangup is will this affect my credit negatively to flip these loans?   Depends how established your credit history is. If your credit history is fairly short with only a a small handful of accounts, it might drop a little for a few months due to a new account being reported, but it will recover after that and may even end up higher. If you have a longer credit history that's somewhat diverse, it might not affect it much at all.  Personally I'd do what makes the most sense financially rather than worry about short-term credit impacts. If it will save money and help you pay it off faster despite the origination fee, I'd go for it."
personalfinance,3dqlh6,MikeyXL,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:10:04 2015 UTC,You can but you need to do the math on this deal.  These loans have origination fees.  It may sap the benefit of the bargain to switch if you still need to pay that fee.
personalfinance,3dqlh6,SpicedApple,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:53:02 2015 UTC,"Yes. There is still an origination. The rate is like 7%.  The 10.38 is with that figured in. I have thought of that, and it does cut into the savings a little, but overall it does save some over the life of the loan. More if I pay off early."

personalfinance,3dmr1a,NetSage,23,Fri Jul 17 15:15:57 2015 UTC,"Automobiles are one of the most brand-loyal purchases there are. While the shady used car salesman is a stereotype born from experience, a smart seller knows that retaining the customer's trust and business will pay off big time. If OP has bad credit, I could imagine the dealer figuring out a way to get better terms by the end of the week. Like you say though, it's just a matter of looking carefully before taking the offer."

But he did not have permission to do so. So he's asking to shorten my length, which would lower my over all payment in the long run, but would up my monthly back over my limit. Kinda seems like a bait and switch kinda thing. Plus there is no penalty for early payment so why would I sign that deal. But I will be going down to the dealership later today to find out."

personalfinance,3dmr1a,boxsterguy,9,Fri Jul 17 15:54:29 2015 UTC,"As an aside, this is why it's a bad idea to ever negotiate car prices based on monthly payments.  For the future, follow these steps:   Decide how much you can afford Go to your bank/credit union and get preapproved Negotiate the car sales price in cash.  If the salesman starts talking about financing or payments or pulls out a 4-square, tell him you're not doing that.  If he persists, walk away and go somewhere else (or negotiate via email) Buy the car with your pre-approved financing from step 2.   Monthly payments only come in at step 1 and 2, where you figure out how much you can afford and at what interest rate.  Banks are less likely to shuffle numbers like salesmen will (""Oh, you want a lower monthly payment?  Great!  This 72-month 9% loan fits your monthly payment."" And now you're paying 9% interest for 6 years).  If you can't get the payments you want in step 2 with the amount you decided in step 1, then your amount in step 1 was wrong and you have to go back and recalculate that."

personalfinance,3dmr1a,ChuckinTucson,3,Fri Jul 17 20:31:22 2015 UTC,"If you can't unwind the deal (check your state laws for a ""cooling off period"", which you may or may not still be within the range of -- often it's only a day or two), call your bank and see if you can immediately refinance the car into a better loan.  As pointed out, there's no cooling off period for cars."

personalfinance,3dmr1a,boxsterguy,2,Sat Jul 18 00:05:15 2015 UTC,"This is good advice for determining how much you're going to spend on your car, but terrible advice for negotiating. Dealerships will often decrease the sale price of the car if they believe the buyer is financing, as they expect to make up the money in sales-goals and financing-goals incentives.  The best thing to do is determine the price you'll pay, then negotiate with the salesman without committing to any form of payment. Let them push on a rope - tell them you haven't decided how to pay; maybe cash, maybe you'll finance through the bank or the auto company's financing arm if the terms are right. Or maybe you're not buying at all right now - after all, you don't really need this car.  The less information they have, the better."
personalfinance,3dmr1a,ja1484,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:52:43 2015 UTC,"Either way, you want to come to a final number that is the total price of the car, not a monthly payment number.

They probably did hose you pretty good, they hose everybody as is their job. Ask them who the lender is and what the terms are, and then write that shit down. Do not agree to a new contract- let them take care back or eat the contract as written. If they take the car back now you can start over knowing the terms in which a lender has approved you- and who the lender is- you can start over and do a better job of not getting hosed.  Or, you can renegotiate the deal before signing anything, make them lower sale price of car until it fits into your budget- DO NOT BUY ANY WARRANTIES OR DEALER ADDED OPTIONS< NO ACCESSORIES  dont let them pack the payments or the rate"

Don't give the guy an inch, tell him if he wants to go over a new contract he will have to email you both copies so that you can go over it (plus have a record of everything), if he can't do that then he can fuck right off."

There's 0% chance they're doing this only to ""save you some money"" and you need to know exactly why they're pursuing this. In any case, I'm very suspicious that a new contract would leave you in a better position.

personalfinance,3dmr1a,ChuckinTucson,2,Fri Jul 17 16:47:43 2015 UTC,"That might not be an option. If the original contract is valid and financing approved, you cannot simply return the car and get your (the bank's) money back.  There is a common scam where the sales contract is contingent on financial approval, and the dealer calls back later saying that the original finance terms were not approved and you must agree to these other terms or the deal is void. In that case, yes, you can ""return"" the car because holding on to it without signing the modified terms would be illegal.  In this case, it just sounds like the dealer found a different financing option -- not that the original financing fell through. In this case, OP's only real leverage is to say ""I've got the car under terms I approve of. Go pound sand."""
personalfinance,3dmr1a,KyleBumpus,5,Fri Jul 17 17:02:09 2015 UTC,"That isn't a scam, that's just the bank refusing to finance a deal with the given terms."
personalfinance,3dmr1a,hohs20,11,Fri Jul 17 15:27:20 2015 UTC,"The scam is on the part of the dealer -- they know that the terms won't get approved, but ""sell"" the car anyway. This usually happens when buying a car on the weekend or some other time when you don't get immediate bank approval, so they ""sell"" the car with a financial contingency.  The bank rejects the deal (as expected and as they should) but the buyer has already taken possession of the car and ""fallen in love"" and is more likely to agree to worse financing terms because they don't want to give the car back. The new terms usually involve more of a dealer kickback at a higher interest rate.  Alternatively the dealer never submitted the original terms, but then adds a few percent interest on top of the bank's interest rate and pockets the difference.  It's called a ""Spot Delivery"" or ""Yo-Yo Scam"""
personalfinance,3dmr1a,gnopgnip,3,Fri Jul 17 16:05:23 2015 UTC,"To be clear, not all spot deliveries are yo-yo scams, but they happen often enough to have a name, and be deemed illegal in many states."

Finance manager called me back a few days later and said he found a different bank with better terms.  Went back in, signed the new contract, lower APR, lower payments, same term.  Nothing scammy or shady at all."
personalfinance,3dmr1a,instareport,-4,Fri Jul 17 16:43:29 2015 UTC,"That's an extremely serious accusation. I'm assuming you have proof that the dealer knows the terms won't get approved but ""sells"" the car anyway. May I see it?  In reality, a spot delivery is just when the terms of the financing can't be finalized immediately for whatever reason and the dealer lets the customer take the car home anyway. They'll make you sign a spot delivery form, so don't say they didn't disclose what was going on. The form they make you sign is EXTREMELY clear."
personalfinance,3dmr1a,KyleBumpus,3,Fri Jul 17 17:06:13 2015 UTC,"Certainly it's worth finding out what the new terms are.   It's possible they're better.   When I purchased a car a few years ago, the dealer actually had better financing than my credit union. Went in, signed all the paperwork, and then the next day when we came to pick it up, the finance manager came out with new paperwork with a better rate than the one we initially signed for - turned out a bank was late getting back to him with an answer."

Now, let me ask you this - do you really think he's willingly going to go out of his way to get you to save money, which in turn will take money out of his own pocket, after he has already made the sale? I don't. You probably shouldn't believe that, either.  There is almost no chance what they're trying to do works in your favor. You can certainly go in and satisfy your curiosity, but I guarantee it'll just be a play on numbers to lower your monthly payments or something while effectively charging you more."

personalfinance,3dmr1a,pwny_,5,Fri Jul 17 16:40:18 2015 UTC,"You probably actually don't have a binding legal contract. If the bank rejected financing, you may have no choice but to resign or return the car. There's almost certainly a financing contingency on the contract you signed that allows this.  If you said no to the dealer on the phone, what was the response? Is this indeed a case of the financing falling through? You might be able to get a small concession from them for the inconvenience. The only leverage you have is that they might lose a sale if they don't make you happy. But if you aren't willing to return the car, you have no leverage.  If this isn't a case of the bank rejecting the terms of financing, disregard my response."
personalfinance,3dmr1a,PRNmeds,5,Fri Jul 17 19:36:03 2015 UTC,"I asked what would happen if I didn't agree and he just kept up with the ""I guarantee you'll be happy"" finally got him to admit that  if I didn't he would have to go back to the bank and figure out how to get it approved.

They're in the business of making money, and aren't going to spend time/energy to try to get you a better deal once you've already inked the original contract.  They probably screwed up on their end and gave you better terms than they feel your credit score deserved. They're trying to find a way to get more money because working with you is calculated as ""riskier"".  You don't have to give anything back, you have a legally binding contract which you were happy with at the time you purchased the vehicle.

They evidently found a loan source (most dealership have multiple places they can place loans) that had better terms than what they originally thought.  You should have stayed in the office with the two contracts side by side and compared them instead of insisting that you go to the reception area.

It's a good job for a kid living at home (especially if they're still in high school), but it's just a ""getting by"" job otherwise. You can live okay on $24 000/yr as a young person if you live with roommates and watch your budget and work full time or as close to it as possible. But at 17, why would you? So you can stay out all night instead of coming home by 1 a.m.? Is that seriously worth a month's rent and all the added responsibilities associated?"
personalfinance,3dqlbf,finerain,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:30:56 2015 UTC,I love my mom to death but after I got busted for possession of weed I get treated as if I'm a terrible human being. When in reality I just enjoyed playing piano more high. I also want to move out because I see my brother still living at home at 20 and I always thought I would be out by then I'm scared that if I don't push myself out of the nest I never will.
personalfinance,3dqlbf,pho1701,2,Sat Jul 18 16:36:46 2015 UTC,"That's fair. You can get by on that kind of money, if you're careful about it and you're working close to full time. You'll also be able to have some fun with it, although you're not going to have a massive budget for entertainment/electronics/etc. However, it's not much if you're hoping to save -- which is really important to consider if you'd like to go to school or take some courses later. (Remember, you don't need to just pay for the course itself -- you also need savings to that you can pay bills, eat, clothe yourself, and occasionally have some fun while you're taking the course and working fewer hours.) Consider, also, that when you leave home, you often leave with stuff -- furniture, a laptop, a car, a cell phone, that kind of thing. Give it a few years and those things start needing expensive repairs or replacements, which can suddenly get awfully expensive and take a toll on a bank account. Or maybe you're thinking you're a bit done with the whole ""sharing a house"" or living in a basement thing, and you're looking to move to a nicer place with fewer or no roommates or somewhere that allows pets and holy hell, they want HOW much money for that?! (And have you been advancing at work or getting decent raises, or are you only making an extra $1.50/hr after two years at the same job?)  Those kids of things can be a bit of a shock after the first year or two where you might start thinking, ""Hey, this whole supporting myself thing is not anywhere near as expensive or hard as people made it sound!"" It sounds like your home life is fine (ie you don't need to get out for your own health or safety) -- and I promise you that living at home at 20 is not exactly a death sentence, and a lot of people end up at home at 22 or 23 for at least a bit after graduating uni. It's not the end of the world if you don't immediately leave the nest at graduation or if you return, and, frankly, it generally makes financial sense not to.)  (I'm 24 and these are just a few thoughts I have that might not have occurred to me. Good luck in making your decision, and congrats on the new job!)"

Otherwise since it's not your primary residence the law treats it as an investment property.  Regarding the loan, you should get the paperwork drawn up by a real estate attorney.  You said heir. Are you thinking estate planning? If you expect to die sooner rather than later (I don't mean to be morbid), it's much smarter to will it to him when you die.  When it goes through probate court the cost basis on which capital gains are taxed is reset to when he took ownership, not 15 years ago.  This makes the tax burden on him when he sells it very low."

personalfinance,3dns55,pooyorkshitty,5,Fri Jul 17 19:48:09 2015 UTC,"Need based and merit based aid are different. It sounds to me your most significant aid is merit based: ""I earned full scholarship by being Valedictorian""   Ten grand isn't actually that much money and may not have a huge impact on your financial aid. Ask the financial aid folks at your school what having 10k in cash would do. No need to tell them where its from or why you got it.  Since you go to a large University, it probably has a law school. Free legal advice is usually available from those. They can give you information about trusts, bankruptcy and so on. Roth IRA only works if you also earn money.   I realize your foster parents want to give you this money, and it makes it 'feel' like its yours. However, it is unclear to me who, from a legal point of view, owns and controls this money. Is it your safe deposit box? Is it your foster parents?   It sounds to me like the government pays your foster parents $500, and they put it in a safe deposit box that is in their name. Don't stress out about lost investment time for a couple years over taking the risk of committing fraud or theoretically losing some money in a bankruptcy that may or may not impact you.  However, I am also unsure who this money should actually be going to. You're 18+ so shouldn't every single dollar go directly to you from the state? Are you dependent on these foster parents, either from literal point of view or a tax point of view? Some stuff doesn't add up here, and I am concerned something else is going on that is not entirely legal."
personalfinance,3dns55,pho1701,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:29:04 2015 UTC,"The safe deposit box is in my name.  They hand me 500 cash each month that I put it in. They know I'm tucking it away.   I am not dependent on my foster parents.   It's not a directly through the state but through a state funded program that I can't say the name of without giving out way to much personal information.   Basically, my fosterparents are now considered my ""Adult living partners"" the money is suppose to be incentive for them to keep their doors open to me.   However, because they love me and I love them, they don't need the money as an incentive. So they use it to help me out."
personalfinance,3dns55,pho1701,2,Mon Jul 20 01:32:42 2015 UTC,"Sounds like the money is a gift and not income. Most of your aid seems to be merit based and not need based. This merit based aid is the most important part of your financial situation, do nothing that potentially compromises it.   You're wasting money paying for a safe deposit box. Put all of the money in a checking/savings account where its accessible and where it can earn interest.  If the IRS calls tell the truth, its not like you actually have a lot of assets they could take, there is no incentive here to consider any crimes (the money laundering advice below is crazy).   If you have to pay a little more money towards your education because you have this on your FAFSA, then that's because the government believes you should contribute more. Roth IRA sounds like the way to legitimately shield this money if you do not need it for emergencies or living expenses."

You can contribute up to $5500 a year to a Roth IRA, which does not need to be declared on your FASFA and solves any worries you have about your scholarship money. The good part about this is that if you end up needing to use the Roth IRA money, you can withdraw your contributions out later."

It's the very first line of the link I posted:   You do not include in your gross income qualified distributions or distributions that are a return of your regular contributions from your Roth IRA(s).   Emphasis mine. Also note that in the flowchart, the language is not ""will be subject to tax"", it's ""may be subject to tax"". This language is important.  Let's look at the Form 8606, where all of this is actually settled:  Line 19 has us entering all our nonqualified distributions from Roth IRAs. If we withdraw early, you and I both agree the full distribution would be nonqualified. Let's say we just want to withdraw $5500.  Line 22 has us entering the basis of our Roth IRA contributions. If we're only withdrawing contributions, then this basis also must be equal or greater than what we put in on line 19. Let's put $5500 here again.  Line 23 has us subtracting 22 from line 21, resulting in  $5500 - $5500 = $0. According to the instructions, we would then skip both lines 24 and 25, line 25 being the line that actually determines your taxable amount. Skipping this line means that there is $0 in taxes on a distribution of contributions from a Roth IRA."

personalfinance,3dns55,rxsda1,3,Mon Jul 20 02:10:12 2015 UTC,"Boy are people making this more complicated than it needs to be.  Your foster parents are receiving this money to help support you.  Since you are living away at college, they are giving it to you as a gift.  You can put that money into your checking/savings.  It is a gift.  It is not taxable income.  As for FAFSA, any money you have in checking/saving will reduce your financial aid by 20%.  If you have $10,000 sitting in a savings account, your financial aid would be reduced by $2000 and you would have to pay that extra $2000 from your savings.  So, for every $500 you are sent each month, $100 would go towards college expenses.  That's not unreasonable.  What can you do now.  Put that $500 per month in your savings/checking going forward.  You should establish an energency fund.  For most college students ~$2000 is probably reasonable.  Considering your unique situation, you might want more than that.  After an emergency fund, you might consider opening a Roth IRA.  A Roth IRA (retirement investment account) could be funded with your earned income.  So, what I would do.  Establish an emergency fund (savings account) of ~$5000.  Bank the checks from working and use some of the cash from the safe deposit to reduce the amount of cash.  Going forward, bank the $500 monthly from the foster parents and consider opening a Roth IRA (using the $500 to cover living expenses to free up money for investments).  Make sure to do your homework about what a Roth IRA is and all that first."

After you leave school they could waive the repayment requirement at $14,000/year (to avoid gift tax).  However, that might be fraud...

You mentioned the word 'investing', so letting it accumulate at best 1%/yr bank interest doesn't really strike me as investing but to each his own.  The only truly off the books idea I had for investing would be to invest in physical things that will appreciate.  Obviously inherent risk as with any kind of investment.. but I think gold/silver do appreciate or at least have in the past (not something I keep up on, just an idea if you wanted to investigate).  Of course there are other things that appreciate in value that aren't gold/silver depending on how you do stuff.. comic books have become big recently.. and there are graded and key issues that can get more expensive as these new movies come out and they gain popularity.. This is one I tested not long ago, bought a graded Marvel Super Heroes 18 (first appearance of Guardians of the Galaxy) several months before the movie came out and now it is worth 3-4 times what I paid for it.. of course this was mostly for fun and not an actual strategy.. I don't see why it can't apply to an actual investment strategy.  I hear similar things happened to the Avengers comic before and after the movie.. with all the movies coming out, it is a gamble but I don't see why it can't net you a profit and no one tracks your ebay/whatever you use sales =)  Anywho, just thought I'd post a different idea for some diversity."

United States Code - Title 31 - Subsection 5324   (a) Domestic Coin and Currency Transactions Involving Financial Institutions.— No person shall, for the purpose of evading the reporting requirements of section 5313 (a) or 5325 or any regulation prescribed under any such section, the reporting or recordkeeping requirements imposed by any order issued under section 5326, or the recordkeeping requirements imposed by any regulation prescribed under section 21 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or section 123 ofPublic Law 91–508—  [...]  (3) structure or assist in structuring, or attempt to structure or assist in structuring, any transaction with one or more domestic financial institutions."

The sort of investment you'd want is something that you can keep in a side business that you don't draw from, ideally if you can have an anonymous LLC.  Maybe something like vending machines where you can keep it flowing and building, and not draw any salary from, or maybe even liquidate the business upon graduation and use those funds to buy a home or something."

personalfinance,3drh1a,1yayboobies1,4,Sat Jul 18 19:17:23 2015 UTC,"I think it will be useful to unpack your concerns by distinguishing between how you will handle filing your taxes and whether you will claim your personal exemption.  What  I mostly hear is that you wish to keep it a secret from your parents that you are earning your cam income. You can do this, I believe.  Whether you are able to be claimed as a dependent on your parents' taxes depends on several tests (age, residence, support among them). It turns out that if you do not provide more than half the cost of your support, and you meet the other tests, your patents can legitimately claim you as a dependent. Read IRS Publication 17 Chapter 3, available as a PDF from irs.gov.  And get this: Your income doesn't matter. You could be earning hundreds of thousands of dollars. But if you do not spend your money in ways that mean you are providing more than half of your support, you could still be a dependent.  The reason I bring this up is that your parents, since they don't know about your job, may naturally file in a way that claims you are a dependent. If this is true, there is no problem. They get to deduct $4000 from their income as nontaxable.  At the same time, if you can be claimed as a dependent, then you can file your own return, but on it you will check the box that says you can be claimed as a dependent (or not check the box that says you claim a personal exemption for yourself). So you don't get to subtract a $4000 exemption amount from your taxable income.   If you file this way, your parents technically would not need to know you are filing and paying taxes if you owe taxes.  So, if you can be claimed as a dependent, let your parents do so. Then, when you file, do not claim the personal exemption (but you do get still a standard deduction amount).  Now, if it turns out that you cannot be claimed as a dependent, why is that? And would your parents know to not claim you? You would have to be spending more than half the cost of your support. Note that your support includes providing housing for you -- if you live at home, the market value rent of your share of housing counts as support your parents are providing. See the Pub 17 chap 3 worksheet for what qualifies in the ""support"" test.  Doing your own taxes is a whole separate subject from the issue of whether your parents claim you as a dependent.  To do your taxes is a little complicated because you are self employed. I think I'd have to write a separate comment about what that would involve: Form 1040, Schedule C, Schedule SE, and maybe Form 1040-ES for making estimated tax payments.  Before writing that, could I ask roughly how much income you think you will have in 2015 all together? This may determine a lot about what tax you face."
personalfinance,3drh1a,wijwijwij,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:43:53 2015 UTC,Thanks for all of your help. It starting to seem like claiming dependent   would raise less eyebrows than independent. Will they know the total household income has increased in any case?
personalfinance,3drh1a,ThatAssholeMrWhite,4,Sat Jul 18 19:52:49 2015 UTC,"Friends you're getting advice from are probably confusing the dependent filing rules. If you are a qualifying child, there is no income cap. Since you're a full-time student under 24, you're still considered a qualifying child.  If you were 24+, your parents could still possibly claim you as a qualifying relative, but in that case there is a hard income cap of $3,950."

Then you can create a set of fake tax pages to give to your parents for their files. Those would not be what you filed.

They would look correct. You don't store the originals in your files; those get sent in. So it would not seem strange that your tax records are photocopies.  Also, many people either download tax forms and print them on their own paper, or file various electronic equivalents. It would not be difficult to prepare dummy returns.   I think it is a ruse best avoided, but it seems like you aren't brave enough to tell your parents what you do to earn money, or you are cowed because you depend on them for housing and schooling."

personalfinance,3drh1a,getitgetithuh,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:27:27 2015 UTC,"Right, ""filing independent"" in this case means claiming your personal exemption, which means that no one else can claim you as a dependent, nothing more.  If you ""file as a dependent,"" you still file your own separate, individual tax return, but you do not check box 6a to claim your personal exemption.  The only way multiple people's financial information can be combined on the same tax return is if you're married filing jointly. Theoretically a 6-year-old kid running a lemonade stand could file his own individual income tax return."
personalfinance,3drh1a,ThatAssholeMrWhite,0,Sat Jul 18 22:02:32 2015 UTC,Good point.  She should ask her parents how they're filing and if they're putting her down as a dependent

I'll have to go see him before they do so he can give me the green light to file independent.   But in terms of privacy, does it matter how I file?  Will my parents know that the household income has increased in any case? My company's name is MFCXY, will it show up on the tax return I receive? Should I file with the accountant that does my parents taxes and be vague about what I do, or avoid him completely?"
personalfinance,3drh1a,getitgetithuh,3,Sat Jul 18 19:35:43 2015 UTC,"Will my parents know that the household income has increased ...?   Be careful using the term ""household income."" This has a specific meaning in some cases. For some government benefits, your parent' income and your income as a dependent might be counted together.   But if you are not a dependent, you have your own ""tax household"" and would not be part of your parents' tax household, even if you live together in the same house.  So, to get back to your question: How do you think your parents would ever find out about your income? You file separately from them. They never see your tax forms. Your 1040 would have a profit number on line 12, and your Schedule C would say you have business income (though you do not need to name your business on that form). Why would your parents ever see this?   I think going to your parents' accountant is a bad ides, unless you think your parents will bevsuspicious if you prepare your taxes yourself. Since your parents cannot do your taxes for you anyway, I do not see a problem. You can just tell them you prepared and filed your own taxes. You do not have to tell them whether you use an accountant or not, and you do not have to tell them you have income. You probably should discuss with them whether they or you claims an exemption for you on taxes, because you can't both do that.  If you have no other sources of income at all (like part-time wage earning job), they could get suspicious, though. If you have no income, there is no need to file. So if you file, they know you must have some form of taxable income.  Are you sure, by the way, that they will disapprove of your entrepreneurial activity as camgirl?"

They're very very nosy, they may just take a peek just for the sake of looking.   In regards to that last paragraph: My parents are over protective, they also think I'm not capable of doing anything on my own. My mom already thinks there's something strange going on in terms of my cash flow because she cleans my room when I'm gone sometimes (no matter how clean I keep it) and sees everything I own.

personalfinance,3drh1a,wijwijwij,2,Sat Jul 18 21:22:05 2015 UTC,"Okay, I am beginning to see the fuller picture.   I make much less than them...won't I count as dependent like always...   You may be a dependent. But it doesn't have to do with whether they make more than you. The major question is whether you pay for more than half your expenses. I am guessing they do. Technically they do not have to pay for more than half your expenses for them to claim you as a qualifying child. It's just if you don't pay more than half. Sounds strange, but read the tests for dependency. IRS Pub 17 chapter 3.   My friend is in the same boat but she filed independent somehow.    Maybe she is paying more than half her own expenses. Maybe she is not a full time student. Maybe she is not living more than half the year with her parents. Maybe she uses the term ""independent"" loosely and doesn't know what it means. Maybe her parents do not claim her as a dependent on their taxes, so she claims her exemption on hers. I don't know why her situation is different. But it doesn't matter for your situation. Ask her what she means by filing ""independent."" She might just mean she files her taxes.   My parents keep my tax records with theirs. They're very very nosy, they may just take a peek just for the sake of looking.    Well, this is the very heart of the issue. This will simply have to stop. You do not want them to see your Schedule C income and Schedule SE self-employment tax page, and you do not want them seeing that instead of Starbucks wage income and W-2 on line 7, you are listing self-employment income and taxes on line 12 and 57.   Indeed, the very fact that you must file Form 1040 (instead of 1040EZ or 1040A) may raise a huge red flag if they are astute about taxes. If you work at Starbucks, why are you not just using 1040EZ? they might ask.  You are an adult, so you should not let them store your tax records. Since your mother snoops in your room when you are out, I recommend you store your sensitive documents someplace else. At a friend's house, or rent a safe deposit box in a bank that only you have the key to. Grow up, girl!  You will have to state that you are doing your own taxes and they are private. End of story. If you can't do that, they are going to see you have self employment income. Then you either tell them or concoct elaborate lies.  Another option, which I do not recommend, is failing to report your income on your taxes and not paying taxes. This has a lot of problems. And it could still cause your parents to be suspicious, since you can't really fake having Starbucks income if you don't really work there.  A larger looming issue is your parents don't think you can do anything on your own. How little they know! But when you decide to not show them your taxes, this reveals to them that you can do some things on your own. I have no idea what tensions this form of self reliance you are showing will cause. That is an /r/relationships topic.  If you want info about how to file your own taxes, I can suggest some steps to take. It might take you half an hour, or maybe an hour the first time."

None of this is new and groundbreaking. He's very good at marketing it though and his books are worth reading and have helped a lot of people. His success does speak for itself in that regard.

personalfinance,3dml2q,William3455,14,Fri Jul 17 14:36:34 2015 UTC,"The only thing you have to do is sell your pickup, there is no way you need that money sucking machine in your life. You have a great reliable toyota which will transport you where ever you want. I don't even imagine the insurance you pay for the truck. The snowmobile is also completely useless, you are in a money crisis, if you don't sell it you will drop out of college then become your younger brother. If you manage to get 15k cash for the pickup you are at 30k + 300 monthly, you should be able to go through the 3 years with that considering a summer job and/or internships. Just don't messed up your college"
personalfinance,3dml2q,ThewindGray,8,Fri Jul 17 20:44:21 2015 UTC,"First thing, sorry about the loss of both of your parents :( Secondly, unless there's other issues you haven't touched on yet, keep your share of the house. Of the things you mentioned buying, the house seems like the smartest thing you did. I would suggest that you get rid of one of your vehicles, unless you truly need two. You can save on payments/insurance that way. Aside from that, obviously never lend money (even to family) if you are having to borrow money yourself. Lastly, did you have a job during the time that you were spending $30k/year? If so, how much were you actually spending a year then? Your house income nets you $300/mo, so that's $3500/year alone. Maybe you need to work on your impulse spending (the fact that you're in your early 20's with more than one vehicle helps illustrate this)."
personalfinance,3dml2q,FeelDT,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:04:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the reply and your condolences. I am glad you said to keep the house. My brothers and I are really close but are now are all moving on different paths. That is why we are now renting it. I don't have payments on either of my vehicles. The insurance is pricey but I don't drive my truck in winter. I'll probably stop driving it since insurance is 180 a month for it. The Toyota is my daily driver since insurance and gas is much cheaper. I don't really feel that selling g my truck will be worth it at least right now since I already invested a lot into it. It is also nice to have a vehicle taht you don't need to worry about breaking down. No I didn't work during those years besides an occasional summer job. This summer I am making 14/hr at an internship. Most of this money has been spent due to the clutch going out in the Toyota. My impulse spending is definitely there. My parents had it and all my brothers have it. I honestly don't know how I spent it all. I think it was a combination of spending money of food, travel, and expenses for 5 years."

personalfinance,3dml2q,yahthatgirl,4,Fri Jul 17 20:50:50 2015 UTC,"A lot of the time I see a thread and it seems like a kinda simple problem to me (aka pay your high interest rate CC), but I think this is actually a lot more interesting problem then to just stop lending your brother money. All three of you have made some bad choices here after coming out of a terrible situation. I think its good you have stuck together and while yes you absolutely have to look out for yourself, having a household that's a 'team' has probably been a big part of how you've managed to keep your lives from spiraling completely out of control. I think you can still help, and should help your younger brother. If you don't, I think his life will never be 'right' and its going to haunt you (in one way or another) for the rest of your life.  *1) Did you buy the house outright or is the house mortgaged? If it was bought outright, perhaps its possible to get a mortgage on the house that can be paid by your older brother for a time, this would return a lot of free cash to your household.   *2) Do you have cars/other assets that can be sold? Are they really necessary?  *3) Explore what kind of additional aid could be provided by the school. Don't give up on your education please.  *4) You're kind of vague about what your youngest brother is doing? Is he just kind of lazy or is he having issues with drugs etc?  *5) Consider your tax situation carefully (you will need help to decide this), your now employed brother can take you and your younger brother as dependents. This could result in your household keeping a lot more cash and allows for some significant education related tax deductions.  *6) Your youngest brother must go back to school/get GED, it is a massive disaster if he cannot do this.   *7) I don't think its wrong to pay for his food, but can your support (you and your employed brother) be contingent on finishing HS/GED perhaps? But don't 'lend' him money for food, household food is a household expense.  *8) Personally I am not a fan of the military or the national guard, and its not something I would suggest in most cases. But if your younger brother is even slightly inclined for that sort of thing, I think that offers some significant value for your situation.   *9) Do you have health insurance? Can you get it subsidized via Affordable Care Act, can your older brother's company insurance provide it? I know you guys are young, but health problems can occur for anyone.  *10) Are there any relatives or family friends that can help you make household budgets and figure these issues out? It isn't that I think you guys are 'children' but someone you trust who has managed these kind of things can be very helpful. This does not mean they are going to start financially supporting you, or that you should ask anyone for that."
personalfinance,3dml2q,DavidDann437,4,Fri Jul 17 18:05:08 2015 UTC,Thanks for the response. I know my situation is pretty unique and my limited family doesn't know how to help. I also appreciate you realizing that I would feel terrible if my younger brother fell off the tracks and got into drugs/alcohol. Those problems are rampant through my extended family.   1) yes we bought the house outright. The only expenses on it are insurance and maintenance. I will keep that in mind about my brother mortgaging it. What are your thoughts on my remaining savings? Should I save it or should I spend it as necessary on school/ expenses.  2) just updated my post about assets  3) j am definitely going to finish school. I get pretty good fin aid already. 2 merit based scholarships (4500) and the pell grant ($5500). The remaining 8k in tuition is paid by me.  4)  my youngest brother is in between jobs. My aunt manged to get him his home school diploma a couple years ago. He just doesn't realize how much a dollar is worth. He has no assets now and cannot hold a job because he gets bored. He is not in alcohol or drugs. Thanks god as that runs in my family.  5) I don't think that will be a better thing than me being independent since I would t get the pell grant.  6)see 4  7)I won't loan him any money. I have also been trying g to steer him into going to school but he gets bored and loses interest.  9) yes i have medicaid through the state. Thank god because my parents insurance doesn't cover me. Thanks America.  10) I suppose I have some cousins that could help get a budget together but they are distant.
personalfinance,3dml2q,prithvisri,3,Fri Jul 17 18:30:11 2015 UTC,"1) $15,000 is a meaningful amount of money, and it will give you the ability to get what you need during school, like a suit for job interviews, food, gas and so forth. If you use all of this money to pay for your tuition today, you will basically have no choice but to take out different kinds of loans to pay for your lifestyle. Basically I see this as, would you rather have student loan at 6% interest, which is ""good debt"" with a massive time line to pay it down, OR would you rather have a maxed out credit card at 25% interest which is ""bad debt""?   Control your unnecessary spending, sell your unhelpful assets (extra cars + snow mobile), take student loans for your tuition, and pay for your life style with your savings, jobs and rental income. I think you should keep the house, but to really make a judgement on that I'd need to know a lot more about the housing market in the area. the kind of mortgage I am suggesting your older brother consider is not the same as selling the house. Do you know if he has a good credit history?   Does your school offer you a work study package? That should be about $4k possible per a year, other part time work should also be obtainable.  2) I know you're attached to the truck, and that you feel you've put a lot in it. But that is not an investment (like the house), because vehicles depreciate, need repairs, use gas, and require insurance. You're basically making a sunk cost fallacy ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs ). I would encourage you to absolutely minimize your vehicle related expenses. You can always buy another truck later when you have a full time job.   3) Student debt is a problem for a lot of folks, but I think you have matured enough given your life experiences that you have a better understanding about the value of a dollar now than most people your age. $8k of tuition per year isn't that bad in the grand scheme, and I don't think it would be unreasonable to take student loans for that. Engineering is a great field for employment and careers, I'm glad you've made a practical choice and you will be able to pay for your student loans later. But still, go to the financial aid folks at your school and see if you can get any need based aid from them. Especially given your situation I think you may be able to cut that $8k down a bit.  4) I'm really thrilled to hear your younger brother is not having issues with alcohol or drugs. It is going to take him awhile to find himself and have any ambition, but I think it could come in time. When I was his age I wasn't interested in doing much but playing video games. It is also great that he has that diploma.   5) You may be right, the amount of grant aid you receive might be greater if you're not your brothers dependent. However, most people will still qualify for some Pell Grant money even if both their parents make decent money. I think this is worth exploring for you and your older brother, but you will absolutely need professional input for this. Pell Grants also phase out and can only be taken for a limited number of years so be sure you will get it for all of your undergraduate years.  ( https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/grants-scholarships/pell/calculate-eligibility ) Merit based aid and Federal student loans should be independent of tax filing status.   However, your younger brother could potentially be your older brother's dependent without those issues, and this would still make your older brother's taxes much more favorable.  I am neither a lawyer nor an accountant, so again I recommend some professional input here.  7) I actually do not necessarily think school at this moment is the right choice for your younger brother. A lot of people just lose money / take on debt who are not ready to complete a degree. Obviously in the long run I'd encourage everyone to have education, its a massive boon to life time earning/job quality/etc. But in the here and now I think your brother just needs to work and contribute what he can. The direct connection between work and money will be more motivating for him now than school could be.  8) You skipped my question about the military as an option for your brother. But I won't dwell on that.  9) Good that you have healthcare. So I assume your brothers do too.  10) What about the aunt that helped your brother out with his diploma? Similar age cousins are probably not able to provide the help you need."

I'm wondering why it's taking you 6 years.. if you are doing well and have a high likelihood of finishing and getting a good job I would say yes, save the 15 and take loans.  Sell your obnoxious truck if you still have it and get something reasonable.  Get a part time job, internships and live like a college student and put all extra towards school/books/fees to minimize loans.  You don't pay rent so it should be quite easy to pay for quite a bit of school yourself."
personalfinance,3dml2q,Its_me_not_caring,3,Fri Jul 17 14:53:51 2015 UTC,I am doing well in mechanical engineering. I have been going to school for 3 years so far because I got an associates degree in a semirelated field but decided it wasnt for me. I managed to transfer all the gen ed so i have 3 more years for my bachelors degree. As far as my truck goes I have put so much into it and its a 2012 now that I'll lose a lot more than I'm willing to part with. I have a toyota echo (pretty much a yaris) that I drive mostly. The house that all three of us bought we still have. We are renting it out for 1400 a month. Our plan with that money is to each take 300 a month from it to help with expenses. We are saving the extra 500 a month in case we need to do anything to it.
personalfinance,3dml2q,ruby_fan,2,Fri Jul 17 15:00:07 2015 UTC,You've already lost the money on the truck. By keeping it you can only lose more. By selling it you can stop bleeding the monthly costs and recoup a portion of the value.

personalfinance,3dng6h,mrorbitman,30,Fri Jul 17 18:19:31 2015 UTC,"This turned out to be a long post, but most of the answers here are wrong.  Student loans use simple interest, not compound interest. However, accrued interest will capitalize (be added to the principal) at set points throughout the life of the loan. For federal loans this happens:   When the loan enters repayment after your grace period End of a deferment or forbearance Change in repayment plans Default Consolidation For IBR/ICR/PAYE*: When you no longer have a partial financial hardship    Basically what this means is your interest accrues separately, but you are not charged interest on that interest until you hit one of the bullet points above and your interest capitalizes (is added to the principal).  If you're on a fixed repayment plan (standard, graduated, extended), your payments are enough to cover the monthly interest, so there's never any interest to capitalize. In general, interest capitalization is only an issue when you are on an income-sensitive plan or in deferment or forbearance because your monthly payments might not be big enough to cover the interest.  (* PAYE caps capitalized interest at 10% of the original loan amount, so anything beyond that won't capitalize)  ETA links to sources"

personalfinance,3dng6h,wolfpackguy,2,Sat Jul 18 00:02:51 2015 UTC,"With any of the income driven plans the interest doesn't capitalize if the annual renewal form is returned on time.

personalfinance,3dng6h,DLiurro,2,Sat Jul 18 00:41:26 2015 UTC,"Right, but if you don't renew on time, you are automatically put back on the standard repayment plan, which triggers interest capitalization. It's a change in repayment plan, even though it's involuntary."
personalfinance,3dng6h,ThatAssholeMrWhite,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:57:06 2015 UTC,"True. But that's actually called the maximum repayment plan or some mixture of standard-permanent, depending on which IDR you were in.

Which you might have to pay for.   But that's completely off the topic."

That calculation is almost exclusively used for savings/investment instruments since it looks higher.  Loan instruments are calculated based on APR (""annual percentage rate"") since it looks lower. This is simply the periodic rate that is applied to your balance. If your loan compounds daily (which is most common), the daily amount added would be your APR/365.

If I read your question correctly, I think you're looking for career advice rather than financial advice. If so, this is my advice:  You don't need to prove yourself for the new job. You've already done it. Otherwise you wouldn't have been promoted. Accept the fact that you're already qualified for your new job and don't make a big deal of it.  Don't let the salary increase make you nervous. If anything, it means you were grossly overqualified/underpaid in your previous position. That's the way things work, you're good, you make your way up. Make no bones about it, you're good and people see that.  Talk to your new manager and tell her you're very honored about your new role and you want to succeed in it. Ask her:   What do I need to learn in my first weeks/months to be effective in my new role. Who do I need to meet and establish relationships with to be effective in my new role. Who would be a good mentor for me (other than her). What does she expect you contribute in the next 3-6 months, and in your first year in the role. Any other advice to be a good/effective member of the team.   Finally, keep humble. And celebrate a little bit.  Oh, and on the financial side: save and invest most of the extra money, as if you only got a small raise."

You're taking a risk that she's not going to make it to the end. BUT if she dies (morbid, but whatever) the loan is discharged and you don't have to worry about it. If she's permanently disabled and unable to work, it's also eligible for discharge (don't know the tax implications of that one though). So the real risk is that she'll want to change jobs, or quit and raise kids, or something like that. But that's a choice that you're making.

In fact, never carry on your person more than you'd be willing to lose.  I live a big city with lots of pickpockets, and I make sure to never carry more than $50 in cash.  The rest of the cash (which isn't that much) is kept in a locked drawer at home.  Most of my money is in a bank account - three actually,1 a checking account that has about $100, a second checking account I use to pay my credit card and other bills, and a savings account with the rest.  I carry an ATM card for the $100 account, and leave the cards for the bills and savings accounts also locked up at home.  This way, if I ever lose my wallet, the most I'll ever lose is $150.  And if I ever have to pay more than $150 at a time, I'll use my credit card, which has zero-liability - if it gets lost or stolen, the CC company will pay me back, every last penny.

That why im asking for help. I want to know whats the best sound investment going forward is.    The reason why i split the loans with my parents is they took half of the loans when i got each of them. Honestly i could take over the payments myself, my parents want to pay their half. Why would i let my parents take half? I was young, they were in trouble financially, and i did not know how badly i would be screwing over my future self.     We can afford to to refinance our house. As long as we continue to save smart for the next year we will have over 20k saved up. So i want to use my money in the best way possible.

personalfinance,3dmrn4,Shake25,2,Sat Jul 18 01:57:58 2015 UTC,"Your analysis is flawed.  For one, ""getting 40x"" is over 40 years. Money you receive 40 years for now counts quite a bit less.  More importantly, counting all his salary as a return from his investment makes no sense. If he doesn't go, he'd likely be able to get some job as well. Salary may well be lower, but the return of going to school is the difference between the two, not the whole salary."

If you could do the same job now as opposed to after the new degree, but it may take two years to get to that point, then the new degree is not worth it. If this will get you your dream job, you are willing to make the sacrifices that having such a high student loan debt compared to your salary will force you to make, and your current earning ability is minimum wage, then getting the degree is a no-brainer.

Also, being a short female who can't do math, read schematics, or lift over 40 pounds trades school wasn't an option for me. I did college, 5600 a year, for two years, paid out of pocket and graduated. Only to be told I need a University degree to get anywhere. I could get an office job in a construction company for minimum wage since I was a female and ""unfit"" for manual labour. To get into most trades programs in Ontario you need to be a sponsored apprentice with an established company- too bad no one really takes on females, especially unionized companies.  So I went to university, am going to peruse my masters, and hopefully work for the courts as a translator since I can speak three lanagues and write four. I'm not saying don't go into trades, I'm saying that I would have hated myself and my life if I had stayed with trades. Sometimes trade school just isn't an option.

personalfinance,3dmrn4,Frozenlazer,2,Sat Jul 18 13:12:42 2015 UTC,"Canada is a bit different, trade school is still cheaper but our universities are heavily subsidized already so it really doesn't cost much. You can fairly easily work and save up then go.   You're unfit for manual labor not because you're a woman but because you can't lift more than 40 lbs.   It's harder to get into a trade as a woman because generally speaking, they aren't as physically strong nor do they have as much endurance.   Canada is also very protected and regulated, it's not a free market. In the USA, you pick a trade, then go on your way, it's not about myriads of unions and sponsored programs (those exist but they are not a requirement)."

Even a part time job with low wages will keep you from having to borrow money for pizza and beer.   I forgot to mention, $60k is what I expect to borrow if I don't work a single day. So if I can work part-time or get a paid internship in my field, that could lower the amount of loans quite a bit.  There is the Public Service forgiveness program, and there is also a student loan repayment assistance program that some federal Departments take part in, where they match your monthly payments or something to pay off your loans faster. Both of these would depend on whether I take a Gov't job or a private job after graduation, and where.   Well since it sounds like you are getting an 180,000 degree, 60k doesn't sound too bad.   That's good to hear, really. The degree itself is something like $95k for two years. Rent and other D.C. living expenses over two years make up the rest. :("
personalfinance,3dmrn4,RGinDC,3,Fri Jul 17 15:28:40 2015 UTC,"Well if half of it is living expenses, at least you have some control over that.   In my experience schools set their ""typical student budget"" (that controls max you can borrow), pretty generously so that nobody gets caught short of funds.   If you are willing to put up with it, could you live farther away from school, and deal with a commute, or in maybe a less than ideal neighborhood?    If you are willing to live like you are flat broke, and work, then you might be able to seriously chip away at that 60k and get it down even more.   Hopefully you're job will also increase your salary reasonably quickly.   60k on 50k of salary will def feel like a burden, but its doable if you make otherwise wise finanical decisions."

If you decide to a little further out (VA or MD) and use the metro, prices can drop. Or if you are willing to live in a studio/townhouse basement apt, those are often cheaper. I live a little bit further out, but my commute is only about 30 minutes and I am saving about $500 per month in rent."

I am expecting to spend $1200-1400 a month for a nice studio in a good location. I would rather pay extra to avoid a commute, which saves my personal time and also saves some money that I would have spent on gas for commuting.  In your case, do you personally think commuting 30 minutes each way and spending money on gas every day is worth saving the $500 on rent each month? I might be missing something important in the equation that I don't realize."
personalfinance,3dmrn4,GW_throwaway69,3,Fri Jul 17 16:07:07 2015 UTC,"500 a month less in rent is actually pretty significant as it would shed 12000 off of your student loan amount over two years. Depending on your interest rate and how long you think you'll take to pay of these loans, that could turn into a pretty big chunk of saved money. For example, with a 6% interest rate and loan payment term of 10 years, you'll save 4K in interest by shaving off the 12K from your living costs.   With that kind of money potentially at stake, I think it's worth it to do a detailed analysis of commuting costs and rent differences between the two places to see just how much money you can save and if that amount is worth it to you to justify wasting your time in a daily commute. Also consider the cost of utilities, parking costs, and the difference in price of food."

Put it this way--there are plenty of people living in D.C. working at non-profits making shit salaries.  Ditch the car.  You will be adding a pretty significant chunk to your loans to sit in traffic all the time.  Between buses, metro, your own bike, and capital bike share you should have no problem getting around much faster than if you have a car.  Live in a group house with other grad students--you can probably get your rent down to around $800-$900 per month.  Also, keep looking for financial aid.  As a vet you should have organizations tripping over themselves to provide scholarships and fellowships.  Lastly, as I'm sure you know...internships and networking.  If your classmates are going out for drinks it's not the time to penny-pinch.  That networking is a big chunk of the value of your degree.

The positions are available in a variety of fields, including consultancy, financial analysts, NGOs, and nonprofits.  An advanced degree also opens you up to basically every three letter agency you can imagine, including the FBI, CIA, DOD, DOS, DOE, and DHS. Many positions within those organizations require an advanced degree to apply. Those jobs pay extremely well, especially for early and mid career professionals.  The field is competitive, as demonstrated by the necessity of an advanced degree, and there is no lack of demand. Especially, like I said, as an IR degree opens you up to opportunities in both the public and private sectors. IR degrees typically involve language training, work in data analysis, econometrics, managerial training, and substantive training in specific policy areas and regions.  You're poo-pooing a degree and a field which I think you don't really understand that much about, especially with statements about how we'll someday earn a decent salary or that 'not everyone is going to be employed by the government'."
personalfinance,3dmrn4,dimino,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:04:57 2015 UTC,"Getting a competitive masters degree today is almost always going to run over 80k+ in tuition alone; if I remember, every top ten IR school is a private school. They do offer funding, but typically only for 25%ish of their admitted students. The difficulty in getting funding is compounded when you realize that the people you're competing against are like the top 1% of students/young professionals in the world.  There are options to defray costs, including working on campus which pays usually something like hourly + tuition remission. That varies from school to school, but in some cases you can get over 50% of your funding taken care of.  I'm not OP, but I had to make a decision between a top 10 private and one of the few (or perhaps only) public in the top 15. I went with the top 15, which will save me a lot, but I still could end up with as high as 70k in new debt at the high end (tuition and cost of living included).  ""No degree is worth a massive financial burden"" makes you sound very much like an old economy Steve. The working world for early career professionals is much, much tougher than it was in the past, and its getting increasingly tougher. The only way to get out ahead in certain fields is with an advanced degree.  Also, even though you say you're not trying to be, you are condescending when you're speaking about these fields. ""Dropping 60k just to survive through school and learning about international policy does not sound smart"". You asked me to research job postings, and I did. Look at the IR grad programs at schools such as Johns Hopkins SAIS, UCSD GPS, or Georgetown SFS and let me know if you think that its just about international policy."

personalfinance,3dmrn4,immanence,3,Fri Jul 17 15:57:24 2015 UTC,"Higher education is most definitely an investment, one with the highest possible rate of return as long as you are getting a marketable degree.    That being said, think of it this way: If you were able to take out half as much in loans as you had planned on and make up the rest by working and paying for it as you go, your return just increased exponentially.  You will still get the same job making $60k, but you will be able to start realizing your investment much faster than if you had to pay back $60k over the next 10 years.    I'm assuming your ultimate goal is retirement. If you were to put that $30,000 you saved into a mutual fund earning as little as 8% interest rather than paying it towards debt, in 30 years it would grow to as much as $300,000.  Imagine if you put all $60k into a retirement account.    Debt is often used out of convenience rather than necessity.  We should all sit back and think about whether the convenience now is more important than future potential before going into debt."

I wouldn't necessarily think about the depreciation value of the car because that is going to happen whether you have a 0% or 3% APR.   What I would do is to compare what you would be paying at 0% interest versus a higher interest of the 60 months. You are saving thousands by utilizing a 0% rate over the life of the loan. Just make sure the payments are something you can handle as the penalties are typically quite substantial.

First, wait 30 days to make sure that you don't have anything outstanding come through. It can be easy to lose track. Then just go into the branch and tell them you're closing the account. The banker may try to talk you into leaving it, but from experience if you're moving and we don't have branches where you're going we're not going to try to convince you to keep it.  Also, as mentioned in other comments if you don't live around the area anymore just call the bank and see what you can do to close the account. Most banks will let you send a signed letter stating you'd like it closed and where to send the money. It helps tremendously if you call before sending the letter, though.

I'd recommend finding a good state school so that you can get in-state tuition. You could even start by attending communtiy college full-time for a year, getting A's in all of the general education courses, then transferring to a state school. This also might lead to some decent scholarships.  Alternatively, you could enter the Air Force and pursue a job that is mechanical engineering related. Steady pay and living expenses and great on-the-job training.

personalfinance,3dny6d,Ubadatmaths,0,Sat Jul 18 06:35:49 2015 UTC,Pay off the CC. This is a no brainer. Credit cards can function as an emergency fund. Paying down your credit on a card allows you to increase your available credit which in turn allows you to charge for things on your card in an emergency. Obviously ideally you'd have no CC debt and an emergency fund but that's not possible. Instead we have to decide where to keep your money in order to survive the emergency and I see no advantages to a positive balance in a checking account (accessible by debit card) over having more credit available on a CC (accessible by CC).  Having $500 more available in your checking account comes at the price of having $500 less on your CC and paying interest on that $500.

I would pay 5k every 6 months since they fee you for every additional payment ($833 payment a month, and i make $1,199 a month), this will leave me a few extra hundred a month for gas and extra car payments. My husband already puts in 400 a month on the land. What we would do is get his savings to 10k and then put the extra 400 that was going into savings towards the land. This isn't counting the money that we are living on that goes to his checking. We never touch his savings so this extra payment wouldn't effect us. And since i never touch my money that can go towards land or other debts too.   In total it would be 15k a year and adding the money that was going into his savings it would be $24600 a year. I think 10k in savings is a good enough emergency fund, and since we almost have 10k each i'd like to put my money towards paying off something.

You also need good credit scores when buying something like a house or a car.

You can run a debit card just like a credit card so they go through the same service and are just as secure. Just like a credit card, you are not liable for any fraudulent transactions and your bank will refund any money you have lost along with any overdraft fees as a result. You don't need a credit score to pay cash for anything and you don't need credit to buy a house.  You can't one with bad credit, mind you, but you can with no credit. Financing a car that's constantly going down in value is asinine. Buy a car you can afford and pay cash for it. No one is impressed with your $30,000 poor investment."

If I never had my 1000$ limit credit card for eight years I wouldn't have gotten that sweet free cash.

personalfinance,3dofom,Fockmeeard,11,Tue Jul 21 05:04:52 2015 UTC,"If you are able to be responsible and maintain self-control, credit cards can be incredible financial tools.  Is it unfortunate that many people find themselves in crushing debt? Yes. Yet the reality is that lenders want to see history of creditworthiness before they lend. When you think about that, it makes some sense. If you were looking for a good return, but wanted to minimize risks as much as possible, and had two people you could lend to- would you lend to a person that had no credit history whatsoever, or the person who has an established credit history that shows they've never missed a payment, even if they've carried a balance?   Credit plays an important factor that can end up saving you thousands upon thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars depending on your personal values and what you wish to purchase throughout your life: Homes, cars, and even renting are some of the bigger examples.  Credit cards offer an easy way to build credit if you're responsible. Other than helping establish your credit history, they do provide other benefits:   Rewards. Currently I get 5% cash back on Amazon purchases, groceries, and gas up to $250 for each category. I also get 2% cash back on everything else with my other credit card. Over time, that adds up. Those are just a small example of what even having just two credit cards can offer. Fraud/dispute help. This is massive. I hope you never have to deal with fraud because of your debit card or bank, but the nightmare stories are out there. Credit card companies offer a giant, well-trained, brutal force that will work for you in case of your cards getting stolen. Often times with debit cards/banks, you end up fighting them.  Other benefits include things like extended warranties and some insurance while traveling. Even things like the extended warranties on your computer or phone can end up saving you quite a bit of money in the long run. All these things add up.   Those are benefits even an average user can get. If you want to see what ""pro"" users can achieve, just browse through /r/churning. You can end up saving thousands on vacations and things like that. Even then, just being an average, responsible user can end up saving you a lot of money.  Credit cards are definitely not the only resource for building credit, but they are probably the easiest. Honestly, you'll have a much easier time throughout your life if you can learn to view credit cards as a tool and use them for your advantage.  And you certainly don't need more than one or two credit cards. I'd recommend two that compliment each other well with their rewards."
personalfinance,3dofom,tbmroark,5,Sat Jul 18 00:15:19 2015 UTC,"Getting a credit card to build your credit is a very good reason. I have religiously paid off the full balance of my credit card every month since I got my first one at 18 years old. Last year, at the age of 31, I bought my first home and was able to get an amazing mortgage due to my 800 credit score. That 800 credit score was from my 13 years of perfect credit card history, since credit cards are the only ""loans"" I had until I got a mortgage.  Another reason to use a credit card is for the consumer protection. If you notice a large transaction on your credit card and you dispute it, you can get that money refunded before the bill is due. That's not the case with debit cards. By the time you see the disputed charge, that money is already gone from your checking account. If you ever want to buy something online, you're going to need either a credit card or a debit card, and using a credit card online is much safer than a debit card. I never use my debit card online."

personalfinance,3dofom,RollerRagerMD,5,Fri Jul 17 23:49:41 2015 UTC,"You're missing a major point--credit cards aren't for spending money that you don't have. What you should do is use them for your normal, everyday expenses, and then just pay the bill at the end of the month. It's exactly like using a debit card, except you have to go through the process of paying the bill. There's a few reasons why you should do this:   Fraud protection. Protection on credit cards is much much better than on debit cards. Unless you're using all cash all the time, you're better off using credit (and Paying it off each month, I will keep reiterating that)   Edit: I forgot another good point! Some cards give you access to some cool benefits. Like if you buy a flight with your card, some will give you travel insurance.    Building credit for future home purchase. Again, just use it for normal expenses, pay it off, and it will benefit you a lot when you eventually go to purchase property. Rewards. Using credit just like you would a debit card, and spending within your means can result in a lot of freebies.   Credit is just safer than using a debit card, as long as you don't spend money that you don't have. I honestly don't understand why some people don't use credit. Obviously if you're a compulsive spender, credit cards can be bad. But if you're capable of making and sticking to a budget, they're your best friend."

That's a better return than I get from a stinking CD, savings account, or any other fixed income option right now.  If you need a loan a cc is the worst way to float expenses, so if you can't handle not spending yourself into debt then best to stay away.  CC is just a tool, all about how you use it.

Let you hang on to your money longer - it's better to have your money in your control for a longer period of time. Let's say I lost my job, I know now I need to stop spending beyond essentials and perhaps considering not paying the full balance. Yes, this is what emergency funds are for. But paying a bit of interest may make sense in some situations compared to drawing down an e-fund or having to make the choice between a full CC payment or the mortgage.   Rewards - these can be very lucrative. I've taken 3 roundtrip flights just from airline miles earning from opening a few cards. That's probably $1,000 right there.

If you mean that merchants raise the prices on actual products to account for their fee paid to VISA or MasterCard, and don't give a discount for using cash, then find a place that sells the same items at a cheaper rate.

(most CC however, have gas at a higher cashback reward.)  lets say gas is $3 a gallon, and you need 40 gallon a week. that is $120 per week. or $6240 per year.  if you spend cash or debit card, $6240 is..... well...... $6240.  If you use the CC however and get the rewards portion of it, you get $62.40 back per year.  Of course this is simplified and some rewards has 5% back and such.  also, there are many CC with custom needs. for example, travel, and hotel stays along with car rental programs. if you are in business for example and travel frequently, you basically get free $$$$ since most likely your company is paying for the trip and all and you just swiping your card for rewards.  The only reason why people go into debt with CC is   they think ""oh i have ""$X"" amount of money now"" when in fact, its only credit, meaning you dont own that money just yet They get caught into problem 1. and the APR keeps hitting than they get stuck in problem 1 and 2 on another purchase   and keeps snowballing from there until they realize what they are doing, and rebudget"

It is mind boggling that we live in a society that refuses to acknowledge that a person can have financial responsibility without a credit score. If I don't need a credit card, its because I can pay for my own goods, and I don't need a middle man. I am forced to establish some form of good credit because I would be refused a loan? A good mortgage? WHY? Why can't I negotiate a larger down payment and establish that I am financially responsible because I have. More. Money. I don't understand this system."
personalfinance,3dofom,CommondeNominator,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:57:55 2015 UTC,"The middle-mad protects you, like many others have stated. The only time my bank account (which is actually my money, whereas a credit card is like a tab at a bar where fraudulent charges can be dropped BEFORE you pay for them) is exposed to anything is when I pay my credit card statement online or the occasionaly ATM withdrawal (which, with proper planning, can be avoided altogether). Other than that, all swipes, types, and other forms of purchase are done with credit. This way, if my card gets stolen and charged up $4k, I still have the money in my bank account to pay the costs of living, while the credit card company deals with the fraud. If When the same thing happens to your debit card, you're out your 4 grand for possibly weeks while the bank decides whether it wants to believe you and refund the money. Rewards points, purchase protection, return guarantees, extended warranties and sign up bonuses are all just icing on the cake! Why not take advantage of them?  You can have more money and still be financially irresponsible. Banks are managing risk when extending credit. You walking up with $200,000 cash to put down on a mortgage doesn't tell me anything about how that money was accumulated or how you've dealt with finances in the past.  For all I know, you had a lawsuit that settled for $2.5M, 6 months ago, and pissed it all away but your $200k and now faced with that reality, you want to secure a loan for a house to raise your kids. NDA from the proceedings would prevent my finding out about that through research, plus if I'm a bank handling millions of customers I'm not going to fucking google every person to find out about their credit worthiness, the credit bureaus keep track of that for me and I pay them for their services of providing me with your record of being financially irresponsible -- your credit report.  Or maybe you inherited it from your parents after their estate was settled. Your parents hated you because you were a fucked up junkie who couldn't hold a job, but they didn't make a will and so you got the rest of their wealth as only next of kin. The list goes on, but I think I (and many others here) have made their point. Banks have no reason whatsoever to trust your ability to pay back the loan unless you've proved it already in the past.  The problem isn't the credit scoring system, it's a lack of formal education about how to be responsible with credit and personal finance in high school. Many enter college or the workforce with no idea how to manage money and stay out of high interest debt, until they're forced to learn by pleading their case to strangers on the internet.  You sound like you have a chip on your shoulder, and I'm sorry for whatever happened to cause it. But aside from paying something with outright cash, or not buying it at all,  you have to prove you're likely to pay back the debt. This isn't something that can be done overnight, it takes years of little small wins to achieve a great credit score, and years more to back it up with a thick file. If you're willing  and disciplined enough to do this, you can borrow money cheaply that would otherwise take years to accumulate, and in the case of the housing market, even earn money on that debt in the form of equity, which adds to your wealth."

Yes its fine that you can show you are financially responsible by this point system, but its insulting to me that if I don't use/build credit it doesn't prove that I have good or bad credit; which let's face it means I am assumed to have poor money managing skills. I have never gone through a personal experience that has to do with credit, but I find it overwhelming and strange that so many people around me are telling me I need to have someone else purchase my goods so that I can then pay them.

personalfinance,3dofom,CommondeNominator,0,Sat Jul 18 03:48:11 2015 UTC,"Having no credit isn't bad, and it's certainly better than having bad credit. If you had a bunch of closed accounts and chargeoffs sent to collections, you've proven you don't pay your debts on time. If there's nothing on your record, you're just a blank slate. Nothing personal, and you're not assumed to have bad credit; you're simply deemed a risk not worth taking.   Unfortunately, the banks are not in business to do good deeds. They're worried about their bottom line, which is put at risk when they lend to someone who they have no record of, financially speaking. Sure, they could  hire someone to look at your bank statements and skewer over your whole life to see if you're a good person, but your interest money is just not worth that much to them. It would take a teams upon teams of humans to perform such a task on the multitude of customer loan requests they get. A computer can decide on a vast majority of applications at the rate of millions per second, but there has to be a standardized scoring mechanism for them to do so (at least for now, but when computers become smart enough to research any and all financial info on an applicant without a standard rubric, I think we have bigger problems than FICO scores).   There's nothing wrong with paying cash (or debit) for everything, and many lead a fulfilling life with no credit history, and nobody is forcing anyone to build a credit history, regardless of how many people tell you you need to. But if you ever want/need to ask a bank to borrow money, you have to play by their rules, and that means proving yourself a good investment to them long before asking for money."

But at the end of the day, the strongest backing of your responsibility is a 3rd party that has no inherent investment in you as a person saying ""Yes, we give them a high score because our records show a high degree of responsibility when given conditional loans"".   It might be a problem for some people, but for the vast majority of those who go in with a plan in their heads building credit is a non-issue."
personalfinance,3dofom,oompaloempia,0,Sat Jul 18 06:39:24 2015 UTC,"You're not missing anything. In some countries, there's no such thing as a credit score (at least not like the American one where you need to at some point have debt to get a good score) and not a lot of rewards programs. Almost nobody uses credit cards there.  Still, if you live in a system with that concept of a credit score and with rewards programs, you should use it. Sure, it's a dumb situation but it is reality and if you ignore the facts you'll just pay more."
personalfinance,3dofom,PenilePustule,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:33:02 2015 UTC,"this is exactly true.  businesses increase their prices to cover the increased fees that the credit card companies charge them, which in turn are charged to cover the costs of giving rewards back to credit card users.  if you don't take advantage of rewards cards, you're just paying higher prices and subsidizing the rewards given to other people who do use them"
personalfinance,3dofom,jimmy_gd_fan,0,Fri Jul 17 23:50:57 2015 UTC,"I use them for the cash back and other benefits. As long as you pay it off every month, its free money. I would never use them as financing for a big purchase. There's also the online security features and things like travel and renters insurance that are included when you use the card. As long as there's no annual fee and you pay it off every month, there is no downside. It takes incredible self control to use them wisely, but when done they make money."
personalfinance,3dofom,rnelsonee,0,Sat Jul 18 00:03:57 2015 UTC,"but the idea of taking on debts you don't need just so that you can prove you don't need them is just... dumb.   A credit card isn't a debt. Buying something and not paying for it is what gets you debt, and that hurts your score. Buying stuff never helps your score. But you're right there is a bit of a twist there - and that is that in order to trust that you're worth lending money to, lenders need to see a history of you handling credit accounts. But the most responsible/frugal people in this world never use credit accounts. But, it makes sense - would you rather lend money to a friend who has borrowed money in the past and always paid it back, or to someone who has never borrowed money before?   Mint tells me that I should have twenty two credit cards and loans in order to maintain ""excellent"" credit?   Agreed that 22 is a high number, but not mandatory for an excellent score. My score now i (800+) is higher than it was when I had over 22 credit accounts. But I was surprised I had over 22 at some point and apparently have 16 now. But most of those 22+ were student loans - one per semester. Plus old store cards I never used, like Target or JC Penny. Also, that includes closed accounts. I only have 5 open now for example, but 11 accounts closed in the last 7 years.   and as far as I can tell, these programs exist purely to tempt you into getting a card that will enable you to end up ass-deep in debt   Well yeah, but it's not a trick. Less than half, and closer to 1/3rd depending on what study you look at, of households with credit cards carry any debt. So it's not some trap, it's just a numbers game. As long as the credit card companies make more off the debt carriers than they pay out to the non-debt carriers, they'll make money and will continue the practice. There are lenders who market to poor people on purpose, like payday lenders. They deserve scorn.  But anyway, big reason #3 is convenience. I use my card daily, and I don't have to go to banks or ATMs, I don't have to keep part of my paycheck when I cash it in (how my parents got cash before ATMs) and all vendors/amounts are recorded so I have free and complete tracking."
personalfinance,3dofom,ucacm,0,Sat Jul 18 00:27:03 2015 UTC,"You've over simplified #1, but #2 is pretty much spot on.  As long as you pay your credit cards in full every month, the rewards are free money and you will improve your credit score."
personalfinance,3dofom,foodnguns,0,Sat Jul 18 00:36:30 2015 UTC,"One  noted reason is credit > debt cards in terms of fraud protection  Oh someone drain 10k from your debit-bank okay were on it,3 weeks later nothing  oh someone drained 10k from your credit card-okay your good,them goes to their fraud department find our 10k!"
personalfinance,3dofom,bloonail,0,Sat Jul 18 00:42:54 2015 UTC,Credit cards make total sense for lots of people. If you have a decent income and no one in your immediate circle demanding cash equity is increasing around you. Paying off every month isn't difficult. Then the rewards programs kick in with real value and the little things that credit cards provide work. Its easy to rent things. 4 star hotels are simple. It works.   Few of us have that discipline. Many that have it are compromised by family and friends. That's why its such a good deal for the credit card company. Everyone thinks they'll be good- few are.

Most people come on this sub because their parents have taken out loans/credit cards in their names without them even knowing. But it's an easy mistake to make; most people trust their parents and wouldn't expect them to betray them in this way.  Why does an unemployed, debt-ridden person have cable anyway? Your mom has a serious problem, which you've unfortunately enabled unintentionally.  If you want good credit and don't want to report your mother for fraud (which is what she committed), you're probably going to have to deal with the debt collectors. The good news is that if you negotiate properly you won't have to pay anywhere near the full amount. But frankly the idea of you having to spend money/time fixing your mother's mistakes is pretty disgusting.  First things first, tell the debt collectors not to call you anymore and to only communicate by mail. Ask them to validate the debt and send it to your address. Record any phone conversations with them; although you should consider only communicating through writing.  Stop giving your mother any money, you can't continue having things in your name, giving her money and having her blatantly fuck you over by not making payments. None of that stuff should have been in your name in the first place."

You might have a case if you had been a minor and addressed the issue immediately after you turned 18, but water under the bridge.  You simply have to accept that these debts are yours now. You signed up for them. It sucks, but that's where you are.  As suggested, start negotiating and see what you can get from these companies/people you owe money to.  Good luck to you.

Each of those will run your credit, then reply to the dealer if they will accept or reject the deal.  The dealer will, in turn, have several options to present to you as the buyer. % rates, length of term, down payment, etc.   Companies expect you to shop around for the best rates, so all those hard inquiries will just count as one.  Generally, all inquiries for a specific type of loan (auto in this case) will count as one within a 30 day time frame.   I bought a used Corolla recently, 9 hard pulls showed up from that deal."

personalfinance,3dpasm,dequeued,3,Sat Jul 18 04:16:10 2015 UTC,"If they vest immediately (as soon as you put your money in, they match and you get to keep their contribution regardless of if you quit), then yes, absolutely, it's free money.  Lets calculate that for a minute.  Say you get paid 50k, then 3%*50k= 1500$.  You put in 1500$, they put in 1500$; that is a 100% return on your investment, aka a no-brainer.   To put in into perspective, and then go to the extreme:  you could take a $1500 loan for your normal expenses, put in $1500 in contributions instead; wait until after tax season, then remove all $3000.  You'd get hit with a 10% penalty from the IRS for early withdrawal (300$), then pay taxes at 25% (750$), and you'd still have: 3000-300-750= $1950.  Pay back the $1500 loan (plus some interest), and still have nearly $450 in your pocket.  Now that's an extreme PITA, so just keep all the money in the 401k, but it illustrates that this is free money.  While we're calculating, lets get to that total return, assuming you could find a way to go without 20% of you salary for the year.  50k * 20% = $10,000 We already calculated that you get $1500 from your first $1500 contributed. So that leaves the $0.50 per $1 you contribute above the 3% mark:  $8,500 * $0.50 = $4,250  All told, you put in 10k, they put in 5,750.  That is a 57.5% return on your 10k investment.  You really can't beat that, it's an awesome plan.  Here is the equation:  ( ( ( X * 0.2 ) - X * 0.03) * 0.5 ) +  X * 0.03 = X * (0.1 - 0.015 + 0.03) =  X * 0.115   It boils down to multiplying your salary by 0.115, this is how much free money they are giving you, an 11.5% raise.  Make it happen."

I had a 1 bedroom, 1 parking stall, no ac apartment for about 1200 a couple of years ago.  If you want to purchase property there make sure you understand the difference between fee simple and leasehold property. Basically with leasehold you own the building but you're only leasing the land for a certain amount of time. That contracts transferable so if you buy a leasehold property which lease is up in 2 years you'd be on the hook to re-lease it or if you're lucky buy the land outright. Which is going to be alot more than what you paid for the house. And if you don't the owner of the land can reclaim it, most likely leaving you without a home and still having a mortgage to pay. With fee simple it's like everywhere else in that you own the house and the property underneath.  Oh and definitely budget for your electric bill. At least set aside 300 a month for it. The price per kw/h is dramatically higher there than in the mainland. For instance the amount of electronics I run day to day cost about 70 dollars a month somewhere like Maryland (with central air) while in Hawaii my bill would routinely be around 350 (with just a single fan I only ran while I was home).

They are supposedly specifically designed to be easier to administer. There's a good chance you know this, but I thought I'd make sure.  As someone who is covered by a SEP IRA, there are pluses and minuses. (Bear in mind that I haven't had a 401(k), so I'm not so familiar with your plan. On the plus side, I get a straight 10% contribution from the employer (which my impression is way above almost any 401(k) match even if you max it out), though you as the employer will get to set the amount. (It has to be equal for everyone in the company, by my understanding, and probably has to be higher than a 401(k) match would be because of the drawbacks.) I also administer the IRA, so I opened mine with Vanguard. Or I could have done Fidelity. Or whatever. On the minus side, I can't elect to contribute any of my money, which leaves me well short in terms of total $$ invested of the $18K+match that someone with a 401(k) has available, and that leaves me to look for other outside avenues. (Made worse because I can't contribute the full amount to a Roth IRA, and then the SEP IRA counts as a traditional IRA, which means I can't do a Roth backdoor without converting and paying tax on the SEP portion of the conversion.) 401(k)s also have stronger legal protection in lawsuits and bankruptcy.  But the SEP/SIMPLE IRAs are designed to be easy to set up and administer for small businesses (or even solo operations). It's an alternative to consider."
personalfinance,3dprar,evaned,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:12:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! I did indeed at the SEP/SIMPLE IRA's, however the problem is that the employer is EXTREMELY cheap. It has taken me years for them even to consider this. SEP means employer has to contribute enough for the employees to care about it with no matching, and immediate vesting. Turnover is frequent enough this would not work. Similarly, for the SIMPLE, the immediate vesting of a 2 or 3% match probably won't go over well either. 401(k) matching is optional (which sadly may be the only way to have this work) and allows vesting periods which would also be a huge selling point for the employer.

I did my research and ended up going with the Simple IRA via Vanguard.  Yes, the employer has to pay match 2% of all employees or 3% of contributing employees. But starting up and maintaining a Simple IRA is cheap and easy. Going the 401k route you have to make sure you are continually in compliance. This takes up time (and money). You'll need to figure out if this is worth it.  Your post didn't really make it clear. Does your employer not want to match contribution or did they want vesting period options?  Anyway, since you asked. Dream 401k:   Access to diverse and low (not inflated and no load fees) expense ratio funds, such as Vanguard and Fidelity.

Both of these bullet points lead to ... In-plan Roth conversion.   This makes a couple assumptions, namely that you are in a position to put away > $18k in your 401k and your plan includes decent investment options with low fees making it worth investing past the pre-tax max.  If both of those hold, then you really want your 401k to support in-plan Roth conversion (ideally at least quarterly, but minimum yearly).  Pre-tax contributions give you a tax benefit immediately.  Roth contributions have tax-free growth.  After-tax contributions have neither.  Which is why you want to be able to convert them to Roth ASAP, so that they get the same tax-free growth."

Usually what it will say on a car purchase contract is that if the buyer is unable to take delivery of the vehicle or arrange financing/insurance for any reason that he/she agrees to pays the dealer for some fees + a fee for mileage put on the car.    I think what will likely happen though is that he will just have to pay the dealer fees.    Can I ask why he was having regrets?

For now this will likely mean maxing out your Roth IRA and contributing to a traditional taxable brokerage account for the rest.  Think on the order of $5500/yr in the IRA ($458/mo) and an additional $2750 ($229/mo) into the taxable account.  Vanguard's index mutual funds and ETF's are very tax efficient so you won't have a big tax hit.  What you do with the other money is up to you, of course. Should there be higher priorities than skydiving? Car replacement? Student loans? Emergency fund? House down payment?  Make a budget and allocate a reasonable amount for you to use having fun.  You'll be on course with your big goals and still enjoying yourself.  I'd love to go heliskiing in the Alps every winter, but it's too expensive and would prevent me from achieving higher-priority goals. I have to settle for skiing locally with the very occasional trip to someplace nice. Maybe skydiving is the same for you."
personalfinance,3dmy5t,Smug_Jerk,2,Fri Jul 17 16:18:42 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the reply!  15% seems very reasonable.  The only reason why I asked if it would be a bad idea to defer contributing for 1-2 years (to enjoy my hobby) is because I'm in relatively good shape.  I paid off my student loans in full last year. I have 0 credit card debt (or debt of any kind), and my credit score is above 750. I also have about 6-7k in savings.  Would it be completely stupid to defer contributing for a year or 2? Or is the next 12-24 months extremely crucial to my retirement at age 24?"
personalfinance,3dmy5t,Smug_Jerk,8,Fri Jul 17 16:25:39 2015 UTC,"Doing the math, no, 2-years is not the end of the world.  It is perhaps a bad habit to get into, though.  Lots of people think ""I'm young I don't need to save now. I'll start in a year or two."" And that year or two is always next year and they never get around to actually doing it.   Life happens. ""I was going to start saving this year, but I have to save up for an engagement ring."" ""I was going to start saving this year, but I have to save up for a house."" ""I was going to start saving this year, but I have to save up for furniture."" ""I was going to start saving this year, but I have to save up for the new baby."" ""I was going to start saving this year, but I have to save up for little Jimbob's college."" ...And on and on and on.  My point is that you should pay yourself first and make your retirement savings your baseline.  Any money leftover in the budget after that goes to whatever else you want it to go towards. Your savings come out on top of everything, not whatever's left at the end of the month. If you base your finances around paying yourself first you don't accidentally end up living beyond your means."

Assumptions: You end this year at age 24 with $2750 in your taxable account and $5500 in your Roth IRA. You never get a raise or start using a 401k at a different employer. They never raise the contribution limits so you contribute $5.5k to your Roth IRA's forever and, just for funsies, contribute an additional $2.75k to your taxable account. You get the 80-year market average of 7% returns. We ignore any taxes and fees. This is a back-of-the-envelope calculation I whipped up in 45 seconds.

It's hard to value something that has kept you from being depressed. The power of compounding interest means every dollar you save will be worth so much more (it's great that you are thinking about these things at age 24), but if you're not around to spend it because you get depressed and/or blow money later on something even more expensive, then it was a fruitless pursuit.

I then take the rest of whatever I'm making and have fun (after establishing an emergency fund).

There is a 34 day free trial, and free online classes (where they give away 1 copy each class!) to teach you how to use the program.

My response is based on the idea that you can cover monthly cost, if you didn't have past due balances. Please comment if this is incorrect.    We made a list of all past due amount and marked them as debts. These amounts were added as separate items on the debt snowball.  Then we made a budget as if we were only paying the current months charges for bills (like electric, gas, water, cell, CC, etc). This budget was done every payday on paper before any spending was done. When all current bills were allocated and necessities (groceries & gas) were covered, the remaining money was used to start paying off the overdue amounts. She just started at the top of her list and worked her way down. Every dollar got a name. This is called Zero based budgeting  You can do this.

personalfinance,3dnuip,ekcunni,3,Fri Jul 17 20:48:14 2015 UTC,"Rather than try to start budgeting you need to figure out what you need to spend money on and how important these things are. First, Sign up for mint or some other expense tracker. Figure out how much you typically spend on food and other consumables. Write down what your monthly bills are as you get them and see how much they are.   With a month or two of this data, start prioritizing your expenses. How much do you need to survive (food, shelter, transport to work)? This should be the core of your budget. How much do you need to make minimum payments on debt? This is priority two. Whatever is left from your income you get to decide what to do with. Pay down debts? Invest for retirement? Save for a house? Do something fun?   I would start with priority one and two for awhile to get started with budgeting. Try to only treat expenses as fires if they fall into priority one to try to avoid incurring more debt--being late on a credit card payMent, for example, is better than going hungry. Then start dividing up what is left over as you get better at budgeting. The important thing is to just START... It takes everyone awhile to get into the groove of budgeting!"

personalfinance,3dpmfp,I_COULDNT_SLEEP,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:46:26 2015 UTC,"If the car is accepted as collateral, the bank will want to know the value of the vehicle. As it will differ from the amount borrowed, they will ask where the rest of the money comes from, and (depending on local laws) you generally do need to tell them. If there were two possible loans against the same one collateral, they might refuse.  The smaller the loan compared to the value of the collateral, the happier generally a bank will be. However, cars devalue quickly, so that is why banks aren't too happy to loan money for them.  If you can get your hands on 6k, I would advice you to buy an older / smaller / cheaper car from the money you have for around 4k, spend some on maintenance, and not take out a loan."

Originally, I wanted a loan for something that was closer to $5K, but no bank would approve a loan for such a small amount.  It may be better for you to do something very similar to that, and then just make a huge first payment and go from there."
personalfinance,3dpmfp,iheartloudmusik,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:52:05 2015 UTC,"The down payment only reduces the amount of money you're financing which is why it is cheaper in the long run and down payments are recommended.   Unless you're getting something out of a down payment...I would take out the loan for the full amount and than use that ""down payment"" money for one very large first month payment.  This will reduce the overall balance on the loan which you are taking out which will look great on your credit reports.  Now...The fundamental question of your situation you should be asking...""Why do car dealerships want a down payment"" .. ""Are they really concerned for my financial well being?"" Maybe Yes...most likely No. Every bit of cash the dealership can get from you is money made that day and adds to commission for the sales rep more than the loan amount will yield.  Here's where having a down payment puts you in a position go barter. They want it...you don't need to do it as you have the other option which I described earlier. Start negotiating...  ""I can do a down payment of X amount if you are willing to throw in a six year service contract"" etc...you can negotiate all kinds of things.  Good luck. Typed this on my mobile."

Your obligation to pay back your lenders would persist indefinitely.  That being said, while you didn't mention the countries involved, generally this approach can be a viable option.

If you still want the 2015 luxury truck in 2018, go ahead and buy it for 45k.  I tend to keep a google doc of large ticket items I want to buy, with the date I added them to the list and the expected cost.

This way, you cough up that extra 20% to fill the Roth IRA fully. You don't yourself send it to the IRS. The 401k administrator, by doing the withholding, has sent 20% to the IRS.   At tax time, then, you'd learn whether that 20% withholding was too much or too little, but the effect on your tax situation in April would be limited.  http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Plan-Participant,-Employee/Rollovers-of-Retirement-Plan-and-IRA-Distributions  Don't miss the 60 day deadline or you pay an extra 10% penalty."

Now make another one for if you end up getting a house and be sure to include property tax.  In this second budget, have a scenario with daycare cost for your child vs losing an income.  Set aside more into savings to build up a larger emergency fund in case something goes wrong with the house.  See which one makes more sense.

If you really have to, get the cheapest house you can possibly tolerate.  It isn't just about what you can afford the payments on. Once you're in a mortgage, it'll cost you probably 15% of the price of the house to get back out (real estate agents are around 11%, and you need cash for a zoo of other fees and costs). That means you need a minimum of around $20k in either cash or equity to get back out of a $135k house. If you don't have that you're going to get seriously screwed if you need to get out.

personalfinance,3dph6v,GarrettAkers,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:58:54 2015 UTC,"As far as % dollars spent, I don't have much advice.  Make a budget that includes unexpected medical bills, life insurance (both you and your wife) and disability insurance.  I can't stress this enough.  If you are a professional, many professional organizations (ASME, IEEE.... ect.) offer excellent insurance options.  Once you have a solid budget you can follow that has the proper insurance safe guarding your family, then you know how much house you can afford.  I'm sure others can give you some guidance, but you seem to already know what the authorities in the entertainment business suggest and I can't say it's not good advice.  I do have some other thoughts.  I'm a handful of years ahead of you and have many coworkers in similar situations that frequently discuss our options.  The time your wife is spending with your child is priceless.  To take that away so you can have a nicer house right now is not the best choice unless you are forced to do it.  The emotional robustness a child develops from having a strong parental bond is a life long shield.  While preschool can very advantageous for a child (few days a week for four hours a day), having a person making minimum wage corral your child with a bunch of others 40 hours a week is just not going to be as good.  Plenty of kids do just fine with daycare..... not trying to hate on parents that have to take their kids to daycare, just in your context it's worth mentioning.  Generally the defining moment as to where you live (short of gun shots going off) comes when your child starts school.  You will be very sensitive to this detail when your child is about to start school.  This is an excellent time to buy a house in the school district you have become acutely aware of.  Right now you may (or may not) have a friend named bubba that tells you the school his kid goes to is great and that's the extent of your research..... not a good approach.  Why not save and defer this decision a few years?  This gives you a few advantages.  You can get your budget working smoothly and realistically saving the differential between rent and mortgage.  You will become more aware of where your child will be best served from an education and peer group perspective.  Much better to buy the crappiest house in a good neighborhood/school district, than the nicest house in a bad neighborhood.  People define good and bad differently so you have to really look at your values and what you want for your kids.  Some people want to completely keep their kids away from poor people (not me) and others want their child to experience a real cross section of the world.  You will have your own definition of what good and bad is and need to figure that out.  I wanted my kids attending a school with higher reading proficiency and math, but also ""real"".... not a private school that excludes disabled children and makes claims of being the best even though they have hand picked students that were going to do well anyway.  I taught one of my kids to read at 4.5years using the book ""teach your child to read in 100 easy lessons"".  This is a direct instruction methodology and the author is a distinguished education researcher.  My kid is now happily reading and has plenty of other peers that are very proficient.  Since I bought my house in the wrong area, I have to drive the kids to school.  The school by my house has very few students above proficient with most well below proficient.  The peer group does matter, but it can be problematic on both ends of the socioeconomic spectrum.  The true cost of a house is very elusive.  Right now you pay rent and utilities.... that's it.  You don't have to worry about a large repair bill.  If you buy an older house, consider that the electrical, plumbing, insulation, windows all may require upgrading and maintenance sooner than you think.  It's best to write down a list and estimate the money you will need to spend on the house over the next 20 years.  This can be comparison criteria.  The following examples are not meant to scare you away, rather make you aware of them so you can consider/compare.  In the next 20 years expect to pay 10k for a roof, 2k on hot water heaters, 5k on air conditioning, 10k to do cheap remodels on  two bathroom, 10k for a cheap remodel on a kitchen.  What about emergencies?  The moral of the story is it's not hard at all to spend 25-100% of your mortgage amount on repairs, remodeling and maintenance.  Also this can suck up an entire decade of your life if you get an older fixer upper....I know :(  My advice would be to estimate when, what and where you would spend money on this house and come up with a monthly savings amount to accommodate your needs.  not having money to keep your house in good repair can be really depressing.  heated and cooled space is expensive storage.  If you know the size of your eventual family, buy enough house with a small amount of margin.  The house will be cheaper, the taxes lower, the maintenance less, utilizes less energy.  A decent yard for the kids to play in and a good size storage shed can compliment a smaller sized home and you won't be heating and cooling your Christmas decorations and other things you would store in your big house.  The size, taxes, maintenance and ultimately cost of your house will play a roll in your financial flexibility and ultimately your retirement funds.  A modest three/four bedroom family home in a good school district will sell very easily allowing you to have flexibility if your life circumstances change.  A large funky floor plan house next to F rated school won't be as easy (although cheaper if you are buying).  Few thoughts on house selection: 1.  a decent sized kitchen with good ergonomics (read about kitchen ergonomics if you don't know). 2.  two living spaces (one with excellent natural lighting) so your house can accommodate more than sleeping and one person's activities. 3.  Decent construction (bake lite electrical box all broken? Aluminum wiring?  stucco falling off?) 4.  Sleeping areas that have some distance from your neighbor's barking dogs 5.  Stay 5 houses away from a four lane road (two each direction) and 3 houses away from a two lane road (one each direction) 6.  flat roofs suck 7.  a cul-de-sac is worth extra money as long as head lights are not sweeping your bedroom window frequently  A house that is 50k more can much cheaper in the long run if somebody has done quality renovations, landscaping, and improvements.  The time and money that can be spent on these things can be ridiculous, so a little OT or an internet business to make some extra cash to get a house in good condition may be preferable to ""I'll fix it all myself"" and then you learn you will be spending more than that 50k.  Look for somebody who has over improved the house they are selling (they have spent much more than the house is worth) and profit from their effort while helping them get moved."

To create a line break, either put two spaces at the end of the line or put an extra blank line in-between lines. (See Reddit's page on commenting for more information.)  I have attempted to automatically reformat your text with fixed line breaks.  Your text might contain incorrectly formatted list(s). To format a list properly, add a space between the bullet points and list items, and add a blank line before the start of the list.     As far as % dollars spent, I don't have much advice.  Make a budget that includes unexpected medical bills, life insurance (both you and your wife) and disability insurance.  I can't stress this enough.  If you are a professional, many professional organizations (ASME, IEEE.... ect.) offer excellent insurance options.  Once you have a solid budget you can follow that has the proper insurance safe guarding your family, then you know how much house you can afford.  I'm sure others can give you some guidance, but you seem to already know what the authorities in the entertainment business suggest and I can't say it's not good advice.  I do have some other thoughts.    I'm a handful of years ahead of you and have many coworkers in similar situations that frequently discuss our options.    The time your wife is spending with your child is priceless.  To take that away so you can have a nicer house right now is not the best choice unless you are forced to do it.  The emotional robustness a child develops from having a strong parental bond is a life long shield.  While preschool can very advantages for a child (few days a week for four hours a day), having a person making minimum wage corral your child with a bunch of others 40 hours a week is just not going to be as good.  Plenty of kids do just fine with daycare..... not trying to hate on parents that have to take their kids to daycare, just in your context it's worth mentioning.  Generally the defining moment as to where you live (short of gun shots going off) comes when your child starts school.  You will be very sensitive to this detail when your child is about to start school.  This is an excellent time to buy a house in the school district you have become acutely aware of.

If he is kicking you out, then he should be providing some money to help keep your world together.   You need a lawyer who specializes in divorce.  You're not stupid, but you're going to be going through a rough time. Maybe you'll have to sleep in your car or at a women's shelter for few days.

However,  I understand your point from an objective point of view...we've been together 5 years, married for 3. Safety isn't an issue.  He was a professional when we met and I had (and still have) a low wage occupation.  I have a prepaid yoga membership so if I stay in my car, or at home I know I can shower there etc in the mornings.  He said I have to leave tomorrow. I think I should try to stay for a pay period and try to line something up, despite it being uncomfortable. I do shift work and I run so I think I can avoid him for a lot of the time.

Whatever brokerage  is holding your shares should have some kind of website that you can use to sell them. They are all different.  You will have to pay taxes on your capital gains I.E. how much more money the stock is worth than before.

I want to sell some of them when I can, and keep the rest as a future investment, but I don't know how, how to automate it so it sells at a certain price, etc.   So if they're options then you need to execute the purchase at the strike.  Then you'd just put in a limit order at whatever price you want to sell at.  If you already have the stock then you just need to sell.

Wikipedia for reference.  As for when to sell, I'm in line with /u/0xdefec, holding the stock after the lockout is only sensible in the personalfinance sense if you really strongly feel that the stock is undervalued and that its true value will be recognized by the public on a reasonably short time scale. If you're ambivalent or negative on the company, it would probably suit you to sell as soon as you can and swap the money out into an investment you're more comfortable with (like everybody's best friend, low-cost diversified index funds)."

And the federal interest is capped at (I think it's currently $2500?) for deductability, though hopefully you're not paying $2500 a year in student loan interest. If you are, though, Massachusetts lets you deduct whatever is paid over the $2500.  Also, Massachusetts gives you a deduction if you rent. I think it's half the total of your rent, up to $5400...? Don't quote me on the exact number, just throwing it out there if you are a renter and didn't know that's a deduction. (It doesn't apply to all states, so some people don't know about it.)

A piano degree isn't required to teach or play the piano, if you're good you're good. It's purely based on talent and skill. Don't switch fields until your first debt is paid off in full. Then save enough money and go back to a cheap community college, that should be under 20k.  If you want the degree ASAP, and aren't willing to wait until your other debt is paid and you have enough savings, you will have to take the loans and be in school. Once the grace period ends however you might have the ability to do an Income Based Repayment plan and keep your payments very low while you work and study."

personalfinance,3dmsry,mx54,2,Fri Jul 17 15:23:04 2015 UTC,"I am from Asia and working in the US on a visa.  You should definitely still contribute to the retirement plan! In the US, it is tied to the company you invested with (i.e. Vanguard) not the company you are working for. You will still be able to access it at the appropriate age regardless of where you may be.   One thing to change from the usual advice on this sub is that you don't need to put money into a Roth IRA. The reasoning here is that you will be outside the USA when you want to access the money, and thus you will have no income and thus pay no taxes when accessing it."
personalfinance,3dmsry,cubicrokey,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:07:08 2015 UTC,"So hypothetically say I dump $20,000 in a vanguard over the course of a year only (and continue to opt out from my work's retirement plan), and then leave it untouched for 40 years after leaving the US, will I still get a decent return, and there won't be any penalties from retrieving it elsewhere in the world?"
personalfinance,3dmsry,cubicrokey,2,Fri Jul 17 16:21:45 2015 UTC,"When I meant vanguard, I meant your company's retirement plan. If your company is giving any form of matching, you should take up to the highest match.  It is an index fund so it will basically follow the stock market's return rate. There are no penalties, just make sure you file the appropriate US paperwork at that time."

personalfinance,3dmsry,LLJKCicero,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:43:33 2015 UTC,Exactly. Just keep good paperwork on where your accounts reside and you should be golden.

To start out, Id contribute to the employer match and work on building up a comfortable, liquid savings account. Then pay off any debt.   In general: https://i.imgur.com/fb7Dtmh.png  If you were to max your 401k every year (assuming no employer match, and the limit stays constant relative to inflation) you will end up with 2.3 million of today's dollars at age 65 which will net you $95,000 of todays dollars per year forever (4% withdraw)"

Investing is not risk free. If you have a risk-free investment that returns over 4%, I'd love to hear about it.  The point is, it's entirely possible for someone to invest $45,000 in, say, the S&P and end up with just $25,000 five years later and still have a $45,000 loan payment with funds due every month.

Technically the nominal value of your investments will eventually increase but once you take into account inflation, taxes (which ignore inflation) and the compounding rate of interest on your 4% student loans, plus things like the debt affecting your ability to borrow money at other times and suddenly, it's no longer risk free.  Not to mention, what happens if, a decade later, you get in a car accident and someone sues you. You can file for bankruptcy protection but that doesn't matter for student loans - they still want their money, even after the bankruptcy court took all of your cash that you had in index funds."

You're right, if his are under 4% it would be better to pay mins and INVEST the remainder. He can't afford to consume with the debt levels he has.

He isn't saying he's going to be paying $75 a month towards it but instead of putting $500 he might do $200-300. You're still paying it off fairly aggressively while being able to go to a random concert, movie, or go out drinking here and there. I understand were you're coming from but damn I would never want to be you, sitting at home while you're friends go do stuff together."
personalfinance,3dhuxq,19Jack91,16,Thu Jul 16 23:56:33 2015 UTC,"Comments like yours are what make people not want to visit this sub.     Surely it's shortsighted to pay minimums on your loans in favor of day to day spending and gratification?   You're suggesting that this is going to hurt long term which is DEFINITELY NOT THE CASE with all student loans.     in favor of day to day spending and gratification?   The fuck are you talking about?  This money can do MAJOR things for life, not ""day to day spending"".   Think new home, new car, new vacation, new pet, whatever else.      Also, why is it that ""living life"" means ""spending money?"" Breaking away from that assumption is one of the main tenets of this sub.    We all have to pay rent.  We all have to eat.  We all have to get ourselves places.    Further, this sub is about financial responsibility.  If spending for enjoyment isn't a part of that for you, that's YOUR perogative.   Some of us want to be financially healthy while still enjoying life to the fullest (rather than simply worrying about the numbers we see in our bank account) and SOMETIMES living costs money.   Ever been to Europe?  Africa?  Asia?    I have, and I wouldn't trade my student loans being paid off for any of that."

If you have positive cash flow and are at least paying down your debts, I see no reason to limit your spending unless it's to achieve a specific goal (house, retirement).

Debt is a financial tool that is used by all and it's healthy.   It's all about balance as well. If I pay my student loans off over 20 years while having a personal work-life balance that makes me happy what is wrong with that? If I go on vacation and have experiences now while you save your money and pay down your debt and then have those experiences later, what is the difference?"
personalfinance,3dhuxq,Bensav,5,Thu Jul 16 22:53:07 2015 UTC,"Because one day you might want to do something different, you might hate your job and want to punch your boss in the face and walk out, you might want to go to school and retrain, move across country, be a stay at home parent or allow your spouse to be.  If you spin out paying off your debt you are committing to have to make $x every month.  For me being debt free gives me great peace. I can live for a while on very little because I have no payments. My wife is going to take 2-3 years off, go to school and raise our imminent child. If my business fails it's a bummer but not a disaster. If I want a new career I have time to think about it and make good decision.  When I had monthly payments I felt like a rat in a wheel."
personalfinance,3dhuxq,Buildncastles,5,Thu Jul 16 19:30:01 2015 UTC,"I agree with all that you're saying. It is incredibly freeing to be able to do whatever you want whenever you want.   On the other hand I don't see people having debt as an incredibly bad thing or that they're terrible people or that they're financially inept. There's a balance you can almost certainly achieve. Be the most liquid as you can, have a padded savings account, etc."
personalfinance,3dhuxq,Bensav,2,Thu Jul 16 21:09:39 2015 UTC,"Me neither, I love being debt free. I also understand I could end up better off if used some leverage.  It's a personal choice. I don't hate people with different views to me."

personalfinance,3dhuxq,nl93,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:45:17 2015 UTC,"I don't know why all these down votes, mostly, I like subs like /r/personalfinance because people usually have sound arguments, they just have different perspectives, investment profiles or life priorities... Which are all fine. Personally, living in debt would be a greater burden than working 60 hours a week, so I completely get your point. I do understand that for some people - for perfectly valid reasons like health, family responsibilities and others, that's not the case or even a possibility. Regardless, I think a debt-free life and all the actual freedom (and quality of life) that it entails is one of the general goals of this subs."

Is that worth it? Yes.  What about two years?  You can pay off a lot of debt in a couple of years and never have to do it for the rest of your life and you don't have to sacrifice ""living life"" to do that."
personalfinance,3dhuxq,wewilltry,2,Fri Jul 17 16:00:03 2015 UTC,To each his own. I certainly see a lot of articles talking about how people lived fairly bored and frugal for two years to pay off all their debt. It's just a personal sacrifice I don't feel is worth it.
personalfinance,3dhuxq,BurnedOut_ITGuy,3,Mon Jul 20 19:59:56 2015 UTC,"I am spending the next year or so living this way.  But in a year or so, I will have no house payment and no debt.

personalfinance,3dhuxq,0_000,3,Thu Jul 16 19:22:41 2015 UTC,"Yep.  Life is about balance.  Living to ""retirement"" is not guaranteed for anyone. There is a spot in between reckless financial frivolity and super-scrimping-scrooge. Someone working their way back from the brink of financial collapse certainly needs to reign it in... a lot and might do well to even impose a moratorium on non-essential spending.  But at some point we all have to decide how we are willing to live for the long term.  Deprivation and misery sucks big time after a while. Ergo:  something in between."

personalfinance,3dhuxq,ben_bakon,3,Fri Jul 17 06:09:00 2015 UTC,"but it's more fun to live life   Of course that is more fun. Nobody wants to spend time paying bills and shit like that. Instead everyone wants to travel, buy houses, start families and live the dream.  However, you cant do that if you are constantly broke. I am going to interject my own personal opinion/experience, but for me all I can think about is paying off my student loans. They're a huge weight on my mind and the sooner I pay them off, the sooner I can live life and have fun.  I am not sure how old the OP is but I am going to assume he/she is in their mid to late 20's and recently graduated from school. If I am correct, they will have plenty of time later to travel and do all that fun stuff. I think becoming debt free should be their main concern right now."
personalfinance,3dhuxq,wewilltry,2,Fri Jul 17 16:22:14 2015 UTC,"If you spent 80% of your pay check on loans, you're broke anyway. Having liquid and being in debt and being broke and in less debt are two very different things in terms of your livelihood."

personalfinance,3dhuxq,dark_roast,2,Thu Jul 16 18:04:09 2015 UTC,"OP - on top of making whatever additional payments on the student loans you can swing, depending on the APR you have now, you might want to look into refinancing. 45K is a pretty large sum, and a lower APR could save you thousands over the term of the loan."
personalfinance,3dhuxq,doublezerozero,28,Fri Jul 17 00:04:05 2015 UTC,I am not from the US so things might be a bit different.   Shouldn't the decision if to pay off the student loan be based on the interest rate on the loan?  IMO if the student loan rate is at a smaller % rate than if you put the extra money in some type of funds/bonds than you should invest the extra money as the difference in the rate would be extra money for you.   Obviously - i am super simplifying things.
personalfinance,3dhuxq,IfWishezWereFishez,21,Thu Jul 16 18:32:44 2015 UTC,"You're right.  I have some federal student loans as low as 2.8%.  I have no intention of paying those off early.    The other big difference is private vs federal loans.  Say there's a worst case scenario and I end up unemployed long term.    Private loan companies want their payment on time, every month, regardless of circumstances.  Also, most students (like myself) have to get a co-signer for a private loan.  In my case, it's my mom.  I wouldn't want to have to worry that I'd miss a payment and hurt my mom's credit.    Federal loan servicers, on the other hand, are required to work with you.  In the case of unemployment, I can call (or just submit paperwork online) to get a deferral or reduced loan payments.  This isn't optimal, since interest continues to build, but it is a possibility if I need it.    So personally, I'll pay off my 3.3% interest private loan before my federal loans, some of which have interest rates as high as 6.8%."
personalfinance,3dhuxq,AJKiii,7,Fri Jul 17 06:36:29 2015 UTC,"In the UK our student loans get wiped at 50 if we haven't paid and we only have to pay back a percentage of our salary over £21,000 a year.  If someone earned £22,000 a year, they would pay back some percentage of £1000. The first £21,000 is student loan payments free."
personalfinance,3dhuxq,Crispyshores,2,Thu Jul 16 13:57:29 2015 UTC,Think its 9%.  I'm on the old system so it's 9% on earnings over 16k but I'm pretty sure that percentage didn't change with the new system.
personalfinance,3dhuxq,GW_throwaway69,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:12:41 2015 UTC,"The US has a similar situation. You can file for Income Based Repayment here, and they can only take a % of your income.

personalfinance,3dhuxq,onefreehour,13,Thu Jul 16 14:17:51 2015 UTC,I've always been told the best investment you can make is paying off your debt.  Example my Student loans range from 4.5% to 6% interest rate.  I'd be hard pressed to find a secure investment that's going to return more than 6%.
personalfinance,3dhuxq,tjandearl,10,Thu Jul 16 17:46:55 2015 UTC,"Depending on where you are at in life it's hard to justify paying a 6% loan off in force.  if you are secure with a home and a car and an emergency fund to keep you going, i'd pitter on student loans.  It's debt that isn't going anywhere, can be deferred for several years in an emergency, and won't be expunged in bankruptcy.  it sucks to look at that balance but my 401k has been beating it every year in interest gained on my money percentage wise so it's been better to max out retirement savings.  I could also pay my student debt off in cash or by liquidating belongings today too, which makes it more comfortable to defer paying it off these days."
personalfinance,3dhuxq,mags87,2,Fri Jul 17 05:39:50 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I am getting a sign on bonus for a new job that I'm starting, and if I put it all towards my student loans my payments only drop $100/month. My plan is to use the bonus as a down payment on a house early in 2016."
personalfinance,3dhuxq,makaveli121,3,Thu Jul 16 14:07:45 2015 UTC,"One should also consider capital gains taxes when making this comparison, at least in the US.

It's really a no brainer for me to pay off my wife's loans before throwing it at a stock market at all time highs. Down to 45k remaining from her 150k grad school loan total..."
personalfinance,3dhuxq,johnlocke95,3,Thu Jul 16 14:24:44 2015 UTC,"Right, but my remaining student loan is at 2.8% interest and I am in no hurry to pay that off."
personalfinance,3dhuxq,onefreehour,3,Thu Jul 16 15:49:31 2015 UTC,Then don't.  If you scored an interest rate like that then by all means pay the minimum.
personalfinance,3dhuxq,johnlocke95,2,Thu Jul 16 17:22:52 2015 UTC,Every student should have. The federal government gives 5k per year in student loans at that interest.

personalfinance,3dhuxq,NetSage,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:19:20 2015 UTC,Yes and no.  Good mutual funds with a decent amount of it going to stocks will outpace interest rates.

I ended up purchasing the extended warranty but returned it a month later - so my monthly payment  stayed the same but my principle was reduced.

personalfinance,3dhuxq,Call_me_Deth,5,Thu Jul 16 18:36:17 2015 UTC,"While student loan debt is still debt, it's not the kind of debt that comes from irresponsible spending (credit cards) or living beyond my means (car loan of 10K). that is one thing I've taken from this sub, along with the motivation to eliminate over $6,000 in just under 18 months.  I'll start tackling my private student loan next. But finally being able to have an emergency fund and not feel like I'll have to pull from it for help paying a bill is really, really nice :)"
personalfinance,3dhuxq,FormerGameDev,8,Thu Jul 16 19:29:48 2015 UTC,I agree with what others have said.  Good job on your progress!  Student debt will follow you for a long time even through bankruptcy so make sure you handle it.  I have a family member who only paid the minimum and now he and his spouse are over 100K in college debt!
personalfinance,3dhuxq,Call_me_Deth,7,Fri Jul 17 04:14:28 2015 UTC,"Sorry but this doesn't add up to me. In no way will ""paying the minimum"" result in more student debt than you started with. This isn't revolving credit we're talking about here... They have fixed payment plans.   Also, to add to the overall discussion, student debt is what most lenders and banks would consider ""good debt"".  While they do take it into consideration when buying a home or a car, they aren't penalizing you for it like they would consumer credit card debt. I have roughly $45-$50k in student loan debt (I rarely look at the balances) and started my first job out of college at $51k last year.  While my income could sustain a rapid loan payoff, I'm really in no hurry... It makes no sense for me to shovel hundreds each month into those accounts because I will have those loans for 10+ years anyway. I have priorities NOW like a house, 401k, etc.  I set up automatic payments for my student loans and I don't even think about them.   Credit card debt is the real problem.  Aside from some medical expenses, a house, or a car.... Don't buy things you can't pay for, up front, THAT day... Usually they can wait."

In my case, having 2 friends who do HVAC for a living is really nice.  Not to mention I have a carrier (brand) so that fucker will run almost forever with regular maintenance.  I also have to mow my own grass and shovel my own snow.  Anyone using those as reasons to rent instead of buy are just fishing for excuses, though."

I don't think I'm real hip on the idea of getting potentially stuck with a 40k item that I can't unload.  But even if we got $0 back on it if we decided to sell it in 5 years, we'd still break even to the rent.    i guess, the big problem, is what if we decide to do something else in sooner than 5 years.. i guess that's where the big issue would be.  ... and it would be basically the same issue, if we had a regular house, and decided to move elsewhere in a few years, wouldn't it?"
personalfinance,3dhuxq,atl2ptown,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:08:34 2015 UTC,"A mobile home was a consideration I had because they seem so much cheaper.

Kids are probably sooner in my future than later, I've got a stable career with zero chance of being transferred, and most importantly - fuck dealing with shitty land lords, shady rental agencies, common walls, rising rent, and the million other headaches that come with renting.

It isn't that sexy, but having 3-6 months of money in a CD or some other safe / liquid account might save you if something were to go bad.   After that you need to balance your plans for the short and long term. It is good to get the tax benefits of an IRA, and if you can start investing now, that is huge in terms of benefits coming from compounding. However, that money is also not touchable until you get to retirement, so if you want to use it for something like buying a house, car, etc. you will need to pay huge penalties - like 35%.

personalfinance,3dpb8y,ANGR1ST,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:46:05 2015 UTC,"Is there a way to refinance my SOs student loans?   Those sound like Federal loans, so the only way to re-finance is to convert them to private loans through a consolidation. That's going to be credit based. So it's likely they're not going to qualify for much lower of a fixed rate. They may get a lower variable rate, but now you're taking on additional risk that the rate might go up.   If so, are there any major disadvantages in doing so?   YES You lose all of the flexible income based repayment options provided with Federal loans. You might not need IBR or PAYE when you're making $80k/yr ... but if you lose your job you're sure as hell going to want them. Same if you're injured. There's also a death discharge, so if the borrower dies the loans make no claim against the estate. Private loans will. So you'll need to carry additional life insurance to cover that bill.   What rate should we realistically be shooting for?   I wouldn't personally make the conversion unless I was saving more than 2% and retaining a fixed rate. And even then I'd probably want closer to a 3% drop to take the risk.   We want to aggressively pay down the loans at $2k per month, increasing that once I graduate in 2 years and have a full-time job. Shooting to be completely debt free in approximately 5 years (besides purchasing a home).   I don't think that $2k/mo is really all that aggressive. Every $10k at 6.8% costs about $120/mo on a 10 year plan. So your payments should be in the ballpark of $1500/mo. Not sure how much that extra $500/mo trims off, but I'd be very surprised if it got you all the way down to 5 years."

The Shares are intended to provide institutional and retail investors with a simple, cost-effective means of gaining investment benefits similar to those of holding euro.

personalfinance,3do3aq,keepmybonesx,3,Fri Jul 17 21:14:21 2015 UTC,I don't want to really extend the loan term   Ask the bank / credit union to refinance for 24 months and see what kind of rate you can get.  Just call them up and tell them you are looking to refinance your auto loan.  They will guide you through it and answer any questions.
personalfinance,3do3aq,ronin722,2,Fri Jul 17 21:32:59 2015 UTC,Most places will not refi a ten year old car however.
personalfinance,3do3aq,RanthersReallyRuck,3,Sat Jul 18 02:16:29 2015 UTC,You’re going to pay another $700 in interest for the 24 months.. Most of your payment at this point is going to principal. If you refinanced you might get a better rate but a 24 month loan at 6% for $5k would be payments of $221. Not much savings to be had I would just work harder at paying off your loan quicker or continuing your monthly payments until its over.

You may have a problem if its book value isn't at/above the 15k you owe.   You can lower the payment by extending the loan timeframe. Move it out to 48 months and your payment is now around $332 at 3% interest (not sure what rate you can get).   When I refinanced my car a couple months ago it cost me absolutely nothing. The credit union took care of the title fees with the state.   We really need to know the interest rate the current financing is at in order to help you more. Also, what was the price your mom bought it for and the loan term? Sounds like it was 72 months."
personalfinance,3dp7bx,three_horsemen,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:57:04 2015 UTC,"It was for 72 months and the original financed amount was $30,529.63. ill try to find out the interest rate."
personalfinance,3dp7bx,three_horsemen,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:06:53 2015 UTC,"No need, that's enough info. The interest is right around 4.2%. That's not terrible, but you might be able to do a little better through refinancing. New cars can go below 2%, but with a 2012 you might not get that rate.  If you refinance at 48 months your payments will be in the low $300s. That means extending the term out another 14 months, which isn't a great idea if you're banking on making minimum payments. You don't want to be stuck making repairs on a 7 year old car that's not paid off. However, I think if I were you I'd refinance at a longer term anyway and make extra payments each month. A bank might be more willing to give you a lower rate if you do this, since it looks like more interest for them. That way you can relax if cashflow problems arise. Plus, there's not much to lose since a refi probably won't cost anything."
personalfinance,3dnq4m,blooburries,8,Fri Jul 17 19:33:03 2015 UTC,"Two good options:   When you get your monthly statement, pay the full amount that it says to pay (not the minimum amount). Hook up your checking account to your credit card and set up automated payments to pay the full amount each month (same amount as if you do it manually in #1).  Note that it takes a billing cycle or two for this to start working so you may need to make one or two manual payments even after setting this up.   Note that when doing either of these, you may still have a balance afterwards, but those are charges from after the end of the statement period and they will show up on the next bill.  As long as you pay the full statement balance, you won't have any interest charges.  This video explains in more detail:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYK5GA4uYwU"

personalfinance,3dnq4m,rnelsonee,4,Fri Jul 17 19:48:20 2015 UTC,"From what I gather, the statement balance is money from last month that I didn't pay?   Yup.   I'm just very confused on to which balance I should pay and when I should pay them.   The typical way to do things is pay the statement balance in full by the due date.  Say your billing cycle is from the 1st-31st of every month. In July you charge $100. On August 1st you charge $10. Sometime in early August you get a bill for 71-7/31 for $100, which is your statement balance. You current balance is $110. Likewise, say instead of spending $10 on Aug 1st, you paid off $40. Your statement balance is still $100, since that's locked down and printed on paper, but your current balance is $60. As long as you pay $100 by the due date (which will likely be 8/21 or later) you're fine (so in the latter case, just pay $60, since you already paid $40). In the first case, where you charged $10, the other $10 effectively won't be due until 9/21 or later."
personalfinance,3dnq4m,aquarieuse,3,Fri Jul 17 19:40:07 2015 UTC,"Oh I see now! The statement balance is the leftover from last cycle, and the current balance is the statement plus anything else I've charged?"
personalfinance,3dnq4m,deltarefund,2,Fri Jul 17 19:46:19 2015 UTC,"You got it!   Like others have said, you should always pay off the STATEMENT balance before the due date. You can even (usually for most cc companies) pay it in increments through the month, as long as your payment total = statement balance by the due date.   I always initiate the payment through the CC website instead of from my bank. The reason is that if you initiate from the website, as long as the payment date you set is on/before due date, it's not going to count against you if they withdraw or the payment doesn't clear until the next business day. Whereas if you initiate payment from your bank's bill pay, there might be a delay in the cc company receiving/posting the payment, which could lead to late fees and interest charges."
personalfinance,3dnq4m,_sunnysideup_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:26:30 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Your billing cycle might be from 1st to 30th of the month, but after the cycle is due you have X # of days to pay the bill (which you might receive in the mail if you're set up for that - might be good to do so you get used to the idea.)  So on the 30th you'll get a balance due which will be anything that you charged between the 1st and 30th. Then there is ""current balance"" which will include the previous balance as well as anything you've charged between end of billing cycle and the actual Due Date of your payment.   Does that make a bit more sense?   You'll want to pay your ""balance due"" (not minimum!) that shows up on your statement.  Keep in mind that the $500 limit is TOTAL, not a monthly limit. So that time between end of cycle and when you pay your bill, you cannot go over $500."

Far outside of the kind of money a 18 year old can make part time. Instead of trying to build trivial savings, you need to focus on how to get into the best college and medical school you can get into, and with a scholarship to both if at all possible.  Its not that I don't think you should invest spare cash, or not work some small jobs in college. But you're on a mission, and included in that mission is going deep, deep into debt. You should maximize your study time for all your classes, especially the ones that will be tested on the MCAT. You should volunteer at clinics and/or hospitals.  Investing is important, but it should not be high on your agenda right now."

Plus investing whatever money you can earn with a 'large return' would imply making risky investments that may actually lose money.  Again making sure your undergraduate grades and standardized test scores are impeccable, and that your volunteer experiences are relevant are all far more important than the small amount of money you can earn right now."

Even if you are a good investor and you turn $1000 into $5000 over the next few years, that will hardly will even make a dent in the total cost of attendance. Chances are you'll need that money for something before medical school anyway.  Medical school tuition is at least $50k a year, and it will be higher by the time you finish undergrad (at least 4, maybe 6 years from now). That does not include the cost of living at all.  You cannot earn enough today to cover a meaningful portion of years of living expenses while you're in medical school. If you work 40 hours a week to build significant savings worthy of investment, you're not going to be dedicating enough time to your studies or the volunteering/research that is important for admissions.  If you have different money that was saved for your college tuition that currently does not have to be used in full because of your undergraduate scholarship, than that money could potentially be invested.

If you are a contractor it is possible that your employer pays zero percent of the premium and they stick it all to you.  It is odd that they added more when you added a child. Most plans are like Employee, Employee + Spouse, Employee + Kids, or Employee + Spouse + Kids. But it doesn't matter how many kids you have 1 or 10.   Its hard to swallow now, but imagine if someone got cancer and instead of having to pay out 120,000 you paid 3k.   The tough part is that EVENTUALLY we all tend to end up with something major. So in a way you can think of insurance premiums as just spreading the cost over your entire life.   Depending on how much you use in your healthcare, you might find that the other plan saves you money. Esp since those usually offer an HSA. YOu just end up having to eat a 150 dollars to goto the doctor with an earache instead of 25 bucks. And even though the out of pocket maximum might be higher, the deductible usually isnt that high. So you would have to end up in a major situation before you get hit with 12k in bills.   If you have questions, let me know, I'm pretty knowledgeable on this stuff.

personalfinance,3doy2f,HannahBanshee,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:40:56 2015 UTC,"What should have happened:  You were a household employee. Employer should have paid you and sent some withholding in and given you a W-2. Google ""nanny taxes"" to read about what the employer's responsibilities are. You would have used the W-2 to report your income on your taxes on line 7.  What instead happened:  Your employer told you to be an independent contractor, establish an EIN for your Schedule C, and for him to use to give you a 1099 form indicating how much you were paid. Doing that, he hoped to avoid paying part of ypur Soc Security taxes, Medicad taxes, and possibly unemployment. He presumed you would report your income on line 12, abd use a Schedule C and SE to compute and pay Soc Sec and Medicaid taxes.  Questons I have:  Did employer send or give you a form 1099? This is something he would have filled out. If you really were a contractor he would not have to do this if total paid to you was under $600.  Was it your action to file SS-8 to ask IRS to clarify your work status? Their letter may simply be asking you to show them whether you got a W-2 or 1099. You might have gotten neither. These forms are not something you fill out. One would have been filled out by employer, but I am not surprised if he didn't.  How did you handle reporting the income on your taxes fpr 2014? What was the total amount, and did you have other income? Which form did you fill out? Or did you not file because you didn't think you earned enough to?  Possible resolutions:  You might just give up, amend your taxes to treat this as self employment income, paying the SE taxes and income tax. If you don't owe income tax, your total tax due would be fairly limited. What was your total income earned last year, and amount from this gig?  You could continue to persist with the ss-8 process and then be sure you paid appropriate tax (or got refund). The IRS would get half of the Soc Sec and Medicare taxes from employer, and possibly penalize him for wrongly classifying you."

I did not receive a 1099 from my nanny employer. What do I file for self employment? I'm going to call the irs Monday because I would rather have him deal with this but I would like it to be over with. Quite pissed off on how irresponsible he is & used my lack of knowledge on the matter to his advantage.
personalfinance,3doy2f,wijwijwij,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:23:07 2015 UTC,If I were to go through and classify myself as a self contracted employee (which I'm clearly not) we both run the risk of being penalized due to tax evasion
