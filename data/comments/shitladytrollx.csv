shitladytrollx,3cm72d,NicerInPerson,7,Thu Jul 9 12:11:14 2015 UTC,"I had some weight gain when I first started it, I noticed that I was craving snacks more often. since it was just at the start of when I got the shot and hadn't made any other changes, i'm assuming that's what it was related to.  but i just adjusted my caloric intake down to a deficit and then maintenance level and i was fine. i still feel like i need to eat more often, but i don't just stuff my face all day.  the 25+ weight gain thing amazes me tho. that seems excessive."
shitladytrollx,3cm72d,MissDarling92,3,Thu Jul 9 00:26:22 2015 UTC,"So I've had some ""fun"" experience with medication and weight gain.  About five years ago I was put on some very strong meds as I was having a hard time managing my OCD by other means.    It fixed the brain issues but I gained 100 pounds and also earned myself a little side dish of tardive dyskinesia.  (Fat, twitchy, and unable to stay conscious is always a hit at parties...) [I lost it all and then some, don't worry.]  The medication did not change anything with the way food is processed, it completely destroyed any willpower I had revolving around food.  I could NOT stop eating, I had almost zero mental control over it.  I'd eat in my sleep.  I'd eat and not remember it and eat again.  In fact, one of the side effects of this particular med (besides becoming fucking spastic) is type-2 diabetes.  For reals.    So, it was the medication's fault, but the change was in appetite related behavior, not some magical quality of physics denial or metabolism rearrangement.  I think the depo issues are a milder version of this, where it doesn't actually do anything to you except change appetite.  If someone isn't prepared for that, and/or has been managing their weight successfully by ""feel"" they may not realize that the increased appetite is not a legitimate body signal.  For us, getting hormone-hungry a few days a month and maybe over-eating a little bit probably isn't going to be a big deal because we're aware of it and balance it elsewhere.  For someone who doesn't think about it, their little bit of increased appetite may add up to some serious gain if it's indulged ""just a little"" every day.    Like the folks who are smart and never learn to study thus getting steamrolled when they hit college..."

I questioned her, saying something along the lines of well don't most types of birth control have that side effect, and she said that Depo was the only one proven to have a correlation or something like that. Dunno what studies those were but I didn't want to risk it.  I got Nexplanon instead. I experienced a month long period at first and my first bit of back acne, but otherwise it's been great. I have gained a little weight since starting it, but I acknowledge that is because I've been eating worse and don't blame it on my hormones."

While it didn't make me gain weight, I did have some crazy chocolate and carb cravings which was a bit strange for me. Nothing a bit of willpower, moderation and staying active couldn't handle! I chose to stop it after my first shot because I got one particular side effect that was rather unpleasant(you can pm me if you wish to know but this is my main account so I don't really want to post it!). I would have definitely kept using it though, I'd recommend giving it a shot(heh) as everyone responds differently and you won't know until you try :) I feel like it's mostly just another one of those things where fat women are given an inch, and they take a mile.

shitladytrollx,3cm72d,Notthrownforaloop,5,Thu Jul 9 13:39:55 2015 UTC,"Depo did make me gain weight, yup about 25 lbs in less than six months... like crazy shit. my hormones are pretty off the wall though. Pcos, unsightly body hair,  and I need to be on some type of pill bc, without it to help regulate my period I start getting fainting spells.. so maybe I'm a bad example.   The not losing it part though,  fuck that shit. Just go hard at the gym and change your bc if you start getting fat. Not rocket science!  Side effects other than that, major irritability & mood swings, irregular periods.  *using the progesterone only pill now, I like it, periods are kinda irregular but light. Does not increase risk of stroke, no fatness or craziness."

I am one very proud of you.   Please ignore the concern trolls, even the doctor.  I get a lot of that myself (including my doctor). I am 5 ft 6 in and 110lbs [low bf% and BMI] and anyone that gives me crap I offer to let them go run with me or have a session at the gym to see if they think I am still unhealthy after. No one ever takes me up on it.   I am beginning to believe people honestly don't know what actual healthy weight loss like anymore.    Very sorry for losing the fur baby.

The last wright she has for me is 177lbs which was over two years ago (three or so months post partum). So I know for a fact my weight is not too low. She asked if my weight loss was intentional and as soon as I said I followed CICO using MFP she went into lecture mode. Funny, she never brought up my weight when I was a fat ass though, WHERE WAS YOUR CONCERN THEN!? HUH!? It was perfectly normal that I had debilitating back pain and unrelenting sciatica.  I did do the 5k for myself as my husband hasn't shown any interest in running. He doesn't have the drive to exercise like I do, at least not now. He does his own thing which is fine by me. It just hurt that they were right there and they (him along with my inlaws) didn't bother. That was the entire reason we were there! Fuckers lol.

shitladytrollx,3b6dwy,ouchtruthhurts30,2,Fri Jun 26 14:16:41 2015 UTC,"I'm only 21, and though I want kids eventually, I'm nowhere near ready. My family is ecstatic about that, I find the ones that aren't are young mothers. When I say I want to wait until I'm thirty to have kids, they take it like a personal insult and turn into major bitches to me. I just figure they're angry that because of their choices, they're saddled with a kid when they just want to party.   Hell, my family wouldn't even at all be surprised if I never have kids. My sister is gonna end up popping out a ton, so they can play grandparents to her kids. I always joke that she's going to get married and have kids before me anyway, despite that she's three years younger.  With strangers, I'd say just get really sad and say that you medically can't have kids and it really upsets you. Laugh gleefully as they stumble over apologies so hard. With family, they'll get it eventually. Family is always irritating, just reply that you want to travel the world and enjoy your money with no kids. Joke consistently about renting nieces and nephews. They will eventually lay off, especially when younger relatives get hitched and knocked up so they have another place to go with their baby fever."
shitladytrollx,3b0jt9,dinosnoores,10,Thu Jun 25 00:14:15 2015 UTC,"I definitely have days when I'm simply not hungry.  Also, I have days when I am super hungry and eat a lot.  I always eat dinner with my husband, but if it weren't for that, I think I could easily have a few 650 cal days those times I'm not hungry."
shitladytrollx,3b0jt9,Goodbutton,3,Thu Jun 25 01:05:38 2015 UTC,No. But I do have times when my body is hungry and my stomach is growling and I feel busy or productive and I don't want to be bothered by needing to eat. That's when a handful of veggies or a protein shake goes a long way.
shitladytrollx,3b0jt9,athennna,4,Thu Jun 25 09:47:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, definitely. On days like that, I usually grab a big spoonful of peanut butter or something and munch on that if I'm worried about it, but otherwise I think it's fine. For every day or two I have where I just don't eat much, I have about one or two days when I'm ravenous and eat more than enough to make up for it.   As long as you're eating healthily and enough most days, I think a day or two every few weeks where you don't eat much at all is fine. If you notice yourself dropping too much weight, though, definitely try eating more calorie-heavy foods until you're able to get back to the weight you're most comfortable with."
shitladytrollx,3b0jt9,Sineaduhh,3,Thu Jun 25 22:44:29 2015 UTC,Oh it definitely gets balanced out where some days I'll eat probably the equivalent over my calories as I do under calories on the not-hungry days. It just seems strange to not feel hungry for an entire day and even seen nausea at the idea of food. I guess there's still some fatlogic in me from pre-weight loss a few years ago (currently at a healthy BMI)
shitladytrollx,3b0jt9,Correctrix,2,Thu Jun 25 22:52:18 2015 UTC,"Haha, no worries, I know you're at a healthy BMI. And it's okay to be a little concerned if you feel like lack of hunger might mean something could be wrong. In this case, though, I think you're perfectly fine.   If you start feeling ""off"" on days you have no appetite, or start noticing these not-hungry days becoming increasingly more frequent, I would definitely speak to your doctor about it. But, again, a few ""no hunger"" days every so often isn't cause for alarm."
shitladytrollx,3b0jt9,Correctrix,4,Fri Jun 26 00:10:54 2015 UTC,"I have to remind myself to eat quite often because I just don't feel hungry, I think its totally normal not to feel hunger."
shitladytrollx,3b0jt9,Wrong_tree,2,Thu Jun 25 05:00:10 2015 UTC,"If you are close to being on a carbohydrate fast (getting almost all your energy as fat and protein), you will go into ketosis after a few hours, and the sort of hunger and cravings you feel will be very different from the way they are when you're in glycolysis.  Some people can then even go for days without feeling all that hungry, with the body surviving on its own fat tissue."
shitladytrollx,3b0jt9,sheogorath_senpai,3,Thu Jun 25 13:46:38 2015 UTC,"Huh, this sounds really interesting. Is this what the Keto diet is based off of?"
shitladytrollx,3b0jt9,HoneyBeeFit,2,Thu Jun 25 13:53:00 2015 UTC,"Yep, a ketogenic (""keto"", in slang) diet is one that makes you pass from glycolysis into ketosis by restricting carbohydrate intake.  We all go into ketosis every night until breakfast.  A ketogenic diet prolongs the state.  It has pros and cons."

shitladytrollx,39r676,throw_a_ball_please,45,Sat Jun 13 23:19:19 2015 UTC,"Without original feminism, I would literally be property. My husband could beat me and I would have nowhere to turn. I wouldn't be allowed to hold any job that demanded respect, or any leadership positions. The only way I'd be able to improve my position in life would be marrying rich; no chance of earning my way. I'd probably be barefoot and pregnant right now, instead of highly educated and loving life.   I am incredibly grateful for all that feminism has done over the years to give me the options and the freedom that I enjoy today.   Society is still working on true equality. Racism is still a thing. Sexism still happens. Various forms sexuality are still something people have a problem with. We've come a long way, but it's not over.   Fundamentally, feminism is the belief that men and women are equal. The ways in which that manifests are still up for debate. When I say I'm a feminist, I mean that I believe in equality. Feminism as a movement is made up of many many people, all of whom have different opinions on what equality looks like. That's up for discussion, and I think everyone's time would be a lot better spent talking about what equality would/should look like, and less time re-hashing the definition of a term with such a long and broad reach that it will never be defined.   You ask if I'm a feminist. I ask you, what kind of feminist are you talking about? Because you're going to have to be more specific to learn anything of value from the answer. Do I hate men? Do I agree with the views of X, Y or Z writer? Do I think equality means men can opt out of parenthood? Etc.   I know that currently, people are often treated differently based on appearance, gender, race, class, and other factors. I'm interested in creating an even playing field. Are you? Does it matter what we call ourselves?"
shitladytrollx,39r676,coralto,7,Sun Jun 14 03:30:25 2015 UTC,"Such a good answer. Whenever the subject of feminism comes up people seem to think every single one of us agrees with every other one of us, like some kind of hive mind. This is how I'm going to respond from now on :)"

shitladytrollx,39r676,_what_the_truck,8,Sun Jun 14 13:14:01 2015 UTC,"Why not just drop feminism and go with egalitarian if you're for equality? I think most people are puzzled by the obvious female base for the word ""feminism"" when it supposedly means equality for both sexes. I tend to interpret as strive for equality, but a belief that females are still the underdogs in the struggle. The endgame is the same as an egalitarian point of view, but I see feminism as claiming women are still worse off. This can be a hard barrier to jump for people who ""strive for equality"" but don't necessarily think women are the ones who need the help."
shitladytrollx,39r676,pfershizel,6,Sun Jun 14 23:23:42 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm OK with it being called ""mankind"" which has a pretty obvious basis in ""man"". The ""fem"" refernces the history of the term, womens suffrage and so on. It shows respect for the shoulders we stand on."

shitladytrollx,39r676,gayjenjen,14,Tue Jun 16 01:19:35 2015 UTC,"Here's what I always say in regards to this  : feminism is the belief in gender equality. That's it. If you believe in gender equality you are a feminist.  There's a lot of people who don't want to use the term feminist because some people associate it with the extreme tumblr man hating types. And personally, I think that's a stupid reason. You don't hear people saying ""oh I am anti Christian, I hate those westboro Baptist Church guys. I mean I believe in the bible of course, but I hate what those guys are doing.""  No one would assume that because you say you're Christian that youre a wbc unless you were holding up a crazy sign. Similarly if people stopped being so afraid of the word feminism and just showed that normal logical people can be cool with calling themselves feminist, then less people would associate the term with the extreme, wrong group.  It's just a word, don't be afraid of it."
shitladytrollx,39r676,ifuckpineapples,8,Sun Jun 14 02:39:44 2015 UTC,Speaking for myself but I feel that feminism has become synonymous with man-hating.

I have met BRILLIANT women in my major that motivate me to keep studying and not feel intimidated by the 40+ men in class. My husband works with several female soldiers who are just tough and badass chicks all around. That's what feminism should be.

All this Sarkeesian-esque nonsense about how women are inherently victims held under the thumb of evil male rapist overlords is just completely against what the original proponents of gender equality fought for. Women are not infantile, morally incorruptible angels that need to be protected from the consequences of their own actions or offensive ideas. Ironically, that was the sort of position on gender roles held by much of traditional Western society. Women were weak and childish things that had to be protected and lead by men. And yet, modern feminists are proposing the same damn thing: women need special privileges, and need their feelings protected.  I believe in gender equality in the sense that both genders should be allowed equal opportunities, equal rights and equal punishment for the same crime. I don't think choices in lifestyle or gender expression should be forced down anyone's throat, whether they be modern or traditional. People should be allowed to do their own thing as long as they aren't hurting others. This is a matter of giving people the freedom of self-actualization, not creating some kind of culturally perfect society."

I appreciate the work done by feminists before I was born, to build a world where I can do what I prefer with my life, based almost solely on how well I do it.  I am extremely grateful.   However, feminism is now a crusade without an enemy.  They've wiped out the heretics, but never ended the recruiting.  are now milling around full of righteous fury with nowhere to put it.  It's time for the swords to become plowshares, but they won't give them up.    There is, in fact, an enemy they could take up against, but oddly they won't:  The treatment of women in Islamic and third/developing-world countries is a huge problem.  All of the damn money wasted on manspreading and Take Back the Night, and slutwalk nonsense when just a fraction of that effort would make a tremendous difference to real women in the world.  Just mere pennies would change women's lives drastically in Ethiopia - http://hamlinfistula.org/.  Why don't we care about those women?    (My theory is that caring about those women is hard and can't be organized in a weekend over twitter.  Also, the people who might object to one changing things for such women tend to object via Kalashnikovs and firebombs rather than nasty letters to the editor.)  I also have extremely strident objections to the parts of the feminism movement that seems to be driven to infantilize women.  Women are not fragile flowers who require unending safe spaces, and wither under the ""male gaze,"" and can't be asked to take responsibility for  the outcomes of their actions and choices.  Fuck that noise and anyone who propagates it."

A web server can only handle so much traffic. That's why sometimes you get those ""ouch!"" errors on Reddit when there is too much activity, and why Voat was swamped for a couple days when thousands of people were going there and making new accounts.  A simple way to DDOS a website is to use a botnet. This is basically when you get a bunch of computers together and make them do the same thing over and over. There are a lot of ways botnets are used to fuck up networks, but a really simple implementation is just pinging the hell out of the website and crashing it.  tl;dr Hams doing what they do best: eating up resources."
shitladytrollx,39o44p,jojo_mill,2,Sat Jun 13 06:40:56 2015 UTC,"Makes sense. Do you think it's crashing purely due to FPH users trying to check it out? Or that others, namely fatties, trying to purposely flood it and keep it down?"

shitladytrollx,39o44p,lostinmiami,5,Sat Jun 13 14:22:07 2015 UTC,It is an attack. It is automated and done through a bot net. Voat went down because too many actual users are trying to use the site at once. No one went to Voat with the purpose of making it inaccessible to others. DDoS attacks are done purposefully. That is someone making a concerted effort to make a site inaccessible.

Then there's voat. It's slow as all hell since the mass exodus, and I remember reading from the casual ama thread held by the original mods that they currently consider it an unviable option due to moderation issues.  Then there's 8chan. It seems like the most stable platform as of now, but on the other hand...it's 8chan. The original sense of community just isn't there, and it's full of shitposting trolls.

One thing I felt like fph had a problem with was how for a lot of subscribers it was fat woman hate, not fat people hate. Almost all the posts were about fat women, about how fat women want a hot guy (although fat guys want hot women), pics of fat women in garish dress (not as often fat men in fedoras), etc.   I used to post a lot of pics of fat guys, especially guys from Facebook red pill or other misogynist groups, and a lot of times I would get down voted immediately, several times I had people go through my comment history right after and down vote.   Even a lot of times it didn't seem like fat women hate necessarily, just woman hate. There was one comment thread I remember where the subject of women wanting tall guys came up, and any woman who supported the idea of having preferences (god forbid) got massively down voted. There was another one where pictures of some verified lady's hand was in the photo, and people were attacking her for having a fat hand(?). Never saw male posters get treated like that.  I really feel like the old fph still had some political correctness in that eventually posts about fat guys would get up voted, but I don't know how the new voat and io sites will be. Im worried they're going to get worse.   Oops, this got longer than I intended..."
shitladytrollx,39jeh9,dr_shitlordMD,6,Fri Jun 12 12:35:43 2015 UTC,"I never noticed that, but then again I hardly ever browsed ""new"". Maybe partly because a lot of the hate is directed at tubblrinas? Some nice posts with delusional male fatties made the top page, but few of the guys had the in Your face ""worship muh curves!"" mentality (some of the tinder guys sure did though)"
shitladytrollx,39jeh9,ABadManComes,3,Fri Jun 12 18:03:02 2015 UTC,I didnt really notice this but I can surmise one reason being that fat women are way more louder when involved with HAES. Society also focuses more on female beauty then male.   As for the down votes. FPH was always finicky. Down votes would randomly rain sometimes in directions you wouldn't expect. You probably hurt a bunch of short guys with your comment though. They tend to be defensive. I made a comment about short guys once and while I was eventually up voted the short man insecurity syndrome came out of the woodwork
shitladytrollx,39jeh9,FPHThrowaway1234,2,Fri Jun 12 22:50:14 2015 UTC,"I personally never saw any outright issues with it. But yeah it definitely was primarily fat women. I always just figured it was because they're more loud and obnoxious about wanting people to love their ""curves"" and HAES whereas fat men are maybe less vocal? Idk. That was my reasoning though. It's frustrating if they really were just downvoting any fat guys."

But in this case, OP just made up some SJW scenario in her mind and then got everyone riled up over an imaginary scenario. Less than 10% of the commenters said this had happened to them or knew anyone that it had happened to.  In fact stay at home mothers would tell you that there's a stigma attached to staying at home now a days."
shitladytrollx,37mm5g,Ismelltehfatties,14,Fri May 29 04:40:27 2015 UTC,"Seems like you didn't understand, the OP was a joke.   Some people (as you've demonstrated with the examples) then begun seriously discussing men who are actually like that in real life. At no point did they think the male statue had told the female statue she should stay at home."
shitladytrollx,37mm5g,Ismelltehfatties,-5,Fri May 29 04:54:17 2015 UTC,then begun seriously discussing men who are actually like that in real life.   Except OP didn't know anyone like that in real life. She had to make up that little stupid rant because she'd never actually heard a guy speak like that. And the other posts were just your basic SJW's complaining about how the man was sitting and how the woman statue looked 'annoyed' at getting hit on (talk about stereotyping by the way. Who's to say they weren't both students discussing a serious topic?).   The comment who got gold for example was just a long SJW rant about men wanting women at home. The majority of college students are women so who exactly is telling them to stay home?
shitladytrollx,37mm5g,Ismelltehfatties,11,Fri May 29 05:33:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think the point went over your head.   The original statement was intentionally hyperbolic for comedic effect, but even in your own examples she clearly states she was inspired by real people who hold those views. There's a thousand subs on this very website you can go to and find thousands of men making very nearly the same comment, but for realsies. TRP would be a good place to start.  Are you a man?"
shitladytrollx,37mm5g,Ismelltehfatties,-8,Fri May 29 06:02:39 2015 UTC,Nope I'm a woman. I believe there are more serious issues to be discussing than hypothetical sexism. If you have a personal story about sexism or an anectode. Great. I can relate.  If you're going to make up some mini rant about an imaginary conversation you made up in your head? Then I think you're an idiot.
shitladytrollx,37mm5g,rahkobear,3,Fri May 29 06:18:54 2015 UTC,What mini rant?

Take this post for example. 2000+ upvotes and OP just made up that entire conversation and the comments are all 'outraged' at this imaginary conversation. It's like they're running out of actual sexism to be outraged at and have to make up ridiculous scenarios in their heads.

I had to see my bully at a wedding recently. Not only is she fat but she's going bald. I loved every fucking minute of that shitty wedding.
shitladytrollx,37f0jc,litteringredhen,11,Wed May 27 05:29:17 2015 UTC,"Lol, for real.  A lot of people underestimate how awful it can be to go through adolescence being taunted constantly.  That shit doesn't leave when you leave high school, either, it can become ingrained in you and you have to deal with low self esteem and other issues years after high school ends.  It has a lasting impact.  It's not holding a grudge at that point.  It's just schadenfreude.  I'm guessing there were some mean girls here or something bc damn.  (No I wasn't fat either)"

shitladytrollx,37f0jc,CertifiedShitlord,13,Wed May 27 03:50:00 2015 UTC,"It's not like you think about her all the time, or even really care that much. But when someone went out of their way to make your life miserable, it's a nice sense of vindication seeing them in passing or on Facebook and realizing that they've gotten really fat. Call it petty if you want, but I take pleasure in the fact that my tormentor is now huge and I'm still the same weight, even after having two kids."
shitladytrollx,37f0jc,Knyxie,13,Wed May 27 03:55:44 2015 UTC,I certainly don't deny that it's petty! That doesn't mean it doesn't feel good! Schadenfreude is a beautiful thing.

I wish that the side effect was listed as ""INCREASED HUNGER"" rather than ""WEIGHT GAIN"". Because nothing that you put in your body will add fat to your body other than excess calories.  For a few people, it does make you hungrier for a while, as you adjust to the new hormones. Just be mindful of that and you'll be fine :)"

In a store where I'm a small all I can ever find are a few mediums and larges and then piles and piles of XL and XXLs. It's disgusting.   It's even worse trying to find clothes for my kids. Especially my oldest son. He's 5'11"" now and weighs maybe 110 lbs. Super tall and skinny. He's well into mens sizing for his height, but it is impossible to find pants that are small enough around his waist.

shitladytrollx,36tmjp,RPRob1,3,Sun May 24 04:00:43 2015 UTC,I'll girl-date a 5k with you.
shitladytrollx,36tmjp,frenchtoastman,1 point,Sun May 24 09:41:22 2015 UTC,If I wasn't already spoken for I would ask where to sign up for one of those dates
shitladytrollx,36tmjp,SheMadeThis,0,Sat May 23 02:42:08 2015 UTC,"Was this a walk, a run, or a bike ride?    I'm guessing run.    Great job, this is an awesome criteria for dating!   People that are committed to fitness know how to achieve goals in other areas of their lives too."
shitladytrollx,36tmjp,Amplitude,4,Fri May 22 20:47:44 2015 UTC,"5K is typically a run, but some races will allow participants to choose between walking and running."
shitladytrollx,36t0a2,thinphuckingbetch,25,Thu May 21 21:48:59 2015 UTC,Congrats on your 130 lb weight loss!!    Enjoy the time to spend on yourself and I know you'll find an amazing new shitlord if you'd like.

Everyone else was telling me to get out of it, and I couldn't even talk to one of my friends about him cause she was sick of hearing about that shit. She was such a good motivator for me to leave..so much tough love from her that was so helpful. My favorite IRL shitlady <3"

shitladytrollx,36mewa,MissHolloway,7,Wed May 20 16:59:23 2015 UTC,"It's horrible, hence why I posted here. Seems like most online forums are all run by fatties high fiving each other for inhaling an entire crate of chips."
shitladytrollx,36mewa,MissHolloway,13,Wed May 20 17:18:14 2015 UTC,"Congratulations!! That's wonderful news! I'm a PT who had a baby 8 months ago! Continue doing whatever you're doing for exercise, as long as you feel well enough. Nausea might put a damper on it, unfortunately. I was doing heavy lifting when I got pregnant, and I continued for a few months. I was cramping when I was lifting a few months in, so I decided to stop and switch to lighter weights, TRX, and low impact cardio."
shitladytrollx,36mewa,MissHolloway,9,Wed May 20 17:41:40 2015 UTC,"Gosh I wish you lived in my area! I need a shit lady PT that had a baby to coach me through this! It's such a scary time, and no one around me is into fitness, and they are all telling me to just eat and relax, and that's not me!  I'm guessing it's normal to be worried about lifting and running?  For the moment I am so exhausted I can't even do my 10 min bike ride to work. I'm a runner, but I'm worried that running can unstick it... if that makes sense.. Should I switch to fast walking on an incline for now?"
shitladytrollx,36mewa,MissHolloway,11,Wed May 20 13:53:47 2015 UTC,"Haha, don't worry about unsticking it! I think listening to your body is your best bet. If you feel cramping, or unwell while running, then slow down. A friend of mine ran her entire pregnancy, and had a healthy baby boy right on time. Your doctor/midwife will most likely recommend you ""take it easy"" but you can be confident in knowing that you can continue doing what you're doing and not harm your baby. Like I said, listen to your body.  If you have any questions, feel free to PM me."
shitladytrollx,36mewa,MissHolloway,3,Wed May 20 14:54:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much, you're really helpful :)"
shitladytrollx,36mewa,Coocoo_for_cocopuffs,4,Wed May 20 15:16:49 2015 UTC,"My pleasure! Pregnancy can be a scary time, so having support is very helpful! You don't need to find support from people who don't have your same values, though, and becoming fat is not a necessity!"
shitladytrollx,36mewa,Disappear_vanish,5,Wed May 20 15:24:10 2015 UTC,"I know nature will take care of everything, but I'm trying to do as many things in my power to avoid another mc.   I'm going to keep my regular gym routine, but I'll start off slow on the treadmill, nausea and the heat in my area lately is not making it easy!"
shitladytrollx,36mewa,Disappear_vanish,4,Wed May 20 16:00:21 2015 UTC,Do what you feel is right. Of course you want to protect yourself and your baby! That's the first bit of mothering you get to do for your little one :)
shitladytrollx,36mewa,Disappear_vanish,5,Wed May 20 17:02:38 2015 UTC,Aw.... That actually made me cry!   I'm a mess right now lol.
shitladytrollx,36mewa,CakeTrap,3,Wed May 20 17:33:27 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, awww, no you aren't! Even the least sentimental women get super mushy when they're pregnant 😊"
shitladytrollx,36mewa,LilyTheLean,5,Wed May 20 17:35:02 2015 UTC,"If you exercised before, you can most definitely continue until it is no longer comfortable to do so. Same with running. I had an acquaintance that is over 7 months along and is still running. She's a total shitlady who looks absolutely amazing.  I'd say keep doing what your are doing so long as you feel ok. Just be willing to slow down when your body tells you (and trust me, your body will let you know). Also just because you are showing weight gain throughout your pregnancy it does not necessarily mean you put on fat. A large portion of the weight gained goes to blood volume, placenta, amniotic fluid and straight up water retention. After I had my last kid I lost 20+lbs in two weeks just from all the fluids."
shitladytrollx,36mewa,deathoverfatness,2,Wed May 20 17:37:45 2015 UTC,That is some good news! I am absolutely terrified of putting on weight and not dropping it. I want to look even better post baby than I do now.
shitladytrollx,36mewa,deathoverfatness,9,Wed May 20 23:58:16 2015 UTC,"I ran until I was about 7 months, lifted, cycled, walked everywhere. Some days I felt like I'd been hit by a truck so just napped a lot, but I was always doing as much as I could all the time.   Some days you'll feel weak, so on those days I just walked. I'd make a place to walk to like the library or something, and walk home with my prize of a book. Plus there's the added bathroom break of actually going in.   Just eat lots of veg, drink tons of water, and listen to your body. You'll know when to get up and get moving for your energy vs when you need to eat a handful of tums and wait it out."
shitladytrollx,36mewa,coralto,4,Thu May 21 15:27:23 2015 UTC,"Really? I'm a runner and all I keep hearing is don't run or you'll unstick the embryo, and having gone through an MC earlier this year it has me scared to death.  But the more I read here, the more I find shitladies that are runners and active! At the moment, I feel the fatigue truck coming at me full speed. I take naps in the day when I can and I barely find the energy to cook anything, let alone work out!"
shitladytrollx,36mewa,Adip0se,6,Wed May 20 17:21:48 2015 UTC,"I had a mc as well, they're very common. I got pregnant three months to the day after the d&c. I was active the while time, running, biking, lifting. You can do it!   I'm sorry about your mc. They're very difficult when you're trying for a baby. My best friend miscarried right before I did and they had been trying for a very long time. It was terrible, I wanted to trade places with her so she didn't have to bear it.   So anyway, I hope I'm not out of line when I say any of this. She and I both miscarried a couple months apart and both conceived a few months after the mc and gave birth (our babies are two weeks apart)!   Right now you're worried about staying healthy. Tbh, that's all you have to do:) I know a handful of healthy ladies, fit, athletic, active, and some of them were running in even their third trimesters!"
shitladytrollx,36mewa,hohnsenhoff,4,Wed May 20 17:43:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I'm so happy you have a happy healthy baby!   You know, I had no idea they were so common, no one ever talked about it. When it happened I felt so alone, no woman in my family ever had one. Suddenly I was the black sheep, the broken woman. The more I talked to friends, the more stories came out that made me feel less like a bad person, and more normal.   I still have that fear, which is natural. There's  only so much I can do, and working out is my stress relief. Last time I followed every one's bad advice and just plopped down not doing anything and thinking too much. This time I want to just go about my normal day, do my normal thing and try and not think about it. Working out is the biggest support I can have for myself."
shitladytrollx,36mewa,Adip0se,3,Wed May 20 17:50:23 2015 UTC,"Ugh, that sucks, losing a preg is bad enough but to feel so alone about it.. Anyway, yes, mc are very common. These days they seem more common but experts think it's bc we can detect a pregnancy within days of conception whereas back in the day, girls would just have an extra cramps, late period and never know it was a preg.   Tbh, I only talked about the mc with a couple of ppl  but the women who I did talk to all had at least one mc and all have several children.   Keep trucking, and stay healthy and have fun!"
shitladytrollx,36mewa,hohnsenhoff,3,Wed May 20 18:19:42 2015 UTC,"Congrats! I'm really happy for you!  If you're a runner, it's okay to keep running while expecting! Your body is used to it, doctors only discourage women from beginning new exercise routines when they become pregnant, not ones they're accustomed to. Just lighten it up if you're worried about it or feel any discomfort, but keep getting a little bit of exercise from walking or light weights or swimming.   Remember, women used to do manual labor on farms throughout their entire pregnancy and still had healthy babies! Good luck!"
shitladytrollx,36mewa,MrSaxoBeetus,2,Wed May 20 18:28:02 2015 UTC,"You make a great point and that's what I keep thinking of. Women back in the day didn't lay in bed all day and do fuck all. They worked, raised other kids, tended the farm, made food and clothes. And here some of them are saying no, don't even walk up the stairs? Bullshit I say!"
shitladytrollx,36mewa,262Mel,6,Tue May 26 12:28:42 2015 UTC,"I'm no PT or formerly pregnant woman, but I just wanted to say good luck with it all :) also I have heard somewhere that swimming is good and easy to do while pregnant."
shitladytrollx,36f91p,hajimalago,9,Mon May 18 22:48:29 2015 UTC,"Have you considered masking it with coffee? Add a cup of coffee, scoop of powder, ice cubes, milk/creamer (optional)"
shitladytrollx,36f91p,MissDarling92,3,Mon May 18 23:15:39 2015 UTC,"This might work. It takes WAY too much of anything I use to mask it. Banana, peppermint, peanut butter... I will try this next. At this point, I am just waiting for the container to be empty so I can go back to enjoying myself, haha."

shitladytrollx,36f91p,frankie_v,3,Thu Jun 11 17:37:57 2015 UTC,Put it in smoothies! Banana and berry flavours kill the gross tastes. I also add granulated coffee sometimes.

shitladytrollx,36cwfz,Fat2fitgirlthrowaway,25,Mon May 18 11:20:06 2015 UTC,"Its the crabs in a bucket mentality. If they can't get out, no one can. Which makes no sense because they CAN get out, they just don't want to try. I know that feeling and I'm so sorry you're dealing with it.  As for shitladies, I hang out on fatpeoplehate, talesoffathate, fitshionvsfatshion, and instagram. But Insta can be a crap shoot because there are a lot of fat girls spouting bullshit there too."
shitladytrollx,36cwfz,fattycant,12,Mon May 18 12:40:09 2015 UTC,"""Crabs in the bucket mentality""- I love it. I laughed out loud because this is so true. I'm 8 month pregnant and I've only put on 10lbs. I'm extremely active and eat very clean. All my pregger friends say things like ""give up"", ""just give in, you're going to get fat anyway"". Sorry lardos. After 4 kids, I'm still a size 2 with ripped motherfuckin' abs!!"

shitladytrollx,36cwfz,Coocoo_for_cocopuffs,21,Mon May 18 18:17:57 2015 UTC,"Same issue. Went from fat to fit, and found that both online and IRL people became shittier the smaller I got. By far, the worst are women.  I use an alternate account now and basically stick to pro-shitlord/ladies subreddits. I find almost everyone on the major weight loss subs immediately jump to accuse you of having ED if you go below like 130, or if you are at a point that you are focused on losing vanity pounds -- actually saw a comment yesterday on Loseit, that if you were 130 looking to lose more, it would be seen as 'concerning'. I find that particular sub to be absolutely terrible for fatlogic and basically equates significant success with danger in many cases. Many people lose weight but stop short of actually trying to reach a healthy BMI. They say that they wouldn't look good smaller, or they are practically starving as it is now! Do we want them to develop an ED!? /s I actually find reading that crap motivating at this point. Nothing more rewarding than reading a bunch of responses from insecure manatees, that insist that mediocrity is the only safe choice. And I know that most of these users are bitter, fat, single, middle aged women.  Now I'm not saying I'm a bad ass. I do however see the value in the opinions of people who have actually been successful. These hams love commenting on the newbie posts because they can seem not only knowledgeable (they're not) but can also be supportive and lure new unsuspecting members. I can only imagine when they see a successful post, they know that person doesn't need their advice or would point out the fatlogic they are spewing so they immediately go on the defensive.  At least online I can create an alternate account and find solace in the my safe corner of the Internet, I just wish I had the same choice IRL. Because dealing with insecurity masked as concern while having to look them in the eye has been one of the hardest things I have ever done. As in, it's been the hardest thing ever not to strangle them."
shitladytrollx,36cwfz,MissHolloway,13,Mon May 18 12:45:59 2015 UTC,"Yup the ED concern trolling for real success stories is ridiculous! Also a lot of that ""oh if you go further you will push yourself too hard and just regain it all, HAES, most diets fail"" bullshit.   So many planet to smallfat transformations. Would be nice if more of them actually work that little bit harder to become human-shaped again.    Knowing what I do now, it was so stupid of me to take weight loss advice from hams who have been around for a long time and are still fat. No different from asking a bankrupt for financial advice.    When I lost the weight I ended up having to get new friends. Bonus: new friends are not fat and also becoming shitladies!"
shitladytrollx,36cwfz,emphesym,10,Mon May 18 18:31:40 2015 UTC,"My personal experience with xxfitness was bad. There was a terrible article on the front page about thigh gaps, and I mentioned that I have a thigh gap, and glorifying no thigh gap is just as ""shaming"" as glorifying the thigh gap. Downvoted to high hell for my ""thigh gap privilege"" like wtf does that even mean?"
shitladytrollx,36cwfz,MissHolloway,7,Mon May 18 14:40:06 2015 UTC,"oh okay. I don't have much experience with them so I wasn't sure if I should mention them.  did they actually say ""thigh gap privilege""??? wow"
shitladytrollx,36cwfz,emphesym,4,Mon May 18 17:36:25 2015 UTC,"Hey, no worries, the sub wouldn't be as big as it is if 90% of the subscribers didn't enjoy it. Yeah, the words ""thigh gap privilege"" were used by multiple ladies. I unsubbed right then."
shitladytrollx,36cwfz,MissHolloway,9,Mon May 18 17:41:57 2015 UTC,"I have never had a thigh gap even at my lowest weight and don't think I'll have one.

shitladytrollx,36cwfz,Disappear_vanish,2,Mon May 18 17:44:36 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I shouldn't have even mentioned my own thigh gap, it clouded my point."
shitladytrollx,36cwfz,PM_me_your_v_lines,9,Mon May 18 18:20:49 2015 UTC,"Hahaha yes that was cringeworthy! Amazing how nobody actually pointed it out to me. When I posted what I learned from my nutritionist I got told bullshit about vitamins so juice is still better than soda.   My experience with xxfitness wasn't that good either. Both the sub and their FB group. Still A LOT of fat sympathy and fat logic, TDEE denial and HAES bullshit. Real success stories and strong girls getting hit by downvotes in their sharing threads, while mediocrity laziness and gluttony like in your loseit examples gets upvoted. Many posters get super salty when a success story (from fat to fit, not JUPITER TO MARS) get a lot of attention. You WILL get attacked if you point out how she looks better after even if the OP has said so herself! You see obese hams who are not even close to powerlifter numbers talking about BULKING and getting a lot of support for it because they will be strong. Not even close. Many lifters also have this superiority complex, never mind that they are weak as shit and care more about their still unimpressive numbers than actually getting to a healthy BMI. I have also seen runners, swimmers, gymnasts, dancers getting dismissed as stupid cardio queens who don't know better.       I think subs like r/bodybuilding and r/powerlifting are so much better about calling out the hams and unfits bragging about their mediocrity. Lots of shitlords, a few shitladies but they don't fit my goals as well. Not yet anyway."
shitladytrollx,36cwfz,MountainOfButts,5,Mon May 18 20:07:55 2015 UTC,"Veggie juices are generally more healthy than fruit juice from concentrate with lots of HCFS! You can make your own. V8 is delicious though!   xxfitness isn't that bad otherwise, it does have good basic advice especially if you are a beginner lifter! It is just a very politically correct place. I got hate mail there before because someone found out I also post in fatlogic and FPH.   Don't get me wrong, lifting does make you strong and look better! But someone who is just starting out, with a very high BMI and body fat percentage should really not be eating a surplus and gaining more weight, most of it fat so she has more energy to lift..."
shitladytrollx,36cwfz,nefarious_moons,5,Mon May 18 18:15:18 2015 UTC,"Xxfitness and fitness are really tired. They're just jerkoff subs for ""if you don't lift, you're wasting your time"" and crap like that. Super PC, just whitewashed and vapid. It's fine by me they're getting overrun by fat folks, they're next to useless anyway."
shitladytrollx,36cwfz,Amplitude,3,Mon May 18 18:29:13 2015 UTC,"I have. I'm incredibly disappointed with the way xxfitness has gone, too :/ That one chick whose story was at the top of fatlogic like a week ago gave her progress pics FIRST to xxfitness, and it was barely up voted. Meanwhile, a couple hours later, some chick started talking about ""her HAES story and what it means to me"" and boom, 500+ upvotes. Xxfitness has become a place for celebrating stagnation and not REAL success, unfortunately :("
shitladytrollx,36cwfz,Fitmiss91,2,Mon May 18 18:39:55 2015 UTC,"i think i'm the only person with a good xxfitness experience. someone told me i was eating at starvation mode or some dumb shit and the whole damn forum swooped in on him/her like ""gtfo"". i guess, by principle, they won't tell people they need to eat more. i also noticed that they chilled the fuck out on treating people like shit simply because they don't lift. i'm a distance runner; lifting doesn't even begin to appeal to me and i only do the bare minimum to prevent anymore injuries to my gastro. ugh, god, that was like the worst part of xxfitness a couple years back; all these bitches acting like those of us who didn't lift were bimbos or something."

I talk openly about good/bad food, BMI, calorie counting, weights etc, all of my staff members are envisioned with fatlogic, with only two in the team of over 10 being a normal BMI, but they are currently super young. I went from fat to thin, from thin to toned, and toning up more - gotta get the sweet lady abs.  Yet, the employee who joined the gym before me, thinks he knows better. He's pushing the 30BMI last I time I had to work with him, discovered he had been talking shit behind my back to a mutual friend who came into work and walked straight past him to ask ME for proper advice and he hadn't seen any results on the fatties workout/diet plan. Check and mate lardass."

Women who were out of shape and not confident got downright MEAN.  It was really upsetting.  I knew why this small amount of women were being evil, but it still hurt.    Even Women who don't know you or your history will give the evil death glare.  It is such a shame that women are the most evil to other women over something so innocuous."

shitladytrollx,36d39v,ShittiestLady,3,Wed May 20 01:06:08 2015 UTC,My plastic surgeon said implants make a big difference. They have 30-40% more movement than natural breasts.   Do your shockabsorbers have underwires? How much did they cost?
shitladytrollx,36d39v,hyldaco,6,Wed May 20 08:24:18 2015 UTC,"No underwires. $50-$60+.   Be sure to get properly sized (by checking out /r/abrathatfits ) because if your band is too loose then the bra won't be as supportive as it should be. Most shitladies should probably be wearing a 32 band or smaller, unless they are completely swole or have a wider frame."
shitladytrollx,36d39v,ShittiestLady,1 point,Wed May 20 09:10:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I already know I'm a 28G or GG depending on the brand and the model of the bra. I'm a little leery of sportsbras without underwires, but I'm definitely gonna hunt down some reviews and see if they work for the added movement that comes with implants. They are a little cheaper than Panache or Freya, so a cheaper alternative would be great."
shitladytrollx,36d39v,hyldaco,1 point,Wed May 20 09:19:05 2015 UTC,I was leery of no underwire too. Previously I wore an underwire with a stretchy sports bra over. The shockabsorber are a compression style so they really reduce bounce. Good luck!
shitladytrollx,36d39v,ShittiestLady,10,Wed May 20 09:33:18 2015 UTC,"Do your research and don't cheap out.   I love them :) I don't flash anymore when I bend over and swimsuits look amazing. They don't hurt, are very soft and I have all feeling in my nips.  Most women wear the wrong bra size and wearing properly fitted support has become paramount (gotta protect that investment). My cup size sounds massive, but it's actually very easy to downplay in normal clothes.  My size only shows when nude or in a bikini or bra.  If you plan to be very active (read, running) I advise getting a smaller and easier to wrangle cc amount."
shitladytrollx,36d39v,hyldaco,5,Mon May 18 14:26:35 2015 UTC,"14 months ago. My consultation included being weighed, measured, holding samples and being asked about my physical and mental health. Basically, just like any other doctor visit plus implant fondling. Be prepared for lots of questions and be very honest with yourself and the doc. Try the rice test to get an idea of the cc amount you want. Docs don't go by bra size.  Edit: also, be more careful when holding cats."
shitladytrollx,36d39v,forklifts5x5,5,Mon May 18 14:38:38 2015 UTC,"UK brands like Freya Active and Panache make sportsbras for the busty petite lady that are far more supportive than any VS bra. Do a search on Amazon and you'll find a few. They cost a bit more upfront, but they are worth it. I have 545ccs and I don't dare set foot on my elliptical without my Panache! (Though I have been dying to try a Freya Active--they get great ratings on bra blogs and I love their non-sports bras.)   As an added perk, European bra makers are more willing to cater to a tiny ribcage: VS doesn't believe any adult has a ribcage smaller than 32”. Which sucks for me, since even pre-surgery I had a 28"" band size.   Give the European bras a try! You'll be amazed at the difference."
shitladytrollx,36d39v,Buttercupmiles,2,Mon May 18 14:48:02 2015 UTC,"Check out Title9! I'd have to go check the brands I just got, but they have some incredible ones. I'm a 32FF, and they have a decent and cute selection! Big fan, it's hard to find things to fit the ribcage."
shitladytrollx,36d39v,PM_me_your_v_lines,1 point,Mon May 18 14:53:16 2015 UTC,"It's interesting, I've had the opposite experience. I'm now a 30G (don't remember exactly what the implants were, maybe 375cc silicone under the muscle?), and I have very little trouble. I run in just a typical medium support sports bra. I wonder which experience is more typical? That said, I love the girls - wouldn't change a thing!"
shitladytrollx,36d39v,CertifiedShitlord,3,Mon May 18 23:07:36 2015 UTC,"Oh hey! Another 30G here, with 305ccs silicone under the muscle too. I LOVE them :) We're basically titty twins."
shitladytrollx,36d39v,hyldaco,3,Sat May 30 18:37:19 2015 UTC,May I ask how much you paid for your implants? I'm like a 32A with a slight deformity in my breastbone that make one side of my rib cage stick out. The wire from my bras always dig into it. I could have that corrected surgically but implants seems way less invasive(and more attractive) than having my ribs snapped back into place.
shitladytrollx,36d39v,CertifiedShitlord,4,Mon May 18 18:44:32 2015 UTC,"Definitely discuss with your doctor.  Ribs moved into a more proper position will be a temporary discomfort while you heal. If it were me, I would do that first, then get implants. My implants cost $6500"
shitladytrollx,36d39v,hyldaco,5,Wed May 20 02:30:28 2015 UTC,"Mine was just under $7k, but we paid a bit extra for the Sientra ""gummy bear"" implants. Not sure if your rib issue would cost extra since it might affect your surgery."
shitladytrollx,36d39v,CertifiedShitlord,2,Mon May 18 20:28:07 2015 UTC,I heard about the gummy bear implants. And my issue is very minor and wouldn't even be very noticeable if I actually had breasts. Kinda just makes my chest appear flatter if anything.
shitladytrollx,36d39v,Rolly_Polly_,3,Tue May 19 01:06:00 2015 UTC,"It might still affect your procedure; I think implants are placed a bit differently to cover ribcage issues like that. Definitely bring it up at a consultation and see what your surgeon says! I didn't look too much into it since it didn't apply to me (I had a different ribcage issue that affected size instead of placement), but I believe there is a section on Justbreastimplants.com dedicated to ribcage issues that may affect implant placement; I believe what you are decribing is mild pectus excavatum. Everyone's ribcage is a little different and has an impact on final results. That's why two ladies can get identical implants and have very different-looking results."

Usually costs about $15 for 2 hours of rental but there are always coupons for that stuff on Groupon.  Ultimate Frisbee is a super fun one I used to do.  A great running game is Cops and Runners! We used to play it in college. You have to definitely be careful and best to do it in a low traffic area.  You have people who are ""runners"" who need to wear visible clothing that identifies that they are playing the game. A visible armband, team shirt, etc. Their goal is to start from one location and end at another before a certain time. They have to stay near the roads and avoid getting tagged or they become cops.  The cops ride in cars with one driver and a few of their own cop runners. They drive around slowly to find the runners and the other cops get out of the car and run after the runners. A lot of times, the cops just abandon the cars and keep walking around and running. They usually will have a bunch of separate color armbands in the cars or have to take off their runner armband to distinguish that they are cops.  This game is best with at least 20-30 people however..."

shitladytrollx,353dyu,I_Trigger_Fatties,2,Wed May 6 21:49:16 2015 UTC,A tomato cage would be ideal since it has the support. Your biggest hurdle is getting those seeds to sprout.

shitladytrollx,34ssfk,dropthefffork,16,Mon May 4 06:45:49 2015 UTC,"Didn't the majority of us find this sub from FPH? I'm confused. I was under the impression that in this sub we would find trollx, but minus the snack-obsessed fatasses, who we occasionally make fun of. I don't really see how you can reasonably expect to enforce both the rule ""BMI <25 [...] if you're fat, GTFO,"" and ""no shaming is to happen."" We joined on the commonality that we AREN'T FAT. When you have a group that draws it's largest commonality from weight bias, there's gonna be weight bias."
shitladytrollx,34ssfk,undstaub2staub,7,Mon May 4 16:06:20 2015 UTC,"It sounds like the mods just want to recreate TrollX but exclude fat people. They want it to be the same as TrollX, just without fat people posting about fat people things. That's it. Which is fine, but then the name ""shitladytrollx"" is misleading."
shitladytrollx,34ssfk,dropthefffork,3,Mon May 4 17:33:49 2015 UTC,"I understand what they want, but I am saying that it is barely feasible if not downright hypocritical. ""No-one with a BMI over 25"" isn't direct fatshaming, but it is directly excluding fatties. I have seen a variety of posts which aren't solely focused on fat shaming, but fatshaming seems almost unavoidable given the criteria as well as the mode through which the majority of followers found this sub."
shitladytrollx,34ssfk,undstaub2staub,4,Mon May 4 17:43:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. It doesn't make sense to draw your userbase from a fatshaming sub and then say ""No fatshaming; we just want pretend fat people don't exist."" There seemed to be a decent mix of fatshaming and non-fatshaming content before the new rules, so I don't see the need for them."

shitladytrollx,34ssfk,ThatFatPersonSmell,9,Mon May 4 16:43:52 2015 UTC,I don't see anything wrong with the occasional post about the original TrollX since there is no better place than here to vent frustrations to fellow shitlady friends. These posts should not be very common but they shouldn't be banned either. Just my two cents
shitladytrollx,34ssfk,PM_ME_UR_ABS_,8,Mon May 4 17:16:28 2015 UTC,"So... this sub is for people who openly hate fat people, but aren't allowed to shame them? Sigh... I'm pretty sure a majority of the people here agree, that the new rules are not right for this sub."
shitladytrollx,34ssfk,CarmellaKimara,16,Mon May 4 20:07:06 2015 UTC,"Then you created the wrong sub. Create FatLogicTrollX. By making a sub affiliated with FPH, you created a sub open to fatshaming.  Give this one up and go create one for fatlogic. We just want to be able to fatshame with our sisters in peace."

shitladytrollx,34ssfk,annonne,-12,Tue May 12 16:17:54 2015 UTC,This just makes me sad. I was so excited to have a community of gals that weren't bullshit but apparently fat hate is literally the only thing you can talk about and that's fucked. I wanted to be friends with you guys so bad and this is just depressing.
shitladytrollx,34ssfk,dreamyta,15,Mon May 4 06:55:02 2015 UTC,"Idk. I just think you misrepresented what this about. There was no clear direction and then to suddenly change, I guess not great. :/"
shitladytrollx,34ssfk,CarmellaKimara,4,Mon May 4 11:51:11 2015 UTC,"It makes me pretty sad to see so many people wanting to just focus on hate, too. You guys (the mods) said from the very beginning that this sub was supposed to be like TrollX, just without glorifying fat behavior, etc., and that's why I joined. I clearly remember at least one of the mods mentioning how this was supposed to be a non hateful place way in the beginning. I guess the confusion with some of the subscribers stemmed from the then-somewhat vague sidebar.   I was getting sad over in the original TrollX because it seemed like every other post was about ""I'm fat and I don't care! I'm so empowered!!"" with all these women circle..rubbing(? It'd be hard to jerk a bean lol) about how they too have given up and given in to fat acceptance. It felt like they were constantly squishing my face into their unhealthy, greasy fatlogic.   My understanding was that this sub would be like if TrollX existed in a world without rampant obesity. This to me meant we could just be silly without even having to acknowledge the existence of fat minded women, and that is exactly what I wanted. They're loud and obnoxious about bellowing out how fat is better and we thin women don't exist, so what better way to make them feel shitty than to just pretend they don't exist while having lotsa fun amongst ourselves? I'm so sick of dealing with mean, fat people. I don't want to be reminded of them.   It's like when you go through a bad break up, you don't wanna go around telling everybody you hate your ex all the time because it will get back to your ex and they'll know you're still constantly thinking about them. What your ex least wants to hear is that you don't mention them at all and that you're doing really well and seem very happy. Don't let these fat minded women think that we're obsessed with them. We're better than that.   P.S. I think you guys let the confusion go on longer than it should have by not having clearer rules and not deleting posts that broke those rules. So I can see why some people who got comfortable here thinking it was another hate space are now feeling frustrated and angry."

Birth control is for sluts, since you were supposed to just not be having sex, abortion is worse and has the bonus of making you a murderer, etc."

They taught me to be a feminist, are pro-gay rights and mostly pro-choice. Birth control isn't a big deal, mostly because the women on my Mom's side of the family have always had reproductive issues. They also taught my brother to respect women (no slut shaming or victim blaming in their house)."

shitladytrollx,34nz0k,thatonegirlfrommath,17,Sun May 3 01:07:10 2015 UTC,"The thing that ultimately made me a shitlady was the fact that they took feminism from us. Fucking really?   In my home country there're still girls that have to get married at age 15 to 50 year old men, and you're bitching about guys that won't fuck you because you're a fat fucking fuck?   It's extremely disrespectful to call something so shallow feminism."
shitladytrollx,34nz0k,GRRLofOmicronPersei8,26,Sun May 3 08:39:54 2015 UTC,"She says she wants equal respect between genders. I personally think full respect to women would include the right to decide about abortions and have birth control available. Is it what feminism should be focused on? Maybe, maybe not. But it is a women's issue."
shitladytrollx,34nz0k,Galton1911,7,Sat May 2 22:47:10 2015 UTC,I completely agree with you.
shitladytrollx,34nz0k,Galton1911,21,Sat May 2 23:03:57 2015 UTC,"The slut shaming part is also troublesome to me. Men do not have the same pressures to be chaste as women do. To be truly equal, either men have to be ""slut shamed"" or women should not be. You cannot have different standards for sexual activity between genders and have equality."

shitladytrollx,34nz0k,mlkt,2,Sat May 2 23:03:32 2015 UTC,"By the above definition, radfems--who want liberation of women and eradication of gender, not women's equality with men--aren't feminists.  bell hooks isn't, Andrea Dworkin isn't, Rebecca Watson isn't, and Anita Sarkeesian definitely isn't--whereas Mercedes Carrera and Ayaan Hirsi-Ali are.  That would be  a nice definition.  The problem is that language changes.  And once you call yourself a feminist--because what evil heartless puppy-kicker would one be to oppose women having equal rights?--then you are slapped with all these obligations like ""if you're a male, be a good feminist ally and sit down and shut up"" and ""the video game you like encourages violence against women"" and ""women aren't getting STEM degrees because you nerds are misogynist"" and ""Gamergate is about harassing an innocent woman"" that have no basis in reality and nothing to do with equal rights.  It's classic strategic equivocation.  ""Check your privilege"" is the Motte and ""if you support women's equality, you're a feminist"" is the Bailey.    The religious group that acts for all the world like God is a supernatural creator who builds universes, creates people out of other people’s ribs, parts seas, and heals the sick when asked very nicely (bailey). Then when atheists come around and say maybe there’s no God, the religious group objects “But God is just another name for the beauty and order in the Universe! You’re not denying that there’s beauty and order in the Universe, are you?” (motte). Then when the atheists go away they get back to making people out of other people’s ribs and stuff. Or…”If you don’t accept Jesus, you will burn in Hell forever.” (bailey) But isn’t that horrible and inhuman? “Well, Hell is just another word for being without God, and if you choose to be without God, God will be nice and let you make that choice.” (motte) Oh, well that doesn’t sound so bad, I’m going to keep rejecting Jesus. “But if you reject Jesus, you will BURN in HELL FOREVER and your body will be GNAWED BY WORMS.” But didn’t you just… “Metaphorical worms of godlessness!” The feminists who constantly argue about whether you can be a real feminist or not without believing in X, Y and Z and wanting to empower women in some very specific way, and who demand everybody support controversial policies like affirmative action or affirmative consent laws (bailey). Then when someone says they don’t really like feminism very much, they object “But feminism is just the belief that women are people!” (motte) Then once the person hastily retreats and promises he definitely didn’t mean women aren’t people, the feminists get back to demanding everyone support affirmative action because feminism, or arguing about whether you can be a feminist and wear lipstick."

And also to the fact that we're an evil, shunned minority in most feminist groups--never mind the fact that doctors who know anything about the complications of obesity agree with us, never mind the fact that women's rights activists in Mauritania agree with us.  The SJW types who get angry about pretend problems but not real problems have the moral high ground and it sucks.  Look at any publication with the label ""feminist.""  A high percentage of the American ones are FA.  The others see oppression in things like Gamergate and view Sommers and Hirsi-Ali as reactionary right-wing gender traitors.  I agree with Wendy McElroy and some points made in Valenti's The Purity Myth.  Why call myself a feminist when I agree only with a very tiny minority on the basic tenets?  With atheism or libertarianism, by contrast, I agree with most of them.  I believe in equality of opportunity, not equality of outcome.  And I certainly don't agree with ""women can do everything men can do and should be treated as equal to men but men should never ever hit a girl."""

Also, for breakfast sometimes I like to mix protein powder in coffee. I never really got into drinking coffee and I don't like it black, but the bitterness helps cut the overwhelming artificial sweetness in flavored protein powder, which in turn acts like a creamer. It tastes like a Starbucks drink, but with a healthy dose of protein instead of twice my daily allowance of fat and sugar."

Whipped Greek yogurt is a thing now and it tastes incredibly similar to a whipped cream cheese, taste AND texture.  Homemade sweet potato fries in place of fast food fries. Fast food fries taste way too salty and soggy to me now.  Few tablespoons heavy cream whipped up with chocolate protein powder is my ice cream / pudding / chocolate substitute. (2tbspn / 0.5 scoop)  Pumpkin puree and applesauce and greek yogurt in baking. I make pumpkin protein muffins and they taste amazing.  Most importantly MASHED CAULIFLOWER! Totally hits the mashed potato spot, it just takes forever to make because I dont have a cuisinart."

I eat so much seaweed. But I can binge on five packages of seaweed for 100 calories and feel like a total glutton. Some shitladies may need to watch out for sodium in this scenario.  Sweet Cravings: I already mentioned how I figured out protein bubble tea is delicious. I also like to eat frozen fruit or make my own popsicle bars (pumpkin pie ""ice cream"" bars are killer). During the winter, I bought chocolate black tea and made hot chocolate with that instead of water plus some (1/2 the recommended or less) cocoa powder, vanilla extract, a dash of dairy/nondairy whiteness and it was HEAVEN.  Food Subs: I love eating vegetable subs for pasta (like spaghetti squash or making lasagna with thin sliced vegetables instead of noodles)."

shitladytrollx,34htsx,CarmellaKimara,2,Sun May 3 06:29:03 2015 UTC,"Considering the question was what low cal option do you like better than the original, I wouldn't say my preference for a low calorie milk substitute counts as a lie, nor deserves a down vote. It does have one third the calories and protein, but it has double the vitamin a and calcium, which I'm OK with. And it tastes way better to me, so I see no downside. I'd not think anyone's getting their daily protein from milk anyhow."
shitladytrollx,34htsx,hajimalago,2,Sat May 2 10:13:20 2015 UTC,"Cheese-less pizza. It's a myth that pizza needs cheese, and it'll basically cut the calories in half.  Tea lattes are amazing because tea isn't as strong as coffee, it doesn't require nearly as much milk and flavoring.  Club-soda + a drizzle of simple syrup + a squeeze of lime/lemon/few pureed raspberries, whatever. 50 calories or so in 16oz and way healthier than pop, meanwhile taking care of the fizzy craving."

shitladytrollx,34j0sa,BarackOdramaaa,2,Mon May 4 03:00:08 2015 UTC,Sorry for the delayed response! Just keep posting TrollX-relevant content to this subreddit and post any general fatshaming (i.e. things that don't relate to anything you've personally experienced) to the /r/fatpeoplehate subreddit!
shitladytrollx,34j0sa,Entitilitus,38,Fri May 8 21:12:29 2015 UTC,"What? I thought this sub was basically supposed to just be a more female-centric version of fph but with lots of other types of content also allowed? If we can't fat hate, then what the hell is this sub, and why is it called ""shitlady"" anything? Also why does it matter what people post? Why not let the upvotes speak for themselves? Some of the funniest and most satisfying posts here have been a product of people making fun of trollx.   If someone could actually explain what this sub is supposed to be rather than just downvoting me, that would be lovely."
shitladytrollx,34j0sa,frenchtoastman,10,Fri May 1 17:21:59 2015 UTC,I like to think of it as a more fit/positive version of the other TrollX. Like American Idol-era Kelly Clarkson vs current Kelly Clarkson.
shitladytrollx,34j0sa,watcherwait,8,Fri May 1 17:42:01 2015 UTC,"I'm going to agree, I thought this was where we could post funny gifs about our shitlady frustrations but also vent frustrations about shitlady-hating by other females (not limiting to when we experience the fatlogic or thin-hate from other people). If I posted a gif about a reaction I'll have to fatlogic, it would be downvoted to hell in trollx, so I thought that's why this was here."
shitladytrollx,34j0sa,BarackOdramaaa,-6,Fri May 1 20:45:11 2015 UTC,"A reaction to a personal experience is fine! Again, venting about things that happen in your day to day life, including thin shaming or fatlogic, are fine! But screenshots of the other TrollX subreddit or talking about things that go on there belong more in the fatlogic or fatpeoplehate subs."
shitladytrollx,34j0sa,jojo_mill,11,Sat May 2 17:55:10 2015 UTC,"Agreed. ""Shitlady"" in the name means part of fph.  As well, the majority of the reason people needed this was because anything to do with weight and other fat people gets downvoted to shit in trollx... anything not related to that is basically fine...so what is this?  It's such a new sub and there are rules like this already instead of letting it grow organically, I don't know what to think."
shitladytrollx,34j0sa,jojo_mill,7,Sat May 2 02:20:00 2015 UTC,"I guess if someone felt like it, they could try to create a new female centric fph + more sub with only the bare minimum of rules, and call it xshitladytrollx or trollxcirclejerk or something, but ehhhh fuck it- there will never be a female centric sub on reddit that doesn't end up getting ruined some way or another, apparently."
shitladytrollx,34j0sa,The_Wizard_Of_Wang,-3,Sat May 2 03:40:34 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you feel like this subreddit is being ruined, but I'd also like to add a little clarification to what I'm trying to get across. There are already subreddits centered around fat hate, fatlogic, stories about fat people, etc. But, if you have an experience with fatlogic or skinny/fitness/health shaming, please feel free to make a submission about it to this subreddit! But posts like, ""here's a screenshot of the other subreddit, look at what they're doing"" just don't belong here. This isn't a TrollXChromosomesHate subreddit.   Hope that helps clear things up for you a little more!"
shitladytrollx,34j0sa,HypocrisyThyNameIsFA,3,Sat May 2 18:02:49 2015 UTC,I'm fairly new to the sub and would also love the answers to these questions.

Basically, this is a subreddit for us chicks to hang out and talk about our issues, likes, dislikes, period shits, farts, boy/girl problems, funny things that happen in our lives, stuff like that. What sets us apart from the other TrollX community is that we don't promote, support or endorse fatlogic, obesity or gluttony. We aren't here to hate on other women, even if they're fat, displaying an unhealthy relationship with food or spreading fatlogic. There are other subs for that.   I've added an edit to my original post, but just to let you know: if you yourself witness or experience fatlogic or skinny/fitness shaming firsthand, submitting a post or meme to this sub is absolutely fine!   I hope that clears some things up for you! Feel free to ask me anymore questions in a comment or PM!"

shitladytrollx,34j0sa,dreamyta,12,Fri May 1 18:23:47 2015 UTC,Shitlady doesn't mean a thin woman. To be a shitlady/lord you have to fat shame and hate.  These rules are especially retarded when 100% of your users are from FPH.

Why do all these women talk about pizza so much?   I'm sorry this is unrelated and I also am usually impressed with what everyday feminism puts out. I appreciate their efforts to be intersectional but HAES is just glorifying a system that feeds poor people corn based sugar to keep them on healthcare.

shitladytrollx,349nej,--Shadowbanned--,7,Thu Apr 30 15:21:19 2015 UTC,"How I made the aforementioned bubble tea!  /u/truncatedOctahedron, /u/--Shadowbanned--, /u/fencerthrowaway and more!  I didn't make my tapioca pearls. They are actually from an Asian grocer near my parents' house, but you can get the same brand on Amazon here. They don't add much by way of nutrition, but they MAKE the bubble in bubble tea, so...  Step 1: Steep tea (black, green, jasmine, etc.) at at least double strength and then get it chilling.  Step 2: Normal bubble milk teas will have tea (you got that going!), a creamer (often non-dairy), and flavoring. For mine, I went with unflavored whey protein (aka creamer), a splash of almond milk, some almond extract, and a bit of matcha powder. I threw that into a blender with a few ice cubes. Mix it real good.  Step 3: Throw your creamy mixture in with your chilled tea and add ice.  Step 4: Put your tapioca pearls in (which I forgot to mention until now, but you were totally cooking according to the package).  Step 5: Be sooo happy."

shitladytrollx,3415s5,deathwaveisajewshill,10,Mon Apr 27 16:29:08 2015 UTC,"I think weight is a very valid reason to break up with someone. Not so much for superficial reasons, but because of the lifestyle that person is living. If a person is overweight and not working on becoming healthier/losing the weight, that means they place little value overall on their health and wellbeing. When you're young, extra weight doesn't pose much of an issue, but as you get older and fatter, it becomes so much more difficult for the body to keep itself in working order. Things break down. You start becoming resistant to insulin (diabetes comes with its own host of issues and needs to be monitored constantly), your arteries become clogged (plaque buildup increases the risk for stroke and heart attack), inactivity leads to the body breaking down quicker (more fragile bones that easily buckle under heavy weight, mobility issues, etc.)...   Even though he may be ""healthy"" now, an overweight or obese person who has no intention or desire to be better and healthier is setting him/herself up for a host of health problems later in life, problems that are either completely preventable or ones that become far more manageable with a healthier lifestyle.  Just keep encouraging him and make yourself an example for him to follow. Help him practice portion control, eat healthier, workout with him, stuff like that."
shitladytrollx,3415s5,squeakyaletheia,10,Mon Apr 27 16:56:41 2015 UTC,"I agree with this, but don't feel bad if it's a ""looks"" thing either. We can't really help what we're attracted to, and sometimes a flabby stomach is that much of a turn off.  That paired with an inactive lifestyle and they don't do anything to fix it... well that's really unfortunate."
shitladytrollx,3415s5,Prinsessa,7,Mon Apr 27 17:17:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not invalidating attraction at all in terms of love, but health goes far deeper than just physical attraction. In my opinion, obesity is self-sabotage, just like alcoholism or being addicted to heroin. Looks fade, I get that, but why would you want to be with someone who refuses to take care of themselves? Being overweight is not okay, especially if your partner places so much emphasis on their own health and wellbeing."

shitladytrollx,3415s5,sharkchaser,4,Mon Apr 27 16:55:36 2015 UTC,"Maybe perspective from the other side will help? I used to be the fat one. SO is former military, ultra marathoner, etc. and has a great body, always has. He used to do the whole health spiel with me, said I was breathing heavy, was concerned for me because I had bad eating habits (I ate out literally 3x a day all shit). This all really did nothing for me to be honest. I only lost weight because I began feeling insecure.   The main thing that happened was I went to visit him in South America because he was working down there. If you have never been all the women are GORGEOUS. Thin with small waists, big butts. I felt like a cow. I lost 30lbs + and then really focused on working out (lost all my weight through diet).   I know it's probably not what you want to hear but I didn't lose the weight because he wanted me to get healthy, I did it out of fear that he would leave me for someone else. Maybe that is more a female thing? I'm not sure. But now that I have lost the weight I feel great and I love working out and reaching new fitness goals, eating better, etc. so it's no longer about vanity/insecurity - but that's what got me started. Hope this helps somehow..."

I'm only asking because I'm at BMI 18 and I feel bloated and fat sometimes (I have a history of not having the healthiest mindset about my body) and if I ever dare to say it out loud my boyfriend gets annoyed at me and tells me its nonsense and that I need to gain weight.
shitladytrollx,33yte6,flyingcunt,4,Mon Apr 27 09:50:56 2015 UTC,"I've gained some weight recently, my BMI is 20 now while it's usually 19. I could use a diet."

Wow! Did this suit not fit!!! I couldn't even get it over my thighs! I don't know why they're selling it in the adult section since the XL was clearly child sized!!! I will never buy from this seller again! They need to get their sizing straight !""  Then you look at the pic and it's like Pluto's gas giant big sister squeezed into barbie outfit.

She kept making excuses for her weight by blaming her back issues, which were legitimate, she did have a bad back, but she'd complain while eating a large, 1,000 calorie meal while stealing bites off her husband's plate. Once she had surgery on her back, she started working out and did lose some weight, but her eating habits are still shit. One she stops, she'll gain it all back. It's like watching a train wreck happen."

But if the only thing you're excited about is food, you've got issues.   For example, every time my SO and I go out for sushi, I'm so excited I could do a happy dance (seriously, the place we go for sushi is the bomb)! But if it were just me going to get sushi by myself, I wouldn't be too thrilled. It's who you're sharing the food with that counts, not the food itself."

It can also be the savory, satisfying moment when you take that first bite of a meal where you tried out a brand new recipe and everything tastes perfect! Or you're having a terrible day at work and a work friend notices, and leaves you your favorite candy bar on your desk as a pick-me-up. Or that time when you were dealing with your first major heartbreak in eighth grade and your dad ""sneaks"" you out of the house at 10:30 on a school night for your favorite ice cream and a conversation about how guys at this age suck and how proud he is at how you're turning into a kindhearted, beautiful young woman...  Food is supposed to be fuel for our bodies first and foremost, but it can also be a great tool for bringing people together. There's nothing wrong with getting excited about food, not at all, so long as you maintain a healthy mindset when it comes to what's going in your body. Moderation is key."
shitladytrollx,33thep,nothanks_tubbs,2,Tue Apr 28 15:17:07 2015 UTC,"Exactly. If you're more excited about the food you'll be eating than the people you'll be with, there's a problem. I wholeheartedly believe that. It's what made me decide to become a pastry chef, even as a shitlady. I want my food to be the thing that friends share. I want my food to be the thing that's present during those really important moments. I don't want my food to be there, being snarfed down by someone who doesn't appreciate it, all alone. That's a waste of the time, love and effort I've put in."

shitladytrollx,33mn9q,youfuckinglettuce,7,Thu Apr 23 19:30:24 2015 UTC,"I think I brought up my status as a shitlady when I was complaining to my bf about my fat former best friend. He had a fat best friend then, too, that lived with us. I didn't start out complaining about how fat my former best friend was but the majority of my complaints with her stemmed from her being fat. It was like talking to a therapist! I came to the realization I really hate all the excuses fat people come up with to try to make obesity normal.   I complained to my bf about how she used to thin shame me by pointing out people who were as thin as me (5'1"" 90lbs) or even average weight women as being ""skeletal"" and ""boyish"" and unattractive. I complained to him about how she was always miserable and crying about how no guys like her because they're shallow. It really drains you emotionally to be around people like that. I complained to him about how I tried to encourage her by working out with her and getting her to join weight watchers but that she always failed and pouted at me and how unfair it was that I could ""eat anything and not get fat.""  He used to defend his fat best friend's fat logic (that he must feel like he's starving when it's just normal hunger pains, and how scary that must be for people like him, etc) when I would complain about entitled fat people, but they had a falling out, too, so now he makes fat jokes with me. He's still not as shitlordy as I am in some ways but it's adorable when we're at the beach and he'd start games like ""spot the fattest person on the beach"" all on his own. He also makes more fat jokes now.   I should note that since my bf is a dude, he didn't grow up being conditioned to coddle sad fat people. Even when he was best friends with our former super obese roommate, he'd openly make fun of how fat he was to his face. He would say things like ""Dude, where the fuck is your knee? Do you even have knees??"" or ""Wow, it's fascinating, you have absolutely no ass despite being such a fatass.""   With my family, I've always openly been a shitlady, more or less. Nobody in my family is remotely overweight, and every time I would go back home from college they'd ask me how my then best friend was doing. The first questions/comments were always something like ""Is she still fat? Is it just me or has she gotten even fatter? Doesn't she wanna lose weight? She sure is fat. She looks fatter and fatter every time you post a picture of her on Facebook. I bet she's miserable. You should help her lose weight."""
shitladytrollx,33mn9q,dreamyta,6,Thu Apr 23 20:17:42 2015 UTC,"See username.  With family and friends I'm very... political...about what I talk about.  A number of my family members are essentially SJW's, and I'd like to not be disowned more than once a year.  It's inconvenient at Christmas.   My husband and I though are both huge shitlords, about lots of things, and always have been.     What was the initial reaction/response?   ""Can we just go to Vegas and get married now?""  After I was ranting on people who let themselves go after the wedding on our second-ish date.  Did eventually get married."
shitladytrollx,33mn9q,NicerInPerson,2,Thu Apr 23 19:58:57 2015 UTC,"He has known for a long time. I'm a medical student so I can't deny that a BMI of over 25 without significant muscle mass is just plain fat and unhealthy. He also won't fight the facts, he is a biomedical engineer and learned anatomy and body composition himself.   I brough up the topic by saying that I won't let myself go during our relationship because I think it is just horribly rude to become jabba the hut and force him to stay with me nonetheless. He deserves a goodlooking girlfriend and vice versa. We actually both agreed that getting out of shape would be considered a burden to the other person and it would be bad if we won't try to stay attractive for each other. It would kill the passion and show a lack of consideration and selfrespect.   His initial response was agreeing with everything I said. Fat is not healthy and no ""adipositivity"" will change that. Promoting unhealthy eating wether it is anorexia or adiposity is equally as bad. They are both the horrible ends of the scale. You shouldn't be allowed to force either of them on other people or promote them.  He doesn't like when I am on fatpeoplehate because he thinks I give fat people too much attention. But today as I watched Plus Sized Wars he saw a picture of Tess Munster and when I told him she was a ""model"" he got a bit pale and asked: ""THAT is a model?""  Although he is not a shitlord he knows being overweight is unhealthy and promoting it is dangerous. The reason I am a shitlady is that it pains me to see perfectly healthy people waste their bodies and brag about their crimes while there are so many terminally ill people that would give everything for a healthy body. It is such a waste! Why should we condone or even celebrate food addicts and judge drug addicts? Even if he doesn't share my shitlordery he accepts it because he understands my reasons."

Even days when I am super active at work, workout and play recreational sports, I don't have that many steps. The guy who worked in the UPS (FedEx?)

If you get in trouble, be honest: my period came a week early and I had no tampons. If the bathroom has one of those tampon machines (the ones that you put a quarter into for a cheap vag plug), say it was empty and you had to leave to buy some yourself.   For emergencies like this, I always keep a ziplock bag of tampons of various sizes and tell my female work friends where they can find one if they're in a pinch and I'm not at my desk.

shitladytrollx,33ej89,aaawqe,19,Tue Apr 21 21:46:45 2015 UTC,15-20 lbs is bullshit. More like 2-5 for an already healthy woman. Ask your doc tho.
shitladytrollx,33ej89,paleale_,9,Tue Apr 21 23:24:52 2015 UTC,"When I started my hormonal IUD, the way my OBGYN explained it to me was that the hormones were blocking conception by convincing my body I was already pregnant. Therefore, I'd have a slightly increased appetite. As long as you're aware that it's because of the BC and not because you're actually hungry, you'll be fine.  It's been a few years since I got it, so I might be misremembering this, but I haven't had an uptick."
shitladytrollx,33ej89,heyeurydice,6,Wed Apr 22 14:52:03 2015 UTC,NO! Taking a pill won't magically create fat. It may increase your appetite but you won't suddenly defy thermodynamics and get fat.   Just be aware!
shitladytrollx,33ej89,cjq,8,Wed Apr 22 00:02:41 2015 UTC,Female hormones are stored in fat and by proxy make you fat. You'll crave food more and your body will naturally try to store fat. Basically the pill makes your body think you're pregnant and prepares you for growing a foetus. Try to ignore the cravings and weight gain should be very minimal though.
shitladytrollx,33ej89,MotherOfCrickets,3,Tue Apr 21 22:26:32 2015 UTC,"It may have been the area I grew up in, but most girls went on BC right around puberty (14-17) so it was expected that they gained about 15-20 at that time for normal body growing like boobs and hips for the first time as well as height. But it sounds like you're past that age so you shouldn't have to worry about that much weight gain. Maybe a couple (2-4) pounds at first as your body reacts to the new hormones if you get a BC with them but you should be able to bring it back down to whatever you are now simply."
shitladytrollx,33ej89,BigBooksNotBodies,6,Wed Apr 22 11:53:42 2015 UTC,"It can increase your appetite, but not a lot. I don't think this applies to hormone-free birth control, though. But I'd talk to your doctor about the weight gain side effects, though, because the 15-20 lbs thing sounds ridiculous."
shitladytrollx,33ej89,Skinny_Minnie_,4,Tue Apr 21 22:37:40 2015 UTC,"I was on a pill in college for a short time that gave me what I call ""bottomless stomach syndrome"". I get it when I pms really bad normally, but this was non stop. I wasn't on it long enough to gain much, if any, weight but I'd imagine long term managing that would suck. Doable, but not fun.   More recently I was on another pill that had no such effect. I'm in the process of trimming down to race weight and it didn't hamper weight loss at all. Basically I think it comes down to how the pill reacts with you. If you are willing to try out a few to find the right fit you'll be totally fine."
shitladytrollx,33ej89,MotherOfCrickets,5,Wed Apr 22 01:56:19 2015 UTC,"When I first started HBC, my appetite increased for the first couple months, until my body was used to it. It also increased when I switched prescriptions.  If opt for the Pill, be aware that you might have to try several until you find one that's acceptable. I had to try three or four."
shitladytrollx,33ej89,MotherOfCrickets,2,Wed Apr 22 00:03:59 2015 UTC,"Some people use getting on the pill as an excuse to give into all cravings and get fat because ""the hormones made it happen."" But! If you're aware of your body and don't fill it with crap, you'll be absolutely fine. If you want to eat more when you're on it, just work out more and you'll be fine.

shitladytrollx,33ej89,Butt_Bugles_Beta,1 point,Wed Apr 22 01:58:11 2015 UTC,"Paragard, the one I had before, is a copper IUD and wouldn't help with periods. I loved it bc it is hormone free and lasts ten years, but in general heavier periods are common on it.  Mine got heavier but shorter so, eh, even trade off.   Skyla and Mirana are both hormone IUDs and have a lot of the perks of IUDs in general... Plus most users have a light or no period after a few months. One of the biggest pros for hormone IUDs vs pills- the hormones are very localized rather than all over your body. I don't know if that's actually better but it seems like it would be!  I'm a big proponent of IUDs in general, they are extremely effective, low maintenance, and low side effect. I always say, try it out and worst case you go get it taken out after a few months if it's not for you. The Skyla is particularly designed for women who have never had kids (it's smaller, which oddly makes it at less risk for coming out) and low hormone so that's what I'm going to try next."
shitladytrollx,33ej89,Entitilitus,2,Wed Apr 22 03:20:37 2015 UTC,"I've been on the pill for 6 years now and only noticed a 2kg weight gain when I changed to a different brand so I went back to my original.  Have also tried implants twice, IUD once and now have a tubal scheduled shortly so we will see how much weight drops off when I dont take the pill anymore"

But I always carry PRN medication as a security blanket.  Every year my doctor renews the prescription when it expires.  I am telling you this because I want to underscore that you did not ask for anything unusual, unnecessary, or wrong!  3) I agree that you should get a therapist! Since you say the panic attacks are getting worse over time, I'm sure you know that a good therapist can help you get a handle on them.  It is up to you whether or not you want to use medication, but a therapist can and should help you with both the management and the medication."

Cause the way he's behaving it's like he's lived through a famine and is projecting on you :P  He shouldn't prefer you to be overweight rather than underweight because that's not healthy either, so if he's worried for your health he's not being entirely logical. What's your height? Your weight doesn't sound like anything too unhealthy unless you're really tall, which is why he sounds a bit ridiculous to me. Does he accept bmi as a healthy weight standard? Does he know yours is healthy? Does he realize that 3000 calories a day is friggin ridiculous unless you're like....more than 6 feet tall or something?!"

I'm in recovery and he has an appointment coming up to talk to my social worker so hopefully she can go over some things with him to alleviate his fears."

If you start losing a bunch of weight or are obviously restricting your food intake to dangerous levels, then yeah, getting you to eat more than you want to is fine. But he also needs to understand that if you're in a good place and are overall happy with your body, you don't need him telling you to eat or to gain weight.

Make you sure you ask the counselor to educate him on some of the ways that he can encourage your healthy eating without putting too much pressure on you!

shitladytrollx,337x6g,imaterriblelurker,10,Mon Apr 20 10:28:57 2015 UTC,"Someone posted on /r/talesoffathate about her experience with a fat hairdresser (here).   I had a bad experience in college with a fat hairdresser. I wanted my blonde roots retouched before spring break and was recommended to that place by my mom's friend who lived in that town (turns out she'd never actually been to that hairdresser, she just saw one or two good reviews and thought they'd do a good job). It was horrible!   When I walked in, the fattest woman in there said she would be the one doing my hair. I wasn't a full-fledged shitlady then, so I thought it wouldn't be that terrible, it's just a touch up, hard to screw that up, right? Wrong. First, she spent entire time gabbing to friends, pretty much ignoring me while she was painfully yanking my hair and shoving a comb roughly through it. To make matters worse, there were little kids everywhere, and the parents were just letting them run around and make a mess of everything.   Next, she just put this cheap-looking bright yellow stuff all over my hair, not even bothering with highlights. It burned my scalp and was so painful I became concerned. So I told her how the color looked weird and it was hurting, and she acted all haughty, saying she knew what she was doing and if I didn't like it, I could wash it out myself and leave. So I decided to trust her. When she was done and it was all blow-dried out, it looked...okay. Not great, but passable. So I paid and left. Turns out it only looked good because the entire salon was so poorly lit that pretty much anything would look at least decent.   When I got to my car, I looked at my hair again and it was NEON FUCKING YELLOW!!! No sign of highlights anywhere! And my hair felt like straw and was so incredibly brittle! I went right back in and told her I wanted a refund because it looked awful and felt like it would fall out, plus I pointed out the chemical burns on my scalp. She refused, so I called the credit card company right there and made them cancel the payment (she chased me out and threatened violence  while I was doing it since she was so classy). I also left a horrible Yelp review and contacted the BBB about her.   There's a happy ending to all of this, thankfully! I found someone in town who did emergency hair repairs and booked an appointment with him immediately. He was the sweetest guy and, it turns out, actually knew the woman who destroyed my hair (after hearing about how she treated me, he promised to contact the hairdresser licensing board or whatever and report her-I hope he did because she shouldn't be touching anyone's hair ever). After a few hours of intense TLC and treatment, my hair turned from highlighter yellow to a soft, pale blonde!"
shitladytrollx,337x6g,UsernameOfRassilon,0,Mon Apr 20 15:29:46 2015 UTC,How does body size correlate with ability to do hair? Genuinely curious if this is your reaction to every fat person or if there's something about hair in particular.

shitladytrollx,335sud,alanitoo,29,Sun Apr 19 20:42:09 2015 UTC,"No, you shouldn't be proud of eating three Chinese dinners. Just like you shouldn't be proud of going on a drinking binge and endangering your health.   I can see why trollx gets so triggered by attractive women being objectified by men."
shitladytrollx,335sud,workin_out,18,Sun Apr 19 20:43:09 2015 UTC,"We're just in a culture where it's ""funny"" to overeat. It makes you ""real"" and ""approachable,"" like Jennifer Lawrence. I think we pushed so far away from the heroin chic/no ass/skinny obsession in the 90's and WAAAYYYYY overcompensated by glorifying eating to excess and big booties and thick thighs."
shitladytrollx,335sud,bobthedonkeylurker,10,Sun Apr 19 20:55:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's it at all. I think, rather, that these hams are so obsessed with eating that they ""laugh"" about how much they eat to assuage their deep-seated guilt for being fat due to a lack of selfcontrol.  Being obese isn't funny. Being unable to get out of your bed because you ate 3 chinese meals in one sitting for years isn't funny.  They laugh to hide the internal tears they're crying because they're lost in a world of fat and getting out is hard work and they don't want to do hard work - that's where this obsession with fat being ok comes from. It's the result of a culture in which everyone wins and gets a trophy always, no matter how poor the performance or how great the failure."
shitladytrollx,335sud,workin_out,5,Sun Apr 19 22:44:22 2015 UTC,"I mean, you don't have to be obese to laugh about eating too much. Jennifer Lawrence does all the time and she's at a very healthy BMI. I think it's like an imperfection chic kinda thing. You joke about wanting fries before guys and tell everyone how all you want to do it eat a whole pizza because it's ""funny"" and it's ""in"" to be obsessed with junk food.   I agree that the end result of a mindset like that is obesity and sadness. Most people get a grip and realize they also need to eat in moderation/go to the gym if they want to sustain a lifestyle where they get to pig out on occasion. I still go crazy and have a giant ass cheat meal on occasion, and by GOLLY do I enjoy it. I just also go to the gym 4 days a week and watch calories on all my non cheat days."
shitladytrollx,335sud,BarackOdramaaa,3,Mon Apr 20 03:51:26 2015 UTC,"I know they shout ""guys, food's here!"" when the delivery guy shows up.   I can eat a lot but I don't eat for the rest of the day and go to the gym 3-6 times a week and lift heavy so I can get away with it."
shitladytrollx,335sud,c_i_c_o,7,Mon Apr 20 20:47:19 2015 UTC,"I don't know why anyone bothers to look at anything in that sub anymore. The majority of the time the posts are gross, annoying, or belong in /r/thathappened. The few actually funny things that get posted still aren't funny enough to make up for all the annoying bullshit, in my opinion. I unsubbed the day that I saw a thread where people were basically saying that thin shaming was okay because fat girls ""put up with so much"" that thin girls should just let them do it to have something to enjoy (and they were being upvoted for it)."
shitladytrollx,335sud,buttmuffins123,2,Mon Apr 20 03:42:26 2015 UTC,Because eating your feelings is so cool. Or something.

I told her that I'm at 18.1%BF, which is higher than I'd like to be and something I'm working at lowering, and she said ""I hope you're not getting too skinny."" Like... no mom, I'm healthy. There's a difference."
shitladytrollx,3356ye,Aphypoo,3,Mon Apr 20 00:05:51 2015 UTC,"Wow, 18.1% is great though! How low is your goal? I dance more than I lift, so I don't know my body fat %, but congrats for your hard work and discipline already, and don't stop challenging yourself!"
shitladytrollx,3356ye,Aphypoo,3,Mon Apr 20 01:24:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'm aiming for like 15% at least, I think 10-13%% is the minimum for women for essential fat, but I'm short (5'4.5"") so I think that 15% is a reasonably obtainable goal.  Also, I wish I could dance! But I'm waaaay to nerdy for that, so lifting is the best option haha"
shitladytrollx,3356ye,stellarlullaby,2,Mon Apr 20 04:49:25 2015 UTC,"That's really great, good luck! But don't say it's possible to be too nerdy to dance... I'm the nerdiest person I know and I dance ballet!  Anyway though, lifting is cool too.  :)"

shitladytrollx,334tq1,dreamyta,10,Sun Apr 19 17:59:52 2015 UTC,"I used to believe in HAES when I had a fat best friend. I wanted so hard to believe that she was healthy. She would talk about how she loves walking around and exploring, but she couldn't keep up with me with simple things like going up the stairs or hiking or doing simple yoga without sweating like crazy/getting winded. That's when I started to realize HAES was all a dirty lie. It made me so sad to realize all these well meaning people might be buying into it because they just want to desperately believe that their obese loved ones are healthy. I hope your friend wakes up, OP. There are too many people out there who are willing to believe and perpetuate the harmful HAES agenda. Best of luck!"
shitladytrollx,334tq1,BuenasMigas,5,Sun Apr 19 21:21:21 2015 UTC,What is HAES ?
shitladytrollx,334tq1,BrainInAJar,11,Sun Apr 19 17:26:45 2015 UTC,Health at Every Size. It's the idiotic idea that being fat doesn't cause a whole host of health issues

shitladytrollx,334tq1,aaawqe,3,Sun Apr 19 18:35:01 2015 UTC,"The other gyms supposedly weren't interested in her particular class. In this town,  that's entirely possible.  There aren't many options here."

I weight trained like I normally did with minor adjustments, and every day either an older lady or land whale had to tell me what was best for me.  I usually told them that if my doctor was okay with it,  I was going to continue and if they had a problem they could take it up with him."

shitladytrollx,334q8z,musclebabs_buffpants,3,Sun Apr 19 16:14:29 2015 UTC,Yup. My response was always that my doctor encouraged it -and he DID!
shitladytrollx,334q8z,Planet_muffinmoon,3,Sun Apr 19 17:40:50 2015 UTC,I don't get where some women get off thinking they're smarter than a goddamned doctor. It's downright ridiculously frustrating!

But I worked out through my whole pregnancy, stopped running at about 34 weeks(dr. Orders) but took up spinning and Zumba instead. The amount of hate and ""advise"" I had to take from hambeasts is incredible. I have only gained 10lbs and I hear fatlogic all the time from other pregnant ladies on my pregnancy support group. No you fat lazy slob it Isn't ""luck"" or ""genetics"" it's hard fuckinf work!  You rock it out fellow breeding shitlady!"

shitladytrollx,334q8z,chasingbunnies,4,Sun Apr 19 15:45:19 2015 UTC,"Ive gotten this too, and sadly I'm 6 months pregnant and have gained 22 lbs so far. My family is fat, so they are always pushing junk food/ohmygod don't lift that thing (even though I lift weights!). If anything, weight lifting has kept my lower back strong, and strengthened my pelvic floor from squatting/deadlifting/good mornings.  Anybody had experience with losing some unnecessary lbs while pregnant? I've been able to slow down the weight gain after realizing I'd been gaining too much, so I'm not worried about putting on too much more.... Thankfully I started at a healthy weight though."

shitladytrollx,334q8z,Titty123,2,Sun Apr 19 20:34:33 2015 UTC,"You aren't gaining too much if it's all in your belly. I gained 25 lbs with my son and was down to pre-preg weight in 6 weeks, I'm almost 4 months post partum now. LO was 6 lbs 12 oz at birth. Everyone really is different and 25-30 isn't a lot to gain if you were a healthy weight to begin with. (My normal weight is 110 @ 5'0) Some how I escaped pregnancy without any stretch marks and my stomach is still tight, and that's with gaining a solid 25."
shitladytrollx,334q8z,Literally_Leigh,2,Mon Apr 20 21:59:20 2015 UTC,"What an absolute cunt. Fuck these jealous butterslugs for trying to shame you for staying in proper shape during your pregnancy. Women like that use children as an excuse to turn into lazy gluttonous hogs, so of course they get butthurt when they see someone disproving their fatlogic.   I grew up with older women constantly telling me that I'd better enjoy my figure while I was young and that I'd automatically turn into a fat whale like them once I had kids. I used to have serious doubts about someday having children because of this, but now I know that's all lies spread by fat lazy soccer moms who want to make themselves feel better.   I seriously look up to women like you. Thanks for being a responsible mother and proving the fatties wrong."

shitladytrollx,32xjfk,Aphypoo,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:17:34 2015 UTC,Negatives have helped me a lot and I just started doing them.

I chose it because I do oly lifting and Yelp reviews indicated they had a platform and bumper plates available.  I found the platform but could only see men's bars available. I went to the front desk to ask if they had any women's bars, and the guy told me there was no such thing, all bars are unisex. (Luckily after a few warmup sets I looked around and found a women's bar in the vertical bar storage hiding behind the squat rack.)"
shitladytrollx,32xmg2,AmIABadPersonNah,2,Fri Apr 17 20:09:24 2015 UTC,"As a dumb newbie to lifting, could you possibly explain the difference to me? My bodybuilder brother hasn't told me such a thing exists, so I wasn't even aware there were ""women's bars."""
shitladytrollx,32xmg2,truncatedOctahedron,8,Tue Apr 21 01:08:20 2015 UTC,"Women's bars are slightly shorter and weigh 15kg/35lb (regular men's bars are 20kg/45lb), and the bar has a narrower diameter to accommodate smaller hands. That last bit is important if you do snatches and cleans, because it helps you grip the bar better in a very dynamic movement. If you're just doing the powerlifting movements (squat, bench press, deadlift) though, using the men's bar is usually fine unless you need to start lighter than 45lb."

I am not too too familiar with keto but a friend of mine adds butters and other fats to a lot of his meals to get to enough calories as well.  Good luck!
shitladytrollx,32om9j,workin_out,5,Thu Apr 16 06:57:15 2015 UTC,"Using a second scoop of protein powder and putting two tablespoons of PB in your protein shake would add both extra fat and extra protein, you'll probably just have to make it in a blender to mix in the PB. You can also put olive oil/coconut oil in your shake, I just think PB tastes the best. You could also add heavy cream to your shake and use less of the almond milk. Making yourself eat at least a tiny lunch could also help, even if it's just eating a big spoonful of peanut butter or having a cup of bulletproof coffee.   From my knowledge, your ratio of fat to protein is a little off for keto. You need to have more fat than protein if you want to get to/stay in ketosis, otherwise your body can metabolize the protein in a similar way to carbs.   Best of luck, shit lady!"

shitladytrollx,32m55b,ThatFatPersonSmell,3,Tue Apr 14 22:46:57 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm hoping. It's firm and reminds me of the tiny cyst I've had on my arm for over ten years. It doesn't seem to be causing her any discomfort and the only weird thing about her is that lump that randomly appeared.   I'm wondering if I should wait a week to see if it starts shrinking before going to the vet. She just had a wellness checkup, no vaccines, (although she did get an allergy shot, but that was way down on her mid to lower back), so I'm wondering if it's just best to wait and see or what."
shitladytrollx,32m55b,NicerInPerson,6,Tue Apr 14 22:56:19 2015 UTC,Injections are always given low down on an appendage to be safe so the lump is probably not from that. I don't think you should wait a week because if there are abnormal cells inside it is best to address it as early as possible since it's easier to remove a small lump. Fibrosarcomas are common in that area and are perfectly treatable if they are removed early. You could begin by calling your vet and telling them about the situation.   EDIT: I recommend clarifying with your vet that they do not administer injections to the shoulder blade area.
shitladytrollx,32m55b,ThatFatPersonSmell,3,Tue Apr 14 23:46:30 2015 UTC,"Alright, I'll call tomorrow morning and see what they say and bring her in sometime this week if they're concerned.

I've found that a lot of sites just aren't in English yet. I'm not sure if it will ever pick up in the US.  You also don't need any fancy tools. I use a yarn needle and acrylic yarn to practice with. Since it doesn't felt, which is the easy way to join yarn, I use a Russian join. It's a pretty forgiving craft, so if you screw up it probably won't be noticeable."

Try joining a club or connecting with people in your classes by setting up a study group. And I know most universities offer free counseling sessions for students, so if you need someone to talk to, take advantage of them.   College can get incredibly lonely for some people, so know you're not the only person dealing with this. Again, it will get better!  PM me if you ever need someone to talk to!

shitladytrollx,322gf7,YourPoetrySucks,4,Fri Apr 10 19:50:40 2015 UTC,"You are absolutely right I edited my response. I realized soon after posting it that it was rude and hoped to take it back before it was seen. I'm sorry I said it, but I stand by my statement. We will not tolerate brigading and my fellow mod and I will get that across to the members of this growing community.    ...don't act like its <sic> some sort of mystery or you are a <sic> reserving judgement until you do a full analysis    I realize that there is some brigading, however, instead of accusing us of brigading within our own community through upvoting the posts we agree with and downvoting the ones we don't agree with, you could realize as we have these last few days that we are the ones being brigaded with downvote trolls. What we do within our own community is our business. However, if I find that members of this community are brigading on other subreddits, I will deal with them. If you choose to comment on this sub, you are taking a risk of being either upvoted or downvoted by each person who sees your statement. If people are downvoting you, then they must not agree with what you're saying. Move on, it's not a big deal. Not everyone will agree.  I absolutely will reserve judgement until I am able to ascertain all the facts. If you don't like it, tough, but I refuse to act rashly or before I know both sides of a situation. Yes, I will defend my own, but since I also take responsibility of the contributors to this subreddit, I will also strive to make sure they understand what behaviors will and will not be tolerated within the community.    And as for /u/yourpoetrysucks' statement, yes, we are affiliated with FPH and most of our members are active participants to both subreddits. I see nothing wrong with someone making a statement regarding their participation on an affiliated sub."
shitladytrollx,322gf7,Sturgeon_Swimulator,1 point,Fri Apr 10 21:12:14 2015 UTC,"My comments were in no way directed towards any actions taking place within this sub, of course my comments here are going to be down voted that is both fully expected and reasonable. I am referring entirely to comments within TrollX. You are intentionally misconstruing my points.   Yourpoetrysucks is commenting in TrollX, the actual one, not this place, about this sub and FPH and defending them. Then commenting here in this thread about that defense and driving traffic to the TrollX thread. That is brigading. None of my comments have been about the actions inside this sub, nor do I particularly care what happens here in a place dedicated to hate and shame.   Your attempts to sound all official and mod-ly are kinda weak considering how you are intentionally interpreting my comment incorrectly.   Whatever, you can act as official as you like but brigading of TrollX by users both in this thread and from FPH is clearly occurring.  Sorry about the misspellings, my phone and I don't get along so well."
shitladytrollx,322gf7,Sturgeon_Swimulator,0,Fri Apr 10 22:07:40 2015 UTC,"I misunderstood your comment, it was not intentionally interpreted. The support users of the shitladytroll and FPH communities receive from one another isn't really any of your business. If you don't like what's going on within this corner of reddit, you don't have to participate. And since the mods of both subreddits are in communication with one another and are on friendly terms, directing users from one sub to the other is both tolerated and encouraged. If members here are brigading on other, non-affiliated subreddits, I will deal with them.   My ""attempts to sound all official and mod-ly"" are actually an attempt to allow you to make your case and have your voice heard in spite of your not being a member of this community instead of just banning you from commenting altogether. If you don't like that I am trying to engage you in a civil manner, then simply stop responding. Problem solved.   And the misspellings are fine. I'm just anal with grammar and spelling."
shitladytrollx,322gf7,YourPoetrySucks,1 point,Fri Apr 10 22:16:36 2015 UTC,"And you are still missing the point, to the degree that there is no way of saying it isn't intentional. I don't care at all what happens to this corner of reddit. Not the point. I don't care about this subs relationship with fph, also not the point.  Okay, one last try. This isn't about the shitlady/fph relationship. Thats however you want it to be. When someone from shitlady comes into TrollX and starts defending fat hate, be it of the shitlady or fph variety, then comments here in this thread about it attracting users to brigade into the TrollX thread its a violation of the rules of reddit. That is the point. People are coming from here, shitlady, and into TrollX to argue in support of fat hate and up voting fellow shitlady posters while down voting others. Thats brigading. It has nothing to do with voting inside this sub and nothing to do with this subs relationship with fat people hate. I don't understand why I have to explain this three times to be honest. People saying ""do you have a link? Oh you are really standing your ground, keep it up"" and following back into TrollX is brigading. It is also specifically against the rules of reddit site wide.  What you decide to do about it is up to you, this is your little part of the world and thats fine, keep it the way you like it, but I hope you at least understand what I am talking about now.  I have no problem with engaging in conversation, but if you are going to argue back against points I haven't made and claim that I am complaining about getting down votes inside the walls of your sub or that my points are being down voted here when that isn't the point at all, nor the meaning of 'brigade' then I get a bit irritated."

shitladytrollx,320uiv,sharkchaser,4,Fri Apr 10 00:52:31 2015 UTC,"I said ""I don't believe I heard what you said correctly,  would you mind repeating that?"" So they have to think if they want to say it to my face.  I think her reply was ""I was just saying it was easy to eat when you are so naturally thin"".   She and I went a few rounds later in the year due to her being disrepectful and her boss had to tell her that she would go to HR if she even looked in my direction wrong.

Why does every single highschool science teacher use balloons in their demonstrations? ;_;    Interestingly enough though, I'm fine with water balloons. Foil balloons depends on how I'm feeling that day. I also apparently liked balloons as a kid, then at some point they became NOPE."

The only thing I can think of is that the uh, Treasure Island? hotel in Vegas with the loud cannon firing from the boat outside spooked me as a child, which through a strange series of events might have given me a fear of balloons.    The worst part is someday I want to be a pediatric surgeon and I'll probably have to walk into patient rooms with balloons in it. ;_;"

shitladytrollx,31xcsh,stellarlullaby,5,Thu Apr 9 02:22:15 2015 UTC,I have one irrational fear that I can think of. I can't sit in my car with the door open and my feet on the pavement in a parking lot. For some reason I am always at least slightly afraid of someone pulling around and smashing the door into my legs.  My rational fear is also parking lot related: Those huge drainage grates always seem like they're going to swallow my phone or keys and make it a huge pain in the ass to get them back.
shitladytrollx,31xcsh,rootytootypirate69,3,Thu Apr 9 02:26:39 2015 UTC,The Ocean.  But I feel that is a perfectly valid and rational fear. That fucker will kill you. And have you seen what comes out of it?   Fuck the Ocean.
shitladytrollx,31xcsh,FrozenKlondyke,3,Thu Apr 9 14:32:13 2015 UTC,I have a strange fear that I'm much uglier/stupider/worse singer than I think I am or others have told me. I guess seeing other people lie to avoid making others feel bad is what keeps this in the back of my mind.

Before issues arose I was training for a 10km race against a train... Don't think I'll be making it this year still, will settle at this point to be able to run 10km again period, let alone a sub 1hr time. Just taking it 1 day at a time for now, hoping for no more injuries."

I'm 25 this May, so it's been quite the journey. I'm still trying to get rid of the hanging skin.   My main motivation is that I just don't want to be back in the place I was when I was fat. My depression is hard enought o manage without the added trouble of hating myself and my body.   I also find that having a bunch of pictures/blogs whatever of people I aspire to look like helps a lot. Right now it's a lot of LeeLem0n and Samantha Wright."

shitladytrollx,31tecf,Moxianna,1 point,Wed Apr 8 14:02:04 2015 UTC,"Mmmmmm. My plum dessert was Afghan inspired, and that's pretty much how the Afghans I used to work with would drink their tea - green tea, usually with little cardamom pod things in it, and some would add/substitute rose and/or mint. It smelled amazing, so yeah, that would def work!  I've not been able to get it to smell quite the same when I've tried to replicate it. It's probably the brand of tea making the difference..."

shitladytrollx,31q2s7,fat_is_a_choice,7,Tue Apr 7 14:34:11 2015 UTC,No wedding/baby pics   I'm sure memes/reaction gifs about weddings or kids wouldn't be annoying. Just no wedding spam or baby fever (I think there's a subreddit for shitlord parents but I can't find it).   No circle jerking about food   Agreed to an extent-I say food posts are okay as long as they're constructive to the subreddit (i.e. they entice meaningful dialogue).
shitladytrollx,31q2s7,dropthefffork,7,Tue Apr 7 16:01:08 2015 UTC,The shitlord parenting reddit is /r/nofatkids

shitladytrollx,31q2s7,ThatFatPersonSmell,2,Wed Apr 8 01:58:25 2015 UTC,Thank you!
shitladytrollx,31q2s7,ThatFatPersonSmell,12,Tue Apr 7 17:05:38 2015 UTC,"Here are some things I have in mind for the sub (a few taken from my response to /u/dropthefffork's suggestions):   No spamming the subreddit with wedding/baby pictures (according to the wonderful /u/fat_is_a_choice, the shitlord sub for parents is /r/nofatkids)   Memes/reaction gifs relating to getting married/engaged or becoming pregnant/giving birth/frustrating things related to kids or parents are okay, but if you wish to share pictures of your wedding/engagement/pregnancy/kids/whatever, post the album in the comments.  Food-related posts are okay as long as they encourage meaningful dialogue (i.e. talking about period/pregnancy cravings, starting a new diet, asking for diet tips, etc.). If there's a big need for diet tips or recipes, separate subs can be created, but let's not have this subreddit be dominated by posts relating to food. Again, a few posts are fine, but only if they encourage a dialogue. This is not /r/fatpeoplehate. What we are is a community of women (and men!) discussing gender-relevant issues, personal problems, venting, etc., without tolerating or condoning fatlogic or glorifying obesity. If you want to vent about being called a ""skinny bitch"" or being bullied/harassed because you're eating healthy foods or working out, that's fine, but let's leave the fat shaming posts for the relevant FPH subreddits. Posts about periods, relationship problems, insecurities, farts, diarrhea, things your mom does that annoy you, work drama and the like are encouraged! Again, we're here to foster a community identical to the original trollX one without tolerating bullshit.  Occasional posts on insecurity, depression, anxiety, etc. are okay, but note that this is not a self help or mental health subreddit. Beat your depression or overcome your anxiety? That's great! We'll celebrate with you! Taking a bubble bath after a stressful day? That's a good post, too! But if you're posting too much (or only posting) about dealing with depression/anxiety/whatever, we'll be directing you to a more relevant subreddit. We aren't a sub dedicated to helping others deal with or overcome mental health issues. We can offer the occasional encouragement, but please don't treat us like we're your therapist."
shitladytrollx,31q2s7,christmasinLA,7,Tue Apr 7 16:17:32 2015 UTC,"While I agree with you and don't wish this sub to become overrun by posts relating to mental health and confidence issues (and will actively work on calling out folks with a victim mentality complex), I understand that there are people out there (myself included) who are dealing with anxiety or who feel awkward.   This place is a safe haven. If someone dealing with anxiety or depression wants to make a post about it, I won't discourage them. What I will discourage, however, are people who post only on those topics. Our primary objective isn't to help people deal with or overcome anxiety and as mods, we will direct those individuals to other subreddits more focused on depression or anxiety posts.   I understand that even skinny girls have issues with confidence, so I won't discourage someone for making a post or two about that, either. But, again, the purpose of this subreddit isn't to cater to people looking for an attention fix, and those who are just looking for attention will be directed to /r/shitlordsGW.   So to reiterate, here is what will and will not be tolerated on this sub:   The occasional post about social anxiety or depression - OK Frequent (as in, over 4/mo) posts about social anxiety or depression, or posts asking for advice dealing with anxiety or depression - Not OK The occasional reaction gif/meme relating to lack of confidence or a post relating to how you're dealing with low self-esteem (i.e. ""I'm feeling crummy so I'm working out in red lipstick"" or ""A hot cup of tea and a good book to chase away the I hate myself PMS blues"" type of thing) - OK Posts seeking attention (""Tell me I'm pretty,"" ""OMG, life sux so here's a pic of my butthole,"" ""Is this dress too tight I feel fat"") - Not OK"

Personally I like pointing out ridiculous posts that show up on that sub because it's posts like those that drove us away.

I was so proud of myself. I looked her straight in the eye and didn't get mad but calmly explained how wrong she was and moved on with the show.   Oh and the disgustingly huge co-worker in the group was right in front of me with her gut sticking out from under her shirt. I made sure to give her some pointed looks during the talk.

shitladytrollx,31a439,imaterriblelurker,2,Fri Apr 3 23:49:43 2015 UTC,I'm really enjoying Stephen King's 11/22/63 novel.    It's fast paced and gripping.    A Sci-Fi / historical fiction about a man that goes back in time to prevent the assassination of JFK.   But the past is a very obstinate thing...
shitladytrollx,31a439,Amplitude,0,Mon Apr 20 11:05:34 2015 UTC,"If you haven't already, check out King's Different Seasons collections. It has four novellas in it. Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption (adapted into the movie The Shawshank Redemption) and The Body (adapted into Stand By Me) are my two favorite from the collection. The Apt Pupil is one of the most fucked up things I've ever read, and The Breathing Method didn't leave a huge impression, still good though. I love these by King because they deal with human evil and I think he is a master of the short story."

Interesting history: Ghost Soldiers  by Hampton Sides, Mrs Kennedy by Barbara Leaming, pretty accessible, not boring.   C.s. Lewis's Screwtape Letters if you're looking for something a little different, it was fast and fun.   The Shopaholic series, i read it many years ago, but I remember it being pretty funny."

About the future of humans, where they've been divided into 'colors' (classes) and how one man from the lowest color (red) infiltrates the highest (gold). Lots of mind games, politico and fighting.

Keep losing and the pooch will eventually shrink. For a lot of women it's the last thing to go.  Stomach swelling after eating can be an indication of food intolerance, so you may want to start keeping track of what you eat to see if the swelling correlates with a particular type of food. I had the same problem until I found out I had a food allergy and cut that food out of my diet.  ETA: I'd also highly recommend some strength training. It won't spot reduce fat but it will help with the squishy issue. You might also want to consider adding some HIIT into your cardio rotation. Gotta love that EPOC."
shitladytrollx,301asv,fat_is_a_choice,27,Mon Mar 23 18:12:24 2015 UTC,abs are made in the kitchen    Abs are made in the gym. They are revealed in the kitchen. If all she does is run then she most likely has a shit core and if she eventually does get a flat tummy she might not have abs. Core excercises will define the muscle. Diet will get rid of the flab hiding them

shitladytrollx,301asv,fat_is_a_choice,2,Fri Apr 3 00:23:49 2015 UTC,"Actually there is a truth behind the whole ""abs are made in the kitchen"" thing. Abs are not hypertrophy capable and therefore will never be able to gain mass in the same way as your biceps. non-scientific source (sorry not a native English speaker)   So while I agree that core workout is important for your abdominal muscles, having a low bodyfat percentage (single digits for men, women idk) will have a much higher impact on the result. The optimum for a training probably lies in a combination of both."

shitladytrollx,301asv,GuldeneKatz,0,Wed Apr 8 13:08:02 2015 UTC,Eating high protein (1g per lb) while maintaining a caloric deficit (80-90% TDEE). You won't see much improvement in your lifts while you're dieting and with such a small deficit it might feel like forever before you see results. BUT between the protein intake and the weight training you should be able to preserve muscle mass and lose fat.
shitladytrollx,301asv,DoctorShitlady,2,Wed Apr 8 17:49:03 2015 UTC,"So I should watch out for what could be causing an allergy! Never would have thought of that, lol  Also, about HIIT. Any way to incorporate that into my run routine? I basically go 5k, 6 days a week."
shitladytrollx,301asv,fat_is_a_choice,3,Mon Mar 23 18:46:23 2015 UTC,"Why not try swapping one run day a week for HIIT at first. HIIT focuses on intensity rather than distance, so you could do it with sprints but wouldn't be going 5K on that day. You could also do it with burpees, on a recumbent bike or elliptical. Anything that gets your heart rate up.  There are a million different methods, just look around online and start with one that sounds good to you. I do 30 seconds of effort with 90 seconds rest x 8 twice a week.  A heart rate monitor is really helpful to make sure you're getting up to 90% of you max heart rate, especially at first."

The only gym I have access to is two hours away and enroute from college, so I can only go on very specific days when my schedule magically aligns with the gym gods. Time to switch up my schedule!  Also, about diet- should I be counting macros? Or is calorie in/out enough?"
shitladytrollx,301asv,Dragonfiremule,2,Fri Apr 3 03:29:01 2015 UTC,"Hahhaha thanks! For days you can't go to the gym there are some body exercises you can do! Pushups, pullups, crunches, lunges, etc. They're not big muscle builders because they don't have a lot of weight, but they work! You can also get dumbbells! Dumbbell squats are good for when you can't do the bigger weights yet anyway.    Calorie in/calorie out should be good! I personally count my carbs & protein as well but thats not totally necessary! Its up to whatever you want. To determine your TDEE (calories out, basically) you should use this (http://iifym.com/tdee-calculator/) or a similar link. A lot of the ""calories burned during this exercise"" from myfitnesspal/the machines is pretty inaccurate; don't try to subtract that from your calories. Just eat your TDEE (myfitnesspal is still great for couting calories!).  Good luck on your fitness journey!! You can do it! :D"

Do your normal routine plus reduce your calories.   Spot fat removal is a VICIOUS LIE AND A FARCE.   Once your belly is not squishy (gross), do some core work in the gym. I recommend getting a session of personal training to help your form IRL and show you where in your gym the stuff is for what you want."
