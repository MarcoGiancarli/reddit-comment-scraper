visualization,3dbgxf,merdiocracy,2,Wed Jul 15 11:29:19 2015 UTC,"I would call the orientation a wash. Verticality for age increasing makes intuitive sense. And none of the data displayed on the graph is causative. This is all just correlation/comparison. The causes of the distributions are not on the chart at all.   The left/right view makes it easier to see the shapes of the two distributions independently, and it's not hard to see significant differences in those distributions. The primary piece of information being displayed is how population is distributed by age. Differences between genders is secondary.  Changing the display to interleave the gender distributions doesn't clarify the chart, it just switches what the focus is. It's easier to see small differences between genders in the same age bracket, but the overall population distribution is muddled.   The switch to proportions in point 3 completely removes the primary point of the graph: comparing population at different age brackets. Fine if your primary intent is to focus on the gender proportion, but that's not the primary point of a population pyramid."

That's an excellent point. Both the min and max y-values will affect the shape of the graph, so focusing on 'zero or not zero' is absurd without a similar focus on where to decide the max.  When I made this graph of carbon monoxide I originally had it start at y = 0. But that made absolutely no sense: it obscured the trend that is more important than the raw values—though it also did something else much more subtle and dangerous: it implied that zero was an important value, as if carbon monoxide should be zero, and the lower the better. This of course is not at all the case.  Carbon monoxide is important to environmental processes, and while human activities have certainly increased it, by no means should it ever be zero. Thus highlighting the long term trend trumps a focus on the distance from zero—which is a value these data would never reasonably reach (not while humans exist to graph them, anyway!)."

Use his GDP example. It correctly shows that the financial crisis wasn't a massive shrinkage of the economy. That's a true story! Probably what he should have shown to make the point he wanted was GDP growth.

visualization,394wmb,OliverOnTheWeb,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:34:48 2015 UTC,"But I feel like by building a visualization you are already ""storytelling"" because you're relying on visual cues to explain what the data mean, and you're making choices about how ""best"" to convey the meaning of the data. If you really want the data to speak for themselves, you would have to present it raw -- but then most people won't understand it.  So while I certainly understand the fear that by focusing on storytelling the visualizer is prone to accidentally feeding their biases into the data, any visualization does involve interpreting the data, which means the designer is inserting their biases. You can never completely abolish your subjectivity if your goal is to make the data more meaningful.   It seems to me that by saying Quartz is focusing on storytelling what they are really doing is acknowledging this act of interpretation and saying they want to do it consciously, so they DONT misrepresent the data -- which is a good thing."

Obviously we're storytelling with visualizations, and should. But there's a natural way for most data to be presented. For most things, it's relative to some standard (like 98.6 for body temperature). If there's no reasonable standard, you go with 0.  What I was objecting to was the idea that---separate from the good reasons not to start at 0, like the body temperature or log scale examples---""because it will tell my story better"" is not a valid reason to alter your scale, and that doing it for ""storytelling"" reasons is not different than doing it for deceptive reasons, especially if not everyone agrees with your interpretation of the data."

I personally would say that is is one of those times where there is a legitimate reason not to start at zero. What does a GDP of zero even mean in context of the US economy? The US would cease to exist well before GDP decreased all the way to zero. I think what you call ""massive shrinkage of the economy"" is very relative. It looks like the US economy shrank from a total GDP of 14.8 trillion or so to around 14.3 trillion (the actual data would tell us, which brings me to a point later). That 500 billion in real wealth is still a very large amount of money and reflects a large amount of real world suffering by many people, even though it is ""only"" a little over 3.3% contraction. Most economists would call this, at the very least, a large loss.    how can one tell the difference between playing with the axis to be deceptive and playing with it for the sake of ""storytelling""?   By getting at the actual data yourself and seeing what you make out of it versus what was presented. This is why openness in data is so critically important."
visualization,394wmb,sci901,3,Tue Jun 9 17:50:07 2015 UTC,"I personally would say that is is one of those times where there is a legitimate reason not to start at zero. What does a GDP of zero even mean in context of the US economy? The US would cease to exist well before GDP decreased all the way to zero. I think what you call ""massive shrinkage of the economy"" is very relative. It looks like the US economy shrank from a total GDP of 14.8 trillion or so to around 14.3 trillion (the actual data would tell us, which brings me to a point later). That 500 billion in real wealth is still a very large amount of money and reflects a large amount of real world suffering by many people, even though it is ""only"" a little over 3.3% contraction. Most economists would call this, at the very least, a large loss.    My point isn't that the recession isn't a large one, my point is that if you want to show that, you should choose the right series. GDP does have a meaningful zero (or very near it) when you look across time and across countries. When you want to talk about recessions, you should use growth rates---which is what economists use (and how they define recessions). That would show you that, as recessions go, this was a huge one. But we shouldn't torture the wrong series to show what we want.   By getting at the actual data yourself and seeing what you make out of it versus what was presented. This is why openness in data is so critically important.   Well, sure. But under the assumption that most visualizations are for people who won't do that, there's not a functional difference between fudging axes for deceptive and narrative reasons. In fact, most people who get accused of the former probably believe they're doing the latter."

Cool, I didn't know that. Can you steer to me to any reading about that?   Assuming that is true (I have no reason to doubt you, I suppose that the GDP of a medieval society as compared to the current GDP of the US is practically zero) then you have a good point. A better time series could have been chosen.   But under the assumption that most visualizations are for people who won't do that, there's not a functional difference between fudging axes for deceptive and narrative reasons.   So how can we present data in an honest manner without having lots of extraneous whitespace?"
visualization,394wmb,sci901,0,Tue Jun 9 18:27:00 2015 UTC,"Really? Cool, I didn't know that. Can you steer to me to any reading about that?   The most interesting work on Historical GDP was started by the late Angus Maddison, and is really quite fascinating.  When you get further and further back in those series (which are rough estimates of course, but still), you get a sense of how mindbogglingly rich we've gotten in most of the world.   So how can we present data in an honest manner without having lots of extraneous whitespace?   By thinking hard about our data series and avoiding arbitrary choices. Take the body temperature example: if you start from zero it doesn't show much. But we know that body temperature has a min-max range, and that there's a standard temperature of about 98.6. So displaying that range makes sense, and there's a specific reason for the dimensions you would choose.  In other cases you'll want to choose the right transformation. If what makes sense logically is deviation from trend, then show that. If what makes sense is rates of growth, show that. If what makes sense is proportional changes, log that sucker. We can make choices. But generally, the choices should be obvious before you make the chart and say, ""well, that doesn't really fit the story I want to tell, so I'll wiggle things until it does."""

I think that the zeroed graph can be misunderstood because it makes it seem that the recession was a very slight decrease in activity, because the relative difference between the different data points is very small as compared to the area shown."
visualization,394wmb,sci901,10,Tue Jun 9 17:33:27 2015 UTC,"Why should the y start at zero and stop around the max value of the chart? Maybe the y should always go to 1,000 a 1,000,000? The rule of starting the y at 0 is as ridiculous as coming up with rules about where the y should stop. With line graphs you should try to get rid off as many white space as possible and part of that is to get you y axis to start a little below MIN value and stop a little above MAX value."
visualization,394wmb,sci901,3,Tue Jun 9 11:44:24 2015 UTC,I would be more worried when tricks with scaling are played. I agree with the article. Show the data. Clearly label the axes. And trust your viewer.

And sometimes that rate does drop to zero, so having a zero on the y axis for that plot makes sense.  And other times I make plots of fuel remaining. Having a zero doesn't really make sense most of the time because A) the fuel sensing system isn't very accurate at very low fuel capacities B) the plane will fall out of the sky as it runs out of gas. If I were plotting from a test where fuel WAS brought down to zero, then sure, a zero makes sense, but under normal circumstances it does not."

With more than a couple of series, it gets a bit annoying. I've never found a smoother way.   Charting in Excel is a mess of different dialogs that are very sensitive to where and how you bring them up. ""Select Data"" is for changing your series, their labels, etc. Hitting an axis and choosing ""Format"" lets you do things like logarithmic scales (which you'll probably need for this dataset). Hitting something else and choosing ""Format"" lets you do all the other things. Click something once, and you select everything like it (all bars, points in that series, or whatever.) Click it repeatedly and if you're lucky you may be able to select a single point. Once you learn these patterns (or anti-patterns), it's pretty flexible.  Excel can sometimes do decent guesses when you just hit the ""Chart"" button, but I usually have to back it up by going through the data dialog."

If there is a process in place that they are following, part of your work may be done. Regardless, you can interview the users and monitor their usage of their tools to catch anything they missed, as well as build/verify the process graph they are using.  As part of the data collection, or doing interview coding afterwards, you can find duplications of effort, wasted steps, other sources of irritation, etc.  These issues can be illustrated on a process graph a la this or this. Create a graph visualization using whatever tooling is appropriate: NodeXL, Gephi, D3. Then you can use color, size, shape to annotate nodes (points in the process) with any relevant issues.  I would have labeled nodes, then use a gray->orange scale for severity of the issue, shape for type of issue, and size for time spent on step. That way you could point to a set of  big orange parallel nodes and say ""this is an enormous timewasting set of redundant processes"", or point to a frequently occurring but small, orange process as click-through annoyances that can be eliminated."

Try to measure these in various ways.  For number 1, you could show a graph of many times users clicked 'not applicable', or how much time it takes to get to a point where you have to select 'not applicable', whatever the case may be in your scenario, find a way to measure it then show visualizations based on those measures.

visualization,378655,CJMinard,1 point,Tue May 26 18:59:21 2015 UTC,"Good question.  I feel like having more basic visualizations isn't a trivial thing.  I discovered RAW when I was building Graphla, and was definitely inspired by some things in their UI.  However, RAW has a couple problems in my mind.  One, as you mentioned is its lack of providing basic viz options.  On their github page, they have some condescending remarks about bar and pie charts.  While I know these chart types are often ridiculed, they still have a place in the data viz world, and can be a good starting point for exploring your data.  (These tools are about iterating through the viz process quickly, and simple graphs are still part of that process)  Secondly, RAW visualizations are static, and lack interactivity.  In Graphla, I make use of several features in the D3.js framework for making graphs more interactive, such as zooming, transitioning, and tooltips.  For example, in the circle pack visualization, without zooming and panning, it gets difficult to read the rendered graph.  You need to be able to zoom into the visualization, especially when the hierarchies get deep.  Also, the bubble graph in Graphla lets you choose an ""iterator"" which allows you to create a motion chart.  At the very least, I try to add tooltips to my graphs so that it makes exploring the visualization easier.  I was really tempted just to contribute to or fork RAW after I found it, but it doesn't seem like an active project (the last commit was in Sept of last year).  The developers seem really talented and have a wide array of skills, but I'm also assuming they have day jobs. Graphla is not a side project for me.  I quit my job to focus on it, and it's a 60-80 hour a week obsession at this point.  The beta may not seem that different than RAW, but the plans I have are.  I'm working on building up the back-end now so that you can actually save the interactive visualization and get a link to share.  I'm also working on building 3rd party data API's and data connectors to pull in data from sources you're already working with.  At least that's my plan.  I'm running low on money, and will either have to make Graphla pay for itself, or find paid work again soon.  Thanks for bringing up RAW, I was hoping someone would.

The map shows fare estimates that our users are making in real time -- It shows the pickup location on the map. Which is why some locations you might see are super precise (like a street address) and others might just be a city name or zipcode.  If there's a surge for the fare the user just made, the map uses an orange-red color marker on the map instead of that blue (shade of red depending on how high the surge is) - Which is cool because on weekend nights/huge events or holidays, you can really see the surges pop up across the map.

visualization,35onug,staceyrieck,2,Tue May 12 06:44:25 2015 UTC,"Sorry if this is a little hastily written and has typos, I wrote out a longer response and hit refresh right as I was about to submit... this my second time writing this out.  1) I'd suggest making the timeline and the totals the same width in the chart (""centering"" the separator between them, instead of giving more space to the chronological series on the left).   I understand that it's the same data on each side, but the fact that the green bar for Java in the chronological section is 4x the size of the corresponding bar on the totals immediately triggers a gut reaction that something is off and undermines the chart right off the bat.   If you're going to represent time with a bar chart, be consistent with your ratio of ""chart ink"" to time. Feel free to push back on this... maybe it will make the totals take up too much space and throw off the aesthetics. But with only a few exceptions, I'd always advise using equal geometry/area to represent the same value. I find it adds unnecessary cognitive overheard to keep adjusting when data consumers compare between the two sides.  2) I'm less confident on this point, but it could be cool to add some sort of mean and std.dev. lines overlaid on the total bars. You could show the typical years of experience with various technologies for others with similar industry experience or however you might define your ""peer set"". I'm less confident that this would be an improvement and I imagine defining a peer set would be subjective. I'd try it if you have any data on that... you never truly know what insights you'll get from a viz until to see the real thing. Best example I could find quickly was something like this http://peltiertech.com/images/2010-12/TextLabel2007Bar08.png  3) An alternative to #2 would be to show just a line and bar chart to show your experience with each technology compares to the total time each technology has been in popular use. Some of these would much less, but I imagine Python and Android would fill up a decent % of total ""period of existence"" for those two skills.  4) Finally, instead of arranging semi-chronologically try sorting from top to bottom by total experience. Not sure to what extent that will give a different perspective, but I imagine it's a trivial change to make, so is it at least worth doing a quick test if that changes the story."
visualization,35onug,jslacks,1 point,Tue May 12 09:59:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for your feedback.  1) I've been thinking about how I would implement this elegantly such that the scale for both sets of data are the same. What I would really like to do is combine the two together and make it interactive. When the gantt chart is clicked on, it transforms to the bar chart by each row sliding to the left and combining together. I'll have to figure out how to code that but I agree it's not ideal having two different scales.  2)I'm not so sure about comparing with peers purely because it is subjective. I'm not sure how I would determine how many years of experience the average person with my skills has. I guess I could say that I've been programming Matlab longer than average, but how much, and how do I even find that number?  3/4) Both of these would be interesting ideas to try. I will probably do some tests this evening.   Another thing I want to think about is also conveying what this information means. Especially with #3, I would need to explain the meaning of the data. At the moment I am happy with how self-explanatory it is (I think, at least).  Thanks again for your input. I appreciate the feedback."

In that case, it would be better to to make them relative.  I've also got a small criticism on this phrase: ""the occupations become less gender specific"". That's not correct. Some occupations became less gender specific. E.g., secretary and construction worker hardly moved. If they all became less gender specific, they'd need to be closer to the middle line.

visualization,34wuzr,OkToBeTakei,2,Tue May 5 06:31:26 2015 UTC,"While the comments so far are focusing on the colors from a purely aesthetic standpoint, I think it's important to mention that in political pieces like this, the blue-red binary was chosen intentionally because it is politically polarizing.  As it happens, though, the attempt to use softer colors to, perhaps, make the effect more subtle, makes the graph look murky and the information (and underlying political message itself) somewhat less obvious. On top of that, it's dry and cramped. It's not a very good infographic.  My rating: blue poopies  Edit: spells and misspells"
visualization,34wuzr,merdiocracy,1 point,Tue May 5 18:58:05 2015 UTC,"Use of color should in general be limited to code secondary values for which no room is left, or which are not scalar. It is almost impossible to read an accurate value from a color. What's wrong with coding their position as bar length.  In this case, the data is vague, so you could argue that accurate readout is irrelevant: it doesn't matter whether you see a value as roughly between 40% and 60% or as 54.18%. So, a rating like system, with e.g. 5 stars or other symbols, would have worked as well, or even better. In this instance, symbols are probably not good, since people assign meaning to those symbols, so bar length would be both clear and unambiguous.  BTW: logantauranga's color scheme is objectively better, because it avoids problems with color blindness."

If you don't have multidimensional coordinates, but have pairwise distances between points, and need to project them into a low-D space, then you use MDS.  It sounds like your case falls in the 1st category, so PCA (or some modification of it) would be the way to go.  Then, on top of it, you can run cluster analysis.
