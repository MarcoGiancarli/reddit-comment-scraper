NYCFC,3e31me,derek_villa,5,Tue Jul 21 16:01:51 2015 UTC,"Coming from England the development system in this country is bat shit insane to me but it seems to be getting better.  NYCFC could get a massive leg up on the competition just by implementing the UK system which CFG should know inside out.  Even just two basic steps would make a world of difference:   Step 1, if a kid is good at the sport, don't risk turning them away by making them pay for training.  Subsidise your affiliates if that's what it takes.  I can only imagine the amount of talent over the years that couldn't afford training.  Step 2 provide an education and accommodation for them so that they don't end up in crappy high school and college systems (i.e. NCAA, which doesn't even play the game by the official rules).  This way you're getting good players from all socio-economic backgrounds and not losing them on the cusp of first team action to a system that will undo all of your good work.    Like you say, Philly's experiment is making some good steps in this direction but with the money behind NYCFC I can only imagine they can afford to much, much better."

I've been wondering what's going on behind the scenes as far as building academies and such. Out of curiosity, what news sources do you follow to keep track of these developments?  Thinking long-term, NYCFC has some real advantages in being based in the country's largest population center, with so many soccer-inclined immigrant groups represented in large numbers. As your post suggests, eliminating pay-to-play requirements and building relationships with other established NYC institutions (Columbia, DOE...) are absolute no-brainer things NYCFC should be doing in order to take advantage of the club's location in the city."

NYCFC,3e2nfi,darkknightofNYCFC,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:44:11 2015 UTC,I think that's what he meant
NYCFC,3e2nfi,TheReelMalik,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:01:29 2015 UTC,That why I said when they stop liking money. At the same time I don't think 20% of NYCFC is the biggest deal to the Yankees so if they become more trouble then they're worth I think they would cut ties.
NYCFC,3e2nfi,perpetual_student,5,Tue Jul 21 21:36:33 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't make sense for them to ""kick us out."" They own a 20% stake in the team.  The only way we leave YS is if we found somewhere else to play."

NYCFC,3e2nfi,ImGoingToForgetThis_,2,Tue Jul 21 18:08:43 2015 UTC,"As to why I think this because I believe that Soccer fans tend to be a bit more rowdy, for lack of a better word, then what they'd prefer inside their stadium, that along with just the cost of converting the pitch from baseball to soccer, and vice versa, as well as maintenance, and paying your staff it ends up adding up. That being said I'm positive they're aware of the benefits of having us here, the match day revenues and all that.  But it is a seemingly tenuous relationship at best. But we're there till we have a ground of our own, so we'll all just trudge along."
NYCFC,3e2nfi,spirolateral,0,Tue Jul 21 18:11:58 2015 UTC,"More rowdy? An average baseball game maybe, but I take it you've never been to a really important game or a playoff game at the stadium. So much more rowdy, and it's the whole stadium, not just the ""supporters"". It's untrue that soccer fans are now rowdy in general. A small subset, yes. But those people don't even watch the game. The sing and dance with no regard to what's going on on the field. Not much of a fan in my opinion."

NYCFC,3e2nfi,spirolateral,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:01:02 2015 UTC,"Cost of conversion and damage to the field are more than enough reason to want the teams on different stadiums.

NYCFC,3dyyw5,dekal630,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:53:38 2015 UTC,Nice breakdown of the goal. My two biggest problems during this sequence was Jacobson moving way too far up the field for no reason because Hall is no real threat with the ball there especially since McNamara was recovering. This left so much space in front of the back line. Next was Iraola who had no business stepping up leaving the wide open space for nguyen to make his run. This could have been a communication error though as Looch needs to call out Nguyens run and Facey was already moving towards the ball so Iraola did not also need to step which could come down to chemistry or communication again.
NYCFC,3dyyw5,Gavin1026,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:57:24 2015 UTC,This goal doesn't really bother me.  That's some great link up play from the Revs.  Lovely little back heel from Kobayashi.  Solid strike from Nguyen.  The real problem was going man down.

NYCFC,3dxpve,samugolinifirenze,14,Mon Jul 20 11:58:57 2015 UTC,Cutting them at this stage would provide no benefit to NYCFC because their salary will continue to count against the cap.

I hope you have an awesome time & I see great advice here. One thing I wanted to say coming from personal experience. This season in the row behind us sits a dad with his son (looks also about 13). Now, I was raised in Latin America and have watched soccer surrounded by family since I was a little girl- and cursing was always part of that. Early this season my friends and were enjoying the game (occasionally cursing both in English and Spanish.) I hadn't seen the dad and kid behind me at this point. He got my attention and very rudely yelled at me to stop cursing. He shut me down and saddened the game- but obviously there was still cursing that didn't come from me. If you bring your kid to a sports game, there will be bad language. Don't know if that bothers you but wanted to let you know. If you do see someone getting out of line and want to keep your kid from hearing it, please correct them nicely."

NYCFC,3duyzf,perpetual_student,2,Mon Jul 20 14:40:45 2015 UTC,Depends on the section. Some are lightning quick.
NYCFC,3duyzf,bkstr,0,Mon Jul 20 06:02:33 2015 UTC,Bring your own stuff!!! Unless it's beer...
NYCFC,3duyzf,philbobalboa,7,Mon Jul 20 15:39:33 2015 UTC,"If you're not sitting in the supporters section, arrival time won't matter much.  The stadium is equipped to deal with twice as many people as our normal capacity so getting in and out of the stadium is usually quick and easy.  Getting to the match, from the Upper West Side you can take the D train right to the stadium, or you can drive.  If you get there early enough there will be parking on nearby streets that aren't too far of a walk to the stadium, otherwise parking runs you between $25-$35 depending on which lot you use.  City Beats is usually out front of the stadium before and after matches just doing their thing, there's a couple restaurants (bar and grill type) across the street from the stadium on River Ave that are pretty good."
NYCFC,3duyzf,philbobalboa,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:18:41 2015 UTC,We're not in the supporter's section but are looking at the area from about section 207-217. Thoughts?
NYCFC,3duyzf,snark_nerd,7,Sun Jul 19 19:34:52 2015 UTC,"don't yell ""sit down"" to people who are standing up to cheer/watching something exciting happen- stand up with them. The 200s have a lot of people who don't stand/cheer/participate in the cheering at all. shout out to Row 3/4 of 215; Poku's porch."
NYCFC,3duyzf,jgweiss,6,Sun Jul 19 22:30:52 2015 UTC,We'll probably be the standers.
NYCFC,3duyzf,snark_nerd,2,Sun Jul 19 22:41:21 2015 UTC,"Yea. I'm in 212. Some stand, some don't. I love the game too much to really care what others do. Just have fun. You're looking in sections where there isn't too much roudiness(exactly why I picked it) and it's great being a sun shade. Make sure you don't try to get drinks or food during halftime. You'll be standing behind a family of 11 for 45 minutes. Enjoy!!!"
NYCFC,3duyzf,jgweiss,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:44:17 2015 UTC,"What do you mean ""it's great being a sun shade.""? I don't want to look into the sun all game, but it's a 7:00 start. Will it be a problem? If so, for how long?"
NYCFC,3duyzf,snark_nerd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:26:31 2015 UTC,The sun faces the supporters section. It's much cooler from 205 to about 225 because the sun will be going down behind us and the 300 section overhangs. I don't like the heat.
NYCFC,3duyzf,thethirstbk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:29:18 2015 UTC,"from the Upper West Side you can take the D train right to the stadium, or you can drive.    Just a note, /u/GoudaJoe, these are not the only options from the Upper West Side. I lived there until recently, and to get to games (I'm a season ticket holder), I would take the 2 to the 4 often. Just use Hopstop or, in a pinch, Google Maps' transit directions to map it out (making sure to specify the date of the match - weekend and game day schedules differ).    As for entrance into the stadium, if you arrive at least an hour before match time, you should have no problem entering (gotta wait in a line and go through a metal detector), but the best bet IMO is Gate 8 - walk past the ""main entrance"" craziness, up River Ave (which is closed to vehicle traffic), and into a much easier and quicker entrance. After entering, go to the left (past the Mohegan Sun Club and the Walk of Heroes or whatever), and you'll be at a stairwell that goes practically straight to your section.    Hope this helps; enjoy the game. We're happy you're coming!"
NYCFC,3duyzf,spirolateral,5,Mon Jul 20 15:09:02 2015 UTC,"This may seem irrelevant, and I SWEAR THIS IS NOT A SHOT AT NYCFC, but you are any kind of baseball fan, monument park is open at some point before game time, probably until like 45 minutes to kickoff, and the Yankees museum is open and empty. My dad and I are lifetime Mets fans and were very happy to go before the rbny game, it's a great piece of baseball culture.  207 is a good section, I'd highly recommend it over sitting behind the goal between 208-215. Pretty spectacular sweeping views."

NYCFC,3duyzf,JohnnyCashFan69,0,Mon Jul 20 15:40:44 2015 UTC,"You can bring bags. I'm not sure the size limit for things like back packs. But plastic shopping bags with food and drinks, I've brought pretty large ones in before. They just check the contents first. Drinks make sure they're sealed. Food, you can bring anything. Bagged snacks, sandwiches, hot meals, whatever. For years we've been bringing waters and drinks at the very least before every game. Snacks usually too. And if we have time, sandwiches for a meal. You'd be surprised at how much money you save by not buying their food and drink. I hate when I'm running late and am forced to buy drinks there. So expensive."
NYCFC,3duyzf,handsomewolves,2,Mon Jul 20 15:57:17 2015 UTC,"Hi! I recently went to a game and sat in section 136 directly in front of the supporters section. I would not recommend bringing a kid to those sections. I had an awesome time there but for a kid it might not be so fun. Everyone was standing for most of the game, people were swearing freely, and when there was a goal people were celebrating intensely. I would suggest sitting in sections 231-227B. You have a great view of the game and the supporters section.   Definitely take the subway to the game. An awesome experience and the station is right by Yankee Stadium. There are lots of free NYC subway apps you can download to help you around. I use Embark NYC. In terms of arrival time, plan to arrive anywhere between 30 minutes and an hour before the game to give you time to get into the stadium and find your seats. When you get there, keep walking around the stadium to find gates with less people. Everyone makes the mistake of mobbing the first gate right by the subway station even though there are several others further down with much less traffic.   Hope you enjoy!"
NYCFC,3duyzf,franch,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:19:32 2015 UTC,"Getting to YS from the UWS is kinda dumb? The quickest way to do it is to go downtown on the 1 or C to 59th street and then transfer to the uptown D. It takes about a half hour or so, we usually leave home about an hour before game time just in case, so we can get food and whatnot.  You can bring in sealed bottles of water, which is smart since a bottle of water at YS is $5."
NYCFC,3duyzf,JohnnyCashFan69,6,Sun Jul 19 19:20:17 2015 UTC,He's better off taking the ACBD (depending on the stop) up to 125th and waiting for the next D. From the UWS - it's a really easy commute to the game.
NYCFC,3duyzf,franch,4,Sun Jul 19 20:03:02 2015 UTC,I live on the UWS - it depends on where he's going from. The uptown trains by us have been all kinds of F-d up this summer.

NYCFC,3duyzf,franch,3,Sun Jul 19 19:33:11 2015 UTC,"No problem... it's not really that difficult and if you are confused just ask someone. As long as you're not standing in the way of people trying to walk almost everyone will be happy to help. Plus on game days you can usually just follow the people in light blue shirts once you get to the stations. The stop is directly across the street from the stadium.  Don't bring backpacks if you can avoid it. No laptops/computers. No aerosols either (so no spray on sunscreen). There are some bars nearby that have lockers if you HAVE to have them with you, but they won't let them into the stadium.  The lower numbers of the sections you're looking at (207-210ish) will likely be in direct sunlight for the whole game. The others will still be sunny, so bring a hat/sunglasses and wear sunscreen."
NYCFC,3duyzf,JohnnyCashFan69,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:00:49 2015 UTC,"Still in direct sun for a 7:00 game? Hadn't thought of that. I assumed the other side of the stadium would provide shade, but not when you're sitting just as high on the other side of the stadium, I guess.  Edit: Game time."

You want to sit on the opposite side of the field for that. That's my friendly suggestion to you. During the game they advertise a number you can anonymously text if there are rowdy fans around you. Take that number down because no one will listen to you if you tell them to calm down.

NYCFC,3dsy9r,daveedgamboa,11,Sun Jul 19 14:18:26 2015 UTC,Pro: Pirlo and maybe Lampard will be here in the next game  Con: Our defense was nonexistent for most of the match
NYCFC,3dsy9r,daveedgamboa,8,Sun Jul 19 03:59:03 2015 UTC,Pro: Saunders looked great and it was awesome to see the passion in Villa  Con: Iraola looks really off. Could be adjusting but his passes and overall ball control were awful.
NYCFC,3dsy9r,kcash935,6,Sun Jul 19 03:56:53 2015 UTC,Iraola has looked out of sorts. I'm hoping with another few weeks getting to know the players he'll do better. He's really underperforming.

NYCFC,3dsy9r,dekal630,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:43:54 2015 UTC,He drifts around the pitch and out of position way too much. He was caught out on the NE goal which forced Ballouchy to cover and ultimately get torched by Nguyen. It's nice that he wants to get forward and be aggressive but he's clearly not on the same page with his teammates yet. Hopefully time improves that but it was pretty rough to watch tonight.

NYCFC,3ds8zf,spirolateral,6,Sun Jul 19 00:00:31 2015 UTC,Should not even be an issue in the league at this point. They need to get rid of it already. The league is pretty mature now and they're likely making money. No team should have to play on this crap.

NYCFC,3ds8zf,spirolateral,2,Sun Jul 19 14:52:05 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not a professional athlete, but I have played on turf before and it is much different. One reason for the hate is that the game is different on it. The ball moves faster, kicking it is different, running and sliding is different. All around different game. Second, it's no good on the body. I only have very little experience and can attest to definitely feeling different and being scraped up a lot more, and can see that if played at the speed of the pro game, I'd have likely been even worse off. Not to mention if you were on a team that played their home games there. Even aside from my small amount of first hand experience, pro players mention this all the time. Anyone with bad knees, or bad anything really that's affected by the impact of landing your feet to the ground, will be worse off on a surface that doesn't give like natural grass.   So, different game and worse on the body equals hate for turf."

How easily are tickets bought? Our leagues incredibly difficult to buy tickets due to demand, but as the MLS is younger I imagine they're easier to get hold of (although the stadiums always seem pretty full)."
NYCFC,3ds8zf,BrianEDenton,3,Sun Jul 19 00:08:20 2015 UTC,Let me know what dates you'll be here. I'll be fairly busy in August and might be able to gift you my tickets if the dates work out. Feel free to PM me!

NYCFC,3ds8zf,omgahippy,2,Sun Jul 19 00:09:32 2015 UTC,It's just a case of buying them and printing them? Any signing up or anything? And how much are tickets?  It varies massively by league so thanks for the help!

NYCFC,3dqusp,Gavin1026,2,Sat Jul 18 16:07:27 2015 UTC,"We definitely need a left back since Angelino is only on loan and Robbie Rodgers would be great. Brad Evans is a good CB, but I would rather go younger and cheaper. I think we have young guys on this roster who could be Villa's partner up top. Mullins has played well and will only get better. Shelton and Poku are other possibilities although they are more likely to play in the midfield. If we were to get another striker I would not want Barrett or Oduro. Barrett is an average MLS striker at best and Oduro is fast but that is it."

The MLS All-Star game is a bit more of an attempt at brand exposure by pitting our best players against a team of high notoriety.
NYCFC,3dp0ca,n33mers,4,Sat Jul 18 02:25:16 2015 UTC,The only sport in which the All-Star game matters is in MLB. This is because the winner of that game meaning AL or ML gets home field advantage in the World Series.

NYCFC,3dmpo1,pointsforeffort,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:02:52 2015 UTC,I was thinking the same. I'm surprised the difference in income levels hasn't hurt their friendship / chemistry.
NYCFC,3dmpo1,perpetual_student,8,Fri Jul 17 19:03:53 2015 UTC,"Josh Williams making $125k is ludicrous to me.  He's played like 5 games and not looked particularly good in many, and we have Iraola now.  Let Jeb and RJ back up the wing spots and dump his ass.  EDIT: Grabavoy making $200k hurts, too."
NYCFC,3dmpo1,dekal630,4,Fri Jul 17 15:08:26 2015 UTC,We got Andoni on a ridiculously low salary. Man props to whoever picked him up. If he's making 200k Williams should be making 60k.
NYCFC,3dmpo1,perpetual_student,5,Fri Jul 17 15:24:01 2015 UTC,Iraola's salary is prorated.
NYCFC,3dmpo1,dekal630,3,Fri Jul 17 15:53:33 2015 UTC,so actually 400k? That's still not bad at all.
NYCFC,3dmpo1,dekal630,2,Fri Jul 17 16:58:04 2015 UTC,If it's prorated why is Lampard listed as 6M shouldn't it be 3M? I also doubt that we're paying Mena 400k and that the 200K show is prorated.
NYCFC,3dmpo1,ncquake24,4,Fri Jul 17 19:40:19 2015 UTC,Because he's technically been under contract the entire season.

NYCFC,3dmpo1,RhubarbManBB,6,Fri Jul 17 18:18:05 2015 UTC,"It's just brutal looking at these numbers. Legends playing next to semi-pros. Very difficult to build a team this way. For all the progress MLS has made, to talk of any kind of elite level is just ridiculous. And assuming that Pirlos and Lampards salary cap hits are prorated for this season, how are we going to afford anyone next year?"
NYCFC,3dmpo1,RhubarbManBB,2,Fri Jul 17 15:53:13 2015 UTC,"Remember that as DPs Pirlo, Lampard and Villa's salaries don't count towards the salary cap. The real issue is NYC is already out of international slots (hence the inability to sign Mashamaite), and they're right up against the salary cap thanks to the additions of Iraola and Mena. So it'll take trades to free up roster spots and cash to spend for next year, most likely."
NYCFC,3dmpo1,ChvyVele,4,Fri Jul 17 15:56:19 2015 UTC,"I'm new to MLS, but I thought part of the DP salaries (like 436k or so) do count against the cap, no?"
NYCFC,3dmpo1,perpetual_student,2,Fri Jul 17 16:01:34 2015 UTC,"Yep, you're right."
NYCFC,3dmpo1,RhubarbManBB,2,Fri Jul 17 16:04:36 2015 UTC,"Remember that as DPs Pirlo, Lampard and Villa's salaries don't count towards the salary cap.   Not entirely true.  They count as max-contract players (~$435k) unless they were signed in the summer window, where their cap hit is prorated to half the full value (~$218k)   In 2015, a Designated Player over the age of 23** will carry a salary budget charge of $436,250, unless the player joins his club after the opening of the Secondary Transfer Window, in which case his budget charge will be $218,125.

NYCFC,3dmpo1,dekal630,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:09:04 2015 UTC,Maybe his contract is non-guaranteed bc he was hurt when we signed him?
NYCFC,3dmpo1,NYCsoccerfan,2,Fri Jul 17 15:19:31 2015 UTC,Is it not listed because of DL from beginning of season?

NYCFC,3dmpo1,NYCsoccerfan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:28:12 2015 UTC,I'm not sure I saw that and my best guess was because he was a part of the team for a couple games and then got injured. I hope we didn't cut John.
NYCFC,3dmpo1,RhubarbManBB,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:59:02 2015 UTC,Just checked and Zemanski of Portland has been out since before season started and he's also listed.   Might have been cut.

NYCFC,3dmpo1,stone_cold_bubs,2,Fri Jul 17 17:23:32 2015 UTC,At his age all players are given a guaranteed contract which takes effect July 1.
NYCFC,3dmpo1,perpetual_student,2,Fri Jul 17 15:27:59 2015 UTC,"If my math is roughly correct, they'll have to find an extra $836k in salary cap space next season to keep Mena and Iraola at the same salary. How's that gonna work?"
NYCFC,3dmpo1,stone_cold_bubs,4,Fri Jul 17 16:18:08 2015 UTC,"$501k coming off just in loans at the end of the year, minus the 1-year contract players.  They'll find the money."
NYCFC,3dmpo1,perpetual_student,2,Fri Jul 17 16:52:14 2015 UTC,"plus you gotta think that at the end of the year the increased attendance, ratings, tv deals, and overall interest in the league may cause another one of these impromptu rule changes that brings more salary to the teams"
NYCFC,3dmpo1,RhubarbManBB,3,Fri Jul 17 16:58:30 2015 UTC,It may just be written into the CBA that the cap increases annually (that's one of the parts we don't know yet).

NYCFC,3dmga6,joshdts,5,Fri Jul 17 14:03:55 2015 UTC,If they're holding off to debut him with Pirlo they can fuck off. Football decisions shouldn't be made based on ratings and gate numbers. I'd like to think that's not the case.  Edit: shouldn't be made...not should.
NYCFC,3dmga6,puckinright,6,Fri Jul 17 16:38:19 2015 UTC,"i think next week's matchup and Pirlo are just convenient. With the injury they probably do not want to take the risk on turf.  which begs the question, are we always going to need to worry about this with lampard/villa/pirlo on turf?"
NYCFC,3dmga6,rusmore,2,Fri Jul 17 14:02:35 2015 UTC,"Villa's played a turf game, no?  I think there's just so many variables at work here: new to the league, new to the squad, coming off the injury, not really used to turf.  It just makes sense to hold off another week and let him debut at home.  If this were a playoff game, I don't think there's any question Lampard would be there."
NYCFC,3dmga6,puckinright,2,Fri Jul 17 14:49:49 2015 UTC,believe the first orlando city game was on turf now that i think about it.  do agree though.
NYCFC,3dmga6,D_RoyJenkins,3,Fri Jul 17 16:31:44 2015 UTC,I think it's more about Lampard coming off a calf strain.

NYCFC,3dmga6,Gavin1026,3,Fri Jul 17 14:16:44 2015 UTC,If he dresses for the game he takes a spot in the 18 so we will have one less player to chose from as a sub.

NYCFC,3dmga6,justdrastik,8,Fri Jul 17 14:34:39 2015 UTC,"Relax.. We're at the bottom of the table, and like 3 points out of 3rd place. And we're an expansion team. Do you know how rare it is for expansions teams to even be playing as well as we are?   Plus, he's nursing an injury, and why risk him, when the team is playing very well as is. Give him an extra week of practice, to heal, and to get acquainted with Pirlo. He was likely to only be playing as a sub against NE anyways."

Upper90 has a Pirlo replica away available. The only real difference between an authentic and a replica is the NYC logo on the nape, the inaugural season jocktag, and the MLS sleeve logos. It's up to you if that's not a dealbreaker.  The only place to buy the rare ""Authentic"" aways seems to be Yankee Stadium nowadays, and even those are very hard to find.

NYCFC,3dmn0w,Westchester_kid,3,Fri Jul 17 19:22:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not new to the sport or the team, but some weird I've never seen had recently been used. With all the supporter's groups being restricted lately, the word ""tifo"" was used multiple times. I'm sure I could search for it, but I figured this would be a good place to ask. What is tifo? I'm sure it has something to do with songs, chants, flags or banners, or something else related to SG actions, but I don't know as I'm not a SG type. Thanks."
NYCFC,3dmn0w,spirolateral,2,Fri Jul 17 19:58:08 2015 UTC,"In Italian, the word tifosi literally means fans and fare tifo loosely means to cheer. I've seen MLS fans saying tifo in reference to the large banners the SG display after the national anthem (or maybe before?)."
NYCFC,3dmn0w,ChvyVele,2,Fri Jul 17 20:22:02 2015 UTC,"Ahhh OK, so our SGs can bring in large banners to away games. I wish they'd ban them altogether, but avoiding them is easy enough I suppose. Thanks!"
NYCFC,3dmn0w,spirolateral,2,Fri Jul 17 22:51:02 2015 UTC,Why would you want to ban things like this?!
NYCFC,3dmn0w,ChvyVele,2,Fri Jul 17 23:20:29 2015 UTC,"Just not a fan, even though that's fine and not during the game so I don't mind much. I was at a game once, one of the few times in the ""supporter's section"", and after each goal I blocked for a minute or so because the whole section got covered in a stupid fucking flag. It's almost like these people in these groups don't care about watching games."
NYCFC,3dmn0w,spirolateral,3,Fri Jul 17 23:32:02 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I'm with you on that. I like tifos before kickoff but I avoid supporters sections for the same reasons you mentioned. I often feel like people in the supporters sections are there to sing and jump around instead of watching the game. Which is fine, but not my thing."
NYCFC,3dmn0w,jshaq333,2,Fri Jul 17 23:41:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's weird to see people at a game not really into the game. If that's their thing then so be it, but I just don't get it. The whole stadium will be reacting to a play on the field while our ""supporters"" seem to not even notice what's going on at all. The whole idea of these glorified fan clubs make no sense to me. There are definitely more hardcore supporters not sitting in those sections. Supporters that know the game, know the players, follow the play. Not just jumping up and down singing and throwing smoke bombs. To each their own, but still, it's a sport. The game should be number one, period."
NYCFC,3dmn0w,JohnnyCashFan69,3,Sat Jul 18 01:37:36 2015 UTC,"Why can't the all-star team just be an east vs. west thing like the NBA?

The Yankees will try to get it done of no progress is made soon. I say we're there 3 years tops, or in the 4th year there's a stadium being built at the least.

NYCFC,3dmb2s,The-Puppetmaster,4,Fri Jul 17 12:48:01 2015 UTC,If he's good enough why don't we try and make room?
NYCFC,3dmb2s,dekal630,4,Fri Jul 17 13:27:15 2015 UTC,"According to the original Kickoff article, the roster restrictions were just too crazy.  I had said to /u/NYCsoccerfan the other day after Mena was introduced that it was suspicious.  One of the reasons Tefu left Kaizer Chiefs was because he wanted more money, whereas  in comparison Mena is making pennies.  It sounds like the creative accounting just wasn't creative enough, though the kickoff article makes it sound like we were asking the league for more allocation money or some kind of roster concession or something.  There's definitely more to it."
NYCFC,3dmb2s,perpetual_student,2,Fri Jul 17 14:34:35 2015 UTC,Idk what's going on. If the front office tried to sign an international while already being out of both international spots AND roster spots maybe it means the front office doesn't know MLS rules.   We don't know how much any of our players are earning aside from the DPs. For all we know we're overpaying everyone.
NYCFC,3dmb2s,NYCsoccerfan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:41:54 2015 UTC,But isn't there some small maximum that non DPs can possibly make?
NYCFC,3dmb2s,spirolateral,2,Fri Jul 17 14:53:27 2015 UTC,"~$430k, but we also can't exceed the roster cap of ~$3.5 million.  Our team salary right now (with DP money included) is ~$17 million, so we almost definitely could not sign Tefu to a max contract.  I'm wondering if we were looking for concessions on guaranteed money counting (or in this case, not counting) against the salary cap after a player is cut or something."
NYCFC,3dmb2s,perpetual_student,2,Fri Jul 17 15:58:12 2015 UTC,That's what I was thinking. They may be something more to this.

Even though they have DC, everyone has acknowledged that there is something between the two teams from the fans, players, and media. So far, I do feel a bit of tension towards Toronto, but that could also blow over. We had two games where we got stuck in with them."

""The Third Rail.""  It's like something that came out a small town newspaper straw poll.  The whole concept of having a club-endorsed, big tent supporters group from day one was just a hopeless fantasy.  Building these things takes time.  It takes a community of people who demonstrate a long term, game day commitment.  People who share a common approach to supporting the club, and have developed a sense of trust in one another.  A shared history.  We just don't have any of those things.  I truly applaud the enthusiasm of everyone in the supporters' sections who are on their feet, bringing noise, for 90 minutes.  But I really wish, for the good of this club, and for our stadium environment, that people would take a step back and allow these groups to splinter.  We need more voices in leadership positions with smaller spheres of influence.  Let smaller groups of supporters lead by example, experiment with chants and choreography.  Quit trying to funnel everything through some arbitrary leadership structure.  Eventually this club will have a supporters' culture that it can be proud of.  Quit rushing it."

I am not much for supporters clubs or any of that, but I think this applies to a lot of what you see around the team. NYCFC is brand new and that's an inescapable fact no matter how hard everyone around the team works to shorten the learning curve.  It applies on the field with coaches and players - Jason Kreis can't recreate his RSL success overnight. An assortment of castoffs, young projects and aging stars can't steamroll MLS right out of the gate.   And it also applies to ""culture"".  The supporters groups need time to develop. Fans need time to develop. Shit I've been to all but one home game and a couple away games now and it still feels brand new. Just getting used to the routine of game day, etc.   All season it's felt like fans want this club to be 10-20 years old already. It's not. It's a brand new team with a weird roster playing games in a baseball stadium. Just enjoy the ride, everything will come with time.

NYCFC,3dj61v,csm119,10,Thu Jul 16 18:47:16 2015 UTC,"He is doing that, but to be fair to him and Jonathan, they have the most positive influence on the game day experience than anyone else.  Look at the board.  TWO of FOUR are responsible for marketing and merchandise.  Billy and Jonathan communicate with the FO about away trips, organize and run them (along with another guy who coordinates ticket sales), and put up their own money and time to create tifos.  Do I think they're going about trying to make a positive difference in a totally mature way?  Not really.  Am I inclined to stand behind them because of their impact and influence on their fellow supporters?  Absolutely.    TR's current leadership run the thing more like a business than a supporters group (and they don't do it very well, either since no one actually knows where their membership fees go).  Fuck your merchandise, I don't need 18 TR scarves.  I need an active and supportive leadership that positively impacts game day experiences."

He has nurtured and condoned the last 12 hours of posts on the TR Facebook group, including encouraging and endorsing personal, sexist assaults on current Third Rail members and board members.

He said on the page that since he doesn't agree with the board, he'd rather blow up the supporters group than see it continue. Hijacking the Instagram account to trash the group is the worst kind of immature.  It's childish and stupid. How you can be so arrogant to put your own power trips above the club you claim to love is beyond me. He's more concerned about making Third Rail look bad than supporting this team and his actions show that.  And this whole mess also shows the big problem with Facebook: the algorithm emphasizes LOUD speech, not smart speech. If Billy posts something and the ten or so people who consistently ""like"" his posts do so, it jumps to the top of the page. Meanwhile, rational conversation gets dropped because no one likes or comments.  This is a supporters group of more than 1,000 people, but if you read that page, it's the same handful of members causing trouble. Go on the chapter's individual pages and everyone is talking about how ridiculous it is that he's hijacked the group. But that stuff won't get leaked.  If TR was smart, they'd shut that thing down once they get it back. Billy's already turned it into a toxic wasteland by inviting in Red Bulls fans and ex-members who are attacking people. Now he can turn it back over to the board and let them sift through his mess. Plus, the Third Rail now has egg on its face. By all accounts, he's succeeded.  He had done so much for this group and for this cause. Why he would destroy it all just because he didn't get his way is astounding.   He had good points, honest points and important points about transparency and the way the organization is run. But I honestly don't care if he helped paint a tifo or got supplies or founded the group. He's encouraging fans of this team to disband, the exact opposite of why we're here."
NYCFC,3dj61v,darkknightofNYCFC,-5,Thu Jul 16 19:54:10 2015 UTC,Billy is pulling the covers off the membership's eyes. People should be informed and know what is happening.
NYCFC,3dj61v,darkknightofNYCFC,8,Fri Jul 17 17:03:51 2015 UTC,I completely agree.  The problem is he went about 10 steps further than that.
NYCFC,3dj61v,path2success,-5,Thu Jul 16 20:09:51 2015 UTC,"He had to. Diplomacy hasn't worked. The Board tried to pull ""you have no authority"" bullcrap. They forget that an SG is a union of supporters. Without the supporters there is no SG."

NYCFC,3dj61v,EinWindir,7,Fri Jul 17 11:28:34 2015 UTC,There's a bunch of folks from /r/nycfc in Hearts of Oak. We're only half as evil as people think. Come down to Yankee Bar & Grill for a pregame or Warren 77 in downtown for an away match.

NYCFC,3dj61v,UnbiasedOnionRing,2,Thu Jul 16 18:41:37 2015 UTC,Hearts of Oak doesn't own a section. As a result we coexist with folks that are either members of another SG or not associated with anyone. At times people will get upset with each other. Did it happen? Not exactly as OP claimed but there was an exchange between people. But blaming Hearts of Oak as an entire organization for ONE incident with ONE person is an unfair generalization of the group.
NYCFC,3dj61v,thewelldressedpt,3,Fri Jul 17 03:59:08 2015 UTC,"Agreed. You can't blame one organization for the actions of one of its members, HoO or TR or BBSC or any of the others, and I'm sure all that 238 drama is just that: internet drama.   That said, everyone's gotta get their guys under control.  Case in point: Supporters from TR or wherever throw shit on the field. Now all the supporters groups are punished.

While I am starting to despise NFL more by the day,  the Giants are a classy organization.  Even Tom Landry, the classy, long time coach of the Dallas Cowboys, was a Giants fan.  So I am totally cool with the NY Futbol Giants being a second name.  Honestly, at some point it would be bad ass if the Giants ownership bought out City group and NYCFC became a 100% New York owned and operated team.  Plus the Giants ownership has just as much and maybe more money as sheik....whatever his name is."

NYCFC,3dey5j,maxsten,6,Wed Jul 15 19:11:47 2015 UTC,His positivity is really infectious. Glad to see a player of his attitude and experience put on the blue.
NYCFC,3dey5j,i8thepie,3,Wed Jul 15 21:20:11 2015 UTC,I agree and he's incredibly humble. Amazing pick up by the team.
NYCFC,3dey5j,dekal630,3,Wed Jul 15 22:45:58 2015 UTC,"The smile on his face when asked about having Villa, Lampard & Pirlo on his team was strikingly genuine"
NYCFC,3dey5j,uchuskies08,3,Thu Jul 16 02:11:08 2015 UTC,"Happy to see him in the team. Very impressive English as well, coming from the Basque country."
NYCFC,3dey5j,iPoobee,2,Wed Jul 15 20:25:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've been wondering like... why does he know English? lol that sounds weird, like of course people know multiple languages, but he's Spanish and played in Spain his whole life."
NYCFC,3dey5j,lazyflowingriver,3,Thu Jul 16 01:26:00 2015 UTC,"It's very common for the average European to speak English, it's a universal language for a reason :P Footballers don't tend to speak it unless they play in an English speaking country though, and even then sometimes they don't learn it.   His fluency is pretty impressive though, I imagine he's fluent in at least 3 languages which is cool, English, Castillian and probably Basque."
NYCFC,3dey5j,iPoobee,3,Thu Jul 16 01:57:22 2015 UTC,"He didn't have the best of debuts, but he has the experience and quality of playing in the La Liga to help our defence kick on. I think he'll be a huge influence to Angelino."
NYCFC,3dey5j,AndrewWyllie,2,Wed Jul 15 20:48:54 2015 UTC,"I'm continuing to believe he'll have a bigger impact than some of the other new guys.  Lampard and Pirlo will be awesome, but a really solid right back, especially in the context of our horrible back line, can really change things.  He wasn't a perfect fit right away, but I think if we actually had competent center backs, we can use our fullbacks much more in a 2-way sense."
NYCFC,3dey5j,swampy13,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:57:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah both him and Angelino were definitely very good going forward, which is fine provided we have solid CBs."

NYCFC,3ddn2v,The-Puppetmaster,9,Wed Jul 15 13:22:13 2015 UTC,"Man, am I excited about this kid. He'll likely go back to MCFC in a year or two, but his skill on the ball is great. Only concern is he is a little small when covering crosses/set pieces and seems to be weaker than your average MLS player. But that may get better with age."
NYCFC,3ddn2v,yomisterd,3,Wed Jul 15 13:38:46 2015 UTC,"Agreed, while we may only have him for a few years i think he can be a real asset. Finding a skilled attack minded fullback in the MLS is rare, I think he is going to slot great into the type of style Kreis wants us to play. Coupled with the pacey defense we are trying to build I'm excited to see how our back line turns out."
NYCFC,3ddn2v,vidalismatthew,4,Wed Jul 15 13:45:04 2015 UTC,while we may only have him for a few years   A few years? I thought he was only on loan?
NYCFC,3ddn2v,ChairmanW,2,Wed Jul 15 16:21:26 2015 UTC,"Unless he's going to sit the bench for Man City, we'll likely continue to get him until they deem him ready.  It's a strange relationship. We're not a youth team for them, but we sure reap the benefits of their talented youth players until they're ready for the premier league."
NYCFC,3ddn2v,ChairmanW,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:52:43 2015 UTC,Honestly it's great because I think the MLS is a better test for their young players than being on the Development Team since they'll be playing with grown men here and face the burden of being on a first team.
NYCFC,3ddn2v,ncquake24,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:34:57 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a win-win. They get a more comprehensive development for their young future players, we get those players until they're ready, and they're usually of a high quality.  Additionally, if they decide a young player isn't part of their plans anymore, guess who gets them at first request?"

NYCFC,3ddn2v,NYCFCPodcast,2,Wed Jul 15 22:59:59 2015 UTC,More likely us as Citygroup has a huge investment in seeing NYCFC succeed and could make more money from us than from a single player sale to an outside team.

NYCFC,3ddme4,lazyflowingriver,2,Wed Jul 15 15:43:03 2015 UTC,I also think he performed well enough against the Cosmos to deserve a place here.
NYCFC,3ddme4,ibpants,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:57:23 2015 UTC,"I think he probably looked better because for three quarters of the match the Cosmos kept lofting balls into the box.  Fair enough if Akira Fitzgerald had been in net, but Eirik will catch those all day long."

NYCFC,3ddme4,lazyflowingriver,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:39:39 2015 UTC,I think obviously it needs to be either a midfielder or Nemec. Alvarez is 35 and with the additions of pirlo and lampard it seems as if we will be moving away from wide players. I could also see Velasquez or Calle but with Mena from the same team as Calle they might be more likely to keep him on board.
NYCFC,3ddme4,ChairmanW,3,Wed Jul 15 15:05:19 2015 UTC,"In the small amount of time we've seen Calle play, I think he's looked better than Alvarez or Velasquez. Plus he can slot in at LB or in the midfield. Guy's just gotta stay fit..."
NYCFC,3ddme4,ChairmanW,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:11:22 2015 UTC,I would choose Nemec then Alvarez.
NYCFC,3ddme4,ncquake24,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:28:42 2015 UTC,Nemec.
NYCFC,3ddme4,lazyflowingriver,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:28:02 2015 UTC,"There is no way this is accurate. Every team starts out with eight international spots and we've only traded for two. So we can only possibly have 10 to use.   Ballouchy received his Green Card in 2013, making him a domestic player.  Velasquez has lived in the US since he was a kid, so I assume he also has a Green Card.  That brings us to 12 International players for 10 spots, and I can't even imagine how to bring us down to compliance. Maybe loans don't count?"
NYCFC,3ddme4,rnoboa,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:46:35 2015 UTC,"As stated below, Poku also has his green card. I get the feeling we may have traded for one more international spot at some point, or someone is leaving imminently."
NYCFC,3ddme4,kingliar9000,5,Wed Jul 15 17:56:37 2015 UTC,"Alvarez is here because he's friends with Villa. Not sure that we'd drop him, unless you want to ""unsettle"" Villa.   edit: If I have to pick between Mena & Mashamaite, I'm going with Mena. He's four years younger, and played in a better league."

NYCFC,3da4bw,perpetual_student,3,Tue Jul 14 23:58:58 2015 UTC,"Head over to maps.google.com and zoom out until you get country names.  While, yes, here in the US it's shown as ""Brazil,"" Brasil is the (proper, not colloquial Brazillian) Portuguese spelling. And while we don't usually use the accents for most Central/South American countries (not that it would be that hard to do), ""Columbia"" is in no way the ""English spelling"" of Colombia.  The word ""Colombia"" isn't in Spanish or any other foreign language and as such doesn't need to be changed.  Columbia is historically an alternate name for the New World (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_(name), and the female personification thereof.

NYCFC,3dbwet,shebrew11,2,Wed Jul 15 01:51:57 2015 UTC,That's because home teams don't usually sell those seats. They're sold by the visiting team.   Check Orlando's website or ask them over in /r/OClions
NYCFC,3dbwet,NYCsoccerfan,2,Wed Jul 15 02:30:05 2015 UTC,Thanks! It's my first MLS away game. Just found tickets through one of the SGs since apparently the stadium wants the away seats all bought in bulk.
NYCFC,3dbwet,BeerAndFuckingPizza,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:23:46 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure it's just an MLS rule as well. I have been to a few different MLS stadiums and all of them seem to give an allotment to the main supporter group of the visiting team. The SG then sells what they can and hands the remaining tickets back over normally about a week before the match.   If away support sells all their tickets before that week, they can request more.   Unless of course you are an NYCFC supporter trying to visit RBA."
NYCFC,3dbwet,kuyakew,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:12:02 2015 UTC,Naw there aren't any issues for away fans besides maybe dumb banter. Don't worry it's cool. Even during the RBNY game there were plenty of RB fans clapping and shouting but no craziness.

NYCFC,3db9lo,TheReelMalik,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:31:11 2015 UTC,"Gotta think outside the box.  We paid Mix down below the DP level - if we can free up some of that ""paid down"" money to pay someone else down, or if we can use the TAM to pay someone down into that slot, it could be worthwhile.  Creative accounting, and all that."

NYCFC,3db9lo,MrMaxson,2,Tue Jul 14 23:48:37 2015 UTC,"True ... but the way allocation money sounds like it works (and no one really seems t know with Garber Bucks), is that you have to spend them. Maybe we have so much allocation money left, especially with TAM, that the FO feels like the best use is to sign another big splash player for a year and a half."
NYCFC,3db9lo,perpetual_student,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:50:44 2015 UTC,but the way allocation money sounds like it works... is that you have to spend them   That's only the Targeted Allocation Money that was just issued with this CBA.

NYCFC,3db9lo,thewelldressedpt,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:33:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly, having Drogba's physical abilities (albeit his form decreased much from his prime) would be key, especially if we offload/loan Nemec.   He is a good target man but his decision making and positioning was not good this past season for the Blues (I am a Chelsea supporter). However, based on the level of the league, I think he can benefit and get a lot of confidence back playing in sky blue."

Since it appears that that's not the case, seems likely we might be getting rid of KWS?   Also, I think it's unlikely Eirik goes on loan. Meara has had injury trouble, so not super clear to me that we want to get rid of our depth in GK for the rest of the season."
NYCFC,3dag2x,hoya14,2,Tue Jul 14 19:33:45 2015 UTC,We need that international spot because Mena needs it. We might need another if the rumors of Tefu being close to a deal are true.
NYCFC,3dag2x,Crown4King,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:38:07 2015 UTC,"Agree, but my point is that we need to get rid of someone because of the 29 players. If we were getting rid of Nemec or Alvarez, say, then we wouldn't need an additional international slot to get Mena. So the acquisition of another international spot implies that we are getting rid of a domestic. If we are also getting tefu, then we need to either acquire another international spot (and get rid of two domestics) or get rid of a domestic and an international."

Shelton actually might be the best fit for that as the games we have seen him play he has been all over the pitch involved with everything"
NYCFC,3d99lp,69thdoctor,8,Tue Jul 14 16:36:29 2015 UTC,I think poku is still the perfect super sub. Shouldn't be starting.

NYCFC,3d99lp,jshaq333,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:41:18 2015 UTC,Although I wouldn't know where to place the players I think 4231 is the way to go. Defensively we suck. Lamps and Pirlo can help out in the midfield with defending and that's a position where they both can play effectively to maximize their strengths. If we bring a forward like drogba then we can place villa on the left where he is most comfortable and the team will start to look more balanced.
NYCFC,3d99lp,KeiserSoze24,0,Fri Jul 17 20:49:51 2015 UTC,"Id like to see a 4-3-3. Angelino, Facey, Hernandez, Iriola. Pirlo (deep lying), Lampard, Mix. Shelton, Villa, Mullins.   Defensively possibly vulnerable but the counter would be deadly. I dont believe that pirlo and lampard will have any difficulty defending in mls."

Games like this here in the UK are normally retired players and / or celebs playing for charity or a testimonial game.  An All Star game is a very confusing idea of a game to be honest. How are Lampard and Gerrard stars of MLS, they've been there less than two months?  There seems to be a lot of hype around players more than the teams."

Fan XI and commissioner's picks are so that the players that will bring attention will be played. The coach then picks players that will actually work well with these players.  Biggest issue I have is, Lampard's signed in for a year and a half. That half year is getting shorter and shorter and shorter and this just takes another game or two away from his contract. Why the fuck are we paying for him?"

I'd rather them have that time not flying across the country to play in a promotional match. 2. We haven't even seen Lampard play a match yet, but we will let them play in the ASG and risk injury for a one time assembled club.  Kind of silly. It's also right in the middle of the season.

I read a lot of the complaints the red bulls guys said and some of the scummier stuff really annoyed me. Like how TTR guys would light flares and smoke bombs then toss them to other supporters and security would think that person lit those and escort them out and the original perpetrator gets off and gloats about it.

NYCFC,3da3wh,spirolateral,4,Tue Jul 14 18:15:39 2015 UTC,"I think some of that is hyperbole, I think the perpetrator's just didn't want to get caught, not like they're trying to get other people thrown out. But yeah I get your point.   It really comes down to leadership,  which I've seen very little of in the third rail. A lot of the problems that were present in the first game are still there. I still hear puto regularly during goal kicks, beers and items being thrown on people and onto the field, mostly emanating from the heart of the third rail.

NYCFC,3d4v4s,UnbiasedOnionRing,2,Mon Jul 13 17:31:43 2015 UTC,Can't you stay in goal until like 40?
NYCFC,3d4v4s,nachomancandycabbage,8,Mon Jul 13 17:48:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, but no one's gonna get a deal when they're already 36 and played most of their career here.  The only way someone stays in goal until 40 is if they have an existing contract with the side that gets extended that far.  Don't get me wrong, Saunders is having a career season, but he's not PL quality."

NYCFC,3d4v4s,theycallmepapi,0,Mon Jul 13 22:06:57 2015 UTC,Definitely over-rated among the general fanbase (remember he only had one save yesterday against TFC and sometimes decides to go after crosses he shouldn't) but he's a solid MLS GK.
NYCFC,3d5i0l,hapoo123,8,Mon Jul 13 18:05:25 2015 UTC,"Brian Toto (I believe he is a former board member) said on Facebook ""[Sanctions] from the league because of us throwing stuff on the field and our insistence on using smoke bombs wherever we go.""

NYCFC,3d5i0l,perpetual_student,18,Mon Jul 13 18:28:06 2015 UTC,"because of us throwing stuff on the field   I really wish people would stop fucking doing that.  Absolutely classless to trash an away park.  Same thing happened at the Cosmos game and it was cringeworthy and frankly, embarrassing."
NYCFC,3d5i0l,dekal630,8,Mon Jul 13 18:39:43 2015 UTC,Extremely classless and degrading. People were showered at Yankee stadium.
NYCFC,3d5i0l,MrMaxson,2,Mon Jul 13 19:12:39 2015 UTC,"Whether that's true or not, it's a recipe for disaster. I went to the last game at RBA and had no incidents in the stands, but once they shepherded us all to the PATH station, that was a different story. Having their fans and our fans in an hour-long line to get home was a bad idea.  That'll be further demonstrated if they have us all sit together (because let's be honest, if people can't get tickets to the supporters section, they'll find another section).  I, for one, won't be returning. I had an unpleasant enough experience that I'll watch this one from the bar."
NYCFC,3d5i0l,dgmz,3,Mon Jul 13 21:35:07 2015 UTC,FWIW my experience of a mixed PATH ride back home was pleasantly civil.
NYCFC,3d5i0l,MrMaxson,2,Tue Jul 14 00:05:03 2015 UTC,Totally believe it. I think that with the sell-out crowd (and the longer PATH lines that accompanied it) and the newer fans on both sides probably brought out the worst.

The post being discussed specifically references STUFF ON THE FIELD and SMOKE BOMBS as the reason.  Neither of which, to my knowledge, happened or are alleged to have happened at the Red Bulls Yankee Stadium game.  If there were no smoke bombs or stuff on the field, then the Red Bulls fans DID NOT engage in the ""same exact behavior"" as the NYCFC fans did at Red Bull Arena.  The Red Bulls fans engaged in different behavior.  It is entirely possible the Red Bulls fans will be punished for this different behavior next time they make the trip to Yankee Stadium."
NYCFC,3d5i0l,Goose511th,-2,Mon Jul 13 21:05:53 2015 UTC,"So sorry for not being specific about that. Let me clarify: The RB fans who attended the NYCFC v RBNY match at Yankee Stadium engaged in a different kind of SCUMMY, THUGGISH, ABSOLUTELY REPREHENSIBLE BEHAVIOR and are TOTALLY DESERVING of a cap because of it. No amount of MINIMIZING that behavior or ARGUING SEMANTICS will change that. (I can capitalize for emphasis, too.)"

NYCFC,3d5i0l,EinWindir,8,Tue Jul 14 17:59:07 2015 UTC,Supporter seats are 20$. If you buy outside the TR/BB/HoO blocks then you are going to be spending around 45$ a seat.  They may have told Toto it's because of smoke but it's not. It's all about money.
NYCFC,3d5i0l,spirolateral,0,Mon Jul 13 19:13:55 2015 UTC,"Where do you buy the supporter seats for $20? On their site it says you can't buy them there. Or maybe they're just sold out at this point.  Edit: I just called the Red Bulls and they said I need a promo code that is sent to the ""supporters"". Does this mean that only ""supporters groups"" are allowed to go to the away section at their stadium? Is it like that at other stadiums as well? Seems weird. I'd like to sit with the rest of us city fans, but I'm not a part of a supporters group and I don't sit in the supporters section at our home matches. Is there any way to get these tickets or am I out of luck?"
NYCFC,3d5i0l,EinWindir,2,Mon Jul 13 20:33:25 2015 UTC,Part of the benefit of joining a Supporter Group is receiving advance tickets at a discounted price.  Supporter Tickets are available (with a code) for 20$ plus a small processing fee which RBA tacks onto the price.

However we most definitely need to punish the Red Bull fans too. Right after their win I saw them chuck beer from their section to the sections below and I saw children get pelted with beer.

NYCFC,3d4tez,Goose511th,3,Mon Jul 13 15:20:37 2015 UTC,"Pirlo and Mix are definite nogo's for the reasons /u/ASY1 mentioned, but I think Lampard is likely. No reason to keep him off the pitch if he can play, even if it's turf. That said, to answer your question about subs, some people think Lampard can't go the full 90 anymore, so you're likely to see Poku (our usual power-sub for the midfield) or Grabavoy (unless Kreis starts him again for some stupid reason) subbed in for him. If it turns out to be Grabavoy, then you may as well start cheering for the Revs.  If it matters to you, Angelino and Iraloa are likely to be there as well."

Besides the obvious names who won't play (Pirlo, Lampard, Mix) youll get a chance to see a few exciting new players like Iraola and Angelino. It will probably be something like this:  Villa  Mullins  McNamera  Ballouchy  Jacobson  Grabavoy (hopefully Poku instead)  Angelino (Exciting young player on loan from Man City)  Facey (Another loanee from city)  Wingert  Iraola (Fullback we signed from Bilbao, high expectations)  Saunders   One person you definitely won't see will be Kwame unless he's in the stands with you."
NYCFC,3d4tez,Crown4King,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:07:06 2015 UTC,"I think we should just freakin play Poku and THEN when he seems winded or lacking for progress putting someone else in. As much as I like Grabz as a human, he isn't cutting it.   I'm honestly curious and somewhat hopefully that MAYBE (don't kill me here) Nemec will eventually again get more play time. Between Pirlo and Lamps, and with the attacking strength of Iraola and Angelino, I think the CLICK that has needed to happen for him could materialize, particularly in regard to his header potential and just sheer muscle."
NYCFC,3d4tez,The-Puppetmaster,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:46:36 2015 UTC,"Trust me I'm all on the Poku train, Grabavoy is just awful I agree. You think Nemec is better than Mullins? Imo Mullins has been great recently, he has been showing some real promise the last two matches."
NYCFC,3d4tez,Crown4King,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:37:36 2015 UTC,"I think he has been doing great, I agree. Which is contrary to what some folks have been saying about him recently that he's a little top scrappy. Guy is good and one of the nicest on the team, too! I met him at the Adidas store and him and TMac we're pretty goofy.   I'm just saying that I think now that we're clicking and we'll have better crossing power that Nemec will be a better player, he was a pretty decently profile signing and I'd like to see him redeem himself, if only for a game or two or as a supersub."

Every so often we'll get into ""We Are 238"" but that's more of a Section song than HoO. We also place emphasis on having a smaller tightly knit group. It's great to be able to have a show-of-force like Third Rail (1,000+ members is quite impressive) but we like the idea of knowing all our members on a personal level."

NYCFC,3d3ft6,BeerAndFuckingPizza,6,Mon Jul 13 07:43:13 2015 UTC,It's not about being against TR. It's because Hey Baby is not a song we like singing. There are plenty of other songs we join in with.
NYCFC,3d3ft6,EinWindir,3,Mon Jul 13 18:05:28 2015 UTC,It is a pretty dumb fucking song.

NYCFC,3d3ft6,SeekersWorkAccount,3,Mon Jul 13 20:01:50 2015 UTC,This shit again?  Are you the guy who posted on twitter about how terrible Hearts of Oak are too? If you want to sing Third Rail songs then sit with Third Rail. 238 (especially front left) is widely known as Hearts of Oak area. If you don't like the way the section is then move along.
NYCFC,3d3ft6,EinWindir,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:02:53 2015 UTC,"I didn't post anything on Twitter. Hey Baby is sort of silly, but your asshole member is getting in girl's faces threatening to fucking kill them if they sing along. Is that what youre known for?"
NYCFC,3d3ft6,EinWindir,2,Mon Jul 13 18:08:14 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna go ahead and say this is a lie. While I don't doubt the person you are referring to said ""we don't sing that song"", I highly doubt he threatend physical violence. So much so that I would further say you are completely ful of shit.  One of the things that points me in this direction: I am a regular member and contributor to this sub and all the other social media formats and my reputation is built on trust. Whereas you are hiding behind anonymity and you can say anything about anyone with absolutely zero impact on your reputation.  The other thing, I know the ""asshole"" personally and while he is passionate he is neither a drunk or someone who threatens violence."
NYCFC,3d3ft6,spirolateral,4,Mon Jul 13 18:46:09 2015 UTC,"drunk and threatening violence or not, the guy has no fucking right to get in someone's face just because they're singing a song. it's a dumb song, as are most of your supporter's songs, but if someone's having fun singing it, they don't need to get yelled at because they happened to be too close to people that ""don't sing that song"". sounds like a real fun atmosphere out there if that's what's going on. the section is not ""yours"". it's all GA and others can be there too. maybe you don't sing it, but other people can. there's no reason to even say ""we don't sing that song"" at all. just don't sing it and shut the fuck up."
NYCFC,3d3ft6,EinWindir,2,Mon Jul 13 21:26:08 2015 UTC,"I said it elsewhere in this thread, anyone is free to sing what they want. Just like anyone is free to express distaste. The easiest thing to do is tell the person ""yelling"" at you to fuck-off."
NYCFC,3d3ft6,spirolateral,2,Mon Jul 13 22:30:36 2015 UTC,Seems like a lot of unnecessary bullshit that could be avoided if the original guy kept his opinion to himself.

None of us, excluding racist shit and violence, have any right to tell other supporters how to support the team."
NYCFC,3d3ft6,EinWindir,2,Mon Jul 13 22:10:04 2015 UTC,"I hear ya but all this guy has to do is say ""fuck off, I'll do what I want"". It's that easy. I wouldn't blame someone for being pissed off about told they can't (or shouldn't) sing something.  With that said, if you are sitting in a section with a heavy HoO presence, don't be surprised if one member conveys a similar distaste to you."
NYCFC,3d3ft6,joshdts,2,Mon Jul 13 22:25:23 2015 UTC,"First part is fair play. But I have to disagree with the second part of what you said. If you don't want to sing it, don't sing it. I agree it's corny as fuck, but why bother yourself with what other people are doing? Just seems a little overkill."
NYCFC,3d3ft6,EinWindir,3,Mon Jul 13 22:40:12 2015 UTC,I'm not disagreeing with you. I don't personally care if people around me are singing it. I just jumped in to try and offer the perspective of where he's coming from.
NYCFC,3d3ft6,HoO482015,0,Mon Jul 13 22:43:36 2015 UTC,"I call bullshit on this guy. The so called ""drunk with the man bun"" is actually a close friend of mine and I was standing right next to him when that happened. If you want to call 2 rows of distance ""in someone's face"" then you sir have a serious problem with your vision and should get your eyes checked immediately. Also, he does not have a man bun so that clearly shows the stupidity and the shit that comes out of your mouth. So the next time you decide to go all Jodie Foster on everyone take a deep breath and realize how ridiculous you sound."

Seeing as you aren't disputing what he actually said:   ""we don't chant that. Who chanted that? I hear it again I'll fucking kill you.""   and instead attacking his description of your friend's hairstyle, perhaps you should reevaluate your loyalty to someone who makes death threats on a whim (and I don't care if he ""didn't actually mean it"" or whatever, shit like that is uncalled for).  Every fan is there for a good time and to support the team, and going out of your way to ruin that for someone else makes your worse than a NJRB fan in my book."

The words ""I'll fucking kill you"" didn't come out of his mouth. Well he's attacking something that isn't true. I know where my loyalty lies so I don't who the fuck you think you are trying to tell me where I should put it. If you weren't in 238 you can just take a step back and fuck your own face along with your input. Have a nice night and get in the fucking sea"

NYCFC,3d1uvm,dekal630,2,Sun Jul 12 22:22:38 2015 UTC,Can you imagine trying to defend against his movement off the ball?

From what we saw today, I think him, Calle and Wingert will compete for starting LB (dependent on if we sign a new CB or if Hernandez gets healthy). If we are stuck with the same injury report, I hope he continues to start."

NYCFC,3d1uvm,mockio77,4,Sun Jul 12 22:34:20 2015 UTC,I thought Iraola did a great job for his first match. Hopefully with the additional incoming European talent it can all come to full flourish.
NYCFC,3d1uvm,RJotor,4,Sun Jul 12 21:19:30 2015 UTC,He was gassed by the end though. That's where burning a sub on KWS really hurt.
NYCFC,3d1uvm,samugolinifirenze,6,Sun Jul 12 21:27:55 2015 UTC,"That's very true, but I would say that that says more about how we should deal with KWS rather than Iraola. We need a strong CB (hopefully Tefu) who can last a full 90 not simply because he is fit, but because he has the skill to make it worth our while."
NYCFC,3d1uvm,fdar,5,Sun Jul 12 21:31:48 2015 UTC,"KWS just isn't cut out for this level of play. No speed, poor ball handling, and god awful tackles/challenges leading to penalties. I have no idea why he keeps getting started. Hopefully things with Tefu work out."

If it weren't for him we would have won 4-1."
NYCFC,3d1uvm,ichigo1234,2,Sun Jul 12 23:39:17 2015 UTC,Its the worst CB performance I can remember since the poor lad from Betis who asked to have himself subbed off. It was atrocious

Iraola was solid throughout the match other than the yellow (which was silly)  Definitely better long balls from the wing backs, just need to solidify the center of the backline. Tefu might be part of this.   I'm shocked that Nemec will outlast KWS on the roster, but it looks likely at this point now that we have wingbcacks who can accurately cross the ball.   1 pt > 0, onward to the next match boys!"

Thought our supporters in the bleachers died out from the beginning of the 2nd to the 60'.   Obviously Kwame was a let down. Iraola was good, but not great. Got burned a couple times and looked like he was expecting his CB to cover for him a few times (when it's Kwame you can't really expect that to happen). Csn easily see how good hell be for us though. Ball skills are incredible, and he played a nasty ball up from midfield 2-3 times which should create some offense for us.  Villa clearly showed why he's our best player. Also love how this Toronto rivalry is shaping up - it's clear these teams don't like each other at all."

NYCFC,3d1uvm,BeatsByTre,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:06:50 2015 UTC,"I like Iraola - but I don't LOVE him yet.  I've seen a lot of people praising him highly, but I felt like he was a bit underwhelming.  I realize it's his first game and he needs time to click, but that terrible pass to give away the fourth goal, on top of some shoddy ball handling makes me hope that he improves his game a bit.    I think he may have been caught off-guard with how terrible our KW was - Iraola seems keen on pushing the ball up the field and attacking, but this leaves us with no backup and essentially a huge void."

NYCFC,3d1uvm,mockio77,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:35:52 2015 UTC,Makes me sad to see how far Kwame has fallen. I was so excited when i heard he was playing for NYCFC. I watched him play in college when he was captain of the UConn Huskies. He was definitely a fan favorite. However as much as I love him for what he did for my alma mater... he cant play in the mls right now...
NYCFC,3d1uvm,AndrewWyllie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:47:48 2015 UTC,Is it really Kwame last match or are we just being rude and salty whether or not it has basis from his performance?
NYCFC,3d1uvm,jakebecknation,8,Sun Jul 12 21:10:31 2015 UTC,Rude and salty? How about realistic?  It's not like he's a decent player who had a bad game. He's unbelievably terrible.

NYCFC,3d2ou1,AAAristarchus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:27:22 2015 UTC,Anyone got a good formation? NYCs default sucks for me and I struggle having villa as a lone striker sadly
NYCFC,3d4sf6,agoradsuxxx,19,Mon Jul 13 14:59:38 2015 UTC,"To be fair. Angelino was listed as out. Clearly Kreis wasn't expecting much from him this game or only thought he could play a few minutes.   KWS is dumpster fire bad but NO ONE expected that performance from him. Give Kreis credit for making the change at the half even with Angelino not 100%.   Saunders said it himself last night, with new players coming in you need to work on timing. We're 3 points out from 3rd place and only have 1 DP until now.   I'm not bringing out my pitchfork because he saw there was a problem and addressed it. He's playing Poku more and isn't afraid to throw people in if he thinks they're ready.   If you want to blame someone, blame the training staff. How is everyone constantly hurt!?"
NYCFC,3d4sf6,NYCsoccerfan,9,Mon Jul 13 15:08:32 2015 UTC,"You hit the nail on the head here.  Have to give him credit for the halftime change.  Although I'll never understand his love affair with Grabavoy.  Tommy Mac was playing well yesterday, creating chances.  And yet he subs him off and leaves Ned on, who was a ghost."
NYCFC,3d4sf6,ToTheBattery,2,Mon Jul 13 16:36:16 2015 UTC,"Its probably a fair point about the training staff.  I always wonder how the support personal behind the scenes are doing, and I guess injuries are the way to judge it.  Poku is a good presence, I always like when he comes on, though the last few games he is suffering from a bit of pass inaccuracy I think.    Getting Mix back, along with Lamps maybe will make getting through the midfield to our back third harder?  They definitely need to find the right mix of CB and LB to break up plays by explosive players like Giovinco and Findley."
NYCFC,3d4sf6,nachomancandycabbage,2,Mon Jul 13 16:41:51 2015 UTC,"Lots of good point man. At the end of the day, we are 3 pts from 3rd."
NYCFC,3d4sf6,NYCFCPodcast,11,Mon Jul 13 18:03:16 2015 UTC,"Let's not be too knee-jerky here.  Yes, Angelino was clearly an aid to the backline, but two things:   Angelino was reported to have picked up a knock in practice earlier in the week - the fact that he was even available on the bench was a surprise to everyone. Chris Wingert isn't a CB either.  Lest we forget, we went on an 11-match winless streak with Wingert at CB.  It was really only after Facey moved back to the center and Wingert went out left that we started winning again.   So with that knowledge, and a complete lack of depth at CB (KWS is really our only depth at CB at the moment), Kreis was really in a corner.  Would Wingert have been a better option at CB than Kwame? Maybe, but he probably didn't want to play Angelino if he didn't have to.  What other options did we have at LB for depth, then?  RJ Allen doesn't play on the left and Jeb is (i think) still out on paternity leave.  It was a shit sandwich all around, but I can't blame Kreis for making the best of a bad situation."
NYCFC,3d4sf6,perpetual_student,7,Mon Jul 13 15:23:29 2015 UTC,"Wingert struggled much of the season when slotted in at CB and has been featured at LB lately, where he seems much more comfortable. The lack of availability of Calle and Hernandez really limited Kreis' options.  Brovsky was shockingly bad against NJRB 2 matches ago, and Watson-Siriboe was coming off a better showing against the Impact on 7/4. The process of starting Kwame is understandable. The step up in quality from the Impact's attack to having to handle Giovinco was way too much for him.  Angelino starting right off the bat is an easier case to make in hindsight than it was going into the match when he'd a) only had what, 3 training sessions? and b) picked up a slight knock in one of them."
NYCFC,3d4sf6,AKLNYC,2,Mon Jul 13 15:17:05 2015 UTC,"Did he say that he was happy with the draw?  KWS fell asleep, probably literally a couple of times.  Kreis did sub him out so there is that.  I agree about Angelino, but he hadn't played for us thus far.  So isn't it fair to say that Kreis was unaware that Angelino could have stopped the bleeding earlier?  I could blame Kreis for not subbing out KWS earlier I guess, but the hat trick happened so damn fast."
NYCFC,3d4sf6,nachomancandycabbage,0,Mon Jul 13 15:06:12 2015 UTC,Well it was abundantly clear that our backline is a joke. How a Man City prospect won't be an improvement over what we got seems to escape me.

NYCFC,3d4sf6,ChrisBerman,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:57:06 2015 UTC,"Saunders, Ballouchy, and Seba were all RSL players and I'm okay with how they have been utilized.

NYCFC,3d4sf6,SkySurf3r,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:28:00 2015 UTC,"yeah KWS, Grabavoy, and Wingert were the main ones I was talking about, didn't realize Saunders and Ballouchy also had time at RSL."
NYCFC,3d2yuw,Dryerfish,5,Mon Jul 13 02:46:19 2015 UTC,"I think it's fair to say our expectations should be to make playoffs. Personally I'm content if that means 6th place. Realistically, I think we finish 4th or 5th, but were only 5 points from 5th and reinforcements coming. We'll benefit from Andrea Pirlo and Frank Lampard starting. We also have some trialist CB who is apparently pretty good. I think right now Villa is by far the most talented. He is also working really hard for us. I think when Pirlo comes it will be a competition between the two. Ultimately, I think we'll see Villa still being the best because of his ability to create chances and hustle. YES network if you get it, MLS live, or the MLS subreddit always have streams available for free. We're expansion so we have a bunch of expansion problems and a supporters culture which is still in jts infancy. But I love what we have going. It feels like a NYC team to me and I love our squad, coach, and  fans."
NYCFC,3d2yuw,dekal630,3,Mon Jul 13 03:01:20 2015 UTC,"Depends on who you ask. A more measured response would be that there are no expectations. The MLS is mature enough as a league that no one would expect them to win the league first year despite some of the talented pieces they've accumulated. For the more reasonable among us, I think we'd all be happy if they made the playoffs, but I don't think anyone would be expecting it. I think it's a decent split between Villa and Saunders. Without either of them, the teams fortunes would be a lot more dire. I think the best option would be to stream. If you hit r/MLS during a game, you should be able to find a streaming option online. If you get lucky, a game will get televised either on ESPN or Fox Sports. Not really sure how much you do know. But you're always welcome to check out previous Free Talk Friday threads or participate in this week's if anything else does strike you."
NYCFC,3d2yuw,Drazzel,2,Mon Jul 13 03:05:38 2015 UTC,"I think originally they had wanted the team to get to the ""playoffs"", I'm not sure if the higher ups have reevaluated  there stance since then.  I'd be fine with finishing as high up as we can, and pressing on for even better -next year when the team is actually more gelled (though i'd love to finish above the NJ RedBulls, and TFC).   Probably Villa, though our other DPs will definitely be up there hopefully.  But non-DP players Saunders has saved us a lot of blushes, I like Facey and Mix too.  Lotsa options, steams like you can find on here, MLS live, ESPN sometimes, Yes Network, sometimes Fox Sports, maybe you have a soccer bar in the area that might be showing them too, just gotta get out there and see what works best.  This is our first year and we all need some patience in just about all departments, be it the team itself, our owners, the couching staff, and our tenuous stay in Yankee Stadium.  But we've got some pretty great fans trying to do something good from what I can tell and lets see where this takes us."

YES Network is on different packages, ESPN and Fox Sports have national coverage, MLS has a streaming service.   4) Is there anything else in general I should know about the team?    Stadium saga will be around for a while, might as well start popping some corn now."
NYCFC,3d2yuw,carpy22,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:23:33 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the club! It's been a season of ups and downs so far. After we got two favorable results to start the season, we went into a nosedive for the next two months or so. For the last month and a half however, our squad has gelled and we've been one of the hottest teams in MLS since. Here are my best answers to your questions:  1) Because we're an expansion team, I don't think many columnists nor fans expected NYCFC to come storming out of the gate (which we did not). Personally, I expected a poor season despite the big names and large pockets of the ownership. However, of late NYCFC has been getting positive results and is in the thick of the playoff hunt. For me, just making the playoffs would be a major accomplishment in our first year. I can't speak for others, but that's my feeling.   2) Our best player by far has been David Villa. He was the lead striker for the World Cup winning Spanish squad in 2010. He's world class and has been a consummate professional since joining our club. It's possible that will change once Lampard and Andrea Pirlo join the squad, but it's doubtful b/c high profile transfers tend to take a few months to acclimate to MLS before they take off.   Outside of the big three however, the biggest name is Mix who's a member of the USMNT. He's had an up and down year so far however and hasn't reached his potential yet.   Though it's not a sexy pick, our goalkeeper, Josh Saunders, has been our MVP so far. The dude has saved at least 4 or 5 games for us this season. For the entire season our defense has been poor (to put it very mildly) but Saunders has bailed them out time and time again. With the recent additions of Iraola and Angelino to the backline, and rumors of Tefu Mashamaite, hopefully pressure will be taken off of him. For the record, Chris Wingert and Shay Facey (who like Angelino is on loan from Man City) have been the two best defenders.  Players to keep an eye out for: Kwadwo Poku and Khiry Shelton. Poku, an attacking midfielder has shown flashes of brilliance with his finishes, while Shelton, our first round pick, is a big strong striker who needs to hone his finishing skills before he plays alongside David Villa.   3) I'm sure MLS.com has a pay per view subscription service.   4) I'm not sure if you're aware, but NYCFC is owned by City Football Group, which also own Manchester City FC and an Australian team as well. That has created a couple of complex and sticky situations, most notably the Frank Lampard contract fiasco (feel free to look it up). It has also brewed fears that NYCFC will be used as a feeder team to the ""parent club"" Man City, and not a premier franchise like we hope. We like to believe that they'll treat NYCFC the same as Man City, but MLS is certainly not on par with the Premier League, in terms of quality and revenue, and sports is a business too, so you never know.   Yankee Stadium is far from an ideal soccer field. It is the least wide of any MLS field by far and makes us vulnerable to throw-ins down by our goal which can turn into corner kick-like goals. Unfortunately it's going to be our home for the next 5+ years because there is ZERO movement on a new soccer-specific stadium.   With the new additions of Lampard and Pirlo, along with Mix and other effective midfielders (like Tommy McNamara, Poku, Andrew Jacobson and others), our midfield is going to be very crowded and there are concerns that our coach, Jason Kreis, will struggle to find a way to fit all the players into effective roles.   In addition to those tidbits, I'd say the most important thing to look out for in the coming weeks is whether our defensive line improves. Without it, it will be tough to make the playoffs, much less advance.   Those are my observations and I hope you find them useful. I'm sure there are plenty of other fans who are more attuned to the nuances of soccer and NYCFC that can help you out as well. Best of luck, fellow fan.   Also, our biggest rival is New York Red Bulls. If you really want to insult them, refer to them as the New Jersey Red Bulls as they play about 45 minutes outside of New York City, in Harrison, New Jersey.    @archNEMECsis"

NYCFC,3d238t,MattWatchesChalk,26,Sun Jul 12 22:15:09 2015 UTC,"Patrick Mullins, the main battle was between Villa and Giovinco but Mullins bailed us out twice and showed to me he should stay as a starter for good."
NYCFC,3d238t,spacejamisraw,4,Sun Jul 12 22:24:26 2015 UTC,"What I like about Mullins is that he gambled twice in the TFC box and scored twice. First for the Villa missed penalty and then for the equalising header. Not saying he could have been injured badly, but you don't win anything if you don't enter the raffle (old football/soccer saying, I know). Overall, a very solid game from Mullins. I'm a fan of Nemec and his holdup play, but Mullins just offers so much more overall."

NYCFC,3d2lfk,stone_cold_bubs,2,Mon Jul 13 00:48:01 2015 UTC,Does anyone know why he is number 69? Is there a reason outside the obvious one? (just curious)
NYCFC,3d2lfk,jshaq333,12,Mon Jul 13 01:53:54 2015 UTC,He's an 18 year old playing professional sports and already has a sleeve tattoo.   Safe to say he's the life at parties.   WINE EM' DINE EM' 69 EM'
NYCFC,3d2lfk,NYCsoccerfan,4,Mon Jul 13 02:37:16 2015 UTC,"Reserve players in England usually have numbers in the 60s and 70s. I don't know for sure, but I imagine his number with City was 69 so he just stuck with it at NYC.  Edit: Yep, confirmed: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C._Reserves_and_Academy"

NYCFC,3d2lfk,febentsev,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:30:35 2015 UTC,"I don't know if they have his jersey yet, but this seller has top quality jerseys. My Mix black jersey is perfect. Unlike some other ones I've gotten there recently. You pay like $5 more than some, but the jersey is exactly like the ones you'd get ordering from the team.   Check out this recommended store on AliExpress. Find great products at low prices! http://www.aliexpress.com/store/330006 (from AliExpress Android)  edit: looks like you can order custom name and number, so there you go. I highly recommended."
NYCFC,3d2lfk,spirolateral,3,Mon Jul 13 01:31:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if you didn't notice or the away kit is different, but  the pictures in the listing don't even have official namesets... I'd look for another seller tbh."
NYCFC,3d2lfk,lazyflowingriver,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:33:18 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you mean, but they look the same to me on the NYCFC shop. Can you show me an example? The one I bought from that seller looks the same as everywhere I've seen official ones."
NYCFC,3d2lfk,spirolateral,4,Mon Jul 13 03:50:37 2015 UTC,"Seller's nameset vs. Authentic nameset  The holes in the numbers and the MLS logo at the bottom are all supposed to be cutouts that show the shirt underneath, but the seller's has white in the holes and a different color blue for the MLS logo. The font and spacing for the name isn't quite right either."
NYCFC,3d2lfk,lazyflowingriver,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:50:30 2015 UTC,"One of my other replies shows the comparison. It just looks like the numbers are a little different to me. Uses the same numbers as the blue jersey, just a different color. Name font looks the same to me. But anyway, it's close enough for saving $60-70"
NYCFC,3d2lfk,spirolateral,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:03:40 2015 UTC,"I hear what you're saying, believe me, I buy Ali jerseys too. The away kit numbers are definitely closer than the home kit numbers. But I'm pretty sure I've come across other sellers who have better looking home kit numbers too, so if OP wants a home kit, that's all I'm sayin."

NYCFC,3d2lfk,spirolateral,0,Mon Jul 13 06:59:19 2015 UTC,"Yep. Some of the quality can be not so good, but there are ones that are really good. For our NYCFC jerseys, stick to this seller as it's the only one I can vouch for. Others might be good too though. I ordered from one other that was not good. So I'll stick to this one.   But YES. That's the real prices. It's great. I order a lot of hockey jerseys from here too."
NYCFC,3d2lfk,iPoobee,3,Mon Jul 13 07:46:14 2015 UTC,Theyre legit but theyre not real
NYCFC,3d2lfk,spirolateral,-1,Mon Jul 13 11:43:49 2015 UTC,"What makes it real though? If it looks exactly the same, or close enough, it's not also real?"
NYCFC,3d2lfk,iPoobee,2,Mon Jul 13 13:01:08 2015 UTC,"It's real if it's bought from the club. If you buy it in the official shop, legit sport shops, or from online shops that have the real thing then it's a real, official shirt.   Aliexpress doesn't sell official, real products. Theyre way cheaper because they're knock offs/fakes. The club doesn't get any revenue from buying knock offs"
NYCFC,3d2lfk,spirolateral,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:13:33 2015 UTC,"Oh, so paying a ridiculous markup makes it real. I get it. Getting from aliexpress, one that looks exactly alike, or close enough that it doesn't matter, is ""real"" enough for me. These things don't cost $100 to make. Even if they charged half that they'd be ripping us off. Mine is real enough to wear and that's real enough for me."
NYCFC,3d2lfk,iPoobee,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:19:39 2015 UTC,"Yes.  If it's real enough for you that's fine. I'm just stating a fact. I agree, I'd rather spend less money on an authentic looking fake shirt than spend over $100 for an official one, but fortunately I buy my real shirts for about £30. It's a shame the club chose to sell them for so much, but I'm not aware of shirt sales in other shops in the US so I don't know if they're cheaper in other places."
NYCFC,3d2lfk,DrKnackig,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:40:16 2015 UTC,"Regarding the custom names thing, there's no option after adding the jersey to the cart to customize the name at all, do they just contact you later or what?"

I'm not saying do it, but if it comes down to it, you can conceal it as they really aren't that thorough when they check bags.

NYCFC,3cz4zt,_sicnarf,3,Sun Jul 12 03:02:51 2015 UTC,No laptops allowed - you can get a locker by Stan's for $10. You lock it and keep the key. They have signs by stans for the place.
NYCFC,3cz4zt,kilsey,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:47:39 2015 UTC,"Per the Yankee Stadium Entry and Carry-In Policy, they will probably not let you in with a laptop and the backpack may be an issue depending on its size.   My wife got stopped once during the 2009 WS for having a small purse which had ""backpack straps"", which were apparently illegal. Placing the ""backpack"" in a plastic bag (straps and all) was enough to get past security. It looks like they no longer prohibit backpacks but they reserve the right randomly change the rules at their discretion, just like the Securitas staff inside hassling us.  There used to be lockers at a bowling alley or something - I believe there are still some options like that nearby."

I think it would be a nightmare if this whole game was marketed around Frank (like it was) and then Jason just decided not to play him. Or if the team knew he was hurt, and didn't tell anyone, and kept marketing it as if he was playing. At least when the injury happened, you could see the team tone back the marketing centered on him."

He had a pass completion rate of 89% in Serie A and is still capable of amazing free kicks. He is the creative outlet we've been missing, Grabavoy is less creative than Apple since Steve Jobs..."
NYCFC,3csp6d,The-Puppetmaster,5,Fri Jul 10 13:46:51 2015 UTC,"Aside from the original outcry before we haven't really heard much of that since, at least as much as we did with Lampard.  Like /u/BeatsByTre said in the podcast if he happens to get hurt you'll hear it immediately.   He should be fine, we have plenty of fast and younger guys around. Kreis said himself he will make other players around him better and if they have to work harder that will make them even better in the long run."
NYCFC,3csp6d,NYCsoccerfan,7,Fri Jul 10 13:58:41 2015 UTC,"If Pirlo was good enough to start and play 90 minutes in the Champions League this season, good enough be such a huge part of Juventus' success this season, and good enough that Juventus wanted him to stay, he will be more than amazing. No one gives OCSC shit for Kaka? That's haters just hating. Pirlo can run, he's a professional and he's still got a couple of years in him. He's one of the best midfielders of our time and is magician of playmaking. He will not only provide the service that Villa needs, but he will make the team play better overall. You see the fluidity that Kaka gives OCSC, that will happen here and then some."
NYCFC,3csp6d,dekal630,5,Fri Jul 10 14:10:38 2015 UTC,What's hilarious is that most of these comments come from fans of teams that don't have these DPs they're saying we should be getting.   Shows that this team because of the connection to MCFC and the fact that we play in NYC is under intense scrutiny.
NYCFC,3csp6d,NYCsoccerfan,3,Fri Jul 10 14:19:29 2015 UTC,"I agree! The only team that really has a better DP situation is TFC because they have young DPs that have a lot of potential.  I think the whole MCFC connection gives people fuel to pick on us, but I think it's more of a envious hate? MCFC is really helping us out a lot with youth and with big names."
NYCFC,3csp6d,dekal630,4,Fri Jul 10 14:28:44 2015 UTC,The mentoring Lampard and Pirlo can do for our young guys cannot be overstated. Their impact on the team will last far longer than their time on the pitch.

NYCFC,3csp6d,BeatsByTre,3,Fri Jul 10 16:31:50 2015 UTC,"I understand Grabavoy is Kreis's boy from RSL, but shit he kills us out there."
NYCFC,3csp6d,Donkey_Puncha_Rello,3,Fri Jul 10 16:08:14 2015 UTC,I don't understand why he plays.
NYCFC,3csp6d,dekal630,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:39:02 2015 UTC,We used a franchise draft pick on him and he seems like he probably has the right locker room attitude which probably got him on Kreis's good side (he's our captain when Villa isn't playing). Doesn't mean that translates to the pitch though. Give him some pompoms and a seat on the end of the bench.
NYCFC,3csp6d,Donkey_Puncha_Rello,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:11:21 2015 UTC,"I've been saying this since the season started:  Tommy McNamara is the same player, but younger and better."
NYCFC,3csp6d,dekal630,2,Fri Jul 10 19:40:35 2015 UTC,"Any predictions on debuts this weekend? I'm thinking Lampard and Andoni both start. I think Andoni will be a huge upgrade from Allen on that RB spot. I think he'll have no problem playing the whole game. I'm wondering whether Kreis will start Lampard and then sub him off later on or if he'll be a sub later on. Like I posted earlier about Pirlo, I think Lampard will have no problem running and with fitness."
NYCFC,3csp6d,jredbone,8,Fri Jul 10 14:13:57 2015 UTC,I think Iraola goes the full 90'.  I think Lamps scores in his debut and comes off at ~60' for some applause.

NYCFC,3csp6d,derek_villa,3,Fri Jul 10 14:30:57 2015 UTC,"I'm so excited. I think Iraola slots right in, Angelino might also start since he and Facey know each other.   Lampard will likely start. He knows he has a lot to prove."
NYCFC,3csp6d,dekal630,3,Fri Jul 10 14:20:45 2015 UTC,"Facey didnt start right away.   Angelino is going to get his shot because of our lack of pace at almost every position, but let the kid come off the bench a couple games.  It takes the pressure off of him and he makes him have to earn the starting spot.  Don't want to have to deal with soggy veterans (even though they suck) in the clubhouse."
NYCFC,3csp6d,NYCsoccerfan,3,Fri Jul 10 15:01:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure Angelino won't start.  I agree it would be weird for the kid to get in in his first game eligible over Wingert, but Kreis might just pull a ""let's see what you've got, kid"" with him.    I also feel like Kreis was reluctant to start Facey in the beginning because he didn't want him ingrained as a starter only to lose him at the original end of his loan on June 30 (hence the whole Wingert-as-CB debacle).  Now that he knows he'll have Facey for the remainder of the year, there's no question that he's the starter. I think a similar logic will apply to Angelino.  He may not start this match (though I think it would be a good one for him to start - at home against a depleted TFC), but look for him to get some minutes very soon."
NYCFC,3csp6d,NYCsoccerfan,2,Fri Jul 10 15:12:40 2015 UTC,I can't wait! You going to be there Sunday?   Did Angelino and Facey both play together at MCFC?
NYCFC,3csp6d,derek_villa,3,Fri Jul 10 14:29:42 2015 UTC,Season tickets. There every game.   Facey and Angelino played together multiple times for the EDS. (MCFC's development squad)

Pirlo and Lampard's NYCFC cards came out the last couple of days and I am debating where to put them on my squad.  Tough to have a pure MLS squad because of the lack of defenders but I was thinking of a hybrid with a German Defense would work well with Klinsmann as coach since you get the MLS/German chem boost.  MLS doesn't really have any good LM/LW/RM/RW and has a glut of ST/CF/CMs so you are kind of stuck use the 4-1-2-1-2 (2), 4-2-3-1, 4-3-1-2, or 4-2-2-2.  I don't think a 4-2-2-2 fits lampard very well with his pace so   4-1-2-1-2 or 4-3-1-2      Villa  Dempsey       Lampard     Pirlo Giovinco       Gerrard  4-2-3-1                  Villa Dempsey Lampard Giovinco            Gerrard Pirlo  I think you could also make a case for Donovan in both lineups for more Pace."

Toronto currently sits in fifth of the Eastern Conference, four points ahead, while having played two less games than NYCFC.    They're only 3 points ahead.  I'm also not sure if just Lampard is boosting sales. It's a combination of a lot of things, but Lampard certainly is a factor. I'm really excited to see how many viewers we can get to tune in for Lampard's debut, but it's also at a bad time for people to watch a game indoors on a beautiful weekend like this one."

I meet Packer fans everywhere. Some of them are born and bred Wisconsinites. Some of them just rooted for Brett Favre in the 90s and never stopped. Some of them have ever even been to Wisconsin.  My point is, if you root for the team I root for, I don't care what your story is as long as your loyal and passionate about the team. The only people who are going to call you plastic or a bandwagon fan are bitter fans of other teams."
NYCFC,3cnq6j,BlackSails666,-7,Thu Jul 9 12:15:37 2015 UTC,can confirm that this is true. I am huge huge bitter supporter of RBNY and I came here to say he's just another one of those annoying fans caught up in Hype.
NYCFC,3cnq6j,davebozo,5,Thu Jul 9 15:56:46 2015 UTC,"I'm from Connecticut, so this is actually one of my teams that is geographically relevant for me, but for various reasons over the years I've come to love the Cincinnati Bengals, Atlanta Braves, and AS Monaco FC, despite having never been near those locations before becoming fans of the teams.  I've been to ATL since, but still.    Welcome.  I also think looking at the long-term future of the MLS, the NYCFC train is a good train to be on.  Might as well catch it right as it's leaving station. :)"
NYCFC,3cnq6j,uchuskies08,3,Thu Jul 9 13:52:06 2015 UTC,"A lot of people will say support your local team (Orlando). But if you're drawn to NYC and you're supporting the league then whatever it doesn't matter. You should try to go see them away though.  Friday 10/16, in Orlando."
NYCFC,3cnq6j,beaucoup_movement,4,Thu Jul 9 13:29:06 2015 UTC,"Just because Orlando and NYCFC are expansion rivals doesn't mean it would be weird for you to support NYCFC and also Orlando. People get shit for rooting for two teams in the same league but honestly who cares?!  People root for teams across the pond that they have never seen live and have never been anywhere near but they still are die hard. You can even make it to a match to watch NYCFC vs Orlando and sit with the traveling support.   Also, confession time, when the Timbers visited NY this season I stood with the Army. I'm an NYCFC season ticket holder and I feel pretty die hard about this team but I lived in Portland for three years and the timbers are my first MLS love. I got to hang out with all the timbers army folks and had a great day and am even going down to their game in Philly this weekend and driving back up 95 for NYCFC vs Toronto the following day.   Point being, if you have a reason to support a team, don't let people tell you it's wrong. If you like a team a lot then you should support them and it's as simple as that."

NYCFC,3cnq6j,Yvaithe,3,Thu Jul 9 13:20:55 2015 UTC,"A major part of supporting football is the social aspect - being with likeminded people, participating and supporting the team live, etc.  I understand being drawn to one thing, but there is a reason people support their local team.  It's ultimately more rewarding because you build more of a connection.  I'm not saying you're wrong for being interested in NYCFC, but my gut says you'd be happier and more fulfilled with a team you can connect with, i.e. your local team."
NYCFC,3cnq6j,ToTheBattery,2,Thu Jul 9 16:23:27 2015 UTC,"As NYCFC continues to grow and add talent they are going to pick up fans  across the country and the world. How many Juve/Italy fans is Pirlo going to draw to the team, same with Lampard and Chelsea fans. I'm sure some will loose interest once those guys leave but I bet most will stay with the team. I have not met a single NYCFC fan that wouldn't welcome you regardless of where you live. If you're still on the fence get some tickets to the Oct. 16th game in the NYCFC supporters section, meet some fellow NYCFC fans, I'm sure you will be hooked."

Geographically, I was only two hours away from Toronto but I could never find myself supporting them. Now I live even further away from NYC but still am the biggest fan. I've only been to NYC a handful of times but the feel of the club and the fact that they represent NYC made me a fan from the start. Go with what you feel and check r/soccerstreams to watch the games :D  TL;DR: support what feels right. Doesn't matter where you are."

NYCFC,3cnq6j,kproxurworld,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:16:35 2015 UTC,"Your football club chooses you. It's weird. I loved the Red Bulls for a long while, but when I saw NYCFC play for the first time, I jumped ship as fast as I could. The club and the play speaks to me."
NYCFC,3cnq6j,s1ark5,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:55:20 2015 UTC,"Moist, your sports teams choose you, it happens natural, it doesn't matter where you are from.  Sure you will find many many many fans of NYCFC living within the 5 boroughs and the trip state area but NYCFC is actually one of the most popular teams not only in MLS, in the US, but also overseas.  The situation with me is kinda similar.  I live in Tampa, FL and I haven't been in NYC for over 7 years but as a kid I grew up in BK and then SI.  I was a HUGE metrostars/redbulls fan growing up but when NYCFC was announced and when NYCFC played their first exhibition game was St. Mirrien in the UK, I was hooked!  It happened naturally.  I really didn't expect to like NYCFC, and that is true, I don't like the team, I LOVE this team!!!!  I love the crest, I love the colors for the most part, especially the black jerseys, and I love the players, I just love it man can't explain it.  And yes you can certainly identify with a team you have never been.  There are many premier league teams that have fans in the US that have never been to London or Norwich, or fans that have never been to Madrid or Barcelona but still are die hard fans of those teams.    Also, living here in Tampa, FL for over 7 years, you would expect that I could at least for the Tampa sports teams since I really do like Tampa as the city and I like living here, but NO.  I hate everyone of their sports teams for some reason.  Can't bring myself to root for them not even a little bit.  So embrace it homie, enjoy the ride and excitement because I can assure NYCFC will be one of the top teams in this region in the not so distant future.  =)"

I live really close to Mix's mom and her family and have met them a couple times so when I heard he was coming to the MLS to a new team with David Villa I was on board. I also go to school in Boston (sorry Revs) but took a bus up to NYC and got to use someone's season ticket to stand with a bunch of third rail people during the home game against Sporting KC so now I love watching games on tv and recognizing people in the supporters section. So yeah doesn't matter where you live if you like a team like them and be happy with your choice!
NYCFC,3cnq6j,JohnnyCashFan69,-9,Sun Jul 12 06:54:28 2015 UTC,"Dude. Again. This team hasn't even completed ONE season yet. You guys expect way too much for a team that hasn't even completed a whole season. You need to give this time. Do whatever you want but as far as expectation for NYCFC, again.....not one season has passed."
NYCFC,3cnq6j,franch,6,Thu Jul 9 14:09:10 2015 UTC,"He said nothing about expectations?   All he said was that he's from an area that traditionally supports Orlando City so he feels it's his local team, but he feels a greater draw towards NYCFC and he wants to know what to do.  What does any of that have to do with expectations?"
NYCFC,3cnq6j,JohnnyCashFan69,2,Thu Jul 9 15:33:05 2015 UTC,"this is probably one of his nycfc flaired ""fuck nycfc"" posts that he recycles from time to time. he didn't notice that he posted on a completely irrelevant post."

NYCFC,3cnq6j,JohnnyCashFan69,-5,Fri Jul 10 03:30:18 2015 UTC,My point is you shouldn't have an existential crisis regarding a team that isn't a season old. I live in NY and I cheer for the Pittsburgh Steelers because of their rich history. I don't understand the point of this post. If you like a team support them if not don't?
NYCFC,3cnq6j,ChvyVele,3,Thu Jul 9 15:55:45 2015 UTC,"I'd hardly call it an existential crisis, we're not questioning his existence.

It doesn't hurt anyone for him to ask, and we're all nice people here, we like helping other fans with whatever they ask for help with.  2) If the question doesn't interest you, or you find it weird, don't comment on it, don't even click it.

Starikov is interesting I found him by accident when playing Football Manager in that game he is more of an attacking mid than striker, he also went to Bradenton Academy and has been with Zenit for awhile. He probably would be a decent pickup for an MLS team as a bench forward, fringe starter.   Cuenca is a guy who would probably be a DP no matter where he would go"
NYCFC,3ckxe6,Jack2142,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:19:27 2015 UTC,in my FM12 save he got insanely good and signed for a big team and almost won the WC for the USA. He's not good enough for my team so I just have him on my shortlist to creep on his progress.
NYCFC,3ckxe6,bkstr,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:45:48 2015 UTC,Thanks for the insight. I don't really know much about the Russian league. I wouldn't mind a younger bench option which we could hopefully grow over time.   As for Cuenca I haven't found a reliable source for his salary so I can't say anything there. He's young and has gotten interest from Italy and Portugal but I doubt he's a guaranteed starter in Europe whereas he could start for us now.   Good way for him to kickstart his career.
NYCFC,3ckxe6,Jack2142,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:31:26 2015 UTC,"I think Cuenca would probably command a decent salary due to age, and the fact he was a starter at a low end La Liga team would be a couple million or so (think Obafemi Martins sized contract). Essentially he would be a risk ,but if it pays off any team that got him would likely have their RW set for years."

He just went to Fenerbache for a nominal amount. Could've been our Giovinco instead of adding to the crowd we have in midfield right now.  Also, I think Drogba, Eto'o or a really big stretch with Van Persie would've been better then the route they took with Pirlo and Lampard since we desperately need a striker."

NYCFC,3cj631,samugolinifirenze,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:07:23 2015 UTC,"No, but because he is slow, his touch is bad, and because his nerves seem to get to him constantly.   Let's see what happens. I hope Angelino gets a chance, and I am pretty sure we won't see much more of Wingert."
NYCFC,3cj631,agoradsuxxx,3,Fri Jul 10 18:03:47 2015 UTC,"He's no longer on the injury report, so take that as you will.  (He was removed after the first Montreal match)"
NYCFC,3cj631,perpetual_student,2,Wed Jul 8 13:19:00 2015 UTC,"Which is strange because the roster page still has him listed as on the disabled list. Then again, this is the same roster page that was updated to show Pirlo, but doesn't have Iraola or Angelino listed.  Edit: They stopped including Tony Taylor after that first Montreal match too.

Kind of hard to imagine it would be in Columbia's best interest to breach this agreement and lose out on the additional income from the remaining games unless doing so would appease their future business partners (NYCFC).  Maybe I've got the tinfoil hat on.  Just doesn't make sense otherwise."
NYCFC,3chomu,perpetual_student,3,Wed Jul 8 01:43:38 2015 UTC,"Or, as was our concern, the neighborhood opposition was just too strong."

NYCFC,3chomu,nycjae24,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:38:37 2015 UTC,They only played 1 game there you know. Highly doubt it.
NYCFC,3chomu,BeerAndFuckingPizza,2,Wed Jul 8 14:06:04 2015 UTC,"I live very close to this site. As much as I want a NYCFC stadium and as much as I'd love it close to where I live so it's easy for me to get to, this site would be terrible for an MLS stadium. Very few roads, no parking, only one subway. One bar across the street and it's not even a sports bar, and small. I rather them end up in a better location for a stadium even if it means waiting another year or two."
NYCFC,3chomu,jgweiss,3,Wed Jul 8 04:39:37 2015 UTC,Biggest benefit is the marble hill metro north stop though. That and there are two trains if people walk down to the A which is not that far away. Broadway has a few bars up and down it that would be cool on game day. Nothing like Billy's in size comparison but district 12 and Tryon public house already welcome soccer fans with open arms. Tryon public house is my go to pub partner for away games.   Parking is certainly an issue but I hear they want to redevelop the old train yards. Maybe that's in their thinking?  I think it COULD be an awesome location but I agree that there are issues.
NYCFC,3chomu,THIS_IS_SO_HILARIOUS,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:48:50 2015 UTC,"you get my upvote for tryon public house, those guys are pretty fantastic."
NYCFC,3chomu,nycjae24,3,Wed Jul 8 19:50:22 2015 UTC,"The redevelopment certainly do not focus just on stadium,  but also the surrounding. I am sure they will add bars, restaurants, and parking spots for the stadium."
NYCFC,3chomu,BeerAndFuckingPizza,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:42:15 2015 UTC,"I agree those are some good bars, but they are a bit of a walk from the stadium. And that's true about the Metro North. I just can't imagine them knocking down all of the apartment buildings in the area, which is what they would need to do to redevelop. And they certainly will have an issue taking over that park space. It's not like Willet's Point where all you have is open space and little auto shops to redevelop like the Mets want to. Or even like Aqueduct."
NYCFC,3chomu,swampy13,2,Wed Jul 8 06:14:04 2015 UTC,"If you forget parking for a minute, they could fit the stadium on the Columbia grounds right? I think they would do everything possible to avoid tearing apartments down."
NYCFC,3chomu,BeerAndFuckingPizza,2,Wed Jul 8 06:53:49 2015 UTC,"There are arguably two subways (the A isn't THAT far of a walk, and skips a ton of stations at blistering speed)  The parking thing is annoying I suppose, but the stadium would only be about 30K.  Most season ticket holders (according to president Tom Glick) are people working in Manhattan, so they'd definitely be taking the subway.  To me, a lack of bars is a good thing.  There's no bars near the Philly stadium or the Red Bulls stadium.  That means you don't have a ton of drunk fans looking to get drunker in your neighborhood.  Yankee Stadium and Madison Square Garden, to me, are really the only stadiums that have a true sports bar presence around them.  And that's only because they have/had the space to establish a bunch."
NYCFC,3chomu,swampy13,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:00:52 2015 UTC,"If you think about the A Train it's an amazing train to be off of.   207th st connection to Bx12 SBS   175th st GWB terminal for anyone coming in by bus over the GW.   42nd st port authority connection  34th st penn station connection  Chambers st PATH train connection  Plus it's express for all these stops and it goes all the way out into Brooklyn. That coupled with the metro north station makes this spot super accessible to people coming in from outside the city and anyone that works or lives in Manhattan will tell you the A Train is the fastest way up and down the island.   So much better than the 4 train to Yankee stadium. The Columbia grounds are around 218th and the north entrance to the A train is on Isham which is intersecting with 211th. 7 blocks isn't much to complain about when you've got the 1, A, bx12SBS, bx7, and m100 right there. There is another bus I can't remember that takes you up Broadway into the Bronx other than the bx7 as well."

NYCFC,3chomu,jgweiss,2,Wed Jul 8 17:18:43 2015 UTC,For sure. I felt like it wasn't that fast recently and I tried taking the 1 train down and was overwhelmed by how slow it is in comparison. Once you hit 96th you can switch to the 2 3 which rocket down but it's nothing compared to the A

NYCFC,3chomu,kuyakew,4,Wed Jul 8 20:02:43 2015 UTC,"If a deal between Columbia and NYCFC is in the works, best for RBNY2 to get out before its announced. Nothing would leave them with more pie on their face then having their landlord be their rival."
NYCFC,3chomu,MrMaxson,2,Wed Jul 8 03:32:10 2015 UTC,Hopefully this is a sign of good faith from Columbia to NYCFC... or something. Something to signify a stadium deal moving forward.   I'd be interested to see how Columbia and NYC deal with the neighborhood opposition.
NYCFC,3chomu,OCinNYC,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:15:52 2015 UTC,"The neighborhood opposition to it was so ridiculous. NYCFC and Columbia had just started the conversation when The New York Times broke the story.  All of a sudden politicians and citizens are up in arms because they haven't been included. It's on par with someone telling me ""Hey, San Francisco is super nice,"" and my wife getting mad at me for considering moving and not consulting her.  It was always going to be a long-term project, which the public would have input on, but to be opposed to talks taking place was ludicrous from the people up there."
NYCFC,3chomu,imCeZ,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:54:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think Columbia needs NYCFC to renovate their stadium nearly as much as NYCFC needs their stadium/site.

This is a site they already own, minor problem for Columbia."

NYCFC,3chomu,MrMaxson,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:14:45 2015 UTC,Damn I was hoping we'd get more of just a soccer specific stadium rather than share it for football. Plus this location is a bit awkward in terms of parking and getting there. I've never taken the train this far up so maybe just a bit of bias. I wish people would rethink a stadium being in queens.
NYCFC,3chomu,dekal630,2,Wed Jul 8 17:22:12 2015 UTC,"I think, as a New York City team, we were always going to end up sharing the stadium. Knicks and Rangers share MSG. Nets and Islanders share Barclays, Jets and Giants share MetLife. It's part of the NYC sports makeup. Real Estate is just too expensive for a stadium that would only be used 20 days a year.  Inwood is super easy to get to from Midtown Manhattan, which I think is the barometer for which any deal is going to be hammered out. Accessible via Metro North (the Marble Hill station) or the A express train (which takes less than 30 minutes). Parking isn't great around the stadium, but it's a short walk to the Bronx for effective parking.  Plus, by working with Columbia University, you're in an easy position to get the public's support. The school already has a stadium up there... all they're saying is ""it's getting renovated and being used for an additional sport.""  It's an easy way to sell a lot of people."
NYCFC,3chomu,MrMaxson,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:51:52 2015 UTC,I agree with a lot of points. I guess I wouldn't be opposed having something like OCSC has.
NYCFC,3chomu,OCinNYC,2,Thu Jul 9 21:14:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks, buddy!  I totally know where you're coming from with the Queens idea too.

NYCFC,3cgfk9,lazyflowingriver,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:29:16 2015 UTC,"My understanding is both RBNY and NYCFC couldn't work out a deal with Sky Blue when they talked. As far as I know they definitely want to stay in NJ (their current owner is considering a governors run post-Christie), but that could change. If I had to guess, Sky Blue will eventually partner with RBNY, due to being able to stay in NJ and having more soccer specific facilities at the moment, but that's completely (biased) guesswork on my part."
NYCFC,3cgfk9,TheReelMalik,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:34:11 2015 UTC,I read that the reason it did not work out with RBNY is because Red Bull Gmbh were not interested do I don't think it'll happen with them. I hope NYCFC gets a deal done with them or they just start their own team that plays in the city.
NYCFC,3cgfk9,ibpants,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:26:52 2015 UTC,"My understanding of it was that Sky Blue's owner wanted all the benefits of having RB on board (including their money), but didn't want to give up a majority share. Not that the mothership wasn't interested. Basically having his cake and eating to too. Who really knows though, hopefully everything works out one way or the other."

They were discussing how if they keep drawing crowds as large as 48,000, they will eventually need to start talking about them. Yesterday they brought up NYCFC and the Red Bulls again, as one of the producers (I think) Andrew is a big soccer fan. He was explaining to Michael and Don how even when it is not a big game like the Red Bulls game, the stadium still sounds like its completely filled due to the energy of the crowd. Don then said he needed to commit to a team and picked NYCFC due to his relationship with Joe Tolleson"

NYCFC,3cg9o6,nachomancandycabbage,13,Tue Jul 7 18:59:02 2015 UTC,"On paper this team just got an incredible upgrade.  With Lampard, Villa, and Pirlo, NYCFC has the capacity to be the most creative attacking side in the league.  I don't think you can understate how the mere presence of Lampard and Pirlo is going to impact how teams have to game plan for NYCFC.    And if Facey is any indication of the talent coming out of Man City's academy -- with the addition of Angelino and Iraola (pinch me, I still can't believe he's coming) we could have just gone from one of the worst back lines in the league to one of the best.  I honestly believe that ownership has addressed all of the major talent deficiencies.  If this team can manage to squeak out some points while they work on their chemistry, we could seriously be peaking just in time for a deep playoff run.  I don't want to sound like a delusional homer, but holy shit I'm completely hyped for the possibilities going forward.  And you should be, too."
NYCFC,3cg9o6,rusmore,6,Tue Jul 7 19:35:55 2015 UTC,"Not to mention the possibility of signing Tefu Mashamaite, who's apparently pretty good."
NYCFC,3cg9o6,dekal630,7,Tue Jul 7 21:01:57 2015 UTC,"1)I do love the hype but we have to see them on the pitch first before we start saying were gonna win the cup. Its positive that the team has been winning as all of this is happening so I want to say were better but lets reign in by how much  2)We've seem to have been the most active this transfer window but with LA just getting Dos Santos at the same time Gerrard lands and reports of Chicha well see  3)Were close right now having gone on a winning tear  4)This ones entirely subjective, some would say making the playoffs is successful, some would go the we have a solid fanbase and now big names on our team route. I personally wanna see them make a go of it but in terms for an expansion team, finishing with a winning record would make many hopeful for the future."
NYCFC,3cg9o6,swiftmustang,2,Tue Jul 7 18:07:16 2015 UTC,Thanks for the insight. It seems like the team is really geling now. Hopefully the new players can come in right away and make a meaningful impact. I'm going to look forward to rooting us into the playoffs.
NYCFC,3cg9o6,dekal630,6,Tue Jul 7 18:17:36 2015 UTC,"Disregarding games played, with TFC and NYRB having less, we're only 4 points away from 2nd in the conference. That said, we're also only 5 points from the bottom. There's still half a season to play and a whole lot can happen then.  If we have a successful rest of July, where each team we play is above us and in playoff locations, you better put on a seatbelt because we'd be in for a hell of a ride."
NYCFC,3cg9o6,RhubarbManBB,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:25:27 2015 UTC,What's the strength of schedule for our remaining games look like? I took a quick look at it seems we haven't really played many tough teams yet. The majority seemed to have a worse record than us.
NYCFC,3cg9o6,OMFGTURTLEZ,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:31:28 2015 UTC,This is a lot of roster change in the middle of the season and it's just gonna take a while to all fit together. A lot is going to depend on these next 6 games. After that the schedule gets pretty tough with lots of difficult road games.
NYCFC,3cg9o6,ADustedEwok,5,Tue Jul 7 19:29:49 2015 UTC,"I think on paper, we're the best team in the MLS. But everyone knows that games aren't played on paper. I can't wait to see this squad perform one they've really got their chemistry worked out."
NYCFC,3cg9o6,NYCsoccerfan,9,Tue Jul 7 19:34:02 2015 UTC,I think the biggest signing is iraola. Our wbs are shit. Our wings get abused by the opposition. Being able to make the long pass to Villa is also huge and should help us.
NYCFC,3cg9o6,omgahippy,5,Tue Jul 7 18:07:13 2015 UTC,"Only reason he isn't being hyped is because he's relatively unknown to most.   Chances are if you are familiar with him you're already excited and if you're not, you've never heard of him so who cares.   My favorite move of the offseason. A non DP signing like this is incredible.   Edit: I just met him today. http://imgur.com/MqQSKnF"
NYCFC,3cg9o6,ADustedEwok,3,Tue Jul 7 18:36:25 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm hyped as all hell for Iraola. Maybe ever more hyped for him than Lampard.

For whatever it's worth, in FIFA he will be the best defender in MLS by rating.  Not trying to imply anything about the value of said ratings - just an interesting point."
NYCFC,3cg9o6,SeekersWorkAccount,2,Tue Jul 7 22:29:34 2015 UTC,"I think everyone is overlooking Angelino. It's understandable considering the legends that are coming but I see Angelino settling in a starting position running up the left wing pushing villa closer to midfield as opposed to on the wing. Angelino brings speed, skills and a crossing threat on the wing that we desperately need. He's going to make a huge impact."
NYCFC,3cg9o6,yomisterd,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:53:03 2015 UTC,"Do you see him played as a shuttle in the midfield diamond? I know he's a fullback, but with Pirlo being the defensive liability everyone seems to suggest, is it safe to put an attack oriented player in the back 4?  That said, he is young and I'm sure has the pace to track back but it seems to me that if we have Angelino, Pirlo, Lampard, and Villa all out on the pitch, we're extremely liable to counter-attacks.  Or I sound like an idiot and my lack of soccer tactical knowledge is showing right now"
NYCFC,3cg9o6,JoseNova,3,Wed Jul 8 05:42:33 2015 UTC,"When you play a 4-4-2 diamond (like we usually play), you need your fullbacks to make overlapping runs to help bring width to your attack, as a diamond formation is pretty narrow. Having an overlapping FB really opens up the game.   It does expose you a bit on the counter-attacks, youre absolutely right, but if its done correct the rest of the back line should be able to position themselves to balance out his runs up the pitch."
NYCFC,3cg9o6,Gavin1026,4,Wed Jul 8 15:09:14 2015 UTC,"I think we are better, but maybe not championship better. I think there will still be bumps along the road as Kreis figures out the lineup (especially for the backline). It will definitely be interesting to see how the rest of the MLS tries to compete with these signings in the off-season (Galaxy excluded). And I concur with those saying Iraola is one of our best signings. I think he can do a lot to strengthen our defense (much needed).  I think the season is a success if we a) beat NYRB in the last Derby match, b) make the playoffs, and c) lampard and pirlo gel enough to want to stay on longer."
NYCFC,3cg9o6,IsItFree,3,Tue Jul 7 21:04:40 2015 UTC,I'm enjoying all these wins as of late. Interesting to see us play other teams we've lost to and other teams we have yet to play. I really want to see nycfc vs orlando city
NYCFC,3cg9o6,puckinright,5,Tue Jul 7 19:38:20 2015 UTC,"I think it will make us a lot  better if the team gels. These signings are probably the best name recognition signings in the league and close to the best quality signings. We are definitely contenders for a playoff spot, we are 3 points out from 6th but the red bulls do have a game advantage on us. To me a successful season will be making the playoffs because of the signings we made it will be disappointing not to at least make the playoffs"
NYCFC,3cg9o6,RhubarbManBB,2,Tue Jul 7 18:08:03 2015 UTC,"I'm going to bite. I've been watching football/soccer for a while. Watched every NYCFC game including pre season. We would have made the playoffs without Angelino, Iraola, lampard and pirlo. The eastern conference is shaky the team has slowly been improving if the current starters villa, mix, Saunders, stay healthy along with other key players like Shelton poku and Mullins I'm more than confident we make a nice run to the playoffs. With the new additions I predict we finish second in the eastern conference . As far as the playoffs go it depends how the new players mesh and who's healthy put if things go well I see us contending for the cup. I know it's a bit early to make such a bold prediction but I honestly believe with what we have now and what we just added we are one of the best teams in MLS."

I think he's here specifically to toughen up.  If he does then we've got an excellent young player on our hands, otherwise we've got a liability."
NYCFC,3cev91,ibpants,2,Tue Jul 7 15:45:30 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Chelsea's U-18s were enormous and would give a physical challenge to many professional defenders.  But, you're right, his size is a bit of a concern, especially in the physical, athletic MLS."

The noise doesn't travel well in this stadium and most people don't join in on the chants until like the 80th minute.   As far as players to watch, Shelton and Poku are probably the most exciting. Iraola should be interesting to watch as well as Angelino. Both are fullbacks. Oh and Brovsky's mustache."

NYCFC,3cgwih,JustAteAPizza,2,Wed Jul 8 15:08:05 2015 UTC,"I'm relatively new as well. Saunders the GK has made some great saves and let in a few he could have put a little more effort in, but I like him. Shay Facey has been a great CB for us. Andoni Iraola is going to give some help at RB when he gets to the team. Everyone seems to love Poku as he brings some excitement and a bit of flair, but he mostly is a 60 min sub that tries to pick up the team in the midfield. Mix Diskerud is definitely one of the better midfielders on the USMNT and plays well when he has talent around him. You of course know about our big 3 designated players.   TL;DR we have a strong midfield right now, Villa has scored A LOT of goals as the only DP, and our defense is getting better. Oh, and we run a 4-4-2 diamond as of right now."
NYCFC,3cgwih,Gavin1026,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:48:16 2015 UTC,I was looking at the match history and highlights of the season so far and is our defense reliable?
NYCFC,3cgwih,perpetual_student,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:57:25 2015 UTC,It has been reliable since Hernandez and Facey have been paired in the middle with Jacobson as our defensive midfielder sitting in front of them. Facey has been fantastic while Hernandez has been good enough but not great.
NYCFC,3cgwih,JustAteAPizza,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:02:45 2015 UTC,"It's about to get a lot more reliable.  As a La Liga guy you'll know Andoni Iraola who will undoubtedly be our RB for every match going forward and immediately one of the best in the league.  On the other side we'll have a combination of Chris Wingert who's serviceable but getting on in age, and new-loanee from MCFC's academy Angelino, who's one of the academy's top prospects.  In the middle, Jason Hernandez and Shay Facey have only been getting better, and we'll also have a World-Class (when healthy) CB coming off the injured list in George John soon.  In front of them is Andrew Jacobson, who's been surprisingly good as our defensive mid at the base of our 4-4-2 diamond.  He's prone to getting heated and committing more fouls than he should,  and he'll likely be the Pirlo casualty once Mix comes back from the Gold Cup.  In goal, Saunders has been the man of the season.  He's making up for a lot of the mistakes our back line has been making.  Probably having the best season of his career."

NYCFC,3cfh5h,_sicnarf,4,Tue Jul 7 16:59:19 2015 UTC,"Its actually to prevent inflation and people have complete ownership of items going in the store, but nice try. You're thinking about it as the perspective of someone who has 2 or 4 seats. There's companies or teams that own 20-30 ticket blocks. If we let people combine seats they have 30k worth of points where the average person has 1k or 2k."
NYCFC,3cfh5h,_sicnarf,-4,Tue Jul 7 17:19:37 2015 UTC,I think if someone is willing to put in thousands to buy that many seats supporting the team they should give them the $.50 made in China cheap shirt.

NYCFC,3cd8si,perpetual_student,5,Tue Jul 7 00:34:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure it got it's own post, but every couple weeks someone will post something about ""Any stadium news?!"" and it usually gets discussed there.  For example, Tom Glick made some comments to Adweek just today regarding stadium plans.   You're planning to build your own stadium. Where does that stand?  It will need to be in one of the five boroughs, it needs to be centrally located, and it needs to have great public transportation. We're looking at lots and lots of sites. But we're not in a hurry. Yankee Stadium really is a great first home. The experience there is excellent. It's easy to get to. It's a venue with real gravitas. It's iconic around the world.  What's the timetable?  We're hopeful of being open in the first five years.   EDIT: Also, here are all the threads on the Columbia proposal."
NYCFC,3cd8si,perpetual_student,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:44:03 2015 UTC,"Alright thanks.  If it counts for anything, I kind of hope they don't go with it. A 25,000 seater sounds small to me."
NYCFC,3cd8si,hoya14,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:00:49 2015 UTC,"FWIW, they usually only open YS to ~27k, so it wouldn't be too different from what we're using now."
NYCFC,3cd8si,perpetual_student,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:21:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah but we've filled it to ~45k for important games. I don't know much about this stuff, but wouldn't you not want to limit your ticket sales too much? Sure you can charge more per ticket that way, but maybe we should go for a 30 or 35k seater?"
NYCFC,3cd8si,dekal630,3,Tue Jul 7 01:28:47 2015 UTC,"I think having consistent sell outs is more valuable than having a bit of extra room for 1 or 2 big games a year. I would be okay with it, though, if they had an ""overflow"" area that was integrated into the design in a smart way. Like corner sections that are ordinarily tarped but can be opened up for safe standing, or something like that."
NYCFC,3cb0o6,sbrylski,3,Mon Jul 6 14:37:27 2015 UTC,"Just a word of caution:  STHs talking about their experience in the secondary market are likely talking about tickets in sections that have been sold out for months.  You literally haven't been able to buy a single ticket in my section, except through the secondary market, this entire season.  So there's a real supply and demand issue at work here.  Looking at the next two home matches, for instance, there are 3 seats available for the match against Toronto and 0 seats in my section for the match against Orlando.  That means not only that tickets in the secondary market are in high demand in my section, but also that STHs are able to command a significant premium for the seats.  For example, the cheapest ticket for sell on the resell market in my section is twice the face value.  Some prices are even higher -- much higher.  All that said, I'm not sure if the same logic for the secondary market holds for seats where season tickets are still available.  I'd expect the NYCFC hype to continue to build steam as Lamps and Pirlo arrive and the resell market to continue to be pretty advantageous for sellers.  But I think it really depends on where the seats are and what's available around you."
NYCFC,3cb0o6,rusmore,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:23:42 2015 UTC,I've bought resold tickets and some people are just outrageous with their sales. If you're price is reasonable shouldn't be too difficult.
NYCFC,3cb0o6,NikDaQuick1219,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:07:45 2015 UTC,"/u/sbrylski if you do end up getting the tickets, use PIRLO21 and you get a free t-shirt =p"
NYCFC,3cb0o6,perpetual_student,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:23:51 2015 UTC,I am surprised by some of the comments where are you all selling?  I have second row seats in 205 and have trouble giving them away if I don't make it. If I try to sell on stubhub I'd get less than face value after the fees. I'd rather give them to friends and family and because of the late sunday games and weekday games I have few friends willing to go.  I also have 2nd row on my account in Delta Sky (friends bought these and never go) and have sold on stubhub once and recouped less than half face value after fees. All other games I give them away for a free beer.  I have had little to no luck recouping any money when I can't make a game.
NYCFC,3cb0o6,jwtorres,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:08:56 2015 UTC,"Why don't you sell them on TicketExchange (directly through your account)?  Fees are much lower than StubHub, and I've had pretty good luck selling my tickets (I have section 205, quite a bit farther back than you)."
NYCFC,3cb0o6,fdar,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:47:59 2015 UTC,I rarely sell my 205 seats. I am usually looking to get rid of the delta sky and was turned off by the fact you couldn't list them lower than face value on the site. I was worried I would be stuck with them.
NYCFC,3cb0o6,jwtorres,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:33:25 2015 UTC,"I sold one for the Red Bulls match after a friend had to cancel. It went okay and sold in a couple of days. That said, this was in the 300 level which isn't normally open, and the demand for that match was tremendous."

NYCFC,3cb0o6,joshdts,2,Mon Jul 6 15:58:32 2015 UTC,"yeah it is.  its fine if you dont want to take part in secondary markets, but to ask others to hold your same beliefs that contradict basic capitalist principles is silly, imo."
NYCFC,3cb0o6,stone_cold_bubs,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:27:28 2015 UTC,"I take issue with supporters being priced out of a game because someone wants to flip their ticket and make money off them, that's all."
NYCFC,3cb0o6,joshdts,2,Mon Jul 6 16:48:19 2015 UTC,OK... will you buy my tickets at face value if nobody else buys them?  Or do you just expect STH to sell at face value when tickets are hot and eat the loses when they can't go to a game without as much interest?
NYCFC,3cb0o6,fdar,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:08:56 2015 UTC,"i doubt many are priced out of a game, esp in the supporters sections- there are very rarely any for sale when I list mine, and mine go nearly instantly."

On a semi-related note: has there been any peep about an NYCFC-Sky Blue FC partnership since last year? It'd be awesome to have an NWSL partner and Sky Blue would surely benefit from our awesome fan base. I do wonder how it'd work though? Would they move to NYC? They're very much a NJ team, not NY-but-play-in-NJ. We don't have a SSS to share with them either. But boy would they fit in nicely with their name and colors already haha."

I think the one that stands out the most is his surprisingly poor ability to win the aerial duals. Wouldn't be surprised if he was let go because of his pay check like others have pointed out."
NYCFC,3c73mk,dekal630,3,Sun Jul 5 15:18:05 2015 UTC,"It's hard to predict the ""business decision"" moves because allocation money is kept secret.  We don't know how much we'd be paying either of these new guys (or even how much cap space we have now).  It's possible we can cut a guy like KWS and still pull it off.  We won't know until the announcements are made official."
NYCFC,3c73mk,NYCsoccerfan,3,Sun Jul 5 15:27:16 2015 UTC,"It's impossible because MLS isn't very transparent.   They could be under roster size with Tony Taylor and George John on the DL.

NYCFC,3c73mk,ncquake24,4,Sun Jul 5 16:18:55 2015 UTC,"He's gonna end up being the Pirlo casualty.  He's not making a shit-ton of money (probably in the $50k range that Kwame's making), so it's a small dent in terms of cap space.  But if we cut both him and KWS that's $100k freed up for Tefu and Mena.  Calle was making ~$40k with Medellin, so I can't imagine Mena was making much more.   Tefu's probably a bit more expensive than that."

I'll try and figure it out but don't hold your breath. Club has gone into lockdown after the Pirlo webpage was found.   My guess would be a trialist as he's been photographed with the players wearing those singlets as opposed to the coach who don't wear them.   Edit: My theory for the longest time had been that it's Iraola. I thought it was confirmed when they announced him but we haven't seen him anywhere else.

NYCFC,3c5r5h,17danlu,7,Sun Jul 5 03:18:08 2015 UTC,NYC! USA! NYC! USA!
NYCFC,3c5r5h,Outcomedawolves,6,Sun Jul 5 02:05:30 2015 UTC,"I too, am happy!"
NYCFC,3c5r5h,EinWindir,3,Sun Jul 5 02:05:04 2015 UTC,"My thoughts after the game: ""how did we pull that off?... WHO CARES, WE WON!"""
NYCFC,3c5r5h,icreateddisco,2,Sun Jul 5 02:35:55 2015 UTC,"Gotta say, villa has been king this season. Love him and hope he continues scoring. Want him to be top scorer in his first season!"
NYCFC,3c5r5h,Drasu123,3,Sun Jul 5 02:09:03 2015 UTC,Hell yeah!!!  Making John Adams proud.
NYCFC,3c5r5h,ChrisBerman,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:32:19 2015 UTC,Can anybody tell me what was going on in midfield this match?  Why was it so hard to move the ball forward?  Was someone playing out of position?  Were we just outmatched?
NYCFC,3c5r5h,nachomancandycabbage,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:19:49 2015 UTC,No Mix prolly

NYCFC,3c742f,Justloggingin,3,Sun Jul 5 14:19:08 2015 UTC,"In the 200s they don't check tickets after the national anthem, and only inconsistently before that.  There are always blocks of empty seats in 234 and 205, I'm sure you could meet your friends there.  You could also head to the Mohegan Sun."
NYCFC,3c742f,HCastorpnyc,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:46:19 2015 UTC,Thanks!
NYCFC,3c742f,perpetual_student,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:52:14 2015 UTC,"Those are both assigned-seating sections.  You may be able to get away with it later in the match if the seats are sparse, but they generally have ushers all over the field level to prevent people from doing that."
NYCFC,3c742f,bpmo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:26:53 2015 UTC,Thanks!
NYCFC,3c742f,RhubarbManBB,3,Sun Jul 5 14:52:10 2015 UTC,"If there happens to be spare seats, you can always have one of your friends bring his ticket out to the concourse to meet you as well as another one of your friends' tickets. That'll get you both back in to the section."
NYCFC,3c5wb0,perpetual_student,33,Sun Jul 5 03:02:57 2015 UTC,"Saunders. Incredible to say when Villa has 2 goals, but there's no question."
NYCFC,3c5wb0,fanaka66,2,Sun Jul 5 03:04:48 2015 UTC,Have to say Saunders as well back line seemed like shit tonight.
NYCFC,3c5wb0,fire815,2,Sun Jul 5 03:52:26 2015 UTC,Saunders duh. He owned the first half.
NYCFC,3c5wb0,JohnnyCashFan69,-1,Sun Jul 5 03:57:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly they should be considering Saunders for USMNT after that. I know he's not Tim Howard, but we'll need a successor."
NYCFC,3c5wb0,theArkotect,5,Sun Jul 5 10:14:10 2015 UTC,"Saunders can't play for USMNT, he's got Puerto Rican soccer citizenship"
NYCFC,3c5wb0,BeatsByTre,2,Sun Jul 5 13:48:47 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess we've got another reason for the 51st state."
NYCFC,3c5wb0,theArkotect,4,Sun Jul 5 15:15:02 2015 UTC,Saunders is only two years younger than Howard and will be 38 for the next World Cup.
NYCFC,3c5wb0,theArkotect,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:24:07 2015 UTC,Dam.. Alright then maybe he can be backup
NYCFC,3c5wb0,_sicnarf,23,Sun Jul 5 12:22:25 2015 UTC,Villa. Showing why he's the face of the franchise and coming through in the biggest moments.
NYCFC,3c5wb0,JohnnyCashFan69,5,Sun Jul 5 03:13:41 2015 UTC,See it's tough. Normally Villa would be MOTM but if not for Saunders it would have been 4-2 Montreal.
NYCFC,3c5wb0,_sicnarf,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:21:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they each deserve it in ways that don't overlap. Really tough choice."
NYCFC,3c5wb0,BlackfishDiggy,-3,Sun Jul 5 12:30:40 2015 UTC,"All year I've seen cock eaters on this sub bash him, where r u now douche crew?"
NYCFC,3c3hss,ToTheBattery,6,Sat Jul 4 12:08:46 2015 UTC,Your south park flag was just on TV after the 2nd David Villa goal FYI.
NYCFC,3c3hss,JohnnyCashFan69,2,Sun Jul 5 01:48:54 2015 UTC,"Was just about to post this, haha."
NYCFC,3c3hss,BlueKun,5,Sun Jul 5 01:50:09 2015 UTC,This is awesome. Try and get a shot of you guys waving the flag at the stadium.   Bonus points: have Canadians looking on in disapproval.
NYCFC,3c3hss,NYCsoccerfan,2,Sat Jul 4 12:49:39 2015 UTC,Here it is!  Amazing day out. Voice was gone all day today.   http://i.imgur.com/myhcdak.jpg
NYCFC,3c3hss,swampy13,5,Mon Jul 6 01:01:05 2015 UTC,I just cried so many freedom tears.  This is awesome.  Nice dig at Canada.  'MURICA!
NYCFC,3c3hss,kentuckyfriedawesome,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:45:49 2015 UTC,I'm here too! Where are you getting drinks before the game?
NYCFC,3c3hss,s1ark5,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:33:27 2015 UTC,McLeans is the meet-up spot.  Off St Catherine st.   We're getting there around 430. Pretty sure we need to be at Saputo at 7 to go in so we'll prob leave McLean's 615/630 and get the Metro.
NYCFC,3c3hss,TrynaGetThePipe,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:36:37 2015 UTC,I actually chuckled out loud while taking a crap when I saw this.  LOL....well done.
NYCFC,3c3hss,jgweiss,-17,Sat Jul 4 12:57:02 2015 UTC,I don't know which flag is more embarrassing
NYCFC,3c3hss,TrynaGetThePipe,10,Sat Jul 4 13:46:56 2015 UTC,"Do you sit down during the anthem during home games? You should, its a stronger message than making an edgy online comment on the 4th of July."
NYCFC,3c3hss,JohnnyCashFan69,-12,Sat Jul 4 15:51:57 2015 UTC,I look at my phone and don't take my hat off if I'm wearing one.
NYCFC,3c3hss,TrynaGetThePipe,4,Sat Jul 4 16:33:32 2015 UTC,The American obviously. We are literally the worst thing ever because tv and blogs tell me.
NYCFC,3c3hss,swampy13,-10,Sat Jul 4 14:20:41 2015 UTC,We're not the worst thing ever but we're definitely nothing to be proud of
NYCFC,3c3hss,JohnnyCashFan69,9,Sat Jul 4 15:42:22 2015 UTC,THAT guy.
NYCFC,3c3hss,TrynaGetThePipe,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:45:36 2015 UTC,You aren't the only guy in the world with self hating white guilt. It doesn't make you special. It's almost a trend at this point so if you want to be cooky and different you might want to try something else.
NYCFC,3c3hss,JohnnyCashFan69,2,Sat Jul 4 22:06:15 2015 UTC,Where did you get white guilt from
NYCFC,3c3hss,TrynaGetThePipe,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:00:47 2015 UTC,It goes hand in hand with america hatred honestly. You think you are some special privileged kid who hates his own country but sorry Charlie there are toms of edgy people like you here in NY alone among other places. Its become a weirs trend so you aren't special is my point.
NYCFC,3c3hss,JohnnyCashFan69,-1,Sun Jul 5 02:06:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to be special, I genuinely am ashamed to be American. The difference between me and them (btw nice try trivialising them by acting like they're just trying to be 'edgy' and 'special') is I've put my money where my mouth is and left the country"
NYCFC,3c3hss,TrynaGetThePipe,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:09:21 2015 UTC,Oh yea? Where did you go?
NYCFC,3c46la,perpetual_student,5,Sat Jul 4 16:38:57 2015 UTC,Any one know of a stream?
NYCFC,3c46la,spacecitizen27,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:57:43 2015 UTC,Or televising or anything? I'm out in the middle of Illinois ...
NYCFC,3c46la,franch,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:19:51 2015 UTC,It's on r/soccerstreams but it's in french so I'm watching it on mute.
NYCFC,3c46la,OMFGTURTLEZ,3,Sun Jul 5 00:02:30 2015 UTC,My XI:          Saunders Williams KWS Facey Calle         Jacobson    Shelton   McNamara           Poku    Mullins    Villa   Now that's based on who I think will actually play given the Injury report.  I'd much rather have Josh Williams in at RB and really pray that Hernandez is healthy enough to play CB or we're in serious trouble at the back.  EDIT: The official injury report has been released.  Updating to reflect changes.  Alternatively:         Saunders Williams-KWS-Facey-Calle   Jacobson -McNamara Shelton-Poku-Velasquez         Villa

NYCFC,3c46la,xTheMaster99x,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:51:31 2015 UTC,Hopefully he doesn't get another red.
NYCFC,3c46la,NYCsoccerfan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:06:58 2015 UTC,"Sounds good to me, although I definitely echo your hopes that Hernandez can play. I can definitely see that XI getting a nice handful of goals, and I'll be pretty hyped if Shelton gets to start."

NYCFC,3c46la,ExternalTangents,2,Sat Jul 4 22:09:22 2015 UTC,Maybe Canadians?
