DarkSouls2,3e1dle,Thalnagath,131,Tue Jul 21 05:16:37 2015 UTC,Yea they are pretty bullshit but I was looking for something to use my poison arrows on anyways
DarkSouls2,3e1dle,wickedblight,45,Tue Jul 21 05:34:41 2015 UTC,"Poison arrows are like cruise control for the entire game. If it doesn't poison to at least 7 poison arrows it will most likely never do so or simply require a different method.   In my opinion the following items are all you need to beat the entire game:   Dagger (tutorial area on a corpse) Crimson parma (in the path leading to heides in a chest) Morningstar (after things betwixt off a cliff at majula on a corpse) Craftsmans hammer (in the chest a blacksmith sits on, light a torch and reload the area, to have him moved) Shortbow (in a chest at the lenigrasts' shop, infuse with fire if you get the chance to) Wooden arrows (lenigrast sells wooden arrows for 10 souls a piece, having 200 will suffice) Poison arrows (lonesome Gavlan sells them but be sure to have enough souls otherwise you will miss your chance for a long time or collect enough items to sell and you should be able to buy 200 arrows with 12000 souls)   EDIT:   Mailbreaker/ Rapier depending on your dex stat. (rapiers can be bought at lenigrast but also drop at the shaded forest route from ballsack creatures and mailbreakers drop from spiders at tseldora.)   These items are less likely to suffice for a no bonfire or no death run but for pve are more than you will ever need. If you only invest in STR,DEX,ADP 10,12,10 it should work out perfectly fine."
DarkSouls2,3e1dle,SirBadAssALot,40,Tue Jul 21 05:55:31 2015 UTC,Oh no question poison arrows trivialize 90% of the game but I try not to use them. On the other hand there's nothing you can do when 4 of those lizards are belly-slide chain fucking you so I really don't feel bad about cheesing that shit
DarkSouls2,3e1dle,wickedblight,13,Tue Jul 21 06:04:02 2015 UTC,Using pre-nerf lightning spells was like playing COD on beginner. Or pre-nerf geyser.
DarkSouls2,3e1dle,UltrafastFS_IR_Laser,3,Tue Jul 21 07:01:08 2015 UTC,GRS needed it's nerf too although I still miss my powerful Abyss ring. I would have gladly accepted way more health loss if it meant I could keep the huge damage buff
DarkSouls2,3e1dle,wickedblight,13,Tue Jul 21 07:18:43 2015 UTC,"I know the feeling. Poison arrows are way too overpowered in this game. A player can outheal poison but most AI enemies don't even heal, allowing the poison to kill them in a single try. There are times the game becomes downright boring because of this. For comparison most poison melee weapons have only a very low success rate in poisoning.   Perhaps it sounds rude but one would expect better consideration to balancing the AI to counter poison from the makers. A lot of enemies that use poison themselves don't even attempt to remove the stat. They don't take cover and often walk towards you in a straight line allowing you to pull target practice on them.   On the otherhand on enemies poison really needs to work on it is truly a blessing. High hp enemies like the lizards or low contact enemies like the icy spiky thingies at loyce are just that much safer to take down. 3 arrows is the easiest poison in the entire game.   Sadly the frozen reindeers don't poison with their high health and strength in numbers I hoped for better. Not to mention the lock-on function on them is really bad, allowing arrows to miss even when the target is standing still right in front of the player."
DarkSouls2,3e1dle,SirBadAssALot,10,Tue Jul 21 06:22:02 2015 UTC,"True although the argument could be made that only the first playthrough is the ""true Dark Souls experience"" and from there you can enrich or cheese the game as you see fit. You're only ruining your own experience if you use ""exploits"" like this & you're unlikely to abuse poison arrows too badly on your first run."
DarkSouls2,3e1dle,wickedblight,-12,Tue Jul 21 06:37:58 2015 UTC,"The only way for a true Dark Souls experience to be had in this game is to join Company of Champions immediately upon arriving in Majula during your first-ever playthrough.    The game is so much easier than DeS and DkS1, especially with the NPC summons added by SotFS.  Being in Company of Champions brings it back to the difficulty we all know and love/hate."
DarkSouls2,3e1dle,GamerNotCasul,13,Tue Jul 21 13:21:05 2015 UTC,"I never understood why people say DS2 is so much easier than DS1.  True, the bosses are easier than the DS1 bosses (except for Fume Knight, the kitties in ivory king dlc and maybe the bullshit twin pursuers), but DS2 has stuff like the shrine of amana (seriously, fuck this place!) and overall much harder ways to reach the bosses imho. The only really hard part of DS1 is the way to Asterix and Obelix and Manus (seriously, Fume Knight is Manus 2.0)  If you use the NPC summons it's easier of course, but that's your own decision (Reminder: You even have an NPC summon at Gwyn)  I found my first run in DS2 so much harder than my first DS1 run (I did both blind)"

DarkSouls2,3e1dle,Mohl97,2,Tue Jul 21 19:15:46 2015 UTC,"I could argue against that.   The Company of Champions mostly makes the spawn endless, which is favorable and exploitable because of it's unbalanced droprate and souls. Because of the repetition of the challenge the game becomes ultimately easier rather than harder as intended. The increased stats of enemies are for a first playthrough trivial as their weakenesses and placement remains the same.   There is another problem in that all hints have to come either from players or from programmed messages and npc summons. I'm of the opinion that the game should grant diverse methods to the player to obscurely investigate the layout and puzzles of an area and plan their goals effectively ahead without the punishing finity of resources.  Respawn locations of enemies should be more random and rewards should be adjusted to the playthrough's setup. Additionally the droprates should be full or null. Chances are highly discouraging to players and turn gaming into a chore."
DarkSouls2,3e1dle,SirBadAssALot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:27:35 2015 UTC,"I agree that CoC feels more right but I didn't do it my first playthrough, but also really don't think it's any easier than dks1. I played 2 first, and going back to one and after getting used to the controls I had a reasonably easy time. I think your first souls game will always be the hardest just because they're so different than things you're used to."
DarkSouls2,3e1dle,Meto1183,4,Tue Jul 21 18:53:16 2015 UTC,"Even if poison arrows are easy mode, I get great satisfaction from axing enemies from a distance with them.  If the devs want to balance poison arrows better, they should give enemies better AI.  I've been thwarted by Gyrm before because they raise their shields.  Other enemies should take cover or raise their own shields to block the poison."
DarkSouls2,3e1dle,Tarcanus,4,Tue Jul 21 13:22:08 2015 UTC,"I would rather have arrows work more rewarding with headshots and with minimal damage on the rest of the body, scaling even further down with different armor. Additionally AI could be more adjusted to use poison moss after seeking shelter or that they coordinate their allies to make use of your newly found location, something along those lines. It would greatly increase the dynamic for bowmanship and increase the pressure on the sniper to make accurate and fast decisions."
DarkSouls2,3e1dle,SirBadAssALot,3,Tue Jul 21 14:07:53 2015 UTC,I'd be okay with any/all of those changes.

DarkSouls2,3e1dle,BillohRly,3,Tue Jul 21 06:58:46 2015 UTC,"I mean it's well past the point that people have proved you don't ""need"" any items to beat the game. Using Ladle or bare fists would be boring and frustrating, but it's really only a matter of how much time you're willing to spend."
DarkSouls2,3e1dle,Flying_Slig,3,Tue Jul 21 12:52:30 2015 UTC,On the other hand the amount of time used for truly barehanded combat is just beyond insane. It would be a very punishing chore to kill several enemies and a boss barehanded while taking evasion into account as well.   Broken caestus are just fine and keep most of their damage output so the battle won't be as long. I doubt anyone would be wanting to concentrate several hours in a row with the addition of the possibility of failure and having to start all over again.   Fully barehanded combat is far beyond masochistic.

He also runs the other souls games, bloodborne, and others."
DarkSouls2,3e1dle,SalvationIsHere,0,Tue Jul 21 16:00:05 2015 UTC,"I often realize that it requires room for sacrifices to do these things. Spending time on one thing requires not doing something else. I would never spend that much time on dark souls. This is not to discredit LobosJr but to point out that we are all different people and make different decisions with our time. I could beat a boss with almost any weapon, but I would have to try all kinds of different approaches, I would need to learn all kinds of attack patterns and I need to adjust to all these patterns in a manner that leaves no room for mistakes. All of these decisions require considerable time and in my eyes the return of success does never equal the investment of failure and learning."
DarkSouls2,3e1dle,SirBadAssALot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:18:58 2015 UTC,"True, but he's a full time streamer, so it's his job.

DarkSouls2,3e1dle,PhazonTuxedo,2,Tue Jul 21 06:52:22 2015 UTC,Rapier is a good weapon and deals large amounts of damage due the counter damage value and old leo ring. It's also really fast but it's linear movement and exclusive trusting damage can be a downside when dealing with enemies that simply take more striking(blunt) damage or bosses that require large single hits with short moments of melee distances. You often need high dex values for rapiers compared to other weapons. The durability suffers the most of all weapons in my opinion only to be above daggers which are humanoid combat dedicated. Lastly some enemies will sidestep the attack if not manually aimed at.  I'll include it.

He starts in No-Man's Wharf, after talking to him he'll move to Harvest Valley, after talking to him there he'll move to the Doors of Pharros and remain there. He gives small numbers of souls for your items and each item has a different sale value. Handy for getting rid of excess items you can't put into your Item box at the bonfire."
DarkSouls2,3e1dle,CrystlBluePersuasion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:56:27 2015 UTC,"Gavlan is the only npc that has a sell option for items. Once you select sell you will be in the first inventory window (weapons) and you can scroll through. Be carefull though, he will have moved to another area once you finish interacting and reload the area (die, warp or rest at bonfire). This is the reason to have (close to) enough souls with you when you decide to interact with him.   You won't be able to buy things from or sell to him until you meet him again. He is the chubby viking at no man's wharf located at the switch for the gate to the inn. After reloading the area you will find him at harvest valley in a cave hidden in poisonous fog. After that he will move to pharros doors and stay there without moving."

DarkSouls2,3e1dle,CaptainAction,3,Tue Jul 21 07:49:15 2015 UTC,"That's a fair point that deserves to be mentioned. For creators as well as programmers the pressure to produce for limited resources, time and money has risen during the last decades.   Stockholders desire an optimum investment return ratio, which limits the ultimate quality of the possible product. I say possible because the project will get cancelled once the chance of a favorable return has dropped below the investment.   Of course, for stockholders their investment return ratio is a mathematical correct choice but it also limits the interference of chance, be it favorable or the opposite.  This is to say that it would be incorrect to blame parties for their success despite their performance being outstanding.   Contrary to these circumstances games and their creators evolve in a sense. Game creators can work for the competition and the knowledge they possess is unique and can be enchanged to the favor of both parties without damaging the secrecy and quality of projects."

So maybe non-story NPCs can be used over and over again.

DarkSouls2,3e1dle,ChinamanPeedOnMyRug,5,Tue Jul 21 07:39:16 2015 UTC,"Heide's seems to be considered as a two-boss area, and Glencour can be summoned as long as at least one of them is alive.  Luet is a shade and as such still summonable if the boss is dead. Pate is a phantom, but I don't get why you can't summon him for Pursuer : to me it seems like the same situation as Heide's. Maybe it's because of the fog-separated area that is bossed by Pursuer."
DarkSouls2,3e1dle,CrazyCatSloth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:11:06 2015 UTC,"This is the same reason you can still see a player's small sign after a boss is dead, but not a large sign. It allows players to offer their services through a particularly difficult area that doesn't end in a boss fight (like the salamander puts) and still get some kind of reward for successfully aiding the host (completing a task or their timer running out).   NPC summons work the same way. I think the thought is to allow a player to backtrack and still have help to explore optional parts of difficult areas (like, say, Shrine of Amana if you're going back for the flask shard or Vendrick's stuff), even if you've already killed the area boss for story progression purposes."

DarkSouls2,3e1dle,bers90,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:48:37 2015 UTC,"They're the exception.  Most monsters have pretty normal, acceptable amounts of health.  Even bosses with 10k health like Alonne and Fume Knight aren't that frustrating."
DarkSouls2,3e1dle,demonssouls12345,2,Tue Jul 21 15:45:57 2015 UTC,"Have to tried burning bonfire ascetics/entering NG+? In DS1 and DeS enemy hp didn't increase all that much from NG to NG+6, it was mostly their increased damage output you needed to worry about. But in this game pretty much any enemy that's decently strong in NG becomes a colossal damage sponge in NG+7."
DarkSouls2,3e1dle,SullyManTheGrey,3,Tue Jul 21 18:09:35 2015 UTC,"This isn't actually a Dark Souls II problem inherently- Bloodborne has the exact same problem, in that enemy hp skyrockets as low as NG+1 and you wind up getting beat down in wars of attrition."

DarkSouls2,3e1dle,SullyManTheGrey,2,Tue Jul 21 19:25:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a really fun game! It has some big problems, but they don't stop the playthrough from being one of the best PVE experiences in the series. The bad things in BB are mostly related to its PVP and the chalice dungeons, which I guess may or may not be deal breakers for you.  And I wouldn't count on DS3 being released on the PlayStation 3... the poor thing can barely handle Dark Souls II."

DarkSouls2,3e1dle,Moss_Berg,12,Tue Jul 21 15:33:44 2015 UTC,"flame salamanders show us several flaws about the games fighting mechanics:   insane tracking. have you ever tried walk around them very closely to avoid their fire? well, you were not supposed to do that because they will spin around with an insane speed tracking you with their head, but while doing so they'll also push you around, resulting in a carousel! attacks not suited for your character's limitations. how are we supposed to dodge those fireballs? side stepping? they are to fast and they aim perfectly. i-frames? almost impossible to roll through 3 in a row since they are shot at a different frequency than our character can roll. badly designed attacks like this occur on some other enemies as well. like for example dragonkeeper mace guy or heide knights. we need reaction time and possibilities to avoid attacks in a face to face combat."
DarkSouls2,3e1dle,TangyRaptor,5,Tue Jul 21 12:16:18 2015 UTC,Tracking is one of my biggest issues with Dark Souls 2. There are so many enemies with huge hammers and massive windups and you go to dodge their fucking slam... and they just magically pivot to crush you anyway. It's not an issue after you've fought them a couple times but when you initially encounter them it just feels ridiculously cheap.
DarkSouls2,3e1dle,Tagov,3,Tue Jul 21 15:45:25 2015 UTC,"On top of the (1), their insane tracking makes their insta-knockdown charge ability nearly impossible to avoid."

Navlaan is really strong, but Maldron is only strong because of the areas he is in, therefore I believe that Maldron would be beaten quite easily, however Navlaan can be... problematic due to his strong hexes  In the end, I believe the summons would win, due to them having more HP, and being pretty damn awesome"

I used hacks to be sanic, and the amount of fun that playthrough had was great. Following the chariot, speeding past people in Doors of pharros, figuring out how to effectively damage last giant the first time around.  With a bit of work, you can use hacks to make a unique playthrough and breathe new life into the game. For example, the sanic playthrough. While you're incredibly fast and have high stamina regen. On the other hand, you jump really far and higg, whoch is a double edged sword. You may be able to jump the iron keep bridge, but if you need a small jump, you need to either jump like 40 before the ledge, or try using a jumping attack instead.

SL 150's you will find a lot of Rob-Flynns just because I mean... cmon +100 free damage when you're trying to squeeze your build down to 150. SL 200 allows for most builds to be done w/o rings.  Beyond that... SL 250 is where you start to get the ""everyone of everything"" style that comes into play at high SL/SM. Everyone may have a build style but they all have the basics and softcaps. It's also when you really can run into Mundane Builds.  The Stone Ring rather gimps heavy armor though meaning you really need 120+ to even see consistent returns. Anything of 30 Poise Damage or higher with Stone Ring will destroy you. My Blackdragon Greataxe alone requires ~110 poise to not get staggered by the 1hr1 (the lightest attack)."

Later in the game, particularly in NG+, armor's already lackluster effectiveness is diminished even further. It's about the same story in PVP: the defenses just don't justify their equip weight.  Poise, however, is a different story. It's useful in both PVE and PVP, depending on how slow your own method of attack is, and how much poise you have. It's been a while, but I'm pretty sure the magic poise value you need in PVP is 82 or 84 to not get staggered by the strongest attack possible (that is to say, the strongest of the ones that aren't a guaranteed stun in the first place).  That being said, the Stone Ring immediately makes that magic poise value completely useless, so it's generally better to not bother with heavy gear at all. RoB+Flynn builds can have much more efficient stat allocation at level 150, anyway."

Burn an ascetic as soon as you beat the Skeleton Lords, so you can get the Blue Clearstone Ring +2, so you can get your pyro off even faster.  Black Knight weapons are great when infused with fire, my fave is the BKGS, found in the IronKeep, after you go through Belfrey Sol.    Possessed Armour Sword is  a sword I see a lot of pyro builds with, though I can't say if it's any good. Takes some farming. Speaking of farming, you can also fram the Fire Slamanders for some ok  pyro spells if you really have the patience. But really, other than flame weapon, great combustion is  pretty much all you need.  Not that I am so great, but my most recent character is STR/pyro."

SL 150 Bluemoon Greatsword Pyromancer   That build uses a Raw BMGS, Fire Zweihander, Fire Bandit Axe, Fire  Greatsword, ect. It hits really hard.

DarkSouls2,3dxpjl,Thalnagath,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:56:12 2015 UTC,"Regardless, not all optional areas need tough enemies, but it makes sense from a game design standpoint to have an optional area within an early-game area that has very tough enemies. You go down, trying to explore and get your ass handed to you, and then you decide to come back later once your character is stronger. Stuff like that promotes a return to an early area. This can be further backed up by it being the location of the giant memories. They knew that you would be coming back to the area in the first place.   I don't think the flame salamanders are that much of anomaly at all, when taken in that context."
DarkSouls2,3dxpjl,ShiitakeTheMushroom,2,Mon Jul 20 23:59:32 2015 UTC,I'm only talking about how you classified the salamanders as end-game enemies because they're in an optional area.
DarkSouls2,3dxpjl,TheGreyGuardian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:46:12 2015 UTC,"Well it would be mean of them to put end-game enemies at the beginning of the game in a non-optional area, wouldn't it?"

DarkSouls2,3e00l1,ninthbelief,3,Mon Jul 20 23:55:45 2015 UTC,"I plan to do something very similar to this, albeit in video format, before Dark Souls III's release -- I'm really excited that someone else is looking forward to bridging some lore gaps in the community's current lore interpretations, and will definitely be jumping back to read your other two when I'm done with your third installment.  Just sort of commenting as I read, and I'm definitely guilty of skimming as I'm constantly flipping back, so I'm incredibly sorry if I make you repeat anything you already clarified in your writeup --   Vendrick's prize is essentially confirmed as taking some Giants back from their land, reinforced by the the Giant Lord's soul description, the Golem technology, and Aldia's pile of butchered Giant's in his manor. What's your opinion on this theory? What's your argument against it since it's not 100% congruent with your ""he took a giant lord soul"" theory? Vendrick WAS strong enough to link the fire -- Nashandra's chagrin stems from her inability to convince him to, as his Age of Dark was founded on his unwillingness to link the fire. His unwillingness is, in a cycle-scholar's eyes, what makes him a ""near-true"" monarch. Regarding the Crowns, a more popular theory (probably because it's Vaati's) is that each one is standing in for/is part of a Lord Soul, or part of its whole. e.g. The Sunken King's Crown has part of the Lord Soul of Death, The Old Iron King's Crown has part of the Lord Soul of Light, The Ivory King's Crown has part of the Lord Soul of Life, and Vendrick's Crown has part of the Lord Soul of Dark, corresponding perfectly with the King's locations and stories. This isn't to say they don't have anything to do with a Giant Lord soul, but I was sort of off-put by an entire section supposedly dedicated to their origins and not seeing any mention of this theory or any discrediting of it. In regards to the Kings and their timelines, I agree that they were all existent during the same era, though I've always been disturbed by the Old Iron King's purposeful designation as ""Old"". The only other living entities in the entire game designated as ""Old""  are Old Dragonslayer, Old Knights, the Old Chaos, and the NG+ ""Old"" Lord Souls. The latter two most certainly have reasoning to be designated as ""Old"", but the former two I feel like were relatively snug as being alive during the Old Iron King's era, and in turn Vendrick's era, especially considering the Dragonrider four feet away from the Old Dragonslayer. I have no trouble believing the Old Iron King being alive during Vendrick's reign, especially with Drangleic's symbol on the Alonne Captains, but then it becomes incredibly odd that he's designated as old when he clearly just...isn't. At least, in relevancy to the rest of Drangleic, and especially in relevancy to things like the Old Chaos and the Old Lord Souls. What's your take on that? Regarding the Drakeblood Knights, I think it's a bit of a ""shorthand note"" to write them off as a rebellious faction from Drangleic -- the shields they use are exclusively from the Blue Sentinels covenant, a covenant who just so happens to have a (...the only) titled Dragonslayer of their own, and their capes are a single dragon instead of Drangelic's signature double dragon that we're used to. This isn't to say they AREN'T from Drangleic or that they weren't some kind of rebel faction, but I think immediately writing them off as Drangleicians and rebellious ones no less is deceiving, especially for a lore write-up. I guess this note lacks punch if I'm not supplying my own theories, but I'm more interested in what your thoughts on them are specifically is the bottom line. I feel that Sinh existed before the Ancient Dragon, and may even be part of his origin, considering the Ancient Dragon is a fake and the Dragon Shrine has Shulva's giant painting in small-form. It could even be that the Drakeblood Knights were there for Vendrick upon his/Aldia's realization that Dragons may have some key in breaking the cycle, and took blood from Sinh for the conception of the Ancient Dragon. Trascendent Edde is summonable for Sinh, and he's a ""dragon"" knight from the Dragon Shrine. The transcendance spoken of in the ""Drakeblood Greatsword"" description,    ""Greatsword wielded by the Drakeblood Knights, led by the honorable Sir Yorgh. The insignia chiseled upon its hilt symbolizes dragon's blood. To the Drakeblood Knights, fresh dragon blood was sacrosanct. They believed that by obtaining it, they could achieve a true understanding of life, transcending their own banal existence.""   is almost eerily worded specifically so you make a connection between the ""transcendant"" shrine warriors and the Drakeblood Knights, which may speak for their political reasoning both for themselves and for Vendrick/Aldia/Drangleic in raiding Shulva. I disagree with your line of reasoning for the Ivory King's fall. I think the Ivory King fell specifically because he didn't want to show Alsanna his hollowing that she inevitably caused, as we have no reason to believe the Chaos was ever more powerful than it was at any point during the Ivory King's reign than it was at his reign's end, but we do have reason to believe due to her dialogue (specifically the line: ""Now I fear he may have known all along"") that it WAS because of her nature as an embodiment of dark that he was on a time limit of sorts and was essentially forced into the chaos for that reason, not because of any fear he held. I don't think the crowns had any kind of radiating effect whatsoever outside of the wearer. I don't think the crowns necessarily had a purposeful and long-lasting effect of immortality either, and if they did, it was only when they were originally forged and handed out. Once they were split up, said effect had to have dissipated to some degree, but I suppose I believe that mostly because of how I believe Vendrick and the Ivory King's stories unfolded and the ""A faint heat still lingers..."" text. Vendrick can only reimbue the Crowns when you bring him all of them, which I think is decently indicative that when apart they don't work -- at least not to their full potential. There's no indication this effect fails on a long enough timeline, either. I like very much your interpretation of how the Lord Souls were released, though I think such an effect was due to his forging of the crowns with their respective souls and the shattering of the Lordvessel (which in turn is in part due to my ""the crowns correlate to lord souls"" belief, which is by no means concrete!). This explains their presence in modern ""post-apocalyptic"" Drangleic, and their relatively political wielders (Pharros potentially being the Rotten, the Lost Sinner being an exiled priestess of Eleum Loyce, etc.)   Even if my opinions are largely different from yours, this was a very refreshing read and a good reminder of a lot of the lore gaps that are within Drangleic, so thank you for the write-up -- and again, I'm sorry if I make you repeat anything you've already said and if this was sub-par-ly written, I was constantly going inbetween writing this, reading your post, and going about my daily life. If I failed to clarify on anything, let me know."
DarkSouls2,3e00l1,affans117,3,Tue Jul 21 02:06:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the extensive feedback! I have been looking forward to having this kind of discussion.  I'll try to address your ideas one by one:   I thought about the giants themselves being the prize, but it seemed to be a very unsatisfying answer. The fact that the giants were taken was very, very explicit in the game and the references to the prize were so enigmatic, and, to me, this clashed. It really seemed like the prize was referring to something entirely distinct. Because of this, simply saying that the prize was the giants themselves seemed like too easy of an answer. This is a tough one since all references to this fact are ambiguous. All language referring to the reason why Vendrick did not link the flame are conditional/hypothetical, telling us that the decision hinged on something without every identifying what that something was. This really makes it a point open to interpretation. Additionally, within the confines of my theory at least, the why of the question is not of especially great importance as it does not really change anything. One of the main reasons why I lean towards Vendrick not being able to do it comes from my early theory (part I) that he was not a chosen undead and was thus incapable by very definition.  I really liked Vaati's theory, but, while poetic, it did not really answer the big question about the crowns (their power) and was also somewhat erroneous (in my opinion). This theory did not really explain why the crowns were able to stave off hollowing. Holding the complete lord souls does not prevent hollowing, so why would a collection of fragments achieve something so great? Additionally, this theory also incorporates the dark soul, but that soul was fragmented beyond measure, with its largest pieces literally walking about and acting on their own. Therefore, saying that Vendrick used the dark soul for his crown would be an impossibility.  I definitely agree with you here. There are some major contradictions between the way certain characters/things in the game are referred to and the time periods in which they lived (as pointed out by the evidence). I think that these are simply that, contradictions, which arose from the irregular development of the game. I would love for there to be a better answer here, but it is so irregular I just have not been able to find one. I would say that the Drakebloods are definitely from or at the very least related to Drangleic. I say this because Yorgh's ring bears the drangleic seal, they have blue-sentinel shields, a symbol which is also etched prominently in Drangleic castle in the chamber just before the looking glass knight, and the Achdrakes (survivors of the Drakebloods' attack) are in the shrine of amana looking for Vendrick to exact their revenge since the Drakebloods are no more and cant exact their revenge upon them (I talk about this in more detail in the post itself). I say that they are rebellious given that Drangleic and Shulva were allied. If they were not their actions do not make much sense.  While I agree that Sinh definitely pre-dates the Ancient Dragon, I do not think that Vendrick and Aldia used blood from Sinh to make the ancient dragon. First, the ancient dragon was a construct built from a giant's soul and petrified dragon bones (he drops these upon death). Also, it was based on the real ancient dragon whose corpse is located in Tseldora in the area where freja is fought (the two dragons are identical and the ancient dragon soul even refers to the 'prop' ancient dragon).  Like the 'why' of Vendrick's failure to re-kindle the fire, this point is one of pure speculation. In this case, I actually like yours a lot! It definitely fits with his selfless nature. I see the crowns working like this: they are forged and at full power, they are then handed out to the kings and their souls endow the crowns with the ability to radiate their effect, the kings fall and the crowns can no longer function (and the curse returns), over the many, many years that follow the crowns fade in power (this power fading to the 'faint heat' they have when we find them). The reason why Vendrick needs all of them together to renew this effect is that he does not have the same source material to imbue each with their original power, so he simply combines all four pieces of residual power to achieve the effect of one in its prime. This is, again, all up to interpretation, so my idea is really no greater than any other at the moment. Since I do not subscribe to the theory that the crowns hold the lord souls, this was really the only way I could explain their reemergence, but despite being somewhat of a cop out it did come out pretty satisfying and aligned with the established lore!   Thanks again for the amazing feedback. I am just about to leave for vacation so my responses are also a little rushed, so I hope they were enough.

I have Black Witch Veil (useful against Nashandra) Hexer Robes (dat fire resist) Mad Warrior Gauntlets (gotta have a little bit of defense) and Black Boots (decent magic resist) and the Steel Protection Ring +1 and 1 hit from Buffed Throne Defender only does ~1/6 of my health.   It's the hosts that rely on summons and are just awful really get to me.   It's like ""Really, you summoned me for this boss fight and the only thing you did was the killing blow""   Those guys really grind my gears. I don't mind if a caster hangs back, it's the ones with Vengarl's and Greatswords. I gotta do all the aggroing because they run off like mamby pambies when they get hit.

Especially in the Ruin Sentinels. That's why I spammed all my spells ASAP and ran at the boss with my Fire Longsword to try and finish it off quickly. It was annoying that Bellclaire and the Shade both managed to die while the two living Sentinels were both on 1/3 health, but I guess I'm just that pro that I can manage it /s"

A lot of people won't even bother venturing into NG+ since they can simply ascetic certain bosses to get the souls/rings they need.  1.4m SM is a very active SM tier, so don't worry about that.  Just try getting a little further on through the game and see if it's better elsewhere.  Alternatively, post on this sub to see if anybody want to partake in some Jolly Co-Op.  Remember as well, that if you summon a Sunbro to help you with a boss, you'll get a sunlight medal for that too!!"

DarkSouls2,3e2i6m,xinistrom,2,Tue Jul 21 14:47:59 2015 UTC,"You need the soldier key from defeating the last giant, which opens all but one door in the forest of fallen giants. As for the room upstairs from the cardinal tower bonfire you can actually knock it down by hitting it a few times, not sure what version you're playing but in SotFS there's a crystal lizard in there with some other early game equipment. There is also a door when you go down the ladder in the room with all the balistas, to open that walk up and attack it once and some hollows will open it from the inside, there's a life ring inside iirc.  edit: okay I finally realised which door you meant, that is actually a dead end"

Upgrade the flame to plus 10.  Upgrade ATT for more spell slots and/or wear the Southern Ritual band (+2 preferably).  OK, here's the little bit of technical stuff....  The softcap for fire damage is a combination of both your Faith stat and your Intelligence.  The combined figure must be 60 for you to hit the softcap, so 30/30 Fth/Int, or 50/10 Fth/Int etc...."

You might also be interested in grabbing the Penal Handcuffs (bought after killing the Lost Sinner) and the Fire Clutch ring (can be found in the Frozen Eleum Loyce DLC).  Don't forget to infuse your weapon with fire and grab the Flame Weapon Pyromancy from Straid (will need Old Witch Soul, which requires beating the Lost Sinner on a NG+ difficulty.  No need to enter a NG+ cycle, a bonfire ascetic will do the trick)."
DarkSouls2,3e2h4j,fromplsnerf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:55:19 2015 UTC,"Here's one of my favorite builds I've ever made  Its a SL 200 Charred Loyce Greatsword Pyromancer. Loads of fun.  I also made another one more recently that was primarily melee focused with some pyromancy thrown in for good measure.  SL 150 Bluemoon Greatsword Pyromancer  That build uses a Raw BMGS, Fire Zweihander, Fire Bandit Axe, Fire  Greatsword, ect. It hits really hard. The Bluemoon Greatsword especially is really powerful for its size and speed  Hope it gives you some idea of what kind of equipment/stats you can use."
DarkSouls2,3e2h4j,xinistrom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:39:11 2015 UTC,"I actually only recently finished a pyromancy build, here are the stats. It's a pure pyromancer aimed for PvP, it's okay for PvE but I would suggest more of a hybrid build because a lot of enemies actually have pretty high fire resistance, so you would probably have to summon for a few bosses."
DarkSouls2,3e2h4j,Bad-Selection,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:33:31 2015 UTC,"I ended up building a pyro/melee build that I seriously enjoy.  I'm not at home so I can't give you the stats.  Basically, I started as Cleric and leveled up mostly my faith to get the fire damage up.  As far as weapons go, the Fire Longsword never left my right hand once I picked it up.  You can get it after the Last Gaint by turning around from the second bonfire and dropping onto the scaffolding.  The Chaos Rapier is also a fantastic weapon for fire damage and you can get it pretty early from Felkin.  Both weapons can take you through the whole game if you upgrade them to +10 and +5 respectively and are light weight.  Fire Longsword requires a small investment into STR and DEX.  Chaos Rapier requires a heavier stat investment, but a lot of that investment boosts your fire damage too.  Both are light weight so you can keep VIT pretty low.    Use whatever armor you want.  I recommend Penal Handcuffs to boost your pyro damage and Hexer's Hood to give yourself at least one extra cast of each spell.  Southern ritual band is a must.  And use the regular pyro flame that's in the chest in the room after the Flexile Sentry."
DarkSouls2,3e2h4j,JohnCJdrak,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:52:10 2015 UTC,"Personally, I found going all Pyro to be inconvenient in for example Fight Clubs. I went with a Dex\Str Estoc build.

DarkSouls2,3dyd2e,SpinningShit,3,Tue Jul 21 00:33:19 2015 UTC,"Man, that Woshige moment was fucking painful to watch live.  I was someone who was rooting for Woshige as soon as I learned that he was attending EVO, because he was basically the best chance any player had for really defeating Ogawa.   Nage might have gotten to Grand Finals against Ogawa, but he clearly was having a hard time against him. His victories were much less convincing than Woshige's earlier during this embarrassing ""premature ejaculation"" moment."
DarkSouls2,3dyd2e,PraiseTheCasulSun,8,Mon Jul 20 22:51:13 2015 UTC,One bucket of context please.That would be very nice.
DarkSouls2,3dyd2e,krazytennis98,8,Mon Jul 20 17:44:46 2015 UTC,"The video that /u/GreenToast made is a parody of an extremely, extremely embarrassing event that occurred during the very recent Evolution 2015 fighting game tournament that took place from July 17-20.  Here's the original event itself, in all of its cringeworthiness: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrdczTmhtIo  What you saw there took place during the Top 8 matches of Guilty Gear Xrd -SIGN- at Evolution 2015. Woshige, the guy in red, left his seat and celebrated after thinking that he beat longtime Guilty Gear series champion Ogawa. He thought that his victory meant the match was over. He forgot that he only won one round and that there was still one more round to go. So while he was prematurely celebrating, Ogawa took advantage of Woshige's unmanned character and destroyed it. When Woshige horrifyingly realized that he still had a round to go, it was already too late.   For me, and for a lot of people, it was heartbreaking, because Woshige was basically the only player in that Top 8 that was on equal footing with Ogawa, who has been winning Guilty Gear tournaments for years. When Woshige fought Ogawa during the second match of the Top 8, it was a very convincing performance. Lots of back and forth domination. Lots of very close rounds. But then that premature pop-off happened. And Woshige got sent to the losers bracket of the tournament.  It is a testament to Woshige's amazing skill that he managed to fight his way all the way to the losers bracket finals before losing to Nage, who went on to Grand Finals. So Woshige, despite this extremely embarrassing moment that is sure to haunt him for the rest of his life, still had the mental composure to make it to third place in the tournament.  In the days leading up to Evolution 2015, I learned that Woshige was one of the many Japanese top Guilty Gear players who were going to come to the USA and participate in Evolution 2015. This got me hyped, as Woshige is not only one of the most gifted players in the Guilty Gear community, he was also the best Millia Rage player in the world, and Ogawa's longtime character, Zato-1, is very allergic to Millia Rage matchups.  So I figured that he was going to have the best chance at beating Ogawa when he came to Evolution 2015. And to some extent, it indeed did look like he could have sent Ogawa to the tournament's losers bracket (See this link for the full match between Ogawa and Woshige: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdhSfGVv2NM).   Nage, the player who managed to beat Woshige and got to grand finals against Ogawa, fought hard, but looked like he was having a very hard time against Ogawa, much more so than during the original match between Woshige and Ogawa. (See this link for the grand finals match: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cU-MgE_ts)  If you want to see just how utterly amazing Woshige is, check out this video of him fighting against fellow Millia Rage specialist Nakamura during the losers semifinals match of that same tournament. It's really worth watching the entire 10-minute match, but if you don't have time, skip ahead to 6:50 to see the last match. It is one hell of a nail-bitingly close and intense match.

DarkSouls2,3dyw0x,Stalking_Panda,3,Mon Jul 20 19:13:46 2015 UTC,I dunno it could be prefrence. For me it was much easier to judge the swings during phase one because I hugged his left knee and strafed around him to avoid his offhand sword so I never had to deal with it really. Judging the distance and swing times was way harder for me in phase two because of all the glowing stuff on the sword. Plus at SL1 if the fire even touches you slightly you die.

Second one is to ""farm"" human effigies in the Majula basement. For each one you burn, an additional skeleton spawns. I usually finish my first playthrough with Majula at least at an 6-7 intensity.

I've become good at dodging him but I still wouldn't dare parrying him, honestly.   Tip for dodging : circle to the right. When he does his charge attack, you don't even have to dodge if you're circling as he will pass you and swing on his right side, where you're not. Also at first never deal more than 1 blow at a time : hit, dodge, hit, dodge."

DarkSouls2,3e0pzk,OblivionSol,3,Tue Jul 21 02:10:26 2015 UTC,"Dude, don't even worry about parrying him.  I am going through a first time playthrough and the Pursuer killed me dozens of times.   The advice to use the ballistas is crap.  To make him stand still in the right spot long enough to let you activate the ballistas, you basically have to learn to parry him, which is too tough for a new player. Just focus on dodging him. The advice to always strafe around him to the right is good advice. Never get greedy.  If you're stafing to the right around him after he attacks, hit him once then back off. If you stay at medium range, I found you can usually bait him into doing his forward rush attack, which is easily dodged by rolling to the right.  You know he will do this attack when he hunkers down a bit and shifts his shield to in front of himself.  Learn to dodge that and you will be golden. There is enough time to get a hit in after his three slash combos and his forward rush attack.  This also means there is enough time to heal. Don't give up! and good luck!"
DarkSouls2,3e0pzk,OblivionSol,2,Tue Jul 21 14:00:19 2015 UTC,Find a buckler somewhere near the second bonfire and equip it at the offhand then use the offhand strong attack at the right timing to do a parry

DarkSouls2,3e0pzk,TheShallowCore,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:26:12 2015 UTC,"I've not successfully parried him yet, but that's going to be my tactic if I don't beat him in his first appearance. As for now, I'm just Shading hmi over and over as a DPS Rogue to get quick Souls. That 17k so nice.  Anyway, parrying is about practise and comfort with your tools, from what I can gather. Don't switch between two tools, or you'll fuck up. A lot of people prefer parrying shields like the Buckler, which has to be activated very early but has a very long parry window. Others might prefer fist,s which has ve a long startup and almost no parry window, or a 2h sword, which has similar. Right now I'm stuck in a predicament in that I'm switching between a Scimitar (curved swords have very little startup but a smaller window in which to parry) and the buckler (longer startup but more parrying time)."

DarkSouls2,3e0pzk,jakman556,3,Tue Jul 21 01:50:27 2015 UTC,"My advice is to learn how to dodge first. Only when you are consistent in your dodges you can poke him for a few strikes. Most important lesson you learn here, is not to be greedy. Get 1-2 strikes in, then move out of his way.  A lot of people talk about parrying him, while this is considered a good tactic, it is also very hard for new players, but very easy once you know how to do it. My favorite weapon against him is a pokey weapon like a rapier, with that you are able to keep a good distance and do some fast attacks that still does decent damage to him. I played the game for +300 hours before I decided to ""learn"" how to actually parry him, it took me roughly 3 hours to be somewhat consistent about it. In those 3 hours I didn't try to hurt him, just to practice dodge and parry. You tend to forget to pay attention to movesets and attack patterns if you are new to the game and trying to do it all at the same time. He is very predictable once you pay attention to the way he actually fights. For instance, he will always do his charge attack if you make enough distance from him. I'm in my helpful corner today, so I made a quick video on how I tackle the pursuer with a rapier - not completely without faults though D:  https://youtu.be/sHDAretc080  Hope it helps :)"
DarkSouls2,3e0pzk,deadbubble,2,Tue Jul 21 11:26:36 2015 UTC,"Easiest way to beat the pursuer is to summon someone to help you. To do that, post your platform and soul memory here, and someone will help you.  Easiest way to beat the Pursuer by yourself is to bait his long-range charge attack and then roll through it. To do that, back away from him. You will see him point his sword at you and lean forward. Start running towards him. He will charge at you. When you get near him, roll straight forward passing him to your right. Then follow him and hit him once. Repeat until he's dead. Use a weapon that does strike damage, like a mace. This works even with very low agility."
DarkSouls2,3e0pzk,wavygonzonose,2,Tue Jul 21 03:34:56 2015 UTC,"A little note, too - sometimes people, as I am right now like to farm The Pursuer as a Shade. They'll put down a Small Soapstone either in the bonfire nearby or right by the ladder (my preference, it makes the intent more clear), and in exchange for the help, they get 17,000 souls. For whatever reason, the first appearance of The Pursuer gives everyone 100% of the drop, so there's that incentive, and in exchange, chances are you're getting someone who has founght him a few times and knows his moves around, so you can learn from their actions.   I'm actually tempted to give up on Smallstoning and go for full-on Sunbro Style (I'm in the Covenant of the Meek, would it be SunBlue?).  Additionally, I find dodging to the enemy's right, your left (through their weapon) feels better, though that may only be for fellow Lefties."

DarkSouls2,3e0pzk,Exiledtyrant,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:09:29 2015 UTC,"Your soul memory is your total accumulated souls that you have gained on that character. It's basically to help with match making so that you are matched with people who have played the game for roughly the same length of time as you. To see your soul memory, go to your stat screen and it is the number in the top right corner. Strike damage is a damage type in the game, along with thrust, slash etc. Maces and such use strike damage because they are blunt, but you can tell what damage type a weapon is when you view it in your equipment screen. Strike damage is useful for basically most of the game because it is more effective against armoured enemies, such as the Pursuer."
DarkSouls2,3e0pzk,Thalnagath,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:23:45 2015 UTC,"Your soul memory is the total number of souls you have consumed since character creation.

DarkSouls2,3e0pzk,TheTweets,2,Tue Jul 21 15:12:37 2015 UTC,"Hang around the fog gate in human form for a while and summon a few bros to lend you a hand, just don't shoot them with the ballista! (aka my first encounter with the pursuer)  If it's dead hours and you reckon you can take him on solo (totally doable) best advice I can give you is learn to identify his three main attack moves which are his charge attack, overhead swing (two consecutive slashes then a slow third slash which he will jump in the air for) and shield bash. Just watch out for when his sword glows blue because it means he intends to impale and curse you!  I know this seems shitty advice for a new player but Dark Souls isn't a game that will just hand you victory you have to seize it the undead way (dying a lot and adapting). The hardest part of this and most fights are timing your dodges and not overusing your stamina. If you can teach yourself that you pretty much have (almost) everything you need to blaze through. Good luck!"
DarkSouls2,3e0pzk,Tarcanus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:42:17 2015 UTC,"I too found the Pursuer incredibly difficult. You have to master dodging and/or parrying to succeed. Try rolling to his left. His dash attack is also easy to parry. If you found the buckler, using that will make parrying easier."
DarkSouls2,3e0pzk,TheTweets,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:18:51 2015 UTC,"Draw him to the middle of the room then sprint to, and fire the ballista directly ahead. If you get lucky it will do a ton of damage. He is also fairly easy to parry. I just killed him 30 minutes ago with the ballista method."
DarkSouls2,3e0pzk,Thalnagath,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:27:20 2015 UTC,I just ignore him until later and take the other route to the Lost Bastille (Dragonrider and Flexile Sentry are far easier fights).
DarkSouls2,3e0pzk,TheTweets,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:32:54 2015 UTC,"I only beat the game using dodges so i don't know how you would do it with armor or  a shield, but if you can get your adaptability up and enough stamina or stamina regen to do three dodges he should be pretty easy. I would bait his charge attack during the first half and then during the second half of his health hug and dodge toward his sword( have to delay it for blue sword unless you run away). He seems more prone to use his dark attack when he is low health so hugging him towards the end helps a lot."

Does massive damage and kills him in 2 hits, which you can do just by spamming the ballista if he's positioned right.  The trick to parrying him is getting some distance and when he puts his sword to the side and flies at you, you hit that parry JUST before he reaches you. The parry should stun him long enough to get to a ballista.   Or you can just parry and wail on him till he dies, but that takes a while."
DarkSouls2,3e0pzk,Count_Scrotulus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:09:48 2015 UTC,The pursuer is rough. He will be the first true test of your skills. I had success sticking to his shield side and dodging most of his attacks. Never stay still. If you cant beat him at the lvl you're at then make your way to hiedes tower and practice fighting some of the large enemies there.
DarkSouls2,3e0pzk,dks3hypeoverload,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:31:38 2015 UTC,"If you still need help, I always stay close to him and circle to the right. If you do that there is only 1 attack that you need to dodge (the three hit combo). All other attack you can just circle to your right. After each of his attacks get in 1 or 2 hits and stay close. When he does his hex attack get behind him (which is easy if you stay close) and wail at him.  Alternatively you can very easily parry his charging attack and punish him like that. If you stay far away he will do that attack more.  Finally heal only just after he finished an attack / combo (instead of attacking).  I also had a lot of trouble beating him on my first playthrough and ended up cheesing him with the balistas and a sunbro. The sunbro kept him dancing in front of the balistas and I shot him."
DarkSouls2,3e0pzk,elementalwalruss,2,Tue Jul 21 05:09:52 2015 UTC,Trying to heal vs Pursuer will just get you killed.  He recovers too quickly and attacks too quickly to have much of a safe time to heal.  The only way you can heal safely is by parrying him and then using the stun time to heal instead of attack.
DarkSouls2,3e0pzk,vmoppy,3,Tue Jul 21 05:32:42 2015 UTC,"I disagree, I can heal after pretty much any attack/combo and have time to dodge the next one (trust me I tried to heal a lot against this guy). But its a tight window."

DarkSouls2,3e0x2i,Voidtalon,2,Tue Jul 21 05:08:15 2015 UTC,"eh happens. I don't mind scummy players. Makes for funny commentary especially when they disconnect. However, facing that same person over and over is no video worthy content. It's the same routine over and over.  I figured I would not get through this series without seeing some bottom feeders. The best last guy that was also in the lost recording had such high lag that I was forced for flame-breath him down 350hp at a time. The next time I faced him and breathed... he ran away and BC'd. That recording though had to be trashed because I was silly and not only left my fan on but also forgot to put on a shirt (it was 97 degrees in my recording room)."
DarkSouls2,3e0x2i,WhiteZinogre,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:56:35 2015 UTC,I recently took to finishing people off with the flame breath when htey are low on hp. It is a lot of fun.

I usually despise hackers with their infinite  health,one shot kill,curse player,break equipment etc,but these dude's had some cool things that they were doing.  Hacker 1:- Dragonbro armour with a golden rank 2/3 aura instead of a red aura. However that aura became red when he was attacking and turned blue when he was rolling. Slightly varied moveset of weapons and spells but supremely low health. Managed to kill him. Really enjoyed the fight to be honest.  Hacker 2:- This guy was cosplaying as a hollow aragorn for LOTR. His name was ""False king of xyz"". xyz= I don't remember that part. He was hollow wearing a crown and throne watcher armour. He had 3 times the normal player speed, insane hacked moveset like throwing knives that exploded like flame swathe when it hit, retainer's short sword 2 handed r2 which did the dark AOE attack which the rotten does. bone fist r2 which sent out the moonlight greatsword R2 magic. but again, had very low health. Fought him 2-3 times. We both died the first time. Other 2 times,he narrowly managed to survive.  Cool fights :D  Imgur  Imgur"

Sorcery is fun and is primarily offensive, Pyromancy is fun but casts are low and a lot of enemies are more resistant to fire than the other elements, dark requires a lot of stat investment because it requires both int and faith. It is very similar to sorcery. Faith is very fun IMO but it's taken on more of a support/buff role since the number of offensive casts was nerfed a few months after release.  I prefer Faith, but like I said, try whatever you want...if you don't like it, simply respec with a soul vessel"

DarkSouls2,3e285z,Psychocandy42,-1,Tue Jul 21 12:02:15 2015 UTC,"There you go. ;)  As for your other post: I'm a little higher in SL, but the SM is totally against me: this is my first char and the latter is screwed and very high. I don't think, absolutely, to have been in advantage. Correct me if I'm mistaken."
DarkSouls2,3e285z,Psychocandy42,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:27:31 2015 UTC,"PvP is not unpopulated at higher levels, not by a long stretch.   Is it boring? Yes and no.   Yes it's boring to see everyone being able to do everything all at once, with a nice serving of sky-high resistances that can completely shut you off if you're not on par with your SL. It's boring because there's a counter for everything, and if you're up against a SL400 you can be damn sure that he'll do his best to pull the trick out of his hat and give you a hard time.   No it ain't boring because of the same reason: the ""Swiss army knife"" mentality means you rarely see the same setup twice in a row, because everyone's trying everything at once and you never know what they're about to pull out. This can be fun, when it isn't frustrating.  All that said, the investment you need to put into making a high lvl character (don't give me that ""farm Giant Lord with ascetics"" crap, to me wasting two hours grinding the same boss is an investment and a pretty heavy one at that) is simply not fun enough for me. Whenever I do a high SM PvP character I just shoot for SL150 (and then SL200 once I reach the higher tiers) and stop there, because I don't feel the need to go higher. This means I lose a lot because I get three-shot a lot. It's still plenty of fun and it's certainly sort of challenging.   I just don't think it's the best place to stop if you wanna have fun with PvP in the long run."
DarkSouls2,3e285z,Earlycrowd,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:02:39 2015 UTC,"In fact I'm 260-ish because I did, with my first char ever and with a huge SM loss, do NG, NG+ and am continuing to play with it.  There is no ""trying hard"", also because at this point I don't even feel the need to level further, since I can equip everything I wanted to try efficiently. These are the only points of the character -which I repeat, is my first EVER in Dark Souls 2, I'm showing.  Edit: I'd wish to add that I think I'm on a thin line now with this char....I am at the ""Swiss Army Knife"" point that you talk of (with limitations: I will never be dexterity based or a hexer, because I simply cannot, except minimal PVE needs), a point I don't wish to go beyond. Else it would be abusing....like low level agape twinks continuously abuse noob characters ... ;)"
DarkSouls2,3e285z,JohnGCole,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:07:36 2015 UTC,"In fact I'm 260-ish because I did, with my first char ever and with a huge SM loss, do NG, NG+ and am continuing to play with it.   Personally I am in favor of this. It's your first playthrough, you're doing stuff that is new to you, you're still getting the hang of the game.   Don't limit yourself if you're having fun. The need to stop at a certain SL because after a while overlevelling is no longer fun will arise in due time.   Trust me, my very first character (back on PS3, more than a year ago) went up to SL400 or something, I had a blast for a while, then I made a new character, reached SL80 and... I thought «well, that's it, what more do I need?».   Then you start chiseling your build, you put a point in STR because you need to use that weapon, you raise your END cause you want more stamina, you pour some points into ATN because you need Warmth to counter ganks... and one day you'll wake up at SL120 and think «well, that's it, what more do I need?».   Trust me, once you know what you want to do with your character, SL150 is almost a luxury. No need to force this meta upon yourself just because people say you should. Level up, have fun and see how the game changes for you is what I'm saying. You don't need to adhere to no meta if it ain't fun. We play games for fun. One day, possibly, or possibly not, you'll find the SL150 meta to be more fun than being high SL. Or maybe you'll discover the joys of SL838 PvP and never come back. Who knows!"
DarkSouls2,3e285z,OZKV4zrKKqAG,0,Tue Jul 21 13:20:00 2015 UTC,"I agree totally.   I have reached the point you say :)  What I wished to show is that I was able to have 20 minutes normal pvp at the iron bridge, with diversified opponents without sticking to a meta.  I have another character stuck at level 95 that I'm not leveling beause it is proceeding smoothly all the same, on the contrary!"
DarkSouls2,3e285z,OZKV4zrKKqAG,-3,Tue Jul 21 13:24:18 2015 UTC,I will serve OP.   High level builds cannot be same nor different  Because once you have high level you no longer have a build.  Dinner is serve'd.  edit1. Oh and forgot to mention that what if everyone he fights with are 150 meta since matchmaking isn't really based on SL? Op pls...
DarkSouls2,3e285z,Earlycrowd,2,Tue Jul 21 12:02:16 2015 UTC,"I'd say that builds exist until SL200, if only to ensure a bit of variety and non-Flynnitude. Also, even if there's no real ""builds"" with ""disadvanteges"", fighting someone who can do everything is a different kind of challenge, meaning you have to be ready to counter, well, everything."
DarkSouls2,3e285z,Psychocandy42,0,Tue Jul 21 12:08:33 2015 UTC,"You could increase 3 stats to 99, be such high a level and still have a ""build""."
DarkSouls2,3e285z,Psychocandy42,3,Tue Jul 21 12:32:45 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Raising all stats by 30 is 180 levels. That's a ""build"" too. Everything is a build, I really am sick of these arrogant ""rules"" people must be bashed for; as if people like me were cheating! Damn, I just played the game as the developers intended, I truly don't understand the continuous subtle hostility and downvoting of some people here due to this very same recurring matter. I posted a video to show something different. Whoever does not like the difference can simply limit himself to meta 150 related stuff. Why don't you (or we all) open /r/DarkSoulsMeta150 ? It would have more sense."
DarkSouls2,3e285z,Earlycrowd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:43:59 2015 UTC,"Well finding a common place, as in level (range), does make sense for the sake of proper pvp activity. That's probably been the original idea behind it. But as with pretty much anything, ideas get twisted and/or forgotten over generations. This ""150 or boo"" is just that; people who don't grasp the idea behind (anymore) it or simply take it too seriously.  I totally agree on ""builds"" existing up until max level because in a fight it matters what you actually use - weaponry, magic, armor, items. I could go to SL600 and still only use a Greatsword and an offhand Poison Rapier. I'd do that, because that's my favourite combination ^"
DarkSouls2,3e285z,Earlycrowd,0,Tue Jul 21 14:00:26 2015 UTC,"Again. That's the point, that's what I mean to say."
DarkSouls2,3e285z,Voidtalon,0,Tue Jul 21 14:03:39 2015 UTC,"So having 99 vig 99 end and 99 vit 99 attunement 99 adp sounds like fun times to you? because there is not many good reasons to 99 str, dex, int, fth. Basically you make a ""build"" that is easier to use.   Sure, you can call it a build. I dont. I call it waste of time. Takes 2 hours to make 150 meta. Takes way more to farm souls for sl 300 pro ""build""."
DarkSouls2,3dzd2x,GhostConstruct,9,Mon Jul 20 19:33:11 2015 UTC,"For PvE it's probably the most reliable and best damage source against slow/big bosses. At least until you get Great Chaos Fireball, which is either NG++ or Red arena rank 3 (kind of obvious nobody uses this). FS is farmable as well which is great.  For PvP it's basically impossible to hit anybody unless you're great at free aiming or comboing it."

DarkSouls2,3e16v3,ActThree,3,Tue Jul 21 04:09:27 2015 UTC,"I'd say ~5 million. You can cast your sign (Red) down to 2,750,000 and up to 30,000,000 which means you'll see people ~SL 175 to SL 300. This is a great range and you can be SL 200 which opens up some really comfortable builds.  By the same Virtue though SL 250 ~12 Million goes down to 7,000,000 and up to 999,999,999. If you use the Dragon Eye you get wider ranges.  Do note: The Blood/Blue Arenas look by SL for ~60 seconds before opening up to ANY player. So if you want fast matches you should be SL 150, SL 200 or SL 250 beyond that and you're just going to get open-matching."

That's with red soapstone of course. That's 5 down, 2 up. For CREO invasions is only up 4 tiers so if your tier 36 u can invade up to tier 40 - 12,000,000-14,999,999."

My first priority was getting 4 or 5 estus flasks, and then I headed for the keep for the dull ember, and access to large titanite shards.   I've been 2 handing the broadsword, and a club, and they've been tearing through the game. I'm not doing that much less damage than a quality SL80 build with a Longsword. You can also get them both almost immediately.   Infusion wise I think raw is probably the best bet, I am however curious if mundane would be something worth looking into."

You can only summon and be summoned by players within a certain SM of you. Here's a chart of who you can connect to based on SM. Also if you see an orange border around a bonfire you can warp to, that supposedly means there's activity there within your current SM range.   You can't reduce your SM but there is a ring that stops it from increasing at the cost of not being able to collect souls."

DarkSouls2,3dzuxv,theamazingroberto,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:05:58 2015 UTC,you can. you can even use the npc masterless glencour for dragonrider and then sit at the bonfire and summon him again for dragonslayer.
DarkSouls2,3dzuxv,theamazingroberto,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:58:54 2015 UTC,your level is meaningless. ds1 had matchmaking by level but ds2 calculates it solely (heh) on your soul memory. a guy that's level 120 can potentially be in the same tier as a guy who's only level 50 if he spent tbe majority of his souls on consumables or equipment upgrades.

It seems like far too much trouble to go to for some dragon chunks, and with the way there's not normally any Dragon signs around FoFG, I'd assume most are too scared to challenge him, myself included. Those that aren't would either be a really good fight, in that they're experienced, or they're people that have no clue what's going on, which would be a pretty boring fight."

Boss soul weapons are upgraded with a different item called petrified dragon bone, so once he gets his 30 scales he will probably move elsewhere. Unless he wants low level PvP specifically. You can't summon a dragonbro if you have other phantoms in your world, so he's guaranteed to never run into ganks.

My favourite appraoch used to be NG+7 Doors of Farros... I'd let them get to the final platform unopposed, and if they have successfully managed to defeat make it there (no mean feat), then they have earned the right to fight me in a fair 1v1 duel.

People who stop at 150-200 do it for PVP. 150 is the most commonly agreed meta-level for the game but even that isn't as popular as you'd imagine.

I recommend getting scholar of the first sin because it's a better version of the game and includes all the dlc. One more piece of advice, don't do a jack of all trades build. Pick a primary stat and stick to it (int, strength, dex, faith), if you don't like it you can reroll your stats later on the game. Good luck, have fun, and be prepared to die many many times!"

DarkSouls2,3dz18t,Wintergreen762,2,Mon Jul 20 21:12:21 2015 UTC,Yep that's about par for the course. The most important thing is to not get discouraged when you run into a tough spot.

Any tip you receive (which I'm sure some white knight bastard will give you) will always have an impact on your game, no matter how small the advice.

The better armed ones also carried a long sword to slash down with for close quarter fighting. The wealthier knights wore chain mail with padding underneath while the poorer just wore padded jackets. They also carried a large wooden kite shield and a conical helmet with a nasal guard.

DarkSouls2,3e0cyg,MegaMeepMan,2,Mon Jul 20 23:58:09 2015 UTC,Probably best to just go 40/40 STR/DEX and leave it uninfused.
DarkSouls2,3e0cyg,Ansarricade,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:06:01 2015 UTC,"It's really not, you save a huge amount of levels by doing base req and infusing and the damage is about the same."
DarkSouls2,3e0cyg,SIrFredds,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:45:15 2015 UTC,"I think its best infused if you are doing spellsword build  If not,quality build is better"
DarkSouls2,3e0cyg,OblivionSol,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:07:24 2015 UTC,"Base stats and infusing is by far the most efficient way to use it, damage output will be about the same as on a 40/40 uninfused, and you'll also save 47 levels by going with base requirements."
DarkSouls2,3e0cyg,SIrFredds,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:15:09 2015 UTC,"Claymore +10 has a physical base damage of 290 [which is pretty good] and a counter strength of 110 [not too good]. It has a 50% scaling in StrBns and 25% scaling in DexBns. This means a Quality build 40/40 is very effective, but it is more effective to prioritize Str than Dex. I would suggest a 44/36 uninfused, 25/13 for a raw infusion, or 27/13/20/20 for a dark infusion."
DarkSouls2,3e0cyg,TheIntelligentManate,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:44:08 2015 UTC,"44/36 will give you 1 less ar than 40/40. If you're infusing, raw or elemental, it's never really worth going over base requirements. Elemental infusions works well even without leveling int/fth."

DarkSouls2,3e0cj3,--Delta--,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:08:00 2015 UTC,"I use the Elgato HD (https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/gamecapture-hd)  The whole system consists of the Game Capture Unit (roughly the size of a thick iPod), a USB cable, an HDMI cable, and a free downloadable Game Capture HD program for your CPU.   Plug the USB cable into the Game Capture Unit (GCU) and the other end into a USB port on your CPU. Remove the HD cable connected from the TV to your 360 (from the 360 port) and plug it into the HDMI Out on the GCU. Plug the provided HDMI cable from the GCU's HDMI In port to the port you just unplugged the HDMI from on your 360. Open the Game Capture HD program and record, stream, and post away.    There are many different setting to mess with and while this is the older version it does record in 1080, just not 'true 1080'. The newer version has 60fps and true 1080 recording.

DarkSouls2,3dz8wc,Stalking_Panda,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:08:33 2015 UTC,Old Knight Ultra Greatsword. From Heidi's Tower of Flame dropped by an old knight. Oops and I was wrong on the dex requirement. It requires 10 dex. The invader almost looked like Havel. He had a greatsword (im not sure which one) and a parry shield maybe roughly the size of the first leather one you pick up in forest of the fallen giants. I was in the Lost Bastille if that helps
DarkSouls2,3dz8wc,Multipwner,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:38:15 2015 UTC,"There's your problem then, old kight ultra great sword is an ultra great sword class weapon.

DarkSouls2,3dyiq4,Ansatsu_Kokoro,3,Tue Jul 21 03:49:18 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure Ansatsu merely means to say that for your first experience you'll enjoy the game much much more by doing it yourself rather than making it a Dark Souls tour by having many helping hands during your initial progress aka trivialising the content it has to offer.  Certainly meeting people and playing together is wonderful, but I must agree that going thru all the area's and bossfights solo will make you truly feel what Dark Souls is all about.  Consider it though: this game is good. The experience is great when you face the challenges alone and have to think about your approach, your equipment choices, what to spend your souls on when levelling up.  In short, you'd be getting a sense of fulfilment by doing the firstplaythrough alone you will never be able to get again.  Think about it, don't feel forced to do it, obviously play the way you enjoy it but just be aware that doing playthrough 2 alone will have you start off with knowledge of the area's, boss mechanics and such. I'd be a damn shame in my opinion, but to each his own."
DarkSouls2,3dyiq4,Count_Scrotulus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:46:46 2015 UTC,"Eh, I feel like co-op is just as valid. The rush you get from taking a boss down solo, for me, is just as good as the rush from sunbroing it up and helping someone else take the fight down too.  Different people have different motivations for playing games. For some, playing with friends is more enjoyable than playing alone-- and games at their core are about enjoyment.   to each his own.   This is the entire point I've been making."
DarkSouls2,3dzjou,xXAnonymousEnigmaXx,4,Mon Jul 20 20:20:08 2015 UTC,"Just be observant. Make a checklist if you need to. What's dead, what isn't dead. What's been opened, and what's been untouched. If you go back to a room and see that something that used to be alive is now dead, then go in that direction. Soon enough, you'll find your mark."
DarkSouls2,3dzjou,Kakoriko,4,Mon Jul 20 20:22:57 2015 UTC,"The best advice. Gets a lot easier when you know the areas. If nothing is dead and he's not visible, he might be chameleon'd. If everything is dead and he's not visible, even at the boss fog, and you've been looking for 3 minutes or so -- probably BC out unless you REALLY wanna play hide and seek. Let'em make their ""funny epic"" chameleon video."
DarkSouls2,3dzjou,ninthbelief,2,Mon Jul 20 20:48:32 2015 UTC,"Recommend not keeping your camera static, check every corner, over your shoulder. Be familiar with the terrain (incase of chameleon usage). The route/direction you choose to search in is pretty much determined from where you spawn in. Like Kako said, spot whats alive/dead, are enemies facing different directions (indicating the host may have just sprinted right by everything). If all else fail, go hang out near by the boss room door, that is technically their final destination. Though 9/10 they just retreat to the bonfires because ""don't wanna lose souls"""
DarkSouls2,3dzjou,Ansatsu_Kokoro,2,Mon Jul 20 20:40:54 2015 UTC,"Here's a protip: you do not see the host's health bar when he's walking or standing still but if you pan your camera real fast and the host is close enough, his health bar will show up for a fraction of a second, letting you know in which general direction he is."

DarkSouls2,3dzjou,RandomStrategy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:23:03 2015 UTC,"If you're a Protector Sentinel, you get a pointer to where the invader is. If you're being invaded or are invading, it's all about reading the map - I spent 10 minutes waiting for my invader to find me in Huntsman's Copse the other day, and I wasn't exactly hiding - I was on the roof of the building near the start, with all the doors to it open and all enemies on that side on the map dead, with none of the enemies past the bridge bonfire killed. I decided to wait there because I felt it was a favourable location - he could only approach from one direction without going across the map into areas I haven't been to (the whip guy falls onto a rope bridge, but I have no clue how to get there), and I could beat a retreat by falling off the building if I felt I needed to relocate. Unfortunately, he killed the first Bluebro that came in to help me, and while I feel bad about that, I wasn't going to go searching for him and risk dying, wasting the time of myself and the two Bluebros that came to my aid (not at the same time). Instead, I got to watch a bar on the side of my screen as it got to about 1/3 full before being awarded a Human Effigy and being able to go about my business.  Also bear in mind that while you glow red, and Bluebros glow blue, the host will usually have a black or brown clothing on, which, in areas like Huntsman's Copse, can make you overlook them.  Blues Brothers, the both of you, if you're reading this, thanks for the help, I just wish the invader had had the presence of mind to come to me, so I could have given you a hand, rather than letting one of you die to him, wasting the Humanity you gathered to get to my aid."
DarkSouls2,3dzjou,TheTweets,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:56:55 2015 UTC,"Picking your staging ground is absolutely key when handling an invasion. Whether or not the red finds you depends on how good they are at tracking (the context clues of dead enemies, broken objects, etc).  Sometimes they'll get impatient and message you like you're hiding, when in actuality they're just not very good at searching (or are lazy). You can either tell them where you are, tell them to get off their ass and not divulge your location, or maintain radio silence.  They're the ones with agency. You do you. It's also fun to eat a Giants Seed and let them clear out some enemies for you during their search. The enemies might even dispatch the invader for you (cough Dragon Shrine cough cough Shrine of Amana cough King's Gate bonfire cough cough cough, oof, got a real frog in my throat!).  cc op: /u/xXAnonymousEnigmaXx"

Chances are it isn't bad enough for you to fail, but if you focus on it, that's when you will end up doing something that fails you.

DarkSouls2,3dxzrv,Mystoic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:56:27 2015 UTC,"Really well thought out, I like it.  I'd like to add my relatively similar theory here. I think that all Souls came from the First Flame, as you suggested. Hollows found these Souls, and thise that found the most powerful Souls became Gods, with the most powerful of these being Lords. Those that found weaker Souls were granted bits of the Dark Soul by the Pygmy, and they became Human.  I'm not sure where other creatures, like dogs and rats come into play though. The DkS1 Giants are also a mystery. I think the Giants are not the same as the Gods; the Giants are just their servants and basic soldiers.  I also don't think the Dark is opposed to the Flame. It depends on the Flame to exist. It's like a shadow; it grows as the Flame dies, but once the Flame is extinguished completely there is no more shadow. Light and Dark are both just aspects of Flame, as are Life and Death. Those aspects are represented by the Lord Souls.  I agree that there can be no Age of Dark. When the Flame dies, the Dark dies with it. A world without Flame is basically exactly what the Age of Ancients was."
DarkSouls2,3dxzrv,Shroom_Soul,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:04:33 2015 UTC,"My thoughts on it are that the DkS1 Giants are those who were granted a portion of Gwyn's Lord Soul, much like the Furtive Pygmy shared the Dark Soul amongst the humans. The difference being that Gwyn gave far fewer portions, and thus kept the majority of the power for himself.  What I want to see is what exactly happened to the Furtive Pygmy in all the time since he found the Dark Soul. I've heard some theories that he became the Darklurker, but I hope we get a bit more of a concrete answer in DkS3"
DarkSouls2,3dxzrv,Junkshop23,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:10:10 2015 UTC,"I don't think you get what I mean by ""Giants"".  Giants are the big, lumbering humanoids in DkS1. The Sen's guys, the Anor Londo sentinels, the Giant Blacksmith, Gough and possibly Smough are Giants.  We know that Giants were not well respected, which is why people poired resin into Gough's helmet. The Giants were basically just grunts.  I think your thinking about Gods, like Ornstein and the Silver Knights. I think they just found powerful Souls in the Flame, or are descendants of those who did in the case of Gwyndolin."
DarkSouls2,3dxzrv,Shroom_Soul,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:14:21 2015 UTC,"As i mentioned above, i don't think that the Lord souls are so special, they are just very powerful versions of souls.   But i do think that the 4 lords by giving out portions of their souls empowered those lesser souls they deemd worthy.   The interesting thing here is that Humnaity as the items in DS1 are small fragments of the original dark soul and are somehow naturally occuring in humans (i think its becouse the pygmy died a long time ago so he couldnt control his lord soul, so humans just break off a piece of their soul when creating other humans... giving birth i mean)  On the other hand Divinity (Gwyns lord soul pieces, i think if we have Humanity the gods must have Divinity) were broken off and handed out from the original lord soul.   The fire and the death soul, i have no idea, but based on the above two, i would say that the Witch's lord soul broke into pieces and enchanted the creatures around it creating the demons. (I think the same thing happened with the demons as with the humans but with a slower pace, without anyone actually controlling the lord soul its just breaks into smaller pieces with each newborn demon appearing... i cant find the correct term for them breeding maybe?)  That leaves Nito's lord soul unaccounted for, i think He (She, It?) went Gwyns way, handing out small pieces to specific individuals and not fracturing the soul into lots of small pieces with constant multiplication of the bearers.  That would leave the giants, the crow girls, the dogs, the rats, and every other creature without a lord soul piece, but with their own souls, and as i have written above, i think the lord souls do rub on these small souls, not by directly giving them powers, but by inderctly changing how their bearers think and act. Giant are strong and straight thinking because Gwyns soul is mainly represent valor in battle and strenght in life, not say cunning or devious backstabbing."
DarkSouls2,3dxzrv,Shroom_Soul,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:59:34 2015 UTC,"If Giants were the ""creation"" of Gwyn, why are they hated by his followers?"

(its a bit strong for an example but i think thats all there is to it, hungarians hate gipsies, white people enslaved the black, americans are tought to be the dumbest people in the world... stereotipes and prejudices....)  On the other hand, in my opinion, Gwyns creations are the gods, not the giants, the first flame gave them souls just like every other living creature, some hollows get to be rats, some crowgirls, some dogs some giants.   Than during the Age of Fire these groups of creatures or races if you prefer aligned themselfs with one or none of the beings with great souls either by choice or by chance.  The giants ended up around Gwyn and he used them as manual labor, when the humans got around, they saw them, maybe even feared them so naturally they hated them without trying to understand them... Its in human nature...  I think..."
DarkSouls2,3dxzrv,Shroom_Soul,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:20:04 2015 UTC,"I think only Humans and Gods started as Hollows. Other animals are their own thing.

DarkSouls2,3dx838,ametalspoon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:44:43 2015 UTC,"All Arrows and Greatarrows do Thrust damage so yes, the Old Leo Ring works, though I'm not clear on exactly how much the base counter rating is. Might be the counter rating on the bow and is independent of the arrow used.   Unless you were talking about jumping attacks using bows, then in that case it doesn't work because bow jumping attacks deal Strike damage."

I posted this yesterday:  Check your agility, you want it to be at least 105, upgrading ADP is the best for it, but ATT will increase it too. Shed your armour and get yourself below 30% equip load, for maximum dodgability and fastest stamina regen. Learn his move set, only attack once or twice per opportunity, depending on the weapon you're using. Keep your health high, use the same attacking opportunities to heal instead, if required.  Fumey had two phases, so learn them both. You can force him into his second phase at the start of the fight by wearing Velstadt's helm. Fumey doesn't like Velstadt, he leant him his Prepare to Die edition of Dark Souls 1, but when he got it back the disc was scratched to fuck, and now Blightown is even worse.

If u were using a long sword/curved sword and playing that way, yes, it can be very annoying/boring to play against. Your opponent is somewhat right. Pure reactionary play doesn't ruin the game completely but honestly sucks the fun out of the game most of the time. It's well known that this game caters to reactionary players and usually SS and CS users are the very worst of this kind. Especially warped sword with its insta backstep punishes. For me is more annoying and boring than ""cheap"". When i see this playstyle i get this little irk in my  coolie crack, sigh, and say oh boy another one of these guys... the worst are the kids who play like this, win, and really think their something special for it."

DarkSouls2,3dytac,1200miccss,4,Mon Jul 20 17:14:40 2015 UTC,"Eh, pyromancies are not really that great as a mainstay for PvE. Lots of enemies have high resistance, many also have abundant water around, and most of the spells come late in the game and have relatively few casts. Unlike hexes or sorceries, you pretty much need some sort of melee backup (or other spells at least).   Fire bonus scales with int+fai, so getting the combination up to 60 would be the way to go for the softcap."
DarkSouls2,3dytac,lollersauce914,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:23:02 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said except the advice about raising INT and FTH. Raising INT and FTH has only a small effect on your pyromancy damage. The most important is to fully upgraded your glove. Don't bother raising INT and FTH for pyromancies, better to put your extra stats elsewhere."
DarkSouls2,3dytac,branchingfactor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:20:12 2015 UTC,"I'd agree for PvP, but for PvE stacking damage is really important for pyromancies because of the limited/slow casts. You need that damage a hell of a lot more than you need vig/end/vit/str/dex for PvE IMO."
DarkSouls2,3dytac,lollersauce914,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:22:20 2015 UTC,"For PvE, I'd pump ATN to get more slots and more casts from existing slots. You can go as high as 94 to get the most casts from existing slots. I'd also pump END because some of the spells require a lot of stamina to cast. Plus the usual VIG for life, VIT for longer rolls, and ATN for more i-frames. INT and FTH are the last stats I'd pump, unless I was planning to use Spells/Miracles/Hexes as a back up for the fire-resistant enemies."

DarkSouls2,3dypsb,Adenylatcyclase,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:50:15 2015 UTC,"Dexterity no longer effects cast times. Here's a handy page on cast times  For miracles I would use a lightning infused Priests chime for that S scaling, and you can get it very early game.   For hexes, I would suggest a dark Infused Caitha's Chime, and and a Dark Archdrake Staff. I'm sure there are better staves, but this one has proven to be good enough for me in any situation. It's also available early game.   Soft caps for both are 40 and hard caps are 50 (I believe)  As for what kind of weapon, use whatever you're comfortable with with an infusion of magic, lightning, fire, or dark (because they scale off of int and faith) and you'll be dandy, especially if you're planning on getting something like Dark Weapon or Crystal Magic Weapon.   Last but not least, clutch rings seem to be pretty helpful for any kind of elemental build.   Edit: Archdrake Staff, not the Staff of Amana"
DarkSouls2,3dypsb,Carl-Barker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:07:27 2015 UTC,am I understandung correctly?

DarkSouls2,3dypsb,Carl-Barker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:14:34 2015 UTC,"That's correct, most weapons other than boss weapon can be buffed with dark, even if infused.   There are 4 clutch rings, the Dark Clutch ring, Lightning Clutch ring, Magic clutch ring, am Fire clutch ring.   Each of the clutch rings gives you a damage boost to that specific element, but also lowers your defence values against strike, slash and trusting weapons."

It doesn't hurt that you can hit for over 1000 damage with the double R2 combo. Also you only need 20 strength, and 16 dexterity for the Heide Greatlance believe. And since it has some base lightning damage a lightning infusion with the lightning clutch ring is borderline OP."

I'm planning on using the thrones greatsword and crypt blacksword eventually. So I guess since the thorned sword requires 15 Dex another one point isn't too bad.

The key to the manor house can be found by talking to an NPC in the forest of giants over the side of the chapel(it's not called chapel, but it's to that effect) bonfire that you first meet the Pursuer at.

DarkSouls2,3dyggh,Carl-Barker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:50:33 2015 UTC,That sounds really neat I'll have to look it up. I'm trying to stay away from swords as it's all i could use when I started so I'm dead tired of them but that sounds like a very interesting weapon.  **  It does look like it can be bleed infused and it keeps it's S dex scaling regardless. Looks very impressive. I'll try and find some gameplay videos to see if it is as awesome as it reads.
DarkSouls2,3dyggh,Carl-Barker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:57:05 2015 UTC,"I find that it's significantly better as an off hand weapon, as opposed to a main hand weapon. Maybe try a bleed infused Mailbreaker with it? I think the Mailbreaker is an incredibly underused weapon, it's quick, does decent enough damage, goes through shields, and weighs next to nothing. Plus everyone who sees it assumes it's a parrying dagger, and they turtle up which leaves them vulnerable to the Mailbreaker's R2's."
DarkSouls2,3dyggh,Carl-Barker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:05:37 2015 UTC,I actually hate piercing weapons in this game. Feels like I am just forever lunging at something lol. That stone sword looks like it has a lot of neat mix up though. Definitely something to shoot for 1x if not 2x.

DarkSouls2,3dyggh,Carl-Barker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:01:36 2015 UTC,"I had a blast using Warped Sword in my main hand and Old Whip in my offhand. Not powerstanced just normally equipped. Two incredibly high damaging Dex weapons. Old Whip is a little fragile in terms of PVE though, so you may be better going for a different whip, its just hard to give up the HUGE damage it does.   But anyway, the idea is that since the Warped Sword has a pretty short range, I use its attacks when enemies get too close, and use the Old Whip to either push them back, or make them come back in closer for more curved sword punishment. Its quite a fun combo."
DarkSouls2,3dyggh,CrystlBluePersuasion,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:05:58 2015 UTC,"Even a shortsword can be a decent sidearm to go with a whip, many of the swords have a quick running slash thats great for harassing players and the R1s are some of the fastest.

DarkSouls2,3dx8vz,Komodo_Saurian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:07:07 2015 UTC,"I was working on the assumption that with a massive sword like that, the fact he's floating and the massive shield that any time I didn't fuck up the parry (aka 90% of the time. That's actually why I'm making a third character - to force me to improve my dodges and parries), the fact I would be trying to deflect a sword larger than myself wouldn't turn out too well.  I guess the regular slash attacks are parryable, then? I mean, the impale would be too risky to even try and the dash wouldn't make sense due to the momentum, but if my memory serves the first slash of the spinning combo does seem relatively slow before building up momentum into the shield bash and overhead swing.  I'll have to give it a shot next time I boot up the game, after all, it's the same way I beat Havel in the first game and I mean... The swords are about the same size, now that I think about it."
DarkSouls2,3dx8vz,Komodo_Saurian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:13:01 2015 UTC,You can parry all attacks other than the blue sword poke and the dark orbs spam (Although you can parry that one with a spell parry shield).

Keep your distance to bait the charge, wait until he's right in your face and starts swinging, then parry. Get a couple hits in, regain your distance, repeat.  Makes the fight a cakewalk.  Edit: our friendly neighborhood saurian beat me to it with the parry advice. Oh well, can't hope to be faster than a dragon!"
DarkSouls2,3dx8vz,Psychocandy42,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:10:00 2015 UTC,"The character I've just started to force me to learn to parry has an offhand Scimitar, which, unlike the default handedness of the Swordsman class (offhand Shortsword, mainhand Scimitar) allows me to parry. Would that stand in sufficiently for the Buckler, or would you recommend sticking to the parry-focussed items like Buckler, Target Shield and Parrying Dagger?"
DarkSouls2,3dx8vz,Psychocandy42,2,Mon Jul 20 08:23:30 2015 UTC,"My experience with the curved swords (scimmy, falchion and so on) is that they're horribly hard to pull off. As in, I have way less troubles parrying with ultragreat swords than with curved swords. And apparently I'm not alone, lots of people on here hate parrying with curved swords because of that.  Unless for some reason you feel comfortable with the scimitar's twirly spin parry, I'd suggest you try Buckler/Target first; then once you feel good with it you can move on to other tools and find yours.   But honestly, the Buckler has a ton of parry frames and it's the best training tool there is. If you wanna get a feeling for how piss-easy it makes the Purse User fight, lookie here!"
DarkSouls2,3dx8vz,Psychocandy42,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:29:37 2015 UTC,"The first video... That's a parry?! If I were to be invaded by someone weilding that and saw that move, I would be incredibly mad that I was parried, since it looks like a full-on swing.  The second, he certainly deserves it, the bastard.  All I can think of that would cause the Curved Sword's parries to be strange is that the Buckler and Target Shield (and Parrying Dagger, though that has a different animation) seem to have a... 'charge-up' to their parry. I guess it could be that the curved swords have a longer-shorter charge-up.  I can certainly agree they feel a little wonky with the parry, though it may be that I've not done it for ages - right when I started the character I started practicing it on the unarmed Hollows in Things Betwixt, and it seemed that I had to have a very short distance from the enemy otherwise it would not connect (I mean I couldn't be pressed right into them like I am used to), and I had to time it before they began their swing.   The plan I'll stick to is the first appearance will be Buckler, simply because popular opinion is that it is easier, and then I'll get in some practice with the curved sword on the boss-form if I screw that first appearance up. I'll hopefully get the Cleric's Parma soon enough, anyway, for spell-parrying, so if it comes to it I can keep the Scimitar on-hand for power-stancing and switch to that for an all-around parry. (I wasn't even aware spell-parrying had been moved to an exclusive group of shields until I read the Cleric's Parma's description)."
DarkSouls2,3dx8vz,oDRACARYSo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:54:04 2015 UTC,"ahah yep the first one's how greatsword and ultraweapons' parries look like. Not exactly your go-to parry tool but a lot swaggier than your usual shield parry!  Anyway yeah, it's all about the startup with parries. I'm pretty confident with the Buckler's (and small shields in general), kinda good with ultraweapons and Rapier/Parrying Dagger, absolute shit with curved swords, cause I could never fully understand how long the windup is and when the actual parry frames start.   If you plan on spellparrying, too (it's fun! and honestly quite easy, every spellparry shield has a ton of parry frames), Cleric's Parma/Cleric's Small Shield are excellent choices, though my absolute favorite is the Cursed Bone Shield – because of its relative rarity, I suspect."
DarkSouls2,3dx8vz,ketatrypt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:06:21 2015 UTC,"Small shields have a very... simple and familiar animation for me, it's exactly what I'm used to from DS1 and it has no frills. The only small shield spellparry I've found thus far has been the Cleric's Parma, with another spellparry shield being a medium shield. Naturally once I actually get deep into the game, I'll find other equipment with which to use.  Currently I've started another character (I got fed up of how ugly they are and figured I may as well get in some practise) and right now I'm grinding out Things Betwixt to spawn-death by parrying all the enemies and then going for a big stab. I might try out this method for the rest of the game, though it would be the grindiest thing I've ever done, so I'll likely break and only do it on troublesome areas."
DarkSouls2,3dx8vz,LumpyArryhead,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:37:51 2015 UTC,"One useful thing to keep in mind is that lots of bonfires (at least one per area) have a very convenient, isolated mob right beside it, and usually they use different weapons. (Ab)use them as (s)parrying partners!"
DarkSouls2,3dx8vz,Multipwner,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:44:44 2015 UTC,"That is precisely how I intend to practise - In Things Betwixt, for example, there's a couple of different enemy types.  Unarmed, Dagger/broken sword, bow-with-offhand-dagger and I believe there's even one with a repaired sword. The extra souls really doesn't hurt, either - I've almost despawned the first enemy and killed a couple of others, and I'm up to 720 without any consumables used (healing or souls). I look forward to the few free levels headstart I'll be getting, it'll allow me to get to the 11/24 Str/Dex requirements to powerstance the Shortsword and Scimitar +1s I started with (It's great that they give me my favourite straight sword and a curved sword to offhand parry before attaining a shield, and they're upgraded, to boot!)  I could also do with learning the parry windows for unarmed parrying, as it would allow me to more easily transition to small shields (I believe they're identical) as well as allow me to use the Scimitar mainhand, as it does a little more damage currently and scales better with Dex, which I believe will be my main damage stat for this character."
DarkSouls2,3dx8vz,Drithyin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:56:02 2015 UTC,"Heh, unarmed parrying is a fickle beast indeed. Not because the animation's weird or anything, but because you have to be way more precise than with a shield because it has fewer active parry frames. If you can master it you should be all set for almost everything else!  And if you like the Scimmy, you'll find a lot of stuff you'll fall in love with by progressing through the game. There's a couple of curved swords that can easily carry you to the end of NG+ and beyond if you upgrade them (and the scimitar itself isn't half bad)."
DarkSouls2,3dx8vz,Thalnagath,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:02:09 2015 UTC,"I finally looked up parry frames and oh christ, no wonder I can't parry a single thing with my fists. The wind-up is over double the time and the active amount is under half the time, it essentially forces me to act 3 times farther ahead than otherwise and be three times as precise with said timing. Looking at the parry timing on 2h Straight Sword, it must have been luck that I pulled it off the one time.  Also from the numbers I'm looking at, the Buckler seems to be mercifully similar - a fraction of a second longer windup for a slightly longer action and a longer recovery (which, let's face it, is irrelevant - I either land it or get hit once then dodge away).  And finally, the Parrying Dagger is apparently worse in every way to a curved sword or parrying shield. Strange, considering its name.  Finally, I'm mainly looking at the Scimi right now because I have never used a Curved Sword before in DS1 or in DS2 (I hear the Warped Sword is pretty good, though. I have one on both my other main characters, but it being a Curved Sword, it never got use). I tried one out on my other melee character, but found it too light and whiffy compared to my taste in Greatswords (block and then Greatsword swing) and Straight Swords (Which is currently my mainhand weapon - I either parry and use that to deal the blow, or I combo the two together in a right-left or left-right combo that's surprisingly effective. Pah, Power stance, eat your heart out! Don't really, you do so much damage I swear I can put up with the horrendous durability you sap"
DarkSouls2,3dx8vz,planetfunk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:35:47 2015 UTC,"Parrying is definitely the best option, but if you don't feel up to it, grab a shield with 100% physical reduction and just strafe right and watch your stamina.  His charge attack will miss altogether and you can hit him once or twice.  His combo attack, you should block the first one or two of his swings, then try to roll behind him for the final one, and you can hit him again.  The grab attack either start backing up and roll backwards or roll to the right and attack again.  For the homing dark magic you just need to strafe right while being as close as possible. When it finishes you can get a couple of hits in."

On repeat playthrus I always just pick one in the moment (that is, of course, if I want to incur the sin), but on my most recent character, I just wailed on both of them until one of them died (it was Pate). Then I spoke with Creighton, exhausted his dialogue, got the key, then hacked him down too.  You can actually get two sets of their gear per playthru if you get Pate's set at Earthen Peak, kill Pate in the Creighton/Pate fight (he drops his spear), Creighton gifts you his set, then kill Creighton (he drops his Mask) and talk to Melentia to buy another full Pate set and shield as well as the remainder of Creighton's set.

DarkSouls2,3dwrwh,KajusX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:09:51 2015 UTC,"ahh, gotcha. Yeah, I used to prepare for Death by front-loading my pawns with TONS of blast arrows, but then when I realized even if you killed him he could pop up, like, three rooms later, that really negated that incentive (other than farming him for upgrade materials). Now whenever Death shows up I just bolt. 'PEACE! ZOOOOOOOOM'"
DarkSouls2,3dwrwh,OrnsteinSolaireChild,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:13:57 2015 UTC,I've never actually killed Death. I've tried once. All the other times I just run away. I'm just not a high level I guess  or he's super resistant to magic.
DarkSouls2,3dwrwh,KajusX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:22:43 2015 UTC,"There's a chance he'll appear in the first big room when the lizards are there, and so I'd run in and out until he popped up, and then I'd blast arrow him, keeping him on the ground and unable to get up and warp away. That's the key, is just pentad or 10-tad (whatever that Ranger skill is called) shotting Death with Blast Arrows so that he can't get up and warp away.  Thinking I was rid of him for the rest of the journey, my pawns and I ventured further into Bitterblack when all of a sudden Death's back. I was so miffed. lol"
DarkSouls2,3dwrwh,Earlycrowd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:26:57 2015 UTC,So I'm guessing he's just super stronk against magic? My magic bow (forgot what they're called) and my shock daggers never did crap to him.

Impossible infusions and illegal upgrades have a high change to result in a softban. Item quantities have legal limits, too.  Changing your SM and SL (even modifying your stats via CE) is dangerous. People figured out how to detect most cheats and scripts. Speedmodifier changes? Infinite stamina? Changed iframes? They are not only visible to good players but detectable by other CE users. The chance for bans is there and the arena community on PC will very likely know that you cheat anyway.  Nobody cares about your items and builds in arena at 150. Nobody assumes you can't beat the PvE part several times in a row and do basic farming. If you fight legit everything is okay and people will prefer to see somebody will full +10 instead of someone with only +8 at meta level. Cheating for low level PvP is a different story."

DarkSouls2,3dx70j,DarkDreamscapes,4,Mon Jul 20 07:32:13 2015 UTC,"1) Use the Black Knight Ultra Greatsword instead of the Greatsword. It innately has Fire damage, and has the superior moveset of the Zweihander when 2-handed.  2) Don't fire infuse it, as the Fire scaling stays at C, so not worth it. Instead, just go minimum requirements to wield it (30STR and 16DEX) and infuse it with Raw. That way you get more damage and you can still slap Charcoal Pine Resin (which is superior to Flame Weapon) on it and use RoB+2 for the full +50AR.  3) SL98 is too low for an UltraGS/Pyro build. You'll be super squishy. Instead opt for SL175-200. Since you are from Demon Soul days, you are used to lower levels. In Dark Souls 2, you need to invest more in stats to make a good build.  4) Here's a sample stat investment:  VGR - 40 (at least)  END - 30 (at least)  VIT - However much you need to carry all your equipment and still be below 50%. Probably use Third Dragon Ring and see how much VIT you still need. If you plan on using Flynn's Ring, it's possible to do that if you use the Lion Mage Set for increased cast speed and the Saint's Hood or Hexer's Hood for an extra spell cast. Your defense won't be high, but you'll be lightweight and can manage to be below 50% equip load. Alternatively just use RoB+2, and pump VIT until you are below 40% equip load.  ATN - 30 (for 6 spell slots)   STR - 30  DEX - 16  ADP - First level ATN, then level ADP until your AGL is 100 or 105 (depends on how many iFrames you like to have).  INT/FTH - 15/15. You need 13 FTH for BKUGS, so go 15/15 for a little bit extra fire damage.  Spells are completely up to you! There are many good spell combos. For PvE I definitely recommend Flame Swathe, it's very powerful! You can always use the Southen Ritual Band +2 for 3 extra slots if you're big on pyromancies.  Hope this helps!"

DarkSouls2,3dx70j,AstralAeonSoul,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:20:49 2015 UTC,The meta should be from 175 to 200 for a well fleshed out build.
DarkSouls2,3dx70j,TheIntelligentManate,3,Tue Jul 21 21:03:03 2015 UTC,"I have to give Astral credit for his/her suggestions but here's where he/she is incorrect.  Scaling & you: For the Black Knight Ultra Greatsword there is very little debate over it's move-set, that is, that the move-set is innately better than the standard Greatsword; however scaling does not work in letters.  Uninfused is nets 75.51% scaling in Str, 25% scaling in Dex, and 40% scaling in FireBns (which I'm assuming is what you'd like.) Fire infused in nets a 44.9% scaling in Str, 15% scaling in Dex, and a 67.33% scaling in FireBns. Raw infused nets 19.39% Str scaling, 9% Dex scaling, and 30% FireBns scaling with a net ~54 Ar flat increase.  What this means is the breakpoint for damage to Str to FireBns (screw Dex for this sword, sorry) is 30-37 Str to +60 split between Int and Fth. (30-32 Str to a +30 split between Int and Fth.) And the breakpoint to make Raw the most optimal infusion is actually below the Str needed to one-hand the weapon in terms of Physical damage; HOWEVER in terms of fire damage Raw is excellent if you want to minimize points in FireBns and seek a lower level build.  [Fire best for buffing / Raw best for low-level / Uninfused best for high level; high Str AND FireBns.]  Base damage & you: Infusions work completely on base damage and increase the damage by a base multiplier. Most infusions work on a x1.25 multiplier after a base 50 Ar addition. What this means is that:  Total Ar = Base Ar + Scaling + 1.25(Fire base damage +50) [assuming we're using flame weapon; charcoal pine resin is always more effective as its multiplier is higher.] For summary purposes we'll just state that Fire is the best if you want to pop a pine resin or use Flame Weapon in terms of outright damage. I always find that physical damage is more consistent, but everything has its niche.]  Stats & You: When we’re talking stat alignments I need to give you barebones stuff so you can add to it: [Vig 30-50] [End 30-40] [Vit ?] [Atn 20, 25, 30 (for 4, 5, and 6 slots respectively)] [Str 30+ (it is free damage after all)] [Dex 16] [at 20 Atn, 27 Adp will give you those 12 i frames (20 Adp for 10 i-frames)] [at 25 Atn, 25 Adp will give you those 12 i-frames (19 Adp for 10 i-frames)] [at 30 Ant, 24 Adp will give you those 12 i-frames (17 Adp for 10 i-frames)] [Int 15-30] [Fth 15-30] This should give you some material to work around Vit being ambiguous to how much stuff you plan to carry along. [40, 30, 10, 20, 30, 16, 27, 15, 15 comes out as a clean 150 build and stays within the limits for Third Dragon Ring + Flynn’s Ring.]  Spells & you: With a Black Knight Ultra Greatsword I’m hoping you’re going to be melee oriented and have spells for the ‘youtube worthy’ mixups. If you’re planning on maining spells or being more caster oriented, grab a Clear Bluestone Ring +2, and a good ol Southern Ritual Band.  Great Pyromancies include: Great Combustion (a must) Flame Weapon (if not using pine resins) Fire Snake (beware of limited casts, and costs 2 slots) Flame Swathe (mid-distance damage) Great Fireball (kind of a must, I prefer it over many others) Forbidden Sun (I’m very nitpicky about this one, as it’s cost outweighs its benefits, 3 slots for 1 cast that’s used to primarily kill someone in healing animation. I suppose if you hate healers…) Outcry/Firestorm variants (if you have a free slot) Warmth (if you invade and need those heals against gankers or something)  I hope this has been informational and I’ve cited my sources below, have fun and please don’t adhere to this; do what makes your build YOUR build.  http://darksouls2.wikidot.com/  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pnx3m5jsmIoI_azJzlmG9ETfUc4qo0h36lCYbqTPAB0/edit#gid=1681915076  https://bb4f3a1a9993fc2a9dad5f73b05a48779cba04f0.googledrive.com/host/0BxQ-6N1MSsrsZTk0dWpSVU5BVFk/calculator.html  http://mugenmonkey.com/darksouls2/"

You can see it here: https://youtu.be/1WsO6LoEpG8?t=53s  What's so special about the thrust is that it extends an inner spear as the outer blades spread out. If you hit with both parts you deal massive damage. At the moment my record is a 1,400 damage counter-hit while one-handing it. It also counts as thrust damage so it synergizes with the Old Leo ring very well."

DarkSouls2,3du1s7,KijaJouteh,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:18:22 2015 UTC,"Just know that only the strong attacks are spear thrusts, thus they use more stamina. Don't be afraid to utilize the halberd side of the moveset as well. My favorite combo is the running 1H attack (which is the halberd sweep) into the 1H strong attack (the high damage stab). They flow nicely into one another, to the point where I believe the first running attack actually speeds up the strong attack following it."
DarkSouls2,3du1s7,Thalnagath,2,Mon Jul 20 20:30:24 2015 UTC,Spear moveset when powerstanced instead of the horrible swinging moveset of the normal halberds. Also it has good reach.
DarkSouls2,3du1s7,TheOnionBro,2,Sun Jul 19 20:10:29 2015 UTC,It actually has the longest spear poke in the game due to the ejected spike. I tested it up against a wall and it's longer than both the Pike and Pate's Spear.

DarkSouls2,3dxuh2,whyeverso,6,Mon Jul 20 12:42:54 2015 UTC,Bloodborne is without a doubt the easiest to get parries because there is no risk involved. In the Souls games you will get punished for a failed parry.  But in the end they all have slightly different timings so it's not like you can learn them in one game and pull them off in another as easily.
DarkSouls2,3dxuh2,DrTobio,4,Mon Jul 20 12:47:49 2015 UTC,"However I don't think this would be the best to learn parrying in. Would it be the easiest? Yes... But would it be versatile enough to transfer over to the other Souls game's? Likely not. Bloodborne has huuuuge parry windows compared to the other games, meaning an enemy won't even have to be swinging to be able to parry them. On Souls games however, your shield / parrying tool has to actually connect with the enemies weapons during a swing in most cases.   That being said, I believe Dark Souls 2 would be the best place to learn parrying. It has an array of tools that are good (small shields, buckler, parrying dagger, etc) to start off with, and enemies that are easy to learn with (hollowed soldiers in Forest of Fallen Giants).   Hope this helps as well, /u/whyeverso"
DarkSouls2,3dxuh2,e_0,4,Mon Jul 20 12:52:12 2015 UTC,"This makes sense - Bloodborne parries are fun, but they're so easy that I'm constantly getting them by accident from yards away."

DarkSouls2,3dxuh2,Fishfold,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:59:03 2015 UTC,"It's a ""gun parry"". If you want to get technical the definition of a parry is as follows: ward off (a weapon or attack), especially with a countermove."

DarkSouls2,3dxuh2,Adamantaimai,2,Mon Jul 20 13:06:26 2015 UTC,Parrying was a lot easier in DS1 than in DS2 imo. Haven't played the other games.
DarkSouls2,3dxuh2,TheTweets,2,Mon Jul 20 13:57:06 2015 UTC,"There seems to be a windup added to all parry-specialised items, and a less-noticeable one added to everything else. DS1 also seemed to always work when you were pressed up to an enemy dick-to-dick, but DS2 seems to need a slight distance from you relative to the size of the enemy and their weapon. I mean so long as it's consistent I don't have anything against DS2's style of parrying, and from what I can gather it does seem to be pretty consistent - all my misses feel like I've either screwed it up or I've not compensated for the wireless controller delay and delay it takes me to push down the trigger to parry."
DarkSouls2,3dxuh2,Jaclausen,2,Mon Jul 20 14:55:41 2015 UTC,"Dark souls 2, i'd say parrying in ds2 is the most difficult"

When I came to DS2 from DS1, I couldn't parry for the life of me even though I could parry with my eyes closed (not really) in DS1. It took a lot of practice on enemies, NPC invaders, and finally other players for me to get consistently good at parrying in DS2.  Try not to lump this mechanic together in all the games, because each one has quirks that are completely different from the others, with the obvious exception being Demon's>DS1"
DarkSouls2,3dxuh2,Carl-Barker,2,Mon Jul 20 16:25:06 2015 UTC,"I played through Demon's Souls first, then moved on to Dark Souls, and then Dark Souls 2 but never really bothered learning how to parry until recently. Strangely enough I found that Demon's Souls was the easiest to transfer parry skills from. I don't know what it is, maybe it's just because I played Demon's Souls first, but I would definitely start learning how to parry there, and then save Dark Souls 2 for last, simply because the timing seems very different."
DarkSouls2,3dxuh2,Tryclyde,2,Mon Jul 20 16:26:38 2015 UTC,Mmmm. You should learn to parry on whichever game you plan on playing primarily. They're all different.

Yet the combat experience still makes up a large part of the game you almost find yourself setting it to easy just to get to the good bits. Apart from dark souls the best combat can be found in the classic Isometric/ paused style combat of Baldur's gate etc that used DnD rules even the best combat experiences of this generation are in games like Dragon Age.  Dark souls has that level of control, detail and refinement in an Action RPG. I am honestly blown away and apparently DS1 is just as good or better so I am happy as hell right about now especially with 3 coming out next year.

DarkSouls2,3dx0w7,rhoparkour,4,Mon Jul 20 07:08:11 2015 UTC,"New Game Plus is also considerably harder than New Game, so you could always either play through til then or Bonfire ascetic everything. Each time you Ascetic a bonfire the area will go up one NG level and be that way permanently for that character. So if you ascetic say the King's Gate bonfire in NG, it'll reset the boss and all mobs and go up to the NG+ version. If you then go to NG+, King's Gate will be NG++ and so on."
DarkSouls2,3dx0w7,Thalnagath,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:07:40 2015 UTC,"The problem is tho that areas can only be asceticed once the boss dies.  EVEN then, if that ascetic revives the a boss, you can't use another one until it dies."

What I plan to do is set out as I have stated and then if it all gets too much look at what I am lacking and remedy it... if I find I really need a shield then I will use it.  I won't be restarting and plan to go as far into the NG pluses as possible with a SL 70, if that means dropping the Covenant of Champions to get a few more then so be it."

DarkSouls2,3dx0fd,-V0rador-,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:30:55 2015 UTC,PC moderately active people seem to be invading more in some areas. Which is good. Branched out PvP is something good. We all need to try and push it around.

DarkSouls2,3dx0fd,alex2489,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:01:45 2015 UTC,Xbox one isn't dead for co op. Just not a lot of people do it and SM varies too. Look for the orange boxes around areas while you are at a bonfire. That's where more players will be
DarkSouls2,3dx0fd,ametalspoon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:50:07 2015 UTC,"Of the different platforms, I'm assuming Xbox1 has the smaller DS2 community. I wouldn't call it dead, just less populated"
DarkSouls2,3dx0fd,TrueFader,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:38:05 2015 UTC,"Dude, shit's broken. I can't even co-op with people I've convinced to purchase the game despite being on the exact same soul tier.  I can't invade. I can't summon. If on the off chance I'm actually able to find someone for jolly co-op and want to summon them back for round two, I can forget about it, because it's not fucking happening.  I dueled someone in the arena recently and noticed via their profile they were streaming on Twitch so I went to check out their channel. I watch for around thirty minutes and this dude has a new contender every match. Heaps of gamertags I've never come across in my life.. but when I duel in the arena, I'm stuck with the same two or three people on repeat for HOURS!  Without fail, people come to this sub on the daily and ask about this.. and no one ever has a solid response to give. I emailed BanCo and posted their reply to this sub, but I was downvoted into oblivion. More or less, nothing is wrong on their end and regardless if all requirements for co-op are met, co-op is not guaranteed.  This game worked perfectly fine before early June's server maintenance.  Although this problem doesn't affect every NetfliXbox user, it's still a huge deal and I'm flabbergasted that more people aren't completely fucking livid."

DarkSouls2,3e076r,Ignopius,7,Mon Jul 20 23:11:59 2015 UTC,How could Fromsoft seriously not realize this would be a problem with game design when choosing the bonfires location?   You could use a homeward bone.
DarkSouls2,3e076r,Komodo_Saurian,5,Mon Jul 20 23:22:59 2015 UTC,"priest boss with the cathedral place.     More specific please? Do you mean prowling magus? Tseladora area? All bonfires are able to warp to one another, all you had to do was homeward bone. That's your fault."
DarkSouls2,3e076r,Stalking_Panda,-6,Mon Jul 20 23:17:14 2015 UTC,I completely forgot about that. But had I been out it still would have been a case for poor design. And should a small mistake like forgetting a bone be worth 18k souls? I don't think so.
DarkSouls2,3e076r,Stalking_Panda,6,Tue Jul 21 00:01:48 2015 UTC,It's bad design because you walked off some cliffs and couldn't get back?     Sounds like you just need to pay attention.

DarkSouls2,3dw2aq,Kanimize,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:35:43 2015 UTC,"This Fightclub (and future for now) was hosted from the 37th Tier of Soul Matching which is the 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 Souls bracket. I am still debating if I should move to the SL 250 range which is SM 10 Million roughly and lands in tier 39 which unfortunately limits the number of players who can join and none of them are the SL 150 meta's.  For those curious this means that for me to be able to see your Red Sign Soap Stone OR your White Sign Soapstone in the case of 2v2 or 3v3 matchups the following SM's are accessible to my Host Memory.  Red Sign Soapstone: Tier 32+ which is 2,000,000 or higher Soul Memory  White Sign Soapstone: Tier 34+ which is 2,500,000 or higher Soul Memory  I am still deciding if I should use the Engraved Ring. I do not like doing so as it forces people to have it on however it ensures quicker matchmaking. If the ring will be used I will detail what God/Goddess to use for the Ring when I post upon Reddit/Steamgroup for the date/time of the Fightclub."

DarkSouls2,3dxcvo,IceyJenkins,2,Mon Jul 20 09:00:16 2015 UTC,you need to have 1.5 times the normal requirements to powerstance anything.  Make sure you have the stat requirements.

DarkSouls2,3dxcc3,oDRACARYSo,4,Mon Jul 20 08:51:46 2015 UTC,"I've always thought that it would be better if SM was only the total you'd spent on levelling and upgrading equipment, not the total souls you'd earned.  This way you could hold your SM level at any level you'd like, you couldn't just limitlessly upgrade equipment and money spent on repairs/arrows/consumables wouldn't just stack on your SM.   I believe if it were SM only that we would have lots of people restarting lots of characters to build new ones which would increase early game summons and invasions.   This is a moderately good point I hadn't thought of. That said I currently have a PvE character in NG++ with about 18million SM and there really is no shortage of summons, co-op or invasions (a LOT of havelbros). So plenty of folks don't care to restart for the sake of a build."
DarkSouls2,3dxcc3,danby,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:03:16 2015 UTC,"I would agree with both methods of working with SM; with souls earned it does add to the PvE as you can't lose any souls that you earn. But then you can't buy consumables, I hate not being able to buy any arrows or use a crossbow etc..."
DarkSouls2,3dxcc3,danby,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:23:17 2015 UTC,with souls earned it does add to the PvE as you can't lose any souls that you earn.   That's great if you're already good (say on your second run). But most people will play NG once and maybe not even complete but their first run through will be full of souls lost that simply didn't contribute to their PvP experience other than making them ascend to SM levels they aren't prepared for.
DarkSouls2,3dxcc3,wickedblight,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:35:35 2015 UTC,Fully agree. Still I have always had a few playthroughs before tackling pvp..
DarkSouls2,3dxcc3,wickedblight,2,Mon Jul 20 09:39:29 2015 UTC,But why bother upgrading any gear yourself when a friend can just give you everything fully upgraded?   I've talked about SM way too much but I loved it back when it actually killed the unfair meta. Shame they ruined it

DarkSouls2,3dxcc3,xIAmRetributionx,2,Mon Jul 20 14:34:01 2015 UTC,"I personally like SM, it opens up more matchmaking without a strict enforced Meta as only the Arena uses SL. However, I personally would prefer if SM only tracked souls used for the following:   Souls used to Level Up. Souls used to Upgrade Gear.   Now, if Soul Memory did not track lost souls or souls spent on consumables it would be much better. Tracking temporary increases in power and pure waste is a poor idea."

DarkSouls2,3dv83w,tsuchinokoDemon,6,Mon Jul 20 14:41:33 2015 UTC,"Broadsword needs a buff. As of right now there is pretty much zero reason to use it. I think from gave it 'B' scaling in str to make it more unique but other straightswords with C/C still do more damage than the broad sword even if you only level str. At almost every STR level the Varangian sword and the drakkeeper's sword have more damage. They also have more reach, poisebreak...ect. The only reason you would ever use the thing is if you can't handle 2 more units of weight.   I think pretty much every ultra weapon needs a bump in physical scaling.   Bandit axe and battle axe should have reduced base damage and increased scaling. These weapons are crazy good when infused due to their high base damage.   Katana's need reduced counter damage.   I don't like Havel's set having the most defense and poise. I think it should have it's weight reduced and either it's defense or poise reduced as well. This way we can get some more variety with heavy armor users."
DarkSouls2,3dv83w,OrnsteinSolaireChild,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:28:29 2015 UTC,"130 would be fine for katanas.

I want to see them in PVP. Yes, its that simple.   Flamberge   One of my favorite Greatswords, but besides the godlike lenght there is nothing to say about it (yay bleed...).

DarkSouls2,3dv83w,VnzuelanDude,6,Sun Jul 19 22:27:48 2015 UTC,Melu isn't useless :(  It has a high base damage with low wield requirements so its the best candidate for infusion among curved swords.   But since people couldnt care less about level management they just assume the Warped Sword does everything.
DarkSouls2,3dv83w,YARPakaLEX,2,Sun Jul 19 23:10:32 2015 UTC,"Isn't the Manikin Scimitar the best when it comes to infusions?   At +10 you get 220 phys. dmg + 140 elemental dmg.  On a low lvl build, this thing hits like two trucks tied together with a chain, forming an even bigger truck."
DarkSouls2,3dv83w,YARPakaLEX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:30:56 2015 UTC,Its 170/170 dmg. Manikin sabre has a much higher dexterity requirement and greater scaling. But the str requirement is only 6 so it makes it awesome for dual wielding.

DarkSouls2,3dv83w,alex2489,5,Mon Jul 20 07:38:13 2015 UTC,Umbral Dagger needs a buff.  The critical multiplier is great but the damage is so low that you are better off using a fully upgraded regular Dagger.

DarkSouls2,3dv83w,alex2489,2,Mon Jul 20 04:22:43 2015 UTC,"Ivory Straight Sword could use a buff! At least an E scaling or something to give it an edge compared to other weapons. Maybe lessen the amount of durability per swing; maybe slightly faster speed, after all it is the slowest Straight Sword. Or you could lessen the amount of DEX needed to weild it, I mean 40 DEX for a weapon that doesn't have scaling is kinda dumb.  Seriously this weapon needs a buff, there are so many cons to the weapon.  Cons:  -Low damage  -Durability loss with each hit (even if it doesn't touch anything)  -High requirements in order to weild properly  -No scaling  -Slow swing speed  -Lackluster compared to other weapons available at that point of the game, even when fully upgraded.  Pros:  -Stylish as hell  -Low weight  -Hard to parry  -Shield piercing (to a degree)  -2HR2 does great amount of damage"
DarkSouls2,3dv83w,Thalnagath,2,Mon Jul 20 04:09:06 2015 UTC,Lances and spears need like 500 durability. Stupid fucking PC bugs

DarkSouls2,3dv83w,Thalnagath,2,Tue Jul 21 15:46:30 2015 UTC,Then lances still need like 3x their actual durability because they break ridiculously fast.
DarkSouls2,3dv83w,AstralAeonSoul,2,Tue Jul 21 16:11:06 2015 UTC,Hmm. I did my entire no death run with only the grand lance in sotfs since you get it right after the last giant. I never had it break nor did I notice the durability getting low. I didnt kill any world enemies though and just ran boss to boss. It probably has to do with the multiple hits per attack taking extra durability.
DarkSouls2,3dv83w,Thalnagath,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:54:13 2015 UTC,Yup. It's very noticeable with heide lances because they only have 60 durability instead of grand lance's 110
DarkSouls2,3dv83w,AstralAeonSoul,4,Tue Jul 21 17:22:55 2015 UTC,i think the drop rates need a buff and jesters robes should be nonexistent

There's a reason they included the STR and DEX rings in the DLC, as well as the Vessel Shield and the Crown of the Sunken King. It's all to make a OneBro more versatile.  So yes at SL200 some of these are crap, but at SL1 with the right infusion they're good.   Source: over 50 hours of SL1 PvP."

Also, I'm pretty sure that, despite saying 160 counter damage, counterhits don't actually deal 160% damage. I've used an Uchigatana, and while it ""only"" has 150 counter damage, its counterhits definitely feel more powerful compared to normal hits when put side-by-side with a lance."
DarkSouls2,3dwcps,iSwingWood,4,Mon Jul 20 02:07:28 2015 UTC,"Dark Souls II is nowhere NEAR as fast as Bloodborne first off.   There is no Dash move. Shields are a thing. They work great in PvE. Dark Souls II has the slowest combat of all the Souls games. ADP effects your Agility or how many iframes you have on a Roll.   Taht being said, yes Dexterity weapons are faster than STR weapons. So I would recommend grabbing a Straightsword (longsword or shortsword) and try that."

Starting class has minimal effect on you unless you plan on really min/maxing for PvP Metaplay.  You'll find a LOT of weapons throughout the game. A hint w/o spoilers is that there's a forest, with a hole in a wall near a bonfire. Explore that pit, you'll find something that will probably fit your playstyle at the bottom.  I ain't going to say more about that unless you want a verbatim spoiler :D"

DarkSouls2,3dwcps,Voidtalon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:56:01 2015 UTC,I believe so. Though to be more specific w/o names.  Just check these things off your to-do list OP.   Did you see a fat guy in a river? Did you run up an exploding stairwell? Did you open a closed door to an old hags hangout?   If you did all that you are right by the area. Look for some scaffolding and go exploring. I believe that's as close as I can get to it without naming names.
DarkSouls2,3dwcps,KajusX,2,Mon Jul 20 03:03:05 2015 UTC,"Everything /u/Voldtalon said. If you want a relatively fast-attacking character, then Swordsman is a pretty good class to start as. Work on DEX, some STR, and definitely crank up your ADP to get better Agility, which will give you more iframes for your evasive rolls.  Also note that equip weight/burden is a thing, and it affects the distance of your rolls as well as the speed at which you regenerate stamina. So stick to light armor if you want to maximize on your elusiveness because it sounds like you don't want to block hits, you want them to whiff entirely.  The Knight Warrior class starts with a shield, but any class can use a shield if necessary (if you have the stats), and there are plenty of decent ones available pretty early on."
DarkSouls2,3dwcps,OblivionSol,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:26:44 2015 UTC,Alrighty thank you! Once I start playing I may change my mind on the whole blocking attacks idea. I am open to shields even though I'm not used to them. I appreciate the help. (From everyone)

It's just that against most people you meet on the bridge, you don't learn much besides that katanas/straight swords/small axes/rapiers etc. hurt a lot.

To your right should be another zip line that leads to a ledge with a Mage and a spoider. To the right of them is a door in the wall. Follow this door and there's a room with 2 mages and a big hole in the floor. drop down the hole and there's your bonfire.

DarkSouls2,3dvfi7,Hasuman,2,Mon Jul 20 05:21:26 2015 UTC,"A few observations:   Bone Fist 2hr2, Ivory Straight Sword 2hr2, and the Smelter Hammer can do absolutely massive damage but that's balanced out by their slow attack speed. Ice rapier is OP. All the dlc spell tools are trash except for Pilgrim's Spontoon. Yorgh's Spear, Aged Smelter Sword, Drakeblood GS, Loyce GS, Charred Loyce GS, Fume Sword, Fume UGS, Allone Sword, Ashen Warrior Sword, Wrathful Axe, and Bone Fist are all definitely worth using. IKUGS, Sanctum Mace, and most of the Ivory Straight sword's attacks aren't that great."
DarkSouls2,3dvfi7,LumpyArryhead,2,Sun Jul 19 22:11:00 2015 UTC,I wouldn't call Bone Fist slow. Its speed varies greatly for every attack.
DarkSouls2,3dvfi7,demonssouls12345,2,Mon Jul 20 02:55:23 2015 UTC,"Every bone fist initiator is slow as shit.    Like... compared to Caestus, BF first hit is way slower, 2nd hit is equal, 3rd and 4th hits are way faster.     Outside pstance it's slower first hit, faster 2nd and third.     R2, rolling, sprint/backstep, all slow as hell on bone fist.     Basically it gives you fast followups but the first hit is super slow to make up for it."
DarkSouls2,3dvfi7,Wafz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:10:40 2015 UTC,"I just noticed I only typed '2hr2' in front of the ivory straight sword. I meant that to include the bone fist as well, since it's 2hr2 does so much more damage than it's other attacks. You're definitely right about it's attacks varying in speed."

DarkSouls2,3dvfi7,rekrapinator,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:23:37 2015 UTC,Ivory straight sword is shit. Wrathful Axe is also not great to say the least. Everything else is pretty good though the Smelter Hammer is tough as shit to use.
DarkSouls2,3dvfi7,Ansarricade,2,Sun Jul 19 21:23:00 2015 UTC,you take that back about the smelter hammer that is the best weapon in the game period
DarkSouls2,3dvfi7,rekrapinator,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:57:19 2015 UTC,Didn't say it was bad. Just that it's tough to use. Though that jumping smash attack is too much fun.

DarkSouls2,3dvfi7,Pajeration,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:51:41 2015 UTC,True but it's still not hard to avoid. I like halberds but something just feels off about it or something. Might just be that halberds are already tough to use and others are juat better.
DarkSouls2,3dvfi7,Ansarricade,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:13:43 2015 UTC,"It's probably the third best halberd, behind black knight and mastodon, and yeah, not hard to avoid, but it does catch people off guard sometimes"

DarkSouls2,3dtqt5,theamazingroberto,6,Sun Jul 19 13:55:47 2015 UTC,"This guy is my nemesis, so what I learned while fighting him again and again:   ADP, as mentioned above, is key. Try always to be on his flanks, but slightly behind him. Only one hit at a time (especially during the end of the fight). Take Ellie with you, sometimes she even staggers him. Go for physical damage, at least that helped me. Dark / fire defense helps as well. And well, I think dodging is very important, but still, physical defense is too. I always used a greatshield and it saved me more than once.  And as to learn his moveset: Always roll towards him and to his sides. I found the side of his greatsword to be easier, because of how slow th GS is and his small sword can´t hit you there. You can basically roll through all his attacks, especially through his 270-degree-swinger. But it is slightly delayed, so when you see him starting this move, you have to delay your rolling as well. And of course go for the three hits in the beginning, while he not moves."

DarkSouls2,3dtqt5,MrTurleWrangler,9,Sun Jul 19 22:45:58 2015 UTC,"Try and stick to physical damage. The way I find it nice and easy is use a rapier, two hand it and stick on that Old Leo Ring. I was doing about 400 DMG per counter hit (hit him after he attacks) with a +10 rapier and 40 DEX/STR with a RoB +1. Really it's just learning his attacks and dodging everything. This is a boss you don't wanna use a shield for since you'll be left with no stamina. Try o only hit once or twice with the rapier though since you don't wanna leave yourself with next to no stamina."

DarkSouls2,3dtqt5,xXAnonymousEnigmaXx,2,Sun Jul 19 11:43:57 2015 UTC,I'd go for a great club if you're going for a strength weapon. It swings faster and in the second phase Fume Knight jumps around a lot and doesn't leave many openings.

I guess it's due to the fact that people only see it as a ""turtle"" weapon, and believe that is all its useful for?  Makes for some pretty surprised individuals when they see me without a shield, running at them faster than Sonic.  Alternatively maybe it's due to the lack of a moveset.

Out of most of my invasions, about 1/2 are Katanas, 3/8 is Rapiers, 1/16 is Santiers and 1/16 is something I haven't seen before.   Never actually seen a spear afaik.   Hope I got my math correct.

DarkSouls2,3duwep,OffhandZweihander,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:14:55 2015 UTC,"They are the best. People don't use them because they aren't good at spacing, so their entire advantage goes away.   The other thing that makes Spears hard to use but is vital to them is move canceling. The partizan and silverblack spear can backstep and roll cancel almost every attack, including a backstep attack (very rare in this game). Combined with their range, this gives them an advantage for their damage and low counter strength."
DarkSouls2,3duwep,KijaJouteh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:54:27 2015 UTC,Spears are definitely good but there is no much variety with them compared to other weapons. You also have to play reactive to win and that is boring.  I much prefer the lance as it is challenging and hard to master.

DarkSouls2,3dtknk,Pajeration,2,Sun Jul 19 13:49:37 2015 UTC,I like both. But the bone scythe is a Str weapon and the great scythe is a dex weapon

DarkSouls2,3dtknk,NoIHavent235,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:18:30 2015 UTC,"Its pretty good. The sweet spot mechanic is pretty rough though, you have to have good spacing to get the most out of the damage. If you don't hit with the tip of the blade you get reduced damage.   The 2HR2 spin is fantastic, but it uses a lot of stamina and therefore is easy to punish.  Basically if you want to use it, you just have to practice with it. Its not something you can pick up and immediately do great with like a katana or a straight sword. The animation cancels are good as well, as with any reaper"
DarkSouls2,3dtknk,fromplsnerf,5,Sun Jul 19 20:56:52 2015 UTC,"Majestic Greatsword will always be the king of fun. Flips are just way too cool.  Crypt Blacksword is my all time favourite, most attacks can be aimed 180 degrees when unlocked. The damage is nothing to mess with either, even uninfused and unbuffed.  The Murakumo is also a monster. Those super parries are great, and the amount of mixups are endless. The enemy never ever sees the same thing twice.  Also Scythe of want, looks badass, and can be fun to use. Landing the 2h r2's are fun . Plus the parry animations for it are super cool."

Full Raime's armor in addition to the Fume Ultra Greatsword in one hand and a Longsword in the other (mainly because it's moveset is very versatile - hated, I know).   I tend to play pretty offensively on most people with it, and mix up the attacks quite often. Even if they've fought me before they're never really sure what to look out for due to the fact that it's so versatile and interchangeable.   Much more fun getting a win with that than buffing / sacred oath for an easy kill. Would recommend checking it out, I also posted a short video on it a few days ago I've enjoyed it so much :)"

DarkSouls2,3dtknk,Pajeration,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:57:31 2015 UTC,"Play unlocked.   2 handed: The R2s can spin around about 180 degrees, so use them well. The R1s are slower than you think, use this to catch rolls. No-one expects the follow up R1, and the step forward on the second R1 can avoid katana running attacks, and then hit them with the hammer.. The running attack can be well aimed, and the rolling attack covers a longer arc than you'd expect  1 handed: The R1 comes out surprisingly quickly. The R2 is almost the same movement, but comes out surprisingly slowly (use this for parry fishers). The running attack is that of a normal club and often catches rolls  Most importantly, just practice. It's very similar to the lion greataxe actually, but a bit slower"

DarkSouls2,3dtknk,baiosss,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:55:18 2015 UTC,"Not quite as much. I think the only greathammer that shares the iron king hammer's moveset is the Sacred Chime Hammer, which I'd advise against, because you lose that awesome turnable 2HR2  However, it sort of does work with a lot. I love the drakekeeper's greathammer too, and the same principle applies, wide R1s, turnable R2s when two handed  If you've never used greathammers, they take some getting used to. A lot of baiting and predictive play, for example, I often use a 2H running attack into a 2HR1. The running attack is vertical, so they roll to the side, think they're safe, and then they get hit by the R1"

Halberd was by far my favorite weapon in DS1, so it's not surprising I like Syan's in DS2.  Sun Sword, just a DS1 Longsword with really awesome scaling.  Basically the Shortsword's big brother.  Shortsword, for the same reasons I like Sun Sword.  A bit faster, a fair bit weaker.  1hR2's are so much fun.  Poke, poke, poke.  Heide Greatlance.  Hard as fuck to obtain unless you're lucky, but looks great and is ridiculous on Faith builds.  Lance moveset is awesome, nailing people with backstep R1 never gets old.  Dragonslayer Spear.  It's baaaaaack!  Kind of the same as the DS1 version except you can't really afford to spam the R2's without chugging repair dust constantly.  Stabbing someone with an R2 results in huge damage.  Sanctum Mace.  Greathammer with the backstep R1's of a lance, and it poisons the shit out of everything?  I'm sold.  Demands a very specific style of build (you need lots of poison resist on yourself and shit like Sanctum Knight gloves, Rat King seal, etc to amp your poison attack) but it's really fun to run a build with this weapon.  If you have enough poison attack bonuses and/or used poison resin, landing a backstep R1 will guarantee someone gets poisoned, and then you can punish the moss use with regular attacks, or buff yourself, etc."

DarkSouls2,3dtknk,Blast373,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:25:05 2015 UTC,"Heide Greatlance is just the Heide Lance but bigger.  Less physical damage and more lightning damage, I think.  Orny's spear is somewhat low damage but makes up for it by looking cool as fuck and the lightning bolt R2's.  If you stab someone with an R2 they take damage from both the spear and lightning bolt and it hits them for eleventy billion damage.  Bring repair powder.  Using some variation of the heide lance, heide spear, or even heide sword and buffing it will probably be more effective than Orny's spear but they don't look nearly as good while doing it."

Pyromancy can be thrown into any build  Sorceries - excluding BS ice rapier, blue flame with CMW is really good  For melee, do you want dex, strength, or quality?

DarkSouls2,3dues9,Ansarricade,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:00:23 2015 UTC,"Dance of Fire and Flame Swathe are what I see as set-up spells meaning your main use of them should be to make your opponent move and hit them with the follow up attack. Examples would be casting Dance of Fire and as they roll into you use Great Combustion or throwing out Flame Swathe and then hitting them with Fire Snake as they roll away.  For turtles, I'd suggest having a Shotel on you. Good weapon and it has the shield piercing attack. Can't really do much with just pure Pyros. Besides, it's good to have a regular weapon if someone casts Profound Still and you're stuck with no real attacks for 30 seconds or whatever it is.  Also, wearing the Old Iron King Crown to get back spell casts is useful. Really helpful for ganks or invasions that end up lasting a long time."
DarkSouls2,3dues9,KijaJouteh,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:35:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure about the OIK Crown, the +1 cast that the saint's hood gives is pretty important, especially for outcry and forbidden sun. As for side weapons, I only have enough stats to wield the parrying dagger, which I didn't end up using much because if I miss I'm at risk of losing most of my health because of how squishy this build is. I did notice how the parrying dagger affects the mentality of your opponents though, they tend to attack a lot less and are generally more cautious."

DarkSouls2,3dxdd8,Ansatsu_Kokoro,6,Mon Jul 20 09:46:43 2015 UTC,So in short: You're salty cause you lost to an invader who used the terrain to his advantage rather than a 1 vs 1 honorabu duel? Props to the invader.

Go do a ""fair fight"" via those fair methods I listed above then, invasions are designed as nothing but griefing. This is the problem with people who join the community lately, they keep throwing in these rules they believe must be followed in fights. I'm fairly certain that if you invaded someone and they where currently fighting PvE enemies, you'd let them finish, heal up and re-buff up, and bow before fighting you. And you see nothing wrong with that? You never played Demon's Souls did you? Hiding deep within a level in ambush is a huge rush, more so if they have helpers with them. You've never fully broken someone elses gear? Baited someone to attack their own npcs? Killed someone via terrain based traps? Why do you think it has to be fair? Think about the word ""Invasion"" for a moment, do you think Hitler invaded to look for a fair fight? Again, i suggest you stick to RSS/dragonbro or the arenas. Are 3 methods of consented PvP not enough for you? Leave the orbs for when you feel like a sadistic bastard."

DarkSouls2,3dxdd8,danby,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:16:15 2015 UTC,"It isn't ganking, their goal is to get you through the level. This also means killing invaders. I always think of ganking as summoning someone on the bridge in Iron Keep and having other phantoms around to kill him. You are trying to progress, he is an obstacle therefore should be dealt with. Not to mention he used the enemies to his advantage. He trolled you hard and you fell for it."
DarkSouls2,3dxdd8,KajusX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:32:00 2015 UTC,"I was seeing it from the invader's perspective, not yours.  Not easy to distinguish between sporty summons who wait for the duel to play out and normal gankers at a first glance."
DarkSouls2,3dxdd8,KajusX,0,Mon Jul 20 09:19:43 2015 UTC,"They'd rather be a true sunbro than be a real bro and help you out? It's a gank if there's gankers summong RSS in the Keep. You, however, were just trying to get through the level. They should have helped you.  I was co-oping with my GF like a week ago and Chariclea (the streamer) invaded her. I was like 'mafagga hands off ma gurl' and rekt his shit."
DarkSouls2,3dxdd8,KajusX,0,Mon Jul 20 09:21:32 2015 UTC,"They actually came in mid fight, so that's why they didn't join in. If they would've came in before he invaded, he'd be dead.   Yesterday I was helping lady friend through Drangleic when she was invaded. I go into full beast mode when I'm a summon, contrary to my reactive play style when I'm the host. Needless to say, he got lots of buffed Fire Possessed Armor Sword to the face. When I say lots, I mean it. He took a while to get down but he fell."

DarkSouls2,3duk3f,SilkyJohnston13,2,Sun Jul 19 21:37:16 2015 UTC,Yes the Agape Ring it absorbs the souls you collect instead of you it just keeps your soul memory low.

DarkSouls2,3duk3f,Thalnagath,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:22:35 2015 UTC,"Should definitely pick up SOTFS.  Definitely worth the $20/$30 upgrade price.  New DX11 lighting effects are shiny and new monster/item placement can be pretty interesting, also that's where most everyone is now.  Agape Ring is the new ring you're thinking of.  Sold by Straid of Olaphis, when worn it prevents you from earning any souls, so it prevents your Soul Memory from increasing.  Very useful if you need to stay at a certain SM level for summoning/invading, but even with dedicated sunbroing my SM has never gotten so high I have trouble getting summoned for bosses people usually want help with.  More useful for keeping your SM static once you reach the ""endgame"" for PvP, or keeping it low so you can fight or help other onebros, etc."

Actually the hardest ones I found to get were the large shards in early/mid game. Of course you can buy an infinate number of them, but its not smart to do that because of soul memory.

DarkSouls2,3du8b3,ytpies,3,Mon Jul 20 11:33:40 2015 UTC,"Nope. The Sorcerer's Twinblade, Blue Flame, and Pilgrim's Spontoon can also cast Sorceries, so if you wanted Sword/Board+Sorcery you could use one of those. Otherwise, the Sanctum Shield is the only shield that can do it (though it doesn't do a particularly good job of being a staff)"
DarkSouls2,3du8b3,ytpies,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:30:22 2015 UTC,i would like to use the shield because id be able to buff my weapon with it.  Also how good are these that you listed?
DarkSouls2,3du8b3,lordfaultington,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:06:49 2015 UTC,"Of the three, the Blue Flame is probably the better option, and by far the one you see the most. It has the R1 moveset of the Heide Sword, so it attacks quite quickly, but it does have a short range (not that that matters when you can cast spells with it).  I can't give you an honest judgment on the Twinblade, because I've never actually used it. It has the standard Twinblade moveset, if you like that sort of thing, and fairly high physical requirements. I recommend watching a few analysis videos on it, since I can't tell you whether or not it's any good. Be aware, though, that its requirements were changed in a patch, so if the commentator starts complaining about its high Faith requirement, ignore them.  Finally, the Spontoon. I probably shouldn't have even listed this one down, considering it requires 30 Faith. I'll give you a quick rundown of it anyway, but it is meant more for hexing than sorcery, and if you had the Faith to wield it, you could just use the Sanctum Shield. It's actually a really good weapon. It's a Spear, so you can use it to get good distance from your opponent, and it does very high damage if you get your spacing right and hit with the sweet spot. It doesn't do any physical damage, though - its base damage is purely Magic and Dark, so this weapon is ruined by anyone who uses Great Magic Barrier.  If you want something to buff your weapon with, you have a couple of options:   Just carry a staff in your second left hand slot, and switch from your shield when you want to buff. The Witchtree Branch has the lowest weight and the fastest cast times, so use that. You can carry a Blue Flame in your left hand. You won't be able to use it as a shield, but you'll have access to it's full powerstanced moveset and you'll be able to buff and cast spells with it when not powerstanced.  Dual wielding Blue Flames is also an option. Again, you won't be able to block but you'll be able to buff both weapons at once. Because of this, your powerstanced attacks will do very high damage, since both of your weapons will have the damage increase, rather than just the one in your right hand."
DarkSouls2,3du8b3,ytpies,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:58:48 2015 UTC,"To be honest the Blue Flame just isn't worth it, I upgraded it to full and it did a pittance of both sorcery damage and actual hitting damage, and cost me a fortune in twinkling titanite to do it."
DarkSouls2,3du8b3,ScHmIdTy56789,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:12:56 2015 UTC,"Did you infuse it? What are your stats like? Did you remember to buff it? I know I sound like a ""git gud"" kind of commenter, but you're probably using it wrong. The Blue Flame tends to hit for about average damage for an innate magic weapon, and considerably more than an infused regular one. It's also capable of temporarily becoming a better staff than the Staff of Wisdom when you buff it with CMW. It's an incredibly powerful weapon."

DarkSouls2,3dt8x2,Maid-with-a-pillow,3,Sun Jul 19 20:42:41 2015 UTC,"Crappy weapon in DkS1?  I'd have to respectfully disagree.  Flip CB was one of the strongest builds in the game.  Near instant R1s with stupid good recovery frames tied in with flip.  Range was ridiculous.  Phantom range even more so.    Only real things that could beat a good CB user was someone rapier turtling, perhaps a spear/flip or poise stabbing.  If it wasn't for the 160 counter strength, I'd say it was overall a worse weapon in 2."

DarkSouls2,3dt8x2,noscoe,2,Sun Jul 19 19:17:50 2015 UTC,"If you are having specific problems against the chaos blade, remember the strengths and weaknesses of the weapon. It has 160 counter damage. So don't trade with it, you will lose the trade unless you're using poise and an UGS.   Katanas have crappy range and no poke on the roll, even the washing pole for most of the attacks. Learn to use a spear (partizan or silverblack) and just dont trade on running attacks.  Havel's doesn't have much of a downside at really high SM, but otherwise again-- focus on the strengths and weaknesses. Someone wearing full Havel's is probably going to win trades because of their defence, but is not regenerating stamina very fast or rolling super far. Get in their face, make them roll / attack / use stamina any way possible. When you have a sense they are low on stamina, turn on the fucking kill button and chase them. They will panic roll and you will punish it when you learn."

I view it as a clear indication of scrubbery, hence why I think it's wrong.  Spamming anywhere between 6-10 miracles is just idiotic and time consuming. I'm not going to walk into them and it's extremely easy to dodge the one lightning bolt that tracks me, so it's just a waste of my time to sit back and wait for him to spam himself out.   I prefer the simplicity of running a swordsman build without magic with the only exception being that I use a buff if my enemies start off doing the same, hence my annoyance with the random resorting to magic spam."

YOU are the scrub here, not them.  A ""scrub"" is someone who conjures artificial rules and limitations, applies them to others, and then gets upset when others do not abide by these arbitrary, made-up rules.  If we're talking about BoB duels, there's absolutely nothing wrong with healing.  There's a reason the arenas have places you can duck out of line of sight of your enemy, juke around corners and sprint up stairs, drop down from bridges and structures, etc.  Heals take a long time to cast and you're incredibly vulnerable while you're casting one - you can't cancel the animation once you kneel down, even a basic Heal (which only heals 450 HP, barely a drop in the bucket at SL 150-200) takes about three seconds without pumping Attunement or wearing Blue Clearstone Ring +2, which gives the other dude plenty of time to backstab you, peg you with poison knives or literal toxic shit, apply their own buffs, heal themselves, or just line up a headshot with a bow or crossbow to stagger you out of the cast.  If we're talking about RSS duels on the bridge or whatever, then I really have no idea why you have problems with healing since it's extremely difficult to avoid someone long enough to actually complete the cast time for a heal."

One of the biggest elements of CoC is not being able to summon help for bosses so it makes perfect sense for bosses to be the source for Awestones.

However, if I invade someone on the iron keep bridge at 5mil sm, they're not doing pve, they are looking for pvp with an excuse to chug, ""oh, he invaded me, it's okay to heal"""
DarkSouls2,3dt8x2,Thalnagath,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:22:37 2015 UTC,There are no rules for invasions. Put your RSS if you want your honorabru duels
DarkSouls2,3dt8x2,Dead_man_sitting,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:30:53 2015 UTC,lol. There is no difference between a rss duel and someone purposefully pulling invaders. They are willingly engaging in pvp
DarkSouls2,3dt8x2,Thalnagath,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:38:15 2015 UTC,Except RSS has been for honorabru duels since DS1. That's the understood use for the item and is even described as such by the game
DarkSouls2,3dt8x2,Dead_man_sitting,2,Mon Jul 20 19:52:52 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. But as I said, how is looking for pvp via pulling invaders any different?"
DarkSouls2,3dt8x2,Thalnagath,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:46:13 2015 UTC,"Because they're invading, not being summoned.  You do understand that CREOs can invade in more places than just the area they're being used in, right?"

DarkSouls2,3dt8x2,Hewoki,5,Sun Jul 19 08:11:49 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't understand how people  think this game is more ""floaty"" than the first game. In this you come to a standstill almost instantly as soon as you let go of the stick/key.

Whether you use B or L3, jumping in this game is imprecise at best and frustrating and oh god just fuck that asshole.  Hardest thing to get used to in DS2, though, is the HUGE delay between ""raise shield, lower shield, can now attack.""  It's nearly instant in DS1 but I swear it's like at least half a second in DS2.  Drives me fucking crazy with weapons that can poke from behind a shield because you have to wait so fucking long to begin attacking if you don't want it to do a shield poke."

DarkSouls2,3dt8x2,Andkaer,2,Sun Jul 19 08:33:00 2015 UTC,"I have been training my parry skills this whole week, and in the process of this i've found a very annoying game bug or whatever it would be called.   It goes like this - I thrust with my spear, they roll past me, i rotate around so i face them, press parry and then they fucking backstab me! Even though i'm facing them, just because i'm only rotating and not like walking to turn around. It happens pretty often, and i find it so frustrating! Here i am working hard to learn to parry but the fucking game mechanics just fucks me over again and again, and i can't seem to get out of this habit!  I just wanted to be good at parries :'("
DarkSouls2,3dt8x2,LumpyArryhead,4,Sun Jul 19 12:34:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's basically this thing you have to learn about Dark Souls PvP where like... if you don't fully get the fuck away from whatever they were trying to do, then it doesn't matter how well you sidestepped it or about-faced or whatever. If you're still in range (or were still in range a half second ago, really), you're fucked."
DarkSouls2,3dt8x2,Andkaer,3,Sun Jul 19 12:47:50 2015 UTC,"But i know how to pvp i would even say i'm good at it, and i have learned when to dodge to avoid phantom range attacks and all that, but i just think it is the worst when my character is face to face with my opponent and then they backstab me. That just takes all the immersion of an otherwise great pvp game out for me..."
DarkSouls2,3dt8x2,LumpyArryhead,4,Sun Jul 19 12:54:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's basically just... if you are still in range of something they've tried to do to you, it doesn't matter where you are in that range, where you're facing, or anything. Once they've gotten to where they can initiate the action, there is no way to escape but iframes or distance."
DarkSouls2,3dt8x2,Zupanator,2,Sun Jul 19 12:57:29 2015 UTC,"It works different than DkS1. Here if they do the backstab animation it literally trumps everything. Parries, attacks, rolls, you name it. Unless you turn around lightning fast 99/100 times you will get face stabbed regardless. So they register its a potential backstab and even if you turn around or block it registers contact after they started the back punch animation and gives them the backstab. Best bet is to just roll away. I've tried backstepping and parrying and I still get facesstabbed all the time. Just roll away, you can't avoid it."
DarkSouls2,3dt8x2,Thalnagath,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:15:05 2015 UTC,"I think what specifically happens is if the little punch connects and does damage, it automatically awards a backstab... even if the punch hits the person's face.  I've seen this happen on monsters in PvE - I'll be starting the punch, they do some kind of move to instantly spin around and face me, the punch connects, and suddenly their back is to me and getting stabbed."
DarkSouls2,3dt8x2,Zupanator,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:22:28 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much it, the game reads a backstab so it punches and even if you alter away the placement of your back all the punch has to do is make contact."

DarkSouls2,3dt8x2,SirBadAssALot,2,Sun Jul 19 22:11:12 2015 UTC,Those loyce knights at the old chaos might be difficult but I'm utterly baffled by the sheer amount of odd choices those allies make.   When I attack they attack something else. If they attack they do so briefly. When they stop attacking they raise their shields and idle around with the back to the enemy as if there is nothing to worry about. They don't attack single targets but switch constantly and get themselves stunlocked to death. They don't dodge and take any hit that comes their way without a care in the world.  The enemy on the otherhand swiftly singles me out as a high profile target. They focus most of their force on me and will do so in a manner that quickly and permanently decapicitate me. If I attack they will attempt to dodge and retaliate or make use of the opening and attack me in an inattentive moment.

DarkSouls2,3drm7y,Drunkbag,30,Sun Jul 19 07:01:43 2015 UTC,Hate metas. They force so much of the interesting experiences and gameplay out of service until all you have left is the nasty spraycan cheese of gaming.
DarkSouls2,3drm7y,Ratstomper,3,Sat Jul 18 20:26:47 2015 UTC,"omg this so much! I've been saying that for YEARS since DeS. Takes the joy out of figuring shit out for yourself. Whats funny is once a new strat is displayed on youtube, you can be sure that 50% of invasions are gonna be that new meta.   And you know why the metas (even the not so good ones) work anyway? Invaders are usually invading some poor dude trying to fight PvE...I for one can't be bothered to hurriedly switch all my gear every time I get invaded. I'd rather roll off the edge if I'm near a bonfire (can't be bothered to play offline lol)"
DarkSouls2,3drm7y,zombieHunterq8,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:23:02 2015 UTC,"I pretty much just have one set that my character uses for everything. In fact, part of the fun of the game, imo, is using that set creatively enough to win whether it's PvE or PvP. If I get invaded, I get worried, not because I have to fight someone else, but because I know videogames are a place where you can easily abuse statistical advantages or buggy, cheap mechanics to win.  I want my fights to be epic and my wins to feel like I earned them."
DarkSouls2,3drm7y,Ratstomper,2,Sun Jul 19 17:35:05 2015 UTC,"Tried heroes of the store the other day, no meta to be seen (probably because my account is new) It was so chill and fun."
DarkSouls2,3drm7y,Bronze_Bound,8,Sun Jul 19 00:10:02 2015 UTC,"The meta is generally more for how the map is played, rather than character choices.  There is definitely a meta related to picking the correct talents/ultimates, but they're a lot harder to notice someone picking wrong, so it's not picked up in-game."
DarkSouls2,3drm7y,Osmodius,3,Sun Jul 19 02:53:08 2015 UTC,"The thing I hated about LoL was being forced (well, coerced/guilted) into playing a style or character you don't know or want to play. It only worked on me a couple times and then people just got angry when I ignored them.  The joys of not knowing who you're playing with..."
DarkSouls2,3drm7y,Ratstomper,9,Sun Jul 19 03:23:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's that ridiculous notion that if you don't do what the top league players do, you're doing it wrong.  Despite the fact that thee majority of people play at such a low level, it doesn't matter who or what they're playing.  Best example I've seen was Destiny's Starcraft 2 series where he only built Queens (basic production units) and managed to get all the way to some relatively high rank.   If you're good, the meta doesn't matter because you're better than most people, if you're not, the meta doesn't matter because you're not good enough to take advantage of the meta."
DarkSouls2,3drm7y,Osmodius,4,Sun Jul 19 03:55:15 2015 UTC,"It's tough in MOBAs because so much of your effectiveness relies on your team. If you do something against the norm, it's an easy target to blame for a loss. I used to run non-typical builds (AP TF, attack damage udyr before that became a thing) in LoL a lot and met with moderate/good success most of the time.   But that doesn't stop people being petty, nitpicking, feeding out of spite, etc. Eventually I said ""screw it"" and stopped playing."
DarkSouls2,3drm7y,Ratstomper,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:03:57 2015 UTC,"I think it's a fair complaint, just that people blow it out of proportion to an insane degree.  Yes, if you play outside the meta, you're going to be dragging your team down, as the meta has been pretty much proven to be the best at the moment.  But of course, if you're playing in Silver or Gold or hell, anything below Masters, there's plenty you could be doing that would be more impactful than blindly following the meta."
DarkSouls2,3drm7y,Osmodius,3,Sun Jul 19 04:09:57 2015 UTC,The problem I have with that is that the meta that's proven to be best is often dethroned by things that aren't the meta until they're the meta.   I just would prefer to live in a world where people played how they want to play and grow as individuals. Adhering to meta is like painting by number and it doesn't take long to get sick of the same picture. I have no desire to play with someone else's plans or tactics .  EDIT: and I NEVER played ranked for this very reason.
DarkSouls2,3drm7y,Ratstomper,4,Sun Jul 19 04:18:31 2015 UTC,"Well that's the other thing, if people wanna play hardcore play-to-win, fucking keep it in Ranked.  If I'm playing blind-pick normal modes, I'm probably playing for fun, not to win."
DarkSouls2,3drm7y,Osmodius,2,Sun Jul 19 04:24:01 2015 UTC,Sounds cool. I used to play LoL a lot and got tired of seeing the same old stuff every time.  That and the people really got on my nerves.
DarkSouls2,3drm7y,Ratstomper,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:36:27 2015 UTC,I'd highly recommend Heroes then. It takes out a lot of the more annoying features of other MOBAs that make them hard to get into.

DarkSouls2,3drm7y,Dan479,2,Sun Jul 19 10:46:28 2015 UTC,"I argued with someone about this very thing with Chivalry: Medieval Warfare. What happens is people get so concerned with being MLG pro at a game that they just completely abandon the spirit of the gameplay. Its what ultimately kills off the PvP until all that's left are the ultra tryhards who are just abusing the game mechanics to their fullest extent.  Or, to put it in terms of the classic archetypes, the ""Spikes"" come in and ruin the game for everyone."
DarkSouls2,3drm7y,bodamerica,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:17:18 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting categorization. I think I personally fall into the johnny/spike category.  It's a thing that happens in games. Someone is always going to find statistical advantages and say screw everything else. They'll spam ""welcome"" or ""mock"" after wins like they've accomplished something, but in reality they're practically playing a different game.  It's like playing chess with checkers rules and then spiking the board after you've won. The only way I can think of to counteract it is for the developers to impose tradeoffs somehow. Hard level capping would probably be easiest. If people only have a certain amount of points to spend, then they're forced to specialize, which means they have weaknesses to offset their strengths. If people can max out all relevant stats, then you get mages in havels and all that nonsense."

Easy weapons to get early would be the mace or the craftmans hammer.  Also it is very important to kill the lords 1 at a time, then take out the skeletons that they spawn.

A balanced spread (i.e. 30/30) favours hexes, whereas 60/0 would favour sorceries, and 0/60 would favour miracles.  If you're looking to use a big sword, you'll need to appropriate stats to use it.  You need to think about what you'd like to use moving forwards. Do you want to ultimately be a character that can take a few hits and smash things with a big sword? If so, you'll need to reallocate points into strength, some into dex (depending on the weapon requirements) and then yeah, some into vit/end for a decent health pool and stamina for those rolls and swings. Points into adaptability would be good for rolling too.  Praise the sun is related to the gesture used by members of this covenant (clicky)."

You'll be able to find more titanite as you progress through the game.  How much progress have you actually made? I made and re-made a handful of characters before I actually kept one or two and made serious progress with them.  It's completely up to you, half the fun is in the experimenting. I have a few different save files for different build types, so I can mess with different stat investments and weapons, and so that I can have a few different play styles to swap between when I feel like it."

DarkSouls2,3duv9a,TheKingslayer420,2,Sun Jul 19 19:57:45 2015 UTC,I would go for a quality build but skew more so towards strength. Get your Vgr and End to 20 and get your strength up to 30 and your Dex at about 20. Your Vit is fine where it's at but you'll need to increase that as you go so you can use heavier equipment and obviously get rid of your attunement points all together for now. From then on just make sure you keep increasing your dex and strength but have about 10 points more strength then Dex.

It's kind of a shame how small the bleed damage is. 200 is not impressive.

DarkSouls2,3dqu6g,nighght,3,Sat Jul 18 19:09:02 2015 UTC,"Imho they should've made possible to bleed enemies constantly without that 20 seconds to clean the bleed bar, considering how fast you can bleed enemies you could bleed them like two times per combo."
DarkSouls2,3dqu6g,Albatrosk2,2,Sat Jul 18 19:40:23 2015 UTC,"That would have been acceptable as well. As it is, a paltry 200 damage and such a long cooldown make Bleed only marginally useful for PvE.

DarkSouls2,3dtraq,Mystoic,3,Sun Jul 19 11:18:35 2015 UTC,"What is success? Winning more than half the time?  If so just going pure strength (with healthy sides of vitality and endurance to keep swinging) was shockingly effective with some of the unloved Str build weapons because people just don't know how to react to them more than half the time. Good players do, but I also have a Craftsman's Hammer, which isn't the BEST weapon ever, but it's pretty damn good. My first playthrough was with a Mace, then that as a Cleric, so I know how to use the damn things. Then I used one a lot as my ""boring but practical"" rope a dope/hammer and board build for deliberately approaching and punishing NPC enemies to death with crits and back stabs.  But seriously, a lot of people don't seem to know how to react to the Demon's Great Hammer, especially at certain ranges. It's kind of funny. I also had some degree of success with the Sanctum Greathammer because it's kind of weird, and not a great favorite. I also sort of like how the armor looks, so that's fun.  I also won more than half the time as a Ratbro Cleric using the boring but practical art of ambushing people who get hung up on rats and Mastodons with an opening of acid and toxic, and then throwing around lightning like it's Christmas and I'm Lightning Santa. People don't move fast in water, so it kind of works. You can also readily get behind people with one of several anti fall things. Or you know, let them muddle around through the whole level. I liked the throughput of do or die in the first chamber though."

I uninfused my claws and kept the other bleed stuff on for the most unfair fist build yet. There's no softcap on Bleed BNS and claws are overkill when bleed infused anyways, a so a total glass cannon gets the most benefit overall. Extra damage that is like 2/3 as efficient as sacred oath point for point, except it is permanent, and extra bleed on top of that which is, you guessed it, more damage. Throw in spidersilk and hunters blackbow because none of this stuff weighs anything and you can have a nice little loadout. I've tried putting those 19 points elsewhere, but there isn't really much to practically gain.

For chime-based hexes, though, you're gonna want to go with Caitha's Chime.  Best one-handed weapon would probably be something like Fume Sword: natural Dark damage, good moveset, loves getting Dark Weapon buffed etc. Silverblack Spear is also reeeally good for the same reasons."

DarkSouls2,3dtdji,ytpies,2,Mon Jul 20 01:51:10 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend you aim for 50/50 (if you're going omnimage, pure Hex builds only need 30/30). It lets you hit the hardcaps for all four of your elemental attack bonuses, whereas your 60/45 spread slightly gimps your Dark and Lightning bonuses while barely improving your Magic bonus. If you desperately want Crystal Soul Spear, Focus Souls, Soul Geyser, Unleash Magic, or Dark Greatsword, you can always spice them down.  Your Catalyst choice is up to you. Sunset Staff and the Staff of Wisdom get you the highest damage output (aside from Azal's Staff, but that has its own problems), but mean you'll have to carry both if you want to use both types of magic. Personally, I prefer the Witchtree Branch for its higher cast speed and ability to cast utility spells from both schools, but that's just me. The Dark Witch Staff can cast anything that isn't a Pyromancy, but has worse stats overall, and the Sanctum Shield does the same and doubles as a shield, but kind of sucks as a Catalyst.  Caitha's Chime has the same deal as the Sunset Staff/Staff of Wisdom. Use it if you don't plan on using any Miracles. The Chime of Want nets you the same damage output in exchange for a slower cast time, while the Dragon Chime gets you the highest Miracle damage. If you only want to use utility Miracles that aren't affected by your Catalyst, choose the Dark Chime of Want. If you want to sling both Sunlight Spears and Great Resonant Souls, use either Caitha's and the Dragon Chime (for maximum damage output, but you'll have to constantly switch chimes), or the uninfused Chime of Want (less damage output overall, but you'll only have to carry one chime). The Black Witch's Staff is also an option, but I don't like it. The convenience of not having to switch weapons is nice, but to me it isn't worth the drop in speed or power.  Due to your high magic stats you can use any weapon with innate elemental damage, but those levels have to come from somewhere, so you'll be hurting for STR/DEX. Weapons like the Fume Sword may sound appealing, but unless you want to be grossly overlevelled or a massive glass cannon 15/22 is pretty unattainable. You need weapons with high elemental scaling but low requirements. Ones to consider are the Pilgrim's Spontoon (11/12), Blue Flame (13/15), Retainer's Shortsword (11/15), Chaos Rapier (7/14), Heide Sword (11/10), Scythe of Nahr Alma (14/12), and the Silverblack Spear (9/16). Also consider infusing a regular weapon to get the requirements even lower, since with those stats your melee weapon should be a sidearm anyway. The Foot Soldier Sword will give you the same moveset as the Fume Sword, but won't require you to spend many levels to wield it. A personal favourite of mine is the Thief Dagger. It has barely any requirements at all, has a really nice moveset, and as a dagger it gives you powerful critical attacks, which is most of what an omnimage wants from a melee weapon. If you want I can give you more information about each weapon I listed, but this has turned into a wall of text, and I'm sure you know enough about each one to make a decision on your own."
DarkSouls2,3dtdji,ytpies,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:07:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the help!  Only thing I'd ask is for a bit more info on the melee weapons. With sorceries for magic, hexes for dark, and sunlight spear and the occasional lightning short bow for lightning, I was hoping for a fire damage melee weapon. I'd prefer to stick with a sword just because I'm most comfortable with the sword move sets. Which sword would you recommend for fire damage (innate or infused)?"
DarkSouls2,3dtdji,zgulick,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:51:37 2015 UTC,"The thing about innate Fire weapons is that they tend to have high physical requirements. There is a Fire-scaling straight sword - the Possessed Armor Sword - but it requires 20 Strength to use. Another option is the Chaos Rapier. It's a thrusting sword, but they behave similarly enough to straight swords that it's worth trying out.  If you want infusion, you'll get the benefit of rock-bottom stat requirements, at the cost of reduced damage. My recommendation is the Foot Soldier Sword. It has the DS1 Longsword's moveset, which it shares with the Fume and Sun Swords, two of the best weapons in the game. Its durability is very low, but you'll be doing most of your damage through spells, so it won't matter that much. Of course, if you enjoy using the Longsword, there's nothing stopping you from just using that."
DarkSouls2,3dtdji,adamacuo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:10:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I kinda figured I'd need to infuse a sword to avoid putting a lot of points into str/dex.

DarkSouls2,3dt1ap,Ratstomper,3,Sun Jul 19 04:37:15 2015 UTC,"Maybe. Honestly, it's not something I've ever thought about.   Maybe the warping of time space that allows players to play together also keeps the bodies ""fresh""? We also see a lot of bones/skeletons, so we know bodies should eventually rot.

DarkSouls2,3dsffb,ebonhawk01,4,Sun Jul 19 00:33:12 2015 UTC,"I find shields to mostly just get in the way for pve. Roll-dodge is where its at. generally takes less stamina to roll, and you don't get stunlocked behind the shield, so its easier to counterattack. Shields are nice tho for parrying, and blocking magic spam.  Just play how you like, and try different things. you will find a nice suite of equipment that will fill your role."
DarkSouls2,3dsffb,ketatrypt,3,Sun Jul 19 00:38:30 2015 UTC,"If you're talking about using them for PVE, then go for it. They come in handy but I don't usually bother with them.

DarkSouls2,3dsffb,Ratstomper,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:07:37 2015 UTC,"For the past couple of days I've been running through on my first mage character of the series, and I can say that having a shield only for the occasional parry is great compared to how I was playing prior. In DS1 I had a Black Knight Shield, which was amazing, almost game-breaking, in fact, and it allowed me to play that way, but in DS2, with the lack of accessible, high-Stability, 100%-block shields, it was always feeling like I was bieng forced to use the Drangleic Shield.   Thus far, I've gotten just to the start of Huntsman's Copse, and my other character is just inside Harvest Valley (I skipped the Chariot but killed the Skeleton Lords), and the only times I've wished I had build around sword-and-board are the ruin Sentinels. Dodging on the first area was hell and I occasionally took a hit I could have just blocked, but the extra damage I do, the fact I can roll so much farther and do it faster, and the fact I can cast tonnes of spells makes me feel it's better this way."
DarkSouls2,3dsffb,TheTweets,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:10:34 2015 UTC,"Not to get off topic, but how easy was it to transition from a melee to a caster? I'm thinking about making a mage, but I haven't messed with spells much. Is it fun/effective in your opinion?"
DarkSouls2,3dsffb,Ratstomper,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:14:56 2015 UTC,"Surprisingly easy. I hadn't played in about a week, though, so it may be that. Essentially I played melee by waiting until the enemy bounced off my shield and countering, but now I just wait until they attack, roll and stab them that way. It feels much more active, it allows me to avoid being stunlocked and I can always jsut nope out of it by rolling backwards instead of through them.  It's incredibly fun in certain situations, and a chore in others. for example, in the royal Soldier swarm, I would not be able to take on 7 of them in melee, but with liberal application of dodges and correct use of Great Heavy Soul Arrow followed by a single swipe, every single one died and I usually took no damage. On the other hand, most bosses are boring if you only use magic. The Last Giant was just a case of press LB until it died, while watching Luet and Pate have all the fun, occasionally dodging through a wide swing not even meant for me. In fact, I tend to do away with the magic in the boss fight themself - apply Magic Weapon to Fire Longsword, switch to Target Shield, dodge and if need be panic and parry (if possible). The damage is generally higher, I dont' use up spell casts and I get to have more fun fighting the boss. The same is the case for Invasions - I might occasionally poke them with a Soul Arrow or Dark Orb, to see if I can get a cheeky chip in before they do much, or to force them to dodge, using up stamina they might otherwise use hurting me, but for the most part it's all down to getting a parry and then doing massive riposte damage with Magic Fire Longsword."
DarkSouls2,3dsffb,TheTweets,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:32:31 2015 UTC,"Hmm, interesting. I'm relatively new to DS (compared to a lot of the people here) and I found blue flame in the crypts in my first run through of the game and made me want to do a sort of mostly-sorcerer, but also some pokey/slashy stuff build.   I'll definitely have to try it after I make a full reeve/orma shield tank."
DarkSouls2,3dsffb,Ratstomper,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:44:22 2015 UTC,Never used a shield. Cumulative about 1000 hours on Dark Souls 1 and 2. Never saw the need for one. Although they look cool on my back for the stamina regen. Too bad they don't prevent backstabs.

DarkSouls2,3dsffb,Multipwner,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:02:12 2015 UTC,"Shields can save your life in some situations. A shield will always take a hit, whereas you might mistime a roll or something. That's the tradeoff. As long as you have an agility of 99-105 and know most bosses' attacks and attack patterns, go for it. Hell, go for it if you don't, don't let me stop you."
DarkSouls2,3dsffb,Rajoovi1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:58:37 2015 UTC,"They are just another tool. Some attacks are best blocked, some are best rolled through. Don't underestimate the importance of stability, and keep in mind that an 80% block shield mitigates a lot more than what you'd think.  Are you talking about the Greatsword (UGS) or the weapon class? With greatswords I would use a medium shield. With the Greatsword I'd actually consider using a small shield and blocking with the blade in a pinch."

DarkSouls2,3dsffb,xXAnonymousEnigmaXx,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:42:38 2015 UTC,Well my recommendation is to get the blossom kite/slumbering dragon shield at ur offhand slot and 2hand it so you get slight extra stamina regen.
DarkSouls2,3dsffb,OblivionSol,0,Sun Jul 19 00:46:18 2015 UTC,"Two handing weapons is a bad idea. Not using a shield isn't terrible. No shield is one thing but saving Str points to only two hand certain weapons gimps you insanely by removing 1h movesets and making yourself extremely predictable in pvp. Going shield less isn't terrible but make sure you alternate between 1h and 2h to keep your moveset constantly shifting to keep your opponent on their toes. You could also try using small weightless shields. I use a shield to mostly gauge weapons phantom times and ranges then I can see what I can and can't avoid. I would suggest the small leather shield. It weighs a measly .5 lbs and has the benefits of an 80 phys block while also having the small shield parry frames.  I know that everyone says rolling is much more efficient but when so much of the meta is based around baiting and punishing too much rolling can become extremely predictable. Good players will abuse reactive rollers with animation cancels, baits and the like."

DarkSouls2,3dtrgc,Cold_damage,4,Sun Jul 19 11:21:23 2015 UTC,Check for orange border bonfires but my best experience is Kings Gate. It's a really common place for people to want summon help considering the mechanics for the boss fights. It's nice to have extra help when fighting two on one bosses to at least just act as a distraction. it's also beneficial because phantoms can't be cursed so they're useful for fighting Nashandra. I got my wretch status by invading Kings Gate for about 8ish hours in one day. There's so many people just hanging around the bonfire trying to be summoned or been there trying to find summons to help with bosses they're struggling against. My experience usually leads to everyone panic summoning ganks as soon as they see they're being invaded. So I constantly ran into ganks at kings gate. Give it a go.

Get Sunlight blade and sacred oath, and if you want to play more casting type you could attune some lightning spears, heavenly thunder, or really anything you want to use. As for weapons any lightning infused weapon with SLB buff on will do a lot of damage, especially if they have innate lightning damage, so heide weapons, dragonslayer spear, defender GS, etc. As for stats 40-50 in vigor, 30~ stamina, enough attunement for your spells, enough vitality to get below 50% carry weight, bring your adaptability to get at least 100 agility, ignore intelligence, enough faith to use your spells, although you could spice them down a little.

DarkSouls2,3dtm3r,ametalspoon,7,Sun Jul 19 09:41:53 2015 UTC,"You obviously didn't need the swap for the kill, so nice parry, but I generally see people swap to those crazy damage crit weapons and think it's kinda lame.    Reminds me too much of hornet ring from dks1 is all."

DarkSouls2,3dtm3r,Sweet_September,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:58:51 2015 UTC,"I agree.    Parrying is a fine mechanic and all — it's a risk vs. reward thing.  I will say that it could use some work — that riposte window is extra long to where you can roll away if you didn't realize in time and STILL come back and land your riposte.  That's my biggest gripe with parries.  Why do I lay helpless on the ground from a parry but I can get stunlocked for 1/10th of the time by an Ultra Greatsword?  Anyway, I don't really parry myself, but if you land a parry on me, good for you, it's considered fair and generally, if you're parrying me, you're better than me.    However, when you switch to a crit weapon right before your riposte, I always have to roll my eyes a little.  It's not that it's ""unfair"" per se, or any kind of ""dishonorable"" thing to do… it's just that, you're basically saying ""I want this fight over ASAP.""  Taking out 90% of health in one move is kind of distasteful to me.  Maybe it's just because I'm a claw obsessive and I can't really do very much damage at once so I rely on a good long duel to slowly chip away, not to mention I CAN'T parry with a claw.  It's alright though, no big deal, I'll respawn.  I just find it to be a quick way to suck the fun out of a good duel.    Now, people who parry you and then bow to you, THAT'S the mark of a pro.  And how humiliating when I get my ass handed to me anyway."
DarkSouls2,3dtm3r,Stalking_Panda,2,Sun Jul 19 13:28:56 2015 UTC,"My gripe with it is that when you swap to a fume ugs you get that massive damage, but never had to carry it around and deal with the weight.    I only parry swap to fume against gankers and chuggers, I don't play with those kids."

The running attack is delayed, so hits people as they roll away, and the rolling attack is fast and covers a wide arc"
DarkSouls2,3drmhd,Pajeration,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:09:20 2015 UTC,"I honestly prefer either the Black Dragon Greataxe or the Black knight greataxe, both have better reach, the same movset, and high damage output.

It feels slower . The R1 doesn't combo into the R2 well at all  Never tried the black dragon, but just looking at AR, it has a worse AR (pure physical), so the lion should hit harder? Long length would be a big bonus though, more forgiving on the R1s. Doesn't look anything like as cool as the lion though"
DarkSouls2,3drmhd,Pajeration,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:47:10 2015 UTC,"You need to hit with the blade of the greataxe so that you do full damage, really long weapons have a big disadvantage while up against aggressive players.

DarkSouls2,3drmhd,BeautifulDevil30,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:11:00 2015 UTC,"Problem is that the scaling lies on the weapon, it says S scaling in dex when it is more comparable to a D scaling, its moveset is the same as the longsword expect the heavy attacks, but the longsword still does more damage, and the whip attack for it (heavy) has a very tight sweet spot that even when you land it only does a good 150-180 damage at 30 dex at +5. At 40 dex +5 RoBFlynns your looking at really low ARs (mid 200s) which makes it hard to consider using compared to the standard longsword."

DarkSouls2,3dt5mt,PiggyBankofDespair,3,Sun Jul 19 05:39:35 2015 UTC,"The DLCs are so much more difficult than the main game in part because the enemies hit harder and take longer to go down but also because they play differently than the main game. Not that there's anything wrong with it, but the main game has a very straightforward ""hit the other guy until one of you is dead"" approach to combat. The DLC plays much more like the two previous Souls games in that basically requires trial and error and knowing your enemy and environment to succeed.  None of the three DLCs is without its share of ""Why the fuck would they do that"" moments, but for the most part they're actually very well-balanced and I think you'd be surprised how much the difficulty lets up once you start rethinking how you approach their obstacles. Also, if you're really struggling you may also want to consider that perhaps you need to level up or reinforce some of your gear."

This advice goes for all three DLC areas. The main, pain in the ass mobs in all three DLCs are suckers for Alluring Skulls and Yearn.  You can really pace the fights out. Alluring Skulls distract the enemies for five seconds. Yearn lasts for ten. But basically how it works is you angle that camera up and toss a Skull out, then go for the nearest enemy who has most likely turned their back to you because they're looking at the Skull's effect, allowing you to dispatch them. By the time the effect is over, they'll all notice you again, so just toss another Skull out and target the next most immediate threat. Rinse repeat until they're all dead.  Alluring Skulls and Yearn distract the Soldiers AND the Priestesses, which is nice if their hexes are giving you grief."

DarkSouls2,3dw2fy,jjf1978,11,Mon Jul 20 00:35:07 2015 UTC,So basically you want a trivially easy experience with people telling you where to go and what to do as well as two to three other players carrying you through a boss fight but the one feature designed to balance out the hand holding you're opposed to? Hmmm I wonder why.

DarkSouls2,3dw2fy,Brdman_dareal1,8,Mon Jul 20 22:21:52 2015 UTC,"I don't know.  While I love Bloodborne, I really miss the random invasions.  Getting invaded is REALLY terrifying, and it always seems to happen at a clutch moment.  I have now co-oped about 40 or so times in Bloodborne, and I think I have been invaded once.  I miss it."
DarkSouls2,3dw2fy,inermae,4,Mon Jul 20 00:38:02 2015 UTC,"Honestly, invasions and the way they work is the reason that Dark Souls 1 captured our hearts for four years now. The whole reason that Bloodborne's online community is pretty much dead right now is because the pvp is a convoluted mess that seemed to be thrown together at the last minute.   PvP was done the absolute best (humanity, orbs, turning human at bonfires) in dark souls 1 and if we see the return of that in dark souls 3 then this could be another game that the entire community can enjoy for years and years to come."
DarkSouls2,3dw2fy,TobiSouls,2,Mon Jul 20 01:38:04 2015 UTC,"""online community is pretty much dead""  Far from the truth. The only reason it appears that way is because random invasions are rare thanks to the convoluted system they have."
DarkSouls2,3dw2fy,Redingard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:20:41 2015 UTC,"Don't know why you were downvoted. BB is definitely not dead, lol. The pvp scene isnt dead, just nonexistent due to stupid bell maidens. I prefer DaS2 over it anyways, though."
DarkSouls2,3dw2fy,Brdman_dareal1,2,Mon Jul 20 22:21:17 2015 UTC,Not to mention that Invading is part of the lore itself eversince DeS. This game would not have anywhere near the amount of popularity it does today if there wasn't online PvP and invasion.
DarkSouls2,3dw2fy,Blood_Addled_Hoonter,2,Mon Jul 20 02:01:59 2015 UTC,"While i hate invasions,i have learnt to accept it and just fight to the death(or honorabru duel assuming the invader wants it)  I only hate script kiddoes and that reason is why i played offline for the first 2/3 great souls"
DarkSouls2,3dw2fy,OblivionSol,0,Mon Jul 20 00:43:43 2015 UTC,"Only time I was invaded in BB against my will was in the Nightmare Frontier, by the two hunters towards the beginning of the area. Nothing was more thrilling than that fight. Invading is part of what makes a Souls game a Souls game."
DarkSouls2,3dw2fy,Redingard,5,Mon Jul 20 00:47:45 2015 UTC,"I love Bloodborne. however, the lack of invasions really lowers my enjoyment. An invasion is a moment of intense action even if I'm at a disadvantage it never fails to get my heart going.  I love Invasions so much. Mages aren't really broken. When I finish my Pure-Mage I can certainly show how easy mages are to kill."
DarkSouls2,3dw2fy,Voidtalon,2,Mon Jul 20 00:42:54 2015 UTC,Same here. The bell system ruined Bloodborne for me.

DarkSouls2,3dw2fy,Brdman_dareal1,0,Mon Jul 20 22:27:01 2015 UTC,"It's not 50%, it's 30%. And it's better than not being able to heal unless you attune spells in DSII, IMO."

DarkSouls2,3dw2fy,TartarusRex0707_,3,Mon Jul 20 02:09:42 2015 UTC,"The game isn't going to cater to you so get used to it. Invasions have been a key part of Souls since the beginning, and you better believe they'll be back in DS3.   If you want to coop you either have to deal with the occasional invasion or burn an effigy.   Also, just because you're new/unprepared doesn't mean you can't win. I have over 1,600 hours in DS2 and I still die to hosts I invade all the time.   Invasions and PvP are a HUGE part of what keeps Souls games so active for so long after their release. Bloodborne shit on invasions, and Bloodborne is now dying a slow death while Dark Souls 1 and 2 flourish. Invasions are definitely here to stay.  I love posts like this."
DarkSouls2,3dw2fy,fromplsnerf,3,Mon Jul 20 00:50:45 2015 UTC,DS3 is going to lose far more players than it'll gain if they remove invasions
DarkSouls2,3dw2fy,moon_man_Cid,3,Mon Jul 20 00:56:34 2015 UTC,"While the invader may be prepared for PvP the host has several other (and in most cases better) advantages, like being able to heal, having phantoms to assist him and of course an invasion timer.  Invasions are a key feature of the Souls games and should never be removed. It's a unique feature that gives randomness and diversity to every playthrough resulting in more fun, more thrill, more action and in the end a higher replay value.  If you don't like it you can always play in offline mode or burn an effigiy."
DarkSouls2,3dw2fy,DrTobio,3,Mon Jul 20 00:56:52 2015 UTC,You're wrong.

DarkSouls2,3dw2fy,Blood_Addled_Hoonter,3,Mon Jul 20 01:58:50 2015 UTC,Summon someone to help  Use a Silver talisman and hide 'til their timer runs out  Use a Seed of a Tree of Giants and get mobs to kill them  Burn a Human Effigy to prevent invasions in the first place  Play in Offline mode to do the same  Go fight the area boss  Learn to actually fight them.   Those are your options. It's your own damn fault for not using them.
DarkSouls2,3dw2fy,Stealthrider,4,Mon Jul 20 06:26:42 2015 UTC,"Invasions are part of any souls game, better get used to it and enjoy it. That's why we invade: because it's fun. Getting invaded is fun too when you're prepared for it.  Magic users? Use a magic shield. Fast weapon? Use a fast weapon too. Or use seeds of a giant to turn the enemies against them and hide in cameleon form and laugh as they're getting wrecked by regular enemies.   There's plenty of tools for you to have tons of fun."

DarkSouls2,3dw2fy,KajusX,2,Mon Jul 20 01:06:54 2015 UTC,There are actually some clutch npc summons for some bosses though.
DarkSouls2,3dw2fy,OblivionSol,2,Mon Jul 20 01:18:26 2015 UTC,"For sure. I was speaking of other human player phantoms, but there are definitely npc summons that can do the trick with the right shepherding. Bringing three phantoms into a boss battle makes it all pretty damn easy."

DarkSouls2,3dw2fy,OblivionSol,2,Mon Jul 20 01:36:07 2015 UTC,"For sure. I liberally summon other players and npcs because it's fun to have company. I was only speaking of the three phantom summons because I'm on last-gen but watched my friend twitch stream his first SotFS playthru, and he tore through the bosses so fast with three helpers.  I just wrapped up my 10th playthru with a character and to mark the occasion I did the whole thing in the Company of Champions. Until that playthru, there were some bosses I had NEVER solo'd before (Fume Knight being one of them; got him on my fourth attempt!)."

DarkSouls2,3dw2fy,OblivionSol,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:00:32 2015 UTC,"My character is a sorcerer (edit: by choice at this point; her SL is around 675, so she's a bunch of stuff, but I stick with a INT/STR build; magic-infused Staff of Wisdom and a fully-upgraded Curved Nil or Drakekeeper Hammer), and by all accounts my Crystal Soul Spears did the most damage out of all of my options, but throughout all of her playthrus, I've always assisted others as well as done the fight with help by rolling around and getting in counter-hits with my Espada Ropera. I can usually dance around for the entire fight, but occasionally do get hit, but on max difficulty getting hit isn't an option at all. One hit kills are frequent.  So after three unsuccessful attempts, I stacked fire and dark defense (Flame Quartz and Dark Quarts Rings +3, Dispelling Ring +1, Warlock Mask, Black Witch Robes, Agdayne Cuffs, Chaos Boots) and finally won the fight by roll-evading his entire first phase with my rapier, then when he hit phase two I would quickly cast Great Magic Barrier with a Black Witch Staff in my left hand, then switch it back to my dark-infused Rampart Golem Shield (100% Dark defense and 90+% Fire defense), then picked my spots to cast CSSs at him whenever I could. It was intense."
DarkSouls2,3dw2fy,KajusX,2,Mon Jul 20 02:13:45 2015 UTC,"As nice as it would be to see them put more robust matchmaking requirements in DS3 (which they failed to do with soul memory in DS2), there's nothing stopping you from summoning your own phantoms to help you out if you're that afraid of invasions. Or, if you want to complete the game solo, then burn a human effigy."
DarkSouls2,3dw2fy,silenthunt,2,Mon Jul 20 00:59:11 2015 UTC,You need to embrace the invasions. I felt like you did about DS1 initially. Then I decided to embrace it. Now it's part of the fun!

Most gankers have abysmal skill in actual PvP and are probably wearing armor with really high defence, remember this, once you get ganked, throw all honor out the window, backstab fish, put on Gower's and parry them to oblivion and back using a weapon with high riposte modifiers (i.e. Mundane daggers, or a +5 poison spotted whip to instantly poison them the moment they get up) I can't really provide a full, in-depth guide here, but I humbly request that you look up guides on the internet to countering Gonkers, and tips on Gank spanking.

DarkSouls2,3dswcr,Multipwner,2,Sun Jul 19 06:43:43 2015 UTC,I got ganked earlier today and I had my MGS with me. I used the LT attack and kept swiping both of them when they got close. Its ok to lose to gankers. I usually run to the npc enemies if my health gets too low and cast warmth. Don't worry if you die and if they taunt you. Its fun to try and win and if you do its an awesome feeling. If you are summoned as a red its ok cuz if you die just go to where you placed your sign and get your souls back.

DarkSouls2,3dssd4,OblivionSol,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:49:44 2015 UTC,Agreed.   SotFS feels like the game that SHOULD have been released. It just feels soooo much better thought out.  Not to say that DS2 wasn't a great game (it was) but SotFS is so much better.
DarkSouls2,3dssd4,erath_droid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:27:21 2015 UTC,I heard the guy who directed the dlcs is the one responsible for SOFTS so thats a good sign...
DarkSouls2,3dssd4,OblivionSol,2,Sun Jul 19 06:48:49 2015 UTC,"I second the other guy. I played the original and quit at drangelic. I hated it. I bought sotfs, and I haven't put it down in months. It's so much better. I didn't even believe I'd like it until I started playing. The items are in better places. Npcs are moved to better spots. The enemy placement feels like it should have been to begin with. And the lighting is awesome with the torch. I run around with a torch half the time just to see the cool shadows, lol. Trust me, sotfs is the version to buy. For example, you get the dull ember waaaay earlier. You also get a certain key way earlier that opens up an area you normally had to wait to enter. There are multiple things like this that make the game feel more open and challenging."
DarkSouls2,3dssd4,Brdman_dareal1,2,Sun Jul 19 02:55:22 2015 UTC,SoTFS includes all the dlc content and feels more like a souls game than the original game. Get SoTFS and just skip vanilla.

DarkSouls2,3drprd,Voidtalon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:57:59 2015 UTC,It's definitely the Dragleic Shield. However there are a few things.   1: That is texture broken. Unless YOU have a corrupted texture it would never appear like that. 2: You said he was spell parrying with it. Which is impossible on the Drangleic meaning it may be Hacked to have other properties.

DarkSouls2,3drprd,Voidtalon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:16:13 2015 UTC,I think when I tried it out. It's not the ring effecting the shield. It's because the Ring has ~60% reflect rate early on that it's easy to think it does.

DarkSouls2,3drprd,KijaJouteh,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:58:10 2015 UTC,It's drrangleic shield enchanted with magic shield. Also if it spell parries he could be wearing yorgh's ring.

DarkSouls2,3drprd,DrTobio,3,Sun Jul 19 01:37:07 2015 UTC,I have and it doesn't. What you experience and take for an added spell parry ability is just the regular effect of the ring (deflecting a certain % of spells). Your shield stays the same.

DarkSouls2,3dpvgr,FLRSH,2,Sat Jul 18 15:26:15 2015 UTC,"I really feel like folks who trash the PvE in Dark Souls 2 forget the really great bosses, areas, red phantoms, and enemies you find throughout the whole game. Looking Glass Knight, Mytha, Executioner's Chariot, Velstadt, Darklurker, Smelter Demon, these are all unique and memorable boss fights with a lot to commend them, plus more, and damn has Scholar of the First Sin really made Drangleic Castle, Undead Crypt, and Dragon Shrine really great."
DarkSouls2,3dpvgr,sadguitarsolo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:31:06 2015 UTC,The lag in PVP destroys all pvp credibility IMO. It's a nice little side thing to do but it's awful and frustrating. There's only so many times you can roll away beautifully from an attack only to get sucked back into it and be backstabbed before you start hating the pvp system.

DarkSouls2,3dsh4p,Mystoic,4,Sun Jul 19 00:50:22 2015 UTC,Gear that negates backstabs. There shouldn't be any gear in the game that can completely nullify a mechanic.
DarkSouls2,3dsh4p,Wolf_of_Velka,3,Sun Jul 19 01:01:16 2015 UTC,Nothing wrong with nullifying a mechanic so long as the player has to give up something in return. I would personally like to see more forced specialization for builds. Silly seeing people in full havels casting spells and such.
DarkSouls2,3dsh4p,Ratstomper,6,Sun Jul 19 03:57:13 2015 UTC,When that mechanic is faulty and 9 times out of 10 results in you getting teleported unjustly from across the map into a high damaging animation...I can see the validity in such a thing.
DarkSouls2,3dsh4p,Gregory_Fontaine,0,Sun Jul 19 01:06:03 2015 UTC,The concept of players being able to remove a mechanic from the game at will is idiotic and easily abused. If there's a problem with a mechanic it should be fixed not swept under the rug via gear. If it can't be fixed then it should simply be removed instead of introducing this ironclad/jester/gowers crap.
DarkSouls2,3dsh4p,Wolf_of_Velka,5,Sun Jul 19 01:13:24 2015 UTC,I agree with the sentiment wholeheartedly but if they intend on leaving in the DS1 backstabs then I wouldn't be opposed to armor or some other mechanic that negated it.
DarkSouls2,3dsh4p,Gregory_Fontaine,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:17:03 2015 UTC,Well hopefully they either fix it or remove it because the only thing worse than glitchy backstabs is getting backstabbed fished by someone using Jesters.
DarkSouls2,3dsh4p,Wolf_of_Velka,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:27:02 2015 UTC,anti backstab RING was fine. Gear however is not. The ring can be broken and thus backstabs re-enabled. Gear is a permanent effect.
DarkSouls2,3dsh4p,Voidtalon,2,Sun Jul 19 01:51:39 2015 UTC,"the ring that does it is okay because its temporary  i think that if there is to be havels armour or something similar, it needs to make you move a lot slower, fast rolling should not be possible with chunks of rock chained to your body"
DarkSouls2,3dsh4p,rekrapinator,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:30:51 2015 UTC,"Agreed. At least the ring can be broken rather easily, but then there's who people who spam repair powder while only giving you their backs."

DarkSouls2,3dsh4p,rekrapinator,2,Sun Jul 19 19:03:40 2015 UTC,"Turtle armor is fine, due to its weight and it makes sense due to its design. It's jesters that's completely retarded."
DarkSouls2,3dsh4p,Wubmeister,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:58:25 2015 UTC,"Turtle armor isn't fine. The gear offers decent defense, negates backstabs, can't be broken easily like Gower's, and the weight is a negligible drawback due to how SM works in PvP."
DarkSouls2,3dsh4p,Wolf_of_Velka,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:22:01 2015 UTC,"It weights 10 units more than friggin Havel's armor but its defenses aren't nearly as good, especially accounting for the elemental defenses. Its defenses are slightly better than Drangleic Mail which weights about half as much (and then Drangleic Mail has better elemental defenses). Gyrm Warrior armor completely blows it out of the water when it comes to all defenses and weights 10 units less. Most other heavy armor has better defenses overall for much less weight.  Its defenses are fine. Its weight is fine. It blocking backstabs is fine on account of its defenses not being that much better than similar-but-much-lighter heavy armor and its weight. Its poise is fine. It's also fine because its shape is a visual indication that you can not backstab it (just like you cannot backstab the Ironclad Knights themselves)  Its weight must be enough of a deterrent for people to not use it, since in 500 hours on PC I've only ever seen one person wearing it: me, in one of my 20 characters. Compared to every other player using Jester's Robes.   Jester's Robes are the problem. Their defenses physical defense is on par with other armor of its weight and elemental defenses are overall better than other armor of its weight range. It weights a meager 5.7 units, compared to the Ironclad's 29.8, it's no wonder nobody wears Ironclad and everybody wears Jester's. It also makes no sense that it can't be backstabbed, there's no logical visual indication, it's just an ugly piece of cloth unlike the carapace of the Ironclad.  It simply takes more to wear the Ironclad armor than other heavy armor, and you're sacrificing defenses for the ability to block backstabs (compared to other heavy armor). With Jester's you're getting defenses on par with other light armor and blocking backstabs for absolutely no sacrifice since it weights very little, there's not even a bit of a sacrifice.   The only problem of the Ironclad armor might be, if anything, SM, but that's not a problem of the armor and entirely a flaw with the game itself. Maybe the 70% equip load breakpoint might be a problem too, but again, that's a flaw of the game, not the armor."
DarkSouls2,3dsh4p,Wubmeister,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:01:11 2015 UTC,"You have your opinion and I have mine. As I've already stated I believe that it's completely idiotic to have equipment that nullifies an in-game mechanic, despite the perceived drawbacks of a particular piece of gear."
DarkSouls2,3dsh4p,Wolf_of_Velka,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:10:40 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying that the problem is not so much the mechanic itself, but Jester robes. Even Gower's ring is fine, since it's breakable and heavy. Ironclad seemingly has enough drawbacks to not use it compared to other heavy armor (as I said, never seen anyone wearing it, never hear anybody even mention it).   Jester has no drawbacks other than being fucking ugly and making you look like a tool.  That's why it's so commonplace while the other two really aren't.  So I guess what I'm saying is mostly this: fuck Jester robes.  Anti-backstab wouldn't be such a problem without Jester."
DarkSouls2,3dsh4p,Wubmeister,4,Sun Jul 19 16:29:45 2015 UTC,Having a stat governing iframes. Hands down my least favorite mechanic of ds2 making the early game a pain and sl1 runs unfun. I'd love ds1 style iframes without the 4 directional rolling while locked on.

As a new player it was seemingly impossible to find certain embers without consulting guides. Having all your needs meet by one or two NPCs is convenient and good for quickly reshuffling your build.
DarkSouls2,3dsh4p,QuantumVexation,2,Sun Jul 19 00:59:43 2015 UTC,"Soul Memory. It was an interesting idea, but it meant once you hit the final couple of tiers there was no reason to not keep levelling your character."

DarkSouls2,3dsh4p,Ansarricade,2,Sun Jul 19 01:24:19 2015 UTC,People are going to whine at me for this but I want them to get rid of poise. Not entirely but just keep it as hyper-armour for heavy weapons as opposed to being stacked by everyone and letting them run with katanas and whatnot. It would help with some aspects of PVP and they could toss out the Stone Ring too.

This video includes some of his dialogue so you can get a bit of a look at him; the OG himself.   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=l-GDTqO0kpY"

DarkSouls2,3dsh4p,Ratstomper,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:08:20 2015 UTC,Thank you for being reasonable have an upboat.
DarkSouls2,3dsh4p,Blakertonpotts,-1,Sun Jul 19 01:09:57 2015 UTC,Sadly praise the sun is confirmed to be back..  And it hurts me.
DarkSouls2,3dsh4p,Ratstomper,2,Sun Jul 19 01:10:46 2015 UTC,"Why? Whats with the praise the sun hate? Of all the things I wouldn't want to see in DS3, the sunbro covenant stuff isn't even on the list."
DarkSouls2,3dsh4p,Blakertonpotts,-1,Sun Jul 19 03:59:50 2015 UTC,"Praise the sun is basically a meme now. People use it constantly to the point of it just being annoying, ex: ""I was doing some jolly cooperation today, praise the sun, and this happened"". I guess it's just my opinion, but you cant deny it's overplayed. On 90% of  threads one of the top comments is ""praise the sun!"" I think it needs to go."
DarkSouls2,3dsh4p,Ratstomper,6,Sun Jul 19 05:33:34 2015 UTC,"So, we're going to kick out a sizable piece of mechanics and lore because a lot of people like it? That doesn't make any sense to me and sounds like a lot of people just being grumpy about the internet. If it's not praise the sun, it'll be dickbutt.  Not everything about Dark Souls needs to be depressingly dark. Also, praise the sun. \[T]/"
DarkSouls2,3dsh4p,WaterWraith,0,Sun Jul 19 05:38:44 2015 UTC,When did i say to cut the lore? Where did you get that from? I said the pointless nonsensical repeating of a specific phrase should stop (in my opinion) as it adds nothing to threads and it gets old just like any meme. I want it taken out of the game because it was only in dark souls 2 just to be in it. It had no lore. It was just there as fan service. So cutting it will not affect the game.  The covenant doesn't really do anything but make you a gold summon anyway.
DarkSouls2,3dsh4p,Ratstomper,2,Sun Jul 19 05:43:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but none of the covenants in DS2 are there for anything other than tier rewards. What you're angry about is the perceived overuse of a meme and the people who overuse it. That's going to happen whether you've got the Golden order of sun kings (or whatever they're called now) or not.   What would you replace it with? They've got an established presence for the sun covenant mechanic and lore, it makes no sense to do away with it, especially if you're only reasoning is that people on the internet are annoying.  Also, why does it annoy you so much? It just all seems really hyperbolic to me."
DarkSouls2,3dsh4p,WaterWraith,2,Sun Jul 19 05:54:28 2015 UTC,"I don't believe he is ""angry"", just stating that he sees ""praise the sun""  as an overused meme that has consumed much of the community as a form of useless repitition, to no longer be in the game, and that's his opinion. Regardless,here's my opinion: I would not like the sunlight covenant and praise the sun to reappear for the sake of it being in the game, as it did in dark souls 2. Hopefully (since it is confirmed to be in the game) they find some way to fit it into the lore of the game. Although ""praise the sun"" is overused, it obviously won't leave the community any time soon. So I think those of us who don't find it amusing just have to get used to it."
DarkSouls2,3dsh4p,TheTweets,2,Sun Jul 19 07:05:41 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, I would prefer this as well. In my opinion, all the covenants in DS2 felt kind of out-of-place and not serving much purpose besides being a familiar facsimile for DS1 covenants with a few extra mechanics tacked on. They feel like a tool and a throwback and not much more.   I want to see covenants have some real purpose and proper implementation in DS3. If people want to praise the sun, make something worth praising the sun over, imo.  I'm mostly Blue sentinel/darkmoon anyway, but usually have a character for co-operation and I really enjoy the sun covenants for co-op as well, so I would prefer to see it stay. The memes don't bother me as much as seeing something I like get stripped out for something else."
DarkSouls2,3dsh4p,yeahididit123,2,Sun Jul 19 07:14:39 2015 UTC,"Exactly with proper implementation, I think that covenants could be a lot of fun. FROM just needs to figure out a way to make them fit lore-wise and serve a purpose that adds something new and interesting to the game."
DarkSouls2,3dsh4p,TheTweets,0,Sun Jul 19 14:54:46 2015 UTC,"Invasions while Hollow.  I know it's for a reason, but I just don't like the reason. I play most of the game as a Hollow, and that's because I don't want to be backstabbed by some twat while I'm trying to get to the boss or just trying to farm. If I want to PvP, I will invade someone who is Human, or play as a Human, or go to one of the PvP arenas that is set up. As an extention - guaranteed NPC invasions. Sure, being in Soldier's Rest might give me a chance of bieng invaded by Soul Spear McGee, but I don't' want to have to take on the 3 TNMTs on the roof, the two on the floor, the bow hollows and some human-just-without-lag who went off to Huntsman's Copse right at the start of the game just to grab magic I have no clue of even knowing about, never mind being able to access myself, then grind an infinite number of Red Eye Orbs and specifically target me. At least with a real human opponent, even if he camps the area forever, he can invade other people.   I mean, I actually want to go through that area, grind out all the enemies while despawning the phantom, just to ensure I can have a proper fight, win it and finally find the tresures I'm sure I missed there.  Oh, and also, a 'feature' I don't want in DS3 is the lack of covenant NPCs. I really liked seeing and chatting to Solaire in DS1, he seemed such a nice guy, and yet the equivalent in DS2 is... A broken statue off somewhere in Harvest Valley. The closest NPC to him is the Blue Sentinel, who has never said anything to me other than telling me to piss off.   I really like Majula, compared to Firelink Shrine it feels so much nicer, but the two things that make me hate it from a non-mechanical standpoint (arrrgh, just let me level without respawning all the barrels and doors) are the music and sound effects - the sea makes the place feel cold, despite the ever-present sunset, and the music makes me feel incredibly sad. I want my hub area, with all my merchants I've gathered, to be a place that I feel not just safe, but at home. I want to be able to return to the hub after a long trek fighting whatever abomination the world throws at me, look around at the allies I've gathered and think ""I'm accomplishing something here. I'm making my mark on the world, and these people are relying on me the same as I'm relying on them. Once I leave the comfort of this oasis of peace, I will risk my life, but while I am here, I am welcome, and all is well with the world"". Firelink Shrine felt fairly warm, but Majula just feels too abandoned - the NPCs are very spread out, like they're just thrown there, rather than like they've found a safe place to rest. I know it's superfluous and all, but I really like to have a place that my character can call ""home"", especially in a world like Dark Souls', where home has been abandoned as a result of  the undead curse.   I think the best place to have as a hub would have actually been the Old Crones' place, if it were lit up more. Rather than having it in a giant cave, taking the wayerfall outside, and the house itself, and having it in the place of the Mansion, then having places run down but slowly fix themselves as you progress and get more inhabitants, never quite making it look finished but always looking like someone is trying to make something of their time there, something temporary, implying they hope to leave someday, but sturdy enough to show that as their memories go, the chances of them staying there increase."

He doesn't know how to react to all of his salt, so he builds it deep within himself and as he takes more and more salt, he becomes more and more hollow. When he becomes fully Hollow, he is just a big pile of salt, not wanting to play this UNFAIR BS POS ARTIFICIAL DIFFICULTY GAME GOSH DARNIT.   His eventual hollowing leads to the satisfaction of the troll, wanting to compensate for the lack of substance downstairs.

DarkSouls2,3dsebm,bmxisgoodforyou,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:34:34 2015 UTC,"I play Defensive-Reactionary.  A bit of background - I have never invaded anyone in my 133hrs in DS1 and 54hrs on DS2. In both games I mostly rely upon NPC summons, and occasionally will place a white sign of some description. What comes to mind most is when on my first character (mid-armour, very basic magic, Greatsword w/ medium shield) I was trying to beat the Ruin Sentinels. In order to conserve Effigies, I would clear the way to the boss, place a small soapstone and help someone beat it, then wait around a bit in the hopes of getting a summon of my own to accompany the two NPC summons (this never happened, despite most people I was summoned to help having a phantom). A couple of days ago I started a new character, a caster. I went through, and now I've just beat the Lost Sinner. I've got to just before where my first character got, in much quicker time, too.  Anyway, I'm now at the Huntsman's Copse, so suddenly invasion is a much more likely prospect. Unlike my medium-weight character, I've actually won a couple of fights with invaders, though it's still about a 75% loss rate. In fact, the last time I played, I was invaded, then spent the next 10 minutes stood on a rooftop I knew I couldn't be ambushed from out of fear of being ambushed. The first BlueBro that came to my aid got absolutely destroyed, but after a while I got another one in, who eventually duked it out. I hope he enjoys his token of fidelity, as it must have been horrible of him to have to come in and fight alone. If the Red Phantom had come to the rooftop, I would have fought, but when it's a choice between chancing it and searching them out and ensuring a fight is on my terms, I'll take the latter.   This illustrates my playstyle in PvP - I am extremely uncomfortable when I am invaded in an area I am not familiar with, or where I don't feel in control. The first bonfire after the eagle takes you to the Lost Bastille, for example, is a place I fought and did well, largely because I felt that it was my turf - the arena was circular with walls, so I could dodge as I liked, I had Magic Weapon on and my shield was ready. Unfortunately fairly often, I won't be able to fight like that, as people will hit through my parries/dodges, or backstab me from the front, but when I get a mix of good tells and luck from the net gods, it feels great to vanquish the bastard that saw fit to invade me.  Also goddamn I despise the Forlorn. That big-arse sword hits for so much. I was never invaded by them until Huntsman's Copse on my first character, but since my Mage spends so much of his time grinding out enemies that will be a problem (for example, the Royal Soldier swarm, or Heide Knights before they become aggressive), I guess they just had more chance to invade.  I really do feel that moving from 69% encumbrance with 95 agility and a shield to ~30% encumbrance, Agility of 105+ and a Catalyst/Parry Shield/Spellparry Shield, with high Int/Fai and a Fire Longsword has made things better for me in a few ways - it's forced me to learn proper dodging, it's forcing me to not just turtle behind a shield, it's given me more attack options and it's improved my damage output."
DarkSouls2,3dsebm,TheTweets,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:49:55 2015 UTC,Cautiously aggressive? I try to land hits as the other person is coming in for an attack (if they're melee).

DarkSouls2,3dr4at,sadguitarsolo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:28:03 2015 UTC,"I would recommend just looking up some lore videos by the well known Youtubers who tend to focus on that sort of thing. It's definitely relaxing just sitting back and watching those videos, and through multiple viewpoints you can begin to grasp the lore for yourself. The games definitely have a lot of lore behind them, so it may be difficult to get it all at once. FromSoftware definitely put a lot of effort into fleshing out a great story for both of them.   However one thing to note is that the main story itself in 1 and 2 don't necessarily connect in the strongest of ways. By that, I mean that Dark Souls 2 is less of a continuation of the same, Dark Souls story, but rather a.. Somewhat.. New one? Hard to explain :)   As for a well typed out post, it would be an insane amount of reading to find one that explains the entirety of the lore in one game, let alone both of them. Not sure where to look on that one man. Best of luck if you still choose that route however!"

Yet to see something like that for DS but I'll check the video's, there's just so many of them I don't know where to start, and wish there was a 'series' that goes in order (maybe there is?)."

DarkSouls2,3dr4at,Shroom_Soul,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:12:38 2015 UTC,"hm... im pretty knowledgeable about the lore (hours upon hours of videos and reading), so i'll give you brief version:  DS1:  Land is quiet, unending, boring, then the 3 lords find the lord souls and fight the dragons, win and establish their kingdom with the first flame (where they got the souls).  The fourth one (pygmy) gives his Dark Soul fragments to humans (the lords were humans too).  Kingdom is good for a while, then the flames begin to fade.  Witch of Izalith attempts to replicate FF, but fails and creates chaos.  Gwyn sacrifices himself to let the flame burn a little longer, but in doing so creates the undead curse (probably), which makes humans lose their humanity instead of dying, so they feed humanity to the bonfire to make the flame burn for longer.  Then you come along, Gwyndolin is attempting to hold the kingdom together, and you can either succeed Gwyn or let the flames fade.  The manus plotline is a bit complex, i'd suggest you read up on it  Anyway, in DS2, it turns out that it didn't matter.  Gwyn fucked up Humans conection to humanity permanently, so now humans cannot inherit the world because they are tied to the bonfires (when they die, instead of dying, they hollow).  You come to another faded kingodm, sent by someone who is messing up the land's timeline so more undead can succeed the flame in ""alternate realities"".  The flame started to fade when Nassy used the ""threat"" of the giants to get closer to vendrick, she is a fragment of Manus so she is dark.  When the flame starts to fade because of her, the curse springs up again, and the cycle continues  Aldia is, again, a separate thing and i'd watch vaati's video on the scholar of the first sin/ Crowns dlc endings to understand it better"
DarkSouls2,3dr4at,Shroom_Soul,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:11:45 2015 UTC,Lords=/= Humans.
DarkSouls2,3dr4at,Shroom_Soul,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:49:58 2015 UTC,"Anonymous posted an explanation below, but I disagree on a few things. Here's my take.  So at the beginning, in the Age of Ancients, the world was grey. Light, Dark, Life and Death did not exist. Dragons existed, but they are not considered living beings. The landscape was dotted by great stone Archtrees.  Then the First Flame appeared underground, and brought Light, Dark, Life and Death into the world. Soulless husks called Hollows approached the flame and started finding Souls inside it. Those that found powerful Souls became Gods. Four Hollows found Lord Souls, each relating to one of the elements brought by Flame. They were Nito (death), the Witch of Izalith (life), Gwyn (light) and the Furtive Pygmy (dark). The first three of these Lords, as well as the Gods, challenged the Dragons. The Pygmy split his Lord Soul (the Dark Soul) into little pieces and gave them to the Hollows that found less powerful souls, making them Human.  So, the Gods killed the Dragons, and the Age of Fire began. Gwyn ruled over the land of Lordran, populated by Gods and humans. Nito went to sleep in his tomb underground. The Witch of Izalith built an underground city (Izalith) with her daughters. The Pygmy faded into obscurity.  Gwyn granted parts of his Soul to some of his allies. One piece he gave to Seath the Scaleless, a Dragon that had helped Gwyn defeat his own kind. Seath was a mad scientist who went on to invent Sorcery. The second piece was given to the four human kings of the city of New Londo.   Gwyn had three kids. The eldest was a God of War, but he was banished from Godhood afterbloosing the annals (records) of history. His daughter, Gwynevere, was revered as a Goddess of Fertility, and was loved by everyone. His youngest son, Gwyndolin, was born with a strong affiliation with the moon. This was seen as feminine, so he was raised as a girl.   Eventually, the Flame began dying. Humans became branded with the Darksign, which made them Undead. The Darksign drains the soul, leaving the host in their natural form; Hollow.  The Witch of Izalith attempted to create a second Flame using her own Soul, but it went wrong and turned her into the Bed of Chaos. The inhabitants of Izalith, including most of the Witch's daughters, were turned into Demons.  In the land of Oolacile, which hugged the edge of Lordran, a serpent knkwn as Kaathe tricked people into awakening a being known as Manus, who may be the Pygmy. Manus created a force known as the Abyss, made of concentrated Darkness. The Abyss began to spread, slowly taking over Oolacile. Gwyn sent one of his best knights, Artorias, to put an end to the Abyss. Artorias was corrupted by the Abyss, however. Manus, searching for a pendant he had once owned, managed to reach through time and pull the Chosen Undead back into Oolacile. The Chosen Undead killed Manus, but this didn't stop the Abyss. The Abyss spread to New Londo, corrupting the Four Kings and their knights. Gwyn ordered the Sealers of New Londo to flood the city, trapping the Kings underwater.  Gwyn decided that the best way to keep the Flame lit would be to use his own Soul as fuel. So he went to the Kiln where the Flame was housed and sacrificed himself.   This was only a temporary fix though, and the Flame began fading again once Gwyn's Soul ran thin. Most of the Gods, including Gwynevere, fled Lordran. Only Gwyndolin remained behind, outbof loyalty for his father. Lordran had gone dark, but Gwyndolin created a false sun over the capital city, Anor Londo, using illusion magic. He also created an illusion of Gwynevere. Gwyndolin, along witj the serpent Frampt, created a false prophecy stating that a ""Chosen Undead"" would arrive in Lordran and succeed Gwyn as fuel for the Flame. Since Gwyn had sealed the way to the Kiln, the remaining Lord Souls were required to get in. Since Undead cannot die, the hope was that eventually an Undead would arrive strong enough to gather the Lord Souls and become fuel for the Flame. That Undead is you.  So the Chosen Undead reached Gwyn, and eiter became fuel for the flame or walked away and became the Dark Lord. All that matters is that at some point SOMEONE fed the Flame.  Centuries later, after the Flame had faded and been relit countless times, a man named Vendrick built a kingdom called Drangleic alongside his brother Aldia. The kingdom was small, but Vendrick was approached by a woman named Nashandra, who told him about an army of Giants across the seas. Vendrick lead an army to the Land of Giants and fought them. He returned with several Giants in chains as well as a mysterious ""prize"". Using the Giants, Vendrick and Aldia built Golems. The Golems were used to build Vendrick's castle. Vendrick married Nashandra and the two ruked together. Vendrick also pillaged Golems created by previous kings, boosting his army.   However, the Flame began to fade again and the Undead Curse started once more. Around this time, the Giants crossed the seas to exact revenge on Vendrick. Drangleic was ravaged, but the Giants were defeated. Vendrick discovered that Nashandra was actually a tiny fragment of the Soul of Manus, and that she had been planning on using Vendrick to reach the Throne of Want. Sitting on this Throne makes one a ""True Monarch"", and so far nobody had sat upon the throne. Vendrick had the opportunity, but instead chose to seal the Throne behind a magic door which could only be opened using his ring. This would prevent Nashandra from taking the Throne for herself. Vendrick ran away and hid in the Undead Crypt, guarded by his most trusted knight Velstadt.   During all this, Aldia had been performing experiments regarding the Undead Curse and how to break it. He created a false Dragon, which lived up in the Dragon Shrine. He also created a half human, half Dragon hybrid named Shanalotte, known better as the Emerald Herald. At some point during all this, Aldia was twisted by the First Flame.  Eventually, Undead began travelling to Drangleic in search of a cure for their Curse. One of these Undead is you. Nashandra needs an Undead to open the door to the Throne of Want, so she can take it for herself. Aldia seeks a way to escape the cycle of the Flame dying and being relit. Shanalotte seeks a new king to succeed Vendrick.  And that's the story of the two games. Not as succinct as I'd like, but I did the best I could."
DarkSouls2,3dr4at,TheJonatron,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:48:55 2015 UTC,Awesome thanks.   And these stories are so immaculately done. My question is did FROM really sit down and think this stuff up so thoroughly or is this more a case of taking incoherent pieces and forming a story (as a player)? If FROM really developed this story it's quite impressive for a video game.
DarkSouls2,3dr4at,TheJonatron,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:37:03 2015 UTC,"Apparently, as a child Miyazaki used to read western fsiry takes and fantasy stories. Because he didn't have a great grasp of English, he often had to fill in the blanks. He intentionally leaves things out for the player to fill in, the dame way he used to. Apparently he also changes his thinking about certain things in the story after the fact as well. So while there is a definite story, some things are fan speculation. That doesn't mean they're wrong; it just means that we don't know the answers for sure."

A really sad one considering they're just using a trainer someone else wrote and pressing buttons. A power trip by someone who can't even gain any legitimate power in a video game. That's kind of depressing when you think about it. I mean I might have a shred of respect if they'd at least hacked the game themselves. For guys like this I almost feel a bit sorry for them, imagining what they must be like.  Unfortunately DkSII does not handle things like that happening well. SM being the problem. Even if I farmed all the souls I had back, and then enough to repair all my rings, armor, and weapons that I was wearing, I'll be punished by the SM system, so I'm just better off restarting.

DarkSouls2,3dra4w,Gregory_Fontaine,0,Sat Jul 18 18:48:25 2015 UTC,there's plenty of strategy involved you just don't know how to counter it
DarkSouls2,3dra4w,rekrapinator,0,Sat Jul 18 18:49:25 2015 UTC,"Assuming you were on the hexers ass the entire fight the moment he uses scraps life you're going to double roll back to avoid the pillars of dark. This gives the hexer the opportunity to heal. The only way you can counter the heal is by anticipated him using scraps of life and spamming projectiles from afar to cancel it, that's it."
DarkSouls2,3dra4w,Gregory_Fontaine,3,Sat Jul 18 18:52:49 2015 UTC,are you saying you don't carry a greatbow in your pocket??????
DarkSouls2,3dra4w,rekrapinator,0,Sat Jul 18 18:56:37 2015 UTC,"But the greatbow only works from afar, if he did scraps of life in front of you by the time you got away and readied the bow he would have healed. Again, there is no real counter to it, it's easy mode for lame as hexers."

In the arena, the only reason I can ever heal, even when putting Scraps of Life up, is because the other person didn't close the gap between us and let me. If you have a shield up you can also walk through any AoE spell and backstab the person casting it."
DarkSouls2,3dra4w,vulpes21,0,Sat Jul 18 19:07:47 2015 UTC,"Again, those only work if you anticipated him using scraps of life and then healing. If he catches you off guard with it by the time you clear the pillars he would have healed already."

DarkSouls2,3dra4w,ATownStomp,0,Sat Jul 18 21:12:54 2015 UTC,In the arena where healing by conventional means has been patched it's not a common tactic to use wrath and scraps/heal. But I never said that i personally had an issue dealing with it but for him to make it about to be this grand strategy is absurd.
DarkSouls2,3dra4w,KijaJouteh,0,Sat Jul 18 21:15:41 2015 UTC,"Exactly, healing in arena reeks of desperation and the only people who have done it while I'm playing are complete noobs or painfully meta builds."

There were no animation glitches and he was 2-handing his weapon when he instantly went back to full health. He did not take any damage for a good 5 seconds after turning his hacks on. I hit and staggered him multiple times and his health stayed frozen at full. After turning on his hacks he used the ""mock"" gesture multiple times.   He most definitely was hacking."
DarkSouls2,3dra4w,rekrapinator,2,Sat Jul 18 23:01:34 2015 UTC,"There was some South African streamer whose character name was ""Steve"", he seemed pretty confident that I was speedhacking, so he decided to instakill me, break all of my gear, drop +14 weapons (thankfully I avoided them) and would probably have killed Titchy had I not already done so. Told me I was an ""absolute garbagelord"" who was ""hacking to try to keep my precious rank2 aura"", despite the fact that I'm using the Ring of the Living and greatweapons.  It's called latency.

DarkSouls2,3dpa05,Brdman_dareal1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:42:11 2015 UTC,"I've never see someone admit to this but it fascinates me so i'll ask you. You don't care at all how you look are what armor choices suit your character and his/her story? Is it just about what gives you a slight advantage or do you just mean things like the hexer hood, penal cuffs, and butterfly wings?"
DarkSouls2,3dpa05,Uorodin,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:58:52 2015 UTC,"I don't use how things look as a factor in how I pick my armor. I use stats and weights. I'll open up the game and recreate my build in the fashion souls site to show you what it looks like.   It doesn't look bad, it just isn't designed to be pretty.   EDIT: www.fashion-souls.com/?g=m&Head=142&Chest=237&Arms=309&Legs=363  I know it isnt particularly the best armor, but it works best for my playstyle."

DarkSouls2,3dr2y1,FurtiveCutless,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:21:29 2015 UTC,Ah ok. So should I focus on upgrading multiple weapons as opposed to having one highly upgraded one?
DarkSouls2,3dr2y1,e_0,2,Sat Jul 18 17:26:20 2015 UTC,I usually go and upgrade one weapon in particular that I know is pretty versatile for all situations and will get me by. In the later stages I would recommend upgrading like a madman just for the fun of it and to test out weapons and what not; but in the beginning I would find out what you're good / comfortable with and main it as much as possible to get the mechanics down entirely before switching it up too much :)
DarkSouls2,3dr2y1,e_0,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:27:58 2015 UTC,Is upgrading easier than in BB? It was annoying to have to basically complete the game to get a weapon to +10 and farming certain blood rocks was a hassle
DarkSouls2,3dr2y1,e_0,3,Sat Jul 18 17:47:05 2015 UTC,"I haven't finished Bloodborne yet, but with the amount of time I put it into thus far; I believe it's much easier on Dark Souls to max out equipment. They seem to be more abundant throughout the game with many ways of obtaining them (if one method isn't to your liking). Helpful hint; always try and find these little buggers whom of which drop upgrade materials like candy. If you use a headset you'll be able to easily recognize when they're nearby by their sound (hard to explain it, but it's what you'd expect from something called a CRYSTAL lizard). They behave the same way those little beasts do on BB who carry upgrade material and run / disappear when they see you.   Hope this helps and you enjoy Dark Souls as much as / even more than you do Bloodborne :)"

DarkSouls2,3dr2y1,LumpyArryhead,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:12:52 2015 UTC,"You need to be careful with this, you'll wreck your SM farming souls to buy them for a bunch of weapons you don't use.     I recommend having a main weapon and a weapon for long runs when you need to preserve durability. Repair powder helps, too.    If you want to experiment with a bunch of different weapons, you basically need to dedicate a character to that, unless you want to be getting invaded by people with 50 or 100 SL on you."
DarkSouls2,3dr2y1,PigDog4,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:45:38 2015 UTC,to be getting invaded by people with 50 or 100 SL on you.   Which really doesn't matter so much after SL 200-250.  It only really matters if you're using a RoB/Flynn SL 150 build.
DarkSouls2,3dr0a0,sonaht23,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:52:03 2015 UTC,"Yes it still works, and yes you can leave the CoC whenever you're finished to go back to normal difficulty, simply talk to the cat (Sweet Shaloqouir) and ""abandon covenant"".   Good luck!  Edit: my favorite method of getting Petrified Dragon Bones is to go to the ""Lair of the Imperfect,"" which hosts those dinosaur looking creatures in the water (Sunken King DLC). There are around 8(?) of them and they have a pretty high drop rate for the PDB's and aren't too difficult to kill, just a tad annoying hitbox area on their attacks. That method may actually be better than the aforementioned video (bonfire nearby as well).   Hope this helps, too :)"

DarkSouls2,3dpvmn,Crowley92,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:55:09 2015 UTC,Sorry bro. Only solution I have is to quit and restart the game. No need to reboot the console. Sometimes it can take 3-4 tries but I manage to get back in eventually.
DarkSouls2,3dpvmn,-V0rador-,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:59:33 2015 UTC,"I am finding that even when I do that and it eventually lets me in after a 15-20 sec calibration, when I go into the game I can see messages and bloodstains but no summon signs at all."
DarkSouls2,3dpvmn,DresdenDil,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:10:09 2015 UTC,"For me lately, it has been try 8 or 9 before it inevitably does not work and I go back to Destiny.

DarkSouls2,3dpvmn,alex2489,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:14:00 2015 UTC,I play on xbone and never have these issues. Are you guys hard quitting your game then retrying? The xbox one standby feature means youre game is running even with the console off which can cause issues with online play.
DarkSouls2,3dpvmn,rekrapinator,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:15:32 2015 UTC,honestly what worked for me is i just played offline until my buddy was like hey help me with fumey so i logged out and tried and it worked first time  theres no method to fix it as far as i can tell it just works sometimes
DarkSouls2,3dpvmn,eatmannn,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:21:16 2015 UTC,"Same problem for many of us, and still no solutions from fucking From.

DarkSouls2,3dpvmn,Gintheawesome,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:47:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to cover for From like a ""fanboy,""  but I personally have more faith in them to call them lazy ""cunts,"" for it. Right now they've been fixing a bunch of things on Bloodborne, and are currently prepping for the release of Dark Souls 3; definitely some important things that they've been phenomenal with so far. Not to mention all of this is following the recent release of SotFS and Bloodborne both.   I'm sure they're aware of it and are possibly working on it. Worst case scenario you can look into translating this page and attempting to contact From (can't do it on my own on mobile, but hope it helps a tad)   http://www.fromsoftware.jp/en/inquiry/"
DarkSouls2,3dpvmn,eatmannn,-3,Sat Jul 18 11:59:48 2015 UTC,"Sorry but as far as I can tell the sequence of events is this:   Developer patches game and in process completely gimps matchnaking People comment and report to developer matchmaking is broken Developer tells them to forward some ports and then says ""well the problem isn't on our end""   End.  I would be okay if they acknowledged something -- but right now they seem to be ignoring customers and replying to emails with bots   I could be wrong, but I see no indication that Bandai Namco or FROM have even acknowledged that there is a problem.  Additionally, I don't care if they have other projects. If they had the gall to re-release basically the same game plus dlc and minor changes (as full price), they better not fucking completely cease any game support only a few MONTHS after release."
DarkSouls2,3dpvmn,Gintheawesome,2,Sat Jul 18 12:36:23 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong   Well, I guess it's a good thing you are wrong. Gonna be a massive fucking douche on this post. First off, you think server support is just turning the bloody thing on. Guess what honey, it ain't. It involves a LOT of shit to deal with. No need to bash a company like this when they are releasing a fuck ton new content very soon.  Your little chart is far from truth. First off, Matchmaking isn't horribly broken. Is it broken? Yes. Is it playable? Yes. It needs a lot of work but you act like the world is crumbling away when you have to wait a couple of minutes for the game to calibrate (it is fucking annoying though). Then your third point which states the developer acknowledged the problem and came out with a ""fix"" but then you go on to say ""I could be wrong, but I see no indication that Bandai Namco or FROM have even acknowledged that there is a problem."" Yeah, good job there.  ""I would be okay if they acknowledged something -- but right now they seem to be ignoring customers and replying to emails with bots"" It's not an easy fix. This is no way in any shape or form an easy fix. They are going to need a LOT of man power and hours to get this shit even remotely fixed. Stop crying, it's going to happen.  ""Additionally, I don't care if they have other projects. If they had the gall to re-release basically the same game plus dlc and minor changes (as full price), they better not fucking completely cease any game support only a few MONTHS after release."" Just look at what you wrote. Look at it! Do have any idea what you even wrote? First off, they have a NEW FUCKING GAME coming out! They gotta make sure this is the best thing you have ever seen since a dog doing backflips. Second, SOTFS wasn't just minor changes. A lot of item placement was changed and a LOT of enemies were moved around. Plus a whole bunch of other shit here and there, free DLC, and I might be wrong about this but I am sure that if you owned DS2 you got the update for it for free. SOTFS was basically just to release it on XboxOne and PS4.  Last but not least, they aren't going to quit on DS2 right now. No way would the game just break like it is right now and they wouldn't fix it. Calm down, drink estus, chill the fuck out."
