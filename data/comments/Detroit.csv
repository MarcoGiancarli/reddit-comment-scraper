I don't think the public opinion here in NYC really thinks of these as serious adverts, and I get the impression that it's mocking the ""hipsters"" in certain areas of the city to get them to move elsewhere.  For business owners looking for expansion, Detroit is a huge incentive with not a whole lot of risk.  The initial investment costs in retail/commercial property is incredibly small compared to New York.  Sure, the development could fail, but as Detroit grows back to what it once was investors could cash in within a few years.  I guess my point is that these people aren't necessary moving from New York to Detroit to stay, but rather expanding their New York centred businesses with small amounts of capital.  The city of Detroit needs to help protect these investments because I don't believe that they'll stick around if crime becomes a business hassle or if they are taxed into oblivion."

Detroit,3dtaib,sellursoul,2,Sun Jul 19 21:41:25 2015 UTC,"Action is always faster than reaction. A normal-untrained person who has a gun drawn on him can deploy their handgun and fire, effectively, before their adversary can fire on them. I know this seems counterintuitive, but it's absolutely the case. If you add any form of training into the mix, even the minimal training you get for a CCW class, and the odds for the person who acts first are dramatically increased.  This video kind of shows the principle I am talking about, but it's not a perfect example.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdbE9gIbHmc  I've seen literally hundreds of scenarios played out with trained and untrained people alike. The only aggressors (person with the gun out already) who ever ""survived"" were exceptionally well trained professionals, and even then, it was probably less than 50% of the time. A street criminal? No chance.   Bottom line, the guy who deploys and uses their weapon first, wins. Assuming it's not in a briefcase or something."
Detroit,3dtaib,gpforlife,3,Sun Jul 19 18:49:40 2015 UTC,If this were true there should be almost no cases where someone gets shot while drawing their concealed weapon.

Belle Isle here in Detroit is unique, DIA is cool, Detroit Zoo. Walking around the riverfront, catching a tigers game, heading to Eastern Market on a Saturday/Sunday morning. Food /drinks in corktown/downtown/midtown/greektown.  Some of these ideas are pretty generic but a good starting point for looking around."

Detroit,3dqtb0,TheMadButcher,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:19:32 2015 UTC,"I love Traverse City. I'd head North, and see M-22 and the Leelanau, and Sleeping Bear Dunes. If you want to go further North, there's Mackinac Island too. Further up there's Tacquamenon Falls, and Paradise, and the warmest place in Lake Superior, where the Tacquamenon River goes into Whitefish Bay. You can go to the Fish House and have the best whitefish you've ever eaten. You can hike from the Lower Falls to the Upper Falls too, and there's a brewery in the park. Up at Whitefish Point there's a museum and a rocky, beautiful beach. St. Ignace on the way back has fireworks every Saturday during the summer. You can follow the lake all the way back to Traverse, and see Charlevoix and Petoskey. I really love Up North. Detroit is better for another time, when you're going to be downstate the whole time."

Detroit,3dqtb0,3dogs3catsandahedgeh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:49:24 2015 UTC,"The Fish House is in Paradise, in the Upper Penninsula, about 2 hours north of Traverse if you stay on 75 instead of getting off in Grayling. It's a bit of a road trip. You should call before going, because the owner goes fishing every morning and the fish he brings back are what he serves. Usually he has enough whitefish but when he runs out, he closes the restaurant. You go to downtown Paradise and turn left toward the falls, and it's on your right."

The Huron National Forest is kind of out of your way, but it's a beautiful area.  In Traverse City, try to make it to Sleeping Bear Dunes. If you love craft beer, there's tons of it to be had - highly recommend going to Shorts Brewing Company which is about 30 minutes outside of TC.   If you want an awesome burger and a solid drink selection, Bubba's is a great burger joint in TC.   The most popular thing to do is probably to go up through the peninsula's in TC. Wineries everywhere, and they all have some pretty amazing views, and of course, great wine! And it's cheap to wine taste! Highly recommend this place for the views - their wine is pretty good too!  Also, there's lighthouses at the points of both peninsulas. Pretty cool to see, and again, as you could guess, amazing views.   Those are the best things I can think of right now - lots of great suggestions for places to see on your way up there from other people ITT."

If your choice is between exploring along the drive or suing the city, spend the day in Detroit proper. There really is so much going on right now it's a lot of fun.  Huron Natl forest is nice but nothing spectacular. Traverse City proper is a great little beach town in prime season. Rare Bird Taproom is the spot these days for bee and food. Leelanau county and Sleeping Bear Dunes are where you want to camp or get some nature time in. Sand cliffs and fresh water islands and sweeping views. Find an old county map and follow the old two track roads toward the water. It's phenomenal"

Detroit,3dqvpi,springwaterbrew,3,Sun Jul 19 00:14:22 2015 UTC,"As a Livonia native, I'll be happy to point you in the right direction of some of my favorites within Livonia or within a few miles of the Livonia borders. Livonia and the surrounding area has a TON of chain restaurants,  but I am going to try and avoid them in my list.  (1.) Bates - (5 Mile &  Farmington rd.) Livonia's most ""famous"" restaurant. Great sliders, fries, and shakes. Apparently don't get the chili?   (2.) Las Palapas- (Plymouth rd. &  Farmington rd.) IMO Probably one of the best Mexican restaurants in the suburbs.   (3.) Thai Fresh (8 mile & Haggerty Rd. ) Used to work in Livonia, across the street from Thai Basil. We would absolutely drive further to go to T.F. Much better thai food IMO.  (4.) Mason's Bar (Schoolcraft rd. & Farmington rd.) Kind of a hole in the wall,  but AWESOME burgers.   (5.) Shehan's on the Green (5 mile West of I-275) Little ""Irish Pub"" but really good bar food.   (6.) Stables Bar (5 mile & Middle Belt Rd.) Never been,  but always heard great things about the food there.   (7.) THE Senate Coney Island (Plymouth Rd & Stark Rd.) Don't go to any other Coney Island in or around Livonia, unless you're going over to Detroit.   (8.) Boneyard BBQ III (Plymouth Rd.  Between Merriman rd and Middle Belt rd.) - The BBQ chicken literally falls off the bone. I try to avoid the ribs there though very hit or miss.  (9.) Annie's- (Plymouth Rd. & Farmington Rd.) This is a pretty unknown restaurant in Livonia,  as it only converted from a Big Boy about a year ago,  but their Polish Dinners are absolutely amazing,  and most of their other food is really good too.   (10.) East Side Mario's (Plymouth rd. & Merriman rd.) Technically this is a big ""Italian-American"" chain restaurant over in Canada,  with this being one of 2 U.S. Locations, but you get a ton of food for a fairly decent price.   (11.) One-Under Bar &  Grill (5 mile Rd., just East of Levan rd.) The food is OK,  but the craft beer menu is ridiculously huge, if youre into that.   (12.) The Loony Baker (Farmington rd. & Schoolcraft rd) Bagels,  Donuts,  and Pastries Freshly made in-house.   (13.) Benny's Pizza (Joy rd. & Merriman rd. in Westland) Looks like a hole in the wall from the outside, but some of my favorite Pizza in the immediate area.   (14.) Buddy's Pizza (Plymouth rd. & Farmington Rd.) They have like 10 locations around Metro Detroit, but if you've never been, You absolutely need to try this Detroit legend. I highly recommend getting The Detroiter Pizza and an Antipasto Salad. They also have pasta,  sandwiches,  burgers,  ect.   (15.) Guernsey Dairy (Novi rd. Between 8 mile &  9 mile in Northville/Novi) Delicious ice cream and shakes,  all made in house. The restaurant there is pretty awesome too.   (16.) Pretty much any restaurant in Downtown Plymouth (the next city to the West) Also has Liberty Street Brewing co. If you like craft beers.   (17.) Downtown Farmington (Farmington rd. & Grand River) Try Farmington Brewing Company for some of my favorite local craft beer,  or Basement Burger Bar for an extremely customizable and delicious burger.   I could probably name off a ton more,  and you can definitely hit up any of the hundreds of chain restaurants in the area or drive a little further to any of the neighboring towns, but I think I covered a good and unique start to satisfy your hunger in the immediate Livonia area."

It's gritty up here, but it's fun and exciting. I'm 26, when I graduated college and moved out of state I told people I was from Detroit, the common response was ""I'm sorry to hear that, what's it like"".

Detroit,3do51u,BaboonRockFighter,3,Mon Jul 20 16:52:30 2015 UTC,"One thing I find about Detroit (as  someone who does a lot of child-care work in the city) is that it doesn't need as much help as some people assume it does - that's not saying you can't make a meaningful impact- but don't expect absolute total leaps and bounds. I'm not trying to be standoff-ish just my anecdotal evidence  .. I think is the major thing haunting the city  is gentrification....   so my advice to you:   visit Detroit, and not just downtown and midtown. Go to  place like the Southwest or Hamtramck. Be respectful of the long standing communities in the area, again because - I hope- you don't want to price people out. Detroit is full of wonderful and amazing human beings, just say hi! have a plan! Allow yourself to have an open mind  be real with people, I find detroit is one place in the midwest where people say stuff like it is.. Don't be a dick, just be honest   Good luck!"

Detroit,3do51u,CameronStarfish,3,Sat Jul 18 02:41:21 2015 UTC,"In short, the safe places white people live is expensive. It is only cheap in less nice areas (in general). There is big growth in only a couple places pushing out long time residents for young white people. It is kind of an issue here. Detroit is 80% black and has been for a long time. Many black residents don't want to be ""saved"" by some young white kid. But some people do need help. Good luck."

Detroit,3do51u,Tess47,4,Sat Jul 18 17:15:05 2015 UTC,"Yes in a way... What has happened in Detroit is that somebody or some group starts taking advantage of the affordable prices -as you said . These groups or people start spending their money like crazy and do things that may seem good on the surface ( open new expensive stores or restaurants) and raise property value so that the established community in that location can no longer afford the neighborhood and leave. It's a very very difficult issue and everyone has different opinions about it, but as Detroiters we must have a constructive conversation about this phenomenon."

The Lafayette is a beat-up dive, and it shows, but the coneys are just as fantastic. There is also a HUGE debate among Detroiters as to which of the two is the better one, a fight that I'm not even going to think about wading into here.   ♪~ ᕕ(ᐛ)ᕗ  It should be noted that not all coneys in the Detroit area are created equal. The American and the Lafayette are the only two coney islands that stick almost exclusively to coneys only. Both places' menus are very short, with not a whole lot of other things (although, I will note that last I checked, both of these places had beer available, something you won't find on coney menus outside of those two).   A Coney Island outside of either the American or Lafayette is more like a diner, with the implied addition of coneys to the menu. Coneys inside Detroit tend to stick to things like corned beef, stacked ham, and egg salad sandwiches in addition to hamburgers, and typically have an extensive breakfast menu that is available from open-to-close. Many coneys in the area are also open 24 hours.   An actual ""coney island hot dog"" is something you might know of as a ""Michigan hot dog"", being from Canada, as they sometimes get referred to as such across the river. Put simply, it's usually a natural-casing hot dog (for authenticity's sake, either Dearborn or Koegel's brands), put in a steamed bun with a thick, meaty chili sauce ladled over it. It is then topped with yellow mustard and a heap of diced white onion, and served up, most frequently with a pile of fries as a side."

We mostly have Catholics (overwhelming majority), UU's (mostly in MA), Episcopalians, and Methodists, with a smattering of Congregationalists and Baptists mixed in. I got to Detroit (and the surrounding Metro area), and saw a remarkable number of Lutheran churches. Same with Presbyterians as well, actually.

Detroit,3dl6kp,dissaver,3,Fri Jul 17 12:25:37 2015 UTC,"Sort of.  Brooklyn became so desirable because back in the 80s artists moved into and rehabbed SoHo. The same thing that is going on right now in Brooklyn took place in SoHo and the Lower East Side of Manhatten in the early 90's. As prices skyrocketed in Manhattan, artists looked across the river - and not right across the river, deep into Brooklyn for cheap rent. They found Williamsburg, at the time an area no different than what the Packard is right now - empty warehouses. They moved into those areas and now most of Brooklyn goes by some new monicker that involves east, west, southwest Williamsburg.  Now, the people who saw the potential of a crappy ghetto that people would never want to live in see the same potential for Detroit.  Detroit is a world destination, only because of the auto industry, and because of that and the influx of east coasters. Back in the 70s NYC was about as desirable as Detroit is now."
Detroit,3dl6kp,UglyPineapple,6,Fri Jul 17 13:03:19 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree, but the NYC economy is multitudes larger and more diverse than Metro Detroit, for Detroit to experience Brooklyn-esque growth there will have to be a large expansion of industry outside of the automotive sector. This is not all that far fetched as the SE Michigan region has many great things going for it which could spur this type of change."
Detroit,3dl6kp,dissaver,3,Fri Jul 17 14:21:23 2015 UTC,"I think I agree with both of you. The article seems to be confusing ""Detroit"" with certain neighborhoods of Detroit.

So there's basically no chance of the whole city becoming filled with white yuppies."

Detroit,3djx4f,ornryactor,2,Thu Jul 16 21:49:45 2015 UTC,"That's a bit of a non sequitur, but it accurately reflects a truth in Detroit- the Pistons do not have nearly the casual fanbase that the Tigers, Lions, or Red Wings boast, and it's partially because they're not visible due to playing 35 miles away in an outer suburb instead of in the middle of downtown like the other teams. Hence, you'll find less Pistons gear no matter where you go, unless you head to outer-ring northern suburbs closer to their arena."

You'll obviously need your passport or enhanced ID as usual.  They brought a drug-sniffing dog on the bus before they let anyone out on the Canadian side. We were just going to fuck around in Windsor for a night. It was very spur-of-the-moment so we didn't bring any sort of overnight bags with us even though we planned to crash at a hotel. Turns out this was a huge mistake. There was a girl who looked very young - 22 maybe - working customs. She was extremely curt, rude and found it very hard to believe that none of us brought even a toothbrush. Eventually, she let us through.  Returning to Detroit the next morning was more awkward iirc. I remember having to board the bus at strangely-located spot after getting poutine from Burger King.   tl;dr Taking the tunnel bus is easy, but don't forget to bring a toothbrush."

Aaron often has interesting points to make, but the caricature of bohemian white people moving the city gets tiresome. I suppose we're all tired.  Since moving here I met several wishy-washy people with lofty but ill-defined ambitions, but the number I've met is in the dozens, not hundreds, and certainly not thousands. They're also tremendously avoidable. I haven't met many who claim to want to ""save"" themselves. I've had more people stop me on the street asking if I want to be saved.   What are you looking for here that you can’t find elsewhere? Can’t you just admit that you came for the cheap rent?   I'll bite.  Detroit is a major US city in a major Western country. Some people come because they're from a small town with no arts or social scene, some from a neighboring state where it's all farming, some from countries north and south of the border that look at America fondly, some from impressively wealthy countries that don't want to have to deal with an competitive job market in NY or SF.  There are so many reasons to come to a major US city, the one you're in just happens to be Detroit. Sure, it's cheap. I imagine Flint is too.   keep that maudlin B.S. to a minimum   Indeed."

I don't see how they're reinforcing a ""save detroit/self"" mentality - only that people want to be part of something bigger, such as the city's rebirth, which can be anything from civic engagement to making money on the rising economy. Isn't that something needed?"
Detroit,3dhzfg,MGoAzul,5,Thu Jul 16 15:56:40 2015 UTC,"It is something that's needed. Cities need a constant stream of people to thrive and succeed. This group does a lot of things right, no doubt, but there's a troublesome narrative that that lies behind it:  ""Detroit is an up and coming city, rife with opportunities; a place to start fresh and make a personal impact that affects the community around me.""  The truth is, that's not the case for everyone. A certain population of Detroiters have a privilege, be it racially or financially, that allows them to become a sort of cultural tourist. We need to be cognizant of the fact that new business and residents subvert a population of people that have been living in the city in its toughest times. Business owners, students, families, etc. With all the focus put on companies that have opened-up shop, its also important to note that there have been people living here, dealing with issues that many transplants have skirted around, and will continue to deal with.   The point is, all of this new stuff that's opening, people moving into the city is overall a good thing, but the issue that I think /u/akfoley is taking issue with is what happens to the other side of the story."
Detroit,3dhzfg,ranchgasm_,5,Thu Jul 16 16:21:41 2015 UTC,"More or less. The one thing I've been consistent on -- and you can pull up literally anything I've written in the last few years on the subject -- is that I've never, ever said no one should not move to Detroit.  I'm welcome to anyone who wants to move here, just as long as they're not a dick about it AND they realize that there are people who are already here."
Detroit,3dhzfg,akfoley,0,Thu Jul 16 18:28:11 2015 UTC,"i think it's the reading between the lines which paints another picture. whenever someone gets/does/obtains something new they want other people to know about it - it's human nature. If you're the holier than thou who doesn't boast about a single thing, then i stand corrected.   but, when people come here they're going to talk about it. Sure, maybe they use the word ""save"" when what they mean is they feel here they can be part of something (a new company, community revival, a neighborhood org, whatever it is). The fact is, being a part of something  in the city is ""saving"" this city from it's past woes, but more over and more exactly, it's being a part of something on a level of significance not easily obtainable in comparable or larger cities. You can go to NYC, LA, Chicago and be a big fish in a very big pond and still have nothing to show for your efforts. On the contrary, in Detroit you can make a big impact and see the fruits of your labor much sooner.   maybe, rather than vilifying those who come and want to ""save"" via the harsh tones used by you and others on this forum, it would be better suited  educate and appreciate those who are doing it. The fact is, the people who are coming to Detroit don't have to come here - they could easily go somewhere else and the reality is w/o these transplants from Brooklyn, etc. helping those who here doing what they do, Detroit would be the armpit and laughing stock of America for the next 60 years.   Some on here will want to say ""fine, if they have so many other options or don't have to be here, go elsewhere. we can do it on our own."" This is what a many of the Foley pieces convey and it can be off-putting to outsiders - even those of us just out in the suburbs. it's not the welcoming tone Detroiters and those in SW SE Michigan are generally known for. It'd be like a Canadian spitting in your face, it just doesn't happen."

Detroit's different though, they aren't displacing that many people or businesses that I know of, New York had a housing shortage before they started moving in, now it's a crime against humanity, Detroit doesnt have that problem, but if this revitalization is successful, watch out."

Because many of them aren't going to stay. Sure, they'll spend a few years there, and spruce up a few houses/buildings, but as soon as it comes time to have a family, most of them will be off to the suburbs in a heartbeat rather than deal with Detroit Public Schools. Then they'll sell their refurbished building for a tidy sum to the next group of urban pioneers, and the housing stock will continue to increase in cost as the salvageable homes get renovated while the unsalvageable ones get torched by arsonists or leveled and turned into urban forest.  Meanwhile the schools / infrastructure / crime will remain as awful as ever.  But hey, they'll have saved themselves and raised enough home equity to buy a nice home in one of the suburbs with acceptable schools, and have contributed to Detroit's ""revitalization"", so they can say they did their part."

I have a number of friends in the city from Brooklyn and Chicago and none have said anything close to that. The typical response is: It was cool, there was a job, and it's cheap.   Seems like whining for the sake of whining - Especially parts like this:   Us eastside and westside kids were always told to not even think about going to the parks in Grosse Pointe, to drive slow in West Bloomfield, to just ignore those stars and bars on the back of Taylor pickup trucks and to outperform the kids in all the rest of the suburbs so that we might have a chance to get a scholarship to a U of M, an MSU or a CMU, only to be told on the first day of orientation that we are only here as pitiful affirmative-action cases and that our Detroit/Highland Park/Southfield/Inkster educations would never be enough to make it in the real world, so we go back home to make sure that the next generation would never have to deal with the kind of stuff we had to put up with, only now we have to deal with not only these overcrowded schools, these abandoned houses, these unpredictable summers but on top of all this, these armies of confused Williamsburg rejects who simultaneously have all the answers on how to make it in Detroit after living here for five weeks but don’t even know how to fix their own lives because they need to be “saved.”"

Detroit,3dhzfg,akfoley,5,Thu Jul 16 14:58:50 2015 UTC,"i did not say they would move to Detroit ""if"" there was a Chipotle downtown - in fact i said it was an element that people take into account, it's a matter of looking at the bigger picture and  options overall. Having attractions (entertainment, restaurants, night-life, extracurricular, etc) which appeal to the younger generation is what it will take for people to move back to the city. Like it or not, kids from the suburbs, Brooklyn/NYC in general, LA, Chicago, Miami, and abroad, moving into the City and working along side the legacy residents is what will help rebuild Detroit.   Thinking that outsider's shouldn't be a part of ""Detroit's Rebirth"" is what got Detroit in the problem it is in right now - 60 years of that mentality is what caused the problems of the present, and at the way things are going one can hope, if this is your mentality, that you will be sadly mistaken.   in your article you talk about not minding if people move to detroit and yet complain when they say it's b/c they want to ""save detroit"" or ""save themselves"". Frankly, who cares what their intentions are? They're here, they're spending money, they're driving business - the general Detroit population is very welcoming to outsiders and new residents, it seems like you and your cohort are in the minority.  Are these new residents displacing people who live in downtown/Cass/Rivertown/Corktown/Gold Coast/Etc? sure, that's probably the case - but it's also the life of an (re)emerging city. Do you have a better solution to convince landlords not to increase rents, for stores not to increase prices? As a result of these ""save detroit"" people, people from the suburbs moving back in addition to current residents working back in the city center there is now a whole foods in Detroit, a number of meijer in or planned w/in city limits, and just in general more business."
Detroit,3dhzfg,MGoAzul,2,Thu Jul 16 15:19:14 2015 UTC,"60 years of that mentality   60 years ago was 1955. 12 years earlier were the 1943 riots. 12 years later were the 1967 riots. Are you sure ""outsider mentality"" was the main thing causing Detroit's problems back then?"

Ferndale built a wall on the Eight Mile border to keep residents out.   Residents of Grosse Pointe told a ""nigger"" black doctor to go back home after he purchased a property there.  Eastpointe literally changed its name from East Detroit to no longer be affiliated with Detroit.  It took a court order to desegregate schools in the suburbs in the 1970s.  We have two bus systems because suburban residents have consistently voted against expanding the city bus system into the suburbs.  I could go on...  And the city has been hostile?"

The state have done a lot to clean & fix up this amazing park in the limited time they've been managing it, while actually saving the city money... but at the time of the proposal, city council members where acting like the state where going to sink it into the river or put up a sign on the bridge saying ""for whites only""."

Even getting a hotel at the Sheraton (on the South Side) was about $90 a night. People are extra friendly and inviting. I was alone, at the bar having a Yuengling and made friends easily. I ended up going to an after-hours bar and someones party. It was awesome.   When I got there via Megabus, I walked from the Greyhound Station (I think Liberty and 9th) to the Sheraton. This is a pretty long walk but it was enjoyable and safe. I got to walk across a nice bridge and get an introductory view of the skyline.   Also tons of alcohol, Carson Street is suppose to be the ""longest bar street in America."" There's a variety of places to grab a drink there, from what little I remember."
Detroit,3de3j0,iraqicamel,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:29:05 2015 UTC,"I am from Pittsburgh. The answer is really simple. Fundamentally Detroit had no boundaries to sprawl. That coupled with absolutely massive racial tension == urban crisis.   Pittsburgh is extremely lucky to have CMU, Pitt, and a handful of other small universities within the city limits.   Detroit would be a very different place if LTU, Madonna, Cranbrook, UofM etc. were all in Detroit city.   Of course the hard question to answer is  -- What do we do now?"
Detroit,3de3j0,gameguy56,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:48:28 2015 UTC,"Of course the hard question to answer is -- What do we do now?   Capitalize on our historic districts, primarily downtown and surrounding areas. Increase density by continuing redevelopment, safety, and small-businesses. Work on the infrastructure of this area and ensure it's bike/walk friendly. We need the greater-downtown to have bike lanes everywhere and noticeable pedestrian crosswalks that have a ""STATE LAW: YIELD TO PEDESTRIAN"" signs in the middle. About the crosswalks, our roads are so large (such as Woodward) and some lights are far from each-other that several blocks have to be passed in order to legally-cross. Not that I've heard anybody complain about jay-walking tickets in Midtown, but we should act more like a neighborhood and support pedestrians who want to cross the street.  I think we can also capitalize on our international riverfront, the cultural institutions and the universities in the city to influence people to stay. The fact that there are somewhere around 100,000 workers in downtown and many of them live outside the city says something. I know many are proponents of fixing up the neighborhoods, which I heavily agree, but most suburban cities have nicer and safer neighborhoods. Many of the neighborhoods are a lost cause in Detroit, such as the area around McNichols and Ryan. It looks like a complete shit-hole here and there are swaths of crackheads, it's only a matter of time before that area is completely empty.   Also, relocating many of the companies that left for suburban office space back into Downtown would be helpful. There are office markets to compete with, such as Southfield and Troy, but I would have to say the suburbs don't have skyscrapers and a dense urban-area. That's why I think it makes sense to begin from the greater-downtown and spread towards 8-Mile."
Detroit,3de3j0,iraqicamel,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:31:05 2015 UTC,"The ""boundaries to sprawl"" thing is huge. Also ""boundaries to blight.""  Pittsburgh is one of the hilliest cities in the country. It's built into the mountains. So it's hard to spread out. Also, when a neighborhood struggles and becomes blighted, frequently there is a hillside or a ravine that stops the spread of blight and keeps the neighborhood nice.   As opposed to Detroit, which is flat as a pancake and blight spread right up the broad avenues until it met a man-made boundary like 8 Mile. And sprawl continues into the flat farmland on the urban fringes."
Detroit,3de3j0,Khorasaurus,0,Thu Jul 16 14:12:37 2015 UTC,"This entire study is invalidated by the fact that ""Pittsburgh"" is how you address letters to anybody within a 20 mile radius of downtown Pittsburgh. It's like comparing the city of Detroit to the enter tri county area. The entire area is broken down into Burroughs and neighborhoods. All technically still Pittsburgh, but unaccounted for in this study.  The study only seems to account for the highly urban areas, rather than the municipality as a whole. It's like crunching the numbers for Detroit, but eliminating the east and west sides from calculation."

For the area to be as dangerous as it is can be summed up as nothing less than an absolute shame.
Detroit,3d90ww,iwantagrinder,4,Wed Jul 15 04:51:12 2015 UTC,"You can get so much more home for so much less in the city. And it will look far better.    I've seen some cool container homes in my day, but these look sloppy inside and out. The storage and cabinetry looks especially cheap on the inside.    Not digging the odd hybrid brick facade combo either. If you're going to run with something like this, stay true to the concept and keep it industrial. Le cringe."
Detroit,3d90ww,ecib,3,Tue Jul 14 19:12:27 2015 UTC,"That is one ugly duplex.  There is one going up in Royal Oak (single family) which will probably turn out much better, and will probably cost twice as much."
Detroit,3d90ww,greenw40,3,Tue Jul 14 17:43:16 2015 UTC,These are really bad looking and the price is excessive. I'm also not a fan of shipping container housing as it's an incredibly inefficient way to build a house.

Detroit,3d90ww,thsmchnkllsfcsts,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:47:37 2015 UTC,Actually the whole thing is containers. They just covered the larger portion of the structure with normal siding. So it looks like a normal structure.

Detroit,3d98te,ornryactor,6,Tue Jul 14 15:23:02 2015 UTC,"I'm the wing guru and will help you on your quest.  The best I've found in Metro Detroit are at a place called Freddy's in Clinton Township. Every Wednesday they are 50 cents all day long, along with $3 drafts and half off appetizers from 4-6. They have about 6-8 flavors, but the hot is straight gold. They marinate their wings ahead of time, and the flavor is out of this world.  The second best are in Madison Heights, at a bar called Bugsy's. They're only 25 cents Monday through Friday, 11-7 (all day on Tuesdays). They're slightly smaller, but have one of the greatest flavors. After they take them out of the deep fryer, they sauce them and then throw them on the grill which gives them a flavor and texture that no one else has. One flavor, but it's all you need.  Third best, I would say, is Sweetwater tavern. To my knowledge, they don't have deals at Sweetwater, but you know what you're paying for is quality every time. One flavor. But again, that's all you need.  Also worth noting: half off wings at Hopcat every Monday from 6-10. Three flavors, cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious. Plus, crack fries.  50 cent wings (and $1 coneys) at Norm's Field Of Dreams in Troy every Monday all day. Best fries ever for super cheap.  There are more, but this is all you need for now. Good bye."
Detroit,3d98te,CLOSE_THE_PIT,3,Wed Jul 15 04:03:59 2015 UTC,"To supplement what you said about Sweetwater: You can order a side of ""wing sauce"" for dipping which is probably something simple like a mix of Frank's and Tabasco or something, but it's very zippy and good. It complements the wings well and offers a totally new flavor profile for them, so I'd argue there's ""two"" flavors at Sweetwater.  Now I wanna try out Freddy's. Thanks for the recommendation!"

Detroit,3d98te,primesuspect,2,Tue Jul 14 17:58:39 2015 UTC,"I've gotten their wings twice, and both times found them really disappointing. The first time, they were completely overcooked, dry and tough. Barely edible. The second time they were cooked fine but the sauce was beyond salty. Not sure I'd try them again."
Detroit,3d98te,ConeySauce,4,Wed Jul 15 14:13:21 2015 UTC,"Shocked that City Wings in New Center hasn't been mentioned.  Purely my opinion, but they blow Sweetwater away.  Sweetwater's sauce is good but I feel the wings come out soggy instead of crispy. I swear by City Wings though....try their Spicy BBQ, Teri-Que, Garlic Parmesan, or any of the buffalo sauces.   EDIT: Just noticed you're closer to Royal Oak. Surprisingly, Fifth Avenue has fantastic buffalo wings. Definitely try theirs."
Detroit,3d98te,neznarf,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:17:26 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree here. City Wings are absolutely gnarly. Tons of gristly bits. Plus, they don't have soda. They'll offer you tea or lemonade, but, when you order a lemonade, it turns out to be a pink lemonade, which would be ok if they didn't come by and throw your lemonade away while you were washing your hands (only to refuse to give you another one once you get out of the bathroom). Seriously, I hate that place."
Detroit,3d98te,tilertailor,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:22:37 2015 UTC,I eat there on occasion and have similar feelings. It's ok. Too expensive bc the wings are tiny and only come as choice of 10 or 20 or more.
Detroit,3d98te,stevestgermain,2,Wed Jul 15 00:32:25 2015 UTC,Renshaw Lounge in Clawson and 24 Seconds in Berkley are the two best IMO.  I prefer my wings to be crispy and fall off the bone.

I don't know where to find the numbers, but I'm sure the people of NYC get their fair share, it not more so. NYC is a rich city with a poor population, almost all of the SNAP and Medicaid money is going to the city, NYC has a 18.5% poverty rate, NYS's is 13.7%. Buffalo is poorer but the population is dwarfed by NYC's (even though it's the 2nd biggest city).  The only fucked up thing I know about is that prisoners (primarily New Yorkers in Upstate prisons) get counted towards the population of the towns they are imprisoned in despite having no access to their roads or post offices or anything like that, causing funds to leave the poor neighborhoods they tend to be from and go to dinky little towns that tend to be at least decent."

If some one says something about food and I have some leftovers, or just went grocery shopping and have some fruit, I always offer the food. You don't want it, you get nothing because you lied. But basically everybody else gets change. Even if it's just a few pennies.  Sometimes it's easier to give someone a few pennies than listen to the weird stories, or try to come up with more efficient ways of turning someone down. I always say, ""I wish I had more to give you."" but then again, I really do mean it.     There was this guy sitting at the 8 Mile/Woodward corner that I'd never seen before. He was reading a book, no sign. I got his attention, asked if he was just enjoying the weather, or if he needed help with anything. He told me he was enjoying the weather, but that he did need some help too. He had gone on an interview, they wanted him, but someone had stolen his wallet containing his license and social security card, and he couldn't start until he replaced them. He was worried he wouldn't be able to get enough money in time to get a new id and that they would give the job to some one else. I forked over a pile of quarters from my pocket. He was so grateful. In that moment I didn't care if his story was a sack of shit or the truth, I was just happy to see that look on his face.  Next day I see him again, and he gives me a thumbs up and a wave. I stop and talk to him again. He says thanks and tells me that I must have been some sort of good luck charm, because five more people right after me, gave him a decent amount of change. I tell him that's great and ask how far off he is from meeting his goal to be able to afford a new id. $5. I give him a ten spot and tell him the other 5 is for bus fare to get to the secretary of state. He actually fished around in his pocket to give me five back in change. He said, I had been too generous already and he couldn't accept that from me. I told him to keep it, and good luck with the job.  3 weeks go by and I finally see him again. He posted up at the same corner, not to ask for change, but waiting to see me so he could tell me that he started his job, and to say thank you again. I couldn't fucking believe it.     That's why I always keep change. It started out because it was easier to give than to say no, but after that guy, I realized it's easier to just be good to others."

Getting the same lines over and over can be disheartening if you are really trying to help someone. My solution was to carry an apple or banana with me every day. On the very likely chance someone would ask me for money on my way to/from work i would offer them that instead. Some of them took it with an incredible amount of gratitude and others refused. I kept track of who always refused and just ignored them (headphones are a marvelous thing).  That being said, you would be surprised at how many are telling the truth about bus fare. It is common practice in so many suburban towns for police to put beggars on the bus to Detroit just to get them out of the area. I know they don't necessarily own a house but you can still call a place home anyway. A lot of these people ask for change as well to obtain a cell phone. I know it seems like the last thing a man struggling for food would need is an iPhone. When your life is in that spot though, the difference between just offing yourself and living another day could be a simple phone call to an old friend. These people live lives of isolation and having that phone is having a connection to the world at large. People often mistake how important a few words from a loved one can be.  Tldr; carry an apple/banana with you. Beggars are not all liars. Beggars use money for things other than alcohol."
Detroit,3d8sru,TheBimpo,6,Tue Jul 14 12:51:47 2015 UTC,"I'm so glad you brought up the phone.  It can be the one connection someone has to let their family know they're alive, and can save their life if they are ever in trouble.  It allows them to reach out for help.    I also am downtown all the time and a respectful ""sir"" or ""ma'am"" can go a long way.  If you want to abate some guilt- then maybe volunteer or donate to a homeless services program once in a while and provide the number.  Just remember they are trying to make a living and survive.  Circumstances -whether their choice or not- put them there."
Detroit,3d8sru,primesuspect,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:29:01 2015 UTC,I worked at a veterans shelter downtown and all of the homeless (vets anyway) had a cell phone and plan provided to them. I don't know if that was a Veteran's Hospital thing or a State program though.
Detroit,3d8sru,Norfolkpine,10,Tue Jul 14 15:59:35 2015 UTC,"I worked in an area of Seattle that had a high homeless population, I dealt with this daily for a few years. I never did/do carry cash, but a dismissive ""Sorry man"" sometimes got aggressive responses. One day a guy asked me and I just said ""Look man, I'm married, I don't get to carry any cash"". He started laughing and said something like ""You're alright man"" and we went on our way. So, that's what I ALWAYS say now, like Colt 45 it works every time."
Detroit,3d8sru,primesuspect,9,Tue Jul 14 13:10:47 2015 UTC,"My general rule is: obvious health problem? I'll throw cash. Asking in front of a restaurant? I always offer food. I'll always go in and try to buy a decent meal, even asking them what they like/prefer. Homeless people are people just like us and some of them do have dietary concerns.  You can pretty quickly shake out who wants money for booze/drugs using the food method.  On the other hand, who am I to judge? Sometimes I throw someone a buck and if they buy booze? Who cares. I buy booze too. I'm priveleged enough to have a home, running utilities, a job, clean clothes, a comfortable place to sleep, all the food I can eat, and people who love me. If someone is so miserable they're begging for money for a mini-bottle of Jack on the street wearing shoes with holes in them, then damn... Have the Jack.   I don't often give money but I don't second guess intentions or motives anymore. Sometimes it's just like... go ahead, get some small pleasure out of this shit life, man. Go for it."
Detroit,3d8sru,BigNikiStyle,3,Tue Jul 14 13:55:13 2015 UTC,"I'm often the same way.  I know so many people are like ok, if you want food, I'll get you some food; here's a sandwich.  Oh, you don't really want food, the money you want is actually for alcohol or drugs?  WELL THEN FUCK YOU, YOU PIECE OF SHIT.  GO TO HELL YOU JUNKIE!  And then act all righteous that they discovered the beggar wants evil bad drugs and not food.  Way to go you wizard, yeah, fuck that junkie.  Drug addicts should just go somewhere out of sight and die slow painful deaths, right?  Wrong.  Everything is so wrong about this.  Not saying it's your job to help every junkie out there, but have some fucking sympathy for a human being.  I love the young hypocrites the best- oh, I get trashed every weekend and love to party and get wasted, and I have a job and a house; so that guy on the street who is wasted by drugs must have done something wrong and is a bad person.     I can't write well on my phone.  Check out this guy, his perspective about addiction is fucking correct and may change how you feel about those guys on the street.  I still am frustrated and exhausted by beggars, and rarely give them money, and quite a few are actually pretty fucked up people, but I do care for them.  https://www.ted.com/talks/johann_hari_everything_you_think_you_know_about_addiction_is_wrong?language=en  Edit:  source- I've struggled with addiction, and it was luck and privilege and the support I others that allowed me to thrive.

He never asked me for money and I felt bad for him, so I always offered. He has since disappeared.  When I am on my way into work, I'm in the mode of ""ugh, I have to talk to people all night long and hear their stories,"" so the last thing I want to do is hear a beggar's story. It is selfish, but I am sure any one of you who works in a bar can relate. The most recent time I actually responded to a beggar was when I said, ""No, but do YOU have any change for me?! I have f#$@ing student loans, rent, and other bills."" He didn't like that and cussed me out. It's whatever. Like I said, I just ignore them now."

It's a little hazy because I was on one my constitutionals (solo benders). I walking out of a bar, probably on my way to the titty bar to see if there were any single-moms with rent due, when a gentleman accosted me. He had some story about needing to get back to the homeless shelter in the Cass Corridor and being hungry. He was asking for a couple bucks for a forty to drink on the way (I believe I was near Greek Town.)   As I was particularly drunk and gregarious at the time, I said, well it's almost last call let's go grab a drink and I'll drive you back to the shelter. I took the gentleman to The Well and treated him to a few libations and asked him to hold my seat while I banged some chubby chick in town on business in the bathroom. I probably didn't need him to, as there were only about eight people in the bar, but you never want to lose your seat. After The Well had long closed we departed. The gentleman, unaccustomed to the pace I insisted on, was quite in his cups. I decided that we needed nourishment before making the trek to the homeless shelter, so we dined like kings at finest establishment open at the hour. That is of course, Coney.   After gorging ourselves on the divine culinary creations our fine city has to offer, I took him back to the homeless shelter. We parted ways, after what I am sure was one of the finest nights of his life."

Detroit,3d5t1v,D2-D2,25,Mon Jul 13 19:21:56 2015 UTC,"Just to make sure everyone's clear on how the public portion of the Red Wings Arena is funded:  The Downtown Development Authority was created back in the 1980s. It captures a portion of the property taxes (city, county, school district, etc) generated by an increase in property values over the year it was created. This is called ""tax increment financing."" For the arena, the Authority expanded its boundary to surround the Cass Park area, including the arena site. It will capture a portion of the increase in property taxes in that area over the values in, I think, 2014. It borrowed money to pay its share (40%) of the upfront construction and will pay it back with the new revenue created. If the revenue isn't enough, the State is on the hook to pay the debt.  The plus side is that (in theory) the arena is paid for by the increase in property values in surrounding property (the increase is a near certainty given how desolate the area is now), so the arena is paid for (again in theory) with revenues that wouldn't exist if it wasn't built. No money from the City of Detroit's budget is being used for the arena, and, if the values rise as expected, the only taxpayers paying for the arena will be those in the immediate vicinity (mostly the Ilitch family).   The downsides are that the city, county, and schools lose out on the revenue from increased values near the arena, and that the State is the backup option if the values don't rise enough. Also, the arena itself won't be taxed, which is frustrating because it would probably pay for itself over the life of the bonds.  (Trying to present a balanced description of how the financing works)"

No money from the City of Detroit's budget is being used for the arena,    That's correct.  The tax money is ""captured"" before it enters the City of Detroit's budget.  It's an accounting treatment of the numbers.  Similarly, my share of social security taxes don't come out of my budget, because they deducted from my paycheck before I ever see them money.  I'm not trying to say you hid this point.   It's right up there when you wrote ""the city, county, and schools lose out on the revenue from increased values near the arena"".   I just wanted to amplify it.

Also, given the direction real estate is headed in Downtown/Midtown Detroit, do we really think values won't rise over the next decade or so in the Cass Park area? That was part of the thinking as well, I'm sure.   Oh, as an edit, I don't think anyone is claiming that it will raise tax revenues noticeably on a City-wide scale. But it doesn't have to do that - it only has to raise them in the immediate vicinity to pay off the bonds."
Detroit,3d5t1v,Khorasaurus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:13:36 2015 UTC,Thanks for the explanation.
Detroit,3d5t1v,georgehotelling,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:42:31 2015 UTC,"The only problem with this line of thinking is that gravel lots and windowless buildings that are there, many of them, were bought by the Ilitch's 5 years ago. They purposely didn't improve them so they could buy the remaining surrounding ones cheap. I feel this is an overlooked fact."
Detroit,3d5t1v,DetroitEastSider,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:25:09 2015 UTC,"this is a good run-down and the oft-overlooked aspect of these deals. You're correct on the downside element, but i think the net positive is the growth it will drive elsewhere, overall improving other areas of revenue for the city - parking, ticketing, income tax, sales tax(from the state), city services, etc. Overall that net positive will drive improvement in the city services generally. people will argue that the money should be put to schools etc first rather than any other development, but it's a catch 22 and this has the best long-term potential payoff with actual momentum behind it."
Detroit,3d5t1v,MGoAzul,10,Mon Jul 13 20:23:52 2015 UTC,"I know Detroit is unique, but that has not happened anywhere. The MLS tricked poor cities across the nation with this line, and they are all fucked because of it. When people go to New York Red Bulls games, they jump back on the train back to the city, they're not hanging out in Harrison, NJ (Newark's even poorer neighbor). Hell, George Steinbrenner tricked the people of New York into subsidizing a smaller stadium across the street from the old Yankee Stadium.   The Red Wings play 41 home games a year, people live in homes 365 days a year, where they buy food and pay taxes and get tickets, people work in offices 250 days a year buying lunch and various things as they go home. There's much better development schemes than throwing money at a private company (yes, we all love our hometeams, but they're a money making machine for billionaires.)"
Detroit,3d5t1v,JJFO,2,Tue Jul 14 01:11:13 2015 UTC,"Actually it did happen in Grand Rapids, and to some extent Baltimore. But you're generally right - sports venues aren't saviors.  The two things I think this project has going for it that others do not are 1) the offices/apartments built right into the arena (24/7 activity regardless of whether there is a game going on) and 2) the public financing plan that basically taxes the Ilitches to pay for the arena, rather than the general public."

Detroit,3d5t1v,magic6435,8,Mon Jul 13 23:05:06 2015 UTC,"I think one very important difference to remember about the development of the Red Wing stadium vs other stadium developments is that the new Red Wings stadium is also developing lots of housing in a time where a rash of building is starting to take place in Brush Park which helps connect the very ""in demand"" downtown and midtown neighborhoods which increases the vitality of inner city Detroit as a whole. if the new stadium were just a building surrounded by a sea of parking like the palace, my (and many others) opinion would be more than a little critical."
Detroit,3d5t1v,ginger_guy,5,Mon Jul 13 20:42:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the actual stadium site will include offices, retail, and residential, plus the Eddystone renovation, which is awesome.  Now, many people are concerned that that isn't going to stop a sea of parking being created, especially on the blocks immediately north."
Detroit,3d5t1v,Khorasaurus,3,Mon Jul 13 21:08:19 2015 UTC,I think you hit the nail on the head. This is very different from other stadiums. Its not an arena in a sea of concrete out in the suburbs. Its right in between two nice spots of detroit. And that spot in between downtown and midtown is pretty desolate and bad. Eliminating that and bridging the two areas will be great. I just wish they 75 didn't cut right through. They should turn it into a tunnel from Grand River to Brush.
Detroit,3d5t1v,Get2BirdsStoned,2,Tue Jul 14 02:17:56 2015 UTC,"His overall piece is good, but the Detroit deal is far more complex than he cared to explain as /u/khorasauus pointed out.    Lets not also forget of the net benefit that will come from getting the team off to river front.  Detroit is widely regarded as one of the most wasted waterfronts in the country as far as big cities are concerned.  The abandonment of the JLA site will open a massive chunk of prime real estate that is ripe for development. That development will create jobs and increase tax revenue and values in the area."

For the first time in a long time, it actually makes business sense for them to hold true to their promises. More people downtown means more people renting and leasing their properties; more sales in their businesses; more people attending their games. This bodes well for the city too - more people paying taxes; more people spending more; more business taxes; etc etc/.   From a business perspective it would be irresponsible to not hold true to their development claims. Added to this they actually accelerated their construction timeline and plan to build many of the ""communities/neighborhoods"" w/in the 3 year timeline for the arena."

There aren't any studies with actual data that support it. No matter how crazy the scheme, it just is a net loss for the community that does it, and we all need to say no to this nonsense.   And no amount of homer pounding of the chest and saying, ""Well OUR deal is different!"" will make those facts go away. Our deal isn't different, even if Illitch isn't over the top in attempting to fleece us like other owners have fleeced their communities. Local governments should assist in cleaning up local zoning and other things to help get it built, but we all lose when we kick in to fund it."
Detroit,3d5t1v,Banzai51,-4,Tue Jul 14 11:43:50 2015 UTC,I'm srry bit this deal was just wacky. First how much did the county/city put in to build Comerica Park? Your taxes are going towards a sporting venue where you have the pleasure of $10 beers. Stadiums are not solid municipal investments let alone for cities facing the challenges in Detroit. Lastly why flood the downtown core with another large sporting venue?

Detroit,3d6nwu,Khorasaurus,8,Tue Jul 14 02:42:08 2015 UTC,"I find it interesting that people are talking about Ferndale as if it is a totally separate place from Detroit. Sure, it's a separate city, but it is only a 15 minute drive or a slightly longer bus ride from Downtown/Midtown. It's more like an outlying neighborhood than a true suburb. When deciding Midtown vs Ferndale, for instance, the decision is more the envionment you want, rather than choosing a separate place - the decision is whether you want a very urban environment with large apartment buildings and retail everywhere or one with more trees and single family homes, with a central business district you can walk to.   Royal Oak and Grosse Pointe Park (and to some extent Dearborn) are in the same boat, too, I think.  The answer to the original question is ""yes, Detroit would be great for you."" Then, when deciding on a neighborhood, is when you decide whether you want to be in the core of the city or one of the outlying funky/urban places."

Further out you have the dunes in the western and northern parts of the state. Western and Northern Michigan are breathtakingly beautiful and relatively unspoiled.

Best stuff for nature is hours from Detroit. Detroit itself doesnt have much of a outdoor hiking culture. Boating and hunting is far more popular. Ann Arbor is little ways outside the city and is far more outdoorsly and very liberal/gay friendly. Come check out the area. I personally like Ann Arbor more than Detroit although it can be more stuck up at times.  You should check out Detroit though. It is different than any US city ive ever been to, both good and bad.  I saw someone before say that it has some of the best and worst people in American living here. It can be as violent and bleak as people say, but it can be cool too."
Detroit,3d6nwu,Unicycldev,-3,Tue Jul 14 14:40:10 2015 UTC,"I would recommend Ann Arbor or Royal Oak in the metro. Detroit is pretty dead (compared to most cities) except for small parts of downtown and a lot of mid town up to the university. It is slowly getting better though. The highway infrastructure is way over kill for the cities current population so commuting from the suburbs is cheaper, easy, and regarded by many as safer.  There isn't much of a ""back country"" of sorts in Michigan. The glaciers that created the lakes flattened the land out pretty well. All of the scenic places in Michigan are a good 250+ miles from the city in the Northern Lower and Upper Peninsula. ( bear dunes, traverse city, etc)  Google and wikipedia has a lot of interesting information about the the whole detroit area.   edit: Some cool pics of detroit from the sky : Detroit By Air"
Detroit,3d6nwu,thankyoueric,9,Mon Jul 13 23:35:26 2015 UTC,"Detroit is far from dead. Midtown is just as busy as Royal Oak. Downtown is nice but expensive. Corktown is an artsier area but it's starting to get a little pricier now. If you can swing it, Corktown is probably an area that would interest you.  As far as back country, there's plenty. You have to accept that it's going to be a different sort though. You won't find any mountains in Michigan but the West side of the state is beautiful. That Manitou Islands both have primitive back country camping. Way up North, Isle Royale is the most secluded National Park in the country. Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lake Shore is beautiful and has good hiking, but gets a little crowded. Pictured Rocks National Lake Shore also has good hiking but is really best explored by kayak. If you cross the border over to Canada, Bruce Peninsula National Park is only a few hours away. I'm not sure about the quality of backcountry in Ohio, but Hocking Hills and Coyahuga Falls both have pretty nice day trails and camp sites."
Detroit,3d6nwu,Skillsjr,3,Tue Jul 14 01:31:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think at this point the big difference between Detroit and ""most cities"" is the second ring of neighborhoods around downtown. You have a solid first ring, but outside of that you kind of have to jump to the suburbs to find a good place to live (with some exceptions, like the Villages, the Palmer Woods/Sherwood Forest area, etc). Detroit's core is far from dead, but the outlying neighborhoods are struggling."
Detroit,3d6nwu,BaboonRockFighter,2,Tue Jul 14 02:51:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, Midtown and Downtown are active places and really great to the go to. It is just important to consider that they only account for about about 1/6th of the area of what is technically the city of Detroit and are expensive to live in.   The vast majority of people you see in these places are from the suburbs who commute in. Places like Farmington, Livonia, Southfield, Dearborn, etc. ( all 20 min or less drive from the city)"

The surrounding areas, maybe, but Grand Rapids itself is extremely progressive, and not just because it's in shambles like Detroit (not meant in a bad way, just so much sprawl and decay has created a pretty laissez faire oversight/attitude). It genuinely has quite the liberal environment and is very artsy as well. I was very surprised myself as to how liberal the city is. Now, if you go west a little bit, boom bible thumpers everywhere."
Detroit,3d6nwu,packy11,3,Tue Jul 14 14:38:42 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree. Grand Rapids is definitely behind Detroit in just about every descriptor OP is looking for. It's highly religious, very conservative both fiscally and socially, and has major race and gender issues. The only way it could possibly be described as ""progressive"" is in comparison to the rest of western MI, which isn't much of a compliment.  In regards to living there - i.e., how easy it is to make friends, have fun, and get around - I have a friend who moved there from Detroit and described it as ""a bunch of WASP-y, post-college-but-still-acting-like-college, rich white parents of small children"", with problematic suburban sprawl (""you have to drive everywhere"") and zero culture (""there's nearly nothing to do but drink"").  It's a great place for someone who fits into heteronormative white culture, wants an office job and a suburban home, doesn't mind chain restaurants, and can get their fill of arts and culture from ""art fairs"" and ""artist studios"" full of blown glass trinkets, mediocre landscape photography, and passé scrap-metal garden sculptures.

Detroit,3d6nwu,melissqua,0,Tue Jul 14 16:10:52 2015 UTC,"Well since your opinion is based off of other opinions, agree to disagree with them. But since I actually have done this transition and have lived in both cities, currently, GR is tremendously better than Detroit. It's ok if you don't agree with me, but I can make several objective and subjective reasons it is better.   However, literally everything you just mentioned is how I would describe Detroit, not GR so I'm a little confused. Seriously that is exactly the opposite of how I feel and would describe the situation.  GR is a bustling cultural center, and not in any way a sprawling suburban area. That is the one thing about Detroit I hate and it is the infrastructure. I have lived in the GR city limits, walking distance or biking to everywhere I go, including work, except for the grocery store. I have considered getting rid of my car.   I HATE chain anythings, so I frequent several of the great local breweries, restaurants, coffee shops, delis, markets, etc. I will admit Detroit has a lot to offer in this element, but that is also due to their ethnic diversity. Nonetheless, GR is not too shabby.   To downplay the ""art fairs"" and ""artist studios"" is just cruel. ArtPrize is the largest art festival in the entire world. Period. So that argument is null and void. There are several awesome art museums such as the GRAM and Fredrik Meijer Garden's, not to mention the small, hipster-type studios and shows.  The topography is vastly superior than the East side. Two words... Lake Michigan. There is a beautiful river that runs directly through the city, and several more state parks and local parks around the area for biking, hiking, relaxing, discing, etc. Oh and if you like small quaint beaches, we've got those too, along with Grand Haven, Holland, Muskegon and South Haven. Sand dunes, forests, and beautiful water.   I think Grand Rapids is perfect for this couple. Literally to a T. But if you still think the West side is the way you describe, that's fine, I think you are more suited for the metropolis, suburban, commercial, and boring East side. Also, this is from an area roughly 1/5 the size of Metro Detroit"

They did this with out destroying some of the beauty that detroit once had. They saved a decent amount of the oirgional building and i believe they have done an overall good job. Here are some more photos of the building: photo 1 b4 photo 2 b4 photo 3 b4 photo 4 b4 photo 5 b4    photo 1 after photo 1 after photo 1 after    looks like they did a good job to me!! and they saved a lot of the exterior

It's just a small snippet about how emergency services lack support within Detroit, and why so many neighborhoods look the way they do.   The part that has stuck with me the longest was when the firefighters were talking about being called to an abandoned house fire. They said they could never assume that the house was completely empty, because sometimes homeless people might be sleeping inside. :-("

I haven't been there by car since they started enforcing the passes, but I get the impression that it's not meant to be a high security thing - you can buy the pass, or if you get caught without one you get a ticket for the same amount. No big deal.  And I seem to recall when the DNR was making the deal with the city, they pretty emphatically stated that it had no plans to put up  a real guard house or gates to control access."

Anyway:  You have to start at a reasonably classy place to toast each other and enjoy your company before things get too sloppy. I recommend Fountain Bistro. Grab a table out on Campus Martius and a few bottles of champagne. If you call ahead, in the past they have done champagne sabrage which is definitely a cool thing for a bachelor party.   From there, I would go to Cafe D'Mongo's. A little louder (or a lot louder, depending on how late it is), still a fun place to be before things get sloppy. Come to think of it, you may want to do D'Mongo's first and Fountain Bistro second to make things easier coming from the Book Cadillac.  From there, The Well or Firebird Lounge. Loud, fun, good places for drinking with the option of dancing. Apparently Firebird has cover on the weekends now?   From there, Fishbones. Walk in, do a round of sake bombs,  walk out.  From there, you have options for very crowded drunk, crowded places. Think of  Level Two, Deluxe, or The Old Shillelagh  (all in Greektown, although Shillelagh may be a bit young for you).

Detroit,3d2qva,MGoAzul,3,Mon Jul 13 02:06:22 2015 UTC,Detroit's riverfront has been traditionally used for heavy industry.  The transition to the type of riverfront that you are describing is a long process due to the heavy industrial clean up and remediation required.
Detroit,3d2qva,detroiter1987,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:11:40 2015 UTC,"Very true about much of the riverfront, but I think all of the land from The Ren Cen to Belle Isle would have been a great spot to develop green spaces, apartments, parks and an overall lively area.

Detroit,3d2qva,pug_puncher,5,Mon Jul 13 02:29:25 2015 UTC,I don't know what you are talking about to be honest.  There are at least 5 parks from the Ren Cen to Belle Isle and numerous apartments along the stretch you just described?
Detroit,3d2qva,johnrgrace,-2,Mon Jul 13 03:03:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know there's stuff out there, but for the most part, the waterfront is still lacking in a lot of aspects.

Detroit,3d2qva,ConeySauce,2,Mon Jul 13 05:09:56 2015 UTC,"Have you walked from the Rencen towards Belle Isle in the past year?  The pathway directly on the river is amazing.  The DNR center opens in a week, you can see the construction going on next to it right now.  The private business infill isn't there yet...  Also checkout the architectural model in the front entrance of the Rencen, I snapped a photo a few months ago http://imgur.com/yLjqbij There was a plan for more on the riverfront but economic factors disrupted it, but there are plans in the works for development it's just going to take years.  Detroit is just getting to the point where new construction without subsidies makes sense.  Just give it time."
Detroit,3d2qva,imtheBlackSheep21,2,Mon Jul 13 13:13:03 2015 UTC,"And a lot of that land you mention is former industrial sites. The area right next to Belle Isle was the site of a huge Uniroyal plant, and it's still in the process of a long remediation before anything can be developed there. The huge Parke Davis pharmaceutical research laboratory is now an apartment complex. The big chunk of land closest to downtown was cleared out in the 90s to make way for the casinos... which wound up being built elsewhere.  As for green spaces and parks, I'm not sure what you're talking about. Most of the riverfront has seen significant improvements in recent years. You've got the River Walk, of course. The Dequindre Cut, which is adding an extension to Eastern Market. Milliken State Park just added an outdoor adventure center. An apartment development is going in right next to it. I was down there about a week ago and it was absolutely packed with people from all over.  Plus, Mt. Elliott Park just got a huge revamp, with a splash pad!. Oh and let's not forget West Riverfront Park (west of the Joe) which just opened and has already hosted two huge concerts this summer.  I think you just need to get out more."

Couple food trucks and shopping stores.  I'd visit that often."

Detroit,3d0qma,sousaman,6,Sun Jul 12 15:26:57 2015 UTC,If it ends up happening this one will be no where near as large as the August event. Many classic car owners are terrified at the prospect of bringing their car out in the snow.

It's definitely a better idea than this thing.   The different market driver, though, is that I don't know if that's a big market (4x4 events but like the Dream Cruise) in the winter.  I do know there are some big Volvo and Euro- and Asian-specific events that happen across the country but they are in the summer.  Not sure how to market this so that it's not redneck concentrated."

Detroit,3d0ohp,XVOS,3,Sun Jul 12 15:06:51 2015 UTC,"If you don't have an insurance line already, then I would suggest shopping around.  Try:  http://www.vantolins.com/ first.  Then try: https://www.statefarm.com/agent/US/MI/Berkley/Rick-Stander-RB1JW1YS000  Chris and Rick are both great insurance agents. They know their products. Chris is independent, so he'll shop the policy for you. Rick is with State Farm exclusively. Chris works for for-profit companies, whereas, Rick works for a mutual company (which basically is looking to just break even).   If you do have car insurance already, or any other insurance, it's good to shop it out once a year. It's pretty easy to do and can end up saving you a lot."

Reading metro times, and checking out r/Detroit for upcoming events is smart as well.  Be sure to check out things like eastern market, belle isle, and the river walk while it's still warm, winter isn't here yet but it's always around the corner and will be different than in Houston.

Detroit,3d19xx,imtheBlackSheep21,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:31:36 2015 UTC,"I just moved from Houston last fall, but I grew up in Michigan.  First off, I don't think the food here is any where near as good or as cheap, especially when it comes to groceries.  I guess if Detroit/Michigan specializes in anything, it's coney dogs, Polish food, and fresh fish.  Belleville is generally a pretty quite place, I hear the lake is nice.  First off, take advantage of summer while you can.  Take at least one trip to Lake Michigan, and I don't mean going to Chicago.  Go through Grand Rapids up to the lake or either South/Grand Haven, or Silver Lake Sand Dunes.  Those would all be good day trips.  For a weekend, Sleeping Bear Dunes, Petosky, Traverse City, Mackinaw are all good.  Those are all trips though.  For something close to Belleville: 1)  Detroit: Belle Isle, Eastern Market, Detroit Zoo, Polish food from Hamtramck, Lafayette Coney Island (cash only), Dime Store, and personally I like walking around downtown, especially Campus Martius.  2) Ann Arbor: 1) Art Fair next weekend, UofM, Blimpy Burger.  Take some time though to enjoy the outdoors.  People here enjoy the outdoors the way Austin does.  There are rivers, lakes, beaches, etc.  Most of it is up north so it's a couple hours. But in Belleville you are right on a huge chain of lakes so that's convenient."
Detroit,3d19xx,imtheBlackSheep21,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:59:10 2015 UTC,Thanks man! I appreciate the advice.
Detroit,3d19xx,ornryactor,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:24:23 2015 UTC,"Kind of wanted to piggy back this, I would take a shot at some excellent Middle Eastern food you'll find throughout the Metro Area. Dearborn, MI in particular, I don't know if it still hold true, but I think we have the largest Middle Eastern population of anywhere outside the Middle East itself and the people of that region brought a lot of the great food culture with them.   Shawarmas (meat, pickles, onions, tomatoes, and a garlic yogurt sauce) throughout the area are excellent (look up Bucharest, local favorite), also there's a substantial number Mexican and Caribbean immigrants who brought some excellent food to the downtown too. Definitely worth a look."

Detroit,3d19xx,primesuspect,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:27:23 2015 UTC,"Taqueria Lupita's in Mexican Village has never let me down. Great fresh taste, good prices, food is usually cooked and made well by people who know what they doing, also El Barzon is great too.  As far as Caribbean if your interested I'd suggest The Jamaican Pot on 8 mile, the surrounding neighborhood is etchy some I usually go in the afternoons. Some of the BEST jerk chicken and curried goat you could find and great rice and vegetables too.  Arab food wise, anywhere in Dearborn. Al Ameer is AWESOME and Shatila's is pretty good too, there so many though and each is different in a way it would difficult to name them all. Throw a penny I guess LoL."

It just doesn't make sense unless they are passionate about something that is driving them to Detroit.   Nothing wrong with that writer staying in NY but you have to realize he's writing for the NYT. He's already got a checkmark on his bucket list for just that. Likely the bucket list doesn't involve Detroit in any way.  And that's fine. People want to be where they are doing what they want at any point in time.  This is just the way it is. Life is life.   What we have to realize is that this NYT writer sees a value in Detroit despite not wanting to be here himself. Just like someone can see the value in living in say Austin but not living there or even moving there.  Detroit--despite having a lot of problems--is one of my favorite cities in the country. I'm most certainly not alone in seeing that value.  Disclosure: Not from Detroit. Wife is--went to HS at Chadsey. Lived in DFW, Phoenix, NOLA and SF. Not a spring chicken."

One of the nicest things about being in downtown Detroit is that I can look around and go places without being shoulder to shoulder with people. I can enjoy the city. Plus, the buildings are gorgeous! Even the grit is fascinating to look at. Also, I don't feel the racial tension that I feel in Portland. I'm a real chatterbox and I'm a curious person; both times, every last person I stopped to talk to took the time to speak with me. It was very nice. If I thought I could even remotely handle the winter, I'd move there. I'll be the first to admit though, I'm way too much of a baby."

Hispanics act like they don't speak English, black people brush you off, Middle Eastern won't speak to you at all, Russians are hostile, and white people are snobby. I've been to other large cities and have not experienced this, I think it's a huge Portland ""thing."" I have considered the move to Detroit and I literally don't think I could handle the winters.

That being said, the Upper Peninsula has the Porkies, smallish mountains, but beautiful scenery and since the U.P. is mostly uninhabited it makes a excellent natural wonder to experience. Great hiking, canoeing, and biking to be had there. Go there next time you get the chance.    As far as winter.....  Yeah if you don't like cold wouldn't recommend LoL.

I respect many southerners don't look at the flag as a side in a war that fought to continue racism but as a flag of their southern heritage as (self-described) rebels/rednecks. It probably needed to come down because many view it as a flag of oppression. I just wish it didn't take some kid killing nine people to force the discussion.

But out of all the controversial comments that have come out of his mouth in recent months, the fact that Sharpton is taking issue with the confederate flag just seems fucking stupid.           Do I think anyone should ""take pride"" in the confederate flag? Absolutely not. I definitely think it has no place on government property. The South (read: not Romeo, Michigan) lost the Civil War! I don't really want to see the King's flag flying on state property, either. Also, I don't care what people try to say, that symbol does have racial connotations to it. Whether those who display it in 2015 do so to convey that image intentionally or not, it's still there. But protesting Kid Rock over it? He didn't stop using it the first time people got upset over it in 2008. He didn't stop using it in 2011 when he was given an award by the Detroit chapter of the NAACP for his contributions to the area, despite people protesting.      To his ""credit"" (that was hard to type!), he's always maintained that it's only about tipping his hat to southern rock music. He started using the flag in 2008, which happens to coincide with the year he released a single that sampled Lynyrd Skynyrd. It was seriously part of a marketing plan. Kid Rock is like Ted Nugent or even Eminem -- he markets himself as not giving a fuck/being ""edgy"" to sell records and tickets to his target audience. And that's fine because AMERICA!         He's not going to stop using it and Sharpton is just giving him a platform and free advertising. Then Megyn Kelly gives Sharpton a platform. It's like a circlejerk of obnoxiousness all over the damn place. As for Chevy, they might take some heat for co-sponsoring his tour but I doubt it'll have any real impact at the end of the day.

Detroit,3ct9wj,LeftDetroitThrowAway,6,Fri Jul 10 16:24:42 2015 UTC,"Rumors of demolition were quick to follow, but a lack of money kept the bulldozers at bay. In 2005, developers who revamped the Carlton Hotel across Woodward in Brush Park got the city to grant the Eddystone and Park Avenue hotels local designation, to help pave the way for their redevelopment into condos or apartments. The projects never happened.   This is a key point when people lament Detroit tearing down another ""historic"" building. It only recently became ""historic"", and it was simply because a developer used the designation in a failed real estate gamble. The place is a dump, and I distinctly remember it also being a dump back in the 1990s when it was open. At one point it may have been beautiful. However, I believe that point has long since passed."

We can debate the merit of its stature and style to the Whitney Building, Book Cadillac, and others to which it doesn't compare, but it does have value in the materials and details. These things are not easily (and thus not often) reproduced.  I think most people lament the loss in principle rather than for the building.  Detroit has lost so much of its urban fabric and this is the continuation of that destruction.      Personally I am ok with trading the Park Ave Hotel for the Eddystone.  It doesn't hurt nearly as bad as losing the Statler or Lafayette."
Detroit,3ct9wj,himynameiszck,0,Fri Jul 10 21:39:55 2015 UTC,"The reason I'm generally against tearing down existing buildings is that it's almost always cheaper to renovate them to modern standards than it is to build the same density of apartments from scratch. It's not that the building has historical significance, it's that Midtown has a severe housing shortage.  If the building were to stay up even in its abandoned state, dozens of apartments would theoretically be added to the market much sooner because of simple economics.  On the other hand, I'm pretty damn excited to go watch a building implode in a couple hours."

They came after Fairy. The property owners probably weren't even aware of what had happened or who and done it until the city contacted them (this part is speculation, but I feel pretty confident saying it).

First, police don't have a lot of discretion when it comes to felonies. Misdemeanors, sure. Felonies, no.   Judges have a lot discretion on sentencing, and in some cases interpretation.   Prosecutors certainly have a lot discretion when it comes to prosecution. I happen to know a lot of prosecutors in Wayne County, so when I draw my trademarked giant-ejaculating wang on your front door, they might use their discretion and praise me for my artwork instead of prosecuting me. I am sure you'd think that was fair.  What you're missing isn't that want to ""crucify"" him. It's that they want to show that they're applying the law equally. Let's say he shows up and goes to trial. First, the prosecutors have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that his ""graffiti"" caused damage in excess of $1,000. Well, to me that's hard to prove. How much did he get paid to paint on Gilbert's building? So, if the dude just got paid to paint an occupied building and he just painted yours for free, you can make a reasonable case that he was doing charity work.   However, people who owned the buildings wanted charges brought against him. The prosecutors, who work for the people, did so. This is how the criminal justice system is supposed to work. ""Hey, I am a famous artist!"" isn't a get out of prosecution card.   Personally, I'd be stoked if he painted something on the side of my house.

If we're going to arrest local kids who tag buildings w/o permission you have to enforce them against artists like Fairey. it sets a bad precedent if you don't at the very least make a public scene about it (even if they eventually do nothing or simply have him pay a fine). but failing to do anything brings about selective prosecution issues and the public will cry afoul at that. It's a slippery slope (which is a legal fallacy but still), fail to prosecute him and at the next incident they cry foul for not prosecuting Fairey"

The entire student base that lives in Midtown cannot support a business that charges $40 per haircut.   Let's figure out how we can push for more of these buildings to get redeveloped... there's still plenty of buildings in Midtown that are gutted, let's speed up the process of whatever needs to be done. Neglectful property owner? Get it some media attention. Property owner needs development credits because the profit-margins are still shitty in Midtown? Let's figure out how we can speed that up as well. Property for sale? Shit, let's pool what little money we have and let's make it happen. If 300 of us didn't get a $40 haircut per month, that's $12,000. It's dogshit but it's a start. (The last couple of sentences are sort of sarcastic.)"

Willy's, along with us (Fellow) were definitely in the dark about what would happen when building ownership changed. Jack White was in about two weeks ago touring the spaces and apparently decided he wanted our space over Willy's. He bought out the lease because if we had stayed, we would have been removed.

They were there before any of those other businesses and they sell an entirely different product and image. I'm speaking mainly of Shinola and their sister store Willy's. The people of whom I speak with respect to their reception are local business owners who supply to Shinola and have on one occasion or another felt slighted or exploited by the Shinola brand.

People oft speak ill of Shinola as exploiting the city or the city's story. But the fact is they choose Detroit as the place to start and grow their company. And that makes a world of difference to the 300+ people who work at the headquarters and store, right here in Detroit. Many of those employees live in the city, all pay city income tax.       Density is what makes a city great. Density of people, of cultures, of choices. If the product doesn't speak to you that is ok. Support the businesses that do. Just drop the Shinola hate.

You can't make them love you, you can't make them want to have a relationship with you.  Think about what is good for them. I don't think the types of people likely to be in a correctional facility are going to be good for them.

What if your son gets on that person's bad side?  Or let's talk about your 9 year old. Let's say she hears the foul, nasty language from some staff members who think nobody's looking (and I hope that's all they do around her!). Do you think that's good for her?

The judge is working on granting the father custody. The question: Will it matter at this point. Even if the kids are transferred into his custody and they live in Israel, will they stay in contact with him when they grow up?

In the trial transcripts the judge is trying to punish the kids for not liking the father. It's clear.

If it becomes the norm that they are carrying around a ton of cash, a guy who has a stolen phone will call up an Uber, and rob the driver."

He then reminded you to be sure to tip your driver. It seemed a little shady so I went through his post history and saw he posts on a few uber related subs about how to get people to tip. I had never tipped an uber before because I thought it was all about the in app payment. Went to uber's site and saw their policy on it. They do not want tipping so that the drivers dont have cash, that the app is the basis of all payments for tracking purposes, and because if cash is handled in some jurisdictions it makes it a taxi.   I just like uber and thought that user was being shady so I made this post, which got a lot more attention than his."

I just went there for the first time last night, with a group of about 40.   It's on the south end of Hamtramck, not downtown. That's a quick drive, but you'll absolutely have to drive and anybody that's never driven there before will either need GPS directions or to follow someone. It's also not a glamorous area, so if you're looking to show your guests the ""cool, clean"" side of the city, or if your guests are accustomed to being in wealthy areas and might be skittish being in a blue-collar industrial neighborhood at night, this may not be your place. If that's a concern, go check it out yourself ahead of time and see what you think. It is safe, it is just not pretty.  You can definitely have your own space- the place is a former industrial warehouse. It's huge. There's not much seating though, so your 'space' will be standing room with large tables (overturned cable spools). By the same token, you won't be a nuisance to others and the bartenders will sure as shit stop you if you are.  Given that drinking is not the primary reason they exist, they have a fantastic bar by both liquor and beer standards. Prices are quite reasonable too. I have no idea how late they're open, and like any bar, it varies based on their business. Call ahead, let them know your group size, and see if you can get a definite answer/commitment on a time; they do tons of parties and group functions, so I bet they'll accommodate you.  EDIT: You didn't mention food, but I can't not mention food. They don't have any there, but you're welcome to bring your own. There's a pizza place that delivers there called Amicci's. GET IT. I know it probably looks like any other random shitty neighborhood pizza hole, but I swear to god on high this is some of the best pizza in the metro. For novelty's sake, order your group a few of their 24"" Giant (Gigantic? Huge?) pizzas. I had never seen a pizza box that large before."

Detroit,3ck3ty,cosmiclegend,2,Wed Jul 8 16:13:31 2015 UTC,"Preach it. Finding a job can be tough. Are you in school right now? Or just out of school? Try joining a professional organization. 99% of the time they're scams, but honestly it's a really, really good way to meet people in this industry. American Marketing Association and the Public Relation Society of America are two good ones to look into joining. (Shout out because I'm a PRSA member) It can be pricey, but you get what you put into it.   Also, what are you interested in? Just digital marketing? There was a post on here a couple of weeks ago looking for a graphic designer. Brandply? Something like that."
Detroit,3ck3ty,cosmiclegend,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:21:49 2015 UTC,Yes I am actually. I have one class left in my BBA but I can't take that until Fall so I wont graduate until December :( but in the meantime I am going to do a digital marketing and social media certificate to help increase my chance of landing a job. My teacher recommended the AMA so I am saving up for that to join but I'll join both. How much is the PRSA membership?   I have never done any graphic designs but it would be cool to do if I can ever get into it. Right now I am focusing on digital marketing because I know a lot of the basics since I have my own retail website. I try to keep up on Reddit for job postings but I always seem to miss them lol the front page always sucks me in.

Detroit,3chujs,farrelly,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:35:01 2015 UTC,No problem. Make sure your communications with the landlord are in writing.  It is good to have records if you have to go to court.
Detroit,3chujs,auf_der_autobahn,3,Wed Jul 8 23:49:29 2015 UTC,"I sent a badass letter to these fuckers. Everyone feel free to read and laugh.   Dear Universit* Rental*, I am writing to document a series of incidents I have encountered regarding unlawful entry into my apartment and right to privacy violations. I am very concerned about this matter and trust that you will direct your employees to respect my privacy and adhere to Michigan law that requires that you obtain my permission before entering my apartment with reasonable notice for such things as necessary repairs.   On June 15, 2015, a maintenance man showed up unannounced at my apartment demanding entry to check a wall socket in the bedroom.  After entering, he looked around and never checked the socket. He also left his master set of keys in my apartment and had to come back again to retrieve them.  After waiting 17 days for access to my mail key to obtain my mail, I came home on June 27, 2015 to discover my postal mail had been haphazardly thrown on my table along with the key to my mailbox in my absence. Although I appreciate the effort to get the key in my possession, I did not authorize anyone to enter my apartment to do so nor did I authorize anyone to access my personal mail. I previously requested in writing via email to be notified when the key was available so that I could pick it up in person. Yesterday, July 7, 2015, I had a very troubling experience. I was locked out of my apartment around 5:10pm. Someone had entered my apartment, again, without permission and locked the top deadbolt when leaving. This person entered my apartment between 2:00pm and 5:00pm. When I signed my lease on June 10, 2015, I was only given a key to the middle lock on the door and told that I should only use this lock. I was not given a lock to the deadbolt, nor was my roommate. I was also told that all of the locks had recently been changed so I should not worry about previous tenants gaining entry.  I called the University Rentals emergency maintenance line to come and unlock the deadbolt. The maintenance man came and unlocked the top deadbolt. He could not provide an explanation as to why someone entered the apartment. He said he would attempt to make me a copy of the deadbolt key, but the key shop was closed for the day.   This maintenance man also noted that he was the one who entered my apartment without permission on Saturday, June 27th, 2015 to throw my mail and mail key on the table.   Because unlawful entry and violation of my privacy have now taken place on three separate occasions (6/15/15, 6/27/15, and 7/7/15) and I was locked out of my apartment on 7/7/15, I would like to request the following:  48 hour reasonable request for entry for such things as repairs and inspections to allow one of us to be present when possible.  Request should state who is entering, at what time, and for what reason.  Immediate notification if entry has taken place due to an emergency in my absence including who has entered, at what time, and for what reason.   If you cannot determine who entered my apartment yesterday I would like all of the locks changed and keys to all of those locks. I will then report this to the Detroit Police Department and Wayne State Police Department.   Entry into my apartment without my permission is trespassing unless there is an emergency. Preventing me from entering my apartment is also a violation of Michigan law (Act 236 of 1961). Sec. 2918 of this law states that a tenant who is locked out of their apartment is entitled to recover 3 times the amount of actual damages or $200.00, whichever is greater, in addition to recovering possession.  If any of these incidents happen again, I will be forced to contact the authorities, secure an attorney, and file for damages.  I am especially concerned about this because I have a number of minor repairs that need attention. I have alerted the maintenance about these problems and cited them in the inventory checklist as follows:  The bedroom door will not stay on the hinges. It appears the screws have been stripped and will no longer hold up the weight of the bedroom door.   The rear dining room main light will not turn on. I have changed the bulb and that did not fix the problem.   Please contact me to explain what happened yesterday and detail how this problem will be resolved and set up a time for correction of the repairs listed.   Thank you for your cooperation. Sincerely,"
Detroit,3chujs,auf_der_autobahn,4,Thu Jul 9 14:11:30 2015 UTC,What building? Who's your landlord?  Definitely do what you can to snoop/observe because that's sketchy as hell. Don't be afraid to get the cops involved...WSU police might actually be pretty willing to help.

He runs a SHITLOAD of midtown apartment buildings for college students - I can't really imagine why he would single you out to screw you over like this. I wouldn't be surprised if a previous tenant still has a key or something. Marcus market duplicated keys all the time for my friends..still. The situation is sketchy."
Detroit,3chujs,MGoAzul,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:43:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.. Like why would they pick my apartment to keep breaking into? I have all kinds of expensive electronics around. I'm just not okay with people continuing to enter my apartment without permission. If one thing goes missing, I have no proof. I actually just asked Marcus Market to make me a key and they said they didn't have the key in stock to duplicate it. Pretty shady.. considering the key says DO NOT DUPLICATE. I'm wondering how many people are entering the building who shouldn't be. I see a lot of fucking weirdos around."

Detroit,3chujs,brzcory,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:52:37 2015 UTC,Yeah that's my problem.. I don't even think the lock can be changed. It freaks me out because I have no clue who else has keys to my place. I haven't noticed anything missing... yet.

Detroit,3chujs,Brambleshire,2,Wed Jul 8 14:32:30 2015 UTC,"Replace all the locks with locks of your own. Most landlords don't like it, but at least you'd know that he was the one entering because he'd tell you.   Or that's what I'd do. They're like $10 at Home Depot, and 2 screws to replace 'em."
Detroit,3chujs,Brambleshire,2,Wed Jul 8 12:32:42 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately the lock on my door looks 50 years old. I highly doubt the landlord even changed the lock when I got the place, but it's definitely not a lock I can change myself. :-( They had a locksmith do that on purpose."
Detroit,3chujs,danielcsmith2,2,Wed Jul 8 13:17:58 2015 UTC,"Hmm. That's a conundrum them. You can put super glue in the un-used lock to prevent future lockouts, but that doesn't solve your security problem.   I'd get a chain or some sort of inside lock for when you're home, but that won't prevent your landlord (or whoever else might have a key) from getting in when you're not home.   Get renters insurance. Check for cameras. Get your own hidden camera. Sketchy landlord is sketchy."

There are also swing dances at the Masonic Temple a couple of times a year.  I've also heard a rumor that people do some swing at Bert's in Eastern Market, but I haven't been yet to check it out."

You can't even completely blame the automakers because some corporations have standards higher than local ordinances. The largest retailers will try to get as much parking on site as is physically possible.
Detroit,3cgweb,pink_meat_tickler,-1,Wed Jul 8 00:23:03 2015 UTC,actually i can't think of a city in the US that doesn't have minimum parking requirements; they're still a bad idea. i'm all for letting developers build as much parking as they want; i just don't think the government should be setting a minimum.

I think I have the smallest apt. in the lot, and my rent is at $1100 per month. This is my third year living hear. First year was $970, then $1020, and now it's up to $1100, so your rent will be going up each year as expected. But if you live on the Jos Campo side of the apartments, the clubs across the street really suck and get loud. Especially on bike nights and weekends. Aside from that it's really quiet, and you get a great view of the Ren Cen and surrounding city. Neighbors are quiet, they allow dogs, and it's in a pretty crime free area. Although I did see a brand new cadillac escalade sitting on cinder blocks one morning, but that's all I've seen. (Don't park on the street, there is a parking garage for a reason.)"

But it definitely on the higher price end. 1.5  to 2.5 dollars per square foot depending on apartment. Even being at the top of the market, you definitely get what you pay for though. Great staff, responsive maintenence, access to hotel amenities which is the first 10 floors. Valet parking and normal parking under grand circus Park is convenient. Best location for being downtown. Next to Comerica and walking distance to downtown food/bars. Would reccomend atleast checking out a place if you have time."
Detroit,3cgaz4,MichaelDelaney,3,Wed Jul 8 00:11:26 2015 UTC,Renaissance City Apartments is a total shit show and went super down hill after Village Green bought it out and renamed it from Millender Center. My parents have a 2 bedroom 2 bath and my brother also has a 1 BR there. I think my parents are looking to move after their lease is up.    The one thing it still has going for it is that it's one of the only fully handicap accessible apt buildings downtown and my brother has MD.

Detroit,3cgaz4,joosebox,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:30:11 2015 UTC,"Here's a quick example.   I moved my brother in 2 weeks ago and thus needed access to the loading dock since they don't want you to move people in through the front lobby. Let them know 72 hours in advance and it turns out that the main loading dock door had been broken for days and the only one working had a giant dumpster in the way which means you can't drive your car up to the dock and that you have to carry everything through a 4 foot gap filled with paint cans and construction crap.   The dock is 4 feet high and they don't want you to use the lift. Nobody came to run it (When I moved my parents in 3 years ago they had someone meet us at the dock to get the door open and another person to help and run the lift. Very nice helpful folks).   So after all that we had one more trip to make for a tv and some odds and ends. Like well fuck this, this shit is coming through the lobby. If you let us use two carts we can do it all in one trip in like five minutes. To which was met with long sighing explanations that it's ""standard practice to only allow one cart per person"" before finally being acquired.    Like well motherfucker it's standard practice to not have people wondering through the loading dock of a 30 story building by themselves, not let them use the lift to the dock while moving and then give them shit about using an extra trolly because your dock is fucked up.   sorry for language, I got more and more annoyed while typing this out."

It's a great apartment/area, aside from being right across from one of the most goddamn loud bars in the neighborhood.

One guy came outside at 3AM to get my car out of the snow. I really miss how awesome everyone was there. Great place, great neighbors."

First the good-  I actually really really like my  apartment, it's really nice, can't beat the location- especially since I work in the RenCen. You get to to use the Marriott Gym, which is a pretty legit gym and no one is ever there.    The management at this building is TERRIBLE. They don't have their shit together at all. They are completely unorganized. Any ""events"" they advertise usually don't even happen, and the concierge often won't even know why. It's a total joke.  I don't (currently) regret living here, and plan to renew my lease as of now. But management is just incredibly irritating to deal with and totally incompetent.

Detroit,3carlg,ecib,2,Mon Jul 6 14:29:33 2015 UTC,Not sure what you're suggesting. The Detroit News is the one who made the claim that Quicken Loans specifically had the 5th highest number of mortgages end in foreclosure within the city limits in the last decade. That that number was less than 1% isn't a sensational counter-claim. It's a simple fact of the Detroit New's claim.
Detroit,3carlg,delurhparg,7,Mon Jul 6 15:57:00 2015 UTC,"I'm suggesting that the use of the phrase ""by Quicken Loans"" is intended to make it look like Quicken's track record with mortgages in the city is better than it actually is. The Detroit News statistic is not incorrect.  Quicken originates a lot of these mortgages and then sells them off to investors; when the mortgage went bad, it was the investors who foreclosed, not Quicken. So by using 'by Quicken Loans' in that sentence, they are massively dropping the numerator in the Detroit News' statistic by eliminating loans originated by Quicken but which were sold to other investors; e.g. the vast majority of Quicken-originated mortgages in the city.  From the city's perspective, they don't care about who actually forecloses on the property, be it Quicken or some other entity. That doesn't mean that there weren't severe underwriting problems with a lot of mortgages Quicken originated.  tl;dr: anyone can lie with words and statistics, so carefully parse what you're reading"

That is either a factual statement or it is not a factual statement. I think the problem is that you're trying to make an argument that the article didn't make. Again, the Detroit news made a specific claim. It sucks their reporting is so lousy and they apparently could have made a possibly more pertinent point had they put in a minimum of effort, but they didn't. Maybe because if they tried to make an cogent argument they'd have to do some actual research like parse out the number of loans purchased from Quicken that ended up defaulting (which possibly changed hands multiple times). From all the reporting around the time of the meltdown, that kind of analysis is particularly challenging. The paper would also have to contend with the fact that Quicken also has a good reputation when it comes to sub-prime bundling abuses."
Detroit,3carlg,delurhparg,5,Mon Jul 6 18:17:57 2015 UTC,"It is a factual statement. Quicken's rebuttal is designed to exclude the vast majority of the loans it made pre-2011 and produce a very small percentage. Why should the loans that Quicken originated but didn't service be ignored?  Hint: Nothing in Quicken's rebuttal contradicts this claim:   His company, Detroit-based Quicken Loans, meanwhile, had the fifth-highest number of mortgages that ended in foreclosure in Detroit over the last decade.   I am not 'making an argument that the article didn't make'. Just saying that Quicken's rebuttal here is a completely different statistic that doesn't invalidate the DetNews claim. If the DetNews was wrong, I'm sure Quicken would have said so and produced the data to back it up. But they're not, so they are trying to draw attention to a different metric that makes them look good."

Detroit,3carlg,Banzai51,3,Tue Jul 7 13:00:03 2015 UTC,"Quicken Loans generally doesn't hold on to many of the loans they originate. They instead sell them off to other lenders.

Detroit,3carlg,ecib,2,Mon Jul 6 17:02:36 2015 UTC,"Which could matter, but the Detroit News article suggested nothing of the sort."
Detroit,3carlg,sbamkmfdmdfmk,2,Mon Jul 6 18:01:14 2015 UTC,"QL has retained servicing on almost all of the loans it originates since ~mid-2011 but you're correct that most of the older loans mentioned in the article would've been foreclosed by other servicers who QL sold the servicing to. Nonetheless, the rate of foreclosure on those QL-originated loans was far lower than other lenders' Detroit properties."
Detroit,3carlg,Banzai51,3,Mon Jul 6 18:02:37 2015 UTC,Keep in mind Quicken Loans sells the majority of their loans as quick as they can. The counter may not be the full story either.
Detroit,3carlg,sbamkmfdmdfmk,4,Mon Jul 6 16:59:32 2015 UTC,"The way the mortgage industry's secondary market is set up today, just about every lender sells almost all of their loans to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac for conventional loans, or Ginnie Mae for FHA/VA insured loans. Those investors are the ones who provide the funding for the loans and all lenders have to follow those investors' underwriting guidelines. After the loan is written, companies can either service the loans themselves and keep a small portion of the interest as a servicing fee (the rest of the interest goes back to the investor) or sell the servicing rights. The servicer is the one who collects the payments and, in the event of default, goes through the foreclosure process. A lot of lenders don't have the capacity to hold and service the loans they write, so they sell the servicing to other shops. Many of the other big lenders still sell the servicing. Quicken Loans has retained the servicing rights to almost all of its originated loans in the last ~4 years (before then, QL/Rock Financial used to sell the mortgage servicing to other companies)."

Detroit,3carlg,gpforlife,2,Mon Jul 6 23:44:42 2015 UTC,"It's also kind of meaningless because it doesn't take into account how many mortgages the company sold over the period.

Detroit,3carlg,goulson,2,Tue Jul 7 01:52:52 2015 UTC,"it would kind of follow that they had the fifth-highest default rate, if you assume defaults were equally distributed.   I don't think that's true. The default rate would, all else being equal, remain the same across all lenders.

Detroit,3carlg,gpforlife,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:56:55 2015 UTC,"You're right. I should have said ""that it follow that they would have fifth-highest number of defaults"" like the way they did in Det News."
Detroit,3carlg,sbamkmfdmdfmk,2,Tue Jul 7 17:43:55 2015 UTC,"Actually no, my comment doesn't refute that claim. The fact that they're traded around doesn't necessarily have bearing on the likelihood of foreclosure. What does refute the claim though is what /u/gpforlife states: that it's not taking into account how many mortgages QL wrote. If they had the fifth-highest in foreclosure but were the twentieth in total volume, that'd be a HUGE problem. If they were the fifth-highest in foreclosure with the highest volume, they're actually doing well. So for DetNews to throw out the fifth-highest stat without context is irresponsible."
Detroit,3carlg,gpforlife,2,Tue Jul 7 02:24:43 2015 UTC,"Especially since, I think it's very possible that Quicken was the fifth-largest producer in the time frame in question. Especially, if you're just looking at the metro area, too. It's a very real possibility that Quicken has a lower default rate than the average originator."
Detroit,3carlg,sbamkmfdmdfmk,2,Tue Jul 7 02:53:40 2015 UTC,I do know that QL has a MUCH lower default rate than the industry average for loans that it services (i.e. 2011 and later). I don't have data in front of me but I'd guess it's the same for older loans where it sold servicing too.

Wow! Miguel needs to learn a thing or two from Mr. Romine it appears. But as any good Tigers fan can surmise – while both are great players, this is a terrible abuse of numbers. Miguel Cabrera batted 611 times while Andrew Romine only batted 251 times. Cabrera’s 117 strike outs means he strikes out 19% of the time he comes to the plate.

It is alright, a bit messy though. Weights are left unracked a lot of the time. Typically only one staff member manning the front so they can't be cleaning up after everyone.   They have a wide variety of cardio and weight machines as well as free weights. Two squat racks, which is what I was mainly there for. But the racks are really too close together, should be another foot or two apart. It is a bit of a safety issue imo.   It can get really busy in the evening on weekdays between 5-8, in the free weight section. But there were a couple Sunday afternoons and Friday evenings I almost had the place to myself.   I went to Powerhouse because it was $10 a month w/ the Groupon. I doubt I would pay their regular rate ( not sure what it is) based on the crowds and the way the squat racks are set up. If you don't use free weights then those two things most likely won't be an issue.   Hope that helps."

Detroit,3bw7ws,JF42,8,Fri Jul 3 00:30:18 2015 UTC,"From the Secretary of State's FAQ: New Michigan residents must title and register their vehicles immediately.  There is no grace period provided in Michigan law.  The Michigan Vehicle Code defines ""resident"" as ""every person who resides in this state and establishes that he or she is legally present in the United States.""  New residents need to visit a Secretary of State branch office to apply for a Michigan driver's license (or state ID card), vehicle title, and registration as soon as they establish residency in this state.  Found some info on registering your vehicle here."
Detroit,3bw7ws,jChuck,2,Thu Jul 2 18:22:16 2015 UTC,"This is true. You need to get Michigan insurance immediately.   In fact, if you drive in Michigan for 30 days in a calendar year and do not even live in the state, you need to get Michigan insurance."
Detroit,3bw7ws,MuffySpelunki,4,Thu Jul 2 19:00:36 2015 UTC,"Michigan Auto Insurance coverage will cover any and all medical expenses from a car accident for the rest of your life. That's part of the reason it's more expensive than other states (and there's an additional premium for living in or near the City of Detroit that exists for a whole host of other reasons, many of them bullshit, but that's a different story).  My point is that if you can afford Michigan insurance, you should get it, not only because it makes you ""legal"" but also because it actually does cover more than other States' insurance."
Detroit,3bw7ws,Khorasaurus,3,Thu Jul 2 18:30:12 2015 UTC,"The fact that you've read conflicting information is not surprising in the least. Michigan insurance law is convoluted and labyrinthian, and Michigan government websites are universally useless and unnavigable. I was in a similar position 18 months ago, so I researched the shit out of this for months and came away with not much more information than I started with.  The process- get insurance in MI, then register in MI, then get MI plates. This is the process no matter what state you move to.  You can get a Michigan license regardless of where your car is registered and insured; permission to drive has nothing to do with what you are driving. I had my out-of-state license for nearly two years before I lost it and decided to replace it with a Michigan enhanced license. (Passport-free border crossing FTW.) Though it's a bit of a toss-up, I guess I advocate getting your license as soon as you have a permanent address, as that may be the biggest sticking point if you ever get pulled over for a traffic violation. (That was the case with me on multiple occasions.)  You'll get as many opinions on insurance as there are people, but my opinion is this: if you comfortably afford MI insurance, get it. Yes, it's off-putting to pay so much, but if you're earning enough money that getting MI insurance won't otherwise alter your standard of living, then it's absolutely the best way to go.   If you're not earning enough money to have that kind of leeway (like most folks in this state), my opinion is this if you are an excellent driver and unlikely to file a claim: if you have any way of making a semi-plausible argument as to why your car is still insured in Ohio, maintain that as long as you can. (Is someone living in Ohio also on the car's title? If not, could you get them added?) Michigan's auto insurance system is astonishingly fucked, and paying the additional cost just so you can pat yourself on the back for being completely legit only seems worth it if the increase in cost isn't much. I don't know your numbers, but I'm better the increase will not be small. If it is, get legal. This all goes out the window if you have a track record of filing claims or think there's a less-than-slight chance you'll need to do so here. Having your insurance company tell you to fuck off and drop you when you need coverage the most probably isn't worth some savings in the short term. Getting accused of insurance fraud would be worse.  It's a tough call that depends heavily on your individual situation."

While I can believe that some of that is actually true, claiming that not a single person involved in either of those organizations has any experience with or connection to medical marijuana in this state is a pretty gigantic accusation (the implication, of course, being that your entire movement is highly educated and experienced); I would certainly like to see some sort of evidence that can back up your claims. No, I don't want people who are not scientifically and realistically familiar with marijuana use and uses to dictate how people access and use it, but I'm also not going to believe claims that they don't unless I see something that proves or implies as much.

You are certainly correct in your assessment; I forgot that the inside information that I'm privy to, and of course, cannot verify, isn't common knowledge; something that's very easy to forget that when you're so deep in it!  And I stand corrected; the MRC has championed Tim Beck, whom I know personally, and believe to be a great guy that has chosen the side he believes is most likely to win, because he just wants it legalized, at any cost.  He absolutely understands marijuana, and serves as their advisor; he also says our ballot language is superior, and hopes that we'll win, although he doesn't believe we will.  I stand to differ; we have support coming out of the woodwork, I'm absolutely blown away by the grassroots support we've found; this thread alone had yielded ~5-10 volunteers, and a single facebook post I made on my personal page yielded nearly two dozen more!  We really can succeed; people are sick of the bullshit, and are itching to rally behind a good cause.  We can absolutely do this, and we're the group that's decided to do it right.  Patients first, small business friendly, we support home grows of 12 plants, and we clarify every single issue with the MMMA so that the cops and prosecutors can't purposefully misinterpret it to ruin lives.  We cover pediatric medical MJ use, recreational, and even hemp... we really did everything we could to help every population, and listened to every voice that wanted to be heard when we wrote this.  While I'll admit, there are a few concessions (the 10% tax being one; I oppose it because fuck the government, but realize that it also benefits us by capping it at 10% so they can't drive everyone out of business by taxing it to death like Washington did), we are, hands down, the best group to ever attempt this.  I do stand by the statement that every single person on our 13 member board is someone who is highly educated, and either has some skin in the game (personal malaise, sick children, dispensary owners, or 8 felony charges like myself) or is an activist that always does what's right, no matter the cost.  May of our board members support legalization, despite it being terribly damaging to their careers as marijuana defense attorneys... they know right from wrong, and don't care if they make substantially less money if it's legalized.  There is no one that I'm aware of in the MCC that has any skin in the game, nor marijuana knowledge... the fact that they're interested is completely baffling, and the only explanation I can come up with is that they're merely a distraction funded by the MRC to take away our momentum.  They submitted their language first (and in a vacuum, I'd vote for it... 8 felony charges, ya know, it'd help my case to legalize it), but have yet to disclose any financial reports, and aren't actively collecting signatures, which lends itself to my estimation that they have no intention of succeeding.  I'll bet ya $5 they never make the ballot.  They've also failed to disclose any of their investors, board members, or, I believe, anyone's name except Matt Marsden's, unlike MI Legalize.  We stand naked as day, with full public disclosure of our motivations, our board members, and our financials... we have nothing to hide, and everything to gain.  We don't play political games, we're just doing what's right for everyone in the movement, and many of our board members stand to lose money from legalization (lawyers), are in no financial position to ever go into the marijuana industry, or are simply sick themselves, and want the cops out of their hair, of have sick children and full time jobs, and cannot possibly be expected to grow their own for them on top of everything else.

Detroit,3bqxyc,Khorasaurus,2,Wed Jul 1 20:11:22 2015 UTC,"I do like your ""right guy"" interpretation, although I find it wrong to legalize only to create an oligopoly to get rich off of... the MRC is doing the right thing, albeit for the wrong reasons, and in the wrong way.  The American dream is to have an equal playing field, so that everyone has an opportunity to succeed in business/life/etc; MI Legalize supports that, while the MRC does not.  I summed up what our proposal has pretty darned well in my initial post, I urge you to re-read it, rather than me retyping it.  For some additional clarity, the MRC is still working on their language, and haven't submitted anything yet.  I'm privy to some inside channels, which I can't prove, nor would they admit to saying anything, but from the sounds of it, their model will closely mimic the model MI uses for alcohol- only a select few are allowed to create the product, then it goes to regulated, controlled distributors, and on to dispensaries open to the general public.  Each level creates a bureaucracy around it, and like any bureaucracy, it will likely be staffed by the investors' friends, and those with political connections.  Dispensaries will probably be able to apply for ""weed licenses,"" like liquor licenses, and I presume they would be similarly out of the price range for most people to get into the industry (our initiative caps it at $5000 with a $500 annual renewal fee).  This is actually a decent proposal, and one I would absolutely vote for, were there not a better one on the ballot.  Once again, I believe this country has been ruined by cronyism and the ultra-wealthy maintaining control of everything, including opportunity, which I oppose, but there's no question I'd rather have the MRC's model than the current police state, lock people up for something that should never have been legal model we have currently.  The reason I mentioned the MCC'S mascot is to draw attention to how illegitimate they are; they can't even pander to the stereotypical crowd they think they're appealing to.  The result of their initiative, which I don't even think will be on the ballot, as they're not petitioning, and don't seem to have the money to pay professionals to do it for them, is very similar to that of the MRC.  MI Legalize is the best petition to protect medical use, pediatric use, legalize hemp production and manufacture of products using it, and allows most people to have the chance to be part of what will be an enormous industry.    The MRC's model will mimic how alcohol is regulated, and isn't the worst, but will likely screw over pediatric medical use, and creates an oligopoly, which indirectly screws the common man by limiting his economic opportunities.  The MCC isn't serious, and should be disregarded.  TL;DR;  Sign MI Legalize's petition no matter what.  If they don't get on the ballot, sign both the MRC's and the MCC's petitions.  When it comes time to vote, if you want it legalized, vote for all of them; if you want to risk it not being legal to play favorites, vote for your favorite.  I believe MI Legalize and MRC will both pass if on the ballot, so I will be voting for MI Legalize, as the one with the most votes wins in a tie."

Detroit,3bqxyc,PattyOLantern,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:44:14 2015 UTC,"Correct.  My strategy is to only sign MI Legalize's petitions (the MRC WILL be on the ballot; they can pay for those signatures, and don't need any help), and vote for MI Legalize on the ballot, because IMO, MI Legalize and the MRC's initiatives will both pass, so you need to play favorites at that point.  If MI Legalize fails to get on the ballot, or in an alternate world where the MRC was the only option, i'd happily vote for the MRC's initiative.  Edit:  Full disclosure; if you don't care about medical patients very much, or pediatrics, or hemp products, and don't have any interest in participating in the industry for financial gain, then you should sign every ballot initiative, and vote for them all come election time.  All you want is legalization, and this plan will help you achieve that goal without risking anything.  I'll still thank you for your vote, as it helps me personally, but I guarantee SOMEONE is going to win, and I think the best plan for everyone is to support MI Legalize over the others!"
Detroit,3bqxyc,PattyOLantern,7,Fri Jul 3 01:49:52 2015 UTC,"(cross post question from r/michigents)  I admire your efforts but take issue with your position on taxation and packaging.  In fact I struggle to see how these requirements would at all favor a small or local business and believe legislation like this to create a legacy of unintended consequences in the future.  I see this as a particular challenge with the packaging requirements as this type of stipulation could provide the foundation for big businesses to exploit the verbiage and eventually use it as a barrier to entry in the market.  That said, you do appear to be organized. There is a strong chance you may earn my vote. And I would agree that the MCC is most likely a distraction aimed at further dividing voters.   My question would be this, if Cannabis is eventually legalized at the federal level, would we still be under the constraints set forth by the state legislation we enact now?  Also, would you consider making a provision to reduce the tax rate on Michigan based production? Facing the reality that it will be legalized at the federal level and our local businesses will face competition from outside the state (potentially even the country) from regions where they may hold a tax advantage?"
Detroit,3bqxyc,ornryactor,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:05:57 2015 UTC,"Well, technically, the 10th amendment to the constitution gives the states the power to tell the feds to fuck off on almost any thing they want; a power that is rarely used, but has seen some powerful resurgence lately.  Check out The Tenth Amendment Center for more information about the surprising number of victories the states have had vs the feds via nullification lately!  The answer to your second question is also answered by the 10th amendment... just look at NYC.  Their cigarettes are ~$10/pack, while I believe they're something like $2 a pack in the states that grow tobacco.  Yes, there is a black market that is created by the import of illicit goods to take advantage of different tax rates, but doing so is a federal crime, and when caught, the penalties are absurd.  That said, people in MI like produce, beer, wine, you name it that's grown locally, and prefer it, at least in my humble opinion, and they're willing to pay more money for higher quality goods... Whole Foods being a prime example.  There's no reason MI can't compete, we honestly have some of the best weed in the nation, and have traditionally been an agrarian state.  I don't believe there's a significant threat from nationwide distributors, although I'll readily admit this isn't something I had considered before!"
Detroit,3bqxyc,PattyOLantern,12,Fri Jul 3 01:01:44 2015 UTC,I don't think 'free market' means what you seem to think it means.
Detroit,3bqxyc,ornryactor,8,Wed Jul 1 13:48:23 2015 UTC,"The OP, apparently. Claims that he's for a free market system, but then trashed an opponent for approaching the topic from a free market standpoint.  You seem to be against a free market system as well. Why? Are consumers in this country not able to be trusted to make the right choices? What would you prefer the U.S. switch to?"
Detroit,3bqxyc,Flintoid,3,Wed Jul 1 14:36:00 2015 UTC,"I understand why you're saying what you are, but a free market is most often better for the people because it's built on competition, private property, and voting for your preferred products with your dollars. The other end of the spectrum is a command economy where the government controls it all. Ours is a mix of the two, leaning way over to the free market side, but the further you get from that true free market economy, the less choices you will have as a consumer.  To sum this up and end it, since it's a discussion that stemmed from the OP misusing the term, a free market is every group/firm/company competing openly and the consumers choosing what they prefer. OP seemed to believe it's the right for his ""side"" to ""win"" because they're genuine, and the other guys aren't. It seems like just one more error in judgment on behalf of the OP, which will drive people away from the cause entirely. It's especially frustrating because I wish that the legalization effort could be more focused on the big picture instead of this type of in-fighting and attempting to cement their own seat at the table, because it doesn't help anyone, and the much-needed tax revenue from legalization doesn't get where it needs to go."

Detroit,3bqxyc,Khorasaurus,5,Wed Jul 1 17:16:46 2015 UTC,"Cronies? Do you actually know what that word means either, or are you just trying to throw out words that you think make the most negative implications possible to get people riled up?  A crony is a close friend. Nothing more. You are only hurting your cause by trying to do this with sensationalist crap. Be honest, informative, and responsible with the claims you make.  Personally, I want to see this legalized at the federal level as soon as possible. But since I don't see that happening anytime soon, I'd like to see Michigan to get out in front of this, legalize it over a certain age (21 is a nice round number), regulate it, and tax it. It needs to happen, and I don't know any state  that couldn't use the funds. I just hate that the industry can't use banks, because of the risks associated with having that much cash laying around."
Detroit,3bqxyc,themast,3,Wed Jul 1 16:58:35 2015 UTC,"A crony is a close friend.   True, but the term also implies someone who is subservient to the person who got them into that position, and will unquestioningly serve the interests of that person even if that means directly undermining the interests of somebody else. So perhaps it wasn't an incorrect term for OP to use, even if his/her argument overall is off-base. Snyder currently has 'cronies' running a number of state agencies and operations that place the interests and well-being of the GOP establishment above those of the Michiganders their respective institutions are supposed to be serving. I could certainly see that happening with marijuana control, were it to be fully legalized in a restrictive manner."

Downtown, Detroit Beer Company is located a couple blocks from Comerica Park, so you may want to make a stop in before or after the game.  There are also two new breweries in Corktown (Batch and Brew Detroit). Batch is a nano-brewery and for me, is the best beer in the city.  Atwater is the final (and largest) brewery in the city.

If this gave her ptsd she needs to consider working in a library or becoming a hermit. In 6 lifetimes she never would have made this much money. But because it was a little stressful that warrants demanding such an absurd amount? Why not just be reasonable and ask for an amount that covers therapy, bills, and lost wages? Why try to bankrupt an organization that can't really afford to take that kind of hit?"
Detroit,3bqj5t,TheDirtyWeatherMan,3,Wed Jul 1 11:27:14 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: The woman suing here is doing so because this incident has likely destroyed any chance she has at a decent career going forward and to send a message to the EAA leadership that the way they treat their teachers and students is unacceptable.  I'll be blunt and say what I'm guessing some people won't:  This teacher used to work for the EAA, which is the monstrosity that Gov. Snyder designed to take over the worst-of-the-worst in the Detroit Public Schools. The school she was working for was Pershing HS.   The EAA is a tremendously corrupt organization and has been since its inception. The two people Snyder hired to oversee the majority of the district's policies and practices, John Covington and Mary Esselman, were both hired from the St Louis (MO) Public Schools to implement a plan in Detroit similar to what they had established there.  Put simply, this plan worked out so well that the SLPS school district lost its accreditation shortly after Covington and Esselman were brought into Michigan.  I worked for this horrifying experiment for 7 months before handing in my resignation because I could not, in good faith, continue to work for a school system that places so little value in its teachers and students. The district tries to vacuum up students simply to increase revenues to the district (which gets funneled to the top, as is evidenced by the salary of the new Chancellor of the district [link]), teachers are hired fresh out of college or from Teach for America programs with little to no support, and students who pose disciplinary problems are routinely swept under the rug and not actually dealt with in a constructive or helpful manner. Facilities issues are not dealt with at all unless it's immediately life-threatening or something that could immediately generate a lawsuit, and teachers are forced into dealing with horrifically high numbers of students in a classroom at once (the Phys-ed teacher at the school I worked at routinely had more than 50 in her gym at once and I routinely had 40-ish).  The situation this woman went through is a no-win situation. Her choices amounted to: Allow the students involved in the fight to continue until security arrives (which could take 5-10 minutes, assuming the guard isn't distracted along the way); or intervene, risking injury in the process but potentially mitigating it for the students. The video of the fight shows her attempting to intervene with students who are physically much larger than she, and she is physically unable to separate them, so she reacts in the only way she can see: involve an implement of some kind to even the playing field.   The fact that the video got out, made it to YouTube, and has her name associated with it has likely permanently tanked any hope she ever had of getting another teaching job. It also has a high chance of trashing any hope she has of finding work that isn't minimum wage.   She's aiming for the stars here both to keep herself afloat and to send a message to those in power that their practices are morally bankrupt at best and criminal at worst, and she aims to make them pay for putting her in a situation with such disturbingly poor support."
Detroit,3bqj5t,bluejazzer,6,Wed Jul 1 22:31:41 2015 UTC,Why try to bankrupt an organization that can't really afford to take that kind of hit?   I am guessing you already know the answer to this.

Detroit,3br69h,delurhparg,3,Wed Jul 1 14:56:26 2015 UTC,"this article takes things to an extreme. to say that QL was instrumental in increase of foreclosures is a misnomer. It requires a bit more analysis than the DN actually did, but if the actuarial analysis was right at the time, should the economy have not collapsed these houses would not have blighted to the extent they have.   it's likely tax assessments also were a major contributor to this issue. Looking at the DLB and current outstanding property taxes around the city right now, that can't be ignored either.   To say that people were pressured into signing mortgages or a refi, like what Bernard Parker is alluding to is simply a cop-out. rather than taking ownership over the fact they made their own studpid personal financial decisions they desire to blame someone else. It's like with a credit card, just because you were approved for 20k credit limit, doesn't mean you should complain to the CC company when it takes you 35 years to pay it back at minimum payments. These people should have looked closely at what their income was, what their bills were, and where they desired to live. If they couldn't afford a house, they should have rented."
Detroit,3br69h,delurhparg,3,Wed Jul 1 15:04:56 2015 UTC,Why shouldn't the lender and the borrower share the blame equally? It's just as much the lender's fault for making a bad loan as the borrower for taking it out.
Detroit,3br69h,decibles,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:09:36 2015 UTC,"that assumes the loan was bad. If the information provided by the borrower meets the criteria required (by the government and by risk management) and then it passes a ""common sense"" test by both the underwriter and originator there is no reason not to lend to these individuals. Had the contrary been true, not lending to them at all, i'm sure there would be claims of racial/economic discrimination. Sometimes it's just bad luck - the economy tanked, values dropped, income fell - there is no way around that. maybe foreclosure was not the best solution and working with the homeowner was better, but if the tax foreclosure was bound to happen as well it's a catch-22.  On the other hand, if the borrower was not being truthful to the lender, or to themselves, or failed to educate themselves about the risks of the lending process, variable rate mortgages, etc., then the borrow is more to blame than the lender."
Detroit,3br69h,aCreditGuru,4,Wed Jul 1 15:19:51 2015 UTC,"A lot of this will shake out in the upcoming Quicken-specific lawsuits by DOJ, but the actions of the entire mortgage industry in the run-up to 2008/9 are pretty damning and it seems that Quicken was no different. They knew a lot of loans were bad or borrowers wouldn't be able to make payments, and that they weren't going to take the hit, so why not get the profit and socialize the losses?"

It sucks the city is losing a theater, but the city also deserves a better, more modern theater anyway. The Jurassic World print was film (when everyone is going with digital projection), cigarette marks very prominent, and the sound cut out near the end until the big fight, then clicked back in. Hopefully someone announces a new theater somewhere residents can access easily and enjoy a film on a decent screen less than a quarter mile from their seats."

If the inside can be revamped, a nice higher end theater would be a better solution - something similar to: http://www.silverspot.net/Ticketing/naples.aspx  - big leather seats, reserved seating, etc. it would cater to the growing urban population and be a destination for those in the nearby suburbs (points, GI, etc.). Priced smartly it could be a good move, the one above is averages about 15/ticket.   I digress, but a fight broke out on E. Jefferson between a group of high school kids. i called the cops and they booked it when the cops showed up about 1 min later."
Detroit,3br694,TheMeatloafMom,3,Wed Jul 1 14:14:56 2015 UTC,"Here's the official website: http://www.districtdetroit.com/  Construction has started (they've dug a HUGE hole so far), and they're probably going to tear down the Park Avenue Hotel (the last building standing in the arena footprint) within the next couple weeks.   The new arena looks AWESOME and is going to be enclosed within office, residential, and retail buildings, so it won't be a dead zone when no games are going on, but there are concerns that the Ilitches' promises of a lot of other development surrounding the arena won't come to fruition, and instead there will be giant parking lots carved out of the neighborhood, like what happened west of the Fox Theater for Tigers parking. We'll see - they have announced some other development projects (including a new HQ for Little Caesars), but most of that is closer to Comerica than the new arena.   As for Joe Louis, it was given away to one of the creditors during the bankruptcy, so when the new arena opens it will be torn down, and the bank that owns the land will either redevelop it or sell it to someone else. I'm optimistic something cool will be built there, since it's on the river, is right next to Cobo, and has its own People Mover station. A hotel is probably likely."

Must not have to much experience with advertising your brand judging by those words. This site is clean and minimalist and accomplishes exactly what it's supposed to.  To begin, EVERYTHING has large images now so you better get used to it because it's not going anywhere. The website also has all the information it needs - and those blurbs make it easier to scan without having to read a big block of text. As for the fact you said it has no information, let me just run right through that for ya.   You get the name of the place... Offworld.   Tells you WHO they are   Offworld is a classic arcade in Detroit, MI that moonlights as a gallery and a community workspace for people who love electronic gaming.   Tells you WHAT it is.   Our interim location is St. Vincent Corktown. The address is 2020 14th St. Detroit, MI. This space serves as a staging area and workshop for the games and is available for private events. We are also hosting a monthly evening of classic gaming at the super awesome Checker Bar in Cadillac Square.   Tells you WHERE it is   Please join us for the next Offworld @ Checker. Saturday July 18th   Tells you WHEN it is   Offworld is an arcade, not a museum. Our games are a little rough around the edges. We want people to play them, yell at them and use the kickplates once in a while.   Tells you WHY you will like it.  Case closed."

Just because a design style is popular doesn't mean it is good, let alone functional. And to say my opinion is awful goes to show that your experience ""advertising with your brand"" is questionable at best. To call that website minimalist shows me that your opinion is invalid. Let's look at this again.  Logotype.

You are so stupid, you believe your know your shit, but everyone else knows you're a fucking moron. I said your opinion is awful because it is. You can type out as much stupidity from your brain as you want, but it won't change the fact you know nothing. You are a mess... and the fact you can't follow it suggests you should probably seek some sort of reading comprehension classes.   I'll break it down even more for you because I'm home sick from work and have nothing better to do today. But after this, I'm going to play some video games and watch TV, so no more dumb-ass responses, ok son?  Logotype. Logo (Who we are)    Order our t shirt This is known as a call-to-action. It's always above the fold.   Here's what we are I crossed it out, but you got one right!!    Order out t shirt again Here's A bunch of information about a t shirt Picture of call to action item and details/order form how to order it.   Random picture I think you meant section separator. Image is a poster of the Metroid guy inside their location. Next block of copy just happens to be where they are located. If this is what you think a ""random image"" is, then I assume every image on the internet to you is random.  Actual information Everything is actual information. This happens to be ""Where we are located""    Random date with an unknown abbreviation False. Not random at all. The fact you think it is shows your stupidity. This is the date of their next event for Offworld @ Checker (FYI: offworld is the name of the company and checker (bar) is the location they are currently at downtown - since you probably didn't read). The unknown abbreviation is pretty fucking simple if you have been laying off the crack pipe most of your life. FB stands for facebook. It's a pretty popular social site that allows you to network with friends, upload photos, and even create events where people can RSVP. RSVP is a term that means whether or not they will be attending or not attending. It's of French origin and stands for Répondez s'il vous plaît, but since you don't know English, I don't expect you to know French, so i'll let you know that it means ""Reply if you please"" or ""Please reply."" If you click it... holy fuck, it takes you to an event page on facebook where you can RSVP - oh the humanity!!!  A shit ton of random images that depict games, yet they don't tell you which ones First, if you don't know what the games are, this place probably isn't for you. I knew what most of them were just by seeing the pictures. It seems you are a child who never played these games growing up, which is okay, but don't blame them because you never played them. Second, and most importantly, they do tell you which ones. They have the name of the game, when it was released and even allow you to view more info - so again FUCKING READ FIRST before you bash on something you don't understand.  Message form Yay you got one again!  Logo OMG, 2 in a row! That's a new HIGH SCORE for you!  Case closed yet again. Later dude... don't get a job in advertising, marketing, UI/UX design, or even front-end. Just take my order and bring me my big mac and fries - and don't fuck it up!"

Detroit,3brvg5,MGoAzul,8,Wed Jul 1 17:23:01 2015 UTC,Because 1/3 to 1/2 of the city (depending on who you look at and who you ask) already lives in poverty
Detroit,3brvg5,auf_der_autobahn,-2,Wed Jul 1 17:28:25 2015 UTC,"Assuming they spent on average $10/day, every day, that's only $36.5 if it's a 1% tax. To increase services, seems worth the cost. State sales tax doesn't affect their ability to get food or water, neither would this. It would impact their ability to buy wants, not needs. I don't see much of an argument to be had by your statement."
Detroit,3brvg5,auf_der_autobahn,6,Wed Jul 1 17:34:21 2015 UTC,"I'm going to back away and let other commenters handle this before it gets too testy, but just a couple of things before I go:   ""Wants"" and ""needs"" is unfortunately more of a tv-static gray area than a clear demarcation. While it's true that you can buy food without paying sales tax, you can't buy cleaning products, toiletries, home goods, clothes, or basically anything that maintains or improves quality of life without getting hit by tax. Sales taxes are generally praised because they're indiscriminate, but they're actually not very fair. A poor person needs the extra dollar(s) more than a not-poor person, but both people have an equal right to buy what they want and need. Generally not a good sign when a large but ill-defined group is referred to as ""them"" or ""they"" or ""their."" I know it probably wasn't your intention to mean something by doing this, but I'd encourage you to find a way to use more inclusive language, especially when discussing something as charged up by gross insensitivities as poverty and economics in Detroit. Related, but somewhat harder to put a finger on: you might be surprised how much a dollar means to someone who doesn't have many. Obviously I don't know anything about your life or your interest/success in empathizing based on a few sentences, but I also haven't met too many people who are in or very close to Detroit poverty who wouldn't have a damned good argument for why an increased sales tax is potentially damaging or even crippling."
Detroit,3brvg5,delurhparg,0,Wed Jul 1 17:48:37 2015 UTC,"okay, poor pronoun-antecedent agreement, fair enough, but i digress.   I've lived on both sides of the coin so i do know the difference - growing up worse off and living better now. in my opinion, it's marginal at best when the true cost is factored in. Frankly, it's an element of budgeting - taking a practical and smart approach to spending. It means buying the needs and necessities, most of which are tax free such as rent, and non-prepared food, the rest of which is already taxed at a state tax rate and a 1-2% addition would not factor in too much on a yearly basis. Also, the increased benefit of better services could outweigh - such as lower renters/car/home insurance rates, lower food costs, lower utility costs, etc."

Detroit,3brvg5,jbisinla,3,Wed Jul 1 17:38:13 2015 UTC,Sales taxes are pretty regressive They cannot be implemented for local jurisdictions without state legislation. Good luck with that
Detroit,3brvg5,ivyleague481,0,Wed Jul 1 17:32:12 2015 UTC,"the argument that it's regressive is somewhat of a stretch. if anything it's proportional given the non-prepared food exemption. what's your argument for it to be regressive in that context?   On that, what's the alternative. If their living below the poverty line, they're likely not paying property tax nor paying income tax. How else is a city to provide services to them if they can't be paid for?   A sales tax provides a uniform way to tax not only that spent by residents in the city, but those outside the city as well. if anything it's a marginal difference in cost if it is w/in 1-200 bps"
Detroit,3brvg5,Khorasaurus,3,Wed Jul 1 17:48:25 2015 UTC,"If their living below the poverty line, they're likely not paying property tax nor paying income tax.   People who live below the poverty line still pay rent; the landlord pays the property tax on their behalf. Increase the property tax, rent goes up. No, they don't pay income tax, but that's because it doesn't make sense to people's income when they need every last penny of it to provide the basics for living.   I would actually be in favor of a 1% bump in the sales tax if it were dedicated to a specific service. For instance, many cities have a half-cent or one-cent sales tax to fund transportation operations and infrastructure. But a sales tax increase that just goes to the general fund? Who knows where that goes. Probably debt service or some tax abatement for corporate relocations. I am not enthusiastic about that. Additionally, I think Detroit's tax base, even with this 'downtown retail increase' (which, let's be honest, can't possibly amount to that much) is far too small for such a tax to meaningfully affect service provision in the city."
Detroit,3brvg5,auf_der_autobahn,3,Wed Jul 1 18:01:23 2015 UTC,"Several reasons:   Sales taxes are regressive. Detroit is a poor city already.  This just incentivizes businesses and customers to purchase products outside Detroit. Detroit's suburbs are already nicer, and safer, so further disincentive to shop outside Detroit is unnecessary. This will drive business to shopping online rather than locally.   Detroit ALREADY has a city income tax, and some of the more onerous regulations regarding small businesses in the country.  If you want to generate tax revenue for Detroit, revise the Occupancy Permit regulations so that it's possible to have a live/work space and run a business out of your home without running afoul of the city codes.  Revise the food truck permit process, so that folks who want to start a small business making delicious food for people have a straightforward path to doing so.  Basically, Detroit government needs to pull its head out of its ass and clear away the red tape so that would be entrepreneurs can start up businesses legally, rather than worrying about whether they'll be cited or fined or have to bribe someone just to keep going.  Make it easy to start small businesses, and then the business taxes and the new employees' income tax will boost the city's coffers.  Keep driving people away with more stupid taxes and rules and you'll keep seeing Detroit's population drop, while the cities that surround it keep growing."

And then it should pay for something regional such as transit.   A lot of major metro areas have a little extra on top of the state sales tax, frequently for public transportation. That's currently illegal in Michigan, I believe, but I think it could work here. However, it would not be effective just within the City of Detroit."

Detroit,3bqqjj,bubsiez,0,Fri Jul 3 04:48:30 2015 UTC,"Nobody is asking for free water- we're asking for the city to implement the 2005 Water Affordability Plan that was already passed by City Counsel and was never enforced.

Detroit,3bn4oy,denodster,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:10:37 2015 UTC,There are only 3 lanes after the intersection.
Detroit,3bn4oy,danielcsmith2,0,Wed Jul 1 14:01:08 2015 UTC,In this picture you have 4 lanes on the other side of the intersection when only 3 are actually marked on the road
Detroit,3bn4oy,Strypes4686,12,Tue Jun 30 21:36:00 2015 UTC,"Forgive me if I'm wrong but.... You're never supposed to change lanes in an intersection. ever.  Looking at your picture you stayed in your lane,the other car did not and unless the other car was ahead of you with the turn signal on they need to fall in behind you.  Then again... Detroit's traffic laws seem like more of a suggestion considering how people drive."
Detroit,3bn4oy,ornryactor,4,Tue Jun 30 16:14:33 2015 UTC,"Forgive me if I'm wrong but.... You're never supposed to change lanes in an intersection.   You are absolutely correct. This is one of those (many) things that despite being law, most folks fail to learn in driver's education, and those that do forget it. For whatever reason it stuck with me, and I always wonder if anybody on the road around me even knows that.  Of course, it's hard as fuck to maintain your lane in Detroit when an intersection has no paint lines for 200 feet before or after, or it goes from 4 lanes on one side to 3 on the other, or all the lanes inexplicably shift 12 feet to the left with zero warning for an unsuspecting driver (which leads to people being aggressive asshats)."

Detroit,3bn4oy,himynameiszck,6,Thu Jul 2 03:00:08 2015 UTC,"Wow, what a dumb intersection. It looks like you are technically in the wrong, but I'd blame it more on poor road design.  Before the intersection, there are four lanes: (1) thru, (2) thru, (3) thru+right, and (4) right only. At the next intersection, you have (A) left only, (B) thru+left, and (C) thru. It would make much more sense if the 1 became A, 2 became B, and 3 became C, as you assumed was the case. However, drivers have an instinct to go in the direction that the curbs and lines point them to before entering the intersection, so engineers take that into account when designing the roads. What actually happens is A opens up to the left of 1, 1 becomes B, and 2 and 3 merge into C because 3 loses a lot of its traffic to the right turn and a parking lane opens up beyond the following intersection.  Sorry for the long answer, I had to think it out as I typed. But it looks like you were technically in the wrong, although you shouldn't have been. Blame crappy road design, not yourself or the jackass who screamed at you."

Detroit,3bn4oy,KlueBat,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:44:30 2015 UTC,I was just confused because if your in the left lane it lines up with the middle lane across the intersection better than the middle lane does.
Detroit,3bn4oy,delurhparg,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:47:21 2015 UTC,I have to agree. If the other driver did not want to turn left he should have slowed down and merged behind the OP.

Detroit,3bn4oy,frigginwizard,2,Tue Jun 30 15:46:20 2015 UTC,"I was in between the red lines so I was in the middle of 3 lanes going forward, they were on the left of the 3 lanes."
Detroit,3bn4oy,danielcsmith2,3,Tue Jun 30 15:48:55 2015 UTC,"DOH! I think I misread the map.  You did what was right.  There were four lanes, with the furthest on the right being a right turn lane.  If we label (from the left) the lanes; 1,2,3,4 you were in lane 2.  Other driver was in lane 1.  After the intersection, you both should be in the same lane.  You and the driver both tried to occupy lane 2.  In order to do so, the other driver had to switch lanes mid intersection, which is illegal.  You are technically correct... the best kind of correct."

I hate the dream cruise, but it is free to watch and you probably can't find that density of classic cars in a lot of other places.   The zoo, while not free, is awesome. I had a membership one year and went all the time. The membership is nice because not only are you supporting the zoo but you can go anytime without really thinking about whether you feel like spending $10.

It's not like mnfr is still happening like it used to in that area. Covering the Ford is another story, but i think we'd be okay with the Fisher losing out on that capacity if it were left in place.   That freeway is more of a commuter freeway anyway, not as much of a transportation hub for chemicals/hazardous materials, i'd have to imagine - maybe i'm wrong, just pure guesswork."
Detroit,3bjfws,gpforlife,5,Mon Jun 29 19:17:17 2015 UTC,"Well, tanker trucks keep blowing up on the stretch of I-75 through Midtown, so presumably they are using the portion across the northern edge of Downtown.

Detroit,3bio5t,jst1vaughn,0,Mon Jun 29 21:26:57 2015 UTC,"technology really reduces a lot of these. Upstart costs are high, but spread that across the life of the system and it's quite low. It doesn't have to be a massive installation all at once, but could go in spurts. Downtown and then spread out to the higher crime areas.   Tech already would streamline the monitoring process - don't need eyes on all camera's at one time. there are facial recognition programs and monitoring systems which could be queued up to look for specific people, car models/plates, or specific actions.   If it meant lower crime, greater enforcement, i think the public would support it. Again, making sure the system doesn't infringe on rights is key, but it's a balance."
Detroit,3bio5t,JoumanaKayrouz,2,Mon Jun 29 15:48:08 2015 UTC,"I don't believe it's manageable on a large scale.

I also hate (and don't understand) ""The District"". What kind of generic bullshit is that? Yeah, okay, ""the arena district"" and it's gonna fall equally on both sides of the Midtown/Downtown border, but really? Both areas have well-defined and well-known borders; does IllitchCorp really expect either of those names to be even partially supplanted by his marketing team's beige forced moniker?  EDIT: Oh my god, THEY DO. Scroll down to the map- they're trying to redefine Midtown as only existing north of MLK/Mack, and downtown as south of Michigan/Campus Martius/Greektown. They even throw in a ""Lower Woodward"" out of nowhere to make it look like Gilbert doesn't completely own all of the rest of downtown. They seriously expect ""The District"" to be the accepted term for everything from Grand Circus to Whole Foods. WTF.  They have a few good things going there, but I really think they're trying way too hard. People aren't gonna use these names other than to mock them."

Also, I think that ""Cass Park"" (no ""Village"") is going to become a more widely used name as that area gentrifies, and I think ""Midtown"" is going to mean north of MLK/Mack once that happens. ""Cass Corridor"" will only be used for nostalgia purposes or to protest gentrification.   Edit: Also, ""Columbia Street"" is just Foxtown. I'm not sure why they didn't use that name."

Detroit,3bigmk,MGoAzul,3,Mon Jun 29 14:21:22 2015 UTC,"I move downtown July 22 and am interested in both. Getting more into iOS at the moment, but something like this sounds fun."
Detroit,3bigmk,joosebox,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:03:15 2015 UTC,would really like to speak with you if you are downtown anytime soon. do you have any work you've done I could look at?
Detroit,3bg9ut,MGoAzul,10,Sun Jun 28 23:30:44 2015 UTC,"I've been downtown without a car for four years now, and I meet a fair number of people who are doing the same thing by choice. It's totally doable if you work within 2-3 miles of where you live.  I use my bicycle most of the time, which is definitely the most convenient way to get around midtown/downtown, assuming you are physically capable. Never need to worry about parking, rush hour traffic is something you breeze through instead of getting stuck in, and bike theft isn't a huge problem here compared to other large cities. Sometimes if I have 1/2 hour to get to the office, I'll switch it up and walk to work. I also joined the downtown Y so I can take a shower before I get to work, if I need to.  My job provides a bus pass ($49/mo), but I only keep it on me in case of emergencies. I use Uber to get around if I'm going out. If I need to run a big box errand in the suburbs, I can grab a Zipcar ($50/yr membership) for $9/hr, there are lots downtown and midtown. If I need a car for a weekend, you can usually find a cheap rental at Enterprise for like 35 bucks a day. Those might sound like expensive options; but when I consider a car payment + 48202 insurance + parking at my building(s), I spend way less on uber+zipcar+enterprise per month than I would if I owned my own vehicle. Your financial math might be different if your car is paid off or you can insure in the suburbs.  It's definitely a different way to live (i.e. it helps to be able to run errands & socialize close to home), but if you work & live inside the Blvd (and even in B/E, or Indian Village) it's actually pretty easy to do. You can save a ton of cash and it keeps you healthy and happy. It would certainly be way harder if I had regular obligations or a S.O. out in the suburbs; my family lives out there but I only see them every other month or so. Like other posters have mentioned, you will want to invest in some high-quality clothing, especially in the wintertime. I'd advise giving it a try for a few weeks and see if it's for you."
Detroit,3bg9ut,delurhparg,4,Mon Jun 29 03:21:20 2015 UTC,"I live in Boston Edison and don't have a car by choice. Detroit is one of the best places ever to bike, there is little traffic and wide streets. It's a super nice ride from north-end to midtown/downtown. I use to ride year round everyday but Uber has made life soooo much better in the winter when it's crazy out you can easily just call a car."
Detroit,3bg9ut,magic6435,3,Mon Jun 29 12:31:48 2015 UTC,"Hey there. Great choice if you come Downtown. I have lived here for around 18 months and by chooce don't own a car. I work less than a mile away (RenCen) from where I live so walking/biking has always been an option. I do my groceries either in Eastern Market or Whole Foods. And I play soccer 2-3 times a week in Novia/Pontiac, so when I do need a car, I use Zipcar. It is 9 dolars per hour and they pay for gas and insurance. I cannot stress enough how much more convenient/cheaper/environmentally sound and all round better option it is to not have a car. Several of my friends have started to sell or return their lease because they dont use thwir car for months"
Detroit,3bg9ut,pitimutis,2,Mon Jun 29 12:58:04 2015 UTC,"I should have mentioned that Zipcar covers gas and insurance (not tolls though.) They also have an incredible deal where you can reserve cars overnight (6pm-830am next day), on weekdays for just $29."
Detroit,3bg9ut,delurhparg,3,Mon Jun 29 14:21:30 2015 UTC,"I know a guy who lives in woodbridge and doesn't own a car. He put thousands of dollars into his bike and winterwear. He commutes to downtown on his bike year round and he likes not owning a car, but hes pretty hard core.  I live in corktown and have small children, so i own a car, but I tend to commute on foot to save on parking. It's a mile walk to my job and if I'm lazy I can take the bus, but the bus only runs every 30 minutes, so I have to text DDOT to see exactly when it will be near my house. If its raining or really cold, I can take the people mover between the bus terminal and where I work.  Tldr: If you want to you can live in the greater downtown area and not own a car. But it takes some effort."
Detroit,3bg9ut,denodster,2,Mon Jun 29 01:33:19 2015 UTC,A friend of mine wrote this article about living in Detroit with no car. At the time he lived in the Leland and worked downtown. The article details his experiences.   He did end up buying a car last year; he moved to Woodbridge which is a bit further away from his work.
Detroit,3bg9ut,primesuspect,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:57:03 2015 UTC,I would love to be able to commute by public transport here. We are just not there yet but I'm hoping if the M1 stretches to Ferndale I might be in business.
Detroit,3bg9ut,jonny_prince,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:07:23 2015 UTC,My friend tried. After a couple bad experiences on the bus he bought a car again.
Detroit,3bg9ut,BaboonRockFighter,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:26:58 2015 UTC,"I sold my car in May and it's been pretty smooth without it thus far aside from the week my bike was in the shop. I work in the RenCen and live about a mile away in Lafayette Park. 90% of my commuting is done by bicycle. Other than that, I'll walk when it's reasonable, take the bus here and there, and use Uber/Lyft if the weather is bad or I'm going a bit farther. Leaving the city is tough, but I only have to worry about that maybe once a month.   So far, I took the bus to Ferndale, an Uber to Royal Oak, and borrowed a friend's car to get to Ann Arbor. You do have to rely on friends a bit more to some extent. My family lives in the suburbs, and I used to live in Ann Arbor, which gives me more reasons to head out there. Some of how difficult it will be depends on how much of life you have in the surrounding areas. If you're moving from out of town and don't really know anyone else, you'll probably have no real issues.   There's no reason you can't do 99% of what you need inside the city. Living downtown, grocery shopping will be a bit more difficult (I live next door to a store, so no problem for me). You'll definitely want to have a backpack/bag that you can fit a decent amount into since you'd be a mile or so from any real store. You'll also want to get used to shopping online, for when you want things like clothes, sheets, furniture, etc. Those options are definitely much more limited.  I can't really speak to winter, since I just started. I imagine I'd take a few more Uber/Lyft/bus rides during cold and snow. I did ride my bike about 50% of the time even when I had a car. I will be moving away in September, so it's not a concern for me.  But one thing is that I've saved a good amount of money. Owning a car was costing me about $300 per month ($200-ish insurance, $15+ for parking, $50-75 gas), not even counting depreciation. In the first month without it, I probably spent no more than $100 on transportation, and that included a $50 bike repair. Even getting to Royal Oak was only about a $15 Uber ride."
Detroit,3bg9ut,petee0518,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:02:42 2015 UTC,"I feel like not having a car is going to be extremely limiting.  Downtown is great and all, but it's not the same as Chi or NYC, you're going to be missing out on a lot of things that only exist in metro Detroit.  Or paying for a lot of Uber rides."
Detroit,3bg9ut,greenw40,0,Mon Jun 29 14:00:19 2015 UTC,"Winters are brutal. I goto school at Wayne state, and in the winter it sucks just to walk a quarter mile. I couldn't imagine dealing with long commutes. Detroit lacks complete streets with bike lanes and such. It wouldn't be easy."

Detroit,3bgpfs,gpforlife,2,Mon Jun 29 10:09:55 2015 UTC,"I agree. This would be awesome (especially to add a new building to the skyline), but if we only have enough hotel demand to do either this or the Wurlitzer, I'd choose the Wurlitzer.   The Foundations Hotel right across Larned is supposed to start renovations this summer (may have already). I assume they've taken that into account when considering adding 400 new rooms at the Ponchartrain?  I do think the article made an interesting point that adding rooms to an existing hotel is more profitable than building a new hotel, because you don't have to build the lobby/front desk/pool/etc. The Ponchartrain is really the only downtown hotel in a position to easily add more rooms (maybe Greektown Casino).   And one final thought - it's really amazing that a hotel that closed within the past decade and only reopened two years ago is already thinking about adding rooms. That just shows how far Downtown Detroit has come in a relatively short time."
Detroit,3bgpfs,Khorasaurus,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:19:07 2015 UTC,"The added supply from the Wurlitizer is immaterial. The Ponch is adding supply for the convention market, more so, it would appear. Wurlitizer is going for an entirely different market."
Detroit,3bgpfs,gpforlife,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:45:18 2015 UTC,"Maybe/hopefully. The proximity of the Broadway People Mover stop will make the Wurlitzer attractive for people going to conventions at Cobo, but obviously the Wurl won't host any conferences itself. My concern is that the new owners will see 400 new hotel rooms going up (500 including the Foundations) and decide they missed their chance to take advantage of a market gap."
Detroit,3bgpfs,Khorasaurus,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:13:30 2015 UTC,"The Wurlitzer is only going to be a 100-room hotel. I am more worried about the funding certainty of any development, however, Gilbert's spin machine has done a great job for everyone on that.  Couple years ago, if you went to talk to a commercial banker about a loan for a hotel rehab in Detroit, they would have called security."

I also put in a request via email to fix my dishwasher, and turnaround time was within a day.  I live in Amber Corners South Apartments in Royal Oak.

Detroit,3bf7v7,lovedetroit,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:33:53 2015 UTC,SO and I looked at a couple units in Clawson area last summer. The property manager (I guess?) just handed us a key and told us which ones were vacant. We thought it was strange that they trusted us with the key but whatever. The units we saw were a good size but they were smelly and extremely outdated. Ultimately we rented somewhere else because amber seemed overpriced. Now we're buying a house in the area which is honestly more affordable than renting.

Last year they sold the Palladium to Emagine who is renovating the building, and just recently they sold the Birmingham 8 to another company.  I guess if they're closing the RenCen it means they couldn't find a buyer.  It's been about 5 years since I worked for them, but I'm not really surprised.  Based on who they staffed there, and the condition of the projection equipment, coupled with the hours of operation, I actually thought it would have closed sooner."

I had an ok view of Tech Town before ( Ive actually used some of their services ), but after that I have to question everything I see coming out of there.

The city is slowly coming back. the past decade, for the first time since the Ren-Cen was built, there has been substantial investment in the city - both public and private money. If you look at the greater arena district, over 1.5 billion in investment/development. Add in the m-1, new housing developments, and all the greater-downtown/midtown renovations and that number exceeds 2-2.3 billion.   For the first time in 55 year the detroit population voted in a white mayor and the number of whites and those with college degrees moving into detroit proper likely exceeds by a magnitude or more, their exodus. Crime is dropping, tax revenue is starting to normalize and the city is beginning to see efficincy gains in utilities and public services - it's not uniform but pockets are showing and it will slowly spread outward.   A lot more has to happen, socially and fiscally, but it's on an upward trajectory. It's up and down trend in all categories, over the past few years and going forward, but if you average it all out its looking positive."

It used to be senior living which I like - the old-timers are friendly and helpful. I was a harbinger of gentrification when I arrived last summer. Shortly after moving in, they switched managent, raised the rent, and put a gate around the parking lot. The rent hikes primarily effected the older tenants in the in the unrenovated apartments - not sure how to feel about that. In any case, I really like the location - next to a library and a grocery, within walking distance of River Walk. The reasonable pricing and the views from the fourth story up are both added bonuses.

The lower economic levels are going to be pushed out of their former residences as rents rise.

Since it was a a referendum voted by the public in 2004 which makes gay marriage in Michigan unconstitutional, he has an obligation to defend that in the eyes of the State of Michigan. Frankly, he was just doing his job. In fact, if he didn't argue the interests of the State in that light, he could have been liable to lose his law license and be disbarred."
Detroit,3b3hv6,kr2c,13,Thu Jun 25 19:18:39 2015 UTC,"That is a valid point, and part of the problem.  The voters also elected to legalize medical marijuana, which Schuette did his best to obstruct while trumpeting the federal laws as a basis.

Detroit,3b3mvy,mconeone,3,Fri Jun 26 14:22:06 2015 UTC,I think killing two kids while running from the police is pretty necessary imprisonment.  But YMMV.
Detroit,3b3mvy,detroitdoesntsuckbad,0,Fri Jun 26 15:25:20 2015 UTC,"I agree; what this guy did is awful.  However, a life sentence means that there is no possibility of rehabilitation.  Is that truly the case here?  Or is the sentence based more on retribution?"

Detroit,3b3mvy,LeftDetroitThrowAway,0,Fri Jun 26 16:22:16 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends on a lot of factors, including the effectiveness of rehabilitation in our prison system.  For comparison, Anders Breivik got 21 years for his killing spree."
Detroit,3b3mvy,mconeone,3,Fri Jun 26 16:30:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not asking for comparisons or examples. A person flees from the police, needlessly kills two children, and injures 4 others in the process. Considering that you seem to be concerned with his rehabilitation, what do you believe the sentence should be for the person responsible? Because I'm absolutely fine with life in prison."
Detroit,3b3mvy,LeftDetroitThrowAway,-1,Fri Jun 26 16:43:56 2015 UTC,"Assuming rehabilitation was possible (via professional diagnosis) 20-30 years or so.  If crimes in prison were committed, then he would receive an appropriate amount of additional time.  I think people tend to discount the severity of taking decades of a person's life.  Besides the non-rehabilitable, a life/death sentence is an admission that we as a society have failed this person."
Detroit,3b3mvy,mconeone,3,Fri Jun 26 16:58:56 2015 UTC,"I hope it's retribution.  This person just took two children's lives by acting recklessly.  Two children won't get to grow up, won't get to graduate school, won't get to give their parents grandchildren one day.  Their parents get to live with this useless loss every day.  I hope it's retribution."

There's a great campsite in Glen Arbor, and a quick trip up to Pyramid Point - great trails ending in one of the most spectacular dunes the state has to offer. Look out onto the Manitou Islands from a massive pile of sand. It's personally my favorite place I've been in the world.   Northern Michigan is where it's at this time of the year and well worth the drive."

Detroit,3b1e8k,showershitters,6,Thu Jun 25 13:57:17 2015 UTC,"ACLU Michigan just launched their ""Mobile Justice Michigan"" app, I know it's at least available for iPhone and may be Android as well.  It not only records audio and video but also sends your recording directly to the ACLU and can alert you (if you want) to other people nearby who have the app and have activated it to record their police interaction so that you can go witness it if you like.  I would imagine that in some situations, ""I'm recording this and the video is being delivered directly to the ACLU"" might cause some second thoughts."

However this theory lends no necessary individual safety. Considered a form of attribution, the individual assumes that others either are responsible for taking action or have already done so.  The phenomenon tends to occur in groups of people above a certain critical size and when responsibility is not explicitly assigned. It rarely occurs when the person is alone and diffusion increases with groups of three or more.

Detroit,3b34gt,Khorasaurus,2,Thu Jun 25 17:16:49 2015 UTC,Yeah - I would rather deal with a slightly longer commute distance wise and avoid the traffic you'll get on 696. Midtown is not a bad compromise between the two - half hour from Novi and 40m from New Baltimore.

Detroit,3b34gt,gpforlife,2,Thu Jun 25 17:28:54 2015 UTC,"The commute to Novi is definitely easier from RO/Ferndale - you can use 696, and if that's backed up you can use 8 Mile and cut up at the Lodge or M-5.

If it fits your commute requirements (which it seems to), you're good to go. AFAIC, living in one is the same as the other (distance wise) from a nightlife perspective unless you snag a place walking distance to the respective downtown areas.

I cannot think of a better way for the DPD to get their message out that they are combating graffiti than this.    It's completely understandable, very pragmatic, and frankly smart. They don't need to expend any extra resources than they already have been on this, -just issue a press release and boom. Word is out.  The property owners have every right to go after someone defacing their property, no matter what its current state. If DPD is gonna ruin some poor kids day by arresting him for tagging, I'm sorry, but no way should a famous artist be let off the hook.   All that being said, if he defaced my property I'd make it the fucking centerpiece. Every owner gets to make their own determination, but as far as I'm concerned, he just painted my wall with hundred dollar bills."

It's their love, their desire, their feelings. It's them. You're hating the person as much as you try and trick yourself into believing otherwise.    Wait, really? You're saying you're atheist?   Yeppers."
Detroit,3ayltf,ecib,-1,Thu Jun 25 15:34:14 2015 UTC,"You're conflating ""God"" and ""Christians"". Some Christians certainly do hate gay people, but that doesn't mean The Bible teaches that God does. Christianity doesn't teach that people who have gay thoughts or urges are bad. It does teach that acting on those urges is bad. I'm an atheist too (edit: and I'm gay), but at least I bother to understand the religion and its nuances when I criticize it. You have been extremely ham-handed in your attempt, hence the liberal helping of downvotes you're getting."

Some Christians certainly do hate gay people, but that doesn't mean The Bible teaches that God does.   The Bible is the Word of God according to Christians, and the Bible calls homosexuality immoral. You're back on the rope.   Christianity doesn't teach that people who have gay thoughts or urges are bad. It does teach that acting on those urges is bad.   This is precisely what I already described in the comment that you are actually replying to, explaining precisely how this is semantic gymnastics. I won't retype the explanation of why this is a contradiction.   I'm an atheist too (edit: and I'm gay), but at least I bother to understand the religion and its nuances when I criticize it.   You have not so far demonstrated any specific knowledge of the Bible or any particular bit of nuance aside from some weak semantics as far as I can see (the opposite of nuance, really). I personally have read the entire thing, front to back, word for word, twice, along with select passages literally thousands of times. I've read every single begat for Christ's sake (if you've read it you know what that's a reference to). This is more than I can say for most Christians I've met. Along with being born and raised, attending church every weekend and going to private religious school along with all of the requisite religion classes and extra church on weekdays...yeah.

Applicants are questioned in various ways. Some are asked about what cars they own and how they paid for their house.   20 years and nobody bothered questioning the status of the applicants?

I'm pretty confident the community prefers development, jobs, and excitement to open space, no?   Fact is, red wings need a new stadium. Seeing that rent is already getting pricey in Downtown and Midtown (2k+/month in some buildings for a studio on woodward inside the loop), this will drasticly increase housing as well as fill a void in between midtown and downtown. Add to that the Brush park development and things look pretty interesting.   You can complain, but having the larger tax base will be important over the long term. You can't look at this in the context of 2 years, 5 years, or even 10 years. if this development brings the 8300 temp and 1100 permanent jobs to downtown (b/c of just the arena district, assuming they only make 40k/year on average, that's an additional 4.51m-8.64m in income tax for the city in workers for just this project.   Double or tripple that above figure if the new residential going up brings in 10k or more people. that gives the city about <15 years until they recoup their investment assuming average income is 40k (yuppies and other young professionals in downtown will likely look to these places) much quicker if you factor in real estate taxes, state income tax going back to the city, wage inflation, and even a city income tax if ever pushed into effect."

The question is whether the buyer will be content to do the minimum level of maintenance and collect just enough rent to turn a profit (i.e. APOP at the Penobscot Building) or whether they will reach for the stars with updates/renovations/partial residential conversion/etc and really make these buildings shine.

""It has more to do with the fact that education is horrible (and) joblessness and poverty rates are way too high,"" he said. ""They're not shooting at people based on any ideology or philosophical or theological thing.""   Terrorism isn't just a ""mean"" thing to call the situation. It implies that the shooters are doing it for religious or ideological reasons. This clouds the issue and allows the aforementioned problems of education and joblessness to continue.

And no, shitty upbringing is no justification but it is an important context if we wish to move forward and fix these problems in the future.

However cinema tastes have changed and people have to have their Star Theater stadium style seating, so down come all those shitty flat venues.  It was shocking to me to drive by the corner of 15 mile and Van Dyke and see the Showcase Cinema gone.  Then again there is pretty much nothing left of my youth south of 11 mile that hasn't been turned into some kind of industrial thing, a fast food joint, or a bar."

I never had any problems and the apartment was beautiful. I moved because they wouldn't let me have another person living there to make it more affordable.. So I moved into another one bedroom.. splitting the $800 with a roomate. Totally blows that one of us has no door and then the other door on the bedroom doesn't even shut. YIPPPEEE :D"

Personally, I consider everything from Trenton in the south, Canton up to Novi in the west, and Pontiac over to Selfridge in the North to be part of Detroit.    I am always amused that someone from the suburbs of Chicago says they are from Chicago, the burbs of LA say they are from LA, and so on, but the people from the suburbs of Detroit say the suburb when asked where they are from. I am not native to Detroit, I am here for Grad school. As a result, unlike most other people that live in the suburbs of Detroit, I say that I live in Detroit, even though I technically do not."

Detroit,3arrwf,MichiganMan12,2,Tue Jun 23 15:13:05 2015 UTC,"I am confused by what you are saying.  Detroit, as a city proper is massive compared to other major cities. It's size is the cornerstone to it's problems, too few resources spread out too thin.  The entire cities of Boston and San Francisco, as well as the borough of Manhattan fit into the land area of the City of Detroit. Add to that all the other communities mentioned (encompasses about 800 sq miles, pretty close to the size of Rhode Island) and it's much much bigger.  I don't see how you can draw the conclusion that Detroit is small."
Detroit,3arrwf,Smithers66,2,Tue Jun 23 14:48:31 2015 UTC,"Detroit is both too big and too small. As you say, the City is too big geographically for a population of only 700,000. But on the other hand, only 700,000 of the 5 million people who live in the metro area live in the City. That ratio creates many of the regional political problems that we have. The City is also a relatively small percentage of the land area of the sprawling metro area, which also poses problems."
Detroit,3arrwf,Khorasaurus,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:52:40 2015 UTC,"Detroit's size to population isn't that unreasonable. There are other cities that are less dense than Detroit that are doing much better. Toledo for example has about 80 sq miles, but only about 250,000 people. If you do the math, thats less people per square mile than Detroit. But they have a mix of large parks and farmland inside of city limits, which means there isn't as much infrastructure to maintain. Detroit needs to redevelop the areas that have turned to urban prairie into something else that requires less infrastructure, such as farm land. I'm lookin at you...east Kerchival St."
Detroit,3arrwf,denodster,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:44:01 2015 UTC,"Meanwhile, Houston's land area is 600 sq miles (4.3x larger than Detroit), Nashville's is 504 sq miles (3.6x larger), and for Dallas it's 341 sq miles (2.5x larger). Turns out it's not about the size of the city, it's about what's in the city. Houston has a healthy downtown and wealthy suburbs within the city limits to balance out its poorer areas. Detroit... doesn't. If the City of Detroit encompassed the land where Grosse Pointe, Dearborn, and Troy sit, then it's very unlikely it would have went bankrupt."
Detroit,3arrwf,himynameiszck,0,Wed Jun 24 02:25:08 2015 UTC,"This reminds me a lot of Columbus. Typically, though, it works out in the city's favor. The annexation of so much land has proven extremely detrimental to modern day Detroit."
Detroit,3arrwf,GloryToColumbus,5,Tue Jun 23 04:10:14 2015 UTC,"Eh, not really. The more stable neighborhoods tend to be on the outskirts of the city.

If the city was collecting revenue from areas with very strong tax bases, such as Dearborn and the Grosse Pointes, it would be doing much better financially."

Detroit,3arhod,jayjaywalker3,3,Tue Jun 30 16:04:04 2015 UTC,"Yes. Detroit, Cleveland, and Buffalo have a three-way competition every season called the Rust Belt Derby. It was started and is carried on by the supporters' groups (not the team/league offices) but is treated as semi-official by the players and coaches involved. Detroit has won it in 2013, 2014, and 2015.  Even more unofficially, DCFC supporters really, really hate the city of Cleveland in the context of soccer, but we're friendly with their supporter group. (Also I think Cleveland is actually a really cool place...)  EDIT: /u/BDCanuck worded it much better. Detroit and Cleveland pretend to hate each other, but it's basically in good fun."

Detroit,3arhod,jayjaywalker3,2,Tue Jun 30 20:46:08 2015 UTC,"Cleveland and Buffalo have big supporters group too?   Lol, no. No, they do not. They each have a 'supporters group' in the most technical sense, in that there is more than one supporter and they identify with a common name. But the few supporters that are there, we're friendly with.  The only 4th-tier team in the country with higher attendance than Detroit is Chattanooga (Tennessee); they draw 3k-5k per game, according to our head capo (/u/sgtscary) who knows some folks there. Detroit has the biggest supporters group in the country by a long shot, though- there's no ""membership"" and nobody takes attendance, but a safe estimate is that Detroit has about 300 people who both consider themselves to be ""in"" the SG and who also actively participate. Add the hangers-on on the edges and that number gets much bigger. Chattanooga is second, with just under 100 folks. After that... well, a dozen would probably get you third place in the nation.  EDIT: Fixed with the answer to your question."
Detroit,3arhod,ornryactor,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:56:06 2015 UTC,Any chance of them moving up to the USL? I did read the article about how both DCFC and the other detroit team were vying to be the first one for a stadium to move up but I don't remember if it was for MLS or what.
Detroit,3arhod,jayjaywalker3,2,Tue Jun 30 21:11:29 2015 UTC,"Ov vey, there's a can of worms if you ever wanted one.  Those are two separate questions, and both are deeply complex and difficult answers with no clear summary but a shitload of history and no small amount of vitriol, plus good old-fashioned politics and money fucking things up along the way.  My best attempt (only because I'm leaving the office right now and will be able to avoid Internet Hate until tomorrow): DCFC and especially its fans want OUT of the NPSL, because the league is an organizational circus that melts into a full-on shitshow just a bit more often than is acceptable for even a 4th-tier semi-pro-but-mostly-amateur league. DCFC is such a ridiculous outlier in the NPSL that it could almost definitely do well in a higher league, especially given the front office's talent with marketing and development (which is a big reason why DCFC is an outlier in the NPSL). However, the higher leagues are rife with problems of their own. The common consensus among many Detroit fans who pay attention to things like this is that jumping straight to the NASL would be the preferred move. That's primarily because the NASL allows teams roughly the same level of creative and administrative control as the NPSL does. That's a bad thing for the many, many teams who are uncreative and disorganized, but it's a huge upshot for Detroit. The USL, from what I understand, is extremely strict with its centralized control of teams, plus the owner of another 4th-tier team about 30 miles from here (Michigan Bucks) owns the rights to any possible USL team in southeast Michigan for another year yet.  The stadium question is separate from the league question, but tied closely to it. It's even murkier. Short story shorter: Bucks owner (little brother of Detroit's popular current mayor) wants a team in Detroit so he can make that sweet, sweet cash money. He doesn't care who or what that team is. He'd love an MLS team but has no chance of gaining the political or financial capital to make that happen, so he wants to beat DCFC to the punch and get a stadium in downtown Detroit on the theory that fans will support whatever team is at the highest league and that two teams won't survive. DCFC wants to grow as DCFC, and would rather not have needless competition right there in the city, but the focus is on their own club and achieving success at whatever level they play at. Many DCFC fans don't give a damn shit about the level that DCFC plays at; they're their for the club, not the league. They will watch DCFC at 2nd-tier or 4th-tier, regardless of who else is playing. DCFC has very much outgrown the (fairly nice) high school stadium they play at but does not yet have the capital to build a brand-new stadium in the downtown area. Likely result is to move to a bigger stadium a few miles away that they will pay to renovate, be there for a few years until that space is outgrown, and then re-evaluate the landscape at that time. There is zero way of predicting what all will happen in that intervening period, so it's difficult to do anything beyond daydream.  I really hope I didn't totally fuck that all up."

We apologized and said we'd go back and do that immediately and started to turn around, and he goes, ""Or if you don't wanna walk all the way back, you can just hang out behind the barrier and kill 'em right now, if you want.""

Detroit,3asg3t,RyokuCha2,3,Tue Jun 23 03:32:36 2015 UTC,"You already mentioned the Ford Museum, but I definitely think it's worthwhile to hit up the Ford Rouge Tour. My husband and I (who both grew up in LA!) checked it out earlier this month and I feel like it gave me a better sense of the history of the area. And, plus, you get to see a car be put together, which I don't think you can see in LA (though I could be wrong).  I first visited the Metro Detroit area via Chicago last year, so if you end up taking the scenic route btw of Chicago, you can try taking the train from ORD down to Union station downtown (Chicago's transit system is very easy to learn!).   Then, you can take the Amtrak to Michigan. The Amtrak stops in Detroit and has two other stops in Metro Detroit (Royal Oak and Troy). I chose to take Amtrak over the Megabus since I was staying in the Metro Detroit area. Plus, even though I've taken the Megabus to Chicago before, I was a bit uneasy of taking the Megabus down to Detroit, given it was going to drop me off at night.   Anyway, grab a Vernor's, coney dog, and/or Detroit-style pizza while you're here. And don't worry if you get weird looks when you say ""soda"" rather than ""pop"". :) Feel free to shoot me a PM me if you have any other q's!"
Detroit,3asg3t,SingingLaLaLaLaLa,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:47:29 2015 UTC,Nice! I might just do the Amtrak! and the Ford Rouge Tour sounds definitely like something I'd see.  Since you grew up in LA... you'll understand this question best: How's the parking in Downtown/Midtown or any of those places you mentioned for Detroit? The Wedding I'm going is way north of 8th mile so I'll need to rent regardless
Detroit,3asg3t,SingingLaLaLaLaLa,2,Tue Jun 23 05:35:13 2015 UTC,"I don't know much of the parking situation in Downtown/Midtown, but it looks like /u/youversusthesea covered that for you. Royal Oak, Troy, and Birmingham (the other Amtrak stop that I forgot to mention) are in the suburbs. Compared to LA, I haven't found parking an issue in those areas. At worst, I've probably had to wait minutes for a parking meter to open up around dinner time in downtown Birmingham or had to go into the parking structure in downtown Royal Oak on a Saturday night. Do bring change though for parking meters.   If you are going through with Amtrak and choosing one of the stops in the suburbs, go with a car rental company that can pick you up at the stop. Generally, depending on the conditions of the road, I find driving in Metro Detroit more enjoyable than commuting in LA freeways (70 mph speed limit). Oh and read up on Michigan lefts before you come. :)"
Detroit,3asg3t,YouVersusTheSea,2,Tue Jun 23 12:29:30 2015 UTC,"oh god, Michigan Lefts... that is really helpful.  Wait so you can't go higher than 70 in Detroit?"
Detroit,3asg3t,SingingLaLaLaLaLa,2,Tue Jun 23 23:07:07 2015 UTC,"Oh well... I meant everyone here (and I mean all the guys and gals who drive to work the same time as me) hit 80... =X  We call it ""flow of traffic speed"" which is ""okay"" as the elephant in the room...

Detroit,3asg3t,JJWoolls,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:29:07 2015 UTC,"Haha don't get me wrong, I'm incredibly cautious too. Yes I go against the flow sometimes. Let's just say my speed ranges from 40-80 on good days and 0-80 on bad days :P"
Detroit,3asg3t,JJWoolls,3,Mon Jun 29 02:32:07 2015 UTC,"You have one day total? Or you have one day to do something other than the Henry Ford Museum?   As others have mentioned, the DIA is beautiful but if you only have one day total, I'd say go to the Henry Ford Museum instead. It's obviously just my personal opinion but I think it's cooler to see historical artifacts and whatnot than it is to see a gorgeous painting or something. The Ford Museum has things like the limousine JFK was riding in when he was assassinated and, although there are some wonderful/unique pieces at the DIA, the type of things you'll find there are similar to what you can see at some of LA's art museums... whereas the stuff at the Ford Museum is pretty much only the type of things you can see at the Ford Museum.   If you decide to go to the Ford Museum, you're going to want to rent a car. It isn't in Detroit proper and the public transportation in Metro Detroit is not a reliable option. If you end up flying into Chicago and then makings the trip to Detroit, I'd suggest renting a car at the airport through like Enterprise or Hertz and taking advantage of the ""multiple day"" discounted rate. That way, you can make that drive from Chi to Det and then have access to a car for your stay, as opposed to catching the Amtrak, and then having to rent a car anyway. Just make sure the company you choose has a hub at DTW (I'm guessing that's where you're flying out of?) and you should be able to return it at the Michigan location.  I'm a native Michigander currently living in LA so I can probably answer the parking question pretty accurately... Parking in Detroit will seem like a breeze vs parking in LA. There are several public parking garages downtown and they're generally a lot less crowded and cheaper than the options available in DTLA. The only exception to this would be like if you're trying to find a spot near the ballpark when there's a home game going on. You won't have any problems finding parking at the Ford Museum. Hmm... other parking tips? Let's see... Have cash on you (many of the lots in the City don't have the fancy credit card machines like everywhere in LA has so you will need cash). Don't pay anyone to let you park on the street because they should t be charging you anyway and if you've got a rental car, a garage or secured lot with an attendant is a smarter plan, anyway. Try to find a lot that has a few other cars in it and one that is gated, too (there are plenty, don't worry). You can probably find free parking if you look hard enough and you'd probably be fine but since you will have a rental car, which will likely have out-of-state plates, it's not worth the risk of someone smashing a window. You can also park at one of the casinos and grab a cab or shuttle to wherever you want to go in the City, if it's a little too far to walk or you're concerned with walking at night.  Also, if you rent a car and are driving around Metro Detroit, use the damn turn signal when you're switching lanes or turning. I know how you LA types are... ;) The traffic will be a piece of cake for you to handle.  In terms of other things to do, I think the Motown Museum is pretty cool. They do tours every hour and the last one starts an hour before they close (6pm I think?). If you only have a day, you could probably get up early and go to the Henry Ford Museum right when they open, leave around 3-ish (they close at 5 anyway and that would still give you almost 6 hours to check it out), and then head to the Motown Museum from Dearborn. You should beat rush hour and make it before the last tour with plenty of time to spare, if you're interested in that. It'd be a long day but you'd still be able to take a cat nap after at your hotel before checking out the local bar scene, since it's only be like 6pm.  And you need to go to one of the two coney islands for a meal, obviously."

Detroit,3asg3t,kittyportals2,2,Tue Jun 23 05:30:59 2015 UTC,"Take a drive on Woodward starting at the GM Renaissance Center all the way to at least Royal Oak. You will pass the Model T factory in Highland Park and observe an astounding change in demographic once you cross 8 mile road. (Look up other stops along the way.)  The Heidelberg Project is also a good place to stop by. It is the work of local artist Tyree Guyton and a very interesting experience (especially if you have the chance to speak to Tyrese as he is normally walking up and down the street discussing his art work.)  The DIA is a must see and the Charles H. Museum of African American History is the largestmuseum in the world solely dedicated to the African American experience.  Also, comparing the Lafayette Coney Island coney dog and the American Coney Island coney dog is a must do.  Edit: I can't believe I forgot about Eastern Market. If you are there on a Saturday it is worth checking out."

Starting at McNichols, you have renovated apartment buildings in Palmer Park, Palmer Park itself, mansions in Palmer Woods, and Meijers before you cross into Ferndale and see...a bunch of car dealerships.   For a stark city/suburbs divide, Jefferson going into Grosse Pointe is much more dramatic and interesting."

Detroit,3asg3t,JJWoolls,2,Tue Jun 23 12:34:15 2015 UTC,"Lots of great tips already. A quick downtown parking tip - the Greektown Casino garage right off the I-375 Lafayette exit is free unless there's a big event going on downtown. From there, you're in Greektown, with lots of bars/restaurants and the casino, and you're only a block from the People Mover station to take you to other downtown destinations like Campus Martius, the Ren Cen/Riverfront, or the Guardian Building.  Now, that doesn't help you for the DIA (since the People Mover doesn't go to Midtown, buses are unreliable, and the streetcar is still under construction), but if you're going downtown, it's a great option."
Detroit,3asg3t,kittyportals2,2,Tue Jun 23 13:52:39 2015 UTC,"Since I'm traveling alone, less of the bars and pubs and more of ""stuff you gotta have seen coming to Detroit, because: only Detroit"". Is Detroit Institute of Arts of that?  Ha! I guess LA has some saving grace in terms of public transportation... ours exists but it sucks so much everyone just drives. How's parking in Midtown/Downtown? Does ""free parking"" exist or is that not recommended because of safety?  Is megabus a good safe bet? I've heard mixed reports"
Detroit,3asg3t,yourfriendiscute,3,Tue Jun 23 23:08:09 2015 UTC,"Fly into Detroit. You'll be in Romulus, which is a very industrial city. You'll come downtown via 94. What you'll want to see depends on what you like. The DIA is beautiful, and it's across the street from the historical museum, the science center, the public library, the Scarab club gallery, and the college of creative studies with their exhibits. There's also a great sushi place within walking distance. You'd be in midtown, which is safe, and patrolled by Wayne state police. There's a lot to see in midtown, all within blocks of the DIA. If you prefer the downtown area, you can walk down riverwalk and bop in to the renaissance center. The Henry Ford museum is a great place to see history and cars; do not miss the Village, and if you go to the Village, eat only at the Eagle tavern. The village and museum are in Dearborn, which is outside Detroit. While in Dearborn, you should eat middle eastern food. Al Amir is the place they'll tell you to go; it's good and well decorated, but I like the earthier Cedarland, on Warren avenue. In one day, you'd have to choose between the DIA and the Henry Ford. It's about whether you like art or history."

Detroit,3arilv,towehaal,3,Mon Jun 22 22:42:10 2015 UTC,"Welcome to Detroit! Some thoughts:  Transportation: If you're not going to have a car, you can get around the immediate downtown area (bounded by I-75, I-375, and M-10) using the People Mover or by walking. Anywhere outside that area (including the DIA) I'd recommend Uber. Buses here are unreliable, and the streetcar line (which would be perfect to get from downtown to the DIA) won't be finished for another 18 months or so. Walking to places like the DIA or Corktown from downtown is possible and generally safe, but those are long walks.  Safety: You'll generally be safe anywhere you'd want to go as a tourist. There are rough areas, obviously, but there's no reason you'd end up in any of them. Similar to Chicago.   Hotels: Where does your wife have to be for work? The nicest hotels downtown are the Westin Book Cadillac and the Marriott at the Renaissance Center. The best values are probably the Hilton Garden Inn and the Courtyard. If you're interested in staying in a Casino, I'd recommend Greektown for the location or MGM Grand for the actual casino and other on-property amenities. Motor City is kind of out of the way and in a rough area.   Stuff to Do in the Afternoon: If the DIA doesn't take you all day (which it could), there are several other museums the immediate vicinity, including MOCAD (as you mentioned), the Historical Museum, the Science Museum (which is kind of aimed at kids) and the Museum of African American History. The Motown Museum (Hitsville USA) is not right near the others, but is a short Uber ride away. Other than the museums, if the weather is nice, you should check out the Riverwalk. If you have any interest in architecture, make sure to check out the lobbies of some of our more spectacular buildings, most notably the Guardian and David Whitney. You could also check out one of the casinos if that's your thing.  Dinner/Drinks: What kind of food do you like? There are lots of great restaurant options. Greektown is the top ""bar hop"" area, and you can find good food there as well, but that's not the only option.   Hope you enjoy your trip!"
Detroit,3arilv,Khorasaurus,2,Tue Jun 23 01:15:10 2015 UTC,My favorite restaurant in Detroit is GREEN DOT STABLES! You have to check them out. I also love Xochimilcos (located in Mexicantown).
Detroit,3arilv,Tess47,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:31:55 2015 UTC,"Nice comment.  Your thoughts confirmed a lot of what I was already thinking, so that is great.  I'm thinking I may head to the midtown area and then have my wife pick me up.  We may hit a place for a drink or two there, then head downtown and park the car, and walk around for dinner.  Hotel will be downtown because my wife has appointments all over the place and it'll just be easiest at night.  We are heading off to Toronto for a few days afterwards.  Foodwise, I'm thinking Roast is a possibility.  Wright and Company looked interesting too.  We don't do spendy restaurants often, but it'll be on the company!"
Detroit,3arilv,Khorasaurus,2,Tue Jun 23 01:27:18 2015 UTC,My favorite is Greektown.  Oopa!
Detroit,3arilv,Aiede,2,Tue Jun 23 01:49:15 2015 UTC,"Quick tip on Wright and Company (which is great) - it can be kind of hard to find. It doesn't have a sign on the building, just a little A-frame sign with a ""W"" on it on the sidewalk. To find it, go in the door behind John Varvatos and take the elevator to the second floor.   The secretive location adds to the ambience though."
Detroit,3arilv,Suzzettejms,2,Tue Jun 23 02:16:59 2015 UTC,"Wright & Co. is excellent. Roast is good if you're a carnivore (and especially if you stay at the Westin Book Cadillac, in which it's located).  I personally think Greektown has lost its mojo, there's very little ""Greek"" to it any more."
Detroit,3arilv,ecib,2,Wed Jun 24 16:31:28 2015 UTC,There are daily tours at the ren cen during the week. Also the lobby of the guardian building is a beautiful sight!  Nice quick stops right downtown.
Detroit,3arilv,Aiede,2,Tue Jun 23 03:08:19 2015 UTC,"Once my wife is done working we'd probably like a nice place for dinner,    Selden Standard stands a good chance of being the best dining experience you can have in the city.

Detroit,3arilv,Aiede,2,Tue Jun 23 17:46:53 2015 UTC,"The food quality there is excellent, but for a picky eater like me the menu is very small and runs the risk of not having anything on it that I want to eat.  (Yes, I know, first world problem.)"
Detroit,3arilv,stayvicious,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:29:01 2015 UTC,I used to be a pretty picky eater.  Then I realized at upscale establishments they probably have pretty good chefs who understand balance and aren't going to put anything way too strong or offensive on a plate.  It has helped me try new foods!
Detroit,3arilv,slut,2,Wed Jun 24 22:33:17 2015 UTC,"Hotel: I stayed at the Doubletree Fort Shelby for the first time a few weeks back and was shocked at how big the rooms are -- it's an all-suite hotel and I don't know if mine was anything special but it was actually two rooms (sitting room w/ couch & TV and a bedroom behind an actual door, not just a half-wall like a lot of other ""suite"" hotels) that was clean, comfortable and more reasonably priced than the Westin or Marriott. Strongly suggest taking a look.  If you're looking for something cheaper, the Hilton Garden Inn on Brush & Gratiot is probably a good option. If you're looking more personal (but expensive, I assume) the Inn on Ferry Street has more of a B&B vibe.  As for safety -- downtown Detroit is safer than the overall national average for crime, you're most likely to run into smash-and-grabs of parked cars or aggressive panhandling. As with any city, stay on the major streets if you don't know the area to avoid ending up on that ""bad block."" Detroit's very real crime issues tend to be focused more in its residential neighborhoods."
Detroit,3arilv,ecib,3,Wed Jun 24 16:26:32 2015 UTC,"For transportation I'd recommend Uber.  In terms of places to bar hop and eat. Go to Slows, get some BBQ or Gold Cash Gold for some great southern food. There may be a wait but you can go to the Sugar House close by for a great cocktail, and just up the street from there is Two James Distillery and back east is PJ's Lager House. That's the Michigan Avenue route.   Hopefully other people offer some insight as well because there are options, but i'd definitely Uber it if you can.  PM me if you have any questions or what not.  edit...if you're by MOCAD check out HOP CAT, a ton of beers if you're into that (over 100 taps) and some good food."

Detroit,3aqjox,Cstrawser1,9,Mon Jun 22 18:20:28 2015 UTC,words have meaning. what was the political aim of the gunmen?
Detroit,3aqjox,delurhparg,-10,Mon Jun 22 18:52:43 2015 UTC,"a terrorist doesn't have to have a political aim - yes, you can google it and yes, the first thing that pops up is a definition from an undocumented source. But, it's an evolving term and a term of art:  for instance, the UN Security Counsel defines terrorism as a "" 'Criminal Acts' (AR), including against civilians, committed with the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury, or taking of hostages, with the purpose (MR) to provoke a state of terror in the general public of in a group of persons/particular persons to intimidate a population or compel a gov't or an international org to do or to abstain from doing any act, which constitutes offenses w/in the scope of, and defined in, the international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism.   Conversely, the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terror defines Terrorism as:   1: any of the acts detailed in the 14 international conventions defining what terrorism is (hijacking air or sea, suicide bombing, etc), or  2: any other act intended to cause death/serious injury to a civilian or any other person not taking active part in hostilities in a situation of an armed conflict, when the purpose of such act, by nature of context, is to intimidate the population or to compel a gov't/international org to do or abstain from doing an act.  The United States does not have a unified definition of terrorism, and note it is a term of art. What the US judicial system considers when it comes to a true terrorist activity are these 4 main characteristics/essential elements of terrorism which distinguishes it from ordinary crimes:   Acts must constitute a criminal offense under international legal system - covered by the 14 conventions  Must be committed against civilians, but not limited to them  Aimed at spreading terror, intimidation against a state, public, or group of persons  Must be politically, religiously, or otherwise ideologically motivated (not motivated solely motivated by their own private ends.)   Source: leading US legal authority on terrorism law in the US and Internationally."
Detroit,3aqjox,MGoAzul,8,Mon Jun 22 19:31:33 2015 UTC,"it seems like all of your definitions still have some type of broader aim to the violence. maybe the police aren't releasing that information, but it seems like they were targeting Malique Jones, not trying to pressure a government into taking some specific action."
Detroit,3aqjox,delurhparg,-4,Mon Jun 22 19:35:45 2015 UTC,"True, terrorism is intended to compel a person or group of persons to act in a way they were not otherwise acting - but it doesn't have to persuade a government by any means.  Shooting into a crowed intending to kill a sole individual, and send a message to a wider group such as ""don't talk"" etc, could be construed as terrorism under the above definitions.   If you look at the UN SC definition, if this was intended to provoke a ""sense of terror"" in the general public - don't go outside, don't talk to police, don't feel safe in your home, etc. - then as a strict interpretation of the definition it may be construed as a terrorist act."

Detroit,3aqj2n,GTuck,2,Mon Jun 22 19:02:46 2015 UTC,"There are a ton of 8/12/24 game packs available. You can get them through the box office directly, or some partner companies.  As far as full season, you should be able to get them no problem (unless they win the world series - you probably still can, but they are a pretty penny).  The best thing to do is to find someone that might already have two seats, and offer to split a season with them.  Opening day is always the most expensive ticket (its a freaking madhouse downtown), but again, if you have the $$$, they are available on stubhub and ticketmaster.  Any of these routes are generally bad-pretty OK seats. If you are looking for great seats, id go game by game.  ALSO, note this: if you can, always sit first base side. Thats the side that gets shade."
Detroit,3aqj2n,baineschile,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:16:56 2015 UTC,I moved downtown a few years ago and the first thing I did was grab a half-season ticket package. I don't regret it but really make sure you have the time to commit. I had a lot of obligations you don't really realize at the time of purchase pop up. I would recommend firing up a stubhub account as well and auction off the extras you don't use. I had pretty good luck with it and depending on the series and how they were playing you can make some decent money.

Detroit,3aq7l4,delurhparg,4,Mon Jun 22 17:31:18 2015 UTC,The only problem with the Henry Ford is that it has way too much to take in during one day. You should also try to take your kids to the Detroit Institute of Arts (they have a great collection) and the aquarium on Belle Isle. There are tons of new restaurants and bars that have popped up in the past ten years so get out and enjoy as many as possible before you have to leave.

There is a large Muslim population in Dearborn that may seem strange to people not from the area. The Henry Ford is not really in that area though. And Dearborn is actually very low crime.   Detroit proper definitely has areas that you may want to stay away from, but really anywhere that you would be visiting you would have nothing to worry about. I doubt Joy & Livernois is on your list of places to see. I can almost guarantee that the areas that you were in 10 years ago are better now than they were then."

Detroit,3amnj5,kay_bizzle,2,Sun Jun 21 19:39:50 2015 UTC,No because they specialize in getting over in people.  If you do want to pawn it tell them it's a sale not a pawn and you might get more.  If you're on the west side American jewelry and loan isn't that bad.  I'd try Craigslist or offer up first though.

As much as she is that, I'm not sure that's a Monica problem as much as it's an issue with the people who refuse to see the city in any other light. For instance, this is a lawsuit that she brought on her own, that didn't take place in Detroit and has nothing to do with the city but people still care. And people who are willing to only see Detroit through the lense of Monica Conyers aren't people whose opinions about the city should matter."

Point being she's an absolute piece of trash, and the exact type of garbage that has cast Detroit in a negative light for decades. Every time that stupid fat cunt is in the news; it's a reminder of all the corruption, thievery, and entitlement we've been plagued with for years.

Detroit,3aj0am,eliindet,4,Sat Jun 20 17:39:55 2015 UTC,"Though technically I don't get my degree until August, I completed my degree requirements for my MBA there this past May.  I went on a similar path that it looks like you're going on. I live in Farmington Hills, so I thought that would be the best way to go about it.   Overall I thought that the experience was rewarding. I am personally at this moment looking in to internships and such, but not counting what the future might bring, I thought the classes were for the most part good and the professors knowledgeable and reasonable. Of course there are always exceptions, but those mostly came with some of elective courses that I took and just did not find some of the professors that enlightening.  I honestly did not look in to weekend classes. I didn't even notice them to be honest. My goal was to take as many courses online as possible, and any classes that I was unable to take online I wanted to take at the Farmington extension. However, it did not always work out that way. It was unavoidable for me to take a class at some point on the main campus in Detroit, in fact two. So be prepared for that. Not all classes are offered at the Farmington extension no matter what a counselor says, and you will not be able to fill in the blanks of the ones that you can't take in Farmington online. But I generally ended up with Monday or Tuesday classes once a week from 6 pm to 8:45 pm. Perhaps the occasional exam on a Saturday, but that was just for one class.  For the online courses, most use a go between for exams, ProctorU as a go between. You're required to have a webcam that can be moveable so that they can see the surrounding environment. You within a given time schedule to take your exam. If you don't do it within so many days before the exam you'll be charged a few dollars to make the ""appointment"" and if you are forced to change your date during the schedule period you'll also be charged. So be aware of that, especially depending on your internet connection and weather. Personally I find the system rather stupid as I don't like these type of systems, especially when to be honest it is easy to cheat if you really wanted to, but it is what it is.  Recently, as in the past semester, there has been a change that might help you depending on how quickly you want to complete your degree. This past semester which I was a part of, they started testing 4 week classes. It was a very limited experiment in which the normal 8 week classes were condensed in to a shorter but more in-depth class. They must have considered the experiment a success because there was an email that went out the other day stating that the 4 week classes would be offered for a greatly expanded curriculum as an option opposed to the normal 8 week come this fall. So that might be something that you'd be interested in. I was doing it with an online course so those should be available.  So yeah, overall I thought that the experience was good. Just make sure to talk to a counselor to ensure that you know exactly what you need to take, since several classes need to be taken before you can take others. It just helps you to plan appropriately. They are very nice. I believe that they are available at the Farmington extension on Thursdays, but are available by phone and in Detroit almost all of the time. Another piece of advice is to not overload your schedule. Even if you end up taking all online courses, a little at times can go a long ways. You'd be shocked how quickly you can be backed up if you take too many courses at once.   And as I said before, be prepared at some point to have to take a class at the main campus in Detroit. I found it unavoidable. From Farmington you can get there in 30 minutes, but on heavy traffic days be prepared for an hours drive. And while it is a busy area generally when classes start at 6 pm, the area is going to seem abandoned by the time class gets out close to 9 pm.  If there is anything I can help you with just let me know, I'm happy to help with anything that I can."

Took a lot of organizational behaviour classes which we great.  Lots of diversity in classes which was different from CMU.  Just be careful downtown, got my car stolen on campus on a Sunday working on a group project.  Teachers were great though, most had real jobs and could relate.

Have you been in any of the building BEFORE they were renovated? I have,  and they were falling apart.  I'm pretty sure I know exactly what building you are talking about,  and chances are they had to chip out the parts that were no longer properly attached to make sure shit doesn't fall on people.

That site was chosen specifically because it's right next to the courthouse, DPD headquarters, buildings hosting lawyers and bail bondsmen as tenants, etc.   Building jails in downtown areas is smart city planning, and almost all other cities in the United States stay in line with that principle. Expanding the Mound facility instead of continuing with the current jail project would almost certainly end up dwarfing the cost of just getting the damn thing done as it stands today.

Detroit,3aam17,stevestgermain,13,Fri Jun 19 00:19:51 2015 UTC,"Fun-fact: ""Baphomet"" is a medieval French corruption of the name ""Mohammed"". Medieval Christians believed that Muslims idolized and worshiped Mohammed as a god. The first recorded usage was during an inquisition of the Knights Templar where the Knights were accused of worshiping ""Baphomet"" and tortured into providing confessions for their alleged crimes.  Flash forward to today, and the issue still lives on, in a sense. Saudi Arabia is governed by a strict Wahhabi version of Islam that goes to great pains to ensure no idolatry of Mohammed takes place. At Mecca, Saudi Arabia has allowed the destruction of most of the historic structures, and they plan to destroy the home where Mohammed was born because they hate that people visit these sites with reverence."
Detroit,3aam17,Farwater,5,Thu Jun 18 17:31:30 2015 UTC,"Adding on to that: Medeval Christians also did not distinguish between Jews and Muslims. In much of the literature, especially English cycle plays, Mohammad/Baphomet/Momad etc. are depicted as driving the spear into Jesus' side during the crucifixion."

Idk if I'm agnostic, atheist, secular, or whatever. I don't believe in any religion or spiritual stuff at all. This seems like a blatant troll attempt. If you actually wanted to educate someone who's only been exposed to religion you'd ideally not want to present yourself as group worshiping literally the worst thing in the world to that person. It's fucking stupid. And how much money do they spend on the Satanic temple? What about the statue? I'm thinking those funds could be put to much better use if they weren't some fucking weirdos. I think separation of church and state is of utmost importance, and I think this is one of the most idiotic ways to go about it."
Detroit,3aam17,ecib,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:40:45 2015 UTC,"It really isn't complicated even a little bit. They're activists protecting the separation of church and state, so they're using a ridiculous over the top statue of a god nobody worships in order to combat the actual transgressions Christians (with their god that actually a shitload of people worship) make when they erect their statues on public spaces with the blessing of local governments.    The activists rightly know that they aren't actually turning people on to Satan. It's a completely absurd and over the top ridiculous statue they're putting up. Almost comical. The only people it's going to offend are the ones supporting Christian statues on public lawns. If Christians don't want the Devil hosted on public property, they can respect the separation of church and state like everybody else. The goal is obviously and pragmatically to have no specific religious endorsement on public property like the 10 Commandments. It's actually a tremendously pragmatic and effective strategy."

And they're making a lot of money doing it. Make sure you get your $75 VIP tickets to the statue unveiling!!You're just wrong. This is the worst way to educate people that have been stuck in religion's grasps.   It's been effective in what way? What have they done to help change minds about climate change? Same sex marriage? Abortion? You know, issues that religious people typically control on a political level.  These people don't do shit and have too much free time.

Ubers, Lyfts, and taxis are also available at anytime to take you from place to place.  I also recommend taking some time to hit some of the surrounding cities such as Royal Oak, Dearborn, Hamtramck Ferndale, and Birmingham to truly experience the area.  But there are some Detroit musts that include; the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Detroit Historical Museum, a visit to Belle Isle, Saturday morning at the Eastern Market, and a coney at Lafayette Coney Island (even as a Detroiter I realize it's only a hot dog covered in meat paste but if you are traveling all this way you might as well do it).

You can eat at Slows BBQ while admiring the station's decayed beauty.   Really though you should get a set of wheels if you want to travel outside the bounds.

Just take a drive around the city and you will see plenty.  Oh and since you got me thinking, head out to Mexican town (or the southwest) for BBQ chicken at Taqueria El Rey, desserts at the Mexican town bakery. Also, if you're interested in seeing something that hasn't fallen apart yet check out the Guardian Building.  And lastly, for a great gift or keepsake check out Pewabic Pottery (a long standing Detroit establishment and worth a visit)."
Detroit,3addoi,johnrgrace,-3,Mon Jun 22 18:55:01 2015 UTC,"I'll be completely honest, as somebody who grew up in Detroit (~20 years) I would not necessarily recommend this. I have since moved across the state to Grand Rapids, MI and have no intentions of moving back. My immediate family is all still there so I do enjoy visiting, but that's about it. As far as your honeymoon, if possible I recommend renting a car possibly or getting train tickets to see other areas of Michigan/Midwest. Lake Michigan is a must, and Grand Rapids is a much more vibrant, fun, exciting, and most importantly safe city and it's only about 2.5 hours driving from Detroit. From there, Lake Michigan (in my opinion as nice as any ocean or beach in the world) is just 30 minutes from downtown GR. Also, GR is only a 3 hour drive to Chicago (4-5 hours from Detroit). I think Detroit is worth the look, but to take an entire trip there, I think you may be disappointed in the lack of things to do and explore. Chicago is tremendously better for that sort of thing, and it's my favorite City, way above Detroit. What you have to understand about Detroit is that ever since its economic collapse, the area has sprawled and ""Detroit"" doesn't just refer to the municipality. It is an entire Metropolitan area that spreads as far as 40 miles each way. ""Metro Detroit"" is nearly 5 million people, the city of is only about 750,000, so that explains the strange dichotomy. Not trying to be a downer, but just trying to give you an honest opinion and other options other than Detroit. If I were to plan a trip to the Midwest, or Michigan in particular, I'm not even sure if it would include Detroit, besides for sporting events. The rest of the state is absolutely beautiful and has tons to explore. Congrats on your marriage and hope you have a wonderful honeymoon!   EDIT: As far as safety, Detroit can be very sketchy, very quickly. I personally don't feel unsafe, but that is also because I know of the specific areas you don't want to be in. Just ask somebody at the hotel or around the downtown area what places NOT to go and where you need to avoid. Best of luck!"
Detroit,3a9x1i,akfoley,21,Thu Jun 18 11:42:03 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you are looking for. Dearborn is great and has some excellent restaurants and bars but RO, Ferndale, Downtown, and Midtown are full of young professionals who are looking for more of an urban environment. That's strictly my opinion but I'd be more likely to move to Dearborn when I have a family, whereas I'd like to have more of a ""city"" life while I'm still in my 20s."
Detroit,3a9x1i,just_a_spoonful,14,Thu Jun 18 11:47:34 2015 UTC,"Dearborn feels less walkable to me than say RO, Ferndale, Midtown or Downtown. Whether or not that's the reality, Walkscore.com seems to agree with me.  Being in RO or Ferndale gives you easy access to one another (and B'ham) if that's the social scene you're into, while Midtown and Downtown are obviously close to one another. My impression of Dearborn is that there's not so much nearby (unless you head to Detroit).  I was never especially impressed with the housing stock when I looked, either. I could stomach living in Dearborn if I either had a great old house (like you find in Detroit) or plenty of space to stretch out (say, Livonia), or just offering no downtown in particular but close to everything else (Southfield) but it seems to be in a position of being perfectly adequate at most things but not excelling in any particular area.  The one area I'd be excited to live in Dearborn for would be the middle eastern food (not just damning with faint praise), but that's quite some way down the list of priorities.  All of the above may be completely factually incorrect, but it's my impression. Am I wrong?"
Detroit,3a9x1i,Hitz365,4,Thu Jun 18 11:59:55 2015 UTC,"My house was built in 1900, has a large yard (by city standards) and is walking distance from downtown West Dearborn. I agree with most of your points, I just got really lucky."
Detroit,3a9x1i,ohstille,4,Thu Jun 18 12:24:21 2015 UTC,"On closer inspection, there do appear to be some great houses in the historic districts, so I concede that point. I guess it's mostly about location for me, then."
Detroit,3a9x1i,Hitz365,6,Thu Jun 18 12:46:27 2015 UTC,"See and to me, location is where Dearborn shines. I get the benefits of safe suburbia (Dearborn PD is on the ball), quick access to the city (not Ferndale quick but I can make it downtown in less than 20 min) and an easy drive to Ann Arbor."
Detroit,3a9x1i,ohstille,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:54:06 2015 UTC,"Dearborn actually has two Downtown districts.   Agree with most of your points, though. I grew up in Dearborn but live now in Southwest Detroit."

Honestly for me it's that Dearborn typifies a lot of the urban sprawl that's plagued SE Michigan for a long time. Ferndale and Royal Oak do as well, I suppose, but they mitigate it by being largely residential cities with distinct downtown business districts. If you'd like Warren, Dearborn is pretty similar, barring the ""downtown"" stripmall clusters and ford rd."

I'd rather live closer to work and have a short daily commute.  I'm not going out to restaurants, bars, and shops every night so it doesn't matter how close I live to it.  And when I DO go, it's not during rush hour.  I just got a new job closer to home that shaves off 45 minutes off of the time I spend in my car every day.  That's 15 hours of my life I get back per month."

I'm in West Dearborn and I love my neighborhood, neighbors and community. I enjoy Ferndale and Royal Oak and they are a short drive away from me. Yes, the downtown district(s) pale in comparison to Ferndale and Royal Oak. Like /u/just_a_spoonfull says, walkability wise the downtown just isn't, but the neighborhoods are."
Detroit,3a9x1i,UglyPineapple,4,Thu Jun 18 13:12:36 2015 UTC,"For me, being an eastsider, Dearborn is too damn far from everything. So that's why I live in RO, it can get to anywhere in Metro-Det relatively quickly."
Detroit,3a9x1i,dennisoa,4,Thu Jun 18 13:46:24 2015 UTC,"I like Dearborn. It's a pretty quiet town and has a really good selection of restaurants. It's nice living here and I think it's a great place to raise a family. Also if you like Lebanese food and hookah lounges this is THE place for that (although the hookah lounges are kind of hawked out nowadays). I imagine you're referring to West Dearborn so I'm going to be talking about that.  If you're a young person who enjoys night life and such, I don't think it'd be that great. Like other people have said, it's not a very walkable city. The only part that's really walkable is the area is the area near Michigan and Military street, it's got a few nice bars and restaurants but that's really it.  If you're looking to East Dearborn you'd really need to consider what it is you want. There's a very high population of Arab-Americans in East Dearborn, and as a Lebanese person who's white, they're (mostly the older folk) not very welcoming. If I go to a Lebanese bakery in East Dearborn (Golden or New Yasmine are my favorites!) and there's an older gentleman working the register, I'll usually have to speak a little Arabic for him to be a bit more welcoming.  Also, East Dearborn is not walkable really at all, and the schools are kinda meh. I wouldn't really recommend the East Side, it's not as well off as the West. I'm not trashing the East, it's got its own merits to it (all sorts of Mediterranean restaurants and shops)   All this being said, I love my city but god it's really boring (I'm only 20 though so give me one more year and then I'll see if it's really as boring as I've always thought it to be). You'll never find a mix of cultures like there is here. But I don't feel like its a city that really caters to younger people."
Detroit,3a9x1i,Bill_Butt_Licker,2,Thu Jun 18 18:52:42 2015 UTC,"I enjoy living in Dearborn.  Tons of restaurants and bars.  I admit it's not as ""hip"" as the listed places, but you're still really close to Downtown/Midtown.  Downtown Dearborn got a little depressing over the past few years, a lot of business/restaurants went under, and there were quite a few empty buildings.  However this past year things have been popping up and it looks like things are on the upswing."
Detroit,3a9x1i,unibrow4o9,2,Thu Jun 18 16:01:17 2015 UTC,"I like Dearborn a lot. I've only just moved to the west end of Dearborn this year from a very similar neighborhood in Cleveland. To give you an idea of the similarities, If you were to close your eyes in my old neighborhood, drive two hours to Dearborn and open them you wouldn't have noticed you've left... With that said the one difference that I have noticed is the activity of the people in the neighborhoods. So many people are always out and about. My corner of the neighborhood has at least 4 houses of families that are routinely out drinking beer and mingling while the kids play. I chose Dearborn For proximity to my place of work. For a family man in his late 20s with 3 kids and a decent income, Dearborn has been great. Maybe I've just been lucky to fine my little corner of the city though."
Detroit,3a9x1i,dlawso03,2,Thu Jun 18 23:17:09 2015 UTC,I live there and love it. There's legitimately nothing wrong with Dearborn besides the mall maybe. People are either racist or just mean. They make it bad for themselves. Its a wonderful place and never let anyone tell you otherwise.
Detroit,3a9x1i,hayategekko,3,Fri Jun 19 02:54:14 2015 UTC,"I don't have any data for this, but Downtown/Midtown/RO/Ferndale have a lot of rentals - I can only think of a few apartment complexes in Dearborn and they're all in the Ford Rd/Mercury Dr big box boring zone. I wouldn't recommend Dearborn unless they wanted to purchase a house.  Not only is Dearborn lacking in nightlife, it's not really close to nightlife either: downriver/industrial areas to the south, Dearborn Heights/Inkster/Garden City to the west. Warrendale is a nice neighborhood but not much going on there either. Your best bet is really SW Detroit, but it's not really a pleasant trip to get there.  I would totally live in the east or west Dearborn downtown areas if I could reliably catch a bus or train to downtown Ann Arbor and downtown Detroit."

Hell, one of the last classic drive-in movie theatres is in town. But compared to RO, Rochester, Birmingham, Ferndale, Northville, Plymouth, Ann Arbor, Dearborn is outclassed. The bars are lacking, restaurants are lacking, fewer young professionals out and about on the weekends. No lakes either so if you're into boating or that sort of thing, we can't help you either. Taxes are fairly high in Dearborn as well but I can't say that I have many complaints about the public services on offer. Schools are league average or better."

It takes into things like pedestrian-friendly sidewalks with crossings in convenient places, public spaces (small parks, squares), traffic control and some kind of center within walking distance of homes.

Detroit,3aboff,yourfriendiscute,2,Fri Jun 19 04:13:22 2015 UTC,"Perhaps I should have said 'Southeast Michigan', rather than 'Dearborn'. I made an extrapolation there, and perhaps it's not correct. (You're not providing hard data either, though.)  The Arab American Institute says:   ""...the breakdown of religious affiliation among persons originating from Arab countries is... 63% Christian, 24% Muslim, 13% other""   There are plenty of sources- local and national- that address the number of Arabs and Arab-Americans in southeast Michigan and the USA, as well as the religions they claim. Because the US Census Bureau doesn't consider Arabs as a separate group for demographic purposes, the exact numbers in any two articles rarely match, but the majority of sources at least agree that more than 50% of Arabs in America are Christian (including Catholics and Chaldeans). A few sources say it's a 50-50 split between Christian and Muslim. I was unaware that Arab Christians tend to be less visible as a community, and some communities don't even identify as Arab; those could both definitely contribute to seeing more mosques than churches when out driving around Dearborn.  My point was that this pastor guy is targeting Dearborn to ""save their souls"". He could have just as easily chosen another Arab community in the metro (Dearborn Heights, Sterling Heights, Hamtramck, apparently even the Grosse Pointes) and targeted them without realizing there are an enormous number of Christians among the people he's trying to convert."

A vacant lot next to other vacant lots is useless. A vacant lot next to a park is a development opportunity."

You have developments like the GAR that have recently come online and you can only expect more nearby as  the arena district grows. If anything, DTE is showing foresight in creating this space. And the space will be maintained by DTE so in how will it add to the ""abandonment and decay"" the city?  Further ""Public spaces in Detroit must be in an area where pedestrians are the norm..For a public space to be successful, the area that surrounds the space must be used by different people at different points in the day"". It's interesting that you have a picture of Campus Martius because by that standard it should have never been built. Even in the middle of the day that area was a deadzone. I will say Campus Martius had more to work with in the surrounding area, but I think there is too little credit given to what a quality public space can do to revive an area."

Detroit,3a20fv,Khorasaurus,2,Wed Jun 17 14:11:05 2015 UTC,"Can Detroit do public spaces well?  In many large American cities, nearly every public urban space that offers ""Benches, movable chairs, tables, concrete slabs, and patches of fresh healthy grass"" becomes a homeless junkie magnet unless it's pretty heavily policed.  Not that homeless folks don't have the same rights to the parks as everyone else, but it doesn't take too many folks reeking and shouting at themselves or nodding off with a needle in their arm to make residents decide that maybe it's best to let private enterprise and private security run things, so they can keep things clean and safe.  E.g. here's a video a redditor took outside the L.A. Public Library, showing why it's sometimes hard to have nice public spaces in a downtown area.  If Detroit's got a better ability to control that, then more public spaces would be amazing and make the city more liveable."

Detroit,3a3ixz,ehansen,5,Tue Jun 16 23:06:02 2015 UTC,"New Center area is pretty damn safe. You've got the DPD HQ right around the corner, Wayne state police patrolling the southern areas, and all around a lot of government and cultural buildings really close by.   The times when race matters the most in Detroit is when you get young people moving into the city and claiming it as ""their city"" and ""a blank slate"" because they don't understand that the city has a history and a culture that people are welcome to be a part of, but can't unilaterally change (see this article for an analysis/explanation of that sentiment ). If you move in like you own the block it will probably make your neighbors mad so try to avoid that.   New center especially has seen a lot of incentive programs, mostly from Wayne State, to get its employees to move down there so you probably won't feel out of place regardless of what race you are."

I've never been in the area but there's some interesting prospects there that make me want to visit it.  Is it true the area I mentioned is also closed to the Henry Ford Hospital?  I wouldn't dare walk into a city and act like its mine, but I totally understand where you are coming from as well.  But overall it seems like it would be a good place to visit and explore a bit more of."

Detroit,3a3ixz,Khorasaurus,3,Wed Jun 17 00:47:26 2015 UTC,"You just keep digging further. Why does looking like a ""wuss"" inherently give you ""less luck""? You seem to be implying that black people attack you if you're white and ""look like a wuss"". If you can't see the racism built in to your assumptions and statements, you need to take a step back and look at what you're saying."
Detroit,3a3ixz,redhotbellpepper,3,Wed Jun 17 13:39:32 2015 UTC,"Couldn't this be attributed to fear of the unknown? I see what you're saying, and this question could have been asked without mentioning race. But I think it's kind of unfair to label these assumptions and statements as racism-infused. They're a bit ignorant, definitely. But calling them racist seems unfair because I know people who are racist, who don't want to explore the city, and have no interest in the city or its citizens well being.  I'm sure if the poster follows through with their intent to explore, they'll be exposed to the diverse city and any fears will begin to dissipate. I guess this doesn't really matter, I just feel like people are quick to label others as racist, sexist, feminist, misogynist, etc. based on very little information when sometimes it's as simple as someone being ignorant on a topic - not purposefully spewing words with intent to harm.   I tend to think of racism as a behavior that most people take to the grave, whereas wondering about one's own safety in a foreign area that statistically has the highest murder rate of all cities with a population greater than 250,000 is a fairly natural question. And as much as it sucks, race still plays a (decreasing, albeit however slowly) role in society. But the fact it does makes it plausible this question could be asked without racist intent yet still mention race. (imo)"

Detroit,39wtzt,LeftDetroitThrowAway,30,Mon Jun 15 13:21:51 2015 UTC,"Bravo. Ahead of schedule, under budget, and in my opinion the new lights look great.  I also like that they started in the neighborhoods and are doing downtown and the thoroughfares last. It shows the residents that they were the first priority, not commuters or visitors or big business."
Detroit,39wtzt,Khorasaurus,-8,Mon Jun 15 14:33:28 2015 UTC,"All well and good, unless you live in a historic neighborhood and just saw your historic and decorative metal light poles with underground wiring replaced with crooked wooden poles, and your 60 year old tree chopped so wiring could be strung through the air.  I'd prefer my street had stayed dark.  Edit:  I guess most people just want light, of any kind; history and aesthetics be damned.  Might as well tear down the train station while we are at it.  It may seem strange to complain about getting lights in my street after it being dark for a decade, but I swear these wooden poles and leds are ugly as shit, now there are wires going everywhere overhead, and the company installing these are fucking up and even completely removing beautiful mature trees where I live.   at least give us STRAIGHT pokes and install them plumb.  Half the ones going in are twisted as shit and leaning to one side or another.  Just because we need and deserve light, and are on an extremely lean budget doesn't mean we have to completely compromise on workmanship at least.  if the city is ahead of schedule it's likely due to the hastiness and sloppiness of the crews racing to install these cheap goddamn things.  Edit 2: fuck you all, downvoters.  Eat a dick."
Detroit,39wtzt,Norfolkpine,3,Mon Jun 15 17:02:03 2015 UTC,"Detroit Public Lighting system is a constant current variable voltage system. The more load added increases the voltage. The method of power distribution is one of the first implemented and extremely dangerous to work on. I doubt there is one still in operation. Compounding the problem is Detroits financial situation. PLD hasn't had the money to pay their employees, at times, let alone do regular maintenance to a system over 100 years old. In my experience, their employees were overworked and apathetic.  In fact, DTE was forced to absorb PLD because they are a state regulated monopoly. Most of PLDs customers, such as schools, were already transfered to DTE because of the neglected system.  When PLD installed the underground lights, Detroit was the front of the industrial revolution. We had the money to do that. Now, installing anything similar would be financually irresponsible."

Detroit,39x3w9,primesuspect,7,Mon Jun 15 14:46:52 2015 UTC,"DD is up front about its self-assigned prep rally role. ""Pushing Detroit Forward"" is the slogan on its site and social media feeds.  It claims, presumably from traffic data, to have an ""engaged, passionate . . . community of more than 500,000 Detroiters and Detroiters at heart . . .  across the nation in all 50 states.""  Readership is defined this way at its Advertise page:   We’re the next generation of online publication in Detroit for the Detroiter that’s engaged, active and wanting to make a difference and be informed about their community. . . .  We call sources. We are feet on the ground, and get the rest of the story. We tell the Detroit story like no other publication because it’s by Detroiters who are engaged in their city and region.   Noble goals as this next gen publication continues learning how to deliver ""the rest of the story.""   For now, they're correct that it's ""like no other publication."""

Detroit,39x3w9,Norfolkpine,8,Mon Jun 15 23:13:24 2015 UTC,"Pretty much agree with the deconstruction of that shit-show of an article from Daily Detroit. That was the farthest thing from journalism. More like a diary entry from DD in blog format.   When we pushed for answers about why the protestors behaved as such, we were told basically that it was because we weren’t the right color. We were told the protesters didn’t know who the players were.   This was probably the most eggregious part of the article for me. Where the protesters told you they weren't cooperating because they didn't know what org you were with, and you reported that as them saying it's because you are white. The hedge word ""basically"" doesn't even begin to close this gap. This isn't journalism. This is a blogger blogging about his feels.    In the heat of the moment, things can spiral out of control very fast. We must only look to the national news as of late to know this. It was fortunate that this was a minor incident, but it’s clear that racial tension runs high for some groups within the community.   Literally the sole party to introduce any racial element into this story was the blogger. While it may have been present, the blogger certainly didn't report on it and didn't illuminate it for us.   Also, way to conflate someone getting in the way of your taking ""quality pictures"" with the possibility that you were on the brink of being assaulted or worse in an explosive eruption of protester violence making national headlines. You are on the front fucking line there no doubt there needs to be some sort of patch or bravery medal for the work you did. You are correct in reporting your good fortune in escaping with only this 'minor incident'.  Could have been a very bloody scene. SMH.   we will continue to cover events in order to foster the important conversation about racial inclusion and fairness   That...is funny. Maybe start by doing some actual reporting and not twisting the words of the people you're reporting on blogging about. If you couldn't get the quote, don't make one up. You aren't fostering shit. In fact, you're doing the opposite of fostering. Maybe the word you're looking for is 'festering'?  Two articles in a row from Foley I've more or less liked wtf is happening."
Detroit,39x3w9,ecib,0,Mon Jun 15 15:42:06 2015 UTC,"I'll agree their journalistic integrity might be lacking ever so slightly. But they and the Detroit Metro Times were the only ones to cover this issue. Doesn't look like anyone in the Metro Area bothered to pick it up. They spun it to fit their readers, just like the FreePress or Det News did, same with what Foley did in his piece. Doesn't justify it, but tends to fall in line with modern journalists anyway."
Detroit,39x3w9,MGoAzul,5,Mon Jun 15 16:55:40 2015 UTC,"But they and the Detroit Metro Times were the only ones to cover this issue.   I don't think DD covered it. I think their post was about them. Foley was critical along all the right axis on this. DD was complaining mightily about subjects not giving them quotes, 'blocking journalism', and so on, while simultaneously not acting remotely like journalists. DD injected opinion, made the story about themselves, didn't even bother to attempt talking to both parties at the scene, and with no substantiation whatsoever characterized the subjects they were covering in an extremely incendiary way.    I'll agree their journalistic integrity might be lacking ever so slightly.   I'm honestly trying to find any at all here. There is a difference between engaging in journalism and just writing opinion based commentary with an agenda. Being a modern or old-school journalist isn't the issue to me here. I've seen civilians on Twitter with no journalistic pretensions giving play-by-plays do better than this.   They spun it to fit their readers, just like the FreePress or Det News did, same with what Foley did in his piece.   I think there is a difference between DD calling themselves journalists and publishing what they did and Foley methodically critiquing that.  Really. And Lord knows I've been critical of Foley for spinning things to fit his own narrative in the past. Of of the two articles here, only one is engaging in serious spin, and it sure isn't Foley's."
Detroit,39x3w9,ecib,8,Mon Jun 15 17:43:24 2015 UTC,"Daily Detroit only covered it because they read about it in MT. WXYZ was there, but they didn't air anything about it to my knowledge.   Covering a protest is one thing. Covering what's actually going on with the Tangerine Room/Atwater situation is another, and not the kind of thing that can be readily explained in a scenario like this. I suspect that other outlets are digging deeper to find out what's going on.   It's hella irresponsible to throw a story out there about a protest involving what's basically a tenant-landord dispute when we don't have comment from either the tenant or the landlord. (Hence why WXYZ probably backed out.) We don't even have one side of the story, since the tenant in this case doesn't seem to be fully informed of his own situation either. Otherwise, you've just got a story about some angry people outside a bar, and no one quite knows why they're there. Easy for a place DD to spin around a million times. Not so much for a place like WXYZ who has to frame a story for viewers to understand and preserve their credibility.  Then again, you can't really make an informed decision about what's going on here since the only story about it is flimsy at best."

Anyway, sorry for my stupid ""joke"". You have a very fair summary of their article - I almost think they should hire you for these kinds of articles/blog posts. I can definitely see why you and everyone else is and should be annoyed at what they posted. It was incomplete, unnecessarily mentions race, and it'll probably piss off the people that were protesting (which is too bad). They deserve to have their side fairly articulated without their race being a focal point.   Looking forward to your book!

One thing to consider as far as purchasing things, is that you need to declare them at customs, and depending what it is it could cause you delays at the border. I like to buy alcohol at the Duty Free, they have some great deals and some Canada-exclusive stuff (e.g., I got a special version of Crown Royal). Duty Free is only applicable if you're staying for at least 24 hours though, and you're only supposed to bring back 1L of liquor per person (there are other restrictions as well), as I learned the last time through. They're usually not too strict about it if you go a bit over (which is why I didn't realize the limits).  We went to a fairly new brewery called Craft Heads that was pretty good.   The CC distillery could be fun, if you're into whiskey.   I'd definitely take a walk down their riverfront park, it's quite extensive and pretty nice.   The Loose Goose was a nice bar and they're supposed to have good wings. They have something like 20 sauces and 20 dry rubs, plus you can combine them (and they have some suggested combinations). We didn't eat when I was there, though.   If you like Italian food, there is a ""Little Italy"" in Windsor. With Detroit's lack of good Italian food, might be worth a stop in."

On top of that, I would also check out Lefty's for some poutine.  If you're into gambling, Caesar's Windsor doesn't tax your winnings. I know a lot of Americans come for that reason.  Lastly, a little hidden gem in Windsor is Sandwich Towne. It's a street on the West Side that has a bunch of nice pubs and bars, and they serve a extensive amount of craft beers. I recommend Rock Bottoms.  I recommend that you just drive around and find your own adventures, as Windsor has a lot of its own hidden gems. Enjoy yourself here, and feel free to PM me any questions! :)"

Detroit,39ww5d,spetstnelis,2,Mon Jun 15 13:42:05 2015 UTC,"I've always watched fireworks from somewhere else along the riverfront (usually upstream), never from Hart Plaza. If you're dead-set on Hart Plaza, get there EARLY or be prepared for a long hike (or both), and expect to be packed in with a third of the city's population. Pretty much everywhere along the river will have a perfectly good view of the show, as long as you didn't position yourself with a building in the way. No matter where you watch from, count on some of the worst traffic you've ever seen following the show- the sheer number of people packed into one place, combined with how many roads they shut down, makes for some truly unworkable post-show traffic jams.   Belle Isle, from what I understand, gets tons of people, but it's so big that it can easily handle the crowd; the difficulty comes when that entire crowd tries to leave the island all at the same time via the single bridge.   Windsor gets plenty of people watching, but not nearly what the Detroit side hosts. If you are looking for the best spot with the fewest people, you might consider going to Windsor and heading a half-mile upstream or downstream from downtown; their riverwalk extends a decent ways but it gets pretty quiet at night away from the downtown area and casino.  Hopefully people that have actually watched from Belle Isle or Windsor can chime in with better info; mine is secondhand."
Detroit,39ww5d,ornryactor,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:10:20 2015 UTC,Thanks for the detailed reply! I've also asked around work and it sounds like there is a lot of activity going around parking garage roofs with a view of the fireworks as well. Obviously not a close up view but I imagine traffic would be a little less unbearable.
Detroit,39ww5d,mattchew1993,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:53:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Windsor is probably the best place to watch them since you get the skyline in the background.

You are merely pointing out an incidental relationship, hence why I mentioned atheism (USSR) and vegetarianism (Hitler).    Does democracy automatically lead to dropping nuclear bombs?  Does capitalism necessarily lead to slavery?  I hardly think so."

Of course I can, when the death toll is the realistic outcome of the idea in question. When the idea is ""Let's restructure our society so that the means of production are commonly owned and operated,"" then yes, looking at the outcomes of that restructuring process throughout history is absolutely appropriate.  You'd be hard-pressed to find many examples of large-scale collectivization not creating widespread human misery, even among the people whom it's intended to help."
Detroit,39syze,Aiede,2,Tue Jun 16 00:47:28 2015 UTC,"So what?  You'd be hard-pressed to find examples of any large-scale socio-economic restructuring that never created widespread human misery.  Our society has benefited greatly from socialism.  The 8 hour work day.  Sick pay.  Social security.  End of child labor.  The right to organize.  Publicly funded education, libraries, transportation, parks, infrastructure.  Anyone that considers themselves a Detroiter should be especially proud of these accomplishments.  But suggesting your laser focus on the history of communism in Europe and Asia during the early part of last century as the ultimate outcome of any socialist movement is misleading and biased without acknowledging atrocities committed around the globe in the name of combating it's spread.  Can you honestly look at Vietnam today and say that it was worth killing untold millions attempting to stop the 'red tide'?  Was it worth supporting the Contras?  Pinochet?  The Shah?  Was it worth firebombing MOVE?  Mass murder is simply not unique to socialists.  As you inadvertently suggested, the way ideas are implemented is the key to avoiding such atrocities.  Did democracy flourishing in France lead to massacres and injustices?  Yes.  Is democracy a bad thing?  I don't think so.  Have any recent elections of socialist governments in European countries lead to modern day genocides?  No.  So it can be done peacefully, without violence, without an appeal to our baser selves.  It's the demagogues throughout history that have caused people to fight with their neighbors rather than solve disputes through dialogue and diplomacy.  The modern democratic socialist movements of the world have about as much to do with Pol Pot as today's Democrats have to do with slavery."

Detroit,39t4xz,HipsterGalt,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:01:23 2015 UTC,"It depends on the specific intersection, but there is a city traffic engineering division which controls signal timing on city roads. I suggest opening a ticket on SeeClickFix if you're having a specific issue. I, too, noticed the abnormally long red/green at the Woodward/CM intersection. It doesn't really seem to be much of a problem. People are simply avoiding Woodward in the morning (and now you don't really have a choice, as Woodward is blocked off at Campus Martius entirely).   The Mack light off its 375 exit always leads to a huge build up of cars on Saturday mornings leading to Eastern Market. This is a dangerous situation.   I'm not sure this is a street light timing issue. Anytime you get an event with a large amount of people driving in from the suburbs, the nearest exits get backed up.

I'll have to catch up on it to see the episodes he's in. I love that they're doing location shooting and able to show off Detroit a bit. My hopes are high - Comedy Central has been on a pretty good roll lately for original shows (Broad City, Key and Peele, Inside Amy Schumer, etc.)  EDIT: Now that I think about it, I remember Richardson was in that Second City show too. There was a hilarious bit where he was eating chips out of a bag for an entire sketch. Right at the end, out of the blue, he pulled a whole cheeseburger out of the bag. He looked surprised for a second then shrugged and took a bite. Had the whole crowd rolling on the floor."

I ignored it for years because it looked like the same kind of tired faux-""ethnic"" food that Royal Oak and its northern neighbors are chock-full of, but jesus christ on high, Kouzina is incredible. Easily the best gyro I've ever had anywhere at a place not run by actual first-generation Greek immigrants, and also better than a good handful of places that are. Go there. Get the fries.

Detroit,39k3it,ArMcK,3,Fri Jun 12 12:49:23 2015 UTC,This is an interesting system because literally the rest of the states in the nation have affordable car insurance without causing the apocalypse. Cities with similar level of car theft have cheaper insurance than Detroit. It's not like there's no other solution to car insurance in this state. I guess it's just resistance to change.
Detroit,39k3it,kowalski71,3,Fri Jun 12 16:29:46 2015 UTC,"we just have a toxic brew of:   extremely high crime, high poverty jurisdiction (promoting theft and medical fraud) don't provide any reasonable alternatives to private car ownership (promoting driving without insurance, making the above problem even worse) incredibly generous policies (some people like this but I don't see why we can't have policies similar to literally every other state)   hammer away at those factors and the price of insurance will come down."
Detroit,39k3it,delurhparg,3,Fri Jun 12 16:32:18 2015 UTC,"Don't forget that just like the rest of America, insurance companies have perceptions of Detroit that are often far worse than reality, and nobody is correcting them on it. John Public might think Detroit is a lawless postapocalyptic free-for-all, and that sucks, but if MegaSuranceCorp thinks Detroit is a lawless postapocalyptic free-for-all, they can and will charge accordingly, making a bad situation needlessly worse."
Detroit,39k3it,ornryactor,3,Fri Jun 12 16:46:29 2015 UTC,Shouldn't these companies have enough real data to plug in their historical numbers for our zip codes and take a guess about future costs?
Detroit,39k3it,BDCanuck,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:14:57 2015 UTC,"I'm skeptical that this is the case. If MegaSuranceCorp is charging an arm and a leg to insure a Detroit driver, but only needs to collect an arm in order to remain profitable (because of this gap between insurance claims and perception), why doesn't ReptilianAdvertisingCompany come in and undercut their pricing by simply charging an arm?  I'm not generally one to be a free-market fundamentalist like that, but the numbers re: Detroit auto theft, insurance claims, and uninsured rate are so off-the-charts ridiculous that I have no trouble believing the insane rates people pay."
Detroit,39k3it,delurhparg,3,Fri Jun 12 19:29:59 2015 UTC,"That's only part of it:   Outright fraud is another concern. A National Insurance Crime Bureau report found that questionable medical claims in Detroit jumped 124% between 2009 and 2011, and that the city was responsible for one-third of all such claims in the state. Of the 12 states with no-fault insurance, Michigan is the only one without a statewide system for rooting out fraud.   Medical claims typically cost much more than replacing or repairing a vehicle. There's billboard all over the city that basically advertise how to exploit the system."
Detroit,39k3it,LeftDetroitThrowAway,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:10:00 2015 UTC,Should also be added that we don't have bad faith claims against the insurance companies that screw people over like those other states do

I'd appreciate any recommendations."
Detroit,39k3it,practicalize,2,Sat Jun 13 19:47:47 2015 UTC,"the way I do it: 1. Buy a shitty old car on craigslist (for me this is currently a 99 ford taurus for $800) 2. Get PLPD (minimum legal car insurance) 3. Save up another $800 4. In the event of an accident/major breakdown, junk the car and take the $200ish from the junk yard plus savings and grab another craigslist car.  Since I'm inside city limits, The savings on car insurance easily covers the replacement cost of the car, as long as my cars last me say 6 months, (they usually go for a few years)  Edit: Oh my craigslist strategy: search for cars listed in the last 24 hrs that are less than $1000 and for sale by owner. You'll find a lot of people who are moving or whatever and need to get rid of an extra car fast, so they list it cheap in hopes of moving it in the next day or two."

Detroit,39g2pm,LeftDetroitThrowAway,6,Thu Jun 11 14:10:00 2015 UTC,"The 190,000-square-foot store at Grand River Avenue and McNichols Road is advertised as a ""neighborhood store."" This is in contrast to Meijer's first Detroit location at 8 Mile Road and Woodward Avenue.   Somebody is confused. The 8 Mile store is 190,000 (Meijer) or 191,000 (MLive) square feet, meaning it's the same size as this Redford store. If you believe Crain's, the 8 Mile store  is 215,000 square feet, making the Redford store only 13% smaller- hardly enough for Meijer to present it as a smaller, totally different category or approach. Photos of the exterior obviously don't really help answer the question, but the Redford store certainly looks like an identical copy of the 8 Mile store.  Anybody know the answer here? I'm curious which news outlet is being lazy to a fault.  EDIT: Or perhaps they're the same size, and Meijer is referring to Redford as a ""neighborhood store"" because they think only people from the neighborhood will shop there (as opposed to the 'regional destination' of 8 & Woodward), but that seems unlikely on all fronts."
Detroit,39g2pm,ornryactor,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:26:04 2015 UTC,"No, I think that's exactly what it means. The 8 Mile location is right on the border (in a not-very-populated part of the city), not far from the freeway and easily accessible from a bunch of suburbs. It's basically the Meijer for all of Ferndale, southern Royal Oak, southeast Southfield, Oak Park, Hazel Park, and a huge chunk of Detroit.  The new one on Grand River is right in the middle of one of the more stable, densely populated areas of the city proper. It's not as immediately accessible from the freeways, but I would guess that it can still serve a similarly sized population from a generally smaller area (mainly the west side neighborhoods and Redford Twp). I'm sure it's more marketing than anything else, but the ""neighborhood"" distinction makes sense to me."

All of which I'm sure has to do with Meijer and some sort of deal with the city to improve the surrounding neighborhood as well. At least that's what I'd like to think.

I merely meant that putting these Meijer on the border of Detroit doesn't help as much as it could. A centrally located place would be way more beneficial than something on the outskirts of the 142.9sq mile city. We have a city that can fit multiple other cities inside it and they keep putting these groceries stores on the border where they are more useful to the neighboring cities. Who is going to use that Meijer more... Redford residents or people who live in the heart of the city? But of course... everyone just jumped to conclusions and put words in my mouth and assumed I was trying to be a pretentious prick when I was just pointing out a fact. I don't care if you want to say Detroit starts as soon as you cross Telegraph... that's fine and dandy. I just don't look at these as Detroit Meijer when they will be servicing the surrounding city residents much more.  Of course, in this subreddit, instead of trying to have conversation, or someone asking for some sort of clarification of what I may have meant, I was just ridiculed and downvoted. This place can be pretty pathetic sometimes with everyones shitty judgemental attitudes."
Detroit,39g2pm,delurhparg,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:51:27 2015 UTC,"I suspect you were downvoted because your complaint about this popular development is pretty incoherent. There's a point to be made about locating centrally, maybe? but you should have said what you wanted to say.  ""They are hardly in Detroit"" is not actually a 'fact', because it depends on your opinion about how far you have to be inside the border to be 'solidly in Detroit'. My opinion is that if you're south of 8 Mile or west of Telegraph, you're in Detroit. ""They are both right at the border"" relies on another subjective judgment call. Is 1.25 miles ""right at"" the border? I argue that it is not.   Who is going to use that Meijer more... Redford residents or people who live in the heart of the city?   Uh, people who live in the heart of the city, of course. For one, western and southern Redford residents are probably more likely to go to the Meijer off Middlebelt. Secondly, there are a lot more people who live in Detroit than Redford. If you look people whose closest Meijer is the new one off Grand River, far more of them live in Detroit than Redford, that's for sure.   A centrally located place would be way more beneficial than something on the outskirts of the 142.9sq mile city.   Only if you assume that population is distributed uniformly across the city, which it's not. Acre for acre, the northwest side of Detroit is far more populated than the core, where there's a ton of non-residential land use and a number of neighborhoods in the core are depopulated.   This place can be pretty pathetic sometimes with everyones shitty judgemental attitudes.   I completely agree, but lets not pretend your original post wasn't a textbook example of that."

Their vegetables are always gross, there's never anyone to help you if you need it, all of the carts pull to one side, the deli takes a lifetime to wait for unless you go in first thing in the morning... but the worst is how long it takes to get through checkout. If you don't like using the self-checkouts (and I don't) you can expect to wait 20 minutes almost every time.  Go to Kroger, the veggies are good, people around to help if you need it, they have baggers so the cashiers can cruise thru your order... basically everything is better.  I have both right next to me and I understand that mileage may vary, but I've hopped around the area a bit and everytime Kroger kicks Meijer's ass. Well, Costco kicks both their asses but, still. The only thing Meijer has going for it is that I can run up there at any time of the night if I need some stupid thing that I should normally wait for morning to get.... that is nice, but it doesn't outweigh the rest of it."

With their voices raised and eyes wet and glazed they bemoan this ‘great loss’ like it’s Jesus on the cross. They simply cannot see that all stories are History.  Sentiment for old shelves is us trying to save ourselves trying not to be forgotten when our children plant new cotton. New buildings and new dreams replace those old, dry-rotted beams.  These vast empty shells where dust and ghosts dwell do no good for the living and that’s their misgiving. Heart-felt, emotional pleas against hard financial realities.  Stuck in once-upon-a-time, aging starlet past her prime once glorious and new, now forgotten like an old shoe. Better to remember May and forget November.  Turn-of-the-century wonder will soon be torn asunder as its Art Deco charm falls without much alarm. Architecture is divine when the taxes are not mine.  Buildings aren’t meant for the dead, but for those left in their stead to use as long as they’re needed, ‘til the usefulness is exceeded.

It was a hotel, which is by its very nature a building with which most people have transient and not long-term relationships. It wasn't the biggest or best or fanciest or anything like that.   In my opinion, something can be old without being ""historically significant"" and Detroit does not have a lack of old, vacant midrise buildings that have some architecturally interesting features but little meaningful demand for renovation/reuse.   If the stadium hadn't gone in there, it's doubtful that either of those buildings would have gotten renovated. Now, we're losing one and using one in the process, which seems to me like a relatively decent deal."
Detroit,39fpk6,Aiede,2,Thu Jun 11 16:26:44 2015 UTC,I would say it's historically significant for having been such a high quality building designed by Louis Kamper. I think many people don't fully appreciate the architecture because it has a relatively simple facade and because it is in rough shape right now.
Detroit,39fpk6,Farwater,2,Thu Jun 11 17:50:12 2015 UTC,"I think there's a certain circularity to the historic preservation arguments that depend on the fame/""importance"" of the architect. Kamper's a perfect example -- he did a decent number of buildings in and around Detroit including a few relatively well-known structures like the Book Cadillac, Broderick, etc., but at some level using his involvement as a reason to save a building like this can get counterintuitive -- he's important because he did a lot of buildings, but since he did a lot of buildings you're arguably more likely to run into a situation where the evolving needs of the city and its residents would make demolition the rational decision.  It's like saying ""I can't delete the Rolling Stones' 'Steel Wheels' from my iTunes to free up memory, 'Beggars Banquet' and 'Some Girls' were such awesome albums."""
Detroit,39fpk6,Aiede,2,Thu Jun 11 16:03:34 2015 UTC,"I personally don't even think his involvement is needed to justify saving it. I think the building itself is clearly a good enough building to justify saving in its own right. I only mention Louis Kamper because apparently some people can look at a beautiful, 1920's high rise with good bones and lots of potential and think, ""Damn, I can't wait to see that torn down!""  Edit: Basically, I'm grasping at straws trying to convince people who are aggressively wanting to destroy good, historical buildings."

It's even more interesting to me that so many people would rather see this building destroyed for a loading bay or parking lot than see it restored and put to good use again. EDIT: And before you start parroting again, ""but who will step up? No one has,"" I'll repeat: This district is about to get a huge infusion of cash and development. Someone will restore if it's preserved for just a little while longer."
Detroit,39fpk6,gpforlife,3,Thu Jun 11 16:19:57 2015 UTC,"Look man, it ain't your money. I'd say Olympia has been doing a pretty good job of investing its own money and they don't need your help.   This isn't the Parthenon, it's a rotting and crumbling rat's nest that's been that way for years in a city full of them.   Give it up."
Detroit,39fpk6,jimmy_three_shoes,8,Thu Jun 11 16:26:18 2015 UTC,"Just keeping it around ""because it might be useful someday"" is hoarding, especially when multiple attempts have been made to fix them up and occupy them."
Detroit,39fpk6,Farwater,-6,Thu Jun 11 16:30:59 2015 UTC,"A lot will be changing in Cass Corridor very soon. There will be a massive influx of cash and development. This is not the same as holding onto the building with no end in sight. If the building could be secured and preserved for just a little while longer, I guarantee someone would step in and reuse it."
Detroit,39fpk6,skruluce,4,Thu Jun 11 19:24:47 2015 UTC,"Your argument seems to hinge on the development on the corridor, but you're completely ignoring the fact that it's being torn down so that development can proceed. It's not going to be an empty space where a building once was, and the fact that another building in the same situation as this one was preserved means that in all likelihood it's not nearly in a decent enough condition to maintain or renovate. Your argument also hinges on a single big IF. Who's going to secure & preserve the building? How much longer are we going to wait?  Not only that--this decision is already made. The time to even have this discussion has long since passed."
Detroit,39fpk6,asleepawhile,-17,Thu Jun 11 16:31:08 2015 UTC,"You are right and don't let these down voters make you think otherwise. The city gets blinded by Detroit sports. Olympia has held that property for a long time. And it was bought as a historical property. Olympia bought under its historical agreement, let it rot, and then said they had no choice but to raze it after neglecting it for years (while they drew up new stadium plans).   All these comments basically say, ""step aside citizens and reward the rich people for give the rich people for strangling downtown."""

I currently have basic cable and 18 mb internet for about that price. That will expire in a year or so at which point I will call and ask to cancel the TV and they will probably affer me a different promotional...   If you're in the downtown midtown or corktown area you might be able to sign up for rocket fiber soon. But that will likely be out of your price range."

We pay $89 for about 15-20 mbps and cable. Not great, but I don't have complaints about their service. Wow is not in Detroit, if you live in the suburbs they have a few more options."

Then you could walk to Le Petit Zinc  for a simple delicious lunch with awesome fresh ingredients. They also serve cappuccinos in bowls. You're sort of like a cat when you drink them.

Detroit,39gz1q,ecib,5,Fri Jun 12 14:17:00 2015 UTC,"You'll get plenty of replies, but to save you some time, do some searches here on /r/Detroit. This sub gets similar requests about once a week (usually from folks flying through), so there are TONS of threads with great replies. Go read a half-dozen of those and you'll have a great foundation of suggestions and knowledge, plus you'll get replies to this post.  One easy answer: downtown is totally safe, especially during the day. Daytime on a workday isn't the most happening time to visit, but at least every bar/restaurant will be open. If all you're doing is walking around downtown, you have nothing to worry about. Standard 'tourist in a strange city' rules apply.  EDIT: Slow day at work, plus we like to make sure visitors have a good time here and see that Detroit is badass, not bad. Our sticky: Things to do in Detroit: Once and for all, again Threads: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, and eleven. Obviously not everything applies to you, but there's plenty that could. More out there to be found in the sub, too.   EDIT 2: When we say ""downtown"", we refer to the square bordered by M-10 on the west, I-75 on the north, I-375 on the east, and the Detroit River on the south. Go look at Google Maps and orient yourself. The Greyhound station is technically at the extreme edge of ""Corktown"", across M-10 from downtown proper. The westernmost strip of downtown is very courthouse-y and federal-y with really nothing going on except the MGM casino (which contains everything you'd ever need). So when you get off the bus and look around and start walking, don't get discouraged by boring buildings and few pedestrians- all the good stuff is just a few blocks further, and it's all packed in. You'll be rewarded for a short trek past the sleepy side. Just remember ""Pass Cass"": go past Cass Avenue, and things will start to look like a city with some life to it!"

Plus they'll be open for you.  From there, head to Punch Bowl Social for breakfast. It's an unusual recommendation, but really solid and more creative than anything else in the area (except Hudson's, mentioned in another comment). Menu is here."

Detroit,39ar9g,ellenbrook,10,Wed Jun 10 14:03:14 2015 UTC,"I think more people would go to the games regardless of the Pistons being terrible if they played in the city.

Detroit,39ar9g,GTuck,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:14:23 2015 UTC,That parking lot is why they will never move. There is practically no other way to get to the Palace.  It makes money every single game and all of that Cash flowing in would be hard to let go of.
Detroit,39ar9g,OtterpusRex,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:40:16 2015 UTC,"Not a real time saver, but a frustration saver is to Uber to the bar ""Hoops"". They have a $4 shuttle that takes you to and from the game. Then obviously you could Uber back from either the Palace or Hoops. I think downtown to Hoops was ~$20 in an Uber, so $40 round trip. If you get a little group it's really not that bad (money wise). Time spent traveling and not being able to go out downtown immediately after both suck."
Detroit,39ar9g,joosebox,2,Thu Jun 11 19:27:47 2015 UTC,They won't but they should.  I think it's ridiculous for any sport team to claim to be from a city where they're unwilling to put their home arena.

Detroit,398c78,MGoAzul,4,Wed Jun 10 00:00:38 2015 UTC,"Does anyone else find it funny now that only after everything has been approved for the new Red Wings arena the Pistons are thinking about moving downtown?  It was only about a year ago that PSE said they had zero plans to move out of 'the great facility that is the Palace', and said something about how it's still one of the best venues for basketball in the US.   While I really don't think we need another sports arena downtown, I can't help but think that the new Red Wings arena would feel heavily watered down into a boring multi sports complex.  I love the fact that they put so much effort into displaying the history and the legacy of the Red Wings in the new arena, from everything from the colors of the arena to the statues and flags everywhere.   My opinion on this would probably be a lot different if Mike Ilitch secured the ownership of the Pistons a couple years back.  But Gores seems like a sleaze trying to lump his crummy basketball team who can't sell out anymore into the hype of a new arena downtown.  I hope Olympia says no."
Detroit,398c78,jgopp,3,Wed Jun 10 13:37:38 2015 UTC,"While I really don't think we need another sports arena downtown, I can't help but think that the new Red Wings arena would feel heavily watered down into a boring multi sports complex. I love the fact that they put so much effort into displaying the history and the legacy of the Red Wings in the new arena, from everything from the colors of the arena to the statues and flags everywhere.   I think it's still early enough in the project that, if a deal to bring the Pistons in gets worked out, they'd be able to incorporate elements that honor both teams without it seeming too cluttered. Both teams have great histories and it might be cool to see it all in one place.  To your point about the colors, I think a lot of what I've seen in the renderings comes from LED lighting effects. The colors on the outside, and even the logo on the roof, could be changed literally at the click of a mouse to reflect whatever event might be happening inside.  I'd rather have that than yet another sports venue cluttering the downtown core. Three is already a lot for a city this size."
Detroit,398c78,ConeySauce,2,Wed Jun 10 14:32:58 2015 UTC,"While I really don't think we need another sports arena downtown, I can't help but think that the new Red Wings arena would feel heavily watered down into a boring multi sports complex. I love the fact that they put so much effort into displaying the history and the legacy of the Red Wings in the new arena, from everything from the colors of the arena to the statues and flags everywhere.   That's my worry. Going to the ACC in Toronto and seeing all the Leafs stuff, and then seeing Raptor's colors shoehorned in to celebrate their 3 Division Championships just seems forced.  I think it would look really cluttered if they had all 19 award banners, plus the 8 retired number banners that the Pistons have (I'm excluding the Shock's 3 WNBA championship banners), plus the 42 Red Wings award banners, and 7 retired number banners.  And to be honest, I'd probably be really upset if they had to take down the Wings 19 divisional champions banners as a result."
Detroit,398c78,jimmy_three_shoes,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:49:24 2015 UTC,"I work at the Joe during season, and there were a lot of rumors flying around that the new area would be 'shared' with the Pistons. I even heard from a very reputable source that an idea had been floating around for dual-level area.  Maybe there was some communication early on for a partnership?"
Detroit,398c78,thankyoueric,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:08:12 2015 UTC,Oh I wouldn't be surprised at all if they did talk in the early going ons.  But the Wings proceeded to move on ahead after PSE (is it still actually called that anymore btw?) said they were interested and invested in staying with the Palace.
Detroit,398c78,jgopp,2,Wed Jun 10 15:12:32 2015 UTC,I was driving by the Palace the other day wishing it wasn't owned by Gores so he'd have incentive to move them downtown. I think Gores has been a pretty good owner as far as basketball is concerned so it sucked wanting him gone for that sole reason lol. I really never thought this would happen with him owning both the team and venue. The fact it's happening so soon and that they could possibly use the new Wings stadium has me beyond excited. My favorite sport is basket ball and I'm moving downtown next month. This is awesome.
Detroit,398c78,joosebox,3,Wed Jun 10 06:49:45 2015 UTC,"As long as the new arena stays built for primarily hockey sight-lines, and they keep the Winged Wheel on the roof, I'd be okay with it.  With the issues the Islanders are going to be facing with the Barclay's Center being basketball focused, I'm a little worried when people start talking about a dual-use arena. I mean look at how goofy this looks. It looks cramped, the scoreboard is off-center, and the obstructed view seats on one end is laughable in 2015.  I love the statues and other Red Wings theming at the Joe right now that gives a somewhat sterile looking building some history and character.   While the new arena does not look sterile, I was looking forward to it being Red Wing themed from the ground to the roof, to bring in some of the history from the Joe.  I'm not sure if even moving the team downtown will increase attendance until the team is good again either."
Detroit,398c78,jimmy_three_shoes,3,Wed Jun 10 12:59:00 2015 UTC,I think the roof is supposed to be a giant LED screen. So it could be a Wings logo for their games and a Pistons logo for their games.
Detroit,398c78,Khorasaurus,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:25:08 2015 UTC,"I thought that was only around the edge of the roof, and the roof itself was going to be painted.  If the entire roof is an LED, holy shit."
Detroit,398c78,jimmy_three_shoes,3,Wed Jun 10 14:32:41 2015 UTC,"No the entire roof is an LED screen capable of showing whatever they want it to.      ■ Lighted roof design: The roof of the arena will be fashioned with the most modern programmable lighting so that different images can be produced for a given event. In the rendering provided by Olympia Development, the roof shows the Red Wings logo as it will on hockey nights. But the roof could be green for St. Patrick’s Day or something else for a concert by Kid Rock or Eminem, Ilitch said. He described the desired effect as “classy, not gaudy.”"

That's the thing, if you look at the history of their ticket sales, it doesn't exactly matter where they play, it's just as long as the team is good they sell out all or nearly all their games. Moving downtown is more a sentimental action."
Detroit,398c78,taoistextremist,3,Wed Jun 10 13:24:55 2015 UTC,"Then what's the point?  The Palace is still a good venue to see a basketball game.  They've done a brilliant job in keeping the arena up to date with fan amenities and player facilities.    Tiger Stadium was outdated and crumbling.  The Silverdome was outdated and crumbling.  Joe Louis Arena is outdated and crumbling. The Palace is...in the suburbs?  Unless they're planning on moving another minor league sports team (which they wouldn't fill the seats with anyways), there's no way that they'll be able to keep the building open with just concerts and other touring acts (circuses, rodeos, etc).  The place would end up abandoned or demolished."
Detroit,398c78,jimmy_three_shoes,7,Wed Jun 10 13:40:13 2015 UTC,"The Palace is in the suburbs in outer space   Fixed it for you.   Seriously, as someone who was not raised on the Pistons, the reason I do not give a damn about them is primarily because I know I do not have opportunities to see them play. The reason I can't see them play is because getting to and from the Palace is such an investment of car-time (in addition to the investment of money and seat-time). I live in Ferndale, and spend most of my time in Detroit. I don't want to haul my ass all the way out to the Palace on the single road that goes there along with ten thousand other cars, sit in their infernal eternal traffic lines, then do the same thing on the way back. And I live in the same county. Imagine how would-be fans from other counties in the metro feel. Moving the Pistons from Auburn Hills to Detroit might seem like a unnecessary minor shift for someone in Bloomfield, but for someone in Taylor or Dearborn or Ypsilanti or Eastpointe, it's like an NBA team just poofed into existence from out of nowhere! Hey look! A new Detroit team! That plays in Detroit! Right by where all the other Detroit teams play in Detroit! Cool, let's go!  And of course, there's the cachet and the 'optics' and the marketing appeal and yadda yadda, but we were talking about locals."
Detroit,398c78,ornryactor,5,Wed Jun 10 14:16:26 2015 UTC,"Are you me? I'm a Ferndale resident as well and I feel like I could have written this word-for-word. The problem with the Palace isn't that it's ""in the suburbs,"" it's that it's way the hell out in the suburbs, inaccessible to a huge swath of the region, including many wealthy communities.  My company gives away free Pistons tickets to clients. Our clients downriver and in western Wayne outright refuse to take them."
Detroit,398c78,Khorasaurus,3,Wed Jun 10 14:24:24 2015 UTC,"Not to mention it's not near any bars/nightlife/restaurants  that you can walk to. I live outside of Comerica Park and there's people all over the city on game days. The Palace, on the other hand, is an in-and-out operation. I hate, no, I LOATHE, when big artists come to ""Detroit"" and play at the fucking Palace. Even locals like Big Sean and Bob Seger have pulled this shit. I know they might not have full control over their venue, - but seriously? If you're coming home to play in Detroit, play IN Detroit"
Detroit,398c78,thankyoueric,2,Wed Jun 10 15:21:09 2015 UTC,"It's the same thing for Lions/Tigers/Red Wings fans now.  Also, what about Pistons fans in Flint? Moving them another 45 minutes south creates the same problems you're having now for them.  Also, if the team is good, people will drive to see a game. If the team is bad, they won't even watch them on TV, let alone pay $35 a seat and $20 for parking."
Detroit,398c78,jimmy_three_shoes,3,Wed Jun 10 14:21:09 2015 UTC,"It's the same thing for Lions/Tigers/Red Wings fans now.    Huh? Those three teams play blocks from one another in the core of the core city, and have fans coming from all directions of the metro. Many of those fans spend time doing other things in downtown Detroit when they attend a game. The Pistons are literally the opposite of all of those things right now. People understand that pro teams play in the core city of a region, just like nearly all big events happen in the core city of a region. If you're living in the outermost ring of suburbs, it's because that's exactly where you want to be, for one reason or another, and you understand precisely the position you're in. If you live way ""out there"" (in any metro) you know you'll have to drive ""into the city"" to catch a pro game. The Pistons are a massive outlier here.   Also, what about Pistons fans in Flint? Moving them another 45 minutes south creates the same problems you're having now for them.   This is true. Also true: moving the Pistons 45 minutes south moves them closer to fans in Toledo, Memphis, AND Atlanta! Seriously, Flint is an entirely different core city in an entirely different region of the state, with a population under 100k to boot. That's the same size as Dearborn. Moving further away from Flint and closer to Dearborn is already a net neutral, but moving closer to Dearborn also moves them closer to 5 million other people. That's a slam-dunk. harhar   Also, if the team is good, people will drive to see a game.    No, they won't. I won't. My neighbors won't. My coworkers (who live all over the metro) won't. /u/khorasaurus won't. I'm going to be entertained, not because I'm a ravenous, slavering die-hard supporter of PISTON CHAMPIONSHIP PURSUIT or whatever. I don't care if they're good, though it's a bonus if they are. The Tigers have been shitting in their own pants for the last three weeks, and I'm still excited about going to see them play the Cubs tonight. I can walk to the stadium from my office, park without paying, get a good snack in downtown before the game and a great late dinner with my girlfriend afterward (again, all walking), and get home in 15 minutes via whichever of the four major routes has the clearest traffic at the time. The Pistons could be undefeated right now (loooool) and I still wouldn't go see them because I care more about my own experience than their job performance."
Detroit,398c78,ornryactor,2,Wed Jun 10 14:42:10 2015 UTC,"The difference is that there are roads from all over the region that go downtown, so even if you live far away, it's easy to get to. Auburn Hills is really hard to get to unless you live on the I-75 corridor, and even then there is frequently bad traffic.  If we're worried about out-state fans, what about fans in Grand Rapids or Kalamazoo? The Palace is awkward for them to get to, while downtown Detroit is a straight shot."
Detroit,398c78,Khorasaurus,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:29:34 2015 UTC,"It's the same thing for Lions/Tigers/Red Wings fans now.   Well, no, because CP/FF/JLA are located in downtown Detroit which has speedy access to all corners of the region in a reasonable travel time. Auburn Hills doesn't. Your analysis only makes sense if you assume all sports fans live in the far northern suburbs.   Also, what about Pistons fans in Flint?   Flint doesn't really have that many people in it. It's about as much as Dearborn, or Sterling Heights, or a single Detroit city council district."
Detroit,398c78,delurhparg,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:34:34 2015 UTC,"if the team is good, people will drive to see a game   I live on the east side and work downtown.

Detroit,398c78,awesley,3,Thu Jun 11 03:16:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, to be honest, even with all the talk, I don't really see it happening any time soon. There'd have to be unreasonably favorable incentives put in place for this to happen. Either they wouldn't have their own stadium or they'd have to spend money building a new one that they really don't need to spend. And I don't really think downtown needs all these stadiums."
Detroit,398c78,taoistextremist,4,Wed Jun 10 13:46:22 2015 UTC,"Sharing a stadium with the Wings would be better for the downtown restaurants/bars/casinos over having two stadiums, as you'd have something going on at the Arena almost every day from October to April.  You'd have more consistent crowd numbers, as the NHL and NBA would have to schedule their games around a shared stadium.  Having two stadiums would eliminate that, so on a Sunday in October, you might end up with all 4 teams playing at once, or within a few hours of each other.  Getting in and out of downtown would be a nightmare."
Detroit,398c78,jimmy_three_shoes,3,Wed Jun 10 13:54:57 2015 UTC,"I agree, I don't like the idea of 2 indoor stadiums. I think that would be a nightmare and put way too much deadspace downtown."
Detroit,398c78,gameguy56,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:57:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just mentioned sharing a stadium as potentially bad because the team might not want to have to schedule around another sport's games."
Detroit,398c78,taoistextremist,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:41:56 2015 UTC,"While agree that when they're good, they will sell out anywhere, I think they would get an attendance bump downtown when they're mediocre or bad. Attendance at the Palace this past year was terrible (28th in the NBA in total attendance, dead last in percentage of capacity). I think with the atmosphere/other things to do downtown, a losing Pistons team would draw a few thousand more per night than they do in Auburn Hills."
Detroit,398c78,Khorasaurus,2,Wed Jun 10 14:26:46 2015 UTC,"The Staples Center is home to two basketball teams and a hockey team. Pretty sure they've even all been in the post season at the same time and manage. I think because it's a new stadium, it'd be a good time to establish split decor."
Detroit,398c78,joosebox,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:45:35 2015 UTC,"Barclay's Center is a basketball arena that had to fit in an ice arena because the Islander's ownership kept refusing to move to Brooklyn. Barclay's wanted to use hockey sight lines but decided it would give basketball fans a better experience if they built it the way they did, and they had no reason to build it for hockey because the Islanders kept telling them that they wanted to build their own arena.  This new arena in Detroit would be the opposite, built for hockey and has to fit in a basketball court, which can be done seamlessly because a court can fit inside an ice rink."

Here's a fantastic overview of Big Food and its intersection with smaller botique brands:   http://fortune.com/2015/05/21/the-war-on-big-food/  I think the kneejerk calls to abandon Garden Fresh are beyond ridiculous, and there are very good indications that Campbell's won't ""change the formula"" so to speak. They're likely wanting to learn from Garden Fresh as much as make money off it.    The acquisitions have also, as intended, shifted Campbell’s center of gravity—moving it closer to what the food industry calls “the perimeter,” the outer ring of the supermarket where fresh foods are stocked. This is where the big growth is.  More important, Morrison didn’t just set out to buy Bolthouse, she went after Bolthouse’s DNA. Following a trend in the tech industry, legacy food companies are on an acqui-hiring spree, hoping to gobble up foodpreneurs, their more agile management operations—and their know-how in the natural food arena. Morrison made Jeff Dunn, who had been president of Bolthouse, the head of Campbell’s new “packaged fresh” division, where he is tasked with expanding the portfolio (though Dunn is cagey about what that might entail)."

Detroit,395dod,chriswaco,14,Tue Jun 9 13:29:11 2015 UTC,"First, they have to acquire the land and tear down the buildings. Then they have to dig out the area and blow out the existing walls to widen the freeway.  Finally, when they've done all that, they can actually pave the road, rebuild the ramps, bridges, etc.  The distance may be small, but this project is anything but."

Detroit,395dod,Maddok1218,13,Tue Jun 9 14:23:42 2015 UTC,"They won't shut it down for 20 years. In fact, I think the reason it will take a long time is that they won't shut it down at all."

Detroit,395dod,delurhparg,10,Wed Jun 10 16:21:33 2015 UTC,"You're right, what would discourage driving more than having 50+ year old bridges collapse on people?"
Detroit,395dod,moose359,20,Tue Jun 9 20:07:50 2015 UTC,Mass transit and shipping need freeways. I94 is our connection to many major cities including Chicago. I know mass transit is a hot topic because we desperately need it but we need to be able to get to the airport too.
Detroit,395dod,loud_rambling,15,Tue Jun 9 14:13:47 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing: you can already get to the airport on several freeways which are conveniently located around the metro area.  Not so much for mass transit, which is why we should be investing money in that. I really don't get the opposition to diversifying our transportation system."
Detroit,395dod,delurhparg,10,Tue Jun 9 13:35:19 2015 UTC,"94 is a heavily traveled freeway and provides a streamlined shipping route fro Detroit to Chicago, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. Saying that we don't need I94 is like saying you don't need your package delivered to you in 2 days. That's essentially what would be the effect of letting 94 fall further into neglect.   The problem with mass transit is the lack of interest. Those who are forward thinking are in full support but most people like the independence their car gives them. It's hard for a an investor to justify building transport infrastructure if there is no demand for it. However, there is a demand for an improved 94 which is why money is invested there.   tl;dr Inefficient transportation is a behavioral problem. Neglecting shipping routes to force a currently unwanted mode of transit is not the answer."
Detroit,395dod,loud_rambling,10,Tue Jun 9 14:15:41 2015 UTC,"of course, nobody is saying that we don't need or should rip out I-94, just that spending billions to add lanes won't result in much additional benefit to the region. it won't even alleviate congestion. and let's be real - 94 is pretty old, but it's not a complete deathtrap. you have to dodge a few potholes on the way to the airport, that's about it. so why spend all this money?  whereas, if we dedicated a small portion of that money to, say, get a rail between Detroit, Ann Arbor, Dearborn, and the airport going, that would improve people's lives a lot more. making that link increases real job opportunities for people in the city. expanding I-94 isn't going to increase job opportunities one bit, because it's not like something is faulty with the road network; it just costs far too much for the average Detroiter to access it legally.   The problem with mass transit is the lack of interest. Those who are forward thinking are in full support but most people like the independence their car gives them.   a) what about the people who don't have, aren't able to operate, or can't afford cars? why do we refuse to build options for them?  b) i would submit that a lot of people would like the independence a mass transit system would provide, but until we get off this 'spend money on freeways all the time to the exclusion of everything else' plan, there's no way to experience that.  c) how do you come to the conclusion that there's no demand for mass transit improvements, but there is demand for 94 improvements?"
Detroit,395dod,delurhparg,2,Tue Jun 9 16:05:27 2015 UTC,"A) Investors will only back a mass-transit system if there is a potential to make money. That simple. While building infrastructure to promote income equality is a noble cause, it isn't perceived as a no-brainer investment.  B) Perception is a powerful thing. Advertising over the last 80 years has basically said ""Car=freedom"". In reality, mass transit is probably more liberating as you suggest due to lower costs and responsibility.   C) If there was sufficient demand for mass-transit, we would have mass-transit. Investors put their money into winners. M1 is a winner based on the growth in Midtown. Maybe the Woodward Transit Line changes some minds? For now, the burden to prove viability are on those who champion mass transit."
Detroit,395dod,loud_rambling,7,Tue Jun 9 16:16:37 2015 UTC,"a) totally unclear to me why you're assuming we should heavily subsidize our freeway network with general fund dollars, but we can only build mass transit if it generates a profit for 'investors'. both networks move people and goods around the region. basically, the public is the investor in this I-94 project and it's going to 'lose money' - by that standard, why are we building it then?  b) so, our infrastructure decisions should conform with 20th century advertising standards? got it.  c) that's simply a tautology. the only way to demonstrate 'sufficient demand' for investing in effective mass transit is to have an effective mass transit system? basically that means, we'll never get a mass transit system because noone is riding the system that.... doesn't exist. okay."
Detroit,395dod,delurhparg,-1,Tue Jun 9 20:41:26 2015 UTC,"A) Politicians decide on the spending of general fund dollars. Find a group of politicians willing go butt heads with the Big 3 and I think you find your public mass transit. That seems unlikely in a state dependent on the auto industry.   B) I never said it was right, That is a mentality held by a strong majority of people.   C) Welcome to Real-world business! Where nobody takes risks and all the wealth stays in Birmingham! People who have ""build a light rail"" money have to be convinced to spend their money. You really think banks care if its ""best for the community""?"
Detroit,395dod,loud_rambling,6,Tue Jun 9 20:47:26 2015 UTC,You're really talking about behavior modification. You can take steps to change those behaviors while improving infrastructure. I94 is a critical roadway when you talk about international transport and building a base for mass transit.
Detroit,395dod,loud_rambling,5,Tue Jun 9 21:11:40 2015 UTC,"You can take steps to change those behaviors while improving infrastructure.   Yes that's the main point, you're not arguing against us but for us.  Which promotes infrastructure more, a couple extra lanes or an entirely different mode of transportation?  In terms of infrastructure the obvious path is for diversification."
Detroit,395dod,qudat,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:41:43 2015 UTC,"the only ""behavior modification"" that will work is to toll/put congestion pricing on I-94. but you know TPTB will never let that happen, because cars"

Detroit,395dod,qudat,2,Tue Jun 9 20:17:48 2015 UTC,Not when the money to take those steps has instead been spent on i94 widening which will encourage the bad behavior.
Detroit,395dod,RupeThereItIs,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:21:11 2015 UTC,I don't agree with that part of the plan and ultimately it will be cut. The wide freeway is an archaic model.

Detroit,395dod,chriswaco,6,Tue Jun 9 16:09:38 2015 UTC,"Nah, it does need modernizing and updating, but the $3 billion cost and 17 year timeline (!!!) are a little crazy. Not sure why they couldn't do something similar to the Lodge, Southfield, and I-96 projects from the last decade, which rebuilt and modernized those roads without negatively impacting the surroundings and took less than a year each. They also had price tags in the hundred millions, not the billions."
Detroit,395dod,Khorasaurus,3,Tue Jun 9 18:43:47 2015 UTC,"The biggest costs are land acquisition, tearing out the existing walls and digging out the land adjacent to 94 in order to widen the current highway. Don't forget that, like most highways in the Detroit area, 94 in that area is sunken down into the ground a good 20 feet or so."

Detroit,395dod,spetstnelis,3,Tue Jun 9 13:23:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Instead of $3 billion on one road, we could spend $500 million on the road and $2.5 billion building a real regional transit system. Hell, we could spend $1 billion on other roads and still have $1.5 billion for transit. $3 billion is a ton of money.

Use today's dollars when evaluating a 20-year project. adjusting the costs for inflation is appropriate, but not when you're looking at opportunity costs.  They're essentially spending $100m a year to fix one of most important arteries of the area. What you're saying, is that you wouldn't spend that money. What I am saying is that you have to spend that money to even have a hope of returning to a normal growth rate and then maybe getting mass transit."

Your second point is interesting. First, ask what happened when miles driven started leveling off. If you answered the greatest recession in four generation, get yourself a beer. However, I think there's something more, I think a younger generation wants to move closer to city centers.   Ok, so what is the takeaway to the chart?"

If you answered the greatest recession in four generation, get yourself a beer.   Nope. VMT starts to fall significantly short of projections in 2003 and stops rising in March 2005. The per capita numbers show this effect even sooner. The point is, our infrastructure is being planned using black-box models that are producing bad results. Those results are being used to justify highway expansions even though the amount of traffic is basically the same. That's not just a bad outcome - it's actively harmful. You're just adding to future liabilities when you provide excess infrastructure.  No need to apologize - I already know you're too lazy to actually, you know, produce evidence. Just thought it was ironic that a lot of I-94 expansion supporters don't seem particularly concerned about making an accurate case for the expansion. It's almost as if we decided to just keep building new freeways no matter what happens."

Detroit,395dod,gpforlife,0,Tue Jun 9 20:24:13 2015 UTC,"here's the per capita. regardless, it's clear that state DOTs are making bad decisions based on poor model outputs.  http://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/charts/indicators/miles-driven.html?miles-driven-CNP16OV-adjusted.gif"
Detroit,395dod,delurhparg,2,Tue Jun 9 20:31:35 2015 UTC,"The way I look at it is that they're probably using long-run averages. If I had to make a model to predict total miles driven for next year, I would probably use variables like GDP growth, non-farm payrolls, car sales and, population growth and start regressing them and figuring out some coefficients. Sounds reasonable, right? I bet you if I spent a good eight hours working on it, I could get a model that would be a pretty good predictor. Shit, I think a drunk intern could probably do that. Now, if you ask me to make the same prediction, but 20-years in the future, I am going to use very similar inputs, but going to look at things like net-immigration, birth/death rates, labor force changes, bunch of other shit, but it's all going to be derivatives of the above. However, I am going to use the long-run averages of these things, because shit tends to revert to the mean. I might use other models to predict some of the stuff, but only if the coefficient for the variable is really heavily weighted, and then only then with care. These two models will have different outputs, obviously, because of the time scales, but they both should be fairly accurate.   Ok, great. So what? Well, the long-term model is going be a really poor predictor when things vary from the averages I used in my models. Makes sense right? From about 2006 to present, our nation has been experiencing below-average economic growth, below-average employment growth, we experienced an unexpected (and partially-unexplained) decline in the labor force participation rate. Or, to put that another way, the last ten years have been anything but average.   As a consequence, the model's predictive power has been absolute shit. However, notice something about the chart I linked above? You see how over the long term the rate of growth is pretty constant? You'll also notice that, generally, in times of less-than-average growth TVM flattens out. Notice how the growth rate looks like it's approaching it's more normal rate in the most-recent data?   Does this seem reasonable to you?"

I live downtown and I agree.

How many places can you go to that you can get something that is:   Cheap Tasty Good portion Allergen/Vegan friendly Quality Ingredients Fast   But no guys, why would we want popular businesses like Chipotle to come to Detroit, we'll lose our Detroit character. Enough with that bullshit, if you want Detroit to continue being the go-to joke about being the worst place in the goddam country then go ahead and keep this attitude.

As for Chipotle, I've tried it a few times and have unfortunately found it lacking consistently. Speed is ok, prices are pretty high, portion size I will agree with, but its actually pretty bland.

No. Usually the only time I would go there is after a long night of drinking or with out-of-town friends as more of a novelty.   You are right, there are many fast and easy non-chain places to go, but none can hit all or even most of the bullet points I gave above. There are some that can, but maybe it's a greek place when I want a burrito. (Unfortunately Bucharest does not sell Burritos...) And how many places can I get a burrito right now? One or two places, maybe, but can they hit the same bullets? To a degree it depends on your opinion, but the answer is likely no. In addition, there's a bullet I probably left out, would I go there consistently?   You can get a burrito for $6.50. That's cheaper than most fast food meals. Everyone's taste is different so if you don't like it, okay, I won't argue that. But you not seeing the advantages of a Chipotle (or Chipotle-esque place) coming downtown is a problem with your view and attitude, not the idea."

Chipotle coming to town isn't about displacing local business or the mom/PPP operations. But frankly, these are the things which matter to the younger generations. Others say that it's what other cities have and you don't want it here. Well, that's exactly why recent graduates don't come here - Detroit is lacking hot-ticket items other cities have. If Detroit wants to be competitive against the likes of Cleveland, which has seen the economic development and gentrification, or even pull people from Chicago, New York, Charlotte, Atlanta, or SF/SD/LA then they need these factors.

I think playing 5-7 of the 41 regular season home games downtown would be a good idea. Take a few of the dead-of-winter games against non-marquee opponents and make them into events by holding them downtown. They would draw 20,000 people instead of 8,000. Maybe sell a ticket package for just the downtown games, and market it specifically to fans in Dearborn/Downriver/Western Wayne, for whom the Palace is a long slog.   Of course, I'd like to see the Pistons move downtown permanently, but like you I'm struggling to see Gores intentionally reducing the value of the Palace."

Detroit,394qtz,lovedetroit,2,Wed Jun 10 03:19:59 2015 UTC,"While I would love nothing more than to see them move Downtown, the move really doesn't make sense from an economical standpoint for them. Not to mention, they've been doing renovations to The Palace and it's the largest arena in the NBA.  I mean, the problem now is that we suck, to be blunt. They need to focus on rebuilding the team, not building a new arena.   All you have to do is look at the attendance records and you'll see they've never had problems selling out....when the team was good. Having a shitty team and moving downtown wouldn't fix any of that.   http://www.nba.com/pistons/history/attendance_records.html  From 04' to 08' they soldout every single game, and in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, and 2009 they led the NBA in attendance.   It wasn't until the 09-10' season that they only soldout 11 out of 41 games; we also happened to go 27-55 that season and finished 7 spots from the bottom of the league...  With that said, I'd love to see the team move downtown, but I'd rather see a successful team first, and from a marketing and economical standpoint it doesn't make sense. When we're good and we're winning, people are going to games. When we suck and we're losing, attendance drops. Moving downtown won't fix attendance (and it's really only been bad since the team has been bad...)"

Detroit,395vz4,allhype101,5,Tue Jun 9 14:03:37 2015 UTC,"Good. I hope she wins a massive damages award against that shithole gang of criminals and cronies. Teaching in the EAA was quite literally the worst thing I've ever done in my entire life, and it scarred me in ways I never expected the K-12 education sector to be capable of. When the superintendent and other 'executive' people all make a habit of ordering staff to violate federal law or lose their jobs, there is no longer any argument to be made for it to continue to exist. There are zero redeeming qualities about the EAA and the human filth at the top, and what they're doing to some of the nation's most vulnerable and disadvantaged children is where contemplations of vigilante justice were born in days gone by. I'm tired of seeing them metaphorically and literally abuse both students and staff, so hopefully Ms. Eaton-Davis can give them a lengthy boost along the path to their own implosion.  Fuck the EAA."

Detroit,395vz4,Serioli,2,Tue Jun 9 17:37:22 2015 UTC,Is the EAA governed differently than than DPS?
Detroit,395vz4,BaboonRockFighter,2,Tue Jun 9 18:25:20 2015 UTC,"Yes. They're entirely separate school districts. DPS is governed by an elected school board, except that it's actually governed by an emergency manager. The EAA is governed by an appointed board of directors. The makeup is supposed to be 2 appointments by DPS, 2 by EMU, and 7 by the governor, but resignations, backroom deals, and political pressures have altered the reality of who actually comes from where; unless there have been changes in the past 6 months I'm unaware of, all the members are effectively the governor's appointees. The DPS board reports to the Detroit electorate and the state Board of Education; the EAA board reports to the governor and nobody else. (The DPS emergency manager, of course, also reports directly to the governor.)  The only connection between the two is that DPS was one of two parties to the agreement that allowed the EAA to be created (EMU being the other), but barring a court case going to the state judiciary, even that agreement is now irrelevant; Snyder has rearranged offices and reassigned powers to insulate the EAA from non-gubernatorial meddling (aka 'democracy')."
Detroit,395vz4,ornryactor,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:05:50 2015 UTC,This sounds like cooky Snyder hate. I believe it could be true but your opinion seems really skewed. As if DPS was doing fine with no issues before this happened. Any proof these school are now worse?
Detroit,395vz4,BaboonRockFighter,2,Tue Jun 9 20:12:16 2015 UTC,"1) Only my second paragraph was semi-subjective; the first was an objective answer to the question you asked.  2) My opinion (which is only relevant on the subjective parts) is absolutely biased, just like every other EAA teacher you'll ever find. 'Skewed' infers some sort of un/intentional presentation of partial truth, which I'm not doing. I don't give a crap about Snyder as a theoretical construct, only about the things he actually does. The EAA is a big thing that he has done, and I am very much against it.  3) I have no interest in getting into a whole big discussion or argument about the EAA and its creation and its continued existence and its methodology and its politics and its performance and its measurement of that performance and its veracity of the measurement of that performance. If you're not already clued into those discussions, it's a great deal to get informed on, and not worth either of our afternoons. My responses here are an opinion about the OP's linked article, and a response to your question about governance. That's it.   That said, if you're looking for more information, this article is a great independent report that will help you get up to speed, and this article directly answers your question:   In math, 21% of students at schools run directly by the EAA made progress while 36.1% got worse. In reading, 38.5% improved and 35.6% declined.   The EAA took Michigan's 12 worst schools away from DPS, and now those already-worst kids are going backwards. I watched it happen. I would call that proof that these schools are now worse, yes."
Detroit,395vz4,ornryactor,2,Tue Jun 9 20:48:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your comments.  I don't really understand why there is any question that the EAA is an antidemocratic institution being used as a tool to hasten the dismantling of the traditional public school system in Detroit.   Ask any teacher in Detroit, they'll tell you the same thing."

Today's article confirms as much, stating that those stops will take 3-5 minutes (which is consistent with what I've experienced elsewhere).  Did you see somewhere the ~20-minute figure for running the route, or is that just your estimation?

EDIT 2:  http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2015/06/01/detroit-streetcar-use-batteries/28277789/    Four substations — at John R, Willis, Amsterdam and Bethune — will provide power for the system. Power also will be supplied through regenerative braking, and Childs noted that there will be three- to five-minute layovers at stations 1 (Congress Street) and 12 (Grand Boulevard) at each end of the line. The drivers also will walk from one end of the streetcar to the other — a streetcar dashboard will be on both ends of the vehicles — as they prepare to switch directions because the streetcars will not actually turn around."
Detroit,39229j,tonydelite,5,Mon Jun 8 20:25:33 2015 UTC,"I'm sure they'll use a crossover to switch to the other track either just before pulling into the final stop (Congress) or just after leaving it. It's a pretty simple method that allows a second train to arrive at a station before the first one has departed, and it doesn't matter which side of the stop is empty.

It's just not economically feasible as a daily commute option in the area, so it's not going to happen. If I am wrong, show me.   Soon, someone is going to jump in this thread and tell me how if we expand the roadways it's just going to make more people move farther out and increase demand. To wit I say, they can't go any farther out. Increased demand on roads in general is a good thing. Means more people are working. More goods are being shipped. These are good things.   Why no widening? Most of the area around 94, on the east side at least, is pretty much gone. You'd rather have the blight than economic prosperity and jobs?  Do you not see the traffic mess, especially around 75? Even at the lowest point in the recession, traffic was still horrible there. What's your solution? Just live with it?   Light rail won't work here, as much as I would like. Generations have grown up in the suburbs and will stay there and commute downtown, or other suburbs. So you want to make it harder?  I just don't understand the fundamental premise of your argument. Please help me learn."
Detroit,391h3x,gpforlife,11,Mon Jun 8 16:57:41 2015 UTC,"It's just not economically feasible as a daily commute option in the area.   Not sure what you mean by this; maybe you mean, because they're subsidized? Roads are also subsidized, and with a lot more money than transit. Also, I'd suggest that private car ownership is 'not economically feasible' for a huge percentage of households within the project area. Why do we have to sacrifice their health and local connectivity so that people from other areas can save 60 seconds on their commute?   it's just going to make more people move farther out and increase demand. To wit I say, they can't go any farther out.   What? Of course they can. Look at the subdivisions going up in Macomb Twp, South Lyon, Pittsfield/Scio. The real question is, will widening I-94 relieve congestion? Experience from other cities suggests that it won't. Houston's widened the Katy Freeway from 8 to 23! lanes and travel time got worse by 50%.   You'd rather have the blight than economic prosperity and jobs?   Widening the freeway is not a magic recipe for economic growth. If we're truly looking to stimulate growth and development in the city, mass transit is a much better way to do that. Corridors with transit can create dense, high-value developments (see: Woodward along M-1 rail). Auto-oriented growth creates developments that are extremely inefficient from a tax-base per acre perspective.    Do you not see the traffic mess, especially around 75? Even at the lowest point in the recession, traffic was still horrible there.   Have you ever left Detroit? Our 'rush hour' is a cakewalk compared to other cities - at max it lasts about an hour or 90 minutes. The rest of the time, there is plenty of lane capacity on I-94. We already have many virtually empty parallel routes that drivers could be using during the 2/3 hours a day that I-94 is close to capacity. Let's utilize those instead, and create transit options that could take cars off the road alleviate some of the limited congestion that currently exists; instead of doubling down on the least-efficient commute mode.   Light rail won't work here, as much as I would like.    [citation needed]   Generations have grown up in the suburbs and will stay there and commute downtown, or other suburbs   As we all know, living and working patterns have never changed and are set in stone for the next century. Over-relying on the automobile has never hurt the region economically, so we should probably rely on it for all of our transportation options, as well."
Detroit,391h3x,delurhparg,2,Mon Jun 8 17:18:42 2015 UTC,"First off I-94 is substandard and borders on dangerous.  Numerous fairly tight curves mixed with no shoulders through the city is negligent.  Especially with the lower income of the city, car breakdowns are common and I have come around those fairly blind corners to find a car 100 yards up stopped dead in the left lane because there was nowhere to go for them.  Second the narrow track width prevents proper length entrances and exits.  Differences in vehicle traffic on the freeway as found out from studies from the 55mph speed limit era is a huge cause of accidents.  Again deficiencies so bad it borders on negligent.  It must be widened for these reasons alone and now is the most cost efficient time to do it with lower property values and vacancy rates. Its flat out sub standard to modern highway design.  Like it or not its a major corridor not just locally but internationally with traffic headed to Port Huron.  Second we aren't talking about expanding infrastructure to the suburbs we are talking about helping traffic even just across the city of Detroit itself.  I specifically used 94 as a negative on my list when considering houses on the east side of Detroit like in East English Village.   Living off of I75 was much more desirable.  A balanced approach is what is required with a thought out freeway system along with a balanced approach for local mass transit.  Swinging too far the other way and trying to only improve mass transit isn't the way either.  The I75/woodward corridor will be a great example of how they can work with and diversify with each other.  Mass transit for many areas of the city will have to be planned and eased in over time as the city develops as the population in many areas is spread too thin and will face the same issues as city services trying to cover too much ground with too little people and revenue.  Its best to focus on improving buses until it develops further.  Woodward is the best case in the city where light rail expanding (Hopefully) past some of the best in tact neighborhoods in Detroit, then Ferndale and Royal Oak and Birmingham could really drive functional use for people looking to commute downtown which is why its being tried there first."

Also, you know that the reconstruct will completely eliminate shoulders, right? It'll be more like the Lodge.

We have 'thought out' the freeway system for 60 years while dismantling the transit system piece by piece.    the population in many areas is spread too thin   Detroit is actually denser than cities that have invested in mass transit systems.

It has to be a balance, not wild swings from one style to the other.  You didn't research the plans either. Articles I have read describe widening shoulders and its currently planned for four lanes in each direction TOTAL not adding four lanes each way.  This is adding one lane per direction.  A lot of the width will be gained by getting rid of the grassy slopes and doing retaining walls like 696.  http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2015/06/08/mdot-right-size-project/28697179/"

But even if you're right about that, there's another problem with your argument. If spending billions over two decades to widen the freeway doesn't lead to induced demand, then the region hasn't grown and we've sunk all that money into a road project we didn't need.

I'm genuinely curious, and I'm no urban planner - seems like it could be a chicken/egg situation. Do you get growth because you've added more roads or do you add more roads because you're experiencing growth?   What I see a lot of people arguing is that if you build roads, people will move farther and farther away from their job and ""create"" congestion, magically.

We don't want to ""induce"" demand. We want to nurture growth.   You keep mentioning growth, but a really important question worth asking is what kind of growth? You seem to want to handwave it away, but induced demand is well supported by the evidence, and the people tasked with directing huge amounts of funding to infrastructure projects would be wise to consider the potential consequences.  From the linked article:   In most American cities, auto transportation is the best readily-available way to transport people because there are no other options. That does not in any way imply that it’s the most efficient way to organize a city. On the contrary, car dependence is both inefficient and wasteful:   University of Michigan study: “Overall, in 2010, BTU per person mile was 4,218 for driving versus 2,691 for flying. Other modes of transportation: Amtrak trains (1,668), motorcycles (2,675) and transit buses (3,347).” Portland’s dense development patterns yields $2.6 billion in yearly savings, which amounts to a 3.0 percent income bump relative to the average citizen of the United States. Automobile congestion as a result of publicly-subsidized highways costs Americans at least $45 billion every year.    If we're going to spend billions over decades, I just think it would be better spent on more diverse projects with an eye towards sustainability and actually improving everyone's mobility.   What's your point? This still needs to be done today.   I think our main disagreement is on what exactly needs to be done. That stretch of 94 is due for some much needed improvements for sure, and a complete overhaul may be necessary. I don't doubt that will take considerable time and expense. But I also think plunking down extra lanes for the sake of a vague concept of ""growth"" is shortsighted and misguided."
Detroit,391h3x,ConeySauce,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:23:54 2015 UTC,"Are they? I'm genuinely curious, and I'm no urban planner - seems like it could be a chicken/egg situation. Do you get growth because you've added more roads or do you add more roads because you're experiencing growth?   First, yes they do. Even the models that ""prove"" induced demand accept that growth in economic activity and populations are results of road investment. There's one linked in this thread. Pretty simple one, but pretty cool.    ""You seem to want to handwave it away, but induced demand is well supported by the evidence...""   Well supported might be an overstatement, but let's just say there's compelling evidence. My point here really is that some people's arguments for not to expand a freeway system is based on a flawed interpretation of induced demand. They think that if you made 45-lane freeway in metro Detroit it won't shorten travel times during peak hours because people will magically appear during these times. I agree people will reroute their current routes to make use of the new bandwidth, but this isn't these ""rerouters"" aren't the only cause of the new congestion. There is, according to the models they've cited to support their theory, increases in population and economic growth.    ""If we're going to spend billions over decades, I just think it would be better spent on more diverse projects with an eye towards sustainability and actually improving everyone's mobility.""   First, you're spending $2 billion over two decades. Put that in perspective. How much trade do you think flows through that artery  over those 2 decades. I don't even know, but I am going to guess that over $10 billion flows through that area in a year.   I agree with your point that you want to increase everyone's mobility, but not at the expense of roads. That's not a good long-term play.    ""That stretch of 94 is due for some much needed improvements for sure, and a complete overhaul may be necessary. I don't doubt that will take considerable time and expense.""   Anyone who is arguing this point is doing so from a point of ignorance.   ""But I also think plunking down extra lanes for the sake of a vague concept of ""growth"" is shortsighted and misguided.""   Growth is not a vague concept to me and building and maintaining infrastructure is hardly short sighted.   Here's the final point. The money collected by federal gas taxes are going towards this. People pay money at the pump for good roads. In Michigan we pay a lot and get shit roads. The money is earmarked for roads, because that's what people paid for. It's going to go for roads. If you don't want the federal government spending it here, I don't know what to say to you. This project with employ a lot of people and contribute to growth through the spending and through the benefits. This is as simple as a decision gets. It's fucking good. Could it be better? Probably, but in the end, it's a net positive."
Detroit,391h3x,gpforlife,5,Wed Jun 10 23:21:36 2015 UTC,"A few responses:  First, a modernization and re-building would ease some of the congestion issues without a lot of widening. Things like eliminating left exits, adding weave/merge lanes, etc would make a big difference and have little impact outside of the current right-of-way.  Second, I completely disagree with the idea that people can't move any further out. Sprawl has slowed, both due to the recession and changing preferences, but it hasn't stopped. I think that's especially true in the I-94 corridor. Flat land and lakefront property in northern Macomb County? The already popular Dexter/Chelsea area? Those places are ripe for more sprawl.   Third, my issue isn't really about roads vs transit (although better transit would be nice, and would help solve the traffic problem in a more sustainable way). It's really about the impact on the immediate surroundings. Sure, some of those neighborhoods are already dead, but I-94 also passes right through Midtown/New Center. And the proposal would wipe out buildings (many of them occupied) and eliminate crossing points not only over I-94 but also over I-75 and the Lodge. The last plans I saw eliminated the Third and Brush bridges over I-94, the Piquette bridge over I-75, and the Canfield pedestrian bridge over the Lodge (which makes no sense at all). Maybe (hopefully) they will change those plans.  Fourth, the project as-designed would cost $2 billion dollars. Do you realize how much transit we could buy with that? How many schools? How many pensions could be funded? I realize the money comes from Federal transportation dollars, so it's not that simple, but couldn't we spend, say, $500 million on I-94 and use the rest for something else? (even if it's other roads?)  I'm not opposed to a rebuilding of I-94. I just want to see it done responsibly, both fiscally and in terms of the surrounding neighborhoods. If they can widen it and still do that, great. If not, fix and modernize it, which will help the traffic flow."

Detroit,38rih5,whahappa,11,Sat Jun 6 04:49:32 2015 UTC,"So, I'm friends with a handful of WSU med students. I've known some of them since their first day several years ago. One of them has a family who bought a house for him to live in through med school with similar thinking as you (though it's worth noting that they're not planning on flipping the house - they wanted to invest here for a longer term). I'm also a person who invested in a home for about $15k in Detroit, outside of the fancy neighborhoods (Virginia Park), who has lived in it full time since the day we closed, and who has had a very positive experience overall in renovating the place over the course of the last three years (self funded, shoestring budget, full time effort). I've also advised/talked with lots of people who have moved to and invested in the city, so I've seen things work out a lot of different ways. Not all positive, and not all inexpensive.   Since I don't know your budget, but you mention the ""extremely cheap"" houses in Detroit, I'm going to assume that you've not really looked at (m)any listings (Zillow/Trulia might be good starting places for you - you are not prepared to effectively participate in the tax auction, land of the $500 house, few are), and may have the misconception that you can buy a move-in-ready house here for like $10k and have it be worth $100k in four years. I'm not sure that the market is moving THAT FAST in densely populated, centrally located neighborhoods where you can still buy a high degree of quality for a low amount of money. Though progress is happening, it is incremental and I think those neighborhoods are more of a ten-year investment for significant property value gains (discounting significant property/landscaping improvements that could contribute to individual property value gains).   It's important to note that move-in ready homes in densely populated neighborhoods in Detroit are not considerably cheaper than in other rust belt cities. The homes that ARE cheap (sub-$40k) typically require a lot of work and are likely not going to be in neighborhoods very close to the school/typically attractive to med student type folks - like our place, which was a lot like camping out inside of when we first started, and where, at first, we were accutely aware of what it felt like to be seen as an outsider because of our skin color (educational! Also worth noting that was a personal perception and that our neighbors are wonderful!). The med students that I know seem to prefer living in Midtown (where the university is), Woodbridge (just west of the university), or Corktown (south of the university, downtown-adjacent) without exception. That friend that I mentioned earlier? His house was $150k+ in Corktown three years ago, and the place wasn't perfect. While its value has probably improved marginally since then, it wasn't without major landscaping and other renovation efforts, which were largely spearheaded by his then non-med-school partner.   If you're like 95% of your classmates, chances are that you're not going to be interested in living in a neighborhood where you can find properties on the market for less than $100k simply due to proximity (and, depending on your background and personality, you may not feel comfortable buying into a neighborhood with a different racial/economic character than what you're used to, this is understandable, though I certainly advise stepping out of comfort zones if possible). And, simply put, you're probably not going to have time to personally rehab a house. If the lives of other med students that I've known are indicative, you're hardly going to have time to do your laundry and/or feed yourself once you start med school.    However, if you've got a considerable budget to play with or you are considerably more adventurous than I'm giving you credit for, ignore my advice probably! But if you're talking about something comparatively cheap in the $20k range or so, you're in for a PILE of work, and maybe a little commute to classes. The good news about the latter is that biking is GREAT here and you could probably find a reasonably priced fixer upper in a good up-and-coming neighborhood (New Center, North End, Virginia Park) within a 10 minute bike commute to class. And, of course, you may have the budget to hire out for necessary improvements, as long as you have the confidence and time to manage contractors (trust me, this is not something that you want to just hire out and trust on - you NEED to be a presence and manage your contractors or you WILL get screwed, so this takes time and effort too).   There are all sorts of ways that this could work for you, but I think the landscape may be different than what you assume. Owning property in Detroit can be awesome and CAN be done on a significantly smaller budget than in other places, but to do so requires dilligence and patience and presence and a lot of effort. So it just depends how much of a project you can afford in time and money, where you're trying to invest, and what you're expecting to get out of it."
Detroit,38rih5,whahappa,3,Sat Jun 6 13:24:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you for that extremely detailed reply. These are all considerations that went over my mind. I'm only learning now about owning houses, rent, loans, finances, etc., so your response was especially beneficial. There's so much to know not just about those topics, but even living conditions in Detroit. I doubt I could make a sound decision without more information about everything as I'm horribly uninformed about so much.   If I have more questions can I keep pm'ing you?"
Detroit,38rih5,primesuspect,2,Sun Jun 7 07:28:43 2015 UTC,"You absolutely may! And I'm glad that this is helpful! Owning property is a challenge anywhere, and Detroit is a particular place with its own considerations to boot. Whatever I can do to assist!"
Detroit,38rih5,whahappa,9,Sun Jun 7 12:09:32 2015 UTC,"Read this. I link it every time we see one of these threads.  The ""extremely cheap house"" thing is a myth. Extremely cheap property can be found, but living on it is an entirely different animal.  Also do not forget to factor in auto insurance, as almost everybody does. Auto insurance costs are so high here that they are a significant line item on your monthly budget. I know people who's auto insurance is their single highest bill every month. Detroit has the highest auto insurance rates in the entire United States. Example: I was paying almost $700 a month. Higher than many mortgages. Something to consider."
Detroit,38rih5,primesuspect,2,Sat Jun 6 17:45:19 2015 UTC,"While that article is not untrue and is definitely good reading for a reality check, it also describes an experience that was decidedly on the more negative side of the spectrum and shouldn't be regarded as necessarily typical. I live in the same neighborhood and have untertaken a not-so-dissimilar project and have evidently had a much, much different experience. I worry that article makes it sound like catastrophe is inevitable with an investment like this. It isn't, it just seems to have been in their case.   The main point that we all can agree on is: folks need to not underestimate the amount of work, personal involvement, and money a project like this can cost. It is not necessarily an easy breezy undertaking, even if it's an exciting one."
Detroit,38rih5,whahappa,2,Sat Jun 6 18:23:48 2015 UTC,"Damn, why is insurance so high? This really puts me off getting a car, even though I wasn't trying to have one the first 2 years of school."
Detroit,38rih5,pseudonymicanonymity,5,Sun Jun 7 07:29:23 2015 UTC,You will absolutely need a car in this city. It's just the reality.
Detroit,38rih5,pseudonymicanonymity,1 point,Sun Jun 7 07:54:52 2015 UTC,"While owning a car here will definitely help you to access some things that are further afield, living in Detroit by bike alone IS a possibility, especially for someone who's planning to live right next to school initially. Detroit is definitely a car city, but I know plenty of folks who don't find one necessary living and attending school in Midtown. I guess it depends how much you like riding bikes and how much time you want to spend in the suburbs (it's not mandatory to go outside of the city for food/bars/shopping if you ask me, though opinions clearly vary). And there are car-share programs here as well as Lyft and Uber if travelling beyond bike-range is a necessity on occasion. Again, it's all a question of personality and ability."
Detroit,38rih5,hobbesghost,4,Sun Jun 7 12:15:25 2015 UTC,I'm a current undergrad at wayne state. I recently read an article about buying homes in detroit for cheap. It basically warned about having to pay back taxes on a property (which can end up being very high) and the potentially high cost of fixing it up structurally as well as cosmetically. Definitely things I would want to be wary of

Detroit,38rih5,primesuspect,4,Sun Jun 7 17:21:01 2015 UTC,"I'm currently a med student at Wayne and pretty much did the same thing as you want to when I started. I was looking at places to rent in midtown, realized the prices were sort of crazy, and after talking to my dad we decided to buy a place instead. It works well; I get subsidized housing, he has a house that's getting paid off with little to no work on his end.   Anyway, here are some of my thoughts for what it's worth. Like others have said and I'm sure you'd see, cheap houses are cheap for a reason. I would really suggest staying away from anything that's going to require much work on your part to make it livable. You're going to quickly realize that in med school time is the most valuable thing you have. You won't have time to work on a house and study as much as you need to. Unless you plan on throwing money at contractors to get a beat up place in good condition, look for something more move in ready.   Being close to school is a huge plus. There's a reason a lot of students live right in midtown: we have to be up at school quite a bit. Make sure you think about how long it'll take you to get to school whenever you need to be there. Living two miles away from school might be ok in the summer when you can bike easily, but it gets to be much harder in the winter when nothing is plowed after a snow storm. If you live close (midtown) you can walk, but if you live further you'll probably end up driving a lot. I live just under a mile from school and rode my bike up there year round for the past two years and I can definitely say that on the days it was barely above zero degrees I was glad I didn't live any farther. Many people live in Ferndale and RO too, and they definitely complained about commuting, especially second year.   We also had a hell of a time actually getting a deal to go through. Maybe that was just our shitty luck, but don't get too excited if you think you've found an awesome place. We made multiple full price offers and a couple offers above asking price that weren't accepted.   Congrats on getting into WSUSOM! It's a really great place to be, and you'll find yourself surrounded by a lot of really great people. Hope you're ready to work your ass off."
Detroit,38rih5,frank_and_beans,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:48:10 2015 UTC,"Yo thanks! Appreciate the help. I'm glad it worked out for you. If you don't mind me asking, in what area did you find a place? I think it may have been more feasible for you because it seems like you're instate? In which case, I guess your dad could help you manage the house or fix it up when you're too busy, which I assume is always."

Let me know if you have any other questions about anything."

The US entrance is south of Porter and Vermont streets near Rosa Parks Boulevard. The Canadian entrance is south of Wyandotte Street West between Cameron and Wellington Avenues. It was built by the Detroit River Tunnel Company for the Canada Southern Railway, leased by the Michigan Central Railroad and owned by the New York Central Railroad. The tunnel opened in 1910 and is still in use today by the Canadian Pacific Railway. On the Detroit side, the area around the tunnel is off limits to the general public and is routinely patrolled by officers and agents of the US Department of Homeland Security, Canadian Pacific Police Service, CN Police, Detroit Police Department, and the security elements of the bridge company.

Detroit,38phaf,gpforlife,2,Sat Jun 6 00:36:10 2015 UTC,"I think it has the possibility of fueling a new age for the automakers.   Yeah, absolutely crushing new car sales, and turning cars into even more of a commodity device. Really the Big 3 needed to diversify from strictly autos a LONG long time ago."
Detroit,38phaf,SmelterDemon,2,Sat Jun 6 01:00:17 2015 UTC,"They did diversify. They spun off a lot of those divisions for cash and used it to fund their retarded labor agreements in the 70's and 80's.   I definitely see why you would want them to diversify, but diversified companies generally don't produce the best returns for shareholders. I say generally, because it's not always true, but mostly.  Also, just because something is a commodity, doesn't mean it's not a good market. Of course, that's just once the product has become a commodity. Think of flat screen TVs. The first company who made flat screen TVs was killing it. Then, other joined and the price came down some, but all the companies were still smashing it. Then, the LCD panels became cheap as shit to make, and some companies left the business as the product became a commodity, but there is still a lot of money there.  Most recent data says there are 253-million registered vehicles in the US alone. To convert them all to driverless variants at the current SAAR (seasonally-adjusted annualized rate) of auto sales of about 17.7-million units, would take about 14 years. I like the prospects of the automakers right now, long term, at least."

The big give away in the photo is that you can see the alley-side of the buildings on Library St. The alley on the east side of the Metropolitan is a continuation of the Belt alley, so from the Metro it would be impossible to have a vantage far enough east to see the rear facade of those buildings.

Detroit,38ksah,walny85,5,Thu Jun 4 21:20:52 2015 UTC,"First, let me say that this is a functionally well-written piece. By which I mean, that you use the English language well. The rest of it is just horrible. I assume OP is the author and as a fellow Tartar, I feel I need to help him out and point out some inconsistencies and just utter failures.   Deriding free trade as Reagan's fault, while failing to mention NAFTA, which had vastly more impact.  Then of course, some of the statements are just idiotic and unfounded.    ""Economic recessions have become more frequent and the world is becoming a haven for the rich.""   First, economic recessions have not become more frequent. Even if a comparable timeframe had been provided if you just look at our last three recessions you'll notice they've been pretty far apart. Now, if you compare that to history, you'll notice that's unusually long. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States  The second part of the statement is just pure idiocy. The world has always been a haven for the rich. Again, no comparable period. No stats. Just idiocy.   ""Deregulation of government must not continue. If it does, 99% of the people in Metro Detroit, in Michigan, the United States, and the rest of the world will continue to experience a lack of services and basic needs critical for a comfortable life and in some cases, survival.""   99%? I'd love to see the model you used to predict that. Idiocy.   ""Well, for one, private companies are in business for one reason: to make money. They don’t care if their service is terrible or a product is cheaply made.""   This why there is competition in the marketplace. If you bypass competition through corruption, then you'll end up with shitty services. This statement shows a fundamental lack of knowledge of simple economic principles, but isn't idiotic.   ""Conversely, government provides services for an entirely different purpose: to increase the functionality and sustainability of communities.""   First, probably should have used a semicolon there. Second, this is a broad leap of faith assumption. I would counter that governments are run by people, who want to get reelected and thus will make decisions in the short run that don't support sustainability or long term functionality. Do I need to support this statement, or should I just let Detroit's recent history back me up?   ""On the other hand, if those same services were run by businesses, the more trash they pick up, or the more children that need educating, the more money they earn.""   First, most waste management companies are paid a flat rate. Their business model works better when they're hauling less. (I actually think they're all paid that way, except for recycling, where the price goes down the more it's utilized, in some cases.) So, you don't know what you're talking about.  Failure to do research. Ding.   ""In the city of Detroit, we’re witnessing the demise of city government in the form of privatization. ""   Again, I think history would disagree with you. Privatizing didn't destroy the government. It was the corruption and incompetence.    ""Cities are filing for bankruptcy (Detroit and Flint)...""   Could you please point me to Flint's bankruptcy filings? No? That's because they haven't filed. Fail.    ""With these policies in place, those at the top of the company chain, such as CEOs and shareholders, earn high profit margins. And for the rest of us, a good-paying wage is lost. Most developing countries, particularly in Africa, have collapsed due to these policies, and it would be foolish for us to think that we’re immune here in Metro Detroit.""   I think this is in regard to free trade practices, but since it's in its own paragraph, I am not really sure. However, it is pure idiocy. Africa is gaining because of free trade practices. As the cost of labor has risen in China and other parts of Asia, they're actually looking to outsource. They've turned to Africa. Also, many countries in Africa have the US Dollar as their de facto or de jour functional currency. The Fed's attempts to stave off deflation in the US have helped many African countries with a torrent of liquidity. Inflation in some parts have been a problem, but the growth of sub-saharan Africa has been very good recently, and they had a massive ebola outbreak that really messed things up. Do you do any research or are you just an idiot? That's an honest question.   ""Yes, the economy has added more jobs, but poverty is on the rise. According to the Census Bureau’s supplemental poverty measure, 48.7 million people in the US are in poverty, while 47 percent of the US population is within 200 percent of poverty-level income.""   Poverty is on the rise, so I'll just pick a single point of time to show the rise of poverty over time. Fail. This is a failure. This is like basic shit here. Two points. That's all you need to make a time series.   I could keep going, but I've grown infuriated and saddened. You're a product of an educational system that didn't challenge your beliefs as long as they were the same as the instructor's. You were taught what was good and what was bad, then it was reinforced by cherry-picked stats and, in some cases, outright lies. Your academic training is the bastard child of ideology and dishonesty.   It's clear that you're a smart person, which is the saddest thing of all. I am used to retards who just parrot talking points. I see that travesty every day. On the news. On the internet. In person. However, you have the ability to think on your own, but you were taught not to. Please challenge yourself and your views. You don't need to change your views, but you need to be able to back them up. Till then, you're just part of the problem.   Edit Typo."
Detroit,38ksah,gpforlife,0,Fri Jun 5 14:44:25 2015 UTC,"Wow. What a wake up call. I appreciate the input and the harsh comebacks. Being that the website is more of a blog than an academic site, I was trying not to be overly academic and cater to a wide audience. I am new to the blogging world and will take your comments as constructive criticism.   However, while I do agree with you that I absolutely need to back up my statements with facts, I still believe neoliberal politics have greatly effected the city of Detroit and especially the countries of Africa. See here: http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/08/07/africas-free-trade-hangover/   Opening the African market to free trade has flooded their market with goods imported from the EU and the US. This has caused goods made in Africa to decrease. While this may increase their GDP, it has certainly caused greater amounts of poverty. By allowing international organizations to import their goods, African countries have skipped the manufacturing cycle that most countries have experienced. Going from an apartheid straight to a service economy doesn't work."
Detroit,38ksah,gpforlife,4,Fri Jun 5 18:47:55 2015 UTC,"You are welcome, though, I wouldn't call anything I said a ""comeback"". I certainly understand that you don't want to litter an article designed for distraction/amusement/entertainment with charts and statistics, but I think you need to sprinkle some in there to support some of your points. I too, do some blogging in my free time, so I am really glad you took my critiques as constructive criticism. I am mainly a satirist, so I don't really try to back up what I say, since I am more going for laughs, but you'll still find a lot of links and stats in my rantings.   One blogger who does a great job of using stats really well, while still being really entertaining is Matt Levine Matt is a super smart dude and he's writing for a specific audience, but his work is really top notch. Check out some of his dealbreaker.com work from when he first started for some great examples of using stats wisely.    ""However, while I do agree with you that I absolutely need to back up my statements with facts, I still believe neoliberal politics have greatly effected the city of Detroit and especially the countries of Africa.""   First, it's affected. If you didn't have the greatly in front of it, I would have let it slide, but since you did, I had to call it. Yes, I am pedantic, but I am trying to help.  I read the article you linked. It's a great article, but it falls in the same trap. It tells me what a lot of people think, but doesn't prove anything. There's no support to the position a lot of the leaders are taking. Which is OK to some extent, because they're reporting what's going on, but it leaves me wondering why people think the way they do. I mean, I get that a lot of sub-saharan Africa is a total shitshow. However, if they believe this is the case because of free trade, they're idiots and should be sterilized. I want to know what are the negative effects of free trade on their countries and why they believe they're linked.    ""Opening the African market to free trade has flooded their market with goods imported from the EU and the US. This has caused goods made in Africa to decrease. While this may increase their GDP, it has certainly caused greater amounts of poverty.""   Ok, this is going to be a little harsh, and I am sorry for that, but I can't stand when people talk about something they demonstrably don't understand. So forgive me, please.  The only way for trade to directly and positively impact GDP is if the country is running a trade surplus.   GDP = C + G + I + (X-M)  Where: C = Consumer spending G = Government spending I = Investment (this is broadly defined and includes capital expenditures) X = Exports M = Imports  So, from the above formula, if you assume that GDP is being positively impacted from these agreements, then you have to assume that the countries are running a trade surplus.   Trade surpluses are good, right? Well, yes and no. Like you said, Africa needs to industrialize. Africa has a lot of the inputs for just incredible wealth generation, but they lack a really important one. Capital. Capital in the economic sense, which means machinery, computers, infrastructure. Things that build goods and then move those goods. I think we agree that Africa lacks these things.   So, we know that Africa needs capital. How is Africa going to get capital? Well, they could build it, but first they have to build the machines to build the machines they need to build more machines. Wait... this is getting circular... If this doesn't make sense to you, good, because it's entirely wasteful and ""uneconomic"". This is where our good friend ""comparative advantage"" comes in. See, Africa is good at producing some goods, like those that don't require capital, e.g., agricultural products, but they're not good at producing say, turbines for power generation. So, they choose to import those turbines and export their agricultural products. Well, this is a shitty short-term deal for them, since a lot countries in Africa suffer famine on the reg, but to keep this short (because it only gets longer from here) the market has a way of balancing this somewhat, so it isn't that shitty.   If Africa is importing this capital, then why would they have trade surpluses if they're in the process of industrializing? Good question! They don't actually have trade surpluses! They're importing the capital equipment they need to industrialize. This is why I said trade surpluses are good and bad. If they had a trade surplus, it would mean they're not investing in the capital they need. Check out this map that shows current account balances by country  But wait, GP For Life! You said sub-saharan Africa's GDP is growing!  You're a liar and a whore! Well, I am a whore, but not a liar. GDP in SS Africa (I am sick of typing ""sub-saharan"".) is growing. I linked the stats earlier, so I am not going to do it again.   So how can they grow GDP and have a trade deficit? We in America are really good at this, but our trade deficit is fueled by shit made in China and an ever-diminishing oil dependency. Go back to the formula: GDP=C+G+I+(X-M). SS Africa's economy is mainly growing through consumer spending and government spending. Why not investment, you ask? Good question. SS Africa has capital controls in place to prevent foreign direct investment (FDI). See, I am not the only guy out there that knows the main engine in growth over the next-two generations is going to be the industrialization of SS Africa. There's a few people who actually know economics in this world and they want to invest in Africa because they want to make money and fuck hot bitches. However, SS Africa doesn't want to be the neighborhood whore and says keep your filthy dollars in your pockets. This is good and bad. It's good, because the flood of money that might follow if the capital controls are lifted would in all likelihood cause a little thing called ""hyperinflation"", which is really bad. However, it's bad in the sense that they want some FDI to come in and build shit to build shit (we call that shit ""capital"").    A lot of the economic problems SS Africa faces right now are basically growing pains. Some people in their governments are bitching about free trade to get better trade deals, which is what they're paid to do, so good on them. It's also what I would do. I'd pretend I have no idea about the economics of the situation and milk it for everything it's worth, because it would be an unfair advantage in a lot of respects and it's my people.   Eventually what will need to happen is that SS Africa will liberalize their FDI capital controls slowly and allow a stream of investment. This will help fuel their industrial revolution. Believe or not, there's a lot smart central bankers in SS Africa for a place where the average IQ is 80 and they're doing a good job for the most part. Sure, there's the occasional Zimbabwe fiasco but that's what happens when ruthless dictators are left in charge of an economy. Countries like Ghana have excellent growth prospects.   Ok, this got a little away from me. There are probably a lot of typos and shit, because I can only see five lines at a time, but whatever. I'll fix it later. Basically, SS Africa has a lot going for it and should be less of a shithole in the next ten years. If I could directly invest in Africa, I would. I've actually considered moving there because the opportunity it presents is amazing.   Edit Yup, lots of typos."

A tip for gpforlife:  cut the ad hominem comments, they're distasteful and really weigh down your points, although I suppose they're cathartic.

He did the wraps on the people mover cars and also a full hull wrap on my dad's old boat.  They are usually pretty slammed this time of year but it sounds like what you want is a pretty simple job.  They do great work. http://www.finelinesgraphics.com/index.html  What are you looking to do?  Do you have any of the artwork finalized.  I could take a look at it to save some time before you send it over to a wrap company.

There's no rules regarding time between shots, caliber, etc other than the usual safety rules.   My only suggestion is to bring someone with you. Personally, I wouldn't leave my firearms unattended while changing targets.

The management is a bit shifty at times, but the apartments are huge and generally in pretty good shape. It's a quiet location that's still pretty close to the activity downtown, Eastern Market, and Midtown. Based on your orders of importance, I would say Towers is a pretty good spot for you.

Detroit,38a3d9,Catlore,2,Tue Jun 2 21:37:58 2015 UTC,"This is probably not an option if you value the cat, but I remember this happening when I was in high school: As a couple friends and I were throwing around a football my buddy's youngest sister accidentally let her cat out of the house. It bolted for the nearest tree and climbed 25-30ft up. The sister started crying and begging us to get it down. At that point the guy who put the least thought into his actions looked at the football in his hands, looked up at the tree, and threw a perfect strike. Cat fell out and was running back toward the house seemingly before it could have known it hit the ground.   Cat's can fall quite a ways without much injury.... Not suggesting you do this though. Thinking back on it, I can't believe how successful all my friends from high school became. We were so dumb.   Good luck with the cat!"
Detroit,38a3d9,hobbesghost,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:05:25 2015 UTC,"I won't kid you, I was actually thinking about something like this.  Getting a hose, or lobbing something non-damaging at him, hoping he'll jump onto the roof.  But I'd rather find a less risky way to get it out.  Cats can survive tremendous leaps, but we'd rather not risk him getting hurt, or coming down panicked and running away.  I also wondered how supple the tree is, wondering if they could get something looped around the top and bend it towards the house to let the cat off, but all I know about tree bending I learned from Looney Toons, so I would not take any advice from me in that department.  We are talking, though, about nailing some 2x4s or molding together and leaning it on the tree, giving kitty a ""bridge"" or ""ramp"" to get down."
Detroit,38a3d9,beelzeybob,3,Tue Jun 2 22:24:29 2015 UTC,"When I was younger we got a cat down from a 30ft ish oak tree by throwing a rope (with a rock at the other end) over , pulling a picnic basket of food up and waiting for the cat to hop in and then lowering it down. Granted, I'm not sure how well that would work with a tree like this that has so many branches (basket could get caught) and it's fairly high up so the cat might get scared of things being thrown in its direction, but if ""looping something over the top of the tree"" is an option it's much safer than trying to bend it."
Detroit,38a3d9,DalkonShield,2,Wed Jun 3 04:37:46 2015 UTC,"I'm floored that neither animal control nor the Fire Department are willing to help.  I'd suggest calling the Humane Society or a local animal shelter.  They may be able to give you some advice or know who to call.  Maybe even a veterinarian that you know or who works in the area.  I'm not suggesting your friend's kitty is a pest, but maybe a pest control place experienced with working with other critters that get stuck in tights spots might assist (without harming the cat, of course).  Does anyone grow apples in the area, or use heavy equipment that reaches into trees?  A tree-trimming company, maybe?  About throwing something at kitty to make him come down, I'd be a little concerned about the cat's strength to handle such a fall after a few days in the tree without food or water.  There's got to be another way.  Best of luck, I hope everything turns out ok!"
Detroit,38a3d9,SokaneCaedas,2,Tue Jun 2 23:08:25 2015 UTC,"Most fire departments don't anymore.  Too much cost and taking a resource away(or at least delayed) if there's a true emergency.  And Oakland county animal control only works 8:30-5:00 mon-Fri(if they even service Southfield and Southfield doesn't employ their own animal services.  There are private companies that will come out for a fee.  Or OP could borrow a ladder from a neighbor.  But in all honesty, 99% of the time...  The cat can and will get down on its own.  Unless it managed to climb a tree with no branches within 20 feet of the ground  Edit: just saw the picture.  The cat ought to be fine to get to the roof and then down from there.

Drug problems are everywhere and its time the justice system changes their view on the issue as a public health problem instead of a criminal one so these people can get help."

We must fix these drug laws, and not how the government has been doing it. The problem gets worse then the government cracks down and the problem gets much worse.   They have made moved hydrocodone up a schedule making it even more strict. Making it harder for people who actually need it to get it. Doctors aren't as willing to give people the drugs they need so they seek other means.  Then you have people who have a serious injury/surgery who get addicted and then the doctor will just cut them off. Which sends people to the streets to stave off withdrawal symptoms, which makes their addiction worse.  As you can see I could keep going and write a book on this very complex issue but you get the point.   It's a tragic situation and those who hold the power to fix it insist on doubling down and making it worse.  Just remember, when you see a junkie don't assume they are scum, it's just as likely that they got in that mess because of a medial issue and the system turned it's back on them.

You think your life is more important than the thousands of lives that are dealing with the realities of Wayne County. Newsflash: people have been leaving Wayne County, specifically Detroit, for decades. Because they've dealt with real problems you can never relate to, moron. Please, living on 7/John R for a year is meaningless and irrelevant because you lived the rest of your life in the suburbs. You don't have enough experience to compare the two places. That's why statistics exist, which prove you're a moron. Calling somebody else ignorant when you have repeatedly proven yourself to be a moron is completely wrong. You need to learn that you are wrong and deal with it. Don't call others ignorant when you are truly the ignorant one. You're wrong and you should grow up instead of acting like a bitch about it. It's obvious who is angry, because when I countered your ridiculous statement with evidence that you're wrong, you accused me of having an agenda.    However you decide to react, just realize that saying wrong things in real life also has consequences, such as being called out. Try to act less like an internet thug and acknowledge that you are wrong, and try to move on. A simple Google search proved your entire statement wrong, and you have yet to show any acknowledgement, instead resorting to baseless attacks.

Majority of my furniture is from there and my couch is 4 years old without any issues, the covers come off so you can wash them or change it out if you want something different. Not sure how old the bed is, but it's in good condition and hasn't given me any issues in the 4 years I've been using it."

Also, they don't follow you around the store like they do in Artvan.  They also do free delivery, but again may be a drive from downtown."

Detroit,38a3st,VERY_AngryLawStudent,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:07:11 2015 UTC,I would like to keep it within $2-3k depending on what bed/mattress I get.
Detroit,38a3st,VERY_AngryLawStudent,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:14:05 2015 UTC,"If $3K, then your best bet will be an ArtVan (free delivery and assembly). Go to Birmingham, NOT the one in Southfield.   If less and you don't mind the 'eclectic style', craigslist may be your best bet.  Also, you got Robinson Furniture or Jefferson Ave. near Harbor Town. You may find something affordable there. But, beware; those places thrive on financing arrangements (DO NOT FINANCE ANY FURNITURE!!!)"
Detroit,38a3st,ecib,2,Tue Jun 2 23:45:57 2015 UTC,What's your opinion of IKEA like others suggested?  I can probably get everything I want in one trip there.
Detroit,38a3st,xfloormattx,3,Tue Jun 2 23:55:52 2015 UTC,"IKEA, with your budget, is probably the best bet hands down. For between 2-3k you want a bed, dining table and chairs, a couch, entertainment stand, a desk, and whatever else falls under ""etc"".   Honestly a couch alone that is of good quality and built to last can be half your budget right there.   IKEA is in your price range and they specialize in furnishing small spaces like lofts. They have a ton of clever storage for spaces like that. You get what you pay for as far as quality here or anywhere else."
Detroit,38a3st,Norfolkpine,2,Wed Jun 3 13:38:40 2015 UTC,"If you've never put IKEA furniture together, getting everything you need at once will be a nightmare putting it all together, you'll want to burn the house down. Most of it isn't difficult, but larger items like bedframes and big dressers could need a second set of hands."
Detroit,38a3st,xfloormattx,2,Wed Jun 3 12:35:40 2015 UTC,"I don't get this old trope that assembling ikea furniture is some impossibly challenging or frustrating task.  I mean, are you a 60 year old lady? No? Then you won't have any problems.  glance at the instructions, grab that little Allen wrench and it's basically legos."
Detroit,38a3st,xfloormattx,2,Wed Jun 3 16:16:32 2015 UTC,"Not at all. I have no problem with their Billy bookshelves and the like. For some reason though, the dresser, in some small square footage, alone, was enough to send into a Nick Nolte rage and want to throw it out a goddamn window. Just wanted to give OP a heads up. If he can get assembled furniture delivered, I would go that route over IKEA."
Detroit,38a3st,VERY_AngryLawStudent,2,Wed Jun 3 17:27:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip, I'm pretty handy and enjoy building/making stuff, so I will decide based on the price difference and if extra tools are needed for assembly."

Detroit,38a3st,jonny_prince,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:16:13 2015 UTC,"Personally, I've had abysmal experiences with IKEA's furniture. I know people who have had the opposite experience. But, unless you have a truck (I'm not 100% sure how IKEA does their shipping but I don't think it's free), ArtVan is more convenient.  Plus, the closest IKEA is a SOLID 40 min of highway driving away from downtown.   I don't like driving."
Detroit,38a3st,VERY_AngryLawStudent,2,Wed Jun 3 00:07:24 2015 UTC,Isn't ArtVan's free delivery only available if you sign up for their credit card?  Their website says that it's $99.99 to $149.99 per trip.  I think IKEA delivery cost is about the same.
Detroit,38a3st,jonny_prince,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:14:06 2015 UTC,"I haven't purchased from them in a few years so it may very well not be free. But, if I recall correctly, if you hit a certain total delivery is free.    I got the 'credit card' (don't do it!) so it was free for me.   Even with the delivery fee, you may still come out ahead with Art Van."

Detroit,387xl5,carny666,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:51:54 2015 UTC,There have been smaller towns that have shut down their police department completely after misconduct made their liability insurance too expensive too afford.
Detroit,387xl5,johnrgrace,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:01:32 2015 UTC,"My question is at the rate that police do what they do (beat up perpetrators) why would any insurance company cover them.  There's a point where insurance companies won't unsure you because you're too much a liability.  If you ran your car into every other parked car on the block every day.. who would insure you? Even if they did insure you, you'd have to pay the equivalent of a new car for every 5 minutes you drive, because they know your record, they know you WILL hit parked cars.   Cops are habitually beating the shit out of people all over the united states, and the cities (it citizen's) are getting sued. Weather it's from city coffers or an insurance claim, the citizens end up paying in the form of higher taxes and less services to cover it."
Detroit,387xl5,carny666,2,Tue Jun 2 15:03:32 2015 UTC,"My question is at the rate that police do what they do (beat up perpetrators) why would any insurance company cover them.  There's a point where insurance companies won't unsure you because you're too much a liability.   I see your point. Maybe one of the solutions to police abuse is to mandate such insurance policies. There would then be an incentive to remove the 'bad apples' and adopt better policies / training... or a department's rates would go up.   I live in an adjoining city, but I would be absolutely livid as an Inkster taxpayer, knowing that I have to pay additional taxes because of the misconduct of a single city employee."

Midtown is packed with students that find affordable rates, and the best time to scoop is in the late spring/summer. I looked at a place in the middle of Wayne State that was 3 bedroom for just about 1000/mo. If you branch out to New Center/North End you'll find things that are more affordable. New Center will be developed into a small gem because the last stop of the light-rail will be there. Right now, it's not the best, but there are small restaurants/bars/shops that may satisfy you in the meantime. Keep in mind that prices will probably go up next summer due to the opening of the light-rail."

Detroit,38454o,gpforlife,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:43:13 2015 UTC,"My point was that the median salary for Michigan teachers is above the national average. I didn't know what the median salary for a Detroit Public School teacher was, so I Googled it:   ""The 2008–2009 edition of the Michigan Department of Education's ranking of Michigan Public School financial data showed the mean Detroit Public School teacher's salary stood at $71,031, more than 14% higher than the state average of $62,237.""   So, I'd say Detroit Public School teachers, on average, are paid more than the national average as of 2009. The data is old and I am too lazy to look up fresher statistics on the issue.   Keep in mind, these are mean salaries, so it's likely that half the teachers make less and half make more (obviously a logarithmic distribution hence the ""likely"" part).

If so, you could start at eastern market and bike along the river walk to belle isle where they have an aquarium and other things like that. Once you bike back, you could end the day at cliff belles (an awesome jazz restaurant/bar).

Each time, the trip has been a lot of fun and professionally managed.  If you're inclined to try something like this, by all means give it a whirl.  You'll see part of Detroit that you've never seen before."
Detroit,37wfhe,awesley,1 point,Sun May 31 05:21:29 2015 UTC,Recently I've been thinking about kayaking the Detroit river possibly around Belle isle and maybe towards downtown. Do you have any idea what the current is like? Say if I launched from Belle isle and floated a mile downstream how hard would the trip back be?
Detroit,37wfhe,daryldumpling,2,Sun May 31 22:09:00 2015 UTC,"I think the current there is about 5 mph.  You can paddle upstream, but it's work.  I suggest you make your first trip going upstream and see how it goes."
Detroit,37wfhe,awesley,2,Mon Jun 1 16:23:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd say you're about right. It's about 3-4kts on the Detroit side of the island, fairly close to shore. If you go across the river, nearer to the Detroit side the current picks up as it's on the outside of the bend.  The middle is fast too. I know further upstream I can anchor a boat and swim in the slipstream of the boat without losing ground fairly easily. Outside of the slipstream, I can, but it's a lot harder. The current isn't as strong there, either."
Detroit,37wfhe,gpforlife,2,Tue Jun 2 01:33:42 2015 UTC,"If you floated a mile downstream? The current is going to be a lot stronger than if you tried to just round Belle Isle. I'd strongly advise against that. Depending on recent weather and lake levels, the Detroit River flows a lot faster than most people think. In the middle of river, say around the rencen, the current is every bit of 4kts usually. Heavy rains a few days before, and it can be much more.   I'd start off on the beach (Detroit side) then paddle upstream. This should be easy paddling. If you're having the slightest trouble here, just pull in and hoof it back to your car and have a beer. It shouldn't be too bad if you stay close to shore, till around the DYC, then it should be at it's hardest part. Good news is that if you can't get past the water intake, the current will take you back to the beach. If you can make it past that part, you should be ok. The only other part would be coming up past the bridge to get back to the beach.   If you're going to do this. Give the Coasties a call at Station Belle Isle. Tell them what you're planning to do and ask for any updated current information. Then, on the day you're going to do it, call them and tell them when you're going to shove off and then tell them when you're going to call them back. Then call them when you land. Coasties are amazingly helpful and the fact you thought ahead and told them, will be greatly appreciated.   I'd also consider bringing a paddling buddy, for at least the first time. Navy SEALs use the buddy system for everything. There's a reason for it.   Good luck!"
Detroit,37wfhe,gpforlife,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:30:36 2015 UTC,"I have an alternate suggestion.  Put in at Belanger Park and paddle upstream.  The Rouge is right there, maybe 1/4 mile upstream and you can duck into that.   Circumnavigate Zug Island if you like.  And if a freighter is coming at you, don't worry.  As a non-powered craft you have the right of way.  :)  Edit:  Just go with Riverside Kayak.  This is their Detroit Canals Tour.  They have others."

Detroit,37t5h1,jbisinla,2,Sun May 31 17:20:21 2015 UTC,"Bill Bryson has a really interesting view on malls in America. He grew up during the last true hurrah of urban commerce in this country, and he could never understand why centrally located shops in walkable neighborhoods were so gleefully discarded for far-flung malls.   He did note, however, that parking was a big part of the decline of downtown. It's had to quantify just how much people in the '50s and '60s HATED parking in the city, especially when you had to pay for it. Big, free parking lots were considered a marvel, believe it or not. And no one wanted to take public transit anymore. Why do that when you can afford a luxurious car?  Bryson isn't the only author I've read that's noted the anxiety and anger downtown parking caused back then. The car really destroyed urban commerce more than anything else. We can talk about white flight (and that played a role in Detroit, to be a certain), but even Bryson's relatively homogeneous hometown of Des Moines suffered a severe commercial decline in its urban areas."

Detroit,37tptt,jay-cee-money,3,Sat May 30 12:19:25 2015 UTC,It's not the home of US Steel. That's Pittsburg. US Steel has a plant on Zug Island. I believe they cast slab steel and roll steel there.
Detroit,37tptt,gpforlife,3,Sat May 30 20:54:54 2015 UTC,I stand corrected :)

Detroit,37tptt,DetroitEastSider,1 point,Mon Jun 1 12:48:17 2015 UTC,"Haha wow, a real answer. First off, why is there so much security compared to other steel mills and factories?"
Detroit,37tptt,DetroitEastSider,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:38:01 2015 UTC,"It is much tighter.  You can't enter unless you have an RFID badge that gets updated, I think, every month.  I assume it is the dangerous chemicals and other NUMEROUS safety hazards. Maybe the cancer risk/liability plays a part. Parts of the island are really tight and there are always huge trucks (10 ton coal haulers), so just to drive it is dangerous.  Add in the crazy steam that gets released that obscures every road in a 50 yard radius and you have a party. The funniest are parts where you HAVE to wear a respirator/CO monitor.  But when you are 10 feet away, outside the chain-link fence, you are supposedly safe."
Detroit,37tptt,DetroitEastSider,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:31:05 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, that sounds really dangerous. Are the stories about the big rats true?"

Detroit,37q6u1,iwantagrinder,6,Fri May 29 17:24:13 2015 UTC,Agreed!
Detroit,37q6u1,bobonthenet,4,Fri May 29 17:26:27 2015 UTC,"I think it's an ideal location for the jail, just not a wise choice financially.    There are others willing to pay money for the space the area would greatly benefit from commercial investment."
Detroit,37q6u1,obnoxiouscarbuncle,4,Fri May 29 18:05:46 2015 UTC,"The problem with not finishing the jail is that the county would have to pay back hundreds of millions of dollars that it doesn't have. Any sale of the site would not come close to covering that amount. Insane as that is, and barring any changes in the status of the bonds used to pay for what's been built, finishing the jail is probably the least bad option."
Detroit,37q6u1,delurhparg,3,Fri May 29 18:35:16 2015 UTC,"Move the court and jail functions to the Mound Rd site.  The lack of infrastructure in that area is cited as the main reason it isn't desirable, and that is a reasonable point.  It just seems that a larger investment in an area apart from downtown would spur further investment in the area by the corrolary businesses that follow the court/jail; restaurants, bail bondsmen, law offices, etc.   A downtown court complex lacks potential to add more value to the area than Frank Murphy HOJ already has, and in fact has less potential than almost any other use of such prime real estate."
Detroit,37q6u1,kr2c,4,Fri May 29 22:15:03 2015 UTC,Can we agree that the stench of cronyism and corruption in Wayne County and Detroit is one of the reasons that Detroit has become a national punchline over the last 50 years or so?  Don't get me wrong; I hope it will eventually come back but boondoggles of this sort sure don't help.
Detroit,37q6u1,OnorioCatenacci,4,Fri May 29 21:28:12 2015 UTC,The county really needs to lockdown its finances...
