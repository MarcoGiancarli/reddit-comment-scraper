The example of Jesus in the living room was fantastic.  The JW's are trained how to ""sell"" their beliefs in a theocratic meeting/school they hold once a week, where they overcome pre-determined objections using scriptures that are spooned fed to them so they can pass it on to the public. This gives them the illusion of knowing the bible over most Christians that do not read the scriptures, so they ""sound"" intelligent. But when confronted with someone, like yourself this is where there intellectual dishonesty comes to a very bright light.   Very nice job and thank you veryu much for sharing. If you have any more stories like this I think this sub would appreciate it.  Knowledge will set you free."

exjw,3e43lt,Evilpagan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:19:26 2015 UTC,"I really did enjoy that.  What the Greeks accomplished in their time is really interesting.  One thing to keep in mind about the JWs is their understanding of when and how the bible was compiled and circulated.  We know about the Council of Nicaea and the fact that the old testament was written at a later date than Christians understand it to be written.  So when you say that Eratosthenes was writing about this in 300 BCE the JW might instantly discredit this, erroneously of course, because they believe the old testament books were written at this time or before.  They really have been mislead as far as dates go and the overall history of the bible cannon.  You and I know better, but they really don't.  Maybe it will make them think, one can only hope.    As far as the ""Sphere of the Earth"" goes, I think we can use common sense to figure out this was no grand revelation.  If you look up into the sky and see our two main heavenly bodies, we can see with the naked eye that they are round.  Would it be a stretch for anyone back then to conclude the planet they are on is also round?  Same thing goes for shit, lepers, decaying bodies, etc.; if you have that in the middle of your city, it smells bad, draws flies, you observe people getting sick shortly after exposure, you tend to want to get the fuck away from it and ""quarantine it.""  Simple observation, no science is really needed.    Also, the early pre-Christian civilizations along the Indus River Valley had extensive hygienic technology, toilets, bathes, that they used to keep clean.  All of that predates the writing of the old testament."

If god loved his people, the first thing he would have said was, ""Wash your hands after you poop.""  It would have been the first commandment.

Operation Northwoods: In the early 1960s, American military leaders drafted plans to create public support for a war against Cuba, to oust Fidel Castro from power. The plans included committing acts of terrorism in U.S. cities, killing innocent people and U.S. soldiers, blowing up a U.S. ship, assassinating Cuban émigrés, sinking boats of Cuban refugees, and hijacking planes. The plans were all approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but were reportedly rejected by the civilian leadership, then kept secret for nearly 40 years.  Author James Bamford, “A Pretext For War”, discusses the declassified “Operation Northwoods” documents revealing that in 1962 the CIA was planning to stage phony terrorist attacks on the US and blame it on Cuba to start a war:"

I hate to pull the argument from authority here, but I have extensive engineering reports on one hand, and on the other hand I have a bunch of college dropouts who couldn't build a concrete patio telling me about how high strength steel behaves after taking a massive blow, getting set on fire, and supporting an entire building. It's also not mind blowing to me that if you fly a goddamn jetliner into a building that it will severely damage the structural integrity with no need for demolition charges.  Going to have put this in the ""not proven and not very interesting"" category.  There was a conspiracy in 9/11.  It was some our shady 'allies' with a religious agenda.  That's enough of a conspiracy for me, absent better proof.  People always try to do this, from Pearl Harbor on.

When the sisters say they are JWs and ""praise Jehovah"" after wins, if the WTS does not make a statement that says, ""Actually, these are not Witnesses in good standing,"" then the implication is that they are, in fact, in good standing.

What are the williams sisters doing that is a disfellowshipping offense?  How do you even know the Williams sisters are active JWs at all?    You seem to believe that the organization somehow is supporting the Williams sisters, when there is zero evidence that is the case.  If the Borg did disfellowship them simply for being celebrities and playing sports, THAT would be a double standard since there are no Borg policies that say to do so is a disfellowshipping offense.    Your belief that the society is showing support by not making a public announcement that the Williams sisters are not in good standing is ridiculous.  They never make public statements about individuals, other than to announce someone is no longer a Jehovah's Witness at the local congregation if someone has been disfellowshipped or disassociated.  If they were to make a a special press release announcement saying they weren't in good standing, THAT would reflect a double standard.  The double standard you perceive is based on false assumptions / misinformation.  If the Borg acted how you wanted them to in this situation, then they would be guilty of having a double standard as it relates to the Williams sisters.    For all we know, they're essentially ""faded"" and still believe in the Hebrew God, known in English by name as Jehovah.

exjw,3e40zd,doctorfrog,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:02:32 2015 UTC,"This is specific to heaven/hell doctrine, but much of what he's saying applies as a criticism of the JW faith as well. The JW comeback would be that God would not punish the ignorant, only those who willfully turn away from Him. And, of course, there is no hell.   The overpowering doctrine that both faiths use, of course, is that everything God does is righteous, perfect, loving, and so forth. If we don't understand that, it's part of his 'mystery,' or in the JW parlance, is down to our imperfection and inability to grasp His mind, or see from His great perspective. If his doings, or lack of doings, appear to be evil or uninterested, it's an illusion perpetrated by Satan, or Him just biding His time until justice can be secured.  The criticism that really sticks here, for me, is that if God does nothing to prevent horror and terror from being visited upon humanity, and indeed plans to impose it in the form of Armageddon, he is either weak (unable to prevent it) or basically causing evil to occur, which makes him evil.  We all have different reasons why we wanted to leave the Jehovah's Witnesses. For me, the biggest one was the realization and admission (breaking through a very tough structure of guilt, belief, phobia, and fear) that God isn't good."

Then a few months later she was pulled in again because her profile pic on facebook had her with a drink in hand and some anon complained it stumbled them because they felt it was promoting drinking.

Don't give them any foothold or attention otherwise.  Show them that you are willing & wanting to be with them, but also that you will not stand for being disrespected on account of not agreeing with their beliefs.

Anyhow, I never did anything to any extreme, although I'm sure jws would disagree with that, and I was careful and I researched every single decision I made, drug I put into my body, and tattoo artist I allowed to decorate my skin.

I could play with a few witness kids and I was also allowed to be in music lessons. Kids ned to interact with other kids. They need to interact with kids they might not choose to otherwise.

I would be shocked if she goes to meetings regularly or reports service Time every month.  She may be ""mentally in"" but she's obviously not a regular, active jw in any congregation.  Her travel schedule alone, along with training, media events, etc. preclude that.    Also, Serena is living a lifestyle that is definitely ""discouraged"" by the Borg, but she's not openly doing things that are ""disfellowshipping offenses "" that I'm aware of.  I honestly don't see any Borg hypocrisy here.

Also, I feel like we're all making some assumptions:    1) she's was actually baptized.  It could be one of those situations where she was raised in a witness household and she herself and/or the media referred to her as a witness, when in fact she was just publisher.  2) if she was baptized, do we know that she's NOT now, or was not at one time, disfellowshipped for any wrong conduct?

It's a different story if people were actually being rude and insulting. If that's the case then you should message them (if it bothers you that much). This isn't an organization full of professional people dedicated to make you happy. We're all in the same boat suffering and sharing our experiences/lessons as we go along.

The majority of us, I presume, have been hurt by some/most jws putting the cult before their relationship with us. Most of us have wasted our time and breath trying to ""reason"" with them about how unreasonable the teachings/practices are, and come away completely frustrated. I think most of us sympathize, but we don't have an answer for how to get a jw to truly open her/his eyes to the unloving ways of ""the Truth."" There is no silver bullet that works on them. I think some of our callousness is that we believe it to be so futile, and we assume the OP will know that too.  It is a fact that some of the people posting/responding are at a point where they feel they still need to lash out. I see that hearing them is part of the mission.  You topic is one of a few that recur about monthly, so it might be nice to put on the sidebar."

You prefaced your story with the advice that came from other people that warned you in advance, you ignored it or didn't apply it, and you continued on with the relationship, look what happened.  Now we're just trying to save you heartache on the backend by cutting your losses and telling you to just move on, you're not the help she needs, it has to come from herself. You're doing no one any favors trying to stick around. If this comes off as harsh to you, so be it, but it's legit advice from people who have experienced this same situation.   You didn't listen last time, now you're fighting those who gave you advice on your current situation. Next time just post, ""I want only comments encouraging me to do this _________ and no advice otherwise.""  It sucks getting dumped, I get it, been there plenty, best thing to do is a clean break in my experience. Sticking around to be friends does nobody any favors in my experience.

So if you're asking advice, you're probably going to get pretty blunt responses, but I'll promise you that we generally know what we're talking about.   Ask for support and you'll get exactly that."

exjw,3e1nbp,DAM9779,5,Tue Jul 21 13:25:42 2015 UTC,"While I can sympathize with your feelings, when you come to a group of people for advice, any group of people, you will get varying degrees of advice and different ways it is presented.   Some will be kind and easy to swallow, and some will make you look right in the face of that problem that is haunting you. I personally find this sub to be a group of varying degrees of what I need to hear. Some days a warm fuzzy will do, but some days a good old kick in the ass is just what the doctor ordered.  I agree with /u/F7oraColossus completely, after having to lie to people for so long, being blunt or totally honest and not sugar coating things is just how some of us are now. I actually find that refreshing, instead of having to wonder if the person is just trying to soothe me, or give me good honest advice. I'd rather it straight up, even if it's not as pleasant to take, but sometimes that's exactly what I need.   I do understand though when feelings are raw and a situation is weighing heavily on us, it's not easy to hear what we already knew, but didn't want to face. If anything take the advice as this whole group not wanting you to suffer from what will ultimately be the outcome of your particular situation, because when we are neck deep in something we don't necessarily see what everyone else sees!"
exjw,3e1nbp,MsAmazeballs,4,Tue Jul 21 14:17:41 2015 UTC,"so what you are saying is, even though all the advise you got before was spot on, and we told you the absolute truth of what was going to happen, you didn't like the way it was presented.   First, I'll tell you what you want to hear, then I'll give you the reality.    Go to her, bring her reams of print outs from jwfacts, a copy of the god delusion and maybe ""history of god"". She'll devour it before the night is over, and you can move to the mid-west of the US and open a atheist haven space.    or   2 . She has already made her choice, like we said she would. The only way people wake up to the truth is to wake up themselves. It is extremely rare that a practicing witness will listen to anyone else about their religion.   We were blunt, because sugar coating helps no one, least of all yourself. Also, it's the internet...so there's that."

exjw,3e1nbp,kalleboll,3,Tue Jul 21 08:26:05 2015 UTC,"People are upset that you refused their original advice and continued on anyway and  now complaining about your end result.  Here is what I can add. You didn't grow up JW so it may be difficult to accept this.   If she has chosen to go back to the congregation this is why....  She realized a future with you would mean a future without her family.  She realized she was going to miss the security of the congregation, being alone in the world is a scary place.  She realized if you were to wed no one would be at her wedding.  If you had children they would be torn in two worlds.   You as a husband could not be the spiritual leader of the family.  She would always be seen as lesser than for marrying you.   She realized you were not husband material therefore she has to leave you behind. Witnesses don't date for fun only for marriage. She was wasting time.  You have become a test to her spirituality. Which now she seems comforted she made a wise decision.  Any further pushing on your end will push her further into the religion. You may end up with a restraining order.  What you can do is this. This is a one time only conversation. You tell her you care about her. You tell her you are saddened by the events and you had genuine feelings for her. Tell her you will always care for her. But you can not wait around forever and you are unwilling to convert . Tell her you will respect her decision. And then you must walk away.   I am sorry if this seams harsh but you pushing to get back into her life or to help her will do more harm than good."

Unfortunately the most effective way for a person to leave is for them to put the pieces together themselves; the harder you push, the more facts you throw their way, they more they close themselves to you and your words.   Someone posted the link to jwfacts and their page on how to help someone get out, if it's advise you're looking for that's the best list you can find. Also look up Socratic method and figure out how to use that.   That said, this will likely not work. It is especially unlikely if she already sees you as her test from Satan (I'm not embellishing that statement in any way).   The reason so many were ""harsh"" or blunt with you is because so many of us have personally seen these methods fail and subsequently ruin lifelong friendships, families, and marriages because jws cannot be friends, family, or lovers with outsiders, so a former romantic relationship without strings or a larger foundation seems unlikely to handle it well.

Advice, when you come down to it, is simply an opinion.  You can ignore it, or follow it, but the choice is yours.    As for support, most of us are willing to help others, with either facts, information, a listening ear, or a shoulder to cry on. Most, of us, are not trained psychologists/psychiatrists.

Committing a sin means they have less chance of living in their little happy rainbow paradise land when they die.  They also take pride in being different to you, special.  It's what separates them from unwashed masses (or as they say ""the great crowd"").  Changing their minds encompasses so much more than having them attend a birthday party - it's rooted in their brains. Same as Christmas, Easter, saying ""Cheers"".

It was amazing how different I perceived age once I left. At 19 I felt too old to marry and was scared I would miss my chance. Getting out and actually building a life, career, independence, basically making myself overall a more attractive and happy person, I could never have done that if I had married early. Now I think anyone under 30 is too young to get married. haha"
exjw,3dxxmi,SumoSect,9,Mon Jul 20 18:41:58 2015 UTC,"I always felt like being a JW severely hindered my chances of finding a husband.  I never wanted to be an elder's wife and hated all the controlling, fake assholes that were all getting married from the ages of 18 to 25.  I was too open-minded and opinionated to be a ""good"" JW wife.  I never went on a real date or had a real boyfriend until I left the borg.  And then there was sex...but that's another discussion."
exjw,3dxxmi,RobotPartsCorp,2,Mon Jul 20 14:28:04 2015 UTC,I get the idea dating in the real world is going to be so ducking different.
exjw,3dxxmi,ApostateGW,5,Mon Jul 20 16:28:06 2015 UTC,"The main differences are no chaperone, and deciding when to have sex with the person."
exjw,3dxxmi,pa_que_me_invitan,5,Mon Jul 20 17:52:24 2015 UTC,"I find it easier to get married in the borg if you are willing to lower your standards and be bossed around and live with mediocre sex and skip out on your best decade of your life.  I find it easier to find a good companion outside of the borg, a person who wants to be on equal footing and be a best friend and partner. A more genuine relationship that can develop before marriage, and marriage be willing and more thought-out instead of something done in haste to just finally have sex. Not only are there more options but the options are more likely to be people you genuinely want to be around.  Before I left the borg (officially, when I was 18 and went to college) I dated exclusively non-JWs I went to school with because they were not entitled shits. There is one exception however, I dated one JW because he was the only JW I knew that believed in equality and treated me as such, we played a lot of video games together, it was a long-distance relationship though. I think my parents gave us a little leniency because they were just happy I was dating a JW and not with my secret boyfriends...  I was a big flirt too. To be fair, I don't think any good-looking ""quality"" JW guys would go for me because I was ""bad association"". If I had played along, I would have done fine but I did not want to play along, it just wasn't a good long-term strategy."

I am not ugly or fat, and I know how to talk/flirt with a guy. I figure it was because I was a JW ""old maid"".  Going from living off at college where men were falling over themselves to meet me to being a JW was weird because the sudden lack of interest made me wonder if I was suddenly ugly because I gained 5 pounds? But I saw so many single women between 25-60 and rarely a single guy. Now that I'm out I'm much more confident around men and once again have no problem attracting them."

I didn't attract much attention either... well, some, but it seemed to fizzle out after a bit of conversation. Brothers just wanted a pretty face and I never had the patience for the cliques and games. (Being an Elder's kid and serious about my ""spirituality"" didn't help.) And I despised the ""meat markets"" at the assemblies. I remember telling my aunt that and she informed me that I was never going to find a husband unless I took ""the walk"" at lunchtime and she walked me around the entire stadium to show me how to do it!

By the time Instagram became popular, Facebook was yesterday's news, and the JWs jumped on board the Instagram wagon because they liked sharing their photos with others.  They didn't realize it's all social media.  Just ""Facebook bad, Instagram good""  The same with their use of jw.org and tv.jw.org.

You need to ask questions and look at things not simply as a witness but as someone who had never heard the message before.  Sometimes we hear a example during the meeting or assembly and roll our eyes at each other.. She loves the idea that she will see her friends and family again after we pass away.  I simply cannot take that from her.  That's why I play the game of just enjoying being around my family and friends and make the meetings.  When I do go out in service it is with my retired older parents that just do return visits.  So its super easy.  I hate the idea that I don't believe in the bible nonetheless the religion.

In addition, there may be some who have been personally affected or hurt—perhaps even on a long-term basis—by the wrongdoing of the repentant one. Being sensitive to such matters, therefore, when an announcement of reinstatement is made, we would understandably withhold expressions of welcome until such can be made on a personal basis."

exjw,3dwlfd,Truthdoesntchange,2,Mon Jul 20 04:26:32 2015 UTC,"The numbers seem to indicate that, among English speakers, they are dropping.  The growth in developed countries is almost entirely in foreign language congregations.  This makes sense as researching JWs is harder in other languages and many are either looking for a community or have less education.  If they published numbers not just by land but also by language in the land, I think English JWs would be in for a shock."

Granted, I'm sure that's not the case in every hall, but I don't think it's particularly uncommon, based on the baptisms I see at the conventions (not just young kids).  There are plenty of English speaking people in developed countries who want to believe they'll live forever in a paradise earth and see all their dead loved ones resurrected.  It's an incredibly appealing message, and while many people are skeptical, there's still plenty of people out there who latch on to the Borg and never look back."
exjw,3dwlfd,Truthdoesntchange,2,Mon Jul 20 20:45:17 2015 UTC,"If you look at the numbers from the conventions so far it looks like the baptism numbers are dismal, less than 1%.  In my circuit we routinely have only 1 or 2 baptized and they are usually born-in.  Even though they are bringing people in they are also losing many to DFs, DAs, fades, and death.  Looking at the yearbook from year to year there are many examples of negative numbers in various lands.  I think you're right that it varies based on area.  In the bible belt, I think they will have a tighter hold and more increases than in more secular areas like the west coast.  They will always be able to find some converts, at least for the foreseeable future.  The question is will they lose more than they are gaining?"

exjw,3dv68h,mentalentrails,19,Sun Jul 19 19:58:43 2015 UTC,I think it is a great idea but I think perhaps the idea is too narrow or specific in its range/scope.  I think if something like this is to work it should be for victims of all cults and high control groups rather than just Jehovah's Witnesses. You will more likely get more support and interest if you look to support a greater number of people. Obviously this requires more money but I think you will have more people on your side.  Would be great if it was possible
exjw,3dv68h,EarlofGroan,6,Sun Jul 19 21:47:17 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  It pains me to admit it, but there's the whole ""this is my family, i protect my family"" aspect which drives the motivation.

exjw,3dv68h,wifibandit,2,Sun Jul 19 20:13:09 2015 UTC,"The initial funding would not be difficult to procure, sustaining it would be difficult however.   One could attempt to start a kickstarter, there are government grants available, and the initial response that I have received from others after briefly explaining the effects of this cult leads me to believe that donations would not be hard to come by for the first quarter at least.   That is the largest issue though, funding for schooling- even for an immensely cheap online highschool/college like penfoster would need to extend for several years.   One could push to have the charity/fund put on charitable giving brochures that are commonly handed out once a year in state and government jobs to give employees an opportunity to take advantage of tax deductions.   Funding would also be needed to keep a lawyer on retainer and for advice when running tv advertisements (which would be needed to explain why the fund exists and why its beneficiaries need the donations) to help avoid the inevitable org claim of defamation. (not that it would be difficult to fight, there is a great deal of testimony lending itself to the damage caused by the cult and their stance against higher education)"

exjw,3dv68h,exokris2014,5,Tue Jul 21 01:02:39 2015 UTC,What about providing a network of people specific to that geographic location. If anything just to have someone to talk to that is in close proximity to them. Leaving the org often leaves people with no support network. Does this already exist?
exjw,3dv68h,SatansLittlePrincess,4,Sun Jul 19 20:18:24 2015 UTC,"it does in a limited capacity. Many ex witnesses either want to stay hidden from the org, especially in the first few years out, or they shy away from structured social interaction.   IMO many need professional help to develop the social skills most out in the world take for granted. Speaking to a jw and speaking to someone not familiar with the cult are entirely different experiences that can be extremely stressful, especially for those who were born into the cult and never went to public schools. This inability to socialize on the expected level is akin to being a foreigner without the benefit of the doubt many foreigners enjoy while acclimating to a new culture. This, and many others, are at the core of why so many ex witnesses (especially those under the age of 40) fall into substance abuse.  As the old adage goes, give a man a fish and hell eat for a day, teach him to fish and hell never go hungry. I think it is the socially responsible thing to teach ex-witnesses the culture of the world and prepare then not only for the workforce but also personal and professional development.  This cult's influence is as debilitating as being locked in a dark room from birth. Many realize that they have to learn the entire set of adult life skills in an extremely short period of time, if not immediately, skills they were denied because of the organizational structure and general culture.   I run an antiwitness action group myself and we provide each other support, I am finding that many feel ashamed to have to ask for help or open up though. I believe that a professional setting headed up by someone who has experienced the pains would encourage our more introverted forsaken to open up without fear or anxiety of silent judgement."

Many realize that they have to learn the entire set of adult life skills in an extremely short period of time, if not immediately, skills they were denied because of the organizational structure and general culture.   This is me.  No substance abuse, but have never been able to handle employment.  I've tried several jobs over the years, even one that I am very knowledgeable and passionate about.  But each time after less than a day I was pretty much falling apart with out-of-control depression and anxiety.  The first time it happened I thought it was just normal and pushed myself to go a couple days longer and ended up teasing the thought of suicide for about 8 months.  Now I start to feel that way just filling out a job application.  It's not that I don't want to work or carry my own weight, but it's impossible to put into words the kind of stress I experience in that situation.  I was home schooled most of K-12.  My experience with public school for 3rd through the beginning of 8th grade started off bumpy, but by about 7th grade I was finally starting to make some good friends at school, and I also had some less strict JW friends.  But then my parents quit working and we moved to a small town in the middle of no where, no rebels my age in the congregation, and I was home schooled for all of high school again.  Absolutely killed me to lose all those friends and then be stuck in even worse isolation than I was in before I even started public school.  Haven't had a real connection with anyone in the 15 years since, and I'm pretty sure that total social disconnect is at the heart of my dysfunction.  I'm probably going to see if I can get enough financial aid to carry me through college starting next year.  Probably will be in debt up to my eyeballs by the time I'm through, but for a chance to get physically out of the Borg and build even one genuine friendship it would be worth it."

exjw,3dv68h,ApostateGW,3,Mon Jul 20 01:03:23 2015 UTC,"Here's my idea:  If an applicant wants support they will have to submit an essay detailing how they were raised a JW, their exit from the JWs, and their 5 year plan going forward. This will ensure that the writer is serious, needs the money, and has a plan in place moving forward. We need the essays to be between 600-1000 words.  Every essay will need to have personal info redacted but if we like the essay we will post it to the website. These essays will be excellent ammo to spread the word and show others how damaging the witnesses can be.   We will obviously have limited funds but if we raised enough we could give a couple kids a grand or two each per year and see where it goes. We could also have a lot of life lessons and common sense articles posted on the site showing how to apply for FAFSA and how to balance a budget. Things that a lot of JW kids miss.  Can you imagine having all this info on an EXJW site that the JW's never provide? It will point out their hypocrisy like a neon sign.  With the billboard we raised over $3000 with 121 people. If we can at least get 121 people to donate $10 each month that would be $14,520 per year which would be plenty of money to at least help a few kids get a foothold or started with college.

exjw,3dvtn9,fatfk,17,Sun Jul 19 23:18:00 2015 UTC,"All of the elders at my former hall own their own business with multiple employees. With this they all own their house, multiple vehicles, and vacation a few times a year.  It was so hard to see them all up there preaching about simple lives and not worrying about property, when all of them have zero want. All the while both my ex and I were out of work and couldn't find anything that could support the 4 of us with a surprise 2 more on the way. And not once did they offer any real help beyond the ""trust in Jehovah"" crap."

I had a similar experience growing up where the elders were all self employed as builders, JAE carpet cleaners, cleaners, or, you guessed it, window cleaners. They had all done well off it, and good on them, but irony tastes foul when their first talk after coming back from their second overseas trip to a tropical island in the last 12 months was about keeping things simple.  The Chrysler in the car park, and the brand new Ford in the garage of their 5 bedroom house (husband, wife, one kid) all added to it too. Hard to swallow when you are the son of a single mum, who has to iron shirts to top up the measly government allowance and where McDonalds was a once a year trip."

exjw,3dvtn9,pissedpregothrowaway,2,Mon Jul 20 03:00:27 2015 UTC,"In my circuit there's a congregation which is the 'rich' congregation. Everyone in that congregation is either rich themselves or is related to someone who is rich and it's completely fucked up. The congregation has been disbanded and then reformed under a different name (basically just a re-branding) several times to try and sort it out but it never works. Every time there's a new CO they always end up appointing new elders from other congregations to try and fix it. As a result, the new elders end up joining in with the 'rich' crowd and all of the issues and scandals continue. They are constantly trying to find ways to show off their money. For example, recently, the children of two of the families in the congregation got married and had what has been called 'the wedding of the century' where they hired out the castle used in the filming of Downton Abbey and had the band Scouting for Girls as their music. As a result, anyone who had even the slightest relation to either of the families bragged about it for a month. The whole congregation is an example of how money and religion doesn't mix, especially in Jehovah's Witness-ism where they pride themselves on not being attached to 'material things'."

I remember hearing a ""simple eye"" talk given by an elder that had just returned from a week long vacation in Vail, Colorado (ski resort town). He and his family went there at least once a year, and often twice a year.  The majority of the other elders in that congregation were much the same: moneyed and completely out of touch with what their congregation was going through on a daily basis. Or perhaps they knew and understood, but still fulfilled their responsibilities as Watchtower middle management and kept telling people they weren't doing enough for the cult while struggling to put food on the table. While spending $10k or more on ski vacations."

This family though, was loaded. They were the heirs to a chain of luxury hotels in Japan and the room we had our book study in was bigger than most people's houses here.

This is time time to make yourself awesome. Do that, and you'll have more relationship opportunities than you can handle."

exjw,3dvm3p,unsurejw,13,Sun Jul 19 22:33:46 2015 UTC,"To elaborate a little more: People often get too attached too quickly when they perceive that they have few options. It's a reflex of insecurity and, ironically, it makes people less attractive.   Making yourself awesome makes you attractive and builds self-confidence. Being awesome means being:   well educated and well read well traveled, if you can physically fit well dressed and groomed financially in control successful in your career(s) socially well adjusted (which comes only with huge amounts of social practice)   JWs start with a handicap on all of these, with the possible exception of dress and grooming.

For being raised as a JW where you're continuously told not to judge, it is one of the most judgmental communities. Don't judge on LOOKS, whether someone smokes/drinks, LGBTQ, clothing, appearance - don't judge someone unless you have clear reason to (and you will know when you have clear reason).

Sure, there is a group that drinks 10 drinks a day, but I don't think you want to date someone who drinks that much.  Yeah, you probably want someone who is not a big pot smoker. And you probably want someone who is not a big drinker. Those are fairly important things to agree about. Sounds like you and your ex were not that close of a match, so be glad you're out of that relationship. I know its hard to be dumped, but in time you will see this was for the best.  You can't just be the opposite of JW. There are probably some things that you valued while a JW and still value. Other things you will want to throw out. Thinking that everybody's into drugs is kind of a left over of JW thinking. In fact, most people are not into drugs and only drink moderately.   Find the things you like doing, and the things you believe. Go and do those things. If most of those things you like doing are at home, be sure to mix in activities that involve other people. Look at organisations you can support and see if you can volunteer. Look at community classes for things you like to do, or could like to do. Maybe league sports? Or do your own outdoor stuff. Don't think that you'll find someone right away, because most of the time there's nobody to date at these events. Go because you like it, or support the cause. Don't think that someone you do go out with is going to be ""the one"". Keep a little skepticism in mind. Be friendly, talk to people, smile, enjoy being yourself."

Hard to break out of being raised as a people-pleaser. Great advice, thanks!"
exjw,3dvm3p,oda2-0,2,Mon Jul 20 06:18:21 2015 UTC,"You know there is nothing wrong with being a morality snob, it isn't necessarily a negative jw Hangup, it might just be who you are. I don't drink, don't smoke, don't do drugs and monogamy is the only way in a relationship for me. I am driven, high achieving, a workaholic and I have nothing to prove to anyone ever, except myself. This is the conclusion of much experience and not jw programming. I have learned I prefer these things and as a result Stoners, drinkers and anyone with destructive or negative lifestyles aren't among my close friends and have never been my idea of an ideal partner. That doesn't make me judgemental-each to their own, but it does make me selective. We're all very different, the JWs dont acknowledge or embrace our personal differences.  You and she just might not have been a good match anyway. I'm sorry you've gone through this and it's shit, in time though you'll understand that all these experiences help us learn so much about ourselves... And that's the thing: being a jw we never have the chance to know who we really are. Experiencing life through our choices helps us to understand who we are and make choices that are more right for us as individuals (If we are self aware).  It can take some time and quite a number of relationships (and break ups) of all types before you really know what you are looking for in a partner. JWs are denied the right to really choose, in borg land everyone is suitable marriage material and breaking up with someone is out of the question, no wonder we emerge naive and ripe for getting hurt easily.   If I have advice for anyone from my experience outside regarding relationships it is to get to know yourself well, spend quality time alone and get to enjoy your own company. When you can truly enjoy time on your own you can make much better choices about who you want to spend time with. Not every girl you meet will be a keeper and some will just be passing fun and it's all good experience if you are both wanting the same thing."

He died just before the memorial, so spring is the hardest time for her because of that.   I guess it just hurts the most now because instead of confronting death, we as witnesses would defer it too later by saying stuff like ""they're in Jehovah's memory"" and the like. And now that the mirage faded, the death is still there waiting to be handled. Does that make sense?"
exjw,3dujc6,ziddina,3,Sun Jul 19 17:15:40 2015 UTC,"It definitely makes sense.  The first time I saw death, I was horrified.  I quickly understood that once a person (or pet) was gone, they were GONE.  There was no opening that door, once it had closed.  You're absolutely right; the Watchtower Society defers the work of dealing with death to ""later"".  As does religion in general.  Most people don't deal well with death.  Understandably; every death we see does remind us of our own eventual mortality, too.  It takes a strong person - or someone who's trained themselves to accept their eventual demise - to face up to such things, & yet find ways to make their life meaningful while they're still alive."

exjw,3dujc6,truthcanbequestioned,4,Sun Jul 19 22:29:02 2015 UTC,"I know that feel. My grandfather died unexpectedly, far too young, while I was still a JW.  He was an atheist, and had been a professor in several fields of science so he believed firmly in evolution based on the evidence in science that he had seen. Despite this he was always respectful of me and my immediate family's JW beliefs. I remember he came to a convention with me and my parents to see me get baptized, and gave me a $100 bill afterward and told me he was always proud of me and the choices I would make.  When he died I was really shocked (because it was an unexpected accident) and sad, but thought to myself that I would see him in paradise one day and he would be really surprised to find out that he had been wrong and there really was an afterlife and god was real.  Today I am an atheist, like my grandfather was when he was alive. If he had just lived another ten or twenty years (which he could and should have) he would have been there to see me make my journey from belief in JW propaganda to the person I am today. I would love to have been able to sit down with him and talk about his world view based on the science he had studied, without the JW beliefs there in the way between us.  I imagine he would have been even prouder to see me get away from the cult beliefs and become my own person. Instead he died several years before I started my journey out of the organization.  That is what makes me saddest of all now, not just that I will never see him again, but that my JW upbringing stopped me from having as close of a relationship as I could have had with him while he was still alive."
exjw,3dujc6,PorkyFree,3,Sun Jul 19 19:12:09 2015 UTC,"We also lost a baby in the second trimester. It was the most horrible thing we have ever been through. We were both very in and very strong in the truth. I just couldn't figure out why this had happened, after all we had been through we hadn't God protected an innocent child? I would cry off and on for years about it. I spent my next pregnancy terrified the entire time I would lose the baby.  It still hurts but not as bad. When I came out I had to deal with the real loss of family members including my beloved grandmother and the baby. I grieved, I cried, I screamed at the absolute unfairness of it all but there was a real difference to me in grieving. I could actually grieve I didn't have to listen to people tell me about how I would see them again, how I didn't really need to grieve because I would see them again so why be sad? In grieving I found a sense of peace. So let yourself grieve for those who you have lost, it is a necessary and vital part of healing.  Also (hugs) I promise it gets better and easier. Give yourself the time you need to really heal from losing those you love."

Make sure that you focus on the positive ones, like his great laugh - that shows a happy person who would have wanted the very best for his grandchildren. His love and joy are what you can be determined to show in your life.

It is in our memory that knowing that gravity exist that makes Isaac Newton alive. It is engrained in those tapes then into your memory that show your grandpa was alive."
exjw,3dujc6,rattrayc,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:00:16 2015 UTC,"Was talking about something similar on this post yesterday.  It's all about exploiting vulnerability.  That was one thing that set wrong with me for a few years before I woke up.  My dad came into the TruthTM shortly after a son from his first marriage died.  It was not long after he had divorced his first wife and married my mom.  The late son and my mom had a strained relationship, with her being the 'evil stepmother'.  So she had a hard time with the loss too, since she never really had a chance to make peace with him before he died.  (All of this happened a few years before I was born.)  So my dad's angry, sad and confused at having lost a son, my mom's stuck needing closure, and along come the JWs, talking about paradise and resurrection and showing them scriptures from the bible that prove it's coming.  First he succumbed, then she did.  Nowadays, my dad always talks about how his change in circumstances moved him to search for ""the truth"" and accept it.  Many, many JWs have similar stories.  But lingering in the back of my mind for years there was a voice saying, ""You were vulnerable and searching for comfort.  Not objective and searching for truth.""  The WBTS is pretty skilled at appealing to the emotions.  They have to be, because on an intellectual level their message just isn't that compelling.  I've been fortunate to never lose anyone close to me in death, so that particular 'attack vector' never really influenced me that much.  (I was just always upset that I couldn't get close to people with how isolated from society I've been for most of my life.)  But they've succeeded in tugging my heart strings in a few other areas.  That song, ""Jehovah's Warm Appeal - Be Wise My Son"" - that one got me.  I've been starved for friendship most of my life as a JW, and thinking of a friend who stands by you to ""raise you if you fall"" and ""always cherish you"" really hit me hard.  But now that I'm mentally out I can see how manipulative it all is.  They try to make you think that you should be happy with the facade of friendship that they give you.  Then, as the lack of genuine connection wears you down and depresses you, they bomb you with this emotional song about a god who sounds like a real friend so that you'll cling to that concept.  The fact of the matter is, contrary to ""always cherishing me"", Jahoober never did shit for me.  And this organization will turn its back on me in a heartbeat if/when I ""fall"".  I can only imagine how much a song like that messes with someone who's mentally in but shunned.  It's really sick."

You should have been taught about disappointment, randomness outside your control, and most importantly, self-reliance.  If you had just been taught that first pregnancies often end in 1st trimester fetal demise (no fault of you or your wife), or that chromosomal anomalies often cause fetal demise around that time it would have been much less upsetting (though still disappointing).  Stop wasting time and energy talking to a sky fairy and figure out what you need to do to improve your situation. It doesn't hurt to educate yourself and learn how the natural world works."

So then me and a sorta in friends started to realize there is an older pedo thats always been around that congregation and got his grips into the older people when they were kids and could be gone now and turned one or two of his victims. Its also really easy to see in the ages of when it started. Which almost seems like my mom was already gone and when her younger brother was at that age frame. But the one thing my uncle ever said about it is that he has to bury his feelings deep down and usually sit across from his abuser every week. So me and that friend play ""Who'se the pedo"" Its kind of like clue where we try to guess who it is etc etc. Kinda fucked up.   Also my uncle is obviously gay, and has been disfellowshipped like 4 times but every time works his ass off and basically kills himself denying who he is to be back in standing for his family (i don't really consider my moms side of the family my family) Anways he had contacted me after the last time he got df'd and asked if i had wanted to go to the convention with him since we both were and that we both needed to strive to return to jehovah. I said, x, fuck that why do you let them tell you how you should live, when you could live and be happy not trying to fit their mold, theres no way i'll ever return.

exjw,3dtw75,tim3l0rd,8,Sun Jul 19 12:33:48 2015 UTC,"Both /u/mobius_sp and I vote. I realize how difficult it is to effect real change on a national level, yet I feel that if we do not at least try we are giving up with out a fight. We have a pretty spectacular nation currently run by a bunch of idiots who are determined to ignore serious issues that are becoming unignorable. /u/mobius_sp often describes it as a powder keg.  We have climate change, with the current studies there is a good chance we are past the tipping point on being able to undo that damage but maybe with innovation we may be able to mitigate it. This is a HUGE issue for me and is a driving force behind who I will choose to vote for. Next we have the many and diverse social and economical issues facing the nation. I could go on and on but those are the big issues for me, yes in that order. I feel a responsibility to at least attempt to vote for and support the candidates I feel have the best shot at making a real difference."
exjw,3dtw75,truthcanbequestioned,3,Sun Jul 19 14:51:56 2015 UTC,"I think the national level is what bothers me the most, but I should look into the local level more. John Oliver recently had a bit that showed how many candidates (even the ones that are racist and ignorant) ran unopposed. Our area is improving and seems increasingly liberal, but the state (SC) as a whole is VERY conservative.  The climate change debate is definitely big to me as well. The fact that there is even a debate makes me angry."
exjw,3dtw75,mobius_sp,2,Sun Jul 19 15:31:14 2015 UTC,"You are a drop in the bucket when it comes to the national elections, but even drops can add up to a flood, if there are enough of them.  Edit: There are a lot of hurdles for the average person to overcome to be heard, and you are right that the system seems (and is) broken and dysfunctional; unless you're a massive corporation you are rather unimportant to the vast majority of politicians. Still, outside of open, armed revolution you can only effect change through that broken system. And sometimes you can be a part of that change. For example, in the last election here in Florida, I voted for environmental protection in the matter of setting aside a fixed fund for wetlands restoration and maintenance; it's very important to protect these in a state like Florida where commercial development runs rampant and roughshod over everything, and with a state government quite willing to allow it. Our governor has overturned almost thirty years worth of hard-fought environmental protection here in Florida in his quest to create jobs by allowing corporations to do whatever the hell they feel like. The measure passed, and there is now a constitutional amendment requiring a certain amount of funding be set aside for wetlands; my state government, who would rather divert that funding to their own pork projects (and thus their bank accounts through various intermediaries and cutouts) now has to pay that money into something it was supposed to be going to in the first place. The broken part, the diverting of needed funding for ecological protection, got fixed (well, until those same asshats figure out a new way to siphon the money back into their cronies pockets. That's a battle for a future date.)  I will say you stand a much better chance of getting representation and affecting change on a local level. Additionally, your local and state government has a greater effect on your day-to-day life; the federal government has a great impact, but it's more of an overall backdrop to your local government."

Politics has always fascinated me, and there were some significant local issues going on at the time that I felt strongly about. So far I've voted for city commission candidates and a couple new city ordinances.   I look forward to the state and national elections. Part of it is an underdog thing: South Dakota is very conservative and I've discovered that I'm very liberal. If I don't get out and vote, all these uber Tea Party Republicans can wander around and think they have this universal mandate. If more people like me get out and vote, we might not succeed in electing anyone terribly liberal (at least not for a while), but we might be able to show that they're getting less and less support from their constituents."
exjw,3dtw75,garbonzo607,10,Sun Jul 19 13:28:33 2015 UTC,"If nothing else, vote for a third party candidate if you don't feel that anyone in the 2 party system represents you.  Even though the American system is set up to favor two parties, if one major party sees they're losing a lot of votes to a third party then that will force them to represent the views of that third party to try to get voters back on their side.  Personally I am usually more of a libertarian, but I have a lot of respect for what Bernie Sanders is doing in this current election cycle, since he seems to be sincerely committed to stopping how big money has corrupted our political process. Check out /r/SandersforPresident if you want to learn more about him.   You're right, The Supreme Court makes many important court rulings - and do you know who nominates Supreme Court justices?  That's one reason why the President is such a big deal, because they have a lot of influence over who ends up on the Supreme Court (and even though in theory we'd like to think that Supreme Court decisions are made impartially, the reality is that it is influenced by ideology just like everything else)."
exjw,3dtw75,garbonzo607,5,Sun Jul 19 12:39:46 2015 UTC,"I've looked into Bernie Sanders and so far I like him over any Democratic Candidate. Between the two major parties, I lean heavily towards the Democratic side. I don't side with Republicans because they allow religious issues to overshadow the important issues. They also support big corporations over smaller companies. I like some of the ideals of Libertarians but really need to do more research.  I'm not sure if I'll be able to vote in this election. It depends on how my fade goes, but it's interesting to at least have the option and research the candidates."

exjw,3dtw75,mobius_sp,2,Sun Jul 19 16:24:06 2015 UTC,"True. It mostly depends if my wife is out as well. When you register, do they send anything to the house?   The other issue is that, in my area, they call you for jury duty only if you're registered to vote.

Take one example I told John Stossel and he didn't have an answer for:   Imagine if you lived in the Bible Belt and you were labelled an atheist. In your version of government, your life would be even more miserable than it would be now being an atheist in the Bible Belt. Virtually no store would serve you. The free market doesn't work when you're a stigmatized minority, actually it works against you, because there are more of them that will boycott the store, than there are of you that will pay them. Only the government would be allowed to help you, but since you want small government, how much could they even help you? (I don't know exactly what your version of libertarianism is.) What about jobs? I'm not sure whether you support employment discrimination laws or not. If you believe private businesses should be allowed freedom, they wouldn't hire you either. What would you do? What is your solution to this?  It is because of this that I believe minorities deserve protection from the government."

Obama's presidency may not have been everything everyone hoped for, but he faced a monstrous task, taking the helm when pretty much everything was fucked and yet has been responsible for some good stuff.   It would have been very easy for anyone to have an utterly disastrous presidency.   Time will tell whether or not he did a good job, the best he could do with the shit sandwich he was dealt, the best that could be expected of anyone, or totally let everyone down.

Strangely formal for the cinema and then I notice the 3rd member of the party: clearly the girl's mother! I have it: a couple of young witnesses out for some wholesome entertainment all while being chaperoned by the mother. D'aww... so cute.   Given the urban myths about JWs being noticed as part of the crowd because of their 'shiny shoes' or other such things, what I actually felt compelled to do was go over to them after the movie and ask them if they were JWs. Tell them I noticed because he was dressed so nicely and they behaved so warmly or some such rubbish and watch their silly faces beam with pride (I'd have had to tell them I was a witness for it to work I guess but that wasn't going to be hard.) Damn it was tempting. Still, in the end I thought it would be rather cruel just to jerk people around like that but I could almost imagine hearing about it as part of some ridiculous 'experience' and 'witness' made by 'our young people' at some future assembly.

Especially when me and my fellow spiritual brothers are clearly hammered beyond belief drunk, and one of them decides to stop at the point where he can barely talk to make a point about knowing his limits, and not being a drunkard.

How do these people even get through the day alive with reasoning skills like these?"
exjw,3ds9k2,Syrinx221,8,Sun Jul 19 05:49:12 2015 UTC,"I have no clue.  A friend recently had a discussion with me about how he finds it hard to think that all animals on earth today could fit onto the ark.  After some time he just said that maybe they took on the important species and then those were enough to create the diversity we see today.  I answered by letting him know that he had just described a very rapid form of evolution, and he sat there quietly for a bit and then just answered, ""no, that musn't be it then.""  Before we got out of the car he looked at me and said ""don't let Satan put doubts in your mind"". To be completely honest though, it sounded like he was trying to make sure for himself not to be misled rather than trying to protect me. Hahahahaha."

Talking about walking down a hallway to our way ""out"". Opening doors, each door you open has someone that you failed behind it. Opening a door seeing your mother crying, next door seeing your friends upset, &on&on&on. UGH - all codependency issues. Nothing to do with what I thought was most important, leaving Jehovah. It was then I realized how much control they were pushing... I was sad to say the least. I used to LOVE learning about the bible, I thrived during the Daniel Book study... BUT it seemed that it only became about appearances, being ""cookie-cutter"" and control."

When one sees how messy it can be, and that it is not just the prez that holds the reins to where our government is going, I would hate to have them bounce back to the cult in frustration. If you compare where we thought Carter and Obama could change to what they were able to, you see that a cooperative House and Senate are somewhat needed; I wish we could put across the message that we won't tolerate scorched-earth political moves, but those seem to be quite popular. Of course, it is easier to complain and worry than to lead and fix; religion, work and politics."

exjw,3dt56w,notinthetruth,4,Sun Jul 19 05:09:46 2015 UTC,"We care, sweetheart...  I remember crying myself to sleep many a night, too.  As a JW girl being forced into the cult during their pre-1975 hysteria, it was a miserable situation - as yours was.  The fact that no one helped - well, that's what happens when children are forced into a nasty cult before the human race had figured out how abusive religion can be.  If you & I were tweens right now, we'd have a LOT more options open to us.  Ways of getting away from the cult.  More people to help.  We're partially the victims of just being born too early for social evolution (in First World countries, at any rate) to have built a safety net for their children.  But guess what?  YOU can do something to help OTHER young girls, even if it's just reaching out to them on forums such as this one.  I hope you get to feeling better, soon."
exjw,3dt56w,ziddina,4,Sun Jul 19 17:12:41 2015 UTC,"You are an important person, but hearing it from others, won't really help address your need for self-worth. You've already made the tough choice, to leave the cult behind, be proud of what you've accomplished. Take comfort in the strength you've found, things you've accomplished, and will accomplish in the future.  We are your friends. We'll listen to you, offer you a shoulder to cry on, and give you a virtual hug if you need it. If you're ever in my neck of the woods, I'll offer you, your choice of beverage, and some kind of dessert. At the moment, I have triple layer chocolate, moccha, cheesecake."
exjw,3dt56w,Neurotronic,4,Sun Jul 19 06:25:44 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you're feeling crummy :(  It's normal for so many of us. I think I feel a lot of what you expressed. Even though I'm happy to be out, I'm still resentful. There's a feeling of 'loss' there. some of the 'promises' I still believed. Our friends. Our routine. Our youth in most cases. We're always here if you need an ear :)"
exjw,3dt56w,MCMXChris,3,Sun Jul 19 07:15:32 2015 UTC,"Sorry that you feel so isolated - I still feel lonely at times, even amid the people in my life. At least some of us here care. Some of us mostly understand, would give you a hug if we were there in person - I'm in the DC burbs.  I had dub friends for part of the first year that my family studied, but when they moved, I never felt that kind of connection again inside a KH, but I felt connected outside, and I deplored that those ""worldly people"" I was coming to care about would be killed for not listening to titchy-picky differences in Christian teaching. But I still was kind of a leaf blowing between not-believing and believing, and so a bit aloof - or maybe jerk, but while I did feel like I did connect to God a few times (after leaving the dubs), I could not hold that faith in omni-all god that does not act. So I believe that feeling of connection was manufactured by some part of me; and I can't do it anymore - as much as I'd like to have that feeling that I'm never truly alone and being able to dump job stress and medical problems on some invisible dude. How can you really connect to someone who never answers, except maybe by a chill up the vertebrae? So I think you were unable to delude yourself this way; not surprising with how much emphasis they put on it being ""rational"".  It is a risk, and it is faith, but if you put yourself out there, you will become important to other people and some will become important to you."
exjw,3dt56w,lescannon,3,Sun Jul 19 10:26:22 2015 UTC,"Reading your post reminds me of myself just a few months ago. I hated myself. I knew I was a failure. I was never regular enough at meetings or service to be appointed. The guilt for my ""lack of faith"" was overwhelming.  I prayed for faith again and again. I broke down in tears while showering many times (seem to have my deepest thoughts there). Still no help. My closest friend moved away. I prayed for a friend - nothing. I knew I must not be good enough for Jehovah to help.  I finally had to prove my beliefs so I could move forward. I needed to strengthen my faith. I ended up here.  Now I no longer feel unworthy. I'm still lonely, but I know that will change when I finally get out into the real world.  I'm sure these feelings will resurface from time to time, but I'm hopeful that with therapy it will be very infrequent."

exjw,3dskp5,ziddina,2,Sun Jul 19 10:54:09 2015 UTC,"First of all, welcome to the board.  When you feel comfortable posting your story, please do so - we've read a number of horrific stories & haven't thought them to be ""trolls"".  If you're only around 17 - 18 years old, then your life isn't ruined - think about the people on here like me, who didn't get out until we were 30 years old - or even older.  Watchtower dogma is pretty flimsy; your comments here:   My question is, why doesn't anyone (active jws warned with that line) realize that it cant be possible because there are steps/events missing in order for ""Armageddon"" to come through, otherwise ""jehovah"" failed (big surprise there) again by bringing Armageddon immediately without those events truly happening.    It's a good objection.  Clearly you've been critically examining the Watchtower Society's blather for a LONG time, & you're smart enough (very smart) to have been able to use their own teachings against their efforts at controlling people with fear tactics.  That is exactly what you were subjected to, and you're absolutely correct in your statement:   But are the jws really being ignorant....or are they afraid of saying anything because of what happened to me?   Trust me, with the bullying behavior I've seen elders use & have heard about from other ex-JWs, plus the blatantly clear intimidation & fear-mongering in the Watchtower propaganda, it's largely that most JWs are operating in a fear-induced haze of compliance. [edit to finish sentence]  I suspect that one might even be able to make a game out of ""Spot the Watchtower Bullying & Fear-Mongering in THIS Week's Study Article!""  At any rate, I'm sorry to hear that you have ADHD, but I suspect that may be partially a result of your JW upbringing.  Are you still in school?  Public, or home-schooled?  If you're in a public school, you might get some help from your school counselors, once you've explained to them that you're being pushed into the Watchtower Society religion (sect/cult) against your will.  Don't be afraid of posting here - just don't post anything that is so revealing (actual city & state, names, addresses) that someone could figure out who you are.  I'm looking forward to hearing more from you!"

Well, tldr: conflict with owners, court got involved, corrupted firm assigned to case declared bankruptcy (which is absurd, we had HEAPS of money from the jobs we did, apart from spacex, we worked for aerospace, commercial, medical, government, military, and so on kinds of companies)  Sonny got accused of embezzling, prohibited from entering the premises,  Firm assigned their own temp president to run the company while the case is being dealt with, Temp president didnt know shit, needed me to help him run the company, Got my own office, asked me what needs to be done,  Dirty looks from veterans and others Wow tldr my ass...  Its a fucking long story. Well i never imagined in my life that i would be such in a position for this responsibility but i had a choice either working with spaceX, or sticking around helping the company stay on its feet while the case ends. The manager from spacex, had a friend, or a friend of his friend (not really sure he was not very clear about that) interested in buying the company. We had rare cnc machines that were hard to find, which made the company valueable. SpaceX relied on us, and would lose a ton of money if we were to liquidate. Anyways, the inspector was supposed to work with the spaceX manager, but at this point nobody did shit since they realized theres no point if were shutting down. He was pissed. Wow, actually, im gonna post my story. This is way to fucking long. Tldr again   helped out inspector Impressed of what i could do, wanted me at spaceX  handed me business card, asked me to send resume got asked by temp president and spacex owner to give tour to interested buyer (temp thought i didnt know shit about the cnc machines or CAD/CAM programming, thinking i wouldnt be able to get buyers interest since ive only been here for 1 1/2 years; even if hes supposedly supposed to keep the company on its feet, but at the same time avoiding progress, in favor of the firm) Buyer asked for my number Later that day, gave me a call telling me he has him and his lawyers fighting to buy the company, asked me to help him keep doing what im doing and if it goes well im awarded a dann good pay and VP.  had a choice of going to spacex or keeping the company stay up on its feet until the judge decides what to do. Decided to stay to help employees keep their job, even after they treated me like shit mom interfered ruining everything since she didnt get credit for anything (forgot to mention shes been the production supervisor for 15 years in the company, recommended me since i didnt know what to do with my\ fucking life, got hired as a driver, eventually all this is taking place, she found another job but didnt quit, instead claimed she took a 3 week vacation waiting for company to shutdown for workers comp, i took over, shes heard whats goin down, complained that im not qualified to to any management, told me if i dont mention her and her hard work [she did work hard, but did such a horrible job. All the jobs were always late, but low pay + job finished = benefit for sonny]) to the new buyer im a bad son. So i did EVEN WHEN SHE WASNT WORKING THERE ANYMORE. and im fuckin tired of helping people cause it got me FUCKING NOWHERE, shes more focused on her cult so she never did pay attention on what the buyer was asking for that needs to be done.  made me do what the buyer was asking for (WHY THE FUCK DID U WANT TO INTERVENE IF UR NOT GONNA DO SHIT GODFUCKINGDAMMIT) Makes me look like a fucking dumbass. (E.g. buyer wanted a meeting with all employees and his managers + people from the court as the final step to give the buyer the approval to buy the company. Mum tells me to handle it, since i had all the employees numbers and needed to.be contacted (ive had their info with their permission since the beginning since the buyer asked me to help him with the procedure and i had to inform everyone that theres a chance we'll survive, if you're willing to stay give me your contact info to keep you updated and your job secure) and i handed her the contacts info after they gave me the green light of passing their info to her (they all knew her so it was easy).  She says me she has no time, she has to preach.  I should stop being lazy and handle this situation. Tells me that the buyer wants to have meeting at round table pizza at 11 am saturday All the employees show up after give them info about the meeting, time and place. 11:20 i get a call.  an employee asks me if the address correct because no ones here, and we've been sitting at these tables we merged for a while, and havent bought anything. Were getting weird looks, are you or (mom) or (buyerl almost here? Me:Wait what? (Mom) isnt there?!?!? Emp: No dude, (3 employees) are about to leave. Me: fuck Fuck FUCK. Give me a second ill call you back. call buyer, ask him to confirm if we were supposed to meet him at round table, 11 am responds with ""no, what? Are you kidding me? There must of been a misunderstanding. I said at (the company) at 4:00 pm. Is everyone (employees) there? Yea, i was instructed by (mom) to tell them to meet up (pizza, 11 am) buyer: ""oh wow. Ok. Please tell them to stick around. Im in a meeting right now, please i need them to stay to get a positive review from (court people). ""ill try my best"" Hang up, scream to the top of my lungs, go to liquor store, buy tequila, drink it straight up, 11:30 am.   To be continued this is too fucking long. This is like 3% of my fucking pathetic life. But this is like the only part of my life that was going to keep me go on. The only silver lining. The only reason i can stop trying to kill myself with meth and alcohol. But i cant get a break. Especially when my narcissistic family interfere with my life. Ill post my story, but it might take a while. I typed all this on my phone, and its a pain in the ass. My laptop is infected (dma attack) and until i get that fixed ill share my experiences with you/you guys.   P.S. after studying and researching pen test, network security, computer security, i cant find a solution to this dma attack. And for sure im getting redirected by the malware avoiding anything with keywords that relate getting rid of the malware. If anyone has any solutions, please help."

She will and continues to love her religion more than anyone, even family.

exjw,3dtf8o,puppetseesthestrings,8,Sun Jul 19 12:03:34 2015 UTC,"Hi, You remember back when you first asked for advice on your relationship with a JW and the consensus was, don't date a Jw because she won't leave them, she'll dump you and break your heart?  And that advice turned out to be true  Well I second the advice so far, to move on. You won't save her from the cult. The only person who can save her, is herself and she have to come to her own realisation in her own time. The more YOU try, the more she'll throw on the armour and see that as an outright attack from satan; from her jw viewpoint she cleansed herself of bad habits (you) and got closer to God.. Therefore satan will try harder right now to get her back. In their twisted view, you are satans tool and that's how she and her JW friends and elders will see you. You are on a hiding to nothing, sorry. Attempts from you to get her to see TTATT will only have the total opposite effect, she'll dig in deeper.  Start thinking about your future and getting out there and meeting girls. Relegate your jw ex to memories and experience and move forward.  I know it all hurts but one thing I have learned from experience is relationships don't need to be.. Shouldn't be.. Complicated or difficult. You don't need drama or obstacles to overcome. Martyrdom doesn't make your love stronger or purer. Just find someone you want to be with, who wants to be with you, no complications and enjoy yourselves!"
exjw,3dtf8o,MrsQuinners,6,Sun Jul 19 08:34:47 2015 UTC,"You're right. She is throwing her life away. She needs to realize that she is in a high control group.  It's the noble thing to try and help her get out. Facts probably won't work, but you can try JWFacts. You could also show her the news videos that reported on Candace Conti and the many cases of child abuse. The PBS video is particularly damning.  Do what you can, but realize that it may not be possible to wake her up. Most require some personal experience to wake up."
exjw,3dtf8o,tim3l0rd,5,Sun Jul 19 12:27:28 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend reading the Helping Someone Leave part of JWFacts.com If she is WILLING to look at JWFacts it might help her, but most active JWs absolutely will not look at anything that contradicts their beliefs.   You might also want to consider reading this book: Combating Cult Mind Control  Realize though that you are up against a cult that has been brainwashing her for years, so it probably won't be easy to get her to leave. If you make it obvious you don't agree with the JW beliefs, she may become a robot parroting JW talking points without being willing to listen to you if you push her too hard.   The best you might be able to hope for would be to try to plant some seeds now that may only end up leading her to get out years down the road."

I was later told I needed to marry this man, I was 15 he was 19. I knew I didn't want to marry him but I said I would because everyone said I had to.

On my other side a woman sister with children married my uncle who also had children. She went on to abuse his kids, forcing one to live in the laundry room. The other kids eventually were old enough to leave the house but every one originally just blamed them for being unruly teens. It wasn't until my uncle left and confessed all the cruel things this woman was doing would anyone believe me.  I also remember being at an assembly. I walked into the bathroom and saw a sister beating her toddler viscously. She was beating him and by the time I went to the bathroom and was leaving she was still full force beating this boy. People were just ignoring it. I went back to my seat and told my mom. She just shook her head in disapproval but did nothing.

Also, he has clearly accepted adaptation as something real. From a JW point of view, this is an icy patch.

exjw,3dqh5u,ziddina,9,Sat Jul 18 15:40:41 2015 UTC,You could try and insulate them against some of the fear tactics.  The WT wants people to believe that God will destroy them if they leave.

Suggest that reading Russell's books can be spiritually strengthening since Russell was obviously guided by God.  You can show how today's watchtower points the ""fact"" that JWS pointed to 1914 some 40 years prior... Let the studies read these facts themselves from Russell's books.  Maybe you can find Russell's books at your KH's library that you can lend them to your a study who is most studious and free thinker.   I always suggest Thy Kingdom Come book, that's a classic IMO.  If not, maybe they can find a pdf on the net.  Another suggestion is, point out that opposers lie regarding wts but since wts isn't a cult it's good for newly interested ones to prove to themselves that wts is true by examining some of these apostate lies since it's not logical to join a group simply by hearing one side without doing thorough research on the group even if they have to examine what the opposer have to say.

Just don't present it as an absolute truth. Keep it academic. After all, you don't need to agree with Catholicism to study it and come to an understanding of what it claims.  For example, instead of saying that this information comes from Jehovah, say it comes from the Governing Body. When talking about the Governing Body, instead of saying that Jehovah appointed them, say that they appointed themselves or that they claim to be appointed by Jehovah or that JW's believe that they were appointed by Jehovah. Instead of talking about the JW version of history as if it were factual, make it clear that this is what the NWT or Watchtower says happened.  Also, maybe try to encourage critical thinking. See if you can get them to ask penetrating questions. Don't reward them for just believing.  It's a tough situation to be in. Good luck."

As mentioned elsewhere in the comments, you then need to distinguish what is a parable, metaphor or other from the literal stories (the rich man in hell is a troubling one.)   The very first time I met with the Dubs they asked me about my views on the Bible, etc. I said that I had significant doubts about Jesus. With barely a pause he flipped open the Live Forever book and pointed to a picture of Jesus and Adam standing on a balancing scale and said that Jesus had to be real since he was the perfect equal to Adam! (Given that it's is now more than 30 years ago and I remember the event with such clarity just goes to show how astounded I was by that particular bit of logic.)

Charles Piazzi Smyth, the Astronomer Royal for Scotland, became convinced that the pyramid had been built not by the Egyptians but by an Old Testament patriarch (perhaps Noah) under divine guidance. As such, Smyth saw theological implications in just about every measurement of the Great Pyramid, including a calculation for the End of Days.  | Smyth’s research was satirized in a January 5, 1881, column in the New York Times: “In the great gallery of the pyramid… there are precisely eighteen hundred and eighty-one notches… hence if the pyramid is trustworthy and really knows its business, we have arrived at the last year of the earth. There are a vast number of people who believe in this remarkable theory of the pyramid, and they are one and all perfectly sure that the pyramid cannot tell a lie… in case they should happen to be disappointed and to be under the unpleasant necessity of making New Year’s calls in the snow on the First of January 1882, they will probably blaspheme the pyramid and lose all faith in man and stones.”  I wonder who was first to get into the Great Pyramid as a source of values for numerology."

He also was compiling the cong book study attendance reports to send in to bethel the next day. He was asked to take over for the previous secretary  and too many reports were missing.  He was getting more & more frustrated. Missing book study attendance cards, publishers not handing in fs reports (including ones we both worked with in fs that month).  He had been a very violent guy decades earlier, before becoming a witness and got into a lot of fights. He was still a tough guy but said that he ""had not put his hands on a brother in 20 years"".  He was retyping pub record cards on a real old typewriter ( no computers in 1986!) and got more frustrated. He asked me to find a brothers book study attendance report-it was missing -and that elder had gone away on vacation.   This elder was strictly by the book and would not make up numbers.  He started banging the  desk and the typewriter moved closer and closer to the window. Finally he was going to throw it out the window and all I did was say "" (brother) calm down"". And I was respectful, I felt very close to this brother.  Well that was it! He got livid and grabbed me by the neck, pushed me up against the closet door and lifted me with one hand. Then choked me using both hands. It seemed he would never let go- I kept praying to Jehovah, all I wanted to do was breathe!  I briefly  blacked out, and then  realized my feet were on the ground but his hands were still around my throat as if he could not loosen his grip.  Finally he let go- it seemed like forever.

I heard a noise & looked over to see this golden-haired 12-year-old child with her hands wrapped around her 12-year-old black girl friend's throat.  She was choking the poor black child & was slamming her head into a support pillar!  Naturally I raced over to break it up, & after I'd gotten the blonde brat off of her now-ex-friend, & was asking the poor black kid if she was okay, I heard my vapid JW mother's voice behind me, declaring,   ""Oh, here's Ziddina - playing with the kids as usual!""  The incident had happened right after a meeting; there must have been at least 20 adults standing around in knots of conversation, but NOT ONE OF THOSE DAMNED, STUPID ADULTS DID ANYTHING TO STOP THE BLONDE FROM CHOKING THE OTHER CHILD!!  To this day, I still shake my head over that incident - showed how stupidly blind people can be, when they're following an imaginary deity that proclaims itself as ""loving"" while killing off nearly everyone on the planet - twice, if one counts ""Armageddon""..."

Prior to 1975-1976 the Watchtower Society was claiming membership increases in the double-digit percentages; after 1975 the only time they even came CLOSE to those numbers was in 1994 - 1995.  Since then, they've pretty much flat-lined."

The Kingdom Halls belong to Jehovah and, just in case you even thought about taking a different viewpoint, remember that we are all of one mind. Quashes ideas before they can be fully formed.   It's an interesting time for the organisation and I think the article gets it about right: the organisation itself is struggling but we can't forget the millions of members who recognise the shortcomings but more readily believe in the 'where else would we go?' line of thinking promoted by the society.   There has been a real shift over the last decade or so and I often wonder what my ex family makes of all this. The organisation is now just that: an organisation first and foremost. Gone are the heady days of 'food at the proper time'; now we have vacuous magazines and a monthly broadcast.   With the Lennon and McCartney (Franz and Knorr) of the GB well gone and replaced by a bumbling Stock, Aitken and Waterman (Lett, Morriss and Jackson) instead this was bound to happen. (Sorry, I couldn't resist amusing myself with that comparison.) Those prima donnas bear a great deal of the responsibility for the decline.

They're smart enough to avert a financial collapse - which is exactly why we've been seeing all those changes in the past few years. They're sitting on more than enough assets, but there simply wasn't enough cash flow coming in from them, and that's what they've been changing. They may have (had) issues with liquidity, but certainly not with solvency.  Now, Cedars's point is that visible downsizing (as in a sell-off of assets) wouldn't go down well with JWs. But consider this, all the major branch closures seemed to be a quite spectacular change, yet rank-and-file JWs just don't seem to care. At least I don't see any indication of that looking at the statistics of the affected countries. Same goes for the Brooklyn bethel move - they've been able to spin this into a positive new development, just as they've managed to spin the whole ""100 years and no Armageddon in sight"" problem into a jubilant anniversary of sorts."

There is an elder training video that goes through the motions of a sample case and I think it's reasonably close to what you can expect.   http://jwsurvey.org/cedars-blog/doubts-over-organizational-solidarity-as-disturbing-video-on-handling-suicide-is-leaked  (Ignore the title. The bit about disfellowshipping is also included.)  If you want to walk away respectfully then meet with them as arranged, tell them factually what has happened and little more. Let them know it really doesn't bother you as much as you might have expected (this will get their attention and leave them no choice but to give you the tattoo. Don't worry - it's in invisible ink and only can be seen under the UV lights they mount just near the entrance doors to the KH.)  It can be as nasty or as pleasant as you want it. But, as others have noted, you also have the option to just not go. Honestly, if you're going to be leaving for good then don't even play their game.

However in my short time browsing this sub-Reddit & getting to know some of you; I've come to the belief that a large percent of born-ins are ill-equipped for some of the basic, pragmatic functions of a life that you don't expect to end in Armageddon.  A lot of ex-JW born-ins talk about being stuck in dead-end jobs (because of lack of job skills or just not knowing how to get a better job), getting into too much debt (because they were never taught how to budget or reign in impulse spending), or getting stuck in relationships that they later regret.  I know it sounds trite but if a fader started planning, say 6 months or a year ahead of time, they could probably save themselves a world of difficulty.  Even if the fader couldn't save money, couldn't apply to college, couldn't make non-JW friends, they might be able to research these things and put together the framework of a plan.  Heck the faders who are here on /r/EXJW could work with you folks who have been out for a while on their post-fade plans.  You guys have learned A LOT the hard way and could help them with solid (and wordly) advice."

Attached to the letter was S-60 form with detailed instructions on which publications should be discarded. Probably the most shocking one is that ""New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures"" (bi7) should be discarded if no one wants to pick it up. So when churches in medieval times were burning Bibles it was not ok, but when WTS burns their own Bibles it is ok.  Also, a bit of trivia: english version of this letter talks about ""discarding"" publications. In polish version of this letter, they use the word ""destroy"", instead of ""discard"", which suggests that you should not only get rid of them (like throw them out to garbage can) but actually burn/shred them."

exjw,3dn97n,Robert_Zero,4,Fri Jul 17 19:01:49 2015 UTC,"Some people are assholes, JW's or not. Being a JW doesn't make you an asshole by default.  I would be careful about laying blame at JW feet, because it's possible he might just fall back to using that as an excuse in one breath while continuing his behavior in the next and then demand you cut him some slack because JW's fucked him up. On some level he has to take responsibility for himself and get his shit together and providing him an avenue to protect his ego and deflect responsibility will just enable him. Don't be an enabler.  My Dad was abusive, had unrealistic expectations of us, unfair, and so on the surface would seem to have some overlap in behaviors. But he wasn't raised as JW, he got involved a few months before I was involved. But he was abused as a kid and then he ended up being a prison guard in a high security prison which just broke his brain. In a lot of ways he just had a hard life. And he was always making excuses and setting arbitrary points in time where he was wrong to do the things he had done, but now things were different and it was all us. He just had problems, wasn't able to take care of them, or handle his shit. It wasn't the JW's, it was him.  I very much doubt my Mom married him as he was, he was probably on his best behavior and once they were married and their lives intertwined and familiarity reaches a zenith it's hard to keep a nice guy act up perpetually, those true colors are going to show up eventually. And once they show, no reason to keep pretenses up, this is just how it is now.   I doubt your husband ""changed"", I think he just stopped running the ad campaign that you bought into before you got married.  It doesn't matter if his JW upbringing tells him this behavior is OK. It's not and he's the one doing it. He needs to fix it. He need to get with the program. He's a grown ass man and responsible for his actions. Has he been living in a cave, what makes him think this is alright behavior? It's only that he's gotten away with it for so long, the precedent has been set and that makes it OK. And no one around is in a position to tell him what is actually what."

No doubt he has suffered alot of criticism and judgement thru out his experience. To sum up the social and political aspect of JW's is CO-DEPENDENCY. Maybe if you could do some research on that you have help him better. My experience with my hubby for 6 years (exjw) has been he doesn't care to read or talk about feelings. But I read this book, ""Language of Letting Go"", by Melody Beattie. It changed my life. It's intended use is for those in recovery. So when I read it, I said that i'm not an addict.

exjw,3dn97n,Robert_Zero,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:33:11 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go out on a limb here and take a guess at what I think is going on; no judgement intended.   He has issues or concerns which he thinks are very important and thinks that you are not taking seriously. Or, he would say that he has tried to bring them up but you are touchy about it and do not want to discuss o dismiss it. He finds it difficult to express himself in this situation and will shut down instead of trying to pursue the discussion. You both feel not listened to. But he feels cornered by his unaddressed concern combined with fear of losing you. His feelings oscillate between ""so nice"" and feeling locked in to a dead end situation.   Re. the socks, his reaction is telling you ""[the sky is falling (for me)] ...... why t.f. are we worring about [socks]?   I am going to go out on a second limb and say that if you asked him was anything wrong you would not get to the root of what is truly bothering him. It is a big danger for him that he has no friends. It is not common for males to discuss their relationships. But when they do friends are the ones that bring them back in to line and get the correct perspective.  I'm going to go out on a third limb here and say to take care on the type of counselling you get. A counsellor that wants to help you with the techniques of interacting (communicating, set boundaries etc) he will dismiss as not addressing the real problem. Strongly suggest that he first needs someone to talk to openly. In absence of friends that needs to be a counsellor - but one that is prepared to do this. That is, talk about the details of the issues rather than how you might manage them."

I'd pay ~$160, 170 for a body scrub. You go to the Korean spas and pay about half that for a much better scrub (since you're naked, they scrub EVERYTHING) and a massage.   I used to go there with my girls as often as possible.

From what I understand, if a bethelite buys something from the commissary, he uses his ID card and the amount gets subtracted from his next month's allowance. Am I correct?  If Marcus bought food from the commissary and would not be there  the next month he would receive no allowance for them to take it from.  Could this be why Marcus was billed?  I had read once that a bethelite who was let go , had his airline tickets for his flight home paid for by bethel.  Now, there could be favoritism, yes.  But are we getting the whole, unbiased story of what happened?  Bethel SHOULD at least provide those asked to leave with a ride/transportation home.  But what if after many years at Bethel they no longer have a place to go? Bethel should arrange for members of a congregation to help him find a place or take him in and help him find work.  Do they sign the vow with the understanding that if/when asked to leave bethel they will receive no assistance or help in any way?  At least too, they could give him a good letter of recommendation for his years of faithful service and list his skills and how he benefited bethel to help him get a job.  Most places have the same idea ""What happens here, stays here"" and don't want anyone reporting on wrongdoing.

However, this also means that the companies have high amounts of churn - meaning they ALSO lose the employees who have acquired some experience with that particular company's system, only to have to re-train yet another new person.  That amounts to quite a drain on a company's time & efficiency.  However most companies seem to lack management with sufficient intelligence to realize this fact.  I'm eagerly waiting for an old-timer from Bethel to finally become so disgusted with the direction Watchtower is taking (combined with being treated as something to be thrown away like a used-up tissue) to spill ALL the dirt they've seen at Bethel &/or other Watchtower headquarters locations."

I wanted to strengthen my faith by building a foundation on ""our rich spiritual heritage.""  I began by reading the old Zion Watchtowers, Golden Age and Consolation.  Then onto Charles T Russel's books.  Rutherford. The Proclaimers book didn't even hint or scratch the surface of what I discovered.   Talk about a white-washed version of JW history.  When I discovered the misquote in the January Awake, I fully awakened. I was literally (yes, literally) sick to my stomach and my head was swimming.   It was when I fully understood that JW's are really no different from other religions that I started reading things that are considered off-limits.  The elder's book was the first, followed by JWFacts, JWSurvey and then Crisis of Conscience.  I can honestly say that what uncovered the realities of the ""Truth"" was reading only 100% WT publications and seeing the history of this religion evolve over the past 120+ years.

He was really searching to see if this was the truth (he was never baptized).  He kept asking some things and we went back and forth for a while.  By the time the January misquote happened, I was still not doubting anything other than maybe a few strict rules about beards and birthdays.  After the Awake, I knew I needed to research to see how many other misquotes the WBTS has been guilty of and if I have been lied to all my life.  Found the rabbit hole and fell through.  Read the Flock book and then Ray's book.  Now I'm fully awake but still in and helping my wife wake up, I hope.

They quoted Ramah Singh in such a way that it sounded like he supported their position on evolution. When he found out and wrote the WBTS, they removed it from the online English Awake! but left it in other languages (at least the last time I checked several languages still had the quote). I quickly found a paper copy of the Awake! and am keeping it to possibly show how they revise their own history to others.  Ramah had asked that they remove the quote and apologize. They did the first, but no apology and no notation in future magazines that they removed the quote. Very 1984 (good book) and definitely destroyed my trust in what they wrote."

I fought to convince myself that I was doing the right thing. He was raised in a strong witness family (on the surface) but at home it was a house of horrors. But i still didn't see it coming. My social pressures were on me and he could careless if his friends stick around. He's nice to the older sisters that come to the door but refuses to speak to an elder...

In this case, it is traveling 9 hours each way to visit - they could not do it before retirement, because they started a crappy cleaning business 7 nights a week, and now their health is shit-poor - in part due to the night-shift work and doing too much during the day.

Depending on your field, your financial aid office will approve you for amounts that may be well above what you can realistically pay off. Rule of thumb is to never borrow more than your expected starting salary. You probably already knew that. But, I thought I would put it out their just in case.  I funded my undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering using a mix of scholarships, part time work (internships), and student loans. My graduate studies in aerospace engineering was mostly funded by working as a graduate research assistant. After becoming a doctoral candidate I was able to land a real job. Now, I'm finishing the PhD part time.  University is a wonderful way to reboot your life after leaving the Org. Everyone you meet will be experiencing a reboot of their social lives. This means that you'll be surrounded by people looking to make new friends. Also, your studies will really deepen your understanding of the world around you and sharpen your critical thinking skills.  Good luck and enjoy the journey!"
exjw,3dlal2,caseyoc,2,Sat Jul 18 02:15:18 2015 UTC,"Im planning on taking out a loan and putting it in a savings account. Then I play to transfer the money out into my checking as I need it. Mostly for the things like rent or stuff. I then plan to put money into that savings account (part time job probably) to pay it off. I wont be able to make enough money to have a place to live and eat without my schooling suffering. If I remember correctly, loans are expected to start collecting interest a year after you finish your schooling."
exjw,3dlal2,ThrowAwayToGehenna,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:55:11 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, loans are expected to start collecting interest a year after you finish your schooling.    It depends on the type of loan. If it's a federal subsidized loan, then yes. Otherwise, the loan begins to accumulate interest the moment you receive the money. Furthermore, if it's a private loan, then the accumulated interest, if unpaid, will be added to the principle (i.e. the interest will be capitalized).  Federal loans are relatively safe, as they are highly regulated. Private loans, on the other hand, are less regulated and can be somewhat unpredictable. For example, during my first year of undergraduate I took out a private student loan from Citibank. Then, while I was in grad school and my loans were supposed to be in deferment, suddenly I got a letter from Discover stating that they were now my lender and that I must immediately begin repayment on my student loan.  I'm not saying that you shouldn't take out loans, nor am I suggesting that you should feel bad if you do. For sure, if the only way you can attend college is to borrow, then do it. The point is to be aware of the long term implications and risks associated with student loans. There are a lot of young people who are borrowed too much and are now facing serious trouble. For more info on student loans see here. I hope this helps."

If you want to pay off a loan, give the money directly the lender and see if you can apply it to the principle. Don't let it sit in a savings account. Your debt will accumulate interest at a far greater rate than money sitting your savings account. A good student loan is around 3-4%, whereas a savings account is a meager 0.05%. The obvious exception being if the loan is subsidized AND your loan is in deferment. Maybe that's what you were thinking."

The reason JWs hold to 607 BC is because of an early interpretation of a prophecy that pointed to 1914 AD and started counting from 607 BC.  Then they mix that with an interpretation of another prophecy to say that Jesus chose them as the true religion in 1919. They have to resort to reasonable doubt, misquotes, and taking quotes out of context in order to justify the 607 BC dating. If they accepted the 587 dating that the rest of the world accepts, they would lose their claim as God's true organization."

If I suck, there's a video linked for you and you can just smile and thank me without even reading.  The 607 vs 587 is really the conflict between J-Dub Dogma (plus the bible inerrancy thing) and secular sources. Please please remember that BCE went backwards.  J-Dubs maintain that the Jews returned to their homeland in the first year of King Cyrus of Babylon's rule (537 BCE) after being taken out by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. By secular sources, this is true. BUT then J-Dubs take into account Daniel 9:1,2 where it states that Jerusalem lies desolate for 70 YEARS after being taken down by King Nebuchadnezzar, so if you count backwards, you get the fall of Jerusalem being 607 BCE. Then they do mental gymnastics and magic with numbers and say this points to 1914 being the year that Jesus becomes enthroned and HOLY SHIT WW1 the end is neigh it was prophesized!  (Funny side note: 1871 was the year I believe was put originally as Jesus being enthroned and 1914 was the armaggedon, not Jesus being enthroned again. That being said, don't take my word for 1871. I'm a bit dusty on it.)   BUT this whole 607 thing is not true, because secular sources maintain that 587 BCE was the year King N (sick of mispelling his name) took it down by written records the Babylonians and other civilizations had. King N couldn't have taken it down because he didn't start ruling until 605 BCE (years are counted backwards, remember.) So the governing body exerts its' authority on the wrong year because lol the bible can't be wrong about 70 years. (But it is.)  Here's a wiki on 587 and a video that proves 587 USING J-Dub sources. (Video is great. Just go for the video.)   And TTATT is ""The Truth About The Truth""  which is the facts that show ""the truth"" or the org isn't quite what it's cracked up to be."

exjw,3dmnt1,EarlofGroan,2,Fri Jul 17 17:06:34 2015 UTC,"or married for someone to support me   Wait, what?  They didn't allow single sisters to pioneer?  That's like the only ""privilege"" they qualify for."
exjw,3dmnt1,nycxyz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:22:18 2015 UTC,"They didn't want me to pioneer but they couldn't find no other reason I would disqualify. I was getting 70+ hours as an auxiliary, and in good standing, real active with the congregation. They just had a problem with me because of some inner congregation politics, and I was far from submissive. But I'm glad they didn't though. The major depression that came from being denied is probably what saved my life thinking back. It was the first time I ever missed meetings for several months, cutting off the indoctrination supply."
exjw,3dmnt1,Maiden_Sunshine,2,Sun Jul 19 04:26:06 2015 UTC,"I was reproved and removed as a pioneer.  It was a huge blow to my identity, but it gave me time to sit back and objectively look at the whole privilege scam.  The final push wouldn't come until a few years later, but it was definitely instrumental in helping me wake up.  Yay for not being allowed to pioneer!"
exjw,3dmnt1,nycxyz,3,Sun Jul 19 11:45:57 2015 UTC,"For the most part if a person is in good standings and puts in a steady number of hours, has a plan to put in pioneer hours, they they can pioneer.  The person does need to be approved to do so.  If this guy would be a burden to others for him to get his hours in (ie guy is broke, no car, needs to picked up and dropped off) they may not allow him to pioneer so as not to burden the current ones.  I know of one girl who wanted to pioneer, but didn't want to get a drivers license (we live in an area where you basically have to drive, small rural area)  until she got her license they wouldn't approve her."
exjw,3dmnt1,lrrc49,3,Fri Jul 17 15:36:00 2015 UTC,"they may not allow him to pioneer so as not to burden the current ones   I wish I had been in these congregations.  Often times I was one of the few pioneers with a decent job and decent car, so I would have to chauffeur everyone else around and not even get gas money for it."
exjw,3dmnt1,nycxyz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:24:43 2015 UTC,I didn't do much chauffeuring but I drove 90% of the time.  Typical monthly gas bill was 300 bucks.  I'm finding a high degree of variability in how things are run in a given hall.  Ironic being jws were always touted as doing everything the same world wide.
exjw,3dmnt1,lrrc49,3,Sat Jul 18 00:20:13 2015 UTC,"This guy has pretty much never had a job   This will be the main reason then. It's not well known but one of the requirements the elders look at to be a pioneer is someone who is deemed able to support him/herself monetarily without state support etc. Exceptions are made for those unable to work of course, but if you are in working shape in the UK for example you cannot be claiming Jobseekers allowance and be regular pioneering, or whatever the state equivalent is in the U.S.  It is true that being held back for past wrongdoing or simply not being bothered to apply are both valid but the above is the most obvious reason from what you have said.  Hope that helps!  Source: Ex Pioneer and Ministerial servant who asked more questions about the processes than he really ought to have."

Since Revelation is written somewhere around the end of the first century, the writer certainly could have seen both the Sadducees and the Pharisees as suck ups and sell outs to Rome.  Also as having beliefs that ran counter to early Christianity.  Unfortunately with Revelation it really takes a lot of patience, specialized knowledge, and patience to suss out what the metaphors & analogies might mean.  Perhaps this is why the WTBTS is so successful in fooling it's members that it knows & understands Revelation fully.  2) Your question is a little esoteric for a group of mostly atheists.  Maybe try posting this to some more academic, Christianity related sub-Reddit.  Why are you reading Revelation?"

exjw,3djpy1,strangequark_,12,Thu Jul 16 20:44:05 2015 UTC,"I agree with this 100%.  The instruction to ""Never suggest to anyone that they should not report an allegation of child abuse to the police or other authorities"" gives the impression of compliance. In reality, what this is saying is that the elders are NOT GOING TO SAY A WORD about contacting the authorities.  They will however counsel the victim and their parents about the severity of slandering their brother. They will give hypothetical examples of how one might slander their brother. It is a veiled threat.  If on the off chance the parent of the victim asks the elders whether or not they should contact the police (unlikely after being warned not to slander), the elders will say something to the effect of ""we will not stop you or tell you that you cannot. It is up to your conscience.""    However, the victim and their parents are being set up for a trap.  The moment they call the authorities, and word gets out, the family will be approached by the elders on the supposedly completely separate issue of slander. ""It has come to our attention that comments were made that have put brother X in a bad light. His name has been slandered.""  Why do you think all of the examples of child abuse in the news in recent years are of victims that came forward years later, as adults, often as ex jws? Because they were afraid of reprisal on a fucking technicality."
exjw,3djpy1,tazemanian-devil,2,Thu Jul 16 21:01:44 2015 UTC,"This is exactly the type of thing I wish more people would understand. It displays how corrupt policies can be behind the scenes in this organization. It's disgusting. They are not blameless. It's why I see those comments such as ""Well, they're wrong, but I won't speak against them"", ""They're just another religion,"" etc., as bullhonkey. Underhanded shit goes down behind the curtain all the time, especially anything that would involve money or bad publicity."
exjw,3djpy1,BustasGonnaGetNasty,7,Fri Jul 17 10:29:50 2015 UTC,"I remember being questioned by the elders about my father. It was after my mom took me to police, the lead detective was aware I may be questioned by them and told me I didn't have to answer their questions if I was uncomfortable. I was and I didn't. I was 5 and I was more scared in the back room then in the interview room."
exjw,3djpy1,TwinWonderMom,5,Fri Jul 17 02:30:01 2015 UTC,"To prove that JW's take is seriously, a family member proudly told me that the first thing an elder does is to call the branch.   I held my head in my hands and silently screamed.   Anyone who is reading this and is affected: CALL. THE. POLICE."
exjw,3djpy1,QuikBild,2,Thu Jul 16 21:32:04 2015 UTC,"I agree with issues 1, 2, and 4, but the courts have already decided that the congregation is not liable for not informing the congregation about a known child molester.  If they were, what other businesses could be held liable for the same thing?  Where would the courts draw the line?  If child molesters are turned over to police, this issue becomes somewhat moot because as more offenders are turned over to police more offenders will be on the registry of offenders.  Parents would be able to search the list to see if anyone in their congregation is on it.  Not that I'm taking the child molesters side or that I think that they are not predators, because most are, but some do change.  Murderers have changed and their past crimes are not announced everywhere they go.  I definitely think, though, that they should never be given any position of authority in the congregation as that would give them easier access to children.  I'd like to add that they need to change the policy of counseling or disciplining for gossip and slander if someone tell others about a child molester.  That also furthers the secrecy and ability for the molester to continue."
exjw,3djpy1,tim3l0rd,2,Thu Jul 16 21:24:03 2015 UTC,Weird considering what other businesses use children in their business? I would say that ALL businesses which use or shelter children have a legal duty to inform them of child molesters!

exjw,3djpy1,tazemanian-devil,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:48:52 2015 UTC,"I agree, but those that are not in positions of authority are basically ""customers"" so it changes the legal liability of the congregation."
exjw,3djpy1,tim3l0rd,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:01:39 2015 UTC,"Remember, JWs don't have child care or any activities directed towards children so they don't fit that description legally.  However, if the molester is an ""employee"" or in a position of authority, then some areas have laws that say they have to undergo background checks, but if he/she is not and ""employee"" or in any position of authority then it's not required.  This would mean that elders and servants would be required to have background checks done in those areas as they are considered ""employees"".  Looking at the congregation as a business, if someone does not have any authority, they are basically a customer.  Businesses are not required to inform other customers if they know of a customer that was convicted of molesting a child."
exjw,3djpy1,tim3l0rd,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:57:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah not legally but they let children get baptized and become ""ministers"", so they do have children be a part of the organization. Also, what if an elder knows a person is a child molester, leads a group out in field service, and allows a child to partner up with the molester without telling the parents? Is that legally guilty? Not a lawyer."
exjw,3djpy1,Quark86d,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:28:18 2015 UTC,"Actually, yes.  The recent court Conti case found the congregation liable because the elders did assign Candace to work with her abuser and the organization was liable because there was no direction from above to avoid that situation.

I don't know your mother, but in my own experience what I perceived as judgement was really misguided (read, VERY misguided) love. And remember that to you and I, they are just pamphlets. To her, it's God's voice.   TLDR: Hate the system, not the people who end up as collateral."
exjw,3dkklg,AdmiralMcSlayer,2,Sat Jul 18 06:18:20 2015 UTC,"You know what I am honestly tired of seeing posts like this.   Maybe I don't want to love someone who nearly succeeded in single-handedly destroying my childhood. Maybe I don't want to love someone who incited a decade's worth of self-loathing, desperation, and neurotic behavior because she taught me that love is something that can be yanked out from under you, even if it's the love of your own family. Maybe I don't give a flying fuck that she thinks it's God telling her to behave like a nasty raging bitch with no sense of respect for anybody because she doesn't have to abide ""wordly people."" I don't care if she treats me the way she does because she's been told that's how you love someone ""under Satan's influence."" I don't care what she's been told. I don't care that she's in a cult. She is an unacceptable person who I don't WANT to love. I'm better off NOT loving her or feeling any sort of emotional connection to her at all. I am not going to love someone who spent my early adolescent years completely destroying any sense of self-confidence I had because ""God doesn't want you to become conceited."" I am not going to love someone who started out telling me all my friends deserve to burn in Armogeddan simply for refusing to pick up a fucking Watchtower. I am not going to love someone who left me with a LIFETIME'S worth of untreated autism because she thought if she threw enough Watchtowers at the problem it would be okay. I am not going to love someone who manipulated and emotionally gaslighted me to get me to go to the hall because ""God needs to clean you out."" I am not going to love someone who spent an entire decade convincing me that I was inherently evil and nothing I ever did could be good because I wasn't a fucking Witness. I don't care what her reasoning is. I don't care what the cult did. I don't care if she thinks it's love. It was emotionally damaging and I don't HAVE to love her back just because she's the one who birthed me. Maybe I'd rather dedicate my love to the people who spent the past 9 years trying to undo her damage and behaving like actual, genuinely loving family to me who didn't give me all of the bullshit conditions to receiving love that she did. Maybe my dad's better off with three days of being able to live his own life without being criticized for EVERYTHING. Maybe we're all just better off without her around and I know that I am better off not trying to love her. I've tried. All it did was lead to heartache after heartache after heartache until I finally said fuck this and severed my emotional ties to her.  So will people stop telling me I should ""harbor no resentment"" towards the one person who managed to uproot my life and cause damage that I have no fucking clue will be repaired because ""but she was brainwashed!"" I don't give a FUCK."

As someone who struggled to let go of the anger, it's much better without it, I can promise you. Peace is a lovely thing. And forgiving your mother doesn't mean loving her, or having an active relationship. But the longer you stay angry, the more control the witnesses have. Good luck stranger, I hope you find the happiness you seek."
exjw,3dkklg,jordanwiththefade,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:53:14 2015 UTC,"I definitely share the sentiment.  Any random couple of schmucks can practise bad judgment/decision-making, drink their asses off & then screw like rabbits to shoot out tons of inbred lumps of flesh (see 19 Kids & Counting).  A person does not deserve respect for simply existing in a state of parenthood, but instead earns respect by owning up to their responsibility to provide protection, education, and to supply their child with the tools they need to be a functioning member of the greater society as a whole.  I think too many people, under the erroneous assumption that shooting out a child is some kind of god-ordained miracle, feel that parenthood automatically entitles them to special privileges (the respect of their child being one of them).   On a side note, I think this also extends in part to the ongoing debate about abortion.  A woman should have control of her body TYVM~   I think you are - for all intents and purpose - perfectly within your right to give your mom the finger and tell her to sod off.  Some people in this lifetime are just simply not healthy to be around.    At the same time, you have the responsibility to yourself to keep from being unhealthily consumed by the perception that she is the only/greatest evil in the world - she's not.  She, like the rest of us, is a tiny speck amongst the greater universe and shall eventually fade from existence.  One would hope that if you can eventually strike out on your own & she's no longer in a position to affect your life negatively, it will allow you to let go & achieve a greater clarity - meet new people, explore the world around you, live an amazing & healthy life, etc~  Your mother's craziness should not define who you are when it already defines her - strive to achieve greater things and define yourself as something more, in spite of what she's done to you."

These people are predators. They sneak up. They emotionally manipulate. They sell you on the idea.  The latest ""PSA"" (Thanks for talking down to us TOMO) implies that the child actually has a moral choice to make. That they have any control in the situation. Disgusting.  All this will do is add to the child's guilt after they've been victimized.  This is why I debate apoligist-esque comments. Because they give the impression that the org isn't flawed.

They retain the bulk of their membership by making sure they have no knowledge of the outside world, no social network, and no economic power outside of the cult.

This will be a bad analogy but it's what comes to mind at the moment: There really are any number of parents out there who've experienced the deaths of children by murderers, have seen them convicted and then put to death--been present to watch it happen.  The point is not to assign degrees of evil or levels of suffering but to highlight the need to give oneself permission to move on.  Is it more complicated than that in the moment(s?) Of course it is.  Yet, in the long run that's the goal.

The elder acted disgusted and went on how he couldn't believe that someone would even ask him that. &on&on&on. The study was in attendance.. she practically ran up the aisle with her head down. The elder was stuttering all over himself. Last they saw of her.

exjw,3dilgm,CaughtYourThrowaway,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:25:36 2015 UTC,Sort of. Satellites are in orbit because they are being pulled directly towards the earth's center.

If you imagine a (small) glob of water up there is no different to a satellite or any other space junk - it is going to orbit the earth.

The placebo effect is more pronounced when the subject knows they are being treated. When a medical study is done, lets say with treatment A, treatment B or placebo, persons in all 3 groups will report improvement; if there are enough persons in each group, then they can compare the percentages. Studies where the participants have physical measurements (often blood tests) done provide more complete information about how much each person is really better.

For example, we all want to live among peaceful, decent, and honest people, and that is what we experience among our spiritual brothers and sisters. Why are they this way? Because they dedicated themselves to Jehovah and promised to live by what he says in the Bible.   This implies that we are dependent on the Jehorganization not only for our eternal lives, but also our ability to be good people. Are you sometimes a peaceful, decent, and/or honest person? You didn't do that, the Jehorganization did, and you'd be totally hopeless without strict obedience to your god/abusers.  This article makes no arguments, scriptural or otherwise, that would support shunning someone who voluntarily leaves the congregation, or even one who is formally expelled from the congregation. Keeping the congregation clean? I'm not in the congregation. Protecting the Jehorganization's name? I don't represent the Jehorganization. Discipline? Never mind that shunning is more abuse than discipline, ""what do I have to do with judging those outside? Do you not judge those inside, while God judges those outside?"" I am outside.  And then they bring in the Prodigal Son. If someone sees the error of their ways, like the prodigal son, and gets reinstated, you should do like the father, who showers him with love upon his return. That settles it, right? Well no, because nothing remotely resembling disfellowshipping occurs in this story. The boy was not shunned. Getting shunned is not the same as running away. Disfellowshipping would be if the son broke some rule, begs forgiveness, and the man throws his son out of the house, saying: ""I don't think you're sorry enough. Six months from now, write me a letter begging to be let back in, and I'll think about it. Until then, you don't get talk to anyone in the family"".

IMO DFing does have it's place, imagine an unrepentant child molester. But instead of using it as a last resort they use it as a form of control.  Some of the problems are that the elders are not paid or at least subsidized. They have to go to meetings, field service, take care of their families and hold down a full time job. When would they possibly find time to do quality shepherding? Under the JW arrangement you are expected to reach out to become an elder. So if you want to be an elder it's a status symbol and if it isn't for you it's an obligation. Either way it isn't a calling. Elders do not have the proper training to deal with 90% of the issues they have to deal with. It is quite obvious that the self proclaimed FDS isn't qualified to deal with real life issues either."

If she's going to be at risk of losing her whole social circle, then by far her best course is to fade, rather than to formally disassociate herself or get disfellowshipped. See the Exit Guide. If she fades successfully, she might be able to salvage some family contact, although her devout friends will almost certainly scatter.  Exiting JWs have a common pattern of social problems — difficulty socializing, difficulty figuring out how to set goals, difficulty thinking in terms of the future.

I've told her about this subreddit, and she seemed to be interested in it, but she's never used reddit before and i still need to try to familiarize her with it.  I plan on having her read the exit guide, as i read it myself to try to acquaint myself with it.

This is very different from leaving a religion or just stopping to go to church.  The JW cult has many consequences. Her family might cut off all ties with her and they believe they're proving their loyalty to God by doing so.  You mentioned you're an atheist, which for some reason is the most common belief adopted by former JWs after leaving the cult. However, this will mean that you have different points of views.   It's important that you introduce her to a support forum such as this one or a website like jwfacts.com because she will see for herself that she was really into a cult and it's not the true religion they claim it is."

Second, the article is premised on something that appeared in an article from 1964.  Over 50 years ago.  The writer of the article is evidently unaware that for decades, when touching on the subject of wake, the Borg publications have specifically said that due to the trauma, women may be unable to scream even if they wanted to, and that such ones should not feel guilty or believe they somehow consented to the rape for not screaming and Jehovah knows and loves them.  This is really just pathetic.  It's fine to take issue in 2015 with views that were held by the Borg or society in general from decades past.

No man's opinion is expressed in The Watchtower. God feeds his own people, and surely God uses those who love and serve him according to his own will.

Watchtower 1957 Jun 15 p.370   Under the guidance of his holy spirit and on the basis of his Word of truth, Jehovah provides what is needed so that all of God's people may be ""fitly united in the same mind and in the same line of thought"" and remain ""stabilized in the faith."" (1 Cor. 1:10; Col. 2:6, 7) Surely we are grateful for Jehovah's spiritual provisions in these last days.

Therefore, a victim who was unable to scream but otherwise did all she could under the circumstances can leave matters in Jehovah’s hands"
exjw,3djs89,lufecaep,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:23:22 2015 UTC,"Wow.  the way you cherry picked that quote without providing the context reminds me of what the watchtower does to make it seem like scientists actually don't believe in evolution.  Here is some context:    *w03 2/1 Questions From Readers  In understanding the application of Deuteronomy 22:23-27, we must realize that this brief account does not cover all possible situations. For example, it does not comment on the situation where the attacked woman cannot scream because she is mute, unconscious, or paralyzed with fear or is forcibly prevented from screaming by a hand or tape over her mouth.However, since Jehovah is able to weigh all factors, including motives, he deals with understanding and justice in such cases, for “all his ways are justice.” (Deuteronomy 32:4) He is aware of what actually took place and of the efforts the victim put forth to fight off her attacker. Therefore, a victim who was unable to scream but otherwise did all she could under the circumstances can leave matters in Jehovah’s hands.—Psalm 55:22; 1 Peter 5:7.  Even so, some Christian women who have been attacked and violated are incessantly pained by feelings of guilt. In hindsight, they feel that they should have done more to prevent the incident from happening. However, instead of blaming themselves, such victims can pray to Jehovah, ask for his help, and have confidence in his abundant loving-kindness.—Exodus 34:6; Psalm 86:5.  Hence, Christian women who are presently coping with emotional wounds resulting from an encounter with a rapist can be confident that Jehovah fully understands the painful feelings they are dealing with. God’s Word assures them: “Jehovah is near to those that are broken at heart; and those who are crushed in spirit he saves.” (Psalm 34:18) Further help to cope with their trauma can come from accepting the sincere understanding and gentle support of fellow believers in the Christian congregation. (Job 29:12; 1 Thessalonians 5:14) Moreover, the victims’ own efforts to concentrate on positive thoughts will help them to experience “the peace of God that excels all thought.”—Philippians 4:6-9.    Also, how about we go back further:  *** g93 3/8 pp. 4-5 The Reality of Rape *** Rape myths create a false sense of security. In other words, if you can find some fault in the victim’s behavior—she dressed in tight clothing or she went out alone at night or she really wanted to have sexual relations—you or your loved ones will be safe if that conduct is avoided; therefore you will never be raped. The alternative, that rape is a senseless act of violence that can happen to anybody, regardless of how she is dressed, is too terrifying to accept. One woman, raped by someone she thought of as “nice, respectable,” pleads: “The worst possible thing you can do is believe it won’t happen to you.” Rape Myths and Realities The following are some of the long-held misconceptions about rape that serve to blame the victim and to perpetuate attitudes that encourage the perpetrators: Myth: Rape happens only when a woman is attacked by a stranger. Fact: The majority of women who are raped are assaulted by someone they know and had trusted. One study found that 84 percent of victims knew their attackers and that 57 percent of the rapes happened on dates. One out of 7 married women will be raped by her own husband. Rapes are violent and emotionally traumatic whether the attacker is a stranger, a spouse, or a date. Myth: It’s rape only if a woman afterward shows evidence of resistance, such as bruises. Fact: Whether they physically resisted or not, few women show visible evidence, such as bruises or cuts. Myth: A rape victim bears part of the blame unless she actively resists. Fact: Rape by definition takes place when force or the threat of force is used to gain sexual penetration, of any kind whatsoever, against a person’s will. It is the rapist’s use of force against an unwilling victim that makes him a rapist. Thus, a rape victim is not guilty of fornication. Like an incest victim, she may be forced to submit to an act she doesn’t want because of the perceived power held over her by another person. When a woman is forced to submit to a rapist out of terror or disorientation, it does not mean that she consents to the act. Consent is based on choice without threat and is active, not passive. Myth: Rape is an act of passion. Fact: Rape is an act of violence. Men rape, not solely for sex, but to feel power over another person. Myth: A woman can tease or lead a man on to the point that he can no longer control his sexual urges. Fact: Men who rape do not have a stronger sex drive than other men have. Rather, one third of all rapists were unable to complete the sex act. In most cases rapes are planned acts, not spontaneous urges. Both stranger and acquaintance rapists usually set up their victims—the stranger by stalking the victim until she is alone, the acquaintance by arranging a situation where she is isolated. Myth: Women lie about rape to get revenge on a man or because they feel guilty about having sex. Fact: False reports of rape occur at the same rate as for any other violent crime: 2 percent. On the other hand, researchers agree that rape is grossly underreported. Myth: A woman can “ask” to be raped by wearing provocative clothing, drinking alcohol, letting a man pay her way, or going to his home. Fact: Using bad judgment, being naive or ignorant, does not mean that a woman deserves to be raped. Rapists bear sole responsibility for the rape.  So, back to my original post, that entire article, while justifiably expressing disgust with a 50 year old article, does not reflect what the org has been teaching for decades."
exjw,3djs89,Truthdoesntchange,2,Fri Jul 17 02:11:45 2015 UTC,"If I am not mistaken you said ""at least acknowledge when those ridiculous beliefs have progressed"" Yet you are trying to use an article older than the one I quoted to make a point about their current views. Your article is also from an Awake which doesn't carry the same weight as the WT.  I stand by my quote, the full article  does nothing to dispel my opinion. The tone of the article is that the woman has to act in a WT approved way to be free from guilt. I will agree that they toned it down a bit, they now allow a few excuses as to why she might not have been able to scream."
exjw,3djs89,lufecaep,0,Fri Jul 17 12:38:02 2015 UTC,"""Paralyzed with fear"" isn't an excuse.  It's a Common, well known, documented, response as to why many rape victims don't resist the attack at all.  And often, because of their lack of outward resistance, they feel guilty.  This is not just JWs, it's women everywhere, which is why there are so many secular articles on the subject by actual professionals.    Your article was hack job which, didn't just ignore the complete picture, but deliberately omitted facts which would have presented a more rounded and accurate picture.

However, you're doing it because you care about him, and you are afraid your parents are going to do or say something hurtful to him, all while being well-meaning about it (thoughtless, but well-meaning.)  Hell, maybe even have him read your post here. Give him a rundown on how JW's tend to behave and think. Explain that your parents are members of a very high-control religion (if you don't like the word cult) and their thoughts are shaped by that.  Or, could you be panicking over nothing? Could your parents treat him respectfully and kindly in person, only talking about their concerns with you later on? If they have really accepted that you don't believe as they do and they understand your viewpoint, then perhaps it won't be as bad as you fear.  Regardless, your boyfriend should know that things might get a bit weird or awkward. That doesn't change how you feel about him, and honestly it wouldn't be the first time in-laws had a strained relationship with their child's chosen partner.

I explained to him that any judgment she may cast wasn't personal and that he just needed to be his awesome self and show what a good guy he was.

You can be up-front: ""I don't agree with the rule about not dating, so I am going to date."" But I am going to recommend that you sneak around, at least at the beginning. One reason is that you don't know that this new romance will last. But more important is to delay the confrontation, because the older you are, the better your position.   You should do what you can to prepare to be independent. Get a job if you can, and save some money; it is no one's business how much you make or have saved, so ""theocratic warfare"" says you should lie, so that you have money they don't know about. From what you have written, you are likely to lose contact with your brothers when you finally escape, so you are worried about the relationship with your mother? You know better than anyone else how likely it is that she will shun you over dating or over leaving.   Take it slow with the young lady. Guys tend to think they are more in love than the gals at the beginning."
exjw,3dkj8t,lescannon,2,Fri Jul 17 01:07:35 2015 UTC,"As someone who used to date a lot behind my parents back, please be careful. I believe you can make this relationship last. You have to remind her that you are willing to be with her by breaking their rules."
exjw,3dkj8t,CelestelRain,2,Fri Jul 17 03:30:03 2015 UTC,"Stop the studies, stop wasting your time with the JWs and get on with your own life. I would seek an education first and foremost. It is the most valuable and useful thing you can have.  Be with your girlfriend, but at 17 don't get too serious and start thinking that she is the one and you'll be with her for the rest of your life. It is highly unlikely that you will be. You are going to change a lot, mentally as well, in the next few years, so it's best to have fun and play the field. Don't do anything stupid like get her pregnant.   Don't ever get baptised. Ever.  If your mother shuns you it is her that is in the wrong, and for simply being a young lad enjoying himself and discovering the exciting world of women, she'll be doing something wicked and terrible if she does. If she isn't active then she will be being hypocritical."

exjw,3digoa,ziddina,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:47:58 2015 UTC,"GOOD point.  Staying at home until ""reinstatement"" may be a condition of the elders' attempts to force him back in - I mean, ""godly discipline"".  However, if that's what it takes to be reinstated (but I'd be working, saving money, attending at least community college during that year/couple of years, if I were you), then do it.  As tim3l0rd said earlier, it would be cheap housing - as long as they don't block your efforts to save your money, develop your job-market options & become more independent.  Older parents can be really weird in that aspect, too.  [edit to add] But if you aren't reinstated in one to two years (depending on how long it takes you to effectively build your ""escape route""), then perhaps use it as an ""The elders stumbled me!"" means of showing your parents why you don't want to remain a JW...?"

exjw,3digoa,lescannon,3,Thu Jul 16 22:11:39 2015 UTC,"the elders told them that I should stay in their home   If you stay in their home, keep in mind the elders will continue their attempts to influence you through your parents, just as they're doing right now.  I understand your reluctance to hurt your family, but are you willing to tolerate the JW meddling in your life?    If you are an adult, you don't need a ""good"" excuse to move out.  It's part of being an adult in this culture.  Moving out doesn't mean ending your relationship with your family, but it does mean doing things on your terms instead of the terms being laid out to you by others."
exjw,3digoa,ziddina,3,Thu Jul 16 15:54:38 2015 UTC,I just feel it is time for me to be on my own. It is important to me that I prove to myself that I can run my own household.

exjw,3digoa,ziddina,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:13:53 2015 UTC,"Definitely what lescannon said.  If you're over 18, you need to learn how to fend for yourself instead of becoming one of those 28-year-old JWs still living at home with Mom & Dad.  The Watchtower Society hinted at such emotional infantilization as being a GOOD thing, in their direct-to-video treacly flop ""The Prodigal Son"" - gaaah!  The sight of the younger kid tripping up at every moment without a stich of backup or support, only to go running home to Mommy & Daddy like a good little JW boy - SICKENING!"

exjw,3digoa,Pertinax126,2,Thu Jul 16 18:35:55 2015 UTC,"If your plan is to be reinstated, I don't see any reason not to stay.  Rent is probably cheaper and if you can keep your head down for about a year until you're reinstated, you could have a lot more saved up to make your move.  You'll also put your parents at ease.  Once you're reinstated, move out, change congregations and fade.  Your parents won't be as upset.  If you really just can't stand living at home, can you change jobs or job locations to something that is a good deal farther away?  That would be a good excuse that wouldn't throw up any flags for your parents.  edit: your/you're - I know the difference, but darn fingers type whatever they want :)"

We really want to get this story spread far and wide. Even having a JW see the billboard might raise some questions, especially for parents.

Then if it's not in your hiding spot, go to lost and found, if it's not there, call the police to get it for you where the locator says it is?

It is an Assembly Hall that houses five Kingdom Halls with removable centre walls to open up as an Assembly Hall.  Very well used facility that backs onto the Trans-Canada Highway (16 Ave.)  When the land was bought, there was a pre-existing contract with the company owning billboard rights on the land. At the time, the land was bought with some veto rights as to billboard contents (no porn gambling, etc.). No idea if the veto still exists.  The billboard IS IN THE Kingdom Hall parking lot.  Price is probably north of 2500 (Cdn) per week.  Expensive, but very ironic.  http://imgur.com/gallery/P9CNrHb/new  http://imgur.com/lwbTgtk"

Basically if a member is accused of child abuse, the elders are supposed to organise a meeting between the accused and the accuser. If one/both refuse, then the ""two witness"" rule applies: if there isn't another independent witness of the abuse, then the elders leave it ""in Jehovah's hands"". Abuse isn't reported to authorities or investigated. They're more concerned about protecting the image of the church than protecting the children."

exjw,3dkbhr,logicalone7,2,Thu Jul 16 23:29:07 2015 UTC,I don't think it works like that. I mean you can be at your best moment in your 50s but your body is not going to be as healthy as in your 20s. So you are supposed to be in your most optimal state. I never had trouble assimilating that part.   For example one thing that always disturbed me was what would happen if one of the members of a couple die and the widow marries again. When the dead person is resurrected with whom must live the previous widow? Was the dead person's fault of dying the reason why he lost his right of living with his significant other?
exjw,3dkbhr,PublicTalkGoneBad,3,Thu Jul 16 23:51:24 2015 UTC,Somewhere in the bible Jesus said there will be no marriage after the resurrection. No marriage means no sex meaning no children meaning no new life besides those who died.

exjw,3dkbhr,FadingTruth,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:38:49 2015 UTC,"The WT had Nu-lite™ about that last year:  Watchtower AUGUST 2014 Questions From Readers Jesus told the Sadducees that resurrected ones “neither marry nor are given in marriage.” (Luke 20:34-36) Was he talking about the resurrection on earth?  Read article on JW.org  It's a complete reversal from several previous articles.  Below are just three of them in part:  w61 11/15 p. 703 Questions From Readers Is there no hope at all that one of the “great crowd” who dies now before Armageddon will be reunited with his marriage partner as that one’s mate in the new world and share in the fulfillment of the procreation mandate?  Hope is based upon God’s Word, not on sentimentality. The stark Bible truth remains: Human marriage is dissolved by the death of one of the married partners. (Rom. 7:1-3) For this reason, the Christian dying now has no right to bind his surviving partner to stay single in the hope that in the resurrection they may be reunited.  w87 6/1 p. 31 Questions From Readers Is it wise for a Christian whose mate has died to remain single in the hope of being reunited in the future?  God’s goodness is reflected also in his informing us that the death of a mate concludes the marriage. (Romans 7:2) Thus anyone who has lost a mate can know that he or she is free to remarry now if that seems needed or best. Some have remarried, thereby helping to fill their own present needs and those of their family. (1 Corinthians 7:36-38; Ephesians 6:1-4) Consequently, a Christian whose mate has died should not feel obliged to remain mateless now out of an expectation that former marriage mates will be reunited in the resurrection to life here on earth in the coming system.  w67 10/15 p. 639 Questions From Readers Do Jesus’ words at Luke 20:34-36 apply to the earthly resurrection or to the heavenly resurrection of the 144,000?  So while it is true that the 144,000 raised to heavenly life will not marry, evidently Jesus, in making the comments at Luke 20:34-36, was not speaking about this small fraction of those to be resurrected. But, rather, in accord with the question posed, he was speaking about the earthly resurrection and what will be the situation for the thousands of millions raised from the dead to earthly life."

exjw,3dgjw3,brandon0297,594,Thu Jul 16 02:32:06 2015 UTC,"One year later, Juan is disfellowshipped for asking his elders difficult questions about blood transfusions.   You see, nobody explained the blood ban to Juan, who is an EMT, before he got baptized. As he slowly began to realize the full impact of the policy, he became more and more dismayed. A few years before he became a Witness, Juan's little brother's life was saved by a blood transfusion after he was in a car accident, and Juan can't believe that his new brothers and sisters would really want Juan's brother to die because of being denied medical treatment. Juan's wife is pregnant with twins. He can't imagine ever letting them die for lack of a simple, safe medical intervention, when the blood ban is based on a single scripture written two millennia earlier by people who thought they were just making a dietary suggestion to help the fledgling Christian congregation avoid sectarian arguments.  When Juan lays all of this out for his new friends, he is shocked when they tell him to just wait on Jehovah. He's even more shocked when they start telling him that blood is really dangerous, and that the ban keeps Witnesses safe by protecting them from AIDS, and that blood transfusion is really just a big business and that people make a lot of money from it. Juan knows these things are extremely misleading because of his medical training. But when he tells his brothers and sisters what he KNOWS is the truth, and will not back down from telling them because he is sure they care just as much about the truth as he does (they refer to the religion as ""the truth,"" after all,) he is finally brought up in front of a judicial committee and disfellowshipped.  After he's disfellowshipped, Juan tries to go to a few more meetings, fondly remembering the love that he felt on that first visit, the love that convinced him this was really the truth. He stands forlornly by the information board, alone, just as he did when he first started coming to the meetings. Nobody will even make eye contact with him. Somehow, all of his brothers and sisters were able to turn off their love for him overnight, like a light switch, and all because he loved the truth, and his little brother, and his newborn twins, and for that matter, all of his new brothers and sisters, too much to lie to them."

Members of the congregation called my stepfather and told him to let her die (with two children). He did not, of course, and they were both disfellowshipped. Both my mother and stepfather had a lot of anguish about it; it was the loss of identity and a lot of shame.   The upshot is that I can now end a visit from a JW to my door in about ten seconds with ""Yeah, the thing is, other Witnesses told my stepfather to basically kill my mother, so..."""

There are a couple of official documents, one of which is meant to be carried around in one's wallet and one of which is more comprehensive and detailed and is kept on file by the congregation's body of elders. Both are lawyer-generated, officially-binding advance medical directives that declare the individual's desire to not ever receive blood, and a doctor would get into a lot of trouble for ignoring them (similar to ""no code"" directives.)  Additionally, there are swat teams of elders called ""hospital liaison committees"" organized at the local level who have arrangements with all local emergency facilities to be notified if any Witnesses are admitted. They will invariably show up within a couple of hours of admission, with the patient's previously-prepared paperwork on hand, to prevent any blood transfusions from taking place. They will both act as the patient's ""advocate"" if they are unconscious and will also make sure the patient and their family knows they (the patient) will be disfellowshipped for taking a blood transfusion if they happen to be conscious and appear to be wavering on the issue.

Half of my family is JW, but just about everyone is ok with dying even if it's tomorrow. Reason being is how strongly they believe in the afterlife. For them, dying isn't so bad since after it, paradise will come.   I say just let them be. Also, not every congregation is like that. Funny thing is happy JWs usually don't browse Internet forums because they know better than to pick a fight. Every religion has its ""X is a horrible religion and here is why"" group. And every religion also has its elitist members which give the religion as a whole a bad reputation by trying to force their beliefs on others, which is NOT the JW way of teaching."

exjw,3dgu4c,Xstaticfoo,7,Thu Jul 16 04:04:02 2015 UTC,"I don't believe any of the big 8 in charge has ever attended college. One has some military background back when he wasn't yet a JW. They word it very carefully; they never claim to be prophets. But they say they lead gods ""chosen organization on earth."" Many JWs probably imagine that they have some kind of a connection with the big J. I've heard jokes about a large opening in the ceiling where they meet, but that's not true. One of the top leaders exited the cult in the late 70s/early 80s and wrote a tell-all book, ""Crisis of Conscience,"" wherein he spills the beans on what goes on. Basically, major doctrinal issues are decided upon by a majority vote (after praying for god to guide them first, of course). That book is strictly forbidden for JWs to look at. Apparently, they don't want it known that it's basically just a big ol boys' club at the top."
exjw,3dgu4c,ThatsFrownedUpon,10,Thu Jul 16 04:13:06 2015 UTC,"They word it very carefully   That's the crux of it.  Their manner of communication with Jehovah and charter from him, per their description, is just direct enough to inspire faith in their followers, yet just vague enough to absolve them of responsibility when they utter false prophecies, flipflop on doctrinal issues, or otherwise fuck up."
exjw,3dgu4c,GenericBrandDoom,3,Thu Jul 16 04:51:43 2015 UTC,Well said!
exjw,3dgu4c,ThatsFrownedUpon,3,Thu Jul 16 04:59:22 2015 UTC,"They word it very carefully; they never claim to be prophets.   You're right, they never directly say that they are prophets but it is strongly implied.  ""For an answer, people should listen to the plain preaching by the remnant prefigured by Jeremiah, for these preach to men the present-day fulfillment of Jeremiah's prophecies. Who made them a prophet to speak with the authority that they claim? Well, who made Jeremiah a prophet?"" Watchtower 1959 Jan 15 pp.39-41"
exjw,3dgu4c,takingbackcj,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:01:18 2015 UTC,"You're right, they never directly say that they are prophets but it is strongly implied.   That has been the Watchtower Society's primary method of controlling their followers while lowering their potential-lawsuit profile, ever since Rutherford's idiotic claim that ""Millions Now Living Will Never Die"".  Or perhaps it dates back even further, to Russell's loss of a defamation lawsuit over his involvement with the infamous ""Miracle Wheat"" scam.  At any rate, for a very long time Watchtower has used suggestions rather than outright statements.  To this day, they ""suggest"" that members:  Avoid, eschew higher education, overtime & promotions at work, & even go so far as to demonstrate (but NEVER state outright) that their followers would be better off working part-time jobs, living at poverty level, & spending their entire lives preaching Watchtower dogma (propaganda) door-to-door.  Men & women are ""encouraged"" to apply Iron Age Middle Eastern male Israelite values in their family.  Naturally, this creates a situation that deprives women of their equality, & imo greatly increases the probability that there will be domestic violence, child molestation & physical abuse in the home.  All Jehovah's Witnesses are ""encouraged"" to avoid blood transfusions at ANY cost, even to the point of losing their own lives.  In an ironic & highly dishonest (imo) twist, the Watchtower Society has gradually & in stages quietly allowed various components of blood TO be used during operations - but the average JW usually remains totally clueless about this, as the Watchtower Society has never had a highly public meeting or study publication specifying exactly what they do & do not allow at this time.  (As if religious leaders should have any say in medical treatments...)"
exjw,3dgu4c,ziddina,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:27:03 2015 UTC,"major doctrinal issues are decided upon by a majority vote (after praying for god to guide them first, of course)   I guess this is the way decisions are made on all levels. (from the elders meeting to the branch office to the GB).  Of course you can always make the claim, that the decisions are finally influenced by gods spirit. There is no need for an evidence for the dubs."
exjw,3dgu4c,pinche_pendejo,7,Thu Jul 16 13:26:49 2015 UTC,"The true leadership is extremely secret.  The public leadership is the Governing Body, an unspecified number of men, presently 7 (keep up, fellow posters).  The GB do very little of the actual ""God said this"" work, but, ostensibly, sign off on everything.  They only meet as the GB Wednesday mornings - meetings that can be as short as 10 minutes.  The rank and file is led to believe that God himself speaks to these men, but absolutely no detail as to how, etc. is provided.  Most, if not all, have been Circuit Overseers, who are men that have successfully volunteered as Pioneers (your Missionaries) for a number of years recruiting for the Borg.  (CO's supervise approximately 20 congregations, and have extensive autonomy. CO's are approved directly by the GB.)  New Light from God can come from the Writing Department, but is then vetted by the GB.  Secularly educated? ARE YOU SERIOUS?  Actually, there was one, Lloyd Barry, and during his term, education was actually allowed (see Aug. 22, 1994 Awake).  That was very short-lived, and ToMo has been on the warpath against drones becoming edjumicated."
exjw,3dgu4c,berrygerry,3,Thu Jul 16 06:12:01 2015 UTC,"1) the governing body is in charge, 8 men who vote and require a 2/3 majority rule to make doctrinal changes.  2) they believe god speaks to them by blessing his earthy organization and continuing their prosperity. If he didn't approve they wouldn't be doing so well is their reasoning. (Even though most don't realize their religion is dying). 3) not as far as I know. And most defiantly not as long as they have been one of JW's, which is the majority of their lives."

Did hit a snag while I was on vacation though. Found out my big sister doesn't like the fact that I'm out. She's not a witness nor has ever been but she identifies with the beliefs because our grandmother was devout.

exjw,3dgfdu,brandon0297,4,Thu Jul 16 02:01:58 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Shepherd the Flock of God a.k.a. ks10  Here is the Letter dated 2012-10-01  TO ALL BODIES OF ELDERS Re: Child abuse   English Spanish French Italian Korean   ks10  “Shepherd the Flock of God” —1 Peter 5:2  Chapter 12  pg 131-132   Child Abuse  18. You should immediately call the branch office for direction if you learn of an accusation of child abuse, regardless of the age of the victim now or at the time of the alleged abuse, even if it occurred before the alleged perpetrator’s baptism. The branch office will then give direction based on the circumstances involved in each situation.   Marginal note: See October 1, 2012, letter to all bodies of elders regarding child abuse.   19. Child abuse is a crime. Never suggest to anyone that they should not report an allegation of child abuse to the police or other authorities. If you are asked, make it clear that whether to report the matter to the authorities or not is a personal decision for each individual to make and that there are no congregation sanctions for either decision. Elders will not criticize anyone who reports such an allegation to the authorities. If the victim wishes to make a report, it is his or her absolute right to do so. —Gal. 6:5.  20. When a known child molester moves to another congregation, the Congregation Service Committee should send a letter of introduction with full and complete information about his background and current situation. Any letter from the branch office concerning the child molester should not be photocopied or sent to the new congregation. However, the new congregation should be clearly informed of any restrictions imposed by the branch office. A copy of the letter of introduction should be sent to the branch office.  21. In a case in which a brother denies an allegation of child abuse and he has been accused by only one witness, the following direction is given if he moves to another congregation. The elders should consult the branch office before sending any information regarding the accusation to the elders in the new congregation. It would be helpful if your letter to the branch office provided a detailed summary of the matter and explained the spiritual condition and personal circumstances of the accused and the accuser. With regard to the accused, the following questions should be answered: (1) What is his interaction with children? (2) Does he admit to any activity with the accuser that could have been misinterpreted by the accuser as sexual abuse, or does he claim to have a poor memory of the accusation? (3) What is his response to why the accuser has made the allegation? (4) Has he had to be counseled for any other matters of a sexual nature, such as inappropriate conduct with adult sisters or pornography? (5) What is the level of his spirituality? (6) Do all the elders on the body believe that he can be trusted with children? The following questions should be answered with regard to the accuser: (1) What is the level of maturity of the child or youth? (2) Is he (or she) describing conduct that one his age would not normally know about? (3) Is the child or his parents known to be serious, mature? (4) Is his memory consistent, or is it intermittent, or does it involve repressed memories? (w95 11/1 pp. 25-26) (5) What is the reputation of the parents? (6) Are they spiritually and emotionally mature? After carefully considering the matter, the branch office will then give you direction as to what information about the allegation should be shared, if any, with the elders of the new congregation.   See also:  Shepherd The Flock Of God, p. 38    20 . If the sin occurred before he was appointed as an elder or a ministerial servant, the elders will need to take into consideration the fact that he should have mentioned this possible impediment to his being qualified when elders interviewed him just prior to announcing his appointment. Moreover, the nature of the sin may reflect greatly on his qualifications to serve. For example, the sin may involve past child abuse, and this would likely disqualify him for many years.

I'm not defending the Borg or any other religious institution.  My point is that if you want to criticize an organization for its policies as being wrong, show examples of how its nots typical of other similar institutions.  If you can't, then maybe the problem is not isolated but rather systemic in society as a whole."
exjw,3dgfdu,Quark86d,2,Thu Jul 16 05:26:06 2015 UTC,"It's the authorities job to determine the substantiation, NOT the elders. I've never seen a recommendation to call the police if you suspect a crime but only if you have figured out if there is actually a crime."
exjw,3dgfdu,Truthdoesntchange,0,Thu Jul 16 15:05:24 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that it's the authorities job to investigate these things.  In states that require reporting of allegations, the Borg complies.  In states where there is no requirement, they handle as you describe. JWs are just one small organization.  There are plenty of others (religious and otherwise) that are similarly susceptible to pedophiles.  Until every stated requires mandatory reporting, the problem of unreported allegations will continue in various organizations."
exjw,3dgfdu,FadedGenes,2,Thu Jul 16 17:35:31 2015 UTC,"Even if no other religious organizations had a go-to-the-authorities stance, they still don't get a pass for it. None of them would get a pass for it.  Here's why: Regardless whether they explicitly discourage people from going to the police with a criminal matter, they strongly imply that it should be handled internally, will possible retribution for allegations made without their two-witness level of evidence."
exjw,3dgfdu,Truthdoesntchange,0,Thu Jul 16 15:44:03 2015 UTC,"Where do they strongly imply it should be handled internally?  Show me the evidence, not hearsay.  Also, as I've said, in states where the law requires reporting, the elders are instructed to report.  If all states had these requirements, then all allegations would be reported.    It's fine to criticize the fact that the Borg doesn't have a ""report any and all allegations to the police immediately"" policy.  But the criticism can only go so far when the governments themselves don't require or encourage such reporting.  In fact, I would say the governments should be criticized to a much higher degree."
exjw,3dgfdu,FadedGenes,2,Thu Jul 16 17:31:25 2015 UTC,"Where do they strongly imply it should be handled internally? Show me the evidence, not hearsay.   Do they or do they not have a culture in which JWs are strongly discouraged from taking one another to court?  Do they or do they not have a culture in which people are discouraged from doing anything that would bring ""reproach"" on the organization?  Have the victims not cited these aspects of the culture as disincentives to report the crimes to the authorities themselves?   Also, as I've said, in states where the law requires reporting, the elders are instructed to report. If all states had these requirements, then all allegations would be reported.   Child abuse and molestation are crimes in all states. Are you arguing that the elders should not report crimes against children to the authorities? Are you arguing that they should only report crimes against children if there is a law that specifically requires them to do so? Are you arguing that they should not encourage victims to go to the authorities? Is your argument that they can't be decent human beings unless ordered to do so by secular laws?  It is not at all clear what point you're trying to make. It sounds like you are saying that you're happy with the way they're handling things already and that nothing in the organization needs to change."
exjw,3dgfdu,Truthdoesntchange,-1,Thu Jul 16 17:40:19 2015 UTC,"My point was crystal clear.  They comply with the reporting laws in their states.    If the state doesn't require any allegation of abuse to be reported, then there is plenty of blame to go around - on the Borg, but primarily the state itself.  The Borg isn't the only organization where abuse sometimes happens.  The only way to really combat the problem for the benefit of everyone is for the states to require allegations of abuse be reported.  THAT is the ultimate problem here.    Finally, I asked for you to provide actual evidence that the Borg encourages things to be handled internally.  You did not.  Instead you made generalizations and hearsay that sidestepped the point....you did such a fine job of it, you could probably get a job working for the borgs writing department.    However, I will respond to the two arguments you made to support your false claim that the Borg encourages allegations of child abuse to be swept under the rug.   (Unfortunately I'm on a mobile device that doesn't allow me to quote each point for response)  1) you tried to connect not reporting allegations of abuse to the police with the Borg saying brothers shouldn't take eachother to court.  First, that's not the ""borgs policy"" - that's straight from the bible.  The verse specifically refers to business matters and that's how the Borg has always applied it.  Secondly, that principle doesn't even apply to this situation.  Taking your brother to a judge to settle a business dispute is nothing like reporting abuse to the police to investigate if a criminal act occurred.  Finally, the Borg has even put stuff in print saying there are times when one has to take a matter to court and provided examples.  2) you also tried to say the Borg discourages reporting allegations of abuse by saying its members shouldn't do anything to bring reproach on Jehovah's name.  First, it IS in print that Victims should NEVER be discouraged from going to the police.  There are no Borg sanctioned congregational penalties for doing so.  Second, who is the one bringing reproach on Jehovah's name - the innocent victim or the abuser?  Third, if the Borg did have a policy of trying to cover things up, and of discouraging victims from going to the police, THAT would actually be something that would bring reproach on Jehovah's name.    As far as this matter goes, your opinions simply do not reflect reality of the situation.  Believe what you want, but I'd encourage you not to express these untruths to other JWs..... They will rightly view it as ""apostate lies"" And it will turn them of from potentially learning TTATT.  I've said it before and I'll say it again.  The orgs ACTUAL beliefs and practices are enough that it will ""hang itself.""  There is nothing to gain by exaggerating it's evils beyond what they really are."
exjw,3dgfdu,tazemanian-devil,2,Thu Jul 16 19:15:43 2015 UTC,"Victims are strongly discouraged from reporting anything to the authorities, or for that matter even talking about the situation to anyone in the congregation on the grounds of slander.  When the elders meet with the alleged victim and alleged abuser, they tell the victim to make the accusation directly in the presence of the elders and the alleged abuser. But first, they read scriptures about how Jehovah hates lies, and counsel the alleged victim about how serious a matter slander is.  If there are no witnesses to the alleged crime, they are told to leave the matter in Jehovah's hands and are AGAIN counseled against slandering their brother.  Yes, they are free to report the matter to the police, but a completely separate investigation into whether or not the victim is slandering their brother may be started, and the victim and their parents are warned of this.  This is how they are coerced into not pursuing the matter."
exjw,3dgfdu,tinypurplepotato,3,Thu Jul 16 20:00:39 2015 UTC,"A problem that contributes to any format of sexually abuse is the imbalance of power and most religions have this as an innate part of their structure. There is a class of people that are more trusted and more powerful than the rest and if someone is looking to abuse this they just have to position themselves properly.  Abuse of power happens in nearly every organization, the problem with religion is that, unlike in other organizations, children are also subject to the whims of those in power.   The real problem with jws is that they believe that their organization is different and better than others (and perfect), which means it's beyond reproach and so nothing like this could possibly happen and that really complicates handling things because these people clearly do not believe this sort of problem is possible."
exjw,3dgfdu,formerbutnotbitter,-1,Thu Jul 16 05:35:55 2015 UTC,"I am not blind, but I'm pretty sure it said in BOLD, it is perfectly acceptable to call the authorities. There is no coverup here.

The other elders testified against her in court and claimed that she and her children were liars and claimed they'd never tried to talk her out of going to the authorities, which they had. They went to several of my family members and warned us to keep our mouths shut. The elder husband is still an elder  Edit: this happened in the 80's and 90's and I wish my family wasn't an example of this"
exjw,3dgfdu,opinionmill,5,Thu Jul 16 05:21:35 2015 UTC,"I feel the present situation is somewhat exaggerated, partly because the policies have been improved over the years, but people here were harmed by the previous policies. Having said that, when an authority figure is told of a case of child sexual abuse, it's not enough to allow calling the police, calling the police should be the policy. Cooperating with the police should be the policy. Checking back with the legal department to ask for permission to cooperate at every turn allows them plausible deniability if they think they can get away with a coverup, because they have shown repeatedly that saving face is more important to them than their members' safety.  Edit: just wanted to add that it's great that you found a way to be smug about having suffered less than others. I'm super happy for you."

I'm sure there are cases where Borg procedures are not followed, but the idea that there is some grand systemic institution designed to protect molesters at all costs is delusional and only believed by idiots who hate the org because of some personal experience and are grasping at straws.  The Borg has publicly condemned pedophilia and established procedures that comply with the laws of the states they operate in.

Don't fully trust anyone you're dating until you really, really know them.  Like, for years.  It doesn't matter if they're a Witness or worldly--you shouldn't fully let your guard down until you know they're safe people.  That doesn't mean a rapist with rohypnol is hiding on top of every bar stool.  It just means use good common sense. In terms of intimacy, be clear about your boundaries.  You don't have to tell a guy on a first date, ""I'm a virgin so I'm not planning on sleeping with you tonight,"" (hopefully, see Point #1).  But don't feel like you have to kiss him goodnight if you don't want to.  Smile and say, ""I don't kiss on the first date,"" wink, and ask him to call you as you're about to walk back inside your door.  If things are heating up a little more, stop, look him in the eye and say, ""I'm really enjoying this, but you should know I don't plan on sleeping with you right now.""  It's better to err on the side of saying too much, rather than not enough.  Clear communication is a good thing for everyone involved. Don't date in your hometown/neighborhood if you're afraid of getting busted by a JW.  You won't have any fun because you'll always be looking over your shoulder, and he'll start to think you're a big weirdo.   When you're ready, use condoms.  You should probably buy some to make sure you don't get the, ""I don't have one, baby.  You're not going to make me go to the drugstore now, are you?"" line.  Get lubricated ones.  Oh, and no one is ""too big"" for a condom.  No one.  Sex without condoms is more fun.  Use them anyway.  I mean it. Don't delay sex because you've got JW hang-ups.  It's super fun.

The difference with worldly guys is that 1) they'll expect ""benefits"" within a few weeks at most and 2) they won't expect you to be ""committed"" to them any time soon.   Witness guys are the opposite.  They'll expect commitment immediately and no benefits until marriage.  Everything I've said is generic and stereotypical.  It reflects 95 percent of what you'll find.

If he doesn't respect them, then bye!    Being a JW can affect people and how they view sex because they view wanting sex as a bad thing or something damaging to your being. You can still want to have sex with someone and have a fulfilling, long term relationship. Some guys that aren't raised as witnesses will view relationships like that. Some will just want to hook up.   If you're distrustful of guys who aren't witnesses , I wouldn't jump into dating because your trust issues could lead to a lot of stress in the relationship to be honest.

I don't feel any differently about Christmas than I do about Ramadan or Passover. They are all equally foreign to me, and I don't feel slighted by not participating in them.  Ultimately, you get to decide what level or style of involvement is right for you. You might grow into it after a while; you might not. Anything you choose is fine."

But my husband was never a JW, and our 9 year old gets to celebrate pretty much whatever.  It's a situation where I just acquiesce to culture, really.  Holidays don't offend me, so I just roll with it.   If it were me in your situation, I'd let the kids guide the direction based on their own desires.  If they ask for a birthday party, go for it.  If they ask you why they don't celebrate Christmas or go see the Easter Bunny, tell them that you and daddy were raised by people who didn't believe in the holidays and now it's kind of hard for you to get very interested in them.  Then tell them that you're willing to help them decide what they want to do and what (if anything) they want to celebrate.  You could teach them about multicultural holidays, try celebrating one the way the pagans would have, whatever.  It'll teach them to be more critical thinkers and maybe you'll develop some fun traditions unique to your own family."

Presents are for the kids, I usually just get a token gift for me and him. Birthdays are about doing whatever that person wants to do for the day. Their favourite meal, cake, and a gift.

Otherwise things like Christmas and the like I don't do much for. I'll buy gifts for the kids and my wife, but no decorations or anything like that.   I tend to see holidays as stressful times of year for everyone else. Pressure to buy gifts because someone got you one last year. By keeping things small and personal it feels nicer to me.

It wasn't super extravagant, we made some stuff ourselves; but it was fun. We make it her best day ever because she is that special to us. We love that she's a part of our lives and we're going to celebrate the day she came into ours. Not every day is like that, and she doesn't get the message that she's the only important thing in our lives, just that we're so glad to have her we put a bunch of effort into this one really special day for her.  Christmas is for rewarding good behavior and showing family we love them and giving to others- food, time, money, energy.   But I just plain love stuff like this.

exjw,3dffdc,Quark86d,3,Thu Jul 16 06:51:43 2015 UTC,"The big deal is that your child is alive another year. We can take that kind of for granted, but in the old days, it was quite common for every family to have children die before they got to the challenging tween years, often before they got to the challenging toddler years. Teach them hospitality when they are hosting their own party - they have to greet each guest when the guest comes in, and they have to escort each guest to the door when the guest leaves.   The dubs distort the history of birthdays completely; since there is no explanation about birthday celebrations, that is a good indicator, everybody had them. At Herod's party, which he threw to celebrate being still alive, he got caught in having to honor his word and hospitality; Pharaoh also released at least one prisoner - likely more.  Your children are young enough that they are neutral, but they will learn about these things. You can let them go to birthday parties and help them host their own, but still put some limits on it. Young children's parties should have no more (children) guests than the child's age. Making up gift bags for the guests helps remind all that their is joy in making others happy. Establishing a budget for how much a gift is for other people, and how much is for the gift bags helps them learn that money is not unlimited.   Having birthdays for yourselves will help them learn to think about the other person would actually like. The other parent can try to coach them and give them hints.  You are right that there is a lot of birthday excess, but if we refuse to do anything that others overdo, we would be unable to do anything. You are better off teaching them to be somewhat reasonable, so they don't feel as much need to go wild."
exjw,3dffdc,Syrinx221,2,Thu Jul 16 16:34:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think birthdays are any more narcissistic than weddings / wedding anniversaries are (and honestly, I felt my JW family member was far MORE narcissistic about her wedding than most people are about their birthday, since she went a bit bridezilla).   What is it that you picture being a typical worldly birthday celebration? It kind of sounds to me like you are picturing worldly birthdays as being more lavish than (in my experience at least) they usually are.  Your idea of going out on a special outing with some friends actually sounds like a pretty normal way for worldly people to celebrate birthdays, actually.  My own preferred way to celebrate is to do something fun like go to a movie, eat at a nice restaurant, and then have some cake and a few modest gifts. For small children, I would just give them a cupcake with a candle on it and consider that plenty. :) When I was a kid, my parents did once set up a party at a Chuck E Cheese like place for me but most of the time we just had a small celebration at home. Some of my friends with kids do things like rent a bounce house for the back yard for their kids, but I don't think most kids would feel deprived if they didn't get that.   The only time when I would expect most people to make a big fuss about a birthday would be for special milestones like 18, 21, 30, etc.   A birthday, to me, is about the people who love the birthday boy/girl doing something nice to show that they appreciate that this person was born and lives another year. In other words, it shouldn't be about the birthday person being self-absorbed, but an opportunity for the rest of us show we care. I suspect you might enjoy birthdays more as time goes on and you start to develop fond memories of special times spent on birthdays with your kiddos."

Especially if they could find those one or two posts where my wife and I posted our pics.  So what? I don't care too much. The chances of it happening are pretty slim. Like, almost infinitesimally slim. You are probably in a similar situation: unless that person is intimately familiar with you, chances are you could be one of thousands of people who had similar occurrences. Your experiences, your history, and your information would have to be amazingly detailed for most people to put together who you were... you'd essentially have to publish your actual name and address for you to be found out.  Those who have been discovered have had it happen by their own mistakes: logging into Reddit from a family computer and not logging out, for example. Giving their username to someone they trusted but shouldn't have. Things like that.  Most elders wouldn't be able to handle seeing this subreddit day after day; it would send them reeling. Those who did stick it out would likely find their nice little spiritual world become rather shaky; I imagine they'd end up as members here and exJW's themselves.

We lie to avoid hurting others, we lie to get out of trouble and we lie because sometimes it is easier to lie than to tell the truth.  You are better off teaching then that there is no need to lie to you. Most often people lie because they do not want to disappoint someone they love, show them that while you may be disappointed in something they do,  but that lying will not change the situation. I tell my kids do NOT lie to me when I ask them something if they do I will double the involved punishment (if a punishment is necessary). I will catch them and I have yet not to. This is because being raised a witness it was almost ALWAYS better to lie than to admit the truth when you did something wrong. I couldn't trust my parents with the truth, so I became a very very good liar.  Build the the trust and relationship you want with your kids. Be open and honest with them and they will feel comfortable doing the same with you. You don't need a book to teach you how to be a good parent and you don't need a book to teach your kids morals."

I was recently having this very conversation with someone without children that is dead set on the fact that it's the lack of belief in God that is the downfall of today's  society. I argued the fact that believing in God does not a good child make, or adult for that matter. I just have such a hard time grasping the idea that some people have that morality can only come from belief in a higher power/religion. I am raising my children in a more secular environment and I have awesome kids who not only show empathy, but definitely know right from wrong.   Now my only question, and maybe some of you can help me with this, this person said, well that's how you were raised to believe in God and so you have that foundation to teach your children. I'm usually great with rebuttals, but does our Christian upbringing have anything to do with how we raise our kids? Those ways were already a way of life for us, so if we didn't have that knowledge? This person adamantly believes that without God people can't decipher right from wrong. I adamantly disagree, but this whole topic is really a hot button topic for me, as I absolutely don't think I'm doing my children a disservice by not raising them with religion or belief in a higher power. After coming out of the JW religion I'm still not completely sure what I myself believe."

That would mean that everyone raised in god-fearing homes turned out good, and those raised in secular home were bad.  Obviously, that's not the case.  And does that mean all the Buddhists in the world have contributed to the downfall of society? Buddhism does not profess a belief in a god or gods.    I raised two boys in a free-thinking household. My wife Catholic, and I am a secular Buddhist (atheist/agnostic).  Both boys are hard-working. Neither of them touches drugs or alcohol.  And they already have no use for religion, and profess to be atheist/agnostic."

I actually used the same thoughts you expressed. Sometimes I think people have their heads so far in the sand they couldn't explain their way out of anything. I truly appreciate your comment and experiences, it's horrifying to me how narrow minded people can be. The funny thing is this person who believes in God has zero empathy for others thinks that following the bible means reading between the lines and coming up with a version that fits their life, even if that means directly defying a command from his God. I just smh and have to change the conversation, because with those kinds of people nothing you say will make them see anything different than they blindly believe."
exjw,3dfqwt,MsAmazeballs,3,Fri Jul 17 17:05:30 2015 UTC,My nephew is being taught not to lie without any reference to the bible. Lying is a tool that is often used to trick or swindle others and so it's easy to tell a three year old that saying things that are untrue isn't kind or respectful of others. And if your goal is to raise a kind and respectful child then that's all there reasoning you need
exjw,3dfqwt,tinypurplepotato,2,Thu Jul 16 08:22:29 2015 UTC,Religion is not the basis of morality.  Teach them that lying hurts people and hurting people is wrong. Have them think about how they would feel if they were lied to. Give them specific examples of scenarios in which being lied to would really impact them.
exjw,3dfqwt,FadedGenes,2,Wed Jul 15 23:46:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, teaching your children empathy and how their behaviour affects others is key.

exjw,3dfqwt,FLSun,2,Thu Jul 16 03:41:21 2015 UTC,"I get where you're coming from. I left the religion when my oldest was 2 years old. I wondered how I was going to raise children with morals without religion.  However, I realized you don't need religion to have great kids. Just explain to them why you preferred they don't lie: because it's usually better to tell the truth. My kids are young, so I read them a book called ""Franklin Fibs"" which illustrates how it's difficult to back up a lie when you can't do what you said you could.  Don't worry! You can still raise great children without religion. It's far better children learn a logical reason for not doing something rather than fearing they are ""disobeying god"" or are ""a liar like satan."" Kids taught to obey out of fear are learning not to get caught...which is true for most of the witness kids I grew up with."

Me: ""Do you think the news is an accurate measurement of whether things are getting better or worse? Is it a balanced sample of all human activity?""  [They've tried this before and they see that I'm laying a logic trap. They hesitate, so I continue.]  Me: ""I mean, if you actually measured things like health, life expectancy, crime, infant mortality, war and poverty, and the data showed those things to be getting better, and not worse, what would you think?""  Them: ""But they're not getting better. They're getting worse.""  Me: ""What do you base that on? How do you know?""  Them: ""I just believe that they're getting worse.""  Me: ""I understand that you believe that. But what is that belief based on? What would you do if there were reliable information out there that indicated that the reality is different from what you believe?""  Them: ""Well what do you believe?""  Me: ""I believe that the things you claimed are getting worse can be measured, and that it's possible to determine objectively whether they are really getting better or worse.""  Them: ""No, I mean, what do you believe about where we are in the end of this system?""  Me: ""You know that I won't talk about my beliefs with you, because your beliefs make talking about my beliefs impossible.""  Frustration is clearly evident at this point. I continue.  Me: ""My point is this: If you believed something that was not true, would you even want to know?""  Hesitates again.  Them: ""Well, sure, but...""  Me: ""But how would you ever know? You get all of your information from one source. If that source was wrong, how would you ever know?""  Them: ""Our understanding of things gets clearer as time goes on.""  Me: ""How do you know that it gets clearer? How could you verify that?""  They're getting really wound up and exasperated by this point.  Them: ""They tell us!""  Me: ""Wait, what? They'd tell you if they were wrong? Do you even hear yourself? So, when they ""correct"" a teaching that was previously incorrect, how could you ever verify that the new teaching is really correct?""  Them: <wheels turning, no response>  Me: ""Thinking about it another way, if there were information that could either confirm or disprove something you believe, would you try to learn more about it or would you ignore it?""  Them: ""I hate when you do this to me.""  [Aww, I'm feeling persecuted!]  Me: ""Do what?""  Them: ""You try to trip me up. You try to confuse me.""  Me: ""Are you confused?""

exjw,3df3s7,ziddina,4,Wed Jul 15 21:22:11 2015 UTC,"I deliberately did not give them the data, because I wanted to keep the focus on their thought process and the fact that it is not concerned with evidence.  Also, in maybe half of the conversations like this, my not pushing the data on them causes them to ask for the data, in which case I oblige.

Last night it went like this:   me: Do you believe Jehovah's Holy Spirit directs the governing body in decisions on doctrine?   Her: yes of course.  Me: what evidence is there that that is the case?  Her: you just have to believe and have a personal relationship with jehovah, he answers my prayers all the time.  Me: but that's something personal to you, that's not hard evidence. Can you explain to me about when teachings have flip-flopped and regressed back to what they were? Which teaching was jehovah behind?   Her: the teaching we have currently.  Me: so there is no chance that that teaching could change just like in the past? Read her this experience Me: these changed teachings affect people's lives and can mean the difference between life and death. Read her Malachi 3:6, James 1:17. Did jehovah change his mind?  Her:no  Me: so isn't it clear that if jehovah didn't change his mind, that we are just following the teachings of men?  Her: no, you wouldn't understand you don't have a relationship with Jehovah, he's shown me that this is his one true organisation."

But you said you believe it, so I'm interested in what that belief is based on.""  Her: ""It just is, obviously.""  Me: ""What would be the evidence of an organization being guided by god?""  Her: ""Unity. We all believe the same thing. It's a worldwide brotherhood of all countries and languages.""  Me: ""Can't Mormons claim the same thing? Or Scientologists for that matter?""  Her: ""I... I don't know anything about them.""  Me: ""Wouldn't any organization who expels people who don't accept their teachings have similar unity? I mean, the only people left are people who agree, so it's no miracle that there's unity if everyone who thinks differently is kicked out. What about men being appointed to be elders and servants — does god guide that?""  Her: ""Of course, obviously.""  Me: ""Wouldn't guidance by god prevent men from being appointed if they were actively involved in things that are considered immoral?""  Her: ""But that doesn't happen!""  Me: ""What are you talking about? We know TWO cases of that. _____ was having an affair and _____ had at least two cases of child abuse against him.""  Her: ""But that's... There are imperfect people, sure...""  Me: ""So people being appointed as elders are guided by imperfect people, or by god?""  Her: ""Not everybody is perfect.""  Me: ""Of course not. But isn't that what being guided by god would solve?""  Her: ""Not always. Not necessarily. People are still imperfect. People make mistakes.""  Me: ""So, my question was, wouldn't guidance by god prevent men from being appointed if they were actively involved in things that are considered immoral?""  Her: ""Not in every individual case, I guess.""  Me: ""So, guidance by god just means getting it right a little more often than an organization without god's guidance?""  Her: ""That's just stupid. That's not how it works. It's just, like, their decisions are guided. They pray about it.""  Me: ""But my question is still, what is the effect of that guidance?""  Her: ""They just choose the best brothers for those positions.""  Me: ""Is that what you've seen in our hall?"" (Back story: Our cong blew the fuck up with scandals in the 90's.)  Her: ""That was different. It's not like that happens all the time in all congregations.""  Me: ""How often does it happen?""  Her: ""How would I know? It's not like they announce everything everybody does. People are imperfect. People make mistakes, even elders. I don't like the tone of this conversation.""  Me: ""Sorry, you asked me whether I still thought that it's the truth. I was just trying to understand your thinking.""  Her: ""So do you think it is.""

You totally can.""  Me: ""No, I can't. Sorry.""  Her: ""Fine. But it is the truth. It has to be. I hope you still know that.""  Me: ""My beliefs didn't change just because I became inactive."" (Technically true, but a total brainfuck to her.)  Her: ""Then why don't you come back? Just come back. People miss you.""  Me: ""Sorry, can't talk about it.""  Her: ""Whatever. It's your life.

The same question can be asked many times in many different wordings and from many different angles so that the dub will really start thinking about it without even realizing that he is being asked the same thing over and over again.   ""If it was wrong, would you want to know?"" ""If all religions are wrong, including Jehovah's Witnesses, would it matter or would you stay with the witnesses nevertheless?"" ""If the Watchtower was not God's organization on Earth, would you want to know it or would you follow the Watchtower's teachings regardless?""   And so on.

I find getting outside and a litle walk helps me feel a little better - not that this is a substitute for more help, but maybe a little thing that helps you get through - and you could use all of those, that are not destructive, that you can get until you can get better/professional help.  The point is that life is worth living, even when it is hard. Doing (little) things that make life better for those around one and having some enjoyment of food, art, media, etc.  I suggest avoiding downers, especially alcohol, and sad things like the news. Best wishes"

By ""not destructive"", I meant not relying on bad habits, like over-eating, or (excessive) drug use.  I am sure there is a group of things you are anxious about. Is there anyone that you might talk to that would help reduce (instead of increase) that anxiety?  ""Having faith that things will work out"" may help a depressed person ""pull herself up by her bootstraps"", but it is trusting, not entirely rational. It is similar to trusting that the reality we perceive is the reality in which we exist. A philosopher (DesCartes) raised the point that we can't really know this, so we have to assume it is so. If you assume that you will get sufficient help, you are unlikely to hurt yourself. If you assume that you will be able to persevere through the ups, downs and unknowns of life, you may be able to feel less paralyzed by your anxiety."

It's money,  it's school,  is time with our daughter.  Most of it is a hole I've dug myself into.   Buy I do feel better.  He understands.   He's been there.   And he does want to help.

This is one of the best descriptions of depression (at least how it manifests for many) that I've ever seen.  The Bloggess writes very accessibly about depression and about how to recognize that it really does come and go, and doesn't last forever.  OP, in the meantime, spend time outside, exercise, do some gardening.  Do whatever you can to get the natural endorphins going to help balance the chemicals in your brain until you can get to the doctor and get something to help you knock this out.  You sometimes have to force yourself to do it--the motivation isn't there, but after a couple of times of getting a little natural buzz, you'll start to remember what better feels like.  You'll be okay--I promise."

exjw,3ddegq,nycxyz,3,Thu Jul 16 02:43:36 2015 UTC,"Yes that is depression.  But I don't see anything wrong with staying in bed for a while.  I had a low level depression for years both in and out of the JWs. I tried medication and for the most part it made me feel worse. I was slightly less depressed but 100 times more anxious.   Here are some things that did help me:  Avoiding negative thinking like the plague. It was a lot more prevalent than I realized until I started watching out for it.  Being very careful about watching sad\depressing stuff. This includes the news, movies, tv shows. Even some TV shows that you might never think of as being sad would set me off. For example I found ""That 70s Show"" to be very depressing. You might even take some time off of perusing ex-jw sites. You need to weigh the benefits of coming here with the emotions it may bring up.   Reading and listening to stuff that gives you hope or ideas. There are plenty of podcasts, youtube videos etc. You can download almost any book these days from youtube. Or go to the library. Most libraries have online resources as well.    I stopped listening to the radio on the way to work and listen to books on my ipod exclusively.  A few books i found helpful:   Awaken the Giant Within. Tony talks a lot about how to stop thinking negatively.  One odd one was ""your wish is your command"". It is a bit of a sales pitch and a lot of ""woowoo"". But there is a lot of stuff in there on how to change your mood that I find helpful. He says you may need to listen to it more than once, which was the case with me. The first time through was slow and almost painful, the second and third time I listened to it I got a lot more out of it.   One thing about recored books is, that when I listened to them, I often found the reader to be annoying until I got used to them.   Meditation and Hypnosis, mostly through videos on youtube. Again it took some time to find stuff that worked for me but as I progressed I found that some of the ones didn't work  previously were more palatable."
exjw,3ddegq,F7oraColossus,3,Wed Jul 15 14:07:55 2015 UTC,I have dealt with depression off and on sence returning from Iraq. Go see your doctor. There are medications out there that can reset your brain chemistry. Right now you left of center getting your brain chemistry back where it should be along with some counseling to help you better cope will bring you back to center. Medications don't have to be long term. It may take trying a few different kinds before you and your Dr. Find one that works for you. Everyone is different. Hang in there in the mean time. Things will get better you just have to address the causes.

They may never consider that there needs not to be any religion that is right or better to any degree compared to anything.  That option aside, he may just have gone back for nostalgic reasons. If he found no happiness after leaving the WT (which may happen, because WT fucks up lives and personalities pretty well), he might have just come to a conclusion that for him it's better to live a fake life with fake friends till death than to live a real life with no friends for the same time period."

exjw,3dcssz,NahWey,3,Wed Jul 15 09:15:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, I used the wording from the book title, but that coincides with how I would want to call it myself too."

exjw,3dcssz,Throwaway_Apostate,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:28:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, even if an ex-JW claims to be returning for other reasons, if they've still got family in the sect, they're probably returning so they can be part of the family again."
exjw,3dcssz,ziddina,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:26:13 2015 UTC,I have a friend I talk to online that knows it's all BS and is now going back to meetings because she never stopped believing 😷.
exjw,3dcssz,Pitbulllover89,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:42:44 2015 UTC,... How can she both know it's all bs and yet still believe?
exjw,3dcssz,Syrinx221,2,Wed Jul 15 17:45:27 2015 UTC,She was probably just lying to herself and then the guilt got to her to come back. She says she still wants to celebrate birthdays and holidays and that she's not gonna really follow along to everything. I don't think that's possible.
exjw,3dcssz,Pitbulllover89,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:00:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, a gentleman that I met around the time I was waking up helped me further my education by directing me to various sights -- went back.  ""If there is 1% chance it is right I do not want to be wrong.""  was his reasoning.  So I stated to him,  ""So then, you would drink a beer with a drop of poison in it, just incase you can get a buzz, huh?""  We stopped talking for about a year because I could not stomach what he wanted to talk about.  (we have since visited again and altho he does not agree with the GB he still is an avid worshipper of Jehovah and feels that he (Jah) will bring to ruin the organization and establish his rule on earth.)  But the WORST part is his bullshit statement at the end of a conversation....""Jehovah be with you!"".  I used to slam him on it, but decided to just let him have his piece if it makes him feel good. (cuz I'm giggling any way)  But, I have no respect for him any longer.   He is a coward and pussy in my book.  However, we work real well together and collaborate on things and outside of the dub part he is really cool, so I continue to work with him and be friends.    But how disappointing that the indoctrination stuck.  He could really be a force in the ex world!"
exjw,3dcssz,Pookigirle,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:14:39 2015 UTC,Had a friend who was the same away. Actually walked away before getting baptized. Came back as an adult and the last time I talked to her it just made me sad. She was like a programmed robot. You could just kind of see the crazy in her eyes and I think that's what drew her back.
exjw,3dcssz,deadflow3r,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:44:18 2015 UTC,Family ties are used to keep people in the religion.  It is disgusting.  Your family either wants to know YOU or doesn't.  Give up if you have to.  It ain't worth it.
exjw,3dcio6,ApostateRedditor,7,Wed Jul 15 05:01:36 2015 UTC,You left out the most important tool that JWs will have to help them... GodMagic!!!
exjw,3dcio6,AllHailTightPants,2,Wed Jul 15 07:05:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, concerning the food issue, I was told long ago that since Jehovah provided manna for the Israelites to survive, he would likely provide something similar for the Armageddon survivors.  Might need salt though..."
exjw,3dcio6,JohnRJay,4,Wed Jul 15 15:20:27 2015 UTC,Not a single Witness thinks about this stuff. Their brains only process the good fantasy aspects of Paradise.
exjw,3dcio6,DamagedCalm89,2,Wed Jul 15 12:21:07 2015 UTC,Agreed. They have no problem imagining that everything will be easy - everything they want handed to them. (But put down sharing fairy tales.)
exjw,3dcio6,lescannon,2,Wed Jul 15 14:44:37 2015 UTC,What about Caleb and Sophia?
exjw,3dcio6,Truthdoesntchange,4,Wed Jul 15 13:26:37 2015 UTC,"Let's face it, those kids are going to bail when they are 18.  They'll be rotting along with the rest of us.  The JW survivors will recognize Caleb by the Sparlock tattoo on his chest, not because of his face because the buzzards will have already eaten that."
exjw,3dcio6,caseyoc,3,Wed Jul 15 14:08:56 2015 UTC,Maybe celebs dad will die at the big A and God will turn Calebs mom into a real woman.  Calebs mom has got it going on.
exjw,3dcio6,Truthdoesntchange,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:55:45 2015 UTC,Who are they?
exjw,3dcio6,Optimisticynic,2,Wed Jul 15 16:22:26 2015 UTC,"You should check out the book Paradise Earth. It's about a group of JW's that get stuck inside a Kingdom Hall at Armageddon, and their subsequent escape. The claustrophobia and paranoia inside the KH are palpable. The story of a man with doubts is so relatable, and the descriptions of what the earth is like afterwards are at times stomach-turning. Really fantastic novel for any ex-JW, and I hear it is the first in what will be a series."
exjw,3dcio6,enlilsumerian,2,Wed Jul 15 14:13:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I love books like that. The Survivalist Series and the Going Home series are great, I hope Paradise Earth becomes a series too."
exjw,3dcio6,lufecaep,2,Wed Jul 15 16:21:46 2015 UTC,"Stop with your logic and thinking abilities, you know that thinking on your own displeases Jehover.

exjw,3dcio6,lufecaep,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:01:28 2015 UTC,"To be fair, as long as they were the only ones that survived, the JWs would have a decent chance of surviving."
exjw,3dcio6,CelestelRain,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:25:58 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I'm not saying they wouldn't survive. Just that I don't think any JW has taken the time to truly think about what life will be like once all of the people that operate and maintain all of the worlds vital infrastructure are gone. They're in for years and years and years of hardship far beyond what they've imagined."
exjw,3dcio6,givesBJs2apostates,2,Wed Jul 15 16:20:54 2015 UTC,"You wold think shows like the walking dead would at least make them think.  I never thought about it in gruesome detail but I never expected we would be sitting around all day singing Kumbaya. For me that first 1000 years would be the most interesting part. After that the perpetual picnics, even with panda bears, would get boring pretty quickly.  I think the JWs probably have never considered what forever means either.  I can't imagine having to live forever as a human being, no matter how far into the universe I got to travel. I might change my tune if there was going to be some sort of evolution to my physical\spiritual being."

exjw,3dbzo7,wifibandit,7,Wed Jul 15 02:41:27 2015 UTC,It really is. One of the most stressful situations I've ever been in.
exjw,3dbzo7,unsurejw,4,Wed Jul 15 02:50:30 2015 UTC,As a young elder you just go along with what they older elders say because you figure they know what's best.
exjw,3dbzo7,tazemanian-devil,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:59:36 2015 UTC,"Yup. That's how it was for me. Not knowing how these things usually go, I just went with what everyone else said for the most part."
exjw,3dbzo7,timdrake1914,4,Wed Jul 15 17:30:14 2015 UTC,"It should be possible for bodies of elders to be unanimous in most of their decisions. (Acts 15:25) The body of elders should always base their decisions on Bible principles and written direction from “the faithful and discreet slave.” (Matt. 24:45) In cases that do not involve specific Bible laws or where there is no direction from the faithful slave, the body of elders must exercise their collective judgment and conscience. First, have the best interests of the entire congregation in mind, and second, consider what may spiritually assist any individual involved. During the discussion, no one should insist on his personal viewpoint. If a decision is not unanimous, the minority should give willing support to the final decision. If in the opinion of the minority a Bible-based decision still has not been reached, the minority should continue to cooperate with the rest of the body and bring the matter to the attention of the circuit overseer during his regular visit. If the matter is urgent, write to the branch office.    If you disagree, tell the CO at the next visit.  Oh, BTW, you were DF'd anyways.  Holy Spirit at work."
exjw,3dbzo7,berrygerry,2,Wed Jul 15 04:16:00 2015 UTC,"My dad was the minority elder in number 2, but he's a dick and was arguing for df'ing. He was eventually removed by the CO for causing problems, and then when we got a new CO he had a different view and my dad was reappointed."
exjw,3dbzo7,Pedrovladmir,2,Wed Jul 15 05:16:10 2015 UTC,So the good of the group runs roughshod over the needs of the individual? That doesn't sound like the Jesus story of leaving the flock unattended to rescue 1 sheep.
exjw,3dbzo7,lescannon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:04:31 2015 UTC,I thought that it had to be unanimous. But I've never been an elder.
exjw,3dbzo7,rdudejr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:43:18 2015 UTC,"It's ""unanimous"". As in, majority rules and the dissenters don't get to voice their opinion."

exjw,3dbzo7,watchtouter,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:50:46 2015 UTC,"There are constant reminders in Watchtowers, Kingdom Ministry and local needs talks that ""elders need to have oneness"" (sorry I don't know the better English word, but you'll know). In cult mind control, it's much easier to pressure voters into voting unanimously than explain away why non-unanimously voted decisions are still good. So formally, majority counts, but IRL the vote is unanimous most of the time."
exjw,3dbzo7,canyoufixmyspacebar,2,Wed Jul 15 08:08:56 2015 UTC,Oneness sounds very culty... so I wouldn't be surprised if English publications actually used that word =D you probably mean unity though.
