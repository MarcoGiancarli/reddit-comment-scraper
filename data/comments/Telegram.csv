Telegram,3e4pe1,shafnitz,3,Tue Jul 21 22:57:26 2015 UTC,"im on of the CIS Admins. Group titles are totally needed.  We have groups under liberbot administration with specific topics (reddit/general, music, bot development, anime, shit like that) and another bot to complement liberbot functions, as in mods for each channel.  We rely on titles for people to register where the  fuck they're speaken to from, hah.  I'd suggest you see telegram as an IM protocol with chat integration from here on.  Oh.. And you're looking for the broadcast function for messaging multiple people at once without groups.. Although most of the time groups would be much better.. A letter of absence would be the perfect case for broadcasting instead."

Telegram,3d2m55,bb010g,3,Mon Jul 13 06:53:02 2015 UTC,"For those who are unable to view the link (copy from Google Cache):   A DDoS in Asia Pacific  Just in case you're not following us on Twitter, Telegram's Asia Pacific server cluster has been under a DDoS attack since Friday morning.  This means that if you live in South East Asia, Oceania, Australia or certain parts of India, you may have been experiencing slower connection speeds or no connection at all for several hours this past weekend.  What is this DDasdf thing?  DDoS stands for Distributed Denial of Service and means that a lot of computers start making requests to a server, so that the server is slowed down or stops responding. To put this into familiar terms, imagine a thousand people jamming themselves into a bus at 6 PM on a weekday. They get in, you don‘t and that’s all a DDoS attack is.  Unlike on the bus though, the people who are getting in your way don‘t even know they’re doing this. DDoS attacks are carried out by botnets — thousands of computers and servers that were turned into remotely controlled zombies by malware and viruses.  What exactly hit Telegram?  We've been hit with 200 Gbps of junk traffic, which feels roughly like having 200 billion very random people squeeze into your bus every second. For the most part, it was a relatively new type of DDoS known as Tsunami SYN flood, but the attackers have shown some flexibility in their methods and adapted to changes pretty quickly.  The garbage traffic came from about a hundred thousand infected servers, most noticeably, in LeaseWeb B.V., Hetzner Online AG, PlusServer AG, NFOrce Entertainment BV, Amazon and Comcast networks. That said, the attack was distributed evenly across thousands of hosts and none contributed more than 5% of the total volume.  Fighting back would‘ve been a little easier, if the abuse departments in most of the mentioned companies didn’t process requests 9-5, Mon-Fri only. (Hours more befitting a scuba-diving shop in Vatican.)  Who's behind this?  Orchestrating a DDoS attack is a criminal offence in most countries and wouldn't bring good publicity to a company, so attackers usually hide their traces as best they can. It could be an angry government, but an unhappy competitor seems much more likely.  By now we know that the attack is being coordinated from East Asia.  We've noticed a three-fold increase in signups from South Korea in the last two weeks. The last time we were hit by a massive DDoS was in late September, 2014, in the wake of the South Korean privacy scandal when signups from that country spiked as well.  We've also heard that some companies are unhappy with our new platform that allows artists to create free custom stickers for the users. Two weeks after its launch we were hit by a lesser DDoS, also aimed specifically at the Asia Pacific cluster.  What's next?  Attacks on the scale of the one we‘re facing today have become possible only recently and it’s the first time we‘ve met anything like this. But some of us have over 10 years of operating major web-services in Europe under our belts, so don’t you worry!  We've managed to stay online for 95% of our users worldwide. And as for defending the affected 5%, we‘ve got quite a few surprises up our sleeve. But we’d rather not talk about them here, since the attackers are certainly reading this as well. (hi there! ;)  So while we can't really tell you any details, we have good reasons to hope that connection will be flawless as usual for 100% of our users again. Take heart and tell your friends. Our sysadmin cyborgs are working on this 24 hours a day."

Telegram,3cswos,robin0van0der0vliet,17,Fri Jul 10 14:57:00 2015 UTC,Has nothing to do with security.    The way this works is whenever a device connects to a server it sends a request and the server responds to that request.    This type of attack sends thousands of requests at once to flood the server from getting any actual requests from legitimate users.    Think of someone calling you on your phone and you telling them what they're asking for. If suddenly you have tons of calls that are just people hanging up once you answer then you probably missed a legitimate call of someone who needed to talk to you.

Telegram,3cruqy,bitcoingfevermania,15,Fri Jul 10 07:08:05 2015 UTC,"Because big companies don't give a damn about optimisation. They only want the app to look nice. Just look at Facebook or snapchat, they both run like shit and 99% of the users don't care about it."
Telegram,3cruqy,Soyf,5,Fri Jul 10 07:22:40 2015 UTC,"Telegram was written for speed from the beginning. I examined the code for android and it really uses multithreadinh every where, meaning that almost no part of the app hangs when doing operations. Also, whatsapp really need to store the messages locally whereas for Telegram, it only needs to store the last few hundreds messages locally, and even so it can be done delayed, because failed write does not matter -- it will just download it again from the servers when needed."
Telegram,3cruqy,dombalaut,3,Fri Jul 10 11:45:17 2015 UTC,"I can confirm that: My iPhone 4 is now feeling old, and its single-core CPU struggles with many apps. Telegram is not one of those.   WhatsApp sometimes takes so long to open that the iOS watchdog kills the process. Besides, if it succeeds to open, it takes about half a minute for the GUI to respond kind of smoothly. It takes from 3 to 5 seconds to enter or exit to/from a chat. The keyboard is too laggy and uncomfortable... I laugh at each WhatsApp update when the 'optimizing WhatsApp' message appears (which by the way, takes too long and sometimes hangs at 100%).  Telegram is a new whole story: It is very fluid and lightweight, and one of the best optimized apps I ever experienced on my iPhone 4. And that's only about the iOS client optimization. But Telegram is far better in almost everything you can think of (speed, security and privacy, features, open API, cloud-based and synchronized, stickers, bots..). And the best is that it allows you to login from almost everywhere and at the same time (which in fact is a fairly common feature for almost any internet service...). I don't know what kind of OCD do the WhatsApp developers suffer from to have it locked to only one smartphone (and only smartphone, not tablet, nor computers... and don't dare to mention to me that ugly and non-sense whatsapp web client that requires your smartphone to be in the same wifi network).  BUT... people will still 'defend' WhatsApp because 'nobody uses Telegram'. In my case, my family uses it, and almost all my friends too. Fortunately, I don't need to open WhatsApp almost never. That piece of crappy software..."

Do you think Facebook is going to put much effort into maintaining it? Hah! Of course not. They want people to use their own messaging app.  Everyone should be trying to get your WhatsApp contacts to move to Telegram. Telegram is such a superior platform it's not even funny. I laughed out loud when I read about the way WhatsApp was implementing a desktop version, using your phone as a proxy.  Using the phone as a proxy. Seriously. Are they drunk or something? :) Even Facebook's own crappy messenger doesn't resort to such idiocy."
Telegram,3cruqy,zorinlynx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:41:19 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan on Telegram and making everything I can to have people migrate from WhatsApp to Telegram, but your comment on proxying is unfair.  Using the phone as a proxy is WhatsApp's way of providing end-to-end encryption on regular chats while using several devices. The conversation is (supposedly) encrypted end-to-end between your phone and your peer's phone, then again end-to-end between your phone and your browser (hence the QR-code you have to scan: it contains your identifier and a locally generated secret key to use between your browser and your phone). WhatsApp servers never see any decipherable content.  In comparison, Telegram only uses end-to-end encryption on secret chats, and those are only available on one device at a time."

Telegram,3b0lxa,AgustinD,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:51:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestion, but I think it's still a little over my head. I've been trying to invent the wheel, when it appears to have already been done in the form of long-polling(?).  I guess I should stop trying to write my own code to interact with the JSON output, and just look into implementing an already-established long polling method."
Telegram,3b0lxa,AgustinD,4,Thu Jun 25 04:09:02 2015 UTC,"The timeout=300 thing is exactly what long polling is. What you're doing when you constantly refresh the getUpdates entry point is called short polling, or simply polling.  If you do the same, but you allow the server to keep you waiting with the connection open until it has an update for you, then it's long polling.  When you set up long polling, you have to take into account that sometimes a TCP connection may close or drop (and stop working) without any way to know that has happened. So while in an ideal world a timeout=infinity would be most efficient, in the real world that may leave the server with a connection it thinks it's open indefinitely.  So the timeout is the maximum amount of time the server is willing to keep a connection open. After this time the server will send your computer a packet that tells it to close the connection, and the function that does network operation in your program will return at this point. If you miss this package, and you will miss it eventually, because it can be lost at any point between the server and your program, the function may never return. For this reason you must set a (keepalive) timeout for your network call, and it should be less than or equal to the server's.  In practice, the timeout you set for the network call/function is the maximum amount of time your bot will get stuck in the event of a temporary network failure.  I suggested 300 seconds because that's a pretty typical default value for the timeout."
Telegram,3b0lxa,AgustinD,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:35:34 2015 UTC,"So I need to modify my code to wait until the server closes its connection, for one reason or another? Doesn't seem like simply adding ?timeout= to my current getUpdates URL slows my loop down any. So I have to make my program wait for the server to actually close, which I guess requires some other function I'm not using.  Thanks again for the very detailed and informational posts."

Telegram,3b0lxa,vegbrasil,2,Thu Jun 25 05:18:47 2015 UTC,Correct. Also bots are expected to have a great uptime (24/7) and you need a server for that.  A $5 droplet from DigitalOcean would be plenty for a lot of bots.

Telegram,386rge,PenguinReddit,7,Tue Jun 2 07:36:52 2015 UTC,This has been one of my main grievances with Telegram. Suggesting things over telegram is an exercise in futility as you never know if what you tweet gets seen or not. You could try comments on their github (the github that hosts the client/app which you want to make a suggestion for)
Telegram,386rge,snorbaard,3,Tue Jun 2 11:48:15 2015 UTC,"Suggestions get analysed and discussed, and get added to a wishlist, which in turn is rated and put into development based on Telegram strategy, feature usefulness, and difficulty of implementation.  Very few developers are able to give direct feedback to users - this is disruptive and tends to lead to users demanding a specific feature be implemented over another."

I am sorry to say that, but I don't think that creating a new subreddit is a good idea: it disperses the effort instead of concentrating it.  I do agree the subreddit requires more moderators and the lack of answer from the current mod is frustrating, but looking to his interaction log in reddit, it seems he's away for a few days—which may have millions, acceptable reasons.

Telegram,36ocpi,nath_vringd,3,Wed May 20 22:01:49 2015 UTC,"4chan used to trade ""rare"" variations of images displaying a frog named pepe. That's where the phrase ""Now that's a rare Pepe!"" comes from.  They were kinda traded like trading cards or...well...stickers, ya know.  http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pepe-the-frog#rarepepe  I was just joking a bit but I would really find it funny if people started to trade sticker packs with Pepe images.

Telegram,368qqb,macman156,7,Sun May 17 06:55:28 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I didn't know about iMessage's encryption. I found this article which explains how encrypted messages are sent to multiple devices:   So if Apple never has your private key, how do messages arrive at all of your devices in a readable form? How do your private key(s) get from one device to the other?  Simple answer: they don’t. You’ve actually got one set of keys for each device you add to iCloud, and each iMessage is encrypted independently for each device. So if you have two devices — say, an iPad and an iPhone — each message sent to you is actually encrypted (AES-128) and stored on Apple’s servers twice. Once for each device. When you pull down a message, it’s specifically encrypted for the device you’re on.   So it's possible, but Telegram hasn't done it yet."

I did this with all the people, I care too much to write via Whatsapp with them and I never failed. Why? Because I annoyed them to join me on Telegram. Every time I saw them using Whatsapp, I just dropped a ""Download Telegram!"". If they asked:""Why, there are no people?"" - I said something like ""It s free. And you can use it via PC and Tablet and Mobile the same time. And sharing things is better compared to Whatsapp"". This usually didn't crack them up, but accompanied by my frequent ""Download Telegram"" they started to think of Telegram, whenever they saw me, and because of beeing my friend, at one point they all wanted to do me that easy favour, I kept asking them about: Downloading Telegram - to make him happy."

And do you know the development cycle of Telegram is monthly? And have you read the responses of Telegram over these concerns?  Seriously, your judgement over the app seems 100% based on others' experience than your own. I am not a security expert, but if I had to criticize a protocol, I would analyze two things:   have people already solved the problem? is it the main concern of the app?   Look, I imagine that most of the Telegram users are not active users of the secret chat features, a feature inexistent in Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Google Hangouts, Viber just to name a few. You should consider that maybe most of the users of Telegram uses it for other reasons. But all your criticism is solely based on the security issue (that I agree it is important)? So I imagine that you aren't a social network user and do all your communications through secure systems, exchanging emails using PGP and just use the WhisperSystems for mobile texting. Otherwise, you should take it in your criticisms and address the technical problems in a technical way and not being a parrot of others' opinions."

But, as a premise, they are simply one more voice in the ocean of bloggers that I don't take by grant.  But after some bad blood between some security experts and Telegram team, I am very suspicious of any analysis.

You can send files up to 1.5 GB (no one is going to send that much but it sounds impressive and, more importantly, it means you can send long videos without losing quality). 3). With the latest update, you can search for gifs and images online within the app, which is awesome quite frankly. 4). Most importantly, it's a lot more secure (even without using secret chats). 5).

The major reasons I give when trying to convince people are:   Single account on multiple platforms.  For me, there is no greater feature than being able to pick up a conversation on my PC, tablet or phone.  WhatsApp simply cannot do this. The desktop client(s) are good - REALLY good.  I use them extensively throughout the day and features like copy and pasting images directly in-line are fantastic.  Even the web client supports this! Search.  Cannot say enough about the power of Telegram's search feature. Customization of notifications for individual chats and groups The new replies and mentions features in groups are brilliant And then the usual advantages (privacy, large files, larger groups etc)   Its hard for me to explain why I like Telegram so much, but I just love what they are doing.  Every update brings features and enhancements that are useful.  I guess I am spurred on by the fact that it is the underdog despite being a CLEARLY superior platform in every way imaginable."
Telegram,311x5q,StNickZA,4,Thu Apr 2 12:55:38 2015 UTC,"I just ask friends to try Telegram and then they see that:   I answer to messages sent with Telegram much faster then to ones sent with Whatsapp. It is because my phone  is charging somewhere in my flat and Telegram for desktop or for tablet is almost always available. Cloud is great advantage. Each time I need to send a pdf file or anything but photos, I tend to use Telegram. So my friends can see how helpful is ability to send any type of files with messenger.   P.S. I use both messengers: WhatsApp for new contacts and for the girlfriend and Telegram for close friends and co-workers. And I don't think that Telegram is much more secure: WhatsApp messages sent from Android to Android are encrypted by default, like secret-chats in Telegram."

Telegram,30b6pg,themegabyte,1 point,Sun Apr 5 17:26:03 2015 UTC,Good point but I have my real name 'put up' from the start... so my genuine friends know it's me. I dont want to put a fake name. I did want someone once to contact me via Telegram but not know my real name. Guess I need a 2nd identity / Telegram account to do that but that is a pain on my phone as you have to use your phone number tied to your account. I would PREFER if Telegram didnt share ANY identifying info with others with whom I share my USERNAME only. That way I wouldn't have to have a 2nd Telegram account.
Telegram,30b6pg,BigBitFan,1 point,Sun Apr 5 18:22:12 2015 UTC,I think making it difficult to switch TG accounts on handsets is a way to prevent spam. Because the service degrades very much if spam accounts come up.   EDIT: And this is not a good thing especially when you are competing with whatsapp.

Since they already tried to give me every message I feel a bit insecure leaving and trying again (losing more messages I'd rather not), so I am either looking for a way to restore old messages, or to back up the current ones locally so I wont lose them."

Telegram,2wwlrc,dieortin,3,Tue Feb 24 19:41:30 2015 UTC,"The bit about reading messages in memory (that is, RAM) seems a bit unavoidable to me—sure, you could encrypt messages in memory, but then you would also have to keep the key unencrypted (if you want to provide a certain UX); an attacker would be able to access your messages anyway.  Keeping ""secret"" messages unencrypted on disk (i.e. in /data) is pretty serious, I hope the Telegram team fixes this soon. I'm unsure the best way… adding a passphrase that must be entered before viewing any secret chats?"

Simply download the file, convert it, and drag it into iTunes."
Telegram,2wcc45,snorbaard,3,Tue Feb 24 13:11:56 2015 UTC,I don't think that's possible on an iPhone since they don't have a filesystem. That's one of the reasons I prefer Android.  Maybe jailbreaking will help?

There most definitely is a filesystem. Apple just doesn't expose it to end users.   iOS users don't have to think, ""now was my image saved to my phone or my memory card? Under the user image folder? No, the app data folder? Oh what about a completely different folder? Oh %*&#"""
Telegram,2wcc45,snorbaard,1 point,Tue Feb 24 13:09:05 2015 UTC,"Lol, what? How is it FUD to point out that there's no user-facing filesystem? I know that you can expose the internal unix filesystem if you jailbreak but most people aren't going to do that. The fact is, on iOS there's no way to save an mp3 from one app and use it as a ringtone, while it's extremely easy on Android.    iOS users don't have to think, ""now was my image saved to my phone or my memory card?   This is pretty much the definition of FUD. Do you really think that this is a difficult issue that confounds Android users, and that the best solution is to not allow downloads at all?

Telegram,2wcc45,Zouden,2,Tue Feb 24 23:05:22 2015 UTC,"Well..  You said:   since they don't have a filesystem   There is no mention of a user-facing filesystem. By doing that, you're asserting something which is factually incorrect. Hence Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt.   The fact is, on iOS there's no way to save an mp3 from one app and use it as a ringtone, while it's extremely easy on Android.   Yes, this is correct. I pointed it out in another comment. (which I've now found is slightly inaccurate, since there's another app that now allows you to do that, but you still need a computer).   |iOS users don't have to think, ""now was my image saved to my phone or my memory card?  This is pretty much the definition of FUD.  Do you really think that this is a difficult issue that confounds Android users, and that the best solution is to not allow downloads at all? That's a pretty embarrassing argument    Well, you make two claims. I personally get the question from users, friends and family at least 3-4 time a week - ""I saved these pictures off Facebook, but I can't find them"" or ""My friend sent me this song. Where is it on my phone?"".   So yes, I think it's pretty confusing to many.  Whether it would be an embarrassing argument depends on how you feel about user interaction design, but I definitely didn't say anything about either being the best (or even better than the other)."
Telegram,2wcc45,snorbaard,2,Thu Feb 26 11:00:54 2015 UTC,"I just don't think it's fair to accuse me of spreading FUD; I phrased my answer to be as accurate as necessary for the question at hand without unecessary caveats. I suggested to the OP that jailbreaking would help,because I know that can give the user access to the filesystem. But I also know that the vast majority of users won't do that, so for the vast majority of cases my statement was both correct, and useful.     I saved these pictures off Facebook, but I can't find them   I just tested: photos saved from facebook are saved in /sdcard/DCIM/Facebook, which makes them appear in the gallery alongside photos from the camera. It literally could not be any easier to find those photos. I'm not doubting that you get those questions, but really, that's more a PEBKAC issue ;)   ""My friend sent me this song. Where is it on my phone?""   Music files will appear in all music apps, regardless of the folder that they're saved in, because Android runs a media-scanning service. So again, they're really easy to find. But the important thing is, both Android and iPhone users can ask that question, but iPhone users won't be happy with the answer."

It's based off phone numbers so if anyone in your contacts are on telegram it'll show up right away.  I've replaced facebook chat almost completely with the people i talk to on a daily basis.

Telegram,22cmv0,iamnotacopy,6,Sun Apr 6 15:57:43 2014 UTC,"No other response yet so I’m going to have a stab even though I have only a basic understanding of Telegram and cryptography.  When you use regular chat on Telegram, your communication to the Telegram server is encrypted, as is your friend’s. Your phone carrier, people eavesdropping on your WiFi connection and such are not able to read your messages. The Telegram server has access to all your messages and will store them so they can be synchronised between devices. This means that anyone with access to the Telegram servers (be it with a search warrant or whatever) will be able to read your messages.  You <==secure==> Telegram <==secure==> Friend   When using an encrypted chat, the encryption keys are only held by your and you friend’s device. No one between you and your friend’s devices can eavesdrop on your conversation.  You <==secure==> Friend   In general, with this kind of encryption, decrypting an encoded message would take a ludicrous amount of time. The danger lies in weaknesses with the algorithm or implementation, and of course social engineering (like phishing). Telegram’s encryption appears to be partially hand-rolled, which is probably a bad thing.  Hopefully someone else can add to this. If something’s unclear I’ll try to clarify."

And as far as I am aware, group chats in Cryptocat use custom crypto too, only two person chats use a standard, OTR. Also, I'm reading the article you linked, and it's exploiting a third party client which did not follow the standards set by Telegram rather than any official client.  I wouldn't call Telegram secure myself purely because it stores all your conversations on their servers and even if both participants delete the threads you're basically relying on the Telegram team being honest in removing them from the servers.  That said, as far as the data on servers goes, this thing is Russian. While the Russian government may very well look at the data stored [edit: the company isn't even based in Russia, so even this isn't a concern], we can also be pretty sure they won't let the NSA or GCHQ in either unlike WhatsApp (now it's owned by Facebook) and pretty much every social media platform.

I have never contributed to open source before.  How do you go about doing that?

I see you are saying that your pull requests have been ignored.  Are those requests supposed to allow you to push your new features after you merge your code in? or do they serve another purpose?  Also, I guess someone has to look at what you did before you push it in. how does it happen?  Thanks!"
Telegram,1zgg6y,liq_weed,2,Mon May 12 17:17:24 2014 UTC,"Hey,  No worries.  If you want to contribute to open source you really need to just find something you like/want to work on and go for it.

The more you work with the code the easier it will be to add more things afterwards, etc.  My pull requests were ignored by the devs, yeah. Communication is quite disorganized. Then the whole Telegram shitstorm happened with the ""security prize"" that really was just a load of bullshit, so I decided to leave all things Telegram for good. It is a decent project to start on though.  Pull requests are pretty much you saying ""Hey, I've written this code in my own fork of your application and want you to integrate it into your existing code. Take a look and let me know.""  Then they need to approve/reject the pull request, and your code will be integrated depending on that. One of the actual devs needs to make that decision."

Telegram,1zf5jr,fiesco,5,Mon Mar 3 08:37:45 2014 UTC,Telegram's power comes in it's openness. Also the reason that all chats aren't encrypted end-to-end all of the time is to provide a convenience feature: having your messages synced everywhere.
Telegram,1zf5jr,neilalexanderr,4,Mon Mar 3 09:32:04 2014 UTC,"Firstly, Twitter had an extremly open API in the beginning too. With the success this openness was hardly cut. Who is telling you the same won't happen with Telegram? Exactly: No one! Secondly, the syncing of your messages to all your devices could be implemented with full encryption too (not only transport). It would take setting up an end-to-end encryption between all of your devices and a little computing power. Furthermore the advertised decentralisation is a joke regarding privacy. A few servers at the same location or a few servers at a few chosen locations don't have much of an impact for privacy concerns. Might be different for speed concerns.  To conclude I don't have a lot of trust in this solution so far. Too many awkward or halfbaked implementations."
Telegram,1zf5jr,neilalexanderr,0,Mon Mar 3 10:14:14 2014 UTC,"Well, that's a fair response, but at least the details of the Telegram protocol and key exchange etc. are known, published and verifiable. It's not really enough to just hope that Threema and the likes will be open-sourced. Besides, I'm not really sure how much I should trust any messaging platform from a pure privacy perspective."
Telegram,1zf5jr,neilalexanderr,1 point,Mon Mar 3 11:08:48 2014 UTC,"You have a point. The alternatives (e.g. Threema) have also their downsides and so it seems that there isn't any really good solution so far. However, I disagree with the implicit statement in your last sentence. Of course you shouldn't trust any messaging platform for sensitive data. But that doesn't mean that you shouldn't try to protect every ""non-sensitive"" message you send as much as possible. Usually the argument is that the lack of protection/encryption is due to convenience reasons. But the inconveniences occur only because of bad implemented encryption solutions. So in the end I'm still not really sure how much better Telegram is in comparison to What's App (besides Open API). I would say not so much. Just a small step."
Telegram,1zf5jr,willwhitworth,2,Mon Mar 3 13:16:56 2014 UTC,"Telegram maybe should follow suit from iMessage, and allow cloud storage of messages for all devices by having the sender encrypt the message for each of the recipient devices by making the public key for each device available to the sender. That would near-enough solve the issue. (The only thing it wouldn't do is allow someone to get their old messages from a newly registered device, but that would not be the end of the world.)"

Telegram,1z62ks,gottmar,3,Fri Feb 28 09:43:11 2014 UTC,Yes. They have to store your non-secret chats on their servers for you to be able to see the chat on multiple devices.

Telegram,1z62ks,fiesco,1 point,Mon Mar 3 10:22:29 2014 UTC,"That would only work for your devices that were signed in at the time the message was sent.  If you signed in from a new device, you'd have no way to view messages that were sent prior to that sign in."
Telegram,1z62ks,skrowl,0,Mon Mar 17 19:12:52 2014 UTC,Call it a safety feature. In case someone is able to compromise this he won't at least be able to see all of your message history (analoguous to PFS).
Telegram,1z62ks,fiesco,0,Wed Mar 19 10:31:51 2014 UTC,"That's exactly how telegram secret chats work.  Telegram gives you the option to use secret chats if you want end-to-end encryption OR you can use a normal chat if you want to access from multiple devices.  I don't see the problem in offering the option to use either, or how having the option to access your chats from multiple devices is a ""dumb implementation""."
Telegram,1z62ks,skrowl,0,Wed Mar 19 12:53:02 2014 UTC,Encryption benefits only by encrypting everything. Encrypting selectively lowers your utility rate as it makes you an interested target but doesn't give you a higher security level for your standard messages. My argumentation is based on that the way of implementing these secret chats in Telegram will lead to a general disregard of this option as it gives you little convenience. Therefore it is a dumb implementation.
Telegram,1z62ks,fiesco,1 point,Wed Mar 19 13:09:10 2014 UTC,I think you misunderstand how telegram works.  Standard chats are fully encrypted.   No one can intercept / read them unless they somehow compromised telegram's servers.

Telegram,1yned7,Rubberduck_LV,2,Sun Feb 23 09:47:11 2014 UTC,I've managed to make some of my friends switch to Telegram. Now I'm getting a lot of new contacts on Telegram thanks to the word of mouth!  You just have to spread the love <3

Telegram,1yned7,jay2011,3,Sat Feb 22 22:40:38 2014 UTC,Same here in Italy. It works like a charm now.
Telegram,1ym4wi,buedi,4,Sat Feb 22 10:07:52 2014 UTC,"If you register an account on your phone, you can use it on your tablet."
Telegram,1ym4wi,theknix,5,Sat Feb 22 10:24:18 2014 UTC,"Thanks, I think I understand. And messages will pop up on both devices then I suppose. So I should ""own"" both devices for secure communication :-)"
Telegram,1ym4wi,karelkok,5,Sat Feb 22 11:28:02 2014 UTC,You van only initiatie secure chats from the phone IIRC.
Telegram,1ym4wi,theknix,2,Sat Feb 22 15:05:14 2014 UTC,Depends on the client you use. Some lack the secure chat feature.
Telegram,1ym4wi,karelkok,1 point,Mon Feb 24 12:20:24 2014 UTC,The point was that it is technically impossible to initiate one from the desktop client.
Telegram,1ym4wi,theknix,1 point,Mon Feb 24 13:20:10 2014 UTC,That's not true. The problem is that most (all?) desktop clients don't have that feature at the moment.
Telegram,1ym4wi,neryuuk,1 point,Mon Feb 24 16:41:52 2014 UTC,"Every time you wish to login on a new device using that account (that mobile number) you'll get an SMS on that number, but you don't have to have Telegram on the device having that number. (But you need to own that number)"
Telegram,1ykp6i,Zerfox,1 point,Fri Feb 21 22:31:38 2014 UTC,Interesting decline before it hit it big

Telegram,1yj5yb,elpalace,2,Fri Feb 21 14:20:48 2014 UTC,It's that it? It's all it does?
Telegram,1yj5yb,derwinter,2,Tue Feb 25 23:19:03 2014 UTC,As far as I can tell: Yes.
Telegram,1yj5yb,mspykey,2,Tue Feb 25 23:21:25 2014 UTC,And I thought it refers to swearing. Stupid me.
Telegram,1yjc9l,DePingus,2,Fri Feb 21 14:34:41 2014 UTC,Github is merely an open repository. The app is doing stuff outside of github (Though I haven't checked the source code)
Telegram,1yfsij,rogowin,12,Thu Feb 20 13:24:02 2014 UTC,"Went from being the only one in my phonebook to have it last night, to 8 right now. It's going in the right direction in the Netherlands :)"

Telegram,1yfsij,conservant,7,Tue Feb 25 17:47:42 2014 UTC,"I've been using Telegram for a few days now. The interface is very similar to that of WhatsApp, so if you're switching over there is pretty much no learning curve associated with the transition. Also, Telegram uses end-to-end encryption and supports more file types - both of which seem like useful features.  If anyone is interested, there is a decent article on techcrunch discussing this utility."
Telegram,1yfsij,denfix,4,Fri Feb 21 03:35:49 2014 UTC,i just download it and go 4 friends to join me :)
Telegram,1yfsij,eliaspoveda,6,Thu Feb 20 14:06:51 2014 UTC,In Spain is getting quite popular.
Telegram,1yfsij,mikecouk,2,Thu Feb 20 15:46:18 2014 UTC,"installed it myself, got a few contacts on it already ! Love the fact it tells you when people join, and yes the Windows client is the killer feature for me."
Telegram,1yfsij,servowire,2,Mon Feb 24 09:24:45 2014 UTC,"Yes, I think that the notification that tells you when someone joins is a great idea!"
Telegram,1yfsij,Vartanyana,2,Mon Feb 24 11:18:50 2014 UTC,Mention the Windows desktop client as well :) https://tdesktop.com/

Telegram,1yfsij,klsajlafd,1 point,Mon Feb 24 10:00:36 2014 UTC,"You have to explain them why Telegram is so much better! And don't forget to tell them that Telegram is completely free, and it takes 1 minute to set up :)"
Telegram,1yfsij,Hrim,2,Sun Feb 23 17:39:15 2014 UTC,"I try to but they'd much rather just use imessage and sms. But since I don't have an iPhone my picture quality on sending and receiving is degraded so much, that's why I prefer services like telegram."
Telegram,1yfsij,Hrim,1 point,Sun Feb 23 17:51:21 2014 UTC,"people are going away from WhatsApp because of Facebook. Do they realize that Telegram is heavely influenced by VK.com, which is the Russian Facebook?"
Telegram,1yfvit,denfix,4,Thu Feb 20 14:06:14 2014 UTC,"What makes me prefer Telegram over WhatsApp and other popular messaging tools is that Telegram has an open protocol stack, a public API and open source applications.  In practice, this means:   The source code of the official apps can be inspected and verified You can use third party apps which already exist for lots of platforms It’s possible to run another network if you don’t trust the official Telegram server."
Telegram,1yfvit,RoadBikeDalek,1 point,Thu Feb 20 15:47:03 2014 UTC,:D thats a good question
Telegram,1yfvit,pepijn809,1 point,Fri Feb 21 11:20:36 2014 UTC,"Nothing is entirely safe, you should never assume that. Real paranoid people should build their own servers with own preffered encryption. For the masses this project is very interesting indeed.  I would love to see some changes and more clarity in how Telegram makes money. Also i would like it if they released the source code and server source codes, so that if you like you could create your own system. My idea would be, to create telegram in a way that linux did. The creators are the people who decide what is implemented. The people who work at the company wright the codes and inspect codes that an open source community sends in. Only by giving the entire source codes to a community , you will be able to win the battle of Instand Messaging!"
Telegram,1yfvit,theknix,1 point,Thu Feb 20 22:00:32 2014 UTC,The want to release the server code later this year.  https://twitter.com/telegram/status/436499912168316928
