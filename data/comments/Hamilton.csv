Hamilton,3e4kbi,clayRA23,6,Tue Jul 21 22:19:23 2015 UTC,Why are they trying to convince you not to do it? Cost? Some chemically-related danger involving that much hair?  I'm curious.
Hamilton,3e4kbi,CrimsonHarmony,3,Wed Jul 22 01:02:31 2015 UTC,"It's hard for me to say this without sounding horrible or judgmental myself (about ANC)but having grown up in that area, I'm not overly surprised that you felt judged and that's unfortunate. Definitely check out the suggestions given so far, I'm sure you'll be a lot happier with your experience."
Hamilton,3e4kbi,LaPewPew--,4,Wed Jul 22 01:35:03 2015 UTC,pureNV. go see the girl with the red hair
Hamilton,3e4kbi,another_plebeian,3,Tue Jul 21 22:46:54 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but in the same sentence you say you have no idea what to expect, but also that you don't think people in the industry should tell you what you should expect if it's not positive?  No judgement about colour - I had mine bleached and dyed bright colours for years.   The bleach really will wreck your hair, especially the long ends. Mine wasn't butt-long, but it was very long and after it got strawlike, it used to get into these horrible matted knots that would keep coming back in the same spots. It wasn't bad enough to make me stop dying it, but something to consider.   In addition, I had to at least double any product I used.   Obviously do what you want with your hair, but I'd recommend cutting it before dying it."
Hamilton,3e4kbi,apostrotastrophe,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:59:22 2015 UTC,"Completely agree based on personal experience as well...also, I know that there are some good quality products out there but I feel like the colour may cause issues such as fading quicker than normal? It's just a lot of upkeep in general which is also more potential for damage.   I'm in my early 30s and am paying for my hair colouring choices in life already :| haha"
Hamilton,3e4kbi,LaPewPew--,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:10:48 2015 UTC,"Most unnatural coloured hair dyes are vegetable based, so they can actually condition your hair. I'm sure there are ones that don't, but usually that's why they fade quicker than more natural-coloured (and ammonia-based) dyes. So the upkeep for the colour itself usually won't damage your hair.   The bleaching will, of course, but damage happens no matter what colour you go."
Hamilton,3e4kbi,Kyivlah,3,Wed Jul 22 04:52:14 2015 UTC,I would try Chelsey at Bent (located at king east and walnut) or Renate at Strut (located at hunter and walnut)

It's neither a restaurant, or a hangout, but it's a cool place with an amazing bakery. Be sure to try the apple cider donuts.   Schwaben Inn in Dundas is home cooked mastery for German food.

Hamilton,3dxt8i,GoodguyGerg,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:03:32 2015 UTC,"There's no reason for them to stop. Canada Post is profitable unless they do something to not be profitable (like a labour lock out, or buying a new fleet of trucks). They're going to dump 8000 good paying, low skilled jobs. They're shoe horning big ugly things onto peoples lawns, with little regard for what the community wants. They're reducing the security of the mail, packages and people going to retrieve their mail. There are better, cheaper alternatives to deal with decreased letter mail that are much less painful.  What I don't get the logic behind the support Canada Post gets for this. We are the shareholders to this company, they exist for us, and they're reducing our services and harming our economy. For what? So Deepak Chopra can get a bigger bonus? So the Harper Government can reap increased dividends and then privatize it? I don't understand why we're blithely letting them do this when every other first world post office seems to manage it."

Hamilton,3dxptl,MattRix,3,Mon Jul 20 14:27:27 2015 UTC,"Nothing except scale. This sort of thing sounds rare, but there should be care on hand should something go wrong.   which is suspected to have ignited due to the heat of the event’s lighting equipment   I would be surprised if anyone chose to bring an ignition source like a cigarette into the powder throws."
Hamilton,3dxptl,AnUnfriendlyCanadian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:24:36 2015 UTC,I wouldn't exactly be surprised... I mean it's kind of scary to think that's a single cigarette might be for the whole thing to go up in a huge explosion (they think that might have been the cause of the Taiwan thing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formosa_Fun_Coast_explosion)   It just seems like an unnecessary risk.
Hamilton,3dxptl,MattRix,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:32:01 2015 UTC,"You're right, people have done stupider things. Apparently it doesn't take all that much to ignite. Saw this video of a corn starch explosion in a lab and now I'm not so sure of myself."

It's a mix of sand and rocks, but I'd say more sandy. If you park in the grass lot by the marina, it's only a 2-5 minute walk to the beach (we like to scope out the boats in the marina). Or if you drive a bit longer (past the ball hockey rink) you can park even closer to the dog beach.It's also nice to walk around the park a bit to let the dog dry off before you head home!

Just having the NBC studio HD feeds alone makes FTA satellite worthwhile as the picture quality is even better than OTA! NBC carries Sunday Night Football so plenty of NFL action there!

Hamilton,3dpmzi,bigtimegiraffelover,2,Mon Jul 20 14:05:01 2015 UTC,"Placement definitely matters. Try to position your antenna as high as possible and away from any obvious line of sight obstructions.    I use this Kross amplified antenna and only got 20+ after mounting it outside. It's usually 13 or so inside. I also pointed it up to the sky (to get any signals bouncing in the stratos? or whatever phere it is) around ~72 degree angle from the horizon and east toward the precise Buffalo tower(s) direction (using an compass app on my phone), noted on my Tvfool report.  Aside from the free aspect of OTA, there's something cool about receiving an HD signal from 60+ miles/100+ kms away, that's why I'm curious about FTA as well.  There's this installer guy in Pickering / Ajax on YouTube with a similar antenna and he gets ~45 channels, as a result of no interference across Lake Ontario and Pickering's proximity to Rochester, Syracuse, Buffalo and the CN Tower."

What I mean is, is this something I could do extremely part-time while off shift from work in order to earn some extra dollars? Could I do it with a somewhat-dirty / run-down car and just charge people less or something?"
Hamilton,3djxzo,giygas73,2,Thu Jul 16 23:05:34 2015 UTC,"You can definitely do it part time, it requires a 4-door car that is from 2000 or newer (you may need a slightly newer car in the GTA, not 100% sure). You don't choose how much to charge, that's all handled by Uber's system. If your car is actually dirty/run-down, there's a good chance you will get bad reviews, which you definitely don't want. FWIW I've taken UberX a bunch of times in San Fran and LA, and the cars have always been <5 years old and pristine condition."
Hamilton,3djxzo,steamwhistler,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:58:45 2015 UTC,"ahh, reviews, I see. Makes sense. My car probably wouldnt fly as is lol.  I'm working shifts at the moment so it sounds appealing on a part-time basis though, might look into it if it gains popularity in the city."
Hamilton,3djxzo,MattRix,12,Fri Jul 17 17:07:31 2015 UTC,"I have an opinion that's unpopular on mainstream reddit. It's not that I'm anti-Uber, per se, but I'm concerned enough about Uber that I'm not ready to welcome it into my community with open arms.  It comes down to business ethics. This article is one of the better summaries I've read on the issue, and the TLDR is that Uber sets a bad precedent in how you treat your employees--or partners, as Uber calls them. Since drivers aren't technically employees it means they don't get any job security, they don't have proper insurance or other labor protections, and their wages suck. Uber may be an enticing option for your average client, but it royally sucks for anyone who needs special accommodation, like room for a wheelchair or a mobile oxygen tank. Obviously Uber isn't going to put Hamilton taxi services out of business overnight, but if it eventually does, what we're left with is a service that's more exploitative of its workers than the current one, and a service that has no accountability to people with disabilities.  When these new internet-based services come along, it's really cool at first because it's shaking up the establishment and bringing much-needed modernization to an industry. But when Uber becomes the only thing anyone uses, like Amazon is with books, it'll be too late to ask these questions.  Anyway, I'm willing to have my mind changed on this at some point, and I realize a bunch of you in /r/hamilton might be looking forward to being Uber drivers, either full-time or just for some extra cash, and that's fair enough. I just think we need to be conscious of who we're inviting in and what we're setting ourselves up for."
Hamilton,3djxzo,steamwhistler,4,Thu Jul 16 23:19:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're not wrong, but this is pretty much how capitalism works, so it's inevitable eventually.

Replacing taxis is just one step along the way."

Hamilton,3djxzo,steamwhistler,2,Fri Jul 17 13:54:44 2015 UTC,"I think if anything we need to shake up the taxi industry.

So what you're saying is that we get Uber in to force the taxi industry to change, and foster some nice healthy competition to make standards continually rise? I dunno, I just don't see it playing out like that. It's more likely that Uber corners the market pretty quickly, and then we're stuck with an overall worse system than we have now."

Hamilton,3dioc3,UberTorontoDiscount,3,Thu Jul 16 16:51:17 2015 UTC,It's definitely confusing. I thought in the original article they said it took two guys with bats to get the dog off of the guy. Then all the second article said the death wasn't a result of the dog and that was it but didn't say he wasn't attacked.
Hamilton,3dioc3,spermdonair,8,Thu Jul 16 17:02:23 2015 UTC,My thought is the dog freaked the fuck out when the guy walking it suddenly dropped dead in front of it.

Hamilton,3dgw04,Gerdius,3,Thu Jul 16 04:28:43 2015 UTC,This is definitely the way to go. Even if you could find one to buy Cogeco will not allow you to use a purchased modem.
Hamilton,3dgw04,spermdonair,2,Thu Jul 16 11:41:53 2015 UTC,"I think Cogeco locks the coax to the modem, as such he is unable to exchange it himself (Which is a stupid practise in my eyes)  He is probably planning on splitting it himself......unless I'm just reading too much into this."
Hamilton,3dgw04,ThrillHo3340,2,Thu Jul 16 12:21:10 2015 UTC,They lock it if you have Cogeco Home Phone for 911 compliance. Those modems (known as eMTAs) require a technician to swap out anyway. A standard Internet only modem can be swapped at the storefront.
Hamilton,3dgw04,Gerdius,2,Thu Jul 16 12:50:40 2015 UTC,"I was told they lock all modems, I've worked for 3 cable companies and I have never heard of locking a DPT (Or eMTA) for 911 compliance.  I know of a few who do not for a fact."
Hamilton,3dgw04,ThrillHo3340,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:21:46 2015 UTC,"Hmm...they shouldn't be locking internet only devices. The 911 compliance thing is only what I was told, and I know they lock eMTAs 100% of the time, but Internet modems are supposed to be unlocked for easy exchange (Cogeco now has 5 different modems and some can only support certain speeds)."
Hamilton,3dgw04,Gerdius,2,Thu Jul 16 16:28:36 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that unlike DSL, you can't simply use any modem with Cable Internet and have it work right away as the modem's MAC address (i.e. kind of like a serial number) needs to be registered with the Cable provider.  With this in mind, you have to make sure that the used modem you are buying is not associated with an existing account or else it will be very hard to get it added to yours, especially if the existing account has an amount owing on it."
Hamilton,3dgfw3,orange905,2,Thu Jul 16 01:59:05 2015 UTC,I notice the same thing when I was there for a game on Sunday. It's super annoying not being able to see the replays. I am guessing they don't show them so as to not incite the crowd into getting upset against the ref in-case there is a bad or questionable call.
Hamilton,3dgfw3,theninjasquad,2,Thu Jul 16 02:47:44 2015 UTC,I would rather they not show anything than show only half of it.
Hamilton,3dgfw3,Just_Look_Around_You,2,Thu Jul 16 03:16:39 2015 UTC,"Close, but I think there's better reasoning for it. My best guess is that it's so that the refs can't use the replay to make their calls. Instant replays are not a part of the referee decisions in soccer and it would be unfair for them to sometimes catch it and sometimes not."
Hamilton,3dgfw3,theninjasquad,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:36:38 2015 UTC,"That's possible but I feel like that is unlikely. The replays usually come up long enough after the play is called. More importantly, soccer referees can't change the call after they've made it."
Hamilton,3dgfw3,Just_Look_Around_You,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:12:19 2015 UTC,"That's exactly why that's in place. In soccer, decisions are swift and final. If no replays are available, no refs will even try to stall for them."
Hamilton,3dgfw3,hodadthedoor,2,Mon Jul 20 12:26:54 2015 UTC,I'm so glad I'm not alone on this. I was at the Brazil vs Canada game and the only replays they showed were goals. For other key moments they'd show a second of replay then snatch it away as if they're deliberately taunting us. It was making me so pissed.
Hamilton,3dgfw3,mattgrande,2,Thu Jul 16 04:07:17 2015 UTC,I've also heard that you can't leave the stadium between the two games? Is that true?
Hamilton,3dgfw3,benjarvus,2,Thu Jul 16 11:51:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you can't leave, you're out for good."
Hamilton,3dgfw3,mattgrande,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:25:49 2015 UTC,That's bunk. Looks like I'm only going to the one game tonight.
Hamilton,3dgfw3,Just_Look_Around_You,2,Thu Jul 16 19:52:51 2015 UTC,"Yup. It explains in large part why games are half filled. No one wants to sit in a stadium for 5 hours and people are usually only interested in one of the two games. Asa result, you get this stupid situation where you go online to buy tickets and there aren't any yet the stadium is half filled for each of the two games. Really annoying."
Hamilton,3dgfw3,MattRix,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:38:09 2015 UTC,No idea.
Hamilton,3dgfw3,Just_Look_Around_You,2,Thu Jul 16 13:02:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah this is a thing for all soccer games pretty much everywhere, it happens all the time at TFC games. Might even be a FIFA rule or something. It's because showing that a ref got a call wrong can rile up the players and the fans.   That said, showing a replay right up to the critical moment but then cutting away is a bit of a dick move :P"

Hamilton,3dek60,Chevellephreak,6,Fri Jul 17 01:22:37 2015 UTC,If men could get pregnant abortion would be legal /rant  What about rape babies? Should a person be brought into this world if it was a product of rape? That would fuck them up for life. Or how about if the child will kill the mother if she goes through with the pregnancy? Are her rights just wiped away because of people and their 'pro-choice'?   I'm so happy I don't live down the mountain.

I saw a friend of mine walking past. His daughter was in tears because these people gave her a flyer that clearly displayed an abortion.   They're habitual line steppers.

If you like freedom of speech so much why dont you ignore them and let them campaign? Freedom of speech and expression covers both your views as well as theirs. Thats what an open society like ours is all about. And on ypur second point, yes children are going to see it.

Hamilton,3de0m1,Thetealsnake,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:38:24 2015 UTC,"My fault, I didn't explain any of it in this vlog. I did explain a little bit in a past video because I was trying out something for a photoshoot, but it didn't work out. Ill explain it here.  If you hold up a florescent tube under high voltage power lines, I think they need to be 300kV or more, then the high voltage differences between the lines and the ground create a huge energy potential. This energy excites the gas inside the florescent light and causes it to glow slightly. Its fun to do but difficult to capture on camera without doing a long exposure. You can kind of see it in the video when Abdul is holding it, but not strong. Just a bit if flickering. Its a fun experiment and looks really cool in person.

Hamilton,3df7i6,Amerinuck,0,Wed Jul 15 22:32:04 2015 UTC,It's a hot market!  I've sold 10 houses this year.  All but one of those sales was to buyers fleeing the housing prices in the GTA.  These GTA housing refugees are doing wonders and cleaning up the city.  Price is no obstacle to them.
Hamilton,3df7i6,naturehattrick,2,Wed Jul 15 22:41:34 2015 UTC,What about land outside the city or on the fringes of the city? Hot aswell?
Hamilton,3df7i6,hodadthedoor,0,Wed Jul 15 23:29:15 2015 UTC,The fringes of the city are equally hot.  I don't know about housing outside the city.  Check with a realtor in the city you are refering to instead?  Hamilton has the hottest marking in the country at the present moment.  Year over year price gains are outpacing Toronto and Vancouver.  Now is the time to get into the Hamilton market.  GTA buyers are moving in fast this summer.  It will be too late for first time buyers who fail to buy now.  Otherwise you might want to teach yourself how to check for mold in the basement apartments that you will be stuck living in...

Hamilton,3df7i6,SerenityM3oW,2,Thu Jul 16 02:56:23 2015 UTC,"Not immune, but more likely to continue climbing than other cities. If you look at Burlington as a nearby example, freehold townhouses now start at $350,000. Don't even ask about detached. People who can't afford there are now moving to Hamilton, driving up the price. Even if prices were to stabilize in Burlington, they will continue to climb in Hamilton due to the comparative affordability."

Yes it's a federal issue, but there's no reason the city couldn't create a ""bridging"" program for those not being serviced.  Instead: parking spots."
Hamilton,3d7q95,ManofManyTalentz,3,Wed Jul 15 03:43:08 2015 UTC,"an excellent point. Sadly, this required more planning, more budgeting, more vision, and more leadership than a simple ""stop tagging these red-marked plates"" to the police services."
Hamilton,3d7q95,DietOfTheMind,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:32:20 2015 UTC,"If your original focus was mental health then why did you mention PSWs?   Based on the two articles there are 270 000 veterans eligible for a veteran's license plate, and 15000 currently receiving assistance for mental health. At 5.5%, this means there would be roughly 605 veterans currently already receiving mental health assistance in Hamilton. Currently, only 20% of new applicants have to wait longer than 8 months, with the majority receiving assistance much sooner. We have no available statistics as to the number of new applicants each year through either article, but if the total to date is in the hundreds, I can't imagine any individual year would have more than a few dozen new applicants locally. It wouldn't take 1.4 million to service those individuals more quickly, and that isn't even the type of assistance they're talking about. There are also numerous free programs for individuals seeking mental health assistance here in the city, veteran or not."
Hamilton,3d7q95,fartmasterzero,3,Wed Jul 15 03:56:28 2015 UTC,"There are also numerous free programs for individuals seeking mental health assistance here in the city, veteran or not.   If you're implying there's anywhere near adequate mental health supports in this country, I assume you don't work with the system you're talking about.  Additionally, my grandfather was a vet, and he did not get all the PSW support he needed, thus mentioned.  If the city wanted to design a program that helps the most in-need vets the least, they hardly  could've picked a better one than subsidizing parking.  It literally would have been better to just send every vet a cheque every year.  Take a minute and think about how stupid an idea it is to send a non-geared to income cheque to all vets, and then absorb the fact that it's a better idea than what the city just passed.  And if anyone says ""how could they send a cheque, they don't know what this program will cost?"".  Good point.  Maybe the city should stop passing policy with a freaking question mark where the total cost should be."

""why should they get free parking?"" implies the missing second half ""....and I dont?!""

BTW, the cops did stop them... that's why damages were limited to only $600. The illuminated pylon type sign in front of the the police station is probably worth in excess of 5,000, as I have considerable knowledge and exposure as to what signs cost.      Why should 20 year olds' be given a free pass for being drunk? Here's a novel concept... Everyone needs to take ownership of their actions and bear the consequences those actions.

FWIW, I don't think you can reasonably expect something like that to work at a certain level of professionalism and success below a certain ticket price (although, sadly, IME there are plenty that don't work, that charge the same price or more...)  Any kind of festival involves a fair amount of sunk costs. I'd wager the music side of things isn't a huge amount relative to other line items in the production budget - and since Sonic Unyon is involved, I'm guessing there's some in-kind or decent working relationships involved due to other things they are involved with).   I'll be honest, the music wasn't why I went either - but reckon they got it right for the event, which is a pretty challenging task. Most of it wasn't my thing personally, but it certainly wasn't bad by any stretch - indeed, what I can remember hearing seemed perfectly good, and certainly wasn't pissing me off or detracting from the overall - and it felt more like a proper festival because of having some musical presence. Also, I think they had the sound levels just right. It was there and perfectly easy to listen to if you wanted that, but didn't drown out the socializing and conversations with stallholders which took up most of my non-drinking time ;)  The better beer festivals I've been to here and in the UK have had music of some sort going on, and I think it's been a non-trivial part of something that's good to have there - for sure, not critical - but adds to the overall feeling of a good-quality event I'd want to come back to."

Sadly, I knew I wasn't going to be able to sample all the beers, so instead I focused on trying the ones that I hadn't had before.    I liked the music lineup much better this year than last year.  Elliott Brood on Saturday night really rocked the place.   Knowing how the organizers work, and how they always try to step up the game every year, I can't wait till next July!"
Hamilton,3d4jx0,rands2113,3,Mon Jul 13 16:03:43 2015 UTC,"I loved it as usual, it's a great time by the pier great food choices as well and the selection of craft beers was awesome. Collective arts has been my favourite beer since i started drinking craft but shout outs to flying monkey , nickel brook and beau's for some great selections. The prices for tokens went up from last year though which means it's getting more business. Last year it was dollar for dollar in tokens."
Hamilton,3d4jx0,AlienVredditoR,3,Mon Jul 13 15:46:28 2015 UTC,"Interesting... but it's still pretty damn good value. I believe it's on a par with other beer festivals in the area, which seems fair to me.  Also, who's benefitting? Small scale local breweries and organizers that are trying to do the right thing (and hopefully ensure that the whole thing stays solvent so they can continue to do a good job without compromising). I'm OK with that."
Hamilton,3d4jx0,JBHammer,3,Mon Jul 13 16:15:16 2015 UTC,"That's a good call, it all benefits local which is what we want if we all want something like this to continue yearly. A couple years ago I went to the Toronto Beer Fest and they had glass steins, the year after they switched to plastic but kept the prices the same, I guess many people there were more rowdy."

Hamilton,3d57ej,Hydrua,11,Mon Jul 13 16:51:05 2015 UTC,"You tap on your initial trip and just keep tapping for any following trip. I believe on HSR trips you have 2 hours to complete trip. Also if you go somewhere like a shop and can do all your shopping within your initial tap's 2 hour limit, you can get your ride back home free.  Also using HSR to get onto the GO will only cost you 50 cents if you're using your Presto. It will charge you the regular amount and then minus that for your GO trip tap, and from GO to HSR you'll only get charged the 50 cents. I believe the time limit from GO to HSR to transfer are 3 hours. Not sure but I'm guessing once you tap onto HSR from GO your transfer limit will reset back to the 2 hours that HSR gives for their transfers. The time limit should show on the tap screen after you tap it."
Hamilton,3d57ej,ButtonsTheMonkey,4,Mon Jul 13 17:53:17 2015 UTC,"For any transfer it's timed based I believe. You'll have to tap again when going on a new bus, if you're within their transfer time it won't charge you twice."

Hamilton,3d57ej,Ronin-,3,Tue Jul 14 14:00:39 2015 UTC,Seems like it answers the question decently: If your transit agency offers a transfer on your PRESTO card simply tap on when boarding a connecting vehicle and PRESTO will automatically determine if you’re eligible for a free transfer.

I enjoyed a samosa from the indian food tent.   I did find the vendors to lacking this year over past years. Though out of all of the years I've been to the festival I've probably spent under $40 on vendor stuff.
Hamilton,3d4dyx,kaisao,3,Mon Jul 13 16:06:28 2015 UTC,"Sold five of my Vampire Lestat water colours, six of my Billy Ray Cyrus pencil drawings, three support the troops bracelets and 100 or so Sons of Anarchy temporary tattoos.

Hamilton,3d4dyx,fartmasterzero,3,Tue Jul 14 01:42:36 2015 UTC,"Loved it!  I'm biased; grew up next to Gage Park. So It's Your and Fest of Friends have been a part of my life growing up since I was a wee one.    I do agree, the vendors did not appear as plentiful as previous years. I was happy to see one African statue booth.  My mother has a growing collection of them, and she found a few to add to hers and some for gifts for family. I picked up a turtle for my own animal stone collection, never seen one of those before. Thought the sock booth was hilarious, debated but honestly I don't know where I'd wear them out to show them off. So in the end opted out.   The Trews were a blast Thursday, high energy, loved the Highway of Heroes with the Argyle Sutherland drums on stage, and the guitar solo with him using the bass drum. That was something I've never seen before!  I Mother Earth was also great, never seen them before at all. So didn't know what to expect. Really loved the vocalists' energy and enthusiasm with the crowd. Great songs too, lots that I knew from the radio.  Big Sugar, left early, I missed the songs that were my favourites (The Scene, I'm a Ram) at the end, but I could easily hear the concert on my front porch 20 blocks away further East. I thought it was really clean sounding sound system this year.  April Wine, I feel bad cause after the two youthful acts, I got bored a little too fast, still sounded a good show as I walked around, enjoyed some ice cream.    Ate out every night too, no cooking, no cleaning!! Oh yeah those gyros are sooo delicious, have to have them at least once per festival. The ribs were barely okay, I thought the sides of the potatoes and slaw were tastier. Narula's was also a big hit, very tasty, albeit I thought the portion size was a bit small but it filled me up good in the end.  The schnitzel on a bun, wow, you got your moneys worth for those, huge piece of meat!"

Hamilton,3d43ak,AndyC_een,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:25:43 2015 UTC,"The issue with this (a.k.a gentrification) is that it begins to raise the standard price for (mainly) food and housing in the area. While the richer residents can afford to keep up with this change, it quite directly forces lower-income residents to relocate, which itself is a costly procedure.   It has less to do with not liking ""pretentious attitudes"" and more to do with hoping that you can still afford to buy a coffee somewhere in your town by the end of the year, or hoping that some rich trendy upstart doesn't decide to renovate your neighbourhood which would likely result in raising the price of your rent.  Imagine living in a neighbourhood all your life where you have the means and money to subsist - you can afford to buy necessities and occasional luxuries from nearby stores, and you can comfortably afford housing. Then, someone swoops in and decides you don't deserve to live there because they want a trendy tourist location with grain-fed free-range chicken breast paninis and upcycled locally made silk scarves."
Hamilton,3d43ak,Soycrates,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:18:31 2015 UTC,"The reality for me at least is that this is exactly what took me out of Toronto and into Hamilton. I didn't spend my whole life in Toronto, but a good 15 years in a neighbourhood I loved, invested in (personally I mean - loving it, contributing to it, feeling like it was my home etc), and then it became trendy unbelievably expensive, and suddenly I couldn't afford to live there anymore, not even in a half-decent condo never mind a townhouse or a house. So I'm trying to make a new home here. And people here are mad at me and my kind for it. Which I guess is understandable... I'm not particularly mad at those who are able to pay the new high prices in my old neighbourhood, more just sad at the whole situation, but I can empathize with the sentiment here at least. I guess what I'm mostly trying to say is your new neighbours who've moved from Toronto aren't necessarily jerks (although maybe some are, jerks come in all shapes and sizes, and backgrounds), they're just folks caught by the same process and trying to make the best of it, as best they can."

Cable internet is more susceptible to slow times if your neighbors are busy, especially in a condo I would imagine.  I'd say the main competition in the area that matches our beats the price and operates the same way by sending bell techs is Velcom. Depending on when you look you can get a better deal with them for startup costs, but some of their dry loop monthly costs are more. Worth looking at anyway, I used to be with them and they were fine too."
Hamilton,3d2fdg,Poor_University_Kid,8,Mon Jul 13 01:20:37 2015 UTC,Teksavvy is great. They use bell lines. Bell had fantastic infrastructure (it was a crown Corp.) And is now required to let third party companies sell it's services.

It runs over Bell network so it's pretty much the exact same service, but cheaper with a higher useage limit (or none at all if you pay the extra $15 or whatever bucks).  The downsides are you have to buy the modem, you have to pay a setup fee and if you ever have an issue that needs a tech to come out, it's a Bell tech and since you're with Teksavvy they give you a low priority.  Plus side is the price, and the fact that that price doesn't go up every 6 months (like with Bell).  Also no contract, which you get billed for if you cancel.  But if Bell cancels it and proposes a new contract that you don't agree too, oh that's a fee too.  Cause you're cancelling, not them.  Their just not honouring the old contract, and instead following the new contract they've made.... sorry, bit of a rant there.  Seriously though, I recommend TekSavvy."

In exchange, Hamilton gets to host arguably the most prestigious event of the games with Men's and Women's soccer. It has also brought renewed interest to a city whose Renaissance is still in its infancy. Aside from the traffic inconveniences and the poor choice to keep the stadium where it is, I think the games are great for Hamilton."

Hamilton,3czg67,Ronin-,3,Wed Jul 15 09:26:18 2015 UTC,I can tell you this much I live in the downtown core and it's been dead all weekend
Hamilton,3czg67,Enviro_tech,3,Sat Jul 18 15:37:12 2015 UTC,"Art crawl was dead? Seemed like one of the biggest weekends for Hamilton in awhile pan am aside. Festival in Gage, festival at harbour, art crawl, treble hall flea, intl village bazaar, etc"
Hamilton,3czg67,mattgrande,2,Sun Jul 12 14:40:08 2015 UTC,I'm live above the store fronts on King and Mary and my apt over looks the municipal parking lots and there was next to no cars in the parking lot . The street where also dead when I got home from work at 9pm last night . Just though it was kinda of strange
Hamilton,3czg67,paul_33,3,Sun Jul 12 18:28:22 2015 UTC,Must have been the beer fest and its your fest @ gage. Heard both were very busy.
Hamilton,3czg67,legendarythomas,2,Sun Jul 12 18:35:05 2015 UTC,"I was at It's Your for all 4 evenings, and it was pretty hopping every night. Parking didn't seem too full tonight, but the crowd in front of April Wine told a different story.  Overall I'm pretty happy with the turnout for the festival, I've grown up next to Gage Park for 25 years and It's Your looks like it has been struggling for crowds in the recent years it seems. I think the move away from Canada Day festivities to coinciding with Pan Am festivities helped."
Hamilton,3czg67,AskamilliusReddiquis,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:56:06 2015 UTC,"I think you could make some pretty strong arguments that it cost too much money, but the ""actual games"" have been pretty great so far. I spent most of this weekend in TO for Rugby, and the games were super exciting, and the whole ""Pan Am Village"" was really well set up.  Beer was pricey, and there was some confusion when arriving (where to go, security, etc), but that seems par for the course of any large event/festival."

Hamilton,3cy031,Ronin-,11,Sat Jul 11 23:51:27 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. It's not something I'm really interested in championing, but you make some valid points.  edit: actually, I sort of disagree with the title of this thread, but the body of it is good. I don't think the subreddit has gone downhill really, but it could use an injection of energy to improve the theme and better celebrate the city and its history. Sometimes I can't tell the trolls from the real posts, because there are some inane questions that are genuinely asked occasionally."

But some are (particularly around the lack of moderation around trolls and moderator imposters and the lack of information made available in the sidebar).  As long as the discussion happens, I'm happy.  The community should make the decision over what changes are made, but I think it's time that this discussion happened."
Hamilton,3cy031,fastsitebuy,3,Sat Jul 11 21:28:50 2015 UTC,"I'm with you there. We just ""elected"" a new mod for this subreddit; but what exactly are the responsibilities of mods in /r/hamilton?

This a pretty sweet sub, a lot of people here have met up through different events. A lot of good stuff has happened. I've fixed a guys car and helped someone move off of here. Even little wee posts like that are solid community building content IMO. Lost pets etc too. We're just not getting enough posts every day for their to be a real reason to remove the trash. I'd love to advertise some of the auto work I can do on here but feels like a shitty thing to do tbh.

Hamilton,3cy031,MattRix,4,Mon Jul 13 12:34:01 2015 UTC,"Hey, I just saw this post (I was in Toronto all weekend). I understand where you're coming from.   Posts like that haven't been removed in the past because I, personally, often find them funny. Those posts are often upvoted, which leads me to believe the sub (in general) finds them funny as well). They're a reaction to the constant (albeit genuine) questions that keep getting asked here over and over (eg, where should I live, what's the best ISP, etc). It has been getting worse recently, though, and we're trying to clear it out. If you see stuff like this, report it. The high number of impersonation account is frustrating for me, personally. I try to remove them all, but whoever is doing it is incredibly tenacious. I recently reported many of the accounts to the admins, and sent them fifty six usernames of people impersonating mods (and other users) here. Beyond that, there isn't much we can do, as mods. On the side bar, you're right. I'll try and make an update tonight. I use this sub with RES, and I haven't had a problem. Can you expand on that? Mods can't remove ""higher ranked"" mods, so unfortunately, none of the active mods can remove non-active mods."
Hamilton,3cy031,Wonka_Vision,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:58:13 2015 UTC,"I can almost guarantee that a post with nude photos of queen elizabeth would hit the top of /r/programming, but it doesn't belong there and would be removed, regardless of how many upvotes it got.  Additionally, in regards to those troll questions that parody common ones, could those types of posts only be common beacuse there is no sidebar information answering the common questions that newcomers have? I'm glad to see the impersonator accounts being removed.  I'd recommend putting it in the sidebar that this is not allowed, and ask the community to report them if they see them.  Additionally, make it policy for all moderators to Distinguish their posts so users don't get caught up in the confusion. <3 sidebar content While there's nothing seriously broken, there are things that can be improved.  The overall theme is starting to look a bit dated, and a few things just need some TLC. Take a look at the spacing here, or the dark grey lines that separate posts but don't match anything else. I understand the frustration with legacy mods.  I've had to contact the admins in the past to finally get them to remove one (it took several weeks)"

Hamilton,3ct5r3,MikeCarnage,2,Fri Jul 10 22:51:40 2015 UTC,"Pretty cool, but a bit inaccurate? For example, Governors Road on the map shows a strip of new LED lights but they're still the old HPS ones. Maybe those will be changed over shortly? Also, I guess they aren't showing the older LED streetlights that the city put in earlier? For example, Main St. through the downtown is all LED, and James St. S has LED streetlights as well, but are not on the map. Those ones differ a bit as they aren't the GE LED streetlights that are being installed right now."
Hamilton,3ct5r3,AndyLH88,2,Sat Jul 11 03:22:38 2015 UTC,"This is a great map, good program, and they are making a good pace on the installs. I reluctantly state, only because I don't wish to be seen criticize the map, that I wish they made this open data as well."

Hamilton,3cqzpd,KingofCanadia,4,Fri Jul 10 05:23:59 2015 UTC,"I wasn't there, I have no idea what happened. But I wonder if the dog wasn't actually trying to save its owner? The story says the dog ""attacked"" once (which could have been a play jump?) and the guy collapsed, and then the dog kept at it after that... it doesn't make sense for a dog to keep ripping away at someone it knows and loves, except in the case where the guy is dead/dying and the dog thinks it's helping??? Maybe that's why the dog couldn't be fought off?  I don't know, there seems to be way more to the story, that's for sure. Sad for all.  Edited to add: oops. Just read the Toronto Star story witness account lined below: the whole thing was preceded by yank on chain and ""come here you fucking dog""... I've seen those types of dudes in East Hamilton, I went ballistic on one of them for hitting his dog repeatedly for not coming when called. Not proud of losing my own temper but yeah.

Hamilton,3cpcfe,couldnt-b-bothered,2,Thu Jul 9 18:47:19 2015 UTC,"I've done this myself in both directions, and have recommended to visitors to do the same.  The one person that decided they would just get a taxi from YTZ ended up paying ~$140, getting stuck in traffic jams, and wishing they'd just taken the train.  Depending on how much stuff you have to schlep, you can get a connecting bus from the downtown Hamilton GO station to Aldershot/Burlington which connects with plenty of time to spare.  From Union, it's a very short walk to the frequent Porter-branded shuttle (that is free for everyone that needs to use it - no need to show ticket or any crap like that).  If you're hell-bent on getting a shuttle (and can live with the inevitable traffic delays - the last part coming off the Gardiner can be the worst), I'd recommend Mermaid Limo. But even a cab to Burlington/Aldershot and connecting with GO will be less than half the price and a hell of a lot less stress for the final bit to/from YTZ."

While I do not own any dogs and do not claim to be an expert on pit bulls in general I feel they continue to get a bad rap.  They are a breed of dog that is capable of being aggressive if either trained to be or lack of training to be obedient.  That does not mean they are born that way.  My thinking is along the same lines that a Ferrari is a fast and is capable of speeding, it doesn't have to if the driver is capable of driving it at reasonable speeds.  The article doesn't mention what may have triggered the dog to attack and we may never know."
Hamilton,3cnwsf,HungryintheHammer,4,Thu Jul 9 14:10:22 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say that they are a breed that is capable of being aggressive over any other type of dog. The unfortunate thing is that pit pull type dogs have an intimidating look to them and are strong dogs. So if you're looking to have a dog that can ""protect"" they are a good breed. And in the wrong hands they can be made into vicious dogs. It's a shame and I feel bad for the dogs that are brought up like that. On the other hand, my relatives have had a couple of pit bull type dogs and they are big sucks and couldn't even think of hurting anyone."

Hamilton,3cnwsf,Voltrondemort,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:25:39 2015 UTC,"Wrote my undergrad thesis on canine behaviour, and actually, there is a death caused by a dachshund on the books.  The problem with this line of thinking is that 1) fatal dog attacks are incredibly rare and 2) disfiguring bites (the most common injury) can happen with almost any breed.    The other problem with targeting certain breeds is that it makes people think that other breeds are safe. People have done incredibly stupid things with my 80 lb. Labradors, because they are a 'friendly' breed.  All dogs will bite if put into the right situation. Breed bans ignore this."

The dickwad Bryant who banned pit bulls couldn't spot them, and since he's banned them, he's killed more people than pit bulls have.   In days gone by Rottweilers, Dobermans and German Shephards were the dog that needed to be banned, now it's pit bulls. Getting rid of the dogs obviously isn't the problem.

I have to agree... and I can see how that cost can add up over time for healthcare and enforcement. I totally agree with you there...  But try not looking at it from a strictly ""income statement"" angle; the damages that a pit bull can cause a family, even if it only happens once a year (which would indicate it was an infrequent incident) are horrifying. I agree that they happen rarely, but even if happening rarely, they results are just so terrible, that I feel aggressive measures are needed. If the worst that came of it was a few scratches, then yes; I agree with your statement that tries to downplay the brutality of pit bull attacks because of thier infrequency.  Ask yourself, which dog would you rather be attacked by: husky or pit bull? Lab or Pit Bull? Poodle or Pit bull? One does FAR FAR FAR (immeasurably) more damage than the other. Of course there are outliers here and there, but those are just that: outliers. Of all types of dog attacks, pit bulls doe the most damage. Period."

Hamilton,3cnwsf,lumpiestprincess,2,Thu Jul 9 13:32:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but miniature poodles can't kill people.  Large, powerful dogs who can be trained to be aggressive are dangerous in the hands of the wrong owner.  Unless we can figure out a way to ensure these dogs do not have ignorant, lazy, or malicious owners, we probably shouldn't allow them to be owned at all.   It is hard to say within context of this story, where currently there aren't really a lot of details - it could have been the owner themselves who died - but ultimately a dog capable of killing has no place in the city, IMO."
Hamilton,3cnwsf,GrumpyKitten1,2,Thu Jul 9 13:34:56 2015 UTC,A lab could kill someone. A golden retriever too. Huskies have killed before. Shepherds have. Many mutts obviously. Should none of those be allowed in the city too? Where do we draw a line?
Hamilton,3cnwsf,lumpiestprincess,3,Thu Jul 9 12:46:35 2015 UTC,"Where we draw a line is a good question - perhaps people who would like to own a large dog should be legally required to train the dog though a licensed trainer?  Or that a dog above a certain weight must wear a muzzle in public?  Whatever the answer to the question is, I think there should be a line.  The idea that we should be free to own a potentially dangerous animal in densely populated areas just doesn't make sense to me.  Public safety is more important.    I like dogs, but would never own one in the city unless I knew I could train and control the dog, otherwise I'd be putting everyone (including myself) in danger.  Unfortunately there are owners who don't see it this way, or just don't care."
Hamilton,3cnwsf,lumpiestprincess,3,Thu Jul 9 13:10:25 2015 UTC,"I've had and been training large dogs since I was a child. Should I need to pay someone to train my animals when I can do it myself? Should my well behaved dog be forced to wear a muzzle? Not telling you off, but pointing out the counter arguements already in place as to why we dont have such laws.  Cars kill people every day. All you need for that is a license. As long as you pass that test, you can be out on the streets doing whatever the hell you want until either you get caught or kill someone. Think of dogs the same way, and they kill and injure way fewer people.  A dog is supposed to be licensed. That's about all you can do."
Hamilton,3cnwsf,ExcelCat,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:24:39 2015 UTC,"I would support mandatory training if an experienced owner could pass a test to train their own pets, at least that way inexperienced owners would also get some training. Seeing dogs muzzled makes me sad, it looks so uncomfortable."

Nobody is debating the FACT that these animals are dangerous because of stupid owners; the problem is WHEN the owners are stupid, damages are that much more severe.   A chihuahua, no matter how bad its owner is, will NEVER be able to do the kind of damage that a pit bull can. And since there is no way to ""stop"" bad owners from training their dogs poorly, there seems to be little choice in how to safegaurd the community.  People need to understand this idea; many seem to think it's a ""war on pitbulls""... it's NOT. It's a war on dogs that can cause massive bodily harm if untrained. If bloodhounds were able to cause the type of damage that a pit bull could, then they would be lumped into the same category.   It's about reducing the number of loose cannons walking the street."

Have a close friend who adopted a pit bull and it was a big suck of a dog around humans.  Bring another dog near it and it lost its shit.

Everyone was surprised as it was a peaceful family pet, no one knew their 14yr old son had been running over his tail on his bike for fun giving the dog a serious hate of bicycles. Other than quarantine to make sure the dog was not rabid nothing was done, no one reported anything, it was pretty much a non incident. Bet it would have made the news if it was a rottweiler (at the time it was rottweilers and dobermans in the news) or a pit bull. Part of the problem is poor owners, part is sensational journalism vilifying specific breeds. Any dog can bite/do damage, large dogs more so but properly raised/trained/cared for the likelihood is so low. Since pet licensing is required how about some stipulations around it involving training it instead of just a cash grab. You have to pass a test to get a license to drive, why not to own a pet? I still get nervous when I see a large dog essentially walking their owner but absolutely adore my friend's cane corso (all 125lbs of him), even when he thinks he's a lap dog."

Sounds like it's someone the dog knew, which make it even weirder that the dog turned on him. What do you want to bet this guy treated the dog like shit and he finally snapped?  Also curious the link here says ""north Hamilton"" but the article says ""central""  tip: Burton street is not in the north end"
Hamilton,3cnwsf,cenatutu,0,Thu Jul 9 16:01:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks tips.   Tip:  I copied the headline directly from the article, which the Spec has since ammended.   So you're blaming the victim, which you have no information on."
Hamilton,3cnwsf,cenatutu,4,Fri Jul 10 01:51:41 2015 UTC,"I'm just surprised they changed the headline so dramatically. Doesn't suprise me that the spec said north Hamilton, though :)   Nah. I'm just saying it's quite likely the case. I've never seen a dog snap for no reason, especially on someone it knows.   But obviously it does happen (The police dog they mention in the article - I'd never heard that, curious what happened)"
Hamilton,3cnwsf,cenatutu,-1,Thu Jul 9 14:22:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm just grinding your gears.the Spec tends to do that as update their stories.   I think it happens often honestly. We tend to forget dogs are predatory animals. Sometimes their instincts take over."

Of course there's no contextual information on the bites that happen so it's hard to get a picture. That's a 1-2% bite ratio across the population - of course, it doesn't include numbers on how many owned a dog, relationship to the dog, etc."

Hamilton,3cnwsf,fartmasterzero,-3,Thu Jul 9 15:20:55 2015 UTC,"You're all absolutely right, we shouldn't ban pit-bulls or rottweilers as inner-city pets.  I have a much simpler plan:  We should just fucking ban dogs.  No more stepping in poop.  No more attacking kids.  No more idiots thinking they should take their dog on the bus or into the store.  No more barking in the middle of the night.  No more jumping on strangers ""oh he's just saying hi!"".  No more scaring children.  No more crap on my lawn.  No more houses destroyed by stressed out animals.  Doesn't it sound glorious?  We banned chickens for reasons like that, why not dogs?  Look, I get that you love your big furry beast, but don't expect me to have any particular feelings for your unstable predatory shit-machine."

Hamilton,3coetz,backwardsguitar,5,Thu Jul 9 15:25:02 2015 UTC,(Downtown) Hamilton is very urban with decent density which is what makes it so appealing to cyclists/urbanists.  The suburban parts of Hamilton generally do everything in their power to fuck up downtown's progress and culture so I can't imagine how tough it would be for Burlington which is even more overwhelmingly suburban.
Hamilton,3coetz,interr0bangr,3,Thu Jul 9 20:24:35 2015 UTC,This is the problem as a huge part of the Burlington population commutes to work farther than they could technically ride a bike ( on a daily basis).

Hmmm... I wonder if it kills your soul?  That said, generally good job on him though, if more people went out and did this, there would be less online luring. Although I really doubt that the HPS appreciates this type of vigilante justice- especially if it leads to an assault- they have a task force for this type of thing, you could easily just forward the chat logs to them and have them deal with the meeting of the suspect."
Hamilton,3co5ce,onesonesones,3,Thu Jul 9 12:53:02 2015 UTC,I really hope this guy does have the chat logs with full detail. Otherwise this is just some grab for likes and shares on Facebook.
Hamilton,3co5ce,hewantstobefamous,3,Thu Jul 9 13:11:53 2015 UTC,"He'll have the chat logs, he isn't dumb, but he is a complete idiot.   He probably doesn't know the very particular legal details that differentiate entrapment from criminal behaviour. So although he very likely exposed a potential risk pedophile on social media, when the police get the chat logs, it's very likely that in those conversations he unknowingly broke a few of the entrapment gotcha's regarding that, which means the risk predator won't be chargeable.    He could have easily turned over the chat logs to the police a week ago, faded his fake persona, and stepped out so that the police could set up a proper sting and arrest using a completely different 'alt'.    But instead, he couldn't just live with the satisfaction of doing the right thing, he had to make it about himself and Chris Hansen the guy on his facebook so he was front and center. He's now lapping up all the attention on facebook, adding girls, slapping himself on the back. The risk predator has probably already wisened up, changed his patterns, destroyed his hard drives, still out there, still a risk, not now, but later when everyone forgets."
Hamilton,3co5ce,kinokonoko,8,Fri Jul 10 00:30:57 2015 UTC,"I always hated 'To Catch a Predator' because it made part of me feel bad for the monsters that assault children.  I would then feel bad for feeling bad, and then have to remind myself that they were in fact monsters.  But something always felt wrong still.  Because it's not about feeling bad or not feeling bad for these monsters, it's about not succumbing to the mob mentality, shaming tactics, and vigilante ""justice"".  These monsters should face the wrath of real justice, not ""YouTube justice"".  This guy is looking for his 15 minutes and profiting in reputation and notoriety from these monsters and their behaviour.  The self-important introduction speaks volumes."
Hamilton,3co5ce,hewantstobefamous,10,Thu Jul 9 13:38:54 2015 UTC,"""Monsters"" is simplistic good vs evil kind of characterization that doesn't really address the issues of mental illness, the cycles of abuse and the sexualization of children in our culture. Anyone who wants to do this to a child is clearly not mentally well. When the intended victim is a teen, well there are some social and legal issues, and the perpetrator might need some correction via the legal system and counseling, but the punishment should not involve vigilante violence."
Hamilton,3co5ce,kinokonoko,-6,Thu Jul 9 14:23:10 2015 UTC,"I'm all for addressing the underlying issues that cause people to become monsters.  But having underlying issues don't make a person who abuses children any less of a monster, and identifying them as monsters doesn't somehow inhibit us from also addressing underlying issues in others to prevent them from becoming monsters in the future."
Hamilton,3co5ce,vroom_Vroom_boom,2,Thu Jul 9 14:27:30 2015 UTC,"You don't find labeling a human being after a creature class in children's literature dehumanizing and simplistic? Heroes kill monsters. Vigilantes want to be heroes. A great spiritual teacher from India, Krishnacharya used to state that he was not one iota lesser than the Buddha himself, nor one iota more important than the worst criminal. Its a high stance to take, I know, but ultimately only compassion, mercy and attention will lessen the spread of child sexual abuse and violence in general."

It seemed like they all use the same material, shingles and water proofing. Sounds like everyone uses a 50 year shingle now. I'll let you know when I get home how the roof looks, but I expect it to be great. Send me a PM if you want the phone number for the salesman that dealt with me.

We also wanted to get aluminum put around the brick sections of the roof and for whatever reason the team that did it the first day did a crap job on it. The guy in charge came over in the eve to check the work and see how we feel. I brought up the aluminum, and he said he already has it logged and will be brining by somebody else to fix it the next day. And he did and it was.  I tried the lesser known, possibly cheaper options but they just didn't seem to want to do anything. So I figured a bigger name company was in order.

Hamilton,3cjjzc,RedMageTaru_Work,2,Wed Jul 8 12:44:49 2015 UTC,"Have a friend in downtown with a similar home, over 100 years old. Stuff you need to do:  1) Fix your downspouts and make sure they're not dumping water anywhere near your foundation 2) Clean up any debris that might be holding water in beside the foundation 3) His solution (worked well) was to get this paint that can hold water back inside the walls so it doesn't seep into your basement. You need to have exposed walls to do this obviously: http://www.homedepot.com/p/BEHR-Premium-5-gal-Basement-and-Masonry-Waterproofing-Paint-87505/100558274  4) Expensive or time consuming, or both, but if you can do it and have access, dig down and put new weeping tile in. Weeping tile is good for about 25 years (if your house even has it, maybe not)."

Hamilton,3chxx8,My_Public_Profile,6,Wed Jul 8 01:23:02 2015 UTC,"Had a terrible experience with them. Had the main floor of a duplex. Second tenant moved in the basement at the beginning of summer. Near the end of summer they complained that the hydro (which was included) was too high, and said if I didn't lower it they would evict me.  I pointed out that that was ridiculous, and the increased costs coincided with the second tenant arriving. They sent a maintenance man to disconnect the central air conditioning unit outside. Yes, really.  On move in we were promised new appliances. None were new. It took two weeks for them to get their maintenance guy in to hook up the dishwasher, and over a month to install a refurbished washer and dryer.  I called Jeff Varcoe and his assistant (Sue?) every day and left messages on both of their voicemails for eleven straight days. They did not answer. I sent an email asking for rent abatement due to not having promised appliances for a month and Jeff called me less than five minutes later.  We agreed to vacate the unit on Dec 31st, a month before the end of our lease. On christmas eve, while we were out of town visiting family, the maintenance man called to see if we could give him access to the house so he could change the locks without drilling them out. I asked him what in the world he was doing, and he was confused. Had no idea we still lived there. Called the office and told them changing our locks was illegal. They said the tenant downstairs said we moved out. We had not. Asked them why they didn't call us or email us to confirm, did not look in the window to see our furniture, just tried to lock us out. She had no answer. Told her if they changed the locks I was calling the police. She agreed not to.  Also, they do not answer phones during the weekend at all. Early in the summer the air conditioner broke on a thursday. We confirmed it on Friday, but they didn't answer my calls. On saturday we hooked up a window unit, but it blew the main breaker. (We couldn't use a blow dryer in the bathroom or it would blow the breaker every time. The girls dried their hair in the kitchen.) The circuit breaker box was in the basement. The basement tenant was out of town. The house had no air and no power at all for three days. We took a hotel and didn't hear back until Monday. They refused to cover the hotel.  The fact that when we came to sign the lease and get the keys Jeff Varcoe was two and a half hours late should have been the first red flag. Cornerstone does not care for their tenants whatsoever. They break the law to make the landlords happy.  Believe it or not, there's more. But this seems long enough already.  TL;DR Run."
Hamilton,3chxx8,_waxmonkey,3,Wed Jul 8 15:34:52 2015 UTC,"I have time, could ya let us in on more details?"
Hamilton,3chxx8,Thelastlucifer,3,Wed Jul 8 16:07:07 2015 UTC,"Jeff tried to pull a surprise inspection on us after arguing about the hydro for a month. My daughter randomly checked the mail on a Sunday night and found an unmailed letter that had been dropped off sometime that day from Cornerstone. It said it was giving us 24 hours notice of an inspection on Tuesday morning. Monday was a holiday, so no mail. Of course, none on Sunday either. Had she not checked the mail, we would have been surprised Tuesday morning when he showed up. Since they didn't call to inform us or knock on the door when they dropped off the letter, I suspect a surprise was what they were looking for.  When he came on Tuesday, he said it was to check the thermostat. After checking it, he said he needed to search the rest of the house for water damage. I asked why he thinks there might be water damage. He replied that he didn't - but it was his policy to check. He then went through the house room by room, even going into bedroom closets and searching through our belongings. My wife was irate as she felt this was a serious violation of her privacy. Once he started going through our clothes in the closet I told him this was unreasonable and wanted him to leave. He didn't. Said he had every right to a thorough inspection of the property. He was right, so I didn't fight him on it, but it was extremely uncomfortable.  The second week of January my wife stopped by the property to check the mailbox for mail for us. She noticed new furniture in the livingroom that you could see through the front window next to the front door. She knocked on the door and found the house had already been rented and moved into by new tenants. They said they had no mail for us.  Fast forward to almost a year later and we get a call from a collection agency saying we owe Cornerstone three months of rent, plus fees. They are attempting to charge us for January's rent, even though we had mutually agreed we would move out by the first (actually Dec 31st). Additionally, they're trying to charge us for another 60 days rent on top of that for ""not giving notice"" before moving out.  Obviously they had lots of notice, and even if they didn't they can't charge rent to a tenant that vacated while also receiving rent from new tenants for the same months.  We are still arguing with the collection company over this.  To summarize, Cornerstone Select Properties/Jeff Varcoe:  Does not fulfill the terms of the lease (missing appliances/different than promised appliances)  Does not answer calls or voicemails without threats of non-payment  Does not answer phones or work on weekends  Does not reimburse for hotels or laundromats  Does not respect tenants time (ridiculously late for meetings)  Does disconnect appliances that are required on the lease (A/C)  Does make ridiculous threats (use less power this month or we'll evict you on the first of next month)  Does attempt to collect unowed money  Is willing to break the law (change locks)  And last, but also least, we never even got the welcome gift basket that's promised in every advertisement they post and on their website. Not a big deal at all, but shows who you're dealing with."

Hamilton,3chxx8,Cornerstone_Select,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:06:35 2015 UTC,"Hello Cory (aka “_waxmonkey”) and Melissa (aka “Amerinuk”) -- Nice to hear from you again!  Wow, I must say that I’m surprised! Not so much by the fact that you’d write such slanderous nonsense but that it took the collection agency 2-½ years to finally catch up to you for the damages and unpaid rent you left behind.  Doesn’t seem like that long, does it? But in fact it was back in January 2013 when your eviction notice was enforced by the Sheriff. You can check it out for yourself:  LTB Website: http://www.ltb.gov.on.ca/en/Online/STEL02_111328.html File Number: SOL-32660-12 Postal Code: L8E 1C4  I applaud you in your efforts and that you took the time to coordinate with friends and family to “gang up” in support of your opinion. In the absence of accurate information you almost make a believable case that we presented you with a bad experience.   While I’m the first to admit that we are never perfect I do feel it best to respond with some actual facts:    Your hydro consumption was TRIPLE the average usage. You claim: “Does not fulfill the terms of the lease (missing appliances/different than promised appliances)” -- You were never promised new appliances and you hardly have anything to complain about considering that you received gentle used, mid-line stainless steel appliances. I can send you a picture if you've forgotten what they looked like? You claim: “Does attempt to collect unowed money and Is willing to break the law (change locks while you were out of town)” -- You had an outstanding eviction order from the LTB ordering you to pay 3-months in rent or to vacate. When you suddenly leave the property for an extended period (without notifying us) I’m just supposed to assume you went on vacation? How could you afford to go on vacation when you still owed 3-months in rent?? You claim: “Does not answer phones or work on weekends and Does not reimburse for hotels or laundromats”: You plugged in a window a/c unit (which, as per your lease, you are not supposed to do without written authorization) and blew a breaker. Your call came in at 11:30 pm on a Saturday night, ONE circuit was without power, the rest of the house was fine and since you didn’t hear back within 1-hour you decided to take the family to a hotel at Cornerstone’s expense? Nice try.  You claim: “we never even got the welcome gift basket”... that was 3.5 years so my memory of the gift basket has faded somewhat. If you truly never received your welcome basket then I do apologize for that oversight. And, despite the lack of love you show for me in this thread I will still give you the benefit of doubt and will happily give you the $50 welcome basket in exchange for payment of +$4,400 you owe us for unpaid rent and removal of the junk you left behind. Sound fair? You claim: “Jeff tried to pull a surprise inspection on us after arguing about the hydro for a month.” -- I’ll revert back to the fact that your hydro bills (that we paid) were 3x the average and you were also elusive about giving anyone access to your apartment. Sounded like something funny was going on in your place and it’s my job to make sure the property, it’s occupants and the neighbours are not being exposed to any illegal activity. Hence, the purpose of my inspection and persistence to see all rooms and closets to ensure there was not an illegal hydroponics/“grow-op” underway.   So despite your name calling and false claims, if you’d like to clear up the outstanding rent we can call off the collections agency and I can get you that welcome basket."

I answered a question based on my own experiences with you, as I assume they did. If you'd glance at their comment history, you'd see Amerinuk appears to be a man.   My increased hydro consumption coincided precisely with the other tenant moving in during the summer months. Second tenant + summer months = more hydro. I was promised new appliances in the kijiji advertisement for the house. ""ALL NEW STAINLESS STEEL"". We received a used white refrigerator, a used stainless steel dishwasher (which took two weeks for you to have hooked up), and a refurbished white washer and dryer that had to be repaired immediately after delivery (which took over a month). I did not have an outstanding order for three months rent. That's simply a lie. A sheriff never evicted me. That is also a lie. The fact that my family spent three days with my wife's parents over Christmas really isn't any of your business. You had my phone number. You had my email address. You had my wife's phone number and email address. You could have attempted to contact us. You could have come to the house and seen our belongings through the window. You instead attempted to break the law. My lease stated I was not to ""install an air conditioner"". I plugged in a mobile unit (not a window unit) when the house was 30 degrees. It tripped the breaker for the entire house. There were obviously power problems in the house, as the blow dryer blew the circuit every time we used it in the bathroom. You did not answer friday or saturday. No A/C, no power, no answer, miserable kids in the house means we take a hotel for a night. No one cares about the gift basket. It just another in the long line of reality being different from what you present in your ads. 4400 is an amount you made up for the collection company. You do not have a judgement for that. You have a judgement for 1/4th of that amount misrepresenting our tenancy to January 7th, when we left at the end of December. The only reason you have it is because we did not show up to contest it - because we never received a notice of hearing. What we had was a verbal agreement with you that we'd move out at the end of December, which we did. So it was supposed to be a surprise inspection, and you admit to creepily violating our privacy? As far as ""elusive"" - you never asked. The letter you dropped off by hand was the first.   To the rest:   I don't believe I ever called you a name. ""Douche"" was done by a different Hamilton redditor. I did, however, explain in detail your behavior and what one could expect renting from you. I made no false claims. You illegally disconnected my A/C. You illegally tried to change the locks on the house while I still had an active lease.  Remember Jeff, it's only slander if it's false."
Hamilton,3chd2c,findingtheplaceforme,2,Tue Jul 7 22:35:08 2015 UTC,How much are you willing to spend in a month on rent?  Are you looking for a bachelor or a 1-bedroom?
Hamilton,3chd2c,TesticalSue,2,Wed Jul 8 01:41:11 2015 UTC,"I'd say up to $1200 at most.  I'd ideally like a 1-bedroom, although it's more important for me to have certain things like parking, and for the place to be in the James Street North area (or somewhere like that), have a washer and dryer, and hardwood flooring...so if it turned out to be a studio, then that would be okay if it was reasonably priced..."
Hamilton,3chd2c,jmgk,6,Wed Jul 8 01:48:13 2015 UTC,"Just going to throw it out there that the figure of $1200 is literally half a months pay for you. You should probably be looking at no more than $1000 and if it were me, I wouldn't go any higher than $800. Just better if you want to save money for the future.  Anyway, with that really lengthy list of demands and that price range you're likely going to be looking for an apartment that is located closer to King or Barton and north in order to be close to James St. N. What you consider close to James St. N.?  My recommendation would be to look to rent in Corktown or Durand and really consider if you can live with a communal washer and dryer in the complex and forget about the hardwood (granted you can still very well find those if you can be patient and move into a Duplex/Triplex)."

If you're not looking to spend $10-15k on spray expansion insulation done by a professional (best energy efficiency possible) then your next best bet is hit up Rona and DIY. The product you want is Roxul Safe and Sound. Measure the width between your joists, and then buy it in that size (either 24 or 16"", old houses are usually 24""). Get yourself some good gloves and the high end paint suits so you don't get it on your skin, and then just place it in your joist cavities. That sprayed in pink shit is garbage. Roxul is the next best thing to spray foam, but will cost you significantly less."

Plus it's just way easier to get around in your attic with batts instead of fluff everywhere.  Closed Cell Spray Foam (the high end shit) is like 34R. As mentioned above, you gotta vent your roof right when you do this. Going from no insulation to insulated, expect to put 2-3 vents on your roof depending on size."
Hamilton,3cgsrq,DrGrinch,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:49:20 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/DrGrinch, it depends on your budget.  Probably the cheapest way to do it would be to DIY.

While I understand that gentrification isn't perfect, the positives overwhelming outweigh the negatives. The increase in property tax revenue will help the city build and provide access to better community resources (eg. public transit).  On a different note, I liked the article, but did anyone else have trouble reading with that font?"
Hamilton,3ccn0q,cwalk,3,Tue Jul 7 04:54:44 2015 UTC,"All government policies create positives and negatives, with some groups winning and other groups losing.  The positives of gentrification outweigh the negatives for which group of people?  At the expense of which other group of people?  These are the questions we need to ask.  Saying that the positives outweigh the negatives as a blanket statement is a convenient way to skirt over the real problem: that a big group of people in the city is losing as a result of gentrification."
Hamilton,3ccn0q,pushouttathecity,2,Tue Jul 7 12:12:46 2015 UTC,"What has been great for the last 20 years in the city though, I was born there and I left as did virtually everyone I knew that got an education it's only now people like us are looking at Hamilton again.  I invested in a property ther and on this board people called me evil - never understood why.  The person who moved here is a professional from Montreal in the science field.  That's what you want in a city, people willing to move and invest. Do you want next generation of kids to stay because there is opportunity or leave because they can make more money in their area of study elsewhere because that is what will continue to happen.   Yes Rents will rise, but so will job opportunities, so will new business' the reason Toronto is so expensive is because there is so much opportunity.  The reason Hamilton is so cheap is lack there of.    There will be people hurt by of coarse, but do you stop everything because some people won't be able to keep up?  I mean this city has how many who haven't been able to keep up for 20 years when frankly it was a dump."
Hamilton,3ccn0q,SwarezSauga,3,Tue Jul 7 15:27:18 2015 UTC,"I invested in a property ther and on this board people called me evil - never understood why   Hamilton has a big problem with absentee land-lords ""investing"" by buying up a property and then pretty much letting it rot into its foundation while they wait for the market to pull up its value in spite of their sloth.  Imagine living next to that and you'll see why we're a little itchy about ""investors""."

Hamilton,3ccn0q,pushouttathecity,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:40:37 2015 UTC,"That's impossible.  Any development will hurt some group.  Just as lack of development will hurt some group.  if you are growing the city which is finally starting to happen, there should be more money to help people who genuinely need help and more opportunity for people who have been struggling for what ever reason.  What do you actually suggest to be done to stop hurting ""certain groups"" and how should it be paid for."
Hamilton,3ccn0q,SwarezSauga,2,Tue Jul 7 16:24:51 2015 UTC,"To help the working poor downtown, use a large portion of the money from increasing housing values and taxes to develop dense affordable housing units close to downtown.   To help young people looking to own homes and start families, open up much more space for development of townhouse and single detached housing in our suburbs in order to match the market demand.  An increased supply lowers prices.  This is economics 101.  Continue to develop more or less low density housing until the demand has been met and middle-class families can afford a home."
Hamilton,3ccn0q,pushouttathecity,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:40:26 2015 UTC,"So essentially you want suburban sprawl like Milton and Missisauga ?  I live in Missisauga full Time now, a decent house now costs 800k in good school areas after 5 years same thing will happen Hamilton what about the next generation of young families that can't afford?  No more land.  Look at Milton, 400,000 singles now go in the 6-7 range in 5 years.  This city frankly is cheap - compared to the rest of the GTA by a pretty large margin.  I don't know if you make subsided houses for the working poor especially with so many frankly not working in this city or taking government money and working for cash (I know a few who do this during their rough times) - I just think you have to push more opportunity in this city.  The airport is a bust, get a plan to get some carrier here car more jobs around there.  Get some of the office space rented downtown so these people who Work but don't make much can make more."
Hamilton,3ccn0q,SwarezSauga,0,Tue Jul 7 21:21:20 2015 UTC,"We have almost unlimited landmass available in Hamilton for developing detached and townhouse housing.  Toronto and Mississauga no longer do, and so  they'll have to start building up.  They are in a different position than Hamilton entirely.  If Toronto wants to make housing affordable, they need to force condo builders to create 3-4 bedroom units by mandating that they make up X% of the building.  Developers will sell 100% 1 bedroom if they can get away with it, so you need a law that forces them to build the less profitable but still profitable family units.  If urbanists disagree, why aren't they buying condo units?  Why are they buying up detached housing?  What's your solution?"
Hamilton,3ccn0q,pushouttathecity,0,Tue Jul 7 22:12:52 2015 UTC,"Of course it's a blanket statement, it's the equivalent of the tl;dr. Let me be more direct about then, it will greatly benefit anyone even remotely invested in our amazing city by increasing property values and generating new tax revenue. Those who will benefit the least will be those who have invested the least. Property is an investment just like any other, a zero return (ie. no rise in property value) is a bad investment. I'm curious, what percentage of home and business owners in Hamilton would you consider to be the ""big group of people"" (make up a rough estimate)?"
Hamilton,3ccn0q,cwalk,2,Tue Jul 7 12:57:25 2015 UTC,"Wow.  Just wow.  I said big group of people.  This may come as a surprise to you, but individuals who don't own homes and don't own businesses are people too.  They're those bipedal mammals that serve you your coffee...  The 30% of households that rent are in trouble.  Children under 18 being raised in Hamilton who have no control over policies, no ability to realistically begin saving, who will soon be competing with  buyers from Toronto, are in trouble too.  Even young 20 and 30-something families looking to get into the market are now being priced out.    These are some pretty big groups of people.  Not recognizing them as people doesn't make it so..."
Hamilton,3ccn0q,pushouttathecity,2,Tue Jul 7 13:08:25 2015 UTC,"Please, let's keep this civil. I never said anything about non-property owners not being people. You are constructing a straw man argument and are putting words in my mouth. Whether we like it or not, the reality is that property values across Canada are on the rise and Hamilton is no exception."
Hamilton,3ccn0q,cwalk,0,Tue Jul 7 13:34:58 2015 UTC,"The logical result of deductive reasoning is not a straw man argument.    Whether we like it or not, property values are determined by government policy and market forces.   We can't control market forces and preferences, but we can control government policies."
Hamilton,3ccn0q,pushouttathecity,6,Tue Jul 7 13:42:47 2015 UTC,Why not examine the core of the argument against gentrification: certain locals suffer and are phased out of their communities.   You hand wave all arguments against gentrification with your conclusion and your critique of what I'd say is low hanging fruit does little to answer the questions of gentrification.   There are arguments against gentrification from experts in urban studies that apply to Hamilton. Challenging those ideas will do better to quell the fear of gentrification.

Hamilton is rapidly shutting out young/middle class families who want to buy for the first time, or upgrade. The ""gentrification"" (hey, why don't we call it what it is, the massive influx of wealthy Torontonians) are a godsend for the developers, realtors, and city politicians. For everyone else they are, at best, a nuisance. They raise prices on pretty much everything. This is great for those who can afford to keep up, not so much for those who have trouble dealing with rising prices.  The anarchist chap sounds like a looney tune, no doubt. But he's a symptom of what is happening not only around James St N, but in a large segment of the old city centre. People are being pushed out...why do you act surprised that they won't go quietly?"

With average detached houses costing upwards of 800,000 in a relatively central part of Toronto, these are just lower middle class folks moving to Hamilton. Its economic migration, plain and simple.   As a young, lower middle class person, who moved to Hamilton to live the Candian dream (whatever the fuck that means), I haven't really seen many rich people downtown... Maybe up on the side of the mountain, but there are no rich folk on James St. N - guaranteed. I haven't had a landrover almost run me over since I moved here - so I notice rich people ;)   I completely empathize with getting shoved out. It's happened to me and to my friends several times in Toronto, in London Ontario - even in London England. But when faced with the option of collecting $2000 in rent each month from your multiple tennents, and taking a $500,000 pay day - I think we can empathize with the person who sells.

Hamilton,3cbgok,1slinkydink1,3,Mon Jul 6 16:52:59 2015 UTC,Not since last week but you really can't compare anything from before last Monday since the HOV lanes went online.
Hamilton,3cbgok,1slinkydink1,2,Mon Jul 6 16:56:08 2015 UTC,I took the go bus from Hamilton to union all last week and it was so fast i'm just not sure if going home would be the same story.
Hamilton,3cbgok,Crilde,2,Mon Jul 6 16:56:48 2015 UTC,"There is really no reason to believe that it wouldn't be. If you end up doing it, you should report back.  Encourage everyone to take transit where possible while these HOV lanes are in place so that we get more positive messaging around the implementation of the lanes."
Hamilton,3cbgok,ButtonsTheMonkey,3,Mon Jul 6 17:02:31 2015 UTC,"Its pretty damn good, not gonna lie. I take it every day and I've noticed a bit of a reduction in my morning commute time. As I write this we're blowing past a traffic jam."
Hamilton,3cbgok,echowon,2,Mon Jul 6 20:51:38 2015 UTC,"Interested in hearing if you do try this out. I'd try it out today, but I biked to Aldershot today so should probably get back there today after work to take my bike home."
Hamilton,3cbgok,TheJmoney,2,Mon Jul 6 17:50:29 2015 UTC,"i commute to toronto daily, and have used the HOV lane 4 times so far since the 3+ people.  you may hit the normal rush hour traffic getting into the HOV lanes, but you will be there faster than you stated. pending accidents,"
Hamilton,3cbgok,timmeh87,2,Mon Jul 6 17:55:44 2015 UTC,I took the Express GO from Hunter Station to Union last Friday. It took 55 minutes. HOV is great but odds are (especially during peak time) you're going to hit a snag on the Gardiner/Lakeshore or when the QEW splits into the 403.
Hamilton,3cbgok,ButtonsTheMonkey,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:45:01 2015 UTC,The 5:05 bus arrives at 6:50?? I've never had that bus take longer than 50 minutes during off peak times. Is that a typo?
Hamilton,3cbgok,noel_105,5,Mon Jul 6 17:21:43 2015 UTC,"5pm is pretty on peak, and it usually takes a good chunk of time. It tends to go north a bit to avoid some of the QEW gong showiness. Around the Toronto-Mississauga area."
Hamilton,3cbgok,Doomaise,3,Mon Jul 6 17:46:33 2015 UTC,"If I'm travelling during rush hour, I'll take the train, it's definitely faster. During off peak hours, the bus is much faster."
Hamilton,3cbgok,timmeh87,2,Mon Jul 6 18:21:15 2015 UTC,Think the OP meant 17:05 bus arrives at 18:50....
Hamilton,3cbgok,ButtonsTheMonkey,2,Mon Jul 6 20:03:03 2015 UTC,"That still implies the average speed is 60 the whole way there, for almost a two hour period of time. which just seems kind of slow to me. Even in ultra-rush-hour Ive been able to drive from Ancaster to North York in that time."
Hamilton,3cbgok,ButtonsTheMonkey,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:32:11 2015 UTC,"Just took it this morning the 7:05 and blasted thru traffic, there was a snag as some dummies rear ended themselves, but it must have just happened a few seconds before we got to the area cause we didn't have to wait much to get past them and keep going thru. Then there was some snag at Front St, something about protesters so the bus driver just pulled to the side of Bay and let us out there. So was out a sliver past 8. That's some good time. Thinking of trying the one after work to see what it's like on the way back."
Hamilton,3catmp,Schmidtzy,13,Mon Jul 6 13:35:09 2015 UTC,GO buses across the GTHA are actually operating so well that the buses have to slow down because they're having trouble maintaining their schedules. HOV lanes are a huge boon for public transit.
Hamilton,3catmp,1slinkydink1,8,Mon Jul 6 13:41:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as much as folks in Mississauga would hate it, I'd love to see the HOV lanes stay after the games are over (but returned to a sane 2-occupant minimum instead of the current crazy 3).  It's refreshing to see Hamilton finally properly connected to the city that's ostensibly only 40 minutes away."
Hamilton,3catmp,Voltrondemort,4,Mon Jul 6 17:19:37 2015 UTC,From July 27th to August 18th the lanes will convert to 2+ so that will be more of a test run of what the network could potentially look like one day.
Hamilton,3catmp,1slinkydink1,3,Mon Jul 6 17:27:16 2015 UTC,God I hope they keep them. This might be the PanAm legacy people would be happy to keep.

Hamilton,3catmp,thesilentalarm,5,Mon Jul 6 13:46:59 2015 UTC,I have tickets to see the Gold Medal Men's soccer game at Tim Horton's Field. I know a few people who are going to catch some games.

Hamilton,3catmp,mattgrande,3,Mon Jul 6 23:03:15 2015 UTC,"I'm going to rugby in Toronto, and a handful of soccer games in Hamilton.  There's a bunch of free concerts that I'm looking forward to as well.  Edit: I'm also hoping to see some wheelchair rugby, too!"
Hamilton,3catmp,theninjasquad,3,Mon Jul 6 15:53:40 2015 UTC,I've got tickets to see three days worth of soccer matches here in the city. Might go another day or two potentially since tickets are very reasonably priced. Pretty excited for all the soccer action in the city!
Hamilton,3catmp,Dearness,2,Mon Jul 6 16:03:42 2015 UTC,"Yep, looking forward to seeing diving, synchronized swimming and soccer.  I figure they aren't sports I'd normally get a chance to see live so why not.  The fact that transportation is included in the cost of the ticket is fantastic and we'll be taking public transit to all the events."
Hamilton,3catmp,themaincop,2,Mon Jul 6 18:03:51 2015 UTC,I've got tickets to two of the soccer games and might pick up more if they're available.
Hamilton,3catmp,Chevellephreak,2,Mon Jul 6 20:42:53 2015 UTC,"My boyfriend and I are going to the men's gold medal soccer game here in Hamilton.  I would also like to get tickets to the parapan rugby games, as I have a friend who is on the team."

Hamilton,3cav7z,hamiltonkb,3,Mon Jul 6 13:50:07 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: the people running it are my friends.  But freelance work is exploding for knowledge economy jobs (web design, graphic design, branding/sales, writing, etc.), and this project opens up downtown for these workers who can't rent a giant office in the Stelco or CIBC towers, but still want a cool place to work downtown."

Hamilton,3c8jn0,Shart_Gremlin,9,Sun Jul 5 23:14:41 2015 UTC,"Its absolutely insane how many people use scooters and walking carts in this city. I wondered if there was a massive giveaway prior to my moving here or something. I was on the bus the other day and they had to deny entry to a lady with a walking cart because there was already so many carts on board there was no room left for any more, the bus was about 40% full with people if that."
Hamilton,3c8jn0,X-Kid86,3,Mon Jul 6 00:42:36 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it's related to company benefits at the big industrial companies allowing people to get them for almost free (as someone who is familiar with insurance plans).

Hamilton,3c8jn0,xzElmozx,10,Sun Jul 5 23:30:18 2015 UTC,"Hmm, nice question!  It'd be fun to come back to this in 5 years.  For starters, we're definitely winning 5 more Grey Cups (did you see the cats give Winnipeg a shellacking earlier this week?  Believe it...) .  We'll be having 5 more increasingly large Super Crawls (in fact, the event itself will have to be renamed the Super Duper Crawl by 2020).  We'll have more and better places to eat.  We'll have more entertainment options.  Private sector industry will continue to diversify into more knowledge economy jobs (tech ftw).  New downtown condos will alter the skyline.  Businesses will relocate to Hamilton to take advantage of the growing pool of human capital.  People still won't be happy with the pace of change, but the change will continue, and the pace of change will continue to slowly increase."
Hamilton,3c8jn0,hamiltonkb,6,Mon Jul 6 00:56:37 2015 UTC,"5 years isn't long so about the same. Making a slow push to becoming more of a white collar city, lots of outside investment lately. We're starting to get a bit suburbish and better transit may make that a little more pronounced.   May fix a road or two, but probably not."

My  optimistic outlook is that I think the city will start to attract more and more younger people, especially people in tech (startups etc). Toronto has become completely unaffordable and people need to live somewhere.   Why tech? Because it's common with younger people, and because it doesn't require you to be in close proximity to much else."
Hamilton,3c8jn0,MattRix,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:05:13 2015 UTC,It's half the reason I'm here. I hope the tech sect grows. There's a profound war on intelligence in the city but hopefully it will dissipate as a new generation proliferates.

Same goes for Detour in Dundas.  My favourite is probably Russell Williams in Burlington - not far outside of Hamilton, a pretty traditional breakfast menu, it's amazing old diner atmosphere, great food and lots of it, you'll leave very full.  Runners up: Jack & Lois for delicious greasy diner food, jet cafe and good life deli for simple, quick, affordable breakfast, Gallagher's if you're into eggs Benedict - they have a whole Benny menu (or at least they did when I went last summer) and  it's adelicious.

The best place as mentioned in the thread is Papa Leo's.  Even though it is a chain, my favourite place is Sunset Grill (I go to the Barton/Ottawa Center Mall one). Nothing stand-out, but its reliably solid, good fast service.  Other local places I'll frequent, with their own benefits and drawbacks, are Steve's Open Kitchen, Jet Cafe and the Green Deli.  Common ones I see mentioned that I wouldn't recommend are Harbour Diner, Bedrock Bistro and Radius. Another one to avoid is the Maple Leaf Pancake House near McMaster.

One Duke also has a delicious breakfast/brunch going on, too. If you've never been there before at all, you should also go for drinks and dinner some time - the bartender is great and the food is awesome (burgers, in particular)  Either way, enjoy wherever you end up..weekend breakfast is the best breakfast :)"

Others have mentioned Aberdeen Tavern, and I will admit it really is a delicious brunch but I find it a bit overpriced for breakfast to be honest and the service was pretty slow, but that could also be because they were fairly new to the scene when I went there..I'm sure they've worked  everything out now.

For the same price at the grocery store you can make ten of those sandwiches.  It is a total ripoff.  Considering how expensive it is you would think he wouldn't have to constantly resort to e-begging to keep it up and running: http://m.thespec.com/news-story/5610448-gorilla-cheese-is-taking-a-grilling  And don't act like Mac hasn't dealt with local businesses in the past, they probably deal with local businesses more than any other institution in the city, and have had a longstanding relationship with Willy Dog, a far better run company that delivers a good product at a reasonable price. Much better than just squatting at festivals and overcharging as most of the other food trucks seem to.  Also Tim Horton's is basically cancer these days."

The supposed benefits like the go station don't benefit the people who lived here ten years ago. They displace those people and replace them with others who wouldn't live here without those so-called benefits."
Hamilton,3bwxzc,anony1235,4,Fri Jul 3 20:18:56 2015 UTC,"Economics is cruel. I can agree with that. Nature is also cruel. It truly has no compassion. But at the very least, economics is driven by humans - so it can have some humanity.   Hamilton is going cheap, compared to cities closer to Toronto. The closure of a lot of the industry that made Hamilton look like Mordor to anyone driving over the Burlington skyway also makes it more appealing to a lot of people. That attracts a creative class. It's just what happens. Artists need a place to make art and do economically risky things - like art. It happened in Toronto's posh Yorkville in the 60's, along with San Francisco and Grenwich Village in New York. Artists move in and make the area cool. Once it's cool, more people start coming and demand rises, raising property values. It also brings more stable businesses and a healthier economy.   But it does certainly push out those who are looking to rent at affordable prices. In the street I just moved to, I saw a house filled with people all get evicted and their stuff out on the street. Now the house is being renovated. Pretty sad deal for the people who had to leave. Payday for the person who bought the house.   So what could be done about all this? Are you going to stop an economic reality with posters and complaining? Not a snowball's chance in hell really. They'll drive you out like a hippie being crushed by a Prada store. But there is most certainly time to propose some real options. To get political and get some real city planning going on. The include affordable housing in the plan. To make sure that lower income people - including the artist class - can afford to live in this city. To make sure the economy is diverse and healthy.   The North End is a great example of this, and I think it could be reasonably done all over. Sure those really fancy houses that have been converted into rooming houses are gonna get renovated. They're gorgeous. There's no way around that unless a coop buys them. But maybe that's a solution?   So I guess this is all to say that there certainly time to build a more inclusive city. All those lots that say Condos Coming aren't going to break ground until the Royal Cannaught and the old CRA building starts getting full. No one would take that risk. So why not put pressure on to create more options for all Hamiltonians? This is a pretty socialist kind of place - I'm sure you could get traction.  But to stand around screaming about condos being built and the death of the city isn't earning you any respect. No one likes grown ups who complain, and you're not gonna stop the economy from existing. So make a realistic solution. There are some out there."
Hamilton,3bwxzc,beeteeoh,2,Sat Jul 4 04:36:14 2015 UTC,"Trying to make economics sound like it's some natural force... pretty weak. These processes are not 'just what happens' -- they have definite causes and are driven by specific people. It is also quite a new process and represents an economic reality that a small group of people have imposed on others over the last forty years.   Can you tell the difference between complaining and organizing, you horrible yuppy? The purpose of a poster like this is to force some conversations, to drive a wedge between the developers and their base of support in the so-called 'creative class'. Does it takes someone glueing something to your window to realize their is a fight going on? This is neither the beginning nor the end.  The creative class is composed of profiteers and suckers -- the suckers don't realize that class is about production and profit, not culture. If more of the people who are being duped into thinking development downtown is for them realize that they are getting played, we can get a better outcome for everyone."

Profit will always win at the game of capitalism (the one we're all playing, like it or not) Humanizing that development is certainly possible. But if you think for a moment that you can stop it, you are probably taking some bad acid.   Maybe you could start a Klan chapter up here or something. You sounds like you might be a great Wizard."

The guy from Baldasaro was very good, told us everything we needed to know, they did their bit very quickly. Had to wait over 8 weeks for the city to do their tho... funny enough they're at it right now. So we had to get in touch with the contractor to let them know the city is working on their part and they said they'll be sending somebody over this afternoon to complete the 2nd part of the part that's on our property, and then... full water pressure!! and no led on our part...

Hamilton,3bsu3v,havinahawkattack,6,Wed Jul 1 21:31:18 2015 UTC,"Bus or train is your best bet to Toronto, I think it's $20 round trip. Any bar or restaurant on Augusta St downtown is great for anything from afternoon patio beers to nights out with friends. Good food and lots of craft beer.  Casbah, Club Absinthe, Doors Pub, and This Ain't Hollywood are you go to music venues for live music in the Indie/punk/rock/metal scene.  Lots of opportunities for hiking along the escarpment if you're into that. Some cool stuff in the west end too, and there's bike trails ALL over.  If you're into football check out a TiCats game or the PanAm Games soccer if they're still going on.  Smokes Poutine on Hess St is probably your best bet for poutine and if you're into the younger club/bar crowd Hess St is the place to be."
Hamilton,3bsu3v,ssv-serenity,3,Wed Jul 1 23:00:54 2015 UTC,Must check out the waterfront---start at the end of James ==go to either Williams Coffee house or Sarcosa (liquor is quicker) and then walk or bike west from there staying on the water---lots to see and very relaxing
Hamilton,3bsu3v,bruysky,3,Thu Jul 2 02:09:23 2015 UTC,"If you're into waterfalls we have an abundance, Lot's of local music and art too. Great people most of the time."
Hamilton,3bsu3v,iNerdRage,2,Thu Jul 2 02:11:56 2015 UTC,Thanks for the recommendations thus far! I'm actually heading there for the Pan AM Games so I'll definitely be seeing some soccer. I might have to check out some Canadian Football while I'm at it. As for the bar scene I do prefer dive bars over super loud and crowded places but I'm down for whatever. If I somehow run into one of you the first round is on me.
Hamilton,3bsu3v,petrolbee,3,Thu Jul 2 03:33:01 2015 UTC,"Rolly Rockets at Locke and Main is a great place to go for beers, sports and some pool, the food is great - southern style BBQ, not the healthiest but really delicious. A new place opened in Hess Village called Arcade, I haven't been there yet but hear that you can play all the games for free if you're drinking. A great mexican restaurant just relocated into Hess Village too, called Mex-i-can. Just a warning that most people who aren't young insane party animals tend to avoid Hess Village, especially on weekends, because it gets kind of ridiclous.  Second Friday of every month (so July 10th) is the art crawl, which takes place along James Street North - lots of people come out, galleries are all open and there's live music, street vendors, etc. Check out The Brain on James North if you're into a low key place with good craft beers, and Work a little further north up the street is a small restaurant/bar with great food. Academica is a great diver bar on that street too though it's hard to find, but just ask a local to point you toward it, most people on that street will probably know what you're talking about.  Gage Park is a beautiful park a little further east in the city, there's a big annual festival going on there on July 10-12. Check out the ""new music expo"" stage if you can find it, lots of the best local music happening there, usually a great lineup.  Best venues for good quality live music: This Aint Hollywood - James st. n.  Homegrown - King William  Baltimore house - King William  Doors - Hess (not in Hess village, it's just south of Main, usually books heavier music, often metal)  Casbah - Queen @ king  Some great but slightly more expensive restaurants: Brux House and Aberdeen tavern are good, kind of upscale pub atmosphere I guess you could say, Earth to table bread bar and Rapscallion are both well loved places to eat  Two of my favourites are pretty much right next to each other on James Street south - Bronzie's is a little hole in the wall pizza place with great pizza, also a good place to watch sports, and Wass is really fantastic ethiopian food, both are right near St. Joe's hospital.  You can rent a bike for cheap through SoBi bike, and we have plenty of car share cars located all over the city.  Cab companies - blueline (905-525-blue) or Hamilton cab - 777-7777. Or you could try Uber, but I don't really know anything about using them, personally.  Make sure to go down and check out the waterfront as well, there's Bayfront, Pier 8 and Pier 4, all really nice for walking, biking or just hanging out. Williams is a big cafe down at pier 8, and there's also a swanky restaurant down there called Sarcoa. There's a roller skating rink next to williams if you want some good old wholesome fun, you can rent skates.  Groceries - there's a farmer's market in Jackson square, where there's also a big grocery store called Nations, discount grocers are food basics and no frills, Mustard Seed is a great co-op (york blvd), and there are outdoor farmer's markets sometimes on Ottawa street and Locke street. Chuck's burger bar on locke street has great poutine, btw.  If you like coffee, my favourite cafe personally is Johnny's on Locke street. There's a new place on John street called Pinecone, haven't tried it yet but it looks promising. Detour in Dundas is amazing. Other places that people like are Democracy on Locke street and Mulberry on James North. If you find yourself on the mountain, Finch on Upper James is also great, as is E23 on Concession. Papa Leo's is also a great restaurant on Concession, and I enjoy the Wobbly Scotsman for some dive bar drinks in that neighbourhood.  This became kind of an all over the place post, sorry about that! There are lots of great things that I haven't included, for instance I never really go to Westdale so haven't included anything from over there, most of what I've suggested is downtown or right at the top of the mountain brow.  In terms of getting up the mountain without a car, there's a trail called the radial trail that will take you all the way up, excellent for walking or biking, also lots of great hiking opportunities. Entry point is at the southern point of dundurn going west, and Wellington at Forest going east. Seriously consider making it out to at least a couple waterfalls in the area as well, some really beautiful spots to visit in quite close proximity to the downtown area.  Hope you have a good time, check back with us and let us know what you end up doing and how it goes!  *edited for readability"
