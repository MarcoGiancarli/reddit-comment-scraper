amv,3e2k9f,Inorai,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:42:09 2015 UTC,"From looking at it, my guess is they are layering several different effects, using keyframes offset from each other so that they don't all trigger together.  They are using a blur effect that drags the lines of the video, a color edit that either uses black and white or separates the colors of the video into RGB components, are adjusting the size/angle/location of the viewing window to give it that jittery look, and applied a filter over the top to shade the outer edges, which could either be a static texture they dropped in or it could be generated using one of the cookie cutter effects in many programs.  My only recommendation with that is to use it very sparingly and with great consideration to the music - the human eye needs a certain frame length to process what it is seeing (I usually use 6 frames of a consistent effect or clip as an absolute minimum), otherwise things pretty rapidly degenerate into a blurred video and a headache.  Edit:  Upon rewatching with audio, they have additionally cut out a certain number of frames so that the video appears to rapidly flutter between the anime and blackness.  They use this to enhance that film-reel sound effect."

If you plan on making more AMVs, try and create a story for one. An AMV that can depict a good story gets way higher credit in my opinion. That's not saying that all AMVs have to have a story. Yours for example is perfect as an AMV that just blows you away with epicness. After watching it a few times I've really come to appreciate the way that you use lighter scenes in the beginning of the AMV, just like how the anime looks like a light hearted magical girl anime on the surface, but it later becomes very dark and epic."

amv,3dsjyw,Im_Heartless,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:18:52 2015 UTC,"I'll just jot down my thoughts as I watch... And yes, Sony Vegas is nice.  Also, I haven't actually watched the anime yet.  I've only made a few amv's and don't know the ludicrous work involved, but i've been watching amv's for 10 years.  So here's my 10 cents.    First and foremost, I liked your video, and it made me want to watch the anime.  When I watch an amv of an anime I haven't seen, it should make me want to watch it, without spoiling too much story.  When its of an anime I have seen, it should make me remember some of the best parts.  I feel that your video accomplished this.  I think the mood of the song is a good pairing with the anime theme.  I thought using the grey scale up to the first chorus was nice and emphasized the change in action into the colors.  It seems like your transitions need to be a little faster.  I noticed a little at the beginning, but at the end of the first chorus it was at least a half-second too slow.  It doesn't look like you tried to do any lip sync, which is really difficult and time consuming, but can make a good scene into an excellent scene.  The matching of song content to anime content was done well.  Transition at the second chorus was good.  In scenes where the anime characters are talking, but the music has nothing to do with them, I feel like it is disconnected.  Like... There's talking being shown, but it wasn't important to know what they were saying... so was it important to the video?  I thought the overall story building of drama was nice, slowly making me want to know the story more as I watch the amv.  During the scenes where you drop the music volume, and let the characters actually talk, there should be subtitles for those of us that don't speak Japanese, or know whats going on.  The ending was done well, although it ended rather suddenly with no time for the excitement to drop, although its a pain to do without adding more music to the end.  If that was your first, you did an awesome job, better than I did.  Keep it up, you're doing great."

I remember even when i was using vegas that I would have to watch the video post-render to get all my timings the way I wanted them.  and Im kinda ocd... so it took a while.  Lip-sync is not something I would even consider for your first few, just get used to timing and transitions first.  amv subs are usually disliked, but having not watched it, I didn't have a clue what was the connection, and I thought subs would have explained.  I always enjoyed watching the timing on this video if it helps you at all.  https://youtu.be/SuXpcI4mmUE"

amv,3dsjyw,GravelordingErryDay,0,Sun Jul 19 13:54:45 2015 UTC,"Well, here's my criticism. Hopefully you can take criticism well and that you don't take any comments personally if you want to improve.  First lesson: get Sony Vegas Pro, seriously. It's probably the best program to make AMVs/MADs with. I know, I know, it's your first ever video, and we all have to start somewhere (I started with Windows Movie Maker), but I'm not saying you're not allowed to use anything else but Vegas Pro for your first video, I'm just mentioning the fact that it's going to be easier to improve with a better tool.  Second lesson: hide the subtitles. The video looks more cleaner and professional that way. It's a major turn off to see AMVs (especially MADs) that have subtitles. Use RAWs, RAWs are basically footage that do not have any subtitles, having them shown originally as they were in TV. You can get RAWs from NyaaTorrents.  Third lesson: don't show characters talking unless you're utilizing a lip-sync style or when you just can't help it. It's an error that most beginners' videos tend to suffer from.  Fourth lesson: make use of effects and transitions. Having no effects nor transitions leaves the video stale and it gets boring after a while. From fade-ins to fade-outs and the blurs and such, add some spice to the video! Having almost no special effects in your video works only with MAD openings/endings, an example would be my video.  Fifth lesson: make it easier to distinguish between flashbacks or recaps, like when you were showing Rin remembering (?) Shiro Fujimoto or his brother Yukio, add the black and white effect, etc. Whatever that makes it easier for the viewer to see that ""oh, he's having flashbacks now"" or ""oh, so in order to build up what's about to happen at the end, he's showing [the character's] experiences! I get it!"". Having no effects would leave the viewer confused and question: ""What the hell was that random scene? Was that supposed to be a flashback?""  Sixth lesson: Each scene (or at least majority of the scenes) has to have a purpose! Ask yourself: Hmm... why do I want to have this scene in this specific timeline? Is it because it fits with the lyrics being said? Is it because it flows better than the other extra part? Perhaps because I can show what I want to show in the appropriate order? Why do I even want to show this in the first place? Some people just figure it out along the way, so maybe that may work out for you as it has for me, but remember the purpose.    Criticism aside, I like the song you went with as it fits Ao no Exorcist. I also see what you did in the beginning because it has specific lyrics, ""they're all around me, circling like vultures"" referring to the mini-demons along with ""wash away my colors"" being emphasized through the black and white effect. But the purpose of having 30 seconds of black and white needs to either be clearer or changed.  I know it's a lot to take in as a beginner, and I could ramble on for a long time about this (I'm a retired AMV/MAD editor, you see), but if you want to improve, keep those in mind!"
amv,3dsjyw,Rythiz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:53:45 2015 UTC,"Second lesson: hide the subtitles   ehm,beside the first part, which is part of the into (i know the show :P) there are no subtitles and the intro ones are ""hardcoded"" o: did you even watch the video ?  agree on the other parts tho, AND FUCKING GET VEGAS :D"
amv,3dsjyw,GravelordingErryDay,0,Mon Jul 20 06:51:00 2015 UTC,"ehm,beside the first part, which is part of the into (i know the show :P) there are no subtitles and the intro ones are ""hardcoded"" o:   That's all of it - the beginning. That's right, it's hardcoded, but that doesn't mean you can't zoom/pan & crop it so that it doesn't show up. That's exactly why I said ""hide"", not remove (which would apply to softsubbed episodes). But if he's using a basic video editing program, I'm not exactly scolding him/her for doing so. The criticism is directed towards his/her improvement with his/her next AMV.  Oh, you reminded me: another part that I forgot to mention other than subtitles is to use creditless openings/endings if possible/available.   did you even watch the video ?   I don't know, did I? Did I make up my criticism in my comment? You tell me."
amv,3dsjyw,Rythiz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:40:32 2015 UTC,"You are right, and editing out subtitles is easy if they are in in the bottom and if the source material is high enough quality, but look at the watermark in the top, if its the same episodes that i got then its 720p, not enough for cropping, besides that if he cropped it you wouldnt see most characters since they are behind the titles."

amv,3cttly,scholarsent,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:49:07 2015 UTC,"You're going to start crossing some legal boundaries pretty quick here. Amvs are considered under the fair use act depending on legal interpretation, largely because we're not paid.  Given that you potentially own the rights to the song, that still leaves the use of the anime which your prospective creator would use.  If you wanted to use it purely for your own enjoyment, that's one thing, although most amv editors will likely have exactly 0 to offer in the way of a quote because we essentially never get paid. At that point you would simply be filing a request for an amv;  editing to rap or hip hop is one of the more rare editing choices, but you could maybe find someone. If you want to use it for marketing or as a pv, I don't see that flying from a legal standpoint.  You would have to negotiate with the owner of the anime to have its use with your product approved."
amv,3cttly,Inorai,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:19:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this. When I posted I wasn't very familiar with the AMV community, I hadn't realized these videos were all clips from previous videos (lol). I have someone working on one for me, now I wouldn't release it as an ""official video"" or anything but you think I would still get in trouble? Non monetized video, no sales as the song is a free download."
amv,3cttly,Inorai,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:51:16 2015 UTC,"If you just have it posted on youtube somewhere non-monetized, its unlikely that they would sue you or anything over it.  Youtube looks for markers in the audio and such when you upload a video, which is usually where people get caught.  Since its your own song, the audio should be fine.  You can still get in 'trouble' for the video with amvs, and in my experience youtube Strikes are more commonly issued for video violations (not at all a rule, just my experience).  If you get 3 strikes, your account is removed.  To put it in perspective, I've been editing for 9 years and I'm on my fourth youtube account due to them being removed solely due to non-monetized amvs.  If this account you're using is tied to the company, I don't know if they would be cognizant enough to pursue the company somehow with the violations, but either way you would have to accept that whatever account its posted on has the potential to be removed permanently from youtube because of amvs.  It's a choice you'll have to weigh :)  Do I think its likely?  Probably not, especially if you're just posting the one single amv, which would translate to one strike.  But the chance exists.  If it isn't posted on youtube, then you could face take-down notices or violations for using copyright material, at that point since you're not working through youtube it could be more legally interesting, I have no experience."

amv,3chmlz,Dbar412,3,Tue Jul 7 23:50:03 2015 UTC,"I would say that my biggest criticism is either because of the length or the flow of it - Basically, it's 'flat'; The scenes tend to mechanically follow one after the other in the same order they are aired in the anime, and everything is full throttle with no variation in the mood or atmosphere to emphasize the flashy highs.  And thats completely normal in fight amvs, to have scenes be more follow-the-leader, its just emphasized by the short length of it :) I think if this were expanded into a longer amv using more of the song that some of this might go away naturally.  Positives, I really liked the energy of it, everything was pristine and cut smoothly so that it felt very natural.  I liked your use of brightness flashes, and your restraint to not drown out the show with added effects.  You did a pretty darn good job of taking the feel of the song into account and timing cuts to pair it all up."
amv,3chmlz,Inorai,2,Wed Jul 8 02:40:25 2015 UTC,"//Copy+Paste my crit on youtube.  Hey Dbar, really solid little project you have here. I work in the CG animation industry and went to school for Animation/Film. Below are ""food for thought"" things, please don't be overwhelmed and view it as one topic you can expand on at a time. Try your best to think about flow and eye trace. Flow being If an object is swiping screen left to right, try to have the next shot do the same (some moving from screen left to right) to be less jarring and seamless. Eye trace is wherever the viewer's eyes are focused, try to have the next shot's focus at the same point. This helps the viewer read the next image faster. Also take in account it takes 8 frames for a viewer to register something. 16 to truly see it (speaking in 24fps). I know your going for pacing, but the punch at 6 seconds would be stronger if you showed more windup frames. Instead we only see the contact and follow through, no distance traveled, which makes it feel weaker. Also, cutting too much and fast  just makes it so we don't know what is going on (which is bad), so be careful how you use it. Clarity is King. (there are tons of Kings, like Story, it's kind of like Game of Thrones.) Try finding a larger variety of transitions besides just a cut to make things more interesting. You could do a match cut, jump cut, fade (black or white), dissolve, swipe, or wipe. Maybe you can cut on an object or motion when you start mingling multiple animes together or even multiple fight scenes. ""Every Frame a Painting"" has some videos on the above stuff. He's a great dude. More resource look up film editing videos, or maybe diagnose how your favorite sequence in a movie progresses. Good luck, and happy editing, can't wait to see your next one!"
amv,3chmlz,Brok3nGun,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:17:29 2015 UTC,"And yeah, what @Inorai said about pacing.  I know it's an intense song, and only 30s , but do your best to find a place to let us rest, the contrast will highten your actiony/quick-cut moments. Try slowing it down right before you want to punch is with one of them! :)"

It has nothing to do with logos or subtitles, it has to do with using their show.  I'm on my fourth account on Youtube in 8 years because of this.  If you can't get it past youtube, I would recommend opening an animemusicvideos.org account and putting your collection on there so that it's still available if you can't get it on youtube.  Maybe someone here has a magic fix, but it's one of the problems spawning from the questionable legality of amvs."

amv,3buxlj,5JACKHOFF5,2,Thu Jul 2 13:59:51 2015 UTC,I agree with most of the other replies here and to add to it for me its seeing the creation and embodiment of your emotions and ideas put in an animated form. And watching how that affects people is something you can never replace in fulfilling your hearts path imo. Because for me atleast and i would say for most AMV makers you can learn a lot about the person from the emotions they put forth in their amv and seeing that and connecting with people through it is just awesome to me .^

The song starts slow, maybe gilga with some stares, a lot of sync. It gets violent, more fight with every hero, more sync. It starts ending and going slow, more fights that makes gilga look losing. Insert some of his memories from his past as a possible sign of regret (the fight with raider could be included there because happens in the desert, and kinda seems like gilga old habitat) and epic ending. I don't know if u should end it with getting stabbed by archer or just when he lost his arm and seemed to get sucked. Maybe the latest. Ahh well. Just an opinion. Good luck.  ."

Cut them completely out which is the most common Add the audio with the subtitles to convey a story as seen here here and here    That is the first thing you want to take care of and if you have any other things you want to ask about I would be glad to try to give the best advice I can.
amv,3b8bp7,skater687,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:15:02 2015 UTC,Thanks for advice!  Im kinda new to this amv making and ive been watching alot of amvs so I figured why not make my own! True the subs are still present but this was a first so I guess it doesnt count :P edit: spelling
amv,3b8bp7,punkfac3kid,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:12:07 2015 UTC,"More friendly advice, try to watch the intake of scenes where people talk unless you are trying to match the lips with vocals in which case looping scenes makes that super easy if you splice and repeat clips to match the songs, but other than that this is pretty good."
amv,3b8bp7,silvershonen,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:29:54 2015 UTC,"Do you know any place where I could download the RAW clips since I really cant find any place to download them unless I download the dubs and just mute them, but then there would be the watermark on the corner like I had Kissanime on there, although I dont know if the watermark is a big deal or not"

Then you just find yourself burnt out.  It comes and goes, I just started up again after not touching any of my software and not watched much of anything after 4 or 5 years.  Who knows maybe you just need a break and will start get that itch again to just dabble in it."

I'll still probably do small projects like 15 - 60 second videos, but nothing worth calling an ""AMV"", which is why I said this is my last.

amv,38ku44,Average_Jon,2,Fri Jun 5 18:08:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I was just bored of video games one winter break.  My plan usually starts with a goal I want to achieve for each video.   Examples:   Piece of Toast - sync all lyrics and mask every transition  Anime 404 - parody a bunch of memes/ amvs, add some weird crap as well  Salty Stick - 10 day deadline so only use hardcuts. Give each sound a matching video clip and sync  Waifu Insurance - start serious by parodying existing ""Don't txt and drive"" commercial. Start to devolve into random nonsense  The thing that usually takes the longest is finding the right scenes. Editing is the easy part"
amv,38ku44,Average_Jon,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:02:57 2015 UTC,"How many practices did you do before you uploaded your first AMV as BakaOppai? I mean I remember seeing your Chuunibyou video when it was first uploaded, but was that your real first piece or just the one you decided to upload, because personally it is better than a lot of other people's AMV's especially for someone's first time."
amv,38ku44,Average_Jon,2,Sat Jun 6 00:15:17 2015 UTC,I knew how to do basic things (like hardcuts and fades) in Sony Vegas from random projects previously. When I decided to start making AMVs the only anime I had downloaded at the time were 2 episodes of shinsekai yori (which I hadn't watched yet).  Started out watching a few youtube tutorials for different effects and wanted to sync it with something so I added a random song I had.  Practiced changing scenes with the music and ended up making an actual video out of the random things I learned. Test AMV: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsoGeGILgOk
amv,38ku44,Average_Jon,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:29:15 2015 UTC,Wow. It seems hard to sync a song with no audio to a video but this one and a few others this one and also this one seem really natural. I've always wanted to make an AMV but always deterred when I see other really well made one. Can you link the videos you watched if possible? Also really looking forward to seeing more of your videos.
