If you won't talk to your doctor, at least get the smallest dose, 25mg, and cut them in half. Start out slow and see what reaction you get. Then move up to a full pill if you need to. Also keep in mind that studies have shown that a person can develop a dependency on the pills if they are using them without actually needing them.

This may not apply to you since I drive in one of the worst places to drive in the US. I get in a situation at least once a month where not reacting to a dangerous driver would cause a crash. I've never done it but it would definitely be easy to just let some other idiot take the blame for the crash.  If your car is a dump, then it will be declared ""totalled"" if the cost to repair exceeds the value of the car. You wouldn't need to crash at a dangerous speed to achieve that."

myfriendwantstoknow,3dznrq,OneRedSent,5,Tue Jul 21 00:21:10 2015 UTC,That's insane. How did he not get anything from his insurance company? I thought it was their responsibility to either sue the drunk driver's insurance or pay it themselves if they aren't able to resolve it (or if other driver doesn't have insurance and doesn't pay).   I'm in DC /northern Virginia. Last time I checked I live within 25 miles of 3 of the top 5 worst states cities. I think it was based on state farm's reported accidents per capita.

I know because I had to deal with issues from that for years. I do want to say that he is pretty immature for considering this. Insurance fraud is one of the reasons insurance costs so much in the first place. Tell him thanks for contributing to raising our rates. Oh yea, the other poor driver who must have increased rates and deal time out of their day/week to deal with a wreck car and pay for that is a big factor too. What if he crashed into a mother with a baby? A dog sitting in the front seat without a harness? Not only can he be charged with insurance fraud, he can be charged with some other very severe crimes. Basically, there is no way to do it and get money for a car from insurance without potentially injuring yourself and another person. Maybe if you hired a deer to jump in front of you or to have a tree fall on you if you have full collision with extensions to accidental damage not related to crashes. If he crashed into someone like me to make it my fault, he would ruin my damn life for the next year.

Insurance will pay out what the vehicle's current worth is based on it's condition, mileage, etc. If you buy a brand new $40k car and  10 years later get in an accident, you're not getting $40k. You're going to get whatever the depreciated value is to replace it with a like car.   If it's financed as well, they won't cover the full amount owed either.   If you owe $30k and it's worth $15k, you're responsible for paying off the remaining $15k on the loan. GAP, an addendum to the financing, will help cover the difference in this instance, but you have a deductible associated with it as well."

Also be sure to give regular meter readings to the power company if you're doing this, this reduces the chance of been flagged for fraud as you'll just appear as a low consumption customer.  Also, worth mentioning. You can and will be arrested for meter tampering if you are found out for this... the beauty of it is that you can remove it when you're not using electricity to reduce the chance of this happening.

myfriendwantstoknow,3dtwro,IUseThisForScience,28,Sun Jul 19 12:41:49 2015 UTC,"Here's the ELI18-and-this-is-my-first-joint version:  Cannabis (indica or sativa, mostly) is a plant. The harvested flowers of that plant contain THC, a psychoactive compound. That compound can be extracted following different process and consumed in various ways.    When the flowers of the cannabis plant are dried and smoked, it is referred to as weed, pot, marijuana, dope, sinsemilla, ganja, grass.... When the THC is harvested by collecting the trichomes (resin-filled appendage) and pressing them into a semi-solid bar of green/brown material, it is called hashish, hash, shit, resin....    Concerning the cultural difference: In Europe, cannabis is consumed in various ways, including hash. This is because the European culture of cannabis was imported from the Middle East and northern Africa where hash is the traditional way of consuming cannabis.    In the US, weed is more prevalent because this African/middle Eastern tradition was not present when cannabis became really popular (among non-native populations) at the beginning of the 20th century.    Concerning the dank ratio: Hash usually has a higher THC content than weed because of the way that it is made. The type of strain, the quality of the plant material and the process used to grow it and make the hash will influence the quality of the high. Same thing for weed except there is no process to make it. You just dry it and smoke/vape it.  EDIT: As Smekaren commented, in the Nordic countries (as in the rest of Western and Central Europe I believe), growing weed has become more popular and as a consequence, people tend to smoke more weed than 20 years ago. I do feel however that the hash/weed issue is also a class question. Hash is still generally cheaper than weed and therefore a product consumed by people with less income. What do you other Europeans think of that?"

myfriendwantstoknow,3dtwro,Montaz,4,Sun Jul 19 20:32:09 2015 UTC,"I just want to add that in northern Europe, hasch used to be more common (easier to distribute and harder to detect in customs) and ranging from pretty weak (cut and/or badly done) to high quality. Nowadays everyone and their dog grows regular weed, either small scale at home or at a small plot in the remote woods or in large hydros, so these days it's pretty common with locally grown high quality weed.  Source: smoked weed every day for ten years. I quit cold turkey a little over a year ago."
myfriendwantstoknow,3dtwro,smekaren,24,Sun Jul 19 20:50:29 2015 UTC,"Well, weed is the unprocessed plant matter, where as hash is made by extracting the pure(ish) THC from the plant matter.  This is accomplished by collecting the trichomes, which can be done a few ways with varying degrees of effectiveness, and then cooking it all down. (The THC has to reach a certain temperature before it can affect your brain.)"
myfriendwantstoknow,3dtwro,Dr_Chillz,4,Sun Jul 19 13:07:16 2015 UTC,Squeeze your bud. Feel the stickiness? That's the 'hash' in your bud. All the different kinds of hash are simply a result of the different methods used to strip the stickiness off your bud.  Hash is an umbrella term for everything ranging from BHO to screen-pressed kief to pure LHO concentrate.
myfriendwantstoknow,3dtwro,H1_L1fe,2,Sun Jul 19 16:32:52 2015 UTC,Hash and Weed both come from the same cannabis plant. The high that you get from Hash/Weed is from the THC. Weed is just the dried leaves of the cannabis plant. Hash is the sticky resin like layer on the cannabis leaf. (The whiter it is the more potent it is) Hash gives you a more potent high due to higher THC concentrations. [For more info check out strain hunters video](www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqFiucWKo-8)
myfriendwantstoknow,3dtwro,sandy1kumar,5,Mon Jul 20 07:23:30 2015 UTC,"For people in the US, I think we basically smoke what we have available to us. In my own experience here, finding the green flower you see with 20% or more thc is easy while hash is more difficult to come by. I've been able to acquire a few grams of hash over the years, it was pricey but very potent.   Hash tends to come from places like Africa and the Middle East, so right next to Europe. While the US is known for importing poorly-grown ditch weed from Mexico."

myfriendwantstoknow,3dhzox,hallmark1984,15,Thu Jul 16 19:02:11 2015 UTC,"Let me give you a more complete answer.   If you download a torrent that has 100 seeders and only contains the *.txt text file, *.srt subtitle file, and a *.mp4 video file you have nothing to worry about. The file types cannot contain viruses and it's unlikely that 100 other people downloaded a virus and kept seeding it afterwards. These many-seed torrents with only the files you need are the best practice when torrenting.  In addition, if you do come across a virus you are most likely to come across a windows virus which is harmless because your device is android.   Thirdly, if I were to pick a piece of kit to get infected, I'd rather it be a $99 tesco tablet than my desktop or phone.   Finally, the way you really get in trouble with viruses is when you try to torrent apps for your tablet. These are overwhelmingly the vector for viruses to be introduced to a tablet.  PS. Keep in mind that even when you ""delete"" a file from your device, it is likely to still be on there in some form. It's not possible for it to run and infect your device, but it's possible to ""recover"" the lost file with some specialized hardware.  PSS. I'm not sure how effective security software for tablets is, but if it's from a trusted vendor it can't really be bad for the device."

myfriendwantstoknow,3dhzox,adventure_dog,2,Thu Jul 16 14:38:49 2015 UTC,"The main device health risk with torrents is misleading links.  Many torrent sites will have a ton of false links saying things like ""download now"" If viewed without an ad blocker.  At best those lead to some expensive subscription site, but many of them will offer you a ""downloader"" program that installs adware.  My advice is to always use a magnet link if your torrent client supports it.   The above may apply more to downloading on the PC and then loading it on the tablet."

They may have received request from copyright holders as well, which is where you could get in legal trouble.   While people may hate you, do not just seed endlessly.

There's only one thing you don't do with this kind of money - don't buy material things. Buy experiences instead. Any sudden upgrade to your lifestyle is a bad bet. Buying an old car and fixing it up is not a legit paper trail, it's a dead end, and only works in movies about Russian gangsters. You'll wanna learn to whitewash when the money gets bigger but it's a little more complicated than that, not to mention time consuming.  Keep it cash.  You can either spend it slowly or use it to, fx, host a party or take your friends out to eat."
myfriendwantstoknow,3d8zdq,2Private4MyMain,4,Tue Jul 14 16:08:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, true, but if you want to keep the money for the long-term and don't want it to raise suspicions - cash or elaborate spending is not a good route. Cash will be seized if/when he's raided and used as evidence against him. It's unlikely he'll be able to get that back, and it's basically the equivalent of just having tons of drugs laying around - it looks really bad. He needs to convert it to fake real income via laundering."
myfriendwantstoknow,3d8zdq,DoctorDanDrangus,3,Tue Jul 14 19:47:09 2015 UTC,"True, if they're looking for a $3000 drug dealer and you're a suspect with $3000 laying around, that's not good. But hosting a party for the money won't raise that kind of suspicion. That's a good way to launder small amounts of cash since you can claim yard sales or something similar. It's more watertight to say you saved money from the yard sale to celebrate your birthday, than to say you randomly held a yard sale and then decided to buy a new computer for no reason. The first one makes sense, even if you're low on money, the second one will just get people going like: ""dude, you're broke as fuck. Couldn't the computer wait?"""
myfriendwantstoknow,3d8zdq,2Private4MyMain,3,Tue Jul 14 22:36:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the idea is that he wants to hang onto his cash, ie: make it legitimate (or atleast not so obviously il-legitimate) and save it or buy things under the guise of having legitimate money. If he wanted to just piss it away on this or that, he doesn't need a scheme to do that. No one is gunna seize his computer or new shoes as repayment for his crimes. Similarly, what good is it to throw a party? He could do that anyway. Unless it's Project X and he books Deadmau5 to play at $25,000 an hour, no one will bat an eye but he just ends up wasting his money.   In other words, he can waste his money however he wants and it won't matter. If he wanted to invest, grow or save his money - which I'm guessing he does - he'd need to make it look clean. He could buy a house, for instance, if it looks like he makes 50k/year running a lawn service.   So, his options are thus: 1) spend it frivously on small stupid things and get nothing for it except the immediate gratification of having new shoes or throwing parties or something; 2) spend it on big things not-so-frivously or deposit it haphazardly and run the risk of raising red flags because you're making large purchases with cash or depositing large amounts of cash into your bank routinely; 3) launder the money and make it clean and do whatever the fuck you want with it because for all intents and purposes, it's legitimately earned money.   Heads up to OP: money laundering is a separate crime that they would charge you with, among other things related to it. They would prove such a crime has been committed by showing that you don't really have a business. So, if you had a fake lawncare business they're say ""where are your lawnmowers? who are your customers?"" I'm sure you're smart enough to think of a way to minimize that sort of risk (ie: buy lawnmowers, cut some lawns, make it look legit)."

myfriendwantstoknow,3d8zdq,cool_mas,0,Wed Jul 15 04:49:33 2015 UTC,"OP - don't listen to these fools. You need to figure out a way to launder money. You can do it hilariously like in Office Space and sit there and try to figure out what that even means, or you can create a business that generates money (or work with someone else who already has one, but that's a different bundle of potential problems obviously).  So, incorporate yourself as something like ""Douche Diggler Enterprises, LLC"" and sell - or pretend to sell - trinkets online, or something. When you get your money through illegal avenues, you run it through that business as sales in whatever you sell. You could have a lawn service, who cares. You'll have to pay taxes on it, sure, but if you're clever you can figure out ways to write off enough shit and you shouldn't have too much to worry about if you're not making a lot of money anyway. If you are making a lot of money, you need to really start focusing on making your fake transactions look real.    Here's how to incorporate. It's not hard. It comes with a lot of different responsibilities, like having to file taxes and keep a fake ledger, you couldn't do something stupid like list your first year income for your new company as 100k in online trinkets or anything, but if you're not an idiot and do it right, it's probably a better idea than just depositing 20 grand into your bank account every month and declaring no income or minimum wage on your taxes.   If you don't wanna deal with paperwork and the effort involved in doing something like laundering your money, you could always buy something that is valuable and will remain valuable and give it to someone to hold in case your house gets raided. So, if you can buy gold or something and trust someone to hang onto it for you - do that. Cash and assets will be seized in the event you are raided and used against you. Don't just sit on a bunch of cash.   Alternatively (this is really just another form of money laundering), you could give it to someone else to give to you. So, if your mom is weird and approves of you selling drugs - and it's not a lot of money - give her the cash and have her write you a check for help around the house or some shit. Again - don't just sit on lots of cash.   EDIT: if you go the incorporation route, you would have access to your money by writing yourself checks as your own employee/president of the corp and you could then deposit those into your checking and have a fake legitimate income. Again, taxes will be an issue but audits and tax evasion charges (how they get you when they can't pin drug charges on you) probably won't."

When you're done up there on your high horse, perhaps you'd care to evaluate why you yourself are here on this sub with your impeccable ethics.   I'll continue this little pissing contest and humor you with a few obvious observations: this is a hypothetical situation. Someone inquired how money could be laundered, I explained how money could be laundered. There's obviously no relationship behind my Reddit alter-ego and this person's throwaway discussing a hypothetical situation, but okay - that's fair. Next time I feel like chipping in, maybe I'll just direct them to information that can be found anywhere else online rather than just explaining it to them.   Secondly, you called my bluff - I am retarded. I graduated from high school, but it took like 12 years.  Lastly, I made some assumptions about OP's question that are completely unreasonable in retrospect: 1) I assumed that $3,000 was the result of only a few illegal transactions; 2) I assumed that granted he was in the business of trafficking drugs, he'd probably have more such transactions (stupid, I know - drug dealers never re-offend or sell more than just a few times to make a little extra money) and thus would probably have much more income than the $3,000. I guessed that he meant he was getting small amounts like that in on a fairly regular basis; 3) I very stupidly assumed that a person who is actually willing to sell drugs and inquire on Reddit how to cover their tracks is probably not that concerned about tacking on additional charges if they were actually interesting in doing it; 4) I used this crazy thing called hypothesizing where I suggested a scenario in which a thing might happen in response to a question -- not that that thing should happen or that I am an authority on the matter -- and assumed that non-retards would understand that this is a bullshit factory.  Does anyone actually follow advice they get here? Am I also an accomplice to a murder if I explain to another Redditor that bodies can be disposed by chopping them in pieces and fed to carnivore livestock, like pigs?

I'm pretty sure that if you offered anyone who is ""on the books"" a green card with all the rights and responsibilities of it, they'd take it in a minute.

But if we get more poor people, that means more mouths to feed with not any extra money to feed them. So, we'd have to scale back our socialist programs.  And the problem isn't that the current illegal immigrants are going to break us – we're already paying for some things and we're just fine.  The problem is if we legallize all of them, a bunch of other immigrants will want to come, and if we allowed these immigrants we have to allow those immigrants.  So that's why there's a bunch of beauracracy, a language test, and a fee for entry. We're trying to regulate the numbers so that it doesn't make the two countries equally poor."

myfriendwantstoknow,3d5h8a,Luke_Fletcher,3,Tue Jul 14 15:11:23 2015 UTC,"Don't know how to explain so he is someone else talking about it instead  There are a few explanations for this, and also ways to alleviate the issue. Protein is processed by the kidneys and liver, which use water in your body to remove unnecessary byproducts. A big increase in protein consumption could thereby cause dehydration since more water is being used to digest protein and remove wastes. Dehydration can lead to hard stools and constipation. High protein diets may also be accompanied by low carb/fiber intake. Fiber is what adds bulk to the stool and promotes regularity. Animal proteins contain little to no fiber, so you need to make sure you’re getting enough fiber from other sources. If you’re experiencing constipation from a higher protein diet, ways to remedy the situation are to: Make sure you are drinking enough water. A common recommendation is to drink 2/3 of your body weight in ounces of water, assuming a normal amount of activity. Consume fiber. Great sources include beans, legumes, vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. Consider decreasing the amount of protein you are consuming If you experience issues with constipation and don’t have a bowel movement for 2-3 days, you should speak with your health care provider."

Your friend should eat more fiber. This issue may stay for a long time since your friend's body was trained to be that way. So fiber bars or pills might be needed for a long time for your friend to retrain his or her butt. I have a friend who would want a more powerful option than fiber bars and a less powerful option than medical laxatives.

I'd be hesitant to call though in case it was dodgy and they decided to take it out on me because they had seen me looking.   What are the neighbours like?

You join by filling out a petition or application and by having a master mason in good standing sponsor your petition. If you do not know any master masons, simply contact the lodge you are interested in's secretary, and you'll be invited to some events so you can meet folks over a few dinners who would be willing to sign your application if you're a good fit. You're young, so make sure to find a lodge that fits with you. Freemasonry is currently gaining some traction amongst younger folks and so you might be able to find a vibrant lodge with some younger people.  My advice is that you wait, however, until you can be more settled. If you're in college, you'll be moving a lot, but if you plan on sticking around it can be a good idea."

Many are just old men being super old together. Some lodges also have open houses.

It sounds like OP's friend is very focused on having vaginal intercourse, as he calls it 'sex', failing to realize that it isn't the only kind of sex there is.  I think OP's friend should ask his girlfriend if she even wants to have vaginal intercourse. She's probably been taught it is 'real' sex, and everything else doesn't count as 'real' sex, even though in my experience males tend to focus on it more than women do. And even if she doesn't find it painful, that doesn't mean she will ever enjoy it.  My advice is to work with her body as opposed to against it."

Don't get TOO drunk or high though, because that could make it harder to perform too.

Touch her, rub her, let her touch and rub you.  The second you feel anxiety, stop, start breathing and focus on relaxing.  I mean that, just stop what you are doing and make relaxing the most important thing in your life at that moment.  I might take 5 minutes, just do it.  Back track and just cuddle for a bit, take all the pressure off, she knows she isn't getting sex and knows you don't have to perform.  That should help you to relax.  Do this a couple of times.  Then start to escalate.  From cuddling naked, to fingering, blowjobs, so on and so forth.  Then, go for penetration.  Once you feel anxiety, stop and focusing on relaxing.  Practice this for a bit until the feeling is all gone.    When you are with her, close you eyes, smell her, feel her skin on your skin and how that makes you feel.  Listen to her moan when you touch her, you will get very hard.

There are billions of people on the planet because we are built for fucking. You, sir, are the end result of millions of year of boning evolution.    It is a physical, even primal act. Embrace that. Sex can still be tender and loving, just remind your brain to back off and let your inner mammal do what it was made to do. Growl if you have to.    Quit smoking. I smoked 1-2 packs a day for years.

I've seen people with train horns.   Cops will ask you to remove it if they see it.   However, if you install a cop horn and or any emergency vehicle and use it for that purpose, you'll get in trouble."
myfriendwantstoknow,3c5yww,TheMuffnMan,2,Sun Jul 5 19:45:02 2015 UTC,"I am not a lawyer.  However, so far as I'm aware it is not usually illegal simply to change a horn sound.  There are often sounds which you are prohibited from using (legitimate emergency vehicle sounds for example), and there may be limits on how loud they can be.  But as a general rule it's more limits on specifics rather than a blanket ban on changing the sound of the horn."
myfriendwantstoknow,3c5yww,LA_DOSIS_PERFECTA,2,Mon Jul 6 02:49:15 2015 UTC,"The correct answer is it depends by state, assuming you're in the US.  For Virginia, the statutes are as follows:  http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-1059/   Every motor vehicle driven on a highway shall be equipped with a working horn capable of emitting sound audible under normal conditions for at least 200 feet.   http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-1060/   It shall be unlawful for any vehicle to be equipped with or for any person to use on any vehicle any siren or exhaust, compression or spark plug whistle, or horn except as may be authorized in this title. It shall be unlawful for any vehicle operated on a public highway to be equipped with any warning device that is not of a type that has been approved by the Superintendent. It shall further be unlawful for any person at any time to use a horn otherwise than as a reasonable warning or to make any unnecessary or unreasonably loud or harsh sound by means of a horn or other warning device. However, vehicles of common carriers or extraordinarily large and heavy vehicles may be equipped with such type of warning device as the Superintendent may require or permit.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this article, a siren, bell, or supplemental horn may be used on a vehicle as a noisemaker for an alarm system if the device is installed so as to prohibit actuation of the system by the driver while the vehicle is in motion.   The Superintendent being this guy  If you were in Virginia, you could drop him an email to have it approved/disapproved. Virginia can be rather strict about aftermarket parts that aren't OEM-equivalents. So a louder horn (like a train horn) which is not a direct OEM aftermarket replacement would likely be illegal to use while on the road. The statutes do state that it could be used for an alarm system."

myfriendwantstoknow,3c2y0y,OneRedSent,9,Sat Jul 4 07:24:16 2015 UTC,"Legally, I don't know, have your friend talk to a lawyer if she feels that's proper. I know it's super hard to own your mistake and it's very easy to seek ""revenge"" and/or absolution from the bad experiences. It's natural to try and seek out an easy way.   However, I realize it's very easy for me to sit and judge after the incidence is over. But use this as a good lesson..  Never do something that could put you in a bad situation later, never put yourself in a situation where you can be accuses of ill intentions. To top it off its not a good thing to use company tools, and the company's time to backtalk company employees.   From now your friend probably has learned to keep work completely professional. It's never a good idea to vent to someone who is close to the situation because you brew negative feelings. Offcourse your friend should vent and reflect, but with someone outside like a friend or a spouse, and not in working hours, and never in written words. If it can come back to haunt you, don't do it.   Try to win the office over one by one. Apologize, and tell them that you never wanted this to happen, you don't feel bad about anyone, tell them you learned your lesson and that you will be utterly professional from now on. And then give it time. Be humble and honest from now on.   In the future when someone try to instigate negative talk about people you can say: I don't want to talk about x person without them being here, OR just be completely positive.   I'm sorry this happened to your friend, but your friend can and should learn from this, and come out as a better person. Good luck!"

Some like sniffing it, but it can be quite uncomfortable and the high is more short lived.  The high is joyous and a feeling of connection with everything around you.

If he is merely curious, however, I'd emphatically suggest you don't go around opening doors. They don't completely shut ever again. That's something you'll learn if your friend keeps fucking around with drugs. Eventually he'll stumble on one he really likes. It won't be how he would expect, it will seem much more natural and totally normal - like getting laid for the first time - but the odds are stacked against your friend in terms of being able to navigate drugs without finding one that grabs him by the balls.   Of course you can be a drug user for your whole life and be a productive normal citizen, but the odds are not in your favor. Most people that find that magic drug become a Lotus Eater from the Odyssey (20 points if you get the reference) and slowly stop giving a shit. 15 years go by and you realize you fucked up.   So, that being said and your friend knowing the stakes are high -- opiates are outstanding. Two thumbs up. Way, way up. They can also totally ruin your life if you're not really careful, though, so tell your friend to tread lightly. Maybe peek in the door. Don't go all balls and start bangin heroin, try a little oxy and leave it alone. Run the other way. It's like Turkish Delight and you'll only want more and more all while the evil dark shittyness seeps into your soul(another 20 points if you got that reference)."

Edit: NITROUS IS FUCKING AWESOME, DO IT. Just make sure to get some oxygen during hits and it is a very safe drug.  Medium risk: GHB, 2c-b and other research chems. Research chems are interesting but you need a scale and a good supplier.  HIGH RISK: Heroin, Methamphetamine, Alcohol and Xanax and other pharmaceuticals. These drugs are probably amazing but they have an extremely high risk vs reward. Edit: PCP is a very interesting drug but lots of people hate it and find it scary.  I would stick with the low and medium risk categories but definetly try Xanax or Valium atleast once because they're awesome, just don't drink in combination with them. Alcohol is high risk but also an awesome drug so moderation or the odd binge may not hurt much, watch for addiction though."

They care if you make them soup when they're sick, that you go out of your way to care for their parents, and that you have their back one hundred per cent of the time. They care if you smile at the waitress. They care if you're the sort who makes excuses and self put downs (why would I go roller skating with you? I haven't done that since I was a kid. It'll probably hurt my knees or something... How about we rent a movie...) or if you're the kind to approach everything with a positive attitude (roller skating? Awesome! I haven't been since I was a kid, you'll have to go easy on me, what a great idea!)  Attraction is 20% what you look like, 80% what you ARE like. It takes an awfully big belly to hide a big heart.

It's far easier to consume sugar in liquid form than it is to eat it. It's easy to quit drinking soda too, and this easy change can make a big difference.

myfriendwantstoknow,3bvdhk,Firemedic83,2,Thu Jul 2 19:19:02 2015 UTC,"Ignore unsolicited advice about your friend's diet - as a woman who has dated my fair share of bigger guys (and am now with a scrawny dude) it's not so much about how your friend looks but about what women around him are like. If a woman likes a person for their personality, their weight (unless it's like, really obese) probably won't be a huge deciding factor. Not that it won't be in the mix, but it might not ruin your friend's chances if his personality meshes with hers. I can't really give a percentage since we're all different - some girls will be just looking for a hot guy to have sex with, some girls are holding out for the perfect man, and some girls just plain aren't interested in dating. Based on your other comments, your friend is also kind of shy - so is my SO. We met online, so if your friend really wants to find someone that's an option too!  Tell your friend to do what makes him happy - if he's not happy with his appearance, by all means work out and change his diet and try to lose weight! But if that's not his game, and drinking soda or playing video games is what makes him happy, so be it. In my experience, women (who are in the market for a relationship) are really looking for someone whose personality compliments theirs. Your friend should keep his chin up and focus on what makes him happy and feel more confident in himself, and I'm sure that will attract the right girl when the time is right. Hope that helps!"

Find a smaller, no-frills liquor store (some ""mom and pop"" thing, not a 7-11) and just walk right on up to the counter. Depending on the neighborhood and the owners, there's a good chance they won't even card your friend unless he acts suspiciously. And if they do ask to see your friend's ID, just tell him to say ""sure thing"", reach for his wallet, and pretend like he forgot it or something.  SOURCE: ""My friend"" was buying alcohol at a liquor store down the street from his apartment when he was 19. Never got carded once. Also bought alcohol at several other places as well, only got carded about 1/3 of the time. This was in California though. Might be stricter elsewhere.  EDIT: Protip: Also buy some other, non-alcoholic stuff as well. Seems less suspicious that way.  EDIT 2: No advice on getting into a club though. All the clubs my friend has been to definitely carded, but he's only ever gone to the nicer, more well-known clubs in Hollywood. Might be different at other clubs? No clue."
myfriendwantstoknow,3brcvs,imBobertRobert,9,Wed Jul 1 18:25:32 2015 UTC,"I don't know about your experiences, but a mom and pop store would be more likely to card OP's friend than not. It's easy to lose a liquor license for small stores, so an owner would be much more likely to card someone than, say, a chain gas station were a minimum wage employee checks people out.   That also probably depends on whether its in the city or in a smaller community. A city store would most likely check more than a smaller town store."
myfriendwantstoknow,3brcvs,Lionhart2008,5,Wed Jul 1 21:43:01 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. It is definitely dependent on the area and the people in it, but it's more likely that an owner wouldn't card someone. The owner wouldn't have anyone else to answer to except for the law, and there's a very small chance that the owner is actually going to get in trouble for not carding (especially in a city, where there's probably a large number of stores; a small mom and pop operation is just another face in the crowd, and has a lot less to worry about).  A minimum wage clerk, on the other hand, has to answer to the owner, who probably wouldn't appreciate the clerk making decisions that could directly affect the owner in a bad way. And in a chain operation like a 7-11, there's a lot of people in the chain of command to whom that minimum wage clerk will ultimately need to answer.  Again however, I do want to stress that this opinion is based on a lifetime of living in the big city. If you do live in a smaller community, these suggestions might not apply quite so well."

For example, if it's August of 2015 and your birthday is 03/09/1994 (September 3 1994), the cashier might believe your birthday is March 9th, 1994, which would make them believe you're 21."

myfriendwantstoknow,3bks0r,LoneCookie,15,Tue Jun 30 04:15:35 2015 UTC,"If you can't pay, the court orders your debts to be erased. It fucks up your credit too, but you don't have to hide from anyone."
myfriendwantstoknow,3bks0r,OneRedSent,6,Tue Jun 30 04:18:57 2015 UTC,But it also means if you make any wages they will possibly be garnished depending on the kind of bankruptcy filing.
myfriendwantstoknow,3bks0r,BigAngryDinosaur,4,Tue Jun 30 05:21:59 2015 UTC,Isn't that only if you set up a payment plan at the time of filing? I really don't know all the complexities.
myfriendwantstoknow,3bks0r,OneRedSent,11,Tue Jun 30 05:50:54 2015 UTC,"In the old days, filing bankruptcy meant a get-out-debt free card, you just sacrifice any semblance of credit for about 6 years. The laws have changed, and there are different chapters of bankruptcy depending on your intentions, you income/employment and who your debts are to.  I don't know much past that."
myfriendwantstoknow,3bks0r,BigAngryDinosaur,4,Tue Jun 30 06:12:12 2015 UTC,"It also doesn't ""erase"" unsecured debt like student loans."
myfriendwantstoknow,3bks0r,firematt422,2,Tue Jun 30 12:21:26 2015 UTC,"It doesn't ""erase"" secured loans. You're right that student loans can't be discharged, and that they aren't secured technically, but they're the exception. All other unsecured debts are typically discharged (with the exception of certain tax debts with are also unsecured, but are given priority and treated different, depending on the circumstances).  So, for instance, if you own a home - that's a secured debt. It's secured by your home. You'd either sign a reaffirmation agreement which says you're agreeing to preserve that debt or you surrender the collateral (the home) and discharge whatever is owed up and above the amount owed that isn't paid for by the value of the home."
myfriendwantstoknow,3bks0r,DoctorDanDrangus,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:47:08 2015 UTC,"No it doesn't. If you declare bankruptcy, all garnishments are ""stayed"" immediately. The company garnishing your wages will even probably have to repay what they've taken from the 90 days before you declared bankruptcy and if they take any after you declare bankruptcy, they're in contempt of court. Bankruptcy discharges all garnishments and judgements."
myfriendwantstoknow,3bks0r,DoctorDanDrangus,2,Tue Jun 30 17:43:09 2015 UTC,I thought owing money by itself fucked up your credit. Hmmm...

myfriendwantstoknow,3bks0r,Alexwastaken,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:07:22 2015 UTC,"If you never take out any kind of line of credit - credit cards, cash loans, etc. - then you have no credit history. And good credit history is needed in order to obtain things like mortgages or vehicle financing. Having no credit history is almost as limiting as having bad credit.  There are common misconceptions when it comes to credit. For example, many people think it boosts your credit score to pay off debts swiftly. This isn't so. What helps your credit score the most is making regular payments on schedule and over a long period. So if, say, you experience a windfall (inheritance, a good tax refund, a settlement, whatever) and the windfall would pay off a debt owed, then it's always smart to consider the option of retaining the money and devoting it to making the steady monthly payments to that debt."

The winter is cold, you don't always have a way to make a living -there's only a number of those knick knacks anyone will buy, your crops may fail, friends and family will be tired of subsidizing the venture.  Eventually your friend will need to come in from the cold, apply for Medicaid and Welfare, and realize he doesn't have a social security fund.

I suppose there are some pretty remote areas, maybe in Canada where nobody will find you for a very long time, but sooner or later, whoever owns the land, government or private, will stumble on your little setup and try to kick you off.   It's actually easier to get out of paying debts by not paying. I'm not advocating this, but in my experience half the time an unpaid debt under a certain amount will eventually be forwarded to enough different collection agencies and finally forgotten until it's no longer viable to be collected on.   It screws your credit up really bad though."
myfriendwantstoknow,3bks0r,CalmSpider,4,Tue Jun 30 05:25:55 2015 UTC,"This depends on where your friend lives. In the United States, where I live, it is illegal to imprison someone for failure to pay a debt. Most debts, other than student loans, fines, damages from a lawsuit, and a few others, can even be removed through bankruptcy (more detailed info at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy). Obviously, there is no way to avoid bad credit without paying off all debts, but there is no need for someone in the US to hide in the forest to get away from creditors.|  Depending on where your friend lives, their mileage may vary."
myfriendwantstoknow,3bks0r,autowikibot,3,Tue Jun 30 05:22:57 2015 UTC,"Bankruptcy:       Bankruptcy is a legal status of a person or other entity that cannot repay the debts it owes to creditors. In most jurisdictions, bankruptcy is imposed by a court order, often initiated by the debtor.  Bankruptcy is not the only legal status that an insolvent person or other entity may have, and the term bankruptcy is therefore not a synonym for insolvency. In some countries, including the United Kingdom, bankruptcy is limited to individuals, and other forms of insolvency proceedings (such as liquidation and administration) are applied to companies. In the United States, bankruptcy is applied more broadly to formal insolvency proceedings.

If you don't have any assets (eg: property that you own like a car, a house, whatever) which I'm assuming you don't, there's not much they can do anyway. You're what's called ""judgement-proof"" meaning that even if they sue you, you don't have anything they can take anyway. Provided all you have are bank accounts, just be aware that if your checking/savings is with the same bank that you owe a separate debt to, they can just take what's owed out of your account. The solution to that is to bank elsewhere.   Either way, just declare bankruptcy. No reason to go into hiding - they can't arrest you or cut your hands off or anything, this isn't ISIS-controlled Raqqa."

In which case, they'd monitor public records with your name on them, they'd check to see if you have a bank account somewhere, if you've been arrested somewhere for something, etc. all in an effort to find out where you're hiding. When they find that out, they'd sue you and serve you there. That's all."

Why not take some time to be gentle on yourself by looking directly at the problem and accepting it? Even if your friend completely declares him/herself to be a failure to banks, creditors, etc., s/he can start all over, which would be kinda like starting a new life in the woods, and over the course of the next 5-20 years s/he can really improve his/her credit rating. A huge benefit would be that s/he wouldn't have to live in fear of collection agencies or companies tracking him/her down.

myfriendwantstoknow,3bcjkl,OneRedSent,22,Sun Jun 28 01:13:03 2015 UTC,"I worked at a major US bank for a while, and let me tell you: We know when this happens. Banks don't automatically assume that you're doing so in bad faith, but the funds will be withdrawn from your account in a rather short amount of time. Not the least of which because there's a happy MICR number on the bottom of the check that we have to enter into a system in order to cash it, and that number is automatically scanned by the system when you do online picture deposit. This is why you have to take a clear pic of your check, preferably on a dark surface: because we use OCR technology to figure out the MICR number, which also includes check numbers. In fact, odds are if you cashed said check with your phone and then deposited it elsewhere, it still might not work, depending on what time you cashed it. The funds might not be withdrawn from the person's account when the check is cashed, but we live in a digital world. The banks pass that info back and forth rather quickly.   If this would be an intentional thing, I suggest against it. This is federal prison you're looking at, check fraud is NO JOKE. If it's unintentional? Either they'll take the money back, or if you withdrew it all (which looks suspicious as hell, btw, and won't bode well for you) you'd probably want to deposit it asap, or set up payment arrangements. Your bank will prosecute for it, and your odds of winning that case are ungood."

In medium-sized companies, it's not unusual to see one manager who gets stuck doing all the terminations, but that's not because he gets paid to do that. Normally it's because he's good at it, or he doesn't mind doing it, and everyone else hates it. I've been that guy before and it sucks. A lot of managers dread terminating people. They'll put it off and whine about it and eventually you'll agree to do it for them just to shut them up.  In larger companies, it's not unusual for HR to send an 'adviser' to sit in on the termination, but they're not actually there to do the firing. They're just there to make sure the manager doesn't fuck it up, agree to things that are against policy in a fit of guilt, or say something (""you're too fucking old/female/ugly/foreign/etc. and you've got to go"") that will get the company sued.  Finally, there are consulting firms that help companies handle ""separations"", but those are generally called in when there's a large layoff/downsizing/fat-cutting/outsourcing-to-China going on. Once again their primary role is making certain the company doesn't get sued, but they also advise on public relations, offer placement or re-education services to the dearly departed, that sort of thing."

From my experience and what I have read, if the dog comes charging at you, give it your forearm or elbow. The dog will be faster than you expect and giving it your arm will at least keep it away from chomping your balls. Get a dominant position and push your arm back into its mouth, this will not allow the dog to bite harder. Proceed to whale on its face. If the dog is larger than you, well you are fucked.   When I was attacked the first thing I did was put my hand out in a choke position thinking I was going to block the dog by grabbing its neck, like a stiff arm. The dog bit my hand and fucked up my finger. The second time it lunged I put my forearm out because the dog was coming low and I was really just thinking ""MY BALLS!"". There was no tactical reason for the move other than the desire to keep my nuts. I later read somewhere this is a good thing to do. Unlike the article I read, I ripped my arm back after it had bit me, which set the dog free and allowed it to try attacking again. This time i was all adrenaline'd up and was able to punch the dog a few times in the head while someone was dragging me to safety into their house. I was bleeding pretty bad from my hand and arm, but I am sure I would have gotten more fucked up if that stranger didn't give me someplace to retreat to."

myfriendwantstoknow,3b9zur,AreaManatee,8,Sat Jun 27 06:55:19 2015 UTC,"First thing's first, don't be stupid about your money just because you're in a casino.  Decide in advance how much you can afford to lose.  Buy that much in chips right off, and then don't buy any more.  Period.  For the whole night.  No matter what.  You might feel like your luck is sure to change.  A lot of people do, and just buy a little more, then a little more, and then they're walking away broke.  Don't do it.  Don't buy in for more than you can afford to lose.  In fact, assume all your money is gone once you convert it to chips.  If you win, and get to keep some, that's a bonus.  Think of it as an entertainment budget.  If you spend $X to be entertained for the next hour, is it worth it?  As a general rule of thumb any game other than blackjack or pai gow is going to lose you money, fast.  Bonus bets, things like matching the dealer's up or down card, or having a hand greater than a certain value, are for suckers.  They're going to pay out much less often than the ratio of what they pay out.  So, if a given hand pays out on a given wager 3:1, it pays out way less than a third of the time, and probably less than a tenth of the time.  If you're going to play blackjack, a good rule of thumb is assume the dealer will bust if their up card is a 6 or lower, and assume they won't if it's a 7 or higher.  If their hand is likely to bust (6 or lower) don't hit on anything over 12.  If it's unlikely to bust (7 or higher) hit until your hand total is over 17, then stay.  If you have a 9-11, and the dealers up card is less than your total, double down.  These are general rules of thumb, this chart will give you more information."
myfriendwantstoknow,3b9zur,JustJonny,6,Sat Jun 27 11:54:01 2015 UTC,"Section 7. Basic strategy of article  Blackjack:       Each blackjack game has a basic strategy, which is playing a hand of any total value against any dealer's up-card, which loses the least money to the house in the long term.  An example of basic strategy is shown in the table below, and includes the following parameters:    Four to eight decks The dealer stands on a soft 17 A double is allowed after a split Only original bets are lost on dealer blackjack   Key:   S = Stand  H = Hit  Dh = Double (if not allowed, then hit)  Ds = Double (if not allowed, then stand)  SP = Split  SU = Surrender (if not allowed, then hit)   The bulk of basic strategy is common to all blackjack games, with most rule variations calling for changes in only a few situations. For example, if the above game used the hit on soft 17 rule, common in Las Vegas Strip casinos, only 6 cells of the table would need to be changed: double on 11 vs. A, surrender 15 or 17 vs. A, double on A,7 vs. 2, double on A,8 vs. 6, surrender(if not allowed, then hit) on 8,8 vs. A. Also when playing basic strategy never take insurance or ""even money.""   Estimates of the house edge for blackjack games quoted by casinos and gaming regulators are generally based on the assumption that the players follow basic strategy and do not systematically change their bet size. Most blackjack games have a house edge of between 0.5% and 1%, placing blackjack among the cheapest casino table games. Casino promotions such as complimentary matchplay vouchers or 2:1 blackjack payouts allow the player to acquire an advantage without deviating from basic strategy.

The hand signal for hit is a finger tapping forward, the signal for stay is an open hand sliding horizontally (don't pass it over your wager), double down is a hit after placing an additional stack of chips next to your initial wager (not all casinos require a hand signal), split is your index and middle finger extended in a V shape after placing your additional chips, and surrender is your index finger extended out, drawing a line on the table, behind your wager.  This video shows it pretty well, and gives you an idea of why.  The bird's eye view is pretty similar to what the surveillance observer sees."

My first time in Vegas a dealer actually took me and my friends to a craps table that wasn't being used and explained how the basics of the game works.

A casino is basically like any other leisure place like a club or a bar, you can basically get in and do whatever you want, outside of being destructive/disruptive. Don't worry about being a gaming rookie, dealers are usually very friendly and eager to explain how things work (at least we are where I work). You can stand by a table and watch as much as you want, and sometimes, if the table is not too busy, the dealer will even allow you to sit down without having to play. You can buy chips directly at the table (keep in mind they don't have a till, so don't expect change back), and when you're done, you can exchange them at the cashiers' ""cage"".  One last suggestion: If/when you win money, PUT IT IN YOUR POCKET. As long as you're playing with $5 chips (up to $25), it doesn't really matter whether you win or lose, but as soon as they pay you with a higher color, PUT THAT AWAY, and keep playing with the $5 chips you got; I see too many people betting red ($5), winning and winning until they get a bunch of black ($100 chips), and then betting THAT and losing all of it in the space of 3 minutes.

If you win then and you get paid with a higher color, PUT IT IN YOUR POCKET and keep playing with reds, or whatever the $5 are (they'll most likely be red). If you get to the point where you have A LOT of higher chips, you can test the water and play one at a time, but as soon as you win, STOP and color up. I'm not saying you'll have more (or any) money in your pocket at the end of the night, 'cause that happens veeery rarely, but at least you won't squander all your ""leisure funds"" in the first 3 minutes.

It probably means she is desperate for someone to talk to or likes your friend and wants to be besties and this is how she is going about it. I have certainly texted people to the extent I am assuming she is (personal issues, almost immediate answers, etc) but it's typically (I went through that awkward phase too, okay?) reciprocated and after quite a while of conversation (either texting or in person).  If your friend is comfortable with it and thinks he made a new friend, that's cool. Meeting people is awesome.  If not, he should let her know he's uncomfortable. Not answering at all will likely make her go crazy with ""what ifs"" but he needs to be polite enough to continue working with her. A simple inquiry on speaking to someone else, or just directly saying she's sharing a bit too much information might be best. (Results may vary.)  Edited for ""your friend."""

Obviously this isn't a diagnoses you should accept from some internet stranger, but please, please talk to him. Gaming addiction is often a symptom of a larger issue like this. It was for me, and I almost died because of it. It's not a comfortable conversation to have; it's awkward, weird, and you'll likely be yelled at, but if your friend cares about his brother at all he needs to talk to him about this.

If his case is the later, and you're actually trying to help him, try getting him into a sport you enjoy. Something that promotes social interaction while interesting him. If you're just trying to get him off the computer and you really don't care about his mental health, you could edit some of his game saves and corrupt them.

If it's actually a problem, I think you need to check his mental health. Gaming addiction isn't much of a thing by itself, it's caused by other things.  Just don't have the entire ""lol wat a neckbeard"" mentality, because then nobody with half a mind is going to help your friend.  I suggest actually getting a therapist to help your friend's brother. Before that, just directly confront him.  Addiction in too many cases is mistaken for enthusiasm, but I think there is a problem in your case."

Don't do it just once either, make an effort to include him when you go out and have fun and try to interweave him as much as possible in your own circle of friends.

Drug dogs will be found in border situations where smuggling is the concern. I used to travel with some herb years ago and in an airport had an officer with a dog point to me to be checked. He didn't find the herb cause the dog was a bomb sniffer. Afterward I talked to the officer about his dog and was able to find out from him that the two disciplines drug vs. bomb sniffing  are separate tasks and can't be done by the same dog."

Test for purity and if a deal seems too good to be true it probably is. The substances you're probably gonna want to look into most are LSD, 2-cb, MDMA (semi psychedelic), and shrooms in low doses (about a g of good quality). Some of these can be hard to find in certain areas but if you live in a city setting, I'd start asking around in clubs and places like that, maybe a concert too. If you live in a rural area, I would try to find a dealer that sells shrooms or order a research chemical along the lines of 1p LSD (the good thing is this is legal, you can literally order psychs straight to your doorstep no problem, the bad thing, very little research has gone into these substances. They are usually very newly developed, but all structural similarities indicate they produce the same effects as acid just with mildly different visuals. But we are still unsure of their relative safety until more research is done.) Rural areas are harder but you could also look at the darknet if you do fancy. /r/darknetmarketnoobs and /r/darknetmarkets are good resources for that.

I did a lot of research on Google and /r/trees.  Read this.  It worked for me and I'm a large male who smokes regularly.    Also find out if it's a drug screen or test since there are differences as other commentators pointed out.  Since I wasn't too sure if this method would work, I bought a couple of at home tests which screened for the same levels (50ng/L) as the drug screen for my new job.  I passed the at home drug screenings and felt more confident taking the real test.  Good luck!"

If you're trying to get a job requiring a security clearance they might very well go all out.

Once I followed a link to a clip buried somewhere in Motherless.com (which I do NOT patronize anymore for this very reason) wherein a girl started having sex with her dude and he insisted on anal and she wanted him to stop and he just basically raped her and it was awful.  It was so fucking terrible -- I wanted to cut his dick off.  Fuck.  That.  Shit.

YFSK that the lion's share of foodborne illnesses don't come from restaurants, but from people's homes, meaning most people make themselves sick with poor food prep.  As a final note, I also read that when trying to sue a restaurant for making a person sick, it's pretty important to have several people who all ate there that same day who all developed the same symptoms, which means they'd all have to seek medical aid to generate the necessary legal documents (which is unlikely for minor symptoms like diarrhea)."

To summarize: If the 3DS of your friend's system has a firmware <=9.2 installed use a gateway card (recommended) or a custom firmware (I don't know what the current state of the art is there - but it seems to be possible without flashcard). If a higher version than 9.2 of the firmware is installed, sky3ds is the way to go since it does not rely on specific exploits.

If it's a shared Internet connection + router, if I was the PS3 guy I'd just walk over and hard reset the device erasing the config.   QoS policies are the way to go. Then he would just complain about poor performance on Netflix or online games but still has a connection. Far sneakier way to accomplish his goal."

Acts just like a normal credit card, except it was bought at a walmart and has no information attaching it to you. (This is a good precaution as well, if you forget to cancel it, forget to move money, whatever, you can't be billed for more than what's already on the card, some, not all porn sites will do shady shit like making you call in to cancel and triyng to talk you down with ONE MORE MONTH FOR 7.99$ (Out of the 4 times i've paid for a porn site, I've had one do that, the other three canceled without issue)  for #2? Seriously, order it to your house. Sex shops exist for a reason, everybody does it, trust me, the inconspicuous amazon box with AMAZON KINDLE FIRE tape is less conspicuous than say, the time I walked out of a sex shop with a anal training kit and had it fall out of the bag in front of the strip club next door.  But if you are THAT paranoid get a po box, when they ask who else will be using the Po box, put ""SNEAKYTOWN INC."" or something stupid, have the mail sent to the po box addressed to SNEAKYTOWN INC -- I have a po box, I get mail for the chinese foot massage parlor who owned it before me from time to time, all addressed to ""VIP FOOT SPA #1"", isn't strange at all."

He also might check out the sex shops as he is leaving the country in a few weeks and doesn't anticipate anyone ever recognizing him in particular.  He thanks you and he'd buy you reddit gold but then reddit would know who is gilding an answer about buying porn online. So he'll do that with the prepaid card as well, while using a VPN because he's technologically challenged and thinks everyone is watching his online activity."

For the porn I agree with the prepaid card idea, but note that some of those require a mobile phone number to activate.

Specifically:   As you know, hazards for which OSHA does not have a specific standard are governed by Section 5(a)(1) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (the Act; General Duty Clause) which requires that employers provide employment and a place of employment that are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm. Citations for violations of the General Duty Clause are issued when the four components of this provision are present, and when no specific OSHA standard has been promulgated to address the recognized hazard. These four components are: 1) the employer failed to keep his/her workplace free of a ""hazard""; 2) the hazard was ""recognized"" either by the cited employer individually or by the employer's industry generally; 3) the recognized hazard was causing or was likely to cause death or serious physical harm; and 4) there was a feasible means available that would eliminate or materially reduce the hazard."

myfriendwantstoknow,3a5x69,evilbrent,12,Wed Jun 17 14:06:34 2015 UTC,"When downloading torrents your friend only ""needs"" to have the VPN active at that time. The biggest threat to torrenting is the copyright owner or their representative monitoring the IPs actively downloading/uploading content. They only ever see your VPN IP. Make sure she stops all torrents and closes them program before disconnecting from the VPN.  Can she stay connected at all times? Sure. There's really no downside besides the potential to have slower internet, but she's using it for torrents anyway so the speed has actually been compromised a bit.   Is it possible to send all torrents through the VPN but use everything else the same?   Yes...But it's not easy. It'll require knowledge of IP tables and possibly access to the router. I'm not even sure if basic consumer routers have this capability.  Note however, this is is only related to torrents. If your friend is considering masking her identify online for other reasons, things get a but murky. Cookies, sessions, browsers, site logins and other methods used to track online habits typically have ways of associating multiple IPs to a single person, thus merging their data and nullifying her anonymity.  Edit: I should also add, the VPN service has the ability to log your IP address. If they are obligated to provide this information to a government, she is no longer anonymous. However, if the VPN does not log IPs, they have no data to surrender. But again, with torrents this scenario is highly unlikely if not unprecedented for the average person."

It doesn't have to be on if you don't want to conceal what you're doing, though.  And it's certainly possible to use the VPN only for torrents, but a bit complicated. How to do it exactly depends on your operating system. The easiest way would probably to run the Torrent client in a virtual machine, have it use its own virtual network device and bridge that to the VPN's interface while routing everything else through the physical one. Alternatively, limiting the Torrent client to a certain IP range and routing only traffic to / from those ports through the VPN's device would work as well."

It will get cleaned up by the admins. If it's a picture, just let it be. Sites like that get cracked down pretty hard and pretty fast. You're not doing yourself any favors by wrapping yourself up with the nation's cyber security division. You're not going to get in trouble for viewing any picture online. It's expensive to track down the device it was viewed on and nearly impossible to prove who actually viewed it. It's a better use of resources to go after the distributors.

myfriendwantstoknow,39xejd,alienrated,39,Mon Jun 15 16:08:30 2015 UTC,"Nope.  To establish theft (in the US at least) you have to establish intent.  Obviously if your friend paid for the item, and had no way of knowing that it was going to be a newer game, he didn't intend to steal anything.  Now, if your friend was swapping things into other boxes, switching price-tags around etc, well then you better hope they don't have that on camera, because that establishes intent."

myfriendwantstoknow,39xejd,davidloach,16,Mon Jun 15 18:02:43 2015 UTC,Yeah your friend is fine
myfriendwantstoknow,39xejd,deltopia,10,Mon Jun 15 18:09:56 2015 UTC,"The store may still have a legal claim to the item -- legal ownership is not binary; the game is not 100% either yours or the store's in this case.  You each have an argument for it.  But your friend 100% did not steal it on any level; there's no chance that the police can show up and haul him away for theft.  If it were a game that cost, say, $10 million more than he paid for it, this is what would have to happen:   The store would have to establish proof that he walked off with the wrong game, probably in the form of receipts and video cameras on the register, maybe in the form of a written statement by the employee. The store would have to go to court and tell the judge that your friend had it, even though he hadn't paid for it, and they deserved it back. The store would have to FIND your friend to demand him to come to court to defend his position (i.e., ""Hey, I paid for a game, I got a game, it's not my fault that they're incompetent!""). The judge would have to sympathize with the court instead of with the guy who didn't get what he asked for.  This would require the judge to have never in his entire life ordered a medium rare steak and gotten one well done.  Zero chance.   For a normal, less-than-$200 item, we're talking preposterously more in legal fees than the game is worth.  Legally, no chance on earth they do this.  Forget about it."
myfriendwantstoknow,39xejd,Koooooj,6,Tue Jun 16 01:48:31 2015 UTC,"This is correct. ""You didn't commit a crime"" is not the same as ""they have no right to demand the property back,"" but it's more effort than it's worth to try to recover it for something cheap."

If you find $10,000,000 in cash, someone is probably missing it, and is going to notice and figure it out.  Same case kind of applies here.  For a video game? No store is going to care enough to bother.  If OP's friend truly did just buy a game that was packaged wrong, and he DIDN'T know that to begin with, it's the store's error."

If people can tell that he thinks he is attractive, he will likely come across as brash and annoying.  If people can tell that he thinks he is unattractive, he will likely come off as pathetic.  Your friend should worry instead about whether he is taking care of himself and looks his best.  Regardless of how attractive he is based on genetic makeup, there are aspects of his appearance that are under his control.  He should clean himself and control the way he smells and dress himself in a way that makes him feel confident, and he will be as attractive as he can be.  It's not a useful question to ask, unfortunately, and your friend will very likely get a different answer from everyone he asks.  Also, those answers will be dishonest nine times out of ten."

myfriendwantstoknow,39nxuv,danarchist,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:46:02 2015 UTC,It feels weird.  If your friend is flexible he can find out himself how it feels.
myfriendwantstoknow,39kzg8,FarwellRob,15,Fri Jun 12 13:38:02 2015 UTC,"If your friend get rashes, tell him to go to his doctor and have an allergy test. They will tell him what he is allergic to and then he can buy a deodorant without that stuff in it and he will be able to use it and smell nicer.  Another suggestion is clinical strength deodorant which will prevent sweat for 2-4 days but that may still cause a rash.  Bath and body works has masculine scented body spray I think which can be put on over clothing but won't prevent sweat. Nice smelling lotion will give off a nice scent too."
myfriendwantstoknow,39kzg8,Kellbelll,6,Fri Jun 12 13:53:26 2015 UTC,"He has had lots of allergy tests in the past.  Basically he's allergic to everything. :)  He will look into the body spray, but is a but worried about the clinical strength deodorant. The rash isn't a lot of fun."
myfriendwantstoknow,39kzg8,whatIsThisBullCrap,8,Fri Jun 12 14:09:20 2015 UTC,"Tell your friend to talk to a dermatologist. Even if your friend is allergic to all matter in the universe, a dermatologist will be able to recommend something without it"
myfriendwantstoknow,39kzg8,ColsonIRL,3,Fri Jun 12 18:43:41 2015 UTC,That's a great idea.  I'll tell him to look into it.  Thanks!
myfriendwantstoknow,39kzg8,narzy,3,Fri Jun 12 18:50:53 2015 UTC,"Your friend should look into Maxim. I personally have problems with extreme underarm sweating and have been successfully using Maxim for 3 years. I don't have allergy issues like your friend, but hopefully this will work for him. It's also completely unscented, so if your friend finds a scent he can successfully wear with no rash, he could combine the two."
myfriendwantstoknow,39kzg8,Sean1708,2,Fri Jun 12 20:19:42 2015 UTC,Interesting.  I'll pass it on. Thanks!
myfriendwantstoknow,39kzg8,Tedrabear,3,Fri Jun 12 20:24:32 2015 UTC,Your Friend should also perhaps try Mitchum. SWIK has issues with deodorant and has found Mitchum to work well and not create hives or itchy pits. YMMV. GL
myfriendwantstoknow,39kzg8,JETEXAS,2,Sat Jun 13 03:51:23 2015 UTC,"He's been leery of antiperspirants for quite a while, but he'd give it a try."
myfriendwantstoknow,39kzg8,JETEXAS,6,Sat Jun 13 04:01:45 2015 UTC,Does your friend wash his clothes regularly? Clothes can start smelling really bad surprisingly quickly. Tell your friend to do a two week trial where he doesn't wear any item of clothing more than once and see if that helps.
myfriendwantstoknow,39kzg8,jarious,4,Fri Jun 12 14:35:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, he's married and has a successful business.  He and his wife share laundry duty and he rarely wears clothes twice in a row.  And then only on days when he's working in the yard and knows he will smell bad no matter what he does. :)"
myfriendwantstoknow,39kzg8,SomeCasualObserver,4,Fri Jun 12 14:44:07 2015 UTC,Have you tried a 'sensitive' deodorant? Most brands have their own take on it but if regular deodorants cause a burning sensation (admittedly a rash does sound more serious) then the sensitive equivalent can often prevent this.
myfriendwantstoknow,39kzg8,jarious,2,Fri Jun 12 13:58:15 2015 UTC,"He has tried a few 'sensitive' deodorants but gave up out of frustration.  Some of the seemed to be even worse than not wearing anything. They seem to only work for a few hours at most...  but he admittedly hasn't tried many different types.  The rash is unique.  He said that it has been happening for at least 12 years, and has pretty direct evidence of it happening at least 10 times.   To be exact, if he wears anti-perspirant for more than 2-3 days at a time, he breaks out in a very itchy rash on the inside of his wrists.  The first few times he figured it was coincidence, but over the years, it's become more and more apparent that it's cause and effect.    He is also allergic to some clothes washing detergents and lots of other things, so this isn't an impossible jump.  However it is very strange that it doesn't happen in his armpit.  Funny story: A few years his Reddit Secret Santa worked for Pfizer, who owns Chapstick.  She sent him a holiday Chapstick tube that made his lips swell and go numb for 6 days.  It was awkward and very funny ... afterwards."
myfriendwantstoknow,39kzg8,SomeCasualObserver,4,Fri Jun 12 14:17:15 2015 UTC,Baby powder?
myfriendwantstoknow,39kzg8,jarious,2,Fri Jun 12 14:15:12 2015 UTC,"He has used that before and it's been effective.    It can be a bit messy, especially around the office.  Any ideas how to apply it easily?"
myfriendwantstoknow,39kzg8,biff_wonsley,7,Fri Jun 12 14:20:49 2015 UTC,"Tell him to pour the baby powder out on the floor, strip naked, lightly mist himself with a spray bottle, and then roll in the powder. Should be a perfect application."

myfriendwantstoknow,39kzg8,hohosaregood,3,Fri Jun 12 15:04:47 2015 UTC,"For the armpits tell him to try lime juice, it does an excellent job as an odor eliminator, he can even use it as hair fix instead of hairspray or gel, for the cologne I would grab a bag of potpourri and rub some in his hands and spread the oils in the hair or the neck, maybe some in the arms."

It's a luxury that we all take for granted. Tell your friend to try using a brush to scratch his back as incentive. ""Just goin' for a nice, hot, wet backscratch.""  If he normally showers, he should try drawing a bath. They are incredibly relaxing and pleasant.  Tell him to consider how lucky he is to be born in an age and a society in which bathtubs are standard near-universal household objects, and to imagine himself in the place of a flea-bitten stable-boy in the dark ages, dreaming of taking a warm bath while he sleeps in the stables, next to the soiled straw on the dirt floor, on a cold and windy winter's night."

myfriendwantstoknow,39h2jw,-Pelvis-,7,Fri Jun 12 00:25:01 2015 UTC,"Ever notice how after you spray some air freshener in the air, you don't smell it after a while? Or someone walks into your house and says ""it smells stuffy in here."" But you hadn't noticed? That's because our sense of smell filters out odors we already know are there. We are wired as humans to smell new odors or strong odors.   This is also true for your body odor. Most people can't smell their own odor (even if they stink) because their nose has smelled it for a while or their stink slowly crept up on them. This is why you can smell a person who needs to bathe and wonder ""can't they smell themselves?"" The answer is no, they can't!   Your friend should know that if he is smelling himself then his odor is strong enough for anyone near him to also smell him! In fact everyone  else has probably been smelling him for a while!!  Your friend should consider daily washing, be it bathing or a shower, and might also want to look into antiperspirants, which are applied to the armpits and reduce how much your friend sweats under the arms which is where most foul body odor comes from."

myfriendwantstoknow,39imtw,meye-username,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:55:37 2015 UTC,"Your friend will probably want to choose items that belong in a shower, so vaseline is out. Conditioner seems to work best for my friend, but if your friend is ever on a budget, he can buy a bottle of vegetable glycerin and add it to really cheap-ass soaps and shampoos like Suave of VO5. Glycerin is really effective against hard water and could be a useful product if your friend's skin is dry. Just add a few drops to the bottle, or just use the glycerin straight. Costs about $3-4 at Walmart, but that bottle will last for years.  My friend recommends getting some menthol baby powder for after shower, it seems to help with irritation and feels good on the taint, so he says. He applies it liberally to his wet balls and shaft and it tingles oh so right. It's especially great for trimming the balls, since his balls get sticky even if they're not shaved and just buzzed with some clippers.  My friend wants to mention that he rinses out his dick hole after a good shower jerk-off, since soap and whatever can get in there during a furious masturbation session and it can irritate/burn the next time he pees several hours later. He sometimes just takes a piss after jerking off and that works just as well."
myfriendwantstoknow,39imtw,MisunderstoodDemon,2,Sat Jun 13 03:55:34 2015 UTC,My friend says he tried conditioner and it was amazing. He says cost isn't a huge issue since he does thos only occasionally but he likes his jerk off sessions to be awesome.

myfriendwantstoknow,39c24b,SaveTheSpycrabs,13,Wed Jun 10 19:23:35 2015 UTC,"To what end? Just super horney? Or does your friend want to find intimacy and acceptance and maybe someone to be attracted to them?    Your friend should take this advice to heart: ""Know what you want and why. Then ask yourself, am I willing to put the effort in? Effort as in, letting yuorself be rejected without becoming despreate or creepy.(everyone will face some rejection or another, it's part of life) To have courage to open up to someone new, the courage to be selfconfident and outgoing.     If self asteem and confidence isn't something you think you can muster. Then try working out/getting in shape and taking care of outward apparences, not just what you think is ""cool/right/my personality"" but wearing clothes that doesn't activly try to alienate or brand yourself. (one thing to be unique/different, another is to put your personality into your clothes). Also, Get a better haircut. But you ask... isn't that extremely shallow/vain? Well, you are in highschool. Majority of all sexual encounters there will be based in 85% physical attraction.  These aren't easy things to do, so if that feels like ""stuff I already know but can't acomplish"" then aim lower. There are plenty of people who you might consider ugly, uninteresting or unattractive that might find you interesting enough to engage with. And if that feels wrong, then ask yourself, why should anyone you feel attracted to not have the right to feel that about you? And what can you do to change that? That ""beuatiful person"" will probably never ""change their mind"" but there are more people for you to fall in love with/be attracted to and if you look the part, and make some effort, the odds will get better for you.""    So if your friend tries to figure some of these things out the answers are there. But even then, there is no guarantee. If your friend want a ""clinical"" approach, ""what do I say to raise my odds"" ""how can I maximize my chances"" then send them over to /r/seduction. But remember, that's the art of getting what you want and getting other people to think it's what they want as well. It's a fast track to finding your inner asshole if that's what your friend is."

There'll be students experimenting with costume parties, pseudo-grown-ass-adult dinner parties, murder mystery dinners, whatever; plus, college students are constantly chilling in large groups doing everything from passing a bong around to playing Mario Kart without really considering it a ""party"".  Big house parties are a lot of fun, but if they don't float your boat (or even if you want a change of pace), there are plenty of other ways to socialize in college.  From your edit, it sounds like you might find yourself preferring smaller, more low-key gatherings with a tighter-knit group of friends."
myfriendwantstoknow,3992b2,pterrorgrine,23,Wed Jun 10 06:32:01 2015 UTC,"Well, there's gonna be a shitload of people, for one. Almost everyone will be drunk, obnoxious, and loud, but the vibe is generally good. Folks kinda feed off each other. You know how when you watch stand up comedy on TV, it's nowhere near as funny as watching that exact same show in person? It's kinda like that. Mostly it's gonna be too loud to hear anything inside, it's just a bunch of inhibition free people dancing around and having a good time. You'll probably walk into what you think is a bathroom, only to find a bedroom full of people passing a blunt. The people who couldn't fit in that room are by the people smoking cigs outside with another blunt.   They can be a lot of fun for sure. Don't go expecting anything in particular, just keep an open mind and relax, and don't go too overboard with your drinking. I've had to send people to the hospital at my own parties that went too hard, and no one wants that.   Know your limits, talk to everyone, and have fun.   Also don't let that hospital stuff scare you off, just don't drink till you can't stand anymore. That shit isn't common, but it can happen."

myfriendwantstoknow,3992b2,bryanreynolds,2,Wed Jun 10 03:54:14 2015 UTC,"I'm sure parties are different everywhere but I can tell you my perspective. Parties can be a lot of fun. They are great for meeting new people, talking to people you otherwise might not talk to, and even doing things you might not otherwise do. The most important thing is to be safe. Alcohol can be a lot of fun, but it isn't fun to throw up because you've had too much. I think there is a phrase ""beer before liquor, never sicker"". It basically tells you that drinking hard alcohol before drinking beer is a safer bet, but what it really boils down to is how much alcohol you drink. There is a lot of binge drinking in college, and this is why people tend to get sick more. Never be afraid to call an ambulance! Saving somebody's life is much more important than having the party go on for a bit longer. It might sound dramatic, but people at my school have died for this reason.   Once you find that limit, another thing to think about is weed. A lot of people get ""the spins"" when they smoke and drink. For me, this greatly increases the probability that I'll throw up, and it is just overall really uncomfortable. Just something to think about.   Other than that, you don't have much to worry about. Kick back, have fun, and be yourself. You have the best years of your life ahead!"
myfriendwantstoknow,3992b2,jjconner1,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:28:01 2015 UTC,"Regarding weed: OP, generally you should know how you deal with being drunk and with being high before you try both together.  I haven't really had a problem with passing a pipe around at a kegger, but I think that's mostly because I already know how to enjoy each alone without pushing my limits."
myfriendwantstoknow,3992b2,pterrorgrine,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:25:58 2015 UTC,"I've gone to a lot of parties over the years, and I'm often a designated driver or just don't feel like drinking, so I've had my share of both drunk and sober party experiences. Each party is different, but they generally have a few common features: alcohol, drugs, socializing, music, setup before the party, and cleanup after the party. I'll describe some of the social aspects to house parties, and I'll talk a little about drugs and alcohol.  Socially, parties follow a somewhat free-form model. People will cluster into groups, but the groups shift around, split off, and reform a lot, so it would be unusual to go to a party and only talk with the same few people the whole time. This can be good because it puts you in contact with a whole bunch of different people but can also be frustrating because it means that just as you get comfortable with a group, everyone wanders off in a different direction.  If you have been to the bar, you'll notice that it's kind of hard to break the ice with new people a lot of the time. At parties this is a lot easier (although you still have to make an effort). It's a more private environment, so people don't have their guard up as much as they do at the bar or in clubs. People will also have a higher opinion of you off the bat because you are obviously cool enough to be invited to the party, so first impressions are automatically going to be better than at the bar. Personally, I prefer to attend parties where I know about 2/3 of the people there. That's basically the optimum environment because there's never any awkward standing around time, but there are plenty of new people to meet when I want to.  If I don't know very many people at a party I'm going to, I try to get there early and help the host set up. The early hours before the party gets started are the easiest time to get to know people. There's just less to keep track of, and people aren't as distracted. Often, the environment is quieter. Helping out with setup gives me an easy context to socialize and is a good ""warm up."" By the time things get busy, I'm already in ""social mode,"" and I have a few people who I know I can talk to any time during the night.  On the subject of drugs and alcohol, different parties will have different standards of acceptable levels of intoxication. Weed and alcohol are very common and somewhat mild in small quantities. Even so, if you have not tried these things before, a party full of strangers is not the best context for your first time. I don't really do any drugs other than alcohol these days, and even that is not necessary to have a good time at a party, so don't feel like you HAVE to drink. I only drink at about 50% of the parties I attend. Some parties have a full spread of spirits and mixers, and most of the guests will be drunk. Some low-key parties will have drinks out for guests, but having more than one or two is in poor taste. Make sure you have a way to get home or permission to sleep on the couch before you start drinking. If you are planning to drive, don't drink any alcohol at all, not even one beer.   As far as other drugs go, I never got too involved with moly, coke, or hallucinogens. I've tried a couple of those types of things once or twice, but only in a small group of close friends, not at parties. These can be common at parties, but again, a party full of strangers is not a good place for your first time trying these things. It's also a bad idea to decide in the moment to do these things just because the opportunity arises. If you want to try them, have a plan before you even show up to a party. Make sure a friend is there who can keep track of you. Make sure you know how you're getting home. Don't drink if you are trying new drugs. These substances are no joke, and the decision to try them should not be made lightly. Do your research on erowid and talk to people who have used them before trying any new drugs.  Oh and there may be lots of sexy people at the parties who will want to meet you, so bathe, dress well, and groom yourself beforehand. Clip those finger nails!"

I learned that people simply dont give a shit so you can kinda ""be"" whoever you want as long as its not intimidating/intruding on their private space. Of course this is meant to be taken with a grain of salt. Try relaxing, maybe meditating or something; meeting new people is exciting, scary, awful, wonderful. Don't worry.   Just be yourself! And while that is a very cliche thing to say (it never helped me before I realized what it really meant), its true.  You don't have to overanalyze or overthink things, that was what caused problems for me. I always tried to display my ""best"" side while socializing which led to me overanalyzing and freezing. I used to be super shy. I'm still shy, but whatever.   Life is so long and so amazing, don't let social anxiety make you miss out on it!  edit: I meant your friend"
myfriendwantstoknow,3992b2,GamleSeg,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:49:46 2015 UTC,"It depends on the type of party. Typically you'll find alcohol there, oftentimes other drugs as well. ""Party"" can mean whatever you want it to mean. For instance, I'm going to a 4th of July party involving an entire neighborhood, but last Saturday I went with 4 friends and bowled, drank beer, then went back to someone's house and drank more beer and played Mario party. Both of these are parties, they're just different. One thing you'll find is that alcohol is usually present because it helps people loosen up. Drunk people make easy friends because anxiety disappears. If drinking isn't your thing, that's fine. An easy way to make friends is to offer to DD for someone. But just don't be afraid to talk to people - anyone, about anything. That's why people are there! To talk to people. I used to be very socially anxious and as a result wasn't too much fun at parties. It wasn't until I got past my social anxiety that I started to enjoy them. Realize that no one is judging you the way you're judging you. They want to have a good time the same as you."
myfriendwantstoknow,3992b2,bigDean636,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:10:47 2015 UTC,"My 19 year old friend just finished his freshman year at college. He says that it's a good idea to have drank before college, but it's not the end of the world if your friend hasn't. Drinking allows him to open up to people, but it won't necessarily in your friends case. Tell your friend to count his liquor... for my 5'10, 220 friend, 8 shots in an hour and a half is enough to be drunk and having a good time, but 16 was blackout drunk, and not a good time.  If your friend is offered weed or other drugs, tell him to do what he feels is best. Weed isn't the evil it's made out to be, mushrooms are a fun time (but they're better taken at about noon on a sunny weekend day, for full enjoyment), and acid is a bit extreme. Weed is easily the most bountiful of these, and easiest to come by and purchase.   If your friend ever gets caught, depending on what university he goes to, it's better to be caught by campus police with drugs and alcohol than regular police; my friends roommate got caught with weed in his room, enough that he could be jailed, but the campus cops only confiscated it and set him up with a $150 diversion program, as opposed to $800 in tickets and jail time.

Most of what I have read was from a historical point of view, so if your friend is interested in practising ""black magyckes"" or something I have no idea. None of it is consistent and a lot of it is just standard hippie shit reskinned to be about black magic.   If you're interested in history though, read about John Dee.

Then it is easy (but they may notice something fucky is going on)  You may still be able to figure out who they are using some form of timing correlation. You know exactly when they make a request, and you know exactly when a post or comment was made(down to the second, but don't forget reddit itself has delays)  If you can figure out which requests are actually comments instead of just a page load, that makes it easier. What you do is look at every single comment posted around the time reddit replies to a comment POST. Make a list of all the comments, and repeat. Eventually you can narrow it down to one person.  Not sure if this would actually work, though. I have wireshark and I'm using HTTPS so I'll try to see what you can learn from the traffic."

There are also zoning laws that restrict the installation of certain residential amenities, like showers and full kitchens.   That's not to say there isn't a long and noble tradition of people doing exactly what you're describing: cobbling together a living space out of a commercial space or industrial loft. However, they usually require a significant investment in remodeling space that the tenant doesn't even own, so that may cut into your cost of living if you don't plan on staying awhile. Many states have provisions to get a space rezoned into an artists live-work space. That's probably your best bet if you plan to proceed with this."

He had to go to the town hall to request IP info, bring that to Craigslist and ask if they could give him the info.  Craigslist puts a 5-7 day limit on how long they store the IP address and the town hall takes like 5 days to get you the info, so it's basically like Craigslist knows you can't do it in time so it covers their butt.

myfriendwantstoknow,393nfw,StacksOfBudahhh,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:56:20 2015 UTC,"What would you recommend he do? He figures anything he tries will just make it awkward since she probably hasn't thought about him much in that time and they left on fairly good terms. He feels like sending her a facebook message saying that he loves her would be  weird because he really doesn't feel that way any more about her(or at least he thought he didn't. He shouldn't at least) and because she has probably met other more attractive and probably better in general guys in this time and likely hasn't even thought about my friend much. Seriously though I have no idea why he randomly got so emotional the other night. He never dated this girl and it's not like he has any reason to be particularly attached to her so it just seems weird that my normally emotionally strong friend started crying a little over something like this.   And it's not like he's been thinking of this girl a lot either. He has been focused on work and school so much he hasn't really had time.  Personally I think he might have just been sad about loneliness in general and the feeling of regret that he missed out on the best opportunity he had in recent times for an actual relationship and that said opportunity was a fucking year ago pushed him over the edge. He really doesn't seem that upset talking to me about it now, he's more just feeling like a weirdo because he got that emotional. He says one of his main concerns is that he's being obsessive or something for thinking about this girl who showed slight affection towards him a year ago. He is very self consious about seeming creepy or obsessive towards women even though most of his friends are girls and I know he's not like that at all.   By the way this is actually the all about the OP and I don't have some sort of multiple personality shit going on. I just like the idea of getting into the ""friend asking for advice"" thing. I just want to make that clear because as said previously I have some sort of terrible fear of seeming like some sort of stalker or pervert even though I'm not so I just want to be fully clear. Now I realize that my very saying this sort of implicates me in the way of ""thou dost protest too much"" but I am just leaving this in as I write it because this is a major throwaway account and it feels good to write about this shit."

I had it financed at a local credit union. The person buying it wanted to finance it as well, so I told him the name of the credit union I went through. He went in and applied for a loan. Once he was approved, I rode the bike over there, signed some papers and handed him the keys. Simple as that.   If the buyer has cash, have him meet you at the bank where you financed it through, and they will do something similar to what I mentioned above.   If they want to finance through their own bank, not yours, their bank while likely cut them a check which you can bring to your bank, and they will all handle the paperwork once you give them the cash, and once you are in the clear, toss them the keys and be on your way."

Everywhere has CCTV these days, so forget about using the card in person unless there's an elaborate disguise being worn. If there is any suspicion on your friend the bank will follow the CCTV trail and blacklist your friend once they've been charged, ie: it would be a high risk for the bank to take on your friend as a client at their bank so it might be impossible to have a bank account from then on.  If your friend reports their wallet as missing to the police, the police will be considering if there's a chance of fraud going on. It will be very suspicious if the wallet is being reported but the owner hasn't cancelled their cards already, which will be known by the time on the various reports. If your friends accomplices are found, everyone will be in serious trouble. Banks don't like being defrauded, and the police don't like being made to look like fools."

There's a reason banks take so much personal information when one opens a new bank account.  If you are considering advising your friend to open a new bank account, one would need to be in the third world country to open the it otherwise there would be a trail via Internet, however many proxies you think your friend could use.   The scheme that your friend is proposing has already been carried out by thousands of people before them, and banks are wise to it.

myfriendwantstoknow,38ksig,scabesdistributor,10,Thu Jun 4 22:42:51 2015 UTC,"Definitely get checked. If she's not comfortable, she doesn't have to tell the doctor why. Like not deny an explanation either but just say you wanna know if you got an STD is all. They'll ask questions about which to test for, just pick everything. They might ask about her sex life in very general terms. Even if it's like ""oh some months ago"" it's still fine, I mean you can get tested if there's not even a remote chance for an STD. Better to be safe than sorry. It'll most likely come back negative but if it doesn't she'll be glad she did it."
myfriendwantstoknow,38ksig,feared_rear_admiral,9,Fri Jun 5 02:50:00 2015 UTC,I think it is important not to lie to the doctor in case there is a test that takes awhile to show or something.  They are bound by HIPAA for a reason.
myfriendwantstoknow,38ksig,Codeshark,2,Fri Jun 5 12:09:09 2015 UTC,"Is this in the US? I don't know what HIPAA is sorry.  But yeah generally you shouldn't lie but what I'm saying is you don't have to give out every little detail you don't want to. Like just give a very general answer that isn't a lie but it's so vague that it could apply to anything. Usually it's something like ""have you had sex at some point in the last three months"" or ""how long has it been since your last sexual encounter"" and then you just say that, count OP's encounter as a sexual one and leave it at that.  I can only speak from my own experience when I had tests done, of my own volition and without any real concerns (in Australia). Sometimes they didn't ask anything but were like ""yep no problemo so we take blood from you and do these tests and we'll call you when we have the results for you to pick up"" or asked very general questions like I stated. I felt there was a lot of room in those that even if something had come up bad I could have filled in the story without a problem.  Mind you I would imagine that doctors are aware that women in particular can be very disoriented and just plain uncomfortable even if they had been raped, and might not even want to divulge that detail. At any rate I don't think it's the doctor's role to pressure the client too much into spilling the beans if they're not comfortable but should by all means help by establishing trust and encouraging her."
myfriendwantstoknow,38ksig,feared_rear_admiral,5,Fri Jun 5 14:22:22 2015 UTC,"HIPPA is the Health Insurance Portability and Privacy Act.  Basically, if you tell your doctor something they can't just turn around and tell everyone else.  They can't even tell the cops in most cases.  These cases where they have to are times when you say you've thought about hurting yourself or others, domestic abuse, and child endangerment.  But if you tell the doctor ""I was sexually assaulted and I just want to get checked,"" they can ask you if you want to talk to the police and press charges but they can't take that information and do anything with it unless you consent."

myfriendwantstoknow,38ipk4,autowikibot,21,Thu Jun 4 15:16:07 2015 UTC,"So what you have is a ""Legal Threat"" (similar to a Cease and Desist) notice, specifically one requesting payment or else they'll file a lawsuit. You don't have an open lawsuit against you and there haven't been any police/criminal charges.   Honestly, I would have ignored the initial notice, but since you've already paid out once here's what I think. (And I do have personal experience with a similar matter)   You don't list your age, if you're under 18 there's a few things at play. If they contacted you directly they are unable to enter any type of legal agreement with you. It was illegal for them to contact a minor and attempt a legally binding agreement. You will want to have your parents contact a copyright-focused lawyer immediately who should easily be able to have everything dropped. I forget the term off the top of my head, but it's effectively a separation agreement where both parties agree no further action will be taken. In your case, this would have been beneficial/necessary after the first payment was sent so they would not continue to pursue further legal action. If you're over 18, and since you already paid once the company now knows that:   a. You have money  b. You actually exist  c. You didn't dispute the downloads   Again, assuming you're in the US, I'd at least seek an initial consultation with a copyright focused lawyer to have not necessarily a settlement, but that same agreement for both parties to stop further legal action based on your settlement of the already paid amount. I'm going to search to find the term to update the post.  The top post suggesting they're related to a government entity? I have no idea what they're talking about. The RIAA is not a government entity, all the other legal battles for copyright infringement weren't from government entitites.   Regarding settling per song, they're wrong there again too. I'm guessing they're too young to remember all the fun back in Napster/KaZaA/etc days where people were having lawsuits for downloading music. Here's just an example (first hit on Google for RIAA sues per song)  https://www.eff.org/wp/riaa-v-people-five-years-later  or this one, where they sued for $22.5k per song  http://www.wired.com/2011/04/tenenbaum-appeal/  edit  And to add, you could probably get away with just ignoring them. But they're going to harass you. It's not worth their time/effort to sue for $20 here and there, but if they can get an easy $20 they're going to do it. You gave them an easy $20.   edit2 Found it - the term is Mutual Release and Covenant Not to Sue - IANAL but am fairly certain this is the agreement you want."

Before that, all they had was an IP, and would have had to go through court proceedings to get her info.

myfriendwantstoknow,38ipk4,chubbysumo,2,Thu Jun 4 17:17:33 2015 UTC,"Well.  My friend wants your friend to know that they got served with a similar notice requesting thousands of dollars.  It turned out that this person requesting the money made this request without the knowledge of the actual copyright owner, and eventually the lawyer leading this effort was disbarred.    That said.  It would really really suck if this company actually decided to sue you.  My friend contacted a lawyer they found on eff.org's website.  This person did not give a free consult, the consult cost a few hundred dollars but it was definitely worth it.  Some of those free consult lawyers want thousands as a 'flat fee' to help you.  I recommend you find an honest lawyer to represent you if this escalates, and maybe consult with them sooner than later.  If they dealt with something similar in the past, they can give you an idea of whether or not it makes sense to pay these guys or not.  good luck. and don't panic.  Think carefully before paying anyone in this situation."
myfriendwantstoknow,38ipk4,geeeeoffff,2,Thu Jun 4 22:24:26 2015 UTC,"No. Don't pay anything else until you get served with an actual lawsuit (you'll know the difference).  Edit: the way the law works is that if someone wants to sue you, as you're afraid someone might do here, they're not entitled to any money until they prove to the court that they are. What that means is that you don't owe anyone shit (at least in this context) until the court says you are. If they're trying to negotiate with you in lieu of an actual judgement ordering you to pay X amount of money, you're better off waiting until they start a lawsuit and getting your settlement approved by the court/on the record. Otherwise you're paying them money for no reason.   EDIT EDIT: What I just said applies assuming that this is NOT a scam."

The rare cases he gets a notification from his ISP, he just ignores them. Never once has he gotten more than a notification from his ISP. From what he has noticed, they normally come in 2 separate  formats. The first is, ""Pay us money to settle the claim outside of court."" These are most often nothing more than scams, and even when they are done by legitimate companies, they have never followed up on an ignored message. The other kind, which seems way more official and less likely a scam, is a simple C&D from the company or firm representing the company. My friend ignores these as well. In fact, one time my friend pirated 6 episodes of Jon Oliver's show and received 6 copyright notices from his ISP a few days later, luckily all neatly organized into one email he could ignore."

At the time, he didn’t notice the smell, but he’s since learned that there was a faint yet obvious odor. For the sake of everyone who walks by his room, your friend needs to make sure that whatever he chooses to clean up with—towels, washcloths, underwear, paper towels, tissues, junk mail (terrible idea) is disposed of or washed daily. My friend strongly recommends that your friend ejaculate into his hands or onto his stomach—he says that having to worry about coming into a tissue takes too much effort and often leads to ripped tissues—and that you clean up afterwards with tissues, which you should flush down the toilet when you wash your hands."

myfriendwantstoknow,38f2a1,tofugoddesss,19,Wed Jun 3 20:03:48 2015 UTC,"Debt does not ""snowball"" in this case. In otherwords, your friends's $118 bill won't become some crazy $1,000 bill in a few years. That said, they, Vodafone, may have added on late charges. But from what your friend is saying, sounds like the $118 probably includes any late charges. When Vodafone sold the debt to the collector, the collector most likely cannot collect for anything more than the $118. I say ""most likely,"" because I'm familiar with US debt collection, not Australian debt collection. But I imagine the laws are similar in this regard.  The important thing here is how it affects your friends credit rating. Since your friend is a US citizen, I'm unsure how the reporting works. That said, Vodafone is an international corporation. And so are the major credit bureaus here in the States.   But because it's been nearly a year, any damage that could have been done to your friend's credit rating, has already been done. Paying off the debt doesn't ""fix"" that.   And the collector that purchased the debt most likely bought it from Vodafone for pennies on the dollar. Vodafone has already written off that debt. It's still a valid debt, but paying the full amount represents quite a profit for the collector.  Additionally, the debt is so small, that no company is going to go to any extreme lengths to get it. No one is going to sue your friend for $118. The cost to do so would be so far above the amount you owe.  You friend should consider pulling their free annual credit reports (you've seen the commercials) and seeing if any of this has affected the reports.  Lastly, if it bothers your friend that they have an unpaid debt, they should just pay it. They can even settle with the collector; offer to pay...say $60 instead of the full $118 or whatever. Up to your friend."

If they're just paying it for ethical reasons, why not send Vodaphone whatever they can afford every month or so until the whole $118 is paid?"
myfriendwantstoknow,38f2a1,TextofReason,21,Wed Jun 3 22:24:29 2015 UTC,"The collector purchases the debt from the company. The person no longer owes Vodaphone anything, they owe the collector."

myfriendwantstoknow,38f2a1,TextofReason,5,Thu Jun 4 03:49:56 2015 UTC,"The commitment has been completed, obligations have been met with Vodaphone. Vodaphone wanted money, they got it. If someone I owe 5 dollars to gets a notary to sign a paper saying the debt is transferred to someone else, that's their call. If I kept trying to give the first person money they don't want or already have, that's illogical because I don't owe them anymore, I owe someone else. Having a guilty conscience doesn't make sense for this, your conscience should be guilty to the collector that's now out money because of you, not the phone company that isn't."

Exactly! And out of your control. So you might feel obligated to honor your original debt, but not consider the sale of that debt by Creditor to be any concern of yours, any more than if Creditor changes  tooth designers. All you know is that you promised to pay Creditor $118, and $118 is what you'll pay, and Creditor is to whom you'll pay it."
myfriendwantstoknow,38f2a1,TextofReason,9,Thu Jun 4 04:07:50 2015 UTC,"Nononono, I mean you're obligated to pay them because you owe them, you aren't morally obligated to pay them specifically. You're obligated to pay whoever you owe, which is no longer the original company."
myfriendwantstoknow,38f2a1,kwertyuiop,-2,Thu Jun 4 04:13:31 2015 UTC,"Well, since it's Vodaphone who made the deal with the collector, it would be up to them to pass the $118 along, if Friend sends it to them.  Anyway, if it were $118K, we couldn't have this conversation. I mean, we could, but the actual events and consequences would get in the way.  How Friend felt, or his conscience, ethics, all that, would be irrelevant. But, since it's $118, there are no consequences, unless you count the credit report thing (which would be an interesting tangent, as those have become so powerful that they're hitting diminishing returns with the economic transition, as their credit score becomes the least of worries for increasing numbers of people).  As it is, there's no way that a collector in AU with nothing but an email address, which may or may not be active, for somebody in the US, can hope to collect even 18 cents.  So the only reason for Friend to pay anybody anything are these intangible concepts, of guilt and ethics and conscience. And in THAT realm, Friend gets to make the rules."
myfriendwantstoknow,38f2a1,TextofReason,10,Thu Jun 4 04:29:55 2015 UTC,"Generally when a company says ""turning over to collections,"" that means the company has sold the debt to a collection agency. At this point, sending a check(s) to Vodafone doesn't satisfy the debt.  In regards to the ethical question, sometimes paying something is better than paying nothing. I mean, clearly the OP's friend is only somewhat concerned with this debt. Enough to ask the question, but not enough to just pay off just over $100 that's been sitting there for over a year."

myfriendwantstoknow,38f2a1,TextofReason,3,Thu Jun 4 02:39:10 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, as they should be.  I've been through the debt collection process. I've had debt charged off, settled debt, paid some off completely, and have a couple others still hanging out there. Sure, I signed contracts that legally obligated me to paying back those debts. But the situation changed and I found myself unable to do so. If I were to pay back all that debt in full because of honor or whatever, there's a high, practically certain chance I'd find myself back in the situation that led me to nonpayment in the first place.  The contracts I signed with the banks are business deals. They took a risk and I took a risk. These business deals just didn't work out, which is something that happens frequently in business. That's all. They cut their losses and I cut my losses. We move on.  While it may be ethical to pay back the debt in full, I think it'll illogical to do so if paying it back would worsen your situation significantly. Furthermore, if other people's lives depend on me, then I consider it unethical for me to worsen my dependents' situation in order to ""right"" my personal situation.  Food for thought."
myfriendwantstoknow,38f2a1,gioraffe32,2,Thu Jun 4 04:21:23 2015 UTC,"It is, and fwiw, I agree, it would be wrong to harm innocent parties simply to ease your conscience.  Some more chewy thought, when creditors know there's a ""high, practically certain chance"" you won't be able to pay the debt, and they know this, at least in part, because this is their business and they know more about what's going on in the economy than you, an humble tooth designer or whatever, and that they will end up selling the debt to their brother in law the collector, then we must question their ethics in lending you such a large sum to begin with...."

Chances are it is with my company as I do know we purchase Vodafone accounts.   Basically when those with debt are overseas, we can outsource the matters to collection agencies within that country, of no cost to us, and usually it is in bulk loads. So, they can then collect based on the laws of that country and perform there own ""skip trace"" with the tools available in that country. In the USA it is MUCH easier to track someone than it is in Australia. If you're worried about having it outsourced, simply contact the collection company in Australia and negotiate. When debtors are willing to address the issue they are often very happy to negotiate favorably rather than look at legal enforcement options."

myfriendwantstoknow,3847yx,byronite,18,Fri Jun 12 11:35:21 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: So long as both partners have similar maturity levels, there is no position of trust (e.g. coach, tutor, prefect, etc.) and there is full consent to sexual intercourse, he will not be prosecuted.  Provided these conditions are met, I say go for it. By if at any moment either partner wants to stop, then stop immediately.  (This goes for people of all ages, by the way.)  In England and Wales: ""It is an offence for anyone to have any sexual activity with a person under the age of 16. However, Home Office guidance is clear that there is no intention to prosecute teenagers under the age of 16 where both mutually agree and where they are of a similar age.""  In Scotland, ""sexual intercourse between young people aged 13–15 are offences, even if both partners consent.""  I cannot find any info about close-in-age defences, but I suspect that any prosecutor would determine that pursuing charges is not in the public interest.  In Northern Ireland, ""the Sexual Offences Order 2008 introduced a series of laws to protect children under 16 from abuse. However, the law is not intended to prosecute mutually agreed teenage sexual activity between two young people of a similar age, unless it involves abuse or exploitation.""

Further, I am not in the UK and am unfamiliar with any ""Romeo and Juliet"" caveats they may have, if any. The easiest answer to the question is: wait is out. The harder answer is: consult a lawyer. The dangerous answer is: do what you want, but be aware there may be consequences.   Also, you shouldn't tell OP to fuck his friend's girlfriend. That's definitely asking for trouble. ;)"

By that same logic, nobody should ever have a one night stand because a girl can accuse you of rape and ruin your life.

This is of course if he doesn't want to use a VPN etc. Just an alternative.  I have been warned by Comcast 3 times being stupid (drunk) and not using protection, but I don't torrent anymore.

Additionally, most states have a minimum age for any and all sexual activity.

Google is a search engine for the web in general, information like email addresses are typically kept in databases. Google doesn't exactly go out of it's way to search and keep databases up to date, so it's not the best tool in these instances."

You can find any domains registered under an email without whois privacy.  You can add people on Skype.  You can attempt to reset passwords etc on the email.  You could do a who.is on the domain if it's a custom email.  You can take the bit before the @ and search for it and maybe find usernames matching.  You could add it to spam directories.  ...etc
myfriendwantstoknow,37tzt3,ThraShErDDoS,2,Sat May 30 16:17:44 2015 UTC,Depends where they have used the email and what permissions were given.

Applying lots of constant pressure to the tissue of an engorged penis has the potential to cause blood to enter and become trapped inside the tissue, further constricting blood vessels that allow blood to flow in and out of the penis, aka priapism (you know those commercials ""if you experience an erection lasting more than 4 hours contact your physician""). Please trust me when I tell you that you do not want any of the treatments for priapism. The first treatment is ice packs on the penis, then a shot right in the flesh of the penis.

myfriendwantstoknow,37hywm,ChuckNorrisWithEbola,6,Wed May 27 20:44:31 2015 UTC,Call number. Leave message.  Set time.  Show up at appointed time with agreed upon amount of money.  If you need help past that point you are wasting your money on escorts and need to see a sex therapist.
myfriendwantstoknow,37hywm,TurnPunchKick,4,Wed May 27 20:49:11 2015 UTC,Nice. My friend will be please to know this.
myfriendwantstoknow,37hywm,Bonerlander,6,Wed May 27 21:18:44 2015 UTC,"Your friend should look around for a review board for his area such as theeroticreview.com a search via Google should find a local one for your friends. Your friend probably wants to go to a reviewed one for his first time to assure service, price, quality and to avoid law enforcement if that is a concern in your area."
myfriendwantstoknow,37hywm,PrivateStaticBool,8,Thu May 28 04:08:46 2015 UTC,"As others have said, sex. I think they have to advertise as 'escorts' for legal reasons, because on paper, an escort is supposed to just hang out with you. If sex happens then that is 'off her working hours'"
myfriendwantstoknow,37hywm,JTB4MOD,4,Wed May 27 22:06:20 2015 UTC,"It is legal in Holland, Germany, Austria, Greece, Turkey, Hungary and Latvia.  Most other countries turn a blind eye to 'escorting', as there is a loophole they exploit by stating in their ads they only charge for time spent, what goes on in that time is between consenting adults (ie; not explicitly advertising sex)"
myfriendwantstoknow,37hywm,prezuiwf,9,Wed May 27 23:08:24 2015 UTC,"Sex, at least, is virtually always implied. If you have more specific tastes, you should discuss them with her beforehand and make sure you're both on the same page.  Edit: I mean your friend should."
myfriendwantstoknow,37hywm,UzukiSeed,7,Wed May 27 20:44:27 2015 UTC,Is it guaranteed though? Can it happen that my friend goes expecting sex and they refuse (because they never truly agreed to it)?
myfriendwantstoknow,37hywm,Nowhere_Man_Forever,11,Wed May 27 23:02:58 2015 UTC,I don't think they would be in business as an escort very long if they weren't delivering on the implicit agreement. Word gets around quickly and those who deliver get paid.
myfriendwantstoknow,37e7t4,nubfilter,42,Tue May 26 23:56:16 2015 UTC,"First of all, that's a pretty long ride in rush hour if it equals a blowjob.  But, your friend should probably reconsider asking people whom he thinks will call the police on him for blowjobs."

myfriendwantstoknow,37e7t4,keenansmith61,6,Wed May 27 06:46:53 2015 UTC,This is true. You'd need to check your state laws on whether you need a permit to produce professional porn
myfriendwantstoknow,37e7t4,Aubear11885,5,Wed May 27 14:22:28 2015 UTC,It's only legal to produce porn in very select places in the U.S. That's why the majority of porn is produced in the San Fernando Valley.

myfriendwantstoknow,37e7t4,minertastic,13,Wed May 27 02:53:08 2015 UTC,"I am always weary. I tried to sleep more. But it doesn't help. Coffee takes the edge off, but then I am still weary and now I can't sleep. Maybe a BJ would do the trick. Hey OP, can you help me out?"
myfriendwantstoknow,37e7t4,ntermation,18,Wed May 27 08:36:29 2015 UTC,"I think your friend is not only looking at legal ramifications but social and ethical as well. Many people would see this offer as sexually aggressive or even sexual assault. The ability for someone to say no might not justify the question in many circumstances. When at a bar saying no is easy as you aren't losing anything, saying no to this kind of repayment is much more complex as they aren't just saying no to the bj but are being forced to retract the request for assistance.  I am sure your friend would not ask in this situation but by exaggerating the point I think it might be clearer.  ""Hey john, I really need your help. I broke my ankle and need a lift to a hospital!""  ""oh sure, lets go! Just I will expect a beej""  You can see here that just simply saying no would have major repercussions. So even if the idea isn't technically prostitution it may very well be sexual assault or sexual exploitation.  Edit: Autocorrect"
myfriendwantstoknow,37e7t4,Ttoctam,1 point,Wed May 27 01:08:51 2015 UTC,"Even if someone broke their ankle, you are not obligated to help them and can still say no, you'll be a shitty friend but it's up to you to help them or not. The same goes for any other favour they might ask for. And favours don't have to be given with nothing in return, that's why sometimes people offer to pay for gas when you give them a ride somewhere."
myfriendwantstoknow,37e7t4,thename226,2,Wed May 27 15:00:23 2015 UTC,"My friend wants to clarify, because your post seems like the most non judgemental. He doesn't think it's right to do this in a ""my ankle is broken and I need to go to the hospital"" scenario, more like ""I feel like going to the bar and I could probably get a ride or a taxi but I'm asking you because i'm too cheap to pay $5 for a cab when I could buy another beer with that"" scenario, which, I think, removes the ""coersion"" aspect of it but MFINAL(my friend is not a lawyer)"
myfriendwantstoknow,37e7t4,Ttoctam,9,Wed May 27 03:10:48 2015 UTC,A court (and a LOT of society) would still see it as the same issue. Its not just about severity of the action but the ethical dilemma of the action itself. If your friend was trying to do this in a more moral/legal way he would have to make the been a suggestion for repayment not a requirement. But even then its a dicey issue.  Also a lot of women (or men) when asked this will not respond with positivity. Asking for sexual favours requires either a large level of trust or a mutual level of understanding and status in a relationship. One could ask a lover to do the favour/bj trade because there is a level of trust there. One could hit on women in bars because you are assuming a a relationship with a level of equality. But to ask someone that is offering their trust to you to do it would in a pretty serious way betray that trust.
myfriendwantstoknow,37e7t4,Ttoctam,5,Wed May 27 03:26:12 2015 UTC,"Two comments because mobile is weird  It is safer both legally and socially to not try this or if your friend is really really keen, only try with someone you have discussed the concept with previously and thoroughly.  But to give my opinion on this: Fun with an SO, fairly creepy with anyone else."
myfriendwantstoknow,37e7t4,uhlmax,5,Wed May 27 03:29:26 2015 UTC,For a $5 cab ride... You could just walk and burn off the calories of that beer.
myfriendwantstoknow,37e7t4,JustJonny,3,Wed May 27 05:34:48 2015 UTC,Burn off the calories of a beer by walking a distance that a cab will take you for $5?  You're either thinking of a very low calorie beer or a very cheap cab ride.
myfriendwantstoknow,37e7t4,uhlmax,2,Wed May 27 15:52:24 2015 UTC,OP was the one with the $5 cab. I can't go more than like half a mile in a cab where I live.
myfriendwantstoknow,37e7t4,bigDean636,3,Thu May 28 04:07:18 2015 UTC,"I am not a lawyer.  I think you could make a case for sexual coercion, and an easy case for sexual harassment. You are asking for a sexual favor which (presumably, from what you wrote) would not be normal in the context of your relationship, and you are asking for it in exchange for something else. For clarity, if this was in the context of an ongoing sexual relationship with someone else, you could easily make the case that this was not really an exchange, but rather this person was performing oral because they have a sexual relationship with you. Without that context, however, it's clear you are attempting to coerce them into doing something sexual.   A good lawyer I would imagine could get this argued down to sexual harassment (which it certainly is). At the very least, this will destroy your friendship with this person. As a rule of thumb, never exchange anything for sex. And never, ever, expect it in return for something. You can always just say no when your friend asks you for a ride."
myfriendwantstoknow,37e7t4,the_singular_anyone,2,Wed May 27 15:06:23 2015 UTC,"If the individual in question is unreceptive, it's absolutely sexual harassment, even to ""just ask"".

myfriendwantstoknow,37epoo,mydadlivesonashelf,9,Wed May 27 02:12:22 2015 UTC,If your friend is THAT concerned. They should get a po box at the local post office and have it mailed there.

Actually, because it was delivered so quickly I just cancelled the PO Box after I got my package and got most of my money back. Additionally, if a package doesn't fit in a mailbox they'll hold it at the post office for you so it might be a good idea to get a smaller post box (but you should ask first)."

myfriendwantstoknow,37epoo,bigDean636,2,Wed May 27 15:16:05 2015 UTC,"Right, but that might be a bit of a risk.  Perhaps your friend could let it be known that several Amazon packages are coming and hide the vibrator among them.  What about sex-shops?  Not 18?"

In those cases it pays to have a second address to post to - be it work, a friends, po box or collection point (amazon has collection points for packages for those who aren't home all the time to accept a delivery)  Another alternate solution is not to buy the item from amazon, but instead a shop... It's embarrassing sure, but it's the easiest solution. Failing that, there are pubs out there that sell them in vending machines in some countries if you don't want to deal with people."

myfriendwantstoknow,37be69,chaz345,2,Tue May 26 18:34:34 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking a keylogger will simply record all keystrokes and mouse movements with timestamps in a .txt file. It will then either save this information locally, or it can be set up to send the information to another location through LAN or even through an email client, depending on which one you use. Generally, keyloggers once installed are very hard to find unless you know what you're looking for, but it may VERY well show up on a anti-virus scan, so make sure to add it to exceptions list if you want it to stay put. Even if someone finds a keylogger on their computer, tracing it to a particular person is impossible unless you set it up to forward info to your personal email or just sign your name on it.

myfriendwantstoknow,3718v7,ghostsinmypantry,2,Sat May 23 23:30:26 2015 UTC,"I take it your friend is worried that he's a pervert because he simultaneously has sexual and familial feelings for this girl, so it's incesty. Personally I think your friend's mind is in a tug of war, he's being socialized to think of her as a sister and consciously does that but they are not actually related, so no matter how close they are it's likely that a mild attraction would remain.   They're not actually family, so he's never going to feel repulsed by the idea of being romantically involved with her, unlike blood siblings.   Let's entertain the worst case scenario for a moment: your friend is aroused by the perceived incest/taboo (I think that's what he's afraid of?). If he's not harming anyone, getting turned on by something or having a fantasy, even if it's immoral, isn't a huge deal unless it causes him distress. There are whole sections of Literotica dedicated to that type of thing.  If your friend were to become involved with this younger girl - hypothetically, I understand that he's not acting on this or planning to - he'd be more of a douchebag than a pervert. She's close to being an adult, and the age difference isn't significant.   If he's attracted to her, he's attracted to her. I think your friend is confusing what is inappropriate with what is unnatural. His feelings are inappropriate in the situation but unlike real incest they aren't inherently wrong, there's an important difference.   Anyways, the fact that your friend is getting so worked up over this shows that he has a conscience. The more he fixates on this the more anxious he'll become. He needs to focus on whatever problems are in his relationship, and if he finds himself admiring the younger sister that's fine, he can just appreciate her for a moment or two and then dismiss the thought as he would if she were a stranger passing in the street."

myfriendwantstoknow,36tqgu,autowikibot,3,Fri May 22 18:38:40 2015 UTC,"Inconel:       Inconel is a family of austenite nickel-chromium-based superalloys.  The name is a trademark of Special Metals Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Precision Castparts Corp.  Inconel alloys are oxidation and corrosion resistant materials well suited for service in extreme environments subjected to pressure and heat. When heated, Inconel forms a thick, stable, passivating oxide layer protecting the surface from further attack. Inconel retains strength over a wide temperature range, attractive for high temperature applications where aluminum and steel would succumb to creep as a result of thermally induced crystal vacancies. Inconel’s high temperature strength is developed by solid solution strengthening or precipitation strengthening, depending on the alloy. In age hardening or precipitation strengthening varieties, alloying additions of aluminum and titanium combine with nickel to form the intermetallic compound Ni3(Ti,Al) or gamma prime (γ’). Gamma prime forms small cubic crystals that inhibit slip and creep effectively at elevated temperatures.  Inconel alloys are typically used in high temperature applications. It is sometimes referred to in English as ""Inco"" (or occasionally ""Iconel""). Common trade names for Inconel Alloy 625 include: Inconel 625, Chronin 625, Altemp 625, Haynes 625, Nickelvac 625 and Nicrofer 6020.

myfriendwantstoknow,36qqw0,Nowhere_Man_Forever,7,Thu May 21 14:05:29 2015 UTC,"Even if it is copyrighted, wouldn't the process of changing it make it fair use?"
myfriendwantstoknow,36qqw0,iRaphael,11,Thu May 21 14:08:58 2015 UTC,"No, copyright generally doesn't work that way. Derivative works are usually protected.  Fair use is about small samples being used for education or discussion about a work. Using something for entirely business purposes (and I think it could be argued that a logo is a business purpose) does not fall under fair use."
myfriendwantstoknow,36qqw0,MemeInBlack,5,Thu May 21 14:34:58 2015 UTC,"This is a vast oversimplification of fair use, and every single one of your generalizations is incorrect (except about derivative works, but that still wouldn't control the analysis). Using a VCR to record a movie for private home viewing is fair use. Copying MP3 files from a hard drive onto a portable MP3 player is fair use. Copying television broadcasts to transmit them on a TV that doesn't have a cable box is fair use. None of those have to do with education or discussion. And all of those dealt with copying works in their entirety. Not to mention there was a case where a magazine copied less than 15% of Gerald Ford's memoir prior to the publication (ie they took only a small portion) and they were held liable for infringement because the usurped the author's right of first publication. The fact that they only took a little didn't matter for fair use, since they also took the very heart of the work.   And just because you have a commercial/business purpose doesn't mean it's automatically an unfair use. It cuts heavily against it, but SCOTUS itself has said that no one factor is dispositive. And there have been many cases where a commercial purpose was found, but the use was still fair.  I can't believe you're getting upvotes. You don't even address the fact that this might be a transformative use of the work, which typically overrides any commercial purpose behind the use (2LiveCrew got sued for this and won). Honestly, you should edit your response and let people know you don't have nearly enough knowledge on the subject to present an educated opinion."

The female TSA agent had a wand and I just mentioned I had nipple piercings. She smirked but let me go. Slightly embarrassing but you'll likely never see them again so really there's no harm. It wasn't anything unusual and my traveling companions had no idea what transpired - it just looked like a quick extra detailed screening. Your friend shouldn't worry too much."

myfriendwantstoknow,36n9zu,Kellbelll,3,Wed May 20 17:56:40 2015 UTC,"Metel detectors well usually detect the presence of all metel on a persons body. However, it is the amount and density of the metel that well set the alarm off. For sure, the screener detects the presence of metel but usually piercings and underwires alone well not cause an alarm but it is a good practice to remove all other sources before hand which includes shoes, watches, belt buckles etc. Also, if the screener does get an alarm he or she is obliged to identify the source which which is not always obvious and may include a hand held sweep or further investigation in private. Little note of interest condom wrappers well sound a hand held alarm so guys and girls please put them in your luggage if you don't want to have to show them to the agent in public. Lastly, and this is very important, contrary to popular belief most screeners, if not all, are not out to ruin your trip and it is not a big thrill to provide extra security measures to clear you. So please cut them a break and not show up to the airport weighed down with every piece of jewlery you own."

Like it takes practice to get good at something as you start doing some of the steps automatically. Your friend is trying to smuggle drugs onto a plane for the very first time. He will make mistakes. He will screw parts of the process up. Mistakes are very easy to make in unfamiliar situations. What's more, he's going to be making these mistakes in front of people whose job it is to detect them. These people spend 8 hours a day, five days a week doing this. The consequence of getting caught is a potentially life-ruining conviction in a court system that is incentivized to give people unfair sentences in order to keep private prisons profitable and keep judges getting reelected on a ""tough on crime"" platform.

myfriendwantstoknow,36n0vw,PM_ME_PRETTY_EYES,8,Wed May 20 16:04:55 2015 UTC,Honestly I'd just be straightforward with the company that's having you get drug tested. No need to be secretive about it if there's nothing to hide.
myfriendwantstoknow,36n0vw,TBoneSausage,5,Wed May 20 16:54:36 2015 UTC,"Will an employer take a medical marijuana prescription seriously? More importantly, are they legally required to ignore positive test results for prescriptions?"
myfriendwantstoknow,36n0vw,Comrade_Beric,12,Wed May 20 17:04:46 2015 UTC,"To both of your questions: almost certainly not.  If this is about getting hired:  No state in the US requires an employer to ignore the results of a drug test when hiring someone.  If this is about the threat of getting fired, then it's a little more complicated, but only barely.  Most states have become ""right to hire"" or ""right to work"" states.  What that actually means is that they no longer have to give a reason when they fire someone.  So, really, your friend could have been fired at any time for any reason and as long as they didn't say what it was for, any law suit against them is effectively dead in the water.  Worse yet, most states don't have protections for jobs in cases where someone is fired for being sick.  So even proving that your friend has the prescription would be meaningless.  Again, though, this is all dependent on the exact state your friend lives in and the employer s/he has.  If they want your friend gone and the state doesn't have special protections to stop them, then s/he's gone.  If the employer doesn't want your friend gone, then nothing will happen.  Employers are very rarely required to report the results of a drug test, if ever, and a simple proof of prescription can be enough to let it slide no problem."
myfriendwantstoknow,36n0vw,JadeSubbae,3,Wed May 20 17:54:35 2015 UTC,I think so but it really depends on the state.
myfriendwantstoknow,36n0vw,TBoneSausage,2,Wed May 20 17:15:37 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen no, they're not legally required to do anything of the like, but what can you really do about it?

myfriendwantstoknow,36n0vw,tookourjerb,15,Wed May 20 17:50:50 2015 UTC,Well he'll most likely fail the drug test but if he really has a prescription they can't do anything about it

myfriendwantstoknow,36ipvz,cicicatastrophe,17,Tue May 19 18:04:42 2015 UTC,"Why I stopped watching porn Ted talk. Watch it. Delete all the porn on your computer.  Masturbation is healthy and normal. However porn can skew our perceptions and preferences. This talk has some really great content that can help you start to change your perspective and find other ways to excite yourself without porn.   I had a period where I was masturbating at least once a day, and the porn I was watching was getting weirder and more extreme. I noticed and started taking inventory on my life. Why was I doing it so much? Turns out I was unhappy with my general place in life, in a unfullfilling relationship, and we weren't having sex that often.   First I made the choice to stop watching porn cold turkey. Then I started pursuing hobbies and activities to not only take up time, but also stimulate my mind. The idea was to find something so engrossing that I didn't even think about turning on the computer. I would still masturbate before bed, (it helped me sleep) but I just used my imagination. It was difficult at first. (The Ted talk really delves into how to retrain your imagination.) And eventually I also got out of that shitty relationship.   When I was single I would hit spikes in frequency and lulls, but I did successfully stop using porn. Now that I'm in a healthy relationship, I barely masturbate because we have an active sex life that isn't just intercourse based. Lots of mutual hand stuff, oral, and general intimacy. I don't miss porn at all. Now it's really easy for me to draw on fantasy and previous experience.   I wish you luck man. It is possible to get off without porn. (Well I'm assuming your a man based on your word choice, but I shouldn't since I'm a lady and I had the same issue. But you get what I'm saying.) You can do it!!!"
myfriendwantstoknow,36ipvz,coleosis1414,11,Wed May 20 00:11:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I'm a huge fan of this talk. This guy does a lot of generalizing. And I'm not saying that porn shouldn't be villainized, but I am saying that he's villainizing it for the wrong reasons.  He focuses his talk on pornography where women are subordinate, humiliated, etc., when there is a lot of porn out there where that is not the focus at all. My favorite porn to watch is material that's over-the-top sensual. Some people are genuinely more aroused by footage of soft kissing and caressing and teasing than they are by a close-up of a penis ramming a vagina.   He also discusses porn as inherently abusive to the women who take part. Not really even considering the possibility of porn actresses who make the personal, independent choice to get into the industry and operate with self-set boundaries and principles throughout their careers.  He also doesn't discuss the polar opposite of the porn he villainizes - the millions of videos of men being used and abused by women. Feminine domination fantasies aimed at men.   He lumps all existing porn into one category. It's like saying ""all movies are bad because some movies have gore. The entire movie industry promotes violence.""  Now, I said earlier that he's villainizing porn for the WRONG REASONS. I think that it's perfectly reasonable to villainize porn for an unrelated reason.  Watching porn desensitizes you. Having access to images of countless naked women and sexually provocative films and pictures overloads your brain with stimulation. In almost every generation before us, for most people the only time you watched  sex was when you were actually having sex with another person. Now we have access to it ALL THE TIME. It's marginalizing the pleasure we get from having sex with real-life partners. In that respect, it damages relationships. And that's why I want to make an effort to quit watching porn. Not because I think all pornography degrades women, because that just isn't true."

I watched porn and masturbated daily (often more) since I saved my first pornographic materials. More than a decade ago. Didn't effect me getting a few girlfriends. Nor did the girlfriends halt or hinder my porn usage or mastubation. Only in the last few months has it been a factor, as me and my girlfriend got a house together. All that means is that I don't do it quite so often because I'm in an abundant sexually relationship and privacy is a bit of an issue. See? I far out wank you and out porn you and have done so for years. It isn't a bad thing. I like it and I go for it because it's normal, healthy and has no downsides.

myfriendwantstoknow,36ipvz,Smokee_the_Bear,1 point,Fri May 22 11:03:23 2015 UTC,It is the process of reducing the dosage slowly instead of stopping cold turkey. This gradual reduction helps keep the body from going through physical withdrawals. This method is most commonly used with trying to get people off of heroin or benzos where the physical withdrawal can be very painful if not deadly. Masturbating does not create physical withdrawals so a slow reduction isn't needed.

myfriendwantstoknow,36bu21,Beezer12WashingBird,2,Mon May 18 17:00:36 2015 UTC,"Is OpenDNS implemented at the router level or on a per computer basis?  If router level, then you would have to change the DNS settings to something like 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS) or remove it entirely and use the ISP server.  If on a per computer basis you can just remove it from your network settings.  Logging of sites can be turned on or off, it depends on settings. If you log into their OpenDNS account you can delete all logged information. Choose Settings, click on your network, then ""Stats and Logs"" then ""Purge DNS Data""."
myfriendwantstoknow,36bu21,nisage,1 point,Mon May 18 19:11:42 2015 UTC,my friend did exactly that. thanks!
myfriendwantstoknow,36bu21,krudler5,1 point,Mon May 18 22:29:51 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't that be quite obvious if all of the history from his/her computer was suddenly gone and/or new logs weren't being created? I think you have the right idea, but it might be better to only use a different DNS service when he/she is doing something they don't want the parents to see and then change it back afterwards.  Also, if the router is set to use OpenDNS, could OP's friend still set their computer to use something else (e.g. 8.8.8.8)? Or would the router still override that?"
myfriendwantstoknow,36bu21,nisage,2,Tue May 19 00:10:09 2015 UTC,"Most people don't check that info that frequently as you have to intentionally go to the openDNS site and check it. It's somewhat unlikely that his friend's parents are going to check it at all.   If they do, there are any number of things that could explain the reset, although the most likely answer would clearly be that someone had deleted it. The information is still gone, so at least they won't know the details.   As for the router set with OpenDNS, the friend's computer could be configured to use Google's DNS server and it would bypass the router settings. The router would only supply DNS info to the computer if the computer was set to default (the majority, probably).  It appears that if the router had a firewall and was set up to block port 53 passthrough, or was configured to redirect port 53 traffic to OpenDNS, then it would still log that info. But again, it's quite unlikely that their friend's parents are that tech savvy, or care enough to fully log their traffic."
myfriendwantstoknow,36c3l4,bigladylover69,5,Mon May 18 04:39:01 2015 UTC,"When shoplifting, there are four main concerns about product selection: Size ((the physical dimensions of the object, it's volume, it's mass, and the distribution of the same), Security (the presence of, and difficulty circumventing, loss-prevention measures), Service (the use the item will have to the shoplifter), and Self (the totality of the impact the theft will have on the thief).  To find the best thing to shoplift, look first at the service factor.  Do you have a need in your life that could be met through appropriation?  For example, the best thing a starving person could shoplift would probably be fresh produce.  It meets their immediate need, most veggies are small enough to be slipped into a pocket, or can be broken up to fit in small places without loosing their nutritional value, the security on these items is usually low because of their generally low price point and the difficulty in justifying putting an RIFD tag inside a carrot, and the impact on the self is usually rather positive.  Even if someone starving doesn't like their behavior, they usually prefer to continue living over not stealing.  Other examples of using ""service"" to determine the best option would be: people needing to furnish a new home raiding a hotel lobby for seating options (and probably the housekeeping cart for towels and shampoo), someone in need of a cell phone charger slipping one into their bag at insert name of Big Box Chain Store here, and someone in need of money searching for something with a comparably high re-sale value for its size, even on the grey or black markets.  The easiest thing to shoplift is a question determined by a conjunction of the Size and Security properties.  Lighter and smaller things are easier to steal physically, just in the very act of stealing them; while things that aren't particularly well secured have fewer obstacles in the way of their theft, and are thus easier to steal in that regard.  The Koh-i-Noor diamond, at a mere 21.6 grams in a remarkably dense package is very easy to shoplift from a raw size perspective... but the fact that it's kept in the Tower of London under constant professional guard with cameras and an adoring public parading by on the regular do rather complicate the shoplifting from a security perspective.  At the same time a cubic yard of topsoil might sit unguarded, and even unobserved, for days at a time at the gardening supply store, but making away with something so bulky and heavy would not making the physical act very easy.  Items that generally score well in all of these categories include, but are certainly not limited to: cosmetics, trading cards, art supplies (nicer pens in particular), spices, balsamic vinegar, ""over the counter"" medications, DVDs and CDs (yes, they still make and sell those), clothing (especially if you're going for a layered look), Tony Bennetts heart (he's just leaving the damn thing around anyways), small electronics components, knick-knacks, musical instruments, and loose change."
myfriendwantstoknow,36c3l4,Rohasfin,2,Mon May 18 07:42:57 2015 UTC,"This was an incredibly well thought out statement.  To add to this, especially on the electronics and DVD/CDs, you'll want to definitely remove them from packaging. They're easier to transport in non-bulky packages, and usually there are security devices in the packaging but not on the products themselves.  Like typical burglary, you can go in with nothing but your pockets and wits, and walk out with merchandise. But, just like burglary, there are some helpful tools you can use:     Very small blades: For cutting and removing packaging. Faster and less cumbersome than using just you hands.  Sometimes your keys will work, but that can be more conspicuous, and the last thing you want is to be noticed. A purse or other inconspicuous bag. Obvious reasons, carrying merchandise. Many places have policies that don't allow them to search your bags unless they involve law enforcement. Your cell phone. Cell phones are a fantastic way to scope out places. Using the camera function, you can still look down aisles while looking like you're checking a text. If you have two cameras, you can even look behind you. Many customers take pictures of merchandise or compare prices on the spot, so it's not particularly suspicious to see someone hovering over an item with their phone out.   Final note: Audacity is sometimes your best friend. I have seen people walk out of my former place of employment with things like bicycles, small televisions, and in one case, 30 containers of bleach. The ""bleach bandit"" was caught when they came back for more, the other two were not that stupid.

myfriendwantstoknow,36c3l4,Kothophed,2,Tue May 19 04:20:02 2015 UTC,"Do price tags set off the alarm, or only the attached security device? What about shoplifting at places like target? I believe they have a room with security monitors that someone watches over."
myfriendwantstoknow,36c3l4,ParadisaeaDecora,2,Tue May 19 08:54:56 2015 UTC,"The security devices are what set them off, but they're usually attached to the inside of the case. Most places have a security room, and cameras are usually ceiling mounted and hidden among dozens of fake cameras. In my experience, I just kept moving so that I was far less likely to be seen on camera shoplifting. Never been caught, thankfully, otherwise younger me would have been in deeeeeeeeeeeeeeep shit."

myfriendwantstoknow,362g76,TFiOS,2,Fri May 15 22:33:04 2015 UTC,A senior class 5 years before mine did this. It Was pretty funny and took alot of work. Luckily the grass in our school court yard was already shitty so they didn't mess it up that much. They asked one of the students dad's who owned the cows if they could take 4 of them for the night. It was the best senior prank of the history of my school.

It's an absolute nightmare.    A - they are cute,  but not bright. You can keep them calm,  but they won't pay attention. No lead in the world will work and they are strong from birth, trust me. They can hurt you,  too!  B - they are expensive and a farmer seeing their livestock being stolen might just take up their ""arms"" to protect their property. Is your friend prepared to possibly be shot at?  I'm sure we would shoot at least a warning shot at someone stealing one of our herd. Just saying.   C - more than likely  the cow would  run away and your friend would just give up,  unable to control the situation,  leaving the cow on a road or somewhere equally vulnerable.  It's just not a good idea and if it was one of my cows? I would be livid. You asked,  I'm telling. .. from someone that owns the silly beasts!"

myfriendwantstoknow,35zpiz,vigilantserialkiller,11,Thu May 14 21:34:00 2015 UTC,"From what I remember, if you weren't drinking then they would probably just let you go.  They can definitely breathalyze you.    The worst that would probably happen in my state at least, would be a ticket issued for ""minor in possession"" under the theory that your body is a container (of alcohol).   Which is generally less than a couple hundred bucks and not that big a deal.    Hardly anyone I know got busted in college, and if the cops aren't after you specifically, you should make a run for it.  There will be tons of other people there to bust, so it's not like they can actually grab everyone."
myfriendwantstoknow,35zpiz,geeeeoffff,10,Thu May 14 22:14:37 2015 UTC,"In my state, there's a separate law, called minor in consumption, if you're drunk but don't actually have have alcohol when they catch you.  Also, if the OP's friend is over 21, and other people in the party are underage, that's most likely contributing to the delinquency of minors, which is a pretty big deal."

myfriendwantstoknow,35zpiz,Stats_monkey,1 point,Sat May 16 00:06:08 2015 UTC,The laws according to school were set so that they don't develop a drinking problem which is apperently easier when you're below around 21. The laws for tobacco products are also in order to not have as many getting so easily addicted when you're young.
myfriendwantstoknow,35zpiz,karpathian,14,Tue May 19 08:28:53 2015 UTC,"Just admit that you haven't been drinking. If you haven't, it's probably pretty obvious. It is extremely easy to tell if someone hasn't been drinking if you're sober. The cop might eye fuck you a little bit or even do an eye test, which you will pass, but he will let you go. This happened to a friend of mine who never drinks. We all got MIPs. He was fine."

Eventually they made me sit down and shined a light straight at my eyes for a few seconds, and then told me I was high when I wasn't.  I'm also hispanic, though, so.

myfriendwantstoknow,35zpiz,dbuck79,2,Fri May 15 02:38:42 2015 UTC,"Okay, I have to ask.  Does this really happen? Do the Police really show up at parties and close them down? Like, when I watch American movies and they're throwing a house party, they all seem to be drinking out of red cups, having a good time, then someone will yell ""GUYS! IT'S THE COPS! RUN!"" and they all leg it out of there in every direction. The Police come and are like ""Okay who's in charge here?!"" and they receive a massive bollocking.  I live in England, and have been to a fair amount of parties, and the Police have never shown up. Ever. Then again, I think parties in England don't seem to get quite as ""out of hand"" as depicted in films I've seen. One of the party-goers may accidentally lift their pinky finger whilst drinking which causes a bit of commotion and a slight squabble, but other than that it's generally well-behaved.  Unless I've just been to really SHIT parties. I'm not sure."
myfriendwantstoknow,35zpiz,smthompson,3,Fri May 15 10:50:00 2015 UTC,"I suppose it depends on where you live. I live in a large city in Michigan, its normally a 50/50 chance cops will show up and shut it down. Normally people don't run away, but rather are told to leave by the police. As long as you're not obviously intoxicated, police here normally dont want anything to do with you unless you're the homeowner. However there are a lot more serious things for them to deal with around here, so I'd imagine they don't feel like wasting their time. There have been a handful of times when I've  left one shut down party to go to another that also gets shut down."
myfriendwantstoknow,35zpiz,Unoiseau,1 point,Fri May 15 11:43:44 2015 UTC,That happens in movies to display how crazy the party was in the movie. I don't hear of it happening very often IRL.

They didn't come back.  If you are hosting a party. Keep all of the doors closed cause cops can't come in unless the door is open. If they ask for the host, have the host walk outside to talk to them and shit the door behind them.  But not all cops are nice."

myfriendwantstoknow,35v4ct,Maito_Gais_Jockstrap,26,Wed May 13 19:39:59 2015 UTC,"I recently had food poisoning... If you're starting to feel sick, or like you're going to puke, just get it over with. Seriously, it's gonna come out one end or the other. Puking is a lot less painful than day or two of shitting fire hydrant pressure water out of your asshole.  Personally, whenever I feel like I'm going to puke, I mean reaaaally KNOW it's gonna happen, I chug some coke or apple juice. It doesn't help the puking, but it makes it taste less horrible. I'd rather taste regurgitated coke/apple juice than stomach acid.  Anyway, yes, inducing vomiting and eliminating the bad food will prevent food poisoning. Your stomach absorbs very little nutrients--that's not its job in digestion. Your stomach breaks down foods so that your intestines can absorb them. If you get it out of your stomach before it enters your intestines, you're probably going to be okay. Otherwise, be prepared for a shitty 24-48 hours.   This past weekend, I destroyed our master bathroom with diarrhea/projectile vomit in amounts so copious that neither my wife or I could handle going in there to begin cleaning it up until yesterday--two days after I initially got sick.

myfriendwantstoknow,35mz16,sssyjackson,3,Tue May 12 16:54:26 2015 UTC,When it comes to family sometimes you have to risk it.
myfriendwantstoknow,35mz16,sssyjackson,2,Tue May 12 17:18:27 2015 UTC,"Well then, it's still ill-advised to tell the guy to kill himself, but it's way better than saying, ""I'm going to kill you.""  Because that's a threat. But if you tell someone to kill themselves and then they don't kill themselves, I don't think you can get in trouble.  Adam Richman ( the Man v. Food guy) told some chick on Twitter to kill herself because she was giving him a hard time about using #thinspiration after he lost weight, and that's a common term to use to advocate for anorexia. (I don't think he knew that was the case, and just thought she was just being unsupportive of his weight loss.) He didn't get in real trouble. I mean, I think the premier of his new show got pushed back, and he had to apologize (over Twitter), but that's it.   So I think that your friend is only in trouble if the guy actually does it, but it could probably be defended in court if his sister is being abused by the guy.  I mean, I can tell someone to rob a bank, but unless I coerce or forcethem to do it, or help plan it, then I'm not responsible when they actually do it.  That was the case with that girl from Boston who told her friend to kill himself and then he did. She didn't just say ""kill yourself"" once and then stopped there.   She told him to do it over and over. He was confiding in her that he was scared and didn't want to leave his family and stuff, and she still told him he should do it anyway. Then she was texting back and forth with his mom and his sister at the time that she knew he was texting her saying he was about to do it but he was scared, and she knew where he was, but she was still going back and texting the mom and the sister that she was so worried about him and she didn't know where he was and just hoped someone would find him soon. Then (at the same time) he said he got out of the car and didn't want to do it, she told him, ""get back in."" (I think he killed himself by breathing in exhaust fumes.)  She's being charged with involuntary manslaughter, but she really had to do a lot. Not just say ""Go kill yourself"" because she was mad.  There was that mom that harassed a girl from her daughter's school over Facebook until that girl killed herself too, and I know she was charged with something, but I don't know if she was found guilty. But she was basically abusing the girl over the internet for months. Then again, she was pretending to be a boy to get the girl to like her, then she ""dumped"" her and told her to kill herself. So maybe she was in trouble for identity fraud, and not for the girl killing herself? Idk.  I think it's more about preying on an emotionally unstable/depressed person and coercing them to do something that they may not have been likely to do otherwise.   Your friend's sister's bf is probably emotionally unstable, but in a way that makes him dangerous to others, not to himself. I really doubt your friend would get in trouble."
myfriendwantstoknow,35mz16,reprapraper,13,Tue May 12 19:07:05 2015 UTC,"Yes. Don't you remember that girl this past winter who was telling some guy at her school to kill himself, and then tried to act sad to get attention when he actually did it? Last I heard, they were charging her with something.   Plus, that's a pretty shitty thing to do."

myfriendwantstoknow,35mz16,reprapraper,4,Mon May 11 23:09:23 2015 UTC,"They don't need to assist in any way.  It's bullying, but from a legal standpoint it's manslaughter."
myfriendwantstoknow,35mz16,Otzil,1 point,Tue May 12 02:28:04 2015 UTC,"i think that depends on the circumstances. all that op has provided is that their friend has told someone to kill themself. if they were bullying someone and that person took their own life and it could be proved that the suicide was a direct result of the bullying then yes, it would be manslaughter. however, just telling someone to kill themself leaves a lot left in order for legal culpability to be established"

myfriendwantstoknow,35mz16,spencer102,2,Tue May 12 08:14:40 2015 UTC,"I think it's a grey area in a lot of states. I do remember there being a precedent case in which some teenagers were arrested for telling someone to commit suicide who later actually did.  This was a bit different from what I assume your friends case was though- these people had been harrassing the suicide victim for quite a while before this and I believe they knew them IRL. I don't know if there is any precedent for someone who told someone to kill themselved online anonymously. I also know that in all the cases where I have ever heard of people being charged an actual suicide took place, so IDK if telling someone to commit suicide is illegal by itself or if someone has to actually do it afrerwards.   That said, it's pretty shitty to do, and legally pretty risky. Sure to you it might just be an insult but some people take that shit seriously. Just say ""fuck you"" instead or something."

In addition to that, your friend should also spend a considerable amount of time educating himself. He can add that to his shroom studying time.  He should know exactly what the mushroom that he is going to eat looks like, he should know the full effects, what do other people experience, how big is the difference between a mild trip and a decently crazy trip etc.  He should also know how big the difference is between the mildest recorded trip, to the most fucked up bad trip recorded (could range from no effects, to full blown psychosis. Some drugs are much more individual than others).  He should also be aware of the risks and rewards. Some have higher risk/reward ratios. Would your friend be okay eating a mushroom that makes 90% of it's eaters insane, with a 0,5% chance of experiencing a mild trip lasting about 30 seconds?

I've also experienced first hand that it can allow you to jump in too fast early on before your body is ready for it & cause injuries.  Not being able to exercise for weeks or months due to a disc or joint injury can be a huge weight loss setback.

If your friend is anything like how I was when I was in that situation many years ago, he's probably racing home to stick his dick into whatever he can find.

So, if anything at all went wrong, you'd be held to the contract. Maybe that means you need to exit the lease early, maybe that means the place is infested. Whatever it is, a small claims court - the usual outlet for these things - will hold to the contract.  Contracts are nasty.

Make a list of expenses and whatever income she has if any. Sometimes the things we need can be achieved through good budgeting. Some others require spending little less here and there. If it is to cover housing or food, there are organizations willing to help. If the money is needed asap. Let her know that prostitution is a drastic measure and it usually leaves emotional damage. There are people who enjoy it, not uncommon. But if it is just from a financial standpoint, well, massages are a good alternative. A ""happy ending"" would be less damaging, emotionally speaking, than going the whole way and she doesn't have to get undressed. Whatever it is I wish her the best and since you seem to be a voice of sanity, don't let her take that dive into the deep end without speaking about alternatives. Good luck."

I don't think it's abnormal or anything. I personally think it's better than going out every Friday or Saturday night. I feel much more productive when I stay in. Even if I play video games all weekend, I feel like it's a better alternative than going out and getting black out shit blasted. However I am 22, and the majority of my friends are between 22 and 27.

Your friend should be going out whenever they want to however they want to if they are looking to have fun; do so on their own terms and how they want to. Worrying about social norms is just going to make them unhappy in the long run.  That being said, if they feel lonely and feel like they want to be going out then they are going to have to put in work (maybe a ridiculous amount of work) meeting people with similar interests as them.

Alcohol combined with strong opiates (not condeine) or large enough dose of opiates will cause you to lose consciousness and stop breathing. Considering the rather active street drug culture found in the Netherlands, especially in Amsterdam, finding some heroin or perhaps morphine pills will be trivial. After that researching the proper dosages and LD50 numbers will also be trivial.  HOWEVER that being said, unless you plan on killing someone and this is for suicide purposes, how about you check out /r/suicidewatch first? I mean I don't think there much rush in these things, maybe take up smoking and do it the slow way, gives more time to reflect on your choices.

If you have physical access to the computer, it's yours. edit To add, this is for Windows based OS  Offline Windows Password & Registry Editor  Download this, burn to a CD or bootable USB drive and boot to it. Read the instructions but it's incredibly easy to unlock and blank out the local Administrator's password (or any other user's) and then boot back into Windows.   If you don't have access to the BIOS, and the machine is set to boot to HDD first, then you'll need to remove the BIOS password (usually a jumper on the motherboard), and then that will clear the BIOS password. This varies by manufacturer. On Dell Optiplexs for example, it's a jumper on the board labelled 'PWD' just take off the jumper and it clears the PW.  StickyKeys method does work, but you need administrator access to accomplish it - even in SafeMode generally. You also need to know the appropriate commands to create a new Admin user account and/or reset passwords. It's not nearly as straightforward as the reset disk I listed.  The disk will work on Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 2003, 2008, 2008 R2, and I haven't tried 2012 but got a feeling it'll work.

I guess the question is, given no written documentation of warning was given, does the department head have a case here?"
myfriendwantstoknow,34q08h,evilbrent,1 point,Mon May 4 00:58:34 2015 UTC,"Is it a right to work state or not? Plus does your friend actually want to stay in a place where they want him gone? Seems like a shitty deal to force them into keeping you around based on technicalities.   Either way, I've seen this happen before through personal experience. They start with BS submissions to HR. They do this to create a formal paper trail, so when they argue with their bosses on letting you go, they have a record to stand on and support their case.   Just tell your friend to keep their head low and get the job done. Do his best not to rock the boat, and just hope his boss stops bothering. Either way, it's clearly not a good cultural fit for your friend at the very least, so he should start applying elsewhere."
myfriendwantstoknow,34q08h,Thisismyfinalstand,1 point,Mon May 4 01:19:40 2015 UTC,"He likes where he's working, just is finding it odd that the department head acts this way.  Yeah, I'm sorry I'm not giving more details on the exact nature of the work, it would clear up many things.  Tough for him to apply to other places, and in reality, the place is pretty bad, wholly because the department head.  It's a very odd situation to say the least.  I mean, we're talking about people crying in the hallways at night because of this guy."
myfriendwantstoknow,34q08h,Codeshark,2,Mon May 4 01:41:37 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I've been in a near exact situation. I worked at an amazing and well known company that I wanted to make my career. Unfortuantely, after being transfered to a new leader, it went down hill. The guy didn't like me, was a terrible leader, and would sand bag me every step of the way. He was out to get me. He'd secretly write me up, and go straight to the VP to complain about me which is really unheard of. All the other managers and my coworkers loved me, it was just this one guy who didn't see eye to eye with me. However, when I'd get in trouble, he'd try to defend me in front of the VP, trying to make it look like he was on my side.  Eventually I got let go because of this guy's BS. But I could have probably fought it, and possibly receive a second chance. But would it be worth it? Working at a place where the VP has a bad impression of me, and a guy that is actively trying to get rid of me? I decided it was not. I didn't want to work at a place where I felt like someone was working against me, no matter how much I enjoyed working for the company.  It just wasn't a good fit, even though it wasn't my fault. It's just how it is. Pick the battles that are worth winning."

Amphetamines: (Think of speed, ritalin, etc.) Pretty much the same as for MDMA, but in lower doses without the sex drive. Generally just hard to climax, can take hours, but worth it in the end. MXE: Really fucking weird. Hard to focus. Would not recommend.  Magic mushrooms: Although I haven't tried fapping on it per se, I imagine it would be really fucking amazing. Might be hard to actually set yourself to the task and it might get weird but still great.  LSD: The one time I did LSD my trip seemed very sexual, I couldn't help myself.

myfriendwantstoknow,34gzun,devilain55,-4,Fri May 1 19:07:01 2015 UTC,"For best pleasure go with MDMA (Molly) or if you can't find Molly then Extacy, if you want to have a fap marathon go with meth or aderall, it feels good to do things with your hands on meth and masturbating gives it an added bonus, plus it makes it to where you go for along time. I wouldn't recommend meth or aderal because you will feel extremely grimy and dirty after you sober up. If you've ever felt ashamed after you masturbated for some reason then magnify that 100x and that's how shameful you'll feel after a twacked out wackathon."
myfriendwantstoknow,34gzun,BatMannwith2Ns,3,Fri May 1 06:36:34 2015 UTC,Ok- so I might be a bit of a square or something for asking- I thought MDMA was ecstasy? They are different?
myfriendwantstoknow,34gzun,ntermation,-3,Fri May 1 08:16:41 2015 UTC,"Pure Molly is Pure MDMA, extacy is mainly MDMA but it has meth and other stuff in it too and Molly (MDMA) can be cut with other stuff as well. Molly comes in powder that might be in a capsule and Ex is a pill that has a certain color and a character or symbol of some kind on it."
myfriendwantstoknow,34gzun,BatMannwith2Ns,2,Fri May 1 09:40:40 2015 UTC,XTC pills are indeed usually cut with other stuff such as amphetamines or caffeine. My experiences on pure MDMA have been different than those on great pills.

""For example, the distribution of onsets of seven female lifeguards was scattered at the beginning of the summer, but after 3 months spent together, the onset of all seven cycles fell within a 4-day period.""   Martha McClintock's 1971 paper, published in Nature, says that menstrual cycle synchronization happens when the menstrual cycle onsets of two or more women become closer together in time than they were several months earlier.  Several mechanisms have been hypothesized to cause synchronization.   After the initial studies, several papers were published reporting methodological flaws in studies reporting menstrual synchrony including McClintock's study. In addition, other studies were published that failed to find synchrony. The proposed mechanisms have also received scientific criticism. A 2013 review of menstrual synchrony concluded that menstrual synchrony is an erroneous theory.

myfriendwantstoknow,346nkp,hehehh,20,Tue Apr 28 18:51:21 2015 UTC,"Pharmacist here.  If your friend is looking for relief from some minor constipation, upping his fiber intake may help. Things like Metamucil are meant to help bulk up the stool and help move things along. Water soluble fiber is best for keeping oneself regular.  Miralax is a great laxative if you're backed up also. A bit more expensive, but it's worth the cost if you're uncomfortable. Stool softeners like Colace will work also.  If your friend is looking for some more immediate relief, then a stimulant laxative like Ex-Lax will do the trick. Your friend should not use this on a regular basis. Your body can actually become dependent on stimulant laxative use.  If your friend is not looking to stick anything up his poop chute, then you can forget enemas, though they're quite effective at cleaning someone out, but only in the lower part of the intestine, for obvious reasons. A warm soap suds enema is used as a last resort for patients who simply cannot go.  Lastly, there's a bottle that I like to refer to as the ""mag bomb"" that you'll find in the laxative aisle. It's a bottle of magnesium citrate and that works quite quickly. Not recommended if your friend is prone to electrolyte imbalance issues."

Enemas aren't bad, they're tiny and the only discomfort is from the unwarmed liquid running through your bowels. You can get one of those from a drug store for ~$8 and I've only once not had one work.  Milk of Magnesia works in about 30 minutes and is (in my opinion as someone who's suffered from such issues for 13 years) the best fast-working laxative you can get.  But seriously, just go for the enema. There's nothing wrong with sticking a small plastic tube up your butt, and it just works super well, and unlike a laxative, will almost never leave you with pain."

Not just because they will be responsible for paying off all of your friend's debt, but they will undoubtedly miss your friend very much.  Suicidal thoughts are normal. Have your friend talk to someone. It just might help."
myfriendwantstoknow,348x4a,GoonerGuru,4,Wed Apr 29 06:41:28 2015 UTC,"Okay, so first off, your friend should really consider calling  1 (800) 273-8255, because your friend shouldn't do anything like hurt themselves. If your friend has a moment, they might want to check out the documentary ""The Bridge"", which details the circumstances around a bunch of people who tried/succeeded in committing suicide over the Golden Gate Bridge. Long story short? They generally realized that they could have fixed every problem that caused them to jump, except for the fact that they had just jumped. In addition, your friend should tell their family members/friends that they are in pain and considering hurting themselves. All that being said...      From what I understand, student loans last forever. They're immune to bankruptcy, and a lot of other forms of debt reduction. So your friend would absolutely be saddling their parents with all of that debt.   Insurance generally won't cover deliberate actions/accidents. Arguably that's insurance fraud, and your parents/next-of-kin might be sued for a clearly fraudulent claim.     So the obvious answer is that your friend shouldn't do it. And they should get help. Check out /r/depression, /r/SuicideWatch, or just give an old friend a call and see how they're doing. Call the phone number I gave you. If your friend is a veteran/police officer/part of a lot of other groups, there may be other people they can call that can sympathize with your friend's position and give your friend advice on how to handle it/what worked for them. Lastly, if your friend wants to talk, or make another friend, please tell them to feel free to PM me. It may not mean much, but this random internet stranger is worried about your friend, and hopes they change their mind."

myfriendwantstoknow,348x4a,swrrga,3,Wed Apr 29 06:48:02 2015 UTC,Would a lawyer be legally obligated to approach authorities given the circumstances?
myfriendwantstoknow,348x4a,chorjin,1 point,Wed Apr 29 06:52:21 2015 UTC,"It depends who you ask, and the question is as old as legal ethics.  See here for a rather massive overview.  The New York Times had a much shorter piece which discusses it, and they argue that the lawyer should do their job and keep their head down when it came to such matters.  In summary, I don't believe most circumstances would dictate that the attorney has an obligation to report, but they are sometimes granted the discretion to report, which means it's still a big question mark.  Such sticky issues can best be avoided, of course, by dissuading your friend from suicide.  It will be one hell of a mess no matter what."

myfriendwantstoknow,3443g7,Dxkingxd,14,Tue Apr 28 07:45:53 2015 UTC,"As proven above, there is literally no way for your friend to use hash tags without looking ridiculous.    Nature of the beast."
myfriendwantstoknow,3443g7,Skudworth,12,Tue Apr 28 15:43:39 2015 UTC,"It completely depends no the type of instagram account your friend has.  Some people use hashtags about the themes in the photo or the type of photo, so for example your friend might post a photo of someone making a piece of streetart in London and end up with:   /#streetphotography #streetart #igerslondon #streephoto #london #gb #uk #england #shoreditch  Then, they may have found some hubs that interest them, which may or may not include the local instagram community which they may or may not be a part of (for instameets etc). If so, you would include them too:  /#igerslondon #igersUK #igersTorontoOnTour #ig_london #ig_UK #ig_england  Then, there might be other cool hashtag hubs that your friend likes and wants to be a part of:  /#killeverygram #huntgram #streetdreamsmagazine #shoot2kill #justgoshoot #way2ill #illgrammers  Lastly, there are a bunch of hashtags that people use because they are ultra-popular and are a sure source of a couple of likes, and also simply others that aren't really that important but can bring you together with like-minded photographers, like ones about your photo gear if you don't use your phone (or use #iphoneonly):  /#photooftheday #vscocam #vscocamgood #instagood  #fujifilm #fujifilmxt1 #xt1 #fujifilm_xseries  If there are any accounts your friend likes that regularly feature photos he thinks he could get into as well (for example say #excellent_bnw) they obviously need to be included too.  A couple of other tips:    Remember that there is a limit on the number of hashtags per photo They key to not looking desperate is not using the ""like for like"" ""follow 4 follow"" bullshit hashtags Now that they've changed it, it is virtually useless to add certain hashtags more than a few seconds after posting because people will never see that photo in that hashtag space. If you added a photo 2 minutes ago and add it to #streetphotography now, your photo is going to be way down with other photos posted two minutes ago and there are a LOT of photos being added every couple of seconds.  So, that means adding your hashtags at the same time as the photos, which looks a bit lame OR, writing them out in another program and copying them. As soon your photo has been posted, you comment the hashtags in. Then, after a few comments, your hashtags won't be visible anymore, which is like 1000000x cooler. there's really no point adding random hashtags like #absolutely #the #best #day #ever, since nobody ever looks at those. You need to use hashtags people will actually tap on and look through."
myfriendwantstoknow,3443g7,walaska,5,Tue Apr 28 08:18:59 2015 UTC,"This is all solid advice! Remember just use relevant hashtag,  for example don't tag a selfie #tattoos if you can't actually see the damn tattoo"

You might also have your friend run a temp monitor (like speedfan) to see if perhaps the card is running too hot.  If so, MSI might be willing to replace the card.  Also, try different driver versions.  Check MSI's site for drivers, or use the ones directly from nVidia.  Try the Beta drivers, or one of the older versions.  It could just be an issue with a particular driver version.  A quick google search returned someone else with an issue, and some possible fixes.  If all else fails, and no one else has any other non-destructive ideas, the best I can think of is to maybe find a soldered joint that seems a little weak and melt off just enough to break the connection so it won't POST.  You run a very high risk of leaving evidence of the tampering, however, so leave it as a last resort.  Plus, as crappy as it is that your friend has a seemingly faulty product, if their warranty doesn't cover it, then it is kind of wrong to break the card to force an RMA."

HIV was a more serious thing in the 80's/90's, but there is a lot of research and treatment out there now to help people with the disease live pretty normal lives (there's a pretty hilarious social commentary on this exact issue on South Park, S12E1, Trouble With Tonsils).    It's very hard/impossible to define what does and doesn't warrant suicide, but if i was you, I'd just change the story to take place in the early 80s. That would make your prof's note moot, as well as alleviate you having to make too many changes."

myfriendwantstoknow,3425f8,OrbOfConfusion,6,Mon Apr 27 23:04:19 2015 UTC,"suicide is fairly predictable -- when an individual feels like they don't have a purpose and that they're a burden on others around them, they'll kill themselves p often without any real external reason. The burden part isn't really talked about a lot. showing that your character feels this way might make it more believable.  Your professor claiming a person needs a reason seems odd. It's very difficult to prove that there's a reason to live at all using prove able, logical statements. People kill themselves for dumb reasons all the time -- many of them worse than 'i have aids.'  just set the story in japan or insinuate that the character's parents don't approve of his life or make him/her a tranny or put an ssri ad at the end and say 'millions of americans have untreated clinical depression' or w/e"

myfriendwantstoknow,3425f8,ChefBoyarlifts,2,Mon Apr 27 19:49:30 2015 UTC,"Why don't you just set the play in the 80's? Then it becomes commentary about the feelings of hopelessness and paranoia surrounding HIV and AIDS at the time.  Otherwise, you might want to just change the angle a bit. Just because HIV isn't the death sentence it used to be doesn't mean the main character wouldn't be mortified about giving it to her friends. Maybe this is the final straw in a life filled with such failures; maybe this character keeps hurting the people around her accidentally and feels she has finally gone too far. People have certainly killed themselves for far less than this, you just need to make the audience believe the character cares enough to kill herself."
myfriendwantstoknow,3425f8,prezuiwf,2,Tue Apr 28 05:34:13 2015 UTC,Depression and regret are reasons for suicide.  I think that some people may not deal well with the aftermath of having a threesome.  Throw in religious upbringings and it could work for both characters.

myfriendwantstoknow,3438z8,Odd_nonposter,2,Tue Apr 28 11:05:19 2015 UTC,"DO NOT have him take more than one. He clearly doesn't know much about opiates and doesn't have any tolerance.   He should know that this is basically synthetic heroin and is extremely addictive. Furthermore, he will most likely feel pretty nauseous as its his first time.  If he's sure he want to try it, have him crush one pill up with a lighter or something similar, divide it into 5 lines that are equal sizes, snort one line, wait 30 minutes and see how he feels. He can then re-dose if he wants more. The reason I say to crush it up it because it is extended release, not instant release. Extended release won't get you that ""high."" Crushing it will bring the full effect on within 30 minutes.   Addiction is a bitch. Trying something can be okay, but know the consequences."

Translation: TSA does not give a shit, you can keep the pills in a plastic baggie (or if you're concerned, get some sort of reusable pill container and keep them in that.)  Remember, a person with a legit prescription for Xanax would still probably not bring an entire bottle with them on a short trip. They would use some smaller container.

Airing on St. Louis television station KTVI-TV, as he ran as U.S. Representative for Missouri's 2nd congressional district for the U.S. Senate seat held by Claire McCaskill, his response to a question on rape exceptions for abortion was:     Well you know, people always want to try to make that as one of those things, well how do you, how do you slice this particularly tough sort of ethical question. First of all, from what I understand from doctors, that's really rare. If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. But let's assume that maybe that didn't work or something. I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment ought to be on the rapist and not attacking the child.

Usually you can use the textbook in the library but you won't be able to take it home with you.  If that doesn't work your friend can try exercising his/her social skills by asking his/her fellow classmates is they can borrow the book.   Lastly your friend can try downloading it on torrent.  If your friend still can't find it then simply by the book and then sell it on amazon or  ebay as soon the class is over.

Disclaimer, I'm not familiar with UK law, but as US law is based off of it I'll just run with it. First, authorities would have to have a reason to suspect that you had potential child pornography. As the file was advertised as ""teens"" it's doubtful that they're gonna look too closely into it, even if they could track your friend. Second, the prosecution would have to examine every picture and determine if it meets the definition of child pornography. The problem for them would be proving beyond a reasonable doubt the the subjects are underage, which would be difficult. In all, it's too much work for the police, and the benefit to society and justice administered too little.   All in all, I think your friend is safe ;)"

Even if they're 'app files' it just means that the files are stored in that apps section of the file directory so with a little searching you should be able to find a folder named after the app and and where the files are.

Insurance companies that have to pay out excel at trying to find a way to avoid paying money out. So, for instance, if you did submit a false transcript, and something happened that your insurance would be liable for, they might decide to look into it then, and if they find out that the transcript was false, they might use that as a reason to void your policy and not pay, leaving you to foot whatever bill the insurance would normally cover. If it's a small claim they probably wouldn't bother, but if they have to pay a large one, they will look for any reason not to do it. Tell you friend that in the long run, they are better just paying the full premiums."

myfriendwantstoknow,33m8y4,whatIsThisBullCrap,6,Thu Apr 23 17:57:20 2015 UTC,"Tell your friend to reschedule his appointment and tell his doctor he wants to increase the dosage.  If your friend tells the doctor he doesn't think the current dose is working, the doctor will most likely adjust the dosage to fit his needs.  In addition, tell your friend to try and take the medication consistently.  I took Sertraline for a while and my doctor told me it takes up to 3 weeks with consistent use to become effective.  It might be that the 50mg is enough but it just hasn't had a chance to build up yet.  Try taking it consistently in the evening until the appointment next week and tell the Dr. what's up.  It will all work out for your friend."

The 100mg took away the depression but it also removed all emotions leaving me rather apathetic and sort of lost in my own mind. I failed a few classes that semester and I hold that drug at least some what at fault.   TLDR don't increase it yourself.  Not to mention you'll run out half way through it trying to double it because you only are given enough for each month."

Right now I'm on 200 mg of sertraline, and i went up by 25mg increments every 2 weeks.   Depending on how you react to the medication, it could be a very bad idea. I know whenever I up my dosage even 25mg I end up puking all night for the first two nights. I get used to it though as time goes on.  I would wait for your doctor to make sure he wants you to skip right to 100mg from 50mg.   Really, it's not fun.   EDIT: If you do this, I wouldn't recommend taking it in the morning or afternoon unless you want to be drowsy all day. I know it may not feel like it makes you tired at 50mg, but it might at 100mg."
myfriendwantstoknow,33m8y4,Shortcircuit05,-4,Fri Apr 24 04:37:10 2015 UTC,"I have done it with that exact same drug and I felt ok...the thing to note about sertraline and the like is that it does not affect you right away, so he probably would not see the difference in dose for a few days / weeks. I'm not a doctor though and SSRI's affect every person differently so it might be best to contact the doctor."

Another scenerio is to come up with a reason to talk to the person. If you played soccer with someone, friend them on Facebook and then immediately message them to see if they want to get back together next week. Treat it like someone you didn't like, only friend them if you need something from them. It will make you seem cooler, like their friendship doesn't mean much to you.

If you intend to design a mug or a cupusing Sharpie markers and then use the mug or cup, any such designs must be at least one inch below the rim where a person's lips could touch.

Your GP can refer you for a psychotherapy assessment where you'll immediately get the support you require including counselling if they deem it necessary. Getting counselling via your GP is a bit trickier and generally CBT therapy which I believe is mainly for depression and anxiety.   If your GP tries to brush it off and throw tablets at you, insist on a referral or walk out and immediately book an appointment with a GP who will listen.

myfriendwantstoknow,338pfw,sp17fire,13,Mon Apr 20 15:21:32 2015 UTC,"I recently got drug tested for my new job and I had been smoking about 3-4 times a week and all weekend for the past 10 years. I STOPPED immediately, and started to chug water all day. I also started drinking detox tea, or dandelion tea (not sure if it actually did anything but I wanted to do anything I could). I then started eating foods with next to no fat, salads jacked up with carrots, celery, lettuce, cucumber, chicken, beans, etc. I also started biking about 30 miles a day with sweatpants and a sweatshirt (this was in july/aug) so I would be sweating my balls off and also getting rid of my fat.   Keep in mind I had 2 weeks before my test so I did have a little time. I just drank a shitload of water, ate very healthy (THC sticks to fat cells as you probably know) and was working out/sweating my ass off majorly every single day. Days that I didn't want to I just thought of how my new job was the next best stage of my life and I would kick my self in the ass if I didn't just go workout. I also biked because I hate running so much.   The weekend before my test I bought a drug test from Walgreens and I did test negative! However after reading reviews on the website of the test I bought I saw that someone passed that test but then failed their company mandated drug test. So I did buy one of those drinks from a company called MDT Solutions that you drink the day of your test to help you out.   I ended up taking the drink just to be safe, however I was pretty sure I was clean, I just didn't want to risk is. I ended up passing the test at the medical center and was in the clear. This is my advice, I know I had a longer time to cleanse my self, but bare in mind that I couldn't tell you the last time I had gone more than 3 days without getting stones in the past 10+ years.  Message me if you have any questions! Good luck friend!"
myfriendwantstoknow,338pfw,twoandonly,16,Mon Apr 20 22:49:28 2015 UTC,"Niacin isn't for cleansing.  Niacin is for adding yellow color and certain natural body-byproduct chemicals back into your urine to cover up massive over-hydration prior to a drug test. Basically, if you drink a couple gallons of water before your drug test in an effort to produce so much urine that the amount of chemicals detectable is almost nonexistent, your urine will be clear and that will set off a red flag at the testing facility. If you're going to try and ""purge"" before a drug test, you have to take supplements to make your urine appear normal.  This is a method that makes the rounds on /r/trees once a year or so. It is generally regarded as sound science and your best bet if you don't think you can get away with a urine substitute (synthetic or someone else's)."

Everything else is done in hopes of diluting or masking, both of which are crap shoots. Dilute too much and the lack of creatine tells them you've diluted and they'll make you wait until the next urge to urinate to get a sample, at which point you have no control over it. Masking or adulterating will result in the same thing. Your friend needs to increase his metabolism and avoid working out, depending on when his test is."
myfriendwantstoknow,338pfw,chonnes,10,Mon Apr 20 17:12:43 2015 UTC,"Working out increases your metabolism...  He should do cardio daily and minimize his sugar, starch and carbohydrate intake. Those are used for storing fats, so he needs to avoid those if he wants to burn fat during his work outs. Cardio will increase his metabolism so as he burns fat, he burns the THC metabolites in his fat cells.   Then he needs to drink a shit ton of water to flush those metabolites out of his system. For the most part, everything else you said is correct (although I would add that he could supplement with creatine in order to mask the dilution further).   If the friend does cardio to spark his metabolism, avoids sugars/starches/carbs to prevent fat storage (his diet should really be only chicken breast, vegetables and water), takes creatine and multivitamins (B vitamins will give the urine color - sites can reject samples that are too clear), and drinks enough water to dilute the color/contents and flush out the THC metabolites, then that's the most anyone can really do aside from liposuction lol.   Edit: This should be in the time prior to the test. The day of the test he should drink sugars because they prevent the liver from releasing the contents of fat cells into the body. If you're doing this in the time leading up you the test, it's bad because you want to be flushing out those fat contents. The day of, you want the liver to stop the fat cells from releasing so that there's less in the individual sample taken."
myfriendwantstoknow,338pfw,TuckerMcG,11,Mon Apr 20 17:36:18 2015 UTC,"Working out increases your metabolism   Yes it does. However, THC is fat soluble and stored in fat cells. Working out too close to a urine test will cause marijuana metabolites to be present in the bloodstream, hence why working out should NOT be done close to the UA. There are other variables to consider as well such as the friends weight, resting metabolism, frequency of use, health, hydration, etc."

myfriendwantstoknow,337k9j,Saldes,21,Mon Apr 20 13:59:54 2015 UTC,Your friend probably isn't going to get to feel any anytime soon if he's asking you questions like this.

myfriendwantstoknow,337k9j,Observerwwtdd,2,Tue Apr 21 20:35:59 2015 UTC,"The most important difference between your friend fondling a woman's boobs and fondling his own is that separateness of sensation that comes from touching someone else. Just as it will feel very different when said woman fondles his balls, which he has fondled before. It will also feel different for her than touching her own boobs, which she has, I assure you, touched herself. And yes, hers will have a bit more ""substance"" than his, pound for pound, but the effects of all this fondling will outweigh any individual aspect."

myfriendwantstoknow,335zf5,djcack,31,Sun Apr 19 22:20:17 2015 UTC,"No. Your friend didn't put a foot (or any other part) wrong. It sounds like the girl was unusually inexperienced, especially for this day and age.  It also sounds like she had people looking out for her after the fact. It's good to know they were there for her, but I wish - I started to say I wish they'd advised her to make the date with your friend a 2 couple or group thing, but I guess she had to be alone with a young man for the first time at some point.  Anyway, it says all kinds of nice things about your friend that he's worried about it so, but there's no way he could have predicted that situation.   OOps, meant also to say that you quitting your job was going way over and beyond, and for her to accept, much less expect such a thing makes me wonder if she might need (or have needed at that time) more help than even supportive friends could offer.  It is not realistic for any woman to suppose that any time a guy attempts to take a liberty and she declines, that he will give up his employment to spare her the distress of ever seeing him again. That her friends did not bring you both back to earth on that point makes me think that the whole bunch of you may have been a little bit lacking in the experience department.  FWIW, I am older than dust, and a ""no means no"" hardliner, and that would have been extreme even when I was a young girl!  Unless I've missed something really big, there really wasn't anything to see there. A guy made his move, the girl wasn't into it, end of story. This is not the stuff of which trauma is made, and if for her it was, then she did not need to be going on 2 person dates.  Nor is it the kind of incident that you should be agonizing over years after the fact."
myfriendwantstoknow,335zf5,TextofReason,11,Sun Apr 19 22:17:29 2015 UTC,"Your comment is extremely appreciated.  The job was shitty anyway, so that wasn't the end of the world.  It's just the thought of.. I don't know, that someone could feel so bad because of one's actions, irregardless of one's intentions.  But yeah, the guilt has stagnated with time."
myfriendwantstoknow,335zf5,cookiecutterbullshit,9,Sun Apr 19 23:02:34 2015 UTC,"You're telling me your friend QUIT HIS JOB over this? Your friend should know that he was under ABSOLUTELY ZERO obligation to do that.  Your friend needs to realize that, the more he ACTS guilty of something, the more he will appear to be guilty of something.   Your friend needs to take a strong stance and defend himself when or if the situation calls for it, because if not, he's opening himself up to however bad some random people want to fuck with him.  In the meantime, your friend should completely ignore the girl and anyone associated with her.  BTW look up affirmative/positive consent legislation. It basically changes ""no means no"" such that, if the (female) partner doesn't actually state that they want to have sex in no uncertain terms, then it's rape. It's called ""yes means yes"" because it's catchy and people think it's cute, when it's really just as much of a simplification as ""no means no"".  You're friend should know that ""yes means yes"" is NOT the case in ANY US state except CALIFORNIA."
myfriendwantstoknow,335zf5,Disingenuous_,4,Mon Apr 20 03:07:37 2015 UTC,"It happened in Sweden. The job was at a fast food joint, and he quit because he really didn't want to be subjugated to those kinds of rumors. How do you defend yourself against something like that? Word gets out and you're done for.   Since then there hasn't been any contact between the two of them, his girlfriend(she knows about it) lives in the same area as the girl in question, and he feels really anxious about the risk of seeing her on the street.   The other part, and this might be deemed irrelevant, is the background of my friend and the girl. She is a Swedish girl and he is of middle eastern descent, it just.. It's just.. In the public eye, it doesn't look good.   I wrote in the original post that he hasn't talked about it with anyone, that's not completely true. His girlfriend, and 2 friends are in the know. Both feel the same way as the posters here...  He really, with all of his heart, really appreciates all the answers here. Truly, if complete strangers, who have no personal connection to either party, can firmly agree that he didn't do anything creepy/wrong it's probably true."
myfriendwantstoknow,335zf5,Ttoctam,8,Mon Apr 20 08:58:51 2015 UTC,"If this is truly what happened, then your friend did nothing wrong. He made a move, she rejected your friend, it happens.   The fact that you still are thinking about it and she was so disgusted by your friend (to the point where they had to quit their job) makes me think your friend is lying though."
myfriendwantstoknow,335zf5,Crimefridge,11,Mon Apr 20 01:36:37 2015 UTC,"Your friend didn't do anything particularly wrong but that doesn't mean he did it all particularly right... It sounds like your friend lost inhibition to drugs and saw a greenlight that wasn't intended. He corrected at a good moment and shouldn't be ashamed. Just keep it in mind because it could have been worse.  Ignore the redpill pricks, your friend is no hero but he is by no means a villain. They both were victims of circumstance."
myfriendwantstoknow,335zf5,ImmaRussian,6,Mon Apr 20 06:36:19 2015 UTC,"If you said that it was her first time smoking pot, then yeah making a move under those pretenses is not cool.   She trusted your friend to guide her through that experience. Your friend was her psychedelic guardian, and he betrayed that trust.  To put this in context, if I was married to the person AND they gave prior consent before taking a hallucinogen for the first time, I still would not kiss, fondle, or have sex with them while they were under the influence during the time they are unfamiliar with the drug.  I still would be weary of making a move if someone cannot be understood sober enough to consent."
myfriendwantstoknow,335zf5,idknickyp,1 point,Mon Apr 20 08:57:00 2015 UTC,"He agrees, that's why this has bugged him for such a long time. He made a huge error of judgement when it came to the weed part, and he hasn't really forgiven himself for it.   This guy sees himself as a feminist ( yup I know what feminism means on reddit), he was raised by a single mother and most of his friends are girls. So when this happened it bordered on an existential crisis. He asked himself, for a long while, if he upheld those values and if he did, how could he make such a shitty mistake.  So yeah, he completely agrees with what you're saying and he should have known better."
myfriendwantstoknow,335zf5,NormSonOfAGunderson,3,Mon Apr 20 09:26:47 2015 UTC,"is my friend a total creepy piece of shit?   Well, no, but he did make a mistake.  Girl comes over to smoke. Girl and guy go into bedroom to lay down next to each other. It wouldn't be unreasonable for either of them to think that something more might follow that. So yeah, it is a little weird that she was that surprised, but regardless, your friend did mess up one little thing that made everything go so badly: He assumed that's where it was going instead of communicating.  It was a reasonable assumption, but he should have checked in verbally before kissing her. This is an incredibly unfortunate situation, but it doesn't sound like your friend made any moral judgment errors. He needs to improve his understanding of 'informed consent' a little though.  Implicit consent is fine when you're sober and there's a logical lead-in to whatever is happening, but whenever anyone is in a compromised state of mind, as a general rule you should never try to do anything without explicit verbal consent.  Unless we're missing part of the story here though, I don't really understand why he would have to quit his job for her. That part is really strange.  Reading back through this though; I feel like this part requires some elaboration:  ""He went after her and tried to persuade her to stay and explain what she meant. She wouldn't have any of it, and she wanted to leave. He tried to at least offer her some water as it was summer and she was pretty high, but she declined.""  He didn't just let her leave in peace, and how did he try to persuade her? She probably felt trapped in this awful situation where the guy she just went to smoke with wouldn't stop trying to ask why she didn't want him and wouldn't just let her leave when she wanted to. It sounds like this is the part that really made her freak out.   Look mang, I can totally understand wanting to talk about it, not knowing why someone rejected you can be a really awful feeling, but sometimes you just have to let someone go and accept that you might never know what was going through their head or what they meant."
myfriendwantstoknow,335zf5,brauchen,1 point,Mon Apr 20 09:05:16 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying. He didn't constrain her or even touch her in any fashion after she got out of the bed. He tried to verbally get her to stay and clear things up. Mind you, he was in a state of distress as well. It was a hot summer day, and he honestly didn't want her to leave dehydrated and high. It's a shitty  combination, but as the story goes she didn't want to have anything of it. So she left.   I want to clarify that he didn't stay in her way, or in any way try to physically hinder her path. In fact, when she tried to leave he was behind her, and not in front blocking or anything of the like.   EDIT: He quit because he was scared shitless of rumors and the like, but also if not more so,  that he couldn't work with someone who constantly saw him as something that he really didn't want see himself as. I mean, something that he really can't see himself as.   And the last part, he totally gets that. Girls are hit and miss and you can't really do anything about it. The romantic/sexual aspect and where it could lead isn't really what bothers him. That is, what could have been etc. It's the part of he himself trying to get over this.. This stamp or view of himself as a creepy piece of shit. To truly evaluate the moral aspect of what happened that day.   And trust me, he has tried to let it go. For the first couple of months he thought about it over and over  every day, and with nobody's second opinion it really was a horrible agonising mind game. With time, it's gotten better.. But the comments here have helped, and the few friends who now know about it and expressed their opinions has also lightened the burden."

myfriendwantstoknow,335zf5,sssyjackson,2,Mon Apr 20 09:00:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think he did anything wrong.  Trying to kiss someone that willingly came on a date with you and laid in your bed with you seems perfectly logical.  And then the girl was probably embarrassed and said she was disgusted just so she didn't have to face the embarrassment at work.  It happens a lot for people in that age range.  It's scary because if she let him go a bit farther, who knows what she might have said and what the people helping her might have thought.  Sucks he quit his job."

From a platonic friend, being kissed while being under the influence of drugs could be nightmarish.   Your friend should never again kiss someone without a clear signal that it's okay. Grabbing someone's ass like that is not okay either.   Your friend was stoned off his tits, so he was not in his normal state of mind. But weed can't make people do things that aren't already part of them. Your friend should realise that grabbing someone's bum and kissing someone is really, really not okay without consent. And just never do it again."

Tramadol products in excessive doses, either alone or in combination with other CNS depressants, including alcohol, are a cause of drug-related deaths. Patients should be cautioned about the concomitant use of tramadol products and alcohol because of potentially serious CNS additive effects of these agents. Because of its added depressant effects, tramadol should be prescribed with caution for those patients whose medical condition requires the concomitant administration of sedatives, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, antidepressants, or other CNS depressant drugs. Patients should be advised of the additive depressant effects of these combinations.  Serious potential consequences of overdosage with Ultram® (tramadol hydrochloride) tablets are central nervous system depression, respiratory depression and death. Some deaths have occurred as a consequence of the accidental ingestion of excessive quantities of tramadol alone or in combination with other drugs.

myfriendwantstoknow,332szw,cursh14,7,Sun Apr 19 06:27:48 2015 UTC,Your friend should know that it takes time to feel the full effects after inhalation. About 10 - 15 minutes sometimes. You should tell him to put more time between each hit so he can gauge how high he is.

When they reach that point of perfect stoned-ness, its too late because there is an extra toke or three waiting to kick in.  Even worse, when they get to that level and then overestimate their power level and take even more."
myfriendwantstoknow,332szw,brinz1,4,Sun Apr 19 02:47:27 2015 UTC,Wait a couple fifteen minutes after every hit.   It takes about a quarter of an hour for the THC and other cannabinoids to kick in fully.
myfriendwantstoknow,332szw,MaleFascistAdvice,5,Sun Apr 19 10:36:16 2015 UTC,"I wish my tolerance was still like that.   What is your friend smoking out of? If a piece, take 2 medium-sized hits and hold them each for about 7 seconds. If that gets him too high then try it with just 1 hit. If your friend is using a bong, tell him to stop using a bong because your friend will get high af every time. A bong + low tolerance = a bad time.   After a while of getting used to that 1 hit high, your friend should try 2 or 3 just get acclimated to how high it gets him. Eventually your friend will either get used to it and enjoy it or his tolerance will go up. Win/win."

myfriendwantstoknow,32z07x,ArizonaThrowaway1,28,Fri Apr 17 22:16:44 2015 UTC,"If he's caught he will almost definitely be charged with trespassing on government property.  Depending on what he has with him he might drift into the area of tampering with the water supply, a federal crime punishable by up to 20 years (this depends on how hard a potential arresting officer wants to be on him.  It's easy to throw around charges like that).  If you're friend hasn't done much climbing before he may be surprised at how hard it can be to climb a 80'-120' ladder (that's a general range for the height of the catwalk) for the first time all in one go.  His hands wouldn't be used to gripping that much and his forearms might wear out with no way to rest but to cling to the ladder differently.  This problem becomes even worse if he realizes halfway up that he has unpleasant feelings about heights and starts grabbing the rungs with a death grip.  He should definitely try to climb with his body as close to vertical as possible, letting his legs do most of the work rather than pulling himself up with his arms.  This would minimize how tired he would get and keep him from being too sore the next day.  There are the obvious issues of falling with the standard repercussions of long falls.  The catwalk is typically smaller than it looks (<3' wide, railing only 3.5' tall) and if there are antennas or other equipment up there it gets even tighter.  While it's reasonable to assume he can handle the climb and walking around without a problem, it still only takes one wrong move to fall to a quick death or excruciating wait as the ambulance come to collect him and his shattered legs/back.  It's always helpful to remember that.  On the plus side, he's in for a beautiful view even if he's just overlooking a shitty little town.  It's amazing what a little change in elevation can do to change your view."

myfriendwantstoknow,32z07x,manofconsequence,17,Sat Apr 18 00:55:38 2015 UTC,"In that case, trespassing at the worst.  Depends on the officer.  It also requires him to get caught in the first place."

If he's in reasonable shape and can climb a ladder for a while then tell him to be safe, go slow and take his time. Always keep 2 (3 is even better) points of contact on something sturdy at all times.  If he has access to it, especially considering you said he'll be taking longer time lapses, have him look in to a climbing harness (cheap used one on Craiglist or borrow from a friend) and a few feet of rope attached to a climbing carabiner. He could probably borrow this all or come up with the $20-30 to build it himself and get the peace of mind while waiting at the top of the tower for the perfect shot. Tell him not to forget to take his eyes off the camera and enjoy the view himself."

In some philosophies and ideologies it's assumed that we are all deities, gods… what really matters, here, is how this belief affects his life and the way he behaves. I'm pretty sure there are and have been very many completely decent and even very good people, on most accounts, who believed they are or were gods.  However, if your friend is inclined to seriously consider the possibility that he should see a doctor… I would infer from this that maybe this means he probably should.  If complex emotions confuse him… well, yes, a psychologist might help, but I don't think that's all that unusual. Everybody could stand to be helped by psychologists, probably.  So, my advice to your friend would be… to try some sessions with a good psychologist and see where that leads him.

Likely - the tower/storage place will look at it, and go to court.  They'll present a bill to the court, and compare it to the value of the car.    The court will notify the car owner of record - asking them to pay the bill.    If the owner doesn't produce, the court will turn over the car to the towing & storage folks - letting them sell it for scrap or whatever they can get. The original owner will be on the hook for any expenses and any money left on the bill.   The court may even seize tax refunds or assist the towing/storage folks in putting a lien on the owner's other property .     The tickets and any other charges involved will also go to the court - which might issue arrest warrants and add court fees, late charges, and other stuff to the original charge(s).

myfriendwantstoknow,32vh9k,rewardiflost,13,Fri Apr 17 02:05:42 2015 UTC,"Well, it happened recently to mylittle brother.   He let the plates & registration go without being renewed.    He also left his car parked overnight in a neighborhood where that's a ticket.   The original tickets issued were $75 - overnight parking,  $60 - abandoned vehicle / not registered.      Towing was $125, storage started at $30/ day. He went looking for the car on the first day - but needed to come up with $100 penalty + $60 to register car;  $60+$75 to pay tickets, and documentation of both before paying the $155 to the towing company.   He couldn't get the $450 right away, so he gave up in frustration.   After a month, the court contacted him - he now owed $30 x 30 days  (900) on top of the original $450.   His car was valued at about $2000 book value, so he let them proceed against him in court.    By the time all this went to court, he owned another month.   After they sold the car at auction for $1700 (below value),   he owed the towing company  another $200.  ( approx 60 days X $30 and the $125 tow..   -less the $1700 they received. ) He also owes the State of New Jersey  (or the city for the tickets)   .. $135 for the tickets, plus late fees ( another $48),  and they've suspended his license for non-payment of the tickets. He'll need to pay a $100 (or $150) re-instatement after he pays the tickets off.   Your friend's case will vary.. what are the towing & daily charges,  how long does it take before the court will rule and allow them to seize the title.. (or will friend sign over title?)..  plus costs for the ticket/violations.  Deduct part of the value of the car.. they'll auction it off, and anyone can buy the car.. even the original owner.    If the price is amazing (not gonna happen) - owner is entitled to any refund;  if the price is lower than the bill,    owner has to pay the towing & storage folks."

myfriendwantstoknow,32vrvl,PM_ME_YOUR_WEED_PLZ,7,Fri Apr 17 03:42:47 2015 UTC,"I used to work for the #1 collection agency for Verizon (and all other major cell providers) in the US.    Once it is sent to collections, it will impact your credit. However, once it gets to the second collection agency, you can settle the account in full, for ~50% of the bill.  This agency will start around 90%, but stick to your guns, and they will go lower. Verizon will, in most cases, let you return to their service after you settle an account for a lower balance.  PROTECT YOURSELF! Before paying any agreed upon amount, demand a ""WTASIF"" letter from the collection agency. (Willing To Accept Settlement In Full) this shows the agreement that you have made.  Also demand that immediately after payment, you should receive a Settled In Full letter, showing that you have closed the account for the agreed amount. (Via email for both.) That protects you in case the agency doesn't properly close the account, and the amount that was unpaid due to the settlement offer gets sold to another agency.    Hope this helps!  If you have more questions, I have more answers!"

They sent it to collections. I ignored it for about two years. I got server by the court. By then the bill had accumulated another 1,000 USD in fees. I settled to pay the full amount of 2,500 USD. It took me another 4 or 5 years to climb out of credit dungeon. I could have fought it out with the collection agency and have them settle for less than the original amount. Instead I ended up paying almost double."

The country your vessel is registered under has the right to enforce their laws on you.  Unless you renounce citizenship and build your own vessel that is not registered with any nation, you're still subject to the laws of some country.  And if you do that, any country that comes along can do whatever they hell they want if they find you, because you lack the protection of any sovereign nation.  There might be a way to manage it, but it'd be tricky.  Maybe legally take a body of someone who died (not through murder) for a burial at sea, on a vessel registered to some nation that happens to lack laws specifically outlawing the consumption of human flesh, outside of any nation's sphere of influence and eat it?  Even then, the country of your citizenship might try to apply their laws to you."

Which they most likely would, even without cannibalistic practices, unless you had a strong and strict plan benefitting hundreds of thousands of people without upsetting some other nation, which is also impossible.  So yes, you are under no laws forbidding you from eating human meat, but on the other hand, a 5 man military team from any nation in the world coming at you would be like nuking a baby for yawning.

You aren't getting actual Adobe Photoshop for free unless you download a cracked copy of it. You risk downloading trojans, viruses, etc when you do that. I'm sure there will be 20 people that downvote me for saying that, but I've seen it first hand. When you download cracked software you genuinely have no idea what's bundled with it.   That said, go to your friendly torrent site whichever it may be, find the version, download the torrent and open it up in a torrent client. Transmission is a popular one for OSX.

Using a VPN means that any internet activity will only trace back to the VPN and not to your friend.  Without a VPN most likely all that will happen if she doesn't is her ISP will forward an E-mail from some company HBO hired to track torrent downloaders.

They'll ask a few questions, and then, if they think he may have it, they'll refer him to a psychiatrist and/or counselor. For the add they may also run some blood work. If it's the latter, then he can just schedule an appointment with a psychiatrist. Also, make sure it's a psychiatrist, and not a psychologist, since only the former can prescribe medication. Additionally, the psychiatrist may also require blood work as well.  Source: I've had recurring depression with both types of insurances through the years."

myfriendwantstoknow,31zs9o,blapenstein,3,Fri Apr 10 02:17:52 2015 UTC,"Has your friend seen an obgyn about this?  I used to go into shock every single month from mine. To put it in perspective: when I herniated a disc in my neck at work, I kept working. Didn't even take a break. Stayed an extra hour. I've had anesthesia wear off during a root canal, and they couldn't administer more, I was too bruised. So we kept going. I have a very high tolerance for pain. But my doctor wouldn't prescribe opiates.   In my experience, validated by other friends and doctors when asked: combine different NSAIDs. I used to take two ibuprofen and two acetaminophen together, and most of the time, that dulled it enough I could go to work, or stay at work, so long as I wasn't opening.  I have horrible pain in my hip, and it was more intense when it first started, and I was taking 4 Aleve at a time. I can't recommend it long term, 24 hours a day like I was having to do it, but as an option for two days out of the month, it's fine. Just eat something when you...she takes the pills so she doesn't burn a hole in her gut.   Another option: take the hormone pill continuously, and only take the placebo week once a quarter or whenever her body catches onto it and she has breakthrough. I have been doing this for years now. She should talk to her prescribing physician/OB about it. It's common and totally safe.   Another thing to consider: when I totally cut sugar out of my diet, the cramps stopped dead in their tracks. I don't know if that was a coincidence, or whether the inflammatory nature of sugar caused the problems, but I don't care, all I know is they stopped, and my periods got much lighter. This is when I was not on the pill at all.   She might also ask for a muscle relaxer instead. Carisoprodal is a good one, better known as soma. It is not for long-term use, but may help bad cramps, depending on the cause.   She might want to see if what is going on is endometriosis. This can be a cause of bad cramps. I was never checked for it, but I probably should have been at some point.   I hope your friend finds some relief. Opiates may not be the best path forward, but living in pain sucks, even if it's a temporary thing on a recurring schedule.   Oh, and if ALL else fails, if your friend is in a medical marijuana/legal weed state, that's also a great solution to the problem. A friend of mine got baked when she had her IUD placed, and again when it had dislodged. Totally cramp free, once the high came on. For secret reasons, she had to wait until she got home, but yeah. It works."

myfriendwantstoknow,31y4mh,waterboy100,4,Thu Apr 9 05:39:33 2015 UTC,You can open a dispute based on the fact that the seller misrepresented the condition of the item - this is a legitimate reason and bypasses the seller's choice to not accept returns.   I'm a longtime seller and buyer on eBay and have had this happen on both sides of the fence.  I bought an item that was significantly different than the description and received a refund despite the seller not accepting returns.  I ALSO listed an item that was used and tried my best to detail the wear on the item - apparently the buyer didn't read thoroughly enough and was surprised to receive an item with some wear.  I had set it to not accept returns but was forced to refund the buyer by eBay.  eBay is a buyers market and they will usually side with the buyer on most disputes.  Tell your friend to open a case - they'll very likely receive a refund after returning the item to the seller.

Some days everything will be normal but out of nowhere a thought about something and it will send me spiraling down. When thoughts like that happen what has helped me and some other friends of mine it to make a complete 180 on the thought itself. For example, If I think about something where if I keep thinking about it I will inevitably cry I instead think about something that will make me laugh or smile. All in all it's mind over matter.

As soon as it hits the back of your throat you swallow all the liquid. If you can't swallow all the liquid, take smaller shots.   Opening your throat is more so for chugging beer.  Edit: Capitals"

Oh man that one time I did a 151 bacardi shot, and all my other friends got prepped with lime wedges...

As for the burns that's untrue, although it may seem like alcohol gives you a severe burning sensation it takes quite a bit of contact with the substance to actually cause burns on one's throat or skin.

The mixture dilutes it a little bit, then chug that chaser after.  When I'd do it correctly, I really wouldn't feel the burn at all.  Every now and then, though, you'll get a shot that just totally goes down wrong and burns the whole way down.  /u/GotStomped described it well though, you kind of have to ""throw"" it into the back of your throat almost."

myfriendwantstoknow,31u6wn,gioraffe32,4,Wed Apr 8 17:27:44 2015 UTC,"This is why people choke or cough when they take shots. Don't throw it back, you tend to swallow air with it that way and it makes it burn. Just pour the entire contents of the shot into your mouth, then close it and swallow it. Try not to gulp in air with it and you'll be fine. It's best to drink what you like too. My favorite is a Spaghetti Western (Half Jack, and half Sambucca). Good luck!"

That tends to burn, and it could go down the wrong pipe.   I think I generally kind of let it well up on my tongue for a fraction of a second, so I can get a good solid swallow. This also lets some saliva mix with it to cool it down.  If it tastes too gross to do that,  chill it, spend a little more on your liquor, or try a different kind."

I drink shots all the time - if it's vodka you have to get it really cold, and if it's whiskey I have it at room temp. If it's tequila then there's salt and lemon. If it's kahlua then some ice is ok.  But all these things I would only ever drink because they're delicious. Sure I might drink a fuck of a lot of it in one sitting, but I'm not an animal. Nor am I a kid anymore - maybe you haven't, but I've evolved past making rocket-fuel from skimming something from every bottle in my dad's liquor cabinet then drinking it in the park at midnight as fast as I can so I don't taste it. These days I go a store, like an adult, and hand over actual money, like an adult, for spirits that are fun to drink, like an adult.  Seriously, even if you're thirty years old, if you're too immature to understand what ""Don't drink to get drunk"" means then you're too immature to be drinking. Getting drunk is great. Attempting to get drunk without having to go through the process of drinking / tasting alcoholic drinks is fucked."

myfriendwantstoknow,31u6wn,Naught,-5,Wed Apr 8 14:26:41 2015 UTC,"I assure you I'm doing shots just fine.  Alcohol is tasteless. It's the way it's presented that has a flavour.  How old are you, really? Are you in high school? Have you ever actually drunk even medium quality straight vodka poured from a bottle taken from the freezer? It's got totally different flavours. Have you ever actually sat down with a good sized tumbler of scotch to watch the sun set and really think about the tastes you're drinking?   ""Many people don't like the taste of alcohol, but enjoy being buzzed/drunk. ""    No. They don't. In real life, outside of high school, when you actually get to choose good quality booze and not just put up with whatever you can get from the discount rack with your fake ID, people love the taste of alcohol.  I'm aware that I'm being deliberately condescending, whether or not you forgive me for that is your choice. And I'm aware that there's such a thing as drinking heavy at a party as opposed to drinking socially in your own home, but even then you should really only drink because you like the flavour.  I was first taught that by a blind drunk man, and I thought he was full of shit for the longest time. It's true though."

First off, alcohol is demonstrably not tasteless. I have no idea how you could come to that conclusion. That is baffling. The kind of alcohol you'd take as a shot contains Ethanol, which no sane person could claim is tasteless. Here is scientific proof: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10940547  Further, the arrogance it takes to speak for the entirety of adults on the planet is pretty staggering. No adults dislike the taste of alcohol, huh? You realize ""many"" doesn't mean ""the majority of,"" right? I'm trying to find a way to interpret what you've said that doesn't just mean you're crazy.   you should really only drink because you like the flavour   Oh, and now you're the moral authority on what is right and wrong when it comes to drinking?

Its not unreasonable for parents of a 17 year old to have expectations along the lines of 'hey, don't have your boyfriend in your room at 2:30am'. Some parents feel a certain amount of responsibility to give their children a good start in life, and its not unheard of for teenagers to fall pregnant and this can have a detrimental impact on the quality of life moving forward.

myfriendwantstoknow,31s4wy,Ran4,15,Wed Apr 8 00:55:30 2015 UTC,"Its not unreasonable for parents to have expectations of their children, I dont see how suggesting as much makes me an asshole. Interesting thought.   Children have responsibilities to their parents, in the same way parents have responsibilities towards their children. Having a cohesive family life where everyone acts in the best interest of the group is actually beneficial for all. A teenager acknowledging authority and adhering to reasonable rules shows a level of maturity that seems absent from your assessment of the situation.   I never said it was not ok for teenagers to have sex, and I dont think the OP said it was purely about sex. We dont actually know what her parents thoughts on having sex is. It may be entirely acceptable to have sex, at a reasonable hour of the night. I dont think a 17 year old (who, in the best case scenario should still be attending school) should be staying up so late, as it is widely accepted that adequate sleep improves performance.   But this gets back to my point about teenagers not always possessing adequate perspective to understand. Many times as a teenager, we tend to focus on things we believe are 'omg super important mom!' which in the long run really don't matter. Kids make mistakes, good parents help kids reduce mistakes by passing on wisdom from having lived for many more years.   There's a balance that needs to be struck. Sometimes you can allow mistakes to happen, as they can have a more profound impact on teaching children life lessons. But being a responsible parent is about knowing which mistakes serve a purpose, and which need more hands on guidance. I'm not preaching abstinence, or suggesting that teenage sex shouldn't exist, but merely speaking of a  wider set of parental guidance motives, and expressing the expectation that children should be respecting the boundaries set up by their parents.  Due to the lack of context, I don't get the sense that the parents are being unreasonable, but others may disagree. Still, there is always room for negotiation- but some teenagers do not posses that skill, and merely yell and scream to get their own way.   That is slightly irrelevant- given the context of my comment was in response to the wording of the comment preceding that, which was phrased in such a way as to not just seek clarification of rules (which is totally ok) but with the 'grow some balls' seemed to be implying, the child should openly rebel against what is perceived to be completely unfair. This is stereotypical behaviour for some teenagers. I wouldn't trust a teenager with that attitude to make sensible decisions. Its not something that instills me with faith in their decision making process."

myfriendwantstoknow,31s4wy,jcb5150,5,Wed Apr 8 00:04:38 2015 UTC,"Rather than think in terms of ""punishment,"" I'd suggest you consider the possibility that at 17, you might have grown up a little bit past the whole thing of your mom constructing some artificial ""consequence"" of you having done something that was dangerous, stupid, or simply displeased her.   Because she's the parent.  You and your mom are not a democracy.  But maybe those days are over. Maybe you are ready now for real consequences, even for things that are not dangerous, nor, of themselves, particularly stupid.  It could be that you're now old enough to show respect for your mom by talking to her about subjects she finds pleasant, and when you're in her house, doing things she enjoys.  What conversation about this topic would please her most now?  When you're 30, if she doesn't like the person you're seeing, that's what you'll do, so you might as well start practicing now.  You may not be living in her house a whole lot longer, but while you are, it is her house - as it will be when you're 30.  Granted, at 30 you will hopefully have more resources than you do now, but the general principles will be the same, and will still be so when you're 80!  How will you handle having an SO your mom dislikes then?  What will she want to hear about that SO then?  See? Not ""punishment"" as such, but consequences? Definitely! Real ones. Our relationships with our parents change as we grow up.   If you are ready, you will figure it out. If not, then be straight with moms. Let her know you still need her to be the one to construct artificial consequences for you."

myfriendwantstoknow,31s4wy,CarpeKitty,3,Wed Apr 8 04:19:47 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of constructive consequences. If I were your parent, I would view your behavior as a breach of trust and a sign of disrespect. I'd make you volunteer at least 20 hours of your time at a homeless shelter or soup kitchen. If you get to talking to the people there, you'll probably find that many of them had horrible home lives and ran away to the streets as teens. This ""punishment"" benefits the community and may help you put your situation in perspective. If you need service hours for scholarships or something, it'll help you rack those up, too.  Best of luck, and be safe.  EDIT: Wow, why the downvotes? Is it the 20 hours or the helping the community part that everyone finds so objectionable?"

myfriendwantstoknow,31s4wy,mongolrainbows2,2,Tue Apr 7 20:09:28 2015 UTC,why do her parents hate him?
myfriendwantstoknow,31s4wy,ntermation,3,Tue Apr 7 20:44:34 2015 UTC,"Long story.  He came long right around the time she broke up with her old boyfriend, the one who the parents adored. She wasn't happy with him but met new guy, current boyfriend. Her mother thought he was a step down from the old boyfriend so automatically, wasn't well liked.   About 6 months later, things between my friend's boyfriend and her were going really well. He comes from a broken home so he worked most of the time, he was also a pilot so he also flew when he wasn't working to gain flight hours. He moved/got kicked out at 18, but he still made time for her, however, not enough time in her mother's mind.  Part of making time involved seeing one another without parents knowing, this includes the first time they got caught at night. After that, there was no positive feeling towards him from her parents.  So now it's second semester of senior year and he didn't have money for college so he joined the air force. She's already in University as well as finishing high school. Her parents don't want him coming over, and they don't want them to go out on dates either so it's next to impossible for one of them to see each other- it's a very stressful time for both of them and they agree to take some time off from one another in order to deal with things. But, like any relationship, taking time off is easier said than done so there was a small rough patch. Seeing her daughter in distress the hatred had grown even more. When they decided to get back together, she wanted things to stay quiet so her parents didn't find out right away-- in order to let some bad feelings pass-- however, her mom found out and is now even more upset because they were ""sneaking around"" her.   Now, she has just caught him in her room again-- and so, the hatred grows"

The form measuring station MarForm MMQ 400 now offers the possibility to measure extra long workpieces. The workpieces to be tested can be up to 900 mm long and weigh 40 kg. Production plants in the precision mechanics industry can therefore now also measure long workpieces automically, quickly and precisely - just as this proven form measuring station has done in the past.  Extra long and narrow precision workpieces can be precisely and quickly tested on the form measuring station „MarForm MMQ 400“ to determine their form and surface tolerances. The proven and stable form measuring station of the application specialst Mahr is suitable, for example, for workpieces such as gear shafts or stepped shafts up to a length of 900 mm and a weight of up to 40 kg. Thanks to the proven Mahr technology, there are no compromises and concessions in accuracy with workpiece lengths and weights like these. The accuracy lies in the sub-µm range. This enables the specified quality parameters for roundness, flatness, straightness, coaxiality or run-out, surface parameters Ra and Rz and contour features such as radii and distances to be reliably adhered to. Especially when measuring shafts, Mahr offers with the MarForm MMQ 400 evaluation of diameter deviations as well.  Mahr is the market leader for reference form testers and offers the option for extra long workpieces on its proven form measuring station MarForm MMQ 400. Manufacturing plants profit from the field-proven advantages of this measuirng system. The customer receives a completely automatic machine. This concretely means that the alignment and setting of the workpiece as well as the complete measuring procedure take place fully automatically - during the measuring run, the measuring head is automatically brought into the correct position at the prespecified measuring location. This reduces operator influences on the measuring process, the measuring certainty is increased and the process costs are lowered. And with the unique positioning speed of the formtester of up to 100 mm/sec., the MarForm MMQ 400 really saves you time. In only one setting, form and location tolerances as well as surface and contour features, the diameter deviation and the lead/twist is exactly measured and documented with the motorized probe „T7W“, as the measuring station offers the innovative lead measurement in the second generation, that is particularly important when testing gear shafts and for leak testing.   Thanks to the well-known MarWin Software AdvancedForm V4 with its comfortable learn programming with assistant function, extensive measuring programs for workpieces are also quickly learned and simply created. With a mouse click, the workpiece is positioned, aligned and the measurement started. The operator realiably steers the form measuring station with this software.    With the MarForm MMQ 400, Mahr offers a unique performance scope for the testing of form and location, roughness, contour and diameters on long shafts with only one measuring machine."

myfriendwantstoknow,31livj,the_singular_anyone,6,Mon Apr 6 05:44:55 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen (and experienced), mostly the copyright infringement enforcement is done on an inter-corporate level.  One invested corporation (say, Time Warner) actually helps seed a movie they own, and reaps IP addresses that connect to them. Then, they send Cease-and-Desists to the ISPs that own the IPs in question, and the ISPs pass them on to the consumers.   Regardless of agency, I'd imagine the feds would only become actually concerned were you one of the mega-users that seeds 15+ big-name torrents at once. They've got much bigger fish to fry, especially given the volume of people that engage in piracy."
myfriendwantstoknow,31livj,HeresCyonnah,2,Mon Apr 6 05:50:59 2015 UTC,"I just meant that when they do do something, it's the FBI, but yeah, usually no one gives a crap, but those who do get sued, get sued for waaaaaaaay too much."

myfriendwantstoknow,31livj,jibcage,4,Mon Apr 6 19:37:07 2015 UTC,"Your friend shouldn't be worried about the FBI as much as people monitoring the torrents your friend seeds and sending takedown notices. (Anyone with the torrent file can see that your friend is seeding).  I would suggest that your friend try to get into a private tracker like What.CD. There is an interview process, or you can get an invite from somebody that you know. From there, your friend might try getting up a few member classes on the site in order to get an invite from other private trackers that do TV and movies. (What.CD is music and software only, though they do have some ebooks.) It's a great community and the torrents are always perfectly organized. Your friend will never get a takedown notice from using a private tracker: you have to log in to view the site, so any ol' schmuck can't just download the torrent and see who's seeding!  tl;dr: join a private tracker."

If your friend is really worried about his ISP monitoring his connection he should look into using a VPN service. It wouldn't really matter what site your friend uses if the FBI (or more likely a copyright agent) is collecting information from the torrent swarms directly which is how they do it.

myfriendwantstoknow,31lt2e,SirNoName,5,Mon Apr 6 13:02:03 2015 UTC,"Public places work well for business, depending on the volume of goods being traded. For these, a truck loaded with the goods, parked in the parking lot and then an exchange of the keys works well.  Cameras are probably the biggest concern, but most public establishments don't keep digital copies of their surveillance for more than 72 hours (some up to a week). Obviously a bank lobby is going to keep better security records than a Denny's.  Gas stations and other high crime businesses are probably going to have higher def, longer stored surveillance data. Coffee houses, libraries, restaurants and bars are much better suited to business, especially bars due the level of light.  Your friend is right to be weary of abandoned and/or isolated places. It sticks out as a place to do crime, it's easy to find evidence at a crime scene that isn't disturbed by routine traffic and investigators have techniques to figure out where people are going anyways.  Cops find your friend is going to an abandoned warehouse every month on the same day is going to corroborate a case better than a visit to a trip to O'Charley's on the same day every month. They can go there a week after something happened and likely have no video evidence, no physical evidence, no witnesses (since nobody is watching you eat and literally hundreds of people came and went on that day)."

myfriendwantstoknow,31hlug,TerkRockerfeller,8,Sun Apr 5 03:51:20 2015 UTC,"1.) download bittorrent or an equivalent. The legality here is like how,  officially, you're only supposed to use bongs for tobacco. Officially, you're only supposed to share files that you have appropriate licensing for.  2.) download a .torrent file from somewhere. Magnet sites, as they are called, are also technically allowed a lot of places, since they're not hosting the files, just acting as signposts to guide people to other people who have the file. In the places they're not allowed, it just so happens that the servers are hosted in places where those laws don't apply. careful, though. Laws still apply to the end user.  3.) add the .torrent file to your torrent client. in bittorrent, navigate to 'file>add torrent'. The .torrent file doesn't actually contain the movie/book/etc that you're trying to download, it merely serves as a sort of ID that says 'Hey, guys! I'm looking for a file, does anyone have ______?'  4.) once the file has been added, you have become part of a network of peers. At this point, if you don't have the appropriate license, you've begun breaking the law. If the downloading hasn't begun, right click on it and make it start.  5.) You should see a number labeled 'Seeds/Peers'. this tells you how many people have the file you're looking for and are willing to share parts of it with you.  6.) now, just wait for the download to complete. depending on how many seeders there are, it might take a while.  7.) once you've finished downloading the file, don't forget to seed so other people can get it."

Don't want to go into details, but my coworker torrented Dallas buyers club last year and had legal action taken against him by the copyright owners. All in all, it cost him $3800 out of pocket for the settlement. If they decide to take legal action, you basically have no defense and a settlement is best case scenario.  For my opinion, I don't see it as a victimless crime. Most people in the industry work hard to contribute to the whole process. If torrenting takes away a lot of the cash flow, then those people lose their jobs. You're not just taking money away from rich superstars, but the large group of people that contribute to a movie/album/book being released.

myfriendwantstoknow,31ex1b,Jaaacck,22,Sat Apr 4 13:33:02 2015 UTC,"Potentially the complete opposite. He doesn't ""feel"" the effects anymore because that is his new baseline. The good feelings are gone and his body is now dependent on cigarettes for its normal balance. Quitting will now not be the ""lack of feeling a (positive) effect"", it might actually get more unpleasant as withdrawl kicks in. What could well happen is your friend quits for a week, then takes ""just one drag"" and it will feel great (of course) and he will want to start again.  Also, it's extremely likely that even though he hasn't changed strength, he's been habitually and unconsciously using his e-cigarette more so he's taking in more total nicotine. With e-cigarettes, this is extremely common, and dosing for someone trying to quit is difficult.  Some e-cigarettes have been found to have carcinogenic chemicals in their composition. In addition, even straight-up nicotine is not really good for you. Quitting is always a good idea, and the sooner your friend quits, the better and the easier it will be.  Quitting smoking can be difficult, but there are a lot of resources that can make it significantly easier. Your friend can get medical assistance for this, and insurance will often pay for the patch or for gum. There are doctors who specialize in this because there is nuance to it. Your friend can also quit smoking on their own, but shouldn't be afraid to ask for help. Your friend can ask me for further details."

For comparison, I vape 18mg and it's comparable to smoking a heavy cigarette in a sitting. With vaporizing it's harder to notice the effects of nicotine, mostly because alot of vapers constantly have nicotine in their bloodstream due to how convenient it is. If he goes 8-10-12 hours without using his ecig, he'll definitely feel it. If your friend is trying to quit completely, start vaping lower nicotine, or nic free juice."

In addition, slow quitting doesnt show good results either, is a possibility though. Best long-term results are achieved by joining a peer support group while quitting or having accompanying behavioural therapy.  TLDR: If your friend wants to quit, ecigs or regular cigs, he should get some psychological support."

You can break down the latex in a condom enough to make it ineffective with just a few days of typical wallet wear.   Many young men stick one in their wallet just in case they need one in an emergency, and of course it stays in there for months -- so, when the emergency arises, they're screwed in several different ways."

Anywhere you'd keep a delicate piece of paper that you wanted to keep a long time.  Sock drawers are good.  The refrigerator is perfect, but you'd get odd looks if you had roommates.  A purse is ideal.    I used the drawer in my bedside table when I was in the habit of needing one, and I kept a supply in the drawer in her bedside table as well.  That leaves only those times when you're going to another person's bedroom and you haven't had the conversation or the comfort level to make arrangements beforehand -- and in those circumstances, you gotta improvise.  I suggest avoiding those circumstances.  Get comfortable enough to talk pragmatically about sex with someone before you stick it; that's my philosophy."

If you want to stay completely in line don't use any real news agency. Hell there's a ton of youtube chanels that are just music press, interviewing bands at festivals and stuff. I say it's worth a shot. But just be aware they may not care if you really are press or not, and tell you to buy a ticket anyway. Try calling their ticketing office and ask what you will need for press access."
myfriendwantstoknow,31b1lp,nitengale329,18,Fri Apr 3 15:11:09 2015 UTC,"Edit: Posted the long blurb below because I misread and thought you were asking how to go about doing so. Gonna leave it anyway incase anyone is interested. On repercussions though, they vary. One outlet caught me and the editor was actually cool and emailed me saying they had no one at the festival and asked if I could send them whatever I produced after. Funny enough it got published and now I'm credited on their site for it. YMMV because they could do any number of things including legal trouble.     Been here. Basically you need to have all of your bases covered if you're trying to apply for press for any major festivals. When I say bases covered I mean that usually with the large festival they do a thorough job of checking into who you are and where you say you're writing from - like if you say you're writing from VICE they're going to go to vice and see if you actually exist as an author there. If you submit your own press outlet (eg you make a magazine site and fill it with content) you better have a huge repository of content to make you look legit. Also most places require an Alexa score attached to press requests so they can filter out blog/homemade magazine sites from real news outlets. If you can somehow get through this you're good. Also you need to then create real coverage if you ever plan to do it again. The upside to this is once you can get through a festivals checking process once, the following year they're likely to not check into it as rigorously because you're now an established contact.   Relevant experience - did this for four years for EDC, Coachella, and outside lands. Stopped because I finished college and don't have the time to do this shit anymore.   TLDR: it's harder for the larger festivals, but possible if you are savvy."
myfriendwantstoknow,31b1lp,depressedsports,3,Fri Apr 3 15:27:02 2015 UTC,If you have a blog or website where you talk about music festivals then you can apply for a press pass to that venue.  Each venue or festival offers their own press passes so start your blog and apply.  Then you'll get in free and you have a legitimate press pass.

myfriendwantstoknow,318g4b,smartalec12,56,Thu Apr 2 20:49:36 2015 UTC,Mostly giving notice is a courtesy to the place you are leaving. If you ever think you may someday want to work at this place again then you need to give some sort of notice. Other than that there's no harm to just quitting unless your new job (or potential new job) has interaction with your current employer and they complain about how you left. I've always tried to give notice whenever possible. One thing that may be noticed later is if there are gaps in your work history where you are neither working or going to school.
myfriendwantstoknow,318g4b,bellmanator,4,Thu Apr 2 21:04:57 2015 UTC,"Nah, you just have to make something up to explain the gaps. As long as you have an explanation, you're fine.

myfriendwantstoknow,318g4b,col3yf_-,25,Fri Apr 3 19:55:21 2015 UTC,"The only thing that might give your friend pause before making that decision is if they anticipate ever needing to use this job as a reference for another job in the future. While it is generally against the law in most places for a former employer to badmouth you to a prospective employer, they might not have any qualms about mentioning that your friend did not do them the courtesy of giving 2 weeks' notice. From their perspective, that can be a really big inconvenience depending on the number of employees that work there - it could cause them to have to re-work schedules and pay other employees overtime to cover the shifts your friend isn't there for while they scramble to hire someone to re-balance their staff.  I'm not saying that some jobs aren't shitty and some managers aren't shitty, or that there aren't circumstances under which it's totally justified to quit on the spot and walk out forever. But if your friend can manage it, giving 2 weeks notice is the professional thing to do and prevents potentially useful bridges being burned."

myfriendwantstoknow,318g4b,scratchhappy,-1,Fri Apr 3 00:56:58 2015 UTC,"That's not true. Its important to maintain professional relationships with past employers so they will give you a good reference or potential jobs in the future. This is a part of networking and it's very important for any of your future jobs. Two weeks is seen as a professional courtesy and it shouldn't be taken personally.  However, I don't know the specifics of your friend's wanting to quit. If it's a shit environment and toxic then just leaving would work cause you aren't going to get a reference from them anyways. I've had to do this a couple of times.   Your friend should take the time to think it through and again look up the  labour law for his state and know his rights as an employee."

Employees who wish to quit are also required to give written notice:  1 week for employment of more than three months, but less than two years 2 weeks for employment of 2 years or more. If you give proper notice, the employer must pay all earnings to you within three days following termination of employment.

myfriendwantstoknow,31540u,vampyrita,4,Thu Apr 2 05:08:12 2015 UTC,"Other commenters in this thread have basically answered your question, but I just wanted to say that my SO and I have been together over ten years, surviving a year apart when I went away to a state school and he stayed behind to finish his AA at our hometown community college. He joined me at university the summer after my freshman year. One of my best friends is married to her high school sweetheart, and their relationship survived two years at different colleges before she transferred to his school. The eleventh anniversary of their first date is this month.  What I'm trying to say is that strong relationships with a backbone of excellent communication, trust, empathy, and compromise can survive college and long distances. Don't break up with your SO just because other people tell you it's inevitable; as long as you two make eachother happy, it's worth a shot."

We decided to just give it a try and take it one day at a time. Now I'm a few months out of school (5 years later), back in the same city as my girlfriend and we're still together. We're a long distance success story, but we're the minority. By a large margin.    Everything people say about LD is true. They're super hard, they do make you feel like you're missing out on something at college and, honestly, I don't know if I'd tell your friend they're always worth the effort. What LD does is it forces you to ask yourself ""is this relationship worth it?"" every single day. Any relationship is difficult and being 100+ miles away from your SO while surrounded by the hormonal tempest that is college only makes it that much harder.    Tl;dr Possible? Yes. Easy? Fuck no. Worth it? Only time will tell. Sorry of that was sort of a rambling answer but I hope it helps your friend!"

We are both pretty introverted and are content with it being the two of us for things and not going to events and things.

I knew several kids in HS who had their parents sign off on their service hours; usually for stuff like yardwork or small business stuff, but one kid's dad was a softball coach and said he helped with ""team management"". If your parents or a friend's parent is willing to cover for you, that's a low-risk way to deal with your problem.  A second way to go about this is just to find out where most other people in your school/organization do their hours, and say you volunteered there. You don't want to say you volunteered at some fake place because then you stick out and are more likely to have somebody check your story. If 100 other people volunteered at X Church, whoever is in charge of verifying these things will probably not bother. Disorganized...er, organizations and organizations that don't keep records of volunteers will also be unable to confirm or deny that you volunteered for them, so consider those too."

Dude, fake a signature on a piece of paper that says ""(name) has performed 40 hours of service, signed, (signature)"". You don't need an official form for this, though it will obviously help. Have fun. Don't use some of the ones that you can find without scrolling a reasonable distance, and pick one at random. Find one with no name on it, or one you can easily photoshop to the name of a service in town, ideally an obscure one no one else in your class will have used. Alternatively, just make it yourself in Microsoft Word, not hard. Then get a trustworthy friend, ideally one who will answer their phone with just a simple ""hello"" rather than ""ay yo who da fuk is dis"" or whatever. Put their phone number on the form- obviously after asking said friend if it's cool.  There you go. It'll take some time to get this all set up, but it won't take 40 hours."

I've personally had my ISP cut off service because someone in our house had downloaded and seeded a large amount of data (TV show series). We just had to call, acknowledge it had been deleted and service was activated.   On the flip side, you can face legal trouble. While working for my college in the IT Department we received requests for information on students who had downloaded music and were being sued by the RIAA. I laughed because one of the songs was ""My Humps""   You could also face copyright lawsuits if it's software you're downloading. A friend in high school had that happen to him and had to obtain a lawyer to help clean it up.   Chances of it happening to you? Pretty slim though. I would make sure you don't go crazy and download 100gb of data in a month and don't seed (if torrenting) too much."

On the third they terminate your service IIRC.  I'm not sure what the outcome was of the students at my college, I assume it was one of those ""Give us $1k and we'll go away"" lawsuits that were popular a couple years ago.   The last example though of the software download was very real and cost very real money to correct.

Now to give you an idea, my friend was the 5th highest sharer and because of good grades and no prior issues, was pretty much given a thing on his record but not kicked out.

Probably something along the lines of a totalled vehicle and serious injuries, to your friend, the driver of the other vehicle, and anyone else who happened to be caught by the crossfire of that.  As to the legality, I cant say. I would say that SOME fault would probably be assigned to your friend, since your friend's intent was to stop the driver. Let the police do their jobs, just get out of the way."
myfriendwantstoknow,30wkmx,ShadoowtheSecond,19,Tue Mar 31 08:12:24 2015 UTC,"Situations like this offer a broad latitude for the police. And it all comes down to whether you didn't cause more problems, injury, or damage. Police don't generally like the public to get involved for a number of reasons, so it's a dice roll. If you're successful in stopping the chased car without incident you might get a pat on the back. If your actions cause more problems you could be cited, or worse. Up to the officers discretion."

Say for example the vehicle being chased has a kidnapped person in the trunk.  You swerving and stopping in front of that vehicle causes a crash killing the person in the trunk.  You would most likely be sued by the victims family for being responsible for that persons death.  Depending on the jurisdiction that family would probably win.  Or worse, the accident spills into oncoming traffic or onto the sidewalk killing or injuring a bystander.. you are getting sued.  Kind of like the burgler falling into your house from the skylight breaking his leg, sues you and wins because he was injured inside your home.  It seems to matter less and less each day what the legal status of that person was at the time of the incident, only, that, you are responsible for it.  In short, stay out of it.   Hell, even the Police themselves are pulling back from most chases these days  - there's just too much liability."

myfriendwantstoknow,30wkmx,kilbert66,2,Wed Apr 1 04:24:02 2015 UTC,Your friend would assume all insurance responsibility.
myfriendwantstoknow,30wkmx,gaarasgourd,1 point,Tue Mar 31 15:30:52 2015 UTC,"There are potential legal consequences that depend largely on the circumstances, where you live and the people involved. Don't listen to posts that suggest otherwise. You may be liable for injuries, but that could also be extremely unlikely because you may or may not have a duty to the criminal (was he merely driving away from the police, refusing to pull over, but otherwise driving cautiously, for instance? That is incredibly unlikely, but if you were to aggressively ram a guy that's running from the police but harming no one, and kill him, the family could possibly sue for wrongful death by arguing you were the asshole), but he himself would definitely be breaching his duty to you (and everyone else on the road) by running from the police and endangering everyone's life.   The outcome of cases like that depend on the jurisdiction but unless I'm forgetting something, which I probably am, there's a pretty small chance a criminal in the process of committing a crime could successfully sue a defendant that injured him while trying to protect himself and others from the criminal's crime. I believe he'd be assuming the risk of the high-speed chase and any injuries that result, but it's been a while since I took torts and can't really remember.  Either way, don't do it - it's not your job and you could be killed or kill someone else. Even if you killed the fleeing criminal and were unharmed - how do you know that he/she did something serious that warranted killing him/her in the process of stopping them? You'd live with that guilt forever if you found out it was a 13 year old kid who stole his stepdad's car for shits and gigs."

As far as I know (and I am not a lawyer) possession of CP, even unknowingly, is a crime.  The point of this is to stop people from using the ""I didn't know she was a minor..."" defense when they are blatantly seeking out CP.    In reality, if your friend ends up coming across something, nothing will happen.  Report it to the site host and move along and they should have no issues at all.

That line takes stereotypes used to insult women and doesn't modify them to become specific or satirical; it boils down to ""this woman sure is vain and obsessed with self-image"", and doesn't get any better just because your friend projected that stereotype onto a specific woman. Satire isn't just hateful stuff said with a wink. (I mention this because honestly, most universities would see it as a bigger indictment than a low grade. Of course, they won't see it, but it's a good thing to keep in mind if your friend posts writing publicly.)  Second, assuming five classes per semester and three credit hours per class (just because it's the system at my friend's university), her worst-case scenario is 4 B's and a D, right? That maths out to a 2.6 GPA for the semester, but folded into her previous classes, that's a 3.5 GPA overall. Bump the creative writing grade to a C and it's 2.8/3.55 instead. Your friend might lose scholarships, group memberships, etc. that call for a GPA above 3.0 every semester, but revoking admission isn't going to happen for a student who can have a down semester and still qualify for most institutions' dean's lists."

In others, the admins would notice but not care. In others, tight security controls are in place, and your friend could get in serious trouble. He will need to feel out how the office culture handles stuff like this. Guaranteeing not getting caught is impossible, so he needs to make sure that getting caught doesn't mean instant termination.  Sysadmins are usually unconcerned with the actions of users as long as those users aren't overusing the network, breaking shit, or otherwise being nuisances. If, however, there is a ""no outside media"" policy, such as in some government offices, bringing movies could be a terrible idea that results in being reported and fired. Any porn/hate speech/snuff/similar stuff should also be avoided. Also, he needs to keep in mind that an external drive could be infected with a virus, and if he is careless about this, he could fuck up the network and get fired. I've seen someone get fired for infecting a work computer with a bunch of malware from non-work activities. She was not a stupid person, just someone who engaged in risky Internet usage and messed up.  Typically, sysadmins have a lot of discretion about what they report and tend to err on the side of not reporting things unless it's absolutely necessary. Of course, management could give instructions to report every violation. Your friend may want to feel out what other people in the office are doing to see if folks can get away with watching movies at work. He definitely should not stream movies or download them using the office Internet connection, since using the bandwidth and other network resources for non-work stuff may piss off IT."

Read through those and verify you aren't violating any corporate policies. USB devices can be logged as well as what software you have open for what period of time and I do know companies that have this ability (I help design/implement the solution) so an employer could see that you had Quicktime, VLC, or Windows Media Player open for ~4 hours in a day which would raise eyebrows but the guys I know with it generally don't dig into the logs unless there's a work/performance issue.  Other than that, if it's on your flash drive and not streaming (eating bandwidth) you're likely fine.   Alternatively, just casually ask the IT Department/SysAdmin if he cares, bring them some coffee/Mountain Dew to appease them."

I've worked at places where anything goes (literally) and others where I was scared to click a wrong link by mistake.  Example:  I worked at a place that was serious.  We were in a training class and the instructor said to go to something like greyguy do com and a woman in the class went to something very close but wrong gayguy dot com maybe.  She flipped out a little because the home page of that sight was an enormous penis.  We had a laugh and continued.  10 minutes later a secuity guard and HR rep pulled her out of class to 'invite her to leave'.    Instructor explained what happened and she got off with a written warning.  EDIT:  Also, some places won't say anything until a pattern emerges.  Go to golf dot com once/twice a week and no big deal.  Three tie per day and it'll flag it and send an e-mail about your browsing."

Your friend's work might have a system that allows admins to remote control computers, but they're almost certainly not capturing keystrokes or taking screen captures on a regular basis - that sort of thing would require lots of storage and bandwidth overhead as well as the time of someone to review it all for very little gain.   To be clear - software to do this type of monitoring exists, and might be in use in schools or other ""in parentis loco"" environments, but I've never encountered it actually being used in an office.  Your friend's biggest concern should be people looking over his shoulder or noticing that he's just slacking off all day.  Mostly people won't care, but word gets around if you're known for goofing off all day."

They do capture/filter web requests, but that's handled by an appliance and is generally a ""set it and forget it"" type thing that they update every once in awhile.

myfriendwantstoknow,3019z1,Poiah2,25,Mon Mar 23 17:53:55 2015 UTC,Step 1. Find out if it's authentic. Because a fake would be worth about $5.
myfriendwantstoknow,3019z1,scottread1,-9,Mon Mar 23 18:36:39 2015 UTC,It is authentic. My friend's dad bought it in Ethiopia and it is authentic.

If anything purchasing anything in a 3rd world country only increases the risk of getting taken.   I have to agree with flyingboat, if your friend's family is in financial trouble because of this purchase then it most likely was a very bad idea.   Also since it was purchased in another country (assuming your friend doesn't live in Ethiopia) there is very little that can be done concerning fraud recovery."

So assuming the following;  a) authentic  b) in good condition  c) there's an interested buyer  Your friend could expect somewhere in the range of $4000-$10,000  And of course always have a 3rd party, unbiased appraiser take a look at it before starting negotiations with anyone."

The short answer is, the book is worth what someone's willing to pay for it. Given the circumstances, it's probably fake. However, that timeframe would put the Bible during the early stages of Christianity in the area so if it were real it would likely be desirable (by someone) for that reason.   http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/acet/hd_acet.htm  The better answer is the book needs to be appraised by a rare books/antiquity dealer. That's the only way you'll know for insurance purposes and such.   I would venture to say if someone was strapped for cash or had to stretch to purchase an item like that they probably shouldn't have bought it in the first place."

myfriendwantstoknow,3019z1,TopazRoom,2,Tue Mar 24 13:23:21 2015 UTC,"The value of collectors items that are not unique or close to unique are always going to be the value that someone is willing to pay for it. Are people buying 400 y/o Ethiopian bibles? Maybe. Who? I don't know. How much? No idea. You'd have to find out who your market is and see how much similar items have gone for. It's probably not unique or old enough to be a museum piece, so you'd be looking at private collectors. You'd have to get it appraised to prove its authenticity, which costs money, and you'd have to find a buyer.  You could get on ebay or some shit and try to get a ballpark, but that doesn't prove anything. I inherited a bunch of rare stamps, but no one actually buys stamps anymore so the ~$500.00 my collection is worth according to ebay is more like 0.   It was probably an unwise investment."

myfriendwantstoknow,2zzmyy,hehehh,33,Mon Mar 23 07:12:06 2015 UTC,"Here's a real answer.  When this happens in public pools, depending on the amount of blood, a couple things happen:  1) shock the pool. This basically means dump an obscene amount of chemicals in the water to kill all living things. This policy might have changed in recent years, but it was common practice in municipal pools for as long as I remember.  2) drain the water, scrub everything. Fill with new, chemically balanced water.  A lot depends on salt or chlorine. Lots of blood or a little. Cuts at pools tend to appear bloodier because of water and stuff. What's important is blood carries a lot of pathogens that aren't otherwise transferable except via direct contact. You don't want to mess with it.  If it were my pool, and enough blood to prompt a post like this....I'd dump it and follow option 2.  Source: peeing in the deep end since grade school."

They can't get him for shoplifting, he didn't try to leave the store with the object .. but they have a pretty good idea that he was at least attempting it.   Where he does need to worry is that these ""loss prevention"" companies work for many of the larger retailers -- so he's on their local 'watch' list. They shouldn't be able to get his personal information from his license plate .. but don't hold your breath. They'll have his name by tomorrow.   tl;dr -- he needs to lay low and stay the hell out of big box retail until he can learn to control himself. He's not going to go to jail, but he's a small fuck-up away from making a bigger mistake."
myfriendwantstoknow,2zut25,Mremerkin,3,Sun Mar 22 00:04:15 2015 UTC,"Hes probably on a watch list, but to be honest it will be forgotten after a few weeks.   Even if he walked out with the item, the loss prevention people cant physically stop him from leaving. They can however report it to police"
myfriendwantstoknow,2zut25,CharlieTango,4,Sun Mar 22 02:57:23 2015 UTC,"LOL, no. They can't do a damn thing. He would have gotten away with the item too if he just left immediately after taking it instead of waiting around and staring at security. Still shouldn't be stealing though. Getting caught at some point is a real possibility and it's not worth it."
myfriendwantstoknow,2zut25,DrDreampop,1 point,Sun Mar 22 03:25:51 2015 UTC,"tbh, the loss prevention guy has to SEE him take the object.  and yeah, all he can really do is take down the guy's license plate & description and pass it around to the rest of the stores.    tell your friend to stay away from stores for a while.  if anything, get someone else to go get his groceries/items he needs."

For this company they would use the LP, car description, and a shitty photo from the video footage to broadcast it to all branches of the company. It was a Be on the LookOut for type of fax. They rarely had names, just descriptions, but this was 5 yrs ago and it probably depends on how much $ the company wants to invest in IDing the person. I know my company didn't do much, but who knows now.   Also: They never sent it out to other unrelated companies though. And for this company in particular they kept it up for a while but eventually took it down when more recent/serious offenders came into play. Otherwise they'd have to have wallpapered the break room with random people's faces.  Tell your friend to stop stealing and get help.

Infinities do funny things to probability. In fact, there was no you forever before you were born, but since your consciousness didn't exist, you weren't aware of the passage of that forever passing. Then one day a universe with physics and matter and energy happened, then a consciousness. Probably the most unlikely thing I can possibly imagine. But it did happen, because it took forever to happen. No telling how many ""failed"" universes existed before the dice rolled enough times to make one that not only has a planet where consciousness can exist, but also one where a ludicrous chain of circumstances came together to make a ""you"" at all.  I'm just saying it happened once before. Something like it, or something even more bizarre is likely to happen eventually."

myfriendwantstoknow,2zpx65,G3Kappa,8,Fri Mar 20 18:03:52 2015 UTC,"I'd say it depends on the sickness and what you mean by ""going away."" Anger can sometimes propel you to get shit done in spite of being sick. Being angry can be the difference between taking a defeatist attitude or working through physical therapy or treatments. Can it make you heal more quickly? Probably not. That's what proper diet, bed rest, water, and medication are for. Can it make you more likely to practice the self care that will speed up your recovery? Sometimes yes, other times no.  So... maybe?"

myfriendwantstoknow,2zpx65,n1nj4_v5_p1r4t3,11,Fri Mar 20 23:34:02 2015 UTC,"Anger increases stress, both emotional and physical. Both of these forms of stress (or more specifically, the hormones they cause your body to release) have been shown to decrease the body's ability to fight illness like the cold and flu. I imagine the same would be true for any disease or illness. Some believe that prayer or meditation help the body to fight illness because both have shown to decrease the production of stress hormones."
myfriendwantstoknow,2zpx65,AgathaCrispy,2,Fri Mar 20 19:57:43 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna assume that you're talking about a cold or the like.  Short term, one can probably spike their system enough through getting pissed to finish whatever tasks are left in the day, but over the long term it'll probably do nothing, or maybe lengthen total recovery. The body does most of its' self reparation while in a relaxed restful state (IE asleep) so make sure your friends' body has enough resources such as water, Vitamin C, and good food to handle what's ailing them.     As for other, more serious illnesses? It depends on how that anger manifests. Rage may have an anesthetic affect but it is stressful on the body for more than minute bursts. If you can be ""Mad"" enough to will yourself to be semi-active and escape the depression (Which is probably worse) then it could be worth a shot. Still probably not as helpful or effective as Happy Thoughts though.  Hope your friend feels better soon!  EDIT: I just realized this could be a good question for /r/AskDoctorSmeeee."

I imagine most ritual killings of animals would be similar to this, but I am not learned enough in witchcraft/satanism/whatever dumb edgy shit you're trying to be a part of to know for sure. As for the pact, I suppose your best bet would be a Grimoire, of which there are several available online. For legality, I'd imagine it wouldn't be legal unless you got permission from the state first, which would require being registered as a legit religion. However, I did find a Supreme Court case which struck down a ban on animal sacrifice so IDK about the legality.   There's the answer to your friend's concern, but I am going to put a huge disclaimer here- PLEASE DO NOT GO THROUGH WITH THIS IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY PLANNING IT!!!! It's not worth the legal hurdles and you probably shouldn't slaughter animals unsupervised being as young as you likely are, and you'll regret it when you're older. Also it won't do anything because come on dude."
myfriendwantstoknow,2zi5q6,Nowhere_Man_Forever,3,Wed Mar 18 23:14:30 2015 UTC,"Shechita:       The Hebrew term shechita (anglicized: /ʃəxiːˈtɑː/; Hebrew: שחיטה‎, [ʃχiˈta]), also transliterated shehitah, shechitah, shehita, means the slaughtering of mammals and birds for food. In Hebrew the word is generic and does not imply any religious or cultural practice, but in English the term has come to be used particularly for ""kosher slaughter"", that is the slaughter of animals for food according to Jewish dietary laws (Deut. 12:21, Deut. 14:21, Num. 11:22). The animal must be killed ""with respect and compassion""   by a religious Jew who is duly licensed and trained, often called in English a shochet (Hebrew: שוחט‎) although in Hebrew this word refers to a butcher regardless of any particular religion or culture. The act is performed by severing the trachea, esophagus, carotid arteries, jugular veins and vagus nerve in a swift action using a knife with an extremely sharp blade (called a ""chalef""by ashkenazim and a saquin by sephardim). This results in a rapid drop in blood pressure in the brain and loss of consciousness rendering the animal insensible to pain and to exsanguinate in a prompt and precise action.   The animal can be in a number of positions; when the animal is lying on its back, this is referred to as shechita munachat; in a standing position it is known as shechita me'umedet. Before slaughtering, the animal must be healthy, uninjured, and viable.

myfriendwantstoknow,2zcd87,DoctorDanDrangus,5,Tue Mar 17 12:22:01 2015 UTC,"You can't unless you're an authorized agent of your boss, which you may be or may not be. If you work at McDonald's, for instance, you're probably not allowed to accept service for your shift manager in your state. On the other hand, if you're the guy who runs the office in that area for your company, it might be sufficient.   Either way, it's the person who is trying to serve your boss's problem, not yours. You have no place in the case against your boss, you're just a guy, and if service is improper, that's the adverse party's responsibility that your boss may be able to attack.   EDIT: everything i said is true only if the package is a lawsuit. If it's just a delivery, who cares? Don't steal it, if that's what you're thinking.   EDIT2: If you're worried it's an illegal package and by signing for it, you'd be liable per the law: cross that bridge when you come to it. Aka: don't worry about it until you get in trouble and then consult an attorney, because it's hard to say whether or not you could get in trouble. It depends on a lot of things but if you were genuinely innocent in signing for it on behalf of your boss, it's pretty unlikely you'll have much to worry about unless you're implicated in some other way."

myfriendwantstoknow,2z49sl,LittleHelperRobot,4,Sun Mar 15 16:18:39 2015 UTC,"LibreOffice:       LibreOffice is a free and open source office suite, developed by The Document Foundation. It was forked from OpenOffice.org in 2010, which was an open-sourced version of the earlier StarOffice. The LibreOffice suite comprises programs to do word processing, spreadsheets, slideshows, diagrams and drawings, maintain databases, and compose mathematical formulae.  LibreOffice uses the international ISO/IEC standard OpenDocument file format as its native format to save documents for all of its applications (as do its OpenOffice.org cousins Apache OpenOffice and NeoOffice). The OpenDocument file format is now also supported by all major competing office suite applications (proprietary and open source). LibreOffice is also compatible with other major office suites, including Microsoft Office,  through a variety of import/export filters. The file formats of Microsoft Office are well supported, though some layout features and formatting attributes are handled differently in the application or are not entirely supported in the filters.  LibreOffice is available in over 110 languages  and for a variety of computing platforms,  including Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard or newer, and Linux (including a LibreOffice Viewer for Android.  It is the default office suite of most popular Linux distributions.      Between January 2011 (the first stable release) and October 2011, LibreOffice was downloaded approximately 7.5 million times.   During 2012, the office suite was downloaded about 15 million times  and in 2013 it was downloaded 25 million times.

Your friend probably doesn't have one that matches up with the ID -- so that is going to raise red flags.   While just renting a condo/hotel with a fake ID may seem innocent, and people get away with it all the time .. something might happen and he can be charged with a crime. Using a fake ID is a misdemeanor in most states .. but how it is used can become a felony charge. Again -- mileage may vary with the state.   Then, if there are any damages to the condo and the owner seeks compensation from the ""renter"". The stranger that works for him is going to claim that his ID was stolen. Rack up another felony, along with another fraud charge.   Pretty much you'd probably get away with it depending on how closely the guy who rents the condo checks, and how well behaved the friends are. But there is always that one jerk that is going to get everyone in trouble and that fun weekend turns into some court time, fines, criminal charges, and possibly some jail time."

Just know if you're caught being under 25 and they take legal action you could be charged with fraud

As a counterpoint to the idea that the actors/actresses are suffering, he has no idea if they actually enjoy what they do. Since there's no way to know either way, he can enjoy the video for its intended purpose. A lot of people came together (lol) to produce that video for his enjoyment, so he should relax, enjoy it and make sure to patronize or vote up videos that show people who are happy and enjoying each other. have him visit /r/passionx or other subs like that for videos that aren't as exploitative and nasty. Your friend may need to realize that he's repetitively engaging in behavior that is making him feel bad. This can lead to a downward spiral in his emotional state, and may be a sign of a repressed depression that's already lingering near the surface. He should change his behavior and try to masturbate without porn at least as many times as with porn. Foster imagination of scenes and fantasies that are pleasant and enjoyable. If your friend finds himself worrying that the girls in his fantasies are equally ashamed, exploited and unhappy, then there is a real problem with self-esteem and image and he should consider a real lifestyle change or seeing a therapist."

Google is telling me it's generally a male attacker preying on a female victim. Or accessing the user's camera for remote access.  First, the person would need access to the laptop/desktop either by physically being with it or by executing some type of remote attack. If you have Windows Vista, 7, or 8 (UAC controls), a decent anti-virus, and left the firewall configurations stock then you're likely fine without anything installed on the machine.   If malicious code/program was executed on the machine (you opened a weird email attachment, or downloaded something weird) then you're potentially at risk. Computers do what you tell them and if you tell them to run virus.exe they're going to do it.  Assuming you're Windows -    Download MalwareBytes (Free), open it up and let it update then scan Verify you have anti-virus (Microsoft Security Essentials is free) and that it's active. Run a full scan. Verify the Windows Firewall is enabled (found in the Control Panel)   Reboot your computer into Safe Mode (Google it) and then run MalewareBytes again in Safe Mode. Generally viruses and such cannot execute in safe mode so you're good to run a scan.  After it's done, run Microsoft Security Essentials and do a full scan again.  If nothing pops up there likely isn't anything on your computer that would allow someone to get into it remotely.

myfriendwantstoknow,2ypr5v,Nowhere_Man_Forever,2,Wed Mar 11 21:06:46 2015 UTC,"IANAL  It depends on who caught your friend. If he's caught by someone who doesn't report him to the popo he's good. If he's caught otherwise he's pretty fucked. I can't think of any states that wouldn't count that under statutory rape laws.   As for non-legal stuff it depedns on your community and social group. I consider that age gap to be too much (bruh she can't even drive and your friend is a legal adult) but I know rednecks who think that's okay, so idk what the social repercussions will be."

They were in a relationship for over 6 months (ie: not forced, not rape- it was a consensual loving relationship). The 15 y/old's parents walked in on them having sex and pressed charges. My friend spent 4 years in prison and now has to register as a sex offender.   Now, same scenario same state but my sister was the 15 y/o. My parents did not press charges on her boyfriend. Authorities did find out but no charges filed because my parents fought in his behalf so none were ever filed.   Long story short- your friend just needs to stay away for a few years. No need for the shitstorm that could ruin his life. At that age, the relationship is likely not going to be long lasting anyway."

People try so many off the wall schemes to pass a piss test, when all they have to do is just not smoke weed for a couple/few weeks.

myfriendwantstoknow,2ylx2j,AgathaCrispy,-13,Tue Mar 10 23:43:35 2015 UTC,"Hold on for a second, it's quite obvious that you're not a habitual smoker, so you have absolutely no right to comment on something like that in the manner that you did.  People are absolutely stupid if they tell you that marijuana is non-addictive. EVERYTHING in this world is addictive, whether it's eating, smoking, sex, or crystal meth.   When a habitual smoker goes without smoking for a day or two, there are very real withdrawal systems, which range from sweating or loss of appetite to severe depression. The fact of the matter is, if you get your body used to something, when you take that away, it's going to have a physical effect on your body.  It really bothers me that you just equate an addiction to lack of self control, there is absolutely no difference between an alcoholic and a marijuana addict.

Or is he an idiot with no self-control?  Have you considered just calling his dealer and saying, ""Hey, Dudefella wants to get a job.  Can you not sell him anything till middle of May or so?  If you help him get a job, you know, he'll have a steady income and be able to afford to be a better customer!""

Slowing something down in an orbit directly effects the other side of its orbit. A mission would look something like sending either millions of tons of rocket fuel to Mars and slowing it down on one side, then waiting half a Martian year and doing it again, or enough nukes to end our existance.   Either way we wouldn't accomplish anything at all. I don't think we have the means to make a significant adjustment to the orbit of the moon, much less Mars. Given our current technology, if we had infinite money and resources, it would still take a very long time.

Right now Mars is cold enough that a lot of its atmosphere freezes out at the poles during the winter and evaporates during the summer...while it's evaporating at the north pole it's freezing out at the south, and vice versa.  If you move Mars closer, it warms up. Not as much CO2 freezes out, and the greenhouse effect goes up due to more CO2 in the atmosphere. This warms Mars even further, resulting in even less CO2 freezing out, and so on.  Long story short, once Mars gets to the point where all the (currently frozen) CO2 is in the atmosphere, you'd be able to stand outside in your t-shirt and an oxygen mask. From what I've read, the air pressure would be roughly equivalent to 10,000 feet here on earth.  edit In your tshirt, assuming radiation wasn't a concern at that moment"

If we approximate Mars' orbit as circular (pretty reasonable since the eccentricity is only about 0.09), then equating the force of gravity on Mars from the Sun to the centripetal force required for a circular orbit, we have  GMm/r2 = mv2 / r  --> r = GM/v2  So, to decrease the orbital radius, we'd need to increase the velocity."
myfriendwantstoknow,2y7j0r,Consta135,1 point,Sat Mar 7 18:35:17 2015 UTC,"The velocity increases when the orbit drops, by burning against the direction of travel like I said."
myfriendwantstoknow,2y7j0r,DoomScythe101,1 point,Sat Mar 7 18:43:31 2015 UTC,"I think I see what you're saying.  If we adjusted Mars' orbit so that it was very eccentric, its closest approach to the Sun would be much closer than it currently is and it would also have a high velocity at that point.  Then we would blast it again at that point to set it in a more circular orbit at that orbital radius."
myfriendwantstoknow,2y7j0r,Consta135,1 point,Sat Mar 7 19:03:15 2015 UTC,Exactly this. It seems counter intuitive to slow down in order to speed up but that's how orbital mechanics work.
myfriendwantstoknow,2y7j0r,DavidRoyman,1 point,Sat Mar 7 19:13:28 2015 UTC,"That's the final status after the equilibrium is reached again, in order to reach it the gravitational pull must be higher than the centifugal force:  GMm/r2 = m v(1)2 / r > m v(2)2 / r  Which is true when v(1), the velocity in the starting condition, is higher than v(2). We must slow down the planet."

Let met know if you need help with anything, and if your router isn't a linksys, just go look at the make and model and google the default username/password.  So anyways, back to my point.

myfriendwantstoknow,2y3bmp,TheMuffnMan,8,Fri Mar 6 02:33:18 2015 UTC,"Optimum (your ISP) is not going to pull logs for your friend's parents. They are far too busy to do that and there is really no way to distinguish your traffic from everyone else's in the house. They (the parents) could install/configure monitoring software on either the router (Tomato firmware supports this natively) or on the computers themselves. There's really no way around that except using a jump box/VPN and then browsing through that. I really doubt they are going to go to that length and that they are likely empty threats.  Regarding your phone, I'm not familiar if Verizon will log your URLs, I do know they can pull the call log and text message numbers but not the actual text/data. They can pull that information, but I believe it requires a subpoena (not something a parent is going to get).   The FamilyBase security suite in Verizon goes into detail, again, it's just the numbers and not the actual data.   If you're worried about your Browsing history, just run Chrome in Incognito Mode which empties your session on exit. Other browsers (Safari, FireFox, and IE) have similar features.

If your friend wanting to scam people with a pyramid scheme there's no 'hosting' it's all fluffy numbers. Incredibly simplified - People pay you $10 each to do _________ with the expectation/hope/promise from you they'll see 20% returns within a month. If they bring on board people at $10 each then they make $4 and pass the extra $1 down to the next person with you getting $6. You get away with giving people their own money back masked as profit.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_scheme  Or  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme   They're illegal - it's fraud. The fact you're asking this question on Reddit pretty much already proves your friend is not capable of getting one off the ground. You're fucking over a lot of people - it's morally wrong.   To answer your actual questions:   There's no hosting, people pay you money then you have them get people to pay them money. You have to be an intelligent person to get away with it, cover your books, smooth talker, etc. Madoff was a big recent case that's similar (it's a Ponzi scheme which is similar)  Word of mouth and/or bogus reviews. You need people to trust you with their money for a product/services/investment. You need to have forged paperwork showing profits and such. Pyramid schemes require people to recruit others in order to fuel the scheme. They grow rapidly but generally crap out because they require more people than they can get onboard. So you don't get caught? Tor, Bitcoin, encrypted hard drives, zero paper trail, burner cell phones, etc. The fact your friend has already posted this onto an internet forum that's certainly looked at by authorities is going to ding him a bit. Especially since it's their main account.   If you're taking a bot-net, effectively a web/pyramid (of sorts?), then you need to either leverage existing virus/malware or develop your own. You can't really advertise or share it - then anti-virus clients will pick up on it. Find a way to exploit systems and send it on its way. The machines then report back (I've seen a few go into IRC channels to check in) and you can execute commands."

myfriendwantstoknow,2xlvom,n2theluz,3,Mon Mar 2 03:03:06 2015 UTC,"Fire breathing works better with an oily petroleum based fuel, like tiki torch fuel, or kerosene.  Your friend wants a fluid that is flammable, but does not have flammable vapors.  If your friend wants to get uncomfortably drunk after 2 shots, everclear is a helluva drug. It doesn't get stronger than pure grain everclear. Maybe if you can find lab-grade ethanol.  Umm, isopropyl alcohol is supposed to be a strong intoxicant, but the emphasis is on toxic, much like methanol, which will leave you sick and blind.  Your friend should separate drinking from fire, or at least drinking liquids from fire liquids."

I always figured it was an old wives tale. Or urban legend. What I did know was I drank a bottle of mouthwash, they were giving out in middle school, on a dare and i while a pleasant buzz early on it quickly devolved to intense stomach pains and feeling like death. I vowed that day to never try getting drunk off anything but real booze ever again. And once I tried real booze that solidified my earlier resolution.   Edit: the only time I've personally blown fireballs I was piss drunk and with kerosene. The first fireball went swimmingly, but in my effort to go even bigger the second time I managed to spurt some on my face before I lit it and rubbing it off on my sleeve was not sufficient to remove it from my face. Once I lit that second one it was going pretty bitchin' until I was out of kerosene in my mouth. Then the area previously sullied in my over exuberance stayed stay afire from the residual dumbassery that was still on my mug.   edit2: Flammable vapor never would have even crossed my mind if Everclear had been around at that point.

Now either on the icon or possibly an option when connecting it to iTunes is a setting to let the ipod be a 'mass storage device' or something about 'disk access', you need that turned on. This allows your computer to look at the files directly without going through iTunes. Next on your computer you need to turn on 'show hidden files'.

myfriendwantstoknow,2x5gpa,BroadCityChessClub,119,Wed Feb 25 20:35:40 2015 UTC,"Holy shit.  I suppose ""all of it"" isn't a reasonable answer for what's wrong with the video, so let's break it down:   ""If you're getting 100 channels of 6 MBit Channels of HD that's 6 GB of data.""   Things don't start out well.  He's comparing a rate to an amount of data (think comparing mph to miles) and doesn't even do the math right.  100 * 6 MBit = 600 MBit which is 75 Megabytes per second.  No idea where the 6 GB number came from, but it's immaterial.  He's not making a coherent point.  He hasn't made any argument at this point, just bad math.   ""You know what, you can't just deliver all that for television, we want to open that up to the internet.""   Yes, and the user is the one who gets to make the decision of what the data gets used for.    This right here is the single sentence that refutes any point he's trying to make.  You buy bandwidth and get to decide how you use it.  He's trying to fearmonger, making it seem like someone else's use of the bandwidth they bought will make you unable to use the bandwidth that you bought because of net neutrality, but that's grade-A bullshit.  He should be slapped for making such a bone-headed statement, but I doubt it was ignorance that led him to say it.   ""Now all of a sudden <conventional television> might start buffering""   Sure, if you decide that you want to buy a small enough amount of bandwidth and then use it all for something else, but that's not really news.  That's like saying that your TV's speakers might not be loud enough if you're listening to your iPod.  It's your decision how you allocate your bandwidth when the net is neutral, so if you want to try to make your TV buffer by saturating your connection with other data then you can.   ""I probably need new equipment in my home, that maybe the government will force you to buy""   Wait WHAT?!?! How the hell did we get to this?  This is comically ludicrous, except for the sad fact that some people will probably believe this nonsense.  There is zero reason to think that net neutrality will cause the government to force you to buy anything.  He may as well have said that it'll cause the government to start executing first-born children, as there is just as much reason to believe this.  He offers no reason why anyone should believe that this will occur, except his own statement.     ""Bits are bits""   The next section of the video is incoherent jabbering.  He says nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  He's just filling the silence with words, but he doesn't make any point or much sense.  Really shows off how little he knows about the subject here.   Net neutrality at its base says all that data should be delivered together, and no one should have priority   This is a bastardization of what net neutrality says.  It says that the user should be able to choose what data they want delivered and the ISP can't give priority to one kind of data or another, but individual users may have priority over others (e.g. by purchasing faster service).  He's trying to make it sound like net neutrality will turn the internet into communism, but that's complete bullshit.   Your traditional television, watching the evening news, it's over:   He has utterly failed to demonstrate that this will be the case.  From bad math to incorrect definitions of net neutrality he's spouted nonsense the whole way through.  Even his initial premise of ""TV and internet will be combined as one"" is far from a foregone conclusion and is really just a shitty slippery slope fallacy; it's not inherent in Net Neutrality.  He's trying to distract from an issue that I suspect he has a strong personal stake in (he appears to be the chairman of a cable network... go figure; they can't compete with Netflix and the like, so they try to legislate them out of the market.  They're dying a Blockbuster death).  The truth wouldn't protect his wealth, so he resorts to lies."

myfriendwantstoknow,2x5gpa,changetip,1 point,Thu Feb 26 10:09:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip!  I think the scary thing is that he probably knows exactly what he's talking about.  I'm not generally one to go for conspiracy theories, but this guy is literally a cable news executive.  If there's someone who ought to have educated himself on net neutrality then it's him, and he's one of the few who stands to lose if it gets passed.  They can't compete with Netflix/Hulu/Amazon Video/etc, so they're trying to legislate them out of the market.  I honestly believe this was deliberate misinformation."
myfriendwantstoknow,2x5gpa,Koooooj,5,Thu Feb 26 15:13:56 2015 UTC,"IMO the easiest way to tell this video is bunk is because of what Cubes says right at the beginning:   It's not inconceivable, and I would tell you that someone will sue and it will become likely that they'll say you have to combine all that bandwidth together.   The entire rest of the video is based on this premise. The problem is, there's no reason given, or any reason to believe, that this premise is even remotely true. It's his wild guess. Who would sue for this? What would ever make you believe this is the way things would legally end up? And what would ever make you believe our technological infrastructure would remain exactly as it is now if such a monumental change were to occur?  This is fear mongering at its dumbest. For example, he says regular TV may now have to buffer... as if the major networks and cable companies are just gonna sit back and say ""Welp, guess TV's just gonna buffer from now on!"" rather than any progression in technology or service. Forgiving the fact that this isn't even how technology works, even if this scenario did come to fruition, I have a funny feeling the affected companies would find a way to continue producing a marketable product. A billionaire businessman would know that.  Listen to some of the other laughable shit he says:   Bits are bits. No matter what anybody says in government, no matter what any technologically savvy person says, bits are bits.   How can he even say this with a straight face? He's literally saying ""Ignore people who know more than me and are smarter than me, I say bits are bits and you shouldn't believe otherwise just because those people are 'technologically savvy.'""  I think anyone with half a brain watching him on this little mini-campaign against net neutrality can see he has a financial or political interest in the outcome and is either outright lying or is foolish enough to just believe what he wants to believe."

Lots of people will tell you it's the muscles that stop you peeing (as poster above said - don't do it while peeing as you can leave residual and bacteria and stuff!). What  I was recommended by one of our OB/GYN physios was that if you want to do a better/stronger exercise - imagine you're trying to stop a fart in a library or on a first date!   The pelvic floor is a hammock supporting your pelvic muscles and reproductive system. You'll work it so much better with the fart technique!

myfriendwantstoknow,2wy9vk,20130217,3,Tue Feb 24 06:22:31 2015 UTC,Can someone ELI5 the question and answers?
myfriendwantstoknow,2wy9vk,gaarasgourd,8,Tue Feb 24 17:46:29 2015 UTC,"OP's friend made some money gambling. In the US if you win more than a couple thousand in a casino you get an income statement that you must pay taxes on at the end of the year. When you have gambling income you can subtract the original amount of money you spent gambling from the winning amount. However most gamblers, and OPs friend don't keep receipts until they win once. Which means that while most gamblers don't break even, they have to pay taxes on winnings anyway because they have no proof of losses.  So OP is asking if his friend can use other people's old scratcher tickets as proof of losses. Which he can because the scratcher ticket is it's own receipt, and they are easy to find because unwinning tickets become worthless after scratching.  My own notes: If you get audited the IRS may complain about you having an incredibly unlikely 100% loss ratio. And faking it may be unnecessary because you can estimate losses and then talk it out for a settlement if you get audited, which looks much less sneaky than collecting old lotto tickets. The IRS knows how gambling works, and won't assume that you are a net winner for the year unless you win some sort of large jackpot. I've had the IRS accept an index card on which I wrote cash in and cash out + a date for each gambling trip."

myfriendwantstoknow,2wxhe0,sneakypete13,5,Mon Feb 23 23:53:32 2015 UTC,"IANAL - Well, you don't mention exactly what ""moving violations"" you have. But, here's a few options -    Take Traffic School prior to court (pre-adjudication) and present your completion certificate to the judge and officer when you are called forward. I would likely plead 'No Contest' in this instance and then the judge should ask if you have anything to say, be polite and present the court with your certificate of completion. Hope for the best. This usually only works if you have a clean (or nearly clean) record already. Some courts will have you line up prior to the judge coming in to have the clerk set your ticket(s) aside if you feel you qualify for driving/traffic school. Certain offenses (reckless, dui, etc) immediately disqualify you. If you've got rolling a stop sign and not using a signal then you probably qualify. Then when the judge/clerk calls you forward they'll (hopefully) give you traffic/driving school and you're on your way.  Plead 'Not Guilty' and argue your case. The judge will have the officer give his side of the story (he'll have notes) and then ask you for yours and issue a verdict - I've never seen this work for the defendant. Plead 'Guilty' and just get whatever the judge gives you. He'll listen to the officer's statements and then might ask you for yours. You'll likely get the full penalty. Plead 'No Contest' and either present your traffic school cert (Scenario 1) or ask for driving school (Scenario 2 kinda).    If you've got shit on your record already you probably won't have much luck. Some states have restrictions on the amount of times driving school can be done (voluntarily or court-ordered) and judges can choose to not accept/assign it at all.   What moving violations do you actually have? It's also not the end of the world if they're on your record."
myfriendwantstoknow,2wxhe0,TheMuffnMan,3,Tue Feb 24 02:51:53 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this. By moving violations, my friend was doing 60 in a 45 and he did a wide right turn onto a small road and instead of getting into the right hand turn lane, he ended up in the oncoming lane. (He says it was 11p on a Sunday night so there was no one on the road and he turn left immediately after he did this onto a bigger road where the lines were more clear.) Hope that clarifies the situation a little bit."
myfriendwantstoknow,2wxhe0,TheMuffnMan,3,Tue Feb 24 07:17:31 2015 UTC,"So 15 over (so Speeding, not reckless?) and then ending up in oncoming traffic (Failure to obey highway signs?)?  Depending on your record and financial situation, it may be beneficial to get a lawyer. I just looked up Arizona's point system see here and their driving school see here  So if you accumulate 8 points in a 12-month period you are required to take Traffic school and your license may be suspended for 12 months. Right now you're looking at 5 points (assuming Speeding, not Reckless and Failure to Obey a Highway Sign) if you actually received a Reckless Driving (8 points on its own) or if you received 'Aggressive Driving' ( see here failure to obey can qualify) which is also 8 points then I'd strongly suggest you look into getting a lawyer.   What are the actual offenses listed on the tickets?  Note that those penalties change if you're also under 18."
myfriendwantstoknow,2wxhe0,TheMuffnMan,2,Tue Feb 24 18:35:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you again for this information. He marked both of the offenses as civil offenses. the ending up in oncoming traffic was first but it was a surface street so there was no failure to obey highway signs. Also, the speeding was only 15 over so it was just speeding, not reckless or aggressive. My friend is over the age of 21 and he hasn't had any tickets or citations in the past. He is also worried about this from an insurance standpoint and that is why he asked this initial question. The actual offenses listed are 28-721A (Driving left of center) and 28-701A (Speed greater that R+P)."
myfriendwantstoknow,2wxhe0,srirachagoodness,20,Tue Feb 24 20:03:19 2015 UTC,"No.  The answer is ""It Depends"". The longer answer/explanation is that the court may chose to continue the case until the officer is next available or they may chose to dismiss the ticket. You will not be tried without the officer present as it is his testimony that is used as evidence. Your results may vary based on the severity of the ticket, if it's a simple non-moving (like tint) it'll probably be dismissed, but if it's a reckless? Not a chance.  Source: I've gotten wayyyyyy too many tickets."
myfriendwantstoknow,2wxhe0,TheMuffnMan,7,Tue Feb 24 00:27:03 2015 UTC,"Well right, I didn't mean to suggest you could get something serious like a DUI thrown out by just hoping nobody shows. But you can get away with a moving violation. Speeding ticket? Failing to signal? Some other bullshit? Off the hook if the cop isn't there. It's happened to me personally."
myfriendwantstoknow,2wxhe0,TheMuffnMan,4,Tue Feb 24 02:42:48 2015 UTC,"Speeding is going to be tricky,   1-5 over? Maybe.   5-10 over? Ehhh.   10-15 over? Nope  15+ (reckless)? No way  Not signaling? Probably off the hook though. I've seen judges reassign a whole group (20+ people) to a different day because the officer didn't show up. I've also seen a judge let everyone off because of the same thing."

myfriendwantstoknow,2wxhe0,TheMuffnMan,3,Tue Feb 24 02:54:25 2015 UTC,"It depends where I guess. Here in NY, if you are going 10 miles over the speed limit, you are following the flow of traffic in the slow lane."

myfriendwantstoknow,2wxhe0,mongo_smash,4,Tue Feb 24 04:34:29 2015 UTC,"In my experience, it varies widely depending on the court/judge and the prosecutor. You're probably better off approaching the prosecutor and seeing if he/she is willing to work out a deal. Many times they just want to save time and will be willing to work something out if you're willing to plead to a lesser traffic offense. If you're set on pleading not guilty to the ticket, they may treat your first appearance as an arraignment and schedule your actual trial for a later date. This is because most municipal courts (in my state anyway) are in session only one day a week and there are many cases that need to be heard that don't involve actual trials, which can be somewhat time consuming.  If you're dead set on having a trial, they generally will be sure to notify the officer and their command staff in advance to ensure their attendance. Having said that, if they suddenly can't make it for whatever reason, they may postpone or dismiss based on the pleasure of the judge."
myfriendwantstoknow,2wxhe0,n1nj4_v5_p1r4t3,3,Tue Feb 24 00:32:54 2015 UTC,"No. In California, the court date on the ticket is only the plea date. You go in wait for your name to be called and say innocent or guilty. If you say innocent, they give you another court date. If the cop doesn't show to that date the charges are dropped"
myfriendwantstoknow,2wxhe0,red3biggs,1 point,Tue Feb 24 00:48:38 2015 UTC,"My friend heard that if the officer doesn't show up to the hearing, then your ticket gets dropped   Now days the cop can just write a statement and not show up, depending on the severity of the offense. If it was a felony he might be required to show up, but for a misdemeanor offense his statement will be fine for the judge."

SSRIs are believed to increase the extracellular level of the neurotransmitter serotonin by inhibiting its reuptake into the presynaptic cell, increasing the level of serotonin in the synaptic cleft available to bind to the postsynaptic receptor. They have varying degrees of selectivity for the other monoamine transporters, with pure SSRIs having only weak affinity for the noradrenaline and dopamine transporter.  SSRIs are the most widely prescribed antidepressants in many countries.  The efficacy of SSRIs in mild or moderate cases of depression has been disputed.

myfriendwantstoknow,2wxcha,autowikibot,3,Mon Feb 23 23:48:29 2015 UTC,"Ok so basically, the brain registers thoughts and feelings by transfering electrical impulses across synapses. Effectively, the synapses act as a bridge to make sure electrical impulses only travel in one direction in the brain.  Synapses are gaps in nerve cells. In order for electrical impulses to travel across the synapses, a medium is needed, this is called serotonin. When an electrical impulse is sent across, the serotonin needs to reform at the starting point.  Antidepressants, most commonly SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) stop this process. This means more serotonin is replaced when the SSRIs wesr down. This boosted serotonin allows the brain to recieve messages faster which in turn boosts mood."

myfriendwantstoknow,2wonnz,jonaheim88,22,Sat Feb 21 19:49:40 2015 UTC,"she said that she does, he just doesn't give her a chance   So, here's the thing.  It's cliche, but men and women often operate on different frequencies.  What does this mean for your friend?  It means that he'll need to have a very frank conversation with his SO so they can tell each other what they think ""initiating"" looks like.  One person may see this as subtle verbal hints.  The other might think that something physical has to happen.  The problem is, if they are operating on different wavelengths, both people may try to initiate but they both might be missing some of the signals that the other one sends out.  Here's how that can look:     Woman: How come you weren't interested in...you know, fun times last night?  Guy: What do you mean?  I would have totally been interested if you brought it up!  Woman: I did bring it up.  I said ""Let's go to bed early to have some time together.""  Man: I thought you meant we should get more sleep!     After throwing out hints for a while and not having any luck, it's easy for one of the partners to just give up on initiating.  We all think that our partner should be able to read our mind, but it's just not true.  This means two things:  1) Explicit conversations sometimes about what constitutes initiating.  2) The fun part: practice."
myfriendwantstoknow,2wonnz,MusicalXena,5,Sat Feb 21 23:49:53 2015 UTC,"When my wife says ""let's go to bed early"" she really does mean sleep. I fell for it for the first few years, but now I know better."
myfriendwantstoknow,2wonnz,kronaz,3,Mon Feb 23 07:18:04 2015 UTC,Good point! Communicating like that should help if she thinks she's initiating.
myfriendwantstoknow,2wonnz,faithamor1337,4,Sun Feb 22 00:17:38 2015 UTC,"good points, but what if she is just saying she tries but doesnt really?"
myfriendwantstoknow,2wonnz,worldoftyra,2,Sun Feb 22 01:22:41 2015 UTC,"Maybe if she is ""isn't really trying"" it's because she is bored/uninterested in the sex. Not saying something's wrong with your ""friend"", but sex can get boring quickly when it becomes routine. Maybe should try to tease each other through the day, it can take a little longer for some people to actually get aroused so that can work nicely."

When it is time to be physical don't act timid, take her and make her feel like a woman. And follow the good advice others have posted. Work on understanding what she likes, and tell her what you like. That takes confidence. And for real don't call it sexytime any more. Even if she does. The association with that phrase is of two hairy dudes rubbing their balls on each other.  Not the mental picture your friend should be after."

myfriendwantstoknow,2wonnz,almost_adequate,6,Sun Feb 22 15:01:15 2015 UTC,"Know that feel. From experience girls rarely initiate, I'm certain it's nothing to do with your friend personally, but rather how relationships often work in general. I think it's often a learned dynamic, if in a relationship the guy is always the one to initiate, that's how it's more likely to continue to be.   However, if there's no push and pull and you feel like you're constantly the one putting the effort in, it can have a strain on a relationship. If it extends to things other than sex, your friend needs to assess whether he is the one putting too much effort in, if his SO is putting so little in. It is a lot easier to simply put less effort in yourself than convince a girl to put more effort in, believe me. As with everything, you need to find a balance.  I hope this is what your friend wanted to hear, and tell him to please not worry about it too much, I'm certain she still finds him attractive, but just struggles to find a balance herself!"

myfriendwantstoknow,2wpotk,Sobbel,5,Tue Mar 3 10:12:54 2015 UTC,"Love varies.  If your friend is talking about loving another person and being loved back- well- It feels like the first shot of hard liquor. The warm and burning sensation develops in your stomach and works its way out all the way down to your fingertips and toes. You feel lighter than air and your heart feels like some one is reaching inside, grabbing on to it and pulling it up and out word- but honestly:  The feeling of love comes from not having it. When it's gone- you feel empty. The body runs cold and you notice a hole inside your stomach. The other person had become a part of you and then it was gone. Imagine losing a limb or the one thing that makes your friend feel like themselves all the time. And your friend realizes just how powerful the feeling of love really is.    Tl;dr: when you have it you feel it, when you lose it you know it."

The only reason I could see for full VPN in this usage case is if they are also blocking websites you want to visit as well, then you could use a VPN to access them around the blocks.  There are lots of companies that sell sock5 proxies, I found this one as the top hit on google so its probably just fine https://torguard.net/index.php  Here is a guide they have to set up the configuration I recommended in seconds once you have an account with them.

myfriendwantstoknow,2wfzvr,rock_hard_member,2,Tue Apr 14 22:24:13 2015 UTC,The main thing is don't seed.  I know a lot of my friends in college had something like a 2 year policy where they would only torrent stuff greater than 2 years old because those are less likely to be tracked and caught.  Finally look up your university's policy and see if you get a warning before any trouble.  If you do you may be able to try being a little more aggressive at first and have a safety net.
myfriendwantstoknow,2wfzvr,floaterinthebowl,1 point,Fri Feb 20 03:13:34 2015 UTC,"Don't know if anyone has mentioned this but VPN, most colleges have a traffic shaper which scans packets for keywords, ie torrent, tpb etc, and then scans for trackers (the things that tell the peers where to send your files). A VPN will encrypt all in and out going traffic so that you keep the uni out of your business."

All the universities I know of track you on wifi by mac address and will immediately spot the huge number of connections created by torrenting and probably ban your mac / account / send you nasty letters.
myfriendwantstoknow,2wfzvr,themusicalduck,3,Fri Feb 20 00:41:07 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter if it's wifi or ethernet, you will still be presenting a MAC address to the router.

Professional labs deal with this problem all the time. Send it to a major pro lab... Your friend could just ask for negatives and no prints so they're less likely to see what it actually is.
myfriendwantstoknow,2wff8w,KFCConspiracy,12,Thu Feb 19 16:02:33 2015 UTC,My friend is more concerned about someone making a duplicate or snapping a photo of it while it's getting developed and it ending up somewhere.

However, they did make copies of especially exciting photos that were kept in a drawer in the back of the lab. As an employee you could look through the drawer, but you couldn't take anything from the drawer.   However, if labs come across images of child abuse, child endangerment, illegal druge use, etc. they are supposed to call the authorities.

Even 8 years ago when I ran a lab for Ritz Camera, the machine that scanned film to disk fed almost automatically. I think we had to hit ""enter"" on each frame, basically to make sure the frame was properly aligned. But when you're in a busy lab, you go fast.   You can easily remove the film from the disposable if you somehow feel like that's going to draw more attention to yourself. Just rewind it all the way and pry off the plastic under the roll. It'll come out.   You can't guarantee total privacy. You're more likely to avoid photo-thieves at a camera-store processing lab, because that's their business and they are less likely to fuck around. But Walgreens will be more likely to run it without even looking at it.   Go to a lab that is busy and have it go straight to disk. Do NOT get an index print."

Maybe choose a different bank.   Keep it simple.   Are they federally insured? Most banks that are tell the employees to comply with demands.  Research.  You could probably do it alone.

myfriendwantstoknow,2we03s,CalmSpider,12,Thu Feb 19 03:55:09 2015 UTC,"The systems being secured are constantly changing. The security industry has a hundred years of experience securing banks, but they have no more experience than any skilled IT worker or systems administrator when it comes to new software, servers, and encryption. You cannot install a truly impenetrable system. You can install a system that is not worth the effort of penetrating. You can install a system that nobody knows how to penetrate right now. You can't install one that is extremely secure as long as the technology surrounding it doesn't change.   This isn't to say that there is a way for an attacker to transfer money to their account the way they did in the story. That's not the only attack that must be guarded against, though. Customer information must also be guarded to prevent identity theft. Records must be guarded to maintain confidentiality of clients' finances or inside information that could affect the share prices of companies that have accounts there. There's a lot more they must protect against that I don't even know about because I'm not a specialist who works in IT security at a bank. Point is, there are a lot of doors to lock.  This is made even harder because there are security problems that nobody has found a good way to solve yet. One of these is xkcd 792 attacks. I've seen sites with username/password lists that are vulnerable, where someone with very basic knowledge of common web site vulnerabilities could get the entire list. No matter how secure the bank's usernames and passwords are, the weak link is outside their control. They try to counteract this by using security questions and similar measures, but it's easy to see how these have the potential for exploitation.   There will always be employees who are vulnerable to social engineering, no matter how well security staff train them. For all the seminars, all the warnings, all the classes, there will always be a certain percentage of employees who will compliantly tell their passwords to anyone on the phone claiming to be from the IT office with an authoritative voice. Some types of social engineering attacks have been thwarted by technology, such as disabling executable e-mail attachments, but some basic information security issues remain unsolved across the entire industry.  The last reason I'll cover for impenetrable systems being too hard to implement is the issue of cost. All departments, including IT and security (or however the relevant responsibilities are organized at our hypothetical bank) are subject to a budget. Corners will be cut. Staff will get lazy or sloppy sometimes. Mistakes will be made. Payroll budgets will not be enough to hire extremely skilled people in large numbers. A perfect security system would require a staff with complete knowledge of all the technology being used, constantly updated knowledge of all newly discovered vulnerabilities, and no mistakes."

Getting a normal user's password could give an attacker a login for the company intranet, website, or the ability to impersonate that user when calling IT to try and glean information from them.

myfriendwantstoknow,2we03s,jiggabot,7,Thu Feb 19 05:35:07 2015 UTC,"I've read a ton about bank robbers.  From what I have gathered, there are some common misconceptions...   They are more common than you may think.  They rarely actually make the news.  Even the small, safe suburb I lived in had them fairly often, if you actually looked into records of it.  This is, in part, because they usually aren't violent... They are more boring than you think.  Most of them are just a guy walking nonchalantly into a bank and passing the teller a note.  Most don't show a weapon or shout or anything.  Sure, people get traumatized, but it's rarely a ""Everybody down on the floor!"" situation. The actual cash taken is usually smaller than you may think.  It could just be a couple thousand dollars.  If you're just interacting with a single teller and trying to keep it inconspicuous, they aren't going to empty out a vault and give you sacks of money.   I listened to an interview with a reformed bank robber in a series of radio broadcasts/podcasts that really opened my eyes to a lot of this.  Here are the 4 parts on TBTL.  I highly recommend listening.  He's a totally normal guy that got addicted to painkillers and ended up turning to crime.  Nothing like the image in your mind.  There are 2 really successful and dramatic bank robbers I have heard of before.   The Shootist.  This guy was a full-blown movie bank robber.  He got the nickname from the FBI because he would take out a gun and actually shoot it in the air during his robberies, which is extremely uncommon.  That, combined with his over-the-top yelling and screaming would terrify everyone in the bank.  No one ever looked him in the eye, so he was hard to identify.  He showed willingness to shoot, so no one questioned him, put dye packs in his bags, or hit hidden alarms. The Friday Night Bank Robber.  Supposedly the most prolific.  He only robbed banks that were located next to wooded areas and freeways.  He would have a dirt bike stashed back there.  He would stick up the place (movie style, with a gun and shouting), but then he would go to the woods, store the money in a hiding spot and take a dirt bike through the woods.  Cars couldn't follow through there.  Then he would get to his car in a nearby parking lot and take that to the freeway.  After the heat died down, he would go back to get the money.   Hope that helps your friend.  It definitely helped distract me from the last 20 minutes of work."

myfriendwantstoknow,2we03s,DoctorDanDrangus,6,Sun Feb 22 17:42:25 2015 UTC,"Don't. Your friend isn't going to net all that much money (a few grand, tops. Given the time constraint and the amount of money the tellers are likely to have on-hand, without going in the vault - which your friend will NOT have time for)   For a few grand, you're looking at a FEDERAL crime, and the FBI gets involved immediately. Which therefore means you have a highly sophisticated law enforcement agency with national jurisdiction (it wouldn't slow them down if you fled out of state, in other words) that will hound you for life. That also means you'll be tried if/when caught in federal court and sentenced to prison, which means you're fucked. I don't know the mandatory sentences off-hand but I know they're really steep.   This is all not to mention that banks often have armed guards and have increasingly sophisticated security systems that make it highly likely you won't get away and if you do, not for long.   For all that trouble and not that much cash, if you're willing to do something as serious as rob a bank, you'd be smarter to rob several other places that aren't banks or to come up with a different scheme. The likelihood that you'll get away will be higher, the stakes will be lower, and you probably won't have the feds after you. Off the top of my head - I know first-hand that busy bars have an insane amount of cash on-hand at the end of the night. If your friend could wait till 3am and force his way in, he'd be in ideal circumstances and could probs snag more cash than a bank anyway."

myfriendwantstoknow,2we03s,zethan,2,Thu Feb 19 13:10:45 2015 UTC,"I have... a friend of a friend... who works tech for a major bank. He's explained to me that he's found a flaw in their computer systems that would allow him to steal £3,000,000, or £33,000,000. He's moderately confident that he could steal the £3M and still have long enough to get on a flight to a country without an extradition treaty, but he's pretty sure that if he stole the £33M he wouldn't even get out of the building before an automated system noticed.  And he says that £3M isn't enough for him for it to be worthwhile moving to a country he doesn't want to live in. So that's why that bank hasn't been robbed.  Anyway: what can we learn from this? (a) Your friend should consider working for a bank; an inside-job is far easier to pull off, and (b) your friend should be willing to leave the country imnmediately after the heist. That is all."

As for a good marketplace/vendor - I really am not comfortable giving that information out to people I am unfamiliar with, even through private message. Here is a big hint though. Find a review forum for online pharmacies. Become a senior member of such a forum, and you will find what you are looking for, plus some. If you find what I am talking about, read the rules. Don't just barge in and ask for sources. Get to know your surroundings.   Those of us that use sites that are freely available to anyone on the web - we protect our sources carefully.   One last word of advice, if you just google information about buying any kind of pharmaceutical or controlled substance, even if it's an antibiotic, most of what you find is a scam - they'll take your money and never send you anything, at best. At worst, they also sell your information to others, make unauthorized purchases, and create new credit cards in your name. That's why you need to find the reviewers. Good luck. And, be patient.

myfriendwantstoknow,2wg2wz,aaronc95,2,Sun Feb 22 21:50:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I trust Indian pharmaceuticals the least. I've tried various medications from around the world, and compared the same exact medicines from different countries. I find Indian-made pharms to be the least effective and have the most unpleasant side-effects, generally. I've seen a lot of badly made pills from India - bad smells, bad tastes (more so than there should be), and chalky/crumbly pills.   South African medicines are really good, and Thai medicines are also pretty good too. Meds from the Philippines are also really great. Of course any Western made medications (German, Dutch, Australian, etc.) are par with US and UK pharmaceuticals. Mexican meds are generally pretty good too.   I avoid Indian made medicines like the plague. If I can't get it somewhere else, then I don't get it at all. But you can always get something somewhere else. Anyway, just my opinion. I know some people that love Indian-made meds because they are so cheap, and for them, I suppose they work well enough. I'd rather pay a little more and feel like I'm getting a good product."

I believe White Hats are a very noble cause because they are, in the end, helping to make us more secure in the forever ongoing race to ""build a better mouse trap"". Be warned though, coming up with your own exploit is often MONTHS of hard frustrating work.

myfriendwantstoknow,2w9kth,Awbade,5,Wed Feb 18 02:57:30 2015 UTC,I saw that same statistic but it doesn't say how often the couple have sex. Is it 2-3 times a day thing or a once a week thing? I was hoping for something a little more concrete.
myfriendwantstoknow,2w9kth,motoroats,5,Wed Feb 18 03:02:14 2015 UTC,"I got the same thing from planned parenthood:    Of every 100 women whose partners use withdrawal, 4 will become pregnant each year if they always do it correctly.

I'd still interpret it as above. If you're perfect every single time, you have a 4% failure rate. If you don't do it perfect every single time, you have a 27% failure rate.

myfriendwantstoknow,2w9kth,secrethijackers,1 point,Wed Feb 18 05:26:27 2015 UTC,That make sense to me kinda. It still seems like it would be a different rate over a year. They're saying after having sex for a year straight you have a 4 percent chance of being pregnant. Wouldn't frequency affect that? It obviously isn't 4% after a year if you're having sex twice a day vs twice a week.

It is similar in composition to semen but has some significant chemical differences. The presence of sperm in the fluid is variable. Research has found no or low levels of sperm in pre-ejaculate, though these existing studies are non-generalizable due to examining small numbers of men.    A contrary, yet non-generalizable study that found mixed evidence, including individual cases of a high sperm concentration, was published in March 2011.  Pre-ejaculate is believed to function as a lubricant and an acid neutralizer. The amount of pre-ejaculate emitted varies widely between individuals; some men emit none.

myfriendwantstoknow,2w9kth,bisonhmr,3,Wed Feb 18 10:56:20 2015 UTC,"Girl here. I had to reply as I'm sick of getting reactions like the rest of the comments here - ""omg you're practically pregnant""- when we talk about the pull-out method. My partner and I are together for more than 7 years now and we've never used a condom. He is very good at pulling out and pulls out even before pre-cum, goes to pee, washes up etc, before coming back. Kids are an unthinkable topic for him so he is extremely careful. In all fairness our sex regularity is fairly low - once a week or less (he travels a lot). But I'm sharing all this to sort of be a bit reassuring. It's true that in a 100 times slips could happen, but in your friend's case for this one time, doing it with a girl who is supposed to be on birth control (and probably is) I'd guess the chances of  having messed up are low, so it's not worth freaking out about it.  However, if the question is about whether to keep this method up for regular sex, your friend needs to be honest with himself about how good he is at pulling out. I'd also advise against this practice with just a hook-up partner as indeed if something happens it's an unpleasant matter to deal with if the couple is not in a steady relationship.  edit:As the tutorial link said ahah:   requires great self-control, experience, and trust is not for men who ejaculate prematurely is not for men who don't know when to pull out is not recommended for teens and sexually inexperienced men because it takes lots of experience before a man can be sure to know when he's going to ejaculate   http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-info/birth-control/withdrawal-pull-out-method#sthash.cJYpcExi.eHFlabQy.dpuf"

If you pulled out 100% before you came, then the odds of her becoming pregnant are actually very, very low.   The problem with the pullout method is that some people don't actually pull out ""100%"" before they come. Further, pre-cum fluid can contain sperm (rarely), and in these RARE cases, pregnancies can occur.  In my opinion, if you had sex once and ""100%"" pulled out, I would say your chances of being a daddy are pretty low. Sex for an entire year on that method...ya, you might be a daddy."

(Though don't consider pulling out as a good method of modern birth control).  So, if she wasn't on the pill, I wouldn't cum inside even if I had a condom on. It's a matter of preference."
myfriendwantstoknow,2w5us0,anonagent,3,Tue Feb 17 05:25:21 2015 UTC,"Two things: Your friend would do best to try one on when alone and masturbate with it. That way he knows how to roll it off, how it feels etc. Cumming inside is the usual way people use a condom, but either inside or out is good- although inside is more pleasureable afaik (no interruption). If your friend should worry about a condom breaking or sth, they can always check by filling it with tap-water afterwards."
myfriendwantstoknow,2w5us0,Disingenuous_,6,Tue Feb 17 19:52:26 2015 UTC,"Last I checked, condoms have roughly a 98% success rate when used correctly. That being said, you should always assume you will be that unlucky 2% no matter what the situation, at least when it's something you can help. As others have said, make sure it fits. The most common problem about fitting, that I've heard, is getting a condom too big, because a lot of guys will think they're way bigger than the rest. In reality, you're probably about average, just like everyone else. My first time I actually bought a size too small, because I thought I was below average (self-esteem issues), but thankfully my girlfriend stopped me before I put it on and said she had brought an extra with her in case I bought one the wrong size (she thought I was going to buy too big). Turns out I'm average too! Second, it never hurts for her to be on birth control, but barring that, if she's not, if you really are that worried, even with a condom on, pulling out just as you're about to cum never hurts. Though be sure you know your own tells of when you're about to cum. I've heard too many stories from female friends about how their boyfriends don't always know when they're going to cum, so they're really bad at pulling out. You can't know there's not going to be leakage, but that's why condoms have such a high success rate. They almost never leak when used correctly. Honestly, you're probably just as safe cumming inside her if you have a condom on. I feel like I'm missing something, but I hope I answered your question thoroughly."
myfriendwantstoknow,2w5us0,rectumfucker,2,Tue Feb 17 14:02:42 2015 UTC,The 2 percent can happen when you go soft immediately after cumming and the condom doesn't stay on properly when pulling out. This is why you best take hold of the condom before you move out. Also: 2 condoms = condom rip.
myfriendwantstoknow,2w5us0,Fugera,5,Tue Feb 17 19:45:50 2015 UTC,Remember to leave some room in the tip. If it's too tight it can burst when you cum. Just by a normal sized condom and you won't have to worry about leakage. Def stay inside if you're a virgin. That's something you want to experience.
myfriendwantstoknow,2w5us0,MusicalXena,1 point,Tue Feb 17 11:58:23 2015 UTC,"You are aware that there are men out there with larger than average penises that average sized condoms will cause pretty major discomfort, right?"

myfriendwantstoknow,2w5us0,helasraizam,2,Tue Feb 17 18:35:38 2015 UTC,Youre supposed to cum inside but my friend usually pulls out a sec before cumming just to check out the condom isnt broken.
myfriendwantstoknow,2w5us0,Starshiee,1 point,Tue Feb 17 14:18:29 2015 UTC,you can always check that after: keep it under the tap and fill it. That way you can detect a leakage.
myfriendwantstoknow,2w5us0,coriacea,2,Tue Feb 17 19:46:49 2015 UTC,"If you do decide to finish inside, be sure that you are paying attention to step 6 of these instructions.  I would say that it is a personal preference and comfort level thing, for both you and your partner.  Withdrawal is a form of birth control.  While it is not very reliable as a sole birth control method, it is useful as a secondary method.  Since the potential consequences of pregnancy are life-altering for both people, this is a topic that is worth discussing with your partner in advance.    (If you're not comfortable discussing this with your partner, then it might not be the right partner or the right time in the relationship to engage in these activities.  That said, your friend should be proud of themselves for trying to learn as much about the topic as possible beforehand.)"
myfriendwantstoknow,2w5us0,mister_impossible,2,Tue Feb 17 15:17:53 2015 UTC,"I would advise your friend not to pull out when coming, because suddenly pulling it out could end up pulling it off, which is bad. And when you pull out after you cum, hold the base of the condom to make sure it doesn't come off (Which isn't all that likely, but it's good to do just in case).  Also your friend should know that you should pinch the tip of the condom when applying it so that the air bubble in the reservoir tip is out... That will reduce the chances of the condom breaking."
myfriendwantstoknow,2w5lht,throw_away11358,27,Tue Feb 17 03:41:27 2015 UTC,"This advice really depends on the severity of his fetish. Unless his foot fetish is much deeper or the only way he can get off I would suggest letting the relationship and sex life build organically.   What I mean is, have some sex, get a hang of that. Next, integrate foot rubs into your natural foreplay. Comment on the shoes she wears, tell her you like her toe nail polish, you prefer certain colours. Etc  Let this build over time. Like months. Get to know her. Eventually, casually let her know that in you really dig her feet. she'll probably understand herself by then. If it goes over well, awesome, see if she's comfortable giving footjobs."

myfriendwantstoknow,2w5lht,effegenio,6,Tue Feb 17 06:40:54 2015 UTC,"Well, first off, I would tell your friend to stop thinking like that.  The low self esteem isn't attractive to most people.  Also tell your friend to keep the fantasizing down for girls with potential.  It's a bit like leading yourself on and you're building up this person into something they may or may not be.  As for the nervousness, every guy has that.  You just have to persevere.  Like any ""skill"", practice makes perfect. Fake it 'til you make it.  Whatever you want to call it.  As for the foot fetish, I wouldn't open with that, as that will come off as creepy.  Unless you're on a foot fetish dating site.  Get to know the person first.  It really depends on the girl, so really only you can know the right time to ask about it after that."
myfriendwantstoknow,2w5lht,y0shman,3,Tue Feb 17 07:01:31 2015 UTC,"If a girl is into having sex, she'll probably also be into doing whatever her partner likes to do. Just bring it in gently.  Unless, as someone else said, the fetish dominates to the extent that it's the only thing that matters. Then she'll probably find it irritating."

If you find that she isn't allowing of your foot fetish, you've found it out early enough so to just call the relationship over. It's s a fetish, not a music style. If she isn't into foot play, not even begrudgingly, you're gonna have a hard time."

Riding transit (though I don't know what that's like where your friend is going to be) is a way to get sheltered and maybe sneak in a few moments of sleep. The downside is that it will be interrupted (end of the line) and theft of his stuff is possible depending on how soundly he sleeps.   Sleeping on the street is possible. It gets colder than you would think. A solid jacket and pocket warmers will help. It also gets dewy. That solid jacket and the rest of your clothes being water proof helps. You might be hassled. Cops don't like rough sleepers. Other people who sleep in a good spot won't be too happy if you take it, and might get violent.

myfriendwantstoknow,2vqttm,DrNowt,2,Fri Feb 13 08:55:11 2015 UTC,He has been to one and the doctor recommended changing his diet a bit and following up with him if the pain is still there. He said he could need surgery but for me to look into other ways to relieve the pain.

Normal routine is just wipe and then follow with special wipes, but as you know, sometimes a little more attention is needed.  You have to buy the more expensive toilet paper. It really makes a difference. Wipe with the nice stuff. Now grab those witch hazel wipes, dab. No wiping. That only causes more irritation. Dab. Then I run some hot water in the bath and sit down for a soak, and also wash with soap. Then comes the preparation H. I get the ""maximum relief"" kind. Even though it's not pleasant, after I've covered the area with PH, I used the little applicator that comes with it and squeeze some up in there. Then wash the applicator and my hands like a mad man. Sometimes I'll also use triple antibiotic ointment on the outer area if there's been any slight bleeding. My final tip is also to take stool softeners to lessen the strain on your anus when pooping.   Also, go see a proctologist. For the longest time my GP told me, just use PH (and deal with it). I made an appointment with a proctologist, and he informed me that my hemorrhoids are bad enough to warrent hemorrhoidectomy, and I'll be getting the procedure soon."

(1c water, 1tbs each soap and oil) (I mention the infant cuz the sensitive behind.)

Depending on what you want, be upfront if you just want sex, or flirt and get to know the person for who they are if you want a fulfilling relationship.   Idk if apps like tindr and things like that are over there, but I've heard they are good for hookups. Otherwise, just meet people in classes, events, parties, through friends, ect.  Be yourself, be open, don't think of other people as ways to gain what you want. Flirting is relatively easy really, just be friendly, smily, talkative, and try to read their body language.

myfriendwantstoknow,2vlx03,junkfoodvegetarian,4,Thu Feb 12 03:09:32 2015 UTC,"Typically, exempt positions are salary, so the pay per hour isn't an issue because there's not a typical timeclock being used.  The us department of labor website has all the info you'd need regarding federal laws for overtime.  If your state has any laws particular for overtime it will direct you to that as well.  Just an fyi, and i know its much much easier said than done, but if your current job is requiring work and production from you that you in good faith effort cannot complete in the 40 hrs per week (assuming full time job) available, your employer can't deny you from working overtime to meet those required production requirements and in turn can't deny you the commensurate overtime pay as well. A typical example is when an employer will require employees to 'flex' overage time as forced time off later in the week or following weeks, etc. rather than working those following days as regularly scheduled and earning overtime rates for the original overage."

The theory (yes, theory) is that an exempt employee is high enough in the pecking order that he can manage his time to accomplish the work in the time allotted.  When I first went to work at my Place Of Previous Employ, I was non-exempt and the first non-exempt employee my manager had ever managed. So he was scrupulous about making sure I got overtime for any extra time I worked.  Later, I moved up to exempt (and a higher pay grade) and we were more relaxed about the hours, but I still got extra pay if overtime was required of me."

It is passport-suspending arrest-you-on-the-plane-when-you-land type of shit.  Intentional failure to pay (such as what you are seeking) can be contempt of court and end up with jail time (not a criminal act though).  Children are not cheap.  Having a child is never cheaper than not having one.   The only way to get out of child support is to have a hardship that would prevent you from paying.  Cutting off your arms would probably do it.  There are international conventions regarding rights of children (UK and Canada being signatories), so these orders can be enforced in the other state (CSA has information about REMO).  Re: citizenship:  Children of UK parentage are UK citizens.  A child of parents with UK, Canada, and US nationality would be eligible for all citizenships (you would have to register the birth with each state).  Birthing a child in a state doesn't give you rights to live there.  A  child of non-citizens doesn't get citizenship unless would otherwise be stateless (relevant for UK)."

While I've never personally been steered wrong by an IRS rep, it does happen and a career tax advisor will know their shit for sure.   Don't assume you're getting money back. File regardless of expectations. If you do not file, the best case scenario is that you still lose your money.   It sounds like you're probably fine, but the IRS is relentless and their resources are no joke. Your wages can be garnished, your bank accounts levied, your assets seized. This happens to everyday people with less than $5K in debt. The IRS will try and take away your birthday.   File!"

myfriendwantstoknow,2vecij,SageKnows,6,Tue Feb 10 07:58:22 2015 UTC,"I looked around out of curiosity and seems to be a consensus that there's never been a real thorough study done about changes to your body chemistry because of less or more frequent orgasms, only conflicting anecdotes, which one can interpret as possibly saying that if there is an effect, it's very minor.  However, if your friend is a male, he may benefit better from frequent sex or masturbation in the long run.  Compulsive or habitual behavior is another matter. ""Constantly"" masturbating can be harmful to one's emotional state, psychology and function in society like any compulsive habit. Not to mention that if pornography is involved this can reinforce obsessive/addictive behavior and can become an addiction in itself.  If your friend is constantly acting out then it's a pretty good sign that there's a deeper issue that needs to be addressed. Sexuality and a healthy enjoyment of oneself shouldn't suffer or take the blame for depression, anxiety, or other disorders that can make someone want to escape reality or medicate themselves."
myfriendwantstoknow,2vecij,BigAngryDinosaur,5,Tue Feb 10 11:31:32 2015 UTC,"Masturbation actually increases testosterone in the body. Not having sex (or masturbating) for months actually lowers testosterone dramatically. (one of many sources for this) Some people want the benefits of testosterone e.g. for sports or to feel more aggressive, and those people should not avoid masturbating.  There is a common myth that having sex before a sports game makes athletes worse; this is not supported by any study. (one of many articles on this) (And given that having sex increases testosterone, that kind of makes sense.)  Not masturbating for a few days does increase the desire for sex, as most any man can tell you. This can affect your behavior in some cases (e.g. make you horny enough to ask someone out). But if abstinence is continued for months, the lack of testosterone will negate this benefit and your sexual desire will fade dramatically. This, too, can affect behavior. (Quickest source I could find, but this is a pretty well-studied thing if you google for it)   Lastly we have to talk about placebo-type effects, which can be very potent. If you believe abstinence will do <x psychological thing>, then it will have some of that effect. Possibly quite a lot of it. You might say ""yeah, but that's all in your head,"" but... so what? If it works, it works.  So there are a lot of people making a lot of claims about sexual abstinence, and they are all correct, given a certain mindset and belief. But in terms of physical effects, it's much simpler: masturbating keeps the body's chemical balance normal, and prolonged abstinence lowers testosterone very noticeably."

Put a little bit of water in a frying pan, throw a slab of ground beef in with it, then chop it up with a spatula and stir it around while it cooks to break it up. Then you strain the water off and you have a base for a ton of different meals. You can add a jar of tomato sauce a boil some noodles for really simple spaghetti, for example. Or you could add a packet of taco seasoning and some water and have tacos. Plus, cooked ground beef freezes really well so you don't have to worry about wasting it if you don't eat it all at once.

Those are basically all the same - heat food until it becomes more appetizing. I've survived on those several meals, pizza, and toaster strudels for longer than I'd like to admit. Once you get more comfortable in the kitchen, you might even want to start mixing it up - grilled cheese with a fried egg on it, or put an egg in your noodles to make it seem less depressing.

Buy a saucepan and a fry pan. Put sausages on the fry pan until they're cooked. Put potatoes and carrots all chopped up together in water and make it boil without boiling over. Cook for like ten minutes but check with a fork as you go. They're cooked when you'd be ok eating them. Sausages are cooked when you cut one open and it's cooked all the way through.

Not everything should be cooked at the hottest setting. If the pan is too hot, your food will be burnt on the outside and cold/raw in the middle. Start eggs and delicate foods on lower settings, things that you want to end up brown and crispy on medium settings.  When meats are put into a hot pan they need a minute to brown before you start moving them around or flipping them. Be patient for good results.   When seasoning,  there really aren't set rules on how much spices, salt, or pepper to use. Start with small amounts then keep adding a little at a time until you think it tastes good. You can always add more but once there is too much you can't take it away.   Those are just a few basics off the top of my head. Good luck!"
myfriendwantstoknow,2vcnm8,Justsoundsnasty,1 point,Tue Feb 10 06:48:44 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend trying to find a cheap slow cooker (crock pot in the US I believe).  It's a good place to start because you can throw in a load of raw materials and come back to a good meal when you can't be bothered to do anything after a day of crunching numbers or whatever.   They have the advantage that you can acquire the cheapest cuts of meat and turn them in to something really tasty.  It's also really easy to add vegetables so if you are worried about your micro nutrients you can keep them topped up.    Some good starting recipes to look up would be chilli (use turkey mince for a cheaper alternative), beef stew,  meatballs in marinara sauce (add the pasta when you get in and give it about another hour)  and various curries.  I like curry because depending what meat is cheap you can vary it up.  Pork? Vindaloo.  Beef?  Jalfrazi.  Find some cheap chicken thighs?  Butter chicken.

Then, tell them give it a year or so (bonus: plenty of time to reconsider) and then they can have an ""accident"".  Your friend should also check the laws in their country/state about it.

With a bit of research I found that all of the ITU radio bands are relatively harmless with the exception for all of this being that the thermal energy imparted into your body can be dangerous.  But anyway, I think you'll find this set of OSHA docs and regulations useful. Since com tower workers work on live towers, information here is relevant to working with live towers, so it should apply to climbing them live. It seems the heat from these towers can be quite high, so research into the tower to see how powerful it is and if it's powerful enough to harm you (hint: look at that safety warning on the bottom right of the last link.)

myfriendwantstoknow,2v7b6k,aaronis1,2,Mon Feb 9 04:21:08 2015 UTC,"The incident happened last night and it was her last pill of the month, she's on her period now."
myfriendwantstoknow,2v7b6k,RecyclableRaccoon,4,Mon Feb 9 04:35:43 2015 UTC,"If she's on her period now, there is an extremely tiny chance. She would have to have an unusually short cycle, which obviously is not the case if the pill is regulating it. Her egg would also have to be released extremely early in her cycle, like 3 days into the period, for the sperm to still be alive when the egg gets released (most people ovulate around 14-16 days into the cycle iirc) and the pill should prevent the egg from being released anyway. If you're on your period, there is an extremely small chance of getting pregnant even without using any form of birth control.   You may want to remind your friend that some people take the pill because they want to be able to cum inside and the pill is effective enough (when taken properly) that they don't have to worry about pregnancy. If she's worried about taking it on time or forgetting to take it, she may want to look into a form of birth control that doesn't have user error, like the shot or an IUD. Good on her for trying to be as responsible as she can be about this."

give it to a random friend for ""safekeeping"", give away a bunch of his money (if applicable) to random people, and maybe something random like putting his oven out on the curb with a ""free"" sign on it and giving his childhood possessions to a charity.  then, scatter a bunch of drug paraphernalia around his house (even better if he leaves some actual drugs, like heroin, meth, or cocaine), and a bunch of empty liquor bottles.   finally, call a couple of friends/coworkers in the middle of the night and apologize for acting weird, and say shit like ""i'm gonna make it right"" with no real explanation. it'll help if he can actually sound drugged up or drunk or something.   then he should hop in his car, drive up into the woods, or to the ocean, or to a popular suicide destination (the golden gate bridge, for example). leave some paraphernalia in the car, along with the keys, and just walk away, hop on a bus, and go somewhere else.   there will be a small police investigation once either the car is found, or (even better) if someone files a missing persons report, but once they start hearing about your friend's increasingly odd behavior, drastic weight loss, and depression, they'll write it off as a drug-fueled downward life spiral and assume your friend just ran off and killed themselves.  that's the easy part. the hard part is supporting himself afterwards. it's hard to make money without legal identification. it's possible to assemble a fake identity with someone else's social security number (this is how some illegal immigrants find work in the u.s.), but that can backfire pretty quickly if the person who's number your friend acquires dies, has a criminal record, or runs a credit report.   my recommendation would be to go a different route.   there's a whole underground culture of people in the u.s. who have managed to fall off the radar, legally speaking. depending on how adventurous your friend is, he could eventually join them.   -i know people who run or work on weed farms and haven't paid taxes in over a decade. it's like the crab fishing lifestyle, but illegal. they'll work a few months out of the year during ""trim season"", and earn enough to live the rest of the year. granted, they usually have a frugal life in the off-season, but they can still afford to feed themselves and travel.  -i know people who spent ten-ish grand on a boat, learned to sail, and now spend most the year sailing around the world. they'll find random under-the-counter jobs to pay for supplies, and then it's back to the sea they go.   -i know a couple older dudes that have woodworking or construction skills. they make a living by offering cheaper labor, but only take cash. the dude across the street from me hasn't had any contact with/from the government for something like 20 years.   -i know places in the u.s. where whole communities have sprung up in the middle of nowhere. the police know they're there, but don't/can't really do anything about it. slab city is one of them. there are others even further off the radar.   there's a whole list of skills your friend can learn to make off-the-record money in america. just look at the ""services offered"" and ""gigs"" section of your local craigslist. it's full of auto mechanics, general contractors, nannies, tutors, massage therapists (therapeutic and sexual), web designers, and housecleaners.   you think all those people are filing taxes on income they make on the side? hell no. i'm a massage therapist. i do have a legit job in a chiropractic office i pay taxes on, but when someone contacts me for my private practice (i have a space in my home as well), i pocket all that.   if i wanted to, i could lower my expenses by living on a boat or in an van or someshit, and maybe rent a room in a friend's house to work out of a couple days a week. then, i wouldn't have any paperwork anywhere attaching me to anything.   i wouldn't be legally dead, but barring getting pulled over by the police (which is hard for me cuz i'm kinda brown), i'd be effectively untraceable. statistically i'd be just another homeless person."

It takes its name from the concrete slabs that remain from the abandoned World War II Marine barracks of Camp Dunlap.  Several thousand campers, many of them retired, use the site during the winter months. These ""snowbirds"" stay only for the winter, before migrating north in the spring to cooler climates. The temperatures during the summer are unforgiving (as high as 120 °F) (48 °C); nonetheless, there is a group of around 150 permanent residents who live in the Slabs all year round. Some of these ""Slabbers"" derive their living by way of government checks (SSI, Social Security, and Social Security Disability) and have been driven to the Slabs through poverty. Others have moved to The Slabs to learn how to live off the grid and to be left alone. Still others have moved there to stretch their retirement income.  The site is both decommissioned and uncontrolled, and there is no charge for parking. The camp has no electricity, no running water, no sewers nor toilets, and no trash pickup service. Many campers use generators or solar panels to generate electricity. Supplies can be purchased in nearby Niland, California, located about four miles (6 km) to the southwest of Slab City.

The only way I can think of reasonably faking your death is to ""die"" in a large event where a- it would be unlikely to escape alive, and b- evidence would be destroyed or lost. Boat sinking,fires,  that sort of thing. I think this is probably not the way to go though since just leaving is easier and probably just as effective. If you just  go somewhere and start using a fake identity you can probably get away with quite a bit.

Very uncommon that a landlord will be ok with a sublet - also a risk you carry with subletting is that you are typically liable and responsible for anything that the sublessee does to the the property.   For breaking the lease: Some landlords will retain the deposit and/or charge you for all your remaining rent due on the lease - depending on how the lease was written and local laws. Some may also in report it to renter ""credit/tracking"" bureaus.  Transferring the lease to someone is the best option if the landlord is ok with it, though beware that often in that situation the new renter has to pay the applicable deposits to you. This can sometimes cause issues in making sure you get what is due to you if the new renter is dodgy.  Most local governments have a renter's guide that outlines your rights and responsibilities, might want to have a look at it to make sure you're prepared well for whichever scenario you select."

myfriendwantstoknow,2uwws9,m1tt,4,Fri Feb 6 02:45:09 2015 UTC,There's hardly ever protester there. I've never had to walk past protesters before. A church in my city does a protest like once a year but that's it.

I also hate buying tampons, anti diarrhea medicine, and other embarrassing items.  I'm not embarrassed that I have sex or that I menstruate, and I am definitely mature enough to do both of those.

Then you grab a pack of Magnums, because despite what it says on the box, they are designed to fit most regular sized dongs. Once you've obtained your purchase you walk up to that cashier with a swagger, slap those motherfuckers on the counter hard enough for the whole store to hear and then pay with a crisp hundred.

myfriendwantstoknow,2ut4il,v1nd3x,58,Wed Feb 4 23:09:08 2015 UTC,"You didn't specify, but if you are talking about a Catholic priest then your friend is safe. Some states have tried to force them to reveal confessions, but they never do. In Catholic church law, a priest that breaks what is known as the ""seal of confession"" is basically required to fly to Rome to be absolved by the pope himself, and even then he is pretty much stripped of all ministry abilities in the Catholic church. Because the sacrament of penance (aka confession) is believed to be a direct interaction with God, no priest would ever violate it. In the past priests have been put to death or imprisoned for refusing to violate the sacrament, and every priest I have ever met has said they would do the same.   Also, as far as I know the Orthodox are the same, but I don't know about Anglican/Episcopalian or any other Protestant priest/pastor."
myfriendwantstoknow,2ut4il,smp501,11,Thu Feb 5 03:03:44 2015 UTC,"If you are not catholic and don't plan on becomming one, can you still do confession? If so, how does it work? From my understanding it just sounds like a free place to tell someone shit to get off your chest. From a theological standpoint I disagree with the idea of confession, but from a practical standpoint it makes a lot of sense."
myfriendwantstoknow,2ut4il,Nowhere_Man_Forever,23,Thu Feb 5 04:50:19 2015 UTC,they don't card you or whatever but if you don't feel comfortable pretending you might just want to ask a local priest
myfriendwantstoknow,2ut4il,mongolrainbows2,3,Thu Feb 5 05:48:35 2015 UTC,"Well, because sacramental confession is an experience with God, most priests would not grant absolution to someone who is not a Catholic. I asked a priest about this once and he told me that if someone comes in who is clearly not Catholic (and it is often pretty obvious), he'll tell them that he'd love to sit down and talk with them, but not in a sacramental setting. Now, I don't know how exactly the laws (church law and secular law) work in this setting, but priests take confidentiality really seriously and would probably not tell, depending on your friend's intent. If a person comes in and is all ""I'm going to tell you something I'm not sorry about but you can't tell anyone"", he might react differently than to someone who is like ""I'm not Catholic but I need to tell someone about the bad thing I did because it's eating my soul""). Honestly, any priest would be up front with this if you asked him."
myfriendwantstoknow,2ut4il,smp501,5,Thu Feb 5 16:26:19 2015 UTC,You don't need to be a believer to enter a church and confess your sins. Your friend might want to start with the sin of not being catholic...

myfriendwantstoknow,2ut4il,Beldam,2,Thu Feb 5 13:35:16 2015 UTC,"Nah I have no intention of going to one just I think it might be a good option for some people. Again, I disagree with confession from a theological standpoint so there's really no need."
myfriendwantstoknow,2ut4il,Nowhere_Man_Forever,2,Thu Feb 5 13:37:21 2015 UTC,"The key here is usually that your tradition must have confidential confession as a part of its fiber. For instance, I'm a Baptist minister, and I can be compelled to share what people talk to me about (don't worry, I let them know ahead of time if it looks like it'll become an issue), simply because confession is not a part of my tradition.   There is a rite of confession in the Book of Common prayer in Anglicanism, and I think Lutherans have it took. Roman Catholics and the Orthodox definitely do. The lower liturgically your tradition is, the less likely the confession you make to a priest will be seen as a sacrosanct ""confession,"" and more like speaking to an authority figure that can be compelled to share the conversation.   Edit: Rite not right"
myfriendwantstoknow,2ut4il,smp501,2,Thu Feb 5 16:12:19 2015 UTC,"True. Regarding the Anglicans though, I just read recently that they voted to allow priests to violate the seal of confession under circumstances (I think things like murder and child abuse). The Catholic/Orthodox position, though, is that if there are exceptions that people won't come to confession at all and will miss out on the forgiveness that is part of it."
myfriendwantstoknow,2ut4il,smp501,3,Thu Feb 5 16:28:36 2015 UTC,"Anglicans/Episcopalians can violate based on their conscience, but not be compelled in my understanding. And yes, it needs to be because it's truly heinous."

myfriendwantstoknow,2ut4il,TuckerMcG,3,Thu Feb 5 16:32:39 2015 UTC,"It's also because it's unfair to the priest if you're simply using (in this tradition) him/her to unload some truly despicable acts, and don't really care about doing the necessary penance. Fun fact, if it is heinous, the priest usually will make your penance turning yourself in and confessing. Oftentimes the person who's using this as a tool to dump some emotionally charged terrible acts won't do this of course, but if you're truly religious than you probably will."

myfriendwantstoknow,2usz8k,Master_Philly-P,8,Wed Feb 4 22:28:39 2015 UTC,"Short version: Your doctor (and all of your healthcare team) do not tell anyone your medical information.   This includes:   Your parents/wife/family/anyone who knows you. The police. This is an important one - no one would be honest to their doctors (which is medically essential) if that information would ever be seen by the police. It's extra-difficult for the police to subpoena medical records. In many states, there are special protected classes of information, such as psychiatric or HIV-related information, which require an extra level of consent on your part to release.   Exceptions include:    If you are a threat to the life or well-being of yourself or anyone else. Other people who are part of the healthcare team. Releasing medical records to other teams/hospitals/etc. often requires an additional form to be signed, to communicate your consent. They also have these privacy guidelines. If you are a minor, some changes in the rules apply.   You should probably ask some follow-up questions since the devil is often in the details and I doubt I could have conclusively answered any real-life concern adequately."

If your friend knows his boss fairly well, and if he purchases them while off-duty, he shouldn't have too much of a problem. That being said, it would just be safer to get the tickets at another station all together to avoid any hassle.

They're also likely to be able to provide other recommendations if you're interested in that.  Personally, even with ADHD, I choose to not take Adderall because of tolerance issues/losing the honeymoon period. I don't want to hit a high level ""new normal"" and then potentially later lose it for the rest of my life. Just my personal preference, though, and I do medicate in other ways.  /r/theXeffect, /r/getdisciplined and /r/meditation would also be good subs if ""you"" have any interest at all in non-chemical solutions.

I don't want to hit a high level ""new normal"" and then potentially later lose it for the rest of my life.   I've been on Adderall for 3 years treating ADHD. Something that I learned pretty early is that the tolerance level is very easily swayed. If you get off of it for a week or two (depending on your dosage), get it out of your system, then you're tolerance to it is depleted by orders of magnitude. I tend to take it every other day because of the tolerance thing.   All in all, the tolerance to it is not permanent. The ""new normal"" thing does happen, and it all it takes is being aware that it's happening to prevent that (sorry if that indescriptive, people on Adderall will understand what I'm talking about)."

I stopped going to class the semester after the incident because I couldn't stay focused, and only later (6 years later, to be precise) started back to college.

If it's immediate release you can 1/2 the tabs.   Common sense tip: Have your friend do a trial run before before the night before the test. They wouldn't want to have a bad reaction and be unable to study when the test is 12 hours away.   Unless you have a prescription be careful around security/cops. Cops will bust you for possession.

myfriendwantstoknow,2ulq45,nathan_295,12,Tue Feb 3 04:38:37 2015 UTC,"Tell your friend to walk away from this. It never turns out good when there are 3 parties involved in this type of transaction.   The Lien means that a bank or a finance company actually owns the car until it's paid off. When it is, they will transfer title to the registered owner (the seller), who will then have to transfer the title to the buyer (your friend).   The ONLY way this can be done is for him to contact the Lien Holder, find out the payoff amount, and get the seller to acknowledge in a contract that any money paid will be given to the lien holder first, and any cash left over to the seller."
myfriendwantstoknow,2ulq45,Mremerkin,6,Tue Feb 3 05:53:50 2015 UTC,"Basically, the seller does not even own the car he is trying to sell to your friend. I wouldn't give him any money or take his word that the amount he is asking will even pay off the car loan."
myfriendwantstoknow,2ulq45,my2penniesworth,1 point,Tue Feb 3 06:06:29 2015 UTC,"If the lien is held by a bank with a local branch, you can simply conduct the transaction at the branch in person. Have the seller contact the bank ahead of time to make sure the title is available. You pay the bank, they pay off the loan, and give the seller any remainder. You walk out with the title.   If the lien is held by a non-local bank, say, Toyota financial or something, it should be largely the same, but with faxing of documents, wiring of money, and mailing of titles. The seller needs to contact the bank and ask them for a procedure on this. They do these transactions often and know how to best handle it."
myfriendwantstoknow,2ulq45,SelectivelyOblivious,1 point,Tue Feb 3 18:06:45 2015 UTC,"The only way to do this on the up and up is to just meet at the financial institution that the lien is through.

You say he's not afraid to make the approach, which is a common problem with most guys (lucky him!). But whether he is disgusted or afraid of the approach, the end result is the same: He is still not getting out of his comfort zone.   Ask your friend to push the boundaries a little, and not be afraid of what he might learn about himself. If he never tries to confront the issue, nothing will change, and he'll be stunting his growth.   I kind of know how he feels. I felt the same mix of revulsion, anxiety, and nervousness with every girl I hung out with, but with time it slowly began to pass.  It's still there, but it's much quieter, because my positive and negative experiences have given me a confidence in knowing who I find attractive."

myfriendwantstoknow,2u9846,acidambiance,2,Sat Jan 31 00:22:54 2015 UTC,"If she lives in Canada, could there be a mental health clinic somewhere that she could go to? I am not too familiar with the Canadian healthcare system but isn't it all free? Do you have to be of a certain age to go to a clinic by yourself?"
myfriendwantstoknow,2u9846,lacerbeams,3,Sat Jan 31 00:53:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, the system is all free. However, her concerns are about 1) what the process would be like to get a prescription and 2) how she could convince her parents that her ADD is severe enough."
myfriendwantstoknow,2u9846,KITTENpotato,2,Sat Jan 31 01:08:07 2015 UTC,"I can't say for sure how it works in Canada but I can tell you how someone who isn't me did it in the US. First, tell your doctor you have been diagnosed as a child. The ones in the states generally start people with a non stimulant like straterra. It works for some people, it made that person angry all day. You could report any of the known side effects to your doctor. They will then switch you to something else. The doctors switched him to  Ritalin, he reported another side effect. Finally they switched him to adderal.    Have you tried modafinil for studying? I hear it's easy to get in Canada. It's illegal in the land of the free, of course. Cough, cough, pardon me, I'm chocking on some irony."
myfriendwantstoknow,2u9846,DStewart1997,1 point,Sat Jan 31 03:13:28 2015 UTC,"My friend has ADHD and they were lucky enough to be prescribed medication for dealing with it through doctors. Your friend should speak to her parents and tell them how much she struggles and how she thinks she should perhaps try medication to see if it helps her (maybe even for a few weeks just to test it), hopefully they will agree and your friend will get medication that will help them. I would tell your friend to not rely on medication though, my friend doesn't take medication any more and he is much happier without it. (He used to take Concerta XL)"
myfriendwantstoknow,2u9846,StormyTheRabbit-,1 point,Sat Jan 31 12:44:37 2015 UTC,"First of all, I live in Australia but I hope this advice is general enough to help your friend.  Your friend needs to visit a normal doctor (in australia we call them GPs, in the US they call them family doctors, I don't know Canada's lingo) and tell the doctor exactly what she told you here. She only needs to be brief (mentioning her past diagnosis, how she is concerned about it affecting her studies, and would like to discuss the possibility of starting medication is all she needs to say. The doctor does not need a life story, nor are they qualified to make much of it). The doctor will then either prescirbe drugs or refer her to a specialist or both. Unfortunately, occasionally one will encounter a doctor who doesn't really believe in mental health issues, in which case your friend should not take it personally and rebook with a different doctor.  Assuming it is like Australia, there is a patient-doctor confidentality thing which means your friend's parents will only know as much as your friend tells them (or finds out). Even if your friend's mum is against medication, hopefully she realises your friend is old enough to make informed decisions about these things and does not try to interfere."

Unlike check kiting, which is illegal under nearly all circumstances, laws against credit card kiting are not completely prohibitive of the practice, thereby allowing it to be done to some degree. It is up to the banks to detect the practice and when necessary, stop it.  In order for prosecution to occur in a credit card kiting scheme, a bank must prove intent to deceive.

myfriendwantstoknow,2tzh6t,W0rldcrafter,1 point,Thu Jan 29 10:54:31 2015 UTC,If your card works like mine did back in 2007 the cash advance has a higher interest rate than a normal purchase and as you pay your debt down the credit card company puts the principal towards the low interest debt first. If you're planning to pay off the balance soon then no big deal but something to keep in mind.

I bought a resource book a few years back for fiction writers that lists publishing houses big and small, literary agencies, magazines and newsletters. (I can't remember the name of the book at the moment and I'm sure my copy is outdated).   There was a segment that had advice from some well known authors for getting published. The two points that I remember are:  1: Figure out what genre or niche your book fits into and shop it around to publishers that actually publish those types of books. If you wrote a western, don't send it to someone who publishes romance novels. Seems like common sense, but that's a common mistake people make.  2: Large companies require that you have an agent before they'll accept a manuscript submission. Smaller companies aren't as strict in that regard, but it really depends on the company.   Oh and 3: it's best to have your first book finished (and polished as much as possible) before you submit it. And I highly recommend NOT taking an advance if they do decide to publish it. If the book flops, you may have to pay it back.  As I said, I haven't been published (yet) but I haven't tried. Life has caught up with me and my novel is back on the shelf for now.

myfriendwantstoknow,2tubb7,lessthanjake,5,Tue Jan 27 18:05:15 2015 UTC,They don't have the right to ask what I get paid currently. I never even encountered a company asking my that question. Usually is something like 'what is salary do you want to get?'   The trick is of course not to set a to high demand and not toow either.  But there are lots of websites helping you with that.
myfriendwantstoknow,2tubb7,Suepahfly,3,Tue Jan 27 21:17:04 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I have. My current boss asked me what I was making at my old job, and brought me in several K higher. I didn't have a problem telling him, because I was so eager to leave the last position; I'd have taken any remotely-fair offer."
myfriendwantstoknow,2tubb7,LiteralPhilosopher,6,Tue Jan 27 22:43:41 2015 UTC,"I would encourage your friend not to mention his current salary. If asked, your friend could say it's comfortable, but he feels he's worth more. Salary is a personal piece of information and he should not be forced to answer."
myfriendwantstoknow,2tubb7,ProcrastinHater,3,Tue Jan 27 16:48:25 2015 UTC,"I think your friend is approaching this the wrong way. Like others have said, don't tell your salary to a company. Do some research (use sites like Glassdoor) and find the average salary for their profession, area, and level of experience. That should be around the number they're looking for.  After the interview is their best time to negotiate. Don't start talking about numbers until after the interview.* If they want tips on negotiating salary, I found this blog post helpful, and they may also find this Lifehacker article of some use.  * I'm not 100% on this, but I've been told that if they're working with a recruiter (i.e. someone who works for [RecruitCo] trying to get them hired at [JobCo], not someone who works at [JobCo] trying to get them hired at [JobCo]),  disclosing their salary requirements up front helps the process. Recruiters are often paid based on the starting salary, so they want it to be higher anyways. In this case, if they get asked ""What's your current salary,"" they should respond ""I'm looking for $$$"" without needing to tell the exact salary."

myfriendwantstoknow,2tubb7,careago_,2,Wed Jan 28 01:13:00 2015 UTC,"No, the only way any organization could even pull your W2 is by filing a 4506T form w/ the IRS-- that requires your signature first.   But yes, there are virtual 4506T businesses that do it as cheaply as $15."
myfriendwantstoknow,2tubb7,Kbot13,1 point,Thu Jan 29 21:54:30 2015 UTC,Gotcha. Sounds about right.  Do you think it would serve to the OPs benefit to embellish his annual salary in hopes increasing the potential offer?
myfriendwantstoknow,2tubb7,careago_,1 point,Thu Jan 29 21:59:18 2015 UTC,"The whole idea of an interview is how good are you at marketing yourself.  Usually if the company asks for a salary history, they're being quite informal formally saying that they want someone that has their head on the ground, knows their self worth, their value and why the game exists.  Having an underpaid salary does not excuse you from getting the job, why would it? It's that newest company's biggest (and easiest)  asset in luring you to work for them.  No one is going to bother with a lateral move, why? There's no value--- especially now in 2015. The economy is up up up, the world is on the move, oil is cheap and people quickly forgot how the world economy was like 2006-2009.   Lateral moves only hurt the employee, unless they're escaping a toxic employer, want to move to a new location --- or just possibly hate their co-workers.   Now, most companies don't go through the whole hassle of a 4506T, they really wouldn't. IF they do, then it's usually a security related job w/ the government (e.g. they want to see what you normally report as assets.) or financial job, though with this option it's severely limited- it's usually sharing your bank account information (to prevent embezzlement.)   Such examples: Working as an intern with a low salary in the field--- the average intern salary would be 25-30K--- but what you learn on the job (especially if you have a degree) could be worth 50-75K easily--- showing a salary history here is okay-- it means you were learning your skill in your sector, and had the excuse that you were, when you started ""inexperienced.""  As for this case, it depends. Everyone uses puffery and embellishes facts during Interviews-- HR isn't stupid, well..sometimes they could be.   It's best to avoid providing any physical evidence. Use your words. Words can have several meanings, depending on how it's said and what is said.   While a forged document off the bat makes you seem suspicious, open to deception and if caught you just become a bypassing comment in future interviews.   If it passes, then you'd know immediately that it could possibly be a simple document that they could use for termination at any future date-- some employers only hire these kind of people too (in toxic places, of course.) And that HR does not do it's job in terms of keeping employee quality up and high -- if you could get in via a forged document -- then who else has done it too?   At the same time, it could be luck, and the place really is great and they'd never go to verify the information, file it with your onboarding documents and welcome you to the team.   tl;dr verbally = go for it, don't reach for the sky-- but make it seem that you you make an ""average"" salary and you want a fantastic salary. If the position pays 70K, and you make 40, then go in saying you make 50K-- which is true, benefits and on the job treats ""could"" possibly pay for that-- how can any employer say that your current employers location with it's fantastic parking, close to shopping isn't a benefit in itself that you value at 5-15K?   Do not say I make 70K now, and I'm applying for the same job making 70K as well.. .suspicious, no one wants to deal with changing insurance, relocation, saying ""Hi, my name is Reddit I just moved here over from XYZ corp, what do I do? What's your name? Oh, snap did you hear of Carol in HR?""   tl;dr tl;dr treat it as a cute date with a girl, (or guy) keep it mysterious, embelish lightly and use magical language and be confident. Also, dress well. The best you ever have. :P"
myfriendwantstoknow,2tubb7,Kbot13,1 point,Thu Jan 29 22:54:29 2015 UTC,"I  actually made a lateral move. Well at least initially.  Was quickly promoted into management soon thereafter.  It wasn't a guarantee but the company I hired into had much more potential in terms of upward mobility.  Took a chance, leaving a job I liked, and it paid off in spades. That probably isn't the norm.   Either way, you presented some great points and I always appreciate a well thought out response."

myfriendwantstoknow,2tubb7,Bonerlander,3,Fri Jan 30 22:32:42 2015 UTC,"Two things,  some companies ask for w2 as proof of salary,  you probably could account for some missing income by saying that they didn't pay bonuses the last year but not a 40% gap.  That is your danger in lying.  Second,  you could also tell said company when asked it has to be worth it for you to switch companies and that number is 70k.  By you I mean your friend."

Pulling back the foreskin should be as easy as pulling a sock on to ones feet, if not easier.  My friend had an operation at a much younger age, around 7-8 years old, where they made a small cut to open up the foreskin. His condition was a bit more severe though, he could not pull back the foreskin at all.  After the operation, he was very sensitive to touch, as he had not come into contact with the glans at all before. Any way he tried to clean himself was uncomfortable, or even hurt. It took some time for him to be able to comfortably wash himself.  Condoms should always be put on with the foreskin completely pulled back. Anything else is highly dangerous, as it could easily lead to tearing of the condom.  Tl;Dr: Tell your friend to go see a doctor.    Edit: A better sock-related analogy would perhaps be to say that ""pulling back your foreskin should be as easy as pulling the edge of your sock up and down your ancle. Unless you have those tight sports socks, in which case I mean some loose tennis socks instead."""

myfriendwantstoknow,2tuq7t,mwich,1 point,Tue Jan 27 18:58:36 2015 UTC,"Phimosis:       Phimosis (/fɪˈmoʊsɨs/ or /faɪˈmoʊsɨs/  ), from the Greek phimos (φῑμός [""muzzle""]), is a condition of the penis where the foreskin cannot be fully retracted over the glans penis. The term may also refer to clitoral phimosis in women, whereby the clitoral hood cannot be retracted, limiting exposure of the glans clitoridis.   At birth, the foreskin is fused to the glans and is not retractable. Huntley et al. state that ""non-retractability can be considered normal for males up to and including adolescence.""   Normal developmental non-retractability does not cause any problems. Phimosis is deemed pathological when it causes problems, such as difficulty urinating or performing common sexual functions. There are numerous causes of so-called pathological phimosis. Nonsurgical treatment involves the stretching of the foreskin, steroid creams and changing masturbation habits. Surgical treatments include preputioplasty and circumcision.

myfriendwantstoknow,2tuq7t,autowikibot,3,Tue Jan 27 16:52:39 2015 UTC,"This happened to me a few years ago at your friends age. I never went to see a doctor because you really don't need to unless its really serious. I never even knew it was supposed to come all the way back if you were uncircumcised until I read a comment on reddit about someone else with a similar problem.   What your friend has to do is slowly stretch/pull back the foreskin. Do it 2 or 3 times a day, like just whenever you take a shower or go to the toilet. He should pull it back as much as he can before it starts hurting and make sure the skin doesn't tear. Start out doing it when it's flaccid and once you can pull it back completely when it's flaccid start doing it when it's erect. After 2 weeks of doing this I could pull it back completely while erect - it was still a bit tight but now it's completely normal. I wouldn't bother with a doctor before you try this. Another friend of mine had a similar thing and the doctor just gave him some cream and told him to do the same thing I had done.   Good luck!"
myfriendwantstoknow,2tuq7t,themuffinman131,1 point,Wed Jan 28 01:08:17 2015 UTC,"I would still recommend seeing a doctor, even if a simple stretching routine is all that is needed. A doctor is the only one that can make an assessment of what needs to be done."
myfriendwantstoknow,2tuq7t,ImNorwegian,3,Wed Jan 28 14:17:00 2015 UTC,"No soap, ever. The glans and inner foreskin are membrane, not skin. Soap dries them out, making them clingy and tight(er). Water only, and rarely. Pure aloe gel will help moisturize and may help with the tight foreskin.  I suggest your friend visit the phimosis discussion board. They have experience-based advice, for example, to pull the foreskin away from the body when stretching, instead of toward the body -- much more effective and far less painful."
myfriendwantstoknow,2tuq7t,wufoo2,1 point,Wed Jan 28 13:41:16 2015 UTC,My boyfriend actually has this too (due to a surgery as a child) but as long as it doesnt cause any medical issues (like problems urinating) he should be okay. If he is super worried go to a doctor though - they can give steriod creams etc. to help pull back the foreskin.

myfriendwantstoknow,2tt8rl,Sumfinclever,4,Tue Jan 27 13:54:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah but it depends on your router. Check if you can flash DD-WRT on your particular model, it has a lot of support for QoS, or Quality of Service. There's a section on mine called ""MAC priority"", so usually you would specify a MAC address (xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx) where the x's are letters or numbers that is tied to your computer's network card. Open up a command prompt on Windows and type  ipconfig /all   and look for the line under your preferred internet type (usually there will be two sections one for WiFi and the other for ethernet) and find the line usually titled ""physical address"".  That MAC address is how your router knows it's you.  Just look up your router model, DD-WRT, and Quality of Service. A bit of poking around should get you going."

Processed food is the backbone of most college diets and is awful because it's loaded with sugar, fat, or salt to make it more palatable (and shelf stable) and if you are unaware of how much you're taking in, you usually have WAY more than you need. Increasing fruits and vegetables is another small but impactful way of increasing over all health of diet.   Cooking is a skill that improves with consistent practice. Your friend should totally try to learn some basics and play around with them when he can. Budget Bytes is my favorite recipe blog because she posts step by step pictures which I feel helps me know if I've messed something up by comparing what I've got to what she's made.   Some things to ease into. Get your friend a crockpot. This is great cause they can literally set some meat and veggies in it before they go to class and come back to a meal. Lots of cooking takes time; it's sometimes better to make a bunch of food on an off day (I had late classes Wednesdays one semester, so I would spend the morning cooking) and eat that throughout the week."

In the US, you are entitled to one FREE credit report from EACH of the 3 top credit reporting agencies once every 12 months. The site you should use is HERE.  So, get one in January from Experian, get one from Equifax in June/July and the last from TransUnion in Oct/Nov. This way you can keep an eye on your credit ratings all year for free.  EDIT: as other's have commented, this is for a free REPORT only. Getting your credit SCORE is different and available FREE on other sites."

myfriendwantstoknow,2tnugo,JMV290,10,Mon Jan 26 01:16:41 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind the free credit report gives you your credit report and no actual score.  CreditKarma does use your SSN but I've been using it for 6 years or so and have had no problems.  I trust it.  They are free by advertising shit to you (the ads aren't particularly intrusive and could be generally helpful if you're shopping around for a newer loan or credit card)  If you have a credit card from Citi, Discover, or Capital One (and plenty of other banks I'm sure, but these I know for certain since I have them) they also offer you a free score, though it may vary depending on the bureau they pull from."

Some people are branches, they are there for you and hold you up but not necessarily permamnent, then you have roots. If you have 1 or 2 roots in your life you're doing just fine. ou look at people and you go 'Okay wait a minute. You or me?', you will make a decision. When you telling folks to do something... Now I've never thrown nobody away, I've never in my life just thrown anybody away saying 'Don't bother me no more, don't talk to me no more', I've never done that. What I DO is tell them, 'Look, this thing you doing right here is gonna cause a problem. You need to fix that because if we're gonna be friends and gonna be cool, you need to fix that. And if you don't, we're gonna have an issue'. If you see somebody fix it or even trying to fix it, that's somebody that cares. Keep those people around, that's a leaf that's trying to grow up and be something else. But if you tell somebody 'What you're doing is hurting me and I need you to stop' and they keep doing it, they don't care. Move on, let them go! No matter how much it hurts, let them go. And it'll get easier, I promise you. Every day, it'll get easier and easier and easier, you just have to make it through""  sorry it's long but I hope this helps you.    TL;DR tell someone what they're doing is bothering you. If they change, or try to change, they're decent people and worth the wait. If they aren't trying to fix the problem at all they don't care, let them go"

myfriendwantstoknow,2tknha,piston989,1 point,Sun Jan 25 05:10:30 2015 UTC,"Well, one course of action available is to find the root of the change and address it, and attempt to correct it if at all possible. Maybe the stressor is going through something very difficult in their life right now, and talking about it might help, especially talking about how the situation relates to your friend. If it is something that cannot be resolved, your friend may choose to sever ties civilly, simply by saying that they are at a point in their life where they cannot handle the tension that the stressor is bringing to them.  That or, you know, finding another chat room and ignore the problem. Depends on how close your friend feels to this person and how much they feel this person deserves closure in the relationship."

That's not the only reason most thirt businesses fail, it's all about how you market your shirts, and also don't forget about the quality of your shirts either (silk screening vs heat press). I'd suggest silk screening since some heat transfers are known to look like shit after a few washes. If you do go with the heat press method, then I'd suggest buying a good quality heat press machine. you can find them on Amazon and Ebay for a decent price. You can find guides on how to build your own silk screening machine.   If you're serious about this then I suggest watching this video.   EDIT: Shit, I misread band, thought it said brand.

If your friend already had a TMJ issue, and then suffered trauma to the jaw, that could certainly worsen the condition.  Personally, I'd side on getting it checked out...    If your friend is in the US, check out this site, which has a database of free/low-cost/sliding-scale clinics for uninsured and low-wage patients.  If there's nothing listed in his area, google ""sliding scale clinics"" or ""sliding scale hospitals"" along with his location, and he might find some clinics the database hasn't added yet.

I asked the doctor about similar pain in the jaw, and his response was elucidating. The jaw is just a dangling bone, held up by your jaw muscles. If they've been damaged (bruised, etc.), then every jaw use/movement is going to be painful.  If the pain is constant, with a similar threshold, then it's worth worrying about. If this is not the case, then you may have to just suck it up. Take that as a good sign."

I've taken it probably a hundred times as a healthy guy < 40 years old.  You don't need a special condition to get a prescription.  My original script was just prior to my wedding, and I told my doctor that I was a bit nervous that I wouldn't be able to perform on my wedding night, what with all the associated stress, family drama, drinking, etc.  I got a script for 100mg - the big, diamond shaped blue pills.  He recommended taking no more than a half of one, but start with just a quarter of the pill.  So that's what I did, and let me tell you, within 20 minutes I was transformed from a normal man into Captain Ultimate Hammercock.  It was god damn incredible.  I still bring some whenever my wife and I have romantic getaway nights.  Our sex life is pretty good normally.

Of course, I am neither a lawyer nor a lab tech, so your friend should do their due diligence on this point.  Your friend should, however, be more careful about divulging biographical details a sensitive context like that.  Basic OpSec requires that you not tell more information than is required.  Just telling us when your friends' court date is, the charges against them, makes your friends' identity fairly discoverable.  Court records are, after all, public record.  A better way for your friend to phrase their question would be ""how long after I drink alcohol will it be detectable in a blood test?"".  This gives us all the information we need to answer the question, without divulging any unnecessary details.

It sounds like the clinician was saying this to scare your friend into using condoms in addition to the birth control.    If it is a birth control pill, the pill needs to be taken around the same time everyday, and not miss any days.  If you miss a day or two, the effectiveness will not be as great and she could get pregnant.  Tell your friend it might be a good idea to set an alarm on her phone or something.  Also, it doesn't protect against pregnancy immediately after starting unless you begin taking it while on your period.  Otherwise your friend should also use condoms for the first 7 days after starting the birth control.  I used PP while I was younger and they never told me weird stuff like this.  How disappointing, because otherwise I think they are a wonderful organization."

myfriendwantstoknow,2t0lez,deathcab4booty,5,Tue Jan 20 04:13:33 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter where your friends want to get married, but being married would certainly help. I'm not too familiar with immigration laws in the US, but I'm currently going through the nightmare (yes, nightmare) of getting my American wife settled in Canada. If your friend decides to settle in the great white North, know his options are limited, but there are a few. Marriage isn't 100% necessary, but it does help. The other options are common law sponsorship, but your friends will have had to reside together for two years, and then there's conjugal sponsorship which can be undertaken but application must be made from outside the country. Now if it's just a matter of you two friends staying together, note that he doesn't have to leave on March 1st, he can apply for an extension of his visitors visa, the fee is $100 (cdn) and can be done online, just google CIC extend visitors visa (this is all assuming your friends fiancé is here on a visitor visa). Now to go this route will buy your friend another 6 months with their SO, but they cannot work or attend school as doing so and getting caught will severely hurt their chances of settling in Canada. Your friend will also have to provide proof that he is willing and able to financially support his fiancé that can be done with a pay stub or letter of employment from his employer scanned and sent to CIC with that application.   The other other route is to try and apply for a work visa, if you're friends fiancé is trained in a field Canada needs they can apply and get a closed work permit (only allowed to work in that relevant field) this will allow your friends to live together until spousal sponsorship or common law sponsorship becomes an option (when they're either married or live together long enough). However your friend should be prepared to spend some cash when it comes time to do that. If your friend has any questions about Canadian spousal sponsorship feel free to pm me. Best of luck to him. LDR's are a bitch and he has my sympathy."

myfriendwantstoknow,2t0lez,kitnbit,2,Tue Jan 20 17:18:09 2015 UTC,"My husband and I are going through this process right now. It is very frustrating. We decided it would be easiest for us to get legally married in Canada as soon as we decided we wanted to get married and plan a proper wedding later. I've been staying with him ever since in Canada, but not for longer than 6 months at a time. We contacted the CIC to find out how to proceed so that I would have status here. They set us up with a free consultation over the phone with a company that specializes helping similar cases. It was very helpful, and I definitely recommend it. If you decide to get married, he can sponsor you to live in Canada. You have to decide if you want to apply inside or outside of Canada. Both have their pros and cons. For example, if you apply from within Canada you are eligible to apply for a work visa, and this entitles you to public health care. This just went into effect in December. It is not recommended that you travel outside of Canada during the process (which could be as long as two years) If you are denied entry into Canada (which is likely, I hear) your application will be thrown out and you have no right to appeal. If you apply outside of Canada, you are not eligible to apply for a work visa, and thus are not covered by the public health care, but you are free to travel as long as your visit does not exceed 6 months, you have the right to appeal if your application is denied, and if your are ever denied entry at the border it does not effect your application.   Other things to consider- It is a very long and expensive process. The fees come out to 1,040 and that isn't including the price of the medical exam and background check that you need.  I don't know as much about American visas, but to my understanding they do have a fiance visa that is called a k-1 visa. Hope that helped!"

Do not attempt this reaction without a containment hood and a sizeable safety barrier.

It will fuck your friend's shit up if given a tenth of a chance.  If your friend has the necessary safety gear and wants to go ahead with this, you should probably still dissuade them.

Hazards of article  Thermite:       Thermite usage is hazardous due to the extremely high temperatures produced and the extreme difficulty in smothering a reaction once initiated. Small streams of molten iron released in the reaction can travel considerable distances and may melt through metal containers, igniting their contents (see images). Additionally, flammable metals with relatively low boiling points such as zinc (with a boiling point of 907 °C, which is about 1,370 °C below the temperature at which thermite burns) could potentially spray superheated boiling metal violently into the air if near a thermite reaction.

Almost flunked out of high school yet he still managed to get accepted into a program Ford used to have for upcoming engineers.  Him and a bunch of college graduates.  It was funny.  He washed out quickly because he liked drugs more than money, but that's the way it goes some times.  But when he was in high school he once jury rigged together a ford-chevy-dodge pickup that we called the dud.  It was a work of art.  It once hit 120 in the quarter mile.   He won a ton of cash off of it because idiots would look into the engine compartment at this rats nest inside.  Wires going everywhere, rusty parts, converters to make pieces work together ... there was no way this truck would be able to stand up to a race.  Then he'd smoke them.   Time after time he raced through Texas and New Mexico, finding sucker after sucker.  But one day he was driving home late at night after going to a bar.  The cops caught him and he decided to outrun them.  He did.  By far.  He left them in the dust as he ran down those back country roads.  The only problem he had was that truck only got around 2-3 gallons per mile when he let it out, which meant the cops found him a few miles later out of gas."

It doesn't have a radiator or anything water running through it, so the engine is very light and very, very small. I've been learning a ton!  My friend, Steven, has an interesting story.  Growing up he was surrounded by engines.  He and his dd rebuilt well motors for local farmers.  He worked on engines for years.  He absolutely sucked at school, just squeaking by.  He was not a very good looking guy by any standards.  Tall and gangly, with a face that was average at best. But he still ended up dating a long string of beautiful girls.  They were attracted to his confidence.  It was all he had, but it worked.  Out of high school he got a job at a Ford dealership.  He wasn't that great as a mechanic as Ford wants you to follow the instructions and that wasn't ever his style. He almost got fired several times, but one day he was showing off a new invention and a higher-up from Ford happened to walk in. The guy was impressed by Steven's creation and ended up sending him to Ford's engineering school, all bills paid.  Steven flunked out quickly.  He wasn't good at following directions, but it would have been interesting to have seen where he ended up...  Over the last 20+ years he's moved around a lot.  He was employed by a rich family in San Antonio as a groundskeeper, pool boy, etc.  He apparently lived the dream of having sex with the rich wife while the husband was away.  Now he's happily married to a fat ugly girl, and couldn't be happier.    Such is life..."

People saying you can't outrun radio's are mistaken as it is not only likely but almost certain that if you can outrun a insert you're favorite LEO's name to the next offturn and pull into a parking lot/behind a house/up a driveway you are basically golden.

And even in the wet, bikes always go faster around the track (in the ones I've watched anyway - feel free to post other videos). Cars just cannot compete with the exit speed out of corners.   Of course, you need to be a SKILLED rider to pull this off.  If the bloke above is talking about 1 corner, then yes cars are faster...  Or at least have a faster approach speed into the turn.   BUT - in a series of corners (any road or track) given the faster exit speed and straight line acceleration of bikes, a skilled rider will walk away from a skilled driver any day."

You'll get a message saying that your search has been accepted. A few seconds later a searchbot will offer you a file, so accept the download. That will send you a .txt file that's zipped. Extract that and you'll get a list of files. I searched for Lian Hearn and got a list of 147 files.

myfriendwantstoknow,2smvbi,Pindaroo,17,Fri Jan 16 16:07:53 2015 UTC,Maybe your friend could just look into getting the screen replaced. It's usually not that expensive and it will be better than having a useless phone after the company denies your claim because you obviously did something to it.
myfriendwantstoknow,2smvbi,Futurames,-1,Fri Jan 16 15:50:07 2015 UTC,Where do you live that it isn't that expensive to replace the screen? Where I am it costs between $200-$350 to replace the screen on the iPhone 6. (As of this week)
myfriendwantstoknow,2smvbi,youre_a_baboon,7,Fri Jan 16 16:05:57 2015 UTC,"That's still a lot less than replacing the phone entirely. If you just fix the screen or live with it until you can afford to fix it, worst case scenario is you have a functional eyesore. If you mess with the phone and break it on purpose, you're risking the company not covering the damages and then you've got a $600 paperweight."

She tested it a few times, and when it didn't work for her I just said it only happens sometimes. I wasn't lying, that was actually happening.   But that still wasn't the main reason why I went in that day to get it repaired. All 3 of my apple store visits were because I dropped my phone, and the screen had a crack.

myfriendwantstoknow,2sjpwn,Trumpetsling,4,Thu Jan 15 20:08:28 2015 UTC,"Through some searching ( five mins on google) your friend should expect these kinds of consequences for identity theft.  Like all criminal laws, identity theft laws differ from state to state, and there are also federal identity theft laws that have their own penalties. Being convicted of an identity theft crime can lead to one or more of the following penalties:  Incarceration. A conviction for an identity theft crime can result in a significant incarceration sentence. In general, a conviction for misdemeanor offense can lead to up to a year in jail, while felony sentences can result in several years or more in prison. Fines. It’s common for courts to order someone convicted of identity theft pay a fine. Misdemeanor fines can sometimes reach in excess of $1,000, while felony fines can easily exceed $5,000. Restitution. If the identity theft results in a victim losing money or suffering financial harm, courts will also typically order restitution. Restitution is designed to compensate the victim for his or her loss, while fines are designed to penalize the perpetrator. Restitution awards vary, depending on the circumstances of each case. Probation. For first-time offenders of identity theft crimes that do not result in significant harm, it’s possible a court might impose a probation sentence in addition to, or separate from, other penalties. Probation usually lasts at least a year, but sentences of three or more years are also common. People on probation have to comply with specific court imposed restrictions, such as reporting to a probation officer, paying all restitution and fines, and not committing other crimes.

Have them do a Google search for Mental Health ACCESS or Community Mental Health for (county or city name).   I'm a nurse and I work for a free medical clinic and this is where we refer patients who just need mental health care and have no other medical problems.  As to meds, some common anti-depressive meds cost only $4-$10/month (celexa, prozac). If your friend has to be put on any meds, tell him to let the doctor know he can't afford the costly ones or he can see if the county has any programs to help him with his meds.  There is also a website called goodrx.com that will tell your friend who sells the med at the cheapest rate within his zip code area. Just be sure to edit the information on the left side of the screen to include dose/strength, type of pill (capsule/tablet) and number of pills ordered (30/60/90 days). Putting in all that info will get the most accurate price.  PM me if you have any other questions.   EDIT: I just read that he is under 18 y.o. so he will most likely need a parent to go with him.

They don't care about his previous medical bills, they only care that their kid (and he will always be their kid) is happy.   If he's not feeling happy and there is something, ANYTHING, they can do to change that they will do what ever they can. It's not about money, in never has been or will."
myfriendwantstoknow,2sgy0r,Wish_you_were_there,2,Thu Jan 15 10:22:23 2015 UTC,"That really should be the choice of the parents, though. I'm sure they want him to feel better and the fact that they could help, but aren't due to not knowing, is actually pretty sad.  You can draw a parallel if your friend has a pet. Imagine the pet being sick, with your friend having the power to help, but being unable to do so because they don't realize the pet is sick.  Having said all of that, if the family is strapped for cash and unable to pay, then a lot of psych clinics either charge on a sliding scale (based on your income) or even have some free/charity programs.  Your friend really should look into cognitive behavioral therapy, which is a fairly effective form of therapy that can be used to treat depression. Sometimes it isn't enough by itself, but getting a ""cure"" in the form of therapy is better than treating the symptoms via medication.  Medication isn't bad, though, and should be pursued if it is necessary.  Just be careful since psych meds can have fairly annoying side effects, and they often take 4-6 weeks to kick in.   There are also some antidepressants that are common (and effective) prescriptions in other countries which are unscheduled/inexpensive in the US, though this has the potential for serious complications and should only be considered after all other options are exhausted. I'd say CBT -> see how that goes and, if necessary, talk to the therapist about seeing a psychiatrist for medication if needed."

Tell your friend to try different angles that allow for more air between the cheekies, standing, sitting like in a chair and not a bed, in the shower, or the always fun on your knees and hip thrusting.  I would also add that if it looks like a sprinkler or a garden hose or something, that it's worth checking with a doctor or something.  Your friend wouldn't (necessarily) have to say what caused the sweating, just that there is a lot of sweating in his crease.  Again, I'd probably only do that in severe cases.

myfriendwantstoknow,2sb01l,jerrytheman1998,6,Wed Jan 14 09:08:11 2015 UTC,"Some, if not all, of the chubby cheeks could be due to genetics (look at family members for a clue), but if your friend is overweight then weight loss can help a lot, but that is all proportional. Also if they are still growing they may grow out of them. Otherwise your face is your face. Lots of people wish they had more prominent cheeks so at the end of the day it's better to have chubby cheeks than no definition in your face."

myfriendwantstoknow,2sb01l,anyakinskywalker,2,Tue Jan 13 20:03:08 2015 UTC,"I went through this exact situation. I went with surgery. Liposuction in the cheeks and under-chin is necessary. Also, doing lipo only, will leave you looking sick or unhealthy so small cheek implants and a chin implant are also required to keep your face balanced.  Now, it may seem like chubby cheeks have a lot of fat but they actually don't. There is less than a tablespoon of fat on each side. Also, there are many nerves in the area limiting how aggressive the doctor can be with removal. After surgery much of the lower face and lip will be numb and take at least a year to return to normal, for the swelling to go down and for the nerves to re-grow/re-connect. It's a big commitment and you'll spend at least 6 months regretting it because your face will be even bigger until it fully heals. The good is that once the fat is gone, it's gone."

Unless your friend is competition-ready in terms of bodyfat composition they can stand to lose some.   If your friend is a guy then he has the option of working on jaw muscles which is easier than you'd think. Start chewing 3-4 pieces of gum until it softens. When it does, add a piece of ice to the mix and repeat. Do this for an hour a day and results will be quick.  Options that aren't recommended but will do the trick:  Get dehydrated and drop your sodium intake.  Smoke cigs for a year or two."

myfriendwantstoknow,2s6mz5,aasteveo,1 point,Mon Jan 12 23:16:37 2015 UTC,"The 911 of walls of text!   Your friend will most likely not get a job selling at a Porsche dealership without a proven track record in sales. On the other side of the coin, a high end automobile sales consultant does not make his business just on car knowledge alone, most of the job is about relationship management, High end customers don't have concerns about affordability so to them is not about the deal or price, it's the experience of buying a Porsche.   A sales background is generally required. You don't need to be a Porsche expert, but knowing your product (at least what you're selling) is essential for success.   Also, all car sales jobs are commission only. Dealerships usually pay a low hourly wage weekly, but any payments made to you are taken back out of your commission when you sell a car. If you don't sell enough in a certain amount of time then your 'salary bucket' fills up (money you owe to the dealership for paid wages) and the dealership will terminate you for not performing.   On the upside, Porsches pretty much sell themselves. If you are successful at managing your clients you will make good money on commissions. And yes, from time to time you'll get customers that will buy/lease more than one car, but most of the money is made on repeat customers.  If you are better than average, the dealership has a good commission plan, and it's a good market (location), you'll be looking at around $80k to $100 a year. Work weeks are usually 60 hours, 6 days a week.   EDIT: forgot to type the part about how much!"

When you ignite it, you can see the earth rise and fall in the pattern of the underground tunnels.  It looks dope!    A good ol' waterhose is typically plenty to flood out a few gophers here and there.  Just post up with a shovel and look for where the water is breaking the surface.  Wet gophers can't move so well.    If you are seeing them breach on their own, consider investing in a small spring or pump-action pellet rifle - .177 or .22 should do you just fine for gophers and you should be nearly silent.    When I was growing up on the farm, I had a cat that would follow me around and when I'd flood out gophers, he's simply snap their necks and move on with me.  If it were a slow day, he'd play with them a bit prior to ending their lives.

myfriendwantstoknow,2rto2m,pschnet007,8,Fri Jan 9 04:21:51 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Though I'm not sure how much what I'm about to say could actually help you since I don't know of any commercial programs that could do this. There is a mathematical operation called a fourier transform which can convert any signal (such as music) into it's frequency representation (eg. You get a graph showing how much of each frequency is in the music). If you know someone with programing knowledge, particularly Matlab, you may be able to do it yourself. This is the part I start to be unsure of because I'm not sure exactly how to do it without affecting the timber of the music. If you did a full transform of the song and saw a bump around 125hz you may be able to essentially copy and paste this bump to the lower register then remove the base at 125 to get a similar sound. As I'm writing this however I'm beginning to think about it and it may be more complex. You may have to do a different type of fourier transform (I think this is technically called a fast fourier transform) where you split the music up into short time chunks, do fourier transform on each of those individually, move the bump in the data as described before for each. But even then I think it won't sound the same because even base is going to have higher harmonics associated with it which you would want to move respectively but will probably be difficult to separate from the rest of the music. However I don't know a ton about music and someone may have developed a program to do just this.   Tl:Dr I think I described a research probably wasn't helpful since I don't know a program that already does this but hope you find it interesting."

myfriendwantstoknow,2rto2m,rock_hard_member,5,Fri Jan 9 17:43:55 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you would want to lower just the notes of the bass, because that would make the song out of key, unless you're doing it by an octave.  Melodyne might be able to do it, that program is straight up magic.  It's likely it wouldn't sound good, though.  If you are doing it by an octave, your friend can try using FL studio to pitch shift it by -1 octave, then low-pass it and add it back into the untouched track.  That probably won't sound good either, too.  (After reading the other answers, this is pretty much the same as /u/GreatAlbatross')"
myfriendwantstoknow,2rto2m,asphyxiate,3,Fri Jan 9 10:02:05 2015 UTC,"Does he want to remove the bass line entirely and replace it with a lower one, or just reinforce it with a lower harmonic?   Both are doable.   If you halve the frequency of a note, you shift it down an octave, and the same for an Audio sample. Halve the frequency, shift the pitch down. (A4 is 440Hz, A3 is 220)  What you want to do is duplicate the track, halve the pitch of the second track (time stretching if you need to adjust the speed back to normal), then add a low pass filter at, say, 80Hz ((original band+margin for error) /2).  That would give you the song, plus a second track with everything under 160Hz shifted down.   Then, if you want to, apply a high pass filter to remove the original bass, at, say 160Hz. His mileage may vary.   All of this can be achieved in free software (audacity), if not the software you already use.   Also, unless you are using some serious kit, it might be worth adding another high pass to the final product at around 10 Hz, just to remove any ridiculous sub-bass."
myfriendwantstoknow,2rto2m,GreatAlbatross,1 point,Fri Jan 9 08:10:02 2015 UTC,"Um, well your question could go a couple different ways.

myfriendwantstoknow,2rsnh8,oh_no_aliens,10,Fri Jan 9 06:28:27 2015 UTC,Pro tip: go to a legit massage studio if you're looking for massage without the happy endings. Any licensed and insured massage therapist will not offer happy endings because they risk losing the ability to practice their profession.
myfriendwantstoknow,2rsnh8,rainbowtastical,9,Fri Jan 9 14:33:53 2015 UTC,But they don't have chubby asian chicks....

myfriendwantstoknow,2rsnh8,rainbowtastical,2,Fri Jan 9 14:38:49 2015 UTC,How can I tell the difference?
myfriendwantstoknow,2rsnh8,ButtPlugNoob,12,Sat Jan 10 17:12:15 2015 UTC,yes.
myfriendwantstoknow,2rsnh8,Beldam,3,Thu Jan 8 23:48:49 2015 UTC,"From a legal standpoint? Yes.  From a ""hey what do you think personally?"" standpoint? Yeah, gonna go with yes here, too, barring that you went for what you absolutely thought was a legit massage, totally above board, and it gets offered and you don't say no."
myfriendwantstoknow,2rsnh8,lacerbeams,9,Fri Jan 9 10:44:45 2015 UTC,"I always thought that it doesn't, because officially what you are paying for is the massage, and it's not really ""on record"" that you're paying for the handjob. Unless it's listed somewhere in the shop like ""massage plus handjob."" Just like the private rooms at strip clubs. You're paying for time in the room, and whatever happens in there is not officially what's being payed for, just expected. That's how it was explained to me anyway."
myfriendwantstoknow,2rsnh8,Assmeat,14,Fri Jan 9 00:28:02 2015 UTC,"That sounds like some lawyers excuse after getting caught. I don't know if that would work in court anywayd as it would probably be assumed you are going there for the hand job, I'm sure the rub and tug joints are known by police. Prostitutes I'm sure have similar tactics ie. Pay for a date and see what happens. Morally it is paying for sex/hand job"
myfriendwantstoknow,2rsnh8,jakew64,4,Fri Jan 9 02:04:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah but it doesn't really matter if everyone assumes you went into the back room for sex, or even if it was so heavily implied that they essentially know you did, it's what they can prove you did that matters, & the books saying ""1 visit to back room"" isn't anything illegal at all"
myfriendwantstoknow,2rsnh8,Assmeat,2,Fri Jan 9 02:13:50 2015 UTC,"Of course not, they have to catch you in the act either explicitly asking for it or in the actual act. If the cops walk in your excuse can't be the massage therapist thought I was hot and decided to jerk me off, that wouldn't work."

myfriendwantstoknow,2rsnh8,rubmetugme,1 point,Fri Jan 9 22:10:26 2015 UTC,"It depends.   What kind of happy ending did you get, and who wants to know?  My definition of sex is that it involves contact between genitals, mouth, or anus...in any combination.  So a handjob is not ""sex"" but a blowjob would be.  If you want to ask your girlfriend, mother, or priest, they might have different ideas.  If you're worried about running afoul of your local law, that depends on the jurisdiction.   Even if it is illegal where you live, your local law enforcement might have higher priorities."
myfriendwantstoknow,2rqupc,throw_away11358,21,Thu Jan 8 14:37:02 2015 UTC,Tell your friend is completely normal. He probably spends a lot of time with her and she just happened to be on his mind before he started dreaming.

myfriendwantstoknow,2rqupc,wives_nuns_sluts,10,Thu Jan 8 15:08:02 2015 UTC,I've had sex with pretty much every one of my male family members in dreams before and I'm obviously not attracted to any of them. It's perfectly normal to have strange or erotic dreams about people in your life.
myfriendwantstoknow,2rqupc,SaidIToMyself,3,Thu Jan 8 16:19:55 2015 UTC,"If the shit I did in dreams had any correlation to real then I would be one messed up and conflicted dude. But it doesn't, it's just random.   In high school these dream crush things things seemed  happen as a result of dreams rather than the trigger to dreams. Eg: I would not have even considered someone, then had a dream, started considering them, then eventually realize that I don't actually like them in real life.  Brains are weird."
myfriendwantstoknow,2rqupc,mjbyrd,4,Thu Jan 8 20:59:32 2015 UTC,"Scientifically speaking, dreams have little to no meaning. They are your brain's visual interpretation of neural impulses which occur while you are asleep. Sometimes the random thoughts in your head contribute to these visual interpretations, which is why you often dream about people you know and places you've been, yet the dreams make little sense."

Patents protect a design of how something works. Your friend makes a superbong that doubles THC intake per hit, that would be something to patent.  Copyright protects an idea in how it looks or feels, generally the intangible stuff. Your friend writes a song for Willy Nelson, or paints the stoner Mona Lisa, that is where copyrights come into play.  Names, and other things on how you refer to a product are protected by trademarks. Your friend's name would need trademark.  Still for trademark protection, you need to use it with in so many years or lose the trademark. Also you need to defend any encroachment in court, or be seen as abandoning the mark."

(Which he is not, I'm sure.)"
myfriendwantstoknow,2rp76u,autowikibot,4,Thu Jan 8 07:13:42 2015 UTC,"Plant breeders' rights:       Plant breeders' rights (PBR), also known as plant variety rights (PVR), are rights granted to the breeder of a new variety of plant that give the breeder exclusive control over the propagating material (including seed, cuttings, divisions, tissue culture) and harvested material (cut flowers, fruit, foliage) of a new variety for a number of years.  With these rights, the breeder can choose to become the exclusive marketer of the variety, or to license the variety to others. In order to qualify for these exclusive rights, a variety must be new, distinct, uniform and stable. A variety is new if it has not been commercialized for more than one year in the country of protection. A variety is distinct if it differs from all other known varieties by one or more important botanical characteristics, such as height, maturity, color, etc. A variety is uniform if the plant characteristics are consistent from plant to plant within the variety. A variety is stable if the plant characteristics are genetically fixed and therefore remain the same from generation to generation, or after a cycle of reproduction in the case of hybrid varieties. The breeder must also give the variety an acceptable ""denomination"", which becomes its generic name and must be used by anyone who markets the variety.  Typically, plant variety rights are granted by national offices, after examination. Seed is submitted to the plant variety office, who grow it for one or more seasons, to check that it is distinct, stable, and uniform. If these tests are passed, exclusive rights are granted for a period of 20 years (or 25 years, for trees and vines). Annual renewal fees are required to maintain the rights.  Breeders can bring suit to enforce their rights and can recover damages for infringement. Plant breeders' rights contain exemptions from infringement that are not recognized under patent law. Commonly, there is an exemption for farm-saved seed. Farmers may store the production in their own bins for their own use as seed, but this does not necessarily extend to brown-bag sales of seed. Further sales for propagation purposes are not allowed without the written approval of the breeder. There is also a breeders' exemption (research exemption in the 1991 Act) that allows breeders to use protected varieties as sources of initial variation to create new varieties of plants (1978 Act),  or for other experimental purposes (1991 Act).  There is also a provision for compulsory licensing to assure public access to protected varieties if the national interest requires it and the breeder is unable to meet the demand.  There is tension over the relationship between patent rights and plant breeder's rights. There has been litigation in Australia, the United States, and Canada over the overlap between such rights.  Each of these cases was decided on the principle that patents and plant breeders' rights were overlapping and not mutually exclusive. Thus, the exemptions from infringement of plant breeders' rights, such as the saved seed exemption, do not create corresponding exemptions from infringement of the patents covering the same plants. Likewise, acts that infringe the plant breeders' rights, such as exportation of the variety, would not necessarily infringe a patent on the variety, which only allows the patent owner to prohibit making, using or selling the patented invention.

After 70 clean tests in a year, the NFL's Josh Gordon recently had a publicized failed test over their 15 ng limit despite saying he was just around friends smoking and he was clean. 15 ng is a very low limit, the Olympics revised their testing from 15 to 150 after a snow boarder claimed 2nd hand smoke after getting a medal. The NFL also revised their test levels this season. Airplane pilots have to be under 50 ng to fly.   The reason I give those examples is because on this lawyer forum it says anything over 15 is sent for further testing (the link is about a solider who claims to falsely test positive and a lawyers responses to his options so may want to text that to your friend). If this is true, your friend may want to play it safe and stay the hell away from his roommates for the next few days and drink plenty of water, or whatever people do to flush their system.

Test the urine when it is less diluted and test the first part of the stream. I'm no expert, but I have seen many a friend through similar ordeals and there is nothing like knowing what's what ahead of time. Good luck!"

After that, assuming no rabies and no history of aggression, many states will record the incident but let the dog go.  But if it ever happens again, the dog is on record as aggressive and will likely be killed."
myfriendwantstoknow,2rlqou,FedRafaFan,4,Wed Jan 7 16:02:38 2015 UTC,Well then someone had to tell someone in authority. They will likely do some investigation to determine if the animal is dangerous.

I don't know, but I assume you have to press charges or get animal control involved to have another person's dog put down for biting. If a dog bites its owner and the owner thinks it was just an accident I can't imagine it would be a big deal.   Don't know how accurate this site is but it sounds like a judge would have to declare the dog dangerous before it is killed."

While I was there, security came and asked me for more information about the cat.  I declined to give it and they let it go without any hassle and did not pursue it.  I had no reason to believe the cat was vicious or a danger to the average person, which is why I elected to keep the information private.  I told them that, and wasn't defensive or cagey about it.  Maybe different officers would react differently--or maybe a dog raises it to a different level of scrutiny."

Assuming what you told us is true, and the dog just accidentally but him too hard when they were playing, I don't see why they'd insist on putting the dog down.  There wasn't any malice, it was just a mistake.  A mistake both the pet and owner should learn from, but a mistake nonetheless."

If your poop is going to consist mainly of spicy stuff you're going to have a burning bunghole. That's why Indians invented naan breads or why Mexican food comes with a nachos or a tortilla. That way your poop has something more to it so it isn't spicy.  I completely made that up but am serious about making sure there is more to your poop than just spice. Eat something with it so that it isn't all spicy stuff coming out.
myfriendwantstoknow,2rktq5,CarpeKitty,7,Wed Jan 7 02:45:18 2015 UTC,"A lot of Indians have something curd or yoghurt based as part of the meal or right after it. Try a glass of lassi or a side of raita, it might help the burning."

The lien holder may on occasion require you to provide current proof of full coverage insurance.  Additionally, if you drop below full coverage for awhile then want to reinstate the full coverage insurance at a later date, your insurer may require you to go through a vehicle inspection to check for damage etc. before they agree to insure you.  It's also very common for lien company to only agree to underwrite a loan upon your agreement to keep full coverage insurance - in the worst case they can call the entire lone value due or repossess your vehicle for your failure to keep the insurance level.  Very risky."

If your friend is going to use nicotine, he should use either ecigs, lozenges, or gum. Cigarettes will give him cancer and emphysema, those are both horrible ways do die.  Pretty much all the other alternatives will also give him various cancers, etc. E-cigs have comparable health risks to caffeine, with a possibility of being a risk factor for stomach cancer.

There are people in that sub who can answer this much better than I can :-)  Edit: To somewhat answer your friend's question: there aren't enough studies to definitively prove one way or the other. Most of us simply believe that it's just healthier than regular tobacco cigarettes, especially since our health has become so much better after making the switch to vaping. My personal view is that there is absolutely no way that inhaling nicotine ""juice"" with food-grade flavoring could possibly be completely healthy for you, but I think that it is relatively harmless and it is absolutely better than tobacco cigarettes.

The negative health effects aren't fully known but you still have to deal with your brain basically rewired from the addiction. It's a nasty addiction too,  requiring near constant attention throughout the day... Unlike caffeine or other mild drugs. When I quit smoking, cold turkey, it took three days before I started feeling better (the time it takes for nicotine to get out of your body) and then my body started fixing the addiction I had put on it. I always thought I needed cigarettes to be less bitchy or irritable. Turns out the nicotine was the thing doing that. It causes SO much stress that you don't even realize. 10 minutes after smoking/inhaling/whatever you begin the withdrawals and that's what causes the distracted mind and edgy feelings that you don't really notice till you are free of nicotine completely.  If you are trying to quit, from someone who has done it all to try... Just get rid of the damn stuff as soon as possible and start the healing process. Nicotine is a powerful thing that completely tricks your brain, it's not worth it at all.  You'll feel SO much better after a few weeks.   If you want to try nicotine... Don't, please.

myfriendwantstoknow,2rfufd,user0621,5,Tue Jan 6 00:10:21 2015 UTC,Oh right. Tell your friend that a doctor will be able to give him the proper dosage as well.
myfriendwantstoknow,2rfufd,walruskingofsweden,7,Tue Jan 6 05:38:50 2015 UTC,I have been prescribed to a variety of amphetamines including Aderall for homework help and I find it incredibly useful. I wouldn't be able to tell you what dosage but I usually take enough so that I feel a little jittery for a few minutes and then after that I'm ultra focused and feel like lord of the scholars. One thing to know is that Aderall kills your appetite COMPLETELY. You will not eat nor will you feel a need to eat. It may also keep you up at night but you will eventually be able to fall asleep. It will also make you rather antisocial while it is in effect. Don't buy it illegally though. You very well may have ADD and it shouldn't be too hard to get a prescription.
myfriendwantstoknow,2rfufd,Nick6281,1 point,Tue Jan 6 02:37:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks! My friend doesn't really get ""zoned out"" while talking to people, however, he definitely gets distracted all the time when doing school. I have concluded the best course of action is to seek a prescription."
myfriendwantstoknow,2rfufd,Newtothisredditbiz,3,Tue Jan 6 05:24:34 2015 UTC,"1.) I would agree with /u/user0621 's advice to get a prescription of your own, as it's fairly easy to obtain one especially if you truly believe you have ADD/ADHD.   2.) The effects are definitely noticeable, it usually takes 30 minutes to an hour for mine to kick in. It is useful for staying focused and getting work done, but it's not a miracle drug. You still need to put effort into focusing on your work or it won't help at all. As an added sidenote, eat a decent meal or snack beforehand because one of the more common side effects is loss of appetite. Also, drink lots of water while you are on it because it tends to lead to dehydration.  3.) Dosage is dependent on how severe your inability to focus is as well as physical attributes (height, weight). Normally, people are started off at lower doses and increase as necessary. I started at 10 mg pills and currently, about a year later, I'm using 20 mg pills and feeling good effects.   You should know that initially (first 2 weeks or so) you will feel increased effects because you aren't used to it. However don't go chasing the ""honeymoon high"" by taking higher doses than prescribed because you are wrecking your current tolerance of it and also run a chance of becoming addicted. Adderall addiction is a real thing, just like any other amphetamines. Be safe and think about what you're doing and you shouldn't have a problem!  If you have any other questions OP don't hesitate to ask, either on here or PM me."
myfriendwantstoknow,2rfufd,yitzaklr,1 point,Tue Jan 6 03:24:16 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! I do have a couple questions: How does my friend know that he doesn't just have a willpower problem and does indeed have ADD? He definitely gets distracted all the time whenever he is in a lecture or is trying to do homework, however, that's really the extent of it. Other than that the worst symptom would be fucking up small details on assignments etc. Obviously the point of a prescription is that a trained professional gave the diagnosis but maybe some anecdotes might help me understand the disorder a bit better."
myfriendwantstoknow,2rfufd,Newtothisredditbiz,2,Tue Jan 6 05:34:04 2015 UTC,"1) It's not too hard to get a prescription in many places. Your friend can Look up the symptoms of ADHD/ADD and tell the doctor he/she has them. It's good to have childhood anecdotes like saying he was always caught daydreaming in class, etc. It's not like faking something like schizophrenia. Just emphasize the moments in your life when you had trouble focussing.   2) One thing about ADD drugs is they don't necessarily prevent procrastination, but in fact can make you too focussed on whatever you're doing to procrastinate. For example, let's say you play a few video games while you wait for the Ritalin to kick in. Next thing you know, you've got a 25 kill streak going but you've wasted four hours. You still need to direct where that focus is going to be. That said, if you take it half an hour before a planned study session, it should indeed help you focus on your studies.  3) The prescribed doses vary from person to person, as people react differently. You can try taking parts of a pill to start, and test your reaction. The doses people take for prescribed use tend to be fairly low compared to the crazy amounts people take recreationally to get high."

myfriendwantstoknow,2rc91g,wi1d3,2,Mon Jan 5 04:36:21 2015 UTC,"I've seen cases of special laser light being employed to pull fingerprints off objects that have been buried underground for months or longer. Specifically it is because the oils or salts in your skin can react with different materials like plastics and metals ""etching"" a print in almost permanently. In fact, the longer a print has sat, the harder it will be to remove from some materials. Technology now is amazing. I've seen cases where prints were taken off a human body even to prove strangulation.  So... if your friend is concerned about leaving prints on something, then your friend might be seriously in trouble. The good news is not every print left at every crime scene is automatically connected to whoever left it. Unless it was a serious crime, most detective work involves finding an existing match to prints left only on the immediate, involved objects, and it can be almost impossible to try to find relevant matches on some kinds of objects, EG: a television remote control at a house where there have been parties hosted.  Edit: If your friend did something bad, and left prints, it might be far wiser to hire a lawyer and confess involvement. This approach can help get reduced punishments than if your friend tried to hide what happened."
myfriendwantstoknow,2rc91g,BigAngryDinosaur,1 point,Mon Jan 5 08:41:06 2015 UTC,No my friend is just curious because he was watching some crime scene documentary and print were obviously brought up but he was wondering how valid they could be because of the age of them.

I think being a late bloomer, so to speak, helps you appreciate it much more. Maybe back then (late 70s-early 80s) there was less social pressure, but all my friends knew. They didn't make fun of me, they made it their mission to get me laid. Nevertheless, they failed. I finally managed it on my own.

This is because the area is infected and dirty and you are ckeaning it out. It is like when you skin your knee and change the bandage and clean the wound. At first it bleeds a bit and is sore, but eventually, if you keep it clean it heals. Bleeding that lasts more than a couple of weeks should be checked by a dentist. It likely means you are overdue for a clean. See my basic hygiene post for how to brush and floss safely and effectively. Great resolution! Good luck to your... Uh friend!"

myfriendwantstoknow,2r7e8t,hellowiththepudding,3,Sun Jan 4 00:32:39 2015 UTC,"You use the same browser, and nearly everything works as it should. I will note that unfortunately Hulu has banned the IPs of the PIA servers, so if you want to watch that you have to hop off. I don't use netflix (again, we're talking about anonymous internet you can torrent through), but facebook, reddit, etc all work as expected. I can even still play games (with 20-30 additional ms of ping).  PIA lets you forward a port also (randomly generated), so you can point your favorite download software to that location.  Your friend should check out their site (just google private internet access). They sell it by the month, or greatly discounted for the year. If your friend is unsure, they can buy one month, then decide if they like the service.  Something else that is nice for the ultra paranoid is the ability to pay with giftcards anonymously, however I seriously doubt they have a data retention policy that would lead to anything meaningful in a raid. At most a customer list, but no history associated with each account.  If your friend has trouble setting it up feel free to message me."
myfriendwantstoknow,2r7e8t,cosmicsans,3,Sun Jan 4 00:38:25 2015 UTC,"Also worthy to note is that they offer a SOCKS5 proxy, so you can just set up your torrent client to run behind the VPN and still browse everything else normally."

My best recommendation is to find the movie's website and social media pages online and keep on the lookout for announcements of screenings and online availability. Following the directors and actors can provide good information and they're often happy to answer questions or respond to interest in their films.  Sometimes the movies can be found on vimeo or youtube, or can be rented or streamed from iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, We Are Colony, Fandor and the like.

I mean, it takes 2 days for Paypal to verify the account is real, but after that I would think they'd be able to go shopping.  I'm in no way suggesting that this is smart and I'm sure there are a million ways to get caught doing this, but it would be a huge pain in the ass.  You're sure to have some of your money tied up in limbo while the bank proves fraud.  I would highly suggest that they close the two accounts immediately.

To show how crazy: pure dark chocolate is the only option here.  We need foods that are incredibly calorie dense.  Dark chocolate has some nutrition and a blend of fats and sugar that keeps it calorie dense without giving you the runs like pure lard would.  Plus it doesn't melt in spring and won't go rancid.  Assuming ~2 years in Europe and that he will be eating only 1 meal a day from rations (buying the rest locally), on an 1800 calorie starvation diet (for a backpacker) he would still need to depart with 161lbs dark chocolate, which maybe he could push around in a wheelbarrow/cart that he ditches after a year or so.  This is vs 250lbs dry rice or jerky.  No freeze-dried foods will go over 85cal/oz including packaging, which equals 322lbs in the cart.  Have you ever played Oregon Trail?  You have to hunt along the way.  Dark chocolate is about 50% more calorie dense than dried foods and doesnt require cooking.

myfriendwantstoknow,2r2b5x,Mremerkin,3,Fri Jan 2 03:50:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but if you read the serving size, it's only 350 calories. For a grown man that's going to be about 4-5 per day .. so say 12 days worth."
myfriendwantstoknow,2r2b5x,Nowhere_Man_Forever,3,Fri Jan 2 04:26:02 2015 UTC,"Which is why these ""emergency food"" companies are such a rip off. They have to mis-represent how long that 1 month supply would last. For 1 man, 10-12 days.   And notice too, that all the food is basically pasta. No protein except vegetable protein, hardly any fat. It's really not suitable for someone engaged in daily strenuous exercise (ie, backpacking)   MRE's would be much better."
myfriendwantstoknow,2r2b5x,WaZ606,6,Fri Jan 2 04:29:02 2015 UTC,"Dude, if you eat less that 350 calories a day you have a serious eating disorder.  See a doctor immediately. Here's a snipping from the Jewish digital library describing Holocaust conditions:    ""In practice, Auschwitz prisoners with less physically demanding labor assignments received approximately 1,300 calories per day, while those engaged in hard labor received approximately 1,700. After several weeks on such starvation rations in the camp, most prisoners began to experience organic deterioration that led to the so-called ""Muzulman"" state, extreme physical exhaustion that ended in death."""

myfriendwantstoknow,2r2b5x,CalmSpider,4,Fri Jan 2 16:36:54 2015 UTC,"It doesn't work that way.  If OP's friend were Andre the motherfucking Giant, he'd need to eat even more than an ordinary person.  In fact, as a general rule of thumb, the bigger an animal is, the less calorie efficient it is, so Andre the Giant would last even less time on the food he could carry than an ordinary person would.  No way in hell is anyone carrying a two year supply of their own food on their back."

myfriendwantstoknow,2r2b5x,Mremerkin,2,Fri Jan 2 12:03:41 2015 UTC,"This thread is already full of great advice on specific foods and packaging methods, so I'm going to talk about something I don't see mentioned yet: rotation.  I'm assuming he's not going to hide out and avoid cities, and so he is shooting to have a bundle of emergency food in case he gets stuck somewhere. His best bet is to shoot for a shorter 1-year minimum shelf life and then eat the food gradually, replacing what he eats as he eats it. Keeping track of how long he's had each packet/item will allow him to eat the oldest foods first. In this way, he can have a supply of fresh emergency food at all times without worrying about things going bad, even if he has the supply for ten times the shelf life of the foods.   Additionally, he will already be used to eating the foods in the emergency supply. If he has a crisis where he has to live off those supplies for a while, he will reduce the impact that sudden dietary changes will have on what will already be a very stressful situation. In short, if you're lost in the woods, the last thing you need is to get the shits from eating food your body is unfamiliar with."

A cup of milk has 13 grams of lactose while a cup of vanilla ice cream has less than 5 grams. There is a huge difference in the amount and concentration of the lactose that could make your friend react to milk, but not ice cream.  Source"
myfriendwantstoknow,2qvn32,Purplegill10,3,Wed Dec 31 02:40:15 2014 UTC,"Thanks, that really cleared things up!"
myfriendwantstoknow,2qvn32,thewrongdoor,5,Wed Dec 31 04:45:03 2014 UTC,"Also if he eats cheese a lot, there's a reason for it. Cheese has the lowest lactose of any dairy product. Some brands even advertise that they have no lactose at all."
myfriendwantstoknow,2qvn32,youre_a_baboon,6,Wed Dec 31 17:11:11 2014 UTC,"I am lactose intolerant and ice cream is usually fine for me, but a glass of milk will cause me to have to use the restroom very quickly. Being lactose intolerant, I can handle small amounts of lactose, just not a ton of it :)"
myfriendwantstoknow,2qvn32,red3biggs,2,Wed Dec 31 06:01:51 2014 UTC,"Yes, I can't drink milk but ice cream and cheese are fine.  I read somewhere, sorry I don't know where, that it's a particular kind of intolerance. Instead of being so bad it's blanketed across all dairy, cheese and ice cream are processed in a way I can handle. Or something like that. Sorry that's the best I can at the moment. But I'm pretty happy I can eat ice cream though."
myfriendwantstoknow,2qvn32,donpirracas1,2,Wed Dec 31 08:42:13 2014 UTC,"Yep it's possible as people are sensitive to different amounts and levels of processing. For instance, I can have some yogurts (probiotics especially) but not others, depending on how they were processed.   Best thing I've discovered: lactaid pills. If taken before/with my dairy I am able to digest as normal.   Lactose intolerance is quite common, but is sometimes actually IBS misdiagnosed."
myfriendwantstoknow,2qvn32,Bamboolicker,2,Wed Dec 31 23:21:28 2014 UTC,"I've developed worse reactions to milk as I have gotten older, and have to make sure I know what kinds a cheese I'm eating. (cheddar and blue cheese are off my list)   My brother has always been able to drink milk, but never been able to eat almost any kind of cheese."
myfriendwantstoknow,2qvn32,n1nj4_v5_p1r4t3,1 point,Wed Dec 31 23:55:42 2014 UTC,"Maybe it's due to the fact that a big part of modern ice cream are not 100% dairy or doesn't contain any milk at all, mostly in lower cost ice cream. They use vegetable fats instead. I don't know how are the rules in your country, but as far as I know, in Europe it can be made without milk derivates and still be sold as ice cream. Tell your friend to check the ingredients next time."
myfriendwantstoknow,2qvn32,TSED,1 point,Mon Jan 5 22:46:48 2015 UTC,Lactose intolerance works on a scale and not directly yes or no. People have the capability to produce the enzyme required to break down milk sugar but some people are able to produce more of the enzyme or less. A person that produces less enzyme to break down milk sugar will be more lactose intolerant and the other way around. Most people are not fully allergic or lactose intolerant. With dairy products it is useful to understand where you stand with your body. Can you eat a lot of milk or dairy products or not? A cup of ice-cream should not be a problem even for lower tolerance but I wouldn't follow that up with a cream based soup.
myfriendwantstoknow,2qvn32,n1nj4_v5_p1r4t3,-7,Tue Jan 6 18:12:07 2015 UTC,Stop getting cheap milk. Get the organic stuff. The cheap stuff is full of chemicals humans donlt need or want near anyone in their family.  Goat milk is better for you too if your lactose intolerant.
myfriendwantstoknow,2qvn32,TSED,4,Wed Dec 31 12:46:15 2014 UTC,"1) You realise that not all countries in the world have subsidized milk that encourages manipulation of production like the USA or various European nations, right?  2) Not everyone can afford the fancy pricey stuff.  3) Lactose intolerance + ""just get organic milk"" = lol.  That kind of logic is why organic / vegan / etc. food has such a bad reputation in the first place."
myfriendwantstoknow,2qvn32,Nowhere_Man_Forever,-5,Wed Dec 31 15:53:20 2014 UTC,"3.) They might not be lactose intolerant, just sensitive to the chemicals in lower grade food.   2.) Budgeting is important for those that cannot afford everything they want. Food should come before leisure activities.   1.) Which as as end result produces a substance sold as milk but is actually a small milk base mixed with a bunch of chemicals, so much so that it should not even be called milk. So subsidizing production creates a 'lets build it cheap for the cheapest dollar (walmart)' attitude. A low price might be attractive, but the real costs of going that route are hidden, and will tax you beyond belief."

If the ""cheating"" wasn't a result of a sexual assault -- she had every opportunity to say no."
myfriendwantstoknow,2qtdo2,Mremerkin,60,Tue Dec 30 14:28:31 2014 UTC,"I never understood this type of reaction to cheating.  Get pissed at the girlfriend, not the guy.  Also, cut ties and move on, don't dwell on it. I know, easier said than done, but as someone that's been cheated on, know that her shortcomings are to blame, not your own.    Also, don't do anything you'll regret later.  It's not worth ruining your future over a girl that doesn't even respect you enough to break up properly.  The best revenge is living your life to the fullest."
myfriendwantstoknow,2qtdo2,jts5009,14,Tue Dec 30 15:36:17 2014 UTC,"To be honest with you I never did either, until it happened. I'm really mad at her. Mostly I'm sad though, that the person I was closest to betrayed me and manipulated me like this.   I guess I feel like if he doesn't receive some sort of retribution then he got away with it. Neither of them deserves to be happy right now, I just want to be the thing making him unhappy, or make sure that something will, so he doesn't feel like he ""got away with it."" Obviously this is coming from a place of pure pain and sadness, and part of me knows I'll regret it, I just can't move past it right now.   He has a girlfriend too, by the way."
myfriendwantstoknow,2qtdo2,Wayne_Skylar,27,Tue Dec 30 15:44:43 2014 UTC,"Basically you want to inflict pain on these two for hurting you.   Think about that for a second. Ever know someone who is just a complete dick to somebody? It's usually the same thing going on. They are unhappy on the inside and they just want the entire world to feel their pain. It's a pretty awful way to live and you should try to avoid making others feel pain because of how you feel.   The best case scenario (for yourself) is that you kick the guy's ass without getting in trouble with the law. You're going to take a situation that is already bad and make it worse. In a year or two's time you're going to feel like complete shit for having done it.   That's the best case scenario. You might get your ass kicked. Then you're really going to feel like shit. Or he might press charges. Then you'll be in the same boat you're in now along with legal problems. Maybe he won't press charges but wants revenge? Then you have to deal with that.  People do fucked up shit to each other, man. The best thing you can do is to let it go. Otherwise you just make it worse."

myfriendwantstoknow,2qtdo2,Fermit,12,Tue Dec 30 17:58:30 2014 UTC,"Here's something to remember about the guy, if it wasn't him, it would have been someone else.   In a sense, he did you a sold by getting there before someone else did, saving you some time.   Also as far as he is concerned this is not personal against you whatsoever, (obviously I don't know the details of the situation, so I'm interjecting my own experience in the matter but, the other guy in my case was told I was no longer in the picture) so you shouldn't have anything personal against him.  Of course with that said, I completely understand how you are feeling, I've been there, and I know it sucks. My suggestion is to cut your losses, keep your dignity, and just cut all communication.   (Giving no response can sometimes be the best revenge of all when you find out years later it has been eating her up inside while you had completely forgotten she existed.)"
myfriendwantstoknow,2qtdo2,Describe,6,Tue Dec 30 19:39:59 2014 UTC,"I'd still say telling his girlfriend about it should be on the table. Not because of revenge, but because he cheated on her. She shouldn't be in the dark on this any longer than she needs to be."

It's certainly not always true, of course. This person could end up being a faithful partner for your friend for eternity.

myfriendwantstoknow,2qkiw5,elreydelasur,1 point,Sun Dec 28 05:22:10 2014 UTC,I mean what if the person is just looking for a more open relationship but assumes cheating is the only way to get it.
myfriendwantstoknow,2qkiw5,Purplegill10,3,Mon Dec 29 15:47:42 2014 UTC,then they need to be honest about their wants and needs and if thats not what OP's friend is looking for then it might be time to move on
myfriendwantstoknow,2qkiw5,elreydelasur,1 point,Mon Dec 29 20:08:33 2014 UTC,I'm saying that it's entirely possible that they don't know about it. Just like how most people don't know/understand polyamory but it can make relationships a lot better/stronger.
myfriendwantstoknow,2qkiw5,Purplegill10,18,Mon Dec 29 20:59:32 2014 UTC,"Yes, it can, and no, it isn't true. ""Once X, always X"" is categorically wrong when applied to any human behaviour, because all humans are capable of complexity and change. Sure, many people who cheat on relationships will go on to cheat on subsequent relationships, but some won't, just like many people who are convicted of cringes will commit future crimes, but some won't.  Also, if you want a specific example: I cheated on one of my partners, on two ocassions, eventually splitting up with her to get together with the person I cheated on her with. My new partner and I enjoyed a successful relationship of seven to eight years before going or separate ways, and my current partner and I have been together a similar amount of time, so far, and I've never cheated since. For me, at least, that two-time thing was more than enough, and I can't imagine ever betraying a lover like that again.   There are ""Once a cheater..."" folks, I'm sure, who would disbelieve that, but that's just their closed-mindedness. I'm done with cheating."
myfriendwantstoknow,2qkiw5,avapoet,5,Sun Dec 28 00:49:32 2014 UTC,Hopefully that can be the case here. It sounds like the relationship is pretty dead. My friend wishes this person would just end it though.
myfriendwantstoknow,2qkiw5,pandrice,12,Sun Dec 28 01:58:25 2014 UTC,"Not being willing to end the previous relationship (especially if your friend has expressed a desire for them to do so) is kind of a red flag. As everyone else is saying, ""once a cheater, always a cheater"" isn't always true, but if they can't commit to your friend, they may not be a great choice as a partner."
myfriendwantstoknow,2qkiw5,Eternally65,6,Sun Dec 28 03:52:31 2014 UTC,"Okay yeah seriously if this person cannot end their current ""official"" relationship, your friend should really just move on."
myfriendwantstoknow,2qkiw5,spencermurray,6,Sun Dec 28 06:46:46 2014 UTC,"It's complicated. On the one hand, if someone has made an explicit committment (and I am choosing my words very carefully) and then breaks that committment, one of two things can be true: the person was lying, or, the person's word means nothing to them. Both of these are big Red Flags.  On the other hand, many people define a relationship in different ways. I might, for example, think that anyone I am in a sexual relationship with will be as exclusive with me as I am with them. In other words, I break up with the first lover before I pursue the second. However, many people don't feel this way. If nothing was explicitly agreed to by both parties, they reason there is no ""contract"" restricting them from experimenting with someone else. I don't agree with this, but that is me.  So your friend should be concerned about what level of committment the current lover made, and what level of committment they have made with your friend.  As a matter of personal preference, I find life is simpler if one never becomes the ""other person"". Ever."
myfriendwantstoknow,2qkiw5,chonnes,7,Sun Dec 28 01:18:53 2014 UTC,"Always is a strong word. That being said, the way to bet is that your friend isn't some magical being who cured this other person of their self-centered and dishonest attitude towards life. Don't get attached."
myfriendwantstoknow,2qkiw5,OrbOfConfusion,10,Sun Dec 28 01:27:00 2014 UTC,"Your friend wasn't ""worth it"" to tell in the beginning.

myfriendwantstoknow,2qkiw5,laikamonkey,3,Sun Dec 28 02:41:22 2014 UTC,"Sometimes it's true. For someone to stop cheating, they need to truly change and reach a place where they don't and never will feel the need to cheat, or they learn to respect the relationships of others enough to never cheat. Sometimes this is possible, but a lot of times the person simply doesn't change, and without that change, there's always the possibility that they'll cheat again. So you have to evaluate honestly and objectively whether that change has taken place, and it can be difficult."
myfriendwantstoknow,2qkiw5,BigAngryDinosaur,3,Sun Dec 28 01:37:19 2014 UTC,"Someone used to say, if you are in doubt about a relationship because you fancy another, then leave the current and get that another, because that's the person who you want to be with.

Go read r/adultery. For some people, this is a lifestyle choice, not a ""mistake"" or something they did because they couldn't resist you. They are simply selfish and want what they want with very little concern for anyone else involved.  Your friend can do better than this shithead. He/she is worth more. Help your friend hit the gym, get back into an old hobby, pick up a new interest, or do whatever else will make them feel good and help them realize that they are too fucking awesome to be a secret or a second option.  I feel strongly about this because I'm in a relationship that started this way. He left her about a month after he met me, but I was far from the only affair partner. He had been cheating on Suzy Homemaker since day one, basically. The idea of him cheating on me too will NEVER leave my mind. I will never feel like it is a ""real"" relationship, and I have never felt like he actually loved me. I've found circumstantial evidence that suggests he already has cheated, though when I confronted him, he of course swore that he didn't.  If your friend is a moron like me who cannot be helped, make sure that he/she at least mitigates personal risk. Don't spend a bunch of money on this person, don't change your life for them, don't share property/a bank account with them, don't do anything that puts your future at risk.  Seriously, your friend doesn't want to be me. There are plenty of single people out there to pursue."

myfriendwantstoknow,2qkiw5,lessthanjake,2,Sun Dec 28 06:39:45 2014 UTC,"Everyone here has made very valid points.  But what worries me is that another question might be more valid:  Is it worth it?   Sexually transmitted diseases are real, statistically likely, and are at best temporarily uncomfortable and at worst can change your entire life. If your friend has no say in WHO s/he cheats with, does your friend really have any say in HOW s/he does it? And where that leaves your friend, in terms of staying safe and healthy? There can be a non-trivial amount of emotional pain involved for your friend if they choose to persist.  I don't know how ""tough"" or ""apathetic"" this friend is, but on my part, if I found out my SO was cheating on me, I'd feel ...inadequate. And unappreciated. Nobody needs that. Relationships should be about building each other up, not tearing each other down. And on that note of relationships... Any relationship (be it between romantic partners, parent and child, or even waiter and spaghetti enthusiast) HAS to begin with trust.  Without trust, you cannot confidently place any value in the interactions that you have with this other person.   I'm really sorry if this comes off as patronizing in any way. I just feel these points should be taken into consideration, because at the end of the day, your friend can't ""prove s/he isn't cheating."" So they have to take a step back and consider whether the risk is worth it."

There are also possible contraindications with some of the medications with seemingly innocuous things like grapefruit, NSAIDs, etc so it is worthwhile to have legit 1-1 guidance with a prescriber.  That, and there's a concrete risk with some individuals experiencing an increase in suicidal/self harm thoughts (even if there weren't any there originally) which really gives need to have a professional to monitor and adjust if needed.  If office fees are an issue, there's options for that. If underage and don't want parents to know, there's options for that too.  Non-medication routes like exercise, hydration, proper nutrition, and over the counter options such as SAMe or St. John's wort can also be explored.  I would encourage your friend to consider going to a professional - and it can even be a ""trial-basis"" with them as well, there's a lot of trial and error in sorting out the best pick for any one person when it comes to psychotropic meds, so it's good to have someone experienced an knowledgable on hand for that process, and they're usually very open to testing things to see what works."

I get no joy from anything, my entire emotional range runs from sad to frustrated, I'm constantly tired, I can't be bothered to do anything, even the things that should make me happy, it's affecting both my personal and professional life, I waste my days doing stupid shit on the internet instead of living... etc. Source: said those things because they were true, got meds. If your friend really is depressed, telling the truth will be enough. If not, saying those things like mean it will still work.  I hated that I actually had to see a doctor and admit my brain is fucked and that I can't fix myself, but it's the first step.  Relying on an illegal supply is a terrible idea for a number of reasons... first off, I don't think anyone bothers to sell these, since they're easy to obtain and don't get you high. Second, you need a consistent dose for weeks before they do anything, and real improvement can take months. Third, if your sketchy illegal supply runs out, you're in trouble, because suddenly discontinuing these drugs ranges from unpleasant to harmful."

In humans, it is a medicinal herb with antidepressant, antibacterial, antioxidant, neuroprotective, and potent anti-inflammatory properties as well as potential anti-cancer and antiviral properties.   Clinical evidence supports the use of St John's wort preparations as a treatment for depression and certain other conditions.   However, it is toxic to certain species of livestock when ingested and is also considered a weed when growing wild. Hypericum perforatum is indigenous to Europe but has spread worldwide as an invasive species, including to temperate and subtropical regions of Turkey, Ukraine, Russia, the Middle East, India, and China.

There are some STD's (notably herpes and HPV) which spread just by skin to skin contact. There are others that are able to be passed from genital-oral contact (gonorrhea of the throat is gross).  All of that said, this is not a replacement for medical advice, but I've gotten pimples on my labia, I've also had skin irritation just from the friction that results from sex. My personal rule is to wait 3 days. If it gets worse in that time I head to urgent care; if it doesn't get better at the end of three days, I go to the doctor; if it gets better, I generally figure it's no big deal.

One can also spread a disease on one's own body, for instance, shaving one's crotch, then the face can spread a genital infection to the face.

With HIV (people tend to call it AIDS although that's inaccurate) High protection through condom and uncommon in the developed world, Hepatitis, also uncommon most people get vaccinated and condoms protect quite well. Syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia (all curable except the new anti-biotic resistant strain of gonorrhea is probably hard to treat)  Your friend can get the HPV vaccine, although that only protects him from 3 strains, that sometimes don't show symptoms and are the ones which cause cancer in women. All the others he can still catch. (although most are harmless Read shepard's comment)  In summery, there isn't a lot to worry about, be cautious but not over paranoid, don't take the condom off, although it feels a lot better, without the proper birth control there is a risk of pregnancy and possible contraction of STD's outweighs the benefits.

You cannot sign a piece of paper absolving anyone of blame to any deliberate physical harm placed on you. Yes, you can sign waivers acknowledging that you are engaging in a dangerous activity, but only where there is no deliberate intent of doing direct physical harm to you.  A death in a duel would be treated as either manslaughter or murder depending on the prosecution of the case. Signing the papers would give evidence that physical harm was intended and you cannot absolve the guilty party of any fault in doing so. Wounding (but not killing) would be charged as attempted murder. Non-life threatening injuries could be plea bargained down to battery.   ... duels are not illegal. The result of a duel is."

myfriendwantstoknow,2qbgfi,cubiclejockey,9,Thu Dec 25 16:52:48 2014 UTC,"It depends on several principles, which sometimes overlap and cause confusion (with the result for example that fist fights on cruise ships are a nightmare for the authorities).  The first principle is that the country in which the relevant ship/aircraft is registered has jurisdiction. If that country can't or won't take action though, then international law recognises the right of the country of a person involved (the victim generally) to take jusrisdiction. However, there are some crimes where any country can accept jurisdiction to prosecute: piracy, slave trading or narcotics smuggling for example are subject to specific international laws.   You may also find, especially if you're a passenger on a ship, that your ticket requires you to accept that the laws of a particular country will apply in the event of any crime or incident during the voyage and an agrement like that (in the small print on the back of the booking) is generally binding."

myfriendwantstoknow,2qbgfi,Hipster_Garabe,5,Thu Dec 25 16:54:09 2014 UTC,"Basically, think of it this way (not specific to dueling). Contracts (any legal contracts) cannot supersede the law. Murder is against the law, so no form of legal contact can permit it (and non-legally binding contacts don't mean shit when the law is concerned).   For the same reason, hit men are illegal. You cannot have a contract to kill somebody, even if the contact was from the person that will be killed, because no matter what, killing is against the law.  (Fun fact on that: You can't even kill yourself legally. Suicide is illegal in most(?) of the U.S. It seems silly when you first hear it, but it makes sense. It's what allows police offers to enter a building (private property) to prevent a suicide without a warrant. Usually, they'd need a warrant to enter private property, but with the no suicide law, if somebody is attempting suicide, they are committing a crime and officers obligations are to stop crimes in progress. They don't need a warrant to stop a crime in progress."

myfriendwantstoknow,2pua0x,lordofthejelly,6,Sat Dec 20 00:48:31 2014 UTC,"Human penis size:  NSFW ?      The most accurate measurement of the human penis comes from several measurements at different times since there is natural minor variability in size due to arousal level, time of day, room temperature, frequency of sexual activity, and reliability of measurement. When compared to other primates, including large primates such as the gorilla, the human penis is largest, both in absolute terms and relative to the rest of the body.  Measurements vary, with studies that rely on self-measurement reporting a significantly higher average than those with staff measuring. However, the mean of an erect human penis is approximately 12.9–15.0 cm (5.1–5.9 in) in length. Flaccid penis length is a poor estimate of erect length.  Most of human penis growth happens between infancy and the age of five, and between about one year after the onset of puberty and, at latest, approximately 17 years of age.

It will be dirty, cold and lonely.   Are your friend under 18, he should talk to his parents, and definitely don't just run away.

myfriendwantstoknow,2pjksj,TurnPunchKick,6,Thu Dec 18 03:01:03 2014 UTC,"Bisexual guy here.  here are the pointers from someone who's given head to men and recieved head from women.  Stimulation begins from the soft tissue of your mouth interacting with the thickness of his shaft and tip. You won't necessarily enjoy it when a guy pushes your head down when you give it, so politely ask him to let you do your thing.  when giving head, give minimal contact with the teeth and anywhere along the penis, unless the guys advises. You should make suction like a suction tube and have no air when the penis is inside your mouth. Licking is very pleasurable with the guy when he's inside.  You'll notice a tube that's underneath the base of his shaft. That's the urethra. If you take your hand and follow the urethra that passes underneath his balls, right behind the ball sack but before the anus, is a sweet spot if you rub it gently side to side. it's part of his urethra.   Maintain a consistent pace and play with the tip a lot. if he has foreskin it may look ugly but it's a very fun apparatus when you're sucking the foreskin back and forth off the tip.  remember to keep the teeth away by having your jaw wider than the shaft.  you can switch around a bit, suck from the side of your lips or deep into your throat like a pole. Masturbating him is recommended after its wet enough. when masturbating, avoid jerking from the tip all the way to the base because it doesn't stimulate very well like if it's just from the tip to the middle of the shaft.  Splitting salviva on top is pleasurable but too much liquid is undesirable. If it's wet enough you should be able to make a lot of slurping noises. remember to keep stimulating the back of his urethra.  He should be in ecstacy after some time and he'll start squirting some grey ish goo from the tip. Up to you where you want it to go but be advised that cum generally isn't very tasty except certain guys can have delicious cum.  munch on the balls. make it wet for him. feel his testicles with the tip of your tongue. suck a ball or two inside your mouth.  hope this helps"

Here's my take:   Bar: No. The chances of finding a guy who will say, ""Sure, let's do that again"" are low if the first time is not good. He'll remember that he got lucky at the bar and just go back there looking for another hook-up. Craigslist: No. People will think it is a fake. Tinder: Of the ideas you listed, this is probably the best bet. If she posts something like, ""Need BJ practice partner. I'm serious. I want to improve my oral skills and need a patient man to give me the freedom to test, try and learn. Be forewarned. The first time may be awful, but you will be required to come again,"" she will get FLOODED with replies. She'll need to weed through them to find the one guy who actually will be supportive.

myfriendwantstoknow,2pgfbj,doooom,1 point,Tue Dec 16 15:49:04 2014 UTC,"This is the key right here, and as a person with depression it can be hard to see clearly and to have faith in your feelings.  Not all behaviors are objectively good or bad. What is okay to one person may not be for another, and that's okay.  The only thing that matters is how this person's actions make YOU feel. If she is drawing out these apologies to the point that they hurt you or make you miserable, that's not okay. If she doesn't want to change this behavior it's okay (and probably best) for you to leave.  A relationship is only a good thing if both people's behaviors, habits and personalities are compatible and lead to both people being happier. If this isn't the case, both people in the relationship would often be better off with more compatible partners."

Tell her about the depression (even if you don't want to,  it's good to get it off your chest), tell her about how you have to beg for forgiveness and how that makes you feel and is effecting your relationship. If she is mature she may see where you are coming from and try to be better. Or you may have to look inside and see if she is more harmful than good.

Every relationship ends -- either through a dumping or someone dying; none of them are permanent.  If it stops being fun at any point, there's no shame or guilt in ending it (as it inevitably would have ended eventually anyway) and letting both partners get on with trying to find their next one.  For the most part, your friend shouldn't wonder if relationships are abusive -- if there's any question in his head that it might be, it is at the very least unenjoyable.  So it's time to go find the next one.  If there's any doubt, basically, there's no doubt."

You do not need a title to register the car. If he signed any paper work for buying the vehicle, he would submit that to the DMV with no worries, get current registration. Having a current registration and current sticker on the license plate means that your registration is squared away only. Did he finance the car? A title will NOT be issued until the car is paid off/paid for in full. Otherwise, the DMV keeps the title on file stating that he is the owner but the finance company is the lien holder. Once the car is paid for, a title is issued, 'free and clear' meaning there is no more lien holder. I don't understand what you mean by ""keeping up with those"", the registration fee is an annual fee. His drivers license has nothing to do with owning the car though."

If you can, print off any emails from the buyer along with screen grabs of your text convo.  Keep a copy for yourself and bring one for the police when you go to the station.  It's probably worth making a copy of the check and envelope for your own records before taking them in, as well.  (On the off chance something gets misfiled, it's nice to have a back-up.)"

Your dad's probably invested with one of these scammy groups before and now his info gets sold around. They'll also refuse to say what they're truly calling about until they think they're talking to their target.

I'm not sure if you can answer this for me or not but, given your former job, what would you say is the best way to pay off a debt if the debt collection agency contacting me is a super shady business with a ton of reports online of people getting ripped off (processed payments they claim they never received, random fee charges that cost almost as much as the payment itself, etc.) by them?  I accumulated around $5000 or so in debt during my college years due to my parents telling me they were paying my medical bills but not actually doing so. I want to start paying it all off but don't want to end up in a situation where I'm having to pay twice what I actually owe due to scammy business practices on behalf of the collection agency. I'd like to pay it off but would rather go through a more legitimate organization with a better reputation, however the agency keeps telling me it has to go through them.  Any advice on how I can get the debt moved to different agency or, if that's not possible, how I can pay it off with the least chance of being ripped off like so many others?"
myfriendwantstoknow,2p13pw,commandar,5,Fri Dec 12 10:40:11 2014 UTC,Get everything in writing. Do not ever agree to anything verbally. Always request any payment agreements in writing before accepting.
myfriendwantstoknow,2p13pw,ScowlingOwl,3,Fri Dec 12 13:48:45 2014 UTC,"I'd get calls like this pretty often, and most of the time it actually WAS a scammy business that would reference my company in their letters. Contact directly the billing department of whatever hospital/doctor's office you owe. Hospitals tend to do their billing internally, so it's unlikely that they've sold your debt to an outside firm. They need to know if fraudsters are dropping their name. Also, look them up on the Better Business Bureau. If they're sketchy, someone has probably called them out there. Best of luck!"
myfriendwantstoknow,2p13pw,gilbertsmith,2,Fri Dec 12 16:12:02 2014 UTC,"Don't.  A friend of mine had some debt from a laptop he bought in like 1999. He lost his job shortly after and they started hassling him about the credit card (I think it was some Best Buy card or something) a few months after that.  He ignored it since he was broke, had moved back in with his parents, and had no way to pay it even if he wanted to. After a few months, they left him alone.  Fast forward like 6 years, he's working again but he's totally forgotten about this debt. Juuuuuuust before the 7 year mark, he starts getting tons of calls and letters from a collection agency. It was a different one than before though, because apparently they'd sold his debt off to another agency.  He ignored them because it seemed shady as fuck and not affiliated at all with Best Buy. A few months later he gets more letters for the same debt from another, different agency.  This time he decides to just pay it so they leave him alone. So he pays it. They made some deal with him to pay off like $500 and be done with it, versus the $1500 or so it was originally at.  Alls quiet for a while, then yet another agency comes at him. It seems the one he paid had sold the other 1k of his debt off to yet another collection agency or something. He read up on it and apparently if you make any payments, agree to pay, or do anything regarding a debt like that, it resets this 7 year ""clock"". If he had ignored the one he paid it would have been over 7 years and they wouldn't have been able to touch him, but since he responded to them and paid them, now he has to put up with this bullshit for another 7 years.  He's obviously not going to pay the latest ones since he got burned by the last one after they made him a deal and said it would be totally wiped off his credit history, then sold it anyways.  What pissed him off the most is these bottom-feeders aren't even the people who he had the debt with. Best Buy (or whoever does their store cards) had written the debt off years ago. Whatever he paid these fuckers was going to some shitty company that makes money by buying the ""rights"" to debts cheaply and harassing people for money.  I also had another friend with a very similar story. Around the 7 year mark, just when it's about to fall off, he started getting notices. He paid them (this one was $3000 from a $8000 original debt) and they also sold it off anyways and he kept getting harassed.  In short, fuck debt collectors, just wait the 7 years for it to fall off your credit history. Even if you pay them it seems they don't honor their agreements and will sell your debt off to yet another shitty company who will continue to harass you until they get bored and sell it again. And again. And again."

But when 40% of your sample don't respond to it, it's not that great (neither are antidepressants for that matter)  And there is damn little support for exercise in cases of long term treatment resistant depression.  As for the article... great, WebMD. I think I'm going to spend some time on there and diagnose myself with cushings. /s"

It was so embarrassing when my coworkers would find me. I borrowed a light lamp and that did seem to help, even if it was possibly only a placebo. This year I'm being very careful about taking vitamin D supplements and trying to walk outside more, even when it is nasty and cold. Not to say that any of this will help with your friend's deeper issues, but they might help by not piling SAD on the stuff he is already struggling with.   And I must third the advice to not feel weird about asking for a certain gender of therapist. As a woman, I was asked which sex I prefer, and though I'm sure men don't get asked as much, it is an absolutely common request. A good therapist will know that no only do men and women experience depression differently, but his comfort level is paramount to building a good relationship with them.   I have found the internet extremely helpful during rough times in my life, so perhaps your friend can find an online male depression support group? Sometimes it's good to just be able to unload to a group of people who get it and won't judge. It is also affirming to read about people going through the same thing you are and feel a little less crazy.   Good luck with everything!"

myfriendwantstoknow,2onatg,what__year_is__this,8,Mon Dec 8 15:17:25 2014 UTC,"For what it's worth, most depressed people on reddit seem to understand that men and women usually deal with depression differently. I don't think people in the depression subreddits have a problem talking about gender-specific issues around depression.  More importantly, any therapist should know the statistics on men with depression and suicide. They should also know there is a different set of problems for men with depression and about the different way men often deal with suicidal ideation. Now, they should, but may not in all cases — but one can reasonably expect that a decent therapist would know about these differences without getting into political movements. If a therapist doesn't know about the issues specific to men, they're a crappy therapist.  It's also fine to prefer a therapist of a specific gender. Doctors usually ask women if they're okay with a male therapist, but I take it they don't always ask a man the same thing. If your friend has a choice or a chance to say anything, he can say he prefers a male therapist and shouldn't feel odd about it — well, shouldn't feel as if he should feel odd, if you know what I mean. The doctor should not judge him for that preference, and if the doctor does, it's the doctor who has a problem."

When I switched to Alaska from Ohio I just had to take a 25 question test on a computer. Today it was just a quick vision test and there was 8 signs with no words on them in there I had to list."
myfriendwantstoknow,2odqt0,PeteRit,4,Fri Dec 5 22:13:13 2014 UTC,"Did this in CA 5 years ago.  Here's the page that tells your friend what to do to switch the license over.    Basically, YFSK they don't have to switch their stuff over until they establish residency, but if they're moving to a place with permit parking they'll need to do it immediately as they can't get a parking permit without a CA drivers license and registration.  If they are a visitor in California over 18 and have a valid driver license from their home state or country, they may drive in this state without getting a California driver license as long as their home state license remains valid.  If they become a California resident, they must get a California driver license within 10 days. Residency is established by voting in a California election, paying resident tuition, filing for a homeowner's property tax exemption, or any other privilege or benefit not ordinarily extended to nonresidents.  This is the process when you go to the DMV:    Visit a DMV office (make an Appointment(s) for faster service) Complete application form DL 44 (An original DL 44 form must be submitted. Copies will not be accepted.) Give a thumb print Have your picture taken Provide your social security number. It will be verified with the Social Security Administration while you are in the office. Verify your birth date and legal presence (your name must match your birth certificate or whatever you use) Provide your true full name Pay the application fee Pass a vision exam Pass a traffic laws and sign test. There are 36 questions on the test. You have three chances to pass.   Study for the test.  Your friend will only get 3 shots taking it before they have to also take a driving test.  The parking is confusing - I failed it the first time and barely passed the second time even with studying."

myfriendwantstoknow,2ocmne,WhyImNotDoingWork,7,Fri Dec 5 16:58:05 2014 UTC,"One of the mediators of mourning is how a person died. Suicide has potential to bring about a lot of extra emotions in the grieving process. Some feel anger, guilt, and shame to name a few. It's important to remember that there are no right or wrong emotions to experience and to know that one will likely feel multiple, conflicting emotions during this time. Time is often the best medicine, but being around others can help ease the pain. Avoid cliches like ""They're in a better place"" unless you know for sure that they are, and try not to hate the deceased for what they did."

I don't know if we're anything like each other, but here's how I cope. I remind myself that human beings are fucked up, and the world will never be the place it has the potential to be... But people can't help it. Everyone has defects, and everyone is bullshitting their way through life the best they can. This world has a lot of bad, a lot of good, and is overall a neutral experience (if you're lucky). But if you can look past the ugliness you can see a lot of complexity and beauty, even in the darkest corners.   In short, the world is a crazy fucking place, and you're right that most people are just putting on a brave smile and getting through the day. But don't think you're crazy for feeling this way, and don't think there's anything wrong with you. You just might be a little more aware than your average person.   Hope this helps."

This initial visit will help you explore other options to deal with your latest revelations about how you perceive the world around you.  Spirituality can be another avenue that could help, but finding appropriate guidance specific to your current issues can be difficult and the wrong advice could make matters worse. That said, many spiritual principles can help -- honesty, self-reflection, and meditation are common spiritual practices and a genuine belief that everything will work out is an additional bonus that can help calm you.  On that note, meditation practice could be worth looking into. Often times, especially with intelligent individuals, an overactive mind can lead to anxiety and depression, two issues that often resolve with some mental discipline. There are some excellent resources on meditation and practicing meditation can begin immediately with little to no cost.  Whatever you decide to do, or not do about this, just know that you can be more satisfied with life and feel more secure in the world you inhabit. This is not hippie bullshit; this is my personal experience."

myfriendwantstoknow,2nod3w,0110101001101011,5,Fri Nov 28 22:36:46 2014 UTC,"A lot of people get anxious when they sit still with nothing to do. How often do you see people just sitting around doing nothing? people are usually on their phones, listening to music, playing on their computer, working, studying, anything to keep their mind off of things.  You are not alone. I agree, our minds are weird and once you let them do their run they can lead you to weird places, that's why most people get uncomfortable when doing nothing.  I have personally found comfort in music, working out, working, swimming, eating, cooking, and occupying my overactive brain with new projects (opened up a couple small businesses and I'm currently working on my third). Video games, movies, a lot of things can help pass the time.  I personally think that people who are geniuses at certain things probably decided to devote their brainpower and time to that certain thing. So my recommendation is to devout yourself to something while maintaining good hobbies and pass-time activities.  You are normal. This is normal, not a lot of people are comfortable in the loneliness of their brain. Why do you think solitary confinement is so much worse than just being in jail.  It also sounds like you could use a good relationship. Having daily interactions and activities with someone you're comfortable around can help."

I'm trying to look beyond the actual words you're saying, OP, to imagine what you're possibly reflecting, if that makes any sense.   Specifically: ""he cannot recall a single moment where he had genuine comfort living inside the mind he occupies"" - this signals some sort of detachment. Your friend is ""living inside"" his mind, in which he is not comfortable. That could either be some different way of describing the feeling of being uncomfortable in your own skin, as is often the case when someone's really depressed - feeling like a dog on its hind legs - or it could mean he literally feels separate from his mind and somehow imprisoned by it.  ""He wonders if everyone is putting on a brave smile"" - well, some people - lots of people, certainly. But no, not everyone. In a way, I guess, but no. My smiles are usually genuine, but I don't always smile. In other words, when I enjoy life, I'm not pretending, but I don't always enjoy life. It's hard. It's hard for everyone... but if your perceptions are that it's always miserable for everyone, I'm guessing it's because you feel like it's always miserable for you, which is a problem.  Whatever the case, please go to a doc. If/when you get a good one, you'll be pleasantly surprised how much they can help and how much better life can be."

It's not an identity thing, but what i mean is, although I have all the comforts I need, I'm wondering why 'happiness' still isn't kicking in for me yet, and hasn't. I keep myself pretty fit. I work out really hard, and I used to think that working out was the only thing that made me happy. But I realise now, that in working out like a beast - I offer myself the opportunity to mentally escape the present moment. Much like how many people take recreational drugs (including alcohol) to escape the pain of their reality.  When I work, I escape myself also, and thus I don't feel it then either. (although work can be a pain and a bore in other ways)  I never party and I don't go on holiday, and now that I think about it, this is the reason. Because the moment I stop. I feel this strange kind of existential angst.  I just can't stop and be with myself for any moment of time."

Finally got it on the ropes lately and have been doing infinitely better.   Do you feel like if you let yourself, you'd lay around literally all day because nothing interests you anymore?  Do you feel isolated? (yes)   Do you sometimes feel worthless, hopeless, have feelings of guilt, etc?  Do you have an irregular sleep pattern? Eg: too much, too little?  Have trouble concentrating?   Eating issues (Hungry all the time or never hungry)?  Anger/irritability?  These are some of the symptoms. Not all and it's not the same for everyone but feeling uncomfortable in your own skin; having a hard time remembering what happiness is like/convinced you've never felt it (you probably have), and/or you won't again (you will); having little to no interest in ""normal"" activities like socializing, etc. - these are things I deal with and it sounds like that's what you're dealing with.  Like I said, I feel infinitely better now and have for a while. What's the difference? Medicine, unfortunately. Such is life, however. Some people have calcium deficiencies and need to take pills for it, some people have diabetes and need to take insulin, some people have heart disease in their family. I have depression in my family and in my life and I need to take medicine for it. Every so often, I'll stop taking my meds for a while either deliberately or accidentally and I'll start to feel like shit again. Not necessarily actively sad all the time but certainly not happy.

Since the placeholder you're talking about seems to be an aftermarket add-on, isn't there a ""try before you buy"" option, or couldn't you just have several different sizes to fit the occasion?"
myfriendwantstoknow,2nedai,Mremerkin,6,Tue Nov 25 19:28:55 2014 UTC,"Things like this aren't typically try before you buy and they're often custom made by specialty shops so you can't get a look at your local sex shop.

I can have sex with it, pee with it, and just wear it."
myfriendwantstoknow,2nedai,unforgivablecursive,6,Tue Nov 25 19:51:01 2014 UTC,"So if I'm understanding correctly, it's not something that you can swap out then, like a prosthetic leg, even if it's custom made and fitted?

myfriendwantstoknow,2ndzr3,woofspider,4,Tue Nov 25 17:28:04 2014 UTC,"Correct: Non-smoking tests look for cotinine in the urine, which is the major metabolite (and anagram) of nicotine. Its half-life is a little less than a day, and it takes a little over a week for it to drop below detectable levels since last nicotine exposure. It will not, however, detect ∆9-THC or any of its metabolites (unless you're rolling with tobacco as well).   Just remember that once they have your urine, anyone can run whatever additional tests they have available. I doubt it's legal to do that without prior notice, but I'm no lawyer."
myfriendwantstoknow,2ndzr3,Fleckeri,1 point,Wed Nov 26 03:21:09 2014 UTC,"Cotinine:       Cotinine is an alkaloid found in tobacco and is also a metabolite of nicotine.   The word ""cotinine"" is an anagram of ""nicotine"". Cotinine is used as a biomarker for exposure to tobacco smoke. Cotinine was developed as an antidepressant as a fumaric acid salt, cotinine fumarate, to be sold under the brand name Scotine. It was never marketed.    Similarly to nicotine, cotinine binds to, activates, and desensitizes neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, though at much lower potency in comparison.     It has demonstrated nootropic and antipsychotic-like effects in animal models.   Direct administration of high levels of cotinine resulted in no significant physiologic, subjective, or performance effects.

Plantar warts are found on the bottom of the feet. Palmar wants on the palm of the hand but you can pretty much get warts anywhere on your body.  If your friend hasn't tried an OTC (over-the-counter) freezing agent, that would be my first step. Let it blister and don't pop it. If the wart is deep, it make take a couple applications to get it all.  Your friend can also look in any drugstore for a wart product that contains salicylic acid. It has to be applied daily to eat away the layers until the wart is gone.   If the non-prescription products don't work, your friend should go see a skin specialist or dermatologist to get them cut out."

Sometimes the warts have to come off in layers and each application eats another layer off. If he can see little black dots in the wart, he can try using tweezers to pluck those roots out. That's why his keeping coming back, the roots are still in there...plus, it's a virus so you've got to kill it all.  EDIT: if it's on his thumb, it may just be a general wart. Here is a site with treatment options for common warts.  EDIT2: I've also heard of people using apple-cider vinegar to remove warts."

On the contract it will say who the authorized signers are. This makes it so you can't just say ""yeah I'm the property owner so tow this car.""   The signs look like this. At the bottom left is the tow company with their number and the ""authorized only by"" is the property management team that need to have a rep there to actually tow a car.

We ended up calling the police because when we got to their tow lot, the drivers got angry at us for pointing out their bullshit. The owner knew they had fucked up, but didn't want to admit it in front of her drivers, so she said she was charging $100, but charged him $1. Still, bunch of hassle over some bullshit."

If the police officer writes your name wrong doesn't that just make it a ticket for someone else? After all, it's not your name that's on it. You can claim that someone else with the name Britney was driving your car. He has your papers too, if he wrote the wrong name it isn't because he asked you what it is and guessed the spelling, he supposedly copied it from he driver's license."

If it's an oversight like that it doesn't change the fact that you were violating laws. Courts are almost never going to release you from a ticket for such a small oversight. No court is going to assume that someone with the 'misspelled' name was driving the car (hopefully) registered to the person speeding who has a coincidentally similar name. For stuff like that, courts do not operate like an extreme coupon exploitation scenario where you can just stack small oversights to get free passes. You will be summoned to court, and if you do not show up on the grounds that your name was misspelled,  then you will almost certainly face penalties. A judge will not dismiss it, but rather amend the error to reflect the fact that YOU were speeding. Just thought I needed to clarify that because this is such a BS rumor that people just keep believing."

myfriendwantstoknow,2mmfp4,MissAvacado,24,Tue Nov 18 02:09:48 2014 UTC,"3 levels this could be looked at:   employer policy state licensing board policy federal law   Most pharmacies are a part of national corporations, and so likely would structure policies by federal regulations.  Pharmacies are most likely concerned about two things - protection from liability due to staff error, and protection from theft/misappropriation of medications. It would probably be fair to assume that they'll have little tolerance for substances that even if legal on a state-level are associated with anything illegal on a federal level.  The state licensing board will most likely do so as well, with the inclusion of professional ethics and standards.  Most medically-related licensing boards have publicly available logs of reprimanded licensees and the reason. A quick scan through there would suggest whether it would seem to be something that is of concern to them or not."

The question you want to ask is can he successfully deny it?  And the answer to that is.... eh.  If the officer walks over, your friend's tires are hot, tacky, and balding, and there is a strong smell of burning rubber surrounding the vehicle... no.  If the cop really gets a bug up his ass, they can try checking the tread pattern on your friend's car vs the rubber he left on the pavement.  Whether any of this would hold up in court will depend on the judge, but they could certainly make it a hassle.    In the end, your friend shouldn't do it if they can't live with the potential fine.

If they ask, and it is really that big of an issue for her and her parents, she can tell them it is for something like that.

But I agree with /u/lennifer, the quality wouldn't be great, especially depending on the binding of the book. But here's a technique that can produce a high quality duplicate without anyone bothering you about copyright (I work in a library and I've used this method myself to scan old books).  Basically, you take digital photos of all the pages. It sounds like a pain, but it's really not that bad, and probably quicker than using a regular photocopier.    set up a digital camera on a tripod, pointing down at the book below it.  Use a high resolution setting, and zoom in as much as possible so the open book takes up most of the photo. IMPORTANT: don't move the book or camera at any point during the process (other than to gently turn the page), this allows you to batch edit the photos later. Once you get started it actually goes pretty fast, just turn the page and click, turn and click, etc. After taking the photos, you can use Photoshop (or probably another image editor) to create batch editing processes. Basically you ""record"" the edits you make to a single photo (cropping the edges, adjusting brightness), then apply the same edits to your entire batch. (This is why you can't move the book during the process, the photos all have to match exactly otherwise you could end up with stuff cut off). Once you're done in Photoshop, combine the images into a PDF and voila! You have a book in PDF form that no one will realize came from digital camera photos."
myfriendwantstoknow,2maj32,CoughingLamb,3,Fri Nov 14 22:19:55 2014 UTC,"The quality wouldn't be terrific and it would take forever, but it is physically possible, if that's what you're asking...?

myfriendwantstoknow,2m706p,summerofsin,17,Thu Nov 13 16:58:38 2014 UTC,"It depends entirely on the actual place names and the directions.   It would certainly narrow things down, though.  To take your example (and assuming your friend is in the US), there are 8,186 5th/Fifth streets in the US (1993 Census data, as mined by the National League of Cities).  There are 6,946 Oak streets (ibid.).  But there are far fewer instances of a Fifth and an Oak intersecting.  It's still a fairly large sample set for one intersection, though.  Just on the West Coast, a few minutes with Google's Mapping tools turns up 5th and Oaks in Port Angeles, WA (a lovely little town, if you've never been); Portland, Oregon; Oakland, CA; and a half dozen others.  So that doesn't narrow it down even to the state level.  But we've still cut the search space down from the order of thousands for a single street, to the order of tens/hundreds in the country for an intersection.  Now look at the second intersection.  Even though it's another very popular street name, just adding the data about a second intersection excludes a lot of cities.  Oak St. in Portland, e.g., only runs to 10th street.  That's going to similarly exclude a lot of other cities.  (It similarly rules out, e.g., Washington, MO, which has an Oak St. that terminates at 5th.)  So with ~15 minutes with Google Maps API, with just three (fairly popular) street names and information about their layout, I've narrowed it down to just a few cities.  If I knew even minor biographical details about your friend and was committed to the task, I'm fairly confident I could figure out their exact location most of the time.  On a related note, if this kind of thing is interesting or important to your friend, they should review some of the OpSec work done by The Grugq.  A good condensation of his advise is available here: http://grugq.tumblr.com/post/60463307186/rules-of-clandestine-operation  In particular, the question at hand is covered by 2.1: ""Never reveal your operational details"" and by item 4 in its entirety."

myfriendwantstoknow,2m706p,NWilli,9,Fri Nov 14 00:51:00 2014 UTC,"Your friend's directions don't make any sense to me.     5th        13th      |            |     |            |     |            | ------------------------------    Oak     |            |     |            |   I'm assuming your friend is walking along Oak, because I'm assuming that 5th and 13th run parallel. Starting from 5th and Oak, your friend walks towards 13th and takes a right onto it. Either 13th or Oak is a strange street if they intersect twice. So your friend must be turning their neck right, then simply turning around and walking back towards 5th. Please draw a more accurate diagram if you want us to understand."
myfriendwantstoknow,2m706p,Sophophilic,14,Thu Nov 13 21:45:02 2014 UTC,"So you'd take a right off of Oak, and then hit Oak again?"
myfriendwantstoknow,2m706p,Sophophilic,9,Thu Nov 13 20:28:04 2014 UTC,"Yeah, what?  5th and Oak going to 13th implies that you travel on Oak past 6th, 7th, etc. until 13th. Turn right on 13th traveling away from Oak and then somehow turn on Oak."

myfriendwantstoknow,2m706p,Mister_Squishy,2,Thu Nov 13 23:31:18 2014 UTC,"Then he is bad at grammar. Also, right is dependent on the direction his friend is approaching 13th from."
myfriendwantstoknow,2m706p,Relient-J,2,Fri Nov 14 04:14:09 2014 UTC,"So if OP is at 5th and Oak, and OP's buddy needs to take a right on 13th and a left on Oak then basically OP's friend could be anywhere, as long as he's not on a numbered street smaller than 13 or a street one block or more left of Oak (or under, depending on how you draw the map of OP's drivel). Ok OP, how old are you? Please don't say more than 10."
myfriendwantstoknow,2m706p,delta0062,1 point,Fri Nov 14 04:24:25 2014 UTC,"Well the directions would be as follows:   Driving on (unspecified road by OP), make a right onto 13th. Then make a left onto Oak and take that to the 5th st cross street. So OP could be 'four' places if you count each corner as a place.    But in the end this is about if someone can find you from this. No, are you fucking serious.

I strongly recommend seeing a doctor for her pain. It can easily be treated more effectively by a professional. If left too long hemmeroids can require surgery. There is also the outside chance that this could be more serious than a simple hemmeriod.
myfriendwantstoknow,2m5jff,lookin_left,12,Thu Nov 13 09:48:46 2014 UTC,"Hi HMB. I know what it feels like to be a teenager and be embarrassed to talk to your parents, especially about health concerns. When I was 16 I had skin tags appear around my genitals. Not only was I mortified, I didn't know what skin tags WERE, so my imagination ran wild. Ultimately I turned to my mother, and we went to the doctor. It wasn't fun, but I got the answers I needed. I'm now a nursing student and I have a couple comments I hope your friend will take to heart:   This is not a problem that's likely to go away. An embarrassing talk with their parents will only hurt a little while, but the other pain in their ass will probably not be going anywhere until they see a doctor. Also, this is not necessarily a hemorrhoid. It could be a skin tag that is agitated each time they have a bowel movement and cleanse themself (I know, I have one, and my ass bleeds everyday.) Most importantly, if your friend doesn't address this at all, it could get much worse. If it is a hemorrhoid it could become more severe, and if it's not, they are still at risk for developing an infection (take. this. seriously.)   Anyway, that's all I got. I wish your friend the strength and courage she needs to seek out a physician, with or without her parents. I sincerely believe they will be glad they did in the long run."

myfriendwantstoknow,2m5jff,Suepahfly,3,Thu Nov 13 14:11:03 2014 UTC,"Sounds like an external hemorrhoid. There are external and internal kinds but since your friend describes it as a ""tiny piece of skin"" it is probably external. Things to do: 1) sitz baths - google it but basically sitting in a tub with warm water, it can really help 2) hydrocortisone cream will help with swelling, get the cheap store brand at any pharmacy, no prescription needed 3) if there's bleeding applying witch hazel with cotton balls will help also available at a pharmacy without prescription 4) take a fiber supplement with psyllium husk - like Metamucil but there are less expensive store brand versions, take a couple tablespoons a day and drink a lot of water. I've been dealing with the exact same problem for many years. The ""larger bump thing"" could be a thrombosed hemorrhoid which will be really painful until it settles down. If it keeps getting like that your friend should also see a doctor just to make sure it isn't anything more serious."

Find the sketchiest area you can find, walk around during midday. Only carry the money you plan to spend. No cell phone, no wallet, nothing you'd regret getting stolen. Look for people or groups of people standing on corners or at busy sections of town. Make and hold eye contact with them. If they wave you over, or ask ""You good? You alright? You need? You looking?"" or anything to that effect, you're in business. This is the most likely way to get ripped off, robbed, or shorted, but it does work. Safer method, but still incredibly sketchy. Start talking to homeless people, give them some change or a dollar, ask if they want a cigarette. Talk to them while you guys smoke your cigarettes. After introductions and some small talk, start off with ""You smoke weed?"" if they say yes, ask them if they fuck around with anything else. Ask them to hook you up in return for $5, $10, or if you have a very large order $20. Go with them to get it, don't let them walk away with your money. Again, only bring the money you plan to spend and a pack of cigarettes.   Good luck and be safe. There are people that wouldn't hesitate to beat the shit out of you or even kill you for $10."

From the link:  ""Basil- Means, “I hate you.” The ancient Greeks are responsible for this as they claimed basil represented hatred. This is also present in some European folklore that uses basil as a symbol of satan.  Peony- Means “I’m angry at you.”  The meaning of this is derived from the fact that once peonies are planted, they hate to be moved and if they are moved, they punish the planter by not flowering for several years.  Snapdragon- Means “You lied to me.” This meaning dates back to the trend of concealing snapdragons in one’s overcoat to appear fascinating. Because of the concealment, snapdragons have taken on a meaning of deception.  Oleander- Means “You better watch out.” This meaning is derived from the toxic nature of oleanders. Consuming them can be fatal so you must always be cautious around them."""

Then I drove around for about an hour to reset the sensors and was able to pass emissions.  This worked the first time but the next year the check engine light came back on almost right away, and I had to actually get the catalytic converter fixed.  Each state is different so check the requirements for your state.  I'm pretty sure that in Georgia you don't have to get your vehicle completely fixed per se, but have to spend a certain amount of money towards fixing it.   Really though, the longer you put off maintenance on your car, the bigger the problem will become as well as the cost of repairing it."

Sex without consent or under non-consensual terms (say they agree so long as the other person is using birth control and then they don't without mentioning it, rape) is rape.  Sex following coercion, threats, or fear is also rape.    Someone can never say no or object and it can still be rape if they didn't consent, didn't have the ability to consent, or were given false information that informed their decision."
myfriendwantstoknow,2lcc3a,Tyrien,4,Wed Nov 5 17:00:49 2014 UTC,It sounds like rape.   Something happened that she didn't want to happen after she expressed several times she didn't want it to happen.

Let's say, for instance, the two parties have been consentually sexually active for a bit, now the woman wants out but the dude doesn't know. He puts on the moves, she feebly resists but ""gives in"" - is that rape? Was it ever explicit that she didn't want to have sex? He had more than enough reason to assume his advances were welcome... those kind of situations get complicated. I feel like there's a push to call anything like that ""rape"" but it's not fair or responsible to cast a crime so serious in such black and white terms."

myfriendwantstoknow,2lcc3a,spacewrecked,1 point,Fri Nov 7 05:56:12 2014 UTC,"Rape is sex without consent. Consent, in this case, doesn't just mean ""saying yes"", it means ""clear, continuous, and enthusiastic consent"". Sex into which you were coerced or that was only had when you were given no/little other choice (and especially sex where the person was already touching/interacting with you with sexual intentions, like the touching and clothes removal that you've described here)...well, that doesn't fit under how consent works.  I honestly don't think there's a difference between rape and sexual assault. Any difference there may be is purely a matter of semantics and is not meaningful when determining what a situation really is. Unfortunately, this means your friend was raped."

myfriendwantstoknow,2lcc3a,xhable,12,Wed Nov 5 08:08:21 2014 UTC,"Rape is sex   without consent, or with use of physical force, coercion, deception, threat, and/or when the victim is:   mentally incapacitated or impaired, or physically impaired (due to voluntary or involuntary alcohol or drug consumption) asleep or unconscious.

Alcohol and pot are usually not recommended though I'm not aware of any outstanding interactions, mostly risks of increase in the prevailing symptoms and side effects.  It also increases difficulty in differentiating between the net impact upon moods and cognition from the various substances. Particularly with alcohol, there may likely be additional stress placed on the liver and kidneys. Frequency of use is of course a factor in all of this.  Totally non-binding unofficial suggestion: a bit here and there for socializing is generally fine, if usage of alcohol or pot are more regular, those may need to be evaluated as contributing factors with regard to assessing and addressing mental health."

myfriendwantstoknow,2kt4ba,TuckerMcG,1 point,Thu Oct 30 21:18:08 2014 UTC,"What crime could the cops possibly charge him with? I'm serious. Do you think it's illegal to take more than the recommended dose of a legally prescribed medicine? Because nothing in OP's post should lead you to believe he's in possession of Schedule I narcotics or drugs that were not legally prescribed to him by a doctor. (And yes, I know that there's an issue about the fraudulent intent behind obtaining the prescriptions, but the cops would never know about that unless OP's friend told them that L was getting the drugs through fraudulent means. There's also a hearsay issue at play over that fact, so it's really not a concern.)"
myfriendwantstoknow,2kt4ba,TuckerMcG,1 point,Thu Oct 30 21:58:43 2014 UTC,It's not even that my friend wants the police involved to charge him with anything. My friend wants to know if there is some type of authority who can get this person admitted to a psych unit. He's been showing recurrent suicidal behavior. he started with certain drugs to self medicate but now he's taking massive amounts of things that he doesn't even know what they do. It's just getting very worrisome. My friend doesn't want this guy arrested or charged with anything. My friend wants this guy committed because his behavior is becoming dangerous and she doesn't want him hurt.
myfriendwantstoknow,2kt4ba,pfeper,1 point,Thu Oct 30 22:51:40 2014 UTC,"Right well usually to force someone into a psych ward against their will it requires police intervention. I don't know the procedures for reporting someone who's a danger to themselves, and whether the danger has to be imminent or whether your friend could do it while he's not actively endangering himself. But I'm fairly sure you'd need to call the cops and let them know he needs to be admitted to a mental hospital if you wanted him to get treatment and he won't go voluntarily. But ""attempted suicide"" usually isn't punishable by law (in the sense of jail and a criminal record) unless the act endangered others. But that also depends on what state your friend is in and isn't legal advice, so your friend should check up on the state laws on that issue or seek professional legal counsel about it."
myfriendwantstoknow,2kt4ba,humbleroller,1 point,Thu Oct 30 23:33:41 2014 UTC,"My friend is just worried about her friend. He seems like he is very much a danger to himself. She would doubt that there would be any punishment, all of the drugs he's been using were legal anyway, she's just worried because he seems like wants to hurt himself. My friend hasn't talked to this person in a few days, so he may have found someone else to help."

Before receiving this note, I had not had contact with this person in nearly a year. I got in contact with the police, they tracked down the IP address from which the email was sent to a hotel in a different state and called the local police.  The local police went to the hotel, found my family member and knocked on the door.    The police did not arrest him, but they did help his mother get him into a hospital for psychiatric care.    I encourage your friend to call the police and express concerns over their friend's safety."
myfriendwantstoknow,2kt4ba,chrisofd3ath,4,Fri Oct 31 18:05:56 2014 UTC,i would mention it to the doctor and get their opinion on what else can be done. your friend is a good friend.

myfriendwantstoknow,2kt4ba,KittenPurrs,2,Thu Oct 30 19:06:39 2014 UTC,Getting someone arrested because they like getting high is fucked up. If he's wronged you in some way I understand but if he's just getting high let him be. Cut him out of your life if need be but don't get him arrested. Maybe refer him to an addictionologist/rehab but involving the police will just fuck his life up and not help at all.
myfriendwantstoknow,2kt4ba,CUNTBERT_RAPINGTON,1 point,Thu Oct 30 19:13:39 2014 UTC,"No she's not trying to get him arrested, and it's not for being high. He started off with getting high and she was ok with that but it's escalated into wanting to overdose on the drugs on he was using and threats of suicide and she thinks he needs to be admitted to inpatient, but his parents won't do it. He's not just getting high any more. He's using massive amounts of prescription drugs. He started off getting high as self medication. Now he's doing a lot more than just getting high. His behavior is becoming dangerous. My friend really doesnt care that he gets high. My friend is worried that her friend will do something to hurt himself."
myfriendwantstoknow,2kt4ba,TuckerMcG,2,Thu Oct 30 22:27:00 2014 UTC,Fair enough. Depending on the laws he can be involuntarily commited but it could affect his life/career down the road so keep that in mind. Has she tried talking to him?

myfriendwantstoknow,2kt4ba,TuckerMcG,3,Fri Oct 31 01:37:39 2014 UTC,"Since there are lots of Redditors here who have watched too many police brutality videos, I'm going to advise your friend not to listen to them. Your friend should not close off the possibility of police involvement if the situation becomes dire. It may not be the best primary course of action, and your friend should consider discussing L's issues with the doctor first, but your friend should not think that police are an improper authority to help L.  Your friend doesn't need to call the cops on L for illicit drug use (which would be kind of useless since he obtained legal drugs through a legal prescription). But your friend could call the cops to prevent L from mortally hurting himself (as he's expressed that intent) or from hurting others (which L may express intent about in the future). Sometimes people don't know how to ask for help, and court mandated therapy and rehabilitation could save L's life and turn it around. Unfortunately, that decision rests solely with your friend, as people on the Internet do not know enough about L to make a determination of whether police involvement is proper or not.  Tl;dr: Your friend shouldn't blindly trust the advice of Redditors who distrust police simply due to the abundance of content posted on this website showing police brutality.   Edit: Since I let it be known elsewhere in this thread that I'm a law student, nothing I say, or have ever said, should be construed as legal advice by anyone. Get a real lawyer if you have a legal issue. Don't listen to people on the Internet."

Personally, Creative Suite 4 was the easiest for me to find with the crack included. (note the ""DOWNLOAD"" buttons are all ads, you're looking for the ""download this torrent"" text with the magnet icon.  Now execute the torrent file (it may ask you what program to use, tell it uTorrent), and it will start downloading. May take a bit.    Once it's done, scan that fucker with every virus checker you've got. (Microsoft Security Essentials is free and decent, there are others, suggestions welcome).    Unzip your new file. You'll need to install CS4 as normal. The program will run, but ask you if you're doing a 30 day trial, or if you'd like to input a purchase code. This is where you shut the program down, replace some of the program files with other files from the ""crack"" folder (there should be a crack readme.txt) Then run the keygen, it'll spit out your code. Relaunch any of the adobe creative suite programs, tell it you have a code, and paste it in.    You now have a cracked copy of Adobe CS4. Enjoy it while you can, they've gone to a subscription-based model so this will be basically impossible in 5 years if you want a decently up-to-date design suite.  Cheers.    edit - uninstall, or at the very least shut down uTorrent once you're all-good. You don't want people DLing that file off you all day long."

myfriendwantstoknow,2k20f5,myfriendsthrow,30,Thu Oct 23 01:47:37 2014 UTC,Just go to multiple writing tutors and university provided writing aids until you have a solid paper they will help you.  If is not worth risking your academic career over one class.
myfriendwantstoknow,2k20f5,mtn_folk,10,Thu Oct 23 04:06:56 2014 UTC,"He wasn't aware such things existed, and has never heard of that at his university but he will look into it. Thanks :)"
myfriendwantstoknow,2k20f5,Mremerkin,19,Thu Oct 23 12:18:17 2014 UTC,"Sorry, but if I was hiring a software developer, I would want one that is capable of communicating his ideas both verbally and on paper, or so blasted talented that I wouldn't care if he was a mumbling cretin that can't color inside the lines.   What is the course designation of this 'oh so vital course' that isn't important but he has to pass?   And if he's so shit hot as a developer, his performance in the field, not his final grades will determine if he's hired and at what salary."
myfriendwantstoknow,2k20f5,Mremerkin,-4,Thu Oct 23 02:06:56 2014 UTC,"My friend doesn't want to give too much information away, however he can say that the class he needs this for is related to sociology, a subject which doesn't have ties with software development at all.  He gets good grades in other classes, but this one will be the downer. Maybe because he's not interested in the subject at all.  Also, he has a lot going on in final year with his final project. It's a very large piece of software he has to write, and he has to minimise other workloads.  Passing his degree with over 70% is more of a personal goal, and I realise that sounds stupid seen as he's looking for someone to write his essay, however it's on a subject which isn't related at all to his goals. It's also required by a few potential employers where he'd love to work and would thrive."
myfriendwantstoknow,2k20f5,Kratzyyy,11,Thu Oct 23 02:22:32 2014 UTC,"Tell friend, that a course description gives nothing away about who, what, and where he is and paraphrasing would even further obscure any potential identification.   I gotta call bullshit on his explanation. He's saying that the subject has nothing to do with software development, but some of his preferred potential employers require it. If it didn't have anything to do with their business, they wouldn't put this importance on it."
myfriendwantstoknow,2k20f5,Mremerkin,6,Thu Oct 23 02:35:51 2014 UTC,"I'm not OP, but it sounds like he's in the UK in which case you don't really get recognised for individual classes, just for the degree itself.  So for example on a Computing (just guessing what he's doing) degree you could have a useless module (our word for class) that's not relevant, but employers would never know about the specific modules you've taken, just that you have a Computing degree. I've seen irrelevant modules tacked onto degrees before.  @OP: just wrote your own essay."
myfriendwantstoknow,2k20f5,Jen_Nozra,3,Thu Oct 23 03:33:56 2014 UTC,"Sounds to me that he tried to second guess what upper level electives might give him an edge up, and he bit off more than he could chew ... and is now trying to take the easy way out rather than dropping the course or living up to his own elevated expectations.

This happens for many people in the world. The greater question here, is how does your friend choose to deal with these things? Does he blame, side-step, avoid, reject? Or does he step up, figure out how it is relevant (a part of larger goals or contexts), ask for help, do it the best he can anyway, get it done quickly and move forward?  How your friend ends up approaching and succeeding at this may very well be useful in his future. I'm sure, since your friend already has such a successful career, he knows that potential employers in interviews will often ask candidates, ""Tell us about a time when you were challenged and how you overcame that?""   What sort of answer would your friend want to be able to give?"

myfriendwantstoknow,2k0n5e,throwawayforafriend3,12,Wed Oct 22 18:39:33 2014 UTC,"It very much depends on where (i.e. what country) your friend lives. I can only speak for Germany, but here and in the context of her owning the place and having full and proper access to it, the whole house could be searched. It's complicated for other living arrangements such as a dorm, but I suppose those do not apply here. Any circumstantial findings could result in a lawsuit if they were to be considered in the public interest.  But more importantly, maybe your friend should consider seeking help instead of legal action. First of all, they themselves might have some psychological problems due to the circumstances, which should be fixed immediately so they don't solidify. Furthermore, legal action against someone who has a threatening drug problem is exactly zero help - substantial and self harming drug use is usually indicative of large psychological problems that cannot be fixed by the legal system, and being purely vindictive against such a person will have long-lasting consequences for both them and your friend's conscience. So getting the fuzz involved would be just about the worst course of action your friend could take. There are many, many more mature options that would result in all people involved healing their problems instead of ripping the family apart. And that can happen regardless of whatever happened before, and would not even necessarily involve forgiveness or reconciliation."

If they converse more casually than with other customers, he could set you up on a blind date. If they converse normally for such interactions, then he's the creep if he suggests a blind date (exception if your friend is a bartender).   Either way, you already know her name and have spied on her Facebook, which you'll either have to come clean about (awkward) or have hanging over your head with a shadow of guilt during any potential relationship.

The material is mostly water and a little protein, so any detergent you'd use to get dried food from cloth ought to be effective.  Because you're asking this question, I'm tempted to assume that you haven't washed this blanket often, if at all, and you may be less sophisticated on the intricacies of how a washing machine works.  Usually, one of the options on the machine involved extra soaks, extra rinses, etc.  There are also spray-on bottles that you can buy at most grocery stores for stain treatment.  Dreft is very effective.  Just spray it on the blanket's most stained spots, toss it in the washing machine and let it soak there for a bit, then turn on the washing machine and let it do its best.  Depending on the color and material of the blanket, you may have some slight discoloring, but that happens with old fabric eventually if you wash it, so don't worry about it.  The most important things to remember about masturbation are these: 1) Everyone else is doing it, too, 2) you're never being as loud or conspicuous as you think you are, and 3) everyone would like to avoid talking with you about it as much as you would like to avoid talking to them."

We have fast lane access and a history with the border patrol working the bridge we normally use.   We still get searched about once a month.  My dad has been searched three times in row, on the way to work, back, and the next morning.  You might make it across the border.  If you get searched, and you might, they'll arrest you and charge you to the fullest extent. They do not fuck around at the border.  My advice is do not under any circumstance give the border officials any reason to arrest you."

Much more so than the Canadian border agents who tend to be pretty friendly and though they ask mostly the same things tend to curious (in a nice way) when you're passing through on a roadtrip or a vacation or something.  If you're going to do this, make sure you clearly had a valid reason to be going in and out of the country and sell it right. Personally I'de recommend making a friend in Montreal and just drinking up there legally, then driving back down sober, which im sure people must do where its so close you can reasonably drive there."

myfriendwantstoknow,2jkif8,engremma,31,Sat Oct 18 00:56:03 2014 UTC,"Military rules on drug use are a little more in-depth than the didactic civilian ""NO POT USE CUZ POT BAD"" line.  Being addicted to drugs can be a real hit to the team if your friend is, for example, deployed to somewhere that he can't get drugs, and he goes into withdrawal and has shakes or tremors during a situation when people are relying on him to be able to hold a weapon straight.  Self-referral to drug treatment programs, with almost no exceptions, is a safe option in the military.  He can go to a medical treatment facility or a specialized drug treatment organization on his base/post/ship, and his commanders are not permitted to do anything disciplinary to him -- he just gets treatment and is completely immune to blowback. (Ok, with a few exceptions -- if he's on a presidential detail or something, he might lose a clearance and get re-assigned to admin duties. But those situations are rare.)  If he's scared, tell him to talk to a chaplain about it.  He doesn't have to be religious to use the chaplain; he can just ask for some counseling -- all chaplains are supposed to be expert at non-religious counseling, and more importantly, they know everything about all the drug rehab programs, every last detail, and they have the best confidentiality system in the service.  Anything he tells the chaplain is lock-down unbreakably confidential forever, until or unless he gives the chaplain permission to talk about it.  They're really good places to share your dirty little secrets.  He's subject to random drug testing at any time, of course; my command did 100% urinalysis testing on Saturday afternoon one year because they got a random tip one guy was using something -- so they checked us all when we weren't expecting it, just to make sure.  That means the faster he gets help, the better.  If he gets hit with a pee test and then decides he wants to self-refer, it's too late; he'll be a convicted felon and kicked out before he knows it.  They are awfully serious about that stuff if they catch you at it, because they like to make an example to warn others.  If he (and I'm sorry to be sexist here -- I've gone with ""he"" throughout, because I'm too lazy to type ""him or her"" over and over, even though I know I should) doesn't self-refer, there's nothing your friend can do except either turn him in or wait for him to do something fatal either to himself or someone else.  Military folks do a lot of stuff that's really dangerous when you're impaired -- firing ranges, medical treatment, bombs, flying, scuba, chemical weapons, electrical and mechanical work on 50-year-old equipment designed by the lowest bidder... depending on what the guy does, drug use really raises the odds of him killing himself or someone nearby.  Tl;dr -- tell him to talk to someone and self-refer, so he can't get punished for it."

But I feel like if I report him, I'm just being a vengeful ex.  I did look into what he does, and it doesn't stay in the system long (a week tops I think)  and it's an ever other month/party kinda thing. So there's a chance they won't catch it anyways."

myfriendwantstoknow,2jkif8,PurpleLotus,-1,Sun Oct 19 20:55:51 2014 UTC,"The ""ruining someone's life"" was meant for OP, not you. My bad.  Have you ever tried psychedelics vs. other drugs? It's not a blast of ""feel good"" and euphoria with an urge to take more, it reminds you how beautiful the world is, especially without drugs. Psychedelics are usually a several hour-long meditation session, re-evaluating what is important, and getting a change of perspective in your life.  Personally I'm relieved whenever I come down from a trip - it gives you new-found appreciation for sobriety.  If someone WAS taking them everyday and didn't have some kind of mental disorder it was masking, it would soon become very very unenjoyable. Like, the second or third day. Taking psychedelics to escape your problems is a sure way to have a panic attack and swear off drugs for the rest of your life."

Some people might not like weed or psychedelics, but compared to other drugs like speed, xanax, cocaine, opiates, or dissociatives, both weed and psychedelics are infinitely less addictive. Not just because they aren't physically addictive, but because they don't lend themselves into masking circles like other drugs do. Take any other drug because you're depressed and you feel better. Take a psychedelic because you're depressed and you'll realize WHY you're depressed, why you SHOULDN'T be depressed, and that drugs are not a band-aid for mental or emotional pain.  Go google rates at which people are addicted to what drugs - surprise surprise, you'll see that psychedelics and weed are at the bottom of the list."

We're not making a comparison to psychically addictive drugs, we're talking about absolutes. And psychedelics absolutely can be addictive.   drugs are not a band-aid for mental or emotional pain.

This is where the doctor will check your breasts for lumps to make sure you don't have breast cancer or some-such.

Pirated/cracked software is tricky, and unless you do the crack yourself from the ground up you have no idea what you're actually getting. It's why I'd never pirate an operating system - it likely has root kits out the wazoo and you'd never be able to detect them.  A good chunk of cracked software also contains code that embeds a signature of the group that cracked it. A pretty classic, funny example of this is when Microsoft used some pirated audio software to make some of the audio files in Windows XP -   http://www.techpavan.com/2009/05/24/microsoft-deepz0ne-pirated-cracked-sound-forge-windows-xp-audio/  That's an MP3 (edit, sorry, said MP3 but it's a WAV) file that has just that little signature embedded in it if you opened it up in Notepad. You wouldn't know it was there until you looked, the audio played just fine and was shipped on millions of copies of software.  So if /u/Oprama2016's friend were to upload the picture where EXIF data is retained then someone could potentially download it and see it was from a cracked copy of the program. So if he uploaded it to Facebook or a Gallery website under his name, someone could put two and two together and see that he was using a cracked copy."

myfriendwantstoknow,2j7oth,gaarasgourd,28,Tue Oct 14 13:15:16 2014 UTC,The best advice I can give your friend is to start keeping track of where he has worked and to develop a resume which focuses on what job he is after. I'm in the same situation as him and funny enough I'm applying for an IT position at a bank and it's my first time applying to an adult job so I'm a little nervous despite my experiences
myfriendwantstoknow,2j7oth,AlucardD80,8,Tue Oct 14 13:47:46 2014 UTC,"Don't be nervous. Get ready to be asked basic questions like ""What end user devices have you worked with"" and ""have you worked with a ticketing system?"". Study right now on ticketing systems and tell them you have if you haven't had a chance to yet. Expect them to ask you what you think you'll be doing while you're there. They are looking for people they aren't going to have to train a lot and someone who isn't just book smart."

myfriendwantstoknow,2j7oth,AlucardD80,2,Tue Oct 14 14:34:00 2014 UTC,At work we use autotask I think there are some training videos on the site to give you the jist of how ticketing systems work.

myfriendwantstoknow,2j7oth,AlucardD80,17,Tue Oct 14 20:09:35 2014 UTC,If your friend is a full time university student tell them to start applying for internships in their field. Internships usually lead to 'real-adult' full time positions. The only downside is little to no pay but believe me the experience is what employers are going to want see when your friend starts looking for a career. Another option is to find out about student jobs on campus relevant to your friend's career these can also lead to great recommendations and often job opportunities after graduation.
myfriendwantstoknow,2j7oth,Hipster_Garabe,11,Tue Oct 14 14:15:06 2014 UTC,"My friend is a theater major and wants to be an actor.  He wants a legitimate job as a day job until (hopefully, lmao) he's successful enough of an actor that he can act full time.  My friend doesn't want to be a server like most struggling actors."
myfriendwantstoknow,2j7oth,AlucardD80,7,Tue Oct 14 14:21:58 2014 UTC,With that I think instead of a cubicle job and such your friend would be better suited as a front desk clerk or maybe as a car salesman but if he goes for that make she he goes with a dealership and not a used car place
myfriendwantstoknow,2j7oth,619shepard,3,Tue Oct 14 14:40:33 2014 UTC,"As part of developing his acting skills, jobs facing customers is excellent (one reason so many actors do serving, the other is flexibility of the scheduling) and builds skills. Things that might help in that department would be sales jobs (pharmaceutical rep, car sales, etc), hospitality jobs (hotel clerk, concierge) teaching (private schools, ""edutainment"" companies) and many others. While majors will help you get a job, if you can convince an interviewer that you covered relevant things (and as an actor you have developed people skills) you can still get a job ""outside"" of your major."
myfriendwantstoknow,2j7oth,Ken_Thomas,3,Tue Oct 14 19:54:24 2014 UTC,"That's going to be a problem, because 'real' jobs are going to need your friend to be there every day, and that's simply not a requirement that generally works well with the needs of a struggling actor. Your friend is going to need 3 days off on short notice to go shoot a commercial or something, and that's not going to go over very well with your friend's manager, who didn't hire him just so he could have an empty desk sitting there and shit not getting done.  I'd suggest if your friend doesn't want to go the traditional struggling actor route of waiting tables, he should probably look into commission-based sales positions. Someone else mentioned a car dealership, and that's probably not a bad place to start looking. They might be inclined to be more flexible with the scheduling, since if you aren't there selling stuff, you aren't getting paid, and the company won't have idle resources sitting around if you aren't there."
myfriendwantstoknow,2j7oth,nsgiad,1 point,Wed Oct 15 05:29:57 2014 UTC,There's a reason why most struggling actors are servers. It's honest work that can pay well and helps develop acting skills.

myfriendwantstoknow,2j7oth,doooom,7,Tue Oct 14 14:55:21 2014 UTC,"Grown up jobs are all about networking instead of applications. If you're still in school use your teachers and advisors to develop connections in your field. Try to get them to introduce you to professional contacts that they have, and if possible line up an internship. College is honestly more beneficial as a networking tool than as an educational institute for most non-STEM majors in my opinion."
myfriendwantstoknow,2j7oth,Eode11,3,Tue Oct 14 14:08:43 2014 UTC,"Your friend is right that his current positions are not ""career jobs"", but they definitely can lead to them.  Zoos are frikin' awesome places to make connections and start working towards career jobs because they need people from almost every field.  They need educators for tours/classes, biologists, manual laborers, heavy equipment operators (depending on the size of the zoo), food stand workers, community outreach specialists, IT specialists, etc...    Your friend should seriously start asking around the zoo seeing if anybody needs help with other things.  Maybe offer to volunteer for big events or weekends.  Get on a first-name basis with the right people, and you'd be surprised how often you'll get called for extra work or to help out with this or that.  Your friend wants to be an actor?  Talk to the community outreach/advertising people at the zoo about making cute or educational videos for youtube.  Don't expect to get paid a lot when you first start doing this, but as a college student it's something you could work in around your schedule and make happen.  You never know where simple little things online might lead."

myfriendwantstoknow,2j3jfd,somanyquestions2k14,48,Mon Oct 13 07:30:54 2014 UTC,"More than just the vagina has to stretch during childbirth. The cervix needs to go from a thick tube with a tiny opening to a thin ring with a large opening. The body produces hormones that relax pelvic ligaments, even the   cartilage that joins the halves of the pelvis in front. The pain also comes from uterine contractions during labor.  Recreational vaginal stretching may help the vagina itself from tearing during birth. There are also perineal massage techniques where your partner gently stretches and massages the space between the vagina and the anus to reduce the risk of tearing or episiotomy."
myfriendwantstoknow,2j3jfd,DoYouGotDa512s,12,Mon Oct 13 15:50:38 2014 UTC,"This is the correct answer. Much of the pain comes from the cervix opening and the hips being displaced. The vaginal canal, where sexual acts like costing take place, is pretty flexible and can be stretch many times its size - particularly when lubricated and aroused.  Birth, however, stretches much more. As mentioned, the only real alleviation would potentially be less tearing on the external part.  Most of the pain is before that bit - from contractions (muscle spasms, basically) and from the cervix dilating."

myfriendwantstoknow,2j1kvl,LongLiveThe_King,4,Sun Oct 12 19:02:56 2014 UTC,"Both situations were unfortunate, but the biggest difference is that the US saw the Japanese as a national security threat (potential enemy sympathizers) whereas the Nazi Germans saw Jews as vermin that needed to be exterminated (but first extracting all value from them including slave labor)  Part of the justification for Japanese internment was ""it was for their own protection"".  Some people were in a killing mood after Pearl Harbor. It also segregated them from other Non-Japanese Asians whom many americans at the time couldn't tell apart. None of this makes it right, but probably made perfect sense to those in charge at the time.   What is not so clear, is why German Americans were allowed to remain free. They were much more likely to be sympathizers, and some were. It was also much easier for them to slip away into the general population. The decision probably had much to do with the fact that people of Germanic descent were much more integrated into our society at the time and there would have been a huge backlash.   Simple answer -- the Jews were outright killed, or starved, or worked to death. The Japanese were given adequate food, medical care, etc. They were prisoners, but they were not mistreated to the degree where one could point a finger at the US Government as having a deliberate plan to kill them off."

Location is huge, as it's local municipalities that are the real issue.  It can be as easy as filing as a non-profit, getting a vendors license, and paying your taxes. What you'll be forming is technically a ""collective.""  I'd suggest reading all the text of Proposition 215 and Senate Bill 420 a few times over until you have a good understanding.   And keep an experienced (marijuana specializing) lawyer on retainer and take all his advice.   I'd advise you sit down and consult with a lawyer first. A lot of cities have put a moratorium on any new clubs and grandfathered in older ones.   Location location location. That'll dictate how hard/easy it will be, and the type of opposition you face.

""Hey I like you a lot, you're really cool, and right now I'm just looking for something casual. Does that line up with what you're looking for?""  I appreciate upfront honesty and she probably does too; I don't want a guy to tell me he likes me and wants to keep hanging out all the time if he doesn't; I also don't want someone acting like they want something more when they don't.  Generally fuck buddies, in my experience, are still friends who can hang out and NOT have sex, but just do so when they feel like they want sex, NSA. As an adult, just discuss it openly and tastefully. Good luck!"

myfriendwantstoknow,2inhwm,evilbrent,6,Fri Oct 10 01:52:12 2014 UTC,Being open is key. If your friend communicates with confidence and openness he should be fine.  Be wary that as /u/catonspeed said friends with benefits is two friends that can easily have sex or go without. A fwb relationship can be rather hard to maintain. EITHER party is likely to develop more steady relationship feelings. Distancing frequent sex & compaionship from feelings of love or things like that is not easy.  I hope your friend finds joy.

myfriendwantstoknow,2ik9q3,varlamov,3,Tue Oct 7 16:28:02 2014 UTC,"It at least sounds like acute stress disorder (basically PTSD before you hit the magic length of time that turns it into PTSD). Here's the deal, depression and PTSD have high comorbidity, aka they co-occur often. Theres some debate as to why. Some researchers believe that having depression makes it more likely that a traumatic incident will trigger PTSD. Others think that it's due simply to symptom overlap. There are other schools of thought too. That part isn't important. What is, is that when they are comorbid (when you have both) it is likely that you will have more severe symptoms and that they will last longer. Please tell your friend to seek some help from a psychologist before this gets worse. This happens A LOT to victims of random crime so tell your friend not to worry that he is ""overreacting"" or something."

Both in London but not the same uni, they lived on his campus in a studio flat.   It's hard to tell really. I think it's true that you never truly know someone until you live with them. You can say 'yeah but we spend so much time together anyway' but that doesn't count. When you're living with someone, both in university so not much room anyway, you will hardly have any time to yourself.   Now I don't know if your friend is cool with that or whether or not he's like me, where I need to spend some time on my own so I can just chill, play games, or just do my own thing for a bit. If two people live together, they will be forced into a situation where most of their waking time will be spent with each other.   I would say it's a make or break situation. If your friend can get through a year of living with his girlfriend then it would help cement the bond they share. But on the other hand, it could all go to shit. Two people in close proximity for a long period of time could begin to grind each other's gears until the point that they may have to leave their own house just to find a place to be alone.  At the end of the day, if your friend really wants to make it work and so does his girlfriend, then it will. There may be compromises from each side but those will be inconsequential in the grand scheme of their relationship.  My brother and his girlfriend lived together for a year around 2-3 years into their relationship. They've been together for coming on 7/8 years now (I can't really remember) and will most likely get married in the next couple. If it's meant to be, it's meant to be. But if it's not, then sometimes it's best to know when your ship has sailed.  Hope the advice helps your friend, OP"
myfriendwantstoknow,2if134,whitboys,9,Mon Oct 6 04:03:38 2014 UTC,"Only live with a significant other if you are ready for that step in the relationship. It is NOT the same as living with a friend/roommate. Do not move in with a significant other if your reasoning is rent/cost related. Do it because your relationship is ready for that level of commitment and you are both ready to take that next step. For your friend I would recommend not doing it right away. There is no harm in waiting, and living separately in those initial years out of high school can be beneficial. It would be better for the relationship in the long term to find their own identities before moving in together."

As far as living with an SO in college, seriously do not do it, hang out every day all you want, but living together is a serious relationship killer for every reason you can think of.

In late August (right before school started) they broke up and he had to live with this girl (and only this girl) for a full semester. I felt so bad for the dude because his house sucked and it shouldn't be like that at college. I also kinda didn't feel bad for him though because she had a reputation of sleeping around and definitely did just that right in front of him with multiple men through out the semester. Pretty much the worst case scenario I know but I know from experience it can happen. Take what I said with a grain of salt though. Every relationship is different. Just think it's a funny story

myfriendwantstoknow,2if134,Bigfrostynugs,1 point,Mon Oct 6 16:47:42 2014 UTC,"My partner and I moved in together at 19, a year and a half into our relationship. I lived in the dorms my freshman year while he finished up the A.A. he had started during high school back in our home town, three hours from my university. He got accepted to that school, and we got an apartment together the summer between my freshman and sophomore year. We have been living together a little over eight years, in five rental properties across three cities in two states.  We were very fortunate to be well matched in terms of personality and lifestyle. We are both introverted homebodies with similar wake and sleep schedules, so there was no conflict there. The biggest immediate issue was expectations regarding cleanliness. He was messier than me, so I really had to hassle him for that first year to get him to clean up after himself. Make sure you both are fairly similar in terms of lifestyle; if you aren't, are you willing to change/compromise? It will help to have an unambiguous plan for housework and chores so that issues can be identified and addressed early.  Make sure you have plenty in common in terms of recreation and leisure. When you move in with a romantic partner, the amount of time you spend together increases dramatically, so you two will need to be able to fill the hours in eachothers' company. It helps also to have mutual friends so your partner does not feel left out of your social life and vice-versa.   Have a solid financial plan going in to this. I created a conservative budget for us months ahead of time and we agreed to split all expenses equally. This might not be the system you choose, but remember that money is a MASSIVE stressor, so be very honest with and willing to listen to eachother.  Moving in together is going to be incredibly fun at first but definitely has the potential to break the relationship. Have a backup living arrangement in case things go south, but focus on communicating effectively and be willing to compromise for the sake of your mutual happiness. I really cannot stress communication and compromise enough, haha."
myfriendwantstoknow,2if134,scrote_inspector,1 point,Mon Oct 6 17:03:27 2014 UTC,"Living together is very different, in my experience, from being together and not living together, even if you already spend all your time together, because it increases the risk of feeling 'trapped'. That's not a problem while everything's sunshine and rainbows, but it can be a problem if things go to pot.  That said, I've gotten a place together with a partner after only knowing them 6 months, and we stayed together for 7 years or so. So there's no reason it has to fail: I've lived through at least one of many cases that living together cause any problems at all.  A possible bigger concern might be that moving to university and moving straight in with her boyfriend might impact on your friend's girlfriend's ability to make friends of her own, which might leave her more-dependent upon him and his social circle than would be desirable (in general, but especially if they ever break up, which is statistically-likely given their ages). If there were no other factors at play, I'd say that she should live on campus, or failing that in shared housing somewhere, just for the experience of living somewhere that isn't with her parents and also isn't with her boyfriend. I'd be advising your friend to offer a compromise: that she should spend the first year somewhere else, and after that they'll be set to talk about spending the rest of their lives living together. Easy street."
myfriendwantstoknow,2if134,avapoet,1 point,Mon Oct 6 17:54:44 2014 UTC,"It really is hard to tell. I moved in together with two different boyfriends. The issue with moving in is that leaving is VERY hard and I stayed with the first for three years longer than I should have because it was more convenient to stay. I changed a lot during the relationship and we just weren't compatible. I'm 26 now and the man I'm with now, we live together and it is a wonderful relationship. I love the time we get to see each other and we do well living together. We do have opposite schedules though and have plenty of time to ourselves. We both have lived on our own and are comfortable living on our own as well.  I have to say though, with her just coming out of high school... she should probably try to live on her own as he should as well. It is important, I think, for a person to learn how to live on their own eventually. People change and in these next few years she -will- change as a person IMMENSELY. It may be awesome for their relationship or it may be horrible. He won't know until it happens but it is probably best for both of them to grow on their own.   All in all though, this time in both of their lives is about learning and making mistakes and growing as individuals and adults. It is up to them. If they do it and it works out, awesome... if it doesn't then they learned something at least. Good luck with the situation and I hope your friend chooses the best solution for his situation!"

Generally, if you try to access a webpage that's blocked - www.bigfatbooties.org (I don't know if that's a real website or not) and you get a page that says ""You're not allowed to access this!"", it's very probable that somebody somewhere got an e-mail saying OPs Mum just tried to access bigfatbooties.org.   However, if you were able to access bigfatbooties.org and it wasn't blocked, there probably wouldn't be a notification. There are two options from here - either, they'll review web histories of all users looking for inappropriate material every couple of months or they only look into browsing history if they have a reason (e.g., suspect something dodgy).

However, if your even get a whiff that your mom has been asked about watching porn at school, you need put your brave pants on to admit to it immediately because it could raise serious issues for her if you don't; even if it's just ""I think it might have been me, I was browsing Reddit without my moms knowledge (<-- important) and clicked a link that I wasn't sure of, I'm sorry"".  Put yo' dick down, next time."

If it was at her workplace, it is very common for schools to log their network activity (although they will only save it for a limited time, my German ""high school"" saved it for about a week, i think. This is in case something happens and they need to investigate. But as that is quite uncommon, they release the disk space after some time). If it was at his home (think a laptop, who wanks off at a elementary school, hu?), it is less likely but not impossible, as their computers may use a VPN or something to route all connections through their network.  There is a tool called traceroute that can be used to check the route traffic is taking, he could use it to look if any of the IPs on the traffics way are associated with the school's network (although this might be a little to advanced for him). This would of course only work on a portable computer outside the school's network (a good example would be ""traceroute 8.8.8.8"" which shows the route from the computer to Google's DNS Server)."

myfriendwantstoknow,2icqey,cosmicsans,4,Sun Oct 5 13:44:32 2014 UTC,"Your friend probably has herpes.  Tell your friend to get a Chicken pox vaccine as soon as possible.  Chicken pox, shingles, and the herpes varietals that cause sores next to and on the lips, and on the genitals, are all strains of the same virus.  And it has been known for several years that the chicken pox vaccine will strengthen the immune system's response to flare-ups of the virus.  This is the article that relates the efficacy of the chicken pox vaccine in suppressing the herpes virus.  Whenever your friend eats a surplus of foods high in arginine, balance that with foods high in lysine, or take lysine supplements.  If that is not effective, your friend should get a prescription for a viral suppressive, such as acyclovir.   Herpes is a serious pathogen that strongly correlates to Alzheimer's if the person has the APOE-epsilon4  allele.  It is critical that the virus be suppressed in people with that allele, as it damages the nervous system and produces β-amyloid and P-tau plaques in the nerve cells that accumulate and cause the cells to die.   Herpes can be spread fairly easily, during flare-ups and for a while thereafter.  Herpes is a serious pathogen that can devastate people with defective or immature immune systems, and can even be fatal, especially to newborns."

However, if you are not sill in your early to late teens  -    Although rarer, some males exhibit no refractory period or a refractory period lasting less than 10 seconds.

Penalties for drug charges depend on the weight carried by the defendant, so it's not unheard of for cops to pump the stomachs of drug suspects.

myfriendwantstoknow,2ho8re,PM_your_TitPics,6,Sun Sep 28 04:17:11 2014 UTC,"I can't speak for any individual file, but I can give your friend some general advice about suspect files.  One effective way to check the safety of files is to open them using a virtual machine.  A virtual machine (or VM) is basically an emulation of a computer that your computer executes.  There are many tutorials online to help you set up a VM for whatever platform your friend happens to be running.  Your friend can keep a ""sandbox"" VM in which they open/examine suspect files.  Download and open the file in the VM, run a virus and malware scan in the VM and use basic functionality like the web browser to make sure everything works as expected.  If that checks out, then the file is probably safe to open/use.  If it's not?  Just delete that VM and create a new one.  No harm done.  This technique is not foolproof, but it will help you avoid a lot of infections caused by sketchy files.  Now whether your friend should be looking at said photos at all is a different matter, but one that needs to be left to your friends' individual conscience."

myfriendwantstoknow,2hkae7,mjbyrd,11,Sat Sep 27 02:08:01 2014 UTC,That's because virginity is actually kind of an abstract concept. Especially for girls and also for gay/bi guys. Sex is not just PIV.
myfriendwantstoknow,2hkae7,goqo,5,Sat Sep 27 05:19:28 2014 UTC,"if your friend is straight, he doesn't have to worry about their world."
myfriendwantstoknow,2hkae7,avapoet,5,Sat Sep 27 04:10:45 2014 UTC,"It doesn't matter.  Basing a definition of sex (and therefore, virginity) on any specific sex act is really silly. Base it on PIV sex and you're claiming that people who've only had homosexual sex are always virgins, for example: I've seen people try to make exceptional rules to work around this (e.g. oral sex counts between lesbians) but these quickly fall flat too (what about a bisexual woman who's engaged in cunnilingus and in fellatio: do only the former ""count""?).  Me? I'd say that if somebody's genitals were touched for their sexual pleasure, it's sex. It doesn't even have to be your partner(s) doing the touching: two people masturbating together is certainly sex.  If somebody asked me how many people I've had sex with (which I don't think has happened since I was a teenager, because in my experience it's not something that well-adjusted adults care about very much), then - knowing that people have very different definitions of the term - I'd say ""depending on how you count, somewhere between 6 and 10"".  In the end, people asking such things are usually trying to gauge your level of experience into some kind of quantifiable score. And you can see why they'd want to - people who masturbate tend to be better at knowing what they want in bed than people who don't; people who've had sex (of any kind) tend to know themselves better still; people who've experienced a variety of sex (which can be 'easily' achieved by having a second sexual partner) tend to have an even better idea about what turns them on. But that correlation isn't perfect, by far: there are plenty of ""virgins"" who've made great progress at understanding themselves sexually, and they're are plenty of non-""virgins"" who haven't figured themselves out yet .  A better question than ""Are you a virgin?"" and ""How many people have you had sex with?"" would be: How much sexual experience have you had? This open question lends itself to as short or long an answer as is needed - ""Just by myself... (but I'm really good at it!)"" is a perfectly reasonable answer, as is ""I've given and received manual and oral sex with men and women."" Say as much or as little as you want. And to those folks who insist on asking stupid questions, ask them to define their terms or ask better questions.  Tl;dr: It doesn't matter. Wish I could have told me that when I was 16!"
myfriendwantstoknow,2hkae7,dukeluce,2,Sat Sep 27 07:31:42 2014 UTC,i would just answer with both. some people will consider oral sex to be virginity. or you could simply ask what that person means. it also depends on why they want to know.

Dante's girlfriend has only slept with 3 guys, but she's given blow jobs to 37 different guys. Is the BJ number significant? She doesn't think it is because BJs aren't special, she saves sex for men she cares for emotionally. Dante, on the other hand, is completely skeeved by where her mouth has been, once he finds out.  Personally? I counted men and women I actually had sex with. For all intents and purposes, penetration was the defining line - until I had orgasms, and then I only started counting the individuals who could get me off.  There's a nice equalizing definition: did another individual get your rocks off? The first one got your cherry and you only count the individuals who do it for you. I think this would subsequently superficially inflate a lot of guys numbers and lower women's - but that's what society wants from us anyway. Yay! I'm a problem solver!"

It's not rare to sleep with someone that you'd consider less than attractive, even ugly and I might still have brunch with them  the next morning. And why not? You both had a good time, her appearance is pretty irrelevant by the time you wake up and she's just a regular gal like any other beneath it all. Now, if we're saying I find her repulsive for one reason or another I'd rather wake up with ""blue balls""."

Honestly I am just really worried about classes this year, and I don't want a repeat of last year, where I feel like I didn't learn anything, which is why I have been thinking about it lately and made this post.

Add/adhd is over-diagnosed, true, but at the same time its also really common and lots of adults are truly impacted by it. Both are true.  If you want, you could write down all the ways you feel like you are being impaired or being caused distress by these symptoms and bring them with you when you meet your doc, that way you have in front of you what you want them to know.

After about 30 minutes you start to come down, and you feel like doing another line. But you don't want to waste it, so you wait 15 more minutes, then do another line. Hell, make it two.

myfriendwantstoknow,2haqed,NDaveT,8,Wed Sep 24 14:43:12 2014 UTC,"I don't want to sound preachy here, but if your friend is asking he probably shouldn't dabble with it. Every person has different body chemistry so there is no definitive answer. Generally people do a line or two to start with. The problem lies in the hours following that first little bit. Its gonna feel good at first, then they will want more to keep feeling good. Not saying they will be instantly addicted, but the very nature of short lasting but intense effects will likely lead to subsequent dosing. This is where they could get into trouble. Redosing repeatedly is going to lead to a clogged up/bloody nose, headaches, insomnia, and craving (not necessarily addiction) for more. Redosing too much could mean cardiac issues in addition to aforementioned problems. The other problem is purity. Your friend may get shit that's been cut to 20-30% or may get stuff that is 80% or more pure. A first timer isn't going to be familiar enough with appearance or consistency to know what they are getting. Say its cut to start with and he does a bunch of it with no major problems. This may lead to them believing their body can handle a bunch without issue. Then next time they get some uncut high purity stuff that they can't tell the difference between. They cut up a few long lines, pull a hoover maneuver and the next thing they know they are pouring sweat with a bloody nose wondering why they are dizzy and their chest hurts. Their mind is racing 90 to nothing trying to convince themselves they are okay while their heart is pounding at 150 BPM and their ears are ringing.   Maybe this happens, most likely not, but does he really wanna find out? Sorry if it sounds like a stylized load of shit, but this kind of stuff does happen, more often that you may think. Tell your friend to really think hard and please be careful."

They would probably ask for a second sample but i would love to see the reaction on the lab techs face when they test it.
myfriendwantstoknow,2h8kjr,standardalias,1 point,Tue Sep 23 20:58:09 2014 UTC,"This might work for you so here's what you need to do. First is to get clean urine and put it in a condom. Make sure its enough to fill the test container. Strap urine filled condom to penis area, so when the temperature is tested it will be warm enough because they take the temperature so its harder to cheat. So when you need to go into to take the drug test, fill the container up with the clean condom urine and then piss away the unclean urine."

Try to make it look like you have it underneath your tongue.   This will make you drool, so try to tilt your head back. Also it only works on weed.

myfriendwantstoknow,2h8bjq,flyingboat,5,Tue Sep 23 19:00:55 2014 UTC,"Hold on, I wrote it all up to post over at /r/disability, and saved it somewhere....  Here's a list of how Bob is failing at his job:  He does not shower Sally regularly or well - once a week at best. He showers even less regularly than she does, which makes everything they own stink of his stench.  He doesn't brush her teeth or hair properly at all. Sally has to go to the salon to get her hair washed, because he won't do it.  He leaves Sally in bed all day, so she can wet the bed EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. She will lay there for hours, trying to wake him up, so she doesn't wet the bed, and he will ignore her, or spend hours 'popping his knees'.  He only takes her to go to the bathroom twice a day - once in the morning and once before bed.  She uses puppy dog training pads on her chair the rest of the day for when she goes to the bathroom. He won't do something as simple as put her in Depends or anything, because it's another trip to the bedroom with the Hoyer.   He yells at her constantly.  He withholds meals or food from her, because he is angry.  He'll leave her stranded to take her wheelchair home in northern US mountains in the winter. Her clothes are not good for this weather. At all. It was already 30 degrees out there the other day. He will not dress her in pants, because yet again, it's another trip with the Hoyer - more work for him. It's a Hoyer, not a god damn fork lift!!!! She wears t-shirts and skirts everyday. Why skirts? Because he can pull them down over her head.  He does not cook - he expects her to buy fast food, etc for every meal - for him as well, even though he gets paid by the state for being her PCA.  He doesn't pay rent or bills of any kind, and sleeps on her bedroom floor.  Their house is a shitstorm. He doesn't clean at all. Nothing. They were recently evicted from a place they stayed at for ten years, because HE ALONE caused $3,000 in damages."

myfriendwantstoknow,2h81qs,throwclone,15,Tue Sep 23 12:33:42 2014 UTC,"Depends on the employer and the position. A good friend is an IT Manager and was recently interviewing, one of the applicants had a familiar sounding company as his previous employer so my friend looked it up via Google - no results.   So he went and looked deeper and found that the employee himself had registered and started the company which actually did nothing (it was a fake company.) He called him and pushed the issue and the guy lied about it. Guess who didn't get the job?   Personally I don't list the months of my employment, just the years. That may give you enough fuzziness to where you aren't lying.   Rather than ""July 2013 - Present"" , just put ""2013 - Present"". I try not to lie on my resume since it may come back to bite you."

Me: ""Yep""  Them: ""Has /u/throwclone ever worked there?""  Me: ""Yep""  Them: ""Did he work there between March of 2013 and August of 2014?""  Me: ""Yep""  Them: ""Is he eligible for rehire?""

He fudged the dates a little bit on his last job to make it look like he was working up until this year. He ended up getting the job (I referred him) and nobody ever bothered to check the dates.  If it's a high level position in a corporation or an established company, you're more likely to see people check dates of employment by calling former employers. For smaller companies, entry-level positions, or startups, I don't think your friend has to worry about having a discrepancy in the dates of employment.  Also follow /u/TheMuffnMan's advice and tell your friend to list only the year."

myfriendwantstoknow,2h72x1,BrandonGrahamReader,16,Tue Sep 23 03:44:46 2014 UTC,"I can't answer all but I will answer the best I can, and be patient if things aren't orderly, I'm quite baked and honestly don't post long responses.   Anything to do with price, wait for someone who is closer to your location. I'm from the midwest so prices are a tid-bit inflated, and I'm not for sure on what's best price range for you.   But here's what I can help with. If you're starting off, two people, just get 1 gram each. it is a very nice starting point for someone who is new.  as for the gear, a glass bowl or a glass one-hitter (3-4 inches long skinny thing if you were wondering) is a great standby, cheap, discrete, perfect for a new guy. it has one place you put bud in, one place you smoke from, just like you were lighting a cigarette. A bowl is fairly simple, three holes. A mouth hole, percolator (hole on the side, or front, depending on the bowl) and the hole on the bottom of the little dip in which you will place your lovely buds. place buds in, finger over perc, light, let smoke build up buy sucking in slowly, then release your finger from the perc, inhale, and most likely cough. for your first session, i recommend a nice house, somewhere safe,somewhere you know, and somewhere you're prepared to spend a good number of hours in / fall asleep with your hand in a bowl of cheetos haha. Throw on a movie or two, or music, (i preferred music for my first times.) As far as the car thing is concerned. Please do not. You're a new smoker, you don't know your limits, your tolerance, your reaction, just don't. eventually as you mature in your... smoke..-hood.. you will learn what your limits are, what you can do when you're baked, what you can't do, etc. when it comes to carrying it on you, depending on your local and state laws, its iffy. i'm from a state that doesn't take kindly to that kind of thing in a car so I avoid it when I can.   Now for the smell, you're gonna get a good sack sometime and think of my comment after I say this : you're will have a bag of good good bud that will smell like cat piss. Simple as that. you have to be mindful, especially if you're in a non-420 friendly area. your two best friends - Ozium and gum. Ozium will take out the smell of some stank out of your room/car in a heart beat. 2 sprays in your car, let it air out for 2 min, you're perfect. few sprays in a room, not a thing is left behind. its my standby. gum is pretty self-explanatory, smell cover and cottonmouth help.   if you're going to purchase out of the legal system, be safe. I'm not saying carry a gun, I'm saying bring only the cash you know you're gonna need if its a new, unfamiliar dealer. bring something light you can protect yourself with, a small knife or even a lighter inside of a fist does a little bit more damage. common sense things to make sure your well-being is protected. not everyone is out to get you, its just nice to be prepared. don't make it known you're ready to do work if things go south, just be natural and always prepare. stay alert, stay smart, and always be cool and calm.   and the last thing I saw in your post was about blunts. YouTube it. it takes practice to roll a blunt, but its my favorite. it burns through weed quicker than a bowl or hitter but it's badass and just all around outstanding. simply grab some fist fulls of cheap cigars, watch a few videos on different techniques, and just split and roll a bunch with the same tabacco to get the hang of it. and yes, if you rolled it right, it will pull just like a cigarette, word to Bronson.  and some things I feel a new smoker should know.   Its all about mindset when sparking up. If you think you're gonna have a shitty time, you just may. When you sit down to smoke, clear your head and just relax.  you're gonna cough. its okay, I've been smoking for many a years and I still cough like hell on a good hit, its alright. you aren't a pussy. I promise. make sure you got groceries the night before. you're gonna be hungry. and thirsty. man i'm thirsty as hell right now.  internet is awesome. explore things, get high and listen to music you haven't listen to for like 5 years. watch old movies you forgot about. read articles. browse reddit but be careful. you thought it was hard to lose track of time on there sober. ha.    if you have any questions or need clarification or want different sites, songs, activities, etc when you smoke, feel free to pm and ask. best of luck, young one. many great adventures lie ahead."

You could perhaps talk to the instructor, mention you have prior interest in the topic, and ask if you can build off of your previous work.  In this manner you could tweak it, add a few paragraphs, and still be in the clear to get out of most of the work."
myfriendwantstoknow,2gvi44,hellowiththepudding,20,Fri Sep 19 17:46:40 2014 UTC,"This is the correct response. Talk to your instructor about it, use the phrase ""build off my previous work"". He will probably say yes, professors love that kind of shit. Remember to turn in a good paper though, not some amateur bullshit."
myfriendwantstoknow,2gvi44,theroyalalastor,7,Sat Sep 20 01:17:57 2014 UTC,"I've done this before and didn't have any problems, but I would check what your specific college considers plagiarism and what else it may say about it. Personally, I think it isn't really plagiarism if it is your own work and online dictionaires agree with me.

Very rarely the jackpot is large enough that the odds have work out where it's actually profitable for an investment bank to try to buy all of the tickets to guarantee that they get a share of the jackpot (in the linked article it was ~5 million $1 tickets for a shot at $27 million).  This is exceedingly rare, though.  In almost every case it is more profitable on average to not play at all.    The lottery is not a way to make money; it's a very basic form of entertainment.  You will not make money off of the lottery any more than you will make money by going to the movies."

He was at the park smoking weed when an officer discovered him and his friend. We called our parents and they came and picked us up. A brief talk with the officers and I was done. I just went home and continued on with my life.They said it could be any amount of time before I got a call. Today, he received a call and was requested to meet with an officer tomorrow. He's very confused on what the fuck is actually happening. His friend never got drug tested, he simply went to a drug class, passed a test, payed his fine and that was it."
myfriendwantstoknow,2gtxx8,CelticJoe,6,Fri Sep 19 04:58:49 2014 UTC,"Assuming you're in the U.S. Though specifics vary dramatically by state, probation is a sentence. Cops can't order it on their own, so your friends case had to have been presented to a judge or arbitrator at some point. Constitutionally, they can't do that without notification and the opportunity for representation,  So either your friend or their parent would have received some kind of notice at some point, or some information on the ticket itself."
myfriendwantstoknow,2gtxx8,taa421,2,Fri Sep 19 08:39:52 2014 UTC,"Most likely not.  Drug testing is usually done by a 3rd party lab. This might depend on whether or not the law enforcement branch (Federal > State > Local) has a contract with said lab.  You usually have to agree to a contract to be legally required (forced) to take a drug test.   In the end, it doesn't matter because you'll find out.   STOP SMOKING NOW.   Ask and get a definite answer from the officer when you'll be released from probation. That is the best thing you can do.

myfriendwantstoknow,2gkoqi,bblemonade,4,Wed Sep 17 02:58:34 2014 UTC,"Coconut oil really should come with a huge warning, so I'll provide it. Coconut oil is highly comedogenic for many people.

Also, if coconut oil isn't someone's thing, they can try mineral oil (baby oil, unscented) to start with as a good beginners' oil, but yes, good call, always be sure to patch test!  I would like to add that sometimes that increase in acne is temporary and then goes away.

The eggs, larvae, pupae and adults of certain insect species have been eaten by man since prehistoric times and continue to be an item of the human nutrition in modern times.  While insects are eaten by many animals, the term ""entomophagy"" is generally used to refer to human consumption of insects; non-human animals that eat insects are known as insectivores.

myfriendwantstoknow,2gdtcv,doooom,3,Mon Sep 15 14:29:16 2014 UTC,"From the Ebay help page:   Contact the company you made the payment through to see if you can cancel or dispute the payment.  If you paid by wire transfer, you can contact Western Union at 1-800-325-6000 or MoneyGram at 1-800-926-9400. Generally, if you paid by wire transfer and you don't receive the item, there's no buyer protection and the chances of getting your money back is low.  We recommend contacting local authorities, both where you live and where the seller lives. Let the officers know that eBay is happy to cooperate in the investigation. The officer should contact us at stopfraud@ebay.com. To find local law enforcement agents, visit the USACops website.   It depends when your friend bought the item. If it's been a reasonable amount of time to receive the item, he can go here and open an unpaid item dispute. Ebay should resolve the problem in a few days.  If the auction ended recently and he paid within the last few days, he could have better luck by contacting Paypal. Sellers with low feedback and few transactions usually have a hold placed on all incoming payments for up to 3 weeks for these exact situations."

Now, take that zip file and start cramming gig after gig of data Into it. Viruses, word docs, games, whatever and make that file massive. The zip file is then compressed and shrinks it all down with special code. This means it can be sent and seems like a small file. But when someone opens it on their end, say, through an email, their computer will open the zip and be overloaded with too many gigs. So many that it overloads and will either shut itself off to save itself, or break something within the computer. It is dangerous and real."

Also, since you are planning something tame (as opposed to offering something illegal or unsavory), the chance of anyone with any authority actually getting involved is low.

Sometimes you don't get over that feeling that you've been walked over. Sometimes you still feel like a bitch even though you are acting completely right and they are completely wrong. It is a very shitty feeling but you just have to recognize that those feelings you are having are temporary. What you can do is find solace in the fact that by not stooping to their level, you win and they lose. They did not drag you down to their level of pettiness.   And you say there are no repercussions but there are, they no longer can count on you, if they continue this behavior eventually they will find that they can rely on no one. Eventually they will find themselves alone and unloved unless they change their behavior and you will find that you can better devote your time to the people who actually care about you, and believe me people will recognize that you are a good person and will want you to be a part of their life if you act like a good person.  Even if you don't recognize any of that right away, just keep acting as the better person, keep advocating others act as the better person. Because if you are going to change the world and make it a better place you have to start with yourself, and you know what even if it is just you, you have accomplished that feat of making the world just that much better.

myfriendwantstoknow,2ga25b,PlopKitties,3,Sat Sep 13 10:15:59 2014 UTC,Most are accurate...and the cut off for metabolites of marijuana in the urine for at home tests are around 50ng/ml.

myfriendwantstoknow,2ga25b,Leeda165,1 point,Sat Sep 13 13:22:37 2014 UTC,"Huh, I'm assuming drug tests given by work places vary with the amount of metabolites in them?"
myfriendwantstoknow,2ga25b,Leeda165,4,Sat Sep 13 13:32:53 2014 UTC,"Those tests are more accurate because usually they are processed at a lab with gc/ms(gas chromatography mass spectroscopy).  This formal testing gives the full breakdown of the urine including metabolites and to a much smaller degree of concentration.  The at home tests are accurate in their purpose.  Like I said if you have more than 50ng/ml of marijuana metabolites in your urine it will show up and its even harder to fool a lab test as they also measure for vitamin and amino acids, specific gravity of urine and water content to differentiate watered down urine or water with food coloring.   The lab test is a full spectrum(every drug basically).  While at home tests can be only one drug(1 panel) to 10 or more panels(panel = test strip for individual drug metabolite)."
myfriendwantstoknow,2ga25b,Leeda165,6,Sat Sep 13 13:45:10 2014 UTC,But youre right they are different in the concentrations that are the cutoff(cutoff= for example if its 50ng/ml lol it means it you have less than 50ng/ml then you wil pass and if more then it will show positive for marijuana) they have much different tests though so the test from a lab(which most employers choose to use is much more accurate)

She's fine, so long as nothing hurts, nothing's rubbing and getting injured, and it hasn't changed quickly and radically in size, which might indicate disease. Vulvas range hugely in appearance. Apparently about half of women have labia minora that protrude out of the labia majora when they're sitting or standing. Most are not symmetrical or pink. Diagrams like the one you linked make the vulva look very tidy, small and compact, but those are drastic oversimplifications.  Why is that the image? Most people blame porn, though I think diagrams like that don't help. Here's a nice site about the appearance of labia minora, which includes a photo gallery.  Your friend is also not alone in thinking her vulva looks weird. It's common enough that plastic surgeons will reduce and standardize your labia minora, though this might damage you. You also can (or could) buy labia dye. Lots of people are willing to encourage women to feel their labia are weird so as to make money off them.  There's also Photoshop. There was a hilarious article about Australian soft-core pornographers who said they had to Photoshop labia to not protrude beyond the labia majora, because if you could readily see female genitalia in a normal photo, the censors would call that ""genital emphasis"" and say it was X-rated. In that article, they interview a censor who fails to explain what the porn rules generally say about noticeable labia. (The censor also doesn't think people get most of their ideas about vaginal appearance from porn.)  Again, tell your friend not to worry unless something hurts or there's been a rapid change in size — in other words, the normal things that indicate disease."

This was an issue for me once, and it can be bad for the girls ego, and we would go longer than she was comfortable sometimes because she was working hard.   It took a while(2weeks), but when it started happening regularly, I just explained that I was really into it, and it was just really great sex. She started getting really excited, and it made sex really fun for us.   I still fap once a week or so, because it lets me last really long while still being able to finish.

Want to know why you feel awkward flailing your arms? It's because you're standing there, self conscious, wondering whether you're doing it right. Dancing is instinctual, a primal thing, that just comes out of us. You have to let go and give in to the idea that you might look funny. The more confident you are the less you'll look strange.  What sort of party are we talking about? At house parties you can usually get away with dancing however you want (if you commit to it) because people will assume you're just really drunk. Option 2 is to just actually get really drunk.  Ever taken MDMA? You'll never dance the same way again."

It's very easy to get bad pills (filled with stuff that is NOT the business) and almost impossible to find pure MDMA. If you're buying from a dealer, they will always tell you it's 'really good' and will never tell you it's filled with meth. Please keep that in mind. Also keep drinking out of this equation as it's very, very easy to do that wrong as well."

myfriendwantstoknow,2g03ub,klubsanwich,8,Wed Sep 10 20:07:37 2014 UTC,"I've given this advice before. Take some time on a regular basis, when you can be alone, to pick some music that you like (and has a good beat) and practice dancing in front of a mirror. Go through and focus on moving each part of your body for a while- hands, wrists, head, shoulders, arms, upper back, hips, legs, knees, feet, eyes. Play around with moving fast, slow, big movements and small. Imagine you are the sexiest person in the whole world and dance like that. Imagine you are the very worst dancer in the whole world and dance like that. Etc. Practice, play, get more experience of dancing.   You could also search for guy dancing videos or tutorials on youtube, and see what you like and want to imitate.   Or, you could take a dance class. Hip hop, salsa, or contact, for example."

If you must, put your thumbs in your pocket with your hands out. Move your hips to the music instead of your arms. Hump the air if you must, dont hump people unless they are smiling at you for a very long time. Know when you are in the spotlight, and let it consume you. Also know when you are to hot and when to give someone else the spotlight. You both should watch and learn every single move from this video. Last but not least its about your crew. When one of your friends is busting a move/making a fool of themselves, as long as they are not being a douche, socially support them busting out creativity by giving them your eyes and open your face in surprise. Other people will see your curiosity and it will spark curiosity in them causing them to look with the preconceived notion that something cool is taking place. This in turn causes others to look, the more friends you have in on it the better. Make sure not to last to long in the limelight, for it is a comfortable heat but it does burn. Take turns busting out, always supporting each other. If an outsider wants in on the action, always give them a go whenever they are ready. Never stifle publicly expressed creativity. You will always encounter others that will hate, it is telltale sign of immaturity, do not let what children say or how they act upset you."

myfriendwantstoknow,2fvwkn,john_lennons_regret,21,Tue Sep 9 06:43:31 2014 UTC,"Holy cow, it's like you made a post just so I could make an entry in my reddit history/ personal diary.  TL;DR, He does, call the justice department from out of state, a burner cell, or a pay phone and make it quick.  So three days ago I'm trying to get some shuteye on the porch of what used to be my property. I have to keep turning over and over because honestly it was hard to decide which was the lesser of two evils: to put a jacket over my head when it was still 86 degrees out, or trying to shut out the screaming my neighbors friend and his girl were doing across the street.   If you never knew, getting sleep while homeless is kind of sparse in the first place. The few hours of actual quiet you get in the bilge of the city are cut short by a fresh coat of sunburn on your face that eventually makes it eligible to be crafted into one of the finest purses ever made. Couple that with an overeager police force playing whack-a-mole with your ribs until you move along, and having no realistic mode of transportation out of there, you have a few problems.   In the end, there are few forces that will convince an ex-con who found morality to commit a B&E and risk a felony charge, but wouldn't you know it, a screaming woman combined with unspeakable back pain and shoes that would only meet their definition in the most forensic of senses did it.   I had a basic hope of not being interrupted, but right after I found a place to lie down after barring the doors tight was a scream across the street. I had figured the meth cook across the way was giving a customer a tune up, but you never know.   I wake up to the unmistakable sound of a low flying helicopter. It's light out, and I grab my bag and ready myself to beat feet. Out the back, I look out over the tin overhang to see what's going on. Just then I hear a garbled message from the squawk box in the sky. I realize it's most definitely circling my house, it was very, very low.   I bolt out the front fast as my legs will take me, I make it to the curb before I make out what the megaphone is saying. First and foremost I understood ""We see you, you're not going anywhere, sit down on the curb, officers will be with you soon.""  I knew this day was coming. Or thought there was a good chance. You might wonder at this point how a guy in this position is making a Reddit post from an electric-outlet-not-included cell in county lockup. Well, I can't sneak a smartphone up my cheeks, and I didn't have a supercar standing by to outrun a black and white whirlybird.   In any case, I couldn't have made it much of anywhere, so I just sat down on the curb. Minute passes and a guy comes out of the house across the way. He looks at the helicopter and parks himself on the curb, just looking up at it.   I get confused, so I go up to talk to the guy, he stands up cause we can't hear each other, and I hear the megaphone blast ""YOU! White shirt, blue jeans, sit down on the sidewalk!"" Well, he had described me, so I went back over and sat. But I thought he might have described the other guy too, so I waited till the guy a few stories up said something else and then yelled over to the man opposite me ""I think they said to go over there!"" and pointed to the corner. He got up, and got shouted at, and I felt hope for the first time. My heart skipped a few beats but slowed a couple of tics.   Time pressed on, and I started sweating. Forget the weather, I mean a lot of time passed. Ten minutes in, maybe more, and no one showed up. just the same circling screaming helicopter. I offered the guy a smoke, which he took, and I flat ignored the insisting remarks from the steel bird. Talking to him for a while, he said his name was buck, he knew it was for him, he knew what it was about, and he was ready. I dug into my bag and grabbed a water bottle, which he thanked me and took. I guess no matter what he'd done, I figured it was bad, and this was going to be the last time someone would have the opportunity to treat him human, and I know I'd have appreciated it if it were me.  I did something then so stupid or so smart it still stifles my cognitive dissection. I took out my phone and dialed the one number it would connect to.  ""911 emergency.""  I told them I was a neighbor, I was sitting with the guy, no one was coming, and maybe I should talk to the guy in charge of the mess. Got put on hold, transferred, on hold again, then operator, I think pilot, and sheriff rep were all on the same line. One of them was really, really mad, I think it was the rep. Anyway, I told them his name, told then they didn't have to come in blazing, he was down and didn't have any weapons. I said other stuff but it was boring, I pretended to be somebody else.   Anyway, end of the story is they finally showed up, he got put in cuffs faster than I've ever seen, and I got a slew of Q&A, where I pretended to be my neighbor. At the end of all this, it turned out he slapped his GF allegedly on the lawn, and that had been the scream the night before. She had gone back to Folsom the next day, called a cop buddy and told him her side of the story, and the cop made the call and they sent out the whirlybird.  For a slap in the face. That nobody had seen. Just strikes me as odd, is all. I'm purely against violence, but I've been knocked around plenty, and asked for help more then a few times too. No one ever sent out a Sheriff helicopter for me.   Anyway, they hauled him off and I lied through my teeth, and badly, convincing the four responding squads that I was of no interest.   I walked to the lawn of the guy I knew that I was pretending to be, and thanked my lucky stars he didn't come out of his house right then and ask what the hell I was doing.  They finally left, and I got to live another day.  The moral of the story is that they sent out a helicopter and four squads to take down a ""domestic abuser"" a so-called ""violent man"" caused he slapped someone who called a cop she knew. If there is any, any chance in Utah that police would dare believe your friend's ex, it's already in motion. It's a much harsher state do screw up in, or so I've heard.   Anyway, if you've read this far, thanks for listening, and best of luck."

Regardless, it's not going to make her sick or anything (at least, not any more than drinking a lot of tequila normally would).  Beers and wines will go bad, but in general, distilled alcohols don't go bad if they're closed.  The worst that tends to happen is the flavor won't be as strong or nuanced.

(Irish creme).  Contrary to popular belief most wines shouldn't age more than 5 years, your cupboard is not a 50 degree cellar and your 4 dollar bottle of wine is not Chateau Lafite (and even that is said to be 300 years past when it was best),   But i've never had a problem with 5 plus year old wine. If the wine tastes or smells bad, don't drink it. Air could have leaked, and it can become infected\turned. Never undervalue the strength of your own built in chemical detector.

myfriendwantstoknow,2frue0,mcnewbie,8,Mon Sep 8 04:35:44 2014 UTC,"Trim it with a trimmer then go into the shower. Use a razor while the water is running over your bits. It sounds crazy, but it works amazingly well."
myfriendwantstoknow,2frue0,cursh14,7,Mon Sep 8 03:35:57 2014 UTC,This is true. I find using conditioner around that area helps smoothen it as well for when you are using the razor.
myfriendwantstoknow,2frue0,throrlrolrol,3,Mon Sep 8 06:01:28 2014 UTC,"I have been doing this about every other day for many years now. I do it towards the end of my shower routine when the skin and hairs have had plenty of time to moisturize, and it doesn't take more than minute. I put on a bit of lotion once I am done showering, and I have never had any major problems with itching, red dots or anything like that. Everything feels smooth and awesome for what equals less than five minutes a week."
myfriendwantstoknow,2frue0,Panteloons,2,Mon Sep 8 10:12:32 2014 UTC,This is how women shave their legs.
myfriendwantstoknow,2frue0,Nowhere_Man_Forever,2,Mon Sep 8 22:26:57 2014 UTC,Maybe some women. My wife definitely uses shaving cream when she shaves her legs in the shower.
myfriendwantstoknow,2frue0,cursh14,3,Mon Sep 8 23:05:02 2014 UTC,"It really depends on what your friend wants. I trim sometimes. I've used scissors before, but lately, I've been using an electric hair trimmer (one I set aside only for this purpose). I like to keep a little bit of length though. If your friend just wants to trim down, and he doesn't want to go out and buy a trimmer, he can use scissors as long as he's careful."
myfriendwantstoknow,2frue0,CalmSpider,3,Mon Sep 8 06:16:25 2014 UTC,"Yes, if I can add to this - I personally use a device called the Phillips Norelco Bodygroom. Not the ones that cost $100 - I believe I paid about half that price and still got very good quality. I would say that trimming on its own has worked well for me, but I was looking for something more like hair management than a very smooth shave."
myfriendwantstoknow,2frue0,derTag,2,Mon Sep 8 04:01:33 2014 UTC,"Those are amazing!   I paid $40 for one a long time ago. It ended up breaking after years of use. I got a different trimmer, but I miss that thing. Also, they changed the Design now; However, it's still really solid"
myfriendwantstoknow,2frue0,xSGAx,2,Mon Sep 8 14:49:22 2014 UTC,"Depends on your friend mate. Personally I use a razor (dry shave) and go the same direction it grows. My best mate uses an electric razor, and most of my other pals just trim. Down to preference at the end of the day though. Just tell your bud to take it slow and pay attention to how it feels and it'll be cake."
myfriendwantstoknow,2frue0,LonelySuicide,1 point,Mon Sep 8 09:24:40 2014 UTC,"Would also recommend trimming, almost exclusively. I rarely use a razor at all, except for a little fine tuning. Benefits of trimming vs. a razor include not looking like a little boy, not having to worry about razor burn or ingrown hairs, and there's a margin of error which is nice to have when handling sharp objects around your junk. Additionally, I can tell you that no girl wants to feel your cock stubble scraping and stabbing her labia.  Personally, I really like the Norelco QT4014. Don't spring for the shittier and more expensive models. They don't have titanium blades and there are not as many length settings and they're also not as precise. I usually do a 2.5-3."
myfriendwantstoknow,2frue0,Mister_Squishy,1 point,Mon Sep 8 17:15:13 2014 UTC,"My recommendation:  don't shave.  Trim or wax.  Stubble is unpleasant for your partner during deep penetration.  Leave just enough to be cushiony, or go whole hog and wax.  Then, do yourself a favor and get yourself some Balls Balm.  This is way better than putting a razor down by your balls, and it'll do a much more thorough job.  Gets rid of the stray hairs that can get tugged during manual stimulation."

myfriendwantstoknow,2frue0,jtj-H,-15,Mon Sep 8 05:27:08 2014 UTC,shaving your pubes entirely is not very common and very hard to pull off well. it grows back immediately and you will likely get ingrown hairs which look like shit. and it itches like a bastard. i advise to get some wahl hair clippers and buzz it down low so it lays flat and slick looking like a quarter inch or even shorter if you want and just shave the shaft. the shaft and balls are easy to shave the skin is different.

I never saw spooge or masturbators, but I did find porn mags up there.  I'm not suggesting that because that's nasty.

I find it inconceivable that this country, which loathes its government more than almost anything but cable outages, would ever permit an actual draft to happen.

I'd recommend hitting up the videos that TOOOL (The Open Organization of Lockpickers) has on YouTube.  They also sell basic lockpick sets (but most filing cabinets can be picked with homemade picks created out of, e.g., paperclips).  Your friend should be aware of the legality of possessing picks in their jurisdiction.  The general jist is, your friend should have an L-shaped piece that they can use to put a slight amount of torque on on the plug, and then a slim tool they can use to push up the pins in the upper part of the lock. Push the pins up in sequence moving back and forth.  Don't push them up too far or your friend risks oversetting them.  Your friend should keep in mind two rules:  1.) Never pick a lock you don't own.  2.) Never pick a lock you rely on for your daily life."

If you want an actual key your friend has some options as well:  If the face of the lock has a alphanumeric code on it there's a good chance that can be translated to an actual key. Take a picture of the code and bring it to a brick and mortar locksmith. He or she should be able to translate it and make you a key without entering your friend's home.  You can also remove the cylinder itself and bring it to said locksmith.  My favorite way involves a pair of vise grips, a file, and a key blank that will fit the lock (like a B1). You can use torque to leave impression marks on a key and eventually file a key from scratch! It's not exactly for beginners, but it's a great party trick."

myfriendwantstoknow,2fi5cl,IndigoNothing,21,Thu Sep 4 23:50:37 2014 UTC,"Ah, I remember doing exactly this in high school. 5 hours is plenty of time to be back by dinner. Make sure you do it with friends who have experience, but you probably won't get high the first time b/c your inhale skills don't exist yet.   10/g is a good price depending on where you are located. On the east coast that's a good deal, but on the west coast you could probably find it cheaper. Don't give the guy the money until you see the bag."
myfriendwantstoknow,2fi5cl,Firebert010,8,Fri Sep 5 00:07:29 2014 UTC,"$10/g is a good deal, especially for first time buying. On the East Coast average is $10-$20/g for good weed. $10/g or under for ""mids"" or ""reg"" aka shitty weed."
myfriendwantstoknow,2fi5cl,PurpleLotus,2,Fri Sep 5 03:33:17 2014 UTC,"I was going to say, midwest is $15 to $25 a g, or $20 or so a dub for 'reg'. I need to move out to the west coast haha"
myfriendwantstoknow,2fi5cl,PurpleLotus,16,Fri Sep 5 05:29:30 2014 UTC,"Any red eye relief drops should help, although your eyes might not even get red. Weed smoke does not stick to clothes, furniture, walls, etc like tobacco smoke does. 10 minutes to an hour and you're unsmellable, especially outside where the smoke blows right away and doesn't linger.  I posted a comment about price on the other guys' comment.  If it is good weed, take 1-2 hits and hold it in (like the other comment said about how to actually smoke, it's spot on) then wait 15-20 minutes before smoking any more. If it's shitty weed, take several hits then wait.  If it's available, use a pipe (bowl) or try to make your own with metal parts. Joints/blunts are fun and all, but they use about 5-10x as much weed for the same high.   You will cough. Don't fight it.   Bring music, water/soda, snacks if you want to.   If you get too high, remind yourself that it's just a chemical in your body making you feel that way, it will end, it's just a matter of time.   Take it for what it is, some people enjoy it, some people don't. I didn't get high the first time I tried it, but I did the second time. After that, smoking on my own, I didn't get high because I still wasn't inhaling right, but luckily a friend eventually corrected me.  Make sure you use it for recreation and not to cure depression/anxiety because that will just make it worse in the long run.  Everything being said, enjoy! You're a lucky duck, I wish I could experience my first time smoking again :)  Edit: damn that's a lot longer than I meant it to be"
myfriendwantstoknow,2fi5cl,bilouac,3,Fri Sep 5 03:48:12 2014 UTC,Dont make a pipe out of metal thats how grandpa got the lockjaw
myfriendwantstoknow,2fi5cl,PurpleLotus,3,Fri Sep 5 06:12:12 2014 UTC,"That's not true. Metal is perfectly safe to smoke out of, preferably stainless steel. It's still up for debate whether or not aluminium will give you Alzheimer's. I think it's just a myth that started when people read that people with Alzheimer's have elevated aluminium levels. Just because they have high aluminium doesn't mean the aluminium caused it. I've smoked my share of aluminium before I could buy glass, but still occasionally use it as the bowl for gravity bongs.  A glass pipe tastes much better, will give you better hits, and is undoubtedly safe. You can buy a very shitty one for $5-$10 or a decent one for ~$20"
myfriendwantstoknow,2fi5cl,a_person_like_you,9,Fri Sep 5 06:34:25 2014 UTC,"Exhale any air out of  your lungs completely. Put your lips to the piece, light the weed, and begin to inhale like you normally would with pure air. Keep inhaling until your lungs are nearly completely filled with smoke, pull your lips away from the piece (or remove the stem from the bong, your finger from the carb, etc.), and fill that last one-second-worth of space up in your lungs with clean air. This is to ensure that the smoke is being pushed all the way into your lungs instead of staying in your mouth/throat. Hold the hit for around five seconds, then exhale."

myfriendwantstoknow,2fi5cl,CalmSpider,9,Fri Sep 5 03:47:41 2014 UTC,"There's some great advice in this thread so far. I'll add:   You cannot die from smoking too much weed. Never happens.    So if you start getting panicky and thinking you had too much, just remember that it can't kill you. Of course, that's pretty unlikely to come up in the first place."
myfriendwantstoknow,2fi5cl,TeenDrinks,8,Fri Sep 5 05:30:00 2014 UTC,"Some additional advice, it's not a good idea to do it your first time without drinks of some kind around, especially if you're in a forest (no water tap). If you take a big hit without being used to it you'll be coughing like crazy and water will help a lot. Alcohol is not the best for this, plus being drunk the first time will dull the high a lot (or it did for me at least). Also snacks should be a given, you're not doing it right if you don't have some chips or fast food.  Don't be in a rush to finish it. It should be relaxing, if you've got a couple joints or whatever space them out. Give your lungs a bit to recover, take some deep breaths and see how you feel before jumping into the next one. You may find passing around one or two was enough and you can then save the rest for later or what have you.  Have fun haha it's always a good time with some friends in nature."

Without a lawyer is a little complicated, mostly just in making sure you have all the right forms and followed the correct procedures (been about 20 years so may be a lot easier now with internet sources). You have to make sure everything is correct or the judge will make you start over.  With a lawyer, I just picked one out of the back of a local paper, that advertised as a divorce lawyer.

This is pretty tricky stuff so you should discuss this with RIV and Canadian Customs Officials to make sure you know exactly what you will pay.  Here are the different fees and taxes you may face:   Canadian Registrar of Imported Vehicle Fee. This run around $200. If the vehicle identification number (VIN) starts with a number 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, then it was made in North America and there is no duty under NAFTA. Otherwise you will pay a duty of about 6.1% . Goods and Services Tax (GST) – 5% . Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) for your particular province. If you are entering a border crossing in Quebec you will pay the Quebec Services Tax (QST). If your vehicle has air conditioning there will be an excise tax of around $100. Gas Guzzler or Green Levy Tax –  If your car is manufactured after March 19th 2007 and consumes 13 litres or more per 100 km it will may be subject to an excise tax of $1,000 to $4,000.   To find out the fuel consumption rating on your prospective vehicle check the Natural Resources Canada’s website. .

myfriendwantstoknow,2f5m6g,Forum85,3,Fri Sep 5 11:40:30 2014 UTC,"I'd change ""Taxes 2012"" to something more textile arts related.  If you were after things like social security numbers and whatnot, peoples' tax folders tend to have that and everything else, especially in the US, when you consider all the stuff that has to be sent to the govt.  Another trick you can do, to the passwords themselves.   First think of a 3 character string that you can remember, but no one could guess, for example, if you're wearing a blue shirt today, then character 1 is ""b""  For the second, your shoe size - rounded up if you're a half, so if you wear 6 and a half, then 7.  The 3rd can be any alt character you like that's commonly accepted, like $ or &  So we've got ""b7$"" - that's all you have to remember.  Now go through and change all your passwords to end or begin with that string, those 3 characters, in that order.  When you make your list of passwords, don't put that string - it's stored only in your head.  So if your Reddit password is dangdutnutb7$, on your list it just says Reddit - dangdutnute  The ""e"" means the secret string is on the end. If the password is b7$dangdutnut, on your list it will say Reddit - dangdutnutb  The ""b"" means beginning. You could also use ""s"" for start and ""f"" for finish (or equivalent in any language or combo).  With this method, even if someone gets a hold of your password list, AND knows all about the trick, the list won't do them a bit of good because they don't have that secret 3 character text string.  Which, depending on your memory skills, could be a 5 character text string for all they know, and if all they wanted to do was brute force a handful of passwords, it's not likely they'd spend all that energy gaining access to a file that supposedly had them all typed out for their convenience..."

Make the folder on your desktop  Windows key + R  type CMD  press enter  type cd desktop  enter  type attrib +h ""the name of your folder""  Boom folder is gone  Then if you need to access it, run through those command but use attrib -h ""nameoffolder"" instead and just run through the commands.  This won't work if you have windows set to show hidden shit. By default, windows doesn't show this and people shouldn't really go looking for this in particular. if you want you can make the folder in your user directory instead of the desktop, just forget about the cd desktop command,   so it's easier to just go and put it in C:\users\opisfaggot\folderforpasswords"

They appear on the genitals and/or in the mouth. They appear as small, painless, raised, pale, red or white spots or bumps 1 to 3 mm in diameter that may appear on the scrotum, shaft of the penis or on the labia, as well as the inner surface (retromolar mucosa) and vermilion border of the lips of the face. They are not associated with any disease or illness, nor are they infectious but rather they represent a natural occurrence on the body. No treatment is therefore required, unless the individual has cosmetic concerns. Persons with this condition sometimes consult with a dermatologist because they are worried they may have a sexually transmitted disease (especially genital warts) or some form of cancer.

I'm not sure how long it has been there, but if it's not painful or itching that's even better. It should go away on its own, but I would recommend hydrocortisone cream to apply on there 2-3 times a day. it's a mild steroid that will aid in your immune response to the bump.

Depending on specifics, this could be treading on the same ground that got Aaron Swartz in hot water with the feds.  That being said, tactics for scraping sites depend on the specifics of the site.  Small-volume, well-monitored sites might flag as suspicious anything more than a couple page loads in a few minute period.  Larger sites might have automated systems in place that heuristically look for unusual traffic.  (Regularly timed, continuous traffic will almost certainly get caught by these filters.)  If your friend's going to go ahead with this, they should consider using a cloud computing service and spread the traffic out across a few different instances in different regions to ensure the traffic comes from a variety of source IPs.  Double check that instances are using different source IPs and not being funneled through the same network egress.  Additionally, add random backoff to the scraping code.  Go slow, slower than you think necessary.  In general ask yourself, ""if I was an avid user of this site, what's the absolute most I would access it in a day"" and then don't go over that limit.  If your bots don't look at least somewhat like people, then a smart site owner is going to catch you almost immediately.  Also, don't DDOS the site. This is bad for everyone.  It's bad for your friend because it puts them at greater risk for discovery and potentially increases legal penalties. It's bad for the site owner since it brings their site offline, etc.  So go slow and if at any time your friend gets any inclination that you're encountering degraded QoS from the site, throttle the bots way down.  IANAL and all, but this could be legally perilous.  Your friend should think very carefully about contacting the site owner for a downloadable archive of the content.  If the content truly is public domain, it's possible the site owner will happily oblige, since it will save them tons of unnecessary traffic on their site from scraping bots.  In short: be aware of the risks, don't be a dick, and definitely ask the site owner first before you start hammering them with traffic to scrape their content."

For example, I always get hungry around 11pm, and so around 12pm before I go to bed, I go to the bathroom."

I would advise him to work on the anxiety so he can dispose his bodily fluids in another human being rather than his old pyjamas.

myfriendwantstoknow,2ev402,YukiHyou,3,Thu Aug 28 23:25:37 2014 UTC,"As for concealing the bag of tissues, that's what he thinks he's going to do, because he's certainly very good at concealing things. He's got a plan for how he's gonna do it and everything. He's very confident in this plan.   Also he'd like to thank you for your nice comment which made an anxious fella feel pretty good about himself. He is working on the anxiety and it's getting better gradually."

Being stubborn about unusual health symptoms can cause serious problems. Far less people would have serious complications if they were willing to see the doctor ASAP instead of putting it off.

About the selfies and all. Ignoring him is your friends' safest bet. If your friend isn't comfortable in doing that (considering she nods and says ""mhm"" to anything he says), stray off the question. As in ""Hey, is that a selfie"" your friend should say something like ""I'm so hungry I can eat an elephant now"" and get up and go check what's in the fridge. Don't take anything out if you don't want to, just stare in the fridge for a couple of seconds and go back. Next time, say you need to go to the bathroom.

If he's an introvert, he may not have had many occasions to relate to someone for an extended period of time. Now that someone is around, he may be going a little crazy with it. If she's only been there a short time, he may eventually ease off these extended conversations and revert to a less intrusive presence.   If he's an extrovert then this behavior will continue and she will need to set boundaries. If he doesn't accept them, she may have to consider moving.  If either case, she just needs to talk to him about it. This type of conversation will be helpful to both of them. He may not be aware he does this a/or that it bothers other people.

myfriendwantstoknow,2egrwt,xSnuggleBear,21,Sun Aug 24 19:29:48 2014 UTC,"Do you mean buying a completely fake college degree, or buying one from like one of those bullshit online universities?  Like University of Phoenix?  If you mean the first one -  Places like Harvard, Yale, Stanford and other prestigious law/medical schools have books where they publish the names of Alumni, and there is a whole life that goes along with having a degree from a place like that.  You would have your dissertation published and be in at least a few published peer-reviewed journals.  What I mean is, if you truly had graduated from an Ivy League school there would be a long trail of stuff that would follow you, and an employer would probably notice that that trail didn't exist.  If you just bought a fake Bachelors degree or something, chances are really good that as long as you can do well at an interview and you do your job correctly, no one is going to notice.  Most employers aren't going to do a ton of checking up on a degree if it seems like you know your stuff.  (They are more likely to focus on background or credit checks.)  So, the higher the fake degree, the more chance of getting caught.  If you were trying to get a job in IT and you faked a degree from a small state school or a community college, I doubt you'd get discovered.  But if you are trying to work at a law firm or get in the medical field, there are so many things that you would be missing if you only had a degree, you'd need to be registered with state boards, pass special exams (like the State Bar, etc) and you'd have more to show than just a piece of paper.  If you mean the second one -  Don't even bother, employers know those places are just bullshit diploma mills and you'll be wasting money. Any decent company is going to at least google the school you supposedly attended, and the first thing that comes up in Google results is ""scam"" kind of stuff."

You also have to consider that a pedestrian is no different than any other vehicle on the road in regard to right of way. When it's theirs, it's theirs completely. Thus, proceeding while they're still in the street is like jumping the gun on a light change just because it looks clear."
