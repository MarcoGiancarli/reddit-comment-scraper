So we arrived at this garden of eden, where 90% of people had just died of diseases that never existed before contact and we saw these amazing horticultural landscapes that had been crafted for generations. From that huge body of cultural history and cultivation we took maize, beans and squash and basically forgot or ignored everything else. Everything that grows easily without fussiness or inputs we ignored and for the most part treated as weeds. Much of what was there, like the native chestnut, were killed like the first nations by diseases we brought over.   Dunno, there's just something missing from that perspective that doesn't resonate with me and how i understand settler culture and the history of the bioregion i live in.

The same goes for absentee land ownership. If you own a fallow parcel of land far far away and a group of farmers move in to cultivate it, there's no police force around to enforce your private property rights.

There is a revolving door of staff members that seemingly bounce back and forth between biotech/pharmaceutical giants and public office. Would they not have their on again/off again employer's best interest at heart?  Rules are made that make it illegal to expose or punish corporations thereby granting them immunity from the law. Look into the Monsanto Protection Act or the recently passed TPP.  Our prison system is ran by for-profit corporations that actually profit from each person incarcerated. We've officially reached more prisoner per capita than that of Stalinist Russia's gulags.

While we were erecting machines and factories they were dealing with Stalin and his aftermath; Russia simply never had such an expansive infrastructure and it never developed into one (again, probably due to anti-capitalist notions).  edit: The really iconic example of Cuba growing a lot of their own (organic) food is indicative of this too.

I have two reasons:   It's very clear that they have to force plants to grow in unnatural environments (like massive fields of a single type a plant spanning a ridiculous number of acres). Things like gallons and gallons of pesticides and importing 'mobile' bee hives for minimal pollination probably prove this. Further, the most famous SCOTUS law-suit pertaining to GMO's is Bowman v. Monsanto; in this Monsanto created a GMO that could withstand herbicide usage NOT for drought-resistance or whatevver. GMO's are being created to monocrop easier and to kill less crops from the poison we dump on them. We are genetically modifying crops because of human-industrial pressures; not environmental pressures. GMO's have, above all else, has served primarily as a means to decimate the established small farmer to be replaced by Mega-Ag (once again, Monsanto). This is SUPER obvious in SCOTUS case Bowman v. Monsanto -- Bowman bought seeds from Monsanto one year, was able to harvest some seeds from that crop for the next year, Monsanto sued him for theft because he should be forced to buy more seeds (according to Industrial Ag/SCOTUS). Bowman was forced to foreclose his farm because of this. And Bowman's story isn't just an isolated incident. Monsanto has taken to court, and won, against plethoras of small farmers forcing them to shut down their farms. This is only allowed because of GMO's.   So, as you can see, the idea that GMO's are for ""environmental pressures"" is a very myopic portion of the conversation. GMO's are to prop up capitalist industrial ag infrastructure by allowing them to continue to grow crops the awful way that we are (and we're all aware how bad that is on this sub, I'm sure), and continue to expand it by killing the few small farms that still exist.  There is a reason why the average age of US farmers is 50+ and why only 1% of the population claim their occupation to be 'Farmer'.

Permaculture,3dxyqf,kyorsmuckers,2,Mon Jul 20 13:23:52 2015 UTC,If i recall correctly Fukuoka would cut the clover down and direct seed into that. What you are seeding has to be faster than the regeneration growth rate of the clover for this to work though.   Stale seed bedding or sheet mulching works well. You usually want to sheet mulch for a year so now would be the time to start on that if you are in the north. Stale seed bedding (cultivating and then covering with a tarp to smother the germinated weed seeds) is a shorter turn around so you could easily start that and have a winter crop.
Permaculture,3dxyqf,Erinaceous,3,Mon Jul 20 13:48:27 2015 UTC,If it's established clover - that won't work. Your seed plants won't be able to grow faster than clover. You are better off sheet mulching where you want to plant and planting there. Where are you? What's your climate or USDA zone?

I have had success direct seeding cole crops, squashes and tall crops into dutch white clover.  Squash loves flopping onto a clover bed, though the clover will slow the emergence and running of the squash plants compared to traditional methods, but seeding squash into clover is great for old seed that takes longer to germinate since the cover crop helps keep the soil moist.    I have observed also that tomato seed from compost has succeeded over the clover. Tomatoes normally must be started indoors in this region so that is remarkable that these would be nearly as productive as my starts. Crops requiring clover management (hand pulling leaves, weeding, or cultivating) would be potato, shorter leafy greens, onion family generally, beans.  Sunchokes and broadcast parsnip seed had very little trouble also.  I think the cool season plants generally have a better go of it since the clover starts growing rather early.  I also have a bed of asparagus covered with clover between the rows.  I would say this succeeds for established plants but seedlings have trouble reaching above the unmowed clover.  However, I have yet to determine if this actually is a problem for them or if the asparagus seedlings can handle moderate clover shading."

If you understand how permaculture works, you understand systems management. If you learn how people can live for months aboard tiny sailboats on the ocean, you can gain a lot of insights into how a closed system can be optimized. If you understand closed systems, you can maximize the efficiency of your garden and home. Treating your land and home like a semi-closed system leads to a mindset of buying worthwhile goods and maintaining them, cutting out waste, and relying as little as possible on outside resources. Treating the planet like the closed system that it is results in a healthier lifestyle and less pollution.  In short: the more you know, the less you need."

It was pretty well-designed, on a hillside by a stream so he could manage irrigation, but everything was done by him and his kids with no farm animals or machinery. Although he did have metal farm implements.  From what I saw, I'd guess that farming by hand using ancient tools was so inefficient that you were only able to produce a small amount above a subsistence level, to support your priest/warrior/etc. class. I don't think it would take too much of a disruption for you to suddenly not be able to feed a large portion of your society. Once that happens, either war breaks out or society just dissolves into a bunch of little nothing villages.  However, I guess they must have been great at permaculture and getting a lot out of their land, because in my opinion the more astonishing part of Mayan history is not that the society collapsed, but that it developed enough to have written language, astronomy, masonry, etc. without ever even having a farm animal to pull a plow."

From what I remember, I agree they definitely understood a lot of what we put under the umbrella of permaculture but still didn't understand soil well enough to make their society sustainable. I think I remember they collapsed for a variety of reasons, but wasn't soil loss one of them?     More info on their collapse from wiki article: During the 9th century AD, the central Maya region suffered major political collapse, marked by the abandonment of cities, the ending of dynasties and a northward shift in activity.[52] No universally accepted theory explains this collapse, but it is likely to have resulted from a combination of causes, including endemic internecine warfare, overpopulation resulting in severe environmental degradation, and drought.[69] During this period, known as the Terminal Classic, the northern cities of Chichen Itza and Uxmal show increased activity.[52] Major cities in the northern Yucatán Peninsula continued to be inhabited long after the cities of the southern lowlands ceased to raise monuments.[70]  Classic Maya social organisation was based upon the ritual authority of the ruler, rather than central control of trade and food distribution. This model of rulership was poorly structured to respond to changes, with the ruler's freedom of action being limited to traditional responses. The rulers reacted in their culturally-bound manner, by intensifying such activities as construction, ritual, and warfare. This was counterproductive and only served to exacerbate systemic problems.[71]"

Take your existing clearings and drop a few trees (outward) to make them bigger, and leave the logs as nurse logs.    Look at what sort of understory and clearing trees are native to your area.  There are a couple of prunus, nuts and berry bushes that would be more than happy there without clearcutting."
Permaculture,3dhroe,Cocohomlogy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:07:20 2015 UTC,"Disturbance can be a powerful force for good.  This is a monoculture, which would take hundreds of years to regenerate into a natural forest on its own.  You can accelerate ecological succession by clearing, and the planting a much more diverse landscape.  Even just clearing and letting it grow whatever it will would be ecologically beneficial.  Personally, I would recommend getting a forestry mulcher to turn most of the trees into a thick mulch layer.  Wait a few years for the mulch to decompose, keep it bush hogged, and then start planting your food forest.    The Earth will benefit from this."

That article is talking about the first type of geothermal.  In North America, ""geothermal"" for HVAC usually refers to the second.  Also, I didn't read the article, but from the abstract:   The target population was inhabitants of communities located on bedrock younger than 3.3 million years, utilizing hot-water supply generated from geothermal wells since 1972. The two reference populations were inhabitants of communities without this hot-water supply located on areas with less volcanic/geothermal activity, and bedrock older than 3.3 million years.   The target population lived in an area with more volcanic activity than the reference populations, which must have contributed to cancer rates.

Permaculture,3dg7sl,iteotwawkiaiff,2,Fri Jul 17 02:20:32 2015 UTC,"Now about that ""lot of cash"" part...   Well, if you have your own well you can install an ""open loop"" system. SE PA means your groundwater temp should be about 52 degrees. That should yield a very nice coefficient of performance for only about $10-20k installed, plus the cost of ductwork.  At that water temperature, even homeboy AC is possible. Run that well water through a copper spiral in front of a fan and add a drip pan. BAM instant air conditioner. Of course there are pre-built solutions available -- the relevant search terms are ""fan coil"" and ""hydronic cooler"".  Earth tubes are another good low-energy cooling option. It's just long buried tube[s] through which air is drawn into the house. The air cools to the ground temperature -- 52 degrees in your case -- and condenses out moisture. Care must be taken to design against mold, by including adequate slope and drainage. http://www.builditsolar.com/Projects/Cooling/EarthtubeNotes.htm http://www.homepower.com/articles/home-efficiency/design-construction/ask-experts-earth-tube-questions  These can work well when combined with a solar chimney. Despite the fancy name, it can be as simple as a 10' black vertical stovepipe with a rain cap and guy wires for wind. When the sun shines on the house, the air inside the tube heats up and rises. This draws air through the earth tube and automatically begins cooling/ventilating the house. They can also look like/double as passive solar collectors. http://www.solarinnovations.com/solar-energy-products/solar-chimney/  Bill Mollison talks about all this (and a lot more) in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jxd6eCmbuW8 Highly recommended."
Permaculture,3dg7sl,uhoreg,2,Thu Jul 16 03:46:53 2015 UTC,"There are two types of things that are referred to as geothermal, so it may be a bit confusing.  One of them is using the heat from deep within the earth directly as a source of heat.  For this, you either need to drill very deep, or you need to be sitting in the right spot.  The second is basically just a heat pump/air conditioner that uses the ground rather than the air to move heat to/from.  For this type, you just need enough ground that you can lay pipes in to be able to transfer enough heat.  As for the ""lots of cash"", it depends on where you live, and what options you have for laying pipe.  Where I live, we don't have enough horizontal ground space, so we need a vertical loop (basically dig a very deep hole and drop your pipe down), so a geothermal system for us would be in the tens of thousands of dollars range.  If you have enough horizontal ground space, it would be a bit cheaper.  If you have a big enough pond that you can sink the pipes into instead of digging dirt, it would be even cheaper still."

Permaculture,3d307w,vagrantfoul,6,Mon Jul 13 05:11:31 2015 UTC,"I live on a tropical coast with incredible rainy seasons and design my swales accordingly, so this advice does not serve everyone.  My excavation mounds are not water retaining dams. The water holding capacity of the swale is determined by depth and width of the trench, not height of the mound. The ""trench"" is sloped from the water source side toward the mound; shallow source declining to deepest point at the mound. My mounds are much wider than they are tall, sort of wide raised gardens to make use of the collected water and minimize evaporation.   I put no excavation soil at the two ends of the trench to dam the trench. I do not just quit digging and deadend the trench ends. I taper off the ends so that outflow begins when the main trench is 2/3s full. If the inflow of very heavy rains is faster than the ends can drain, I widen the trench ends to create spillways.  Spillways are planted with leguminous alfalfa, which field trials have shown to be 500%+ more effective at erosion control than soybeans and 300%+ more effective than pasture grasses. In commercial haying, alfalfa roots are  typically 2-3 meters deep and a planting will last 3 to 4 years. But when alfalfa is less frequently cut (allowed to flower between harvests), the roots grow to 15 meters with a life cycle of 20+ years. Deeper roots mean a higher mineral content of harvested alfalfa. Being rich in nitrogen, the havest makes a wonderful natural fertilizer - composts very fast or can be used as chop and drop.  At the lower end of spillways I plant clump bamboo. (I would never recommend casual planting of fast spreading runner/rhizome bamboo that can be horribly invasive if not conscientiously contained.) Bamboo is self mulching and has a dense network of shallow, soil-holding roots. The culms allow water to filter thru while trapping solids."

Flow spreaders (gently sloping grassed banks) leading into the swaile area could do this - it seems you have a fair bit of land available.

It involves use of topographical maps to determine where water falls and then flows to on the topography. You can do a basic one on a map with arrows pointing down the topography, but one of the above specialists will have modelling software that can account for various scenarios and can calculate concentrated flow volume and intensity predictions. From this, a suitable drainage, recharge and ESC system can be designed. I'd say that because you have concentrated flows from other properties plus new roadworks nearby, you may benefit from engineering surveying data for your area too.

Btw bamboo also would do the job.   Source: grew up near a river and bamboo is amazing against violent flood events, it doesn't only stop erosion, it builds up soil everytime, by blocking everything that goes through it: sand, soil, mulch, wood.

Make sure you save the delicious trees. If you cut down the not so good trees and let them resprout then graft from the good trees onto the bad ones you will have all good trees in less than three years. Plant spineless opuntia ellisiana it is a cold hardy edible vegetable nopal that makes a great forage during drought and other times.  The biggest mistake people make in your region is overstocking. Only grow microlivestock with very controlled system like chicken tractors or cut and carry system.  Bringing in animal feed for small livestock will improve the soil fertility. The dry areas in texas are already naturally fertile. Usually they appear to the untrained eye as being infertile but that is just because they are water limited. If you can spare the expense i would purchase native grass seeds specifically for south texas from a company like pogue agri or dk seeds. These native grasses will bring in all sorts of birds and other critters. I recommend figs and jujube trees. Alma and celeste are good fig cultivars for texas. If you have a water source check the E.C. of the water to determine the dissolved solids in it that can lead to salt build up un the soil. Its a big problem people dont learn about until its too late often times.

Permaculture,3cva0j,threat42,4,Sat Jul 11 01:45:55 2015 UTC,"I cannot speak on this design, but I work in a lab researching AD and algae. The AD systems are very finicky. They die for no reason even if everything is going well. The rule of thumb when starting any study is do it in quadruplicate because one on average will always die for no reason, and that seems to be true. Our lab runs small scale batch studies and have bench top scale (~8L) continuous and two stage reactor systems. We have a few 500 gallon reactors, but it becomes increasingly more difficult to have them work. They make gas, but not very well compared to the bench systems.   It's not impossible to run these systems continuously, but it takes serious monitoring equipment to prevent sudden crashes. You need to know the feed rate, the hydraulic retention time,  COD input vs COD removal, as well the volatile fatty acid content. The last will be indicated by somewhat by pH, but it isn't perfect. Mostly because of one huge factor which is NH3+/NH4 accumulation. Which throws off the pH system and just murders the reactor if the feed isn't right.   Lastly once you have all the things running and it isn't dying you need to clean you gas, which is first bubbling it through water, easy. You probably wont have a good enough system to fully extract the CO2 but removing the H2S is important if you want to burn it without covering everything in thick grime soot and clogging up every engine ever. After cleaning hopefully you just want to burn it, because if you want to compress it to run anything super useful then you need a lot of heavy equipment and a massive storage area/bladder system.   One super useful thing is the anaerobic system effluent. They show it in your source video, but that liquid coming out of a digested reactor system is the most amazing source of nutrition for gardens. Everything is so digested it's amazingly accessible to plants.  What is your intention though? Just running a simple cook stove or something complex?  If it's simple like a cookstove then I could send you a small manual on Indian AD systems. They have been doing AD for a thousand or so years. We have a manual that describes in design detail how some rural communities have these dirty gas generators below their kitchens where they throw all scraps and refuse. Over the course of the day it digests just enough gas to run a small kitchen stove to cook dinner and heat some water. It's dirty as hell, and the H2S is none too healthy, but overall it's pretty amazing.   If you have any questions I would be happy to try and answer them to the best of my abilities. I also have a few PhDs I could ask if there is any complicated question."
Permaculture,3cva0j,Umbrius,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:34:56 2015 UTC,"Lots of good info here, thanks for sharing! So do you think we'll ever see a residential biogas system that produces clean gas and is reliable? Or are there just too many variables for the average person to want to deal with, and we'd be better off with a more centralized neighborhood, or city size AD system that full time engineers could monitor and maintain?"
Permaculture,3cva0j,mrtorrence,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:43:53 2015 UTC,"Maybe? It's hard to say ever given that some future technology might just make this perfect. The issue is that most single houses won't really produce a consistent enough feedstock to even warrant the amount of gas released.  In terms of large scale yes, and that is already being done. I recently visited a modern landfill and they had over 300 wells dug on their very beautiful grassy hillside of a capped landfill. They continuously get around 1800 cubic feet of biogas every minute. They use that to power generators which they pump into the grid, as well they have an advanced compression system on site where they fill the garbage collection vehicles off compressed purified biogas.   As well several large farms around the country (and my universities swine farm) have AD reactors on site for digesting excrement and using the biogas to heat and on some scales power the facility.   If you know you are going to have on hand 1000 lbs of poop/food/farm scrap every day/week/month then if you spend the right money on the right equipment, AD could seriously be a valuable addition. On the home scale it is really hard. Most people just don't output consistent waste. Some nights and some seasons I have bags of stuff to carry to my compost. Some nights I have nothing but coffee grounds and eggshells. It would be hard to maintain a complex balanced system on such an irregular and unbalanced (sugars/fats/protein) input.   Someone else said it in this thread, but I think if there was some advanced septic systems with a thorough food waste disposall in the sink  that would be perfect for homes. I don't think we will get anywhere beyond nightly cooking gas, but I do like knowing the ins and outs of a system like this for the concept of cooking with gas separated from the world.   Edit- I would say that it could be useful to have an AD system not to store gas, but to produce a concentrated fertilizer in a smaller space. The systems are air tight, so they are bug tight. They don't smell great but you can get some serious heavy nutrition in a very accessible form. Free methane isn't great for the environment, but no reactor is going to ever beat the production of a regular cow."
Permaculture,3cva0j,Umbrius,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:08:43 2015 UTC,Do you know of Jean Pain's work by chance? He put the AD containers inside piles of compost and had water coils running through the piles as well to heat his house through radiators. He managed to get a consistent supply of feedstock by working as a brushwood clearer for the forestry service in his country to prevent fire.   What do you think might be some other sources of lots of waste organic material that would be good for AD?
Permaculture,3cva0j,mrtorrence,3,Sun Jul 19 23:10:02 2015 UTC,"I would love to build something like this system, but listening to everybody I've ever met over many years who have actually implemented biogas digesters, the take-away has been uniformly the same: Bigger is better. Even more so if you live in a place that experiences real Winters (not like me, then.) The key thing is that digesters generate their own heat which favours the bacterial growth. Too small a volume, and you get too little heat, and consequently too slow a decomposition to generate reasonable quantities of gas.  I have concluded that biogas plants are best implemented as a village-scale infrastructure. I'd love to be proven wrong... my current septic-tank system is in need of some maintenance, and the timing would be perfect for replacing it with a biogas digester."

Sounds like a great idea, but if you you have very little or no experience with anaerobic digesters, you don't want your first one to be responsible for such an integral function in your life. Not to mention, human waste can carry bacteria and viruses for which we are highly suceptible much more readily than other animal/plant wastes.   I toyed with building an AD. I read several books on the subject and would recommend The Complete Biogas Handbook by David House. The website makes the book look a bit unprofessional, but I think he self-publishes. Everything he writes in the book is well cited and I was able to follow the citations back to the source material if I had a desire for a more complete picture of a given study or paper. All-in-all, it is an incredibly thorough manual for AD design and use.  In the end, I decided against building my own until I have some land and many hours to mess with it. Instead, I've decided to invest my time and efforts into more reliable and less finicky means of green energy production. Namely, passive drainback solar collectors for hot water and space heating. I suppose it all depends on what your goals are though."

Why haven't people designed these systems to feed their waste products back into the systems, I.e, biogas burner keeping a well insulated bio-reactor heated in cold climates, carbonic acid from gas purification used in removal of silicate buildup on burners, low volatility oils from wood distillation used to heat the gasifier, etcetera?

I fully support humanure and realizing its value but it is not for the masses. We either have to improve our current system or create a new toilet tech for large scale use with central collection (no user involvement past dropping the load)  Also, while septic does have downsides (cost, maintenance, etc) I don't agree its a definite source of pollution (if it is designed and installed properly). Wastewater that permeates through a certain distance of soil effectively becomes cleaned and rendered suitable for re-entry into nature. If you dump chemicals in your septic (as some people do) then that's a different matter."
Permaculture,3cublr,bikemandan,5,Sat Jul 11 05:02:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think that on a larger scale it will probably be biogas digestion at central sewage plants that will get the job done. With garborators you could simply route all organic waste through one system to save on trucking. If heavy metals and other contaminants prove to be a barrier then the biogas fertilizer can be used for growing hemp or cotton or other industrial fibres. Digestion also means.no methane escapes.   This video was more to get people to take another look at how shit is dealt with and what kinds of resources we are passing up. Instead of capturing these nutrients they are causing algal blooms in our waterways. In Victoria BC, the largish provincial capital I live just a few hours from, they just dump all of their sewage into the ocean. The town I live in composts its sewage sludge which is a start, though it does release more greenhouse gasses and require more management than anaerobic digestion."

I recently had a great success when the city issued me a citation for what was assumed to be a messy yard, and in many respects actually was, however, my garden was hiding underneath.  The ordeal made the local paper, I handled my end of the process such that many locals now understand the process of working organic material back into a garden food production system through composting and edible fungus production as a ""tool provided by god for our use"".

Permaculture,3cqvvf,flavor8,5,Fri Jul 10 01:25:36 2015 UTC,I would have thought that 4 full barrels would create more pressure at the spigot... maybe need an air vent at the top of a barrel?
Permaculture,3cqvvf,rasta28,9,Fri Jul 10 01:29:53 2015 UTC,"TL;DR - It's not the number of barrels, but the height of the water above the spigot that determines pressure. The internal vent tubes should be all it needs.  Hydrostatic pressure at any given point is determined by the depth of the water above that point, and not by the surface area of the water. For example, the water pressure 1 foot below the surface in a bathtub is the same as the water pressure 1 foot below the surface of a lake. It's the depth, not the size of the body of water that matters. In this system, regardless of the number of barrels, the  the spigot would be at the same depth so the pressure would be the same.  No doubt you noticed that he added the extra piece of pipe inside each barrel - this ensures that air won't be trapped in the top of the barrel when it's filling, nor a vacuum from being formed when it's emptying. You're right that a vent at the top would do the same thing,  but since there are 4 vent tubes (one in each barrel) and only one spigot, there should be plenty of air pressure equalization without adding vents.  edit: take a look here for a clearer and much more thorough explanation of hydraulic pressure."

It's the depth, not the size of the body of water that matters.   So by extension, there is no limit to the number of barrels that this could fill, given that the intake isn't pressurized? E.g. the back pressure from 100 barrels each 2/3rds full would be equal to the back pressure from 2 barrels each 2/3rds full?"
Permaculture,3cqvvf,sugarpig,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:34:15 2015 UTC,"That's correct. The pressure at the spigot would remain the same as long as all the barrels were at the same level.  I think it's also interesting to note that the depth of the barrels in his system would always be the same - if one is 2/3rds full, all of them would be. And the depth of the water in the downspout would also be the same as it is in the barrels."

(Unless you had a siphon, which would require priming every time the barrels emptied)  That hole is a potential point of leakage.  The best part is that the threads on the factory plugs in the barrel happened to be standard pipe threads, so a nicely sealed pipe fit is possible versus having to seal a hole you cut yourself on the bottom/side of the barrel."

I suppose Idaho is quite hot in the summer, but typically summer greenhouses are oriented with large sides to the east and west so that plants don't get fried in the noonday sun.  A winter greenhouse is best oriented south to maximise the heat and light.    I am interested in knowing more about your situation :)"
Permaculture,3crubs,davenpuerto,2,Fri Jul 10 17:00:47 2015 UTC,"Hi there,  The heat is not a problem, it is the bloody wind. You may not have felt it in Barcelona but we have what they call the Mestral howling down for three or four days at a time. This blasts everything, and they can arrive anytime from September, and can be as late as May. This last April/May we had 5 days of wind which made all sweetcorn horizontal, completely destroyed one bed of zucchini an tomato plant seedlings (it looked as though nothing had ever been planted there). I would like to protect our plants from this - and also have a place to store bushes and small trees  that are not totally hardy in the winter.  It would also allow me to get tomato/pepper/aubergine seedlings away much earlier, and lengthen the season.  I will also put shade over it in the summer that it does not fry everything, and then I can grow the tender greens without them being during July and August - currently not possible.  So far the plan is a 2 metre deep square pit,probably 3m x 4m,  with the earth placed on the North-West side (direction of wind) and alternate transparent  /metal sheets anchored down on a slope as the roof, and open at both sides to allow heat to escape in the summer.  The earth bank will planted up with climbers and trees to afford shade in the summer as well.  Would be interested for any input you feel relevant."

This underwater system, while cool and interesting, does not integrate with the natural world - divers carrying oxygen tanks set up large underwater plastic(!) shells, need to dive down every time something needs to be taken care of, and requires constant maintenance.  It does not take cues from nature, it's not integrated with it's environment, not (human scale) permanent by any means, does not catch and store energy, has a yield so small it might as well be a monoculture, I'm sure it produces waste, it segregates rather than integrates, and is non-renewable.

Earth Ships are basically solar-aligned wattle and daub structures built according to the slope with locally available materials, insulated by the earth.  I don't like that the process is conveyed as if it is an invention.  Its obvious and logical and people have been building structures like this for millenia.

Permaculture,3coct0,Nikolasv,2,Thu Jul 9 16:43:51 2015 UTC,"I actually almost attended Earthship Biotectureship's Earthship Academy but didn't after searching more after I found a deleted post on their webforum by Marcus Lewitzki complaining about all the Earthships they built in Northern Europe that failed because of very, embarrassing amateur mistakes like not insulating the ground in wet, damp England. All simply because there is no one design fits every need and region as they portray at Earthship Biotecture.   This page documents the failures of Earthships in Europe: http://earthshipeurope.org/index.php/earthships/performance?showall=1&limitstart=  Proving my point after relentlessly searching for past members posting their experiences, I found that they all were very idealistic people like myself, with no background in construction or related fields. Further, earthships often take advantage of naive volunteer labor to help the labor intensive task of pounding dirt to the tires, and often the well off people whose homes are being built, don't even offer the volunteers meals. I even decided to lose my $400 deposit to attend the Earthship Academy.  Later I found an episode of the permaculture podcast with Bob Theis ( http://www.bobtheis.net/ ) an architect and natural builder most famous for his work with straw bale. The host specifically asked what he thought about Eartshships: http://www.thepermaculturepodcast.com/2013/bob-theis-2/  Some of his major points of critique of earthships: 1) Back in the 1970s when he(Theis) was first building they thought they needed much more thermal mass for passive heating and cooling. Now they know the real key is a well sealed and insulated ""envelope"" and if you have that you don't need much thermal mass. 2) Dirt actually has poor insulating properties compared to many other natural building materials. 3) It is tedious and too labor intensive. You get volunteers excited initially and you lose them because they get bored of the deathly slow pace of banging dirt into tires. Eventually you loose any goodwill and the volunteers wash out.  This guy Theis sounds like he knows what he is talking about and updates his knowledge, while Michael Reynolds is more about marketing himself and Earthship Biotecture when his company's solutions don't work that good, it is too labor intensive and it is not well suited for regions outside of the American Southwest.  That short documentary seem like a redux of the misleading Garbage Warrior which is little more than an advertising vehicle for Earthship Biotecture, modified to cater even more to peak oil, collapist audiences."

Permaculture,3cdoo8,thalasar,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:33:11 2015 UTC,probably on Amazon
Permaculture,3cdoo8,velacreations,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:28:57 2015 UTC,"Well thanks for the info. I had no idea. Should I delete the post?  [Edit] Whoa, what is up with your account? 2 years old and this is your only comment? I must have really hit a nerve. I am sorry."
Permaculture,3cdoo8,Baumbadil,2,Fri Jul 10 02:14:11 2015 UTC,I dont think skywheels cogent opinions should be deleted along with the whole post. We should just post better pdf files that cover season extension with greenhouses.
Permaculture,3cdoo8,skywheel,2,Fri Jul 10 03:06:52 2015 UTC,"Indeed the book is probably good.  I just forgot that rich soil was Paul's site and was annoyed when I got the email to confirm.  I love free books, essays, pamphlets, and infographics, and if it was someone ELSE's spam list I would have gladely partook, at least until I got annoyed in a couple weeks...    Thankyou Baumbadil for giving me the benefit of the doubt, its rare on here, in general...    So for a book that I loved that directly addresses season extension, see the book:  Earth Sheltered Solar Greenhouse Book: How to Build an Energy Free Year-Round Greenhouse, by Mike Oehler.  He lives in Idaho.  I haven't seen the book in years, but he could grow salad greens in the winter in Idaho by I think facing the long side south and digging the greenhouse into a slope (to the north), if I remembered correctly.  There, now I have commented several times ;p"

Permaculture,3cdoo8,Baumbadil,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:36:45 2015 UTC,Thanks for the book recommendation. I'm in Anchorage so maybe an Idaho mountain grower can give me some pertinent info.
Permaculture,3cdoo8,skywheel,2,Sat Jul 11 02:56:07 2015 UTC,"Dearest redditor.  I treasure this subreddit in part because of the pdfs that become available.  I was delighted at your post and my response was nothing personal.  To you that is...  Indeed I had forgotten about the account and only remembered I had it because someone else tried to reset my password so I got the email, only yesterday, reminding me that it existed.  I had been trying in vain to remember another password.    Oh, and I've totally posted something unnecessary before that I felt like deleting, so I know the feeling.  Asked to find a plant name of a promising medicine when the plant name was mentioned in the article... No worries.  We are nicer here, most of the time, right?  Please, don't be discouraged...  I will probably be more active with this account and look forward to receiving your posts and encourage you to share :)"

Permaculture,3cdoo8,howtospeak,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:28:24 2015 UTC,"Ok, I had given you a very sweet and encouraging reply, but I find this offensive.  If this is your response to a logical long-winded comment and heartfelt reply please think about how you may be received next time, for the next person, not me, I don't give many shits what you think any longer.   Many newbs are discouraged into being simply lurkers because of this sort of reaction.  I am not new, as I explained, but I shouldn't need to.  What sort of robot writes like this anywayz?  Oh, and I looked at YOUR comment history, and you seem to have a catty reactionary attitude..."
Permaculture,3cdoo8,velacreations,5,Fri Jul 10 06:48:22 2015 UTC,oh ok heres my email...
Permaculture,3cdoo8,clangs92,4,Tue Jul 7 06:08:55 2015 UTC,"no big deal, they just want to spam you every day."
Permaculture,3cdoo8,velacreations,-2,Tue Jul 7 14:18:20 2015 UTC,what do you count as spam? cool permaculture happenings and information? hmm.
Permaculture,3cdoo8,clangs92,2,Tue Jul 7 16:57:15 2015 UTC,or constant self promotion and selling
Permaculture,3cdoo8,Stagnant_Life,-2,Tue Jul 7 17:06:06 2015 UTC,fair enough. i think it's balanced with not way too much of that though.

Permaculture,3cdoo8,tryh10,2,Wed Jul 8 05:26:58 2015 UTC,this is the most useful comment I've seen all week!  You win the internet!
Permaculture,3cdoo8,Spitinthacoola,-4,Fri Jul 10 18:33:25 2015 UTC,It's not that big a deal.  Every couple of days you get an email with interesting stuff on the forums.  You can unsubscribe if you don't like it

Permaculture,3cdoo8,velacreations,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:31:52 2015 UTC,Did anyone get this? Is it good?
Permaculture,3cdoo8,thalasar,2,Tue Jul 7 16:59:55 2015 UTC,"looking at it right now, it's decent, though none of it is revolutionary and everything I've seen so far is widely available for free throughout the internet. It's basically the 1st world walipini greenhouse.  That being said, it is a good ebook."
Permaculture,3cdoo8,velacreations,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:07:45 2015 UTC,I subscribed but sadly no confirmation link and no download. Can someone post it up?
Permaculture,3cdoo8,thalasar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:22:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's a good idea, would most likely violate the owner's copyright."
Permaculture,3cdoo8,velacreations,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:32:31 2015 UTC,Well it's too bad really. I wanted to read. So I joined the list. But I got nothing. Somehow I think I am still going to get the daily email from Paul Wheaton though.
Permaculture,3cdoo8,thalasar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:35:09 2015 UTC,maybe try a different email.
Permaculture,3cdoo8,velacreations,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:46:18 2015 UTC,"Or maybe when someone advertises a ""free ebook"" it should be free instead of ""trade your email address for it."" I traded my email address but didn't get the book. It's this sort of thing that leaves a bad taste in my mouth about certain people in permaculture."
Permaculture,3cdoo8,Baumbadil,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:29:56 2015 UTC,I totally agree.
Permaculture,3cdoo8,Greencheeksfarmer,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:36:38 2015 UTC,Is it possible to link to the file? Any recommendations on better sources?
Permaculture,3capuc,VermiponicsOnline,5,Mon Jul 6 12:56:04 2015 UTC,"I LOVEmy compost worms! They take a lot of the food we would otherwise throw in the bin, and the ""tea""/ compost they produce is like miracles to my garden"
Permaculture,3capuc,chipichipisu,3,Tue Jul 7 02:30:27 2015 UTC,And here is what one looks like  Pretty straight-forward. Could you take worms and toss them into your fields to aerate them?
Permaculture,3capuc,kazekoru,2,Mon Jul 6 14:36:50 2015 UTC,"And that's an actually overcomplicated version of a worm farm.  You can do it much simpler and easier than that. A plastic tub, an old sink, an unused bath etc."
Permaculture,3capuc,SOPalop,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:38:08 2015 UTC,I think the worms that are sold for composting are different to the earthworms that could aerate a field. Earthworms that will aerate soil are bigger than red wrigglers and prefer different conditions. Id say its best to have both - composting worms in your bin and earthworms in your soil.
Permaculture,3capuc,kazekoru,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:29:54 2015 UTC,"So assume we can't purchase these worms. How does one go about starting this farm thing?  Also, same thing with earthworms for the field - how do I promote my land as a prime piece for them to live in?"
Permaculture,3capuc,kazekoru,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:38:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks Kazekoru, I'd suggest starting with at least 500 worms but its hard to count them once theyre in the wormbin though- if you know anyone else with a wormbin id suggest borrowing worms from their bin and letting them multiply in yours then taking some of them back. Otherwise buying is the simplest option. Where are you based?"
Permaculture,3capuc,OhthatChris,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:05:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not based anywhere right now. (I'm just a dude out of college looking to find my way)  Mostly, I'm on this sub to learn new skills that will eventually help me do my part in my corner of the world."
Permaculture,3capuc,makemeinterested,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:39:52 2015 UTC,Thats cool - I'd try and find a place that has a wormbin running whether its a community garden or a neighbour. Its really interesting stuff and the worm castings/ worm juice is awesome if you're looking to grow your own food.
Permaculture,3capuc,DarkyPoo,3,Tue Jul 7 02:07:52 2015 UTC,"I tried a worm composted and ended up just killing worms. Oh yeah, I also introduced a ton of incredibly tiny bugs to the house. Pretty much one of my biggest fails ever."
Permaculture,3capuc,DarkyPoo,2,Mon Jul 6 16:56:27 2015 UTC,"Me too! Exact same thing.  I was so pleased with the composting, but we just could not get rid of the gnats. No matter what we did.  Broke my heart to see all those worms die, but it was the only option left."

Permaculture,3capuc,howtospeak,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:35:10 2015 UTC,I had them indoors in the worm factory 360
Permaculture,3capuc,howtospeak,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:35:56 2015 UTC,Oh - not sure what happened there. I wouldnt give up on it though! They compost through a lot when they get up and going.
