Ours is now slightly leash reactive (we're fixing it) because of numerous off leash dogs (especially small ones) running up and biting her.  It frickin pisses me off that people think it's ok to have their dog off leash (and let it attack a bigger dog) just because it's small.  Edit: what I find especially annoying was the lady with two white fluffies that she had on the sidewalk next to a road completely off leash.  They of course run up at us barking and growling while my wife jumps ahead to try and herd them away (so our dog won't bit them).  The idiot lady gets up and starts slowly walking towards us going ""oh, it's ok, they're friendly, they won't hurt her"", and we keep saying ""please get your dogs.  Hurry"".  Finally after she repeated again that ""they're friendly"" I shouted at her that ours isn't and if she doesn't want her dogs bit then she should get moving.  She runs over and grabs them, we walk by, and then she puts them down and they rush us again.  I finally just stopped moving and watched her dogs run at us.  She realized that I was going to let them run up on us and see what happens and she runs over and grabs them.  I more and more feel like everyone who owns a small dog is a fucking moron.  Maybe it's unfair, but I haven't had a good experience with an owner of a small dog."

aww,3e2axp,cuntbubbles,40,Tue Jul 21 14:51:21 2015 UTC,"start reactivity training now.  It's pretty easy, basically you just train to me and use a high value treat (we use cheese and hot dogs) to keep the dog's attention on you whenever another dog walks by.  The goal should be to never have your dog react. You should be able to get slowly closer and closer to the other dog without a reaction.  We procrastinated on dealing with the issue and it's made our job much harder.  her issue is my fault in part tbh.  I feel stupid for it but I was so tired of small dogs running up on her off leash that when it happened again (in home depot) I decided to stand back and let my dog lunge at the small dog.  Well, rather than doing that she cowered behind me and got bit on the leg (it didn't break the skin or anything) and ever since then she was reactive to small dogs.  it was a stupid decision, but my hope had been to teach the other guy to leash his dog."
aww,3e2axp,puterTDI,23,Tue Jul 21 14:55:01 2015 UTC,"I've been trying really hard to work on it with her and we have made a lot of progress. I was walking her the other day and a dog my dumbass neighbors let roam freely ran at us and started following us. My dog looked at the dog then immediately calmly looked up at me to receive the treat she knew was coming. I was so proud of her I nearly cried haha. But she has good days and bad days so we're taking her to training classes for that issue at the humane society. I've noticed that her reactions are much better in areas we walk frequently (around the block, downtown where we go often). She's much more likely to react negatively if she's also in an unfamiliar area, where her excitement level is already elevated."
aww,3e2axp,cuntbubbles,3,Tue Jul 21 15:03:19 2015 UTC,Small dogs are allowed to act like shitheads and so are allowed to develop a lot of bad habits that larger dogs don't get to get away with. That's why big dogs tend to be better behaved than smaller dogs on average.

At least the collie-mix makes it pretty clear from a distance that she doesn't suffer fools gladly, so people tend to gather up their small white fluffies.   It's actually the goofy lab I worry about more.   It wouldn't take much for her 80lbs of playful enthusiasm to translate into serious damage to a five pound fluff-ball.  Off-leash/on-leash interaction is stressful no matter what the personality of your on-leash dog."

Yorkie, and my dog stepped on him by accident and it was a terrifying moment.

He's not good with other small dogs, though, and that goes double when he's on a leash. Apparently in his life-before-us he was attacked by an unleashed smaller dog while he was on a leash. His life-before-us was full of problems and lack of training, but is previous person did obey leash laws on the very rare occasion that he took dog out.  We take dog a lot of places. I worked with a trainer and he has good leash manners now... until another dog charges him. Then all bets are off. The last time that happened, we were camping in a state park and a juvenile german shepherd broke his substandard 20' retractible leash and charged our dog. I dropped dog's leash and stepped back - I was not going to end up in the middle of a dog fight. It got noisy, but ultimately no blood was shed, GS's people came and got him, and they kept much better hold of him (at least when we were around) for the rest of the weekend."

There's a small park by my house where I can let her off leash because it's typically empty, but if I see another dog and owner approaching, I immediately leash her because she doesn't do well with other dogs. I typically have issues with the owners of the big friendly dogs letting their dogs come right up to mine and saying, ""Don't worry, she's/he's friendly!"" I have to quickly pick my dog up and explain that she isn't and that she gets nippy when other dogs get in her face. I don't want her hurt when she nips at a big dog who gets too in her face, possibly resulting in that big dog retaliating.

She gets so freaked out when the dog is out that the dog feels like it has to go on the defense. If someone approaches in an unruly way, well, it's a disaster waiting to happen, and would surely mean really bad things for her dog, because he's going to always be seen as the guilty party.

It took him over a year to completely trust my boyfriend and me and I can tell his mental health is a lot better but he's still terrified of other dogs, whether they're bigger or smaller than him. When he sees a dog, he starts to run away and will check over his shoulder to make sure he's not being chased. When we're walking, we just make him go around the other dog and he's fine with that.  But for about four months he was terrified to leave the back door of the apartment because of our neighbors' dog. They keep their dog off leash and they put it in the yard, which the whole apartment complex shares, without watching it. And that dog will always run over to our porch and start sniffing my dog if we're out. My dog isn't aggressive but he'll turn away and growl because he wants to be left alone. I've seen him bare his teeth and snap at other dogs (he probably wouldn't bite because he's super submissive). And my neighbors just stand there calling their dog's name and watching like it's not a big deal when they finally realize their dog is gone. It's infuriating.  You have no idea if a dog is friendly, aggressive or terrified until it's too late. Don't let your dog off leash unless it's really well trained or near other animals/people unless you know it's okay."

aww,3e2axp,Dutch_X,8,Tue Jul 21 14:56:14 2015 UTC,"oh, I don't let them near by now.  Honestly, the reactivity is my fault in part (though this one incident didn't cause it).  Basically I had a small off leash dog run up on her in HD and it was like the third time that day.  Rather than pushing it away I decided to let her defend herself from it so the guy would leash his dog.  Well, rather than lunging at the dog like I expected she cowered behind me.  The dog bit her on the leg and I quickly stepped in and pushed it away, but the damage was done.  She became progressively more reactive to small dogs after that.  I wish I had defended her, but I honestly thought she would get annoyed with it and chase it off. The bite didn't break the skin or anything but it was enough to start her down the path of not liking small dogs.  We're doing reactivity training now and making pretty good progress pretty quickly.  I'm relatively confident that we'll overcome all the issues."

A little dog went after my akitas neck. Just straight up ran up to her and tried to bite her neck. When I pulled up on the leash, they little shit was hanging from her neck. Luckily my dog knew how to handle herself and before it could do any real damage she was able to turn the tables and she was holding their dog by the scruff, like a puppy. Of course they accused our dog of attacking theirs. Never mind mine had cuts on her neck and theirs was fine. Never mind that my dog had theirs by the scruff, and understands mouth pressure so she didn't hurt the little shit.  When I told them to leash their rat, they said they wouldn't need to if my dog was better trained! WTF!"

At our old apartment, we had a neighbor who had a giant German Sheppard who was as mean as the day is long.  The dog had been abused and mom was abused as well.  By proxy, me being a dude was danger.  I was out walking our little basset mix, and Sampson tore through the screen door to say ""Hi"" in his nicest way possible.  Which was not nice in the least.  Me with the basset mix, Mrs Thor with our other basset and Cujo hauling ass our way.  The basset puppy mix got into the Hell Beasts way, being all adorable and just wagging at Sampson.  Not aggressive in the least.  He puffed up and was like ""WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?!?!?! DO YOU NOT FEAR ME?!?!?!""  Our little Dr Zoidberg was like ""Nope, but I would like to be friends, can we be friends?""  About that time the mother of Cerberus came out afraid for the worse while Dr. Zoidberg was running laps around Sampson (AKA Cerberus) and they were having a grand old time.  From that day forward, that dog like his mom, my dogs, Mrs Thor and myself, and I always felt bad for anyone that came by if the dogs were playing if they displayed a bit of dislike for Dr. Zoidberg."

They'd come in with them off the leashes and we'd give them treats at the Pro Desk. It just depends on how well behaved your dog is. One of the dudes had an older malamute/husky type dog and she'd wonder a little to say hi to everyone but as soon as the owner called her, she'd stop whatever she was doing and go straight to him. So I think it just depends on how lenient your management is"

aww,3e2axp,mki401,5,Tue Jul 21 14:32:33 2015 UTC,Seconded. Can bring my dog into HD but definitely cannot bring into Lowes.
aww,3e2axp,lmfaonoobs,14,Tue Jul 21 15:31:52 2015 UTC,That's weird. Every Lowe's I have ever been to allows them. Same with every Home Depot. They're both known for letting you have your animals.
aww,3e2axp,noshoes-noworries,12,Tue Jul 21 14:43:48 2015 UTC,Lowe's store policy is to only allow service animals inside the store.   http://www.10news.com/news/family-of-dog-bite-attack-victim-inside-lowes-talks-only-to-team-10  Edit: Sounds like it's followed on a store-by-store basis based on preference of the management.
aww,3e2axp,mki401,12,Tue Jul 21 14:47:35 2015 UTC,Well animals are welcome inside of the Lowe's I work at. Employees & customers alike bring their dogs in for visits.
aww,3e2axp,noshoes-noworries,3,Tue Jul 21 14:50:40 2015 UTC,"probably specific to the store. I could see them being more strict where incidents have happened (dog bites child). On the flip side, there are probably stores where they are lucky enough that the dogs brought in have really good owners, so they rarely have to worry about something bad happening."
aww,3e2axp,Pachinginator,8,Tue Jul 21 16:18:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what store you work at, but I did 5 years with Lowe's.  Pets NOT allowed.  But like I posted above, if they were quiet and didn't cause problems, we didn't care."

If I'm on the forklift or the reachtruck, my spotter and I are looking for people, not dogs.  Dogs move a lot faster than people do, which cuts reaction time, which leads to me smooshing your pet into the floor."
aww,3e2axp,Th3BlackLotus,29,Tue Jul 21 15:59:54 2015 UTC,Depends on your location and district.  ours keeps treats for the dogs and the entire district allows dogs.  They actually cut out the no dogs part of the sign.  They know our dog by name and if we come in without her they ask us why we didn't bring her.
aww,3e2axp,puterTDI,9,Tue Jul 21 14:17:03 2015 UTC,Lowes employee here.. True story.. Or I at least see dogs all the time at work.   Also.. Owners expect employees to pick up their dogs mess when they go on the floor.
aww,3e2axp,fourdegreez,4,Tue Jul 21 14:41:49 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine expecting that.  We didn't start bringing ours in until she was old enough not to do that, and when she was fairly young we still had her go outside (and picked it up).  We never once had an accident in the store (we started bringing her after her first shots) but if we did I would insist on cleaning it up myself."
aww,3e2axp,puterTDI,3,Tue Jul 21 14:50:22 2015 UTC,It's only happened 2 times to me.. And both times customers assumed I had bags and scoopers in my vest to take care of them.
aww,3e2axp,fourdegreez,4,Tue Jul 21 15:05:30 2015 UTC,"god, that's ridiculous.  We always have bags with us.  If it had happened one of us would have found an employee and asked if we could get supplies from them to properly clean the floor.  We would have scooped whatever we could then washed the floor.  That being said, when our dog was young enough to do this we actually carried her in a purse/bag my wife had (she's a golden).  It kept her off the floor and away from any stuff we wouldn't want her to get in to, kept her from going on the floor, and kept her feeling safe.  once she was older we used the store to train her.  She was always next to us and we taught her to stop and sit next to us when we stopped.    Accidents happen, but clean up after your damned dog.  If it consistently can't hold things then don't bring it into the store.  When her reactivity was at its worse (barking at other dogs) we stopped bringing her in until we were confident we could avoid issues."
aww,3e2axp,puterTDI,9,Tue Jul 21 15:08:13 2015 UTC,So I asked about this. I actually called up my local home depot and specifically asked about it and was told it's up to the local managers discretion and that particular one did allow them despite the sign on the door. Bit of a weird system.

aww,3e2axp,PM_me_your_homelab,18,Tue Jul 21 15:02:26 2015 UTC,"Nah, it's actually Shihtty owners that don't teach their dog properly as you should teach any dog. They think that because they are so cute they don't need training and treat them like cats. Idiots don't realise that domestic dogs even Shih Tzu (or any other small cute breed) are not that far off from being wolves in their DNA.  And then it's always the Shih-Tzu that suffers because they end up being put down/abandoned because ""their bad behaviour"", which is usually true - because the owner caused the bad behaviour.   Poor Lady.  Really needs to be mandatory basic testing for dog ownership to make sure the owners aren't complete nitwits who just buy a cute puppy from a pet shop window. And if their in an severe incident due to their negligence (of not training their dog properly) they should be banned from owning dogs ever again."
aww,3e2axp,SimonGn,16,Tue Jul 21 15:43:16 2015 UTC,"The owners. Still, never try to immediately pet an unknown dog."
aww,3e2axp,BoneCarlos,3,Tue Jul 21 15:38:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  If I see an unknown dog I'll look and see if it looks calm or agitated.  If it looks calm, I'll offer it the back of my hand to sniff (offer, not just stick my hand in its face).  Once a dog has had a chance to sniff you and determine if you're friendly or not, then it'll generally either back away and not want to be pet or nudge you/ask to be pet.  Then you can start petting the dog, once it has determined that you're not threatening it and it's willing to be pet by you.    What you most definitely do not do is stick your face in an unknown animal's face, since that's how you get your nose bitten off."
aww,3e2axp,mxzf,7,Tue Jul 21 17:00:08 2015 UTC,"What the hell is wrong with that greeter?   You don't approach dogs that you don't know, especially not face first. Now the dog will likely be put down because she didn't know how to give unknown dogs their space.   ALWAYS ASK the owner if you can pet their dog, and even if they say yes, allow the dog to make their own decision. Personally, I don't like being touched by strangers without warning or consent either.   some doggy etiquette"
aww,3e2axp,helpppppppppppp,4,Tue Jul 21 16:46:20 2015 UTC,"The dog definitely was poorly trained, but the woman isn't without fault either.  If your face is close enough to a strange dog's mouth that it can just lunge and bite you like that, you are TOO CLOSE.  Dogs typically don't like having people in their face like that, especially not strangers.  It is a threatening behavior to them.   Even my dog, who used to be a seeing eye dog and has her CGC, gets uncomfortable with people in her face that way (she would never bite, but I can tell from her body language that she dislikes it, and often have to tell strangers to step back)."

Why do we want something that dirty around our clean food?  People please do not bring a dog or small horse (yes this is a thing) into to a store unless they are trained and are a guide dog. Most people do not have service dog. Most people are bringing in untrained dogs because they just want to and they think it is cute or because a celebrity does. If I come around a corner in a store and a Dog snaps at me I go into full panic mode and it feels like I am having a heart attack. It is nothing I can control it is has been because I have been attacked by dogs while working in people's home as a repair man. All the dogs ""Would never hurt a fly"".   If a store like lowes allows it. I don't go there because of it. Problem is now they are allowed anyplace even with out a service ID.

aww,3e0obu,bon_bons,31,Tue Jul 21 13:34:12 2015 UTC,"Hello - just here to tell you that compost is not good for dogs. When certain foods decompose they develop a fungus/mould (not sure on the correct terminology). Anyway, it's toxic to dogs. Our dog was admitted to the emergency vet after eating compost. She was violently tremoring and the first thing that the vet asked was if she had eaten compost. She had to stay the night and didn't fully recover for three~ days."

The first sign something was up was she looked like she was tripping balls staring off into the distance and gently swaying. Straight to vet who gave iso-morphine to induce vomiting.  She was fine after a few hours but I would strongly recommend caution with dogs around compost.

aww,3dzer4,altCognito,12,Tue Jul 21 01:32:30 2015 UTC,That's not hard wood or Cor-tec vinyl flooring. It's a wood grain ceramic tile. The thin grout lines are a dead giveaway. Good looking stuff.

Unfortunately I've filed many claims for customers resulting in long agonizing wait times on phones and faxes repeatedly lost to the ether.

By comparison the Dixie group, who makes a chunk of my carpets, is a joy to deal with."
aww,3dzer4,altCognito,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:44:50 2015 UTC,"I could get more specific but I'm sure nobody cares that much.   Me the guy having the floors finished installed sort of cares, sort of not. The floor looks good enough for now, I don't expect it to last forever and whatnot. Also, my expectations of honoring warranties is almost nil.   I did a little investigation before they installed it and about the only problems I heard about were uneven floor installations that resulted in some buckling.   Anyway, what are the issues you hear about? Is there anything at this stage that I should be aware of other than an unlevel floor installation?"
aww,3dzer4,TheCrispyDud,2,Tue Jul 21 12:21:13 2015 UTC,"Being that is vinyl I wouldn't worry too much, it's pretty hard to screw up making it.

There's options such as leveling and embossing to prepare various subfloor issues that can arise."

aww,3dydtw,Psychegotical,33,Mon Jul 20 20:56:11 2015 UTC,"My brilliant parents took me to Jaws when I was 7. I lived 10 miles from the coast and my surfer dad would drag us to the beach every weekend. Yes, that is how I remember it - being ""dragged"" to the beach after watching Jaws. Sad ain't it? Before that damn movie I jumped at the chance to go to the beach."
aww,3dydtw,WoodstockSara,98,Mon Jul 20 20:06:59 2015 UTC,"My sister took me to see Jaws when it came out in the theaters. I was 7 as well. Fucked me up so bad that I couldn't even swim in large swimming pools with having a panic attack. When I was 14 my dad took me to Cuba, and finally I decided that I'd go in the ocean. It was beautiful, the water was clear and warm, and I was fascinated by a giant sea slug that was slowly moving on the bottom, about 20 feet down. Then I looked up and a shark was coming straight at me. I couldn't move. It got bigger and bigger, and kept coming. It bumped into me, and I guess it freaked out as much as I did. My dad was on the shore at the time, and he said that it looked like I was running on the surface of the water to get out. Finding out later that it was a nurse shark, and totally harmless didn't help at all. Since that time I haven't been in a natural body of water., and I'll be 45 next month. That shit stays with you."

Edit: actually that just reminded me about snorkeling in Mexico and I almost had a panic attack when facing the continental shelf - where you look out and it's dark and the ground drops out. I made my dad hold my hand after that and I did much better. I was about 35 at the time."
aww,3dydtw,WoodstockSara,32,Mon Jul 20 20:50:35 2015 UTC,"Went diving in Mexico and sat at the continental shelf dropoff for half the dive. I dunno why but staring into it and seeing the occasional ray swim out, it's been the only time in my life when I wasn't afraid of dying."

aww,3dydtw,WoodstockSara,21,Tue Jul 21 00:04:25 2015 UTC,I was never afraid of swimming in open water but I took a trip to Hawaii and went snorkeling for the first time at... Hanauma? Bay. While I was snorkeling along by myself having a great time I must've taken a wrong turn in the reef and ended up in a tiny area where I was surrounded by tight walls of coral. I looked down and there was this HUGE goddamn eel that was going nuts at my flippers. Noped right on out of there.

We went out on their boat off of the beach that Jaws was filmed on. I was already terrified of sharks, but my older sister (who hated me) convinced me to go swimming off the boat with her. The second I got in the water, she climbed back on to the boat and pulled the ladder up so I couldn't get back on. I was fucking petrified. I'm still wary now... oceans, lakes, swimming pools..."

aww,3dydtw,hankdiggles,46,Mon Jul 20 22:38:45 2015 UTC,"I've gone scuba diving quite a lot on the west coast and this can be fairly common behavior for seals and sea lions.   The sea lions tend to be more interested in coming to check you out and mess with you a bit. A lot of dive bombing at you and then playing chicken with you. They always veer away, which is good because getting hit by a fast moving sea lion torpedo would probably really hurt.  The seals have always been more touchy in my experience. Like one time I had one chewing on my fins, tickle my legs, nibble on a mesh bag at my waist, then plant it's nose against mine before quickly darting away and taking up a wide-eyed crouching position against some rocks exactly like how my cats behave when they want to play. I've also seen them nibble on my student divers. Mostly they like to chew on fins, but one time we had a seal grab someone's console and try to drag him under.   One day we were diving at a marine reserve to collect some data, but we were limited to a shitty entry point since the other one we preferred was taken up by seals. You're actually not allowed to (knowingly) approach or chase them. But once we were in the water, the law didn't prevent them from flopping into the ocean to come over and swarm us.   Oh, and there's this one cove where if you're on the surface they'll play a game of sneak up and peekaboo with you. It's great cause you'll be talking to someone on the surface and a seal will pop up next to and slightly behind him, then when he turns to look at it the seal stares back kind of like ""Ooops! You found me!"" and then immediately disappears, only to reappear next to someone else."

aww,3dydtw,THANKS-FOR-THE-GOLD,10,Mon Jul 20 20:57:39 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing. You said a ""sea lion is a seal.""  Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.  As someone who is a scientist who studies seals, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls sea lions seals. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.  If you're saying ""seal family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Pinnipedia, which includes things from walruses to elephant seals to fur seals.  So your reasoning for calling a sea lion a seal is because random people ""call the swimming mammals seals?"" Let's get otters and dolphins in there, then, too.  Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A sea lion is a sea lion and a member of the seal family. But that's not what you said. You said a sea lion is a seal, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the seal family seals, which means you'd call walruses, elephant seals, and other mammals seals, too. Which you said you don't.  It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"

aww,3dydtw,elric82,522,Mon Jul 20 17:51:38 2015 UTC,I saw a documentary once about a loose seal biting off some guys hand. He got a hook afterwards so everything turned out great.

aww,3dydtw,Tino42,31,Mon Jul 20 20:40:03 2015 UTC,"This happens in La Jolla, CA every so often. Kids like to sit on them and pull on the ears/whiskers. Every once in a while the seal will bite back. Never heard of someone losing a nose but wouldn't be surprised. You are not supposed to go near them."
aww,3dydtw,TheEdge7896,6,Mon Jul 20 20:15:12 2015 UTC,I was just there last week and was curious so I looked stuff up about and read they have one of the worst bites in the animal kingdom due to bacteria in their mouths or something. Then i see this gif. Its so cute but seems so risky.
aww,3dydtw,shwag945,63,Mon Jul 20 21:44:16 2015 UTC,They are the dogs of the ocean and when a dog gets pissed off they bite no different here.
aww,3dydtw,RJIZZLE800,30,Mon Jul 20 18:07:14 2015 UTC,That is a Sea Lion not a seal. they are generally harmless.
aww,3dydtw,xsparr0w,7,Mon Jul 20 20:21:38 2015 UTC,"You know what I believe you're right.  SEA LION, not a seal.  I stand corrected."

aww,3dydtw,-Knul-,40,Mon Jul 20 20:41:17 2015 UTC,"I see some comments about how playful and dog-like they are.. Is that the norm? Should the average person still be cautious of them, or are they mostly friendly?"
aww,3dydtw,Daveezie,60,Mon Jul 20 19:38:35 2015 UTC,"They're wild animals, while dogs have been domesticated for thousands of years. I would be careful with any wild animal."

aww,3dydtw,lolag0ddess,4,Mon Jul 20 21:13:27 2015 UTC,We do! At least the military does.  The Navy trains both Sea Lions and Dolphins for various purposes.

aww,3dydtw,punkrawkintrev,4,Tue Jul 21 00:12:15 2015 UTC,"I haven't had upclose experience to say friendly or not but they're super curious! When I've done ocean-bay kayaking, they always follow closely. They'll swim circles around, swim right next to your kayak, do laps underneath the kayak. It's pretty cool how engaged they are."
aww,3dydtw,ihavetowhat,75,Mon Jul 20 20:46:05 2015 UTC,Its like that super drunk girl at the bar when you're trying to be nice but she's just not getting the hint that you're not interested.
