This is most common in progressive/power metal artists like Yngwie Malmsteen, Dream Theater, Vinnie Moore, Tony MacAlpine, and others. Outside of that particular subgenre, it doesn't share very many similarities at all. And the similarities are limited to arpeggios of harmonic minor modes found in the Baroque and Classical periods.

VVith so many falses nearby, there vvas no vvay I covld safely hide the body so I did the next best thing. I pvt the mask back and acted like he vvas my incredibly drvnk friend.

I wondered whether this was because of their own nature or whether it came from the divine power of the gods they worshipped. I set out on a secret trip to Asgard and changed into the likeness of an old man to disguise myself. I was led to the gates of Valhalla and saw a man in the doorway of the hall. I recognized this man to be Varg Vikernes, lord of trveness, son of Eirik and the gods of old.  ""Lord Varg, son of Eirik and gods of old. I am but a humble traveler seeking the wisdom of the Æsir"" I said to him  ""Traveler, I shall share my infinite wisdom with you, but first thou must display thy own wisdom."" He said in response  ""How can I display my wisdom with thou?"" I asked  ""You shall ask questions of the world around you and I shall answer, from this I will know if you contain wisdom worthy of the knowledge of the Æsir."" he told me  To this I asked him many questions of the gods of old, the nature of the world, and the early Norwegian BM scene and eventually Varg deemed me worthy of the knowledge of the Æsir. After words he handed me a torch and said  ""Go now, and cleanse the earth of the worship places of the followers of Christ, show your loyalty to the gods of old, and you shall come here again to spend eternity in Valhalla""  And that is what I have been doing ever since"

metaljerk,3cdd2n,sinndogg2,14,Tue Jul 7 01:32:09 2015 UTC,"If there's something in the metal world that i hate it is that everyone criticizes each other. For example saying that another band isn't ""real metal"" or ""true metal"", like what the fuck is wrong with you guys. Can't you accept that there are lots and lots of different kinds of metal that is supposed to satisfy everyone. For example, i can't stand black, doom or certain death metal, but i don't call the people who listen to it for ""satanic bitches"" or ""the devils whores"". And that of course means that the close minded fucks who have to criticize other kinds of metal and people who listen to that metal for example ""emo faggots"" or ""scene bitches"". If you truly call yourself proud of being a metal head i have no idea what's wrong with you, cause i'm not proud of being a metal head. Because i don't want people to think that i'm someone who has to criticize everything that's not to my liking. When i grew up i learned that listening to and liking metal makes you a metal head, no matter if you listen to metalcore, death metal, heavy metal or pop-metal. If you listen to any kind of metal you are a metal head. When i was young and started to like metal i wanted to grow up and feel proud of being a metal head. But i grew up and became a bit ashamed instead, because of all the close minded people who has to make fun of other metal heads because they doesn't listen to the same ""real metal"" as themselves. I don't know them all, but there are surely hundreds of different metal genres and listening to any of them makes you a metal head. I've also noticed that most of the people who say ""emo faggots"" are mostly fans of death, doom and black metal. So my question to those people, what makes you so fucking superior to everyone else for listening to those genres? And for the record i listen to everything from Asking Alexandria to Lamb of God to Five Finger Death Punch but i mainly prefer AA, now does that make me an ""emo faggot"", ""satanic bitch"" or just a casual fucking metal head who enjoys my music? I don't want to say that everyone is like this, but there a way too many for me to say that i'm proud of being a metal head. No matter where i go on YouTube or a forum where people talk about bands i always find people who just have to bash down of those bands and their fans. I'm going to take a personal example, the one band that brought me in to metal is called Dead by April. I like how they mix metal, pop and synth. I love all of their songs and i'm a diehard fan so of course i'm going to get mad at people for not calling them metal or for calling them ""gay metal"". Now everything doesn't have to sound lame and generic as every old metal bands that in my opinion sounds a lot like each other. Now don't get me wrong, i love old metal but i just don't find it as exciting and fun as newer metal. So Dead by April was a clear shot for me, i loved their music and then i found other metal bands that i liked a lot as well. And then they entered a Swedish contest called Melodifestivalen, which is where we choose one out of a lot of different artists to compete in Eurovision song contest. After that people started to call them sellouts and that they just wanted to make more money. Which was not the case, they entered because they thought it was a fun thing to do and they wanted to reach out and see if they could get a bigger audience, which i'm sure any band/artist out there would want. For example, how many would've called Iron Maiden for sellouts if they entered Eurovision? The answer is no one, because they are considered legends, sure they've done a lot more and is more famous, but it's the same thing and concept. I also don't look a certain way, i don't have imo disgustingly long hair and a big fucking beard like most death metal fans i've seen and i don't have long styled hair that covers half of my face. I just look like everybody else. All of my friends and all the persons i know that listen to metal are just casual metal lovers, we don't bash each other down for not liking the other ones metal taste. If we play a song and the other one doesn't like it he/she just says ""I don't really like that band/song"" and that's it, then we don't talk about it anymore. And that's how it should be in the whole metal world. We should be able to have opinions and tell them to each other without being bashed on or called idiots. I should be able to say that i don't like the vocals in Meshuggah and that i prefer the vocals in Avenged Sevenfold(which i do) without getting hated for it. Oh and by the way calling someone for ""scene bitch"" or saying that a band is ""gay"" or ""poser shit"" isn't an opinion, it's called being a fucking douche bag. The only thing i want is for everyone in the metal world to stop being pricks to each other and become friends instead. We are pretty much outcasts in the ""normal"" society, so why not join each other and be metal heads together. Like in the good old days i've heard about when people who were friends and considered each other metal heads, they didn't necessarily have to like the same kind of metal but they still considered the other one a metal head. That's how i want it to be and not like it is nowadays. I'm going to let you think through if you actually are proud of being a metal head or not, because i'm not. And do you want to know what these three guys have in common http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yIakcziNM4w/TQgIiBEzk0I/AAAAAAAAADY/jqGXhfJVd7k/s1600/gaahl-sotra.jpg     http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-O11TPoxjjQs/UHOlEqT10MI/AAAAAAAAAFw/iHB1XRk0wUM/s400/danny+worsnop-vocals.jpg     http://imgur.com/aNxSb0n, they're all metal heads. And i'm sure that if they sat down in a room together they would become pretty good friends even tho they might not like the same kind of metal. And that's how i want it to be."

It would have been hilarious if he posted Shadows Fall to powermetal with a title like (/r/metal didn't like this, maybe you will), and got bashed there too. Hell, even the mods and some users at powermetal were pretty straight forward for why metalcore isn't metalcore, and doesn't belong in /r/metal."

Lyricists are expendable, falsch.  <nojerk> Out of curiosity, did banjaxe get distracted by real-life shit, or just lose interest?  He did try and get us the bass stems for VVhorefvck, but he had problems extracting them from Audacity and it never happened.  And as I've said before, I prefer to write more pure black metal, so I've been struggling to come up with metalpunky stuff that didn't sound weak as fuck.  Gym's also been taking up a lot of time (3+ hours a day, including travel, because I walk there), not to mention exams just wrapped up recently.  Also,   >implying that this isn't basically the blueprint of metalpunk  </nojerk>"

I am the heart vnd sovl ov Goatcifer. VVithovt me yov falses vvovld be playing djent and singing abovt vvhales. Yov and everyone else are expendable.  <Nojerk> I have no idea. I think he's just busy with the e-cigs and weed again since he did show up in the modmail about recording Goatcifer on cassette.   You should upload those things weak riffs anyway. Most guitar sounds pretty weak without bass so they might end up sounding better with some bass behind them. Why are you going to the gym everyday? Are you trying to be a body builder or something?  I should add Hellhammer back to that spreadsheet I posted a while ago. I guess I just wasn't ready for Hellhammer at the time.  </Nojerk>
metaljerk,3auoap,Dragovic,2,Wed Jun 24 02:51:33 2015 UTC,"Yov're talking to someone vvho's very considerate as far as trves go, yov false.  I actvally try to mix my gvitars as lovv as possible so that the other insTRVEments don't get drovvned ovt.  That's vvhy Bvrn and Die the Falses' gvitars are so hard to hear relative to the bass.  <nojerk> I actually did that with the first version of BaDtF, which is why it can be hard to distinguish the guitars from the rest.  It was to avoid smothering banjaxe's bass, but it sort of had the opposite effect instead.  Speaking of BaDtF, I may see about re-recording guitars and vocals for the original version instead of using the 2.0 version, because the slowdowny part was cool, and there's already bass and drum tracks there.  Yeah, figured that weed might be a factor for banjaxe (he also mentioned a camping trip recently).  djherp seems to have been getting high a lot lately too.  Does this mean that Goatcifer is about to go soft and become a heavy stoner rock band like Mastodon did?  I actually scrap most of the riffs, but coming up with similar ones isn't hard.  I've noticed a lot of the recent ones have had similar chord/note choices to VVhorefvck and Vnholy Svmmoning, which could make our songs sound a bit too samey.  As for the gym, I'm mostly there to lose weight, but I'm also focusing on building muscle because it adds to your daily calorie burn (7-13 cal/lb, roughly).  It's pretty much a 50/50 strength/cardio split during weekdays, with cardio-only weekends, and I do it every day because, if you take a day off, it's easy to tell yourself that one more won't hurt, and the cycle of avoidance begins.  It was hard enough getting back into it after taking a week and a half off for exams.  And which spreadsheet is that?  In any case, you should listen to more Hellhammer.  In fact, everybody should.  </nojerk>"
metaljerk,3auoap,IAMNOTINDIAN,2,Wed Jun 24 11:34:08 2015 UTC,"Yov're talking to someone vvho's very considerate as far as trves go   Kek. Those tvvo things are complete opposites.

Besides ask anyone and they'll agree that yov are one ov the falsest falses. Yov shovld start mixing yovr gvitar lovder. It's one on the vvimpest sovnding things I've heard. Better yet start playing non vvimpy riffs. Sometimes I think /u/IAMNOTINDIAN shovld replace yov even thovgh he's a teenager, his riffs are mvch less vvimpy.  <Nojerk> You should do that more often, it sounded great. You should definitely rerecord using the original version but do that later. We need to start more songs instead of rerecording the ones we already have.  Stoner metalpunk sounds like it could be cool. Also /u/IAMNOTINDIAN smokes weed too so at least half of Goatcifer are stoners. I'm pretty sure /u/I_Smell_Panties smokes too. I have no proof but he just seems like that type of guy. If anything, they can join me with Blazing Loa and we can make some even more depressive and suicidal stoner black metal together. Speaking of which, I'm a stoner metal poser. I don't even smoke weed but I make stoner metal.  I don't think it'll be too much of an issue yet but when we start to have a decent amount of songs it could be an issue so for now a couple more similarish songs won't be much of a problem unless they sound too much alike.  I've never really started with the gym so I wouldn't know about doing it every day though I really should start going. I actually started running on a treadmill when I had a bunch of concerts to go to in a short amount of time so I could mosh and get through it without being as tired. It actually worked to get me motivated pretty well until there were no good concerts for a while and I had no reason to continue. Now I just don't have the money for that many concerts so close together.  I posted it in one of the discussion threads. It's a color coded spreadsheet I've had since high school with all the bands that need to check out or need to look into more that I'm very slow at checking out. If you want to see it, it's on the Goatcifer Google drive. It's started to grow slower now that I'm on reddit since most of the bands I've decided to check out later are now under my saved links.</Nojerk>"

Dat mariachi post-polkagrind breakdovvn in the middle ov Lovder than the Ectopic Stroll.  <nojerk> Yeah, I wasn't feeling The Endless River all that much either. It's an OK album, but Division Bell was so much better IMO, and High Hopes was the perfect swansong for Pink Floyd. Louder than Words was alright, but High Hopes had a way bigger impact on me personally, especially with that last solo at the end. Yeah, I though Coma Ecliptic was a pretty fantastic album overall; way better than Colours and The Parallax II IMO. Not sure if it beats Alaska or The Great Misdirect though, as I need to give it a few more listens to digest it probably, but they're definitely got back on the horse with this one. It's a lot less random, as they aren't trying to cram 400 genres into 1 song, which allowed the songwriting to really shine. If this is the direction BtBAM is going in, then I'll really be looking forward to future releases from them. <nojerk/>"

Snoopsnoo says he probably lives in Washington DC or China besides I think he's one of those teenagers that is a Nazi or a communist to be edgy. Also apparently he has a brother, is a huge sabaton fan, likes to discuss communism, likes electronic music, and is asleep between 12PM and 5PM."
