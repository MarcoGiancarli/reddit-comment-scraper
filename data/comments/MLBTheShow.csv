MLBTheShow,3e43no,Wolverines05,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:37:20 2015 UTC,"Very awesome.  I'm not a noob by any means, but this was really informative for people of all skill levels.  I'm curious - What pitching and hitting settings do you prefer? Preferred camera?"
MLBTheShow,3e43no,gleamteam_matt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:42:28 2015 UTC,"well, you check out my mlb 15 the show guides. i cover each mechanic in depth and talk bout preferences a bit in the description sections. but im a zone man all the way for hitting. and i prefer analog for pitching. those mechanics give you most control over outcomes and (arguably) require the most skill to be successful. I love a good challenge."
MLBTheShow,3e43no,Wolverines05,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:45:13 2015 UTC,"I have a few questions, and I think you covered it in the video, but I had a hard time processing it all.   In pure analog hitting, did you say that you get a hit bonus if your swing on the stick matched the vertical action of the pitch?   Also, in zone hitting, what gives you the best hitting bonus? If you're a pull hitter, focusing on the pull side and the pitch comes inside? Is that the best possible hitting outcome?"

That being said, Cano has been somewhat horrible this year, but based on his past 3 years, he should still be above 90. Really, we don't know what SDS will do.
