arabs,3e4vcc,johncook418,4,Tue Jul 21 23:45:02 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to break it to you man but this happening is next to impossible for multiple reasons. I'm an engineer at one of the big three auto manufactures in the US and realizing just how grand and complex these projects are for something as simple as picking what kind of screw to use for one part is lots of work and years of experience/knowledge, which doesn't exist here. the talent poor for an automotive industry is pretty much nill in the arab world.  1st and most important though it would not even be worth the effort. There's no way in hell we can implement an assembly line and even if we could the amount of years we would be lagging behind in the industry would lead to a VERY competitive  industry. You'd be able to order cars from overseas at less price and at a faster rate, so really there's no point.  tldr: impossible/not worth the effort. Competition has been doing way to long to enter the race now."

arabs,3e2hmh,Dasizme,4,Tue Jul 21 17:49:38 2015 UTC,"Egypt is falling apart due to far too high population growth, things are literally getting only worse because population growth outstrips the meagre advancements made.   And the fertility rate is only increasing...."
arabs,3e2hmh,kolal2,2,Tue Jul 21 18:18:54 2015 UTC,"And the fertility rate is only increasing.   this statement is so devoid of context and gives the impression that fertility rates in Egypt have always been increasing. The fertility rate in Egypt use to be almost 7 in 1960. By 2005 it was reduced to 3, but over the last 5 years it went up again to 3.5. The recent increase is probably due to chaos and lack of focus on the issue after the 2011 uprising. Overall Egypt has actually done much better than most African and Arabs countries in getting it fertility rate under control."
arabs,3e2hmh,ontotta,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:41:08 2015 UTC,"Yea, it seems many Arabs outside of Egypt don't realize this. I think it's because their countries are typically somewhat sparsely populated and assume Egypt is the same because, hey, it's just another Arab country. But Egypt is more like India, it is insufferably overpopulated, polluted and poor. Getting out of the Nile valley is a matter of life or death for Egypt."

Not a good score but far from the ""third from the bottom"" position presented by the article.  Edit: Actually page 173 breaks down each subindex of Egypt into several measures, and indeed Egypt ranks 141/144 on quality of primary education alone. Oh my."
arabs,3e2hmh,KebabEbnKebab,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:34:35 2015 UTC,This why democracy failed in Egypt. How the hell is the average person expected to vote when he can't even read and do research? Access to Internet? Literally all the information you get is from TV propaganda. Brainwashed on all sides
arabs,3e2hmh,CupOfCanada,4,Tue Jul 21 17:01:18 2015 UTC,"Democracy failed in large part because it wasn't given a chance.  The military even designed an electoral system that was contrary their goals out of sheer incompetence. Then they had to dissolve the legislature over it, leaving an authoritarian-prone leader with no check against his power.  Heck, why was there even a presidential system in the first place?"
arabs,3e2hmh,el3r9,3,Tue Jul 21 20:23:07 2015 UTC,"Eh  This is not the place for this argument, but democracy ""failed"" in Egypt because a military coup happened.

arabs,3e2hmh,KebabEbnKebab,0,Tue Jul 21 19:30:27 2015 UTC,True I guess it's a plethora or reasons. my point is the old state/military pretty much owns the media so they can brainwash and control the masses since they control the media. People inside Egypt are probably have no access to what the hell is actually going on in rural areas they cant even read so when the source of information is telling you these people are terrorists you pretty much have no choice but to believe it.

arabs,3dyqq3,AL-Taiar,4,Mon Jul 20 21:36:57 2015 UTC,"There was an article in the New York Times about this show.   Nasserites and the military receive the most flattering treatment.   Historians say that the Nasserite, pro-military nationalists of that era and the Islamists of the Muslim Brotherhood leapt together to the forefront of the fight against the new state of Israel. And in the “Young Egypt” movement, some of the pro-military nationalists actively scapegoated the Egyptian Jews in Cairo.   But the series omits the role of such nationalists in persecuting and ultimately pushing out many of Cairo’s Jews. Instead, it blames the Islamists of the Muslim Brotherhood almost exclusively, suggesting that the group’s leaders were more interested in attacking their Jewish neighbors than in fighting against Israel."

arabs,3dyqq3,sulaymanf,9,Mon Jul 20 22:29:29 2015 UTC,"It is only surprising for people who buy into the age old Zionist propaganda that Palestinian (and Arab) opposition to Zionism is due to antisemitism.  I did not watch the show but I remember reading that the embassy later complained about the shows' characterization of Jews who are non/anti Zionist as good and Jews who are Zionists as bad.  There were plenty of well integrated and popular Jewish individuals in the Arab world, their status and persecution was primarily the result of Zionism and the effort, which is more successful today than ever, to conflate Zionism with Judaism."
arabs,3dyqq3,WhydoIcare6,9,Mon Jul 20 21:35:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to start a hostile debate here, just ask an honest question.  If Jews were so integrated and welcomed in the Arab world before Israel was formed, why did it quickly go so sour? I think it is a testament to the fact that Jews weren't necessarily completely secure in their homes?   For example, my friend's mother (Moroccan-Jewish) often talks about how her parents were not Zionists and loved Morocco but when things started heating up in Palestine the populace got increasingly hostile.  Kind of like after 9/11 when Americans became very paranoid about their Muslim neighbors (or anyone who ""looked middle-eastern""). Before, most Americans didn't really hate or concern themselves with the lives of Muslims, but the sudden mistrust kind of shows the already existing (but suppressed) religious/race prejudice that people held."
