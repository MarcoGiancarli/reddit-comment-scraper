'Competitions' can be equally or even more exciting than traditional sports.  Ever watch baseball or cricket?  A desperate attempt to legitimize your hobby by forcing a mainstream audience to recognize it as a 'sport' is futile.  It leads to endless bickering over pointless labels.  Enjoy it for what it is.  Fucking awesome robot combat."

For some reason people still hold the TV as the holy grail of competition.  It's what brings in the money for the NFL and the NBA, but there are plenty of other ways to grow your brand.  I've said it in a few other threads but I've said it again, this show has done an excellent job in rekindling my childhood memories and I'd be more than happy to throw down on some type of PPV internet service.  If for any reason the BB network show fails I really hope they explore alternates like Twitch or a competitor.  I'd be happy to subscribe."

Itll take much more episodes and development to televise multiple weight classes and Im sure ABC wont want to bother with it.
battlebots,3e4qh2,Dtr45,5,Tue Jul 21 23:14:03 2015 UTC,No.  I think it's only going to be the 250 lb class for a while.

I might be able to swing a miracle if they continue to be HW-only though. Just depends on what kinds of stuff I can pick and if I get lucky.

battlebots,3e2ax0,abhishekcal,20,Tue Jul 21 12:18:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, mostly the latter.  Sponsors are great if you can get them.  Since this season was invitational, the builders got a stipend, but it's unlikely they'll do that again since next season is intended to be an open competition.  Merchandising is another way to make some money; that's why some builders make robots that look like they'd make good toys.  But for the majority of builders, the majority of money is out of pocket, and they do it for the love of the sport."
battlebots,3e2ax0,ResettisReplicas,9,Tue Jul 21 13:47:42 2015 UTC,The show is killing the ratings. Why wouldn't stipends continue?
battlebots,3e2ax0,Spats_McGee,6,Tue Jul 21 15:14:19 2015 UTC,"More money directly to the network. Plus since this time they were invitational, they controlled how many bots there were plus alot of the teams already had bots and just repainted and renamed them for the competition. With next season being open, we dont know how many people will attempt to enter or who will and you cant really pay every bot that enters."

battlebots,3e2ax0,Osmarov,7,Tue Jul 21 13:16:27 2015 UTC,"Television royalties were dispensed during the Comedy Central seasons, and there were talks that it was one of the reasons why they stopped airing the rumbles at the end of the seasons. For some builders, such as Complete Control, they were able to rebuild their robots on the royalty checks alone."
battlebots,3e2ax0,ZetaGator,2,Tue Jul 21 15:02:47 2015 UTC,"As I understood it the builders in the 1 on 1 matches were paid for each showing as well. A set amount for the first showing and less for each rerun.  In the CC season 5 there were 500+ robots competing with only a small fraction getting on TV and even less getting any merchandise deals so very few builders saw any money. To OPs question for me it was for love of the sport. Since most of the robots in this season were actually shown on TV I'd think there was a better chance to recoup expenses or maybe even make a profit. Not begrudging them that, there wasn't much time to get ready and the quality of the bots are pretty good."
battlebots,3e2ax0,Expired_Twinkie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:35:25 2015 UTC,A lot of the builders already work for robotics companies and have internal resources.

battlebots,3e5hhj,Mike_Savage_Ledger,5,Wed Jul 22 02:46:18 2015 UTC,"I agree %100 with you. I know Tombstone and Bronco will give a great show..but knowing GR he will get lucky/ have some stupid ass additon to his ""perfect bot"" ( that didn't last 1 round in tact) and it will half way work and he will ""glot"" all over himself. So he will probably skate to the finals. As much as I love Bronco....I am willing to see him lose a good match to watch Tombstone put a big ass blade on his bot spin the bad boy up and tear GR so bad he won't shit right"
battlebots,3e5hhj,StremeSpoats,4,Wed Jul 22 04:19:00 2015 UTC,"In my opinion if he can MacGuyver enough interchangeable weapons to beat Biteforce and Tombstone then he is plenty deserving of the nut.  I'm really not seeing the beef with Ghost Raptor here. Sure its blade was hollow and lasted no time at all, but after that its been adapted to suit its opponent and I feel that should be commended. The de-icer was inspired and I want him to win off of that alone."
battlebots,3e5hhj,HarleyWorking,2,Wed Jul 22 05:07:58 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I'm not sure if there is anything ""cheap"" that can be built to counter Biteforce. That robot isn't going to fuck itself up like Icewave did."

battlebots,3e5hhj,CarlCaliente,2,Wed Jul 22 04:56:46 2015 UTC,"I picked them as a favorite after the tested videos.  I can't really hold any grudges given the nature of the shooting, its clearly all about TV #1 and competition #2.    I can see the attitude that their 'adaptable' weapon was cheap since it was basically created to nullify Icewave (who was a very close 2nd favorite of mine).  At the same time it would've been great to see them to head to head with properly working weapons.  But I'd rather see a few 'crap' matches to secure a long term deal than some honest fights that go back into the underground  ...that is, unless you know someone with dem underground tickets"

In the case of Orb of Doom, there's very few ways to mount weapons on a design like that. And there is a disadvantage in traction and pushing power... Actually, it has very little going for it.  In another thread people were discussing omnidirectional drive systems, as used on robots like Alcoholic Stepfather. This design does have some advantages, as it can keep a heavily armored front to the opposing robot at all times. But ultimately, it's still not as good as regular wheels because mecanum wheels are expensive, fragile, offer less traction, difficult to build, and no redundancy.   You can read the thread I was referencing here."

battlebots,3e0eyf,ZetaGator,8,Tue Jul 21 17:50:16 2015 UTC,"You could build a functional low budget bot for a few thousand dollars with a cutoff wheel, drill, and welder. The electronics, batteries, and motors will be the most expensive. You have to buy the radio controller too...  Once you start having parts cut on a CNC mill/waterjet, you need to pay for it, or know somebody willing to help. Some of these guys work at companies which sponsor the bot by giving them access to their machine shop after hours. Even with free access to these tools, the materials are going to cost you. If you start doing some engineering and figure a special/specific material will do a better job, it's going to cost you a lot more than some generic steel from your local scrap yard. Look up metal prices on sites like McMaster or MetalsDepot for 2in aluminum plate or any titanium, and you'll start to get an idea how expensive just the raw materials are.  Also, you should have spares of everything for when it inevitably is smashed to pieces by tombstone or icewave.  A more realistic number would be around $10k."

battlebots,3e0eyf,sarahbau,8,Tue Jul 21 15:12:08 2015 UTC,"/u/TheShortWalk has provided some solid advice for building a competent and dependable robot by shopping smart. I tend to fly in the opposite direction and am only able to view figures like $10,000 as ""like almost half a new car"". I see robot combat as a souped up demolition derby, and derby cars are dirt cheap. I say, if I can buy a car that barely runs for around $1,000 and smash it to hell, then I can build a robot for around that much and do the same thing.  I pick parts, which has its own school of thought surrounding it. Finding replacement parts might be difficult, but for this reason as a picker I suggest going with  motors and parts that are mass-manufactured and streamlined for the most part. Windshield wiper and starter motors for cars tend to not change much, especially if you pick parts from cars from the same manufacturer. Cordless drills also tend to not have a lot of variance. Lots of bots use NPC motors from motorized wheelchairs. These can also be picked for the cheap if their condition is bad (you only need the motors who cares what the seat looks like) and you might also be able to nab one for a couple hundred bucks or less on Craigslist too.  I'll admit, when picking parts it's best to buy new batteries and a radio system, unless you can find a used radio for cheap. I wouldn't trust used batteries. Then again I'm afraid of batteries so for all I know part picking them is safe.  The downside to part picking is overall bot reliability, but a big plus is that you're out far less money in the event of a motor failure or other significant damage and you can bring multiple replacements if you need to. Scrapyards are pretty generous with giving things away too, so if you're lucky you can get a whole bunch of interesting stuff for cheap."
battlebots,3e0eyf,Mirechath,6,Tue Jul 21 01:06:12 2015 UTC,Batteries:  I'm an R/C enthusiast. My hobby has transitioned mostly to LiPo's in both air and land craft although I still make my son run NiMH packs in his truck (He's 8 and doesn't have the control yet to handle the extra power). Assuming bots have switched to LiPo or similar I generally wouldn't buy them used either. Too many variables involved and you really don't know how the previous owner charged or stored them.
battlebots,3e0eyf,markymark_inc,5,Tue Jul 21 02:48:35 2015 UTC,"Assuming bots have switched to LiPo   I know ICEwave uses them. He had a LiPo fire in the first match. I think both Ray Billings and Matt Maxham have said they don't use LiPo for that reason. I think a lot of builders use LiFePo now, which is slightly less power density than LiPo, but less risky."
battlebots,3e0eyf,teamtestbot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:30:16 2015 UTC,There are also some events that ban LiPo batteries. Franklin Institute is one because a battery fire in the middle of a museum is really bad.
battlebots,3e0eyf,whitefalconiv,6,Tue Jul 21 13:18:28 2015 UTC,"Average cost is probably $5000 - $10000 for just what is on the bot alone. Add in at least that much again for spare parts, tools, machining, and parts that are purchased but don't end up working out with the design.  If you already had a bunch of tools, had access to welding and machining facilities, utilized scrounged and ebay parts, and had a fairly flexible design, you could probably build a semi competitive heavyweight bot for $2000 or so."
battlebots,3e0eyf,MustBeNice,17,Tue Jul 21 01:40:54 2015 UTC,"Overhaul was one of the more low-budget productions and I would total the build cost at ""over $9000"".  This includes: Everything on the bot, the spare drive pods, 2 additional spare motors, 2 additional spare ESC units, spare battery, spare materials and premade frame pieces.  It doesn't even include: Service toolkit, charging system (borrowed from our own stock), travel costs not covered by ABC/BB. Including these, the total is over $13,000."

I went something like 14-2 with a middleweight that cost $500 - most of it was recycled/reclaimed gear.

battlebots,3e12nh,andrewpe,6,Tue Jul 21 03:30:24 2015 UTC,Some of those stats seem off. I feel like they rated some of them based on popularity. Like warhead for example. His weapon is rated that high? No way.
battlebots,3e12nh,Rflkt,6,Tue Jul 21 03:55:31 2015 UTC,warhead also faced the two best spinner defencive bots if anything it's the control stat that's bullshit.
battlebots,3e12nh,Gitguds,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:27:00 2015 UTC,"For spinners the weapon stat is fairly easy to calculate - work out the amount of kinetic energy in the weapon. Warhead's dome is 25kg (55lbs) and being circular, rather than a bar, means the moment of inertia is closer to the edge.  I think only Tombstone's weapon was heavier (65lbs) and possibly Nightmare.  I'm fairly certain that Biteforce stated that Warhead did damage them, and as Warhead spent most of the time on its back against Stinger it was never delivering any blows.  We know that Stinger as Sewer Snake often beats Tombstone as Last Rites, and there's a 50/50 chance that Biteforce will end up playing Tombstone (either in the final or the 3rd/4th playoff) so if that happens it will be interesting to see how much damage it can do.  My feeling is that Warhead got really unlucky with its draw as it went up against bots where it was unable to show what it could do. Had it had Counter Revolution and Radioactive it would have dished out similar damage to Tombstone."

battlebots,3e0f7z,KCIV,9,Tue Jul 21 00:22:54 2015 UTC,"Back in the CC days the fight stats weren't necessarily arbitrary. Things like ""slams"" (running opponents into the spike strip) and hazard damage were kept track of and did carry some weight in making decisions. Most of the time, Comedy Central used the same or similar numbers that the judges were taking, but sometimes took some liberties (like giving Killerhurtz 1 ""decapitation"" point in its fight against Knome II). I don't like that the judges' decisions in this season feel like secrets.  Also yes, I can't stand the ""tale of the tape"" numbers they use. They mean nothing other than to help viewers who don't know much about robotics to understand strengths and weak points in an extremely general sense. Even then they aren't reliable because Ghost Raptor lost its weapon and the hosts have had to preface the stats with a disclaimer that the ""weapon"" rating doesn't factor in the lack of a blade twice now (three times I'm sure, now that Ghost Raptor is moving on)."

CC used numbers mostly to make the fight summaries a bit more clear and the battle stats normally came close to the judge's scores given in most cases.
battlebots,3dyv00,EviRs18,47,Mon Jul 20 17:26:20 2015 UTC,"Yes!  I went to that battle with my son, and we were sitting in the bleachers on the left side (from the camera's POV, a bit behind the drivers.) We didn't see the blade break, but we definitely heard it--it sounded like a shot. It hit right on the door on the left side of the platform by the drivers, and it actually cracked the glass. You could see the star from where we were sitting.  We immediately moved up the bleachers a bit after that, actually.  I was wondering if ABC was going to show the damage to the wall."
battlebots,3dyv00,tomchaps,11,Mon Jul 20 17:47:59 2015 UTC,"Lexan (polycarbonate plastic), not glass, but yeah. One year a piece of Nightmare made it through the roof and into the audience (no one was hurt), so it has happened. I don't know about now, but the thickness of the walls used to vary: lower wall > upper wall > roof"
battlebots,3dyv00,droopyGT,17,Mon Jul 20 21:25:57 2015 UTC,"Interestingly Nightmare is the reason the Battlebox had a roof in the first place. In the '99 Long Beach event, he was only allowed to compete if the blade spun in reverse because it was slinging debris up into the air."

battlebots,3dyv00,sarahbau,4,Mon Jul 20 23:50:45 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about differing strengths of metal, but I can only imagine that blade is some of the toughest availible.   That's one of the one-piece bars, so it's almost certainly S7 tool steel. S7 is very popular for making spinning weapons out of. It doesn't have an especially high impact toughness overall, but it does have pretty much the best impact toughness of any readily available material when hardened to >50 HRC (higher hardness means your blade is less vulnerable to chipping on sharp edges, but the material is more brittle). The only materials that beat it at high hardnesses are exotic alloys like Aermet 100 which are extremely expensive and would be very difficult to find in quantities suitable for a heavyweight's weapon bar.  Other materials sometimes used for weapons are Chromoly steels and spring steel, both of which are tougher than S7 but can't reach as high a hardness. It's also common for spinning weapons to be made mostly of aluminum or titanium with S7 teeth."

They said that they come into play ""60 seconds into a match"". Good timing telling us that, right before the season ends. The deployment speed and frequency the killsaws come into play might as well be non-existent.   Also, what's the deal with that little area in one of the corners that the bots can actually push an opponent out of the ring? This came into play in two of the fights in episode 5 and they barely even recognized that prior to this episode.  Was there a point in any of the episodes where they give an overview of the battlebox and the rules?  They should have done that in episode 1.

battlebots,3dxsf6,thisdesignup,43,Mon Jul 20 12:23:03 2015 UTC,"Stepfather team member here. The downsides have been summed up pretty well in other comments here (lower traction, no redundancy, complexity, higher weight, lower robustness, etc.). The four wheels, without motors or gearboxes, weigh a total of 64 pounds. Even for a superheavyweight, that is a lot of weight to give up. Also, the custom metal parts alone for each wheel cost over $1000.  About the only actual fighting advantage is they allow us to keep the heavily reinforced, half-inch thick titanium parts at the front of the bot pointed at the opponent quite well. By comparison, the rest of the bot was lightly armored.   We only used this kind of drive because it looks so cool. We honestly never expected to win any fights. We only wanted to last long enough that people said ""Holy shit, that is cool!"" a few times before we died."

That is why AS never made it on TV."

battlebots,3dxsf6,personizzle,9,Mon Jul 20 18:15:50 2015 UTC,Those wheels wouldn't last two seconds in combat. Superheavyweight combat construction and durability requirements are on a whole other plane of existence from FRC.
battlebots,3dxsf6,krellsteel,3,Mon Jul 20 19:44:02 2015 UTC,The bent sheet metal construction of the commercial mecanum wheels are good for keeping the costs down and could be fine in applications outside of heavyweight combat.

battlebots,3dxsf6,Mirechath,16,Wed Jul 22 00:46:21 2015 UTC,"Mostly weight and complexity. You now have to have 4 motors with 4 heavy wheels and a suspension system to keep all wheels in contact as best as you can. Also, the wheels that are 2-3X heavier than just typical wheels are also more fragile and prone to breaking. So you really need to protect them as best as possible.   Biggest, redundancy. Stinger is the best example of this. At least one set of wheels gets messed up every fight he's in it seems. They are completely exposed and take plenty of abuse. So he put 6 on there so that he can loose 2 sets a side and still be mobile. With Mecanum wheels and holonomic drive, you have 0 redundancy. It is a very tricky balance you have to strike. Alcoholic Stepfather custom made their own wheels and rollers to take the abuse and not be that heavy. In the 250lb class, that's your only real option for those wheels."
battlebots,3dxsf6,Remigus,7,Mon Jul 20 12:39:19 2015 UTC,"None the less, that thing is gorgeous."
battlebots,3dxsf6,Mirechath,5,Mon Jul 20 14:16:50 2015 UTC,Agreed. I'm actually picking out parts and trying to design a holonomic drive bot myself in the smaller weight classes because I think it'll be tons of fun to drive and will be something different. I think it's a great idea if you can get it to function as well as they have.
battlebots,3dxsf6,Okamifan1,2,Mon Jul 20 14:44:22 2015 UTC,Exactly my thoughts :P I wasn't thinking about effectiveness or practicality but I was thinking purely for the show. Right now we have effective and practical and it isn't the most interesting when it comes to bot fights. It would be fun to see people take a bit more of a risk and get more creative with the bots. Although I guess I need to realize there are reasons such as time constraints for why creativity didn't happen as much. Still would have been nice.
battlebots,3dxsf6,krellsteel,4,Mon Jul 20 15:04:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah but you have to remember this is one of the bots that have beaten Tombstone when it was a SuperHeavyWeight, which puts it in the same league as Witch Doctor who came close."
battlebots,3dxsf6,Valzy,7,Mon Jul 20 15:55:49 2015 UTC,"It surprised the crap out of us both times we beat SHW Tombstone. However, regardless of our cool drive, we are just a wedge/brick, and well-designed bricks generally do well against spinners. Manipulators and flippers tend to mop the floor with us. Such is the rock/paper/scissors nature of well designed bots."
battlebots,3dxsf6,Mirechath,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:59:40 2015 UTC,"Holonomic drives have redundancy. As long as the drive still has 2 powered wheels, it can be driven controllably."
battlebots,3dxsf6,Valzy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:42:00 2015 UTC,"It can be driven as a tank style. You are correct that technically it does.   Just remember, you can't just use the typical one stick steering unless you set it up as such. The most intuitive set up, at least what all the game designers use in their games, has the forward, reverse, and strafe commands on one stick. You would want to practice tank driving the bot and would need to know you can't translate sideways if you lose a wheel. It could certainly be done, just would need to be practiced or a program set up with a spare channel, if you had one, to switch."
battlebots,3dxsf6,Mirechath,2,Mon Jul 20 21:09:01 2015 UTC,"I thought 2 stick steering was the norm with omni wheels. One stick is used to control linear movement and the other to control rotational movement.   A 4 wheel holonomic drive that has lost 1 wheel would still retain its ability to move omnidirectionally, but would have to be programmed to correct for the lost for the lost motor."
battlebots,3dxsf6,ZetaGator,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:55:40 2015 UTC,"Last I knew it was similar to video games. One stick moves in one plane and the other pivots. You can't get there axis movement from one stick. Tank style typically is one stick and you get forward, reverse, and turning on that one stick. At least from what I know, which isn't as hands on as I'd like.  Losing one motor would make attempting to strafe rotate your bot as well because you'd have nothing keeping it in check for one direction."
battlebots,3dxsf6,krellsteel,7,Mon Jul 20 22:40:40 2015 UTC,"Gonna be a stickler here and point out that I think Alcoholic Stepfather's wheels are called ""Mecanum"" wheels. Omni-directional wheels do not have powered individual rollers if I remember correctly. But yes, they are a complicated mess mostly because it messes with your head and makes it hard to maintain your forward heading.  As for durability, Donald Hutson used Omni wheels in the middleweight version of Root Canal and the tires ended up getting broken by a thwack bot that hit it just right. Razer also uses Omni wheels for its rear tires to allow for better handling, and I believe at one point the saw blade on Pussycat just shredded them to bits."
battlebots,3dxsf6,droopyGT,7,Mon Jul 20 16:42:48 2015 UTC,"You are right that our wheels are Mecanum, not omni. And as odd as it is to wrap your head around, the rollers are not powered but rather are free to spin about their own axes."
battlebots,3dxsf6,ZetaGator,5,Mon Jul 20 18:02:09 2015 UTC,Quit wasting time here and go write the update for Ep 5. Thank you. ;-)
battlebots,3dxsf6,droopyGT,5,Mon Jul 20 17:47:58 2015 UTC,LMAO  I am work right now. :( I've gotten as far as I can get without having the episode downloaded locally for me to rewind and watch five more times. :P

battlebots,3dxsf6,picklesitter,6,Mon Jul 20 18:47:48 2015 UTC,"these wheels tend to have worse traction, reliability, and weight than their normal counterparts."
battlebots,3dxsf6,krellsteel,5,Mon Jul 20 13:00:12 2015 UTC,"They're very, very difficult to get right. Alcoholic stepfather is the only one that has so far. They're difficult to build, and they're fragile because you need all 4 running to be able to steer."
battlebots,3dxsf6,EntropyInTheUK,5,Mon Jul 20 15:42:56 2015 UTC,"Although this thread has mainly dealt with holonomic drive systems, I think that the main point you want discussed is why don't we see more bots doing unusual things (drive systems, weapons, strategy, etc.) on the show.  I think that there are two main reasons for this: resources and adoption.  Resources: In these weight classes, as everyone knows, bots are very expensive. It is exceedingly rare that you will find a builder willing to foot the bill for something of this magnitude, especially if research and development is involved, with little more than a slight hope for marginal functionality. Alcoholic Stepfather's development took years and also a major chunk of stock-option fueled dollars to perfect. Imagine trying to find someone willing to spend this time or money when the most likely outcome will be embarrassment in arena.  Adoption: In the early days of BattleBots, many different concepts were tried. Those configurations that fared well were emulated and refined. Those that didn't were abandoned. There are now fewer and fewer even marginally viable concepts that have not been tried. Worse yet, those novel concepts are now going against bots that are about as optimized in their methodologies as the rules allow. If by chance some new or modified technique is shown to be effective, it will be adopted by enough other builders so it quickly becomes less novel. Combat events have been going on many times per year across the country during all of the years that BattleBots has been off the air, so the bot designs have evolved and adopted effective concepts. Novel but effective designs become commonplace fairly quickly when they emerge.  This is not to say that we should not fight for novel approaches, perhaps with rules that allow different weapons, but it is unlikely that the novel bots will make it very far in a competition.  Just my two cents…"
battlebots,3dxsf6,hoja_nasredin,2,Tue Jul 21 04:02:17 2015 UTC,Mecanum wheels on a killsaw?  No thanks!
battlebots,3dxsf6,krellsteel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:55:01 2015 UTC,Stupid question from somebody that just recently discovered Battlebots.  WHy wasn't Alcoholic Stepfather in this year competition?
battlebots,3dxsf6,chimphunter,2,Wed Jul 22 00:31:49 2015 UTC,We weren't invited. I don't know why. Could be because we haven't fought in many years.
battlebots,3dxsf6,joverla,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:49:32 2015 UTC,Was just thinking how much more interesting it could be if the bots had a bit more creative features. Sure Alcoholic Stepfather is only a wedge but the driving is very cool. Right now we had 3 wedge like bots and a spinner in the finale. Can't say it makes for the most interesting of fights. There is not even a lot of destruction for interest except from the spinner bot.
battlebots,3dxsf6,chimphunter,11,Mon Jul 20 12:24:26 2015 UTC,"I was (at the time) co-captain of a FIRST robotics team that tried swerve drive/omni-wheels.   That shit is difficult as fuck to program, hard to build, and harder to make reliable.   Even without active destruction it was still difficult to get our bot to run right."
battlebots,3dxsf6,Mirechath,3,Mon Jul 20 12:40:25 2015 UTC,I was on a FIRST team. We did a mechanum drive system on our second year without to much difficulty. Never when back. The maneuverability of that type of system is very helpful in a game style of robotics.
battlebots,3dxsf6,krellsteel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:03:48 2015 UTC,We never tried mechanum because we tried swerve. Think we would of been better off doing that.
battlebots,3dxsf6,Mirechath,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:38:33 2015 UTC,"Understandable, I could see that being a challenge in itself to make it work properly. I didn't mean to say bots need Omni-directional wheels just that it would have been cool to see more creative features on bots during the season. I do realize there are reasons that didn't happen though like time constraints and such."
battlebots,3dxsf6,EccentricWyvern,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:08:27 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you want to get into this, but there are mixers available out there for Mecanum and Omni style drive.

battlebots,3dxsf6,picklesitter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:31:29 2015 UTC,"I wasn't aware of those commercially available mixers. If they existed when we built AS, we sure didn't know about them! Thanks for the information."
battlebots,3dzrwf,JD9940,14,Mon Jul 20 21:17:28 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily, when ICEWave did an AMA a while back they said that they played some random matches after the tournament was over, so the picture could've been from one of the exhibition matches. I guess you'll have to wait till next week to see."
battlebots,3dzrwf,pakman62897,7,Mon Jul 20 22:28:39 2015 UTC,"I also think there's a chance that the fire extinguisher shot was purely for the sake of B-roll, partially because I don't know if Tombstone is even capable of catching on fire, especially when he's not up against an opponent with a flamethrower. Maybe they had teams with functional bots at the end of the tournament in the box afterwards just to grab some footage."
battlebots,3dzrwf,206-Ginge,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:55:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah short of a LiPO exploding, I doubt Tombstone can catch on fire easily."
battlebots,3dzrwf,pakman62897,11,Tue Jul 21 14:21:06 2015 UTC,"There's more info that can be gleaned from that.  Tombstone on that trailer has a dent on its right rear plate, and is using a red bar.  Episode 5 has images with a dent on the same place late-match, indicating the fight happened after it took that damage.  Backtracing, it turns out the dent is already there during the fight against Counter Revolution.  This implies the bot was damaged before the televised parts of the tournament, either through that match or by something else.  The interviewer asks after the match against Witch Doctor whether that bar breaking was a first. The driver's answer says they were down to one weapon choice.  Earlier on episode 5, Tombstone's fluff shows a table with 3 blade options: the short, angled black bar (lost on the fight against Witch Doctor), a red bar (shown on the trailer not only on that spoiler image, but also hitting against Bronco as well), and the long, flat bar used against Counter Revolution and Radioactive.  The answer given by Ray after Witch Doctor's fight indicates they've somehow deemed the long bar lost between the fights against Radioactive and Witch Doctor.  tl;dr:   Tombstone was already dented before the tournament began Tombstone was shown having 3 bar choices When asked if the blade breaking was a first, they said they were down to one weapon choice The first bar choice was used against Radioactive Therefore, Tombstone's bar on the start of the tournament was deemed unusable between the fight against Radioactive and the fight against Witch Doctor   I don't know what to make of all of this. Either Tombstone somehow cracked the first blade by using it against Radioactive, there was an untelevised match between these fights where it was lost, or ABC meddled around with the bracket big time."

That's the only outlier that I was able to notice, though, but it does kind of prove they have some footage from other matches that haven't been shown."

battlebots,3dzrwf,johnnyd1988,7,Tue Jul 21 02:03:47 2015 UTC,"all good points.  normally i hate looking at previews and stuff, but now my interest is piqued.  from the preview at the end of yesterdays episode, it shows bronco missing one or both wheel guards and also at least one entire wheel, sitting stationary and alone in the box, with team inertia cheering. no other bot is visible but i dont see GR or BF doing that kind of damage. i get the impression this clip is from the end of the fight against tombstone, but the timer still shows 50s left so maybe a KO one way or the other (again, inertia was cheering, even though bronco looked mangled and was not moving during the ~1s clip, so certainly cant read anything conclusive into it..  Whatever happens its gonna be a hell of a fight."
battlebots,3dzrwf,allyourphil,3,Tue Jul 21 03:25:29 2015 UTC,Where are people seeing all of these end of episode clips? Maybe the west coast broadcast sucks because there are absolutely no previews.

battlebots,3dzrwf,coonster,5,Tue Jul 21 02:04:16 2015 UTC,"Biteforce seems to be at one of the arena's squares.  According to their AMA, they did it on the fight against overhaul to demonstrate it was still mobile, so it's possible to assume they've won."
battlebots,3dzrwf,RA2lover,4,Tue Jul 21 03:07:39 2015 UTC,Maybe not! I mean how do they do the finals in the show? A57 minutes of fluff for a 3 minute fight?   Is it possible the bots battle for more than one round?
battlebots,3dzrwf,Elementium,4,Mon Jul 20 22:46:46 2015 UTC,I think we still have to watch both finals and semifinals. So we have 4 matches without any extra bouts. Per usual.
battlebots,3dzrwf,VivaElToro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:49:56 2015 UTC,3 fights - two semis and the final. Plus some recaps and maybe a few grudge match highlights...
battlebots,3dzrwf,wzcx,2,Tue Jul 21 20:01:41 2015 UTC,The 4th match is the fight for 3rd place that must exist. It. Must. That's the only reason we see this blasphemy of tombstone vs biteforce.
battlebots,3dzrwf,VivaElToro,7,Wed Jul 22 03:42:59 2015 UTC,"They don't have a lot of B-roll to work with yet, sadly. It may not be so much a bad strategy to release early footage as it is their ONLY strategy.  Considering the backlash the 'filler' gets on the show; imagine a trailer or promo that features no robot fighting at all.  These promos may also be designed so that it is made difficult to visually process exact details. Perhaps not even intended to be seen multiple times at 1 frame per second and meticulously combed over for clues. Clues that would have been vague clashes of color and chaos previously.   Breaking down trailers/promos is kinda like modifying a fireman's saw. It was clearly not designed for that purpose and now its being used to dissect. Using powerful things in ways other than their intended purpose can be hazardous."

battlebots,3dzrwf,Gitguds,3,Tue Jul 21 16:15:40 2015 UTC,considering the dumb fucks at ABC showed both warhead matches to prove the wildcard spoiler before the first ep even aired yes totally they spoilt the whole bracket. also nightmare had a grudge match against witchdr and we saw Iewave vs hypershock so that must've been the other grudge match.  since this is a spoiler thread yes ABC has shown us many of the outcomes including bronco's loss to tombstone and biteforce's inactive weapon disguised wedge bot beating tombstone.  i utterly hate ABC for this.

battlebots,3dzrwf,stipulation,-4,Mon Jul 20 23:34:11 2015 UTC,I don't think this is a spoiler. Tombstones blade has holes in it. It's main blade has zero holes and is steel colored. It seems like that might be from the witchdoctor fight?  Witchdoctor upside down about matches the profile of the robot we see in the background.
battlebots,3dzrwf,RA2lover,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:00:00 2015 UTC,earlier on episode 5 that trailer blade is shown along with the others.
battlebots,3dwdls,qwertythe300th,83,Mon Jul 20 02:15:11 2015 UTC,Witch Doctor was the true darkhorse for this show. They fought two Final Four bots and held their own for a while. I can't wait to see what they come up with next season.
battlebots,3dwdls,A_Windrammer,43,Mon Jul 20 02:20:30 2015 UTC,Not to mention their general spirit and showmanship. I like these guys.

battlebots,3dwdls,stratusgratis,43,Mon Jul 20 02:49:09 2015 UTC,only team besides overhaul to have a theme.   With the added benefit that their theme did not make me want to commit ritual suicide. The skull on their drum was fantastic.
battlebots,3dwdls,BrainSlurper,7,Mon Jul 20 04:34:42 2015 UTC,The skull was the drum.
battlebots,3dwdls,Rackintosh,3,Mon Jul 20 17:52:14 2015 UTC,"Well yeah obviously, I am referring to how they painted it"
battlebots,3dwdls,BrainSlurper,12,Mon Jul 20 18:23:15 2015 UTC,WITCH DOCTOR AMA. NOW.
battlebots,3dwdls,CantRap,11,Mon Jul 20 07:56:48 2015 UTC,For real. It seems like losing the spinner and getting perched on the blade and their two legs at the top was the one failure mode they didn't consider.
battlebots,3dwdls,ElectricNed,20,Mon Jul 20 02:39:00 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that it only could fall into this position with the extra front weight they added to protect against Tombstone.
battlebots,3dwdls,personizzle,6,Mon Jul 20 02:42:48 2015 UTC,Good point.
battlebots,3dwdls,ElectricNed,11,Mon Jul 20 02:44:46 2015 UTC,"Had Shaman not been down for the count, I think this would have been a KO in Witch Doctor's favor. I believe part of the minibot's purpose is to help Witch Doctor self-right.  The addition of the extra front armor's weight, along with the loss of the minibot, left WD with no self-righting mechanism. Had WD not taken that last big hit and gotten turtled, Tombstone would have been torn apart."
battlebots,3dwdls,HighOverlordXenu,10,Mon Jul 20 10:40:59 2015 UTC,"Before they showed the fight Ray Billings said he was most afraid of Shaman. Yes, the multibot could have whacked at them to try and rock them back down. The real threat though is the one I said days ago in my predictions. Shaman is tough to keep track of with Witch Doctor running around. So you lose sight of him for a moment, then he's under your wheels (Bronco) and with Tombstone, that's very likely your blade digging into the floor and you flying across the arena. Quite possibly without WD or Shaman getting hit.   That little bot could have been the MVP!"
battlebots,3dwdls,Mirechath,40,Mon Jul 20 12:30:26 2015 UTC,"Yep. I was kinda impressed with WD in its first fights, I definitely thought they deserved the wild card (Bronco was just a HORRIBLE matchup for them) but I was expecting it to get knocked around by tombstone and not do much in return, maybe even spend most of the match fleeing. TOTALLY surprised by its aggressiveness.  They've got a solid design and they're actually competent drivers. I saw they were making sure that Tombstone's blade glanced off their ramp at an angle to keep it from hitting anything vital.  When the blade broke I was sold completely. First bot I really feel like rooting for, as it really fills the perfect underdog role.   Edit: watching the fight agaom the final hit that flipped WD, they didn't have their spinner spun up, which is probably why they got flipped like they did. With the spinner going I'd wager the gyroscopic effects make it way more stable."
battlebots,3dwdls,Faceh,11,Mon Jul 20 02:40:04 2015 UTC,"I was expecting it to get knocked around by tombstone and not do much in return, maybe even spend most of the match fleeing. TOTALLY surprised by its aggressiveness.   I mean, the way you beat tombstone is not by getting around it (nearly impossible with a good driver), it's going head-on and hoping you're better armored so that Tombstone destroys itself. They did pick the right strategy, but it was also the obvious strategy if you watch Tombstone on youtube."
battlebots,3dwdls,picklesitter,8,Mon Jul 20 13:34:33 2015 UTC,"They had some serious faith in their armor, is what I'm saying, which appeared to be justified. After seeing them get flung around by bronco I didn't expect their little guy to take a punch that well.   Its kinda of like an all-or-nothing strategy (hell, Tombstone itself is an all-or-nothing strategy). There was no way to know if/when the blade would shatter, and every attack was risking a hit to something vital. They drove really, really well, which is were a lot of my admiration comes from."
battlebots,3dwdls,qwertpoi,3,Mon Jul 20 15:22:54 2015 UTC,"After seeing them get flung around by bronco I didn't expect their little guy to take a punch that well.   Wedges work so well against horizontal spinners because when the bar hits the wedge, it pushes the wedged bot down while lifting the spinner. That's why it was so stable vs Tombstone. Against Bronco, though, that's just a few thousands of pounds of lifting force coming from the bottom. No real way to brace against that."
battlebots,3dwdls,sarahbau,2,Mon Jul 20 20:41:22 2015 UTC,"They did manage to maneuver quite well, especially with Tombstone being so maneuverable."
battlebots,3dwdls,picklesitter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:39:34 2015 UTC,I thought the vertical spinner did most of the work of making Tombstone fly around like a deflating party balloon.  It's basically like hitting a cymbal with a drumstick.
battlebots,3dwdls,Baryshnikov_Rifle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:07:00 2015 UTC,"Horizontal spinners are their own worst enemy. Look at every single one in the competition. The recoil from their hits is so severe, that it's a 50/50 chance they'll damage themselves more than their opponent. Every time witch doctor or icewave landed a punch, they just went flying across the room.  If witch doctor hadn't flipped, it would have won that match because tombstone was SOL with that broken blade. I was very impressed with witch doctor because it was able to take some serious licks."
battlebots,3dwdls,jmanpc,27,Tue Jul 21 13:46:40 2015 UTC,"I will say 1 positive thing about Chuck. It looks like GR is defensively built very well. The main chassis seems sturdy. Looks like he put most of his attention into that. Certainly an improvement over Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Tripulta in that regard."
battlebots,3dwdls,FaceBagman,23,Mon Jul 20 02:29:39 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong on this but I remember him saying he'd been building the 'chassis' for years, while the weapon was put together in a couple of weeks. Also his previous bots were all wedge designs?  Basically it seems he was trying to design an uber wedge but the new season's battlebots demands made him stick on a spinner, made out of shitty sheet metal that probably weighs like 40lbs, motor and all. With the spinner gone he's back to being a decent wedge bot and can make better use of the extra 30lbs.  The spinner just got him onto the show."
battlebots,3dwdls,MajesticCount,5,Mon Jul 20 04:37:00 2015 UTC,"I mean he could've just used a lifting wedge, like Stinger had. It would count as an active weapon. IMO what he has now is an active weapon since he can shove opponents upwards to try to get them out of the arena or into hazards."
battlebots,3dwdls,Xciv,4,Mon Jul 20 08:30:12 2015 UTC,"My guess is that since bot designs had to be approved, he wanted to make it look impressive. Matt probably had tons of videos of Sewer Snake doing handsprings over the opponent using that wedge flipper."
battlebots,3dwdls,sarahbau,8,Mon Jul 20 20:46:59 2015 UTC,"Apart from Alpha Raptor vs. Backlash, I don't think any of Pitzer's lightweights ever got 'ripped apart', and he had to fight Ziggo that one season."
battlebots,3dwdls,ZeroAce11,4,Mon Jul 20 05:38:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah. And he got to the lightweight championship, so Alpha raptor was obviously pretty good."

battlebots,3dwdls,FaceBagman,12,Mon Jul 20 16:18:18 2015 UTC,Yup. A lesson well and painfully learned.
battlebots,3dwdls,ForceAndFury,3,Mon Jul 20 02:50:48 2015 UTC,I said this before  They are more sophisticated then they look on the surface.

battlebots,3dwdls,stratusgratis,40,Mon Jul 20 02:39:57 2015 UTC,"Tombstone got lucky, if WD hadn't flipped on that very last hit it wouldn't have won.  Tombstone's weapon was disabled and it looked like Witch Doctor's drive train was still running on all 4 wheels"
battlebots,3dwdls,shadowblade945,19,Mon Jul 20 03:07:31 2015 UTC,WDs weapon was also broken. Watch it again. Their spinner isnt moving before the last hit.
battlebots,3dwdls,Nsongster,13,Mon Jul 20 04:31:10 2015 UTC,"That is not necessarily true. They do not keep the thing spun up all the time because it makes it much harder to turn. It could have been broken, but they wouldn't have been running it at that point in the fight anyways."
battlebots,3dwdls,BrainSlurper,19,Mon Jul 20 04:40:51 2015 UTC,Even if it was broken I don't think it would have been any trouble for 4WD Witch Doctor to push Tombstone pretty much wherever they wanted.  Tombstone doesn't have anything to fall back on without its spinner.
battlebots,3dwdls,shadowblade945,6,Mon Jul 20 05:49:38 2015 UTC,Especially considering one has a wedge and one doesn't. Getting under your opponent gives you traction and diminishes theirs.
battlebots,3dwdls,Mirechath,7,Mon Jul 20 12:01:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess. But then again is it really luck that they designed their bot without a way to address being flipped over? It's a common enough occurrence and yet many bot builders seem to think it will never happen to them."
battlebots,3dwdls,Tetragramatron,7,Mon Jul 20 12:21:12 2015 UTC,"While I ultimately agree, we saw it get flipped over in earlier battles and it was able to right itself then. I think they did design with that in mind, but you can't plan for every contingency."
battlebots,3dwdls,Faceh,6,Mon Jul 20 15:24:57 2015 UTC,"I agree wholeheartedly. Their bot's self-righting mechanism wasn't the best, and so here we are. Part of the competition is design, not just driving/strategy the day of.    yet many bot builders seem to think it will never happen to them   Speaking of Icewave..."

battlebots,3dwdls,RA2lover,4,Mon Jul 20 14:30:26 2015 UTC,"To be fair, they probably were counting on having shaman there to help them flip back over when required, and they wouldn't have landed in that position if it weren't for that wedge they tacked on at the last minute."
battlebots,3dwdls,TheGuyWithFace,2,Mon Jul 20 14:28:22 2015 UTC,"AFAIK the bars would be able to make the bot invertible on its rear wheels - it just got unlucky enough to fall at the wrong angle. Although the spinner could have a chance at flipping it to a side it could move, it either wasn't powerful enough to work or outright failed before/during the collision."
battlebots,3dwdls,RA2lover,8,Mon Jul 20 14:29:42 2015 UTC,"They posted this on Facebook:  ""The weapon got jammed on one of the last hits, so when we flipped over we actually got stuck on the weapon disk!"""
battlebots,3dwdls,MajesticCount,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:23:46 2015 UTC,They designed it to run with a mini bot that I think can help flip the main one back on its wheels.  Hopefully they will bring an extra one with them next season

I was hoping with the smallest bit of my heart they could pull that upset, despite realistically knowing their chances were slim. To see them control the match made me extremely giddy, it would have been the first time I'd have been happy being wrong with my predictions. But, sadly, they got flipped."

battlebots,3dwdls,Deserterdragon,2,Mon Jul 20 11:10:40 2015 UTC,"Sad thing is, I think if he's up against Biteforce he could end up in the final.  Ghost Raptor's big advantage is drivability and force."
battlebots,3dwdls,frogstomp427,0,Mon Jul 20 16:54:34 2015 UTC,"At this point, I think we should be looking at why they keep winning. The Icewave move was... well... pretty purpose built. Not necessarily good bot design in general. Last week seemed to be a matter of whose bot could go 3 minutes without catching on fire. I feel like they're just getting a bit lucky in general. If they manage to win the next fight, they are utterly and totally screwed."
battlebots,3dwdls,RazgrizSeed,4,Mon Jul 20 13:21:40 2015 UTC,Last week seemed to be a matter of whose bot could go 3 minutes without catching on fire.    The lower levels of the competition are ... less fun on TV.
battlebots,3dwdls,picklesitter,8,Mon Jul 20 13:45:11 2015 UTC,"Look at what With Doctor did to tombstone; I could see a similar scenario playing out with an up-armored Ghost Raptor. It's a well made bot at its core, even if the spinner looked like it came out of a happy meal."
battlebots,3dwdls,Tetragramatron,8,Mon Jul 20 12:36:56 2015 UTC,I bet they rotate that icebreaker and use it to catch the front frame area the spinner resides in.
battlebots,3dwdls,UselessGadget,3,Mon Jul 20 13:01:43 2015 UTC,That's would be interesting
battlebots,3dwdls,Tetragramatron,2,Mon Jul 20 13:17:23 2015 UTC,Are you sure they could do that without getting torn to bits?
battlebots,3dwdls,picklesitter,3,Mon Jul 20 13:46:50 2015 UTC,"Witch Doctor did pretty good and very few people thought they had a chance.  I imagine if they have something that they can use to push it around, they can make it self destruct."
battlebots,3dwdls,UselessGadget,4,Mon Jul 20 13:50:25 2015 UTC,"Same here. His whole 'bot reeks of over-engineered, and he was really, really cocky when they first interviewed him."
battlebots,3dwdls,picklesitter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:46:03 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how this subreddit all got behind ice wave so completely. It's a lawnmower engine bolted on top of a sliverbot with no structural cohesion and way more self destructive energy than it knows what to do with. Even if it absolutely liquifies the first several bots it encounters, not every hit is going to be a perfect one. Zero chance it makes it to finals."
battlebots,3dwdls,nopenopenopenoway,0,Tue Jul 21 07:43:38 2015 UTC,"Really? Is Icewave really that beloved? I'm more of a fan of Chuck and Ghost Raptor mainly because he seems like a genuine veteran that keeps pulling out wins. Same goes for Ray and Tombstone, except he looks like he's just having fun."
battlebots,3dwdls,Rackintosh,33,Mon Jul 20 18:01:29 2015 UTC,That's what I'm saying. I can remember a lot of bots back in the day using different attachments and such for different opponents and I never heard any bitching then. Redditors can get so salty over anything.  That was a smart as hell move by pitzer. If he didn't do that he would have lost.badly
battlebots,3dwdls,HikerAdam2,14,Mon Jul 20 02:19:17 2015 UTC,"Not really. The wedge affected ICE's balance on hit #2, not the new attachment."
battlebots,3dwdls,FaceBagman,9,Mon Jul 20 02:27:08 2015 UTC,I saw the de-icer keep holding onto the top of icewave. Without that icewave would have hit him long before he did if I had to guess.
battlebots,3dwdls,HikerAdam2,5,Mon Jul 20 02:30:12 2015 UTC,"Yep, but the first full-force hit is what ended the match by sending ICE reeling, more or less.  You could argue the fork indirectly helped because they had to keep the wedge up at that angle to stop GR from scraping the floor."
battlebots,3dwdls,FaceBagman,5,Mon Jul 20 02:33:45 2015 UTC,I'll agree it helped indirectly. Who knows what would have happened if raptor wasn't able to block that first hit.
battlebots,3dwdls,HikerAdam2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:46:42 2015 UTC,"Then again, if the hit had come straight on instead of off to the side because of the de-icer, would it have been able to flip it over, or would it have been more of a glancing blow? If the arm had moved up to try and deflect them higher straight on, would the blade have dug in and ripped it off instead of it being a side shot that puts them over on their head?  Was it the sole reason? Nope. But I can't tell you how much or how little of a role it played. It may well have been what won him the match indirectly by making Ice Wave unable to come at them from the front."
battlebots,3dwdls,Mirechath,2,Mon Jul 20 12:11:32 2015 UTC,"the blade rode up the wedge, the body got tilted up being carried by the tilted balde. bot topples over due to being unbalanced. it's pretty simple."

battlebots,3dwdls,KCIV,28,Mon Jul 20 03:47:49 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between general, pre-planned modularity, and explicit robot-counter designs.   Modularity is general purpose changeable configurations, designed to counter different archtypes of robots. See Bite Force and the Plow vs. Jaw, Stinger's forks, or Tombstone's different blades. This is pretty universally accepted.   What's pretty controversial (and I don't like in the slightest), is explicit ""Robot X Killer"" design. Generally, this completely takes away the spirit of your own robot design, in order to exploit a ""weakness"" of your opponent that really isn't there if, like any sane engineer facing the problem statement of ""Survive against/kill completely unknown robots,"" you assume that your opponents are built for general purpose rather than specifically to kill your robot and nothing else. See Tornado vs. Razer (and the never-ending controversy) for the classic example of this. Don't get me wrong, the innovation is impressive, but I think that it undermines the spirit of the design challenge and inherit tradeoffs posed by the combat robotics challenge."
battlebots,3dwdls,personizzle,30,Mon Jul 20 02:24:59 2015 UTC,"I consider it to be pretty much fair game in combat to make modifications based upon who you draw in the brackets. I've got several modular bots and I've got no problem saying that some attachments were designed with specific opponents in mind. That's one perk of modularity. I can also guarantee that a good portion of the bots at this season of BattleBots had a ""Tombstone Plan"" or if not that specifically, a horizontal spinner plan."
battlebots,3dwdls,MikeNCR,8,Mon Jul 20 02:28:45 2015 UTC,The same is true in all sports. The big slugger doesn't hit lefties well? Send one up. The running back is a speed machine? Time to put in the small quick linebackers.
battlebots,3dwdls,majinspy,9,Mon Jul 20 13:07:51 2015 UTC,"I did not like the mod Tornado made against Razer, but what Ghost Raptor did didn't make it unstoppable.  Icewave could have still gotten to the side or back of Ghost Raptor and gotten some hits in. The adaption worked beautifully and they did a great job coming up with it, but it didn't make GR invulnerable either."
battlebots,3dwdls,joecb91,4,Mon Jul 20 04:21:42 2015 UTC,"I agree that Icewave exhibited some really crappy driving that match -- it drove right into it.   Ghost Raptor definitely wasn't unbeatable, but the effectiveness of the mod isn't really what matters, it's the spirit of the thing."
battlebots,3dwdls,personizzle,6,Mon Jul 20 04:52:20 2015 UTC,"Not to mention the fact Icewave lacked the ability to do anything when flipped over. People give warhead shit, but it lasted the full 3:00 against two bots that would have take Icewave out in the first 20 seconds."
battlebots,3dwdls,Deserterdragon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:21:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's some relief in seeing someone else make this point. A lot of posters seem to look at a bots performance in a match without appreciating the variance in opponent difficulty."

battlebots,3dwdls,SoyDivisionIV,5,Mon Jul 20 10:51:08 2015 UTC,Anyone who had pre-planned modular designs probably had something in mind specifically for horizontal bar spinners (basically Tombstone). I don't think it's suddenly against the spirit of the competition just because Team Raptor made something on the fly.
battlebots,3dwdls,ZeroAce11,13,Mon Jul 20 05:32:58 2015 UTC,"I'm glad that someone smarter than me could put into words why I hate what I just saw.   What Ghost Raptor just did was just as cheap as putting a box with a net in it on the front of your robot to fight a spinner. It's not against the rules, it's just fucking cheap."
battlebots,3dwdls,SutterCane,25,Mon Jul 20 02:29:25 2015 UTC,"Not really. It's not even a novel idea. People have been doing similar things for years. I know folks did it against megabyte.  It's actually a pretty obvious weakness and somebody was bound to do it eventually.   Folks hate ghost raptor because it's a lame robot with a good driver who keeps getting lucky.  I wouldn't consider the de-icer out of line at all though, and I wanted to see ghost raptor get shredded as much as anybody."
battlebots,3dwdls,Spida-Mernkey,14,Mon Jul 20 03:25:38 2015 UTC,"Folks hate ghost raptor because it's a lame robot with a good driver who keeps getting lucky.   For me at least, it's because it's because in the Tested coverage before the first episode ran, he said ""this is the best engineered bot to ever enter the arena,"" or something to that effect. The very first time his blade hits something, it breaks in half because of the ""moving the weight to the outside"" he did by making it hollow. He boasted about it being better engineered than the others, but couldn't even withstand his own bot hitting something."
battlebots,3dwdls,sarahbau,6,Mon Jul 20 03:36:47 2015 UTC,Looks like all the talk of how well engineered it was was just... ... Spin.
battlebots,3dwdls,Tetragramatron,8,Mon Jul 20 12:41:12 2015 UTC,"Haha I have an old joke about folks only testing their spinners against watermelons, and this one perfectly fits the bill.  As for the trash talk, it's just trash talk to me.  They think they're supposed to, and they kind of are.  It's annoying, but it's TV after all."
battlebots,3dwdls,Spida-Mernkey,4,Mon Jul 20 03:43:56 2015 UTC,"Most people probably don't even really have a safe way of testing their spinners at full power. Building a battle box that can withstand their shrapnel can be more expensive than the bot itself. Even if it's just a 4x4x4 cube, that can be expensive. I can't find 1"" thick Lexan (which is still thinner than the Battle Box's 1.25""), but at $350 for a 48x48"" sheet 1/2"" thick, double paned, you'd need 10 of them, totaling $3,500. I guess if you found a really out of the way place, you could get away with crouching behind a single piece."

battlebots,3dwdls,sarahbau,7,Tue Jul 21 07:55:38 2015 UTC,The De-ICEer was not a big factor in the fight.      Ghost raptor took a full hit and sent Icewave on it's top..      From there it was all over.
battlebots,3dwdls,sschering,7,Mon Jul 20 05:31:26 2015 UTC,"So then Stinger changing it's weapons every round is also ""fucking cheap?"""
battlebots,3dwdls,SutterCane,-3,Mon Jul 20 13:05:12 2015 UTC,"Stinger, Bite Force, and others who brought attachment changes aren't cheap. People can easily just prepare for their attachments with their own because they know those other bots are modular.   What Ghost Raptor did was have something that was only meant to fight one bot and only one bot. And they did it with some metal just laying around. So there's literally no way to prepare against that. Just like there's no way to prepare against a net in a box. And wasn't the match redone because the net wasn't a declared weapon from the start of the competition? How is Ghost Raptor getting a pass for doing the same shit to another bot?"
battlebots,3dwdls,elcapitaine,2,Mon Jul 20 13:35:22 2015 UTC,"The net match being redone had nothing to do with ""declared weapons"" - it was because using a net is illegal. Now, had they declared it, the tournament organizers could have told them that it was against the rules. But the penalty had nothing to do with them not declaring their weapon."
battlebots,3dwdls,ThePurplePanzy,6,Mon Jul 20 18:55:18 2015 UTC,"So, by innovating and throwing together a brand new attachment from random stuff laying around in between fights is fucking cheap, and not an impressive feat of engineering and improvisation. Comparing this to the net in a box is just fucking stupid and mental gymnastics that I can't keep up with.  You're just salty that he beat one of your favourite bots, stop trying to make it seem like he did anything wrong. You sound like the kid who makes fun of the smart kids for getting an A+ on their test."
battlebots,3dwdls,Rflkt,2,Mon Jul 20 13:52:59 2015 UTC,It's just basic engineering really
battlebots,3dwdls,RazgrizSeed,3,Mon Jul 20 17:16:07 2015 UTC,"He lost his main weapon. If he still had it, there wouldn't have been a de-icer."
battlebots,3dwdls,Thats_absrd,-1,Mon Jul 20 05:57:53 2015 UTC,Well said. Much better than how I've been trying to explain it.
battlebots,3dwdls,Spidora19,2,Mon Jul 20 13:26:21 2015 UTC,I don't know that he still wouldn't have won without it actually.   Ice wave hit that front wedge and threw itself all over the place. I bet the de-icer really didn't make a difference on the outcome.
battlebots,3dwdls,Torchedini,8,Mon Jul 20 03:58:32 2015 UTC,Because they just had to watch their favorite bot get taken down so easily with a simple piece of shaped metal added at the last minute.

battlebots,3dwdls,freedomfightre,13,Mon Jul 20 06:25:28 2015 UTC,"His blade was really poorly designed, and he didn't even have a spare, apparently. He's lucked his way into victory with every match so far. ...and that's why he's unstoppable."

battlebots,3dwdls,RazgrizSeed,22,Mon Jul 20 02:36:39 2015 UTC,"I don't get the downvotes, the attachment was designed for a specific purpose and it completed it very well. That's the definition of good engineering."
battlebots,3dwdls,LUK3FAULK,3,Mon Jul 20 03:01:18 2015 UTC,"I think the reasoning is it somewhat goes tongue-in-cheek against the spirit of combat robotics. The general idea is to build a bot that can win over all of the other bots. Swapping things out for specific bots, although a legitimate strategy, makes some people feel cheated because it isn't a static design."
battlebots,3dwdls,ZapTap,4,Mon Jul 20 03:25:03 2015 UTC,I would have been more happy if it were a predesigned attachment rather than made right before for the specific match. I think they should make it so that all weapons must be approved before the tournament and only repaired or replaced. But what happened was completely legal so I'm ok with it.
battlebots,3dwdls,cochon101,8,Mon Jul 20 13:24:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm hesitant to praise it for stellar engineering, since it's a simple design that would be hard to mess up, but it was absolutely a fair win."
battlebots,3dwdls,Arcosah,15,Mon Jul 20 14:23:46 2015 UTC,"simple design that would be hard to mess up   As an engineer, that means it's a great design."
battlebots,3dwdls,KCIV,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:29:33 2015 UTC,"Because its not very fair that he got to build a part explicitly designed to beat icewave.

battlebots,3dwdls,GreenPylons,-4,Mon Jul 20 05:34:50 2015 UTC,"The design was not to make icewave flip. That is why you are being down voted. His win condition design was not in his win at all. rather a ""chaos theory"" result."
battlebots,3dwdls,BrainSlurper,11,Mon Jul 20 16:20:41 2015 UTC,"Flipping from Newton's Third Law is inherent to spinners (see Tombstone tonight), and the fact that Ice Wave cannot self-right was a massive design flaw on their part. There was much more to this than luck."
battlebots,3dwdls,KCIV,4,Mon Jul 20 03:47:11 2015 UTC,The point he is making is that the attachment did not let them win. Icewave's blade still made contact even when the fork was doing its job.
battlebots,3dwdls,Gitguds,3,Mon Jul 20 04:31:52 2015 UTC,"That was ice waves design, again not apart of ""rapters ingenuity""   I am fully aware of qualities natural to X bots design. But again those having nothing to do with Rapters adaptation. Rapter did not ""design"" a bot to make the Third law (that is absurd), He made a bot to keep icewave at bay, It didn't do that, and Third law let him win anyway.  don't get me wrong a win, is indeed a win, but to say ""tombstone vs witchdocter"" was anything but luck and ""rapter vs ice wave"" was anything but luck is just, not clearly analyzing the situation. That or they have a better understanding of Chaos theory."

battlebots,3dwdls,Randomwoegeek,7,Mon Jul 20 05:45:56 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. Flippers, lifters, and spinners have so much power now that every fight has the potential of your bot winding up on its back.

battlebots,3dwdls,Mirechath,6,Mon Jul 20 03:41:49 2015 UTC,"""That's not how I would want to win"" he says after being netted, proceeds to win the next two fights because the other robot self destructs"
battlebots,3dwdls,bochez,2,Mon Jul 20 03:58:57 2015 UTC,"What got the most about that comment was the bot itself. Before the tournament you're told that wedges and brick bots are not allowed. That is a HUGE boon to spinning robots. So what do you do? You build a spinner, the bot that has the odds skewed in your favor in the tournament because the bots that do the best against you are banned. And then you want to claim a higher moral ground that you wouldn't want to win by using the rules to your advantage? I mean, net is cheap and it should be outlawed, I am 100% against nets. But that comment made me actually laugh out loud. It's fine that you wanted to build a spinner, and I don't think he's some horrible person. It was just funny when he said it, at least to me. I commend him for making it this far in the competition. Though I hope next year the bot he builds holds together for him. He'll actually have time to build it, the whole thing, so it should be lots better."
battlebots,3dwdls,Mirechath,2,Mon Jul 20 04:42:06 2015 UTC,"The best part about this is he started as a spinner, but ultimately became a wedge (with an added pokey thing for this last fight)."
battlebots,3dwdls,mangodroplet,5,Mon Jul 20 12:27:52 2015 UTC,"Just goes to show the man knows how to build a chassis. Spinner? Not so much. :)  I remember his other bots very rarely failed, effective or not. He does know how to build a sturdy bot. He just needs practice with weaponry it seems."
battlebots,3dwdls,Rackintosh,3,Mon Jul 20 18:49:15 2015 UTC,That was an amazing fight. Witch Doctor ALL THE WAY!
battlebots,3dwdls,erconn,3,Mon Jul 20 18:57:41 2015 UTC,"Come on. If you can't admit that the strategy that Chuck and the Ghost Raptor team implemented wasn't brilliant and effective, you then have to admit you're being a sour fan of Icewave."
battlebots,3dwdls,chaosfire235,7,Mon Jul 20 04:11:54 2015 UTC,Ghost raptors mod was really clever. He deserved that win
battlebots,3dwdls,SparkleSorceress,3,Mon Jul 20 18:06:12 2015 UTC,"At this point I'm kinda rooting for him to win the entire thing (I known, not likely). It would be the ultimate underdog upset."
battlebots,3dwdls,legolots,3,Mon Jul 20 08:40:39 2015 UTC,"Dude, could you imagine the salt?  I mean, I respect Ghost Raptor, but if it wins I'll eat my own socks."
battlebots,3dwdls,SparkleSorceress,2,Mon Jul 20 19:29:43 2015 UTC,Tagged. I'll hold you to that!
battlebots,3dwdls,Rackintosh,2,Mon Jul 20 20:22:58 2015 UTC,I'm going to feel like that guy who said he was going to send a dick pic to his father-in-law.

battlebots,3dwdls,mossdog427,2,Mon Jul 20 18:04:03 2015 UTC,It was so close. Gotta have a self-righting mechanism.

battlebots,3dwet5,G_I_Joe_Mansueto,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:10:36 2015 UTC,"AFAIK the rules allow for untethered projectiles that don't damage or foul up the arena.  it doesn't allow for explosives, or self-destructing weapons though."
battlebots,3dwet5,RA2lover,2,Mon Jul 20 12:55:08 2015 UTC,Real question.  Can I fire a harpoon?
battlebots,3dwet5,Protosega,2,Mon Jul 20 17:04:09 2015 UTC,"I was thinking a powerful tethered magnet that shoots out. Needs the ""come over here!"" audio though for full effect."
battlebots,3dwet5,SoCo_cpp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:19:47 2015 UTC,"actually, that's a pretty good idea... why not hook up a battery to the outside of the bot and electro-magnetize the whole thing...(unless you know, it messes with the RF lol)?"
battlebots,3dwet5,CamGoldenGun,2,Mon Jul 20 21:02:48 2015 UTC,"They showed that one bot had magnetized tracks, suggesting a ferrous metal floor of the arena. One magnet to the opponent and one to the floor tethered together would make for nasty trap. Don't know how that'd fly with the rules though."
battlebots,3dwet5,SoCo_cpp,2,Mon Jul 20 21:16:08 2015 UTC,"There was something in the rules about EM fields I think... and an electro-magnet would probably qualify. I think it would be pretty cool to polarize the bot and be able to push your opponent around without even touching it, or the reverse: pull it, drag it where you want and let the hammer slam into it."

battlebots,3dwet5,RA2lover,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:05:12 2015 UTC,A bullet could definitely damage the arena.
battlebots,3dwet5,fb39ca4,2,Mon Jul 20 21:02:56 2015 UTC,the bot's weapon mounting would destruct itself on the first shot though. no way a single pass of duct tape can hold a .45 pistol firing.

battlebots,3dw4yv,RandyJackson,15,Mon Jul 20 01:57:49 2015 UTC,The announcer wants them to lose so badly after that... Whatever that was.
battlebots,3dw4yv,IamMNightShyamalan,73,Mon Jul 20 01:34:13 2015 UTC,Ghost Raptor this tournament
battlebots,3dw4yv,VinceOnAPlane,11,Mon Jul 20 02:00:21 2015 UTC,It could very well defeat Bite Force too.
battlebots,3dw4yv,CaptNemo131,15,Mon Jul 20 02:02:07 2015 UTC,HOLY FUCK
battlebots,3dw4yv,Hiicantpk,16,Mon Jul 20 01:09:57 2015 UTC,Think is is gonna be a close judge decision. I'd say split to Bite Force
battlebots,3dw4yv,chaosfire235,14,Mon Jul 20 01:38:43 2015 UTC,"On this episode of Battlebots, the Spinners are taken down a notch!"
battlebots,3dw4yv,danakinskyrocker,28,Mon Jul 20 02:06:09 2015 UTC,I do love that each round the builders have a chance to modify their bots to counter their opponent. Cool to see the variations
battlebots,3dw4yv,G_I_Joe_Mansueto,14,Mon Jul 20 01:19:24 2015 UTC,Absolutely! The fact that Tombstone has different size blades is really cool. I would have loved to see a size or usage comparison.
battlebots,3dw4yv,danman_d,47,Mon Jul 20 01:21:00 2015 UTC,"Lucky win by Tombstone. This should make it clear that it's not nearly as invincible as its fans believe. Tombstone's biggest weakness is its own kinetic energy flipping it around the arena. edit: especially against wedges - the blade will nearly always contact wedges on the bottom of the blade and not the top, flipping it upwards."
battlebots,3dw4yv,Xciv,8,Mon Jul 20 01:23:43 2015 UTC,"I think that fake stat they gave Tombstone (Defense in the 30s) is justified. The wheels are extremely vulnerable, and there's only two of them. Take out one and Tombstone is basically dead in the water.  Also, if it gets launched by a flipper, another KE bot, or a solid wedge, Tombstone has about a 15% chance of landing on its blade, which can snap it right in half."
battlebots,3dw4yv,Alborak,9,Mon Jul 20 01:28:26 2015 UTC,I think all the times i've seen the blade break on this type of robot it's from a drum spinner. They break from the upward force on the thinner plane of the blade.
battlebots,3dw4yv,womd0704,15,Mon Jul 20 02:07:45 2015 UTC,impressed witch doctor took a beating like that  until now tombstone had chewed through everything it touches
battlebots,3dw4yv,A_Windrammer,19,Mon Jul 20 01:26:19 2015 UTC,"First bot they faced with solid defense. Counter Revolution spent all the weight on two huge blades, and Radioactive spent all the weight on... something."
battlebots,3dw4yv,SutterCane,10,Mon Jul 20 01:27:36 2015 UTC,Useless plastic boxes and a broken weird driving system.
battlebots,3dw4yv,iiPixel,14,Mon Jul 20 01:28:58 2015 UTC,Bronco vs Tombstone is going to come down to driving.  Tombstone wins if he can slice into Bronco.  Bronco wins if he can avoid the blade and flip tombstone and make him destroy himself.
battlebots,3dw4yv,The_Zone5,14,Mon Jul 20 01:32:15 2015 UTC,A Present from Ghost Raptor? oh the irony.
battlebots,3dw4yv,Ravage123,25,Mon Jul 20 01:48:26 2015 UTC,YEAH I DON'T HAVE TO EAT A PHOTO OF OVERHAUL
battlebots,3dw4yv,Faceh,35,Mon Jul 20 01:47:04 2015 UTC,"I'm torn. These ring-outs make for really boring endings, but without them then flipper-bots are at a big disadvantage."
battlebots,3dw4yv,woohooreddit,25,Mon Jul 20 01:11:50 2015 UTC,getting stuck on top of the wall seems to be good enough for a flipper advantage. No need for 4' of space outside the arena!
battlebots,3dw4yv,PM_ME_UR_BIRD,12,Mon Jul 20 01:13:22 2015 UTC,Loving the sass of announcer man right now.
battlebots,3dw4yv,woohooreddit,14,Mon Jul 20 01:34:25 2015 UTC,Why do all these show promos just seem generic/dumb?
battlebots,3dw4yv,CaptNemo131,19,Mon Jul 20 01:43:59 2015 UTC,"You don't watch a lot of network TV, do you?  It's all this way"
battlebots,3dw4yv,ytmnic,14,Mon Jul 20 01:45:12 2015 UTC,"it's not like Icewave had to drive right into GR's defenses, it could have dodged or maneuvered..."
battlebots,3dw4yv,FaceBagman,24,Mon Jul 20 02:05:12 2015 UTC,"Everyone who talked shit about Witch Doctor better eat hats. Thing held up.  Sad thing is, before the attachment (in the Bronco fight), it seemed to be able to use the disc to move on it's back."
battlebots,3dw4yv,LittleKingsguard,13,Mon Jul 20 01:28:04 2015 UTC,"Funniest thing about the witch doctor loss? I'm pretty sure that without the wedge, they would have had wheels on the ground."
battlebots,3dw4yv,G_I_Joe_Mansueto,12,Mon Jul 20 01:28:56 2015 UTC,"By the same token, without the addition, you wonder if the blade would have been able to get hits on the body."
battlebots,3dw4yv,LefthandedLunatic,12,Mon Jul 20 01:30:59 2015 UTC,wut. Is that a stick to keep ICewave away
battlebots,3dw4yv,iiPixel,22,Mon Jul 20 01:49:19 2015 UTC,Biteforce is the winner for me. 20 seconds doesnt make a difference.
battlebots,3dw4yv,cheeseop,23,Mon Jul 20 01:38:27 2015 UTC,"Y'know, now I'm interested to see if Ghost Raptor can come up with something for Bite Force. Who knows what this piece of crap can do?"
battlebots,3dw4yv,cheeseop,20,Mon Jul 20 01:59:23 2015 UTC,"And give Team Raptor some credit, they've been crazy consistent even with less than stellar bots."
battlebots,3dw4yv,RandyJackson,10,Mon Jul 20 02:00:04 2015 UTC,Finally a fight that's damn entertaining!!
battlebots,3dw4yv,kbarnett514,10,Mon Jul 20 01:10:44 2015 UTC,LOL THE ANNOUNCERS FUCKING FACE
battlebots,3dw4yv,FaceBagman,11,Mon Jul 20 01:34:07 2015 UTC,"Bahahaha, that reaction to team JACD. Highlight of the show."

battlebots,3dw4yv,Glorgu,10,Mon Jul 20 01:51:19 2015 UTC,"Fuck it, I'm digging the ghost raptor team and chuck! Appears they have been rolling with the punches and good driving has kept them in the game and I'm thoroughly impressed that they took out ice wave!"
battlebots,3dw4yv,FaceBagman,30,Mon Jul 20 02:15:16 2015 UTC,Bill Engvall vs. Tombstone final confirmed.
battlebots,3dw4yv,kbarnett514,8,Mon Jul 20 01:01:36 2015 UTC,Good to see the killsaws doing work finally

battlebots,3dw4yv,PM_ME_UR_BIRD,10,Mon Jul 20 01:35:50 2015 UTC,We're going to need an Olympic wrestling judge for this fight.
battlebots,3dw4yv,Infernaltank,45,Mon Jul 20 01:37:12 2015 UTC,The Witch Doctor folks are probably the best dressed in the event.
battlebots,3dw4yv,PM_ME_UR_BIRD,27,Mon Jul 20 01:19:45 2015 UTC,*most dressed

battlebots,3dw4yv,woohooreddit,9,Mon Jul 20 01:49:14 2015 UTC,Short but amazing fight.  Witch Doctor was doing GREAT
battlebots,3dw4yv,Myth3842,8,Mon Jul 20 01:23:21 2015 UTC,Looks like Tombstone lucked out.
battlebots,3dw4yv,KnivesInAToaster,10,Mon Jul 20 01:23:36 2015 UTC,"On one hand, it's a shitty way for WD to lose, but Witch Doctor really should've had a self righting mechanism."
battlebots,3dw4yv,AustinTheGeek,9,Mon Jul 20 01:25:00 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, we get to see Tombstone vs. Bronco next week in semis"
battlebots,3dw4yv,rewards333,9,Mon Jul 20 01:25:19 2015 UTC,Tombstone not as invincible as everyone thinks.
battlebots,3dw4yv,Likes_MMA_Stuff,9,Mon Jul 20 01:25:40 2015 UTC,"Damn man, Witch Doctor put up a hell of a fight, but they're not kidding when they say Tombstone is the Mike Tyson of the tournament. Tombstone vs Bronco will be great."

battlebots,3dw4yv,Infernaltank,9,Mon Jul 20 01:51:51 2015 UTC,Great strategy by Chuck Pitzer! Well done!
battlebots,3dw4yv,hatramroany,9,Mon Jul 20 01:58:26 2015 UTC,Ghost Raptor was testing its luck by ramming Ice Wave when it was incapacitated.
battlebots,3dw4yv,gmc4x4truck,9,Mon Jul 20 01:59:00 2015 UTC,What a surprise win by Ghost Raptor!! I'm really impressed they've made it this far since their primary weapon has been gone for several fights
battlebots,3dw4yv,Reapexx,22,Mon Jul 20 02:00:48 2015 UTC,"Say what you will about Ghost Raptor and its other fights so far, but that ""De-Icer"" was pretty genius."
battlebots,3dw4yv,acealeam,33,Mon Jul 20 02:02:19 2015 UTC,"What the fuck, i didnt know there was an area that is literally inescapable."
battlebots,3dw4yv,SutterCane,16,Mon Jul 20 01:12:03 2015 UTC,Tombstone's been nice?!??!??
battlebots,3dw4yv,A_Windrammer,8,Mon Jul 20 01:17:38 2015 UTC,"I mean, he could have thrown out even more hits? Except that Counter Revolution said go for it."
battlebots,3dw4yv,freedomfightre,9,Mon Jul 20 01:19:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, Ray has been VERY nice. Not obliterating his first two opponents, and asking them if they wanted more (for the spectacle of the match) before going in for additional hits. They both could have been in mulched, but weren't.  Witch Doctor was an actual challenge."
battlebots,3dw4yv,CaptNemo131,6,Mon Jul 20 03:44:38 2015 UTC,"Right?  ""No more Mr. Nice Guy""?  Was he ever here to begin with?"
battlebots,3dw4yv,The_Zone5,16,Mon Jul 20 01:18:12 2015 UTC,Tombstone vs Bronco next weEK LETS GOOOO!   Clamp vs Clamp and then Spinner vs malfunctions.
battlebots,3dw4yv,namenroodle,16,Mon Jul 20 01:27:22 2015 UTC,I hope the members of Overhaul are watching this live reddit.

battlebots,3dw4yv,m1k3yd33t,15,Mon Jul 20 02:22:52 2015 UTC,Ghost Raptor?  I... This doesn't make sense...
battlebots,3dw4yv,TH3_GR3G,22,Mon Jul 20 01:58:35 2015 UTC,"Witch Doctor actually broke Tombstone's blade... That was impressive in itself.  ""Even a god-king can bleed."""

battlebots,3dw4yv,LittleKingsguard,14,Mon Jul 20 01:51:39 2015 UTC,Lost to a de-icer. . .   WHY DOES NOBODY HAVE A SELF RIGHTING MECHANISM?!?!?
battlebots,3dw4yv,LawAndMortar,61,Mon Jul 20 01:59:16 2015 UTC,The Stinger/Bronco fight is proof that Season 2 needs to redesign the cage so you can't throw a bot out of the arena.  A great fight ended too soon because of a design defect.
battlebots,3dw4yv,PM_ME_UR_BIRD,52,Mon Jul 20 01:12:08 2015 UTC,"Maybe just higher walls. I don't mind the mechanic of throwing them out, but it's way too easy."
battlebots,3dw4yv,Verusauxilium,7,Mon Jul 20 01:13:25 2015 UTC,"What if the arena was like an empty pool, so that robots will just slide down the walls instead of getting out of the arena"
battlebots,3dw4yv,PartemConsilio,13,Mon Jul 20 01:18:01 2015 UTC,"I think it's designed that way on purpose. Stinger might've won with some better driving. I mean, they had Bronco on the screws and flipped over."
battlebots,3dw4yv,MNtwinkee,7,Mon Jul 20 01:15:22 2015 UTC,"""Bronco?! Aw, buck."""
battlebots,3dw4yv,STICH666,7,Mon Jul 20 01:05:10 2015 UTC,WOW that was incredible!!!!!!!
battlebots,3dw4yv,The_Zone5,7,Mon Jul 20 01:10:44 2015 UTC,Tombstone is a helicopter!0
battlebots,3dw4yv,MiamiFootball,8,Mon Jul 20 01:22:23 2015 UTC,that was like Mayweather vs Shane Mosley where Mayweather got clocked perhaps the only time in his career.
battlebots,3dw4yv,yaomon17,8,Mon Jul 20 01:24:13 2015 UTC,"Didn't WD's spinning drum/blade break so that was why it couldn't self right? It stopped spinning before the last hit when Ray was egging them to come in since the spinner had stopped. Even if it had landed upright then, it would come to a shoving match."
battlebots,3dw4yv,PureCFR,8,Mon Jul 20 01:28:49 2015 UTC,It's like a mating ritual between....things.
battlebots,3dw4yv,Thats_absrd,8,Mon Jul 20 01:36:10 2015 UTC,Bronco is scary because even in they get stuck on the screws they proved they can get themselves off it.   Bronco boys! Mount up!
battlebots,3dw4yv,STICH666,8,Mon Jul 20 01:37:06 2015 UTC,Biteforce still won on points.
battlebots,3dw4yv,Hiicantpk,7,Mon Jul 20 01:38:26 2015 UTC,He swapped the microphone to the other hand. Gave it away
battlebots,3dw4yv,ewfuentes,7,Mon Jul 20 01:45:44 2015 UTC,A present?  I thought presents weren't allowed?
battlebots,3dw4yv,CaptNemo131,8,Mon Jul 20 01:48:16 2015 UTC,GR is gonna hold IW like you hold a little kid's head when he's swinging punches.
battlebots,3dw4yv,Thats_absrd,9,Mon Jul 20 01:50:49 2015 UTC,I know it's not over but I was pleased with the series overall.   Announcers got better as it went on and the drama felt less soap opera-y and the end.
battlebots,3dw4yv,professorbooty25,7,Mon Jul 20 01:55:39 2015 UTC,The amount of commercials tells me this fight is going to be over with quickly.

battlebots,3dw4yv,biohazard930,14,Mon Jul 20 02:08:20 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty disappointed that bots can be flipped out of the arena. That was a fantastic start to the Bronco vs. Stinger match, and I think the whole 3 minutes would've been unbelievable."
battlebots,3dw4yv,huanthewolfhound,13,Mon Jul 20 01:12:18 2015 UTC,"If nothing else, Witch Doctor drew blood and showed Tombstone isn't invincible."
battlebots,3dw4yv,juel1979,7,Mon Jul 20 01:24:16 2015 UTC,The look on Ray's face when WD didn't just explode was priceless. The adrenaline in his voice in the interview killed me.
battlebots,3dw4yv,WVbrU,13,Mon Jul 20 01:27:36 2015 UTC,"BiteForce had it most of the game, but Overhaul really took over the last minute or so. I say it'll go to Overhaul, but it could be close."
battlebots,3dw4yv,Yoshiman400,18,Mon Jul 20 01:38:32 2015 UTC,YES! Killsaws!  What a crazy fight that was!
battlebots,3dw4yv,G_I_Joe_Mansueto,52,Mon Jul 20 01:10:42 2015 UTC,"Here's an idea guys. Instead of being creepy and shit, how about commending Chobot for being the one to closely inspect the bot.  You fucks."
battlebots,3dw4yv,KingDusty,11,Mon Jul 20 01:45:51 2015 UTC,This is the only comment in this thread I have seen talking about her at all.
battlebots,3dw4yv,danman_d,12,Mon Jul 20 12:47:30 2015 UTC,Bronco and tombstone should have been on separate sides. By far the most interesting and deadly bots
battlebots,3dw4yv,STICH666,12,Mon Jul 20 01:17:24 2015 UTC,"Ha, never seen the judges enter the ring to inspect damage! Very close call."
battlebots,3dw4yv,Hiicantpk,7,Mon Jul 20 01:39:49 2015 UTC,On the old series they would do it off camera.
battlebots,3dw4yv,Ravage123,7,Mon Jul 20 01:42:13 2015 UTC,Ring out - Done. Guess there wasn't much more than the minute shown at comicon.
battlebots,3dw4yv,SutterCane,6,Mon Jul 20 01:11:06 2015 UTC,Jesus.
battlebots,3dw4yv,Faceh,9,Mon Jul 20 01:13:13 2015 UTC,Producers probably shit their pants hard when Stinger turned into a giant fireball flying toward the wall.
battlebots,3dw4yv,werdnanets,6,Mon Jul 20 01:15:19 2015 UTC,"If they'd had the minibot, they might have been able to right themselves.  Of course... they might not have been able to take the hits."
battlebots,3dw4yv,RydeT3HPwny,6,Mon Jul 20 01:24:38 2015 UTC,Damn. They cut away with a storm update
battlebots,3dw4yv,iiPixel,6,Mon Jul 20 01:30:48 2015 UTC,HOLY SHIT THAT REACTION SHOT.
battlebots,3dw4yv,BaronOBeefDerp,6,Mon Jul 20 01:34:12 2015 UTC,Manny vs Mayweather all over again..
battlebots,3dyrku,RA2lover,5,Mon Jul 20 17:02:32 2015 UTC,"Flame or not, Shaman proved to be useful as a floorjack if anything else since Bronco got high-centered on it and had to fire its flipper to get off. Another move such as that could give Witch Doctor the few precious seconds needed to land a solid hit on a stalled out Bronco. Bronco's side armor looks pretty flimsy, so I'd expect it to come apart if hit hard enough.  Tombstone will let us know if that's the case. :P"
battlebots,3dyrku,ZetaGator,8,Mon Jul 20 17:15:52 2015 UTC,"Everyone must think Broncos side armor is made of jello lol. Witch Doctor got a direct hit on it in their first match and it barely dented it. Remember that.  The side armor is titanium and is basically designed to ""look"" flimsy. It acts as shock absorption. Think of car suspension/springs. It bends/compresses so it doesn't break."
battlebots,3dyrku,CantRap,2,Mon Jul 20 18:32:15 2015 UTC,Indeed it is designed to flex.
battlebots,3dwh2h,ElectricNed,11,Mon Jul 20 02:47:05 2015 UTC,Poor Shaman. Though I guess it was spared from tombstone.
battlebots,3dwh2h,stratusgratis,6,Mon Jul 20 02:56:24 2015 UTC,You kidding? Tombstone was spared from Shaman.
battlebots,3dwh2h,HighOverlordXenu,5,Mon Jul 20 12:37:59 2015 UTC,Ray Billings (Tombstone) did mention that he was more fearful of Shaman.
battlebots,3dwh2h,xenonprime,5,Mon Jul 20 15:19:47 2015 UTC,Wow what did Shaman did to get on WD's bad side?
battlebots,3dwh2h,Swade9wade,7,Mon Jul 20 05:21:09 2015 UTC,it broke down and left WD alone to be beaten by tombstone. in WD's 3 mins of need shaman let WD down. and so it got the boot.
battlebots,3dwh2h,Gitguds,2,Mon Jul 20 05:22:34 2015 UTC,Pretty sure if they had shaman instead of the giant metal plate they would've been mauled
battlebots,3dwh2h,cainn88,4,Tue Jul 21 03:52:56 2015 UTC,I like how that bowling ball gets shredded even more brutally than the one in Tombstone's promo video.
battlebots,3dwh2h,blulizard,5,Mon Jul 20 09:18:06 2015 UTC,fucking epic. those are the only words that cover it.
battlebots,3dwh2h,Gitguds,5,Mon Jul 20 05:08:40 2015 UTC,That music was perfect. I almost made Witch Doctor... adorable. Almost.

battlebots,3dwo1j,zobbyblob,3,Mon Jul 20 05:15:50 2015 UTC,"Biteforce is a good machine with a great driver, but it seems people don't like it because they don't understand the basic concept of ""adapt or die"", even after Chuck Pitzer gave us a rundown.  I almost want it to win it all now, just because the salt will be so delicious. Looking forward to this AMA!"
battlebots,3dwo1j,Colonialism,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:22:14 2015 UTC,you'll regret it when all the copycats for glory are boring brick shove bots and people get bored and drop the show. AGAIN.  but carry on sticking it to people who try to follow the rules and want to watch exciting fights.
battlebots,3dwo1j,Gitguds,3,Tue Jul 21 10:42:59 2015 UTC,Sweet. I'm glad so many of the competitors are doing AMAs here.
battlebots,3dwo1j,SparkleSorceress,2,Mon Jul 20 20:14:30 2015 UTC,Someone try and mention /r/Battlebots. It was kind of missing from the last two /r/IAMA.   It is always good to get some fresh-blood from the defaults visiting here.  I have a feeling this AMA might do well given the excitement from the last episode.
battlebots,3dwo1j,500500,3,Mon Jul 20 20:19:21 2015 UTC,"Of course, we'll do our best!"
battlebots,3dwo1j,BiteForce-Travis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:05:58 2015 UTC,Does the AMA require a North Face jacket tied around the waist? I bet you could answer way better that way.
battlebots,3dwo1j,EntropyInTheUK,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:26:07 2015 UTC,"It's summer.  No jackets required.  However, I did wear the jacket around my waist before our first match."

battlebots,3dwo1j,mossdog427,5,Mon Jul 20 17:23:57 2015 UTC,AMA's going to be on r/IAMA at 8pm EST. I'll put up a link to it when the AMA starts.
battlebots,3dw8h5,Nationofnoobs,33,Mon Jul 20 01:29:18 2015 UTC,"That's one weakness everyone ignores. Call tombstone OP all you want, but watch any battle where the opponent slaps a ramp on their bot. He's next to fucking useless. That blade is Hella dangerous until it breaks, and it does that A LOT"
battlebots,3dw8h5,Hello_Dawl,21,Mon Jul 20 01:41:48 2015 UTC,"It's not just the ramp, but a solid ramp that is also wide.  If the wedge is too narrow Tombstone can easily hit the sides, but the way Witchdoctor was shaped coupled with the fast turning speed means it's impossible to get around the front of the doctor.  There's also a lot of flimsy wedges that are basically just skirts. Those get ripped right off."
battlebots,3dw8h5,Xciv,12,Mon Jul 20 02:04:43 2015 UTC,"True, Razorback is an example of a wedge that's useless"
battlebots,3dw8h5,Hello_Dawl,13,Mon Jul 20 02:06:30 2015 UTC,"As they say, wedge > spinner > flipper > wedge."
battlebots,3dw8h5,glorkvorn,5,Mon Jul 20 04:38:24 2015 UTC,we eagerly await hammer
battlebots,3dw8h5,Gitguds,7,Mon Jul 20 05:13:50 2015 UTC,"As cool as beta is, I don't think hammers are ever going to be very good purely because they can't even store a fraction of the energy that a spinner can."
battlebots,3dw8h5,BrainSlurper,5,Mon Jul 20 11:30:07 2015 UTC,"This is a concern that I share. However, I noticed that the dorsal armour on a lot of bots this season was pretty negligible. Hammers are always going to be weaker, but they have a unique angle of attack and often face less in the way of defenses."
battlebots,3dw8h5,ForceAndFury,6,Mon Jul 20 14:43:07 2015 UTC,I always thought the glaring issue is the difficulty of actually landing a hit
battlebots,3dw8h5,DirtyD27,2,Mon Jul 20 19:24:25 2015 UTC,A good hammer with a sharp piercing end might work if it can get to the electronics or other critical parts inside.  Blunt ends won't do enough damage though.
battlebots,3dw8h5,ZMeson,12,Mon Jul 20 21:33:42 2015 UTC,"For definitely. Vertical spinners wreck horizontal spinners though, since they usually beak the horizontal blade.  I think witch doctor was the best chance to beat tombstone. I'm team bronco all the way, but I expect tombstone to beat bronco."
battlebots,3dw8h5,Spartan5382,8,Mon Jul 20 01:44:27 2015 UTC,"I think it would depend on who gets the first hit. If the Broncho is able to flip him, it might end well for the Broncho. But, if tombstone is able to get 1 or 2 good hits on broncho's flipper, then there's definitely an issue"
battlebots,3dw8h5,Hiicantpk,2,Mon Jul 20 01:53:14 2015 UTC,In the preview for the next episode I'm pretty sure there was a clip of Bronco sitting in the corner missing a wheel
battlebots,3dw8h5,mercury_289,9,Mon Jul 20 02:04:51 2015 UTC,"It's worth keeping in mind that Bronco is almost perfectly redundant across its length.  As long as its primary electronics are still intact, an entire half can be removed and the whole robot and its weapon will still function."

battlebots,3dw8h5,gnarkilleptic,8,Mon Jul 20 21:11:56 2015 UTC,I would think that vertical spinners get wrecked by horizontal spinners... except maybe a small vertical spinner like witch doctor.  Tombstone would absolutely trash a large vertical blade like Nightmare
battlebots,3dw8h5,MikeNCR,8,Mon Jul 20 02:12:34 2015 UTC,It's a bit smaller scale (1lb) but here's what can happen with that sort of fight-  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRHgQadKqiA
battlebots,3dw8h5,stratusgratis,5,Mon Jul 20 03:55:52 2015 UTC,"For sure, horizontal spinners are way more stable, but if the vertical  spinner is more solid, then it can break it apart."
battlebots,3dw8h5,sarahbau,3,Mon Jul 20 03:34:24 2015 UTC,Large vertical spinners are almost non-existant any more. Almost all vertical spinners are small heavy discs or drums
battlebots,3dw8h5,CantRap,3,Mon Jul 20 07:18:07 2015 UTC,The proper term would be drum spinners. Drum spinners > horizontal spinners.
battlebots,3dw8h5,HiThisIsAFakeAccount,2,Mon Jul 20 08:20:50 2015 UTC,Exactly.  Drum > Horizontal > Vertical
battlebots,3dw8h5,CantRap,2,Mon Jul 20 12:49:31 2015 UTC,"It makes me wonder what if Bronco changed the flipper so that instead of going upwards, it sent a titanium wedge/plate forwards with the same force. Imagine Bronco driving towards Tombstones blade and actuating the plate. Would Tombstone get sent flying, and would that impact shatter the blade? I'd imagine it'd be like Ray driving Tombstone head on into a wall at like 200+ MPH.  I wonder if that would put this ""active pusher"" bot  in between the drum > horizontal food chain."
battlebots,3dw8h5,fb39ca4,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:54:37 2015 UTC,"Yep. That would be super interesting to see. IDK how easy it would be to reorient that giant pneumatic piston for pushing, however."
battlebots,3dw8h5,Rflkt,17,Mon Jul 20 21:14:39 2015 UTC,Tombstone got so lucky that witch doctor couldn't self-right without their spinner. I remember everyone saying witch doctor was bad/had no chance and didn't deserve to here. I think this match shows otherwise as they would have won if they didn't get stuck.
battlebots,3dw8h5,Kovoo,7,Mon Jul 20 04:33:44 2015 UTC,I completely agree. Witch doctor just ran into an awful pre tournament matchup. What baffles me is that bronco only got the 4 seed after dominating WD  yet the judges gave WD the 9 seed. Bronco should've gotten a better seed.
battlebots,3dw8h5,ChaoticMidget,3,Mon Jul 20 07:12:47 2015 UTC,Over who? I suppose Bite Force but both Ice Wave and Tombstone looked dominant in their matches so far.
battlebots,3dw8h5,DerNubenfrieken,5,Mon Jul 20 10:23:44 2015 UTC,The answer is biteforce. He couldn't KO Warhead in his first round after dominating for 3 minutes. Stinger and Bronco both looked a lot stronger and got the KO against 2 bots that were better built than WH.
battlebots,3dw8h5,pwndnoob,2,Mon Jul 20 16:14:02 2015 UTC,"WH also got a wildcard, so it wasn't considered a slouch."
battlebots,3dw8h5,ForceAndFury,18,Tue Jul 21 05:45:59 2015 UTC,"Ray slipped through by his fingernails in that one. If WD hadn't gotten flipped by that last hit, it would've been a pushing match, and Tombstone probably would've lost.   I'm not sure how much of the prefight stuff was done for the cameras, but one gets the impression that the Hardcore Robotics guys were genuinely taking the fight seriously."
battlebots,3dw8h5,cochon101,8,Mon Jul 20 02:45:26 2015 UTC,"Witch doctors spinner also looked broken towards the end of the match so it would have become a pushing match at that point, and I'd give the advantage to witch doctor since it still had its wedge and mobility intact."
battlebots,3dw8h5,Kovoo,7,Mon Jul 20 04:31:34 2015 UTC,"Plus, if it had become a pushing match , witch doctor had the obvious lead in pretty much every judged category by then."
battlebots,3dw8h5,BrainSlurper,2,Mon Jul 20 07:08:42 2015 UTC,They had a large lead in all completely arbitrary number categories
battlebots,3dw8h5,A_Hint_of_Lemon,6,Mon Jul 20 11:31:54 2015 UTC,"I'm a fan of WD now. I mean, I liked how it matched up against Overdrive, and I liked what I saw from the Bronco fight. Hopefully they decide to go with a srimec as opposed to a mini-bot next season!"
battlebots,3dw8h5,Cha0sFerret,9,Mon Jul 20 04:42:12 2015 UTC,I think I can safely say that I've never been so disappointed by such an awesome hit.  I really wanted to see Witch Doctor dish out one more solid whack to seal the match.
battlebots,3dw8h5,mangodroplet,9,Mon Jul 20 02:16:47 2015 UTC,Witch doctor was so close to winning. She was AMAZING.
battlebots,3dw8h5,MyifanW,3,Mon Jul 20 04:09:44 2015 UTC,"I was really shocked at how well Witchdoctor did.  If they drove slightly better, they would had it, hands down. There was a part where they charged Tombstone from the side but only hit the blade instead of the Wheel.  If only they could self right, too- but maybe that's just asking too much."
battlebots,3dw8h5,paulHarkonen,7,Mon Jul 20 05:23:51 2015 UTC,The spinner was disabled and the spinner is their self-righting method.  You could see WD was resting on the chin of the skull.  If it was moving WD would be upright quickly.
battlebots,3dw8h5,MyifanW,3,Mon Jul 20 13:50:54 2015 UTC,"Ah, that makes a lot of sense. Guess it was actually very close, though if WD didn't flip they'd probably win the shoving match."
battlebots,3dw8h5,MeetUrDo0m,5,Mon Jul 20 13:57:25 2015 UTC,"tombstone can only beat robots that have weak armor   like literally   if you can tank hits you win, that's why I think bronco will win. if you get him to hit your front it's going to basically ricochet off the front of bronco (like it did with wd) and he will use the flipper at the same time."
battlebots,3dw8h5,sarahbau,4,Mon Jul 20 04:24:25 2015 UTC,Bronco's front is probably the weakest spot. He also can't use the flipper as he's getting hit unless he wants the arm to get bent/broken off.
battlebots,3dw8h5,CantRap,5,Mon Jul 20 07:21:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think Broncos front is the weakest spot. After all, this is Inertia Labs we're talking about, they've been at it for a while. I think they understand that the front of their bot is the most likely to get hit. Especially since thats the end they plan on using to run into opponents."

battlebots,3dwpi5,internetlad,22,Tue Jul 21 05:46:35 2015 UTC,Judge decisions need to be made more transparent. At least give clear reasons as to why a certain team won. Sometimes it's quite obvious; in really close situations (obv. Biteforce v. Overhaul) I would really like to know the specific reasons behind the decision.
battlebots,3dwpi5,GreenPylons,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:58:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah the old show had the announcer give the judges points (e.g. ""The winner by 25-21 decision is""..) in which the judges had to put points into specific categories and then they'd show stats after like how many hits,slams, flips, hazards etc. I wish they would do that instead of just announcing the winner, I like to see how close or dominating performance a bot got from the judges!"

battlebots,3dwpi5,internetlad,4,Mon Jul 20 13:28:59 2015 UTC,"They need to make the show less nerdy, which in this case would actually be accomplished by making it more nerdy.  Right now it just seems like everything is so over the top with little focus on the technical details, making it nerdy because everything is about being over enthusiastic about robots fighting.  Instead they need to make it nerdy based on giving more technical details and a much more grounded enthusiasm.  To that end they should discard the current announcers. I would love to see Jamie and Adam from Mythbusters as announcers, as they have a great combo of technical knowledge combined with fun enthusiasm.  Barring that they need to get announcers who look like they know what they're talking about (and who do know what they're talking about). At least one of the guys should look like he could've just walked out of the shop/pit area.  I'm talking guys in plaid and jeans, etc, that kind of vibe, instead of these faux ESPN/MMA announcers they have right now.  TL:DR; they need to stop trying to make the show into MMA and ESPN and make it more like Mythbusters and This Old House."

battlebots,3dwpi5,RazgrizSeed,17,Mon Jul 20 16:00:35 2015 UTC,"Absolutely no more wildcards. Yeah, yeah, I know, Witch Doctor had a great run and clearly deserved to be in the round of 16. I still don't like the whole mysterious selection process, though.  If the show gets renewed for 13 episodes, I'd like to see a 64-bot single-elimination tournament. That's about five fights per episode, if my math is right. If it's renewed for six episodes, then I'd like to see a 32-bot tournament, which comes out to just over five fights per episode. Fill with rumbles and ""grudge match"" exhibitions, if need be.  An extra fight will fix the show's pacing problem while keeping the network television dramatic storytelling aspect.  I'd also like to see the box hazards either controlled by a ""boxmaster,"" like the old show, or have each hazard activated by motion sensors. The drivers are busy enough driving - they shouldn't have to constantly remind their teammates to hit a button to activate the pulveriser. It should just be automatic. If a bot drives over that 10-inch dot on the floor, the hammer comes down.  Additionally, I'd like to see the removal of the first-minute prohibition on floor hazards. I always considered the killsaws to be an iconic hazard from the old show. I've seen those things pop up ... three times, I think?  They also need to show judge's scorecards on bouts that go to a decision. You can't just say ""Bot X wins!"" like they did tonight, especially when fights are close. The old show did this, and it took no longer than a few seconds. There's no reason that it can't be done on the revival, especially when there's not a lot going on between fights.  But, aside from that, I'm pretty happy with the show. I miss lightweights - I always appreciated the speed of lightweight fights - but I also understand that you want to try to avoid confusion among casual fans, and multiple brackets for multiple weight divisions will probably harm clarity among people who just want to watch robots shred the crap out of each other.  Fingers crossed for a 13-episode run next summer or sooner."
battlebots,3dwpi5,MC151,10,Mon Jul 20 05:58:51 2015 UTC,"The thing that draws in the viewers isn't backstories or filler. It's the fights. The fights are enhanced by sharing the technical details of what's going on behind the scenes (such as Tombstone using a smaller and lighter blade for a match, or why a team is going with heavier armor for another). Knowing some strategy and some of the tech makes the fights more interesting, which adds to the excitement. It's one thing to see a bot get cut open. It's another to know what's getting cut open."

battlebots,3dwpi5,internetlad,2,Mon Jul 20 04:17:16 2015 UTC,1 and 2 were wierd because they were doing a lot of bios on the builders even if they weren't really interesting.  They seem to have abandoned them for 3-5.  2 was especially weird because there were 8 matches and they showed only clips from 4 of them without any discussion between each clip.  IMO the pacing in episodes 3-5 were perfectly fine and even episode 1 was fine if that's the direction the show needed to go to get a season 2.  It'll be interesting to see what they do with episode 6 considering they only have 3 matches instead of 4.

battlebots,3dwpi5,broken42,5,Mon Jul 20 06:22:32 2015 UTC,I was thinking they could have like one or two ring out areas that only open in the last minute of the match. But I agree with better wall hazards. I'd love to see some drums built into the wall to fling robots in the air.
battlebots,3dwpi5,rhadamanthus52,6,Mon Jul 20 12:05:39 2015 UTC,Co2 can freeze in the lines causing a safety hazard. They instead use high pressure air or nitrogen which do not freeze and can be used quicker.

battlebots,3dwpi5,rhadamanthus52,8,Mon Jul 20 14:40:15 2015 UTC,"I think the active weapon rule should be clarified.  The DE-ICER, while cool due to moxie/novelty/on-the-fly engineering was good for TV once, but if it leads to the rise of ""DE-HORIZONTAL-SPINNER"" then it will quickly be a negative for the sport. I think most people want to see robots ripping each other apart, and anything that cheeses against that or disincentives destructive robot designs is counterproductive. If a team like Ghost Raptor and others want to design a specifically tailored DE-OPPONENT weapon for each fight awesome! However I think it's important that they meet some minimum standard so that the new bot design with the new weapon/attachment can legitimately damage or knock out it's opponent on it's own, not make it self-destruct if it's spun up. Other we are going to see the rise of strong drive train bots with custom attachments against all the most interesting weapons, while spinners and potentially even flippers are held at bay by silly looking attachments that lead to less entertaining fights."
battlebots,3dwpi5,snowbirdie,2,Mon Jul 20 14:38:42 2015 UTC,"That said, the De-Icer worked because it was able to press up against Icewave specifically, since Icewave has it's weapon engine on top of the rest of the bot.

I don't have an issue with robots being flipped out of the arena though. If you're good enough to drive someone into a corner and powerful enough to throw them over a wall then you deserve to be winning.   If you remove ringouts then you're just going to end up with spinners. They're fun to watch but it's a bit boring when they're all doing it.

battlebots,3dwzrg,ausda,11,Mon Jul 20 05:57:08 2015 UTC,"I think the arena is just fine. These are 250 lb robots. If you can grab or throw your opponent across the box and over the wall you deserve some sort of award and that award is that sometimes your opponent lands out of bounds.   As for the hazards,  Im fine with them being weak. If two robots are fighting I don't want to see a saw pop up and win the match. One of the bots should win, not a killsaw. I think everyone forgets that back on comedy central the hazards had little to no effect the heavyweights. This isn't a new development.   I think the difference is the ring outs and hammers are more of passive hazards. They only come into effect because one team made a driving mistake or one team manhandles their opponent and puts them in the hazards way.   And about the screws, everyone complained they were too powerful but Bronco showed last night that with some good driving and luck you can get out of them."
battlebots,3dwzrg,QuixoticViking,8,Mon Jul 20 14:39:01 2015 UTC,"Rings outs have been a thing for a long time in the sport. The problem is, how do you reduce ring outs? You can make the walls higher, but that only means that robots with lifters like Stinger can't get them out, while launchers like Bronco still can... You can remove the gap entirely, but that reduces the value of lifters, flippers, and clampers over other weapons. Especially clampers. Now that the arena hazards are automated and random, they can't just hold the other bot over the kill saws, they don't have the speed and traction to slam them into the wall, can't use the pulverizers... The only real choice is the screws or the outside of the arena.  I think it could also be important to note that having a higher knock out percentage isn't necessarily bad... When you have a huge field of robots to get through and more fights per episode. But for a small tournament format that has a really high knock out percentage, we are actually losing significant amounts of fight time.  I think maybe the gap between the wall and the arena barrier should be decreased to give robots a better chance of escaping. Stinger got put in a place where it had no chance.   Or you could decrease the height from the bottom of the pit to the top of the arena barricade, so bots have a better chance of bouncing out.  Or perhaps it should be less of a pit and more of an area that is difficult to get out of, like an uneven floor or stepped tiers to get stuck on, like how so many robots got their corners up on the spike strip of the old box.   Or a one unstick rule."
battlebots,3dwzrg,lXlxlXlxlXl,3,Mon Jul 20 06:30:42 2015 UTC,They just need better hazards. So far they've been ineffective or not even used at all.
battlebots,3dwzrg,ZetaGator,2,Mon Jul 20 13:33:16 2015 UTC,"Came here to say this. I remember the arena hazards fondly from previous seasons, which is why I made that ""Season Six by the Numbers"" thing on my website's homepage to count up all the hazard damages. Thus far, after five episodes there's been only three hits from the Killsaws. That sucks. :(  The Pulverizers also seem a bit suspect as well. When Bite Force took that shot right on the chain and sprocket for its lifter I was expecting it to have broken or warped. I don't think the Pulverizer has caused any significant damage to any robot, despite there being a few dozen blows dealt thus far."

But the amount of robots that have been pushed on top of the screws has been incredibly lame.

battlebots,3dwue6,HardAsBalls,21,Mon Jul 20 04:55:56 2015 UTC,"My guess at why Matt went with the module he did is twofold: the forks were longer than the wedge, giving him extra room between his bot and Bronco's flipping arm, and the forked design meant Bronco's spatula could easily miss its target by popping between the prongs of the fork."
battlebots,3dwue6,maverick_ninefingers,9,Mon Jul 20 05:48:18 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't really see much use for flamethrowers, either. It doesn't look like it does a lot."
battlebots,3dwue6,SpyroFan-17,10,Mon Jul 20 05:00:25 2015 UTC,"It might not do a lot, but it certainly looks cool. If stinger hadn't been flipped out of the ring, it probably would've come down to a judges decision, and those flames very well may have helped him gain an edge in the judge's opinion."
battlebots,3dwue6,TheGuyWithFace,6,Mon Jul 20 05:29:05 2015 UTC,"Well, darn. I know they're judged in four categories, but I can't remember which ones the flamethrower would effect. All I remember are aggression and strategy."
battlebots,3dwue6,SpyroFan-17,3,Mon Jul 20 05:31:17 2015 UTC,"I think one was control, maybe the last one was damage? All I can remember was that this past week a lot of people said that if it came to a judges decision, Bronco would probably win just because him flipping bots that high is so darned impressive. Stinger pushing bronco in a corner and engulfing him in flames could have been equally impressive, and was probably what Max was aiming for."

battlebots,3dwue6,ZetaGator,5,Mon Jul 20 18:43:11 2015 UTC,"I agree. I don't know the exact dimensions of the battle box ring, but I get the feeling that he may have been able to flip himself back over and into the fight if he had his original flippy wedge thing (yes, that is a technical term). I also noticed that the new fork got caught on the floor a lot. I remember a video in which max did a breakdown of Sewer Snake, in which he mentioned that he doesn't have any fancy mechanism for the wedge to ""know"" where it's neutral position, that it just rests on the floor. Clearly that worked far better for that wedge which rests on the floor than for the fork shape which appeared to dig into the floor a bit."

battlebots,3dwue6,wzcx,3,Mon Jul 20 14:22:13 2015 UTC,"Ah. That makes a lot more sense. I'm wondering though-  It didn't make any sense that Matt would have immediately been acting dejected after being thrown out of the ring, since if there's any robot that had the potential to climb back into it- it's Stinger with its 6-wheel-drive ""breakdance"" maneuver. Did the judges immediately call the fight when Matt was thrown out or did they give him a chance to try to get back in, he failed due to the broken gear, and THEN he got counted out?"
battlebots,3dwue6,Astonishmunt,4,Mon Jul 20 21:44:37 2015 UTC,"But perhaps that could be why he chose the forks. The forks DID get underneath Bronco's flipper at least once. As it turns out, being low enough to get under Bronco's flipper also means being low enough to catch the floor seams..."
battlebots,3dwue6,lXlxlXlxlXl,3,Mon Jul 20 06:12:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah. It's one of my favorite designs ever for a bot. Stinger/Sewer Snake's design is so versatile and simple, it's down-right beautiful to watch."
battlebots,3dwue6,Rackintosh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:11:16 2015 UTC,"It looked like the forks caught the floor a few times in the fight, like Complete Control. That probably killed momentum and forced a different driving style, leading to the eventual pin and flip"
battlebots,3dwue6,A_Windrammer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:36:39 2015 UTC,I disagree.  The forks actually kept bronco further out then the wedge would have.  Either way it would have been about whether or not he could stay in the arena.

For the original Comedy Central seasons there was no ""out"" of the arena, the spike strip was attached directly to the walls and above it was just a few inches of the beam the spikes were mounted to.  Technically you could consider Suicidal Tendencies' knockout an ""out of the arena"" since it got stuck up behind the Pulverizer and couldn't get down from there.

Expect a De-Tomber that just holds Tombstone at bay and pushes it into the wall so it will self-destruct. 60-40 GR."

battlebots,3dwbsn,majinspy,3,Mon Jul 20 13:43:45 2015 UTC,"You're right, as opposed to active weapons with a limited distance, I'd much rather watch a tournament with a bunch of wedge and push bots. Oh, wait, that's why the show went off the air in the first place."
battlebots,3dwbsn,internetlad,5,Mon Jul 20 13:56:05 2015 UTC,"I know, but what to do? Hell, it's clear that flame throwers were the cheap easy way around that rule.  Maybe give wedges a weight penalty? Big weapon are heavy and fragile, maybe give weapons bots more weight?   That or loosen up projectile rules."
battlebots,3dwbsn,majinspy,9,Mon Jul 20 14:05:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, more or less. But it was the right stick at the right time.  The other thing is that after they lost their original weapon they just went ahead and rolled with their awkward lever setup against Warrior Clan, and it could've gone badly for them. Refitting their bot specifically to be successful against Icewave in their next fight was a much better decision."
battlebots,3dwbsn,Xarrin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:21:42 2015 UTC,"I applaud the ingenuity but its just such an ass pull. Doesn't reward planning and engineering prowess.

battlebots,3dwbsn,internetlad,6,Mon Jul 20 06:30:23 2015 UTC,People have been having that argument for years. Ever since Tornado vs Razer.

battlebots,3dwbsn,internetlad,11,Mon Jul 20 13:30:23 2015 UTC,"And it worked, bitch all you like, but you can't argue with a good idea."
battlebots,3dwbsn,Remigus,3,Mon Jul 20 13:58:30 2015 UTC,"I can argue my case against the rule book that lets it happen. I just feel as though it was an abuse of the modular weapons rule. Yes I think thinking on your feet is important but I feel there needs to be a clear idea of your bot and what it does before you go into the tournament. This was clearly an ass pull that came from outside that mindset, and can see it being abused heavily in the future with every bot rigged up with kitchy, gimmicky contraptions every fight in a vain effort to hard counter the opponent's bot. (""Oh, we know Bronco is a powerful flipper, so we welded this parachute to our bot."" Stupid example but you see what I'm saying)  I just feel that this rule, if taken advantage of, would dilute the sport and turn it into some cat and mouse game of unrecognizable modular bots, which isn't the game I remember from the original series, I rarely remember, if ever, the bots changing weapons or attachments, then again I probably didn't care when I was younger.  I dunno, whatever. TL:DR; I don't actually care that Chris welded a stick to his busted robot and won, I just think it was cheap and could see issues if everybody follows suit next year."
battlebots,3dwbsn,internetlad,3,Mon Jul 20 14:04:21 2015 UTC,"Provide a not stupid example then to make your case.   Anyway, the simple fact is Icewave still could have out driven them, gotten behind them an torn them a new one, but it didn't. I don't see the stick as particularly cheap, no more so than bots that roll with heavy wedge armor on all side. Hell they probably still could have won with just the angled wedges. But they adapted in anticipation for their opponent, and the opponent didn't adapt by put driving them."
battlebots,3dwbsn,Remigus,0,Mon Jul 20 14:11:34 2015 UTC,"spinners are never the most maneurverable bots, and really all Chuck has to do is keep the stick facing Ice Wave.  Okay so imagine this then, a not stupid example for the Bronco matchup. I enter with some random robot, does whatever. Oh no, I'm facing bronco? Okay here's what I do, weld a bronco - sized half cage (Think I cut a box in half and weld the full-sized bottom portion) to the front of my bot. Now I can drive up there, catch Bronco in it, and he can't use his flipper because his face is stuck in the cage, his wheels hit the bottom and flipper hits the top. I drive him over to the saws or pulverizer or just slam him into the wall. Sure it might not work every time but if every competitor did it, then what's the point of designing a good bot to enter the tournament with if somebody's just gonna try to hard counter with some weird ass pull. I just feel like the tournament should be about designing on paper the most perfect bot you can and using it to ride through the tournament, not changing it to suit every fight, then you're eventually just using different bots.  I have no issue with, for example, what Tombstone does switching blades, or even what Stinger does changing from a flipper to a lifter because it's pre-though-out and holds the same concept, but Ghost Raptor ass pulled from a spinner to a lifter to a like. . . tazbot thing, all in five fights? Just concerns me that if everyone started doing it, it would ruin the sport."
battlebots,3dwbsn,internetlad,36,Mon Jul 20 14:19:00 2015 UTC,Saved?  Tonight they showed ingenuity in the face of adversity and won some cred from me. Was it a gamble?  Absolutely. Did it pay off?  Absolutely.
battlebots,3dwbsn,ragbagger,20,Mon Jul 20 02:15:05 2015 UTC,I think its the first time they won not because of luck.
battlebots,3dwbsn,check_my_mids,6,Mon Jul 20 02:30:55 2015 UTC,"define how the ""arm"" was apart of his plan to flip icewave?  Don't get me wrong his deigns was good, but his win was not designed, his win was luck that it flipped ice wave."
battlebots,3dwbsn,KCIV,7,Mon Jul 20 04:30:52 2015 UTC,"not necessarily a plan to flip, jsut to control, if he can keep icewave at a range where he can't get hit, he has an upper hand."
battlebots,3dwbsn,check_my_mids,5,Mon Jul 20 04:36:41 2015 UTC,"That was not why he won though, you are proving the point that it was luck. His plan was to control ice wave and keep him at range as you say,  that is NOT what he was able to do, ice wave got in close and that is why ice wave flipped.... so again, not Rapters design but rather ""luck/chaos/Third Law"".  Correlation/Causation."
battlebots,3dwbsn,KCIV,6,Mon Jul 20 04:39:52 2015 UTC,"But it was ghost raptor's design that beat Icewave. Angled steel armor is the best offense against horizontal spinners. It lifts their blades and sends them flying. That's why most spinners now are offset like Tombstone, so they can be invertible."
battlebots,3dwbsn,sarahbau,4,Mon Jul 20 07:33:57 2015 UTC,"Exactly.   People here cheers for Witch Doctor for bouncing Tombstone with a steep armor ramp, but hey, let's circlejerk about how Ghost Raptor only won because of luck when they did the same exact thing."
battlebots,3dwbsn,stagfury,-1,Mon Jul 20 12:06:10 2015 UTC,"That design was not ""added"". That design was in his bot from day one..... I thought of all reddits Battle bots would at least be filled with people who can think critically."
battlebots,3dwbsn,KCIV,2,Mon Jul 20 15:04:03 2015 UTC,What? Who said he added that later? Certainly not me.
battlebots,3dwbsn,sarahbau,0,Mon Jul 20 16:45:58 2015 UTC,"Icewave didn't get close, though. Its blade only  hit the wedge on Ghost Raptor -- the wedge specifically designed to take hits from spinners."

battlebots,3dwbsn,Infernaltank,14,Mon Jul 20 02:18:38 2015 UTC,"I thought icewave was actually really weak when it started fighting, but it grew on me as time went on. I mean, it proved to not be very strong at the end of it all, but it was much more capable than I expected."
battlebots,3dwbsn,PM_ME_UR_BIRD,18,Mon Jul 20 03:00:05 2015 UTC,I think people mostly wanted to see Icewave and Tombstone fight each other and cause a reality-breaking black hole when their blades impacted.
battlebots,3dwbsn,Faceh,8,Mon Jul 20 06:23:13 2015 UTC,"I think Tombstone has a longer reach, heavier blade, and a more powerful motor. I don't think there would have been much contest. Plus, Tombstone is invertible."
battlebots,3dwbsn,sarahbau,7,Mon Jul 20 07:32:08 2015 UTC,"Even if we ignore the longer reach and stronger blade part, I feel like Icewave would be far more likely to self destruct. Sure, Tombstone broke it's own blade, but I'm sure Icewave would have blew itself up far earlier if it was out through the same bouncing around that Tombstone did."
battlebots,3dwbsn,stagfury,6,Mon Jul 20 12:10:28 2015 UTC,"Pretty much, including me. But seriously, at this point if you can't operate inverted you deserve to lose."
battlebots,3dwbsn,Spida-Mernkey,13,Mon Jul 20 03:13:59 2015 UTC,"They just made a great modification.  It wasn't something that you can't get around, like Tornado and that giant cage it used to beat Razer on Robot Wars.  Just get around that little barrier and you can hit Ghost Raptor. Icewave couldn't do that."
battlebots,3dwbsn,joecb91,11,Mon Jul 20 04:06:52 2015 UTC,Fuck tornado and fuck that cheap ass cage. Razer had his ass in the pit and he won fair and square.  Damn it now I'm all salty.
battlebots,3dwbsn,internetlad,6,Mon Jul 20 05:48:18 2015 UTC,They had him above the pit only after it was impossible for him to be immobilized due to time. Razer got dominated in that fight.
battlebots,3dwbsn,BrainSlurper,3,Mon Jul 20 06:01:51 2015 UTC,Because of the cage. They would have got munched like everyone else if they fought without it.
battlebots,3dwbsn,internetlad,7,Mon Jul 20 06:04:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, which is why they put the cage on."
battlebots,3dwbsn,BrainSlurper,2,Mon Jul 20 06:06:36 2015 UTC,Why not just put a frickin cage on everything then. Robot combat is now a reverse cage match with two sumo bots bumping into each other! Praise the cage! All hail the cage!
battlebots,3dwbsn,internetlad,3,Mon Jul 20 06:20:07 2015 UTC,"While I don't object to hailing the cage, the cage would not have been effective against anyone else. Which is why they did not use it on anyone else. Tornado had 3 or 4 different weapons it used depending on who it fought."
battlebots,3dwbsn,BrainSlurper,3,Mon Jul 20 09:11:22 2015 UTC,"It just took the term ""pushbot"" to the maximum extreme. Tornado's plan wasn't to beat Razer, it was to make it impossible for any meaningful fighting to occur. And in that type of match, a tank will win a pushing contest."
battlebots,3dwbsn,ChaoticMidget,3,Mon Jul 20 10:28:53 2015 UTC,"No, tornado's plan was to beat razer. Do you think they went out there to lose? They completely dominated the fight."

battlebots,3dwbsn,BrainSlurper,0,Wed Jul 22 04:28:53 2015 UTC,everyone loves the instant KO match spoiling pit and that cage completely screwed it and pissed all the fans off. why have a pit if you allow bots that can't fit in it? it was in the robotwars rules that the bot must adher to strict dimensions exactly for this.  so why it happen? like biteforce and it's inactive weapon wedge botting the organisers completely missed the cheat and screwed up.
battlebots,3dwbsn,Gitguds,5,Mon Jul 20 10:59:12 2015 UTC,"Except that it wasn't in the rules, otherwise they would have been disqualified. It is pointless to make the robot that big because the armor is weaker as a result- it is only useful against a bot like razer. If it weren't for bots like biteforce and stinger, this would be a beyblade tournament."
battlebots,3dwbsn,BrainSlurper,15,Mon Jul 20 11:18:27 2015 UTC,I actually really like ghost raptor. After their weapon broke they adapted quickly and developed good strategies to succeed. All in a very short time span (The whole event was like 2 days at most).

battlebots,3dwbsn,freedomfightre,6,Mon Jul 20 03:12:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, they were lucky that Icewave was flipped by its own blade hitting the arena floor but Ghost Raptor still might have won if Icewave didn't flip right then and there. You could argue that the ""defroster"" violates the spirit of the competition. I imagine that slapping on a giant wedge would have been just as effective. It's team Icewave's fault for designing a spinner robot with a giant thing on top and can't self-right."
battlebots,3dwbsn,m0rningb0ner,2,Mon Jul 20 05:32:22 2015 UTC,I actually thought it could self right.
battlebots,3dwbsn,internetlad,4,Mon Jul 20 05:49:43 2015 UTC,Looks like they use the bar contacting the floor to get themselves spinning and that lifts them upright. Like a penny.  You see them start to do that for a second before the motor cut out.  Like this
battlebots,3dwbsn,Savvaloy,5,Mon Jul 20 06:04:50 2015 UTC,"That was pretty clearly their plan, but it looks like the ICE didn't handle being inverted (a lot of engines don't invert well).  From my angle on the couch it looked like they couldn't get the blade spinning as the engine couldn't output enough power before cutting out."

I was sure Ghost Raptor would be done tonight but I figured something was up when they used the Bronco/Stinger matchup for the first fight. I figured it would have been the best and thus last. What a great episode.   Yeah, I think I agree with you. Winner of the Ghost Raptor/Biteforce matchup will have an uphill climb."
battlebots,3dwcpq,ragbagger,7,Mon Jul 20 02:13:02 2015 UTC,"Well here's my one thought:  If the GR team watched the WD v. TS fight, they'll know that its possible to break that thing if you can tank its blows and keep yourself right-side up and keep moving. They may have an adaptation they can make with that in mind."
battlebots,3dwcpq,Faceh,3,Mon Jul 20 02:43:32 2015 UTC,"If Bronco makes it to the finals I think they're doomed though. Biteforce can absorb a ton of damage, but that doesn't matter if it gets flung out of the arena.  Honestly I think it would have less of a chance at winning against Bronco than Ghost Raptor, just because Ghost Raptor will probably come up with some silly new attachment to counter the flipper."
battlebots,3dwcpq,ShazbotSimulator2012,5,Mon Jul 20 04:01:44 2015 UTC,just because Ghost Raptor will probably come up with some silly new attachment to counter the flipper.   I imagine them attaching a propeller so they can fly around and avoid the flipper entirely.

battlebots,3dwcpq,Colonialism,-3,Mon Jul 20 03:43:44 2015 UTC,"driving has nothing to do with it, it's inactive wedge defeats all spinners and it's lifting arms will easly topple GR.  only bronco stands a chance of beating it just like it beat stinger so if tombstone wins then biteforce wins the season... with the only inactive weapon in the tournament."
battlebots,3dwcpq,Gitguds,2,Mon Jul 20 05:26:50 2015 UTC,"Biteforce has a weapon, you saw it use it this episode. They just got really unlucky and were given matchup after matchup where using their weapon how they designed it would be suicide.

battlebots,3dwcpq,Gitguds,3,Mon Jul 20 09:47:38 2015 UTC,"You saw Biteforce's weapon in today's episode. Pretty good clamper, with no plow in sight. However, it has fought spinner after spinner- only GR and Overhaul have anything other than a spinner. Using a clamp against that type of weapon is idiotic, and Biteforce's only choice in that matchup is to use a plow. It wasn't an excuse to enter a wedge, they'd love to use their actual weapon, it was something forced upon them by the circumstances.  Also, there is no rule that states you have to have your wedge on the active weapon. None, you can set your weaponry however you like. All the robots you name were designed to have wedges as part of their normal armament- Biteforce was not. They have to stick the plow wherever they can, and that just so happens to be the back.  Biteforce was not intended to be a wedge. However, it had to become one due to it's opponents, many of whom normally completely counter it's weapon. Otherwise, it would have been destroyed in the first round. Adapt or die."
battlebots,3dwcpq,Colonialism,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:21:15 2015 UTC,"They'd ""love to use their actual weapon""? If you can't 'use' your weapon against the majority of your opponents because it makes you worse is it really much of a weapon at all?"
battlebots,3dwcpq,King-Vitaman,2,Mon Jul 20 16:39:16 2015 UTC,"The actual weapon works perfectly well, and is great against any robot that is not a spinner. However, almost every robot they have fought is a spinner, therefore they have not been able to use the weapon much. They have the wedge for spinners, the clamp for everything else. It is simply a case of supreme bad luck that the organizers keep pitting Biteforce against robots that would destroy it with it's normal armament."
battlebots,3dwcpq,Colonialism,-3,Mon Jul 20 18:24:35 2015 UTC,"it had to disobey the active weapon rule to win, so not intended. the organisers made everyone else take the risk of building their wedges on active weaponry where as biteforce got away with it. thanks for confirming that.    only GR and Overhaul have anything other than a spinner.   lol radioactive, bronco, stinger, complete control, chomp, mohawk, lockjaw, overdrive and beta (if they didn't lose their parts) are all spinnerless bots. you could argue chomp and mohawk are wedge bots but like icewave the wedge leads to the active weaponry. did biteforce's wedge push bot into it's lifting forks? no, it's clearly a wedgebot with lifting prong afterthoughts just to get by the judges just like SOW shuffle drive got by the walker rules.  bitefore is another son of whyachi style rule exploiter, a dull push bot the organisers said they wanted gone. they obviously did't try hard enough and boring matches ensued."
battlebots,3dwcpq,Gitguds,3,Mon Jul 20 07:01:12 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying the same thing over and over and you continue to not understand. I'll put it simply, I'm tired of typing the same thing.  Biteforce is not a wedge. It is a clamper. It has been forced to use a wedge in many of it's fights because it keeps getting put against spinners, which would normally destroy it. Against any non-spinner it would use it's clamp, not it's wedge, as it did against Overhaul and will against Ghost Raptor. Biteforce has broken no rules and by continuing to claim that you are only showing your lack of familiarity with the actual rules.   lol radioactive, bronco, stinger, complete control, chomp, mohawk, lockjaw, overdrive and beta (if they didn't lose their parts) are all spinnerless bots   We were talking about the robots Biteforce fought, not all robots in the competition.  Here is a nice fight in which Biteforce uses it's actual weapon. Maybe you haven't seen it."
battlebots,3dwcpq,Colonialism,-3,Mon Jul 20 07:19:32 2015 UTC,"Biteforce is not a wedge. It is a clamper.   1 fight of many hardly supports the claim.  if that's the best deffence you can do, you're looking at somone giving up on battlebots. back to robogames.  rules, nets, entaglement, active weapons, what are all these things? clearly not organised is what they are, they screwed up with their rules and this whole tournament is a mess."
battlebots,3dwcpq,Gitguds,4,Mon Jul 20 07:42:45 2015 UTC,"So you spend the past few comments complaining about wedgebots... and then say you're going back to Robogames? Yeah, whatever you say man.   I'm not ""deffending"" anything, I'm explaining a basic set of circumstances. What is a ""mess"" is that you've made up your own rules and are getting angry at Battlebots for not correlating to your imaginary ruleset. This is going nowhere and I'm clearly wasting my time talking to somebody who cannot understand what I'm saying."
battlebots,3dwcpq,Colonialism,2,Mon Jul 20 07:48:18 2015 UTC,"You're wrong about this. Clearly the bot wins by moving the other bots into walls with superior traction. That doesn't qualify as an active weapon. His ""arm"" moves slow as dirt and can't crush anything, it's basicall just an appendage that moves in an arc.   You can be in denial but it's just shitty to be required to have an active weapon and play it off like that 'arm' is the best you could come up with.   The bot is boring at best and at worst knowingly loopholed the game.  Where the fuck is the creativity?"
battlebots,3dwcpq,King-Vitaman,-4,Mon Jul 20 16:52:01 2015 UTC,"So you spend the past few comments complaining about wedgebots... and then say you're going back to Robogames? Yeah, whatever you say man.    at least they know how to set the rules up and let bots fight. yeah not a fan of original sin and such but they say they allow wedge bots.   Battlebots on the other hand say big ban hammer to the wedgebot and what does Biteforce do? it's hypocritical to say the least."
battlebots,3dwcpq,Gitguds,5,Mon Jul 20 08:03:24 2015 UTC,"I will say that only one spoilery shot from the promos has been a red herring so far, so I'll be interested to see if they spoil the semis as well. I hope not, because I can excuse showing some of these scenes in promos for a first season when there's no other footage to use. But showing an ""after"" image where both finalists are in view seems like a really stupid editing decision. I hope that was from an exhibition, but I'm doubtful."

I know Tombstone isn't without a weapon for the next fight, it's the fact that it broke halfway through a fight that's an issue."

Biteforce has way more traction than GR, should dominate the pushing fight. I think Bronco would be a tough match-up for Biteforce, but I'd give it the edge over Tombstone.

Just heavy enough that the construction techniques begin to resemble the big boys, and the sight of seeing a robot flying through the air makes you go ""holy crap, those things are powerful!""

It'd still do ok, but it'd have a really rough time in an arena without large flip-out areas as that's its primary method of winning. Along the same lines, the low walls and pit are much more dangerous to spinning weapon based bots as their weapons tend to result in them flying off in a semi-random direction on a solid hit. Sometimes that direction's out of the arena."

battlebots,3dvyj9,stratusgratis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:12:20 2015 UTC,It's got an awesome lineup.  I can't wait either! :D
battlebots,3dv1z1,m1k3yd33t,22,Sun Jul 19 19:23:02 2015 UTC,If Beta fought in this series (eg didn't have the airline lose half it's vital parts) we may well have seen a very effective hammer bot.
battlebots,3dv1z1,Craaig4,14,Sun Jul 19 21:38:17 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Beta would have been immense.  Here is its predecessor, Terrorhurtz fighting in the UK Robot Wars 13 years ago - it does incredible damage against Panic Attack which was a well built robot (see how ineffective the House Robot's axe was against it, and the robot still drove after having a washing machine dropped on it at the end of the fight)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDEFAF7MdVA&t=4m15s  Beta is a newer design, has the advantage of the advancements in battery and motor technology and has the electromagnets to hold it to the floor. I think Beta would have been a real contender against the other bots in this contest, and one of the best anti Tombstone / Icewave robots as it's the only one capable of harming them when facing their weapon, without having to take a hit from it as the hammer looks longer than the blades of either robot extend.  I'm really gutted it wasn't able to take part as it would have been the most unique robot in the series."
battlebots,3dv1z1,Alienturnedhuman,8,Sun Jul 19 23:54:44 2015 UTC,"""Oh look, Matilda is here to do absolutely nothin- OH MY FUCK!""  Matilda really was the worst housebot, but that was impressive."

battlebots,3dv1z1,nadarko,4,Mon Jul 20 03:44:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, during some side-competition which took place between seasons 4 and 5. Razer took Matilda out, as the producers were already planning on rebuilding her. She came back with a vertical flywheel instead of a chainsaw, and was much more deadly afterwords."
battlebots,3dv1z1,personizzle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:47:30 2015 UTC,https://youtu.be/_e4cHWS2758   Razor was awesome
battlebots,3dv1z1,KokoTheMofo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:23:36 2015 UTC,"When they added the flywheel Matilda went from being the worst robot to being the most deadly. Competitors stayed away from her more than any other house robot, and it was powerful enough to knock robots out of the arena.  The chainsaw did absolutely no damage."
battlebots,3dv1z1,Alienturnedhuman,2,Mon Jul 20 08:09:06 2015 UTC,PA 24k kinda sucked though. And I'm allowed to say that because PA's my favourite robot. :P
battlebots,3dv1z1,Craaig4,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:05:41 2015 UTC,"As an offensive robot it had fallen way behind the competition with flippers, pushers and spinners then being very common in Robot Wars. But it was still a strong robot, and the fact it could still drive after having the washing machine dropped on it from ceiling shows it could take a beating, but Terrorhurtz ripped it up in no time.  And Beta is a huge upgrade to Terrorhurtz."
battlebots,3dv1z1,Alienturnedhuman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:13:00 2015 UTC,Beta was entered into battlebots 5 and was denied back then because it was destroying the arena floor. Imagine what it could do now!
battlebots,3dv1z1,HiThisIsAFakeAccount,10,Mon Jul 20 12:37:16 2015 UTC,"For sure we need a lot more hammer bots in the field. When done right they can be as dangerous as a spinner scoring 1 hit knockouts as they can hit saftey switches, dislodge vital electronics ect.  Beta would've been the perfect counter for Stinger, Biteforce and could've smashed Icewave or maybe even Tombstone. Big shame we couldn't get to see that this year."

battlebots,3dv1z1,MikeNCR,5,Mon Jul 20 12:12:10 2015 UTC,For the most part no but they can be. It depends on how they're powered. It's harder to get a lot of energy into the weapon. Most hammers are powered by electric motors and only get the energy generated by the motor in a 180 degree(ish) arc. That's not much energy compared to a blade spinner or full body spinner that gets to spin it's weapon up over a longer period. The obvious exceptions being The Judge(pneumatic) and Beta. Beta in season 5 had a very large electric motor and some amazing engineering involving fusees.
battlebots,3dv1z1,Expired_Twinkie,3,Sun Jul 19 23:58:24 2015 UTC,What is the feasibility of building an internal weighted flywheel which can spin up and then instantly transfer it's momentum to an overhead hammer or axe?
battlebots,3dv1z1,Scimitar66,3,Tue Jul 21 11:30:28 2015 UTC,Spinners are their own worst enemies though. Every hit can send the spinner flying instead of the opponent. A hammer is way more reliable for getting Judge's Decision wins if it can find a way to smack the opponent over and over and over and over.
battlebots,3dv1z1,Xciv,5,Mon Jul 20 02:48:16 2015 UTC,I think Grant Imahara made a great point scoring robot called deadblow. Hammers are great if done right.

battlebots,3dv1z1,gustamos,3,Mon Jul 20 15:36:29 2015 UTC,"In a thread where ""dumb"" questions were asked, the builder of the Judge said that hammers only got about 5% of the KEnergy of a spinner, maybe 10%.  So not as effective, but most things aren't as armored on the top, so I dunno. It's a metagame call."
battlebots,3dv1z1,MyifanW,2,Mon Jul 20 13:50:36 2015 UTC,For people smarter than me: what is the feasibility of building an internal weighted flywheel which can spin up and then instantly transfer it's momentum to an overhead hammer or axe?
battlebots,3dv1z1,Scimitar66,2,Tue Jul 21 10:39:55 2015 UTC,"While in theory it might be a good idea, I think that the flywheel would have to be massive and spinning incredibly fast in order for the hammer to do anything. When the flywheel would hit the hammer, it would lose so much momentum just from the initial hit that the actual hammer might not be as effective."
battlebots,3dv1z1,Frenzal1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:13:03 2015 UTC,Are there any examples of bots with horizontal/45d/arc hammers
battlebots,3dv1z1,Ghost1990,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:39:40 2015 UTC,"As effective as ...?  I assume you mean in general and there are some interesting discussions on this board.  From what I gather,  basically yes.  Good for picking up points through aggression and damage.  Not as obviously destructive as spinners with some exceptions (like the judge).  This is partly because of improved armour on top of robots coupled with the trade off in power/kinetic energy they need.  They're still fun lil robots to watch although not as widespread as they could be imo"
battlebots,3dv1z1,Dtr45,0,Sun Jul 19 19:30:01 2015 UTC,"Wasn't there an old-school battlebot that had a big hammer that, when it came down, had such great force it would pop the robot back upwards. I think it was in one of the heavier classes but I cant remember its name at all."
battlebots,3dv1z1,ForceAndFury,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:59:25 2015 UTC,"There are a good number of bots that fit that description, though you're most likely thinking of Frenzy. In Robot Wars, Terrorhurtz comes to mind."
