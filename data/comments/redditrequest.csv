We were considering creating some tools for managing events, requests, stream recaps and all sorts of other content, as well as updates on the indie games he makes as he patches them and bug submissions however we figured reddit was a far more appropriate and convenient place for this kind of content.  If one of the admins could unban this sub, or even just transfer it to me that would be awesome. We'd love to share have the LachhhAndFriends community hang out on Reddit and this is pretty much the sole thing holding us back from doing so."

I'm wondering if there's any way to outright delete the subreddit and allow me to re-create it as a sub for my roleplaying game.  Any assistance would be really appreciated, thanks!"

It did not dox or brigade, and it had very few users (far less than r/shitredditsays) so any incidental voting had no impact on reddit whatsoever. The mods were also shadowbanned so whoever they are they should also have their accounts restored."

There are already quite a few advice giving communities out there, but I do feel like the stringent rules most of those places have stop some subjects from being fully explored on reddit. Of course /r/advice exists and has lenient rules, so /r/freeadvice would have to offer something different to grow. I'll subscribe and see what you do with it if you get it, can help out as well if need be."

redditrequest,3d2to3,slimabob,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:00:50 2015 UTC,"Main Issues:   Subreddit was created 3 years ago by /u/LordTowel , who appears to have 0 activity on their account for the past 2 years. I messaged /u/LordTowel about a week ago, however received no response. No obvious CSS modifications. This leaves the subreddit looking very bland and boring (I've made a mockup of CSS changes that I would make over at /r/WagnariaTest/ ). The sub is still getting visitors, although very few people post, likely due to the first two bullet points.   I think this sub could be much more than it currently is as long as some time was put into it to clean up the page and build up a community."
