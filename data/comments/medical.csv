Normally it opens when swallowing so the pressure inside your ear is the same as outside your ear. Because this tube won't open the pressure in your ear is probably lower than it should be, creating an annoying feeling. One thing you can try and do is close your mouth and nose and build up air pressure slowly, that can make the tube open up again. Otherwise you can also try take something that stops inflammation.

If it's a wart you can do several things: go to your doctor and ask them to freeze it away. Have it surgically removed (I don't recommend this: you'll have scar tissue on the plantar side of your foot). Another thing you could do is improving your general health.

The stomach can not be trained as it is a 'smooth muscle' and under involuntary control, working through your own body's natural actions. You can't stop your belly from grumbling, right?

medical,3dzxxu,swaggystarz26,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:01:27 2015 UTC,"Telling how much time a person has left is really difficult. It is completely based on estimation. I have seen people that were thought to die in months and survived for more than 3 years and people that were told to have 1 year left and died the next week.   Knowing how it is terminal is indeed based on how it reacts on treatment. There are 3 possible treatments for cancer. Surgery, chemo and radiotherapy. These can be combined or not.  Surgery has the best results. When a tumor is found and it can be easily cut out you have a big chance of surviving. Often chemo is given afterwards even if all the tumor tissue is cut out so you would kill small metastases or tissue you didn't cut out.  When a tumor can't be cut out (grown inside important tissue or to much tumors) your chances of survival lower significantly. They often try chemo and radiotherapy in the hope the tumor gets smaller and can be cut out.  If there are to much tumors in multiple organs, you just can't cut them out anymore. Usually you then receive chemo and radiotherapy to prolong your life and/or comfort.   This is a really short text of how tumors are treated. I hope I could help you in a way."
medical,3dzxxu,geazea,0,Tue Jul 21 10:56:06 2015 UTC,"If the cancer is uncurable, and likely to be a cause death, its termed terminal. You can tell its terminal if it is not responding to treatment (and growing), progressing causing the organs to not function properly and spreading to other parts of the body (metastasize). How much time a person has is sometimes really difficult to predict, but it can be based on how fast the cancer already has grown, that could give doctors a clue on how it likely would behave (grow) in the future, for example, a cancer that has grown and spread super fast may indicate a really aggressive cancer, and the person probably hasn't much time left, while other cancers can maybe stop growing, but remain, and the person can have years to live, really depends on the cancer, but also the experience of the doctor with patient with similar cancers. Remember that not all cancers are terminal. Some people are actually more likely to die from their old age for example, rather than a cancer they have. Hope that answered some of your questions."

I think it is nothing serious. Maybe it got slightly hit or used a bit to much. Give it some rest (like running isn't really resting because it can swing a bit).  If it isn't better in a couple of days or if it get worse (or it swells) you should see a doctor.

medical,3dx1dp,ParTxx,4,Mon Jul 20 06:16:42 2015 UTC,"In regards to the fatigue and chronic aching, it sounds like low iron levels. All of my family experienced it at one time or another. Thing is you usually need blood work to be sure, but it's a relatively small thing.  It sounds like much of what you are going through is interconnected. The fatigue makes you inactive, which can affect joints, memory, and weight loss in general. Exercise is shown to have positive impact on a vast number of health related factors, mind body and spirit. There have been studies that show a direct correlation between the level of activity and mental health, especially depression. Just food for thought.   Fatigue definitely gets in the way, but low iron levels can do that. Testing would determine if that is an issue for you.   Water intake is very critical, and may be an element in the UTI department. It's also, in my experience, a factor in the number of headaches I have in a given time frame.  I think that it sounds like you have a network of issues that kind of feed into one another, but likely stem from one or two specific conditions or deficiencies, like low iron or hormonal imbalances that, as I understand, are often related to nutrition and in some cases genetics. Fatigue makes you sedentary, which can affect your weight and mood and mind, and issues in those areas can lead to a host of problems.  FYI I am not a medical professional or anything but I have always had a keen interest in health, and the experiences I've had with my own family's health issues has kept me up researching long into the night.

It definitely makes me more confident in mentioning all of this to my doctor, having others agree that it's probably not just a bunch of random things I'm complaining about.   As far as nutrition goes, I feel like that's a great starting place. I hadn't actually thought about it until now, and I might ask my doctor if maybe seeing a nutritionist would be a good idea!

The hospitals business is getting him well, they've done that.  People come from all circumstances to cater to them all would be impossible.  I know that sounds harsh but that's the reality.  There are other mediums of help outside the hospital im sure, especially if you are as poor as say you say you are.  Do some research.  Further, the hospital is not where you go to recover, it's where you go to get what you need up tongue point where you can recover at home.

While it isn't the hospital's responsibility to heal him, it is the social worker's responsibility to try and find somewhere for him to go. I agree that he can't stay in the hospital forever. However, we feel that physical therapy could've done more while he was in the hospital (They claimed they couldn't put a chair in his room because it was on a different floor) and the social worker could work with us more.

The problem the hospital and my family are having is the definition of that point where he no longer needs the hospital's care. While he isn't sick, he still isn't ready to come home, in our opinion.

medical,3dsom8,XillaKato,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:46:31 2015 UTC,"That's definitely hemorrhoids. It seems to be external hemorrhoids but since you said you aren't experiencing pain, it could be a prolapsed internal hemorrhoid. But then again, once it passes the pectinate line, it is somatically innervated meaning you should experience pain. I'm only a medical student so my knowledge is limited, but from what I remember they usually resolve themselves. I'd suggest that if it gets any worse then definitely have it checked out. Best of luck."

You have gastritis which can be very painful and cause almost all of your symptoms.  The distension will continue to get worse until it gets better.  I know this sounds intuitive but it really isn't.  The key is to figure out what is causing the gastritis.  I can tell from your spelling you are in the UK, God help you having to deal with the fucking NHS.    What medications did he put you on?"
medical,3drsv9,Zygomycosis,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:48:20 2015 UTC,"Haha not UK thankfully, I've heard plenty of horror stories. I'm from Canada.  I'm currently on Tecta 40mg for 30 days, day 20 today. When I went to emergency he gave me Statex 5mg (low strength morphine) for the throat and chest pain and also suggested I take Restorlax (a laxative) for the constipation.  The doctor at the endoscopy never mentioned anything about how to get better. He suggested I watch my foods and gave me a list to avoid (spicy, tomatoes, etc) and that was it. Food doesn't even really affect it though so I don't know how this will help me get better."
medical,3drsv9,Zygomycosis,2,Sun Jul 19 02:05:29 2015 UTC,"Oh, I have worked with doctors from about every place in the world (I'm a doctor) and the ""oesophagus"" just screamed Brit to me.  Surprised they use it in Canada too.  Tecta (Pantoprazole) is a proton pump inhibitor, it will keep the acid levels in your stomach down to almost zero.  The morphine and laxative is pretty much standard fare.  The goal in gastritis is to first eliminate the problem food, drink or drug and then give the stomach time to rest and heal.  Avoiding spicy foods is a necessity here.  If you rest your stomach and continue to take the PPI, you should start to see signs of improvement.  Also, avoid alcohol at all costs.  Good luck."
medical,3dsfcm,slr999,3,Sun Jul 19 00:32:33 2015 UTC,"If you eat something containing botulim toxin then you will probably start feeling symptoms in 12-72 hours; you will have muscle weakness, double vision, breathing problems etc. Botulim toxin prevents fusion of the synaptic vesicles containing acetylcholine with the presynaptic membrane, which essentially leads to acetylcholine not being released into the neuromuscular junction. This leads to no action potential entering the muscle and inability of muscle contraction.  Death occurs because of failure by respiratory muscles.   Having said that, the chances of you suffering from botulim toxin food poisioning is extremely low. It is a very rare disease."

Gargle and rinse salt water twice a day (one teaspoon to about a litre of water) to keep it clean. It will heal eventually! So painful and annoying I know! The avoiding of acidic foods etc helps to reduce swelling, as does salt rinses, so that will hopefully reduce chances of biting again."
medical,3dq427,cannedbread1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:29:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, be conscious about how you eat.

Just be careful when you chew."
medical,3dpyth,Jaineel,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:47:26 2015 UTC,"Could be sub acromial impingement, which is primarily brought on by a biomechanical issue and leads to the rotator cuff switching off and so things bump into each other/ pinch. The most likely cause of this poor posture. Make sure that your shoulders are back and down when doing activities and that your shoulders are not slouching forward/up towards your ears. Avoid aggravating your shoulder/s as creating more pain only leads to more dysfunction.   Another possibility is that you might have some end range shoulder instability and might benefit from some specific stabilising exercises.  You could try a physio assessment and see what they think. It is difficult to give accurate info via the internet!"
medical,3dpyth,uhmatomy,2,Sat Jul 18 11:59:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's impingement or due to poor posture. It could very well be due to poor biomechanics, though. Impingement does not cause clunking. It is more likely a labral issue, especially given that he is a contact sports athlete."
medical,3dpyth,timisdaman,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:43:05 2015 UTC,"Impingement in isolation doesn't cause clunking but can, over time, cause the rotator cuff to switch off resulting in some end-range instability.

I usually take two PILLS and that gets things moving fully for me if I get stopped up like this for a long period of time. You should not let this laxative be a first resort laxative as you can develop a dependency overtime. If you have to use laxatives over long term make sure to see a doctor and a ""safe (non-dependancy inducing) laxative is miralax or lactulose. If it doesn't work, if you need to use it for more then 5 days, or if your stool is completely black go to a doctor. The fact that you aren't feeling bloating or anything makes this a bit less worry some to me. With all of that said I am not a doctor I have just had a lot of Gastrointestinal problems (see my post history and you will find I am still having them =( ) and aside from examining you this is probably a measure similar to what they will have you take to see how it persists.
