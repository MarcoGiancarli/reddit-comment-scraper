Since that festival got scrapped, I might look out towards the end of August for something (not necessarily a new song or even a 100% clear indication that they're working on something new) just because of the superstitions I had about NiFi. Otherwise, probably next summer if I had to guess on any new material, and any serious touring likely wouldn't happen until 2017."

This song to me sounds like a middle aged man going through a mid life crisis and being so tempted by a younger woman. He doesn't want to hurt his wife, but at the same time, this woman makes him feel young again and he doesn't want to stop seeing her. I am not sure if he actually had an affair, or if even anything about the song is true, but it sounds like he was getting a little too comfortable with another woman.

We all go through those periods where everything is confusing, we look back, wonder what could have been etc. Why would it make me sad?, if anything, I just find comfort in hearing great men such as him and others go through the same things as I do. Usually at the end of a confusing phase, before everything goes back to normal, there's this ""fuck everything, I just wanna act this shit out"" kinda feeling that is perhaps dangerous, self-destructive etc. But it's that kind of empowered ""I don't care"" feeling that I get from listening to it."

greenday,3djk5z,Kilalemon,13,Thu Jul 16 20:01:47 2015 UTC,So Nimrod is part of two eras?
greenday,3djk5z,DookieMays,30,Thu Jul 16 20:41:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, seeing as the album is so long it kinda stretches both eras. It has a great variety of songs. It's almost as if Green Day evolved as they were making it.  Songs like ""Reject"", ""Take Back"" and ""Jinx"" could easily fit on  Insomniac, stylistically. But also, songs like ""All the Time"", ""Walking Alone"" and ""Prosthetic Head"" could've been on Warning. So because the album has such range, it fits into both eras."
greenday,3djk5z,angelfromthecoast,10,Thu Jul 16 21:00:30 2015 UTC,It's just that good.
greenday,3djk5z,sirmonkey95,5,Thu Jul 16 20:58:26 2015 UTC,"When it comes to albums, I think Nimrod is the one where I can listen to it over and over."
greenday,3djk5z,aprofondir,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:39:59 2015 UTC,It's undeniably punk but also has some experimentation and an acoustic song so it can be a bridge between classic and new. It's a diverse album. ( AND I LOVE IT )
greenday,3djk5z,IHaveThisUsername,9,Mon Jul 20 13:43:35 2015 UTC,"I find your album choices weird.  First you list International Superhits, Shenanigans and Demolicious, but you don't list 1,039 Smoothed Out Slappy Hours (these are all the compilation albums released).  Then, I also find the listing of Foot in Mouth and Bowling Bowling Bowling Parking Parking weird. Why? Because they aren't even proper releases. AFAIK, they are a Japan exclusive, so I don't think you can't really consider it to be part of the Green Day discography, it's just one of those bonus things for Japan (most bands have bonus things for Japan, don't know exactly why). I don't think they are live EPs. Those are ""Tune In, Tokyo..."", ""Last Night on Earth: Live in Tokyo"" and ""21 Guns Live E.P."" (I think that's all?), but you only listed ""Last Night on Earth: Live in Tokyo"".  You could have also listed On The Radio there as a live album, although I get it that it is kinda weird being such an old recording and having only been released recently, so putting it on a timeline is kinda fucked up.  Yes, I'm being pedantic as fuck, I'm sorry.    Now that with my whining out of the way:  That's actually a pretty interesting separation of the eras. I've never had it on my head as a 5 part thingy. I always tried to fit it to 3 parts (1990-1995/1997-2000/2004-2014) but it has its flaws. The names you gave to the eras are kinda meh but I get what you mean by them.  I'm not sure if the difference in sound and themes between Kerplunk and Dookie warrants a separation, but there's definitely a world of difference in sound quality and mixing.  Nimrod is indeed an edge case. It doesn't quite belong to the same sound as Warning, but it's also definitely not the same as Insomniac. American Idiot and 21stCBD should always be coupled, yes. The trilogy maybe deserves an era on its own, but I think that will depend on what's to come. As of now I can see it being grouped with the previous era."
greenday,3djk5z,shizeldolphin36,5,Fri Jul 17 01:38:27 2015 UTC,Other EPs are included but not Tune in Tokyo?
greenday,3djk5z,shizeldolphin36,2,Thu Jul 16 20:43:39 2015 UTC,"I was debating putting Tune in Tokyo on there, but seeing as it's all Warning songs (bar, King for a Day), and it's not a video-concert like BiaB and AaF, I decided to leave it out.  There are plenty other live albums that I discarded too, like On the Radio."
greenday,3djk5z,shizeldolphin36,4,Thu Jul 16 20:51:50 2015 UTC,Foot in Mouth and Bowling Bowling Bowling Parking Parking aren't video-concerts either  :/

greenday,3djk5z,TomorrowMayRain065,3,Thu Jul 16 22:12:47 2015 UTC,This is awesome. I agree with all except for Nimrod being included in your Middle era. I always felt like Warning was truly a different sound and the start of a new era for the band.   Edit: Middle era not Revival.
greenday,3djk5z,mayguh,3,Fri Jul 17 00:10:04 2015 UTC,I was gunna try my hand at this but you beat me too it! I like the grouping but I might still do so because I personally think there is a lot more over lap

They are both incredible albums. Which one do I like more? American Idiot."
greenday,3div3y,ZILDJIAN2613,3,Thu Jul 16 17:50:30 2015 UTC,"I think Tommy was as much as an inspiration for American Idiot as The Dark Side of the Moon, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, The Wall, Ziggy Stardust, etc.  The Who's A Quick One While He's Away was also directly influential for Homecoming (Green Day even recorded a cover of it for a 21st Century Breakdown bonus song).  If you're asking which is a better rock opera?  Well, this is a Green Day subreddit... of course I'm going to choose my favorite album of all time.  Plot?  American Idiot wins because it's more relevant to me.  Iconic?  They were both immensely iconic in their respective eras.  Bigger impact?  I think musically, Tommy; but politically, American Idiot."

I'm not against nudity whatsoever, I just thought it was kind of a cheap way to make a boring video more interesting. The guys just looked kind of lame in that setting being married and in their 40's."
greenday,3d43q7,GlennStefani,9,Mon Jul 13 13:26:01 2015 UTC,"Billie, Mike and Tré all probably had to sleep on the couch for a few weeks after their wives saw the video. Not Jason though. He just watched."

greenday,3d43q7,YabbilyDoobily,4,Mon Jul 13 11:18:50 2015 UTC,One of my favourites from the trilogy. Was so pumped for Uno after hearing it..  Not a big fan of the midlife crisis themed video though.
greenday,3d43q7,foairdfvadr,7,Mon Jul 13 21:54:42 2015 UTC,"Overall a pretty decent song, bit of an odd choice for the single. I do quite enjoy the slightly retro sounding guitar solo for this track though."
greenday,3d43q7,ozoneplayer,7,Mon Jul 13 17:36:55 2015 UTC,"Stay The Night or Nuclear Family would have made great first singles.  Hell, Rusty James would have been a better choice over Oh Love."

BUT listening to it in the context of the album, made the song 10x better.  I realize how effective it was as a closing track, while also giving off a ""theres still more to come"" vibe with Dos on the way. I love hearing the opening chords right after Rusty James."

greenday,3d2qmc,GlennStefani,4,Mon Jul 13 13:20:08 2015 UTC,Nice! I was at this show. Can't believe it was 14 years ago.
greenday,3d2qmc,JoeBeef,5,Mon Jul 13 16:11:18 2015 UTC,For real? Apparently the band's shows were a lot different back then
greenday,3d2qmc,JoeBeef,5,Mon Jul 13 16:14:58 2015 UTC,"Yep, this was around the time the guys really started to become an arena band. I saw them the previous time they were in Toronto less than a year before and they were still playing relatively small venues. For this show, they were in a hockey arena (still minor compared to where they play now), had confetti drop at the end of the show and had big siren lights flash on stage as they hit the stage. Jason only played 2nd guitar on Warning songs (which were new at the time), Platypus and not much else as he was not a full member yet. They were also accompanied by 2 horn players for a couple of songs, but less frequently than Jason. As for the performance itself by the guys, not much else was different. Billie still engaged with the crowd as much as possible in-between songs and during songs and all three kicked ass."
greenday,3d2qmc,GlennStefani,6,Mon Jul 13 16:22:33 2015 UTC,They used to spend a good 20 minutes lighting shit on fire and destroying the stage after a set of mostly requests. The Warning tour fucking ruled.

I appreciate the fact that you threw it out there for everyone to hear, but I gotta say, you have some work to do. Your guitar playing was not in time. You took a bunch of breaks. Your guitar isn't in tune. You struggled hitting the chords correctly. Your singing in the pre chorus going from high to low when you should have just stayed high, and one time I think you choked on your own saliva. Lol and now that I just read this all back all I can think of is Fuck me right? lol Anyways dude I'll sum it up, Practice practice practice and I'm sure you will own this song. \m/ Rock on sir"

greenday,3d0cp0,bay1998,3,Mon Jul 13 01:35:19 2015 UTC,"Still cuts off for me during Billie's speech when he starts talking about how he met Tré. Maybe it's because we're watching on mobile or something? I'd try from my computer but I can't really do that for a long while. Oh well, thanks for trying man, I do very much appreciate that!  Edit: never mind, I just found out that Dropbox only allows you a 15 minute preview until you download the file or save it to your own Dropbox. I'll do this as soon as I have the chance.

To get better, what I did was just sang out as loud as I could whenever I was alone. No matter how bad I thought I sounded I would continue, repeating lines, and entire songs over and over again, and today I would say I'm at least a half adequate singer!   Anyways, great cover! Keep working at it man!"
greenday,3cyq7y,bay1998,2,Sun Jul 12 00:15:39 2015 UTC,"I would agree with /u/maxedouttoby on your vocals. They aren't that bad, but they could use some work. I started playing guitar with a friend who plays drums about a year ago, and I did vocals just so that we could have some. Now, we have been playing together and are starting a full band, and its pretty obvious that my vocals have hugely improved. I sing along to pretty much all my music in my car and when I play alone, and its had a huge impact on my voice. Also, do you have some sort of effect on your voice? It sounds like there's a little reverb or something?"
greenday,3d1kuc,PunkorTrendy,17,Sun Jul 12 19:44:25 2015 UTC,"No. Rock n' roll (punk especially) is a very political statement.   Here are a few things I find downright annoying...  *When I hear people saying things like ""Stick to your music..."". As if a musician can't hold a political opinion.   *When people are surprised by their political stance. Did you forget about American Idiot?   *When people don't understand that rock n' roll started as social commentary, a break from the norm, a way to speak out.   Everybody has the right to express their opinions."
greenday,3d1kuc,GlennStefani,6,Sun Jul 12 21:45:36 2015 UTC,"When people are surprised by their political stance   Exactly.  The other day I saw some people being annoyed by GD members supporting gay marriage. Hello? Have you actually listened to the songs? Coming Clean for example? Also have you forgotten the fact that Billie is openly bissexual?  And also being annoyed because they were against the confederate flag... Road to acceptance?  I mean, how can you even listen to Green Day if you don't somewhat agree with their political views?"
