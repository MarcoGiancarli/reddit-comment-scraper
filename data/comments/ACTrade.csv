ACTrade,3dyn8x,Decayedglory,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:08:25 2015 UTC,"ooh. As much as I really do need those two I'm going to have to turn down that offer. If you could maybe get me four of the more common items on my list then possibly maaaaaybe, but it would also depend on what they are.   The thing is I was debating myself as to weather or not I should trade that sci-fi wall as I am quite fond of it myself, however, it was not really getting any use so I decided to put it up for trade anyway. So as well as it being a really rare wallpaper it's also one I'm weirdly attached to haha.   But I put it up for trade and am willing to get rid of it, just not for only those two items. I don't suppose you'd be okay with me just giving you bells for them? I'll give you a lot more than usual because I really do hate to disappoint..."
ACTrade,3dyn8x,Decayedglory,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:18:05 2015 UTC,How about if I put in four gold roses as well?
ACTrade,3dyn8x,Decayedglory,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:24:36 2015 UTC,Hmm you sure do know how to tempt me... Have you got any other hybrid flowers? Anything orange or blue roses would be good...

ACTrade,3dvude,elluor,0,Sun Jul 19 23:29:17 2015 UTC,"When a villager moves out, they move into ""the void"" which means they're just kind of floating about in animal crossing space. When you go to another town, the void clears and that leaves room for a new villager friend to move in! (This is how I understand it atleast :P)"
ACTrade,3dvude,UnorthodoxSpanking,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:30:35 2015 UTC,"Oh! I see now, thanks so much :)"
ACTrade,3dvude,mouseears07,3,Sun Jul 19 23:32:35 2015 UTC,Kind of. When a villager moves out of your town they go into your void. If you go to someone else's town there's a chance that that villager will move into their town from your void.   The only way to clear your void is to go to a village with 10 villagers. But you don't have to clear your void to get someone to move in to your town.
