firstworldanarchists,3dbq1w,CorbinBleuCheese,14,Wed Jul 15 09:21:08 2015 UTC,Who shits on an escalator?
firstworldanarchists,3dbq1w,GhostOfWhatsIAName,26,Wed Jul 15 06:49:08 2015 UTC,"Shit is like cat hair, it insinuates itself everywhere somehow. Malls and movie theater escalators - shit is tracked on the bottom of shoes, the kind of people who bring their dogs into malls allow them to shit and piss wherever, elderly who don't have family to take care of them are notorious pee and poop leakers. Kids and drunks puke on escalators all the time I forgot about that. But all these legit answers are half-priced appetizers to the low quality meal that is my real answer:  The town over had a movie theater with an attached shitty restaurant, lets call it Crappleknees. A Crappleknees employee was fired, and angry about it. The escalator was right in front of the entrance door and led up to the movie theater. He came back later with his friends, took a ride on the up-escalator and proceeded to stand right before entering the down-escalator. He turned around, pulled his pants down, hovered over the top square of the down-escalator, and shat. His friends watched on hysterically as the Crappleknees Shitter dropped a couple of logs. They laughed and laughed as they patiently watched the shit travel towards them. As the shit made it to its destination, the feces were then dragged under the belt of the escalator. Immediately, the theater entered the Era of the Terrible Smell.   The building owner had to shut down the escalator for a few days as crews came to take it apart and clean it. That Crappleknees wound up closing a few months later. The escalator smelled like shit for two years. Every movie that anyone saw in that town for 2 years was tempered by shit. They'd enter the theater full of hope and excitement, but even before the high prices were to take them down a peg, they had to encounter the Terrible Smell. The Crappleknees Shitter, amasser of thousands of victims, the Man With the Terrible Smell, is an American terrorizer. Those innocent folks would go to the movies and hold their noses on the escalator, unaware of that horrible day that led to two years of pain and smelliness.   I spent two weeks in Iwo Jima buried under a pile of dead bodies. The smells I smelled there you could not even imagine. But I will always remember what I smelled in that theater. It was a vengeful stink. It was a stink for the ages. Somewhere, he is out there, capable of immense evil. Perhaps he found reemployment. Bosses of reddit, watch out how you treat your workers. Even if they are in the wrong. Because you might just be tangling with the Crapplebee Shitter."
