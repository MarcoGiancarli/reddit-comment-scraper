oculus,3e2gmz,CarquinVR,11,Tue Jul 21 13:15:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, another redirected motion convert!  Here's a working example that backs up your analysis - using an almost identical, naive center-return algorithm.  With radius of 25meters (width of American football field) I encountered edges about 6 - 8 times per hour, which I considered acceptable for immersive game play.  http://www.mtbs3d.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=138&t=14069&sid=79da17502faae882b1ffe0ae00c74908&start=80#p76401  Another thing you might consider adding to the simulation are stop-times.  Continuous travel is one end of the spectrum, but quite often virtual environments will contain quite a few points of interest like insides of buildings.  These don't have to be positioned strategically.  Even random points of interest will provide huge gains for redirection because as the player stops you can continue correcting the orientation at a slow but steady rate (~0.5 - 1 deg/sec)  For me, exploring virtual structures generally reduced edge encounters to < 2 per hour."

It was your work plus some other untethered setups I'd seen which inspired me to start this project in the first place, though I saw it on youtube first. Reading through that thread, I probably shouldn't be surprised to see my ideas (e.g. nighttime VR) already having been thought of. It's also really nice to see simulations backed up with experiment.   I actually didn't even know you could do unprompted minor turns like that. I'll have to add it to the toolbox.

I/m sure this would work for exploratory games, where you mostly look at the stuff. But with FPS shooters, wouldn't it interfere too much with your aim? Hm, if you have independent gun controller it rather shouldn't destroy gameplay.  Also, I wonder if it's possible to inject redirected motion to game which doesn't know about it.

Probably too dangerous for official support from Oculus, but even as a hobby project this has potential to go large.  Have you thought much about preventing players from colliding with each other on the field?"
oculus,3e2gmz,TheFlapJackStrangler,2,Tue Jul 21 13:45:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah. This particular algorithm is a center-seeking algorithm. For example, if you look at the low-wander run, you'll see the real path go to the center of the tracking zone repeatedly. Of course, that means you get a better density out of the system, but if there's more than one person it would be messy. There's a few methods I've thought of around this. You can also easily build circle-seeking algorithms, which for long paths tend to result in walking in circles rather than figures of 8. Move the centers of these circles around a little, and you can get a pretty decent reduction of collision risk for low-wander games (walking in a field simulator). You can also combine different algorithms. If you have communication between them, basic position-based avoidance should be pretty easy, and avoidance based on path prediction will tie into better containment as well. Mostly, it will involve moving some of the density of player outwards, so it will necessarily result in more breaks in immersion. Fun problem to tackle, though.  One thing to realize, is that an 80 meter circle is really huge. People will rarely find each other."
oculus,3e2gmz,DouglasteR,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:06:22 2015 UTC,"Another possibility is that you can change the virtual environment for each person and have them meet each other in their own respective virtual world. This might get weird as you might see the same person over and over again even though it appears that you are moving in a single direction. One solution is just to have the environment filled with NPCs and have the other person appear as one to each other, or as a player change appearance."

Should work even with games/applications that don't know about redirected walking i. e. with every VR game(or even non-VR, with injectors like VorpX).  Also, I don't think it would be considered more dangerous than 'normal' walking. It should be, on contrary, safer, as you're confined to small space. And with SLAM positional tracking, software knows about all obstacles already..."

I'd imagine any applications for redirected walking would have to account for this by allowing players to sink/float a bit to compensate.  I'd also bet that there will be tripping hazards caused by virtual elevation not matching the real world.  Perhaps slam could adjust the playing field in real time to match?"
oculus,3e2gmz,fingerflinger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:56:09 2015 UTC,"Well, you're always head-tracked, so any slight bump you you feel in the real world will match with what you should be seeing. But you're right in that we don't want any big rocks or anything in the way. That's why I mentioned a baseball park. They are usually well curated, and there's one rather near to me that's big enough.  What I feel is a bigger problem is the restriction on game geography, since the real world field will be fairly flat. The Throat of the World will be difficult to simulate, to say the least.  For the near term I'm hoping to extend lighthouse capability in essentially all aspects (range, FOV, and number), but in the medium to long term camera based tracking will definitely be far more appropriate."

However, there are some bizarre sensations when traveling continuously on virtual slopes while walking on flat ground.

The key is that we are terrible at walking in straight lines without our vision to keep us right. If you blindfold someone, or they are somewhere bereft of visual landmarks, they naturally walk in circles. Without our sight to help us, our bodies are unable to tell that we're not walking straight. So by gently and sneakily messing with our sight in VR, you can keep someone in the middle of an area despite them feeling like they're walking straight and true."
oculus,3e2gmz,mk4242,2,Tue Jul 21 16:18:58 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of anecdotal evidence that introducing ""inertial noise"" to your brain significantly reduces nausea from motion disparity.  There are some Russian groups that are providing experiences where they simply ""shake"" the participant around during virtual roller coasters and report very significant reductions in sickness.

As long as it generally corresponds with your visuals it can provide very significant reductions in discomfort.  Even walking-in-place can do this."

But probably, the biggest change that you notice when you switch to VR is when the car goes up a hill,“ he explains. “Our tracks have a lot of gradient in them, but we don't necessary reflect that as well as we could do, so VR really highlights that.

oculus,3e2p0h,vrmatt,3,Tue Jul 21 17:51:01 2015 UTC,"I like other driving games on the DK2 too but Dirt Rally may be the most fun to drive in VR, even though it's different than track racing directly against other drivers. When it's up and running, it's one of my favorite DK2 experiences. If you don't mind setup hassle, and already have wheel/pedals/shifter etc, I would recommend it. Otherwise you may want to wait a little longer until VR support is a little more refined.  The vehicles, roads, and force feedback are all pretty enjoyable, I think sliding around offroad is particularly satisfying in VR. Codemasters are clearly very serious about the VR implementation and have included VR improvements in the latest update, and indicate that more VR improvements are coming, and I am comfortably optimistic that by the time this game is out of alpha pre-release that the bugs will be ironed out for VR usage.  But using it with DK2 can be a nuisance to set up at the moment. (I'm still on Oculus 0.6.0) It runs in direct mode since the last update, but for me to get it to run correctly, I still have to set my primary monitor to 75hz (which for me I have to drop the resolution down low enough for it) - At least I think that's what's getting it to work, still sometimes it seems I have to start it twice to get the low persistence to kick in. Also there was a weird jaggedy edge effect that a lot of people were experiencing that I was able to resolve by turning on antialiasing transparency supersampling through a custom Nvidia profile, and I think I have to manually set the refresh rate inside the game back to 75hz each time too. I always can get it to work within a couple minutes now but it's not quite ""ready"" if you aren't used to messing with stuff to get it running on DK2. Graphics quality is VERY smooth when running but not up to as crisp as what I can get in some other games.  Dirt Rally menus and text screens aren't quite VR ready either, you have to lift the HMD quite a bit to make selections and there's at least one end of the race screen that isn't yet readable but isn't on the monitor either so I have no idea what I'm selecting, some kind of repairs or something between track stages, button mashing randomly seems to get me to the next stage.   Supposedly this will work with Simvibe with a little xml editing and the Dirt 2 plugin, I hope to test that soon as I am adding transducers to my rig.  I have the original Richard Burns Rally running on DK2 also and that is a lot harder and more frustrating to drive - almost too much work to drive. Dirt Rally is just way more fun in comparison, at least for me, and the much nicer modern graphics make me feel much more like I'm in the actual environment/location compared to lo-fi murky old-school RBR graphics."

I think they look at estimates like (how often the game is played) because I haven't touched it for almost a month then asked for the refund. and got my refund within a week.

oculus,3e2wqa,Sphearis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:01:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah came to say this, Trion Worlds Rift had basic DK2 support added last year. Unfortunately they hadn't properly adapted the UI and doesn't seem like they did anything since. Pretty sure that one dev just patched it in in their spare time and it wasn't a priority of the company.  A shame they haven't gone any further because the game itself is actually pretty fun, and has some nice looking environments. You can walk around in it in VR but can't really play it in VR. If they did put the effort into adapting the UI it would probably revitalize the game and extend its lifespan.

I want to get one of these headsets, however does the vive only work with the lighthouse stuff or can I use it similar to the way the oculus can be used?  Sadly I don't have room for the lighthouse thing."
oculus,3dzzca,OtterShell,5,Tue Jul 21 08:26:33 2015 UTC,"The lighthouse system is the only tracking system that will work with the HTC Vive. It is capable of tracking a whole room, but it doesn't require that you use a whole room - it'd be perfectly fine to just sit or stand.  However, from a software POV, it might be the case that most games/applications are crippled if you only have a tiny space. We just don't know what games/applications will be available and how good they'll be in a restricted space. I'd be patient and wait to see how the software looks at launch before pulling the trigger."

I would assume where possible that develops will try to put out products for both platforms. I'm sure there will be niche demos and games utilizing the unique aspects of each headset, but I really doubt it will be a hard and fast rule."

I'm telling you right now, the vast majority of Rift games are being developed for either seated or stationary (taking a few steps either direction) scale, and the majority of Vive games require a relatively large scale.  I mean this is just common knowledge for anyone following VR."
oculus,3dzzca,Shantoz,3,Tue Jul 21 18:12:23 2015 UTC,"Judging from the downvotes (not from me btw) the (arguably) largest VR community disagrees with you, and you're still not providing any sources. Without any information no one can do anything but speculate, but you're claiming this is ""common knowledge"" and that you follow VR relentlessly, but you can't give me a source (a real source, not speculation)?

Which part specifically don't you believe? The Rift part or the Vive part?"
oculus,3dzzca,Heaney555,2,Tue Jul 21 18:23:21 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I believe development on the Rift is more focused on seated experiences as that's been the core of the design for a long time afaik. That being said in order to compete with Vive I believe they will want similar full room experiences.  However, I don't believe that developers on the Vive are unwillingly to emulate that same experience in order to enhance their brand (multi platform launches) and to compete directly with similar Rift titles.   The way you describe it sounds like ""get your Rift for sitting down and your Vive for standing up"", and I don't see these two headsets existing separately like that, I see them competing directly over the same spaces with their own strengths and weaknesses as well."

oculus,3dzzca,evanhort,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:44:48 2015 UTC,"Actually we don't know whether the Vive offers 360 positional tracking when the base stations are in front only (Oculus solves this with IR LEDs on the back of the headset). We know that neither the prototypes nor the dev kits have this functionality, but not whether the consumer version will.  So there might be an extra space requirement for Vive compared to Oculus, in that you'll need a base station behind you somewhere too for Vive (unless you want tracking to break when looking behind you) whereas you only need to have one lamp on your desk with Oculus."

oculus,3e2g5t,huxley84,3,Tue Jul 21 16:02:37 2015 UTC,I like tower defense games I'll give it a go when it is released.   Sometimes i think people don't realize just how difficult it can be to make a game for vr that will run on phone hardware.   My suggestion for you is to hire someone to help with your next preview video.  I liked the dragon at the end.   But the production quality of the preview was sub par.  This really is something worth saving up and spending a few dollars on.  If you want people to get excited for your game.   Which I'm sure will be a blast.   Your gunna have to sell it.

oculus,3e2g5t,Gregasy,5,Tue Jul 21 14:50:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the honesty. A large part of our development effort goes into making features specifically for VR; creating gameplay flows that feel more intuitive and comfortable. (And, in this case, to do it in a way that fits within Gear VR's hardware constraints). More often than not, such comfortable VR mechanics are invisible or otherwise don't translate well to promotional material.

oculus,3e2g5t,Heaney555,2,Tue Jul 21 15:16:12 2015 UTC,Tip: put Gear VR in the video title. I think people think that a Rift version (if it's coming) will have this same level of graphica fidelity.
oculus,3e2t6j,roosterbobo,3,Tue Jul 21 15:00:04 2015 UTC,The jam was awesome! I've been into VR since the 90's but I now consider it to have officially started with the Vive. Everything else is like a window into the room where the Vive is like actually entering the room. You are completely immersed and unaware that you are standing in a real room with a bunch of people in it.  Imgur Here's a picture of the jam floor.  Our game puts you on a suburban porch with a bunch of kids running around. There are giant wasps (OK maybe bees) flying at your head and stealing your burgers as you try not to burn them. Kids are behind you eagerly awaiting your bounty.   The game was done in Unity. It took us a while to get everything running properly but there were support guys from Valve and Unity there to assist. We had to use a special Unity plugin to simulate the controllers so we could get some idea of what the interaction would be like. There were three Vive stations set up for people to test on but you had to wait a bit to be able to get onto one so the offline testing was critical. We were using a DK2 to test with. There were about 75 people at the jam.  I'm pretty happy with the way it turned out. It was a blast watching people play it and do things we didn't anticipate. The best was watching someone toss the burger behind his back and CATCH IT. The Vive is amazing.
oculus,3e2t6j,Malkmus1979,2,Tue Jul 21 15:08:55 2015 UTC,"Even though it reminds me a lot of Job Simulator I really like it! I think it opens up a different dynamic being in a backyard. There are lots of possibilities with this. Maybe your cell phone rings and you have to answer it while cooking (and you have to talk to your boss or wife), or maybe it starts raining and you have to cover the burgers, or the grill catches fire and you have to grab a fire extinguisher to put it out. I would love to play this game, so nice work."

I know it's a bit like job simulator but I've played it as well and there's a very different feel to them.

That all contrasts nicely with the martini-lounge music and innocent cartoony style which probably doesn't come across too well in the video.

oculus,3e2w7r,xxann5,6,Tue Jul 21 18:51:00 2015 UTC,"60 PPD : resolution of the fovea, the most sensitive part of the eye, in pixels per degree   From Visual acuity on Wikipedia :  ""The smallest cone cells in the fovea have sizes corresponding to 0.4 minarc of the visual field, which also places a lower limit on acuity.""  So that's 150 PPD for the fovea resolution.  60 PPD is what is considered a normal visual acuity (ability to discern everything on a Snellen chart). Average visual acuity is around 85 PPD."
oculus,3e2w7r,FredzL,7,Tue Jul 21 17:56:12 2015 UTC,"It is interesting, but the comparison seems forced. The 4k is not the greatest that humanity can perceive or build, is where technology has arrived today. As a refresh of 60hz on the monitor is not the same to 200hz in virtual reality. If the comparison was between 4k and one 120-inch screen with a resolution greater than the maximum capacity of the eye to 1 meter away, the results would be similiar.  We need to compare today with today, or tomorrow with tomorrow. Or today with tomorrow, the same technology. Otherwise it passes the message to obtain the same performance of 4k in VR is needed 15 times the computing power."
oculus,3e2w7r,Rafport,3,Tue Jul 21 16:10:39 2015 UTC,"MS doing it's part   For example, recent work by Microsoft Research demonstrated that foveated rendering could reduce the resolution requirements by 100X for a 70° display by decreasing the resolution for portions of the screen that are further away from the user’s gaze18. This is a perfect example of research that cuts across multiple areas: human optics and perception, display technology, and rendering techniques, and fundamentally changes the graphics paradigm to deliver a wholly different experience.   More importantly, when people ask how will we drive a 11k screen, 16k screen, etc THIS is how it will be done. Foveated rendering matched with a powerful eye tracking system is going to make that 11k screen far more relevant far sooner."

oculus,3e2w7r,linkup90,3,Tue Jul 21 15:27:47 2015 UTC,"In addition, this data transfer can occur asynchronously since AMD GPUs have independent DMA engines. By carefully partitioning the work when using two GPUs to accelerate stereo rendering , Affinity MultiGPU can cut the latency nearly in half and double the bandwidth and computational resources, and reduce CPU latency and improve CPU throughput (e.g., draw calls per second). This technique can be extended to four or more GPUs, by partitioning each frame within the eye (e.g., two GPUs render portions of the left eye frame; two other GPUs render of the right eye frame).   Always nice to hear it again."

I suppose it's a great game, I think to buy in the future. Surely you've already played even Richard Burns Rally that although graphically dated, has an excellent VR implementation (and a level of realism never equaled among rally games). I mention that game only in the rare event that you or any other visitor to the channel missed it."

oculus,3dztwu,VRJon,4,Tue Jul 21 04:23:17 2015 UTC,"I'm very glad to see that they made a lot of subtle improvements vs last year's registration process:   People who are actually accepted will be mailed a link that provides the ability to book a discounted room at the hotel.  (Last year, the codes were out in the open and discounted rooms were being booked on spec in hopes that you'd accepted.) A ""if you didn't hear back from us by this date, something went wrong-- please contact us"" date was posted.  This is greatly appreciated.  While I did get accepted last year, I didn't get the notification until a week before the conference.  Made the airfare situation... challenging.  You either buy cheap airfare early with the awareness that it may be useless, or you buy expensive airfare at the last minute if you're accepted.  A hard cut-off date makes those pros and cons much easier to weigh. Tiered pricing-- so greatly appreciated.  Many industry folks who don't bat an eyelid at expensing 4-digit conference costs paid a pittance last year.  Indies and students had to stretch hard to cover the cost.  The tiered pricing model will help make the conference accessible to a wider range of attendees."

oculus,3e1tnv,vo0do0child,2,Tue Jul 21 08:33:22 2015 UTC,"The main problem, for the formation of fog on the lenses, is the temperature difference. As long as the temperature dell'HMD is stabilized with that of the body, unfortunately they tarnish. Being very close, it is also easy to get dirty, but I would say that the different temperature is the main reason."
oculus,3e1tnv,Rafport,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:43:56 2015 UTC,"Ah okay, I had always assumed it was my breath fogging the lens. Didn't even think of body temp.

oculus,3e1tnv,Rafport,2,Tue Jul 21 11:33:47 2015 UTC,"I imagined that you lived in that part of the globe, with summer here the fog on the lenses is not a problem. You can try to do so: keep a few minutes DK2 in the head, raised, while preparing the game for launch or do what you want. The proximity to the body starts to transfer temperature. Then, before you begin, clean the lenses and positions the HMD on the eyes. You should greatly reduce the problem."

oculus,3e1tnv,IThinkTheOnionIsReal,2,Tue Jul 21 14:58:30 2015 UTC,"Buy a fan (seriously). I use a floor standing swivel fan and it makes a world of difference. I have it on it's lowest setting, it's a few meters away from me, and it eliminates fogging entirely - just the slightest bit of airflow across the headset works wonders.  It will be interesting to see if the material of the CV1 helps get rid of fogging without any active airflow."
oculus,3e1tnv,Ruuubick,2,Tue Jul 21 10:45:51 2015 UTC,I just use rainx windshield-anti fog. I use it in my motorcycle helmet. But the stuff works just as well on oculus eye cups.  You'll still get a bit of fog - but nowhere near as pronounced.
oculus,3e1tnv,Ruuubick,2,Tue Jul 21 12:40:56 2015 UTC,"Use your spit to clean the lenses, it seems weird but that's what scuba divers do to their mask to avoid the fogging, i do that all the time when i go to the pool or the beach !

oculus,3e1tnv,zonfar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:49:36 2015 UTC,"I believe ""fogging"" is a pretty widespread problem. One possible workaround might be to make the headset a little warmer (what Rafport said). Also, I'd guess that if the humidity in the room is very low, this should be less of a problem, so some air conditioning might be your friend."
oculus,3e1tnv,Ericshelpdesk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:57:18 2015 UTC,"Doesn't happen often for me, but I have a fan and leave the window open. Also - depends where you are in the world. Humidity where I am is pretty low, so fogging is rarely a problem."

I have no idea if this will wreck the lenses or not though. I've done it once with no issue when the fog was driving me completely nuts, but I've been afraid to try it again in case it ruins some sort of coating or something. You can also warm the lenses with a blow dryer for a few seconds. Doesn't take long. This is what I do with my Gear VR. Or, you could invest in the anti-fog wipes that others have posted."

oculus,3e3fdt,miltonthecat,13,Tue Jul 21 17:35:54 2015 UTC,I would assume that the university has some type of corporate account with both Dell and Lenovo in my experience that is why places like that limit where you can buy things. It's a pain to set up accounts like that for billing and support.  I would try to get in contact with the sales rep that has your account and tell what you want and your budget. You will often be able to get things that are not on there website.  Even if the university you're at does not have a corporate account I would still call them up and talk to a sales rep see what they can do for you customization wise.

oculus,3e3fdt,Tree300,0,Tue Jul 21 17:51:37 2015 UTC,"Given that the VR market will be quite small in 2016, I doubt many game devs will be thinking about how to further fragment the market by building anything specifically for SLI rigs.

oculus,3e3fdt,tumblr_kin,5,Tue Jul 21 19:01:29 2015 UTC,i think the point is not to build specifically for SLI rigs but to be able to support the feature so that SLI owners will see more benefits.
oculus,3e3fdt,cabebedlam,5,Tue Jul 21 19:05:51 2015 UTC,"Correct. And since this is a college VR lab, it's less about which games support which features, and more about what we can build in-house."

oculus,3dzfxt,VRising,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:25:31 2015 UTC,"A couple of interesting things. Unlike the Oculus registration this doesn't seem to guarantee you a spot. They are going to 'draw' names and you will get a text message before the show.  Also under their question of 'When would you buy the Vive?', earliest date given is beginning of 2016. No November or December mention or 2015. They are trying to gauge when people would be ready for purchase, perhaps to give them more time with refinement and content?"
oculus,3dzfxt,blumka,9,Mon Jul 20 20:03:44 2015 UTC,"The first option is ""directly after release"", the second option is ""beginning of 2016""."
oculus,3dzfxt,VRising,0,Mon Jul 20 20:18:48 2015 UTC,Yes but they avoided saying end of 2015. And they worded the other options as 'When would you buy a Vive?' not 'When do you plan to buy a Vive?'
oculus,3dzfxt,pexeq,8,Mon Jul 20 20:24:02 2015 UTC,Let's avoid overanalyzing the questionnaire when it's clear the person who made it is not a native english speaker.
oculus,3dzfxt,colmmcsky,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:42:54 2015 UTC,They definitely have native English speaking people at HTC especially in the marketing department. It's just a carefully worded promo is all I'm saying. They left it ambiguous as to whether they are releasing this year.
oculus,3dzfxt,blumka,4,Mon Jul 20 20:54:30 2015 UTC,"They definitely do. I think the person who wrote this isn't one of them, though. A native speaker would say ""Have you tried a VR headset before?"" instead of ""Did you try a VR-headset before?"", which is a classic mistake in translating ""Haben sie"". Also note ""personen"" is left untranslated in the ""About you"" section."
oculus,3dzfxt,pexeq,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:04:44 2015 UTC,Didn't notice the other translating errors so this makes more sense. Also translators have actually gotten pretty good if this is the case.
oculus,3dzfxt,1eejit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:11:43 2015 UTC,"What would be the difference between ""did you try"" and ""have you tried"" in this case?"
oculus,3dzfxt,pexeq,3,Mon Jul 20 21:48:41 2015 UTC,"""did you try"" would be used when referring to a specific instance. For example I would say ""Did you try the eggs this morning?"". ""Have you tried"" would refer to any time. I would say ""Have you tried eggs before?"". I would not say ""Did you try eggs before"". That is not a valid construction, at least in my dialect of American English."
oculus,3dzfxt,Vincehre,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:14:10 2015 UTC,"It's a pretty subtle difference. For questions meant to encompass your whole life, like ""Have you ever eaten cheese?"" or ""Have you eaten cheese before?"", the present perfect is used.   The simple past tends to refer to a specific event rather than a state, so saying ""Did you eat cheese before "" would be used if there was a specific time before which you might have eaten cheese or if there was a possibility you had eaten cheese soon before when the question was asked."
oculus,3dzfxt,VRising,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:30:09 2015 UTC,"Alright, thanks. I'd say I'm usually pretty good at grammar, but if I have to think about it it goes wrong."

You can't ask ""Are you planning to buy a Vive?"" and directly after ""When do you plan to buy a Vive?"" because it is not given that the answer to the former question is ""yes"".

Some suggestions:   add Wikipedia and eventually youtube in order to work towards guided tours add webradio from the countries you are (streaming). Streaming mp3 sucks in Unity, I know, but this would be cool, trying to mimick an acoustic backdrop for a given country. allow me to save out pictures, including their StreetView VR URL personally, I would also be interested in the metadata (when where the pics taken + timelaps for a specific photosphere, e.g. for constructions) is it me or is this WITHOUT 3D data? The panoramas are great, but flat - the previous streetview site you could browse to had 3d data if I remember well? so social stuff (facebook/email/etc.) is coming you saying? moar audio clips! Audio helps to immerse... add layers maybe? (Dunno how, but augmented reality style views would be cool) show me the fricking time somewhere :-) Like I said, I lost 2 hours in there without noticing, and I am still not done! add the youtube VR 360° vids to it! prebuffer the next photospheres for faster moving around? Build a bigger local cache maybe (I know there is one already, but still... even bigger) where are the planets? Where's the moon/mars/whatnot?   Need  to go back..."

oculus,3dxwj7,Nukemarine,2,Mon Jul 20 13:32:18 2015 UTC,"Great write-up.  Looking forward to using this later. Street View is just the low hanging fruit ready to wow people into buying VR.  Cool idea #1: I wonder if there's a way to search photos for their geo-tag, take you to the nearest streetview, and let you orient the photo to that location. Probably not that big a deal but the effect is kind of cool. I wonder what the effect would be if the orientation and scale of that photo is preserved when you move to photospheres further away.  Cool Idea #2: Mentioned before, but instead of moving 1 photosphere at a time, allow a teleport feature sort of like AltSpace and Janus. I assume each photosphere has lat/long so use those to create the teleport hotspots and use a scaled avatar to give reference to how far away that location is.   Cool Idea #3: People can add text then scale, orient and position it in 3D space for cool annotations. Again, it could be possible to keep this scale to be visible from nearby streetviews. Similar ideas were mentioned with YouTube 360video annotations.  Cool idea #4: The tagging and photos could somehow be uploaded to a server for others to see and assist. Might even allow for multiplayer in Street View which is fun to do in Janus VR."
oculus,3dxwj7,rx7dude,5,Mon Jul 20 14:06:52 2015 UTC,All good ideas.    #1 is interesting but probably not as high a priority as other features.   #2 is in progress and is basically working but not as well as I'd want it to for a release.   #3 and #4 are on the roadmap.  Multi-user exploration should be out within a week or two.

OpenGL is long overdue for a redesign - which is coming soon in the form of Vulkan.  Edit: I should add that they are indeed, more-or-less, equally capable of producing the same results (drivers permitting)."
oculus,3dyjj9,monogenic,2,Mon Jul 20 21:34:08 2015 UTC,"OSVR is that open source, platform agnostic API you are looking for. I may switch to it, if it proves just as functional.  I don't know enough about OpenGL & DirectX differences to comment... but I'm a big supporter of OpenGL due to its cross-platform compatibility."
oculus,3dyjj9,phr00t_,5,Mon Jul 20 21:38:37 2015 UTC,"But OSVR, while abiding by all the ideals of FOSS, is still controlled by a single corporate entity, which isn't ideal, is it? Admittedly, I never got why that would make OSVR, as an example, bad, since it seems to me like they're doing things right for the time being. One thing I am questioning about them though is how much they really want to concentrate their resources, and their future resources, to supporting multiple headsets including the Rift."
oculus,3dyjj9,Heffle,3,Mon Jul 20 21:46:09 2015 UTC,"In comparison, if a group doesn't have their own headset, how much motivation do they have to develop for any headset? OSVR & OpenVR both have hardware at stake & both are working together to support open VR development.  One is completely open source (OSVR) and has many contributors. I'm not sure how much more ""open"" you can realistically get."
oculus,3dyjj9,phr00t_,8,Tue Jul 21 02:49:25 2015 UTC,Thanks for working on this.  Although I'm committed to C++ and UE4 I want to see projects like this succeed.  I'm looking forward to experimenting with the OSVR HDK when it is released to the general public.
oculus,3dyjj9,1k0nX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:35:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's great to see people working on this.  I'm planning to commit to VR development when these first gen consumer headsets are released and it's amazing to see constant progress on cross vendor HMD support.  Hopefully these issues are mostly sorted out by the Oculus release, and we all can easily create experiences that work on both platforms."
oculus,3dyjj9,MiikaH,2,Mon Jul 20 19:17:35 2015 UTC,"I'm dedicated to this and I've already made a bunch of improvements. The OSVR guys are also very promising, so keep an eye on them too."
oculus,3dyjj9,phr00t_,11,Mon Jul 20 19:18:57 2015 UTC,"Continuing to develop with the Oculus SDK meant not supporting these other devices, which went against my inclusive nature   But that's wrong. You can simply do what most studios are intending to do, which is to use both the Oculus SDK and SteamVR (Cryengine, UE4 already doing this).  It's just a simple if else statement.  While this is an excellent technical achievement, I can't help but think that no developer in their right mind would use SteamVR without also using the Oculus SDK.  There are simply far too many features you'd be missing out on."
oculus,3dyjj9,Heaney555,15,Mon Jul 20 16:44:11 2015 UTC,"Author here. Yes, you can implement multiple SDKs in one project (you'd have to, because the Oculus SDK only supports one headset and one operating system). However, a project is much easier to maintain with one SDK & I've proven not only it works, but works very well. I've made a bunch of improvements already to this library after I wrote this article."
oculus,3dyjj9,phr00t_,6,Mon Jul 20 18:25:10 2015 UTC,"Considering the circumstances, personally I'd prefer it if OpenVR just linked into the Oculus SDK as a sort of wrapper, for Rift support. I guess that might end up cutting out Mac and Linux support for Oculus devices, however. Adding your own code to switch between them does sound like the best solution, though presumably you'd lose Chaperone support etc."
oculus,3dyjj9,phr00t_,7,Mon Jul 20 16:51:33 2015 UTC,"What I'm trying to show in this demo is: OpenVR gets the job done nicely. The idea that you have to use the Oculus SDK to target the Rift is naive. Don't forget OSVR,  either."
oculus,3dyjj9,Sinity,8,Mon Jul 20 18:27:32 2015 UTC,"Technically, you don't have to use either. It doesn't mean both of them are as capable with support of given HMD."
oculus,3dyjj9,HappierShibe,-3,Mon Jul 20 20:25:14 2015 UTC,"It's naive, or they drank the kool-aid.... Never drink the kool-aid."
oculus,3dyjj9,bluenote10,4,Mon Jul 20 19:16:47 2015 UTC,"When your project is JVM based and you want to support Windows+Linux+MacOS is it definitely not a simple if else statement. It's more like a big developer's nightmare: There is no official bindings from either Oculus/Valve and cross platform support in general is somewhere between ""paused"" and minimal."
oculus,3dyjj9,Heaney555,-1,Mon Jul 20 17:44:42 2015 UTC,Cross platform is definitely another situation but most VR titles aren't targeting multiple OS's.
oculus,3dyjj9,phr00t_,8,Mon Jul 20 18:23:34 2015 UTC,They are not targeting multiple OSes because the development environment to do so was lacking. My point here: it doesn't need to be.
oculus,3dyjj9,Heaney555,-2,Mon Jul 20 18:28:23 2015 UTC,But that's not the reason they aren't targeting multiple OS's.
oculus,3dyjj9,haagch,3,Mon Jul 20 18:45:04 2015 UTC,"There wouldn't be a reason to target a specific os anyway. The most popular engine for VR is unity. It has advertised ""1-click deployment"" to all major operating systems for a long time. I would bet 75% of the content on oculus share could be deployed cross platform with no additional effort, if the tool support oculus provides would properly support it. With proper tool support developers can still ""target"" windows and offer mac os x and linux versions with little to no extra effort. So far we don't know how many would, because they simply can't, except with one specific legacy version."
oculus,3dyjj9,phr00t_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:07:23 2015 UTC,I'm glad Unity is allowing targeting multiple headsets and potentially multiple OSes too. It is a very viable option that I would also recommend.

oculus,3dyjj9,phr00t_,5,Mon Jul 20 20:47:27 2015 UTC,"Windows is obviously the biggest player in town, so it makes sense to target that platform. However, if it was just as easy to target the rest, wouldn't that be sweet? That is what is happening here."
oculus,3dyjj9,Heaney555,-4,Mon Jul 20 18:47:38 2015 UTC,"But it won't provide any of the core Oculus features on other OS's, including positional tracking."
oculus,3dyjj9,phr00t_,4,Mon Jul 20 18:48:22 2015 UTC,"That is incorrect. Positional tracking has been confirmed working on Linux with the linked demo. Yes, v0.5.0.1 was required, but the latest version of OpenVR & SteamVR is supported. It is possible that CV1 could break backwards compatibility with the last Linux and Mac runtime available, and offer no alternative. I'm hopeful the open development community will find a solution, though."
oculus,3dyjj9,Heaney555,-1,Mon Jul 20 19:03:52 2015 UTC,"I am talking about the consumer Rift, which is what the developers we're talking about are aiming towards.  What commercial developer gives 2 shits about DK2s?   I'm hopeful the open development community will find a solution, though.   Or, instead, they could just use the Oculus SDK on Windows. My entire point."
oculus,3dyjj9,phr00t_,6,Mon Jul 20 19:11:59 2015 UTC,"It kinda sucks to have to maintain a whole SDK for one headset and one operating system, especially when all the other ones are playing nice together.

oculus,3e3nx4,Leviatein,4,Tue Jul 21 19:59:10 2015 UTC,I did the Vive game jam here in Vancouver and came back super impressed with the Vive.  The thing with the Vive is that you can set it up to fit in a smaller space if you want so it seems like its somewhat flexible to what your environment is like.  DK2 has head tracking so you can kinda stand and lean left and right but comparatively the range of movement on the Vice is much better right now.
oculus,3e3nx4,Soryosan,4,Tue Jul 21 18:36:52 2015 UTC,In one of the videos demoing the touch devices the tracking space was room sized.  It's a little more than leaning.

For the games I personally dont care about the tracking space and hope I can just stand and turn and use good old fashioned joystick movement that makes most people sick. I have no interest in teleportation or some form of redirection once I reach my boundary. What would be really fucking cool would be if you could set up multiple  lighthouse sensors in a huge area and attach a tracker to gearVR. Id be all over that shit. If it is open source hopefully it has good documentation and I can get my mediocre programming skills improved by November.

oculus,3dxjly,moozaad,15,Mon Jul 20 11:32:06 2015 UTC,"Should also point out there's a new option in DCS2 that lets you ""increase object visibility"" with options that equate to ""off, low, medium, high"" Essentially it overlays planes in the distance with a tiny image of a plane to stop the ""aliasing"" effect you get when a plane is at the distance where it doesn't quite take up a full pixel.  This is great for VR as the lower resolution screens and typical engagement ranges meant this happened a lot (sometimes planes could ""disappear"" in between pixels) and having a built in feature that addresses this will help regardless of the advancements in VR hardware."

oculus,3dxjly,owenwp,3,Mon Jul 20 23:11:03 2015 UTC,"Its not a commonly used technique, but there has been a lot of research on rendering objects to flat billboards at a distance.  Among other things it lets you use mip-mapping to filter the object down to as little as a single pixel, without any popping artifacts.  In the case of a plane that one pixel could be a bright glint when the sun hits the plane correctly.  And if the plane is much smaller than the pixel it would fade out with alpha blending.  It would be nice to see this technique used more broadly."

This actually worked really well and is pretty easy to do yourself. Unfortunately I've reformatted since and haven't really picked up DCS again with such vigor knowing that DCS2 is right around the corner! (lawl!)

The question I wonder about is, what will hand/finger tracking in a VR cockpit offer to those of us with a middle ground setup?  HOTAS but not an exact match for the aircraft.  Maybe not positioned exactly in the right spot."
oculus,3dxjly,ralgha,3,Mon Jul 20 15:11:16 2015 UTC,"The percentage of people that will have all of the switches in an A-10 set up in the correct position would be miniscule. Hand tracking, even without tactile feedback would be a more widely adopted control scheme coupled with a HOTAS. Hardcore simmers might have gloves that give some haptic feedback on the finger tips when flicking switches?"
oculus,3dxjly,bostromnz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:08:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, having all of the switches set up right would be super extreme.  Even just getting a small subset of switches would be tough.  But it seems like it's possible and would be hard to beat in terms of results.  Some dedicated folks will probably do it.  How well could gloves with haptic feedback approximate the tactile experience of touching and flipping a switch?  I'm guessing not very, but I've never used such devices."
oculus,3dxjly,AndrewCoja,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:19:19 2015 UTC,"No doubt someone will, but not me. I haven't tried haptic gloves either but reports of the current tech is a little underwhelming but with plenty of room for improvement."

oculus,3dxqua,tyrannosaw,9,Mon Jul 20 12:08:00 2015 UTC,"They did a poor job of explaining their vision for the game in the video. But from what I gathered the appeal is you play a retro game inside various environments (like the classroom) without getting caught; sounds a bit similar to Classroom Aquatic minus the quirkiness.   Which is fine if their goal isn't twice Classroom Aquatic for a team consisting of two developers. The money would be used to hire more people, but with an optimistic release date of January 2016 the game either won't change drastically or will be delayed. Asking for 62k just to essentially polishing up the game is a bit much. Having said that I pledged $8 as having more vr contents is better than none at all.  Edit: It seems they want to use the money to also make their next game/experience, Pixel Ripped 1979 while giving backers only copies of Pixel Ripped 1989. So who to say how much of the money actually goes to making the game and not the sequel? Seems like we'd be kickstarting their company rather than help them fund the game. I'd steer clear away..."
oculus,3dxqua,iShad,11,Mon Jul 20 13:07:30 2015 UTC,"Hi iShad, Sorry that we haven't explained ourselves well. Is it ok if I have another bash here?  Basically the demo we already released was very much that, a demo. It was an ambitious student project more successful than we had ever expected, but it had a long way to go before it was ready. The final game of Pixel Ripped 1989 is going to be on a much bigger scale, with minigames, zombies, a trip to the head teacher's office and much more.  What we achieved so far was on a shoe string budget, so naturally the art, animation, music all needs fixing and licencing. Not to mention the major costs of optimising for a proper non-buggy release on both Gear VR and Oculus. On top of this we now we have to have a proper business, with accounting, and legal fees and many more things that tend to get forgotten when you start up a company add localisation and QandA and things really mount up.  We are working on this game regardless of what happens, we aren't just sitting waiting for the Kickstarter money to come in. It would be really nice to pay the freelancers who support us in the process and make the game the best it can be but in the meantime we are developing our butts off.   As for further episodes, we are not asking people to pay for two episodes, just offering them the chance to back us by buying one. All of our target is going towards Pixel Ripped 1989. If enough people want 1989 it's just basic maths that we could get more than we need. We just want people to know that we take none of it for granted and every penny will go into this franchise. They would still be getting the episode they paid for for £5 (8 bucks).   Happy to field more questions."
oculus,3dxqua,stoofnie,2,Mon Jul 20 16:54:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for responding and taking the time to explain. I understand making a game isn't cheap, but my problem is the lack of details on how you planned to expands the game if you received the money. Features like zombies wasn't even mentioned in the kickstarter page, and some examples or list of mini games would be nice. Sorry to turn this into a Q/A but if you can answer these questions I think more people would be willing to fund the project.  Things I want to know:   Will there be a story/narrative? How long is The Pixel Stone, and will we be able to unlock more cartridges to play on the Gear Girl? What other locations are there besides the classroom and office? What controller(s) will be supported? What mini games can we play?   There are probably things I'm forgetting... but my point is asking for 62k is not a small amount compared to other projects and I'm sure you have your reasons so please be more transparent and share them with us, thanks."
oculus,3dxqua,iShad,3,Mon Jul 20 21:05:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for your time and understanding. I agree that we may need to explain more about the game. We will sit and try to get a update with more information. About your questions: Yes , there will be story/ narrative in both games Arcade and Real World . But the arcade game is the one that controls what happens with the overall game .There will be 4 levels and the boss battle. The demo was half of one level basicly. I had to cut down so people could paly at events really quick.  The locations will change with the easter eggs for zombie infection, duck hunt easter egg, classic tune from the 80s walkeman easter egg. Basicly we want to play with player is imagination as they play the arcade game, which is what happens in real life when we play games. Mind of a player :)  At the moment supports nes controller, xbox and Ps controller.  The game you play is Pixel Ripped, that game will reference other classics from the 80s but not have this cartridges for people to play it becaue we are not looking for coping this games but having a original arcade game that feels like existed in the 80s.  We want to reference old classics like Super Goals N Ghosts, Duck Hunt, Mario, Zelda, MEga Man, Tetris.. Basicly mate, this game is a game about beeing a gamer, the idea is that you will complete the game in the ""gameboy"" Pixel Ripped, by managing the distractions and challanges you have in real life.  To be honest, we did this demo with zero budge as my final project at uni , imagine what we can do with a real help. Give us some trust and we are not going to disapoint you . Keep in touch Ana"
oculus,3dxqua,Anagamedeveloper,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:08:26 2015 UTC,"Sure thing! I'll do what I can.   Will there be a story/narrative? The 5 games overall will have a narrative of time, we will see Nicola, (the protagonist) through different eras of her life and what the world is like during that iconic period of time, and to a person of her age. So 1999 she will be 21 and attending a gaming conference. A big difference from her life as a 1 year old playing her first ""faux""tari-2600 in her 1978 Livingroom.  How long is The Pixel Stone, and will we be able to unlock more cartridges to play on the Gear Girl? You are looking at approximately 40 mins, and unlike the demo that throws you into the deep end, we will be designing the Pixel Ripped ""GearGirl"" game to slowly increase in difficulty to get people used to playing it again! The game will be broken into 3 levels on the ""GearGirl"" - (like the old arcade games used to do), and each will trigger a new situation in the classroom until you reach the epic boss fight. (which will also be different from the demo - we don't want to make it too easy for you!)   What other locations are there besides the classroom and office? Good gameplay is not about chucking loads of different locations,  1989 is all going to be school based. We only want to put in new locations if it adds to the game and the story. What we will have is different classroom mechanics as the game progresses, and different action from the other characters. The HeadMasters office is an EasterEgg (sorry spoilers!) but one that results in a new location, a new mini game a new character and more.  What controller(s) will be supported? We will be supporting everything we can. The xbox controller will obviously work and we will be looking at the Steam controller also. We've always played it on a snes USB controller that we found online. It gives the best experience!     What mini games can we play? This is a hard one to answer on a public forum, because our game is all about rewarding the gamers who explore. Many of the mini games are going to be hidden eastereggs that have been designed to surprise the person playing. The best thing I can say is that we have designed them to not only homage the best games of the era, but to pay respects to the music and film of the time!"
oculus,3dxqua,stoofnie,4,Tue Jul 21 12:01:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks ishad for your feedback,  it help us to improve the kickstarter campaign. We tried our best to be clear at the campaign about how we would expend the money. The demo, my final year student Project from last year,  was 5-10 min long, the full version of 1989 will be 40min - a hour long. We are doing what  many fans asked us to do it and also what I couldn't had done as a student.   Classroom Aquatic is a great game, thank you for comparing our game to then, but in Pixel Ripped you are playing a game in the classroom, I agree that is also in a classroom but you are not making a exam and the main goal in our case is to complete the game you are playing on the ""gameboy"" which is Pixel Ripped , this game comes out from the console and that is maybe what is missing in our kickstarter video. Thanks a lot for sharing your opinion with us. The game is more then the classroom(a environment), so I agree that maybe is confusing to see just that bit of gameplay on our kickstarter video. Here is a link to a longer video that shows what is Pixel Ripped full demo gameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyGjZe24R78  Keep in touch, we want to make sure everything is clear.

Windows 10, DirectX 12, and VR SLI/Crossfire are all huge wildcards that shake up any estimates as to how price/performance will scale. With the possibility of sharing VRAM and rendering one eye per card or fractions of a view split across 2+ cards, we could potentially see the optimal price/performance ratio shift upwards.  For now, I'd say a tentative ""no"", in that with current technology, a 1.5x increase in price from $1000 to $1500 will not give a 1.5x increase in performance. And even if it did, this would not be a 1.5x improvement in experience (though this is subjective of course). And due to Oculus releasing their recommended specs, the experience around that level will receive the most attention/optimization, so I wouldn't plan for as much attention to go into optimizing for higher performance equipment.  But who knows! For this first generation VR, I'd say the optimal price will be a PC somewhere around $700-900, but in the future if VR catches on in the way we hope, I could see builds in the $1000-2000+ range become more popular and eventually the optimal experience! Or even if not, then I could see the rising demand for high power PCs due to VR increasing competition and incentive to research higher performance equipment, pushing up price/performance at the mid-range relative to its current trajectory. This is purely looking to the far future, though, and to reach these points VR would have to disrupt more than just the gaming industry."

oculus,3dzu0f,pygmyowl1,3,Tue Jul 21 02:05:08 2015 UTC,"Cause it's expensive, niche, and EVGA is a relatively small American Company, so stuff doesn't get made in bulk bulk bulk. Lots of machining that goes into making the Hybrid."

I've already got two machines, but plan on building a whole new one soon after the CV1 release/similar. I'll likely be getting upper-tier components, but not buying a new GPU, and instead just drop my current GPU into the new build, wait for a while and see what happens in the GPU market toward the end of 2016. Unless some games/experiences come along that I'll be pining for, but can't run. Then I might pull the trigger on a GPU choice sooner."
oculus,3dzu0f,merrickx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:07:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if this PC is solely for VR gaming, wait until we're less than a month away from releases (Vive or Oculus), and then look at the prices. New CPU's are coming out and motherboards and ram prices change all the time. I would wait until then, HOWEVER, to answer your question, currently a 970 is listed as the recommended specs, so developers are Aiming for a 970 for optimal experiences. Now not everyone will care. Some devs will make games you need a Titan X to get a good experience out of. I would always say, spending $1500 will get you a more futureproof machine than a $1000 machine will give you.   http://pcpartpicker.com/p/Pq4s7P would be a solid $1500 machine  http://pcpartpicker.com/p/PVcbYJ would be a solid $1000 machine.   Obviously, the $1000 machine makes some concessions, and the $1500 really makes it happen. What my perspective is, is that the $1500 machine will guarantee you dominate VR. The $1000 is just the recommended specs, so if they ever increase, you'll need to upgrade to keep up."

My advice to everyone building for VR is simple... you can skimp on almost all your hardware (instead of an i7 chip get an i5, or 8GBs of ram instead of 16, or an SATA drive instead of SSD) and it won't make a single frame rate of difference. So skimp on everything that won't effect your Frames Per Second, and spend that money on whatever THE MOST POWERFUL gaming card is on the market. When it comes to VR, it's not about the PC, it's all about the card.  NOTE: Do not buy two lesser cards thinking you can SLI/Crossfire them. VR and the current cards do not play well together, and you will have wasted money on two insufficient card when you could have bought a single great card."

True enough for the current SLI drivers, which aren't even for VR (nothing to do with the card) - but both Nvidia and AMD are working on GPU-per-an-eye drivers, which will be compatible with cards on the Oculus recommended spec."

oculus,3dzu0f,xcxv,-3,Mon Jul 20 22:47:31 2015 UTC,"The $1500 pc should last you about 1/3 longer than a $1000 pc, assuming you spread out the extra $500 evenly over all parts. :) And it would last more than 1/3 longer if you just split the extra $500 among a better cpu  and gpu."
oculus,3dzu0f,Joomonji,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:38:48 2015 UTC,"The price/performance ratio is not the same across all price ranges. Both lower and higher cost equipment will have a lower price/performance ratio than mid-upper range equipment, meaning you're getting less performance for every dollar spent. So you can't extrapolate linearly based on price."
oculus,3dzu0f,sabrathos,0,Tue Jul 21 02:05:47 2015 UTC,"If you take the extra $500 and spread it evenly across the components then it would come out to about an extra $15 to $20 $40 to $50 per component for the $1500 option. Most of those components are still in roughly the same competitive price range as the cheaper options. So it's relatively safe to extrapolate. I was wrong on the part about that equating to 1/3 longer lifespan though. Spending more money on the pc case, power suply, etc would not necessarily lengthen the performance lifepan of the system.  However if you just use the extra $500 for an improved cpu and gpu, that would mean upgrading possibly from a GTX 970 to a GTX 980 TI for gpu. And upgrading from a Intel i7 4790K (4 cores) to an Intel i7 5930K (6 cores). Those changes would equate to about a 1/3 longer life span in the mid-range tier of performance."

oculus,3dytle,pineneddle,4,Mon Jul 20 17:25:49 2015 UTC,To get a first impression you can watch EmptyBox's review on Youtube:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b68LhOEJdhU  He has a few more GSCE races which show that it is apparently very enjoyable:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi14X7H8SSI  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu_K_AftEbU
oculus,3dytle,bluenote10,3,Mon Jul 20 17:55:46 2015 UTC,"It's one of the most well rounded racing sims at the moment, great car selection, especially open wheeler, great AI and great physics and best of all the performance of the game is fantastic, so running it at 90+ fps is a non-issue. You also have a metric heapload of mods available and can convert most rFactor mods to it (or just download mods converted by somebody else).  On the downside, the graphics engine the game runs on is a rather old and misses some fancier effects, most obviously in-cockpit realtime shadows. Public multiplayer is also rather empty. And some of the configuration can be a little fiddly (i.e. expect to open a .ini file in a text editor from time to time).  Either way, I didn't have as much fun as with Stockcar Extreme with any other game in a long long while. It's really good once you get the hang of it."
oculus,3dytle,grumbel,3,Mon Jul 20 21:01:23 2015 UTC,"It's an excellent sim with one of the best FFB in class. rFactor engine is a very solid foundation and with their recently aquired license of the engine's sourcecode they can do even more things in the future. Don't let yourself be put off by the name or the track & car selection, it's a great package. Plus there's nice modding support.   You can check out the free 30 day lite version from their website if you're interested or the free game Copa Petrobras de Marcas on Steam.

oculus,3dzeci,Bone008,3,Mon Jul 20 19:42:34 2015 UTC,"A little background:  After I got my DK2 in February, I noticed that most of the available demos and games were lacking interactivity, or relied heavily on traditional keyboard or controller input. While input is limited with the DK2, you can still do a lot of fun things with head tracking alone.  This game sets out to make use of head tracking in a way that I have never seen done before: You control a ball with your head and have to navigate it through puzzle levels as fast as possible, but without touching any walls.  This requires precision and skill. It's easy to get into, but hard to master.  Another feature I experimented with was the sense of scale that is inherent to a VR headset: Because of positional tracking, it makes a big difference if the board is 20 cm in size and right in front of your nose or 10 m in size and very far away. So in Don't Touch the Walls, you can experiment with the board settings and see how it affects the gameplay.  There are currently 9 levels. Depending on the feedback I get (any is appreciated!), I might create new levels with new unique puzzle elements. VR both limits the options for viable elements and creates awesome new possbilities.  Enjoy!    Note: The game is also available on WEARVR. If you don't have an Oculus Rift or an Oculus Account, you can download it there as well and play it in non-VR mode with the mouse. It's less awesome, but still worth a try."

oculus,3e10va,iliketurtlesdurr,4,Tue Jul 21 03:15:09 2015 UTC,"All of that plays nicely with the simulated reality theory.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_reality#Simulation_argument  After a fashion from what I am given to understand about the concept is that, statistically if high enough quality simulated realities can exist we're almost certainly living inside one by virtue of the fact that they should outnumber actual realities.  Personally I find that whole concept to be far too self contained though. It seems like somewhere between a cross of a determinism and solipsism. Completely embracing those sorts of ideas could wind up with someone divorcing reality under the belief that nothing they do matters, or even perpetrating heinous events under the same misinformed belief.   If reality is a simulation, it expends a ridiculous amount of resources on things that don't really matter. After all, you could immediately free up crazy amounts of resources by implementing virtual reality. Why then impose odd vestibular sensation ""bugs"" that interfere with the ability to easily and quickly effectively strip people of actual agency and impose a new form of ""real"" events in the form of the virtual world. At the same time you'd be able to absolutely justify and explain that to the simulated people, given the nature of the virtual.  I suppose one could argue that if it wasn't something that the simulacra had to strive toward and work for then it wouldn't be convincing. But of course, that really makes no sense. Anyone who is born today will grow up alongside Virtual Reality and the failed earlier iterations, and current growing pains of the medium, will simply not exist for them in any meaningful sense. Why then would a simulated environment not start with a fragmented past and begin the actual simulation further along in history. After all, you'll both be able to allow your simulations more freedom in the form of expanding their worlds heuristically while avoiding a need to devote as much effort in actual individual experiences.  While I find all of that fascinating in a philosophical discussion I once considered writing a work of fiction about the subject and found that anywhere I could go was hackneyed enough that it was difficult to really do anything new enough with the subject matter to justify the work. Then again, I've felt that way about everything I write, maybe I should just stay away from tvtropes.org but I'd like to avoid writing something that was trite. Well I mean, other than rambling on at length in posts across all manner of subjects in this subreddit."

oculus,3e10va,lolomfgkthxbai,2,Tue Jul 21 05:12:28 2015 UTC,"Since the real world is the only reality we know, it might be wrong to claim it could be simulated; we have no reason to believe just because the world doesn't work the way we think it did, that it meant there is a ""real"" world out there somewhere else that matched our expectations.  Let's use this analogy; when the human race realised that Earth is not flat, do we assume that Earth is special/fake for being a sphere and that every other planet is flat?  If the only reality we know uses Foveated rendering, it doesn't mean it is faker/illusionary; it just means that is how reality works and we were too ignorant to notice until now. Much like there is no point arguing if light is a wave or a particle, it is neither and our previous preconceptions were wrong.  Reality is what it is. It isn't strange, it isn't unusual. We can't say it is strange because technically we have nothing ""normal"" to compare it to."
oculus,3e10va,VallenValiant,-1,Tue Jul 21 04:28:42 2015 UTC,"well first off, the world is more likely to be a hologram than a real world. this is law of probability, because moving into the future, there are going to be more hologram worlds than real worlds.  so given that our world is more likely to be a hologram than real, then this quantum shit shows that this simulation uses foveated rendering.  I'm not saying that foveated rendering proves that the world is a hologram. you got the causality backwards. Notice that the title uses the word ""if"" and ""then"", with the if clause stating the presumption (that the world is a hologram), and the ""then clause"" stating the conclusion. Not the other way around."
oculus,3e10va,VallenValiant,3,Tue Jul 21 04:34:42 2015 UTC,"Your argument still assumes ""the real world"" exists outside the ""fake"" one.  Using my analogy earlier, that is like saying somewhere else is the ""real Earth"", where the Sun revolves around it, it is the centre of the universe, and it is flat on the back of 4 elephants. And that the spherical earth we are currently on is a hologram.  We only know ONE world, right now. The one we are in. You can't assume that just because it doesn't function the way you believe it should, that it is therefore fake. It is just as plausible that ALL worlds use Foveated rendering, we have no baseline to compare it to.  The term ""real world"" is not an abstract concept, it isn't a mathematical certainty. ""The real world"" is the observable world we are in, and until we see other worlds this is the ""real"" one. And every time reality no longer fit what we believed, we don't say the reality is wrong; we say our belief was wrong and correct it."

Palmer Luckey said that most games, in his opinion(and from what devs told him), won't target room-scale. In the same interview, he said that technically it's possible.   Also it's true, all the games have been designed as seated experiences.   Oculus don't make all the games. Oculus makes a few ones.  Ah, and as Vive won't have exclusives(as you all assert), then both platforms will have the same amount of room-scale games."

Quite why the latter counts as artificial when these companies operate in a commercial and competitive environment I'm not sure.  As for the Vive not having exclusives other than for technical reasons, I don't think I've seen any basis for that assumption."
oculus,3dv3yt,mutebobby,6,Mon Jul 20 12:53:44 2015 UTC,"So... yeah. As always, If Oculus does something, it's a huge problem, but if Valve does... well, hail Gaben.  There is no technical reason to do Vive exclusive. If there is, show it. No, Vive is not technologically superior to the Rift - they are quite on par, in fact."
oculus,3dv3yt,Sinity,-1,Mon Jul 20 11:51:48 2015 UTC,"Of course there is, the Rift doesn't come with motion controllers and doesn't have room scale tracking.

The problem is artificial exclusivity."
oculus,3dv3yt,linknewtab,3,Mon Jul 20 12:30:15 2015 UTC,"Games will only be exclusive to the Vive for a short time until the Touch controllers ship, the Rift does have roomscale tracking.  Not as large as 15 feet by 15 feet most likely, but large enough and I kinda doubt any games will require having that much free space, because developers like having people play their games and so their games will be playable with a more usual space availability."
oculus,3dv3yt,Saytahri,5,Mon Jul 20 13:43:58 2015 UTC,"Not as large as 15 feet by 15 feet most likely,   Yep, it's something like 10x12 feets or around that. Or bigger. We don't know upper bound, because E3 booths were 12x12.  On the other side, Vive don't have 15x15. Common misconception. From their documentation(yep, their official documentation), it's 9x12 feets. You could try, of course, increase it beyond that(probably sacrificing a bit reliability/accuracy), but the same applies to the Rift.  So, they have the same technical capabilities in this regard. I don't see why this discussion goes on and on.   because developers like having people play their games and so their games will be playable with a more usual space availability.   That's exactly what Palmer said. That it is capable of room scale, but devs told them they won't focus on it. And fanboys figured it out, like he said that Rift won't have room-scale tracking. Because.... ""logic"".  Well, I'm not surprised, as in old days they claimed that Oculus is ""only seated"" because Oculus said so. Even if they said it was for legal reasons, they still insisted that ""Vive is for standing, and Rift is for seated experiences"". Despite evidence that it isn't true and common sense(that game can't distinguish between you standing and you sitting)."
oculus,3dv3yt,Sinity,3,Mon Jul 20 15:07:22 2015 UTC,"the Rift doesn't come with motion controllers and doesn't have room scale tracking.   a) Rift have room scale. Lie repeated thousand times doesn't change the truth.  All your argumentation that it haven't was based on Oculus saying that devs aren't gonna use it. Then I said that if Vive won't have exclusives, there will be equal amount of room-scale games on both platform, which you refuted by saying that rift doesn't have room scale. Do you realize it's circulout reasoning? A isn't true because B, and B isn't true because A. That's your argument.  b) Rift will have motion controllers within months after release of HMD. And people who buy HMD before that are enthusiasts -- they fucking know that motion controllers are practically necessary, and they will buy them.   If Oculus would develop a game that only works with the gesture sensors of the Touch controller, nobody would have a problem with it beeing exclusive to Oculus. The problem is artificial exclusivity.   They surely use gesture sensors. Because they're here, so why wouldn't they?"

oculus,3dv3yt,Malkmus1979,5,Sun Jul 19 20:33:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly I'm more excited about entertainment experiences than I am about games (and I'm damned excited for games) if only because with games it's sort of a more immersive version of the interactive experiences you've had for years (not to undersell it just hear me out) but with entertainment experiences, films, nature documentaries, etc. it's adding an unprecedented level of immersion and interaction to something that was traditionally at best on a 2D screen with a sense of depth added by 3D glasses."

What Vive is trying to pull off, is making experiences out of games. Having the ability to physicaly move inside VR world and having realistic hands interaction is turning games to more of a playfield type of experience.  I think that's the way to go for VR. It's its main strength."

oculus,3dv3yt,Saerain,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:15:32 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree but moving around in and interacting with a virtual world is already what games are, vive just promises to be infinitely more immersive. A film in which you have free reign to look around and you're in the film as you experience it instead of just watching a fixed camera is entirely new and unique.  Both prospects are new and exciting but the film applications are just a bit more novel to me."
oculus,3dv3yt,VeteranKamikaze,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:45:10 2015 UTC,"In my experience, having space (even if limited) to naturally move around and hands (even if abstracted as ""tools"") add more than just higher immersion to VR. It gives you a sense of being in a real physical space that you can interact with. Since you take away the high abstraction of moving through space with controller and interacting with a click of a button, the games don't feel so much like games anymore. Playing Hydra Cover Shooter felt more like a session of Paintball than your usual FPS game. On the other side, Time Rifters is pretty much standard FPS, except you now have the ability to look around with your head. In that regard it feels more like a ""novelty"" and to me it kind of defeats the purpose of VR.  What I'm trying to say is, once you start to remove abstractions from VR, games and experiences (movies, documentaries, etc..) start to merge together. Some are more interactive, other less, but they both try to move you in a new ""physical"" space."
oculus,3dv3yt,Gregasy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:59:53 2015 UTC,"I think our only disagreement here is on what we'd call higher immersion, then.  To me you just described higher immersion.

So, why these people who were negative about Oculus having headphones included are mostly silent now?   butthurt fanboy    I'd be equally butthurt if situation was reverse, and everone would constantly make dumb arguments attacking Vive.

I'd imagine the Wired Author (and Possibly game creator) are thinking more of a ""Wii Sports"" effect.   Bowling and Tennis definitely took a ""mini game"" and turned it into a huge hit.  One could argue it even sold an entire console on the idea.  I think this one has merit (with all things of this nature there is always going to be some amount of uncertainty, chance and luck involved in whether or not it succeeds), the ""character"" of the game almost gives the surreal ""Portal"" vibe (ie. slightly dystopian, things aren't exactly as they seem ) which could possibly give it legs.  Especially if VR wants to go mainstream, experiences like this could be one of the ways to kind of spear head that advance.  But like the Wii itself, not really that appealing to more serious gamers, but thankfully unlike the Wii VR has many more applications and uses (in terms of more interesting/deep game experiences)."

oculus,3dxm6f,MrDanielVR,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:10:20 2015 UTC,"Good point. While in the article I think the author of the game mentions that he has seen actual success in a group/social experience with the game, since it's only 1 player at a time, that might not have exactly the wild appeal that the original Wii did, with it's multiplayer games.  Still based on that, I'd say it does seem to have some potential. Maybe not as a breakout hit like the title states, but more of a very successful ""gateway experience"", something that provides an accessible and appealing  ""first experience"" to VR that encourages other people to go out and get there own hardware. (Which was definitely something that happened with the Wii).  The immersion, ""getting lost in unique experiences"" would then come later ;)"

So for those who simply want Win10 AND to use Oculus, my solution works.   IF you somehow think WDDM 2.0/DX12 is the most important reason to have Win10, then my workaround is not for you.   And you still replied to a post saying it doesn't work when it does."
oculus,3duecb,Wiinii,4,Mon Jul 20 00:25:21 2015 UTC,"He's talking about WDDM 2.0, which does provide performance improvements for ""free"", the magnitude of which depends highly of the game though. It does require the new drivers."
oculus,3duecb,SomniumOv,2,Mon Jul 20 00:17:41 2015 UTC,I'd like to know this as well.
oculus,3duecb,i2ichardt,3,Sun Jul 19 18:45:53 2015 UTC,You could just wait a few weeks for others to figure out if win10 is a good OS and works with the DK2.
oculus,3duecb,knexfan0011,15,Sun Jul 19 19:06:49 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure this reddit is those ""others"""
oculus,3duecb,alexargo,3,Sun Jul 19 20:02:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah probably, but as someone who doesn't own a DK2 it does not sound like a good idea to jump onto a new OS release day 1 if you want to keep using your DK2 at the same time."
oculus,3duecb,knexfan0011,4,Sun Jul 19 21:48:53 2015 UTC,When I'm going to install w10 it's going to be a fresh install and since the oculus drivers don't work with a fresh install I have no choice but to wait for new w10 compatible oculus drivers.
oculus,3duecb,Caballer0,3,Sun Jul 19 17:52:38 2015 UTC,i'm running win 10 and it seems very evolutionary with a lot of the infrastructure similar or identical to win 8. i doubt there will be any issues.  most of it seems like a very welcom face lift to get rid of all the annoying touch screen shit out of the way.
oculus,3duecb,GOU_NoMoreMrNiceGuy,2,Mon Jul 20 01:34:07 2015 UTC,I like Win10 far better than Win8.1. Evolutionary yes - but they evolved the right things this time. Virtual desktops and the notification center are both very useful. I imagine Win10 will be a big benefit for Oculus when they get the drivers to be fully native as promised.
oculus,3duecb,superkev72,4,Mon Jul 20 12:41:50 2015 UTC,In time for the 2016 launch? Yes.
oculus,3duecb,BlackTriStar,-3,Sun Jul 19 16:46:09 2015 UTC,"Not sure why people disagree, that's all that really matters at this point. And I have a DK2 myself. I'd rather they spend more time making the CV1 experience better than waste time on old DK2 stuff."
oculus,3duecb,Havelok,18,Sun Jul 19 22:40:53 2015 UTC,Because devs still need their dev kits to work properly?
oculus,3duecb,Pyromaniac605,-8,Mon Jul 20 01:40:04 2015 UTC,It's true but the DK2 is abandonware at this point.
oculus,3duecb,BluntlySays,3,Mon Jul 20 08:48:34 2015 UTC,"Maybe if Oculus wants to seriously limit their potential content available at release, sure."
oculus,3duecb,Pyromaniac605,0,Mon Jul 20 10:32:47 2015 UTC,"Nah, how this would result in more than slight inconveniance of indie devs? It's not like you can't have Win7 for development purposes. I guarantee that even if Win10 support for DK2 will be delayed, it won't result in content that is even slightly different than what it would have been without delay.  It's mostly non-dev users of DK2, which use them to play, concern."
oculus,3duecb,Sinity,3,Mon Jul 20 16:10:51 2015 UTC,"Er, because the DevKit should run on the system which customers will use on launch...?"

oculus,3duecb,systemghost,9,Sun Jul 19 20:58:36 2015 UTC,"Of course they have a reason. It will be the flagship OS when they release.  And developers need to worry about making things work before common folk do. If anything, Win10 should've been the primary focus."
oculus,3duecb,KingPickle,6,Sun Jul 19 19:18:09 2015 UTC,Agreed.  Oculus is going to have a terrible drought of content when they go live.  They don't have the luxury of only supporting specific hardware and software.  They need to be doing everything possible to make sure their devs can continue creating launch content.
oculus,3duecb,Pingly,-3,Sun Jul 19 20:57:28 2015 UTC,They don't have the luxury of only supporting specific hardware and software.   I agree. It's a shame they've put Linux and Mac support on hold. I hope they sort it out before the CV1 release.

oculus,3du4gt,Rheklr,9,Sun Jul 19 17:14:15 2015 UTC,"Ehh well its all just game design. For example your hands could just be in ghost form until your lil cartoon buddy gets a power up that lets you interact with the world directly. Taking our enemies or dealing with environmental obstacles, etc"
oculus,3du4gt,tinnedwaffles,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:40:47 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. Though I'd hesitate before doing a timed power up, because you just know that's going to lead to crazy arm swings and broken things."

From the character design(s), environment design, art direction/stylization to the gameplay mechanics. I've seen so many 'original fox characters' that look just like Lucky on deviantart.

oculus,3du4gt,Beau_Vine,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:38:57 2015 UTC,"The reason most VR apps aren't super innovative right now is because there are a TON of questions to answer from a design and development perspective with the tech and new medium itself. Once teams have some VR experience and the medium has matured past being brand new, innovation in the apps will follow. It would just be too much to ship a title in a new medium, with new tech, AND new game design."
oculus,3du4gt,OGChamploo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:40:03 2015 UTC,"I think you're underestimating just what level of competency and luck it takes to create an original idea within a new medium. The idea not only has to be original, but also fun and compelling.   If a creator makes a solid game experience, based on previous experience of what he knows will work, it won't be original. If he makes an original experience, it will likely be no fun to play. How to balance those two factors is what every dev is doing right now. It's no easy task and this is why it's much easier to fall on the side of compelling, rather than original. No one...no one wants to play a game that sucks but is original. But they will play a game that's slightly original and compelling."

Or is he rescuing the white rectangles from the suffering of being a bigger, gray rectangle?  All in all, yeah - basic bitch material. But it's a proof of concept, that 3D platformers work well in VR. Don't mess with it unless you get the basics."
oculus,3du4gt,kmanmx,3,Sun Jul 19 19:57:45 2015 UTC,"""you feel like you're there with the character, behind him, guiding him and helping him navigate the environment"" this is fundamentally a different sort of relationship to the character than you might normally have???  it looks just like every other console platform game, and it doesnt seem to use VR in a new way, or in an immersive way at all. Why are they bringing it to oculus? Am I wrong here?"
oculus,3du4gt,dboxvr,9,Sun Jul 19 19:58:27 2015 UTC,"I was extremely skeptical about 3rd person VR too- and then I tried some great 3rd person demos.  It makes you feel like you're in that world and guiding the character, just as he said. And it makes you feel like that character is real.  For example, it's easy for many people to shoot a civilian in GTA on a monitor. But in VR, devs have found that people have a reluctance to do this sort of thing.  Why is that? Because VR, by its very immersion and realism, inspires the brain to consider the characters as real entities, which we will naturally feel empathy for.  By feeling a greater empathy for your character, you greater connect with them and can do storytelling and adventures in a way you just couldn't before."

oculus,3du4gt,Jupsto,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:40:05 2015 UTC,We just know that there are lots in development- not any specifics yet.
oculus,3du4gt,eobet,0,Mon Jul 20 09:01:04 2015 UTC,"for what i'm seeing, there are 20 platform/standard monitor games and 0 VR games..."
oculus,3dw78q,Dreadp1r4te,7,Mon Jul 20 01:18:33 2015 UTC,"HL2+episodes and Time Rifters come to mind. Both are highly configurable - Time Rifters via in game menu, HL2 via .ini tweak, IIRC."
oculus,3dw78q,BuckleBean,4,Mon Jul 20 02:01:19 2015 UTC,"AI was supposed to have been designed with the Rift in mind   Yeah it wasnt really, the engine just has basic VR support by default."
oculus,3dw78q,WormSlayer,2,Mon Jul 20 02:10:08 2015 UTC,Ah. Well I just thought it odd that the up-down look is via head movement (independent of hands) and left-right is whole body.
oculus,3dw78q,WormSlayer,5,Mon Jul 20 02:23:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah I also prefer having the head and body decoupled. Any FPS game with actual VR support should have it as an option, for those crazy inverted mouse types that actually like having the head and body locked like they are wearing a halo brace :P"
oculus,3dw78q,ralgha,4,Mon Jul 20 02:33:26 2015 UTC,Minecrift has an option so you can have it either way.  Actually it has a lot of options like that.
oculus,3dw78q,senorotis,3,Mon Jul 20 04:52:07 2015 UTC,Project cars.
oculus,3dw78q,GregLittlefield,3,Mon Jul 20 04:24:28 2015 UTC,"I belive Oculus's own best practice guidelines advise against this system, because honestly, it usually sucks."
oculus,3dw78q,BOLL7708,6,Mon Jul 20 05:03:29 2015 UTC,"I'll admit it can be confusing at first, but anyone who's played ARMA or similar games can attest to it being useful in the long run to learn it. I imagine it would be a lot easier to adjust in VR than a normal monitor."
oculus,3dw78q,IWillNotBeBroken,5,Mon Jul 20 05:49:05 2015 UTC,"honestly, it usually sucks.   How so? I find that to be much more realistic. IRL when I turn my head I don't always rotate my body at the exact same rate. Whether in 1st or 3rd person many games feature a certain threshold where you can rotate your head freely before your chest, and eventually the rest of you body, follow suits.  This is just like tank games or similar vehicles: you can rotate your turret just not the whole vehicle. This is both useful as a gameplay device, and plain more realistic. Eye directions and body movement are two separate things."
oculus,3dw78q,peterallen900,4,Mon Jul 20 09:48:57 2015 UTC,"From my own experience, when decoupling my aim and standing up I would often lose track of what is forward for my body, as then there is just head tracking and nothing for the rest of my body. Then when I push a stick to walk it is not in the expected direction and I have to adjust."
oculus,3dw78q,IWillNotBeBroken,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:59:00 2015 UTC,"Just paying attention to my body right now, the HMD limited field of view might make this worse.  Especially when you're not looking forward, you can often see your own shoulders in the periphery of your vision.  Hand-tracking could help, although you'd be slightly zombie-like, using your outstretched arm to keep track of body direction.  I wonder what it would take to develop a virtual sense of proprioception.  With a full body-tracking system, your own sense of proprioception should work for you, but how well would it work as you take away the tracking of limbs?  How little needs to be tracked in order to not confuse you?  That would also limit what you can do to the user: do a summersault in-game without making the user do the movement.  I also wonder if flying in-and-out of your in-game body (first- to third-person perspectives) could help with that.  When applying forces to the in-game character, fly out to a third-person perspective so the player sees what's happening (and understands why they aren't feeling it), then fly back in as the force stops."
oculus,3dw78q,senorotis,2,Mon Jul 20 16:26:08 2015 UTC,"A HUD marker could easily fix this though, or have a key mapped to centre headlook, or just glance down at your feet."
oculus,3dw78q,GregLittlefield,0,Mon Jul 20 11:12:57 2015 UTC,Since when did you have feet in games?! /s
oculus,3dw78q,Pingly,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:08:00 2015 UTC,"Unless your body is strapped to a straight back chair or something, your sense of proprioception is not going to match up with your avatar's actual body position, which leads to annoying drift for what seems like the majority of players. It's easier (again, for most people) to just adjust the movement direction appropriately when looking around, because it's an almost automatic reflex for most gamers."
oculus,3dw78q,senorotis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:49:26 2015 UTC,"I guess there's a subjective part at work here because I totally feel the other way. I guess it also depends on the way you play and the kind of game you play. For instance I usually like to play slow paced games and I like to take my time and look around. If I am looking around my avatar is usually standing, with just the head rotating. And if my whole avatar's body rotates at the same time as my head it really feels unnatural; like my neck is stiff."
oculus,3dw78q,Qbopper,3,Tue Jul 21 09:51:07 2015 UTC,There's nothing worse than when you're running and can't look behind you without swinging wildly around.  I don't play games without decoupled headtracking.
oculus,3dw78q,tinspin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:27:21 2015 UTC,"I don't know, it seems like it would be second nature to most of us to adjust our movement direction with they keyboard or thumbstick automatically. I am constantly adjusting my thumbstick direction relative to my head without even being aware of it when I'm playing a game.    I don't play games without decoupled head tracking.   You must play very few games."
oculus,3dw78q,tinspin,2,Tue Jul 21 02:46:39 2015 UTC,"I can't disagree more - having FPS games tie movement to where I look is disorienting and frustrating for me, and makes it very difficult to enjoy games with the Rift  It's the same idea as ""VR comfort mode"" - i have a good VR stomach but comfort made is a one way trip to vomit city for me"

Charlie is one of my childhood heroes and it was an honor to meet him. He took my card and wants to see the finished version once its ready. I could not have met a nicer guy. His wife also sat through the experience but I missed that as she came to the exhibition in the morning.

oculus,3du6i0,DrashVR,6,Mon Jul 20 03:17:21 2015 UTC,"Thank you for posting this. It is amazing to me how VR will provide experiences to people that they never would otherwise be able to have. It is something I have not considered, but the appeal of these experiences is perhaps more valuable to those that have had them before and are looking to have them again. Thank you for your work on the Apollo 11 Experience and I very much look forward to enjoying it when I get my headset."
oculus,3du6i0,WormSlayer,4,Sun Jul 19 15:36:35 2015 UTC,"I just got a glimpse of the future, where there will be a lot of news articles about celebrities reviving certain moments that made them famous - in VR, or bad things like ""Old soldier relives the WW2 in X experience"" or ""victim of X crime goes through a computer simulation to relive the experience and try to give clues to the police"".

oculus,3du6i0,OziOziOiOi,4,Mon Jul 20 01:03:35 2015 UTC,Yes he did. Some will be seen in the video when I get to release it later this week. I did have a good conversation off camera with him later that night and got some great feedback. He said the moon surface and lander look exactly as he remembers it and the new CM cockpit is perfect with all its switch and dials. Some small technical issues with the readouts not displaying the exact right data  but that's to be expected as we have a 20+ min launch condensed into 4 mins. I also got to hear about other small details about the elevator ride to the top of the launch viechele that would not be widely known by the public that we will implement in a future update.

oculus,3dw8dt,AWetAndFloppyNoodle,3,Mon Jul 20 14:49:40 2015 UTC,"I had this exact same issue and it drove me insane. Yesterday I finally decided I'd try to tackle the issue. It seems like something is ticking every 1 second and causes the games to skip slightly. I was able to fix it by going to task manager and kill every process that wasn't needed. I have similar spec as you, and even recently had to replace my 2500k with a 4670k (both of which had the exact same problem) so I know my specs wasn't the cause. Also, CPU utilization was not high to begin with (in the 10s), so it seems that a process which was running was causing it. I didn't remember which processes I got rid of but they was not system ones. Namely chrome, some VMware ones, f.lux and a few other third party. I'm thinking it was something from chrome."
oculus,3dw8dt,EddieWattz,2,Mon Jul 20 08:27:52 2015 UTC,I was getting something similar after updating to 0.6.0. It would jump every second or so. I was using a display port to hdmi adapter for the rift. After directly connecting the hdmi to the card it works smooth again.
oculus,3dw8dt,villain749,2,Mon Jul 20 05:00:30 2015 UTC,"Plugging in the ""optional"" power supply to the sync box fixed this for me.  Issue was that everytime usbport.sys took too long to resolve, the DK2s IR lights turned off, then on again miliseconds later, causing jumping. With the power cable in, the lights are always on."
oculus,3dw8dt,razioer,2,Mon Jul 20 07:51:34 2015 UTC,I used to have this exact problem when F.lux was running in the background. Not after the latest runtime though.
oculus,3dw8dt,OldSoulCyborg,2,Mon Jul 20 08:04:50 2015 UTC,"Just to agree with others, I had a similar problem on different occasions. Sometimes it was caused by the power supply not being completely connected to the rift camera (loose plug). Sometimes it was caused by a conflict with logitech software processes running in the background."

Two things that have caused trouble for me, though, have been the presence of my Logitech camera, and the program ""fLux"".  I think, though, that both of those issues have been addressed in newer firmware/dev kit upgrades from Oculus, though.  One other item to check is to disable VSync.  I have had the case where with VSync enabled for some games, that it would judder about once per second, even without the Rift.  I doubt anything I have said here is helpful, but that's what I know.  Good luck!"

oculus,3dwrof,Dracrius,7,Mon Jul 20 04:27:37 2015 UTC,"Hi Dracrius  If you have no interest in creating the environment yourself, because you don't have the time or because you're just not interested in making things, I might be able to create it for you.  Last year, I made this simple environment for a custom Unity app, which was used to play a Street Fighter 3 ROM from an external video source: http://imgur.com/XVU4y9U  Because of that previous experience, I believe I'm capable of creating your custom arcade environment.  I can't afford to do this for free, but at this point in time, my rate is very open ended and I'll consider any offer made. I am willing to spend up to 4 hours on this project.  If you are interested, I'll need some screen shots of an arcade environment that I can use a reference. I will even create a custom marquee for your cabinet so it'll feel more personalized. I'll need your player height so that I can align the eye cameras to the proper distance from the floor. I'll deliver to you the *.vde file which you can just double click to import into Virtual Desktop.  Send me a PM if you're willing to move forward with this. If you PM me very soon, I can guarantee delivery by the end of the week.  If anyone else is interested in having me create custom VR environments or apps, you may also send me a PM."

I'd love to do this myself but just have zero experience! But the image in my head is so perfect I want to make it a reality. I wonder how many other people would use it too.
oculus,3dwrof,ggodin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:32:24 2015 UTC,"You can use an existing model as worm pointed out. You'll probably need to tweak it though using Blender or your favorite modeling program. The head position needs to be at 0,0,0 and if you use a fixed screen the mesh must be named ""Screen"". You also have to bake lighting. Once thats done, simply export your model to a .FBX or .OBJ file and select the file in the Environment Editor."
oculus,3dwrof,ggodin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:48:27 2015 UTC,"Ok in some ways that sounds simple enough but I have no knowledge of how to use any modeling programs bake lighting I'm sure I can find a tutorial for but the head position at 0,0,0 can anyone give me some pointers on how I'd change the head position in blender? I'll start searching myself in the mean time. Lastly will the Screen mesh need to match the aspect ratio of my screen or if say I made it the entire cabinet screen (usually a 4:3 screen) would VD automatically center my 16:9 monitor in the middle of it leaving me the option to switch to a 4:3 resolution and fill the cabinet screen if I felt like it for say MAME?"
oculus,3dwrof,WormSlayer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:07:34 2015 UTC,"It just means your head when you wear the headset will be at 0,0,0 so place the cabinet so that its at the proper distance from the user's head.  In the Environment Editor, you can specify the aspect ratio of the screen mesh. If its 4:3 then use 1.333"

I had a hard time changing the shape of the movie screen so it fit with the position of the panorama viewscreen. Still, its a lot of fun and rewarding to experiment so why not have a go at making your own environment?"
oculus,3dwrof,rufus83,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:10:28 2015 UTC,I remember reading somewhere you just had to name part of your model something specific for VD's Environment Editor to use it as the screen. Is that the case because I doubt that the method you used to place the screen wouldnt work well for a small up close cabinet screen. Also what did you use to make your model? Blender?
oculus,3dxvex,memory_overflow,4,Mon Jul 20 12:52:42 2015 UTC,"Must be new to the be scene. I think that's the first thing everyone wants haha. Currently that's very much  impossible due to how the rift fundamentally interacts with your computer.   Multiple computers over a network can play together in worlds like JanusVR, VRChat, and AltSpace. If you want to watch movies with someone I recommend RiftMax, a multiplayer VR cinema that lets you stream movies in sync with each other in very detailed environments. That  includes 3D videos. It's a bit tricky but you can stream YouTube and twitch as well. Local content requires some setup for multiplayer but is super easy if you want to watch it yourself.   Nice rig btw, won't have any trouble with the rift.   http://youtu.be/cji_8fX4JOE"

oculus,3dxvex,ghostkid2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:14:11 2015 UTC,"Just curious, can you run two 3D games on one PC on two different monitors now? Can current GPU & OS do that at all?"
oculus,3dxvex,thatdude90210,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:51:33 2015 UTC,that has been possible for a long time but the rift requires constellation tracking.
oculus,3dxvex,RGBhax,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:51:40 2015 UTC,"Multi-seat gaming off of a single machine is possible if certain highly specific criteria are met.  You need to be running KVM Hypervisor as your OS. You need an Intel motherboard chipset and CPU (both the 5820k and the 5930k meet this requirement) that support VT-d (Virtualization for directed I/O) and the board partner that manufactured the motherboard has to have properly implemented the support for it in their firmware (this is the finicky one...ASRock is the only company that consistently gets it right... some ASUS boards will work, most Gigabyte and MSI boards will not).  An AMD CPU and motherboard chipset with AMD-Vi or IOMMU will also work and its not nearly as difficult as finding a suitable Intel mobo. You need to setup two separate Windows Virtual Machines. You must pass the two GPUs through to their respective VMs for direct PCI-E access. You will need a separate display adapter for the Hypervisor but it doesn't need to be anything fancy.  It is a huge hassle to setup GPU-passthrough, but it is possible. The best resource on the topic is a thread over on the Archlinux forums about KVM.  If setup correctly, each Windows VM has a dedicated graphics card, while they share CPU and RAM resources. A hyperthreaded hexacore or octacore i7 with 32GB of RAM would be ideal for this. If you can get the GPUs to passthrough successfully you now have two computers running simultaneously on one set of hardware at which point you can configure multiplayer the same as if you had two physically separate machines."
oculus,3dxvex,SingularityParadigm,2,Tue Jul 21 06:20:23 2015 UTC,"I think right now the CPU is the bottleneck with DL11 they can barely keep up with the GPU's. If DX12 is all it's cracked up to be perhaps it might be feasible since allot more of the load will be moved to the GPU.  It may also be interesting if they could segregate specific GPU's to a spasic HMD. Perhaps a 4 way SLI with one GPU for each of the 4 eye's of the two HMD's? Sounds good in my mind, though I have no idea if that would be the least bit feasible.  Then if/when foveated rendering becomes a thing and it does increase performance n times over(I have heard everything from a x60 to x1000 performance increases) then I dont see why we couldnt have 5 HMD's running on a PC like yours.

What you're seeing here is just a mirror of what is actually sent to the headset display.  The scene is rendered with a field of view and projection that is pretty awkward to view in a rectangular window without clipping the frame, so there's no lossless way to represent what the person in the headset is seeing.  Apps can do better for the mirrored display with minimal performance impact, but it's work, and every approach will have trade-offs. It's understandable that not all experiences optimize for it."

oculus,3du2p1,Larry_Mudd,12,Sun Jul 19 14:08:40 2015 UTC,"It makes more sense when you consider that use of a trademarked word is only a violation if can reasonably be shown to cause confusion amongst consumers.  ie; ""Trojan"" is trademarked by the condom folks, but it's totally kosher to sell automotive batteries branded with that name, because consumers aren't likely to assume a connection.  But if you set up a web store and started selling silicon sex toys with ""Trojan"" splashed all over them, you might be challenged on that - and yet it may still be okay, if you can show that your branding and marketing is sufficiently distinct from the more recognizable company to avoid consumer confusion. If you wanted to sell prophylactics branded ""Trojan,"" you could count on being shut down pretty quickly.   So while a company can trademark a common word, it doesn't really mean it's ""theirs,"" and they can't really complain unless their brand recognition is being diluted, or someone is trading on their established name."

Problem: Every swing goes through objects, how to make a fun and balanced multiplayer sword fighting game?  Solution: Narrative!   All players have a ""Personal Laser Refracting Energy Shield Barrier"". Each time a laser sword swing touches or goes through your body, your ""Shield  Points"" deplete. More damage is done in critical areas like head and chest. Upon depletion of ""Shield Points"", the next swing that makes contact will kill you. No need for sword locking. Each swing goes through everything so dodging is a must. Blocking is implemented by circular ""Anti Laser Shields"" worn in your offhand. If your opponents sword passes through your shield, his laser is disabled for a duration. Actual gameplay is fought by dancing around opponents trying to tag them with your saber while dodging or blocking theirs. Successfully tagging their saber with your offhand shield disables their saber for a duration (1 sec? 3 secs?) allowing you to counter attack."

I will say it may be a good fit for the Vive's large tracking area. I could even see someone creating somthing like this but for a soccer ball for penalty kicks or somthing (Im not really a sports guy)

oculus,3dv8pl,LukeLC,6,Sun Jul 19 20:20:07 2015 UTC,"Rendering for a HMD is a little different from what we've been used to. You really, really dont want to reduce the framerate or resolution. Instead you will probably be changing the render target resolution to manage FPS. It should be very effective once render layers are working."
oculus,3dv8pl,WormSlayer,3,Sun Jul 19 20:48:14 2015 UTC,An overclocked GTX 960 will be fine for most Rift experiences- but you'll have to be aware that there will be higher end experiences which you won't be able to play.
oculus,3dv8pl,Heaney555,4,Sun Jul 19 20:47:15 2015 UTC,"The render buffer is indepent of the post warp display buffer. In lectures a few times Abrash recomends engines implement dynamic render buffer rendering where a different render buffer size is used for each frame depending on load, you can apparently halve the render buffer size for a couple of frames without people noticing too much. Even high end rigs may need to do this from time to time as the lenses concentrate pixels in the center with picussion distortion while wide angle rectilinear sampling of the GPU concentrates pixels in the corners, to get full detail in the center after the barrel distortion correction is applied requires a render buffer 1.4x in both directions so a 2160x1200 display requires a 3024x1680 render 2.6 megapixels becomes 5.1 Which is why foveated rendering is being researched for use even without eye tracking with Nvidias MultiRes and multiview rendering in OpenGL Here someone is experimenting with foveated layers in tuscany"

Which is not to say that it's okay at 30fps. But now you have to have that 75/90 as a minimum refresh, to avoid stuttering, so either enormous power or poor detail (often both). I trust in a greater efficiency tomorrow."

So basically what I'm getting so far is at first I'd be limited in what I could do, but over time things would get better?  Plus I just did some research and I could easily add a second GTX 960 without upgrading my PSU, and that would get me even better performance than the recommended GTX 970 minimum spec requirement. And 960s are so cheap that would be very manageable. Assuming Oculus plays nice with SLI, that is."

I almost got 970 month ago but then I cooled down and decided to wait.

For a subscription service you're more likely to see Netflix distribute 360° films than you are see a premium Cinematic VR streaming service succeed to the point that it's profitable for cinematic VR producers. It's still too early days for premium VR films to think about direct monetisation. Oculus Story Studio (and equivalents) make a lot more sense at this stage - where producing premium content is worth the price to have great content available to incentivise adoption of VR. No one is thinking about direct monetisation of VR content at the moment - that's why there are so many VC deals going on.  But - that's not to say it's not possible. The people who WILL pay for high quality cinematic VR content are enthusiasts with a Rift and a PC, and most importantly, a Steam account. Zero Point released through Steam and if you're producing premium cinematic VR content then that would be your best bet for direct monetisation at the moment.  The other platform I'd include on here that wasn't mentioned is the Google Spotlight Stories app. That's probably actually the closest to a 'Premium Cinematic VR platform' out there at the moment.

It seems the only way forward is to have an ""app wrapper""encompass the actual video.  I was looking more at a Youtube 360 like platform for distribution, or a site like Vrideo that offers WebGL preview (but does not have a paid download option yet)   For a subscription service you're more likely to see Netflix distribute 360° films.   Yes, exactly the kind of platform that should be activated. Oculus store too should have had this on by now. The 360Video 'app' on the GearVR has like 4 videos, and no way for producers to submit any (vetted or otherwise).  edit  Re: google spotlight. Admittedly, I hadn't heard of it. A quick search later shows that indeed it supports spherical video. Does it do Stereoscopic 360?   That is of importance when we talk of 'presence'.

Imagine a 120"" screen 3 meters (a human is approx 2 meters tall) from you. It'd take up a huge portion of your view, but also be 3D, and the 3D would be made for this format, meaning the movie maker knows exactly where the viewer is and can make super-realistic 3D.  If someone gets close to the screen, they'll actually be 1:1 scale wise. That's what I want.  Today, that's not how it works.

Imaging a book - with one paragraph per page, where you have to reach out and turn to get to the next step in the plot/story.  That's what it's like if you confuse the luxury of ""positionally tracked"" VR with Cinematic VR storytelling. It's just too involved.  Gaming and short demos are cool where you want to look around.

oculus,3dvcte,Agronopolopogis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:18:24 2015 UTC,Realisticly the only way I expect them to achieve positional tracking on the gearVR is to use the Oculus camera that comes with the rift. I could be wrong though. I suggest you wait for them to announce the note 5 unless you really need a phone now. You could also get a seperate contract and use it with a cheap phone until the note 5 is released.
oculus,3dvcte,DiaFusion,2,Mon Jul 20 01:18:08 2015 UTC,"but for that the camera would have to be plugged into the phone and headset, Gear is meant to be the wire free VR system, so I think when it happens it will have to be with inside out tracking. I think they won't bother until its perfect."
oculus,3dvcte,TD-4242,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:56:32 2015 UTC,They might be able to sync the camera to the phone wirelessly. NFC could be used for initiation and then maybe bluetooth? Not sure what can provide both the low latency and high bandwidth required.

oculus,3dvcte,TD-4242,2,Mon Jul 20 03:28:13 2015 UTC,You wont want either. The files for the VR programs are large and neither has removable memory.    Samsung really fucked themselves over there because I liked having a memory card for my 3d high def movies in the VR theater and since I cant do that with the paltry on board memory I will definitely not be getting the note 5.    Get the newest nexus or the g4 and look for a decent head mount display. the only thing added by the Gear VR is the touch pad and back button.      Also lacking a removable battery while not as big of a deal really turned me off. 8 hour flight watching movies in the vr theatre is pretty taxing on the battery. being able to swap it was nice.   I currently own a note 4 and gear vr this is just my personal experience.
oculus,3dvcte,remosito,4,Mon Jul 20 01:27:05 2015 UTC,"The Gear VR has the added oculus movment sensor which is the prime reason for buttery smooth movement, a diff phone plus Google cardboard is not an answer at all. and rumors are that the note 5 will have a massive battery."
oculus,3du7zr,SlightlyCyborg,12,Sun Jul 19 14:56:27 2015 UTC,"No it doesnt.

oculus,3du7zr,Mekrob,3,Sun Jul 19 15:06:37 2015 UTC,"The DK2's resolution is 1920×1080 (960 x 1080 per eye), and from my perspective I'd need at least double that resolution to properly use it as a monitor replacement. That's around 4000x2000 (that's double the resolution in both directions, so 4x the resolution actually). So, yeah, 4K sounds definitely right to me."
oculus,3du7zr,GregLittlefield,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:51:21 2015 UTC,"In the meantime something of a Quad HD screen (2,560x1,440 pixels) would be an improvement (around 30%), but still far from perfect.   Samsung's Galaxy Note 4 has a Quad HD Super AMOLED display, but the Note 5 is around the corner (rumoured announcement time in september) and it might just have a higher resolution screen. I highly doubt we'll be able to simply mod it into CV1 though. But that only means good things for CV2 (whenever it'll be available)."
oculus,3du7zr,GregLittlefield,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:18:57 2015 UTC,I also think getting rid of or at least minimizing the screen door effect will also help.  You can then use some of the subpixel font rendering techniques that made fonts much prettier on lower res 800x600 monitors back in the day.
oculus,3du7zr,TD-4242,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:42:19 2015 UTC,"I feel like the benefits of subpixel rendering don't really come into play until you're working with high resolution displays. At 800x600, you end up with a blurry mess. But on a 1080p panel things start to blend together right. It's similar to antialiasing like that, you need a certain amount of display definition in order to take advantage of it as a benefit rather than a blur filter."
oculus,3du7zr,bartycrank,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:05:52 2015 UTC,"You are right, i had that backwards.  Now I really don't remember how I was able to see text on 800x600 screens.

oculus,3du7zr,justinmchase,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:39:16 2015 UTC,"The resolution of the DK2 is not quite there, but I feel like it's really close. Carmack's remarks about it not being good enough until we have 4K panels may be accurate, but I think there's a good chance that the CV1 and Vive will be adequate to comfortably use for general computing.  The DK2 for text editing can be really cool despite the low resolution. I'm thinking of a certain class of editor, the ones that try to present nothing more than the full screen page of text, geared toward creative writing and isolation from disturbance while writing. These HMDs have the potential to engage serious focus for people who have difficulty prying themselves away from the distractions. Just not quite high enough resolution to deep dive into heavy code yet."
oculus,3dtk6f,importon,23,Sun Jul 19 09:05:36 2015 UTC,"How can we explore huge worlds if we can't leave the studio apt sized space or get out of the cockpit?   I think design will play a large role in this. For example, in a cockpit you can have millions of light years of space all around you. In a mech you can have an entire world.  But clever use of mechanics can potentially make a 15x15 space seem much bigger than that even without being confined like that. For example, consider what can be done with teleporters and elevators. Imagine being on teh bridge of your ship. It's a 15x15 space, with a glass window to millions of light years of space outside. You walk over to the elevator and go down one level. This is your personal quarters with a desk, chair and a bed. Go back to the elevator go down one level, this is your ship's cargo hold. Back to the elevator, go down a level and here's your hangar bay with a fighter craft you can get into to fly around that millions of light years of space you saw from the bridge. See another ship or a space station, dock on it and yet another 15x15 space. Leave and land on a planet, walk around a bit  A lot can be done with 15x15 to make it seem much larger.  Also, your bedroom won't be the only place you can use VR. Look at the Vvoid. Look at Dave and Busters. A facility you go to with a VR experience, much like real life laser tag or miniature gold, won't be constrained to the size of your room. VR themeparks are already starting to pop up and this will probably continue.  Some experiences might not work very well. If you want to be able to walk for 100 miles in s straight line exploring a single world, that might be difficult. But by developers simply favoring experiences that it works well for, we can probably see good results.  Also, having difficulty finding a link, but I saw a video at one point where people were experimenting with subtle shifts in direction to trick you into thinking you're in a bigger space than you realize. Know how it's difficult to walk in a straight line with your eyes closed, and how you tend to end up walking in circles without realizing it? That phenomenon can be exploited. Again, can't find the video, bit if I remember it correctly they were saying that roughly 40x40 feet combined with the right visual cues from the goggle was enough to convince people that they were walking in a straight line forever. Maybe more than you're likely to have at home with Vive, but completely realistic for a VR themepark."
oculus,3dtk6f,ponieslovekittens,6,Sun Jul 19 11:39:51 2015 UTC,the problem with the D&B and Void experiences is they will target short term high action high wow factor 15 minute to maybe an hour at most experiences.  While they will be great fun and likely well worth their $X.XX price tag they will lack depth that a lot of people will want to get out of VR experiences.
oculus,3dtk6f,TD-4242,2,Sun Jul 19 15:22:05 2015 UTC,"They're just a start; these are the very first commercially deployed VR arcades (in this wave of VR). I'm sure they're using what they've learned in this process to design/imagine all sorts of new experiences that capitalize on the potential of the current tech as much as possible. VR in its current state is really good for the shorter ""wow factor"" experiences right now, and we can't fault them for starting there. Things will only get crazier/longer/deeper from here."
oculus,3dtk6f,squakmix,2,Sun Jul 19 19:42:03 2015 UTC,the problem is that the venue of going somewhere to use VR is designed in a way to move people through the experiences quickly.  So it wont really be a place to develop deep game play.  Similar to how stand up arcades are compared to take home gaming.  Where it will hopefully help a lot is inspiration.  the short clips should help others to see a possibility they hadn't seen before.
oculus,3dtk6f,TD-4242,2,Sun Jul 19 19:50:19 2015 UTC,"I see potential for certain kinds of multiplayer experiences that you just can't have any other way, like warehouse scale VR ""laser tag"". I'm sure some people would spend countless hours in there, albeit probably in small chunks at a time (probably 10-20 minute sessions).    You're absolutely right that the economics of arcades/attractions like this tend to mean individuals (or groups) only get small chunks of time with the equipment but that doesn't mean people won't/can't dive deep with the experiences and become experts at using it. Think about arcade junkies that spend thousands of hours honing their muscle memory with traditional arcade games. There will probably be people who take VR arcades to that extreme too (once the software matures to the point of requiring those skills)."
oculus,3dtk6f,squakmix,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:31:55 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to detract from the hope that there will be really awesome all day theme parks where you git issued your goggles at the entrance then spend a day wandering around a ware house, while feeling like you are wandering around universal studios.

For example, this video shows a guy walking in a curvewhile thinking he's walking in a straight line.  Still haven't been able to find the video I mentioned above, but again, if I remember the number correctly they were saying that 40x40 feet was enough space to convincingly get you walking in circles and thinking you were walking in a straight line forever.  Much bigger than Vive's 15x15. And possibly larger than is reasonable to expect from home users. But easily within the realm of reasonable for a VR themepark."

oculus,3dtk6f,keepsake,25,Mon Jul 20 03:58:11 2015 UTC,"The major flaw in your post is that you've assumed that room scale VR is the only type of VR.  The majority of developers making large-scale environments in VR games are using thumb sticks for locomotion.  The first third party AAA VR title uses thumbstick, for example!  The key is to keep movement slow (non-VR games have you moving far too fast for a normal human anyways) and stick to 90 FPS. You'd be surprised how few people get sick in this scenario.  And there's an even better way that increases immersion and makes none of the users I've tested sick at all (even first time): a spinning chair (or standing and manually rotating)! If you control pitch with your head and yaw by spinning in the chair or rotating your body, you use the thumbstick simply to walk forwards and backwards or strafe.  Room scale will be a niche. The vast majority of games will be thumbstick.  That's how you'll move around these huge virtual worlds. As you always have done, except without pitch control (and sometimes, if you have a spinning chair or stand, without yaw control)."
oculus,3dtk6f,Heaney555,10,Sun Jul 19 12:36:10 2015 UTC,"Even moving forwards (or esp. strafing etc.) can make some people sick, but rotation definitely seems to be the biggest problem for most. If people could genuinely turn in place and artificially move forwards with a thumb stick or button, I'd think most people could manage first-person experiences provided that they didn't involve frantically running around. After a bit of practice at least.   A large tracking area would still make things easier for adventure games and such -- e.g. artificially move your character to an appropriate location and then move about in real life examining things nearby (as opposed to artificially sliding around the walls tapping the +Use key). Or in a FPS, move to a good position and then stay there for a while, popping in and out of cover. Those stops would also give your stomach a moment to recover before moving on."
oculus,3dtk6f,SvenViking,6,Sun Jul 19 12:59:44 2015 UTC,"""turn in place and artificially move forwards with a thumb stick""  I agree, I think it's the key. Try to play FPS games without touching the right stick and everything seems natural, no sickness."
oculus,3dtk6f,mikendrix,3,Sun Jul 19 13:25:24 2015 UTC,"I disagree with this actually. There were several first person experiences I tried on the GearVR w/ a controller where the game was set up so you move in the direction that your head is facing. This threw me off because I kept naturally wanting to be able to look behind me and to the sides while I was running forward, however it just kept turning me with my head. It felt awkward and unnatural."
oculus,3dtk6f,theworldisagoodplace,2,Sun Jul 19 22:17:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we need waist-tracking :/."

oculus,3dtk6f,evolvedant,-8,Mon Jul 20 02:52:50 2015 UTC,"Even moving forwards (or esp. strafing etc.) can make some people sick   If it does, then that'll apply to whatever vehicle you're using in room scale to travel around too then. So you don't get away from the problem, you just move it.   A large tracking area would still make things easier for adventure games and such   Doesn't matter, because the majority of devs aren't developing for it and the vast majority of consumers don't want it.

oculus,3dtk6f,redmercuryvendor,3,Sun Jul 19 13:50:13 2015 UTC,"The general argument goes that given a frame of reference that matches your perception of motion (seeing the cockpit) fewer people get sick.  A reverse example: fewer people get carsick if they look out the window.  They still see the car not moving the way they feel, but they also see a frame of reference that does match.  People have different degrees of sensitivity, and have to be varying degrees of careful in having a large enough portion of their view matching and/or spending a longer portion of time.  Some folks cannot do it at all without motion sickness medication.  I have no personal experience with motion/simulator sickness/discomfort myself (very happy about that), but this is what I see others saying)."

I wonder if VR sickness can be overcome eventually by just getting acclimated to it over time?"
oculus,3dtk6f,Baogwa,2,Mon Jul 20 01:14:05 2015 UTC,"This.  This is how it will work, you physically turn with your body, and move forward with the thumbstick. It's turning with the stick that is generally responsible for causing motion sickness. Most experiences will be like this. You have the ability to walk around a 15X15 space or whatever the Rift will be, but to go long distance the thumb stick will be fine with devs integrating this rule into their games."

I think the enthusiast community wants what it wants and doesn't care what will appeal to the masses. That's fine, but if VR is going to be massively successful and not the next wii it has to appeal to the non-enthusiast and convert the unconverted. A dedicated room where you have to move all your shit out of the way and hope you don't fall down ever is just not going to fly for most people. That being the case, why would anyone develop for that as their target with such a small potential audience? Sure, some devs totally will, but the majority won't.

I think the Vive is an excellent headset that has exceeded all expectations of HTC, and I'm sure they'll ship it with no major supply issues by the end of 2015.

However, keep in mind that after the invention of the first person shooter, it tooks years of people turning with keyboards before mouselook was invented. When a wholly new paradigm comes along, solutions that seem obvious in hindsight are not always obvious.  The biggest problem for VR sickness is yaw. Simple having people standing and physically rotating to turn will solve a lot of that. There will be numerous schemes tried/used for allowing locomotion: walking in place, backing the camera out to a cinema perspective will locomotion, teleportation schemes, FOV constraint/blurring techniques, so on and so forth. It won't take a decade for us to have open world games that are comfortable at least to those capable of some VR acclimation.    i feel like this is pretty much everything you can do without a locomotion solution   Fortunately you're super wrong about this at least. Games currently have horrible, unintuitive, stilty, unnatural interaction paradigms.  Have two ultra precise, 6DOF controllers will allow far more than just ""picking stuff up and throwing it"". If you've ever tried, say, shooting a gun with a Hydra, it's a completely game changer.  There's a huge amount of territory to explore just in having a vastly improved human machine interface. Puzzle games and sandbox games are some of the most popular genres on Earth and the'll be utterly transformed. Reaching your hands into games and interacting naturally with things is going to be years worth of fertile design space that is going to yield new genres and killer apps."

Solutions as others have given.   Floating Platform that you can control in game to fly it around. You are bound to this platform because insert reason (Breathable air?) The platform can go anywhere and you can go anywhere on the platform therefor you can go anywhere!   This applies to all other  variations with different vehicles, settings and reasons for the limited walking exploration.   Use tricks to expand the gaming space.   Vertical gameplay. The game revolves around moving from floor to floor via an elevator. You explore an area and step into an elevator and you move up a floor and to a new area creating a sense of vertical open worldliness!  I don't understand why treadmills are fail though as they seem to have the better solution. It might not be as immersive and bring as much presence as true walking VR but it makes up for it by requiring less space and can let people explore a fully open world on foot without worrying about running into walls!  Honestly I cannot see a real solution to open world exploring beyond the 15x15 ft space because you are really moving around in the real world. Ergh it is hard to think!"

(So are gamepads for that matter - I'd rather remain tied to my desk, with no less unnatural keyboard-and-mouse, than forced to use those abominations :P)  Short term I expect we may see one or two developers settling for regular forced locomotion (button/stick/touchpad/pointing) to traverse longer distances, coupled, once we get foot tracking, with walking in place (like stompz, but with more direct and fine-grained integration). Some will design around layout/transportation machinery restrictions, that allows the room to be ""expanded"" somewhat through a limited degree of redirected walking.  Long term... No idea (within a reasonable price range), but I'm sure we'll see a whole bunch of concepts pop up over time - just enjoy the journey. :)"

The Vive will have a big role in this, if only for the lack of a common pad, that force you to creative solutions. In life we don't spend 90% of time walking and 10%  interacting, rather (if we are person who love to move) the opposite. Probably the games in virtual reality will tend to play more real contexts."
oculus,3dtk6f,Rafport,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:14:50 2015 UTC,"< finally somebody gets it ! >    There's usually no intrinsic value to ""movement"" or traversal — Think of any open world design from 8 bit ""Zelda"" to ""Assassin's Creed"" and ""Witcher 3"" and how many fetch quests are involved. The common terminology in the games industry is a ""time sink"". It has always been about making the player go on these loops in service of pacing and inflating game duration. Some notable exceptions include ""Desert Bus"" or ""The Last Express"" but for the most part game production is all about modular assets yet teasing out a unique coherent world which we might believe.  These peaks and troughs in player intensity help to create the dynamics in your narrative structure. However there are very few games where traversal is not just a means to an end. Walking around or riding your horse in ""Skyrim"" for example is not particularly satisfying or nuanced. Rather it's the congruence of the open world that we feel traversing it's landscape. In place of any real granularity in terms of how we might be able to interact with that environment. There's a poverty of the senses due to both input, and simulation sides.  Whereas VR brings super detailed interactions at human scale to the fore. Imagine if all the effort and craftmanship that went into creating ""GTA V"" and Los Santos could be assigned to realising a simple house, or apartment block with as much detail. Where every object was interactable with persistent state, and properties that gave it purpose rather than a canned line of description. Lionhead were working on this concept in their internal ""Room"" demo a decade ago. Though we still buy into the hype of games like ""Far Cry"" and ""No Man's Sky"" that promise scale and expanse but with a paucity of meaningful interactions."

However these ways depend on what technology makes possible. it is also the desire to experiment and take risks, which ultimately is quite low. Working on the outline (story, characters, scenarios) not on the concept of maze, prize and antagonism.  This is a great opportunity, because you have enormous and unimaginable benefits in some situations, and the limitations in others. And the paradigm of the labyrinth does not work, you can not wear down the character making him run for dozens of hours. You have to find concepts that take advantage of the individual situation. The whole life is based on situations, moving from one place to another it is often a waste of time that the greatest pleasure.  It took me a while to figure it out, I was very worried for the sim sickness (I suffer a lot, so I can see clearly how the classic locomotion can not be the future of VR).

Vehicle you're tethered to: ride in a car around an area then when you want to explore a room/small space you ""get out"" but are tethered to it (maybe it has an oxygen tube and you're in space, or it has a chain you're tied to and you're some kind of prisoner).   Hovering platforms: Obviously my personal favorite. You cruise around on a platform that hovers and can go wherever.   First Person Detail/ Third person travel: when you want to explore an area you go into first person but when you want to roam around you kind of go out of body experience mode and see a third person character (kind of like the vr ""game"" sequence in the movie 'Her'). I think this one will be used quite a lot.   Mech/Helicopter/Cockpit: as long as you have a stable frame around you, moving all over doesn't make people feel so sick so a lot of travel around motion sickness can be avoided by having a ""cockpit"" surrounding you.     I could go on and on, but your question ""how do we get to explore los santos"" leads me to believe you don't really understand what makes VR cool in the first place."

Somehow the fact they can make people sick hasn't diminished them as a valid market.  I know, it's a matter of degree and VR makes more people sick, but not all.  IMO the biggest risk for VR scaring folks away is talk like ""all motion must be 1:1"", ""normal controls aren't good enough, you have to deisgn your game specifically for VR"" and ""have to be real careful or you'll get sick"".   That's a good way of scaring off customers and developers from the platform.

When it made contextual sense for a review of a new FPS to open with a qualifier: ""If the current crop of Doom-clones doesn't give you motion sickness, you might want to check out...""  ...and now it's a rarity that spoils a common activity for a small subset of people.  If you look further back, you'll find that every technological innovation that incidentally triggered visual-vestibular discomfort has undergone a similar wave of initial sufferers tapering off as people have acclimatized to new stimuli.  Closed-cabin travel, motion pictures, Steadicam, HFR, large-format projection, first person shooters, iOS 7 FFS - they all caused concern and controversy, and then people got used to them.  It's absurd to expect developers (and users) to forego the most straight-forward solution for locomotion altogether, because a  subset of people are sensitive to motion sickness in VR.   That'd be exactly like expecting game developers from the '90s onward to alter all first person shooters to teleport player like chess pieces to avoid a problem that largely solves itself.  We certainly hope devs take common sense steps to mitigate motion sickness for sensitive people (like avoiding attenuation of acceleration, etc) - but an analog stick or other input remains the most elegant solution to the problem of moving a player through a world that's  larger than their playspace, and it's absurd to expect people to ignore that."
oculus,3dtk6f,spyro2000,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:13:20 2015 UTC,"VR sickness is obviously much, much worse than any of the things you just mentioned.   VR sickness is much more severe and much more common than FPS-sickness ever was. It's also not something that you really acclimate too entirely. I've been exposed to a LOT of bad VR, and I still get queasy when turning with a stick or moving too fast too close to the ground.    Furthermore, much of the reason that FPSs cause less motion sickness these days is because of design changes. You'll notice that most modern shooters don't allow you to run at 60 miles per hour while ricocheting off of jump pads and flying through the air. We've also standardized on a comfortable field of view for desktop and couch play, which was not the case when these games first launched. This was responsible for probably 90% of the motion sickness complaints about FPS games. It's unlikely that we're going to find a single design slider in VR games that ameliorates the problem as much as this does.  Making a double-digit fraction of your audience sick is not acceptable. You'll incur a huge amount of ill will and bad PR, and poison people against the idea of VR. People don't generally return to experiences that cause them to vomit. The ideas of ratings helps, but VR sickness is complex. No rating can tell you with any kind of confidence whether or not you'll be comfortable in a given scenario.  The best choice for developers is to be careful about comfort, and design experiences that virtually all users will find comfortable. That means slow movement, no stick turning, third person or cockpit where possible, etc.  Within those constraints, we can start to find design choices that let us achieve rewarding experiences -- without making anyone puke."
oculus,3dtk6f,BullockHouse,2,Sun Jul 19 23:01:19 2015 UTC,"VR sickness is obviously much, much worse than any of the things you just mentioned.    Physiologically, it's exactly the same thing as all of those.  Visual system registers movement, vestibular does not.  (Or vice-versa.)    Furthermore, much of the reason that FPSs cause less motion sickness these days is because of design changes. You'll notice that most modern shooters don't allow you to run at 60 miles per hour while ricocheting off of jump pads and flying through the air.    This assertion is easily falsifiable, since most people (such as myself) who experienced ""Doom sickness"" in the nineties did get over it, and can return to those self-same games without issue, even when presented on a FOV-filling display rather than a 14"" CRT.  Also, modern FPS games frequently have similar FOV and mechanics.  (Compare Titanfall and Doom - within 10 degrees FOV and the modern game features a much more disorienting player trajectory.  It's not design changes to games that have made FPS-sickness a non-issue, it's player acclimatization.)  Obviously, this is not to say that it's not important to consider player comfort when designing for VR, or that people will simply get used to jarringly poor design choices - but avoiding artificial locomotion altogether is an extreme solution that would be a huge disservice to users."

However, I still think you can do amazing things and tell fascinating stories in a room scale experience, so it's not something that worries me in the short and medium term.  I bet that in a decade or so we'll have great, simple, well designed and affordable treadmills (or something similar) that will only take two square meters or less and will deliver great experiences."
oculus,3dtk6f,mrmonkeybat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:54:58 2015 UTC,"Solutions will come, but I think it'll take a kind of genius to solve the locomotion problem through software and being used in every game, and any game that used a mechanic with a perfect locomotion solution would be the killer app.  3rd person to explore sounds good and all but it still causes some people discomfort when the camera is jerked around even without gradual acceleration.  Teleporting around is just unnatural and unless someone could make teleporting in itself fun (like the Portal Gun) then this isn't an answer either.  Distorting things so the player walks in circles while thinking he is walking straight might work, but not for really small spaces and therefore isn't really a good consumer solution.  I guess one could for example after reaching the end of the 15x15 or so area make the player turn around without him noticing, not by making him walk in circles but by some other method that made it so the brain of the player doesn't notice it, like for example saying for the player to turn 180 degrees but making it so the world doesn't turn 180 degrees.  It actually sounds complicated, but isn't really. Imagine there is a 100 meter distance for one to walk, but the player only has a 5 meter distance, after he walks the 5 meters in the real world and the virtual world, the world mirrors itself, so that what used to be the front is the back and vice-versa, which means that the player has again another 5 meter distance and he could just keep going and the world would keep turning, if he wanted to go back however he'd need some input, if I had to say it would be turning around without reaching the boundaries of the real space. People definitely wouldn't know where they were looking at and at which direction they're pointed towards in the real world, but that's what we want."

oculus,3dtk6f,Rambowjo,3,Sun Jul 19 09:17:12 2015 UTC,"I think the mistake is to assume that only room-scale movement is VR.  If the market insists on that, then it will fail.  Wii's long term problem was not the control scheme, it was that the platform was woefully under-powered next to their competition.  Wii had plenty of good games that didn't fall into the trap of the gimmick, where control was not very exotic and used zero of the specific features of the controllers (though I liked the one per hand ergonomics).  That said, metroid with wiimote to this day is the only console FPS experience that I enjoyed and thought 'this is better than using a mouse', and I hope to see that in VR.  Even the ones where it was a gimmick, it was sometimes quite a fun little gimmick, so there was definitely a space for those too (and is the whole driver for Nintendo's massive revenues of the time, do not discount the value of a fad).  For VR, people have to keep in mind that there are a lot of problems with room-scale VR in practice.  One is that the vast vast majority of folks don't have a 15'x15' area to just say 'boom: vr dedicated room'. If you don't have a family, you probably have nearly zero space.  If you do have a family, you probably don't have that much extra space to unilaterally take over for your stuff.  This is also a problem for rockband/ddr/other games that want to impose on your living space a lot.  Another problem is common with the Wii and DDR:  playing a game like that is tiresome.  After a brief honeymoon of people trying to play it true to the game designer intent, you quickly saw folks start using the smallest flicks of the wrist to do it easier before finally getting over the whole thing completely.  It is important that VR market makes it clear that less 'special' experiences are viable and still get a lot of enrichment from being a VR title/used with a headset.  Enthusiasts tend to get all excited and talking about remodeling a whole room, talking about omnidirectional treadmills/spheres, and/or insisting that people will run around and jump in real life to control in-game.  They think this is awesome, most folks think ""wow that sounds like a hassle, I'm not going to bother with this thing if its that much trouble"".  This is why I think advocating the xbox controller is probably the smartest move oculus could make.  It grounds mass market expectations in the realm of the familiar and comfortable.  Sure, enable the enthusiasts with Oculus Touch and room-scale tracking capability, but don't fixate on it enough to scare away the market."

You can publish full scenes straight to JanusVR via collada files.(not too big a deal, but still awesome)  The real magic?  These full scenes can be set to auto publish to the Inter Planetary Files System (IPFS).  What is IPFS?  Think of it as a form of the bit torrent network for transferring data, a form of the block chain of bitcoin for absolute and permanent file pathing, and a form of the Github file system for the FTP structure.  Basically a completely decentralized ""Domain hosted"" FTP for the entire world."

This Fire exporter says it gives you the ability to publish with ""no server needed"".  That's ridiculous.  You must install IPFS, which means you become the server - not only for your own data but also everyone else's data.  It's like BitTorrent but instead of storing and sharing just the stuff you care about, for the time you need to, you're required to store and share pieces of everything in the entire system, forever.  And if you don't, you and your data will be punished.  As the paper says, this sort of thing is not new and novel.  People have tried similar but even much less ambitious ideas before and failed, with good reason.  The whole thing is built on the fundamentally flawed premise that there's no limit to how much the system designers can exploit the resources of peers in order to achieve success for themselves.

When it was first implemented, you had to have IPFS installed, so I recommended the dev make it modular.  That means you can export a scene to JanusVR code without having to publish via IPFS.  Obviously you will need a server to host on.  As for the rest of your rant, It's game changing, in that you can now publish straight to the cloud from blender.  Once they flesh out the details and GUI, it will allow for much easier collaborative design from anywhere on earth.  It's also game changing because this is a VR web browser that has a P2P capability.  P2P itself is not all that impressive these days, but for anyone who's been paying attention to the base architecture of the metaverse, They would recognize that the bandwidth required will be a major problem for scaling it out to the masses.  Anything that makes the scaling problem easier to deal with is a huge step in the right direction.   The whole thing is built on the fundamentally flawed premise that there's no limit to how much the system designers can exploit the resources of peers in order to achieve success for themselves.

BitTorrent is successful for a good reason.  People decide what they want to store and share and for how long.  The amount of exploitation of peer resources is generally limited, at least compared to a system like IPFS.  You ask how the IPFS devs profit.  Easy.  If their system catches on, they gain fame and fortune.  Even if it doesn't catch on, they can always find others to blame, say it was ahead of its time, etc.  This could help them attain high paying jobs, academic positions, ladyfriends, etc.  The idea is simple and commonplace.  Take some hot technologies, combine them, add your own special sauce, promise the world, exploit the masses (peers), and profit.

It's designed to take that choice away from people as much as possible.  If you participate in the system at all, your resources will be used in ways that you can't control.  If you try to exercise control, you will be punished via withholding of your data from those you wish to share it with.  If you use IPFS, your local storage and network bandwidth - resources that have costs associated with them - will be used to serve other people's data.  The system was designed to guarantee that.  I didn't see anything in the paper at all about fairness that you, the person paying those costs, will derive a proportionate amount of benefit.  And there's a reason for that - it's practically impossible if you consider the asymmetry of demand for data in the real world."

The rest of the system is just a merger of already existing systems.   3.4.1 BitSwap Credit  The protocol must also incentivize nodes to seed when they do not need anything in particular, as they might have the blocks others want. Thus, BitSwap nodes send blocks to their peers optimistically, expecting the debt to be repaid. But leeches (free-loading nodes that never share) must be protected against. A simple credit-like system solves the problem:    Peers track their balance (in bytes veried) with other nodes. Peers send blocks to debtor peers probabilistically, ac- cording to a function that falls as debt increases.    Note that if a node decides not to send to a peer, the node subsequently ignores the peer for an ignore_cooldown time- out. This prevents senders from trying to game the proba- bility by just causing more dice-rolls. (Default BitSwap is 10 seconds)"
oculus,3dstvl,FireFoxG,0,Sun Jul 19 16:31:36 2015 UTC,"This looks to me like protection against leeching, not over-seeding.  In other words, it protects the system but not the user.  But maybe I've missed something and the protocol really does allow for fairness.  Let's say we give it the benefit of the doubt and accept that it allows for a perfectly fair 1:1 ratio of your data served by other people vs. you serving other people's data - and that users would have access to an IPFS client that allows such behavior.  Let's get really generous and say it's even the default behavior.  Is this delivering on the promise of ""no server needed"" in the view of a typical user?  Is it even any workable level of service?  Imagine that someone models their VR scene in Blender, hits the ""publish to IPFS"" button, and now their home Internet connection is on the hook for uploading however much of other people's data is needed to compensate for other peers serving up the data for this VR scene they've created.  Is that really a viable alternative to hosting on a server somewhere for most people?"

People usually use blender in partnership with groups of people, while actively deving something.  For these groups, the ability to quickly publish and propagate the changes out outweighs the bandwidth costs of hosting the system.  Also you average user of the network is the consumer, not the webhost/webmaster.  Nobody expects a consumer to set this system up.  This system is more suited to quickly scale up the bandwidth for the slashdot effect. The slashdot effect will become a huge problem for the metaverse for a variety of reasons(particularly the multiplayer severs).  Also, as I understand it, this system can be put on a Linode box or whatever. Set up a few dozen nodes across the world, and you have a system that is FAR FAR more scalable then a few dozen dedicated unconnected servers.  Think of this as a P2P variant of the scalable aspects of cloudflare.  As an example, I have like 10 websites with 10 different FTP hosts.  If the slashdot effect hits any one of them, that website goes down. With this system running as a single large CDN, it will auto scale to meet demand from the other 9 FTP hosts I have.  Again, this is as I understand it, but feel free to make your own call on it."

After poking around in the settings I found that the game offers a FOV slider that goes all the way to the magic 120!!! After a few tweaks to the game settings I loaded it up and proceeded to be blown away by just how good this one is. I would say that this game is as close to native VR support as it gets using VORPX. The head tracking is spot on, and the graphics look great. there is a small issue I haven't nailed down yet with a weird effect when my character gets hit by something, but it is minor.

When you get your Rift you put the camera on your desk, plug it and the HMD in a USB port, install Oculus Home and you're good to go. It will be as easy as plugging in an Xbox controller or a USB stick.  Valve's solution has a one or two more steps after the initial hardware set-up (installing Steam if you haven't, download Steam VR and setting up the chaperone borders), but I guess the drivers will come with Windows 10 as well."

Edit: *It's easy to trick it, to trick it accurately enough that your (simulated) visual input matches the vestibular input you are creating would probably be somewhat of a feat. One's vestibular system learns from birth so it's quite safe to say you'd need to do a damn good job of this tilting."
oculus,3du13u,YesICannabis420,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:15:51 2015 UTC,"On there it says linear deceleration causes a pilot to feel the sensation the nose of the craft is pitching downward.    That makes sense with what I said, its actually the inverse.  The Pilot felt he was tilting downward because slowing down caused the fluid in his inner ear to move forward and up, which is the same shift that would occur if he himself were to lean forward and down.    We may not be able to match the exact vestibular sensory happening, but we may be able to get just close enough to stop people from feeling motion sickness."

Was just hoping it might provide some vague confirmation that yes, indeed if you screw with your vestibular system you can perceive (false) changes in the real world. This meaning if your tilting was done perfectly it might be able to negate enough of the visual/vestibular disconnection that causes VR/sim/motion sickness to give a smoother experience. Not sure how it would perform in high intensity situations with loads of movement, however could provide a natural addition to immersion for hardcore flight sims in that deceleration/acceleration and banking might be things that could be done smooth enough, and those out there who spend hundreds or thousands on a cockpit setup might be enticed by this kind of extra immersion. I don't think it could ever be a true fix-all for VR sickness though.  Edit: *Expanded"

oculus,3duvvt,yourparentss,2,Sun Jul 19 18:49:21 2015 UTC,It's actually a decent idea. It would be insanely niche though and only exist in possibly a VR arcade or corporate level.  You could have a room sized version to fit the Vive say 14 feet by 14 feet and map out the terrain of a single walkable area. Using your 'hover platform' to move locations. This would just be one part of the room that doesn't change each location of course :0)  Nice idea but unfortunately will probably never exist outside of this thread.

I can give you approx motor size and height of the units base. The pins could rotate and also be divided across treads if based on our previous concepts. The base could rotate and angle as a whole as well. Big bucks. i am playing with a new design lately. Remember you heard it her first :P   Its basically a platform which is the inverse of snake scales.

oculus,3duvvt,AudezeFanboy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:02:16 2015 UTC,It'd be pretty cool and capable of extreme detail but you would need to put the pins on a belts or something so they move around. To simulate levels it seems like it'd be simpler to raise or lower the level of a belt instead.   Your idea would be insanely awesome to simulate differing pressure. Like imagine stepping through a swamp and your foot sinking down and then encountering more resistance as it goes down.
