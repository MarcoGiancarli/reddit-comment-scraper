cripplingalcoholism,3e26jm,ruoqiLehTmAI,8,Wed Jul 22 00:03:31 2015 UTC,Yea you definitely get your energy back because you sleep better. But life sucks so that energy doesnt really mean much.
cripplingalcoholism,3e26jm,asrhx4,7,Tue Jul 21 12:59:04 2015 UTC,"im mostly sober, i probably drink like a normal person now, few drinks with friends, rarely drink more than 1/2 a bottle of wine now. before that it was 2 bottles of wine a night. i had to quit because mentally i was broken. anyways to answer your question, at first you get an energy boost and you feel awesome. then that wares off and you get bored. this always made me go back to drinking. i now take baclofen which kills the cravings for booze, so after a while the boredom went away. it takes time but you get used to it, that siad there is no way i could be sober without baclofen, cravings were just too intense."
cripplingalcoholism,3e26jm,Neophyte-,3,Tue Jul 21 12:44:54 2015 UTC,I relate to this experience. Only for me: naltrexone.
cripplingalcoholism,3e26jm,roscoesdead,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:01:12 2015 UTC,"Baclofen is a muscle relaxer, no? I only ask because I want to slow down on the liquor but I'm worried about the withdrawal. And yes, I know it's not good to lie to your doctor but he will take away my methadone take home doses if I admit to being a CA. I work, and I can't be going to the pharmacy every single day for my drink, even though I'll be done with it in a few months."
cripplingalcoholism,3e26jm,ruoqiLehTmAI,2,Wed Jul 22 00:06:50 2015 UTC,"yeah it is a muscle relaxer which makes it sound ominous given what youre taking but I think you would be ok, im on a high dose 250mg, the only side effect is that i get double vision when im tired and i snore a lot. there is a prescribing guide if u want more info http://www.scribd.com/doc/105506724/Prescribing-Guide-for-Baclofen-in-the-Treatment-of-Alcoholism-Final-Version  not sure about mixing it with methadone, it might be ok because you are tolerant to the dosage as its for maintenance. just my guess. yeah be careful admitting youre a CA to the dr, they will limit any help to ""stop drinking"", and they will definitely take your methadone away."
cripplingalcoholism,3e26jm,Neophyte-,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:13:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your genuine response.  I got up to 70mg when I stopped shooting heroin/coke(sometimes together)/pills (the doctors here try to push you to get up to 120mg) and I will be dropping to 7mg this Friday. I'll be done by Xmas, which works out well because my work closes for 2 weeks and I can ride out the withdrawal from the 100% drop. I just need to slow down... I'm getting out of control again. I feel like something like baclofen could help."
cripplingalcoholism,3e26jm,ruoqiLehTmAI,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:21:41 2015 UTC,"I think opiates are much easier to quit than alcohol, I found it the most addictive thing i've ever taken, so if baclofen worked for me it might do the trick for you, lots of people on mywayout forums who take it, thats where i first found out about it.  im curious, when you are on methadone, does it make you high at all or does it just make you normal and you have no cravings?"
cripplingalcoholism,3e26jm,Neophyte-,3,Wed Jul 22 00:42:45 2015 UTC,"Only if I'm on a paleo diet. People will laugh at me for saying that but whatever. If you're drinking constantly for years your gut flora is out of control and you get nasty things like Leaky gut syndrome and Candida. Look it up. The only way I feel better is if I eat no dairy, gluten or sugar and all organic which is what the paleo diet pretty much consists of."

cripplingalcoholism,3e26jm,thatshootingguy,3,Tue Jul 21 13:29:05 2015 UTC,"I was doing keto during my last sober streak and it helped a lot, because it gave me something to be occupied with. Spending time at the store closely inspecting labels and prepping meals, exercising every morning at 7am and doing my routine bulletproof coffee. To anyone planning on going sober, I'd recommend a diet and workout routine for this purpose alone (and also that, well, it makes you feel a lot better).  I got really into various nootropics as well (/r/nootropics plug). I probably have like 30 bottles of supplements sitting on top of my fridge."

cripplingalcoholism,3e26jm,arbitrarysquid,2,Tue Jul 21 19:06:38 2015 UTC,"I have been on the trying to dry out on weeknights, only binging weekends. It is such a hamster wheel like you described.  I find that I have a ton more energy the days I do not drink. Yesterday for instance I was able to wake up early, get a ton of stuff done at work. Worked out three times, cleaned almost my whole house. Looked at the clock and it was only 8pm. I immediately thought ""fuck, what do I do now before I fall asleep, all I want is some booze"" I held off the cravings, feel even better today.  That being said, even with more energy, you are still going to have to fight the idea of having some drinks before bed. I would suggest a sleeping supplement or anti-anxiety med like xanax, cuts the edge off.  TLDR:You will have more energy; find lots of things to preoccupy your mind from drinking."
cripplingalcoholism,3e26jm,facilities101,2,Tue Jul 21 17:49:53 2015 UTC,"I went sober for 15 months for health reasons so here's my 2 pence-  Yeah, you get loads more energy. You lose weight too if you were drinking loads of calorie laden beer. You will crave sweets / chocolate for the 1st two weeks as your body adjusts to not having the sugar from alcohol.   My mood gets better as I don't have fucking paranoia about black out adventures I had the night before. Memory also improves- get some thiamine to help this.   You need to get more hobbies, binge watch Netflix etc as there is a lot of time to fill when you're not wasted 24/7.  Sleep is a joy once your sleep pattern sorts itself out- getting a good nights sleep instead of passing out and waking feeling like you've been asleep for 5 seconds is great.   As for the mental cravings, chat to fellow alcoholics so you don't feel alone.   Good luck!"

I think long walks 2-5 miles are the best cure when you're craving. I had 145 days earlier this year. Felt great lost 20+ pounds.

cripplingalcoholism,3e26jm,roscoesdead,2,Tue Jul 21 12:30:29 2015 UTC,Fuck yea.  I pretty much have to obsess over something(s) to keep the demon's at bay and the mind becomes a noisy and uncomfortable space.  Your mileage my vary - I felt more energy when I quit for over a year but I was hitting the gym and dieting obsessively preparing for the start of a new job.
cripplingalcoholism,3e26jm,Nomaspapas,2,Tue Jul 21 12:47:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hear that. Last time I was (almost) effortlessly sober I had some amazing things to work towards at work and stayed happy and obsessed that way. Exercise also helps way more than you'd think. A combination of things help keep me from drinking and as long as I pile enough of them up together I'm good.

Being able to get out of bed, showering, brushing my teeth.  Force myself to go to work and do my job.  Definitely much easier to jerk the reins and take control when your taking care of yourself in some small ways, but depression and anxiety are a bitch."

When people either get completely sober or reduce consumption (doesn't matter which you prefer), they tend to take the time to eat better and/or exercise more.  That gives you more energy.  Also, you're body isn't in a state of inflammation constantly.  Your head clears up, and once your head clears up, your body follows.  You can do anything you set your body to."

""must have had some bad Chinese food last night.   I didn't even eat last night.  I went through a whole gallon of vodka, two doses of lsd, and an eighth of mushrooms this weekend.     I have to stop this shit.  I keep getting bad news about family. Last week, I found out that my sister is being put into hospice care for a gastrointestinal disorder.  She has about 5 months.  My dad was in the ER for a heart thing.. Doctors say his valves aren't working properly.   Last month, my brother found out he probably has leukemia..   I have to assume these are the reasons why I'm hitting it so hard.      I want help.  I call out for it.  It's no secret, the way I'm living.  I have no insurance.  Can't afford to go see a doctor for help sobering up.  I want to go to rehab, but again, no money.   I'm depressed.  I don't see any way out right now.  Something will give eventually though.  I'm just scared what it might be."

cripplingalcoholism,3dykwx,arbitrarysquid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:14:55 2015 UTC,"Basically, it's a psychedelic that comes from the Iboga root. It's illegal in America, so you'd either have to get it illegally or go to Canada where you can legally go to a treatment center and ingest it through an IV. It has a much larger success rate in treating addicts than the traditional methods, and I assume it's MUCH cheaper than a three month inpatient facility. Even cheaper if you can find someone who knows where to get it ;) but it's not too common where I live. Do some research and if you know someone who's deep web savvy, even better."
cripplingalcoholism,3dykwx,whiskeycats,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:28:09 2015 UTC,"Sorry to keep pressing instead of doing the research myself, but does it have to be done intravenously?

HOWEVER you can call your insurance people and ask for the member ID and all the information you need to tell the pharmacy and doctor's offices.  Im not on any antipsychotics so I should be fine. Uncomfortable but I'll live.   Get on finding a doctor!! Good luck with that. It's always a process getting to know them and answering the billion questions they have.

Regardless of the provider. USG or private.   1.Your Member ID (the number in question) 2. The Service Location (a #) 3. The Provider ID# with that insurer 4. The ICD-9 code for the diagnosis 5. The code for the treatment  Only one of those is under your control. Get the number. Get your meds. Go talk to your preferred provider. Do NOT jeopardize this opportunity but being lax.   Call. Be prepared with several forms of proof of ID. You need to not only identify yourself, but authenticate yourself to the insurer.

In communism, things are done not for profit, but to satisfy human needs and wants, this includes healthcare. In a socialist healthcare system, comprehensive healthcare is available to all at no charge to the user.   Doctors would be more abundant because the constraints of money wouldn't apply to those wishing to practice medicine, so all who show aptitude and desire to be doctors would be able to become doctors. Doctors would try preventative medicine first instead of this reactionary system.  As for booze, collective farms would set aside a certain amount of crops for animal feed, and animal feed is usually made from the discards of booze making.   You would also have a say in your workplace, every workplace would have democracy in how it's managed, what they do and your hours worked instead of the current system."

I even mentioned how the beginning of the month went off the rails due to a bender and that was why I was late answering her.  God bless her socks.

I don't have a car or a place to go and I'm supposed to be out today.  I told her It wasn't possible.  I still felt we were on good terms considering everything.  Then she shows up with her family trying to intimidate me to get out.  But her dad is only scary in a boardroom and her brother is a pussy so I stared them down and they all left. I tell them I need a week and rent is paid up through the month so they can shove off.  Fucking assholes.    It's her treating me like this that is so shitty.  Unexpected. Hurtful.

Almost every day like clockwork we'd leave work and go out to the local pubs where some fucked hijinks would ensue and then go to work the next day horrendously hungover or still drunk.   Throughout the day at work we'd talk to each other and help to fill in the blackout memory gaps.

I had a friend who still consistently drinks in bars even though he doesn't have a pot to piss in. I blame it on his upbringing (Newfoundland - like Britain - everyone goes to the bar).    There is a reason we drink at home besides the obvious one of not having to deal with dicks or worry about being cut off.  That reason - money.  If you are going to drink 26oz of booze a day, it will cost you a fucking fortune in a bar - that's roughly 18 drinks (at a min. of $5 a pop) that's a cool $100 for a night of drinking. Fuck there are people here who buy half-gallons for $10.    Hell, even if you have money then go and buy the good shit instead of the rot gut. So unless you are pulling in >100K a year and have no dependents it's just throwing away money.  You want company - fuck invite people over.    Second - gambling.  If you get the urge, pick a random name out of CA and send them money and then bet your fellow drinkers to see if it will ever get returned to you. Probably a much better investment and not a complete waste of cash.    However, if your only problems with booze are money-related then you have no problems at all.

cripplingalcoholism,3dw1j4,Sickwater,2,Tue Jul 21 05:30:42 2015 UTC,Oh yes.  AND! They stay open until midnight!  That's fucking 5 hours longer than the whole state of Oregon.
cripplingalcoholism,3dw1j4,donemythyme,2,Tue Jul 21 06:26:35 2015 UTC,In Oregon they  stop selling booze at 7? At SEVEN?!! Holy God in his Heaven and all his whores.   Circle K's And all 24 hour stores w/ liquor license will sell booze until 2am. And they start selling at 6am. Seven days a week.

cripplingalcoholism,3dw1j4,a-fulgens,3,Mon Jul 20 15:24:06 2015 UTC,"The biggest toll alcohol has had on me is not monetary, health, or relationship related.   It's the violations I've sustained while drunk. But as I'm drunk more often than not I never truly process it.   I think it's a totally different ballpark when you're a female alcoholic. Not to minimize male/other gendered alckys as they have their own set of issues."

cripplingalcoholism,3dw1j4,a-fulgens,2,Tue Jul 21 13:35:08 2015 UTC,I'm a brown belt in jujitsu and taekwondo (so I'm pretty good with take downs and grappling). I think my problem while BO is how accommodating I can get or how I don't want to cause social discord.   This comment has given me a lot to think about as to where my head is at while BO and maybe how I should reestablish my values in order to maintain self preservation rather than keep the happiness of the group ahead of me.   Black out WC sometimes act like a possum when threatened. Which is weird as that's not my personality or sober/tipsy/drunkish reaction in the least.   sorry for that mess of ramble.
cripplingalcoholism,3dw1j4,lemarchand,3,Tue Jul 21 14:58:56 2015 UTC,Anyone who is willing to take advantage of a drunk female does not deserve the benefit of being guarded from discord. They deserve a take down as a minimum (but more appropriately a shot in the foot [or dick] with a stinging nettle arrow of lava).

What starts out as a night with some beer ends up being a week with her drinking 18-36 beers a day for a week or so, then the hell of sobering up after that.
