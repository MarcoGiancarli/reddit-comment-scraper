ambientmusic,3dkjz4,Mvsk,3,Fri Jul 17 02:36:47 2015 UTC,"They're really good. ASC has released at least one ambient album also, I believe. I'm more familiar with his drum & bass work which is very atmospheric and inspired by ambient music. Also recommended if you don't mind some drums in your ambient."
ambientmusic,3dkjz4,apocalypse_k,5,Fri Jul 17 03:37:58 2015 UTC,"I'd like to recommend Taylor Deupree and pretty much every release he puts out on his 12k record label.   My personal favourite album by him is Shoals. Amazing use of field recordings, and the attention to detail on the 'microsounds' he uses is phenomenal.   Other highlights on the label are: Stephan Mathieu - A Static Place; Lawrence English - A Colour For Autumn; all the Seaworthy releases; and the new Shuttle358 release.   The label has a very strong aesthetic too if you're a fan of physical media."
ambientmusic,3dkjz4,Dashtego,2,Fri Jul 17 18:57:23 2015 UTC,Seconded. Deupree's Human Mesh Dance is a monumental body of work.

I used to work at The Leaf Label, was onboard during the Grinning Cat and The Boy and The Tree years, and accompanied Yokota on a mini-UK tour (with dates supporting Philip Glass), even helping out with the performances on occasion. And I had a hand in Lo Recordings' distribution when they released the Rothko collaborations and the Symbol album.  Yokota was a gentle soul with a playful side. He had interests in folklore and spirituality, and was somewhat of a modern day hippie. We had fun finding unusual percussion instruments for his shows and playing with bubble guns and silly string. I can't believe he's gone... Way too soon."

I continued to browse for the next 30 minutes, adding a few CDs, putting a few back, mostly just marveling at the gorgeousness: somebody had found a way to capture something essential about a wide range of classical pieces that I loved, and then mixed them up in a subtle, modern way.  After the album ended, I looked at the stack of CDs in my hand. None of them were half as promising as what I'd just heard, so I put them all back.

I still can not find any think as soothing, centering, and versatile as Lichen. It works for rainy days, foreign days, stressful days, tea time, adding atmosphere, and many more occasions.

Basically a lot of stuff you could hear in a room without an amp/speaker. Not super minimal but hopefully I'll be able to get the right tone."

ambientmusic,3asnj1,Psychedelicool,2,Tue Jun 23 09:44:11 2015 UTC,"I use a lot of different reverbs, but have a few I use more regularly.  For acoustic/real instruments I use Altiverb 6, which is a Convolution reverb. Essentially, they record the reverb of a space, which then emulates playing in that space.  So you can play through cathedrals/venues/barrels etc..  For everything else, I use Redline Reverb.  Easy to use, can do insanely long reverbs.  Can get really strange.  I guess those are my two favorites."

ambientmusic,39smqu,nyul-,1 point,Sun Jun 14 10:53:28 2015 UTC,This isnt ambient. Far too active. The irst half isn't ambient or post-rock. There's simply no texture or atmosphere and it's too active to be ambient. When the delay pedal guitar kicks in it makes more sense to call it post-rock. That first part should be maybe 15 seconds long instead of several minutes. It would improve this drastically. In the end it still just feels like a meandering track that doesn't evoke anything or go anywhere.

My dream is to create something with the harmonic sophistication of Mr. Budd's album, and I think it is within my reach if I work at it some more.

Woo, that's deep. I would also like to add that as we continue to be an overworked and perpetually stressed society, there is a very strong natural urge to slow down and breathe. Ambient music is something that helps us to focus the mind and tune out the constant chatter. It can be a great aid in meditation. I suppose I'm more optimistic, recognizing that destruction can make way for creation.   That and Taylor Swift.   She's actually a newfound guilty pleasure for me.

ambientmusic,387ctm,empw,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:29:26 2015 UTC,"Electronic voice phenomenon:       Within ghost hunting and parapsychology, Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) are sounds found on electronic recordings that are interpreted as spirit voices that have been either unintentionally recorded or intentionally requested and recorded. Parapsychologist Konstantīns Raudive, who popularized the idea in the 1970s, described EVP as typically brief, usually the length of a word or short phrase.   Enthusiasts consider EVP to be a form of paranormal phenomena often found in recordings with static or other background noise, however, psychologists regard EVP as a form of auditory pareidolia (interpreting random sounds as voices in one's own language) and a pseudoscience promulgated by popular culture. Prosaic explanations for EVP include apophenia (perceiving patterns in random information), equipment artifacts, and hoaxes.

ambientmusic,387ctm,empw,4,Tue Jun 2 13:06:42 2015 UTC,Thanks! I was about to pop this into Vim and sort it out. :P
ambientmusic,387ctm,empw,2,Tue Jun 2 15:02:08 2015 UTC,Vim?!  I could never get behind it with editors like SublimeText and Komodo.  What am I missing?
ambientmusic,387ctm,SirBoVice,2,Tue Jun 2 15:10:25 2015 UTC,"Truth be told, I recently picked it up after installing Arch Linux as my primary OS. I figured it would be good to have some knowledge of the greybeard arcana, and so I'm learning Vim because it's everywhere, lightweight and very nimble. I'm going to give emacs a go soon too.  You should ask /r/vim about it if you're curious. They're a nice bunch, but perhaps a little biased. :)  I really like how quick it is for navigation, with its mnemonic editing and navigation commands.  I'm looking to go 100% keyboard controlled, as I find it annoying to switch between the mouse and the keyboard constantly, and I firmly believe that pure keyboard control is faster and more powerful for text editing, if properly supported. I also got sick of using the arrow keys to navigate.  Fire up a terminal and launch vimtutor. Work your way through it for some quick examples of its power. It'll seem weird at first, and then it becomes automatic, and you miss the controls when they're gone.  Big protip for Vim though: Rebind CapsLock to be Control and Escape. That is, Control when chorded with another key, and Escape when pressed and released alone (the command executes when you release the key).  if you use i3wm, you can put this into your config file when you've installed xcape (find it on Github):  exec xcape -e 'Control_L=Escape'  It's super awesome. Rebind Caps Lock to another key if you really want it back.  Vim-like controls are also available for web browsers. Try VimFx for Firefox (super easy rebinds!), or the much more obtuse, but equally powerful Vimium for Chrom(e/ium). I have become entirely addicted to web navigation via keyboard in the span of one week. It's a total game changer.  If you have any questions, ask away!  I had a bit of experience with SublimeText and it seemed pretty good, except for the less intuitive keyboard control. I hear a lot of people are jumping ship for Atom these days? I haven't tried Atom or Komodo.  I am learning how to program, hoping to turn it into a source of income someday, and I would like to become intimately familiar with the best text editor available. I'm not sure which one that would be (for my needs), as I'm just getting to know them all, so I'm open to suggestions!"

ambientmusic,37x8ci,xkjs,14,Sun May 31 03:54:13 2015 UTC,"Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks  I love the concept of it as well as the music. It was supposed to be the soundtrack to a documentary about the Apollo moon missions without any kind of narration or interviews. Just raw footage shot during the missions.   The film was never released in that format though if I recall correctly because the studio thought it would be too out there for the general public. It was recut with narration to make it more marketable.  Plus, you can't really go wrong with the combination of Brian, Roger and Daniel Lanois."

During the long endless days of northern Scottish summer, the humming fans and turbines of the farm I lived on would run throughout the night, keeping barns of barley dry from the summer air. The smells and images, accompanied by the natural and industrialized sounds of wildlife and machines, have combined to create some of my strongest and most cherished memories. Throughout my entire life I have been fascinated with sound and the impact it has on the ability to conjure emotions.  Voices, accents, and natural sounds remind us of far away places, and family and lands we once knew, just as songs and movements speak to moments in time and our connection to others. Within these memories are our stories, our feelings and our emotions, our grasp at life and our limited understanding of what happens next. Moments solidified into experiences and of wonder. The joy and laughter, the dance, the sorrow of loss; these moments make up life as we understand it.  I will attempt to recreate some of these emotions of life through song and sound, and to venture into the unknown that lies ahead.  – Mattie Bowen"

ambientmusic,36mns2,awkwardhipsters,1 point,Wed May 20 14:35:52 2015 UTC,"For those interested in why, and how: I wrote this with several things in practise.  Firstly, I wanted to write something in the same way Erik Satie would, to write a piece that had no defined bar lines. There is clearly a beat, but the rhythm and flow of the vocal part has no consistency to it which was my intention when writing the vocals.  Another element was Aleatoricism. I recorded the droning (that sounds like feedback) by firstly tuning each string of my guitar to an E Major Chord (the relative major of the vocal part, C# Minor). I then held the very point of the guitar against the cone of my speakers, and played the Vocal Track through them. The strings of the guitar would resonate against the vocals, which is why the drone becomes more potent in deeper, or louder areas.  Other elements are allusions of bitonality (when in fact it is just C# Aeolian), Impressionism, and others."

ambientmusic,35qy2b,nkrera,5,Tue May 12 19:54:23 2015 UTC,I hope this works out. I've been looking forward to a new album from Helios.
ambientmusic,35qy2b,ThinkBlue,3,Tue May 12 23:43:40 2015 UTC,Call me a cynic but why has he chosen kickstarter to release it?
ambientmusic,35qy2b,pernero,3,Tue May 12 22:05:48 2015 UTC,"Hard to know. I'm sure that he doesn't shift many units as a standalone artist. I mean, he's very good, but he doesn't have a very large fanbase, and the labels he has released with in the past don't have a very large reach. However, I'm sure he wouldn't have much hassle securing a release contract with some independent label.  My (limited) understanding of the record industry is that the record label takes a large slice of the pie when it comes to record sales (both as profit, and to cover release and promotion costs), and many bands tour extensivel (and sell merchandise at their shows) in order to make a living for themselves.  Since he doesn't typically play live (let alone go on tour), and his online store can't be that busy, my guess would be that he's opted to self-release in order to maximise the money he will make from the album. He can cut out a lot of the costs associated with releasing the album by using online means to promote it, and by putting in the hours on preparing the release himself.  From my point of view this would be understandable, as he does have a young family to support. He has been doing a lot of advertising work in recent years (he's responsible for a hell of a lot of jingles you hear on TV commercials for companies like Apple), so it does seem like he's got his business hat firmly on these days. And who can blame him? Despite how great they are, I'm sure his previous Helios releases didn't net him much cash.  Whatever his reasoning, I'm just glad that he's releasing music as Helios again. The snippets of tracks from the album that I've heard over the past year (he's posted a few very short clips on SoundCloud) sound great and I can't wait to hear the final product."
ambientmusic,35qy2b,MirrorLake,1 point,Tue May 12 22:13:21 2015 UTC,"To make printing CDs profitable, independent artists need to bulk order them.  At least, that's my understanding.  So if his audience that wants the CDs is too small, the money never gets transferred and he potentially saved himself from a huge loss."
ambientmusic,35qy2b,twomongsmakearight,2,Wed May 13 03:15:00 2015 UTC,"IMO, it does not cost $20,000 to self-release an album on CD. Not even close.  Here is a breakdown of costs for a standard project:  Distribution of the album digitally and on CD Free on Bandcamp/kickstarter, minus the 10-15% cut they take. Physical distros (aka record stores, online and offline) take their cut on each record sold, but the artist/label is also getting more money back on sales than it costs to manufacture the record. Helios is already charging extra for shipping on the Kickstarter page, so in this effect, distribution costs should not be factored into expenses when making a record.  Manufacturing This is how much a 6 page high-quality CD in a digipak costs for 1000 units. Digital costs nothing.  Mastering Depends on who is mastering it, but even the high-end engineers like Dubplates and Mastering charge a max of 120 euros/hour, with the average album taking about 8-10 hours, depending on amount of tracks and work needed. No laquer work needs to be done as this isn't a vinyl project. So about $1500, maximum.  Promotion If it's self-released and via kickstarter, then most of the promotion is already taken care of. If you're putting adverts in places like The Wire and such (which is pretty worthless now IMO), then you'll be paying a couple of hundred dollars max. This isn't like Syro by Aphex Twin, where Warp paid ridiculous money for their huge PR campaigns. This is an ambient album by Helios. The audience is far narrower.  Hiring a director to do a video for each project / Artwork creation / licensing Again, depends on who they want to use, but we're probably looking at around $5000, maximum. I don't know any ambient artists who would spend any more on this. Many artists are friends with visual people anyway, who often do work for free or for discounted rates, especially on the artwork side of things. Unless there are samples that need to be licensed, then licensing shouldn't be factored either.  I estimate about $10,000, for a really high-end finished product, with good mastering, decent promotion, and artwork/video licensing costs. Indeed, half of this would be spent on the artwork and the video, with the actual album costing very little in comparison.  I like Helios' music and I'm glad he's found a means to get his work out there, but it's hard to justify these costs when you know how the process works."
ambientmusic,35qy2b,MirrorLake,4,Wed May 13 12:48:07 2015 UTC,"This is for two albums, though.  His and his wife's.  So if your estimate is $10,000... double that.  And if you bother to assume they're also asking for payment for labor for an entire year's work, you get past a valuation of $20,000.  Edit:   Just wanted to say that I still think it would be great if they were more transparent about the breakdown of the costs.  That's something I'd like to see in stone, rather than just speculating about it.  I think it's fair to assume they have a mortgage that needs to be paid, health insurance, utilities to pay, and they of course need to buy food.  Months spent writing albums will inevitably be months spent not touring and making money--so it's also fair to think that an artist could exhaust their savings during that period.  And in that sense, I think Kickstarter provides a safety net for them so that they can finish their work without worrying about starving or going broke."

Interludes do not mean ambient necessarily especially in regards to the artist genre not focusing on it.

ambientmusic,32ypom,DustbinK,2,Fri Apr 17 23:04:46 2015 UTC,Kind of? I feel like for a post-rock band they put a lot of effort into this. It's not simply an interlude like many other bands would do for an ambient track. The textures and that build up are fucking phenomenal. This is ambient you can blast super loud.

ambientmusic,32vqyy,Neirbonave,3,Fri Apr 17 02:49:26 2015 UTC,"It took me quite a few listens to 'get' it, but this is now one of my favourite albums. That guitar wall strike in little smoke is so powerful"
ambientmusic,32vqyy,iamnotclevr,2,Fri Apr 17 13:17:25 2015 UTC,"Funny how this album seems to have so many divided reactions at least initially, cause I fell in love with this thing on first listen. I love the depressive, cacophonous sound they've got going on this record. Much better than Another Language IMO, that has much more generic post rocky tropes on it."
ambientmusic,32vqyy,iamnotclevr,3,Fri Apr 17 13:56:05 2015 UTC,"I think tunnel blanket polarized me because I was expecting it to sound like their self-titled. I was very new to the genre so the 'generic' sound hadn't gotten old to me and I didn't want to hear anything too different.  I am still a sucker for certain post-rock tropes when they are executed well. TWDY pushes the right buttons for me, and I love that they don't rely on screeching tremolo picked guitar and crash cymbal explosions to signify a climax or whatever.  So I really did like Another Language, imo it was a good blend of their old style as well as their new doomgaze side.  It'd be easy to cater to their fanbase and follow the same exact path album after album (cough cough explosions in the sky) but its awesome how they pulled a 180 with T.B. and went in the right direction with A.L.  Anyway, yeah, the atmosphere from this album is incredible. I read that they recorded with over 30 different instruments, even one made out of bone.  Personally I'm not sure how this album makes me feel yet. The first song is really overwhelming and claustrophobic but after that its makes me feel at peace, like I'm watching the chaos from a distance. I know this is the story of a psychedelic trip gone wrong, and it does a great job of that, you can really feel the thought loops in Little Smoke.  I guess overall it makes me feel like I died and evaporated into space"
ambientmusic,32vqyy,CapNCookNED,3,Fri Apr 17 16:14:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah totally get what your saying. I've been very into post rock for almost 2 years now I'd say that even though these ""generic post rocky tropes"" make me roll my eyes sometimes, they definitely can be executed very well, and TWDY are totally a great example. While I much prefer Tunnel Blanket over any of their other stuff, their debut is still a great great piece of good ol post rock. Another Language is also a great album even though I kinda ripped on it, I just find Tunnel Blanket much more interesting and gripping. I definitely agree that they found a really good balance between their classic post rock and doomgaze sound on A.L., I just like it more when they go full doomgaze. I think that sound is more unique to them and they do it better than any other band I've heard thus far. Plus Im just a sucker for really really loud heavy shit.   Totally with you on the sound, the layers and walls they've got going are incredible. Where did you read about all the different instruments and the psychedelic experience on Little Smoke? I looked it up and couldn't find anything. Thats awesome though, that song makes a lot more sense now and actually is more powerful. Thanks for bringing this to my attention. Cheers."
ambientmusic,32vqyy,iamnotclevr,2,Fri Apr 17 16:32:49 2015 UTC,"The recurring theme on Tunnel Blanket is death in my opinion. When I listen to it, it strikes me as a kind of journey through the various phases and aspects of dying and death as a concept in general. Songs like Killed the Lord, Left for The New World make me believe there is some kind of new-beginning theme in it as well, so death as just another crossroad in the eternity of the universe. When I listen trough the whole album, I feel kind of cleansed, or something, its hard to explain. It ranges from hauntingly beautiful to crushing walls of sound, and I think this album is by far, speaking from an artistic point of view, their best."
ambientmusic,32vqyy,iamnotclevr,2,Fri Apr 17 18:19:36 2015 UTC,"I definitely get a sense of hope from those parts of the record as well, it's interesting that that is not the way that they felt:   (Tunnel Blanket's morose title refers to an acid trip during which a blanket became ""the tunnel {that} takes you to the place where the dead rest."" And indeed, the record is driven by the theme of death, which Galindo calls ""a personal experience. As far as we are concerned, at the end of the tunnel, there is nothing."")   I totally get you on the spiritual cleansing thing, listening to it straight through in a dark room is quite the journey. I feel the same after listening to The Seer (when song for a warrior comes on... oh man)  I don't know how to meditate but I imagine doing so with this on would be refreshing  Also if you haven't heard it here's the sample from the end I'd recommend watching all three parts, its very interesting. Anyway this sheds a little light on their views of life after death, as well as nicely tying in the album title"

ambientmusic,321vp5,Rossegut,3,Fri Apr 10 02:32:39 2015 UTC,"Aphex Twin and Brian Eno are both very popular and good places to start. I recommend:   Aphex Twin - Selected Ambient Works 85-92 Brian Eno - Discreet Music Brian Eno - Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks Brian Eno: Music For Airports   Aphex Twin has a Selected Ambient Works Vol. II that is more textured ambient than the downtempo dance ambient of 85-92. But it's two and a half hours long so I don't expect you to try it, it must be overwhelming to a beginner. But it's really good. Hope you enjoy."

Very peaceful and tranquil stuff.  Recommend the Sidereal Cycle, Excursion series and Sleep Theory Vol 1 & 2  Bing Satellites - More - a 5 hour collected album of just great ambient music.  Played this about 10 times thanks to work.  Good for a solid  afternoon session coding.  http://www.bingsatellites.com/releases/more/  Earlyguard - bit hard to find now he's removed a lot of stuff from bandcamp.  Pareidolia, Isolation and Lost in Time are excellent albums.   Might be on iTunes now.  Horizontal Excursions - Symphonica Helvetica.  Bloody awesome. http://astrangelyisolatedplace.com/2013/02/07/asip024-horizontal-excursions-symphonica-helvetica/  Scott Lawlor - Neptune.  Fantastic drifting spacey ambient music, slightly on a darker side.  http://music.earthmantra.com/album/neptune  Simon Slator - Halo.  Brilliant epic ambient with a piano vibe.  https://simonslator.bandcamp.com/album/halo  That should get you started.  Let me know what you like out of that and I've got plenty of gb of music to go through :-)"

ambientmusic,30m8ar,tom_gb,1 point,Sat Mar 28 21:01:35 2015 UTC,"Ambient music:       Ambient music is a genre of music and includes forms of music that put an emphasis on tone and atmosphere over traditional musical structure or rhythm. Ambient music is said to evoke an ""atmospheric"", ""visual""  or ""unobtrusive"" quality.  To quote one pioneer, Brian Eno, ""Ambient Music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular; it must be as ignorable as it is interesting.""   As a genre it originated in the United Kingdom at a time when new sound-making devices such as the synthesizer, were being introduced to a wider market. Ambient developed in the 1970s from the experimental and synthesizer-oriented styles of the period. Mike Oldfield, Jean Michel Jarre and Vangelis were all influences on the emergence of ambient. Robert Fripp and Brian Eno popularized ambient music in 1972 while experimenting with tape loop techniques. The Orb and Aphex Twin gained commercial success with ambient tracks in the early 1990s. Ambient compositions are often quite lengthy, much longer than more popular, commercial forms of music. Some pieces can reach a half an hour or more in length.  Ambient had a revival towards the late 1980s with the prominence of house and techno music. Eventually, ambient grew a cult following in the 1990s.  By the early 1990s artists such as Aphex Twin were being called ambient house, ambient techno, IDM or ""ambient"" by the media. Genre offshoots include dark ambient, ambient house, ambient industrial, ambient dub, psybient and ambient trance.

ambientmusic,309d38,OklahomaHoss,3,Wed Mar 25 15:18:10 2015 UTC,This isn't really ambient.  It sounds like house music.
ambientmusic,309d38,Eric4man,0,Wed Mar 25 15:48:45 2015 UTC,"This may not be your traditional atmospheric emphasized ambient music, but there were some notable ambient parts and parts that were at least ambient/beats or chill beats wich are sub genres of ambientmusic. I mean, I dont know if you decided to take the time or not to listen to all of the songs, but that was just my observation.  Its good music to say the least. I would not call him an ambient artist though."
ambientmusic,309d38,Psychedelicool,2,Wed Mar 25 17:44:56 2015 UTC,"I listened through all of the first song and most of the rest.  I agree there are ambient parts, but I'm usually looking at the whole, when commenting.  Which is closer to House music."

The audio files were recorded separate from the video camera, so it's not from the video cameras mic. I wasn't sure if I should just upload those, because they are not apart of an album or EP. Can you do just singles tracks? Any tips or suggestions? I'm still learning all this and especially Bandcamp."
ambientmusic,2zr9el,d54,1 point,Fri Mar 20 23:55:42 2015 UTC,"This isn't really ambient. I'd call the vocals dreamy, rather than ambient.  It's more along the rock spectrum."

ambientmusic,2zlgb5,tobeornotobe,2,Thu Mar 19 15:53:30 2015 UTC,The the guitar and the distorted squeal at the beginning remind me of the 28 days later soundtrack. And the glacial piano sound reminds me of Harold Budd. Good stuff.

ambientmusic,2xcntb,Psychedelicool,2,Sat Feb 28 01:18:14 2015 UTC,"Hey man. Thanks a lot. Well, I use ableton and I spend a lot of time on the internet looking for sounds, pads, drumkits that I can use. The whole producing phase, at least for me, comes down to one thing: Improvisation. I get a pad, work on it without a real purpose, just to see what goes with it, and then slowly I start to create a beat. It usually takes me about 3 to 6 weeks to create a track, and I usually work on 3 or 4 at a time. Not all of them make the cut, sometimes, I can't even use a single one. If you want to start meddling in ableton, but are skeptic about the learning curve, just go to /r/abletonlive, /r/ableton, and spend a few hours there, just taking in the info. I've been playing around with this DAW for about a year now, and it has tremendously increased my love for music. Have a great day man, and thanks for listening to it! :)"

I was under the (edit: erroneous) impression Brian Eno more or less coined the term ambient?  ""Developing in the 1970s, ambient stemmed from the experimental and synthesizer-oriented styles of the period. Although German bands such as Popol Vuh and Tangerine Dream predate him in the creation of Ambient music, Brian Eno played a key role in its development and popularization and is often erroneously cited as ambient's founder. The concept of background or furniture music had already existed some time before, but only in the 70s was ambient music first created, which incorporated New Age ideals with the newly invented modular synthesizer."""

In 2001 the album was re-released in a digitally remastered format with a second disc featuring a soundtrack for Dziga Vertov's 1929 film Man with a Movie Camera. See Substrata 2.

I am also glad I have never heard of any of these albums except for BOC and David Lynch. I'm very glad that you've decided to contribute.

ambientmusic,2wuiyw,futurealex,12,Mon Feb 23 11:22:46 2015 UTC,Agree and disagree with a lot of this list. Appreciate the Boards of Canada and the earlier Joe Meek but missing some Aphex Twin or Brian Eno? Or essentially some artists that paved the way for today's electronic music to be mass produced and consumed. But still a solid selected of great albums.

His ambient discography is extremely solid and consistent but there really aren't any standouts and I don't feel he's as important to the movement as many people would have you believe.  Forgive me if I think there are better IDM artists than RDJ, who always came across as rather basic to me."

ambientmusic,2wuiyw,Psychedelicool,0,Thu Feb 26 07:48:49 2015 UTC,"What's with your insistence that these albums are not ambient? They all:  1.) Dispel melody and instead focus on creating atmospheres, much like ambient's cousins noise and drone which focus on volume and timbre respectively.  2.) Recreate environments through suggestive instrumentation, synthesized sound effects or natural sounds and field recordings.  3.)

ambientmusic,2wuiyw,_mishka_,-2,Wed Feb 25 18:45:10 2015 UTC,"Eno's a fantastic musician but he's just below my top 10 and I prefer his rock stuff. Biosphere, Roach, Yagya, and Budd have escaped my notice. Robert Rich's stuff is decent but very little of it could be considered mold breaking or influential. And Aphex felt more like a variant of his much better IDM contemporaries than anything else.   No, this list is not objective (although I will defend that the process of ranking albums based on originality and spirit as pretty close.) This is more a parody of an objective list (specifically this one http://www.scaruffi.com/music/best100.html.)"
ambientmusic,2wuiyw,ifaptoyoueverynight,0,Wed Feb 25 22:35:21 2015 UTC,"It's funny how you disregard Eno's ambient music. I get that you are sick of the Eno-circlejerk, because believe me, I am one to get sick of genre-bound artist-circlejerks, but you should know there is a reason for Eno's status. Have you even listened to his Ambient 1-4 series, Thursday Afternoon or Apollo? It's pretty much nail on the head on the ""ambient sound"". And, if you prefer his rock stuff, then maybe you just don't like ambient? Which is totally okay, it's just funny you keep asking about ambient and disregard the absolute best (and I mean not best by my standards or even this threads standards, but pretty much the whole music industry's standard) pieces of ambient out there. I suppose the fact that you haven't even heard of Geir Jenssen pretty much sums up your knowledge about ambient. I think you problem is with ambient, not Eno to be honest. Maybe you want ambient to sound like something it doesnt sound like? Sounds like you just don't like the sound of this genre."
ambientmusic,2wuiyw,zinc_finger,-2,Wed Feb 25 22:52:04 2015 UTC,"""Industry standard"" is meaningless term. Because an artist was successful or had some copycats to their sound does not mean anything if their sound is not theirs. Eno's ambient is pretty decent but the sound does not distinguish itself, or do anything that hadn't been done for the past 8 years and even earlier by Krautrock musicians among others.   ""And, if you prefer his rock stuff, then maybe you just don't like ambient?""  Complete strawman, and perhaps your the one who doesn't like ambient. Much of Robert Rich and Eno's output resembles minimalist classical more than anything electronic, and that's what I'm covering for the purposes of this list, electronic ambient. Otherwise the top 10 would be composed of Satie and Cage, and that completely defeats the purpose.  ""I suppose the fact that you haven't even heard of Geir Jenssen pretty much sums up your knowledge about ambient."" I could just as easily criticize you for not knowing John Hassell, or Cluster, or Vangelis. Not mentioning a single artist means nothing."

ambientmusic,2vyo7l,ForestfortheDraois,9,Sun Feb 15 14:14:53 2015 UTC,"Helios, Jon Hopkins, Carbon Based Lifeforms, it really depends on what about the Ulrich Schnauss sound you like. Have you listened to his earlier albums, Far away trains passing by and A strangely isolated place? If not, I recommend starting there. Is it the ambient and experimental electronic sound you like in Ulrich Schnauss? Then I would suggest go listen to IDM artists like Ochre, Boards of Canada or even Biosphere or Kettel. If you however like Ulrich Schnauss more because the rock side of things, like in the Goodbye album of this post, I would suggest listening to Hammock or Slowdive early albums. Many people might suggest Tycho but I personally find him pretty boring sounding. You might also want to try more ambient artists such as Steve Roach and Robert Rich, but maybe thats too beatless for you.  Another suggestion: Robin Guthrie, beautiful ambient guitar music."

ambientmusic,2vegnd,autowikibot,1 point,Wed Feb 11 08:48:58 2015 UTC,The Color of Pomegranates:       The Color of Pomegranates (Armenian: Նռան գույնը) is a 1969 Soviet film written and directed by Sergei Parajanov. Five minutes were cut (mainly due to religious censorship) for release in the Soviet Union beyond Armenia. It was refused a license for export outside of the Soviet Union and was withdrawn after a two months circulation in the Soviet Union. It made the Top 10 list in Cahiers du cinéma  in 1982 and Top 100 in Time Out.

ambientmusic,2u97o7,e_rawk,2,Sat Jan 31 03:10:20 2015 UTC,So your first exposure to Eno was the Berlin trilogy then right? That's really cool. I think if I had discovered him that way my mind would have been blown.

Secondly, during my heavier techno days back in the early 90's I listened to a radio show on Kiss FM called Colin Dale's Abstract Dance, and he had a section called 'The Outer Limits' and had some occasional ambient(ish) pieces on there.    My interest in ambient kind of grew from there - going in to our local record store to order really obscure CD's always amused the owner as he would have to search through nearly every supplier's catalogue he had.  This was pre-internet days mind.  Now I trawl bandcamp and follow artists I like.  Plus there is one guy I follow who buys a shit ton of ambient almost every day and I pick the more interesting ones from his purchases to try out :-)"

So at this time there wasn't a holiday around to play holiday music for. So instead I was channel surfing, passed this one not thinking twice and WHOAH- had to scroll back. Come to find out the station played this amazing music... Music that ended up being ambient //down tempo and everything in between. It was the equivalent of a musical orgasm, as cheesy as it sounds. What sucks the most is that to this day I don't remember what song it was I heard that was so perfect, and got me hooked on the genre. I am also not sure if Music Choice still uses this format, to where they play amazing music in between holiday songs,  as I only watch shows online now. I hope they do so another channel surfing 14 year old can surf by and fall in love with it like I did."

ambientmusic,2tpq9s,abroerman,3,Mon Jan 26 13:18:47 2015 UTC,"That's exactly it - it's a fine line with ambient. Just the tiniest bit too over the top and very happy music can sound melodramatically sad. Even if it's in a major key, the majorness can give you that feeling of being lonely in a crowd.  Also, maybe it's just me, but I find a lot of the lo-fi ambient stuff to sound quite cold. For all that talk of the warmth of analog, I find Boards of Canada to have a freshness of a sunny winters day to it for example.  Thanks for your suggestions, they've gone on the list! I've had Nils Frahm queued up for a while but not listened yet! ""Keep"" has a bit of a Thomas Newman vibe to it :)"
ambientmusic,2tpq9s,abroerman,2,Mon Jan 26 13:33:30 2015 UTC,"This is tough!  I wish I could find an album, hell, even another track that gives me the same feeling as Bitstream's ""Crab Nebula"".  It's always felt like the most perfect form of electronic music, to me.  Also, you've probably heard this album already, but including it just in case.  Listening to it now, though, even songs like ""Clear Day"" (which I always thought of as very uplifting) could perhaps be thought of as melancholy in a different state...  Ulrich Schnauss - Clear Day  Ulrich Schnauss - A Strangely Isolated Place (full album)"

Not sure how I found out about it (maybe this sub?) but I rediscovered it on my hard drive a few weeks ago and I've been listening to it quite a bit since.

Riceboy Sleeps is in my top 5 albums ever, but I have to be totally ready for it if I want to listen, it's taxing on the brain in its thickness. Also, unfortunately a couple of the tracks bring back memories of a bad breakup so there's that.  I think mainly I'm after some nice uplifting music that doesn't require me to think too much about what I'm listening to. It's a very fine line between uplifting and reminding me that I'm a little lonely, like I'm looking through a window at other people's happiness... that got heavy quickly :p"

ambientmusic,2tnsjz,Eric4man,4,Mon Jan 26 00:58:33 2015 UTC,"Indeed, and there are many subgenres."
ambientmusic,2tnsjz,StrangeSea,-5,Mon Jan 26 01:12:11 2015 UTC,"Disagree completely.  It is music without a defined melody or beat/rhythm.  That is more focused on texture/tone than making a well defined ""song"".  Generally this means, no concrete rhythm/beat, no hooks, no singing, no lyrics etc..etc...  The subgenres aren't really subgenres.  Ambient techno isn't ambient in the least.  It's techno that is basically not about dancing.  There is a crap ton of stuff posted here that is either wanky experimental crap or full of beats and hooks.  None of it gets deleted.  The user gets removed from the group, but the posts remain.  They are all clearcut not ambient."
ambientmusic,2tnsjz,StrangeSea,6,Mon Jan 26 02:45:38 2015 UTC,"It is music without a defined melody or beat/rhythm   That sounds like it'd exclude albums like Substrata (which is one of the definitive ambient experiences for me).  Anyway, the fact that we're having this debate kinda proves that ""ambient"" means different things to different people. I'd like for the subreddit to get to a place where everyone is equally happy (or at least equally unhappy, but content)."
ambientmusic,2tnsjz,StrangeSea,3,Mon Jan 26 04:36:37 2015 UTC,"That's still rather vague though. And what about the tracks that are half beat-less, but drop something in near the end?"
ambientmusic,2tnsjz,StrangeSea,4,Mon Jan 26 04:59:22 2015 UTC,"I don't want to argue this too much, but a quick Google search:    The third track on Shaking The Habitual, A Cherry On Top abandons natural song structures in favor of an atmospheric, extended song. Starting with an ambient introduction and eventually evolving into medieval instrumentation... ... “A Cherry On Top,” a near-ambient nine-minute piece ... Dark-ambient electronica sounds from Sweden - The Knife finally drop their long-awaited album  ... over eight minute long ambient-like tune ...  It clocks in at eight minutes, the first five of which are some light ambient noise... “A Cherry on Top” is eight minutes of dark ambient rumbling ...  ... the ambient track 'A Cherry On Top' ... ... “A Cherry On Top”, an ambient foray of zither samples ...   Some people seem to think it's ambient, or at least has clear characteristics of the genre."
ambientmusic,2tnsjz,StrangeSea,8,Mon Jan 26 05:12:44 2015 UTC,"Dude your argument for this genre seems to be based purely on your personal definition of ambient. Genres of music are completely arbitrary distinctions for critics to be able to easily relate them to the masses. Brian eno who I am sure we can all agree is one of the Giants of the art does indeed use concrete rhythms, lyrical voicings and hooks. The piano can musically be called a voice, he uses repetition to form recognizable melodies that offer a catchy hook to a piece all over the top of recognizable time signatures. It is just often in a much more subdued or implied manner."
ambientmusic,2tnsjz,bear_hospice,3,Mon Jan 26 05:17:18 2015 UTC,Music without a defined beat or melody could also be anything from an atonal drone piece to avante garde death jazz metal. (A made up genre because like I said before they are arbitrary)
ambientmusic,2tnsjz,bear_hospice,5,Mon Jan 26 05:35:12 2015 UTC,Sorry man but I just think you are being a bit over the top by thinking there is only one true vision of ambient. And there is lots of unstructured music that isn't remotely ambient. That just means they could be improvising in fluid time or something or just smashing their instruments at random. So I'm just trying to say even your distinctions make no clear distinctions within any logical musical parameters. And dude yeah eno is totally pop ambient if that makes you happy to subdivide it like that but he is still a defining artist of the movement.
ambientmusic,2tnsjz,bear_hospice,5,Mon Jan 26 05:42:27 2015 UTC,"And yeah sure genre matters but I think like I said before only in so much to relay a ballpark on what type of musical elements we are going to hear. Ie something probably minimal and texturally based. Not saying what you think of as ambient is wrong. But obviously eno, some track by the knife, and some kraut rock (and also to say that is where ambient is derived from is even being silly. Sure lots of people were influenced by it but most of ambients hallmarks are rooted in classical compositions from like 1600 or like Gregorian chant or something.) but again there is no one true ambient sound is my only point here. Arguing for such a strict genre boundary so much so that you exclude certain artists based on some niche influence tracing is pure pretention and has nothing to do with musical merit and shouldn't define musical discussion or sharing."
ambientmusic,2tnsjz,DustbinK,6,Mon Jan 26 06:10:14 2015 UTC,Also I would like to point out literally all you do with this account is post your own music and then tell people what they posted isn't ambient music. That's just weak shit dude.
ambientmusic,2tnsjz,bear_hospice,3,Mon Jan 26 06:15:43 2015 UTC,You report stuff that YOU don't think is ambient because of your terribly harsh definition of it.
ambientmusic,2tnsjz,DustbinK,6,Mon Jan 26 06:59:27 2015 UTC,"Why can't it have melody or rhythm? Ambient doesn't just mean random noises that don't have a structure to it, that's really pigeon holding it. To me, ambient music is about creating an atmosphere, something you don't really need to listen to and dissect it, it's just creating a mood. Just because a song has a persistent recurring pattern or beat or vocals doesn't mean it isn't ambient. For me, ambient music is something you can hear without listening."
ambientmusic,2tnsjz,DustbinK,3,Mon Jan 26 08:02:11 2015 UTC,"Whoa, whoa there, buddy, no need to be aggressive. Ambient is a fairly broad term, I don't see why you need such a narrow definition for such a thing. Ambient music should create ambiance. Instead of being in the foreground it should be in the background, enhancing a feeling or emotion without explicitly telling you what to feel. I would tell you to get off your high horse but I don't think you'd survive a fall from such a height..."
ambientmusic,2tnsjz,bear_hospice,2,Mon Jan 26 08:08:39 2015 UTC,"No it can be foreground. You are the one narrowing it down. It can foreground or background, does not matter.    Eno would disagree."
ambientmusic,2tnsjz,DustbinK,3,Mon Jan 26 08:16:12 2015 UTC,"So what makes you have the right to define what Ambient is? If you don't think Brian Eno has some authority in the ambient music realm then your deluded, and you definitely have no authority to say what is an isn't ambient"
ambientmusic,2tnsjz,bear_hospice,1 point,Mon Jan 26 13:54:40 2015 UTC,"Oh I know, I just think the quote about it having to be in the background and also grab your attention at the same time is pretty accurate. Whatever it is he actually said."

ambientmusic,2tnsjz,WarrenInvisibleAgent,4,Mon Jan 26 03:21:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, many things are capable of creating mood and atmosphere, even out of the realms of music. The difference is Ambient music's main goal is to create these moods and textures without telling you what the atmosphere is. Other genres (usually) give you a rigid idea of the feelings the artists is trying to evoke while ambient music makes you derive your own concepts and thoughts on a piece of music, usually influenced by other emotions or environments not specified by the music."
ambientmusic,2tnsjz,Eric4man,1 point,Mon Jan 26 03:28:25 2015 UTC,"There's plenty of jazz, post-rock, various metal sub-genres, electronica, etc, where there's music that can be described this way even with this more in-depth explanation."
ambientmusic,2tnsjz,impulsenine,3,Mon Jan 26 04:14:41 2015 UTC,"I agree. I'm trying to say that these genres are not black and white. Music, as a whole, is a totally subjective thing."

ambientmusic,2tnsjz,linear_phased,1 point,Mon Jan 26 06:29:05 2015 UTC,"Hi Eric4man, who is your favorite ambient artist?  I checked out Tube. beautiful composition. Very nice creations. https://ericfourman.bandcamp.com/track/tube  I'm intrigued, if there were spattering of percussion in this track, how would you define the track?   I ask because I want to post some OC here when I have them finished, but they contain some percussion. I guess there are plenty of other fitting groups.  Thanks for your feedback."
ambientmusic,2tnsjz,ManuFortiSCO,-2,Mon Jan 26 06:34:44 2015 UTC,"Hey Warren.  Thanks for listening to my music, glad you enjoyed it.  My favorite ambient artist is Emeralds.  I'm not trying to discourage anyone from posting their music.  Containing percussion doesn't mean it's not ambient.  Please don't refrain from posting it because of me. I'm just trying to get a clearer idea of what ambient is according to this sub."

ambientmusic,2tg98q,fross,9,Fri Jan 23 22:13:00 2015 UTC,His influence reaches throughout most ambient music and beyond into many other genres.  The soundtrack to Legend was one of my first exposures to ambient music as a kid. R.I.P
ambientmusic,2tg98q,tunyfish,3,Fri Jan 23 22:15:07 2015 UTC,"So sad. I saw him live maybe 5 years ago, and while he looked old and frail on stage, he still knocked out a 3 hour set.  Truly a pioneer and prolific too. He did great work and I will miss him."
ambientmusic,2tg98q,stinky_cheese_dude,2,Fri Jan 23 22:38:05 2015 UTC,"Truly going to miss, RIP"
ambientmusic,2tg98q,externality,2,Fri Jan 23 22:20:10 2015 UTC,Damn sad news.
ambientmusic,2tg98q,wallofechoes,2,Fri Jan 23 22:25:10 2015 UTC,Hyperborea has been on my playlist perpetually since I discovered it in the early 1980s.  That headline really hit me.
ambientmusic,2tg98q,llornkcor,2,Sat Jan 24 05:58:00 2015 UTC,Tyger was the first Music I ever listened to. My oldest brother would sneak me into his room and put headphones on my little 4-year-old head that were so big on me he needed a headband just to keep them in place. And the raw symphonic power and melodic bliss that poured from that album was mesmerizing. Changed my life.  I am so sad at news of his loss and deeply regretful I never got to see TD. They seldom came my way as I entered my prime and was able to go out to see concerts on my own.  RIP Mr. Froese. Thank you for pioneering a genre. Thank you for your beautiful Music. And thank you for changing my life.

I have all the Tangerine Leaves and Tree live shows and everything, which is a huge collection, they have made, originally on vinyl and now on my external hard drive... this sucks! Thanks for introducing me to electronic meditations Edgar."
ambientmusic,2tg98q,roger_,1 point,Sat Jan 24 11:11:41 2015 UTC,My introduction to electronic music in the 1970s was mostly from two artists: Wendy Carlos (I listened to Sonic Seasonings a lot) and Tangerine Dream (Rubycon was a favorite). It's largely because of Edgar Froese that I enjoy electronic music so much. The news of his passing is very sad.
ambientmusic,2ti89y,piczmajster,2,Sat Jan 24 11:47:55 2015 UTC,This is one of my favorites of his. It's beautiful.

ambientmusic,2thfsb,throwy4444,2,Sat Jan 24 04:41:50 2015 UTC,I like how the piano delicately overlays the sound beneath.  The piece compels the busy mind to stop and listen.  I need more music like this.
ambientmusic,2thfsb,throwy4444,2,Sat Jan 24 04:44:01 2015 UTC,I have similar songs uploaded on my Soundcloud page from an EP I composed a few months ago. https://soundcloud.com/theatlasghost/sets/the-atlas-ghost-ep  Enjoy :)
ambientmusic,2tejeu,AMULETSATX,2,Fri Jan 23 14:05:16 2015 UTC,This was realy fucking amazing. I loved the looping cassette tapes. So much you can do to make ambient music!!

ambientmusic,2t9775,Psychedelicool,1 point,Fri Jan 23 12:49:04 2015 UTC,I'm going to try to create an ambient composition using some of the samples provided. I'm pretty slow at creating. I hope I can finish a track in time for the submission deadline.  Warren
ambientmusic,2t9yvk,Andreicristian,2,Thu Jan 22 10:20:19 2015 UTC,I like this. Lots of sounds.
ambientmusic,2t9yvk,Psychedelicool,2,Fri Jan 23 12:50:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks. It's for a short story btw. I've been writing about how humanity tries to explore space, and ends up meddling with entities that are better left unknown. Mankind named this species "" Servok"" because of the guttural sound they make just before they attack. It's the year 2085, 30 years after Servok has invaded us. They took out the most dense populated cities in the world, leaving governments to crumble under the suffering of their people. But one continent has some life in it. Europe lays in utter destruction, only with a few communities breathing, scattered across the Carpathians, Crimean and the Apennines mountains. They have taken refuge in the wilderness, coming back to where they started. Deep caves are their only escape from the fierce extraterrestrials, that only seek to end human race. It's a story told from the perspective of the Servok, and their goal to find a habitable planet, after wrecking their old one through countless wars among themselves."
ambientmusic,2t9yvk,Psychedelicool,2,Fri Jan 23 13:08:46 2015 UTC,"Wow, fuck. Id like to read the whole story when its complete."
