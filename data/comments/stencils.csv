stencils,3dpils,SparklingGenitals,2,Sun Jul 19 23:15:01 2015 UTC,"For fuzzy edges you can pick up some low-tax spray adhesive to put on the bottom of your stencil to help it adhere to the paper you're spraying it on. You can also weight down the edges with something. And when you spray, go from the outside-in so that the aerosol doesn't blow up the stencil and spread some paint underneath.

stencils,3dm7ii,SeaGooseberry,2,Sat Jul 18 06:37:13 2015 UTC,"The last method I tried didn't even use Posterize, but I like that this way can really emphasize or de-emphasize individual colors instead of being stuck with whatever shades the original picture offers. This would be great if one color layer isn't prominent enough.  I also really liked the idea of darkening the outside borders. Next time I may try it to wrap more black around the stencil as a way of narrowing the focus on the main object. Plus the whole thing will no longer look so square."
stencils,3dm7ii,SparklingGenitals,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:02:20 2015 UTC,I know exactly what you mean. I don't usually use Posterize. It is one of the few things that i try when playing with an image.

Otherwise I've used file folders that attached the material more by pressing them together, so you wouldn't have to punch any holes in your work.  The smaller ones maybe I'd put in one of those plastic file protectors and then tape the opening shut so it doesn't fall out.  I'd also be tempted to print out a table of contents for everything you've got and then number each one so that you can get to them easier.

stencils,3d9v8e,insert_deep_username,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:30:31 2015 UTC,Oh was it expensive? I wouldn't use it (cutting stencils helps with my anxiety) but that's interesting. Is it made specifically for stencil art?
stencils,3d9v8e,insert_deep_username,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:42:12 2015 UTC,Oh i cut the layers. I wanted very small holes evenly spaced over the entire image. I found it on line for $20. The problem with trying to cut those holes would be consistency. I sprayed all 4 layers and then laid the metal over it and sprayed the dots. just and after effect on the piece. All the layers were done with an x-acto knife on the floor. haha my next vision is to lay the stencils over the metal plate. That way only the dots appear for all layers. It will be interesting to see how it turns out.
stencils,3d9v8e,insert_deep_username,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:58:49 2015 UTC,Aha yeah I understood the overlay was the only not hand cut part. How large is the piece? How do you cut large atencils and what material do you use? I don't need huge stencils cause I do shirt bleaching and painting so I just get curious.   Oo that actually sounds really interesting! If you do it let me know I too want to see how that would work. I might just have to spend a day cutting my own little version and try it myself. XD

I was about to question your 3 layers, as it looks like there's 2 shades of blue and red under the white, but I realise now you've sprayed each layer with two colours. Smart. :)  And I don't mean to be nit-picky, but would it not have been possible to try to fake the lower part of the mane? I know when I find a good reference photo with a part chopped off I try to recreate the missing part in Photoshop; it doesn't have to look like a spot on recreation as the image will be heavily altered to suit a stencil anyway, just a wee bit of rubber-stamping* and manual paint-brushing to finish the photo off.  *done at constantly different distances so that it doesn't look cloned from the part directly next to it"

stencils,3bt09e,treiz,3,Wed Jul 1 22:17:04 2015 UTC,What are your tips on spraying? I love and hate spray adhesive the lines are so crisp but it ruins my stencil and sometime leaves residue
stencils,3bt09e,lukexcameron,2,Thu Jul 2 00:17:32 2015 UTC,"ruins my stencil    Are you using regular card stock for your stencils? I switched to using Duralar a while back and that material works a lot better with spray adhesive, and it's a lot easier to cut."
stencils,3bt09e,blinnlambert,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:51:24 2015 UTC,"i'm a big fan of spray adhesive also but i haven't been using it very much lately. i think you're going to use it you have to go very light with it, like seriously one pass across the stencil. another thing i do sometimes is spray each layer before the previous one is completely dried. then you can use the tackiness of the paint to hold the stencil in place. this is obviously risky because it can and has pulled up paint with the stencil. i do most of my stencils out of regular paper so i very rarely use any of them more than once. this one i actually did do two copies and relied on using weights to hold everything down like you see a lot of people doing lately. it works ok, i definitely think it could be better and i'm always trying to find some other way to do it"
stencils,3bt09e,lukexcameron,2,Thu Jul 2 22:40:32 2015 UTC,I was thinking about buying sinkers for fishing lines and use thoes because they are lead and small
stencils,3bt09e,Liz_zarro,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:50:48 2015 UTC,"I've been using sinkers for a little while now and am thinking about going with something else. I've been using those little cone shaped ones. They're good in the fact that they don't have a large footprint and are relatively easy to pick up without mucking up your sprayed area, but they kind of suck when all of the weight is concentrated at that one point (the little ones don't work well/topple and roll) and you need a bunch of them over a small area.   I'm going to try building some of /u/Jesusismycurseword's spider weights sometime soon and see if mixing them up with adhesive and sinkers will make for a good mix."

The software I bought years ago for $29 which still has a plugin for the Expression. The developer was sued by ProvoCraft and had to remove the plugin. The blades run about $2.50 apiece and can usually cut about 10 or so layers before they're kaput (sometimes more sometimes less).

In these paintings the elephant and the wings were separate. The elephant I sprayed as usual (black,dark grey,light grey,white) and for the wings instead of the dark grey and light grey I just went with different colors. As long as the colours that you use instead of dark grey are darker, and the colors instead of light grey are lighter you can pretty much do what ever you want and it will still look balanced. :) as for shading you just gotta go for it and keep practising until you more or less get the idea. :)"

stencils,3ak3a4,Here_for_beers,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:47:14 2015 UTC,"Nicely done! I wish my first stencil would have been half as decent.   One question, for the bottom left piece, did you first paint the red background, lay your stencil, and then spray black?   If so, it may have been easier to do it ""backwards"" because of all the islands you had. Basically paint a black background, lay your stencil and then spray the red pieces. Your stencil would essentially be a cutout of the black portion."
stencils,3ak3a4,_thisisnotart,2,Sun Jun 21 00:11:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! So, I first painted the background red, then black, and finally, the red within the helmet, which, admittedly, took a little more work than I thought. Next time I'll definitely have to try your method."

Option 2: You could bring your layers down to Kinko's or similar copy shop and see what it would be to size it up there. Or tile using poster sized sheets.   Option 3: Get a projector, preferably one that's used and pretty cheap, and use it to throw your image onto a large surface and from there you can copy it over to posterboards and cut them out that way. IMO this is the best option.   I doubt this is an exhaustive list but they're the easiest ways I can think of to cut big stencils."
stencils,3aei4v,Liz_zarro,2,Fri Jun 19 19:07:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with Liz_zarro above.  For the projector, you should use the newer digital projectors.  Also, touch base with a local sign shop.  They may be able to print large scale films for you, maybe even drop out your cuts.  You could also hand cut large Mylar sheets, which come in a roll.  The Mylar can cost several hundred bucks per roll, but sometimes it's a nice option."

stencils,3adsj7,ldudew,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:47:30 2015 UTC,"I would go with the airbrush.  First because I would use waterbased paint for your kids room. There are waterbased spraycans but I have no experience with them (http://www.montanacolors.com/webapp/spray?id=560)  Second because an airbrush is smaller, say you have to get a some tight corners, the chances you mess up with a can are much greater.  Third, colour blending. You can basically mess around with some airbrush paint until you have the perfect colour. Using cans would mean that you are restricted to what waterbased (really don't use anything else indoors) paints you can find.  Spraycans would mean the process to be faster though.  If you have any specific questions about what kind of airbrush etc just ask."

This is especially helpful when dealing with blacks that have slightly different finishes (matte vs stain vs gloss) and you want them to appear the same finish. If that is not an option you can always respray....

I don't hand paint anything else except to fill in details that are too small to cut.  Paint in the picture is just Rustoleum paints with two thick layers of satin clear coat on top of everything. I don't have the money to splurge on really good paint and I absolutely avoid Krylon, period."

stencils,3a0rvf,ahhdean3,2,Thu Jun 18 19:11:15 2015 UTC,It's pretty much trial and error. This is the first painting I've had come out clean. There are a couple dozen various paintings around my house that are all messed up in different ways. There are a ton of great people here at /r/stencils that have given me a lot of great advice either directly as feedback or indirectly through their own experiences. I'm definitely no expert but I'm getting just a little bit better each time. :)

Click the CMYK radio button, then click on the Black tab. Change the ""Spot Function"" to Line and choose whatever angle you'd like those lines to be at.

My frustration is mainly due to  the creative process associated with stenciling. I feel that every time I use technology to aid me that it strips away the ""art"" from the stencil. My creative process starts with an idea/message and I start by trying to find original photos and altering them to fit that message but often I feel too confined with whats available. I grew up on the likes of Lucian Freud and Henri Matisse and I have always inspired to be an artist like them. However with stenciling I am beginning to spend more and more time on the computer trying to find the right picture or the right idea than actually doing the art. Nevertheless I really like original graffiti artists and I was wondering if there is any tips to make stencils less technology depended and more original?"

stencils,36pdq8,lolwtfthisshitscrazy,3,Thu May 21 01:46:13 2015 UTC,"I make my own stronger material. First go buy some card stock, pretty cheap, and print on that. Then take some cheap clear packing tape and cover the stencil front and back in it. It turns your printed image into a hard sheet of plastic you can cut on."
stencils,36pdq8,LawfulEvil_DM,1 point,Thu May 21 17:49:33 2015 UTC,"For me, it depends on how complicated the stencil is. If it's a detailed or multi-layered stencil I will cut it out of regular paper and spray it on to the stencil material and then cut that out. It's time consuming, but it works well for me. If it's a simpler stencil I usually just draw straight on whatever I'm using for the stencil material. Sometimes I use plastic sheets for the stencil and in that case I will just put the plastic over my drawing and trace it."
stencils,36pdq8,_nouserforaname,1 point,Thu May 21 02:24:31 2015 UTC,I cut it out on the printer paper and then trace it over to the more durable paper. It does take a lot longer though
stencils,36pdq8,PM_ME_YOUR_KROKODIL,1 point,Thu May 21 02:27:03 2015 UTC,Instead of tape get some spray adhesive and glue the paper to some thin posterboard.

stencils,36g0ip,qwertyslayer,4,Tue May 19 13:49:06 2015 UTC,"It went a lot smoother than i thought it would. It looks much more intricate than it actually is. Having the two colors ontop of each other makes it look much more tricky. The red was the hardest part. With the thin lines, laying down the layer and managing the overspray was the most difficult part."
stencils,36g0ip,avaryvox,3,Tue May 19 14:03:56 2015 UTC,Use adhesive spray for the red?
stencils,36g0ip,PM_ME_YOUR_KROKODIL,4,Tue May 19 14:12:03 2015 UTC,"Yea, i use adhesive most of the time. I DESTROYED the red stencil pulling it up after spraying. It was bad. I was going for a crisp look on this one so i used Scotch 77 on all the layers."

stencils,36f3ml,jambuoy,6,Mon May 18 22:06:51 2015 UTC,"Four layers and you still have obvious bridges that could easily be fixed. You could have done this in several ways, which you should keep in mind for your next project.    Revisit the basics of how to make bridges. Instead of relying on lines every X inches, look for natural locations to make bridges. A perfect example here is the moustache. You could easily bridge around the shape of the moustache, but instead you have a bridge on his chin. You could bridge around the shape of the foreground shoe, but instead you bridge through the toe and the sole. There are so many bridges that are just...bad decisions. What are you stenciling with that needs so many? Tissue paper? You already did silver as a layer, so why not do it after black so you don't need to bridge those sleeves at all? You could eliminate about 50% of your bridges by doing that.  Drop silver as a layer, since it's barely visible anyway, and dedicate two layers to black. Overlap wherever necessary so you can create a seamless image.    It's a good start, but it looks more like a proof of concept to me and a learning experience towards better things. Keep it at it, though, because you're on the right track."

stencils,36gqol,oVerde,3,Tue May 19 13:58:32 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you're painting.  Spray adhesive is great, but requires skill in it's own respect to use, as the adhesive will eventually build up in layers on your canvas.  If there's too much, it can peel off the paint while you're using your next stencil.  I have 2 altoids containers full of change that I usually use instead, I just weigh down ever single edge with some coins, which is very surprisingly effective, and save spray adhesive for the thin areas where a coin would be too big to help."

stencils,36gqol,WalterMelons,2,Tue May 19 13:41:49 2015 UTC,"I sometimes cut out a square near certain areas that I DONT want painted and then use masking tape to cover it when i lay it onto the canvas. Then the tape sticks onto the canvas and helps hold it down in certain areas.  Then as others, random metal bits for weights and if necessary a glove to hold down certain parts as I spray"
stencils,36gqol,_thisisnotart,1 point,Sun May 24 07:03:36 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what you are spraying and what material your stencil is cut from. If you are spraying something not very intricate weights work very well. Change, go to Home Depot and find washers and nuts or different sizes, rocks, almost anything will work. If you are using heavier paper this will work for more intricate layers as well. I use plain printer paper and if i am doing anything with a lot of small cuts i use spray adhesive. Using adhesive is tricky. Think of how much you need, cut that in half, and then as you get ready to spray it use a half of what you already cut in half. You don't need much and you will need less as the layers go down. One tip i recently learned, is once the paint is DRY. you can use a damp cloth or paper towel to remove access adhesive that has built up. Be careful and use a test section if you can. That is my experience, yours will probably vary. I am not an expert. There are much more qualified people on here than I am to give advice."
stencils,36gqol,Wing_Nut74,1 point,Tue May 19 16:57:52 2015 UTC,"Go to hardware store and buy a cheapo bit/driver set (Phillips, flat heads, torx, etc.) for a screw gun. You can get the cheap Chinese stuff for $2. Comes with dozens of them. They lay flat, don't role and weigh quite a bit for their size (steel). I bought 2 sets for $5, works wonders."
