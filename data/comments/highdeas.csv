Normal matter is predictable, but when it's alive then all bets go out the window for what you can expect from it.  A planet is a planet, a dumb and boring lump of stuff.  But if there's life on it then soon enough it'll produce completely unexpected things like radio-waves and neutron radiation.  An outside observer will be all ""What?  i know of no physical process which could possibly account for that amount of those types of radiation on it's own.  How is the matter on the planet doing that?  THAT'S SOME WEIRD-ASS MATTER"". Then they'll come to our planet, fully expecting to find some exotic new form of matter, they'll have new empty boxes on their periodic table ready to fill with whatever this weird shit is on our planet.

highdeas,3dkrqx,read_harder,7,Fri Jul 17 01:51:18 2015 UTC,"I'm high so I hope this makes sense.  But a good example of a historical precedent that illustrates your idea is in driving styles in 1st World vs newly developing countries. This one goes back in time a bit.  So right now, in the US driving is very orderly. Overwhelming majority of the time, people obey speed limits, stay in lanes, obey lights, and other laws, etc etc. Whereas in countries like India and China, in many regions and even cities, traffic is often a free-for all with nearly no observable order.  I believe the difference is that in the US today, we have had cars for more than 1 generation. That means that we've all grown up seeing cars and how they're used. The rules and practices of driving are now an embedded part of our culture.   Not so in the developing countries. These people are 'foreigners' to a driving culture.  They don't have the cultural knowledge yet. Though it can be observed in the more densely urban cities, which have had traffic for sufficiently long, that more law and order on the roads is becoming common place.  SO.  For adults now with touch-devices, we're the foreigners. We don't have the embedded cultural learning of how to interact with pads. So we manage to operate them, but we have no intuition of habits, means of protocol, or pressures/speeds which would increase our efficiency.   But like ourselves in the US with cars, so are our children accessing touch screens at infancy. They'll grow up with the proper intuition in place."

It was meant as mercy, but it's hell. She just damned this woman to an eternity of falling asleep, watching all hope fading away yet never disappearing.  Okay, so there are two medicines working in tandem, right? One is to put you asleep, but the manufacturer has kept it top-secret that without the second drug you never jump to the next state of dreaming, so it causes some brain-scrambling from repeated nights without complete sleep? And the doctor is trying to give her patient an endless void, but of course the drug doesn't allow it, and that's why she breaks into the psych ward's high-security medicines (it's not played for comedy or for flipping-through lasers, she's abusing her power as a doctor and the HEAD of the institution -- opposed all along the way by another doctor who is gunning for the top -- and not just her career, but now her freedom are likely forfeit. We will not learn her fate, obviously, but she has committed murder (and broken a fuckton of Federal drug laws).  I WANT TO MAKE THIS MOVIE"

He's got the pop factor, but if you listen to all the hits he wrote which reached the top 100 Billboard since the 90s he has a very distinct writing style/sound, even his most recent work with Katy Perry/Ariana Grande. They are different to the ones that he has released with Taylor, whereas if you listen to her discography from pre 1989 from her previous albums you can see her songwriting style and choice of lyrics. The songs she has written are mainly hers with editing from co-writers. Max Martin has amazing song sense, but I think in this case he is mainly producing.

highdeas,3buays,TooManyTabs,2,Thu Jul 2 09:08:56 2015 UTC,"From what I've read regarding the Greek mysteries and related philosophies, which is the closest we'll get to very ancient teachings from the Ptolemaic Egyptian era, they'd still consider the mind the seat of consciousness.   But it gets deeper.  The mind is an instrument of the heart whose will ultimately controls our body. Think of it like a car. Your heart (will) is the engine that uses your mind to steer your body. They consider will to be at a higher 'level' than the mind, which they associate with lower level instinctual behaviour.   For example self-control is seen as a proof of will acting above the lower level of animalistic mind.  The mind is also associated as the seat of the soul since all seven bridges of awareness emanate from it (eyes, ears, nose, mouth)."

Think about it - in a society not based in capitalism, this platform could serve the purpose of many things and within capitalism, it'd still improve the efficiency of dating, probably leading to less unsuccessful relationships and less time within them. I think you're putting too much emphasis that people won't consider your profile without being A++ at sex; some might like that and not everyone's looking for an attractive partner now. With this service, you could be fairly sure that you aren't wasting your time to find out someone gives you unsatisfying sex and if sex is that important to you, the dating system we have now won't fix that.  Facebook requires you to use your real name and picture, but that doesn't stop you from using whatever name and a picture mocking the idea and guess what? That apparent personality will attract like-minded people and deter people you'd likely find insufferable anyway. I'm literally not seeing how your scenario would do anything but help society unless you're of the crowd that thinks sex should remain untalked about."

From there, it would still need to escape the gravity wells of Earth, Jupiter and the Sun, as falling into any of those will certainly result in the sperm burning away in atmosphere.  Now, embed a whole lot of sperm in a stable, frozen environment like maybe the center of an ice asteroid, then chuck that somewhere, and you maybe, maybe have a chance of getting a viable sample on the soil of another planet.

highdeas,392qe2,ripsonofficial,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:09:52 2015 UTC,It has all that information and can reliably respond to queries about it. The next step is to make it smaller and more efficient. It's already smarter and has a quicker response time than a human now imagine that much knowledge available to everyone. If it ever because cheap to mass produce stuff like this knowledge would be even easier to come by which is saying a lot because of how accessible things are on the internet

highdeas,390a1j,AMillionAKiss,2,Mon Jun 8 08:43:54 2015 UTC,"I might be incorrect, how i would explain it is that all elements have a certain way of bonding, by ""giving off and attracting"" the electrons. In ionic bonds (metals and non-metals) , metals give off their electrons and non-metals attract these electrons to bond. The group it is in on the periodic table , is the amount of valence electrons in the outer most energy level. Each energy level can hold 8 electrons(except the firt energy level which can hold only 2 ) so think of a atom as a kid , and electrons as sweets, if he has 8 sweets in his pocket he feels like royalty, every one wants to be royalty! So if 2 children want to be friends they share candy! Okay so normal table salt is NaCl ,, natrium being the metal and the chloride being the non-metal. Na has 1 electron in its last energy level, so 9 sweets in that pocket, he then gives one sweet to his Cl friend, so Na feels like royalty,, Cl has 7 plus the one he got , thus becoming ""royalty"" . And that is some basic chemistry. I have heard of spontaneous combustion , but i have no idea how that works. But question about the binary code is mostly to do with electrons.  I only have 16 year old chemistry , so it might well be very basic."
highdeas,390a1j,Autoxbot,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:50:55 2015 UTC,"My question is: if the Electrons in the Atoms are what Repel each other ( thus allowing objects to ""collide"") .. Then: What keeps a ""Whole-Complete-Object"" from repelling ""itself"" into some sort of spontaneous combustion? Is there some sort of Atom-Binary-Code that tells another atom to Turn+ or -?"
highdeas,390a1j,TheBearProphet,2,Mon Jun 8 08:51:52 2015 UTC,"It depends on the object in question.  There are several types of chemical bonds that keep things from flying apart.  In a molocule, electrons are shared between the individual atoms.  Think about a bunch of kids playing catch with 1 or more balls.  None of them are touching each other, and they are all sharing the ball(s.)  The kids are like the nuclei (spelling?) and the balls are like the electrons.  That's kind of what a molocule is like.  Now molocules stick to each other in different ways, only one of which I can really explain even remotely well. H2O, either as water, or as ice, is polarized, like a magnet. That's because of the three ""kids playing catch"" the H kid has a ball more often then the O kids.  (imagine you were playing catch with two kids, with two balls.  They never throw to each other, just to you.  You would have a ball about twice the time that they would.)  So with more ball time, you get more negative charge.  Just like a magnet, the negative charge from the H attracts Os from other H2Os (because the Os are positively charged from their reduced time with ""the ball"")  And that's why water sticks together a little, or when it gets cold enough, crystalizes into Ice the way it does.  My high school chemistry is failing me for how non-polar bonding works, but it does somehow.  The fun thing is when they try to work together.  Oil, for example, is non polar.  That is one of the reasons that oil will not dissolve in water.  For that you need an ""adapter"" of some kind.  The most common example is soap!  If you get oil on your hands, and try to just rinse it off, it will take a very long time, because the oil doesn't want to play with the water.  Soap though, is half polar and half non polar (I'm sure that is an over simplification, but it works in this context.)  The polar half plays with the water, and the non-polar half plays with the oil, allowing them to mix and get all that oil off your hands.  Science!"

highdeas,38zejc,Pyractic,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:32:02 2015 UTC,I could do with a good idea for pancakes. I'm tired of regular pancakes.
highdeas,38zejc,Meadslosh,3,Mon Jun 8 05:30:07 2015 UTC,"Make pancake batter, but double the eggs. Add a few handfuls of shredded cheese and a generous dash of whatever herbs and spices you like with cheese and eggs. Cilantro? Sure. Chili flakes? Go for it. Parsley? I won't judge you. Cumin? Boomin'. Green onion? You are forever welcome in my home.  My point is make it delicious for you. Cook 'em up just like regular pancakes, but you might need a little extra butter or oil in the pan on account of the cheese.  Stack 'em up and top 'em with srircha garlic lime mayo.  Or, just make regular pancakes and top 'em with:  ... with blackberries and a mix of honey and chili sauce.  ... a dollop of Greek yogurt mixed with peanut butter (and jelly, if you're so inclined).  ... mint jelly and chocolate sauce!"
