HelloInternet,3dv3jv,NickLeFunk,4,Sun Jul 19 20:40:47 2015 UTC,"There are three main types of sirens most ambulances around here use; T1 t2 and t3. T1 is the kind you stereotypically here with one rising and falling wail. T2 is a rapid yelp. T3 sounds like a weewoo. T1 can be heard the furthest t2 and t3 are used to draw attention to yourself at an intersection as other drivers often tune out t1 since it is often heard at a distance.  Of course this is a simplification, police and fire have different sirens. Also, other makes and models of ambulances have other types of sirens. My favorite of which sounds like an old fashion klaxon air raid warning."

HelloInternet,3dsz1w,Hamish-mckenzie,2,Sun Jul 19 04:00:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. The coffee mug was a reflex to unexpected pain. A blackout can be just as abrupt, but it doesn't cause pain (such as slamming your big toe into furniture in the middle of the night - Greys example).  He would probably hand write/edit a script. I imagine he would try to make the best of the situation by assuming since all he has is pen and paper, him and ""his brain"" would be stuck doing something productive. Like he explained in Cortex, walking around London with no tech devices."
HelloInternet,3dsz1w,Jolteon27,2,Sun Jul 19 13:49:31 2015 UTC,"I'm usually on Team Grey but that story rubbed me the wrong way.  I think the coffee cup story actually serves as a parable for why you shouldn't have habits so strong, because sometimes you need to be more flexible. I heat water in the microwave all the time, and I've learned how much time for each mug. If I'm using a strange mug or strange microwave, I start short and add time until its done. It's a system; I'm surprised Grey didn't have a system.  No one would sympathize with the story if he said ""And because I was using a different mug, when I tipped the carafe for the usual 5 seconds, it just poured all over my hand and arm because it didn't all fit in the smaller mug. And that's why everything should be exactly the same every day."""

HelloInternet,3dqbmp,cdca,9,Sat Jul 18 21:08:42 2015 UTC,"Agree. I also often find myself on Grey's side of things, and Brady's attitude feels kind of judgmental at times. Meh.  It's often like ""Oh you don't embrace this traditional irrational thought? Well you must be empty and sad then.""  I'm not saying Brady never has a point in these discussions, he just seems stubbornly confident in his views at times.  EDIT: Also, I feel like Brady and Grey perfectly represent the two sides of all those philosophical topics like the illusion of free will. (Grey representing the perfectly rational reasoning which sometimes leads to tough and burdensome repercussions, Brady refusing to accept these arguments because of their ramifications~~~~)"
HelloInternet,3dqbmp,thegubbl,8,Sat Jul 18 13:49:34 2015 UTC,"I think quite the opposite really. For me it seems like Grey is the judging one as he always has hard set opinions, which are not always justified. You say it is rational to believe in a deterministic universe, for example, but why? If it really was rational logicians would have deduced it and it would a fact, but it isn't. Also Grey agreeing that his meaning of determinism is one where we call probability deterministic isn't deterministic at all, the argument doesn't make sense- it is entirely irrational. The dice example that Grey gave isn't a good example at all as each trial is independent so I cannot determine anything about successive trials from previous trials - it is not deterministic. Brady on the other hand covered at least that often knowledge does add to beauty but he at least have a justifying example of where it certainty does not! That is the rational thing to do"
HelloInternet,3dqbmp,AlexGheorghiu,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:17:49 2015 UTC,"I think what he's trying to get at isn't that everything we do has been decided by the universe the moment we're born, it's just that if we knew every single aspect about how the brain worked, we would be able to predict to an extent exactly what it would do in certain situations, basically saying that we don't exactly make decisions, but that we are built in a way that ultimately gives us the code of how to perform or what to do based on the situation, while allowing for the brain to adapt and change as it goes along based on the situations it has already been through.  A good thing to look at based on advances in AI on this would actually be the popular game Alien: Isolation. Just take a look at this (The second and third paragraph). Although it seems as though it's making decisions based on the main protagonists' placement, it's really just following a complex set of coded instructions to attempt to both scare the player, and ultimately, win."

It's something I had to learn to do in art college because of the more technical departments (such as industrial design) collaborating with the more conceptual ones (illustration/graphic design). The difference in the language to explain for one group carries nuances that make it hard for the other to understand, or don't mean the same.   This seems to be their case.

Can the pilot or programmer be considered an explorer? That's more of a grey area. Are they exploring uncharted territory? Certainly. Is there a definition for ""explorer"" that goes beyond simply ""one who explores""? One that elicits an image of Indiana Jones or Christopher Columbus? Certainly. At its most rudimentary form, the operator of a Mars rover or the programmer of the New Horizon space probe is, definition, an explorer.

I was once working on the mosquito that spreads dengue, Ades aegyptii, for my masters. We found out that there had been a big  population expansion in Africa so many hundred thousand years ago and we checked what happened around that time, thinking there might be an end of a glaciation period or something. The date we had matched an early hominid migration or something. We all freaked out and started getting really excited, but then someone realised we'd used an older number for our mutation rate and the ACTUAL date of the expansion was a shift in glaciation period which is much more boring lol."

Another plus: Chaos Control is free, but Premium only costs $5 and will get you access to the webapp so you can use it from anywhere. I have encountered a bug or two, since it looks like it's maintained by a single developer, but support has been extremely responsive. All in all, it's by far the best GTD app I've found for Android, and it's ridiculously cheap considering apps like Any.do want to charge you $50 per year. It'll certainly save you a lot of time, money, and effort if it keeps you from having to buy hundreds of dollars worth of hardware and split your platforms between Android and iOS.

HelloInternet,3cyutx,TheVeryMask,3,Sun Jul 12 08:17:46 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Regarding the brag humble, I think the brag humble is still a thing, separate from a humble brag and what you described, but I think what you described is interesting and related to humble brag and brag humble. Here are you definitions I use (where I’m calling what you described a humbling brag):   Humble Brag: Bragging with a humbling element of self-deprication or complaint. (“I hate having to choose between my three sports cars every morning.”) Brag Humble: Using a brag to increase how humbling a situation was. (“Not only did I trip on my feet and make a fool of myself, I did it while walking across the stage to receive my Nobel Prize”) Humbling Brag: Bragging about something that is actually humbling, not brag-worthy. (“Look at this good deal I got on Bill Cosby DVDs”)"
HelloInternet,3cyutx,jasonl6,3,Sun Jul 12 02:21:37 2015 UTC,"I like it, but I still don't think that a ""Brag Humble"" as you describe it has the same elements as a humble brag.  In a humble brag, you're actually bragging, but you're hiding it in a humbling sentence.  There has to be a level of nuance or deceit in order for it to work.  That's why a reversal doesn't really work: there's no reason for anyone to make a brag which is actually intended to humble themselves.  This leaves us with only two options: either the ""humble brag"" has to come from another person who wishes the subject to be humbled, or the humbling portion of the brag has to be unintentional.    In some ways, then, a humble brag might have to come from someone else.  Let's say you are in a group and you say ""I left the club with the hottest girl in the whole place last night,"" and your friend says something like, ""Yeah, because she's your boss and hired you to be her driver.""  That might be a brag humble, because you were intending to brag, but intentionally left out details which turned your brag into something self-deprecating.  The other option, as I described above, would be for the brag to be unintentionally humbling in some way, humbling the speaker due to their ignorance or stupidity.  Another type of statement I've been thinking about is when you say something that, on the surface, sounds like a compliment, but is in fact intended to humble or demean another person (i.e. ""Tim is such a hard worker!  He worked so hard on this report! He stayed up all night and has over 400 pages of data! It's really a shame that he wasn't paying attention, misunderstood the assignment, and all his hard work had to be thrown in the bin!).  This might be described as a brag-humble about another person, but is essentially the same thing as a ""back-handed compliment,"" so I'm not sure we need a new word.  Again, the problem I have with any of these brag-humble definitions is that they lose the element of deceit or misdirection that a ""humble brag"" has, where the speaker appears to be doing one thing, but is actually doing the opposite.    Not that I've spent much time thinking about this or anything."
HelloInternet,3cyutx,jasonl6,3,Sun Jul 12 03:18:45 2015 UTC,"You’re right, the humble brag incorporates some deceit, whereas the brag humble doesn’t really do that. If we define a humble brag as a brag hidden within a humbling statement, then the direct opposite of that should be a humbling statement hidden within a brag. I can’t hink of a scenario where that would happen. If I want to tell the humbling statement, why would I hide it in a brag, and if I don’t want to tell the humbling statement, why would I include it in the brag at all (humble brag not withstanding).  Arguably, there is still a difference between a humble brag and a brag humble (according to the HI definitions). The difference is in the intent. In a humble brag, the main intent is to brag, whereas in a brag humble, the main intent is to tell a humbling story. They are distinct things, though not opposites, and the distinction can only be made by knowing the intent of the author/speaker (i.e. you need more than just the story to distinguish the two).  Thus we can propose new definitions that do make the humble brag and brag humble opposites: A humble brag is being humble with the intent of bragging, whereas a brag humble is bragging with the intent of being humble. Whether or not the last is actually possible.  I like your idea of the humbling portion of the brag being unintentional. This is essentially the Bill Cosby example. Notice that there is deceit involved with this; it is just a case of the bragger being uninformed or misinformed, or as you put it, ignorant or stupid. This is similar to the hallow brag, which (if I remember correctly) is something that seems bragworthy but really isn’t.  Regarding your hottest girl in the club example. I wouldn’t call this a humble brag / brag humble either, as there is no intention or attempt to be humbling (by the bragger). This is related to the hallow brag, except in this case the bragger is intentionally portraying something that is not bragworthy as a brag. I would call this a false brag or something similar.  And no, we are definitely not spending too much time thinking about / discussing this."

At the very least, I think it might be impossible for Brady to ""brag humble"" because he's trying to take credit for inventing the term. Timeline of any ""brag humble"" attempt by Brady:   Brady tells a story meant to put him in a good light (brag) The story has a twist, so it makes him look bad (humble) Brady tries to convince CGP that he successfully brag-humbled, and isn't it a great term, and isn't he great for thinking of it (brag)   The effect of just 1 and 2 might be a brag-humble, leaving him overall humbled, but when he brings on #3, it's right back to #humblebrag, or a humble sandwich on brag bread."

Just a couple things to remember: You (rightly) believe that all human decisions and actions are the result of chemical reactions in the brain, which in turn have been dictated by genetics and past experiences.  However, you also state that you are intentionally trying to ""tame"" your emotions.  I would point out, then, that your emotions themselves, as well as your inclination to follow them, are ALSO simply chemical reactions in your brain dictated by genetics and experience.  I too have felt that deep tendency to place logic over emotion, but I have come to realize that they are both products of the same evolutionary stepladder that brought our species to where it is today, and both (logic and emotion) are equally susceptible to fallacy.  Like I said, I like where you're coming from, just keep these things in mind as you venture on this philosophical path."

BUT In a discussion about the growing number of listeners, Grey and Brady came to the conclusion that simply as a matter of probability, with sooo many people listening to the podcast, it wasn't unlikely for, at any moment, someone to be listening to Hello Internet while waiting to board a plane/flying on a plane. This is funny because of the large  amount of time spent talking about plane crashes on the podcast.   Working off this point, Grey addressed the listeners directly, saying something to the effect of ""enjoy this talk about plane crashes as you wait for your plane... Tim.""  Since then, ""Tim"" is pretty regularly mentioned when the conversation steers towards the realm of what are individual people doing right now as they listen to the podcast  It's just a gag, you see."

Basically life is a chain reaction of experiences (and brain chemistry) shaping future experiences (brain chemistry). If no variables change then you could have, theoretically, infinite attempts at the same event and the results would be the same. I don't necessarily believe all that though.

As that applies to humans, then yes, it means that if we could map all your neurons, and know how neurons work perfectly, and know what input you receive, we would be able to predict perfectly how you would respond.  So people are deterministic, because the universe is, and we aren't special - though that doesn't diminish or change our subjective experiences of choice, love, etc."

That is, if a someone's choice of action is determined, then it is the confluence of your anatomy, your experience, and physical considerations that makes the decision.  If there is something about your decision process that is not part of this, then you have free will.  Quantum mechanics does not impinge upon the point that Grey was discussing.  If, physically, the choice between two of his actions were to come about because of some random fluctuation in a physical observable, that would still not imply that it was Grey's will that determined that action, but rather just another law of physics, although it might be a probabilistic one.  What I heard Grey say in the podcast was not necessarily mechanistic when taken as a whole."

HelloInternet,3cnnyf,protoUbermensch,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:28:57 2015 UTC,Must remember to proof read.
HelloInternet,3cnnyf,Choisai,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:19:07 2015 UTC,"There's something about Grey's ideas that is just plain wrong, and he as a former physics teacher should know about this. His point is that humans are deterministic. But that is not true.  The universe is not deterministic. Quantum mechanics only talk about statistics and probability, not of certainties. For example, you don't know for sure whether or not you will find an electron at a certain point. But you do know the probability that you will find an electron there. Summing all these probabilities averages out these quantum effects, and may make it seem as if the universe is deterministic, but it is not.   A simple analogy to quantum mechanics on our visible scale is Newtons and Einsteins view of dynamics. Newton's laws are a pretty good description of dynamics, but they are still wrong, even though they are a good approximation if you're just looking at the right scale of things. But for the real description of dynamics you need Einsteins equations, not Newtons. If you were to stretch Einsteins equations and go to the case in which your velocities are very slow compared to the speed of light, and if you take away the .000000 something numbers you just end up with Newtons equations. But just because Newton's equations are a good approximation, doesn't mean they're right. They're not. They are intrinsically wrong.  Hell you could apply it to other fields as well. Geometrical optics is a handy way of describing light. But for an accurate description of light you need quantum electrodynamics.  So if the universe isn't deterministic, it isn't deterministic on our scale either.  This isn't some esoteric spiritual conclusion, or mind-blowing fact. You can logically deduce very easily that if the universe isn't deterministic, humans aren't deterministic either.  Proof 1: Humans are part of this universe, and the universe is not deterministic, humans can't be deterministic. Because if they were, They could interact with the universe in a way that is literally supernatural. Since magic and the supernatural isn't possible, deterministic humans aren't possible either.  Proof 2: Humans are build up of the same matter of the universe, although humans are a very special configuration of the various particles and atoms and molecules and so forth that make us who we are. And since these particles are no different from the universe, we are no different from the rest of the universe except for our configuration. If the universe isn't deterministic, then we aren't either.   Both of these proofs are self-evident, and I hope all of you people will agree with me. There is no 'pixie dust' involved in this, only statistics (which, if you're an undergraduate, might seem at times to be magical).  So even if humans may seem to appear deterministic, and you could describe them with more or less deterministic equations, you are still wrong - humans aren't deterministic, now matter how much it may appear that way.   But who's to say we can approximate human beings as deterministic, just like we can approximate dynamics with Newton? Neurons are typically in the micrometre size, and synapses are around a few 100 nm. When you're down at that size, quantum mechanics does play a significant role. And if quantum mechanics plays a role at such a key level, it's wrong to say that humans are deterministic. We can approximate humans, but they are not deterministic.  Note that I'm not saying that humans have free will, that's not a given or follows from what I just said. Just because the universe and humans aren't deterministic, that doesn't automatically mean we have free will. But Grey said we are deterministic - and that, we are not."
HelloInternet,3cnnyf,Geraldvonsuckerpants,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:20:38 2015 UTC,I disagree. Are you basically saying we can not know all the inputs to the system therefore you can not accurately predict the decisions a person will make?
HelloInternet,3cnnyf,Choisai,2,Thu Jul 9 22:55:17 2015 UTC,"You cannot know everything per definition. You can more or less predict somebody's words they are going to speak, or the direction they are going to run to, but human brains are not literally analogous to computer, for the reasons I just said.  Now the obvious thing would be to point out the same thing to computers: we don't know everything about the quantum states of each electron going through the transistors, and yet we know exactly how a computer is going to behave.  But there's a problem of scale here. An ordinary transistor is nowadays less than 100 nm, typically around 50 nm or so. So by the same logic, wouldn't it be true to say that computers aren't deterministic either?   While those are valid points to raise, it's important to get clear on what we are talking about, and that there is a difference here. Grey said there was no option open for free will, because humans were deterministic. But if humans are not deterministic, than that leaves the door open for something we call free will.   Grey could then argue that the same thing can be said of computers: for can't we just substitute humans with computers, and since both are subject to a non-deterministic universe, neither is deterministic? And that so if we would look in non-determinism for free will, couldn't we then say the same thing of computers? Can't we say that computers have free will as well?  I think anyone would answer that last question with a hard no.  Computers don't have free will. But we might have free will.  So what is the difference between a person and a computer? Note that we have gone more or less in a circle: because we have free will, we are not computers. And we are not computers because we have free will.  So it's important to get clear here on what the exact difference is between people and computers. The subject of free will is the obvious point to raise, but there are other points as well. People for example, fulfill all kinds of functions: they have beliefs, they have desires, they have thoughts and so forth. Everything that makes a person a person is what you call in philosophy the P-function, short for person-function. So can we imagine a computer that is P-functioning?  Well, we currently don't have any examples of that. Some would raise the Google 'dream mode' as an example of a 'P-functioning' system that isn't a human, but once you get down to what it actually does you find it's not much more than a 'random' mode, or a 'scrambler'. Ofcourse you could say human dreams are more or less the same thing, but I won't pursue that any further. The important question to ask here is this: is there an undoubted case in which we can say that computers or machines are P-functioning?  The answer is yes, but we will have to look in science-fiction for it. The computer Hal from the movie 2001 Space Odyssey turns at one moment on the astronauts it's supposed to help. When someone goes to the mainframe to shut him down, Hal tells him that he's afraid. The computer Hal is afraid of dying. That sounds like a P-functioning body to most then.  Another example is Agent Smith in the Matrix Reloaded. After being destroyed by the One, Agent Smith, who was at one point in time a computer program that acted as a 'firewall' was no longer part of the system, and he had free will. At one point he even complaines to the One that he is angry, for the One had taken from him his purpose, his raison d'être. A computer program that is angry and wants to take revenge sounds science fictiony, but we can imagine it. And I don't think it's impossible to program either. So wouldn't it be fair to say that both Agent Smith and Hal are P-functioning bodies? Aren't they persons? What other than bias is stopping us from calling these computers persons? And if computers can be persons, isn't it fair to say that there is some principle of reversibility to this logic, so that we can say that humans are computers as well?  My answer to that is no, but I guess people would like to comment on what I just said before I go any further."

Computers don't have free will. But we might have free will.   You're making a circular argument. We might have free will. We might not, but think we do.  I would agree that computers don't (currently) have free will. I honestly don't know if I do. It feels like I do, but that isn't enough, as that feeling could arise from a deterministic system.  The issue is whether the universe is deterministic. Our current understanding of quantum mechanics say not. That doesn't mean our current understanding is totally correct.  If our universe is deterministic, we are predetermined (and all prison sentences are unjust!) One could then construct a machine with the same complexity as us that acts as if it had freewill, just as we act as if we do.   If the universe is not deterministic, then we are not predetermined. .... but it is conceivable that we could make a computer that is also not totally predetermined.  My feeling of freewill doesn't suggest, or preclude a nondeterministic universe. If we ever build a computer that appears to have freewill, it could be a complex but deterministic system, or true freewill. Already we are at the point that hardly anyone knows all the parts of a computer, what about systems that are designed by more primitive computers, that are evolved artificial systems?

But you ask if could know everything, wouldn't that mean that the universe is deterministic? The answer then is yes, but do note that knowing everything would be supernatural, since you are breaking laws of physics here.  But if you could know everything, then yes the universe, and so human beings, would be deterministic.  If our universe is deterministic, we are predetermined (and all prison sentences are unjust!)

Couple of notes on that: we are still at a level that there are people who knows entirely how computers work at all levels - these people are involved primarily in the lithography industry, and they are involved at most levels, so they know exactly how each individual component works.  But this isn't the case for e.g. airplanes. This isn't because it's impossible for someone to know everything about airplanes, but because it's not economically viable to have engineers that know everything. Similarly there isn't really any purpose to have people working on computers that are all IT experts, semiconductor scientists, programmers, lithographers, photonics experts etcetera.  While there are some people like that, they are becoming increasingly rare.   But I think we can agree on this - If the universe is deterministic, there is no free will. If the universe isn't deterministic, that doesn't automatically mean we have free will."

HelloInternet,3cp2dr,po8crg,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:23:04 2015 UTC,"Cargo ships are far more efficient at moving cargo.  Moving people is a much more complicated question.  If you travel by ship then it takes a lot longer.  There are basically zero flights that take require more than one night asleep.  This means that you can get away with people sleeping uncomfortably in the confined space of a reclined seat.  Just crossing the Atlantic - typically an eight-hour flight - is a six-day journey on a specialised passenger ship (a liner - the RMS Queen Mary II does a regular service across the Atlantic).  Acceptable accomodation for six days is going to require something equivalent to a hotel room, not an airline seat.  You're also going to need to be able to provide for passengers, which means transporting of food and drink, having tanks of fresh water or a way of desalinating the sea, and having storage tanks for used water which can then be disposed of at the end of the voyage (by transferring it into the local water treatment system at your destination port).  All of these take up more weight and volume.  All of this then implies staff - people to cook the food, maintain all the complex equipment, possibly provide entertainment, police unruly passengers, and so on.  And then you need to feed all of those staff and provide accomodation for them also.  There are far more staff on a liner per passenger than cabin crew on an aeroplane.  This doesn't need to be at the level of a cruise ship: liners had third class (or steerage) passengers back in the era before economy-class flight was widely available, and the facilities provided to them were far more basic than those provided to cruise passengers.  Cruise ships actually have higher CO2 emissions per passenger-km than flying, but some of that is due to over-specified facilities - in that the cruise ship is the destination, not a transport system.  A real liner wouldn't have that limitation, and should be somewhat more efficient than flying.  Mass transported would still be likely to be at least 10X flying, and more likely 20X - the standard CO2 efficiency figure for cargo is 50X for sea over air, so liners should be more efficient, but it's going to be pretty marginal.  Most cargo ships have better automation than was anticipated by the naval architects when they were designed, so they have spare cabins for crew that the architect anticpated needing but aren't actually required. Passengers on cargo ships generally travel in these cabins. So the ship doesn't need any additional facilities beyond those it is carrying around anyway. If demand rose significantly, then either cargo ships would be designed with additional passenger cabins at the expense of cargo space, or (more likely) true liners would start being built again.  Very short sea voyages go back to putting people in airline-style seating.  We tend to call these ""ferries"", and they're very CO2 efficient compared to flying for water crossings too wide for a fixed link to be an option.  The way to move people long distances with minimal CO2 emissions is to use electric trains and generate electricity using a zero-emission system.  Trains are also much faster than ships - in fact, modern high-speed trains are about one third the speed of an airliner (while planes can go faster, they have to go supersonic to do so, and the technical, economic and environmental problems of supersonic passenger flight are likely to make it prohibitive for the foreseeable future) - about 200mph on a train against 600mph on a plane.  While this isn't very useful for crossing oceans, it should be possible to cross continents in a few days: Gibraltar-Singapore would be about 100 hours.  Very long-distance trains have a lesser version of the problems the ships do of having to become effectively a moving hotel. It's not quite as bad, because you can easily stop partway to pick up consumables and dispose of waste, which isn't an option in the middle of the ocean, so the stocks of supplies required are much lower.  But you still need to provide decent sleeping compartments and separate daytime lounges.  The likely option for most (ie second-class) passengers is to have multiple separate daytime trains that each stop overnight, and you stay in a hotel every two to three thousand miles.  Making long distance trains that run overnight economic means running either European-style sleepers, which have no daytime accomodation and only run at night (no use for this kind of long-distance journey) or running all-first-class trains, like the Orient Express.  Of course, this doesn't solve the problems of trans-oceanic transport, but restricting flying to those few journeys that need to cross an ocean, with trains for overland transport and ferries for short sea-hops would mean that flights would be only used for crossing the Atlantic or Pacific, or for access to oceanic islands.  That would be one of the very few CO2 emittors that there isn't a substitute for - but the emissions from trans-oceanic flight would be low enough to be manageable."

I accept that Grey may be accepting a different axiom, but that matters. If there is nothing non-deterministic about humans, all of metaphysics are de facto invalid. On the other hand, if there is free will and thus what Grey calls ""magic"", then there is an area of human knowledge outside of empirical observation. That is a massive distinction and the reason Grey is ""unconvinced"" is because he's accepting something without evidence, which is required to have a discussion about things at a higher level. For example, handling serial killers is easier in Grey's worldview because they are a deterministic aberration and can be removed like a virus. To do anything else would necessitate accepting that there is something ""magical"" about humans that makes it bad to kill them."
HelloInternet,3cjfwe,sneagan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:19:44 2015 UTC,"Why would Grey's worldview make it more okay to kill serial killers?

There are many metaphysical concepts that are legitimate, like ""the future"" or ""subjectivity"".  Free will just isn't one of them.  It has no coherent meaning.  An act is either caused by something else, or it's random, by definition.  Free will is neither, so what is it?"
HelloInternet,3cjfwe,01as_,3,Fri Jul 10 07:26:31 2015 UTC,"The concept of responsibility is irrelevant if humans are deterministic I/O machines. No one is ""responsible"" for anything, meaning that no one's behavior is any better or worse than anyone else's no matter what actions they take. There is no better or worse action, because it's all simply the uncontrollable result of neurological stimuli. Technically, the serial killer and the person killing the serial killer are both beyond reproach the same way animals are for killing one another for food, dominance, or fun.  As far as what free will is, it's difficult to try to engage with someone who begins the conversation by dismissing the opposition as ridiculous outright, but I'll try. ;)   There are many metaphysical concepts that are legitimate, like ""the future"" or ""subjectivity"".   The future and subjectivity are not metaphysical concepts. They're logical constructs that aid communication.   It has no coherent meaning.   Free will has a very clear and very coherent meaning that hundreds of humans have written millions of pages about over thousands of years. I can't include all of that here, but I recommend reading some philosophical texts in defense of it for your own enrichment.   An act is either caused by something else, or it's random, by definition.   There is no uncaused action, even random ones. I'm not sure what causal definition you're using here. Free will is your ability to cause yourself to act, rather than being caused to act by neurons alone. It is the efficient cause of your actions and permits whole areas of dialogue that wouldn't exist otherwise (i.e. responsibility, blame, guilt, pride, etc.).   so what is it?   A critical human characteristic that is the linchpin of most philosophical dialogue and is dependent on the acceptance of an axiom, specifically, that some human behavior (not all of it) may not be predictable not because it is random, but because it is influenced by the will of the person which is itself unpredictable. The opposing axiom, that human behavior is completely deterministic and therefore predictable, is just as much of an unprovable axiom, but leaves us to languish in our brutishness at the mercy of stimuli like the basest animal. (added that last for emphasis :D)  I respect people who accept a different axiom from me and expect the same from them because we've both made a decision without the possibility of evidence and have built philosophies around it.

Just because the things that happen to us are random doesn't mean that our reaction to those things aren't deterministic.  Also, I think what you say only remains true if your frame of reference is an individual human. If you're looking at things happening to you on a person-level then everything seems random and there are events you can't predict. However, if you were looking it from the perspective of everything in the universe, then the things that happen to you are totally predictable given enough information.  Like Grey pointed out, just because the complexity involved in knowing and calculating those things is so high above what we're capable of doing, doesn't mean that it's magic. The interplay out all of our combined meat-computers is certainly an incredibly complex system, but if all of them are deterministic then it's just an ultra-complicated system full of super-complicated meat-computers.

HelloInternet,3cgydc,mogster3,3,Tue Jul 7 22:52:47 2015 UTC,"The issue of true universal humanlike AI is not that it is physically impossible, but that it's practically impossible. I agree that there is no magic to sentience and that anything, human minds included, can be represented mathematically. However that fact alone is not enough to say it's an inevitability. The limiting factor here is our ability (or lack-thereof) to glean information about how the brain works in the first place. We have to understand it before we can write code that mimics it.   Just like there is no magic to human thought, there is no magic to computers either. Computer code is math that was written by a person, it's not imbued with special powers simply because it is being run on a computer. That same math could be done by hand on paper. Computers can do it much, much faster, but that's it. It's  the same math, just faster.   Until humans come up with a mathematical formula sophisticated enough to convincingly mimic human intelligence, we cannot write computer programs that can convincingly mimic human intelligence. The two are one in the same. We'll have the computing power long before we have a formula that properly abstracts human thought. The exponential speed of technological advancement is relevant insofar as we will overtime have more advanced medical technology that can give us a better idea of how the human mind works. But still the hold up isn't the limitations of current day computing power, it is and always will be our current understanding of the brain itself.  Asserting that more computing power automatically means more sophisticated AI is akin to saying you could pull yourself up by your boot straps if only you were strong enough. We can't completely utilize that computing power to help us make the AI without the AI. Once we have it things will takeoff like a rocket, since it will be able to write better AI faster than we can. But that can't happen until we understand the brain well enough to replicate it in the first place, and I think we are massively underestimating just how complex human thought really is. It is not out of the question that it might be so complex that replicating it will be forever infeasible, despite being perfectly possible."

What if the human brain is the most efficient way of computing  for our kind of ""intelligence"" (general, self-aware, etc.)?   Then it doesn't matter if you can make a simulation, since it won't be faster than the original, it will be slow, or much slower. In your words, it won't be practical.  Don't take me wrong, such simulation would still be insightful, since we could make approximations once we fully understand it, and capture new behaviors, much the same way we can make scaled simulations of the universe to understand it, but it won't be the promised super-intelligence."

If I wasn't a religious person, I think I'd have to be completely on board with your thinking. Morality is also necessarily subjective from that frame of reference, just to add to the list of things that people struggle to accept but that are logically inescapable consequences of certain sets of assumptions.  But I do think Brady is quite right about mystery and ""magic"" being partly a loss. It's like how movies with bad physics aren't nearly as enjoyable as they would be if I hadn't done an undergraduate degree in it. Or how complex orchestral music somehow isn't as pleasurable since I can identify all the instruments, chord progressions etc. Or how knowing how a magic trick is done spoils the show to an extent.

HelloInternet,3cgydc,am10167-3797,3,Wed Jul 8 05:10:05 2015 UTC,"I have a undergraduate in philosophy and am attending grad school for philosophy this fall so I have to say something about the free will discussion.   One quick thing I want to mention is neither party (neither Grey nor Brady) really defined freedom. Some say action X is free if you did X but could have done otherwise. Others might say action X is free if you go through a deliberation and choice process psychologically. In fact Grey, you may have just defined freedom when talking about the illusion of choice. That illusion you mentioned may be a psychological process we must go through for the action to occur and thus is what we mean when we say an action is ""free"".   Compatibility arguments are many and often strong so do not assume you must either choose between libertarian freedom and causal determinism. Many philosophers do think that determinism is compatible with free will.   Also, I wouldn't so quickly say that it is inconsequential whether our actions are determined or not since this would (and should) affect our idea of moral praise and blame. Even if you think morality is an illusion our fundamental moral feelings still depend on whether someone can say an action they perform was by choice (exe. manslaughter v. Murder). In what way are computers responsible for things if people are? Are people even responsible? If we can define the parameters for what makes someone responsible for their actions will that give us an analysis of freewill?  These are all questions philosophers are interested in and a lot of ink has been spilt on them so I recommend doing some research and reading if you care to learn more.   I love the podcast! Thanks!   TLDR: Don't give up on the idea of freewill there is a lot of good philosophical literature on the topic."

However, there is social media that is basically a ""best-of"" reel of human emotions and interests that already exists and likely will only grow in the future.   Something happening out of the ordinary would produce a spike in social media with people sharing and resharing that particular event. A computer would clearly notice that unusual trend in the social stats and feed it into the copy. The same way media monitoring nowadays plays an important role for automated highspeed trading.   I've heard of people recording their heartbeat with an Apple Watch while watching a movie and then plotting it on a graph to show the excitement of a movie over time. Now imagine a stadium of people watching a sports event feeding their heartbeats to the Internet."
HelloInternet,3cgydc,_aex,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:51:01 2015 UTC,"I think the problem with robots writing music and the reason people will hear a difference listening to it is the context that you put the person into when telling them about the author. In the end this skews the person's perception of reality in a way that is real and important. They will hear the music differently than if you hadn't told them; it isn't a question of ""they think they're hearing it differently"", just as much as this video actually made me feel uncomfortable the first time I watched it; it wasn't that I thought it was.  So in the end, when you're writing music or finding a match for someone, the perception of the person you're doing it for is what matters most. You have to take into account the biases of that person based on what they know.  In the end I think that context really is one of the defining factors of feeling."

A robot wife would be too perfect, to a creepy degree. As humans we have littles faubles that humanise us (which a robot would not likely have) and over time we learn to accept, then become fond of our partner's little faubles.   Likewise, a robot would have no baggage and as much as we think we don't want baggage, we equally learn to accept it as a part of the other.  Vis-a-vis the perfect simulation of the human brain. There is I think a fourth wall type issue. By the time a human works out how to program in something new into the algorithm, there will be another thing to program in.   E.g. let’s take the example of the idiom ""the fourth wall"" how long does it take a human to understand the metaphor in the idiom vs. how long it takes a human to figure out how to teach a computer the same thing.   Another example is humour/comedy. How can you explain to a computer why a joke is funny if you yourself don't understand why you laughed a joke? Simpler things like puns or pull back and reveals are easy enough to be explained and coded but not so much stuff like timing related jokes or pop culture references and especially ""finish the joke in your own (audiences) head"" type jokes  Onto the free will issue. Tangential as it may be I think a good way to think about the semi-autonomy of your brain is envy/jealousy. Your brain knows exactly what info to feed itself (and what to omit) to achieve envy. I agree with Grey that a face is not objectively beautiful but there are traits that suggest better chance of survival (link to basic idea of Darwinian survival of the fittest…) such as being physically fit which the brain interprets as beautiful.   Me again, same deal  I also recently lose 2 relatives, so the bit about Brady's father in law struck a chord with me.   *for privacy sake I will leave out some personal details  The talk of paperwork  Final big question would you become a “post-human” (how you define that is up to you) if given the choice and under what conditions. For example, I would need some assurance of continued sole ownership and access of my thoughts i.e. nothing can implant thoughts into my mind and then make me think I thought them, and that any intellectual property I had or will have remains mine.

Lots of funny stories and unexpected takes on current events.)   -- Hardcore History (If you like history at all, this is a winner. They're more like mini-audiobooks than podcasts, but are also great example of how the genre of podcasts is unique. As great as they are, I doubt they would work under any other medium.)  -- Song Exploder (Musical artist take apart their recordings and talk about how decisions were made. Its great if you are a musical creator or interested in looking at how music is made.)  -- Everything Is Stories (A storytelling podcast, with each episode focusing on someone living an unconventional life. Well edited and crafted.)  -- The Mythology Podcast (A newer one that examines the tropes of mythology from a non-academic but still thorough perspective. I like it for the content as well as a reminder than anyone can make a podcast about what they are interested in. Though well made, it is definitely not professional.)"
HelloInternet,3cb9jc,Jakenbakesaid,3,Mon Jul 6 18:17:41 2015 UTC,"Hello Internet - I assume you are all familiar with this one.  We Have Concerns - Anthony Carboni (Dtoid/Rev3) and Jeff Cannata (TRS/DLC) host a twenty minute comedy/improv podcast centering around weird articles sent in by fans.  99% Invisible - A radio quality, story-driven podcast focusing on design and the impact it has on the world.  No Such Thing As A Fish - An offshoot of the British quiz program QI, the researchers (QI Elves) for all the facts mentioned on the show discuss their four favorite of the week with a humorous slant.  Roderick On The Line - John Roderick (The Long Winters) and Merlin Mann (43Folders) chat about their uniquely interesting lives.  Hypercritical - Now defunct, John Siracusa (Ars Technica) and Dan Benjamin (5by5) delve into the idiosyncrasies of programming, Apple, TV, Toasters, and much, much more.   Invisibilia - Similar in tone and structure to 99%  Invisible but the focus is on the mind and other intangible things.  The Flop House - Dan McCoy (The Daily Show), Elliot Kalan (The Daily Show), Stuart Wellington (Soon to be bar owner) and the Flop House House-Cat (Voiced by Stuart Wellington) are a rag-tag bunch of misfits watching bad movies and talking about them so we don't have to.  The Incomparable - Jason Snell (MacWorld) and many varied guests discuss nerdy topics ranging from Star Wars to Studio Ghibli.  The Poison Arrow w/ENB - Marcus (EpicNameBro/Youtube) voices his opinions on current videogame news and has a Games-related guest on in the second half.  Worst Idea Of All Time - New Zealand Comics, Tim Batt and Guy Montgomery, watch Grown Ups 2 fifty-two times and slowly make their way towards insanity with each viewing. Sex And The City 2 is next.  Decode DC - A political show about the systems themselves instead of espousing left or right wing ideologies.  I have many more, but this is a good representation."

During a secessio plebis, the plebs would simply abandon the city en masse and leave the patrician order to themselves. Therefore a secessio meant that all shops and workshops would shut down and commercial transactions would largely cease. This was an effective strategy in the Conflict of the Orders due to strength in numbers; plebeian citizens made up the vast majority of Rome's populace and produced most of its food and resources, while a patrician citizen was a member of the minority upper class, the equivalent of the landed gentry of later times. Authors report different numbers for how many secessions there were. Cary & Scullard state there were five between 494 BC and 287 BC.

HelloInternet,3c3orf,SynAckRoot,6,Sat Jul 4 13:39:22 2015 UTC,I enjoy the e-ink screen on the kindle. I think Grey's major problem was lack of adjustment options.
HelloInternet,3c3orf,FrequentlyHertz,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:59:56 2015 UTC,"And even with Grey's issue, couldn't you change it manually?"
HelloInternet,3c3orf,ado010,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:33:46 2015 UTC,No. I believe what he wants is a certain text alignment that isn't available through the options.
HelloInternet,3c3orf,FrequentlyHertz,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:03:46 2015 UTC,Right. You can change that manually in the setting files.
HelloInternet,3c3orf,ado010,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:08:20 2015 UTC,Isn't e-ink only on the first?
HelloInternet,3c3orf,NeodymiumDinosaur,0,Sat Jul 4 21:53:35 2015 UTC,I think it depends on the tier you buy. The kindle paperwhite isn't e ink. But the cheapest current model is.
HelloInternet,3c3orf,FrequentlyHertz,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:05:15 2015 UTC,"The Paperwhite definitely also uses e-ink, and I think the Voyage does as well."
HelloInternet,3c3orf,fissionablylate,2,Sun Jul 5 05:52:34 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, the kindle blows tablets out of the water when reading outside in strong light (no flare) and the battery life is absurd long. I use an old kindle 2 still. But, you are lugging around 1 device more."
HelloInternet,3c3orf,Naggy2k,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:02:41 2015 UTC,"Hardly. I mean if you have a bag then it doesn't really matter IMO. ""Lugging"" would be if it was a heavy device. It is pretty light."

HelloInternet,3bzeik,carolconfetti,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:27:43 2015 UTC,"I reckon he works a maximum of 30 hours a week. 5 hours for every day of the week. With meals, and 20 mins walks in between the 40min-1 hour bursts of work, he can only perceptibly get that much in a day. Plus, you have to take into account the fact that he doesn't work when he can't work AKA 2pm in the afternoon. So even if he works everyday, it probably only adds up to 30 hour weeks. That being said, he is much more efficient when he does work so the output is similar to or more than someone working 8 hours days."

HelloInternet,3bud75,j0nthegreat,2,Thu Jul 2 17:10:27 2015 UTC,"personally, i had a number of teachers that i thought did a very good job of engaging students. in high school, my physics teacher had one student bring in his guitar to help teach the class about vibration, frequency, etc. A history teacher took a student's suggestion to use the Billy Joel song ""we didn't start the fire"" to let students make groups and select a verse of the song to investigate each thing he mentions and teach the class why it's in the song. yeah, they taught you facts and tested you on being able to remember them, but they did also teach us how to think critically, and how to learn, and that learning is, indeed, fun.  maybe i got lucky by having a ton of great teachers but even with that experience i can still see Grey's point that not very student should be forced into the same requirements."

HelloInternet,3bomyz,nitrac,2,Wed Jul 15 22:56:59 2015 UTC,"Derek of Veritasium is very particular about how his channel name is pronounced, I believe they first mentioned him Episode #22: 16 Hour Search For Wallpaper They both accidentally stumbled on his name and thought that was funny because it would annoy him. Of course Brady continued this running joke from Derk from Verisassium, to the most common Dirk from Veristablium all the way to the most recent Duke from the Vatican.   TL;DR It’s an escalating inside joke that began from the funny accidental mispronunciation of Derek from Veritasium."

For almost all of their time in the air during their careers, the aircraft they were in were actually being flown by autopilot and fly-by-wire systems. So when those systems went wrong they had no idea what they were doing, even though the problem (a stall) could have been rectified relatively easily. Scary stuff."

Sure, the airspeed indicator was inoperative, but the others were ok (such as attitude/pitch, altitude, etc.). Also, they never radioed that they were having troubles. Nor did they communicate with each other in the cockpit. They basically did everything wrong that could have possibly been done wrong.

What would you say to music that is created entirely electronically and can't be performed live in its original form?

HelloInternet,3b8pm7,MrMehawk,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:23:54 2015 UTC,"Musical Experience != Music.  I personally really enjoy intimate venues and experiences, but music is a series of pressure waves you can detect.  Be it live, binaural recorded live, mastered, etc -- the ""product"" which is one or more channels of pressure waves is the same.  The reasons we enjoy these pressure waves in certain patterns and volumes is up for debate (and lots of great debate has happened regarding it).  But, the joy comes from these pressure waves, the purist form of musical joy for me is to close my eyes, and ignore everything around me and be carried away on the music.  I do this at live venues even, recently I did it at a Valentina Lisitsa performance.  I do it at home with fabulous headphones and gear.   The real danger of trying to redefine music as anything other than pressure waves is that it is just varying degrees of ""no true Scotsman"" (IE: what ""real"" music is) and excludes a lot of people who enjoy music, and even a bunch of people who CREATE music.  Lots of music is digitally native these days, Glitch Mob springs to mind but many others as well.  The ""live"" experience is still a digital one in those cases, I would even say that the ""live"" experience is probably secondary and worse in general."
HelloInternet,3b8pm7,robertmeta,2,Sat Jun 27 03:56:59 2015 UTC,"The problem you mention in defining music is one that comes up in defining all types of art, just because the range of things that people do under the umbrella of ""art"" (and the different subcategories thereof) is so wide. However, if you define music as ""a series of pressure waves you can detect"", then that covers literally all sound, which seems wrong to me. As I mentioned in my other comment, I use the definition, ""artistically organized sound and silence"", which is still very broad (for example, many forms of poetry would be included under this definition), but it eliminates a lot of things that most people would agree are not music, such as a vacuum cleaner, or the sound of a person sneezing. Some people would argue that this is still too vague a definition, but I would hesitate to go much further than that for the same reasons you mentioned. One of the things that people commonly debate when it comes to the question of 'what is music?' is (and it's so cliché that I almost hate to bring it up) John Cage's famous work, 4'33"". Under my definition, whether 4'33"" is music or not depends on the intent. The two most common ""points"" that I see argued for this piece are: 1. To prove that silence can be music. 2. To use the ambient sounds of the space and the audience as the music. If Cage's intent was to prove that silence can be music, then I would argue that, yes, 4'33"" is music due to the ""and silence"" part of my definition. (To clarify, I don't think that a piece of music necessarily needs to have both sound and silence to be considered music, but both definitely need to be included in the definition.) However, if Cage's intent was to use the ambient sound of the space as the music, I would argue that the piece is not music, but rather another type of performance art, because that would mean that Cage was not responsible for ""artistically organizing"" the sound in the piece, which I have deemed as necessary for the piece to be considered music. Anyway, make of that what you will. Sorry for the long and rambling comment. It sort of got out of control."

It was composed in 1952, for any instrument or combination of instruments, and the score instructs the performer(s) not to play their instrument(s) during the entire duration of the piece throughout the three movements. The piece purports to consist of the sounds of the environment that the listeners hear while it is performed,  although it is commonly perceived as ""four minutes thirty-three seconds of silence"".   The title of the piece refers to the total length in minutes and seconds of a given performance, 4′33″ being the total length of the first public performance.

Two pieces of whole grain toast with 1 Tbsp. of butter spread between them.   Mid-morning snack: 1 cup of fruit (watermelon is awesome right now).  Lunch: Minestrone soup and large salad with arugula, butter lettuce, tomatoes, 1/2 cup canned corn, two slices of crumbled bacon, and a dressing made with lime juice, olive oil, and a squeeze of honey.  Midday Snack: 1/2 cup of yogurt or a string cheese, with an apple.  Dinner: Chicken faux-parm made by making Italian-style Shake 'N Bake. Cook according to package instructions while you saute minced garlic with a diced onion in a bit of olive oil, add one can of diced tomatoes with one can of crushed tomatoes, season with salt and pepper, and simmer over low heat for 20 minutes. Cook one pound of 100% whole wheat spaghettini (angel hair) until al dente and steam a favorite vegetable in the microwave. Serve yourself one chicken breast, with a 1/2-cup serving of pasta, with some sauce on each. Add 1 cup of the steamed vegetable to your plate, topped with 1 Tbsp. of butter.   Dessert: 1/2 cup slow churned vanilla bean ice cream with another 1/2 cup of defrosted, unsweetened frozen red cherries.  All that food falls right around 2000 calories, which with an active lifestyle puts many people in a negative calorie balance for weight loss.

HelloInternet,3acro8,237millilitres,3,Fri Jun 19 01:32:15 2015 UTC,"Background: I am a homemaker with no kids, so it's really important that I am self-motivated and self-policed about getting things done. I would definitely align much closer in work-personality to Grey than Brady, especially on ""sailing through high school, oh-crap later in life realizing I had no org skills"" but also notably on ""screw work; what's the least amount I have to do to live a good life, and can I do meta-work that will help me avoid work"".  Some of the daily/weekly things I do are the dishes, reading all the flyers to find the deals so I can pricematch, grocery shopping, making plans to and visiting other friends who aren't working outside the home, and cooking dinner almost every single day. Between that stuff I want to make some progress on projects like ""move my domain registration to Hover"", ""finish the deep cleaning of nooks and crannies since we moved in here"", ""learn to knit"", and ""get pregnant"" (we're struggling with fertility issues).  The goal is to keep the evenings and weekends very relaxed with my significant other, whose job allows him to leave all the work at the office.  I borrowed a copy of GTD thanks to another redditor in town (yay! the Internet is awesome!) and within a couple chapters, ordered my own copy.  It's going to be valuable, but not completely revolutionary for me. I had fallen into a lot of the habits by trial and error. But the system is a refinement that will smooth the edges and round the corners of my current system of text files with different lists (schedule, back burner projects, errands subdivided by store or neighbourhood, books to read), google calendar email reminders, and a few folders for the paper stuff I get.  Even though, for the last six months, I've been really good at external storage (""I don't know but it's written down right here"" has become a very common refrain), the idea of capturing 100% of everything into that system still feels novel, and I can't believe I didn't think of it myself.  I had already learned to think of my projects as the next action step but it will be good of me to write those down so that I don't need to re-derive it every time I check the list of projects and think to myself ""and what's next for that?"" Reviews will also stop me from worrying that I moved to much to the back burner for too long.  The biggest move I made immediately before I do my two-day revamp is splitting the ""things I have to get done before day's end"" from ""things I ought to have time to do and are the next things to do when I have time"". That lifted a huge weight from me instantly, and before I even read the pg 258-259 bit about the relief and the burst of energy that came with it I would have put it the same way. I get the momentum of finishing a list without having to get through that longer list, and knowing I did everything urgent without having that bogged down feeling of seeing the things I can't do right this second.  We'll see how well that lasts over time; one possible complication I can imagine is that I might slack off, knowing that everything else can wait, since I'm sure today's necessary tasks are done. I guess redefining ""necessary"" is one way to fight that (e.g. sticking to a stricter housework schedule)."

HelloInternet,3acro8,dwood2001,4,Fri Jun 19 06:05:26 2015 UTC,"Probably a good idea, if people do it. This subreddit is quiet. Here are my comments:  In response to Grey: GTD has definitely made a difference for me. Your way of organizing life in general has been a huge inspiration, and already had a real impact. Before I even get into why, I want to say thank you so much for talking about it.  I read Getting Things Done BEFORE the homework was set, in response to Grey saying it changed his life. I'm also pretty bad at staying focused on what's important, and the many things floating around my head seemed like a big part of why.  Contrary to Brady, the jargon didn't bother me. Which is a bit surprising considering how much I dislike the corporate world. (I was there for a couple of years and then ran for the hills.) I think I just skimmed through the parts that seemed like insubstantial nonsense, and focused on the practical parts.  Like Grey, I enjoy being my own boss. Like Grey, I was a physics teacher for a number of years. At the moment I'm writing science text lessons and video lesson scripts online. I can write as much or as little as I want, so it's very flexible and makes me feel in control of my life. I also make YouTube videos (youtube.com/flippedphysics), many of which were made specifically for the classroom, though in the last 9 months I've had to focus on other things for practical reasons. I hope to get back to posting videos again soon.  GTD has so far been 80% successful for me, but I expect that number to rise. I can see how it would have been incredibly helpful when I was a teacher. As it stands, I'm still working out the kinks. The biggest being:   The issue with contexts that Grey mentioned: I can do almost everything, almost anywhere. The fact that I don't have an app that has real Next Actions functionality, so I spend too much time being able to see my full list.   I'm a PC user and can't use Omnifocus. The best I've found is Toodledo. It isn't pretty, but it's quite customizable. However, when you complete a next action, there's no way to tell it to assign next action to the next item. You have to do it by hand, which has caused me not to use the system properly. However, I think I'll find a way to make it work for me after some time playing around.  If nothing else, getting things out of my head has made me a better person. I no longer forget to do things my wife asks me to do. I'm less likely to bounce from one thing to the next.  Though procrastination hasn't magically gone away: I'm seriously thinking about putting hard boundaries on my ability to access Facebook, YouTube and such. So far I've installed a program that stops me from going to Facebook between certain AM hours so that I can get a good start to the day. I think that will help.  I'm also creating systems like Grey's to make life easier: a bag that's ready to go at the door, extra chargers and other items in every location so I never need to remember to bring them. This seems so simple, yet it is quite revolutionary in terms of efficiency. I'm naturally SO slow at getting out of the door, and that's changing.  There are certain things in the system that are important to me, but I was already doing, like checklists and life reviews. But these things have gone into overdrive recently.  My wife and I have a quarterly marriage review that, while it may seem unfeeling, has caused real improvements to our relationship. I've managed to eliminate a couple of habits she finds irritating, for a mundane example. And I feel like we're really becoming better people. As much as having a formal review document for a marriage might seem ridiculous, the fact that we care enough to do this for each other makes the experience quite loving. It's really nice.  TLDR; GTD has issues with modern contexts and the lack of available next action functionality in PC implementations. But GTD and Grey's various systems have changed my life significantly, and even improved my marriage. Thank you for talking about them :)"
HelloInternet,3acro8,rndmjules,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:26:03 2015 UTC,"I had already purchased the book before it was assigned as homework, and I waited to listen to #39 until I had finished it. I work in an Elections Office in Texas and am definitely one of the people described in the book with stacks of papers on my desk and 1000 emails constantly in my inbox.   I'm also fascinated with systems and looking for better/easier ways to do things or ways to increase efficiency. These are some of my favorite things to hear y'all talk about.  I do agree with much of what y'all said about the book. Part 1 in particular was leaving me cross-eyed, not to mention the ""five (six?) horizons"" part. However, I still got quite a bit out of it and I've jumped in to the GTD cult with both feet.  I'm mid- 2 day implementation (definitely going to be more like 3-4 days!) and I can already feel the benefit of not having to keep things in my mind. The two-minute rule is huge, too. It's early days yet, so it remains to be seen if it's life changing, but having been at my job for 2 presidential elections already, I can see exactly how this system will make next year easier for me. I'm constantly being approached with innumerable questions and tasks all of which are important and time-sensitive, and which in the past I've either tried to remember, or found my desk littered with scraps of paper with jotted notes on them. If this system works as well as I think (and hope) I'll be in a much better place next year.   OneNote: I implemented my GTD system on OneNote. I got a Surface Pro 3 a couple months ago and OneNote is really well designed for that computer/tablet especially. I got this (http://www.amazon.com/OneNote-Ultimate-Guide-Getting-Things-ebook/dp/B00X2IRCG2/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1436506894&sr=1-2&keywords=getting+things+done+onenote) little book to walk me through it and I've found that it does everything I need it to do, including contexts (you can customize to-do tags for things like ""office"" or ""computer"") as well as keeping each of my lists separate so projects doesn't bleed onto next actions. There's also a OneNote Android app so everything syncs across all my computers and phone. I would definitely recommend it for PC users.  Contexts: Although I don't have the blurred contexts problem to the extent Grey does, I also found that with mobile computing there's plenty of things I can do anywhere. I tagged many of my next actions with things like ""focus"" or ""podcasts"" (for items I can do while listening to Hello Internet) or ""mindless"" (for mornings when my brain hasn't woken up completely). It doesn't quite solve the ""thinking about ice cream"" problem Grey described, but it does help me narrow the list so I only see the tasks I'm in the right mind-set for.   Thanks again for recommendation!"

HelloInternet,3aa0ff,nicuro,5,Thu Jun 18 12:20:09 2015 UTC,The way it works is:   every mp gets a black and white ball when voting a white ball in the white urn and a black ball in the black urn means a yes vote a black ball in the white urn and a white ball in the black urn means a no vote and both balls in the black urn means a null vote
HelloInternet,3aa0ff,jimhellas,2,Thu Jun 18 12:26:23 2015 UTC,What about both balls in the white urn? I guess it's a null vote as well...  So how does this work exactly? At the end they count the white and black balls in each urn and make the calculation?
HelloInternet,3aa0ff,jasonl6,3,Thu Jun 18 13:42:26 2015 UTC,I actually don't know :)  I've tried to search for the exact counting procedure but can't seem to find it. I'll keep searching because i'm also curious and this seems like the kind of thing that should be easy to find.
HelloInternet,3aa0ff,bigmansam45,2,Thu Jun 18 14:03:29 2015 UTC,"It would make sense to compare the number of white and black balls in the white urn. The black urn is just a discard urn, so putting both balls in the black urn (a null vote) wouldn’t count either way.  The system is essentially the same as the box on the podcast, but having two urns gets rid of the problem of everyone having a ball left after they’ve voted, which could accidently give away whether they voted yes or no. Logistically, it means the extra balls do not have to be collected after the vote."
HelloInternet,3aa0ff,Agothro,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:11:13 2015 UTC,"Would make sense, though you would only need to count the white urn.  White balls minus black balls gives the margin of win/loss.  The black urn could be counted to double check the result, but it should produce the exact opposite score (if white urn equals +10 black urn should equal -10)."

You wind up with contexts like ""short dash"", ""full focus"", ""brain dead"". That way, you can gauge you energy level and pick appropriate tasks."
HelloInternet,3aap20,le0271,3,Thu Jun 18 15:53:38 2015 UTC,"I had to go re-listen before I responded, because I had no memory of being enraged, and generally dumb programming things make me enraged (as a professional developer for the last 20 years).   Ok live translation programs does already exist. Nothing that simple would take 50 years to make.   I think he was speaking of a ""universal translator"", which is far from simple.  For that, I absolutely agree with him because of the different types of languages.  Maybe not 100 years, but 25-50 years I suspect.  I am guessing you are thinking very simplistically about language (very European focused), check out Tom Scott's videos on language.  There are languages where entire sentence are combined into a single words in an adhoc manner.  There is a spectrum of language types and some are far more complex than others, and far harder to automatically translate.   He also says programing languages change so fast that teaching it in school would be useless.   You can teach basics in school, but specifics are indeed, mostly useless.  So useless in fact that I like when schools use more esoteric languages to teach because it removes the idea that they are learning useful language skills and helps them focus on CS fundamentals (IE: ""a very broad way"").    While talking to professional programmers I have heard something like ""If you know one programing language, you know everyone"".   The programmers you talked to are morons, do not hire them.  There are a whole lot of major programming languages, and probably hundreds of thousands of minor ones and DSLs.  Programming languages vary wildly, while knowing one that is very similar to another can reduce learning time, there are a lot of basic ""types"" to learn.  At a bare minimum, you have Procedural, Class, Functional, Syntactic, Declarative, Coroutines, Parallelism, Design by Contract, CSP style concurrent, GC Free Lifetime Tracking and I am sure a dozen other major styles that aren't on the tip of my tongue.  So if you just learn like: C, Java, ML, Lisp, Prolog, Scheme, Sisal, Eiffel, Erlang and Rust I think you have a fairly good baseline, but learning a new language is still non-trivial.  Put an average VB.net developer in front of most languages and they couldn't write the most basic ""Hello World"" program, let alone do useful work.    If you learned the basics in the first Visual Basic .NET version you would have had no trouble making the same kind of programs now, almost 15 years later.   Except of course, you would be a horrible modern programmer and you would be fired.  While the fundamental constructs of the language are backwards compatible, a lot has changed in the 14 years since 7.0 (it isn't even 15 years old yet), the way you write it has changed a ton because of things like LINQ, Lambdas, etc.  The way VB.net code actually looks in real life is absolutely different -- so while you COULD write code in the oldest style, again you would be fired, and WORSE, you can't READ any of the newer code because it is chalk full of things that were not even available when you learned... you would be entirely lost."
HelloInternet,3aap20,robertmeta,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:12:34 2015 UTC,"Damn you really thought this through, huh? Even though I agree to many of your points, I don't think people have time to learn anything in that kind of detail in school. Just throw a normal OOP language at them and they'll be much better off than learning foreign language."
HelloInternet,3aap20,robertmeta,3,Thu Jun 18 21:12:26 2015 UTC,"I agree that broadly, learning any programming language is probably more valuable for an average person in a wealthy western country.  I don't agree with you about the best language to throw at them (as I said above, I believe less popular languages can teach a lot more about programming that won't do the knowledge equivalent of bitrot).  When I was a kid, Pascal was the hot teaching language.  I enjoyed it, but obviously, not doing a lot of Pascal these days.  Even Delphi is mostly dead and gone.  Core concept I learned are still around and portable to other languages."
HelloInternet,3aap20,robertmeta,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:24:17 2015 UTC,"Pascal was a language written to learn students the syntax and thinking behind writing programs, but it very old and maybe that is how much you needed then. Now, however, I think people should be able to learn at least that and often have time for more if they would set a whole class to it one year.  So do you have any reasoning behind your statement about the language to throw at them? I know from my own experience that with Object-Oriented programing languages you learn most core stuff you need. The first language I learned was not OOP, and it didn't really click until I learned one.  Also not all OOPs is popular. You say some less popular languages is  the best choices, but I can't see why that would stay against OOPs."
HelloInternet,3aap20,robertmeta,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:17:55 2015 UTC,"So do you have any reasoning behind your statement about the language to throw at them?   Yes.  The syntax and features of most languages shift rather rapidly.  VB.net acts a a perfect example of this -- it is gaining new features every year.  For example, just this year they added the Foo.?bar syntax for optional returns.  I think it is best to use more education focused and/or esoteric languages so they act less as a ""how to use language X"" class and more ""how to be a programmer"".   I know from my own experience that with Object-Oriented programing languages you learn most core stuff you need.   Bluntly, you are wrong.  If you only learned OO, you are very ignorant as a developer.  I wouldn't considering hiring anyone with just OO experience.  I find it hilarious that you don't know other styles of programming, but you are sure you don't need them anyway.  Just to be a ""minimally competent"" developer you need procedural, functional, class (OO), and declarative experience... as those are types an average developer will use regularly.   Also not all OOPs is popular. You say some less popular languages is the best choices, but I can't see why that would stay against OOPs.   It isn't against OOP, I think Smalltalk is a fantastic teaching language and very OO focused."

Everything is cool.   The only language you mentioned was VB.net, please insert other mainstream OO language if you want my examples to reference it instead, I will update them.  I stick by preferring more esoteric languages to common ones specifically due to the lack of general applicability and slower rates of change (teachers can master it and get better at teaching it).  Teach theory in school, they will get practice in life.  My core issue was around ""I know from my own experience that with Object-Oriented programing languages you learn most core stuff you need."" and I don't agree with that -- I suspect an average person might learn more from learning SQL, which is declarative/procedural.  ""Need"" in this case is probably somewhat industry specific.  Lots of people can use SQL, some amount might use functional concepts (like, for example, in Excel).  I think OO is one of the least useful to general people.  For my personal experience, OO seemed like a bloody mess, it seemed to cut against the grain of real problems.  It wasn't until I started toying with Lisp (and later on the other end, ASM) that stuff started to click."

HelloInternet,3a4tbc,3kindsofsalt,2,Wed Jun 17 13:53:27 2015 UTC,"I would just like to suggest that perhaps the black/brown balls were an adaptation to the voting system to further the anonymity of voting.  Consider that these were probably solemn affairs, and unless something were in place to create noise as a cover, you could likely hear a ball hitting this box from down the hallways of contemplative, pipe-smoking fellows.  If you hear a marble hit other marbles you'd know they piled on a vote--but a particularly unpopular vote would be a met with the loud knocking of a ball bouncing into an empty box.  Alternatively(though I think less likely because this was a monitored affair), it might be possible that an exceptionally nimble person could reach down and move the balls others have dropped into another side, and if they were simply colored balls, it wouldn't matter which side they were placed in."
HelloInternet,3a4tbc,brawler839,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:13:24 2015 UTC,"This is what I thought of when I saw box, It might be easy to tell if someone voted against the rest of them. The ability to drop in a marble in both would keep your vote more of a secret.   After grey mentioned the weight I thought that it might be an easy way to tally the votes. Which ever side weighs more (or less) is the winner, but it's probably because the material for black and white have different weights."

HelloInternet,3a2sdg,Atmosck,5,Tue Jun 16 19:53:31 2015 UTC,"It's certainly a personal choice, but I think Grey's point of view is that it steals much more time and attention if it's on your phone. If twitter is constantly available in your pocket, the tempation is very big to check it every now and then, even when you should/could really be doing something better with your time. So he chooses to just indulge himself with twitter when he's at the computer. But if you enjoy checking twitter on the bus and see no problem with it, having it on your phone is a great convenience :)"

HelloInternet,39yv4a,mooglinux,2,Tue Jun 30 17:12:52 2015 UTC,"They could at least port the desktop version to Windows!!! Porting it from Mac to Windows would be the easiest port of all, and there are more then 7x as many Windows computers as Macs. 20% more work for 744% more potential customers is a far more efficient use of their resources.   Apple's ui library works on Windows, and whatever their database is, it is almost certain to work on Windows too. A well written program will isolate os specific tasks, making it cheap to expand to other platforms. When valve ported their source engine to Linux, 98% of the code was left unchanged.   Done smartly, that extra effort to get the code working across platforms gives such huge returns.

HelloInternet,39xtnr,Jethro_H,3,Mon Jun 15 17:56:37 2015 UTC,"I love the idea of education as installing an operating system on a persons brain.  But the difference between London history and Tim's birthday is surely the usefulness of the latter. Though I suppose it could be argued it is this usefulness that makes it important to outsource that part of our remembering, whereas we can remember historical facts or not as whimsy takes us.  I think the style of Grey's educational content video's are (while very entertaining) very easy to not learn from. They're not installing any mental processing center; just saying facts into our ears. To that end they're not educational videos but rather entertainment video's that happen to have factual content."

HelloInternet,39xtnr,Kitworks,3,Mon Jun 15 19:06:24 2015 UTC,"What he really means when he says the mind is not a storage facility is that our minds are bad at remembering a specific piece of information exactly when we need them to.  For something like an appointment, you need to be reminded exactly early enough that you can get ready for and go to the appointment. Most often your mind wont think of the appointment at the right time unless prompted. Once prompted, you probably remember it fine, but you need that external prompt.  With non-urgent info like How to Become Pope, you don't need to recall it at exactly 2:00PM on Tuesday. You only need to recall it when prompted randomly, say, when your family mentions the pope at dinner.  Really Grey is talking about externalizing the prompts in a system that is reliable."
HelloInternet,39xtnr,Kitworks,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:59:56 2015 UTC,"You've never been in the situation of knowing you have a funny story; or neat piece of information about say the pope, and not been able to call it to mind on queue?"
HelloInternet,39xtnr,techadams,2,Tue Jun 16 10:51:09 2015 UTC,"Oh sure, it happens.  I just mean, our brains are much better at remembering information when prompted (someone mentions the pope, you remember a funny story) than remembering timely information exactly when needed (you have an appointment at 2PM today).  Actually, a perfect example. It's pretty easy to forget you have an appointment completely. But, most likely, you only need a reminder that you have an appointment to remember where, when, with who and what its about.  So it makes more sense to outsource the timely info to some external source, especially since we have near-flawless machines in our pockets that can do that. The rest, if you can remember, great, and if not, Google.  (Plus: Better to know, say, that there is a system for how the pope is elected and need to google the details when it comes up than to not know there is a system to Google at all.)"

I suppose if I had committed whole hog, and converted my own keyboard I might have done it, but I had to ask myself why I was even trying. And it turned out it was just because I was curious.   So I gave up."
HelloInternet,39vbyo,TheVeryMask,2,Mon Jun 15 13:41:57 2015 UTC,"QWERTY was the only keyboard layout I had ever known until I tried Dvorak, yesterday.   I think I kind of like it, but you're right, Dr Jeckill and Mr Hyde no doubt.   The thing with fully changing to it is that my laptop's keyboard will always have QWERTY printed on it regardless what I configure it to do, and that alone will be a challenge.  I'm just curious, that's why I'm doing it. Nothing more, nothing less. I had heard of different keyboards layouts before but never felt bored enough to try them out I guess hahaha"
HelloInternet,39vbyo,LarryStylinsonShip,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:53:33 2015 UTC,"Why is this rehosting/posting MY image without even asking for my permision? I mean, this particular picture may not be arty or whatever but... WHY?"
HelloInternet,39vbyo,Nashafa,2,Mon Jun 15 02:54:30 2015 UTC,"Hi. I'm the guy who made this bot.  The main reason this bot rehosts the IG image is to allow for people that don't have access to IG to view the image. I remember being in a school / work place where certain websites (especially social media sites like IG, Facebook, etc.) were blocked. I couldn't view or interact with that post because of this. A bot like this can help people who want to participate but can't.  You seem concerned about your privacy, but I have to question why your actions don't match your sentiments. Once you upload an image to IG, with your profile public, it is available to anyone on the internet. If you don't want your Instagram posts to be viewed, rehosted, etc. then please set your profile to private. That way no unwanted bot nor human can view, rehost, etc. your images.  I hope my explanation helped. Sorry for any typos, etc."
HelloInternet,39vbyo,jeffnunn,-3,Mon Jun 15 04:23:27 2015 UTC,"Dude, I understand the reason now that you have explained it. BUT saying that because my profile is public I have to expect anyone or anything to rehost my posts is ludicrous.  That is victim shaming, saying that is the same as saying that by making your username /u/drogbafan public anyone can missuse it in anyway they want. and that is just not the case.  You should've just left that second paragraph out. Yes, I'm concern about my privacy AND about others taking credit for my work even if it is lame as fuck.   Public profiles are NOT consent for copyright infrigement. Do you go about copying and rehosting CGP Grey's and Brady's videos just because they are public?  When you enable the video feature, Is your bot going to rehost them if any fan or themselves posts them on this subreddit?  Dude, like I said, I get the reason behind it now that you explained it, I still think is rude and wrong to not even ask about it. but your excuse to ""public profile so you should've known it can happened"" is just not only stupid but it says nothing about my actions matching my sentiment.  Sorry mate but what your bot does is in the realm of freebooting, even if it is for a good cause. Although if people are using a network that blocks these sites, maybe they should get back to work/school and then interact with reddit. or better yet, use a different network were they can interact with a post. I doubt any of this posts is so time sensitive people NEED to see the images blocked by their work/school/whatever-place or they'll suffer a calamity.  Sorry for any misspelling and typos, like i said in OP, english is not my first language.  Edit: Typos"
HelloInternet,39vbyo,FrameWork0,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:58:11 2015 UTC,"Good points. However, this bot can't just take an IG post and rehost it. It only does that if YOU submit a link to that IG post.  Also, how is it copyright infringement when my bot claims zero credit for any of these IG posts? It clearly denotes the owner of the IG post, links to that users page and the users post, and declares that the only purpose of this bot is to rehost the image for easier access. No way in hell this is copyright infringement. Are you aware of instagram viewer sites that rehost your whole profile for the public's viewing pleasure? Sites like Websta, Iconosquare, Findgram, Gramfeed, and Pinsta. These sites have all rehosted your whole profile, and I have linked to as many of them as I can.  So,   A. My bot is not infringing on your copyright   B. There is much more ""copyright infringement"" happening to your account daily, on a bigger scale.  Awaiting your reply."

That's because (1) figures don't render well on a Kindle, (2) colors do not show, (3) I'm likely to read them out of order or only read specific chapters or skim through them, and (4) I'll mostly use them for short periods of time to reference an equation, theory, or algorithm.

Anyway,  I just took this Ennegram one and it kind of disproves itself.  It shows you how heavily your personality is in each of the personality types.   I show heavily in three and pretty strong in the others. In other words - no type.    And like all of those tests, the questions are OR options and sometimes both options seem like me.  Sometimes neither one does. And that is because context is a huge factor in how I act.  Which is also like the prison guards.  People tend to respond to context."

I was designing a set of tables for random personality generation via dice, so I got really into systems like this. Enneagram's full system has a one-time paywall, but I still didn't go for it.
