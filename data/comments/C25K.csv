C25K,3e2l47,Sugarpiehoneybitch,2,Tue Jul 21 13:54:55 2015 UTC,Good work!  Welcome to the W5D3 club!
C25K,3e2l47,MissVancouver,2,Tue Jul 21 17:46:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I feel like W5D3 is kind of a wall of a day, so I'm excited to be on the other side."
C25K,3e2l47,mpchaplin,2,Tue Jul 21 18:41:40 2015 UTC,This program really is life changing. I can't say enough about it. You feel so strong after these runs that it expands throughout the rest of your life. You can do it.
C25K,3e1aa7,Run_Ollie_Run,2,Tue Jul 21 04:42:16 2015 UTC,"D3 isn't that bad, it's all mental. If you can do D1 and D2 that is. I broke it down into chunks, and only committed to bits at a time.   ""I'll do half, 10 mins. Done 10, I'll do 16, as that's the same as D2 but without the gap. I've done 16.. might as well do the full 20""."

C25K,3e1aa7,freebsdbug,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:10:03 2015 UTC,"I love the treadmill. That is ALL I have been using for this program so far. Once i get to the end my goal is to take it outside.  It is about 90 in Boston right now, I hate sweating, and my air conditioned gym has treadmills with fans right in front of them."

C25K,3e0eth,P0PSTART,3,Tue Jul 21 01:51:25 2015 UTC,You are saying that you finished Week 6 Day 3... as smoker???  I quit smoking 8 years ago and I could not fathom doing this program when my lungs were in that shape.

C25K,3e0eth,Op_delivering,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:34:11 2015 UTC,Lol I wish I could say that was a sunburn. My face just turns really red when I exercise. Once this lady at the gym saw me splashing water on my face in the bathroom and asked me if I needed her to call for help.

C25K,3e3y8i,cerisiere,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:43:49 2015 UTC,Welcome back. I can see how breaking a foot would throw a wrench in the running plans. Take it easy and go slow! Happy running!
C25K,3e3y8i,mpchaplin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:33:42 2015 UTC,Nonsense! Who needs feet to run anyways? :P
C25K,3e2uh3,gonthrax,2,Tue Jul 21 15:09:37 2015 UTC,"I did the same. Ran W2D3 on Friday, bought trainers on Saturday and had to wait until Monday to run"
C25K,3e2y7j,Mirabellae,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:37:08 2015 UTC,Good work!  Don't worry about week 4..  it's just a small progression beyond week 3.  You can do it!
C25K,3e3548,c25kanklepain,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:26:32 2015 UTC,"Have you had this kind of pain before, e.g. while walking? There's some chance that it's the shoes, but it's equally possible that the combination of your weight and your running form are putting excessive stress on the ankle.  As far as form is concerned, this comment on /r/running is a great overview. A lot of beginning runners overstride; their feet land in front of their body, not below it, which slows them down (braking effect) and puts additional strain on the joints.  If you've been really sedentary, you might consider beginning with a few weeks of walking before taking up C25K, and look into ankle-strengthening exercises. It's a good sign that you weren't tired or out of breath.  I'll just add my own experience: I ran a lot in my 20s, and was quite light. I started to put on weight in my 30s, and every time I took up running again, I would get injuries and have to stop. I think that's because I took things too quickly, though. When I started running again, I had already gotten down to 170 lb. (from a high of 225 or so) and I didn't experience any problems, but I think that was due more to the gradual nature of C25K than to my weight. I also had gotten fit through cycling, which is low impact. You might consider that, either in lieu of running or as cross training."
C25K,3e2488,TheRainingLeaf,2,Tue Jul 21 10:59:07 2015 UTC,"will I be okay to run W1D2 tomorrow?   You should be able to, unless you injured yourself.   You would be able to tell though as soreness due to DOMS feels different than the pain of injury (in my experience anyway)."
C25K,3e2488,freebsdbug,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:09:09 2015 UTC,"Give yourself an extra day if you wake up tomorrow and the soreness hasnt subsided at least a little bit, but generally speaking the soreness is normal and you should be fine."
C25K,3e2488,sciencedenton,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:09:51 2015 UTC,Don't forget to stretch today!
C25K,3e2488,onekrazykat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:22:50 2015 UTC,"Soreness is good! And it's normal. In the beginning of c25k every run I started I was still sore from the run before. I found pushing through the soreness and completing my scheduled run helped me deal with the pain by altering my mentality. Now that I'm half way through, the soreness is less and less. As long as you are not injured, push through it. (Some over the counter pain medication can be helpful too.) You can do this!"
C25K,3e0j3c,discomermaid,4,Tue Jul 21 00:48:28 2015 UTC,"left me hot sweaty and ready for more!   That's what she said!  lol, sorry I could not help myself.  I'm coming off my run and feeling a bit childish...  Great job on entering week 2.  You are a runner now!  Keep going, you can do this!!!"
C25K,3e0j3c,Jolal,3,Tue Jul 21 01:13:48 2015 UTC,"Ha, I deserved that!  And thanks."
C25K,3e0j3c,AceMeepsm,3,Tue Jul 21 01:19:54 2015 UTC,Aaaaand... should've worn sunscreen.. face and chest even more red than usual.  Won't be able to really tell for an hour until my tomato-y red running face cools off!
C25K,3e3pfg,BrandSeph,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:44:23 2015 UTC,"This happens to me too at times, and I think the most likely cause is dehydration. It doesn't seem to happen on the days when I make sure I've had plenty to drink prior to going for a run."
C25K,3e3pfg,DeltaMikeCharlie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:47:14 2015 UTC,"That's odd, since I always keep my hydration level on check."
C25K,3e3pfg,DeltaMikeCharlie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:15:59 2015 UTC,Might be a different issue for you then. The pain sounds identical though. Let me know if you figure it out!
C25K,3e3pfg,Ninjacaterpillar95,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:28:03 2015 UTC,"It's a muscle cramp, totally normal. There's no one root cause- it could be dehydration, it could be poor posture, it could be poor breathing habits. More than likely it's a mix of all of these. Exhaling when your left foot strikes the ground can reduce the cramps, but really the only thing that will make them go away is pushing through and getting more fit."
C25K,3e3pfg,Ninjacaterpillar95,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:40:01 2015 UTC,Soo just keep running?
C25K,3e11yp,RushmoreBocaj,6,Tue Jul 21 03:24:35 2015 UTC,"I find the rest days so important though. I mean don't get me wrong sometimes I'm itching to go for a run, but the benefits are so great, letting my body ""absorb"" the gains. I used to run without rest days and back then my progress was a lot slower - it took me a lot longer to train up distance wise.  Thanks for the summary of your experience though. Interesting read."
C25K,3e11yp,nasrmg,4,Tue Jul 21 04:52:57 2015 UTC,"i think I'm going to join a gym so I can do alternative exercises like weight training on days I don't run. Spend 3 days a week at the gym and 3 days a week running.  Given my history of never following through with habitual exercise, I'm hesitant to get too in the habit of taking rest days because I'm afraid I'll fall out of habit. I gotta do what works for me."
C25K,3e11yp,gonthrax,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:22:43 2015 UTC,"This is a really good idea.  In the first few weeks I tried to run every day.  I think that stress on your system when it isn't used to any punishment is a bad idea.  I currently run 3 days a week, do weights 3 days a week and walk 6 days a week.  Once I finish the program I'll look to add in a day of running  and then another as I up my mileage."
C25K,3e11yp,brianogilvie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:11:01 2015 UTC,"Most of this is great advice, but you're lucky that you got away with running six days a week without getting an overuse injury. Most beginners should take the rest days. If you're worried about not sticking with the program, cross train the other days: walk, cycle, swim, row, lift, etc."
C25K,3e15ia,rubix_cubes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:56:51 2015 UTC,"Just finished w2d3. Walking was fine but as soon as I started jogging everything knees down hurt so bad. I almost went home but I didn't want to face my husband after giving up.   I'm so glad I didn't go home. I finished and I had something great happen. I was in the 10 minute free run and normally I'm just uncomfortable. This time I felt...good. I was jogging forever!  Well, for a minute. And then another 30 seconds where I wouldn't let myself stop until I got to the end of the block.  I'm so happy I went out!"
C25K,3e248h,bluejacket1989,2,Tue Jul 21 10:59:13 2015 UTC,"I had a similar experience.  I was fitted for running shoes in week 2, started getting knee pain in week 3.  It hurt the most walking down stairs the day after running.  I ended up buying a compression sleeve which helped me tremendously.  I felt my kneecap moving around and popping and clicking while walking which prompted the purchase.  It helped stabilize my kneecap and prevented me from continuing to hurt the knee through the program.  I also made sure that I wasn't over striding and landed mid-foot after starting out as someone who landed on the heel."
C25K,3e248h,CrazyLegs17,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:45:54 2015 UTC,"Hm, I may need to look in to one! Did you just pick yours up from a sports store or is it something you should get fitted for? Is there any brand you recommend?"
C25K,3e248h,cappync,2,Tue Jul 21 13:50:25 2015 UTC,I got mine at a Dick's sporting goods. The brand is Shock Doctor ($20) and I  really like it. They have multiple sizes so make sure it fits correctly.
C25K,3e248h,CrazyLegs17,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:30:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks, will check it out"
C25K,3e248h,roadtoavacado,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:26:52 2015 UTC,"I picked one up at CVS.  Measure your thigh circumference about 5 - 6 inches above the knee.  That's what you'll need to size one in store.  They give a range in inches for the thigh circumference.  I got a sort of mid-range sleeve with a gel padding at the kneecap and rigid bracers down each side.  It made an immediate improvement for me.  As someone else mentioned, I also recommend strengthening exercises and stretching.  Both help to prevent the problem as well."
C25K,3e248h,CrazyLegs17,2,Tue Jul 21 16:14:04 2015 UTC,Same thing happened to me around week 2. I was having a really hard time with it but didn't want to fall behind. So I bought a sleeve and powered through. It didn't hurt when I was running but I wore the sleeve even when I was walking home from work as it was really sore and stiff for about a week and a half.  I looked into a lot of things and came to the conclusion that my hips were probably just super weak so there was a lot of weight on my knees.  Anyway on week 6 right now and haven't had any pain and haven't had o wear the sleeve for a couple of weeks.  Your body's probably just getting used to the activity.
C25K,3e248h,the_crayon_moose,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:22:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reassurance! I'm looking in to some stability exercises, hopefully my knees will start co-operating"
C25K,3e248h,cappync,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:26:15 2015 UTC,I second the notion to look at hip exercises.
C25K,3e248h,Raywes88,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:15:13 2015 UTC,"Listen to your body. If your knee is giving off little twinges and aches below the kneecap, that could be a sign that you're developing runner's knee which is a form of tendinitis. It's better to take a break for a week and see what it feels like then than to have it go full blown and take you out for more than a week. If it's still bothering you after that, it might be time to consult someone. You generally won't physically lose progress in a week's time. Let that knee rest!"
C25K,3e248h,the_crayon_moose,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:14:29 2015 UTC,"That's not what I wanted to hear :(  It's frustrating, because I did that the first time this came up - took some time off and went to the physio. He seemed to think it just needed a rest and recommended some knee exercises. I did all that and now the same problem seems to be coming up again. Thanks for your reply, maybe I just need to do some more of those exercises or something"
C25K,3dy4i7,Gn_TravelWell,4,Mon Jul 20 14:13:24 2015 UTC,Cheers. Starting tomorrow once it's not 95 degrees out.

C25K,3e0kxj,Jolal,5,Tue Jul 21 01:03:19 2015 UTC,"Was running and knew I only had a minute or two left, but it's been a warm day here that stayed warm into the evening, with 90% humidity reported when I went out of the door to do the run.  I was feeling pretty drained, but determined.  As I was coming up a small set of stairs there was some sort of small drop, or bump, or something, but I lost my balance.  Funny how the mind works super fast when doing this, I made about 10 decisions on how to save myself with my body just not moving fast enough to do it, before I realized I was gonna hurt myself if I kept trying and just went with it.  Tucked and rolled into a fall right in front of this oncoming father with young son pair.  It was awesome, I actually laughed out loud.  Anyway, that burned up about 30 seconds.  So I added more than that onto the end to make sure I did the full 25 minutes.  What a night...  Calling W7D2 done, with my first running wipeout..."

C25K,3e12hz,shedoesntevengohere4,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:29:08 2015 UTC,"Some people get really ill (and, sometimes, throw up) when they exercise strenuously on an empty stomach.  I would say, however, that the combination of dehydration along with running on empty probably caused a sharp dip in your blood pressure/blood glucose levels and your body just kind of had a mini freakout.   I only have a 4 hour eating window (20 hour fast) but, thankfully, I'm not one of those people and have never had any issues. But, I know of heaps of people who want to work out in a fasted state but they physically can't because it leads to them feeling super unwell.  Everyone is different, and as long as it doesn't keep happening- like you said, you have done this day a few times before and it seems to be just a once off- then I don't think there's much to worry about. I used to throw up if I drank green tea on an empty stomach, but now I'm totally fine."
C25K,3e12hz,Cicatrix21,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:49:40 2015 UTC,A little off topic but damn I still throw up if I drink green tea... empty stomach or not! Hate that ><
C25K,3e12hz,P0PSTART,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:04:13 2015 UTC,My wife throws up when she works out really hard. It's not super uncommon. She was an athlete through college and frequently puked during intense practices and long runs. Doesn't happen to me though.
C25K,3e12hz,RushmoreBocaj,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:29:20 2015 UTC,I thought it was normal to puke after going really hard. I used to throw up what felt like gallons of water after suicides at football practice. I've literally had my coach tell us to do suicides until everyone puked.

C25K,3e00ui,kewers77,0,Tue Jul 21 00:25:01 2015 UTC,Yeah the first one was all fine and dandy but the second one killed me haha
C25K,3e00ui,mpchaplin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:51:32 2015 UTC,The 3 min run was where I struggled the most in the beginning. I think the struggle makes it so amazing later when you're running 10x that without stopping.
C25K,3dzxqy,SiMania,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:00:01 2015 UTC,"I have avoided posting and just reading as I wasn't sure I'd get this far. Days 1-5 were fun but the soles of my feet were in constant pain throughout each run with day 5 being the worst. I got home and struggled to walk. I was running with Adidas or Nikes. Very comfortable shoes for daily use but I wondered if they were causing the pain or it was beginners niggles.   So come day 6 I decided to wear a pair of Salomon outdoor trekking shoes, immediately when I started to run I could feel it in my knees, these are not for running! I finished my run and probably had my best one up until then, the foot pain was pretty much non-existent.  The following day (Saturday) I visited a local running shop and got a decent pair of running shoes that fits my foot and running type.   W3D1 was certainly the easiest on my feet, my knees were sore but eased up as I warmed up. The 3 minute runs had me blowing out of my backside, all good in the end."
C25K,3dzxqy,Jolal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:11:55 2015 UTC,"Your a runner now Harry...  Great job on moving forward with your progress.  I told myself when I started at the beginning of June if I was still doing it after 10 days I was signing up for a 5k in August.  I was and I did and it's approaching.  Remember, you can only fail this if you quit.  Keep going, you got this!"
C25K,3e07l7,gr00ve88,2,Mon Jul 20 23:15:16 2015 UTC,"This is a classic symptom of shin splints! Most common culprits are (1) inadequate footware and (2) heel striking.  Unless you have a perfect pair of feet, you'll need to get fitted for running shoes with the right amount of support. I personally need ""stability shoes"" with lots of support, since my feet are flat as hotcakes. I get shin splints every time I try to run in regular running shoes. Go to any running store - it's usually free to get fitted, since you're buying their shoes.  EDIT: I recommend resting until you have new shoes and are not sore. I read that injuries can build up, and that scar tissue accumulates!"
C25K,3e07l7,patchesnbrownie,2,Tue Jul 21 02:30:26 2015 UTC,"I thought you get shin splints AFTER running for a long time? I get this pain on the FIRST step of my jogging period... it subsides after a few minutes of running.  My footwear might not be the best, they are sneakers not necessarily running shoes.  I've been meaning to pickup a new pair.  edit: hmm after watching that video, i am probably heel striking."
C25K,3e07l7,patchesnbrownie,2,Tue Jul 21 02:39:33 2015 UTC,"Yup, that sounds about right. You're feeling shin splints from your previous run/ walk/ whatever stressful activity you put on your legs. Most times when I had a shin splint, I wouldn't feel it doing normal everyday walking. I'd feel it on the next run, when I put high impact on my legs.  Other tips from someone who suffered a lot of shin splints due to lack of knowledge: - Stretch the f*ck out of your lower legs after every single run!  - Do exercises to strengthen your lower legs - If you feel that your shin is sore, prop them up on pillows and put some ice bags on them right away. Keeps the inflammation down. - I know running temporarily makes your shins feel better, but avoid running when you have shin splints. It can lead to stress fractures!"

C25K,3e07l7,toxik0n,2,Mon Jul 20 23:25:26 2015 UTC,what? no. lol... to avoid the pain when I start to run.  Im guessing its something like a tight muscle that loosens up as I run? i don't know.

C25k has been amazing for me. When I started in May I had the speed and stamina of a one-legged narcoleptic sloth. I'm still definitely not Paula Radcliffe but this morning I ran continuously for 37 minutes and 15 seconds - I can't believe it! At the race they separated people into three groups - walkers, joggers and runners - and it felt so good to go into the 'runners' group. Next stop 10k!  Stats if anyone is interested: Imgur You can see my sprint across the finish line on the graph :)"

C25K,3du1ym,avrenak,2,Sun Jul 19 15:30:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've run two 10K races and I've done quite a few 10K+ practice runs (following the Hal Higdon Half Marathon plan).  I've signed up for a 16K on the first Sunday of August and half marathon the next Sunday. I don't mind walking for a bit, but I've discovered that if i pace myself pretty slowly I might actually be able to run the whole way. Crossing fingers and hoping for the best. If I manage to finish the half in under 3 hours, I'll call it victory! :)"

C25K,3dyc26,Izira,4,Mon Jul 20 15:11:36 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on your progress!  In my experience, it took about 75-90 seconds after starting a running interval for my heart rate to reach a plateau, regardless of whether I was in week 2 or week 5. So it's interesting that yours got so much higher in 3 minutes than in 90 seconds. Still, I imagine that you'll reach an equilibrium before 5 minutes. I had pretty good cardiovascular fitness from cycling fast before I got back into running, which might account for the difference.  As I understand the physiology of cardiovascular fitness, your heart rate will depend on these factors:   Your stroke volume: how much oxygenated blood the left ventricle is pumping into the aorta. As you train, this will increase as the ventricle enlarges, reducing your heart rate. The number of capillaries that your arterial system has in the muscles that are used for running. As you continue to run more, new capillaries will develop. This will get more oxygen to the muscles, requiring fewer heartbeats even with the same stroke volume. The number of mitochondria in your muscles, which affects the rate at which muscles can use the oxygen that is delivered. Fewer mitochondria means that your muscles can't use all the oxygen that is delivered, and that they have to draw more power from anaerobic sources, which tires you out. Intense exercise stimulates the formation of more mitochondria, which will make you more efficient at using the oxygen that a larger ventricle and more capillaries can deliver, reducing your heart rate.   Here's how those adaptations played out in my heart rate:  When I did C25K in winter-spring 2014, on W3D1, running at an 8:30 pace, my heart rate reached 168 in the second 3-minute running interval. On W7D1, running at an 8:40 pace, my average heart rate was 157 and it rarely went over 160. So I dropped about 10 beats per minute in 4 weeks.  Fast forward to last October: my average HR on a 5K run at a 7:57 pace was only 154. And in May, I ran 8K at a 7:51 pace with an average HR of 148. In other words, a year and a couple months after finishing C25K, my heart rate was 20 beats per minute lower than when I started, and I'm going much faster. It has been a bit higher lately, but that's due to heat and humidity.  During the same time frame, my resting heart rate dropped from the high 50s to the mid 40s.  In short: I think that if you are medically cleared to run at a high HR, and you can tough it out for a bit, your HR will begin to drop as you adapt. I would not advise extra running days; adaptations require rest. If possible, do most of your running at a conversational pace.  Tl;dr: If you keep on doing the program, and your swimming, weights, etc., without extra running, your heart, capillaries, and muscles will adapt in ways that will work to lower your heart rate at the same perceived effort.  Good luck!"
C25K,3dyc26,brianogilvie,2,Mon Jul 20 16:11:05 2015 UTC,"Do you lovely people have any thoughts?   My suggestion would be to return to walking when your heart rate gets uncomfortably high, rather than push through and make yourself ill.  There's nothing wrong with doing run/walk (even during a 5k) :)"
C25K,3dyc26,freebsdbug,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:52:33 2015 UTC,"I find if I do a much longer warm up than most people need, it makes a huge difference.  I will often walk a slow pace for 5-10 minutes and then slowly up that pace to a good stride for another 5-10. Then I get to the running program. Makes a huge difference."
C25K,3dy677,askheidi,6,Mon Jul 20 14:26:45 2015 UTC,"I'm on a phone so this will be basic:  I run on the balls of my feet (some people prefer heel-toe rolling especially for long distances but my feet don't agree with that) - choose whichever method feels better for you, but try to be light on your feet. You don't want to be stomping, this will hurt you and waste energy.   You should always be inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. This helps retain moisture (your mouth will dry if you breath in with your mouth) and is more efficient oxygen wise. It also helps you establish a rhythm.  Your arms should be moving pretty much parallel to your body - not crossing in front of your chest or stomach. The more you drive your arms the better flow you will have and it will be easier to breath.   Try to keep your head up - I always focus something off in the distance. This helps so you don't run into things or people, gives you a goal to get to, and I personally think it helps keep my energy up.   If you're going up a hill, raising your knees higher than normal will help you get up faster using less energy.  Try not to eat directly before a run, it can upset your stomach and make it more difficult. Keep hydrated though, but don't drink a bucket of water during a run either.  Avoid running in high heat (if you live in a hot area the morning or evenings are your friend). Dress appropriately!   Don't skimp on your running shoes, bad ones without proper support can wreck your feet, ankles and knees.   Hope this helps!"
C25K,3dy677,nyuda,2,Mon Jul 20 15:45:36 2015 UTC,VERY helpful - particularly the breathing and the tip to keep my head up. Both of those are things I have never paid attention to and I realize I am not doing with any sort of focus.
C25K,3dy677,freebsdbug,5,Mon Jul 20 16:22:22 2015 UTC,"Have any of you found a basic how-to on running?   Yes and it was the worst thing ever for me.  Why, you ask?  Because I focused on minutiae when my problem wasn't with the minutiae.  Right off the bat, I can tell you that you are running too fast.    Run slower.   You should be able to carry on a conversation."
C25K,3dy677,freebsdbug,2,Mon Jul 20 16:08:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I'm already pretty slow by MPH standards but I still can't carry on a conversation. Really, I probably have to just start with faster walking. :("
C25K,3dy677,AptCasaNova,2,Mon Jul 20 16:23:40 2015 UTC,"I'm already pretty slow by MPH standards   There aren't really standards though, other than what you set for yourself :)  Out of curiosity, what's your per mile pace?"
C25K,3dy677,10bayerl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:43:01 2015 UTC,48 minutes is my average 5k. I probably walk half and run half so the running portion is 11 mph?
C25K,3dy677,10bayerl,2,Mon Jul 20 17:53:33 2015 UTC,Stop paying attention to that.  Just do the intervals for that run and give yourself a pat on the back when you complete it.  You'll slowly get faster on your own.
C25K,3dy677,Extinct_Reptile,3,Mon Jul 20 19:10:19 2015 UTC,"Hi there! I think I can help. When I started C25K I was a hot mess. I would be winded to the point of nausea in like 3 minutes. I would get side stitches. I hated everything and I hated that I couldn't run like a normal freaking person.  I don't know what you do for a living, but I am an actor. We spend a lot of time thinking about breath. Do you know how to breathe properly? Your chest and shoulders should never rise. Just your rib cage expanding. Take in that air and hold it for as long as you can comfortably. Fill up your rib cage as much as you can. Try to fill up the space your ribs take up in your back too. Then blow it out.   I wasn't breathing. I would get all huffy and then be out of breath like a minute in, but I really wasn't. I don't know why it was happening. My first few jogs with C25K I practiced breathing properly and voila! It worked. If you are getting winded but don't really feel that tired or like you went that far, and feel like you should be able to do better...I bet breathing properly could really help you! Even when I've been running for thirty minutes I still force myself to breathe in, expand my rib cage, hold that for 2-3 seconds, and exhale as slowly as possible. If I can't do that, I slow down.   (Also, turns out all you need to fix side stitches is more water. )"
C25K,3dy677,brianogilvie,2,Mon Jul 20 20:09:00 2015 UTC,SUPER cool advice! I never think of my breathing (except how hard it was to do) when running. I sit at a desk all day so I know my stamina sucks but I do like yoga and concentrating on breathing while doing the poses is something I've been consciously working on lately. Knowing that taking that to running will help makes me feel like I can do it and think of it as bettering my yoga practice at the same time. Thank you.
C25K,3dy677,brab74,2,Mon Jul 20 20:13:37 2015 UTC,Yay I'm so glad you think it will help! Report back and let me know if it does. Honestly I don't think I would have gotten through if I wasn't constantly checking in with my breathing. You're gonna do great!
C25K,3dy677,mpchaplin,2,Tue Jul 21 06:21:14 2015 UTC,"I don't have a truck load of advise but I believe these small things can help you go on the distance this time:   Take it very slow. You don't want to speed up un-necessarily. Take small strides. While running, don't take huge strides as they tend to expend more energy. And, smaller strides also works out your calves better. Proper breathing technique. Try to breath with your nose for the most of your run. You may also want to search breathing techniques on youtube. Drink a lot of water. Trust me it helps your stamina in a huge way. While running try to keep your shoulders as relaxed as possible. You don't want your shoulders to rise up and cling to your necks. Maintain calm throughout the day. This basically makes your heart beat more efficiently and makes it less stressed during the day. This adds further mileage to your actual run. This is the most important. Adopt a healthy lifestyle. Your quality of runs and fitness is the true reflection of your lifestyle.   Keep running runner."
C25K,3dy677,AptCasaNova,2,Mon Jul 20 15:52:55 2015 UTC,"The FAQ from /r/running is a great resource. If you check it out under Getting Started, you'll find a link on running form. Check it out. It's very useful.  If you feel like your chest is going to burst, slow down and work on synchronizing your breathing with your steps. Most of your runs should be done at a speed that allows you to talk comfortably in complete sentences.  Good luck!"

I'm going to visit family all next week and was hoping to get W6 started before leaving but it might have to be put on hold.  Blerg.  I went from being so happy I made the last few minutes to totally distraught when I got off the treadmill and the pain set in.  First injury of C25K, check!"
C25K,3dzpnl,fruxzak,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:01:39 2015 UTC,"I just finished W5D3 this morning. I didn't think I was going to be able to do it. I was sure it would be my first incomplete workout. Even up to the 18th minute of running I didn't think I was going to be able to finish. And somehow I did it. This week was entirely mental. Pure WILLPOWER. Do you know the thought that got me through the final few minutes? Knowing that Week 6 I get to go back to intervals, but if I didn't complete the 20 minutes today I'd have to redo it next workout, and I was having none of that!  I don't know what advice I have other than pour your heart and soul into it! Good Luck!"
C25K,3dzpnl,garlicrainbow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:21:13 2015 UTC,"You can do it :) Have faith in yourself and have faith in C25k. Each week you've slowly been increasing time and increasing the distance. In going from W4 to W5 you keep the distance the same, but remove the walking intervals. So it's not as big of a jump as you think.   In truth the hardest part about W5D3 is the mental aspect. So the best advices is don't worry about W5D3. Go out and run D1 and D2 as normal. Then when W5D3 comes about go slow and do what you can. Take a walking break if needed.   If you finish then great. If you take a walking then great. You still worked out and you're making progress. Just repeat W5 if needed. I'm willing to bet that you won't need that break."

C25K,3dyrv5,freebsdbug,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:56:19 2015 UTC,Go for a walk for 30-60 mins and imagine running. In less than 9 weeks you'll be doing it!
C25K,3dyrv5,MartzReddit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:13:32 2015 UTC,"It's not just about following a program.

Lastly: read about other's experiences here on this sub."
C25K,3dyrv5,Tawtwo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:44:38 2015 UTC,"It will probably take some trial and error to find a routine that works for you, so try not to get disheartened or frustrated if it seems hard at first. If getting up for a run first thing in the morning is too hard, switch it up and try going in the evening instead. If you feel faint or dizzy during your run, try having a small snack and some water before you head out - some people do better on an empty stomach, some people need more fuel. The key is getting a routine that's sustainable for you. A mistake that a lot of people make is wanting to start exercising, thinking that means getting up at the crack of dawn to go for a run, followed by a protein smoothie and a spin class - you might be able to do that for a week or two, but you likely won't be able to stick with that kind of routine long term. So ease in to it and just figure out something that you'll be able to keep doing for a long time (it took me a while to just accept that getting up at 6am for a run was not realistic for me. I go for my runs after work now and it's much easier for me to keep up with).  That's my two cents!"

C25K,3dwu6b,KZISME,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:53:22 2015 UTC,I'm no expert but just keep running 3 times a week... Your time will naturally improve... If by September your time isn't where you want it to be then maybe start doing a day of sprint intervals.. (Possibly doing the c25k again but with sprint/jog instead of jog/walk...  Edit... The best advice I can give is to get of the treadmill and get on the road...
C25K,3dwu6b,JonWhiteFanged,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:16:24 2015 UTC,"If you are planning on doing a race, you'll need to start conditioning your body for road running. Time to put the 'continent'... err convenience, aside and find yourself a place to run on a surface that is close to what your 5k will be on! For bonus points, try to get some suitable uphill & downhill parts on your route if possible. Running up and down slopes is a particular skill that needs practice.   When you first start running on hard surface, be careful to listen to your body. You may need to back off your pace. Also, because you're not on the treadmill any more, a GPS running app would be ideal to help you with your pacing.  Don't forget to build in a stretching routine for after every run, no exceptions, and you may also need properly fitted shoes.  If the transition from treadmill to road is difficult on your body, you may even want to start at Week 6 and work your way back up.  Either way, worry about pace after you have transitioned to road running."
C25K,3dwu6b,alotmorealots,2,Mon Jul 20 12:10:59 2015 UTC,Any tips or tricks on pacing yourself?  I would assume that will be the most challenging part.    EDIT:   Fixed the type (sorry was on mobile)
C25K,3dwu6b,mrgreencannabis,0,Mon Jul 20 13:08:36 2015 UTC,Start C25K again but at 6.5mph. Once you've finished that you'll be able to run 5k in 29 minutes!
C25K,3dv5mr,Electropura__,4,Sun Jul 19 19:53:17 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on finishing!  I just decided that I would keep running because I enjoy it and it's good for my health. I also cycle, so I have kept running 3 or 4 days a week, and almost never two days in a row. I did sign up for a 5K race in the spring and set a decent PR (21:44) which I might try to beat at the same race next spring.  I did set goals: work up to 5 miles/8 km for my regular runs, with a long run up to 10 miles/16 km. I'm at that point now. I might extend the long run farther, but right now I'm more focused on long bike rides.  Other people find that entering races regularly is the best way to motivate themselves. My sister-in-law runs more when she's training for an event. Or they decide to start running more often. The ""Running 'Order of Operations'"" document on the sidebar of /r/running is useful if you want to go that route. Some people run daily, but since the number of days that you have run in a row, without a break, is the second best predictor of getting a running injury [1], I think it's wise to take at least one rest day a week unless you're one of the lucky few with legs of iron.  [1] I think my source for that is Owen Anderson, Running Science. The best predictor is having been injured before; it's best to avoid injuries."

You might even make one of those weeks a week with three 20-minute runs, to give your body a rest, though with only three runs a week, it's not a necessity. After that, either work up to 10K on one of your runs, or head over to /r/running and check out the ""Order of Operations"" document on the sidebar. Hal Higdon's programs are also popular; the basic programs are available free on his website."

C25K,3dw62p,o_jax,3,Mon Jul 20 01:07:47 2015 UTC,"As general recommendation, if you are rehabilitating a foot or leg injury, I suggest working your way up to walking three times a week for 40 minutes uninterrupted before you start C25k.  If you can't do that, then you aren't ready for C25k, because the first week is 5 mins warm up walk + ~30 mins walk with a few short runs + 5 mins cool down walk.  In many cases, this isn't about your cardiovascular fitness, it's developing sufficient robustness in your legs and feet.   I had new orthotics in my shoes   Who prescribed these orthotics? And why are your wearing them to begin with?   What can I do to heal this injury?    Maybe wise to seek professional advice?"
C25K,3dw62p,alotmorealots,2,Mon Jul 20 01:34:40 2015 UTC,"The orthotics are interesting....they were prescribed by my GP - but I asked for them. They were moulded by a tech (not a physician/orthopedic surg).  The tech noted I didnt have any huge issues, but maybe a bit of a high arch.  The reason I went in the first place was because my feet would get super fatigued after walking for 30-40 minutes the odd time I would go to the mall.  In hindsight - I feel as though this was more a factor of my legs/feet having been deconditioned after 4 years of working a new sedentary job....it was over this time I gained the 15-20lbs."
C25K,3dw62p,CrazyLegs17,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:33:19 2015 UTC,"I second the notion to start walking prior to starting the C25K program.  It may be worth visiting a running store to have a gait analysis and pick up dedicated shoes, especially if you are uncertain about the orthotics.  Start small and gradually build up time/distance.  Every walk or run is a success along the way to your end goals."

C25K,3dtyst,NoTraceNotOneCarton,3,Sun Jul 19 13:09:37 2015 UTC,"I started C25k in early May. This morning I ran my first 5k without stopping once. You can DEFINITELY do it.  Don't focus on the eventual distance - that'll just overwhelm you. Just stick to the plan and you'll find you can run further and further every time. Slow right down, take your rest days and remember that it's mainly a mental hurdle. Good luck, I know you'll be great!"
C25K,3dtyst,thunder_marbles,2,Sun Jul 19 13:56:08 2015 UTC,Were you fit before you started?
C25K,3dtyst,thunder_marbles,2,Sun Jul 19 14:03:02 2015 UTC,"Hell no - before this, I've never stuck to any kind of exercise in my life. I had to cheat during W1D1 of the plan because by the 4th 60 second running interval it was too much for me and I was wheezing all over the place! You'll see improvements quickly, trust me :)"
C25K,3dtyst,CogSciComputation,2,Sun Jul 19 14:17:10 2015 UTC,"The two most important aspects of C25K are consistency followed by rest days. If your goal is to run the 5k without walking, but you're okay with ignoring your time, this is an easily achievable goal. Some of us post about running a 5k (or for 30 minutes) as early as week 7. So here goes.   Start on the last day of week 3. If you complete it, rest for one day and begin week 4. Week 4 is often said to be the most physically challenging week and I'd really hesitate to recommend anyone start at it without ensuring they can do week 3. Week 5, day 3 is also cited as the most psychologically challenging day. You go from running intervals to running for 20 minutes. Know ahead of time that if you've faithfully completed from the end of week 3 to week 5, day 2, you can physically do W5D3, it's all about your attitude and desire to not quit. If W5D3 went very smoothly for you, and you are time-crunched, you can try to skip W6D1 and W6D2. I have a very hard time recommending this, though I did do it so it is possible. Slow down. The way many (most) of us progress through this program is by slowing down a little each week as we progress forward. If you run outdoors, constantly remind yourself to slow down. After week 3, I found it impossible to skip rest days. I also now feel dumb for skipping any rest days. Try not to run on consecutive days (until you've finished the program and have a good base). Running on consecutive days will make it easier for you to fail and much more likely for you to be injured. Run in the early morning or late evening when it's coolest out (if you're a treadmill runner, you can most likely ignore this). Get fitted for a good pair of running shoes. Go to a real running store that can do all the fancy tests and then spend $90-$150 on a pair of shoes that will fit you. No, you don't have to do this. Yes, you are almost guaranteed to see a huge difference if you do. Stretch! Stretch, stretch, stretch. Also consider foam rolling at least once a week. These two things will absolutely help you on your way (reducing the chance of failure and injury). Consistency! You have enough time to complete the program starting at week 3. You should also know that if you pace yourself, train properly, take rest days, and overall follow the program, you will most likely be able to run a 5k before the program is over. You'll need a few rest days before hand and afterward, as well as the knowledge that you'll hate yourself, but it's entirely doable.   Finally, get started. The only time that you've really failed C25K is when you quit. Start slow on week 3, and trust that you will succeed in C25K if you're consistent and adhere to rest days.  Good luck and keep us updated! Post with questions, to ask for advice, or to let us know how you're progressing. :-)  Edit: I started this about 80-90lbs overweight. I've dropped 15lbs and gained a ton of muscle. This program is entirely doable if you're willing to trust it."
C25K,3dtyst,schencker,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:30:28 2015 UTC,"it doesn't feel like a steady improvement (some days I do great, then a couple days later, I can't do half of what I did).   Well, first of all, fitness is not a linear process! Here are six of my distances (in miles) from W2 and W3:  2.36  2.29  2.42  2.24  2.09  2.13  They go up and down like that all the time, and what's weirder is that I thought I'd gone as slow as possible on the day I got 2.24 miles, but I felt like I'd kept up a good pace when I got 2.09 miles. I've stopped using distances and pace as measures of how good the run was because for me, C25K is about building fitness, endurance, and strength. I tend to put a lot more stock in how I felt physically - could I keep a steady breathing rhythm, did I feel comfortable, was I focused on form, things like that.  Based on what you've said, it seems like your goal is to complete a 5K without walking. That's a good, reasonable goal! I was listening to a podcast that said you should inhale for 4 strides and exhale for 4 strides (or whatever's comfortable for you), and that if you can't maintain that breathing rhythm, it means your pace is too quick. I found for myself that I inhale for ~3 strides and exhale in ~2 - maybe not ideal, but I no longer feel like I'm struggling to breathe. (In fact, the day I put a lot of emphasis on this rhythm was the day I got 2.24 miles and felt like I'd gone very slowly!)  Another thing I noticed is that your thought process seems a little negative, especially when you say that you know you won't finish a 5K or you can't finish a running interval. I'm not saying you're wrong, necessarily, but I think ""know"" is a strong word. Maybe if you tried changing it to ""think,"" you'd have a better time challenging yourself, and you might be surprised with the results!  The mental component is at least half the battle for me (probably more). I notice that almost immediately after a negative thought crosses my mind, running gets more difficult, but encouraging and positive thoughts make it a little easier. I personally think a lot about ""it doesn't matter how fast you go as long as you're moving forward,"" which is a paraphrase of that inspirational quote you see around. I've also been thinking about this post, especially someone's comment about ""in 5 weeks, I'll be able to run faster, but you'll still be a bitch.""  In the end, fitness is a lifestyle, not an end goal! If you don't finish the 5K without walking, it's okay. You're still building fitness 100% faster than everyone who stayed home instead, and you'll be able to build on top of that until you are able to complete a 5K. It sounds like you have a supportive friend who wants to run with you, and I'm sure s/he would agreed with me! If you don't finish this 5K, you'll surely finish the next.  Good luck! :)"

C25K,3dpdsu,jarthus,3,Sat Jul 18 05:58:22 2015 UTC,"Weight loss is mostly diet. I use myfitnesspal (it's an app! If you get it, add me! Same username!) to count calories and track what I'm eating. The nice thing is that you can also put in exercise to ""earn"" additional calories. It's a pretty great app and I've lost ~75lbs from highest starting to current, not counting the times I went back up and back down a bit (I gained back almost 30lbs while at my second job! Yikes!)    But the running does help me feel better even if it's not a weight loss miracle. I feel more energized in general the days after I run. I just have more stamina and feel healthier. Even if it is a placebo effect.    The point is, focus on your diet and let the exercise be an enhancement to that rather than relying primarily on exercise to get the job done. Because it won't."

I tried to run one foot in front of the other like there was done huge invisible tightrope under me. Turns out, you are supposed to keep your feed on their respective sides. Also, I was heel striking a lot, and then I'd Change it when it start to hurt and toe strike (or front foot? Whatever) which was also way no good. You wanna land as evenly on the front and back of your foot as possible.   Also, after my cool down, I try to sit down and elevate my feet for 5-10 minutes. When I was in the workout room, I would put my feet up on the thigh exercise lift machine thing. Now that I'm outside, I sit in the street and put my feet up in the curb.

Having said that, I remember reading from a top post on this sub that a 10 degree difference in temperature (and comparable difference in humidity) is the difference between running a 5k and a 10k. Add in a host of other issues (like you mentioned) and it's easy to reason why outdoors is more difficult than a treadmill.  Having said that, if you prepare and pace yourself (just keep slowing yourself down), you'll get back to your twenty minutes in a very short period of time. I had to transition to treadmill running because both of my routes had a ""killer hill"" at about the 26 and 28 minute parts. I'm going for W9D2 today and my plan is to transition back to the outdoors. I'm going to run along a coastal highway with the ocean on one side (and its gloomy, rainy, thunderstormy today). Wish me luck!  And I wish you luck. You'll be able to transition quickly and it's not as bad as it seems even if it seems like you can only do 1 minute on a track.

I'm hoping to drop 12-15lbs a month over the next 5-6 and I should be at my goal weight around the same time I start the half-marathon.  Life never works out the way we plan it, but as long as I'm careful, I should be able to avoid injuries and keep going. We'll see!  Do you have (short)long-term goals in mind?"

Last summer i started this and developed bursitis in both my knees by week 2 or 3, which sidelined me for the summer. I've just finished week 5 now and it's going great and pain free. You'll get there!"

I figured it was shin splints, and so far have been able to stretch my foot by pointing my foot and gently pulling my toes to curl inwards. This has helped, and I no longer get pain in my shins."
C25K,3dr5u6,Tchaikoffee,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:41:49 2015 UTC,"For me, the W3 -> W4 transition was far more difficult than W4 -> W5. It's really not bad at all once you understand the objective of the weeks and their transitions. W3 -> W4 is all about reaching a physical peak. It's literally about pushing yourself as hard as you can physically.  If you can physically do W4, you can physically do W5.  The objective of W4 -> W5 is all about overcoming a mental block. This is really the first week (since W1) where you have to face this psychological barrier. This is especially true of W5D3; literally, all you need to do is not stop. Let your body tell you to stop but don't stop*. Curse, grumble, yell at yourself, tell yourself just one more minute (repeatedly... lol), do whatever you need to do to keep going.   Because you don't need to stop. You only think you do, you want to, it's so appealing.  But C25K is about completing goals, running days, crushing minutes and this is the psychological test that asks you if you're ready to keep going and finish the program.  Here's a bit of a well-kept secret around these parts, W5D3 is the last big ""jump"" or scary challenge of the program. W6, W7, W8, and W9 are all just comfort runs asking you to go just a little further (and it's exciting!) The last four weeks are all just ""let's have fun and do better because I can and I know I can.""  So I'll leave you with one piece of advice. For W5D3 (and subsequent weeks, 6, 7, & 8), slow down from the very beginning. This is a marathon, not a sprint, and the distance is not important. Also, if you're running outside, every time you become conscious of wanting to stop, slow down again. You'll most likely have sped up a little (sounds strange but always happens to me!)  Good luck, keep us updated, and we will offer every bit of support, advice, and encouragement we can!  * Always stop if there's an injury (listen to your body). But if it's general sluggishness and feeling tired, push through it!"
C25K,3dr5u6,CogSciComputation,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:09:26 2015 UTC,"I actually found the jump from W3 to W4 (9 minutes of running to 16 minutes) a lot harder than going from W4 to W5. You actually run less on W5D1 than on W4D3, the same amount on W5D2, and 4 minutes longer on W5D3. It's just that the time is distributed differently.  Go a bit slower than you did on W4, keep the pace conversational, and if it helps, break the long intervals mentally into a few shorter ones. E.g. on W5D3, don't think ""OMG I have 20 minutes before I can stop!""; think, ""OK, I know I can do 5 minutes. Let's see if I can do 10. OK, now let's try the next 5 minutes. Hey, only 5 more minutes and I'm done!""  You can do it!"
C25K,3dr5u6,brianogilvie,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:10:15 2015 UTC,"I failed once or twice. I was only making it around 15 - 17 minutes. It was a mix of physical exhaustion and weak willpower - the temptation of slowing to a walk, it's too easy.  For me, the key was slowing down my pace, from beginning to end. I lowered my cadence (for better or worse), and really focused on endurance. I didn't care if I ultimately went for a lesser distance than usual - I just wanted to jog it non-stop."
C25K,3dqsf6,Flying_Hellfish,2,Sat Jul 18 15:38:53 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on finishing the week!  If your lungs are feeling overtaxed, you may be running too fast. You should do the running intervals at a pace where you can still talk in complete sentences. Try slowing down a bit. If your cardiovascular fitness is very limited, that might not be possible—but in that case, the running intervals will improve it significantly in a short time."
C25K,3dqsf6,brianogilvie,2,Sat Jul 18 22:55:16 2015 UTC,"I think this is exactly it, I've slowed my jog pace average from 5:30/mi to 7:40/mi and it's enough to get me through and I actually did W2D1 last night.  :)"
C25K,3dqsf6,brianogilvie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:55:21 2015 UTC,"A mile pace of 7:40 is already pretty fast, especially for a beginner. How old are you?"
C25K,3dqsf6,brianogilvie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:33:50 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to slow it down a bit more. I walk fast, talk fast, etc so it's hard to slow anything down.  I'm 36."
C25K,3dqsf6,brianogilvie,2,Tue Jul 21 17:51:00 2015 UTC,"The risk of starting out too fast in the early weeks is that your pace may not be sustainable in later weeks. 60 and 90 second intervals are short enough that you can do them with a lot of your energy coming from anaerobic pathways, but that gets harder and harder with each passing week. If you run solo, as I think most C25K'ers do, try carrying on a conversation with yourself, out loud, to ensure that you're not going too fast.  If you can sustain the 7:40 pace over a longer distance as a 36-year-old beginner, you have a shot at being pretty fast once you have built up an aerobic base."
C25K,3dqsf6,monkeysentinel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:10:18 2015 UTC,I fully agree I just need to find a comfortable pace.  I'm more concerned with sticking this out the 9 weeks than speed but it's really hard to slow myself down.  I'm going to try the talking to myself method and see if I can get h this sorted.
C25K,3dqsf6,moneya1,2,Tue Jul 21 19:48:16 2015 UTC,"If you have a slower friend who would like to give C25K a try, you could run with him or her. Running with my sister-in-law slows me down and gives her a good workout."
C25K,3drek1,thiyagaraj,2,Sat Jul 18 18:56:04 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on finishing the 5K! Now you have a personal record (PR) to beat next time.  I think a better plan to work on speed would be the following:   For the next 3 weeks, run 30 minutes three times a week. In the 4th week, ease off and do three 20-minute runs. (Your body benefits from cutting back every 3rd or 4th week, to allow time for recovery.) After that, make one run your long run. Continue to run 30 minutes twice a week, but add 5 minutes to your long run each week until you reach 45 minutes. The following week, ease off, with three 25-minute runs. If you feel like it, add 5 more minutes each week to your long run, until you're at 60 minutes.   The long runs will improve your endurance, but they'll also make you faster at the shorter distances. You should run them at a conversational pace, so you can easily talk in complete sentences. (But if you can sing, speed up!)  Once you've been running for 6 months or so, then it's OK to add interval training or hill repeats for speed. Before that, though, I advise against it; it's too much stress on the legs for a new runner."

C25K,3dpzq2,astronomnomy,3,Sat Jul 18 09:02:52 2015 UTC,Try expending the same amount of energy in each pace when running into the wind as when running with it. Kinda like slowing down when you're running up a hill. So you'll run slower into the wind but in terms of effort you'll be at a consistent pace.

C25K,3dohjs,FauxJour,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:05:30 2015 UTC,How was your pace when you finished C25k and how it is now?
C25K,3dohjs,mvpetri,3,Sun Jul 19 01:34:59 2015 UTC,"It's kind of hard to answer because you have to understand what my training goal is.  I don't and have never run for speed.  My interest has always been in building endurance to run further, not training to run the same distance over and over faster and faster.  So I've never pushed myself ever to run a 5k in some set goal time.  That said when I finished c25k I ran my first 5k in 42 minutes.  I now know run a couple of five 5ks a week as part of my marathon training, and do them in 29 minutes every single time.  But you have to keep in mind these are the easy runs of my week that I use to recover from my middle distance (6-7 miles) and one long distance run (currently at 15 miles) a week.  So I never push myself on those 5ks.  If I did I would be in a lot of pain all the time. Even so though you can see that, just continuing to run 5ks as part of training for longer distances, you naturally get faster even if you're not trying to.  At least that is true for me, maybe not everyone has the same experience."
C25K,3dohjs,nomobooze,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:11:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  I did understand your point. Training for resistance without getting bothered with pace or other variables is totally valid! I just asked to have a reference. Reading each other experiences gives us the opportunity to look out for the possibilities, even though I might have a different experience than you.  But that's no problem. You had such a great improvement, congratulations. Your first 5k had an average of 8'24'', and your usual 5K now is 5'48''! This is huge :D"

For me, I think part of the reason is that in the first segment I have fear that I'm not going to be able to finish, but once I actually do finish, my mind stops playing tricks on me.

Also, you deserve props for walking for 6 weeks prior to C25k, that is ideal, and I think many people who struggle in the early weeks would benefit from that. Walking pre-program certainly helped me with my multiple past-running injuries.  If you could do W5D1 and W5D2 on the same day you've definitely got excellent cardiorespiratory fitness capacity, and well set to complete the program on schedule.... unless you start running program days without rest day, let alone back to back. I know that you know that you shouldn't have, but at 230 pounds, you will get an injury, and possibly one that puts you out of running for weeks. I don't mean to nag, but doing stuff like that is one of the fastest ways to ruin all the steady, measured progress you've made so far.   What's more, doing a C25k day early or ahead of schedule doesn't actually accelerate your progress. Your body can only adapt at a certain rate, and for most people the required amount of adaptation will take around 9 weeks of steadily increasing challenges. There's no way to short cut that. It's important to remember that every time you run, you are damaging your body - it's this damage that forces the adaptation, but if you pile on the damage faster than the body can repair, then that's when things get unpleasant or rip, tear and fracture.  Sorry for the negativity, but it would be a huge shame to see the good work you've done by taking it at a measured pace to date undone by over enthusiasm!   Hope I will stick around and finish it.   You absolutely have it within you to finish the program, and if you keep it up, it sounds like it's going to be time for some new pants a few sizes down!"

I should have done W3D3 on Friday and, so far, I have kept up with every single day and haven't needed to repeat a single day or anything BUT I had a really big workout the day before W3D3 and I was so tired so I decided to just do W1D1 again on Friday (did a really good pace that day too haha!).   So on Sunday I am going to be doing W4D1, even though I haven't completed W3D3. Scary, but I haven't needed to walk at any of the jog intervals in W3D1 or D2 so hopefully...

You've obviously got the required cardiovascular fitness, and your legs tolerated that degree of exertion and impact, and you have given your body the required week to make adaptations - you're ready for the next week!   Was it the lunch (and it sounds like quite the feast!) that mangled your run? Possibly, probably, but ultimately in the context of things, it doesn't matter too much. Try week 4, and if you can't complete the days, consider returning to week 3, otherwise battle on!"

Was able to do the next run fine without a stitch when I ran before dinner though.

C25K,3dm08d,FinalFacade,4,Fri Jul 17 10:28:24 2015 UTC,"I just did my w1d2 on Wednesday, I was so sore after both times. But now that it's another jog day, I find I'm regenerating quicker. First day I saw still sore from Monday but tonight I'll be ready to run.   Congrats on w1d1!"
C25K,3dm08d,kemekokitten,3,Fri Jul 17 12:25:19 2015 UTC,"Great job :) You'll see some real improvements sooner than you think, buy be wary not to ignore the rest days, they are as important as the run days.."
C25K,3dm08d,JonWhiteFanged,2,Fri Jul 17 13:30:11 2015 UTC,My calves! I woke in a stupor and couldn't figure out why my legs are fire...   I'm not overweight. I'm just sedentary. I forgot about the soreness! 😢
C25K,3dm08d,TheHannah17,2,Fri Jul 17 12:41:36 2015 UTC,"I went through the same thing on Wednesday. Had my second run last night, and no soreness today. Don't know if my body just decided to adapt really quick or a did really good stretches before my run. Don't worry about the soreness though, it shouldn't let too long!"
C25K,3dm08d,discomermaid,2,Fri Jul 17 15:33:01 2015 UTC,I am just heading into W1D3.  I was a bit sore for two days after Day 1 but I still did my day 2 with only one day rest.. I just made sure to warm up really well first.  I was more just a bit achy so I wasn't too worried.  And the next day no more soreness.
C25K,3dm08d,yankeecandle1,2,Fri Jul 17 18:02:04 2015 UTC,Soreness already gone. Superhuman status activate!

C25K,3dllbc,alotmorealots,2,Fri Jul 17 07:30:35 2015 UTC,"Dog was loose in my street, I was lucky that it didn't seem too committed and it mostly got my long sleeve. Saved by an old gentleman before it tried again.   I decided after that, that I wasn't going to let it stop me.   And thank you! I had little voices going ""Urgh. How much longer? You can't go on much longer"" the whole time. I shut those up too. :D"

C25K,3dmrvn,conkybalonky,5,Fri Jul 17 15:15:46 2015 UTC,"Well, in my last 5K there were 788 finishers. The person in the middle of the pack, the 394th finisher, had a time of 29:45. However, this was a race whose participants included a lot of college students, and which had more women than men running.  My time was 21:44. But that put me in the top 10% of all finishers, the top 18% of men, and the top 14% of men 40-55 (I'm 47). If you want a good sense of the spread in a typical 5K, take a look at the race results on the CoolRunning page (linked above) and browse several different 5Ks.  Edited to add: of course, /u/ltrem is right to say that you should be comparing yourself only with yourself. One advantage of running a fairly conservative pace on your first 5K is that it gives you a PR to beat on your second 5K. There's also the question of whether you will run together during the race or go your separate ways. If you're really aiming for a personal record, each of you will have to go at the best pace you can sustain for the race. But that probably won't be the same pace.  I should also add that I had been running for over a year before my first 5K race. When I did C25K, I hit 5K on the week 8 runs, with about a 27-minute 5K."
C25K,3dmrvn,brianogilvie,2,Fri Jul 17 17:21:38 2015 UTC,"dang you are smokin'! I'm older than you, female and teetering on the edge of the promised land of 30:00.. some day!"
C25K,3dmrvn,ltrem,2,Fri Jul 17 18:17:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Good genes, I think. It makes me regret all the time I spent in front of the TV as a kid. If only my high school gym teachers could see me now! I was the fat, uncoordinated, slow kid.  Happy cake day, BTW! Do you do speed work to peak for your priority races? That might push you over the edge."
C25K,3dmrvn,brianogilvie,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:07:49 2015 UTC,"I try.. I have too many goals I am trying to do simultaneously so I probably dont do as much as I should. My last race I was at about 18-19 minutes at a little over 2 miles.. and then the last mile I ran out of gas.. and slowed down. Too hot, too sunny and too many pounds on the old bod. I keep trying though. Tomorrow is race #11"
C25K,3dmrvn,ltrem,4,Fri Jul 17 21:22:52 2015 UTC,"There is no ""best"" time.. you should not be comparing yourself to others. The only person you should worry about is you..Your goal is to improve your own time. You may never reach the promised land of the 30 minute 5K.. that's ok.  You need to do YOUR best.. not someone else's best. :)"
C25K,3dmrvn,ltrem,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:51:27 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, and I'm nothing but encouraged by our continuing progress. Still, I like to know these things because it helps me push myself when I have more challenging, yet attainable goals. Like I said, at this point just finishing a 5K would be a tremendous milestone for me. I just can't help but challenge myself more."
C25K,3dmrvn,brianogilvie,2,Fri Jul 17 17:02:44 2015 UTC,"I think that the most useful thing to do at this point is to run your 5K moderately hard, without going all out, figure out the time you get, and then aim to improve. If you finish C25K and then start doing one long run a week (7-8K, or even more), you'll get faster at the shorter distances. After you've been running for 6 months or so, and have built up an aerobic base, you can add deliberate speed work or hill repeats.  Running fast is hard on your muscles, bones, and connective tissue. If you push too hard, too soon, you might get an overuse injury and have to take weeks off."
C25K,3dmrvn,JonWhiteFanged,2,Fri Jul 17 20:03:39 2015 UTC,That's loads of time... I haven't run a competitive 5k but my runs are usually around 28-30 mins... But as long as you are getting better month by month then it's all good :) Edit: 30M here
C25K,3dmrvn,SirKainey,2,Fri Jul 17 15:37:45 2015 UTC,"I'd estimate my time at my current pace to be around 25-30 minutes. However, it'd probably be closer to 35 minutes.  28M 180lb/82kg 5ft 11"""
C25K,3dmrvn,FlipQuarters,2,Fri Jul 17 15:39:05 2015 UTC,"I've read that 30 minutes is a good standard because it would be 3 10 minute miles. Personally I'm shooting initially for 36, because a 12 minute mile is a reasonable, achievable pace for me currently for 1 mile."
C25K,3dmrvn,Jimbo516,0,Fri Jul 17 16:05:52 2015 UTC,"The main thing is to do it without stopping to walk.  If you can achieve this, you'll easily do sub-45 mins.  I think you'll surprise yourselves with your pace - you will likely break 30 mins by December if you keep running between now and then."

C25K,3dm5fy,Leegos,2,Fri Jul 17 11:41:54 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you should repeat the day (or week if you prefer) but slow it down. It is all about increasing your endurance, if you can't speak easily while running then you are going to fast. Don't worry about what you think other people think, it's all about what is best for you, and that is to keep it slow :)"
C25K,3dm5fy,JonWhiteFanged,2,Fri Jul 17 13:44:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  :) really appreciate the advice!  Little extra detail in my other reply but yea it seems that's the idea, just need to slow my pace a bit!"
C25K,3dm5fy,LindySquirrel,2,Fri Jul 17 21:13:06 2015 UTC,"I would absolutely repeat! I just finished up week 6 today, and I started the program back in March. I repeated days or weeks if I really struggled. When I pushed too hard it hurt my knee and then had to take time off. Slow down your pace, think slow cooker. It's more about endurance building than speed. Remember, the goal is to run for 30 minutes, not run fast, that will come later.  Let your body adjust to the activity. I recommend repeating until you can complete the day without needing to walk. You'll have a much better sense of accomplishment when you can nail week 2 day 1 because you put in your time now. I actually enjoy running now. Don't rush through the program and feel miserable because it's such a struggle."
C25K,3dm5fy,Ermahgerdrerdert,2,Fri Jul 17 14:13:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Really appreciate the advice :) it's hard, I played soccer for a long time and I'm so used to running at the pace I've been jogging with it's hard to escape.  Hopefully slowing down will really help me out and give my muscles time to adjust :D"
C25K,3dma7b,CiCi_,5,Fri Jul 17 12:38:27 2015 UTC,"Seriously, don't worry about speed until after the program is finished. It is all about building endurance in your muscles and, more importantly, your tendons and ligaments. Pushing too hard will only set you back. Just ignore the pace and focus on the time. Personally I don't think the apps should show pace as it can be disheartening, but trust me, after regular slow runs you'll find your pace increasing naturally."

I run my first 5K this Saturday, then on Monday I'm going straight to Couch to 10K Week 10 since the first half is basically just C25K. I had scheduled a 10K run for 8/15 but my husband moved our vacation flight to 10:00 that morning (first world problems).   After 4 weeks of C210K I'm moving on to half marathon training by increasing my running distance by 10% each week. I would like to run a half sometime in October. After the half, I will continue to increase my distance by 10% until I am ready for a full marathon sometime next year.  Finally, I will begin half Triathlon training using an app, then a full. If I stick to my training then I will participate in a triathlon in April 2016. I have a long and difficult road to travel but I am determined!"

It's a 6 week 10k program that is supposed to start right after done C25K.  I've got my sights set on doing a 10k after I'm done this program.  There is a big loop around where I live that starting from the store at the front of the sub-division is 11km.  Would like to be able to do that twice a month.

C25K,3dm768,Raywes88,8,Fri Jul 17 13:36:58 2015 UTC,This week I ran 19 full minutes without pausing. Then I paused for 30 seconds and then I ran the rest. I ran the last 1.5 minutes sprinting and running as hard as I ever have in my entire life.   That is the first time I was able to make it past 10 minutes without pausing. I ran for 19 fucking minutes without even stopping. I ran to a place that I couldn't even see from where I started. I ran across a fucking river. I never thought I could be a person that could run. That was always something that sounded nice for other people but that's just not something I can do.... until now.  I am a different person now. The same but different. I feel like I am physically changed and I wonder if people can tell when they look at me that I am new.

C25K,3dm768,bluejacket1989,2,Fri Jul 17 15:14:01 2015 UTC,It's totally doable!  Just start really slow.  By the 3rd run you can speed up if you want to.
C25K,3dm768,MissVancouver,7,Fri Jul 17 18:13:13 2015 UTC,"I've always HATED running and thought I just couldn't do it. I have vivid memories of sitting in my middle school science classroom, staring out the window at the cones set up for the mile run, and desperately praying for rain or some miracle to happen so I wouldn't have to run. It gave me CRAZY anxiety because, while not overweight or anything, I was just so bad at it. And I had social anxiety issues, so I hated that everyone could see how bad I was.  However...it's some 18 years later now, and about three weeks ago I decided to start working on more meaningful exercise than just walking the dogs. I tried just jogging/walking at random intervals for ~2 miles. It didn't go great. Crazy out of breath, super sore for a couple days. I started c25k the next time I went out a couple days later - much better! I like structure. Did week 1 for two days, went on to week 2. Somehow, it wasn't too difficult! Okay! I decided, after a day of week 2, to try week 3. This was more of a challenge, but at the last three minute interval, I actually stretched it out to 5 minutes, until I was at the end of my path. Then, my husband actually decided to come out with me for the next day of week 3, and we went out again two days later and tried week 4. I did week 4 again today solo, and it felt great! My heart rate is staying lower each time I run, and I'm actually finding that I CAN run, which is just insane to me.  Bonus: My husband is definitely the more fit of the two of us, so hearing him huffing and puffing behind me gives me motivation - it shows me that the fatigue I'm feeling is normal, and I don't have to be ashamed. So, this was long, but I'm pretty stoked on this! Now I just worry because my 2 mile loop is getting to not be enough space for me to do the entire runs, so I'm going to have to re-think my route!"

Yesterday I ran 4.3K in 35 minutes. Getting closer to that 5K mark.  I've started to scratch the surface of Stronglifts 5x5 ... I'm hoping the strength training will improve my knees' stability.

C25K,3dm768,schencker,3,Fri Jul 17 18:11:47 2015 UTC,"I run W9D2 tomorrow. My last few runs have each had a few obstacles (or problems that I created accidentally) to say the least; increased heat and humidity, heavier clothing, more layers of clothing, missed a pre-stretch (do not recommend!), no water, and a few other little things.  Having said that, I'm at a 5.6mph pace and I feel confident I'll hit 6mph within 2-3 weeks which is my overall goal. Then it's all about distance (2-3 normal runs a week and one long run, upping the distance by .5-1 mile per week depending on how I feel, or 5-10 minutes depending on my speed).  Also going to slowly migrate some of my time over to /r/loseit and drop the extra weight. :-D Thank you everyone for posting inspirational messages, great selfies, fun anecdotes, and even discussing the hard days and how to make them easier."

C25K,3dm768,lhld,2,Sat Jul 18 16:19:05 2015 UTC,"I had the same problem initially - By week 4 my runs were >5km so had to keep finding longer routes.  First I had to stop taking the shortcut across the creek and take the long way around.  Then I had to do the same thing coming back home. Fortunately I live near a series of streets that has lots of parallel streets so I can just keep going one street further based on when the cooldown starts.  If it really becomes a problem towards later weeks I'll just do laps around the lake, which is almost 1km exactly.  Problem is I keep injuring myself, pulling my calf :(  Wish I could somehow figure out what's causing that and put a stop to it or I'd be happily running almost 7km each time by now.  The dogs, however... yeah, they don't like week 5."

I wanted to minimize soreness by running on a soft surface rather than a pavement - in Central Park, runners have basically ""paved"" a dirt path that runs parallel to the main road. I've seen lots of runners run on it, so I thought hey, I'll just run on that dirt path! Well, bad idea. I was on the last leg of my run, so I was already pretty tired and not able to dodge all the tree roots woven into the dirt path. Face plant! It was pretty bad, it took almost all my breath away. But! I got back up and ran away from the crime scene lol.  It hit me then, that I was thinking ""phew thank god I only have 8 minutes left."" Like, what? 8 weeks ago I was spent after 8 1-minute intervals!! Seriously, I can't believe it. C25K is amazing.  Picture is of my sausage arm lol, with dirt and a tiny, tiny, tiny bit of blood on it. Ok not really it was only a scratch, but dirt and blood sounds so cool.  Thanks to everyone on this sub!!!!"

You might see more data usage at the end of the runs when it uploads the recorded data. Easy fix is to disable mobile data for it and only allow syncing over WiFi.

The weight training I'm doing consists of chest-day, shoulder/back day, and arm day.  I'm ""skipping leg day"" because I'm doing this run program, as well as doing muay that twice a week."

C25K,3dkw2g,Mechanicalmind,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:35:43 2015 UTC,"Hey! I'm almost on Week 4 (for reference).   As far as my routine goes:   I workout everyday. Monday is my rest day (or I might just do a 30 min walk and some yoga that day).  I currently start each new C25K week on Sunday. Wednesday= Day 2. Friday= Day 3.   I do AB Ripper X (from the p90x programme) on Tuesday and Friday and Sunday. Sunday= half reps though. I found this video YEARS ago when my friend linked it to me. Did it once, we both almost threw up (I'd never strictly worked abs before haha). So I dropped it until the start of this year. Honestly, I think it's a fantastic program and I HATE working abs but once you get into a routine with it it's just so great. A strong core is so so so important for absolutely everything (don't get back pain now). It's only 16 minutes long too! And for the first time in my life I can see real definition when I tense which is extremely encouraging.   Don't know if you have a stretching program in place? But I'd really recommend one of those considering that running can make you less flexible in some areas. I like to kill 2 birds with one stone and do Yoga every day. Fantastic if you find the right kind to build strength and flexibility. Saw heaps of people raving about 30 days of Yoga with Adriene (on youtube- free) on r/progresspics etc. and I'm really enjoying that too.   I should probably mention that I do intermittent fasting, with a 4 hour eating window, 20 hour fast each day just in case that changes anything. Never ever thought I would be someone who does it since I adoreee breakfast food but honestly it's just so much a part of my life now and it makes me so relaxed etc. I just get to have my breakfast food in the afternoon now :) Boyfriend has just started doing the same (he has an 8 hour eating window though) and he's gone from 194 lbs to 180lbs in the past 6ish weeks.  Shoes: I have worn Asics all my life, and I love them. Usually I stick with the kayano line but I hear the 21s have deviated from what they usually are so I have bought 2 cheaper Asics :)."

However, the alternations between running and jogging (20 mins in week 1) is the middle of the work out. So that 20mins does not include the 5 min warm up or 5 min cool down :)"

I also do an easy lifting routine focusing mostly on core and balance. I just started the C25K but I started in week 5 because I had some cardio built up already from biking for the last few months. Thinking about adding in some body weight exercises for upper body. Short term goal feeling fit and getting back down to 180 pounds. Getting close to 180 but still not feeling fit :).

Not a doctor and not an experienced runner so take it with a grain of salt. But here is a link to they mayo clinic on exercise intensity. http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise-intensity/art-20046887?pg=2

W1D1 was pretty difficult- also no cheating. However, I found the after effects to be the worst which kicked in on about the last repetition and was just this one massive headache; felt like someone shook my brain around and from memory- my teeth also hurt.   Any chance you can find a place without too many hills? The general advice is to slow down because we are working on endurance for at least the first round of c25k and I totally agree with that, however- hills are hard no matter how slow you are going haha.  I redid W1D1 today (had a really big workout the other day so didn't want to spend the last day of week 3 completely dead). And I did much much better compared to the first day.  For the record; W1D2 was easier than W1D1. You start to develop a real love for the program imo after W1D2. :)"

C25K,3dhzfc,cappync,3,Thu Jul 16 15:49:24 2015 UTC,"Go with the flow. Just start everyday and see how far you can go today. Maybe you get a little tired, maybe even a little pain. Is this worth stopping for? Most of the time you can tell yourself: I can go just a little further. Then ask again: am I really so tired that I have to stop? until your workout is done. It's all in the mind!"
C25K,3dhzfc,davidscrazygirl,2,Thu Jul 16 16:13:57 2015 UTC,Congrats!! I can't want to finish. This program is seriously awesome. 10K next?
C25K,3dhzfc,SirKainey,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:09:17 2015 UTC,Thanks. First I want to do some more 5k runs to improve my time. Then I will go for the 10k because it's nice to have a goal.

C25K,3djm85,EnthusiasticLlama,5,Thu Jul 16 20:17:38 2015 UTC,"Weeks 1-4 were killer.  My calves hated me and my arms even got tired from holding them in the ""running position.""  It gets easier.  Your muscles adjust, your bones and tendons harden up, and the day you find out you didn't have to focus on your breathing is pretty incredible.    That being said, take the rest days.  Running everyday will lead to over training and injury especially just starting out.  I'll be running my fourth half marathon in the upcoming months, and I train about 4 days a week.  If I train 5 days and start feeling a little sore, I take off 2 to 3 days for recovery and injury prevention.  Be patient with yourself, but have fun!  It's an amazing feeling when you finish the program.  Way to go on starting!  The hardest part is getting out the door."
C25K,3djm85,Tarable,5,Thu Jul 16 20:35:22 2015 UTC,"Respect the rest days!  They are honestly there for a reason.  When you run you injure your muscles, they need the time to heal stronger for the next time.  This program is paced really well to allow that to happen and get you where you need to be at the right rate."

You're body is literally screaming at you saying ""wtf is this you're doing to me?""  Respect the rest days man...    The only way to fail this program is to quit..."
C25K,3djm85,buttercupdefender,2,Thu Jul 16 22:09:41 2015 UTC,Best run of my program so far was the week I was actually able to put 2 recovery days between weeks. Week 5 Day 1 was my best pace and distance.

I have been using a treadmill and fighting some lower back pain since I started honestly. I have running shoes that I only use on the treadmill but I'm sure its bad form or weak core. I keep wanting to do a youtube yoga but havent yet. I feel really awesome after I finish, but it's hard to breathe when I run sometime. Do u do anything on your rest days?"
C25K,3dip5u,dubbk17,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:20:46 2015 UTC,"I had some lower back pain when I first started (I started before 4th of July and then stopped while I went on a camping trip). I'm not sure what made it better except time and working on making sure my body felt right during the jogging segments.  On my rest days I try to get up and walk (I have a desk job with overtime at the moment) at least every two hours (Usually more because of all the bathroom breaks, I drink a lot of water). If I feel up to it, I still get up early and do mostly walking with maybe a little jogging. Today, though, I just didn't have the energy so I took the extra hour for sleep instead. Sleep is so important when you're depriving your body of calories and exercising a lot.   I'm so glad to see I'm not the only bigger gal here. So nice to meet you! :)"

C25K,3djukz,um00actually,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:18:15 2015 UTC,"Nope. You still need to rest. How long you need to rest depends how hard push yourself compared to your current level of fitness. Obviously the harder you push self the longer you need to rest.   That being said, there are a number of different intermediate running programs that help you transition to the 10k. Some of these programs slowly add in a 4th or 5th day of running. (B210k does not if I recall correctly). They do this by adding a few easier runs which require less rest. So if you want to run more times a week then I'd look into a different program. But once you pick a program rest on the rest days."
C25K,3djukz,UWwolfman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:57:28 2015 UTC,B210K is ALL easy runs already though.
C25K,3djukz,UWwolfman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:03:38 2015 UTC,"The amount of stress that running puts on your body depends on both the pace you set and the distance you run. In intermediate programs like B210k you should still be setting an easy pace. However, in these programs you are pushing the distance that you run beyond your current level of fitness. And it's the fact that you are pushing the distance that puts extra stress on your body."
C25K,3djqzl,d3ny94,3,Thu Jul 16 20:51:43 2015 UTC,"Yay congrats!!! I'd say yes you are now a 5K runner!!!!🎊   Just my $0.02 though, I'd continue running per C25K schedule. You want to keep your weekly mileage on a gradual increase - remember that the goal of C25K is not only to get you to run a 5K, but also enable you to be able to run a 5K day after day.   So go out there and finish the program, knowing that you're already a 5K runner. Way to go!!!!! 🙌"

Alternatively, when it's not hot as balls and I don't need to run with water, I have a waterproof running belt that I found on Amazon (pretty cheap...maybe $11?) and it works well, too.

For this attempt at C25K (I've tried and failed twice before) I'm using the handheld camelbak chill quick grip. I don't know how people run even half an hour without water. I go through a full 20oz bottle on each run.
C25K,3dhksv,newtoleague123,3,Thu Jul 16 09:36:56 2015 UTC,"Good job for starting! Have you considered that your were trying to go too fast in the run sections? Slow it down... Take small shuffling steps, the program is not about speed, it is about getting the body used to jogging/running through endurance, you should worry about going too slow as that isn't really possible (bar just going at walking pace)  Try again soon and slow it down and control your breathing, rhythmic is the key :)  Edit: Hydration is also important like you said... Drink more water all the time, best advice I can give you for that, not just before the run but all day"
C25K,3dhksv,JonWhiteFanged,2,Thu Jul 16 09:49:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Yeah, I was trying to control my breathing by going in through my nose for 4 or so steps, then out through my mouth. I don't think I was running too fast, but taking shuffling steps hurt more than taking normal jogging steps, if that makes sense.   It hurt my shins more to take shallow steps."
C25K,3dhksv,JonWhiteFanged,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:53:08 2015 UTC,"If your shins are hurting then you may be coming down on your heels too much... Try coming down more on the ball of your foot, the steps shouldn't make a lot of noise, like a ninja :)  Edit: I know it seems like there is a lot to think about but training good habits early makes for an easier time quicker than you think..."

I don't have so much a problem with the chest but I do have problems with shins hurting. I'm going to take that suggestion someone mentioned of hitting the ball of your feet instead of the heel to help with that.   And definitely do it slow during the running parts. I bolted it on day one and paid for it on the next rest day. If I can get my legs used to it through endurance, I can sprint it after I finish the program! Or else I'll be dead come week 3."
