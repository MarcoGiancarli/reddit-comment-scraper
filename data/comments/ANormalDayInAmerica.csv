I hear people say all the time it's about ""southern heritage"" or ""states rights,"" not racism. But I think they know that's not true, they just don't want to admit it. It might not have ever been the official flag of the confederacy and rather just a ""battle flag"" but it was submitted as a possible flag to represent the confederate states which was specifically looking for a flag to represent white supremacy and there isn't a debate there. It was always intended to represent racism, not rebellion against a yankee government trying to impose their will on the states (by trying to take away their slaves). Even if that you want to symbolize pick the ""don't tread on me flag"" or something else that wasn't intended to symbolize racism. As for southern heritage, there are other ways to show this. No one shows their German heritage by flying the Nazi flag, cause everyone recognizes that doesn't symbolize Germany, it symbolizes racism. So why can't people pick something that doesn't symbol racism to show their southern heritage. It's because they knew it's truly about racism, they just don't want to admit it."
