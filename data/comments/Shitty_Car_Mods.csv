People claim they don't give a fuck but the level of care to pick the right parts and the effort to make it all work says otherwise. It's like punk culture, they say they don't care until you call them out then suddenly your the ass who doesn't get it.   IMO the guys who really don't give a shit are those kinda people who will smash a tail light in a minor fender bender and just tape it up. That's true no fucks given.

Shitty_Car_Mods,3dvwef,MyNameIsRay,2,Mon Jul 20 08:19:24 2015 UTC,Ugh. That sounds like a terrible design.
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dvwef,LordOfTheGiraffes,6,Mon Jul 20 09:44:47 2015 UTC,"It's not the design, it's just the design after a lot of wear.  The cars usually last 150-250k miles, but the key cylinders are worn smooth by about 100k most of the time.  You can start it with anything that fits all the way in, from spoon handles to keys for other cars.  There's a reason the accord/civic/integra have topped the ""most stolen"" lists for two decades (most of the cars on the list have the same problem, it's not Honda specific by any means)."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dvwef,MyNameIsRay,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:40:18 2015 UTC,"the key cylinders are worn smooth by about 100k most of the time. You can start it with anything that fits all the way in, from spoon handles to keys for other cars.   I don't thinks that's right. I've never worked with car locks, but I have a lot of experience with residential and commercial door locks and if they're anything alike being worn smooth would make them not work at all. If the pins/wafers wear out, they no longer line up properly when the key is inserted, and the cylinder can't turn.  It could be that car locks work on completely different principles, but it doesn't seem likely."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dvwef,DrunkleDick,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:11:32 2015 UTC,"If the pins on the fixed side, not the tumbler, are worn out, it can turn freely with anything small enough to not push the cylinder side pins.  Don't forget about all the tension placed on these by wheel locks, and high pressure springs designed to keep the cylinder from turning even with a keychain hanging from it. They wear differently from residential units, where the tumbler-side pins are the first to go.  I've dealt with hundreds of cars that didn't need their own key to start, from most major brands."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dvwef,micholz,2,Tue Jul 21 13:02:42 2015 UTC,"Other replies covered it already, but yeah. They'd call it a ""Master Key"" and it works for older cars. When you go to get a copy of your key you start with a blank key, Honda used a number 27 blank key. You could buy a blank key then shave it down until it was fairly narrow and smooth to make a Master Key. You insert it into the door/ignition and jiggle it while turning, the jiggling would bump all the tumblers and after a couple seconds you'd be in.  It's not limited to Honda, it's just a way to beat locks. Locksmiths have jiggler sets that do the same thing. I grew up in the car theft capital of the US, everyone knew how to do this and friends with Hondas would frequently move eachothers cars as pranks.   I built a hidden killswitch into my car and when I'd leave my car in a public parking lot I'd often pull out a fuse and unplug my car's ECU, when I was at school I'd take my ECU with me because I had a desirable one. I was still constantly afraid that my car would be stolen at any time.  This is why cars have keys with transponder chips now, so you need more than an old key to steal a modern car."

Shitty_Car_Mods,3e05bq,AKADriver,-1,Mon Jul 20 23:16:25 2015 UTC,"No, it probably has the iron headed one like a cop car, Corvette never had that version.  It isn't even a Chevy, that is a Buick or Oldsmobile with a Chevy grille."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3e05bq,grem75,3,Tue Jul 21 00:08:08 2015 UTC,"No, its a Chevy Caprice wagon, and it does share the same LT1 as a corvette, it's just de-tuned. Same block, so if he put some performance parts under the hood, it could have the same, if not better specs than a corvette of that time."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3e05bq,CandyCaneOreos,2,Tue Jul 21 00:33:05 2015 UTC,"That roof never came on a Caprice, only the Roadmaster and Vista Cruiser. That is an Impala SS grille and bumper that never came on any wagon to begin with.  Also, a Corvette LT1 was a 4-bolt main engine. Every other version, including Camaro, was a 2-bolt, so not quite the same block. The heads and cam are different too. It is a differently configured engine in the same family.  Most likely it has nothing done to it, it just happens to have an LT1, so they call it a Corvette engine to sound good to the uninformed. The iron headed LT1 is better suited to that big land barge anyway, it has a better torque curve for it."

Shitty_Car_Mods,3e05bq,CandyCaneOreos,2,Tue Jul 21 01:19:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, that one is definitely a Caprice. The one in the OP has what is known as a Vista Roof, not available on any year of Caprice.  It also has the old style mirrors, so it is probably a '94. First year of the LT1, last year of those mirrors. Actually, it has to be a Roadmaster since the Oldsmobiles were killed off before the LT1."

Shitty_Car_Mods,3dzyy3,NitroBike,3,Tue Jul 21 16:15:11 2015 UTC,"You are completely wrong, I'll tell you why. Those turbos are fully functional, you can tell by the blow off valve with the pink top. Also, not a ricer. No stupid body kits or spoilers, and not a Japanese car. You should probably learn a thing or two about cars and car modifications before you go spouting off about things you know nothing about. It may look like dumb setup (which it sorta is. I mean that exhaust pipe, literally no backpressure), but it's probably faster than whatever you drive daily."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dzyy3,DaGhostQc,-2,Tue Jul 21 15:18:12 2015 UTC,This piece of trash cant even beat the most basic american muscle. This car is no looks and no go.
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dzyy3,lendog_,4,Tue Jul 21 15:48:59 2015 UTC,"Listen, I understand you don't know much about how forced induction works. But those two spool things are called turbochargers. This VW has two of them. These turbochargers run off exhaust backpressure and cause the turbos to push more air into the engine. More air means more fuel, more fuel means horsepower and torque, which means you can spin your engine at a faster rpm, therefore you gain more horsepower and torque if you can lay it down without spinning tires.   This car could probably beat a lot of N/A cars. I understand you think more cylinders equals more power,(AMERICA, V8/V6, POWER, etc.). But in reality, this car probably runs 13.00s or lower on the drag. You should really learn about cars before you try to argue about them.  By the way, this look (rusted body, old car, steelies) is becoming very popular. If it didn't have the turbos sticking out, then it would be considered a ""sleeper"". But yeah, like I said earlier this car would probably beat whatever you drive daily."

And I know that the front windows were more than likely once tinted as dark as the rears but were probably removed because they caused the owner to get pulled over on more blaze runs then they helped them get away with.  All that money that should have been replacing bushings and warding off subframe damage or making sure that aging engine is running in top shape went to tint tickets....  It's a shame because i'd give up my E46 for another E36 any day of the week, I love those damn cars but they all either look like this or are a rusted pile of shit, finding one in OK condition is getting tough..."

Roof broke 5K to fix, traded it for the E46 330i and I have regreted it since.  Farngruen (Fern Green) and the soft top matched the paint.  edit: It was really the M styled flared rocker covers and the M style bumper that makes the E36 look drop dead gorgeous."

The horse is about to be killed by three lions so those people are going to be thrown from the horse.  Meanwhile another lion is about to grab the guy while he left himself open by throwing his arms wide.  The lady better be a sorceress who can cast lightning because she can't last much longer.  And in the background is the Mustang.  I'm guessing it was the Mustang that sent the lions after those people.   What has the Mustang against Aztecs?

Shitty_Car_Mods,3dmfyh,spongebob_meth,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:47:34 2015 UTC,"The dime a dozen pony cars are often as or more expensive, depending on the area, and will definitely need money dropped into suspension if you plan to do more than just spin some tires, though.  Welded diffs (which shouldn't be driven on the road, but I digress) are common in 240sx's, and may have came that way. The majority of pony cars didn't have any kind of lsd and welded diffs are far less common outside of specific drag racer communities. Some kind of diff mod is an absolute must-have for drifting, an open diff won't cut it."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dmfyh,bakageta,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:28:20 2015 UTC,A v8 90's mustang is cheaper than a 240sx that hasn't been wrapped around a tree/rusted out in my area.  I see them for $3-$5k all the time.  Most v8 pony cars came with limited slip.  My camaro even has a torsen LSD.
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dmfyh,bakageta,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:41:12 2015 UTC,"From my experience, the ones that came with limited slip are often now non-functional, I've seen a lot of peg-leg Mustang GT burnouts. Then again, if they came standard, that SHOULD be just replacing the clutch pack, unless it was an awful viscous LSD. It'll also probably vary with generation, since a 90's mustang could be 3rd or 4th depending on year. I'll be honest here, 90's pony weren't my thing so I don't know the specifics on all the models.  The torsen in your camaro, was that standard or optional? I'm not super familiar with the more recent camaros, the second generation was the last I've owned.  It'll also really vary by area, if you live somewhere that drifting is a ""thing,"" you'll see 240sx's get drift taxed to hell. I've also seen ""good ol' boy"" areas where pony cars get the 'murican muscle tax and 240sx's remain cheap. Depending where in Virginia this is, that could be the case."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dmfyh,vansdude51091,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:52:56 2015 UTC,"It's still one of the most affordable ""drift missile"" platforms, and since he bought it as a shell (according to the video) it wasn't like he had to drop $2000 and then start adding power. The 240sx can often be found without the crazy ""drift tax"" prices, especially as a shell, and I'd guess he probably spent less than a comparable mustang/camaro build while having a chassis that's more respected in the drift community.  I imagine the bumpers and passenger headlight housing were already missing on the shell and the wing was probably already on it, SR20DETs are surprisingly cheap, and everything else needed to make it legal (front bumper bar, headlight housing) was done as cheap as possible, which will look like shit.  The guy added stupid paint since it already looked like shit, and had a good laugh with something that was ready to sit in a junkyard. If he has fun with it, good for him, though it's ugly as fuck and I wouldn't drive it. I'd laugh at it like any other shitty mod, but at least this one has some practicality, like the license plate headlight housing or front bumper, unlike a lot of cars posted here."

Shitty_Car_Mods,3do1bj,WooserTX,3,Sat Jul 18 05:45:14 2015 UTC,I think they're knock-offs of the Slipstream (which is a knock of Spoon sw388/Regamaster Evo). The spokes on those wheels look thicker compare to the Rota and appears to be drilled for dual lug pattern unlike Rota/sw388/Evo.

Shitty_Car_Mods,3dmq46,SovietSteve,3,Sat Jul 18 07:40:04 2015 UTC,"It bears no relation to the skylines that preceded it. They just reused the name  because it was an established brand. Back in those days Nissan were looking to reduce the number of sports cars in their line up. At that point they had 3: the Silvia, skyline and Fairlady Z. The Silvia got dropped due to problems getting the Sr20 engine (developed in the late 80s) through the latest round of emissions regulations, the skyline was discontinued (though continued in name only as a luxury car) and the Z car continued as the 350z flagship sports car"
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dmq46,JP147,2,Sat Jul 18 08:02:19 2015 UTC,There have been a lot of changes with the skyline previously though.

How can anyone who claims to love cars know so little about cars mechanically that they actually modify it to handle worse, be more dangerous to other road users and waste their own money by vastly increasing the frequency of tyre changes and wheel-bearing replacements? Silly buggers.  Before anyone starts, yes, people do actually drive around with this kind of camber or even worse.

Shitty_Car_Mods,3drut6,Super_Midget,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:11:39 2015 UTC,You can flare a fender without looking that ugly. They need to be flush with the door at the gap so it doesn't look like someone unbolted them and wedged a 2x4 behind them at the door jamb. Either taper the fender back down or bring the door out to match and taper over the length of the door. That sharp step ruins the otherwise smooth appearance of the truck.

Shitty_Car_Mods,3dilew,JiveTurkey1983,6,Fri Jul 17 03:08:15 2015 UTC,"That would have been the Citation, IIRC.  I don't think there was an equivalent Saturn because they were trying to be good then."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dilew,GNienalt,11,Thu Jul 16 17:44:44 2015 UTC,"The original Saturn was engineered from the ground up to be a Japanese car built in America. They went so far as to follow Japanese guidelines about dimensions and engine displacement (GM really didn't understand why people liked Japanese cars). It was a completely new design unrelated to any other car, which was a big part of its downfall. They got people hooked with the revolutionary no-pressure atmosphere and great customer service, but the car itself wasn't really anything special, and having been designed to Japanese standards it wasn't very well suited to the American marketplace. This also backfired when they brought it to Japan: by that point the guidelines under which it was designed had eased up, so even there it was considered somewhat small and underpowered for its class, and the ""revolutionary"" customer service and no-pressure dealerships were the norm there. Also, the price wasn't competitive and reliability was about average. It was kind of like building an Olive Garden in Italy.  After the initial excitement wore off Americans wanted something a little bigger and better, and the no-pressure dealer network meant that customers weren't pushed to upgrade to a newer model any time soon. Saturn tried to recapture that initial success a couple times with the L series (based on larger, more upmarket Japanese offerings), Ion (a more upmarket replacement for the S series), Vue (based on the then-new crossover craze), and Sky (based on Japanese roadsters like the Miata and S2000), but most models after the original S-series were somewhat restyled versions of other GM cars. In the end they just abandoned their original mission and sold rebadged Opels (GM's German brand, designed in Europe) until they went under and that duty was taken over by Buick (fun fact, in the 1960s the only place to buy an Opel in America was at the Buick dealership. Now most Buicks are simply rebadged/redesigned Opels).    Wow, that really got away from me. What was I talking about?  Oh yeah. TL;DR the original Saturn was an entirely unique car that didn't share any parts with other GM models. Also, the Cimarron was based on the J-body (Cavalier, Sunbird, Skyhawk), not the X-body (Citation, Phoenix, Omega, Skylark)."

A bonus is they are easy to work on and replace the motors. Just as easy to replace the motor then it is to replace the head gasket lol  I would love to own another but they are getting rare in my area because of all the rust.

Shitty_Car_Mods,3dgpee,modmodmodmodmod,24,Thu Jul 16 09:01:26 2015 UTC,I'd rather have a hot air intake than a rainwater intake...

Shitty_Car_Mods,3dgpee,thecampo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:48:21 2015 UTC,The Mazdaspeed 6 has a turbo charger. The turbo compresses the air which also causes it to heat up. This negates any cold air intake as the air gets superheated in the turbo. Most will run a ram air intake. See my post above. This is why forced induction engines have an intercooler. It is a radiator that cools the hot air after  it is compressed by the turbo prior to entering the engine.

Shitty_Car_Mods,3dgpee,thecampo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:10:58 2015 UTC,No worries. Check out this reply for more reasons why a cold air intake setup like this is a bad idea.
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dgpee,P3tr0,13,Thu Jul 16 19:12:59 2015 UTC,"From a performance perspective, this would technically work. The engine is breathing in air colder than it would be if it was in the engine bay.   On the other hand it looks down right ridiculous"
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dgpee,D_Livs,12,Thu Jul 16 11:11:15 2015 UTC,"No. This is the worst possible scenario.  Can you breathe easily when skydiving? No, you have to gasp for air. Same for this intake.  Fast moving air is at a lower pressure, so by placing the intake where air is moving fast reduces the ability of the engine to suck it in. Cold air is a small advantage as it is more dense and more air can be crammed into the cylinder-- cancelled out by making the engine struggle to get air in at all.  Fluid dynamics 101, Bernoulli's principle. It's how airplanes fly."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dgpee,aceogorion,0,Thu Jul 16 16:36:03 2015 UTC,"Oh for fuck sakes, are you kidding me?! Bernoulli's principle doesn't apply that way in a case like this, which anyone should immediately realise as otherwise cars would go faster as they picked up speed!   Look at the location there, do you see anything that looks like something other than a bluff body directly facing the airstream, how could you even begin to think that would be a low pressure zone?  Faster moving air is at lower pressure, you have to speed it up or slow it down, guess which one is happening when you take the car as a frame of reference?  Good god, this got eleven points! Wow, that's a lot of idiots."

Shitty_Car_Mods,3dgpee,CivQhore,3,Thu Jul 16 15:11:42 2015 UTC,"Mid pipe relief intakes are available to prevent hydrolocking. If it sucks a fluid denser than air, air will be pulled from the other intake. It's basically a double ended intake that splits the pipe in the engine bay; has more resistance than the lower one until it tries to suck water or another liquid.   That being said, the chances of this car having one is slim to none. I say this just based on their placement/mounting of the cold air intake."

Shitty_Car_Mods,3dgpee,D_Livs,3,Thu Jul 16 19:01:27 2015 UTC,"Not really. It's going to have a harder time sucking in air at speed than if it were inside the pocket of air that gets trapped in the engine bay.  Overall stupid idea. Probably lost kW, if anything."

Shitty_Car_Mods,3dgpee,wgbm,2,Thu Jul 16 12:11:19 2015 UTC,"You're correct, the airbox on modern cars has a vent that pulls air from the front headlight(?). But in this case, to fit an aftermarket cone filter the majority just remove the airbox and run it in its place. A correctly installed cone intake should have a heat shield and should be as far away from the exhaust manifold"
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dgpee,WaterTK,2,Thu Jul 16 12:33:22 2015 UTC,"I'd say the location varies by car.  The first two gens of the A4 (maybe later, but I am sure of the first two) have something I don't want to call a pipe because it's a plastic rectangle, but it pulls from the top of the front grille and a spring loaded door that can pull from the wheel well if the pressure goes negative enough."

Shitty_Car_Mods,3dmh7n,shatter321,10,Fri Jul 17 13:48:20 2015 UTC,It has airbags. It only sits that low when parked.
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dmh7n,Skwirlman,-5,Fri Jul 17 14:32:56 2015 UTC,"It's still lowered, you can see before and after images of the airbag suspension"
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dmh7n,COPDSTR,9,Fri Jul 17 15:39:23 2015 UTC,A bagged dually makes more sense than a lifted dually
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dmh7n,mohjustin,8,Fri Jul 17 16:29:55 2015 UTC,"Not really, like other people have said, it's on airbags. They can raise above stock ride height."

Shitty_Car_Mods,3dmh7n,grem75,3,Fri Jul 17 18:23:09 2015 UTC,When it is up it has way more clearance than the average car.
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dmh7n,fatkid1371,2,Fri Jul 17 15:53:42 2015 UTC,Good thing it looks clean when parked and aired-down. That 6 liter will give out way before the suspension does and it will be parked a lot...
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dmh7n,Dman331,2,Fri Jul 17 16:19:24 2015 UTC,"At least its on bags, poor thing."

Shitty_Car_Mods,3dg1e9,MainerZ,55,Wed Jul 15 23:58:54 2015 UTC,"Spraypaint or plasti-dip? Just wondering, cause you have to be full blown retard to spraypaint your car when you could have just as easily dipped it"
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dg1e9,dogheadpall,25,Thu Jul 16 02:27:23 2015 UTC,Spraypaint. The kid went full retard.
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dg1e9,Prison_Vape,-14,Thu Jul 16 03:50:15 2015 UTC,You aren't OP.   There's no way it's not plastidip.
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dg1e9,GaiusBaltar_,24,Thu Jul 16 04:40:20 2015 UTC,... it clearly says It's spray paint in the title. My source is OP.
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dg1e9,Prison_Vape,6,Thu Jul 16 04:53:19 2015 UTC,And it's a common mistake to make. My guess is that OP doesn't know either. I highly doubt anyone would actually permanent spray paint an M4 regardless of how stupid you think they are.
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dg1e9,GaiusBaltar_,15,Thu Jul 16 04:58:14 2015 UTC,"I'm very glad you have such faith in humanity. But yes, I firmly believe this kid really spray painted an m4. Trust me, in all my years in the automotive industry, I've met a few on that level of stupid."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dg1e9,Prison_Vape,12,Thu Jul 16 05:10:01 2015 UTC,"The lack of paint runs, thin spots, and random speckles tells me this is plastidip.  Source: my old car had a professionally plastidipped paint job and I have many hours of plastidip experience."

Shitty_Car_Mods,3dg1e9,Balves426,0,Fri Jul 17 11:14:27 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm not saying anyone is wrong.  OP says It's spray paint, and that's my source, as I said. And I know some people dumb enough to spray paint an M4, so I do believe this kid could POTENTIALLY have spray painted an M4. Maybe It's plastidip, maybe he's got good can control. I don't know the kid, so I don't know for sure.  I'm just saying, Either way, the kid is DEFINITELY dumb for thinking this was a good idea."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dg1e9,Prison_Vape,7,Thu Jul 16 06:12:40 2015 UTC,"Other users on r/bmw have seen the car in person and confirmed seeing overspray on the tires.

He didn't even cover the wheels, there's overspray on the tires..."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dg1e9,RodRAEG,2,Thu Jul 16 06:57:47 2015 UTC,"Its not shocking he didn't cover the tires, he didn't even tape the 2 colors off."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dg1e9,gerbsters,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:25:21 2015 UTC,That only means he didn't cover the wheels/tires which is a common mistake people make with DIY dip kits because they assume since you can peel it it's not a big deal when in fact it is very difficult to not only remove from tires but small amounts of over spray are near impossible as well.
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dg1e9,mjike,-1,Thu Jul 16 08:17:04 2015 UTC,"With dip there's no need. Look at the windows, no overspray because he probably peeled it off of them"
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dg1e9,mrdotkom,2,Thu Jul 16 07:29:45 2015 UTC,Wouldn't plastidip have more of a defined border between the two colors though?
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dg1e9,Darkshift17,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:25:11 2015 UTC,"Only if you mask it. Dip doesn't color blend as well as paint which is what we see here. This job is too clean in areas that should have over spray, there's some very defined speckling and it's too solid, spray paint would have thin/uneven areas in the solid colors."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dg1e9,mjike,5,Thu Jul 16 08:13:47 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, the friend of the owner did not confirm whether it was paint, here's another pic, he does confirm that the owner is a typical international student/retard however. So it's very likely to be paint."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dg1e9,Apotropaic_Sphinx,15,Thu Jul 16 06:46:09 2015 UTC,That looks like plastidip to me.
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dg1e9,mrdotkom,6,Thu Jul 16 07:10:43 2015 UTC,Looks very much like dip. If it were paint the fenders would look matte. Hell that blue is a pretty standard dip color. Not to mention lack of overspray on the windows
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dg1e9,douchecanoo,2,Thu Jul 16 07:27:15 2015 UTC,If it were paint the fenders would look matte   Not if you clear coat it
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dg1e9,mrdotkom,2,Thu Jul 16 07:46:18 2015 UTC,Isn't the premise that this kid is retarded? Clear needs a lot of work to look good
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dg1e9,douchecanoo,2,Thu Jul 16 07:49:59 2015 UTC,"Depends what you think is more retarded, spray painting and clear coating (permanent) or plastidipping (temporary)  Either way it does still look like shit, we can all agree on that"
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dg1e9,mrdotkom,3,Thu Jul 16 07:51:36 2015 UTC,I've dipped plenty of things and it's cerainly not retarded if done well
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dg1e9,Darkshift17,2,Thu Jul 16 07:59:52 2015 UTC,Plastidip would look more defined between the two colored though i feel.
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dg1e9,mjike,8,Thu Jul 16 07:26:14 2015 UTC,Actually it wouldn't. I've dipped a few things and that's exactly what it would look like if you tried to do a blend
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dg1e9,osprey413,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:02:46 2015 UTC,Would plastidip result in overspray on the front tire?
Shitty_Car_Mods,3dg1e9,Apotropaic_Sphinx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:22:44 2015 UTC,Yes. It is sprayed on just like any other paint.

I shut the car off out of habit and battery wasn't charged and cop refused to jump my car for the same reason. Is that really a thing?

Previous owner completely removed the muffler and put in this long red fiberglass tube that made it loud and stupid. Took that off and added a stock muffler just about as soon as I got the chance.

Shitty_Car_Mods,3d87os,fucked_ur_mom,11,Tue Jul 14 13:35:12 2015 UTC,"Ah no worries. All Wheel Drive means that all four wheels have power going to them at any given time. In some cars you will see a 50:50 split in power distribution, a 20:80, or really anything you can think of. This gives better traction to driving continuously. Some cars give you the option to adjust the ratios but usually keep them on in some form.  4 Wheel Drive is a system that can be turned on and off depending on need. This was the original system to move all four wheels. It used to involve moving that second lever to engage the transfer case so that the front driveshaft would be engaged and synced to the rear drivetrain. But now many vehicles are all electronic in how this works so its much harder to tell.  So tldr, AWD, means 4 wheels are always getting power (generally) and 4wd, means at select times 4 wheels are getting power (generally)."

The interior really isn't all that bad, would've looked better with a polished hardwood instead of metal floorboard. Put some extensions on the shifters so you aren't having to double over to shift, add some more tasteful wheels and you'd be set. And somebody was complaining about the electric window controls position, but those doors weren't made to run electrical through, placing them forward of the door was probably their best option.   Oh, also a different instrument cluster probably wouldn't hurt."

Shitty_Car_Mods,3d8k55,AKADriver,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:21:38 2015 UTC,"Actually he was in service and had been there for long enough that I believed him. I don't believe shit the salesman say, you're right about that. Then again we only have 2 that were there to see the new GN."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3d8k55,SprungMS,0,Tue Jul 14 23:38:06 2015 UTC,"T-types came in any color available on the Regal including black. There was also a black trim package for the '87 T-type (again, still available with any color) called RPO WE4 that included the front air dam seen on this car (and all '85-'87 GNs).  I think you're confused as to the difference between a GN and GNX. They only made 547 semi-handbuilt GNXs and they're pretty much all accounted for by collectors. Nothing about this car appears to be a GNX - it has the domed hood found on all T-types, GNs, and GNXs, but it doesn't have the specific GNX badging or the wide fiberglass fenders. Whereas GN production was in the five-figure range and they're 'collectible' but not particularly rare and you still see them in beater condition at the dragstrip."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3d8k55,AKADriver,0,Tue Jul 14 20:10:44 2015 UTC,"Well, he pretty much destroyed the car. Plasti-dipped(with a spray can)the whole car dark purple, added cheap ""equus"" brand gauges screwed directly on the hood and dash. Painted the interior. Added aftermarket seats. He claims it's a real Grand National to everybody at work here. BTW, I photoshopped his license plate out of the picture, hence the weird looking bumper."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3d8k55,AKADriver,2,Tue Jul 14 23:24:21 2015 UTC,"The later SEFI intercooled ones were legitimately fast, at least by eighties standards, and have massive tuning potential. The early '80s hot-air carb turbo buicks were pretty bad."

Most top level drift cars actually strive to have as much mechanical and aero grip as possible. Match that with nearly 1000 hp and you get cars accelerating through corners while drifting.  EDIT: Not saying the car in this pic has that much power, for all we know it's just for show. But don't judge a book by its cover."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3d4xnn,ShipWreckLover,4,Mon Jul 13 21:14:01 2015 UTC,Wrong. you need grip to drift. That's the only way you can control the slide. Otherwise your just in the midst of crashing. But tell me more about the physics you don't understand!

I always been somewhat rebellious. When someone says I'm doing something wrong, only because it's not the way every one else is doing it, I'll just continue to go against the grain. I r gotten more positive than negative feedback on my build. I've gotten pretty good at taking constructive criticism."

I do miss going fast,  but I lost a close friend to street racing so I decided to steer away from speed, knowing I'd be tempted. Then I fell in love with stance. The air ride, ex's pensive flashy 3pc wheels, camber. Etc. it's forever evolving and to me, is an art, and just like art, some see it as beautiful, while others see it as garbage :)"

Shitty_Car_Mods,3d1q0u,SgtWillieNelson,3,Mon Jul 13 20:30:10 2015 UTC,"I think it looks like an ok mod, needs some cleanup around the fenders. Not my style, since I'm more of a truck guy, but cool for those who do it.   A few questions.  Do you actually drive it low like this, of just park it?  Are there specific tires that have sidewall traction for these mods so that you can drive them?  How common is the 2015 Corolla in this scene? I own one as my daily and love the little car. I'll never mod it, but I see a lot of potential for people do make them look really stellar. They are pretty little cars.   Also, love the color. Not very common, and It's hard to appreciate brown in a car."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3d1q0u,TitaniumTurtle,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:04:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks! And absolutely, I am cleaning them up this week.  The height you see it at here in this pic is ""aired out"". I'm laying on my cars sub frame. I park this way. When I drive on smooth, and rather straight roads, my ride height is 1 1/2 to 2"" from sub frame. When you look at the fenders, they sit just at the lips of the wheels when I'm crusin. It's it's ""hilly"", and or bumpy, I raise my ride height. Same applies for speed bump, and getting up driveways, and other steep areas.   THANKFULLY, I'm sponsored by a tire shop, so I get tires really cheap. That being said I do have a minor or ""baby stretch"" on my tires. People argue that it's unsafe, it can be to a point, however I'm not driving in anyway that it would apply to me and my car. I run 215/40/17r with 80psi  in the rear on 17x11 and 205/40/17r with 60-65psi in the front on 17x10. I check tire pressure daily.  As far as the Corolla, it won ""simply clean"". It deserved it. His Corolla is ""VIP'd out"", you really have to see it to appreciate it. It's a beauty for sure.   And thanks for the complement on the color. It was a gamble to go with a brown, but lucky for me it paid off and came out better than I thought."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3d1q0u,SgtWillieNelson,2,Mon Jul 13 20:42:46 2015 UTC,I like how you fit it in with the Hawaiian statue. It's awesome how well the car fits that style in that color.

It doesn't have any racing or drifting function at that point. I don't think it looks good. Could you try to help me understand the appeal?  Like I said I don't mean to be rude, and I totally respect you for doing something you like, it just doesn't have a tangible appeal to me like a time attack car or a drifting car or a luxury car. Is it solely because you like the way it is cosmetically?"

Padded, leather seats with diamond stitching, versace fabric for the headliner,panels, and pillsrs. VIP trays and curtains, and a few other goodies I don't wanna leak. I use to go fast, and tried my hand at drifting, until I lost a close friend to street racing. It lost my interest, but I still loved the car scene, so I decided to go the stance route after seeing some VIP cars. I know it's not a traditional VIP car but it still inspired me. Plus I'm battling some mental issues and working on my car takes my mind off of the negative things that causes me to spiral downwards. I do all the work myself and I know it only appeals to a small community, but I like that community :)."

Shitty_Car_Mods,3d1q0u,ABusFullaJewz,2,Mon Jul 13 06:16:04 2015 UTC,"what does it look like at a higher ride height? Also something I've always wondered about stance kinda stuff, how driveable is the car now? I suppose you've got a significant advantage over static cars, but is it still like a stock civic?  I actually quite like your car by the way. I'm usually not a fan of stancey stuff unless it's really subtle, but your car sort of breaks the norm and makes you go ""huh, that's actually pretty cool""."

After all the shattered wheel bearings that went away. So explain to me what the trend is with tires that aren't quite big enough to fit the rim they're mounted on? Is it to get that extra 1/2"" of clearance or is just a look that got copied?"

Apparently the car has an Isuzu Trooper 3.2L 190HP engine fitted along with its drivetrain and transmission (yeah I don't know much about cars, someone correct me if I'm wrong), AWD, electric windows, and a Mercedes steering wheel. Also don't forget the Iron Cross side mirrors. And the absurd quad exhaust. Here is another one from the same site: http://allegro.pl/1931-ford-model-a-coupe-hot-rod-street-rod-i5520665855.html"

I know they have a newer device now but back when I was doing GM Accessories they only gave us options for the sizes available from GM on speedometer calibrations. I'm pretty sure it hasn't changed.  Older GMs(<95) you could easily solder a jumper or dip switch into the vssb or drac and get any ratio you want. Fords up until 98 or so were just a speedo gear on the transmission shaft.  All and all, I'd say it's not that hard to adjust on any of these.

At 20 mph it'll read 22, at 55 it's reading 59, at 75 it's reading 83."

Roads are a public space and dangerous vehicles should not be allowed.  If I can get on a soapbox for a minute, I'd like to see a tiered license and registration system for modified vehicles.  You have to get a new license, for one.  One that would require extensive training and some track time.  It should cost a couple thousand dollars and have an annual renewal of a few hundred.  Second, you'd have to apply for a modified vehicle plate.  That should cost a few hundred a year, as well.  Now, if you get more than two speeding tickets in 12 months or pick up a reckless driving infraction, you lose the right to have a modified vehicle license and plate for 36 months.  Further, you will have to return your car to stock condition if you want to drive it.  That would clear most of this dangerous bullshit off the roads."

Shitty_Car_Mods,3d6osl,mrdotkom,-4,Tue Jul 14 01:11:47 2015 UTC,"I grew up in upstate New York, so I can offer some perspective on this. If you're flying that flag in New York it's because you're a racist, full stop. There's no ""southern pride"" at play here. North of the Mason-Dixon that is a symbol of white supremacy with zero other subtext. Racism is rampant in rural upstate.  Free speech doesn't mean you're immune to criticism. Having your ideas questioned is American. Flying the flag of a secessionist army that took up arms against Americans? Now that's fucking unamerican."

Shitty_Car_Mods,3cvoh8,Jrook,2,Sat Jul 11 16:55:00 2015 UTC,"I can accept painting a DeLorean... That's sometimes necessary because if you try to get dents out of stainless steel it pretty much requires reworking the entire panel. It's a lost cause unless you're reworking the entire panel. If you have two or three panels fucked up you either replace them or smooth the dents then say fuck it and paint over.  No objections with the paint at all.  But he could have gotten something that looks just like this, performs better, didn't destroy a classic, and maybe even cost less in a newer Cadillac. Nobody's gonna miss a new Cadillac. I doubt anyone would miss a post 1975 Cadillac if it got modded to hell and back.

The body and the fiberglass chassis does not rust, but the cheap fasteners and hardware they used to hold everything together do.    Yes, the DeLorean looks beautiful, and there are some amazing design and engineering pieces on it. However, for each beautiful piece of engineering, there is another piece of horrific design or hard cost cutting.  While I love the DeLoreans, the whole package is far from a beautiful machine."

Shitty_Car_Mods,3cvoh8,GenrlWashington,4,Sat Jul 11 13:55:26 2015 UTC,"Looks like Doc Brown updated the time machine. I'm not entirely against the modification of the DeLorean, but i feel that it shouldn't be done to a point, like the will.i.am car, where you ruin a lot of the features that makes it a DeLorean. So I give a few modified ones some leeway. Overall I think the best looking DeLorean is one that looks original. The burnout one looks good, but it's almost like they made something ""like"" a DeLorean because they didn't have rights make an actual one. Sort of like how GTA always has cars that are similar to real cars."

Man, the last three or four seasons had me asking that with nearly every guest. Half of them were new pop music kids who didn't even have their license yet. It's a car show; the guests should have something interesting to say about cars.  The first really bad one was Jeff Goldblum. He left the car in 3rd gear the entire lap because he didn't realize the car would go faster in higher gears... I'm pretty sure his abomination of a lap is why they got automatic versions of their cars for the later guests who can't drive.  They don't need to have only F1 drivers as guests, but at least have stars who are car enthusiasts. Instead it became a 10 minute interview with the guest discussing their new movie/tv show/cd with a random shot of them driving a car with a helmet on thrown in at the end. Not that it matters now; the reformatted show will probably drop the segment entirely. If the actual TG trio make something new like they've been hinting at, I really can't see them continuing with the SIARPC bit at all."

Shitty_Car_Mods,3cw07e,lesbian_necrophilia,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:57:42 2015 UTC,The headliner on most cars can be removed. You first mission is to remove the headliner while doing minimum damage to the upholstery that you have to remove i order to make it drop down. Now you can take it out of your car and glue the tapestry on with m3 fabric glue. Oh wait you cant take it out because it too large therefore you have to do everything in the car. HUGE PAIN IN THE ASS. So you glue it on nice and snug then put it back in. If you want to repair it instead of trick it out get a fabric that matches the colors in the car. No one will know the difference.

Air moving over the top curved part of a wing moves faster and is at lower pressure then the flat bottom part of the wing. The pressure differential lifts up the plane.  So in the case of this photo, as the guy drives down the freeway, the engine will have a harder time sucking in air then if it was inside the car with a pocket of air moving with the car.   Imagine how hard it is to breathe when sky diving... Or sticking your head out of the car window.  Normal hood scoops that capture air do not suffer from this effect."

Shitty_Car_Mods,3ct99w,WarlockSyno,-14,Sat Jul 11 01:34:57 2015 UTC,Manual engines are set up slightly different than automatics I think. That's why you see bhp drop in automatics over their manual counterparts

Whole panels, fenders, fascias, bumpers, etc,. are removed so that the vinyl can be folded over the edge of the whatever is being wrapped and lightly glued to the inside so that the vinyl can never accidentally peel off once the panel, fender, fascia, bumper, are re-attached. The whole process of wrapping an entire car can take up to an entire week.  Here is an F430 being wrapped.

Shitty_Car_Mods,3cspcg,Lincolns_Hat,4,Fri Jul 10 19:21:26 2015 UTC,Can confirm. '92 Caprice wagon here. Was awesome for sure.

Shitty_Car_Mods,3cspcg,barunut,18,Fri Jul 10 15:23:12 2015 UTC,"Not a big block, LT1 V8, A Gen II Chevy small block. And it isnt some, it is all 90s B-bodies. They aren't necessarily fast but they will get out of their own way and the aftermarket suport is enormous because this is the same engine that was put into Camaros and Corvettes around the same time.  Other than the hood though this thing is pretty slick, I would definitely bang this around town."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3cspcg,TurboNarwhal,5,Fri Jul 10 15:58:10 2015 UTC,I generally hold that flames only look good on hot rods. Which leads me to call this a legitimate hot rod.
Shitty_Car_Mods,3cspcg,BAMspek,3,Fri Jul 10 16:21:46 2015 UTC,Those Lts are super solid so bolt on power adders dont stress it out too much either. They can hand boost with turbos or superchargers with little modification. I had a 94 camaro with mostly swap meet bolt ons that was a total roit on the street
Shitty_Car_Mods,3cspcg,DjSorbus,3,Fri Jul 10 16:26:01 2015 UTC,"Uhh, the Chevy Caprice wagon came with a Chevy 305. Isn't the LT1 a 350?"
Shitty_Car_Mods,3cspcg,droptherock,5,Fri Jul 10 20:20:50 2015 UTC,Had to double check myself i was wrong on all of them being lt1 but we are both right about everything else. It depends on the year lt1 didn't happen until 94 and it was an option in everything but the wagon where our was standard. There are actually 4 different engines put in that gen b body.
Shitty_Car_Mods,3cspcg,TurboNarwhal,2,Fri Jul 10 20:32:08 2015 UTC,"Damn, that is crazy! The only reason I even said anything is my Dad had one and the 305 went out in it so he had a 350 put in. The thing is, the transmission that came with the 305 can't handle the 350 as well and his tranny went out within a year after the swap. The guy at the shop told him it would do it but he just wanted a friggin 350 in his weak-ass wagon. That thing was so heavy and he always tried to make it out to be a muscle car but it just wasn't. haha"
Shitty_Car_Mods,3cspcg,droptherock,5,Fri Jul 10 20:43:38 2015 UTC,"Same transmission came in the 305 and 350 cars, 4L60/4L60E depending on the year. They fail even behind a 4.3L V6."

Had dually wheels that were huge(not sure what size but bigger than the wheels of the topic pic) and something like a 30 inch lift. I no longer have any pictures of it(not sure where they went) but my friend and I were sitting in this truck which was beside the big one and we weren't even up to the window of the big one.

If not, here.  http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1971-1980-ford-pinto12.htm  There's some misconceptions about the memo. It was NHTSA that provided calculated values of human life and injuries. And there's no way Ford could have been the only ones doing similar cost-benefit analysis because auto companies are always pinching pennies.  And cars of that same era almost all had rear mounted metal gas tanks that were entirely crushable.  Basically Ford was the only one to get caught.  Edit: Even my mom's 1983 AMC Concord had a metal gas tank that would have crumpled and spilled all its fuel at the first impact. The 4wd Eagles were the same car as the Concord but different drive train and therefore would have had the same rear mounted fuel tanks."

To fix this a metal HG along with ARP studs does the trick but a JZ usually is a lot more wallet friendly. My GE was $500 along with the 5spd swap which is $425 plus all the small stuff puts you at $1500-2000 for a pretty reliable fun car.

Shitty_Car_Mods,3cjkyh,mikeinabox,9,Wed Jul 8 20:55:00 2015 UTC,I remember a local Chevy Dealer that was using a Toyota for a parts truck for a while.  Looked kind of odd.  I'm guessing they took it in as a trade and used it instead of putting a new truck from inventory into service.  The last time I went they were using a Colorado again though.
Shitty_Car_Mods,3cjkyh,dageekywon,3,Wed Jul 8 16:18:22 2015 UTC,I think it's pretty common with parts and dealer shuttle vehicles. The only one they care to make sure is their own make (and often a high-trim model) is the service loaner car because that can theoretically help sell new cars.

Shitty_Car_Mods,3cjkyh,Robotimus,8,Wed Jul 8 15:40:22 2015 UTC,"Yea, this is pretty common in the US.  I'm on the other side in California, and that's what they look like, here, too."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3cjkyh,Man_da_villan,3,Wed Jul 8 15:47:33 2015 UTC,"Can confirm, it's like this pretty much everywhere in the US. I've seen these lights all over the southeast. They're great. Usually, if there are cars about to make a left turn while waiting at a red light, the arrows on either side will light up green when the cross traffic stops. This allows the people making the left turns to do so in a much safer way. It is usually a short period of time before the main traffic is allowed to go forward through the intersection. Depending on the intersection, people can usually continue to make left turns, having to yield, but some intersections, usually dangerous ones, will prohibit you from turning left unless you have a green arrow."

Personally I'd go with a 2000/2001 jeep Cherokee.(I may or may not be a little biased considering I own one and love it) If you can give up some bells and whistles. It'll never let you down. If you're looking to upgrade because of kids. Steer clear of 'em. The backseat is near nonexistent.  Subaru's are a good choice. If you want awd/room. If it's a 2.5l make sure the headgaskets were done.

The 2.5L, while slow and as powerful as dogshit, is just the 4.0 with 2 cylinders cut out. The AW4 auto trans in the Cherokee is bullet proof, as well as the AX-15 and the NV manuals they put in. The 8.25 rear axle is pretty tough. The Dana 35 rear, AX4 and AX5 manual trans are okay, as long as you don't start modifying the jeep. Then the Grand Cherokees have Chrysler transmissions which are ass and they put the V8s in which are meh IMO"

(the wheels and tires still tuck under the fenders.)  I believe the same reasoning is used for stretching as narrow a tire a possible on a wide wheel.

It looked cool, but the seats in the back were surrounded by fiberglass and plastic bits so couldn't come out, and the headrests were so tall the trunk had to be propped open. O asked a friend about it and he told me that the car was never driven on the road, they just took the trunk off during transport.  Note: On this car, the trunk and rear windshield were one piece. Opening the trunk also lifted up the windshield with it."

No. Is it very good at handling? No. But this car wasn't built for Laguna Seca. It was built for shows and because the owner likes it. Just like Stance, lowriders, lifted trucks, and track cars; there's a reason for every scene and you should respect them all."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3cflpj,A3rik,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:28:34 2015 UTC,"This is the criteria I usually follow when deciding whether a car mod is shitty or not, based on your examples:  Stance. If your car is too low and has too much camber to drive over a sleeping policeman, it's shitty. This does not apply to race cars. When compensated for with airbags, it's sort of forgivable in my opinion.    Lowriders should follow a similar criteria.  A truck with a huge body lift and low profile tyres, fabricated to crawl around on the tarmac is also shitty, like this. If it's done for usability, its fine. Like this, or this.   Track cars, which are made to look like track cars for no benefits on the track are shitty. Like this.  Some modification can be shitty, even if they were a nice idea, if they are executed poorly.   These are my opinions, but a lot of them seem to be shared on this subreddit.   I also disagree that the ""donk"" scene is just as respectable as any other scene. It's just as respectable as the lifted trucks on low profile chrome, the show vehicles for ""loudness of your stereo"" competitions, and body kitted toyota priuses."

Shitty_Car_Mods,3cflpj,OsnapsonJC,-7,Wed Jul 8 02:19:23 2015 UTC,"A donk is the very definition of shitty.  I prefer my cars stock and will only modify problematic things.  For example, the starter on your car is known for failure, but you can put on a starter from two model years later where the manufacturer fixed the defect.  That is 100% OK in my book.  Otherwise, the modifications have to deal with actual performance.  Upgrade the suspension and install a roll cage and fire suppression for the track?  That's A-OK in my book.  I'm generally fine with engine, suspension and braking mods if done to increase performance.  I draw the line at cosmetic stuff.  These wheels have nothing to do with performance.  They actually hurt performance and mileage.  Meaning the driver is an enormous douchenozzle or shitbag.  Maybe both.  Further, if stuff you do to your car defines you as a person, you are a complete fucking loser.  You don't distinguish yourself through material goods.  If you want to distinguish yourself, you have to do something.  Learn a new language or two.  Earn a Ph.D.  Found a charitable organization.  Which would you find more impressive, a guy who started a community kitchen for low-income families, or a guy who comes up to you and says, ""yo I gotz 24"" rimz!""?"

Go on Craigslist and try to find an all original,  unmolested 300zx or 240sx in halfway decent shape. They get up past 10k in some cases. And I think it's because the supply/demand is thrown out of balance by people that do shit like this that thins out the supply.

Look at the hakosuka, it's a 50 year classic and yet people still have no hesitation to cut the fenders up to make room for flares.   Personally, I like that about Nissan; its your car, you're  allowed to do what you want to it.

No rust though, which surprises the shit out of me. I've had to basically rebuild the entire suspension this summer too.  It's hilarious to try and find replacement parts for them at wreckers, cause if something's broke on a Cherokee, there's a 99% chance it's broke on everyone else's. Case in point: I went to find a new console latch for mine, and out of the 4 or 5 Cherokees our pick-a-part had, every single one had a broken console latch.

Shitty_Car_Mods,3c7l5o,andrews2547,9,Sun Jul 5 19:33:18 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily failed.  Old Citroens used to sit on their bellies like this, as the hydropneumatic suspension lowered itself at rest.  I remember my dad had a Citroen BX, a passerby rapped the door and told him that his suspension had collapsed, he had to explain that it was sitting low as it had been sat all day, especially with the weight of his industrial steam parts in the boot!  It wasn't until the 90s Xantia that they fitted anti sink devices, as they were worried that they were scaring off perspective buyers. My 99 Xantia I used to lower when I parked it overnight, not only to exercise the suspension, but also as the guy across the road had a lowered Saxo, mine used to sit lower than his but it could manage a speed bump!"

Shitty_Car_Mods,3c7l5o,phlobbit,2,Mon Jul 6 21:26:38 2015 UTC,"They're nice and reasonably priced. Problem is current C5 is that it doesn't have the hydropneumatic suspension except as an option on exclusive spec. It also may not be directly replaced, it wasn't a huge seller, the GM Insignia replacement tie up didn't happen, and they are selling DS5 as their main D segment vehicle now"

Shitty_Car_Mods,3c3xo3,Macinman719,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:40:07 2015 UTC,"Yup, and probably would cost all of $10 to do it right. I used to have a jeep with some tasteful mods, and a lot of the jeep people were plasti dipping the wheels, grills, etc. Didn't look bad, and well, the grills were the same glossy paint that the body was. Came right off with no damage to the paint. I never did any of that stuff though...  The best way to do this though, is black vinyl. Like they would use to wrap an entire car in god awful advertisements. You can put a solid layer of black vinyl on your hood, and it'll look just the same as paint and peel off easily when you're done with it. Doesn't cost a lot, but more than $10.....They even have primer black colored vinyl! lol."

Shitty_Car_Mods,3c2gbs,scop3d,6,Sat Jul 4 06:06:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the extra weight of all that rim has to wreaking havoc on the components of that drivetrain"
Shitty_Car_Mods,3c2gbs,synthead,8,Sat Jul 4 05:33:52 2015 UTC,The drive ratio changes with the larger wheels.
Shitty_Car_Mods,3c2gbs,oscillating000,3,Sat Jul 4 06:44:45 2015 UTC,"This is true, but aftermarket wheels do usually weigh more than stock. The extra weight still puts more stress on the drivetrain, even with the decrease in RPMs."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3c2gbs,synthead,2,Sat Jul 4 06:58:15 2015 UTC,"They can, but most of them don't. That's the whole point. The rule of thumb is that 1 pound of rotating mass is roughly equivalent to 30 pounds stationary mass in performance.   Of course, obnoxious wheels like these are iffy as they probably weren't designed with performance in mind, but you get the idea."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3c2gbs,Hawkeye1113,2,Sat Jul 4 07:02:59 2015 UTC,Now the question is if they take more of a toll on the stock brakes he most likely still has.
Shitty_Car_Mods,3c2gbs,synthead,2,Sat Jul 4 07:11:54 2015 UTC,"Oh sure. Imagine if the wheels were golf cart wheels. The circumference of the smaller wheels means that the entire surface area of the brakes are used to stop only a couple feet or so.   Then imagine these. Same brakes, same surface area, but the circumference is multiple times the size. Naturally, more demand would go on the brakes for the larger wheel. It'd be the same thing as installing smaller brakes, in comparison."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3c2gbs,Hawkeye1113,3,Sat Jul 4 07:24:50 2015 UTC,"Totally makes sense. I was thinking about in terms of weight, but your explanation also gives a good insight into the same issue. Now all I can think about is how ridiculous those conversion vans that people put the tiny go-cart wheels on are."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3c2gbs,dirty_hooker,2,Sat Jul 4 07:29:10 2015 UTC,Leverage plays a pretty huge part as does mass. The extra weight being rotational has more effect than if you simply added that weight to the vehicle. I will mention that the limiting factor in brakes on most vehicles is the contact patch and tire compound. Even a minivan can lock the tires under hard braking so adding contact patch through rims and rubber isn't always a bad thing.
Shitty_Car_Mods,3c2gbs,GaiusBaltar_,0,Sat Jul 4 09:14:51 2015 UTC,I think you meant to say that the other way around.
Shitty_Car_Mods,3c2gbs,GaiusBaltar_,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:17:57 2015 UTC,Yeah but the effective drive ratio change is much more significant than the wheel weight. This also ruins the leverage that the brakes had.

Shitty_Car_Mods,3c2gbs,arepok,0,Mon Jul 6 01:10:11 2015 UTC,The 4t65 is much more resilient then people give it credit for. These wheels are still hard on it but it'll take it.
Shitty_Car_Mods,3c2gbs,frosty95,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:19:06 2015 UTC,Yea so long as you don't ride it too hard all the time it's just like any other. The guys who mod the supercharged versions usually have the most issues. I've got 80k miles on my GXP and tranny feels good so far. Its the 4t65-HD. I don't remember exactly what was different but it wasn't much.
Shitty_Car_Mods,3c2gbs,thebestv2,2,Sat Jul 4 17:14:09 2015 UTC,"You have a hardened chain and a beefy differential. The supercharged guys didn't get the hardened chain originally but anymore the only chain available is hardened. Beefy differential was put in all supercharged and v8 models. The rest of the internals are pretty stout. The main issues are the input shaft, chain, and 3rd clutches. If you start making giant power like 600+ HP you'll break the pump shaft and output shaft. You'll also need a built valve body by then."

Shitty_Car_Mods,3c2ym9,hockysa,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:17:19 2015 UTC,umm no. NA cars can be pretty powerful. Although the Supra NA isn't the McLaren F1 is proof
Shitty_Car_Mods,3c2ym9,WatchOutForDiarrhea,-7,Sun Jul 5 06:05:29 2015 UTC,It's a single turbo conversation.   Edit: I like the downvotes for listing an engine mod.
Shitty_Car_Mods,3c2ym9,hockysa,16,Sat Jul 4 07:23:24 2015 UTC,then that's an awesome mod

Shitty_Car_Mods,3c2ym9,cputnik,5,Sat Jul 4 07:25:13 2015 UTC,Pretty sure I've seen a vid of this thing in action it's got some get up and go so its not all terrible.
Shitty_Car_Mods,3c2ym9,smackythefrog,4,Sat Jul 4 07:08:38 2015 UTC,Supras can handle the bodykit cos they have the plums to match!
Shitty_Car_Mods,3c2ym9,jrd88,3,Sat Jul 4 13:23:38 2015 UTC,"The front slightly resembles a 550 Barchetta. It looks fine from the front, but the rear looks a little silly."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3c2ym9,illuxion,8,Sat Jul 4 14:47:40 2015 UTC,OK well this really isn't a shitty car MOD because the body kit on that Supra is from AB Flug and costs almost as much as the car does.  I will say it does not look that good with the paint job that it's has but just look up AB Flug Supra pics on Google and you will see that with other paint jobs it looks much better
Shitty_Car_Mods,3c2ym9,senntenial,6,Sat Jul 4 07:17:49 2015 UTC,"they're not that expensive, about $7k + the body work which is the expensive part.  The only problem for me is not running deep dish wheels, other than that it's pretty clean."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3c2ym9,epikman99,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:26:20 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who thinks it's silly to pay that much for that sort of kit on a car that already looks fantastic?  It looks like a salmon out of water trying to breathe.

Shitty_Car_Mods,3c2ym9,placebo_button,-1,Sat Jul 4 12:03:08 2015 UTC,I like certain body kits on the supra as well. But this one looks horrible. The dimensions and body lines look awful. The front is the worst .
Shitty_Car_Mods,3c2ym9,dtrainescobar,3,Sat Jul 4 12:54:57 2015 UTC,But brah its made by AB Flug! and costs $7k those 2 things cancel out the fact its fucking hideous. /s

Chrome trim over the blue, the fact that it's not all wrapped that way and the front end make me think it's paint. The explanation that makes the most sense to me is that it was crashes and the blue (or possibly maroon, but unlikely lol) panels are replacement parts that haven't been painted to match yet. But that would be an odd crash. Damage to passenger door, wing mirror, rear bumper, front fender, front bumper , and trunk but not the hood or rear fender or top. Did OP see the other side? If the other passenger door and wing mirror are blue I would be pretty confident in saying it's just bad taste. But even if OP didn't see the other side how likely is it that this was from a crash or a wrap? I think it's a really low chance all considered, especially since two tone (but generally better matching colors) Bentley's are pretty popular it seems."

Someone who spends $30k on their kid's car and then lets them ruin it is someone I would call rich. And either way someone who spends 30k on a car that they could get for half the price has money to waste.

Shitty_Car_Mods,3bsb59,WaterTK,2,Thu Jul 2 15:21:38 2015 UTC,"Mine is the '08 SRT8 First Edition, #3351 of 6400. I do agree about the interior on the newer models, the newer tail lights are pretty slick too, but it's all about the go fast bits instead of the creature comforts.  I've only had it a few months, original owner is my boss, but I love it so far. My biggest disappointment is that they only offered an auto on the First Editions, but it's a damn good one with a DiabloSport tuner on it, behaves like a clutch-less manual and it's faster (still have my mkIV GTI when I want to row my own). Part of me wants to put a cold air intake and an exhaust on it, but the other part of me is all ""Don't fuck with a numbered car!"""

Shitty_Car_Mods,3bsb59,IrrationalBees,47,Wed Jul 1 23:00:02 2015 UTC,Why is this shitty. Those welding rigs are expensive. It's at least dodge with dodge. And it's something different and uses stock parts so you can get them replaced fairly easy.
Shitty_Car_Mods,3bsb59,Brute1100,11,Wed Jul 1 21:53:50 2015 UTC,"Because standard LED trailer lights are much easier to install, look better, and cost less..."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3bsb59,BigWillyTX,19,Wed Jul 1 22:18:07 2015 UTC,"look better   Everything else may be true. But that is just your thoughts.   Cheaper yeah ok, but most of these trucks reach almost 100 grand by the time they are outfitted, price doesn't seem to be the issue.   Easier, you only install once. How much work needs to be done on tail lights for the life of a car? I have owned several cars that I couldn't even tell you how to open the tail lights to replace a bulb because they never went out during the 3-5 years I owned them.  Most of these rigs are about being unique, and he definitely has that going for him.  You have to look at this like a guys signature or his business card, he makes his livelihood out of that and so it needs to reflect him or his company and needs to make people remember him so he gets hired again."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3bsb59,Brute1100,8,Wed Jul 1 22:46:09 2015 UTC,"Welding trucks aren't cars that never get off the pavement. They knock and rattle around on lease roads and the is directly under the welders main work area (ie hot metal frags and slag everywhere) and that shit will get bumped into by bumper pull hitches so many times. Tail lights on these trucks get replaced yearly at least, whether the bulbs are burnt out or the lens is busted... So, I would rather replace a $10 light assembly than tear that car taillight section apart to replace a bulb (which would be a bitch due to how it's installed). And you can roll in to any hardware/truck accessory/auto parts store to replace the trailer light. No waiting on an order for a few days when you live on the road.  LEDS trailer lights are also brighter and when you haul a trailer or are backing up to something that is very valuable."

You can tell a company welder vs. a contract welder on the leases I work on. The rigs are either beat to high hell or are works of art, as this rig is working on being.

They weren't good at competing with things that involved effort, or skill, so they invented a ""movement"" that allowed them to buy their way in and up. Cruise control for cool.   Their achievements are buy things not widely available or just being anti-conformist in the most conformist possible way. They are the goth kids on South Park. Their exhibitions are driving over dips in the pavement. Seriously, look that shit up. They had to elevate their dumbassery into a ""movement"", ""scene"", and ""lifestyle"", in an attempt to make it beyond reproach. Same reason they claim its a form of self expression but they never have anything profound to say. ""Hater"" is a way to defuse detractors as people that are jealous or ""just don't get it"".   They use the term for the same reason they Stance. They are unable or unwilling to ever compete with people in a real sense, because there is a risk of failure. Stancers wont argue. Read the threads, its kind of fascinating. Its always ""sure whatever bro"" and ""stance makes em dance"".   Its the kids that never get picked for kickball making their own game and crying to the teacher when the bigger boys tell them that butt diddling isn't a sport. They are all the best at their made up sport, and can all claim to be the ""Illest"". This is what you get when you give participation trophies to everyone."

I'm a Towman in Aspen Colorado and I spend all winter pulling luxury AWD SUVs out of the ditch and off the guard rail.

Shitty_Car_Mods,3brlhj,TeamJim,-25,Wed Jul 1 16:35:04 2015 UTC,"i'm just saying in general, the R8 isn't too special anymore because the price depreciation is so significant.   edit:  like this one   http://www.audisouthaustin.com/used/Audi/2009-Audi-R8-austin-323d0d080a0a006407f98504a63dcec7.htm"
Shitty_Car_Mods,3brlhj,pertsix,35,Wed Jul 1 22:53:15 2015 UTC,"I don't know about that. I just did some quick looking at car values and found:  This car depreciated by about 40% if it originally sold for the 2015 base price.  A base honda civic with the same miles and same age has a KBB value depreciation of 52% of current MSRP. This number is inflated since I don't know what the original MSRP is for a 2009 civic, but I doubt it is inflated by more than 10%.  A 2009 Ferrari F430 with 17,198 miles is listed on Cars.com right now for $149,888. Assuming it is a base model, it sold for around $186,925 when new. That is a depreciation of 20%, but it has 62% fewer miles than the R8. Normalizing the milage (assuming depreciation is linear - probably a safe assumption for this case), the Ferrari would have a depreciation of roughly 32%. That is pretty close to the R8, especially since it is a collectable F model.   So looking at those numbers, I'd say the R8 depreciation is right in the middle between low-end non-collectable cars and high-end collectible cars."

Shitty_Car_Mods,3brlhj,pertsix,-12,Wed Jul 1 17:24:35 2015 UTC,"a Honda Civic is a commodity car. comparing it's depreciative rate is akin to comparing beer prices to wine prices. no one expects a great vintage wine to sit on shelves and sink 50%, so a fair condition 6 year old R8 shouldn't drop 50%, either:  http://i.imgur.com/WKhXwPW.png  also, a F430 isn't a fair comparison. the current California is a better equivalent:  http://i.imgur.com/hmwmWNX.png"

They seem to show that neither of the cars are even close to ""fair market value"" for their milage.   All I was trying to show is that a (much) less valuable car and a much more valuable car both have comparable depreciation rates to the R8."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3brlhj,fatcat2040,-4,Wed Jul 1 22:48:24 2015 UTC,"20% depreciative rate for a Ferrari and a 50% depreciate rate of a Honda is a 30% difference. you're making the argument that 50% depreciative rate of an R8 is acceptable because a Honda has a 50% depreciative rate. so you're saying a supercar is as much of a commodity as a Honda and that's OK? because that's my entire point. people buy them at the low-end BECAUSE they're that cheap.  if someone gave you a $5.00 and took $2.50 from you, you'd be pissed off more than $1.00."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3brlhj,Drainclog,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:32:54 2015 UTC,"But the ferrari isn't 20%, its 32% if you normalize the milage. And the Civic is likely lower than the 52% I calculated because a new 2009 Civic cost less than a new 2015 Civic (which is the MSRP I used for this). So the numbers are probably more like 45% for the Civic, 40% for the R8, and 32% for the Ferrari.   The point I was making is not that they are the same (I miss-typed when I said that they were comparable in my second comment), but that they match with where they are in the vehicle cost spectrum. Ferrari has the least, Honda has the most, and the Audi is in the middle.  Also, having similar depreciation rates is not the same as being a commodity product."

I mean, don't ever try to step foot into a discuss on Ford vs Chevy trucks, especially not if you drive a Dodge. For that matter, ever see an iPhone vs Android discussion? PlayStation vs Xbox?  You may not personally feel that way about your car, and you may look down your nose on what you see as an inferior product, and you may scoff at the idea of brand loyalty...

Shitty_Car_Mods,3bt3ut,failcarstv,2,Thu Jul 2 01:24:00 2015 UTC,Here's a fun question.  Does anyone here know why the original Dodge Charger had that big of a spoiler?
Shitty_Car_Mods,3bt3ut,smallfrie876,3,Thu Jul 2 01:53:56 2015 UTC,"Racing. The Daytona was the highest performing Charger in the linup, it was pretty much the street version of this old NASCAR car and shared the insane wing."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3bt3ut,Benzanfoxet,3,Thu Jul 2 06:40:47 2015 UTC,"Well you're the closest anyone has gotten.  It was a rule that any Nascar back in the day had to be based off a production car.  In which a minimum of 500 cars had to be produced.    So they're technically the same car.    Anywho, the reason the wing on the Dodge Charger is that big is so that the trunk can open.   That's it.

Shitty_Car_Mods,3bpsiw,Mr-Garrison,46,Wed Jul 1 04:19:45 2015 UTC,I'll take a guess and assume he's going wide body and still needs to drive his car at some points. Or it may have been at a show when the pic was taken. Either way I would probably bet that the car is on its way to a wide body or flare setup.
Shitty_Car_Mods,3bpsiw,uzername_ic,30,Wed Jul 1 04:56:15 2015 UTC,"you're a glass half-full guy, i like that."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3bpsiw,ItsMikeMaine,8,Wed Jul 1 05:38:13 2015 UTC,I rolled around like this for a few days on my track car that has widebody flares. My daily driver was in the shop so I had to use something.   Judging by his wheel setup I am 99% positive he is going wide body.

Mostly for go, but some for looks. I also co own Dumpybutts.com which is like a more diy stancenation/speedhunters. We are just into what's different and our perception of cool. Ive grown to love all types of builds. I'm also a Honda tech by day. Cars pretty much are the only thing in my life. I dislike unreasonable hate onna legit build.

Shitty_Car_Mods,3bpsiw,DaGhostQc,2,Sun Jul 5 15:53:54 2015 UTC,"Its actually a pretty good job considering once the car is finished no one will see it.  It looks janky because of the the way the door line made the cut go. But the radius is actually really decent at the top. Not bad for probably eyeballing under some marks for the widebody/flare.  Sure it could be much better, but considering its not going to be seen after the widebody/flares its really doesn't matter. The paint didn't come off above the cut and I think that's all that really matters."

For anyone who doesn't understand why this is dangerous.  They are increasing the rotational mass.  Both in size and weight.  Just like you can spin in a circle faster with your arms tucked in rather than your arms extended out.  By adding giant rims and not addressing the brakes you are increasing the stopping distance and putting stress on factory parts that were not meant to take the abuse.

Funny thing about these numbers though, all this is calculated on the Prius when the engine is actually running. If I'm at a red light, my car's engine isn't running, displaying 0.0l/ 100km. This isn't added however because the car isn't moving, whereas a similar car with TDi would be still be idling (unless the car has ESS.)   So yes, on paper, they have a similar MPG, but in the real world a Prius would have to be filled less in stop start traffic, which is why they are popular as city cars and why I chose a Prius over a Jetta TDi."
Shitty_Car_Mods,3bizn4,MrAdamXD,-1,Tue Jun 30 07:33:11 2015 UTC,They really only have an advantage if you do a lot of city driving. I know a few people who buy them as commuter cars and do mostly highway driving. In that situation your better off with a TDI.
Shitty_Car_Mods,3bizn4,Colonial_Morphology,3,Tue Jun 30 15:26:28 2015 UTC,"The Prius still edges out the TDI on the highway for fuel efficiency, though, and dominates it in the city.  Somebody also graphed the speed and efficiency of the Gen 3 Prius (referred to as ZVW30 in the graph) and the TDI, and showed the Prius to be more efficient than the TDI at all of the recorded speeds.  The available data suggests that you're better off with a Prius either way."

Happy to see that this truck is getting some off road use, and doing so very well!"

Shitty_Car_Mods,3bj7up,I00PercentFresh,2,Mon Jun 29 19:11:20 2015 UTC,You would think the giant subaru or scion emblem on the steering wheel and other parts of the interior would tip them off though...
Shitty_Car_Mods,3bj7up,Wizzle-Stick,2,Tue Jun 30 14:20:21 2015 UTC,Well their heads are in the driver's lap the whole time so how would they notice ;)

Shitty_Car_Mods,3bj7up,tool_of_justice,-8,Tue Jun 30 12:22:54 2015 UTC,Overall its a nice car   Well it had potential but the tuners hate it because the engine can't take boost very well. It's apparently a very badly designed engine.
Shitty_Car_Mods,3bj7up,jimmybrite,2,Tue Jun 30 05:58:02 2015 UTC,Because hes's wrong? These cars take boost incredibly well.   Quite a few people running in the 400whp range on stock internals.

Shitty_Car_Mods,3bj7up,fuzzydogdog,2,Tue Jun 30 07:40:20 2015 UTC,Or say scion is like the supersport version of lexus ;) I don't think lexus cars usually turn heads.
Shitty_Car_Mods,3bj7up,senntenial,19,Tue Jun 30 14:56:38 2015 UTC,I saw a 2015 stingray with Scuderia badges today... What are these people thinking?

Shitty_Car_Mods,3bj7up,14_year_old_girl,8,Mon Jun 29 21:02:09 2015 UTC,No. Anyone who owns a nice car knows they are Penis magnets.
Shitty_Car_Mods,3bj7up,Stoned_Like_Shaggy,4,Tue Jun 30 03:35:36 2015 UTC,I just imagined a bunch of guys with their members stuck to the car. Like literal magnets. Thanks for the image.
Shitty_Car_Mods,3bj7up,RunningNumbers,2,Tue Jun 30 03:38:12 2015 UTC,It's not far from the truth haha
Shitty_Car_Mods,3bj7up,Stoned_Like_Shaggy,4,Tue Jun 30 04:10:56 2015 UTC,The new stingrays do look like exotics though. Not justifying it but they do look kinda like a Ferrari from the front at first glace.

Shitty_Car_Mods,3bj7up,Grimoire,10,Tue Jun 30 04:06:49 2015 UTC,Does Ferrari sell their badge to be put on cars? That sounds like the kind of watering-down-the-brand-name that Ferrari doesn't put up with.
Shitty_Car_Mods,3bj7up,infinex,8,Mon Jun 29 18:36:48 2015 UTC,"I imagine they must sell the real badge at some point for autobody repair, but probably only to approved shops."

Shitty_Car_Mods,3bj7up,el_muerte17,8,Tue Jun 30 05:22:55 2015 UTC,Unless the emblem cost around 20k I doubt it. The resale value of 86's is pretty high.

I work at a shop out of state though, so I know my shit damn well, but I don't tell them though, b/c I don't like being the pompous asshole customer.

If you aren't familiar with these badges, you really wouldn't be able to identify that as the shitty mod. The four is only legible because no other number really looks like that and the second number looks like six but could be an eight or a zero.   Edit: didn't even notice the exhaust. But that's more because it's fairly small and a similar color to the bottom of the car. I don't think picture quality would've really helped there."
