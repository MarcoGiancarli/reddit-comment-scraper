CatSlaps,375akv,amphetamachine,27,Mon May 25 02:03:53 2015 UTC,"I know right, I'd hug this cat just to piss it off."
CatSlaps,375akv,anonymousdeity,8,Mon May 25 03:10:19 2015 UTC,"100% true:  2 weeks ago I played with/taunted and brushed my friends cat for a few hours.  Got him so worked up and all like this cat at the end.  I was about to leave so I reached down and hugged him goodbye.  He was still agitated that he grasped the arm wrapped around him and bit right in.    Imagine looking at an arm flat on the table, palm down.  One of his bottom teeth went in on the side towards my body, just above the wrist.  In a split second he then pulled upward that portion of muscle and skin, and managed to put one of his top teeth in a full 180 degrees on the other side of my arm, pulling both sides together.  The aftermath had me spurting blood from the puncture wound literally like it was a pump squirtinf blood out of a limb in a bad horror movie, just splurting right out like a full inch or two into the air with every heart beat.  Didn't look bad at first, but oh man.  The pulling together damaged underneath, so over the course of the week most of my arm on both sides and up my hand became one giant bruise.  And 24 hours after the bite I was at a walk in clinic because it was clearly inflamed and infected, so I had to take a strong course of antibiotics for a week which messed up my system - Even minor cat bites have a high incidence of infection.  This was not minor; he definitely got some bacteria implanted under the skin there.  It was extremely inflamed and painful throughout the whole arm by that point, with the arm feeling utterly weak - like lifting a piece of paper would be too much.  Luckily at around day three the pain started subsiding, and by day four it was no pain - just annoying explaining to people why my entire arm was a bruised mess. (and hand - for some reason about 5 days in the bruise expanded right up my hand to the knuckles overnight.)  Really glad I got those antibiotics sooner than later.  They were really strong and sucked for my digestive system, but it did the trick.  He just was never taught not to bite while playing, and she doesn't play with him if he gets frisky.  Great cat though.  No blame to him, I know what he's like when I get him worked up and I should have known better.  I'll be playing with him again first change I get.  Just with more caution.  Maybe leather falconers gloves.  He's really the nicest cat though, not shy and loves everyone.  Point is:  Nope, you really don't want to hug that pissed off cat.  Especially not to piss it off further."
