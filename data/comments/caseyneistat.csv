caseyneistat,3e4k59,HaddonH,4,Wed Jul 22 02:13:50 2015 UTC,"Nope, just a Canon logo. The screen folds out and docks in that space."
caseyneistat,3e4k59,HaddonH,2,Wed Jul 22 02:19:00 2015 UTC,Did you really not have to cut the sticker down?
caseyneistat,3e4k59,HaddonH,3,Wed Jul 22 02:44:11 2015 UTC,Fit perfectly.
caseyneistat,3e4k59,Floating_Pickle,3,Wed Jul 22 03:15:16 2015 UTC,"Is cool, so don't test it by losing your camera. Better if the sticker never really comes into play.  If you can find a place for a 'do more' message that would be good to."
caseyneistat,3e4k59,HaddonH,2,Wed Jul 22 04:25:49 2015 UTC,Did you get it in those free sticker packs or did you get them in another way?

caseyneistat,3e2aht,SwellandDecay,7,Tue Jul 21 12:14:01 2015 UTC,Interesting to hear Casey say how this initial launch wasnt supposed to be for this many people. It could definitely just be marketing but it would also explain a lot of the unfinished-ness of the current app.

caseyneistat,3e2aht,NatiZus,7,Wed Jul 22 08:56:13 2015 UTC,"I love the vlogs, but I do have to admit, Mail-Time, and the occasional ""running into fans"" and spending however many minutes of the vlog on that, is kind of getting boring."
caseyneistat,3e2aht,WhenItsHalfPastFive,31,Tue Jul 21 13:41:03 2015 UTC,"Really? I find mail time really entertaining, it's crazy to see all the shit people send him.  I don't even mind seeing people running in to him because it's organic and unscripted"
caseyneistat,3e2aht,Walker131,18,Tue Jul 21 13:48:37 2015 UTC,"most of Mail-Time now is just people sending him stuff so casey will show it on the vlog and they hope it is some sort of promotional technique. Not much of today's mail-time, but most others, yes. I don't think Casey likes it either, he complained about it in a vlog earlier.  And the running into the fans thing, thats great for them. I just don't really find it an efficient use of vlog time. There is absolutely nothing interesting about people waiting outside of his studio begging for him to put them in the vlog. I feel like theres better stuff he can document with his vlogs than that.   Just my two cents."
caseyneistat,3e2aht,WhenItsHalfPastFive,-4,Tue Jul 21 13:52:59 2015 UTC,"That bugged me about the ""human head"" mail time. I couldnt help but notice how Casey turned the branded side of the box to face the camera the whole time."

Really? Why do people even watch these vlogs or his videos in general if you think that its just paid advertising."
caseyneistat,3e2aht,CrippledCrip,2,Tue Jul 21 17:51:32 2015 UTC,"No, what I think he was saying is that people are sending him stuff for Casey to open in MailTime so it will help promote their products. We've seen it with all sorts of different products in previous mailtimes. I believe Casey even addressed this topic."
caseyneistat,3e2aht,WhenItsHalfPastFive,3,Wed Jul 22 01:15:36 2015 UTC,"Where did I say I thought it was paid advertising?  Since you asked so nicely, I think he gives whoever sends him stuff free advertising as a way of saying thank you. I'm not a huge fan of this so I mentioned it. Why does this offend you so greatly?  Edit: downvote all you want, I never said it was paid advertising"
caseyneistat,3e2aht,Vaguely_Racist,-5,Tue Jul 21 18:32:11 2015 UTC,"If you don't like his vlogs then don't watch them? It's as simple as that surely. I don't see why people criticize things like this, its not obligatory to watch things you don't enjoy any more. You're mean't to watch with enjoyment not examine them for every detail you dislike."
caseyneistat,3e2aht,readerjames,9,Tue Jul 21 15:52:39 2015 UTC,"Where do you see us saying we don't enjoy his vlogs? We're talking about how mail time seems a bit like a commercial. If you don't like our discussion, dont read it :)"

caseyneistat,3e3wl8,rundmcc,3,Tue Jul 21 20:13:27 2015 UTC,Not every update is a good update. Just because something is updated doesn't necessarily make the app any better for the user in terms of experience. So yes it's a guess. Who knows what will happen. And the way people were reacting implicated that the app wouldn't get better from here.

caseyneistat,3e3764,Hawtdogg,3,Tue Jul 21 16:40:45 2015 UTC,I've tried to 4 times no luck. It was about a minute after he released it on Twitter that I tried.
caseyneistat,3e3764,RUN_CHASE_RUN,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:47:12 2015 UTC,"Me too. Just saw he tweeted about Beme being down for 90 seconds so maybe that had something to do with it. Tried again when he said it was back up, but still no luck. So frustrating.  Edit: Try it now! Finally worked for me"
caseyneistat,3e3764,doyouevenpancake,2,Tue Jul 21 16:57:19 2015 UTC,It worked for me now!
caseyneistat,3e3764,lilmussels,3,Tue Jul 21 16:59:21 2015 UTC,"No, I tried it within 2 minutes of him posting it. It seems unbelievable that 10,000 codes were used that quickly."
caseyneistat,3e3764,rockfield1,3,Tue Jul 21 16:52:34 2015 UTC,GO TRY RIGHT NOW I just did and it worked

caseyneistat,3e36md,Hawtdogg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:43:45 2015 UTC,Saw on Twitter Beme temporarily crashed. Kept trying TULIP and it worked. NEVER GIVE UP.
caseyneistat,3e35zv,thegroovologist,2,Tue Jul 21 16:32:45 2015 UTC,Code is TULIP.
caseyneistat,3e0vve,purecssusername,4,Tue Jul 21 02:32:31 2015 UTC,"Exactly! I fully agree with this article, BEME ux sucks! Those are all good changes, except i'd also add a manual recording button for devices without a proximity sensor ( iPad? ). Especially if beme is to come to Android, one must assume that beme will be used on such devices. BTW, the logo is really ugly! I know it's trying to be minimalistic and simple, but I find it boring and unappealing."
caseyneistat,3e0vve,aleqsio,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:32:13 2015 UTC,"I agree the logo is pretty bad. The proximity sensor is a clever idea, though I do agree with you that there should probably be a more normal way of recording."
caseyneistat,3e0vve,fastsitebuy,3,Wed Jul 22 06:11:15 2015 UTC,"Did you write this? I think the UX is going to be overhauled with this week's update, which is why Casey was asking people to not download this version; it's not finished and won't make sense to the general public who hasn't been following his vlog."
caseyneistat,3e0vve,letusknow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:25:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's that bad. I think the automatic proximity sensor record is great, I don't want to have to tap a button to then have to use the proximity sensor.   The only thing worth doing is making sure people know how to use it. For instance the article is wrong when saying that the react button appears randomly, it actually appears when you move your finger or tap with an other finger.  I would also not trust Gabe as any sort of reliable critic in terms of design."
caseyneistat,3e0vve,netposer,0,Tue Jul 21 18:23:46 2015 UTC,"Since I'm an Android user I have not used BeMe. I agree with the OP on how to make it better and more intuitive during first use.  What scares is BeMe will send video/audio without you ever knowing, correct? Or do you have to open the app and have it in the foreground to record? If so, what happens when you are perusing other BeMe's and accidentally cover the proximity sensor? Does the phone have to be vertical? Can you set the phone down and send hundreds of BeMe's? What about propping it up against the wall?"
caseyneistat,3e0vve,dreamer_soul,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:09:04 2015 UTC,If you go to the jobs sections on beme you could see that they could use a UX engineer! that means that they acknowledge that they need help in the UX side of things

caseyneistat,3e0uuh,MiggySay,2,Tue Jul 21 02:59:56 2015 UTC,I'll take some stickers. Stickers make the whole world go round.... right? A Helicopter does sound tempting though.
caseyneistat,3e0uuh,Jewinajar,29,Tue Jul 21 06:36:45 2015 UTC,Nah I'm pretty sure that the App just sucks shit and he doesn't know what to do.
caseyneistat,3e0uuh,A_Wooper,4,Tue Jul 21 02:39:40 2015 UTC,Yeah maybe
caseyneistat,3e0uuh,eggmysta,4,Tue Jul 21 02:59:17 2015 UTC,I believe he's holding out until they get the update (as he suggested for people to do) and the new version of the app is released. It's still in its beta stages and all.
caseyneistat,3e0uuh,thisdesignup,3,Tue Jul 21 03:30:03 2015 UTC,"Agree, but why release it. If it isn't ready. It its people off from using it."
caseyneistat,3e0uuh,PusH_Scotty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:25:21 2015 UTC,People were already leaking info. That could be one reason. Also sometimes things are released early so that they can do stress tests and get user data to see how people use the app.
caseyneistat,3e0uuh,travelsnake,3,Tue Jul 21 11:51:06 2015 UTC,Yeah what A_Wooper said. Casey even suggested us not to download the app basically. Its just a beta right now. My guess is they are testing out the servers and what not.
caseyneistat,3e0uuh,PusH_Scotty,2,Tue Jul 21 04:00:40 2015 UTC,"maybe its just a clever marketing move. casey knows how high the expectations were set by his constant teasing via the vlogs. maybe his plan was to release the shitty version of beme, underwhelm everybody and get the hate out of the way first and than flash everyone with a much better version of his app.  i don't care either way, i love his moviemaking skills and have no use for sharing. i'm not disappointed, he doesn't owe me anything, life is great, i still watch his vlogs every day."
caseyneistat,3e0uuh,MiggySay,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:40:15 2015 UTC,I could not agree more!! No matter what I will always know and love him as movie maker/vlogger. He is great at that.
caseyneistat,3e0uuh,nezia,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:27:05 2015 UTC,In my experience with trying to get started on it i was unable to create a username so some odd reason. The app kept telling me that the username/number were not correct. I don't understand
caseyneistat,3e0uuh,benz240,6,Tue Jul 21 06:38:35 2015 UTC,"Maybe he'll pull a ""Steve Jobs"" on it and after sitting it out for a while just sell a former design-mistake as a new feature...just like Apple did with ""copy & paste"", which all the iPhones were lacking of until 2 years in.  For beme this would be ""turning the display on to be used for framing and direct user feedback""...but wait...then beme would just be a blatant copy of snapchat."
caseyneistat,3e0uuh,IsakSjobacka,3,Tue Jul 21 03:07:37 2015 UTC,"it looks to be a pump and dump.  he's hoping Beme will attract enough users to sell their potential engagement to advertisers, thus raising the value of the company. in a couple of years, the 2mil investment will be valued at anywhere from 10-50mil is my guess.  doubt it will continue to escalate unless they ""add features"" to make it similar to and somehow overtake Snapchat..."
caseyneistat,3e0uuh,MorgansButtcrack,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:18:31 2015 UTC,"The co-owner Matt, is very talented, and I think after a few updates, Beme will be overtaking Snapchat, especially considering the fact that Snapchat seems to be taking a lot of steps in order to block jailbreakers. Hopefully Casey and the team doesen't do this."

caseyneistat,3dxvyd,JagsTuga,19,Mon Jul 20 12:57:34 2015 UTC,Maybe it's just me but the vlog seems fine to me. I don't see any criticism in the YT comments either. The only criticism I see is on this subreddit.
caseyneistat,3dxvyd,triag,19,Mon Jul 20 15:48:00 2015 UTC,"A lot of people are kidding themselves thinking he is having a ""toll taken on him"" from all the criticism. His app is top 100 in beta, and people are saying he is sad? Get out of here!  A lot of people are hating, and just want to see him burn in flames because they are SO salty about the app not being what they thought it was.  I can promise you this subreddit does not reflect the whole fandom of Casey. This is the harshest group of fans out of the bunch and it's mostly because people are so butthurt over the stupid fucking app.   Can I for one say I am not a Casey Neistat fan because of his app, and I don't give a rats ass if it is good or bad? I LOVE Casey because of his movies/vlogs."
caseyneistat,3dxvyd,TheFoxForce5Joke,11,Mon Jul 20 18:18:29 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm a little irritated about the whole thing. I discovered Casey a long time ago but for whatever reason stopped watching his channel. I only recently rediscovered it (like a week before Beme launched) and I kind of wish I could just continue enjoying his fun and well made content without people bitching about the app.
caseyneistat,3dxvyd,Super_Zac,7,Mon Jul 20 18:44:32 2015 UTC,"People bitching about Beme and how Casey's vlogs are ""ignoring"" the cristism and looking sad are making this sub a mess, and irritates the hell out of me.   I for one miss the subreddit when it was smaller and people weren't as bitchy and rude. I was here when there were only 2 mods, and less than 1,000 people in the sub. I have been watching Casey's videos since 2011. This place has turned sour with all the hate.  I really want to make another subreddit making fun of the ridiculous things people saying on this sub because it is SO delusional, and hilarious."
caseyneistat,3dxvyd,TheFoxForce5Joke,8,Mon Jul 20 18:58:24 2015 UTC,"Holy fuck, this. It's amazing how a caseyneistat subreddit, a community of people who like him enough to subscribe to it are talking this much trash about a beta app. It's like people are scrapping up every little thing to try to bash on beme. ""Oh, the app shoots short video clips and sends them to people? Lynch Casey for copying snapchat!"" This is a beta app that will only continue to get better."
caseyneistat,3dxvyd,Xwec,9,Mon Jul 20 19:27:39 2015 UTC,"You know what makes me laugh?  People call any pro-Casey people ""fanboys"" or ""Casey Neistat dick suckers"" on a subreddit directly towards Casey Neistat.   AREN'T WE ALL SUPPOSE TO BE BIG CASEY NEISTAT FANS HERE?!   The logic here is so delusional it's hilarious."
caseyneistat,3dxvyd,TheFoxForce5Joke,2,Mon Jul 20 19:34:42 2015 UTC,"My dad is fine.  Beme is the best app right now. Everyones saying its great, so stop"
caseyneistat,3dxvyd,owenneistat,0,Tue Jul 21 01:45:18 2015 UTC,There is 0% chance that is owen. You're gullible.
caseyneistat,3dxvyd,postposter,0,Tue Jul 21 02:37:19 2015 UTC,Beme had a great launch. It made it to the top of the list on the App Store. It has been featured on many online and paper articles. The massive amounts of demand for codes just shows the popularity of this app.   /r/caseyneistat community has the upmost respect for Casey. They just set exceedingly high expectations for Beme. You won't find much criticism of Beme outside of /r/caseyneistat.   Beme will only get better once it finds its place in social media.
caseyneistat,3dxvyd,triag,-1,Tue Jul 21 04:02:49 2015 UTC,"It's not in beta it has been released. It just has not been given an update since it's release. The ""beta"" came before it was available on the Apple App Store."
caseyneistat,3dxvyd,Astrophsx,2,Tue Jul 21 02:18:39 2015 UTC,"It's an arbitrary distinction in the end, but I think it's apt. There are some well-known bugs (phone number verification sticks out) and crashes aren't uncommon. Also there's credible speculation they're going to rework the UI/graphics based on who they're looking to hire at the moment.   The terminology certainly isn't as strict as you seem to believe in any case. GMail was invite-only (just like Beme is currently) during its beta release in '04, lost the invite requirement but remained in beta in '07, and didn't leave beta until '09."
caseyneistat,3dxvyd,postposter,2,Mon Jul 20 21:30:26 2015 UTC,"I would classify it as beta.   They weren't planning the actual launch for some time (the launch date was not the same as the day it was released), and they are using the codes to keep the downloads low so they can adjust the app and to keep the bad experiences to a minimum as per what Casey said.   Obviously it is not being treated like an official launch."
caseyneistat,3dxvyd,TheFoxForce5Joke,0,Mon Jul 20 23:22:57 2015 UTC,"Curious as to why you would classify it as a Beta? It is open to the general public and not a hand selected group of people. The app has all of its features enabled. The media has already referred to the app as launched. Unless I'm wrong here you are assuming the launch date based upon what was hidden (for the most part) on his vlog on the wall. Casey refers to the app as the ""first version"" and the update as ""the next version"". He never refers to it as the beta version."
caseyneistat,3dxvyd,Astrophsx,3,Mon Jul 20 21:44:50 2015 UTC,"Ok. You're generally confusing ""closed/internal beta"" for any and all beta releases. Launch can refer to the release of any version, alpha, beta, full - whatever. There can even be a beta version of an app/game at the same time as a full version, which lets users test new features being considered for full release.  Like I said before though, it's all arbitrary and idiomatic language dependent on the company producing the software."
caseyneistat,3dxvyd,postposter,11,Mon Jul 20 22:08:13 2015 UTC,Kinda boring.

caseyneistat,3dxvyd,spread-summer,14,Mon Jul 20 18:09:34 2015 UTC,This vlog felt a bit off from the usual :/
caseyneistat,3dxvyd,DJToaster,4,Mon Jul 20 18:40:43 2015 UTC,"It looks like ""Beme week"" is taking its toll on casey. With all the criticism too, the vlogs seem less cheerful. I don't know where casey should go from here, take a break from vlogging? Focus on improving Beme? (That seems unlikely from my point of view) I hope tomorrow's vlog is   A: More cheerful  B: Looks to address the problems of Beme"
caseyneistat,3dxvyd,CocacolaGARCIA,8,Mon Jul 20 13:13:03 2015 UTC,"This subreddit of ~2,000 people are the only group of people who are really bent out of shape about his app, besides no android app and Beme codes.  He doesn't have much criticism to address."
caseyneistat,3dxvyd,TheFoxForce5Joke,4,Mon Jul 20 13:33:47 2015 UTC,"Because on Twitter just want to make a good ""impression"" in front of Casey, they fear that if they twitt (not sure if it's the word xD) something honest about the app and give their opinion, Casey (or his fans) will reply them harshly or block them from his twitter or Beme. Other theory is they don't care about if the app is good or bad, they just like Beme because it was created by Casey, they just to look good in front of their ""idol"".  I personally don't have a twitter account so I don't really know much of how twitter works and stuff like that."
caseyneistat,3dxvyd,TheFoxForce5Joke,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:21:03 2015 UTC,"Casey doesn't care and doesn't have enough time to individually delete and block any hate or negative messages toward Beme.  People just don't have enough of a backbone to say something directly towards his Twitter account.   As for loving the app just because it's Casey, I am sure it happens. That happens with every popular artist, filmmaker or public figure however. People will buy, support, etc anything if they are a huge fan. It is apart of it, and it isn't something that just happens with Casey."
caseyneistat,3dxvyd,dayallnash,3,Mon Jul 20 18:55:19 2015 UTC,I think the best thing Casey could do right now is to not ignore people's criticisms. Second best thing he could do is make the vlogs tell a story like they used to. Not sure if this one hits the mark.
caseyneistat,3dxvyd,TheFoxForce5Joke,0,Mon Jul 20 19:05:00 2015 UTC,"This subreddit of ~2,000 people are the only group of people who are really bent out of shape about his app, besides no android app and Beme codes.

caseyneistat,3dxvyd,dayallnash,0,Mon Jul 20 13:34:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not kidding myself about anything - I don't think there's a majority, but there are people who are vocal enough to make themselves known. Looking at sites like The Verge (his favourite website) also give some indication that the app may at least be generating fake hype. He must have heard it, it would be impossible to be the CEO of this new company and somebody who is eager to be better and 'do more' and not hear the criticisms about the app."
caseyneistat,3dxvyd,TheFoxForce5Joke,2,Mon Jul 20 18:24:08 2015 UTC,"When you have 200,000+ for you beta and you have less than 1,000 people complaining about your app, it isn't ""ignoring"".  Just because a small group of people comes out against his app that doesn't mean he has to reply to each individual complaint. It would be useless because the complaints are so minute."
caseyneistat,3dxvyd,bored_lad,-1,Mon Jul 20 19:11:14 2015 UTC,I agree with the other posts today's blog just felt off and boring from the usual. I know that weekend blogs are usually more laid back etc. however today's just felt different.
caseyneistat,3dxvyd,SwellandDecay,-6,Mon Jul 20 19:19:56 2015 UTC,"Lamest vlog I've seen in a while. Where's the trademark Casey style we've all come to love? No opening scene, no timelapse, very little actual content. Editing and music choice seemed lazy.  All this seems to point to Casey maybe feeling a little down about reception his app has been receiving, which is totally understandable. Ironically though, he seems to be obfuscating his feelings about the launch and has clearly become a little closed off to the public (A two question Q&A? No mention of his new company at all in the new vlog?).  I truly hope this doesn't become a new pattern for him. The majority of his success is built upon a revealing, open and unapologetic display of identity. He revealed himself in his videos, showed vulnerability in his uncompromising sense of purpose and style in ways that many of us struggle to match. The entire basis of his new app is coming from that idea of vulnerability and sharing of self. The move now shouldn't be to hide his feelings and reactions; if he wants to weather this storm he needs maintain that vulnerable, revealing style and talk openly to us about what the reception of this app means to him and Beme.  Imagine how revolutionary that would be as a video series: A CEO of a struggling startup showing you from the inside out the work he's doing to improve his product and find its place in the market. Instead we have the recycled idea of hoverboarding at the beach and a complete lack of insight into the future of Casey's company.  I really do hope he figures it out. I'm still rooting for him, even if my trust has been shaken a little."
caseyneistat,3dxvyd,Alex_Olympic,11,Mon Jul 20 13:25:55 2015 UTC,"No time-lapse? There was, right at the start, as usual. People are desperate to read into anything he does 'oh he looks down, it must be because of Beme's 'bad' reception'. I'd say he is just tired, after a busy week..."

Some pretty cool commercials, which cut a lot due to 30 second to 60 second limit, have 4 second cuts and work. It all depends on how those 4 second cuts are done to keep the flow going.   Maybe in the way of the app it doesn't allow for good 4 second cuts. 4 second clips in an of themselves are not bad."
caseyneistat,3dxh5m,thisdesignup,2,Mon Jul 20 15:39:38 2015 UTC,"Four seconds is ages on production video. There are a few really elaborate tracking shots that are several minutes long, but for the most part, every cut is sub 4 seconds. Next time you watch something on tv, just say cut every time the slip switches. You get tired and can't keep up pretty quickly. Commercials and action (sci fi action especially) are the fastest."

caseyneistat,3dxkv5,MorgansButtcrack,0,Mon Jul 20 11:26:43 2015 UTC,"Yea. I just don't think Casey had anything to do with actually making the app and coding and whatnot. I can't really even call it Casey's app. Maybe he's the idea guy, idk"
caseyneistat,3dxkv5,cameraninja,-1,Tue Jul 21 03:10:12 2015 UTC,"I think he maybe had the idea and is just the frontman. The others did the hard work. If Beme can reveal people's cities, is it in danger of being misused? Have people discussed any dangers it could pose?"
caseyneistat,3dxkv5,MorgansButtcrack,2,Tue Jul 21 03:39:01 2015 UTC,"What kind of dangers? What kind of misuse are you talking about?   You can find people's SPECIFIC home addresses, marriage certificates, kids names and where they most likely go to school all online. All casey's app does is tell you the city (which you can block location data btw)  Not blindly defending Beme but Facebook can be abused to a greater extent than Beme ever could.   Also not sure if you live in an area where there are people like Casey that startup a company/App (i live near San Francisco)... those people do a tremendous amount of work even if they don't touch a line of code themselves.  Basically you seem to be underestimating the amount of work he has put into his company."
caseyneistat,3dxkv5,MorgansButtcrack,0,Tue Jul 21 03:52:19 2015 UTC,thank you for enlightenment  i am not in the tech business so dont know what possible dangers there could be ... hackers etc always find a way ...Beme no matter how 'secure' its privacy settings is still fallible
caseyneistat,3dxkv5,MorgansButtcrack,0,Tue Jul 21 06:45:48 2015 UTC,also the term 'hard work' is relative ... someone can work harder in a few hours than someone who is at work for 8 hours ... long hours dont always mean productivity

caseyneistat,3dtuag,waitingforpuberty,36,Sun Jul 19 12:07:59 2015 UTC,"I thought it was pretty funny when Casey said that he felt liberated since he doesn't have to look at the phone while recording. He's a film maker who absolutely loves editing, fresh camera angles, story telling. That's how he creates. I'm just not buying that he feels liberated with his app. He certainly likes the idea that others will feel liberated but Casey himself?...no way."
caseyneistat,3dtuag,thegroovologist,28,Sun Jul 19 12:25:49 2015 UTC,I am getting quite tired of hearing this BS. Casey explicitly stated in one of his early vlogs that this would not be a tool for creators. Instead it would be focused on your average Joe and their real unfiltered experiences. That's what Beme is. Casey never stated anything to the opposite. All you people complaining how Casey's strive for realism in his app is hypocritical considering his heavily edited movies don't understand that these two things are two completely different endeavours.
caseyneistat,3dtuag,-Strategos-,17,Sun Jul 19 13:31:26 2015 UTC,"He did say this, but then he also showed that creativity pyramid and compared what he was making to iMovie. Very mixed messages.  Also that whole ""idea thievery"" monologue he did has made him out to be a joke after Beme is essentially Snapchat and Vine combined but worse.  Honestly the way he was talking in his vlogs I was expecting a revolutionary video editing app. One that let you do all the complicated editing and recording but for novices. Things that professional editors wouldn't need but would be a stepping stone for the general public, just like how iMovie was for Casey.  A shallow shit knock off of Snapchat is not what he sold us in his vlogs but that's what Beme is."
caseyneistat,3dtuag,i_mormon_stuff,10,Sun Jul 19 14:13:58 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I think we all would have been even more disappointed if what he gave us was some video editing app."
caseyneistat,3dtuag,Lukester247,0,Sun Jul 19 18:59:31 2015 UTC,"ok but there's a middle ground here.   He did state that the app would allow anyone to create. As I stated above, there were specific instances where he pointed to something that involved more creative input from the user.   The whole 'Casey being a hypocrite because he heavily edits his movies', I agree, is a BS argument. However, the whole 'liberation' thing is absolute bullcrap/"
caseyneistat,3dtuag,thisdesignup,7,Sun Jul 19 13:39:20 2015 UTC,"He did state that the app would allow anyone to create.   It does and with absolutely no skill involved anyone create. Just because there is no editing doesn't mean it is not creating. He is building a tool for the average man and putting everyone else on that same level of creation. Quoting myself from an earlier comment.   It's as simple as walking on sand and creating foot prints. You're still creating but you are putting in little work. It allows everyone to create, on the same level playing field. So even those who don't have the skill to cut and frame a shot can still create a video to share with others.   Casey didn't lie to us. The simplicity doesn't remove that you are still creating, it is still a tool for sharing videos in the moment. A child draws with a crayon and that is simple, would you say the crayon is not a tool and that the child is not creating?"
caseyneistat,3dtuag,BroomSIR,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:42:32 2015 UTC,So he just made a tool for the lowest common denominator?

caseyneistat,3dtuag,reinvent_yourself,3,Tue Jul 21 08:51:43 2015 UTC,I haven't used beme but I think the idea of social media and film are two separate entities and that's why he can still make his heavily edited videos while maintaining that social media should be unedited. He's not trying to change filmmaking but he is trying to change how spontaneous video sharing works.

caseyneistat,3dtuag,postposter,3,Sun Jul 19 19:02:08 2015 UTC,"The pyramid of creativity served as a mission statement. His new company would fulfill the the top-tier of that pyramid - “create a tool that enables others to create”   But he explicitly stated in one of his vlogs - ""We're trying to build something for everyone, not for people who consider themselves creators; because that would be very limited. This is for everyone.""  It sounds like you just wanted him to make another imovie type tool, which would be really disappointing from Casey. This is not an app for creators, i don't know how much more explicit he could be.    Casey fails to comprehend that Facebook, Insta, Snapchat, Twitter don’t hinder authenticity, we do. Instagram filters and front facing cameras aren't the problem   So, are you saying there is some other way to stop people from being inauthentic? We can't stop people from being fake, filtering what they share, etc etc. What we can do is encourage people to not focus too much on filtering. And I think Beme is trying to do that considering the concept of not looking at your phone to share whatever you want to share.    I believe that’s why people are so angry. Basically a tool to share, not a tool to create.  Not to be a drama queen, I felt cheated and lied to by a guy who had my respect and admiration for so long.   I don't know how much more explicit Casey could have put it though, he straight up already said this is not for creators.   Look, I haven't used the app, I'm on Android.

Do more with less and move on. Spending time choosing a flattering filter and perfectly misspelled caption isn't art. It's a time-suck that makes people watch concerts/sunsets from behind a screen.  It sounds like you wanted the app to be a tool for fashioning yourself into another filmmaker or even another Casey. You don't need one for that. Buy a super 8 or just use your damn iPhone."
caseyneistat,3dtuag,nezia,2,Sun Jul 19 13:15:44 2015 UTC,"I definitely get your point and understand why it came across this way.   I'm pointing out the divide between what he was stating the app would be in the vlogs, and what it actually is. I'm honestly not interested in being a filmmaker, or another Casey for that matter.  That's why I had a specific interest in what he seemed to be building.   I didn't think it would be a Casey-style editing suite. I thought it would be something that allowed people to engage and make videos in a brand new way - Vine being the closest example.   I wasn't expecting a full-blown editing suite with 1000 different features."
caseyneistat,3dtuag,postposter,2,Sun Jul 19 13:34:28 2015 UTC,something that allowed people to engage and make videos in a brand new way   That's what Beme appears like to me. Are the specific limitations of it what disappoints you? Lots of people didn't/still don't like being limited to 6 seconds by Vine. Beme doesn't even have that strict of a limitation actually.
caseyneistat,3dtuag,postposter,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:38:51 2015 UTC,Beme allows you to share video snippets - that's it. There's 0 control. That's what bothers me. You can't talk about creating a tool that allows people to create and then pull that shit off.   Vine's limitations were conducive to creativity. Beme doesn't have that. It doesn't even try to be that because it's supposed to be 'Authentic'. Read above for my views on 'authenticity'
caseyneistat,3dtuag,1100101000,5,Sun Jul 19 13:42:48 2015 UTC,"The big issue is that ""creating anything"" itself isn't of any value.  The entry barriers to creation are already as low as they can get. You've got a tiny super computer with a built-in camera on you at all times, which connects you to the entire world within seconds. If everybody would use it to share everything without every outgoing filtering done on their side, that means without any type of editing or rethinking if it's worth sharing at all, all we get is a never ending flood of mediocrity. Noise.   I like that the people that I surround myself with don't share everything. There is no value in knowing everything of everybody, completely unedited.  There just is too little time in a day and in one's life in general to catch up with other people's unfiltered view of things. I don't even care to open all snapchat snaps from friends and family.  And yes, there will be a few creators that will be able to find their way to work and play with the arbitrary limitations in a creative manner, just as some creators have found their calling on youtube, snapchat, vine, instagram, twitter, blogs or any other media platform of the last decade. But they will build a very tiny niche, amongst all the other static noise that is of no interest to anyone.  Let the market regulate this itself."
caseyneistat,3dtuag,postposter,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:02:22 2015 UTC,"Authenticity's a shit buzzword. You still get what Casey's after though, right? No, you can't edit your clips before posting. As I've already said that's apparently a feature and one that some (including me, obviously) appreciate.   It's ok to say you just don't like it. It's a little weird when you trying to convince people that Casey's bamboozled us all."
caseyneistat,3dtuag,1100101000,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:50:57 2015 UTC,I don't aim to stop people from liking the app. That would be a fruitless effort on my part.  I'm standing my ground on the bamboozling. That pyramid was Bullshayt

caseyneistat,3dtuag,postposter,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:29:20 2015 UTC,"You are limited to 4 second clips, with no way to pause or review footage. Considering the extreme creativity of some vines with things like stop motion animation, I see absolutely no way beme can even get close to that."

caseyneistat,3dtuag,postposter,-3,Sun Jul 19 15:01:13 2015 UTC,I'm aware of the features; I have the app and enjoy it. I'm sure I'll be  heartbroken that I can't create a stop motion animation in the middle of the moma ps1 concert. Guess I'll have to enjoy the show instead.
caseyneistat,3dtuag,vicentedepierola,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:15:47 2015 UTC,"Considering vine allows you to record continuously and in a stop-motion style I have no idea how you're trying to twist it into a negative.

caseyneistat,3duo69,toranosaurio,31,Sun Jul 19 17:26:48 2015 UTC,I'm pretty such Jerome invested in BeMe.

caseyneistat,3duo69,Damn_Croissant,-1,Sun Jul 19 22:16:54 2015 UTC,Is it stated somewhere that it might be worth $10MM?
caseyneistat,3duo69,edmontom,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:58:46 2015 UTC,No. I was making a bad assumption. I shouldn't have gone into numbers because I also couldn't find how much equity he gave up.

caseyneistat,3duo69,PM_QUIL0N_SPAM,2,Sun Jul 19 19:28:20 2015 UTC,Jermoe - Definitely Shonduras - Perhaps Ben - No chance
caseyneistat,3duo69,branmuffinzed,3,Sun Jul 19 23:40:50 2015 UTC,Pretty sure Jerome invested. He would use it so that he could get more money for himself.
caseyneistat,3duo69,shy247er,3,Mon Jul 20 04:09:32 2015 UTC,"Probably 50/50. Jerome is definitely Casey's friend, but when he went to LA to meet all those viners..."
caseyneistat,3duo69,madwithin,3,Sun Jul 19 18:11:17 2015 UTC,Well we're asking ourselves where did a budget of 2 million go. A part of it surely went to viral marketing (by using popular users).
caseyneistat,3duo69,JayLin3455,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:16:49 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure there isn't anything in it for Ben other than having a cool name on the app and getting a head start.  But Jerome certainly has invested in the company.
caseyneistat,3duo69,oleo_strut,0,Sun Jul 19 20:39:00 2015 UTC,"All three of them don't need to be paid to be on Beme, instead Casey's promotion of them on Beme will help grow their own social-media following to a new demographic"
caseyneistat,3duo69,Dumbledozer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:17:41 2015 UTC,I would assume that Beme is a corporation so shares cant be equal.

caseyneistat,3duo69,nezia,-1,Tue Jul 21 10:00:55 2015 UTC,"I would bet that they each got equity, a small % of the company .  It may be that Beme is operating in a similar vein at the music streaming service Tidal, where the stars are all part owners."
caseyneistat,3duo69,Damn_Croissant,-3,Sun Jul 19 21:33:36 2015 UTC,"Most likely getting ""paid"" indirectly by gaining additional exposure to a broader audience."
caseyneistat,3duo69,shy247er,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:20:23 2015 UTC,I don't think that's how these things work. Those guys are valuable because they already have followings. They are bringing people TO beme. It's not a new concept (see Justin Bieber and Shots App).
caseyneistat,3dtyvx,PM_ME_YOUR_SWEG,13,Sun Jul 19 13:10:42 2015 UTC,Is it me or does he seem a bit subdued through this vlog? Intro music as well.
caseyneistat,3dtyvx,Chiefdrinkbeers,8,Sun Jul 19 13:41:35 2015 UTC,I felt that as well. Guess the criticism got to him a little.
caseyneistat,3dtyvx,EngineersIremember,3,Sun Jul 19 13:45:45 2015 UTC,Or lack of sleep.
caseyneistat,3dtyvx,postposter,3,Mon Jul 20 00:05:47 2015 UTC,Are people tweeting or messaging him criticism? Most of the discussion I've seen regarding the apps short comings has been on this subreddit which I'm not sure he reads.
caseyneistat,3dtyvx,Vaguely_Racist,17,Sun Jul 19 18:03:43 2015 UTC,"He still has failed to address the criticism the app is receiving, which is worrying to me. It says that either he doesn't care, of doesn't have a defense for what people are saying."
caseyneistat,3dtyvx,PixelBurnout,14,Sun Jul 19 13:40:58 2015 UTC,"He will never address all this criticism publically. He'll chalk what's happening on Reddit off to hate and since he's a positive guy, he'll ignore it. What he will do is take some of the most discussed points and say some people on twitter said ""XYZ"" and we'll do something about it, just like what he did for an android version.  We've got to understand one thing, he's a marketeer. To accept that the hype he generated the last 6 months was for an inferior product, or anything on those lines is a blow not only to his new company, but also his reputation as a marketing guy.  He will always address Beme as a revolutionary product.  Something did change today though, two days after the launch and even though it's Beme week, he mentioned the word just once in today's vlog and without the overlay text. That could sort of be an acknowledgement."
caseyneistat,3dtyvx,s18m,7,Sun Jul 19 15:00:42 2015 UTC,"I know everyone wants to see Casey address the criticism but seriously guys give him a break. We might not all be that happy with the app, I'm also skeptical about it but the truth is that he's been working very hard the last week, he's very tired and now just wants to spend time with the family. I'm sure that next week will be much more focused on everything beme."
caseyneistat,3dtyvx,Cmac0801,6,Sun Jul 19 21:20:03 2015 UTC,What happened to only listening to the criticism.
caseyneistat,3dtyvx,branmuffinzed,10,Sun Jul 19 17:51:40 2015 UTC,"Here's a good idea, let's go and promote all the bad things said about my brand new company I am trying to launch and get people talking about. He uses the vlog to promote Beme not critique it.   That would be a big shot to the foot this early on, let the full version be released. Hell, I don't even have a code so count yourself lucky if you do."
caseyneistat,3dtyvx,loddy71,6,Sun Jul 19 13:56:10 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, but I feel like if he really was confident in the marketability of his app he would be able to address the criticism and turn it around and further promote the app."
caseyneistat,3dtyvx,PixelBurnout,5,Sun Jul 19 14:05:27 2015 UTC,What happened to the extensive QnA??
caseyneistat,3dtyvx,EngineersIremember,0,Sun Jul 19 13:43:30 2015 UTC,Could be that it's a weekend so he's taking a break from promoting Beme?
caseyneistat,3dtyvx,Vaguely_Racist,2,Sun Jul 19 18:02:32 2015 UTC,This is probably the worst time to take a break from promoting.
caseyneistat,3dtyvx,shy247er,-2,Sun Jul 19 19:22:06 2015 UTC,Do you have a better idea?
caseyneistat,3dtyvx,Vaguely_Racist,2,Sun Jul 19 20:07:13 2015 UTC,"He started vlogs to promote beme, why would he take a break?"
caseyneistat,3dtyvx,HEY_ITS_ME_UR_BROTHE,2,Sun Jul 19 19:50:52 2015 UTC,His weekend vlogs are usually less work focussed.
caseyneistat,3dtyvx,Vaguely_Racist,2,Sun Jul 19 20:08:16 2015 UTC,The man must be exhausted. He'll be bouncing back fast next week with his usual energy. Gotta love him.
caseyneistat,3dtyvx,snapmike84,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:02:22 2015 UTC,Wow that brings back memories I haven't been to the mystic aquarium in a long time.
caseyneistat,3dtyvx,jumboslashlarge,-1,Sun Jul 19 23:36:06 2015 UTC,So next week!
caseyneistat,3du169,halfcastaussie,-3,Sun Jul 19 13:38:49 2015 UTC,Personally I like BeMe.   I like it because it is like a spark that ignites my creativity. Pretty much these past 2 days I've been a creative nut because of Beme. Sure it doesn't have the best UI but it's brand spanking new. Casey and Co. can make updates to the app and make it better. There are a whole list of things that started out not the best but became pretty amazing because they listed to their audience.
caseyneistat,3du169,landsharkxx,12,Sun Jul 19 15:18:11 2015 UTC,This ignites your creativity? I dont mean to be an asshole but how ? Don't get me wrong I am a Casey fan however this app seems poor for what I've seen. 4 seconds recorded sparked your creativity but the a ability to have a portable built in mobile camera with you at all times from the beginning never did? I don't see how that makes sense
caseyneistat,3du169,insane08,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:55:28 2015 UTC,"For me, I've gotten much more creative as well. I've enjoyed not seeing my posts, so I feel more free to just roll with it and make something clever/fun."
caseyneistat,3du169,BioTechnix,5,Sun Jul 19 21:48:14 2015 UTC,I found the fanboy
caseyneistat,3du169,BucetaMonster,8,Sun Jul 19 16:56:43 2015 UTC,I like how people downvote any posts or comments that say that they actually LIKE the app.
caseyneistat,3du169,ShowersUp,-1,Sun Jul 19 18:33:08 2015 UTC,Well I think they wouldn't get down-voted if their reasoning wasn't so obviously impartial.
caseyneistat,3du169,Rumsquall,7,Sun Jul 19 20:43:02 2015 UTC,Or maybe people just have their fucking opinion about the app.
caseyneistat,3du169,ShowersUp,0,Sun Jul 19 21:29:28 2015 UTC,"Just think it's ridiculous to have an inflated opinion about something because of its creator, I wanted the app/idea to be good because I was a fan of Caseys, the app is just way too unoriginal and bland from what he promised. Everyone can share their opinions but when people say that the app is good or will  ""probably get better"" (somehow) its just plain nonsense and leads me to one conclusion...they're a fanboy."
caseyneistat,3du169,Rumsquall,2,Sun Jul 19 22:35:41 2015 UTC,"""Just think it's ridiculous to have an inflated opinion about something because of its creator, I wanted the app/idea to be good because I was a fan of Caseys.""  Now that's just contradicting.  And because someone believes that the app could possibly get better, with necessary changes of course, makes them a fanboy? Okay."
caseyneistat,3du169,ShowersUp,0,Sun Jul 19 23:15:14 2015 UTC,"Key word is wanted. Again, I had a lot of respect for this guy, thought the app was going to be innovative, fun, and new (before knowing what is really was) did that affect my judgement of it? No. As soon as I got a grasp of what this app was at its core, I didnt care who made it...its at its core, something that can't be fixed, mind you, a dumb. idea."
caseyneistat,3du169,Rumsquall,2,Sun Jul 19 23:48:03 2015 UTC,"I agree with you completely. Not seeing my stuff has made me a lot more lenient in posting whatever, so I can be goofy/clever however, which is being creative for me.   Idk why you got downvoted, it's your opinion (which is a positive one)"
caseyneistat,3ds2t3,ImproveDave,9,Sat Jul 18 22:31:33 2015 UTC,For everyone hating on Casey/Beme just remember that oftentimes the first attempt is not the blockbuster hit.

But look even if it fails, he tried and who cares,  everyone makes mistakes... This is the Casey Neistat subreddit also, so if we can tone down all the BeMe posts just a small bit it would be great :)"
caseyneistat,3ds2t3,pokapokaoka,17,Sat Jul 18 22:34:10 2015 UTC,What I'm most interested in is if (or when) app fails will Casey continue to vlog.
caseyneistat,3ds2t3,chicaneuk,5,Sat Jul 18 23:25:36 2015 UTC,I think he said he might not be able to keep it up every single day.... but that he'd still continue to do it. It still amazes me that he manages to put out a video every day tbh.
caseyneistat,3ds2t3,RedSoxFreak_99,-3,Sun Jul 19 08:04:59 2015 UTC,I don't think he would ever give up vloging
caseyneistat,3ds2t3,0x808,16,Sun Jul 19 00:14:14 2015 UTC,"But the whole point of them is to advertise beme, what will be more interesting is if beme truly flops and he decides to start monetising the vlogs as their intrinsic value as an advertisement platform is dead."

caseyneistat,3ds2t3,0x808,2,Sun Jul 19 01:40:21 2015 UTC,Well he could just start monetizing his vlogs from a certain point onwards and be careful not to use any restricted material in them.

caseyneistat,3dv0tg,DJToaster,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:13:29 2015 UTC,What kind of stuff do you record?
caseyneistat,3dv0tg,thefoodsnob,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:54:23 2015 UTC,"It doesn't solve any problem, instead it creates it.   Lol, when's the last time 'social' really solved a problem, though? I mean, Facebook probably did... Twitter maaayybe. But after that it's all just iterations and remixes to do the same thing slightly different. The fact that Insta, Vine or Snapchat got big isn't because they solved a problem, but because users figured out a way to creatively use the restraints of the platform."
caseyneistat,3dv0tg,are-you-really-sure,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:56:48 2015 UTC,I agree both the banner and rule on side need to reflect this if that's the rule.

caseyneistat,3dw5dy,Gmansam,2,Mon Jul 20 01:01:36 2015 UTC,Are you saying they haven't hired an android developer at all yet?
caseyneistat,3dw5dy,runahair18,2,Mon Jul 20 02:37:12 2015 UTC,No that is not even close to what they are saying. They are still hiring other developers for Apple apps too. If you see on the website it says that they are looking for different positions. Also if you watched yesterday's vlog you would hear him say that they are making it soon.
caseyneistat,3dw5dy,NeroIsLife,2,Mon Jul 20 02:47:43 2015 UTC,Maybe they already have one but want more but this was under jobs on the Beme website.
caseyneistat,3dw5dy,snapmike84,2,Mon Jul 20 02:48:30 2015 UTC,This job ad has been up for a few weeks now.
caseyneistat,3dw5dy,JezusGhoti,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:49:45 2015 UTC,It's probably never coming to Android because it probably won't be a success on iOS.

caseyneistat,3du218,vicentedepierola,11,Sun Jul 19 13:49:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure, him fully dropping Snapchat would him basically be admitting that beme has the same functionality and user range as Snapchat."
caseyneistat,3du218,1100101000,3,Sun Jul 19 14:56:37 2015 UTC,"Although it is true that his Stories do not make as much sense since he started vlogging, so it wouldn''t be that big of a lost."

caseyneistat,3du218,qous,2,Sun Jul 19 16:16:56 2015 UTC,I think he will drop snapchat due to the fact that his stories are always 4 second intervals. Coincidence? I think not.
caseyneistat,3du218,waitingforpuberty,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:49:42 2015 UTC,I just hope he doesn't start using his Snaps to promote Beme.   THAT would be annoying
caseyneistat,3du218,_aaaa,-2,Sun Jul 19 14:20:47 2015 UTC,"So it is pretty clear that he wont snap anymore right?  There is nothing that is ""pretty clear"", there is nothing conflicting, just speculation on your behalf."
caseyneistat,3du218,EngineersIremember,3,Sun Jul 19 14:16:05 2015 UTC,I know. I'm just making assumptions to try to generate a discussion here.

caseyneistat,3drlq1,cholodolo,43,Sat Jul 18 19:57:27 2015 UTC,His Q and A was just one question....
caseyneistat,3drlq1,Banaszewski,8,Sat Jul 18 20:10:52 2015 UTC,"yeah that frustrated me especially since in yesterday's vlog he said that he would do an extensive Q&A about Beme, which I was excited about since there are A LOT of unanswered questions."
caseyneistat,3drlq1,coolmeto,15,Sat Jul 18 22:41:07 2015 UTC,Disappointing that he only answered the question about Android. I guess/hope that he'll address some of the Beme concerns in his next videos.
caseyneistat,3drlq1,ninwin,8,Sat Jul 18 20:13:28 2015 UTC,This was all filmed yesterday so I can see why he wouldn't respond to the criticisms.
caseyneistat,3drlq1,gundersons,0,Sat Jul 18 21:36:47 2015 UTC,"this was uploaded about 30 hours after beme was launched, he had plenty of time"
caseyneistat,3drlq1,Banaszewski,9,Sat Jul 18 22:01:59 2015 UTC,"He had plenty of time, but the footage in today's vlog was recorded before the launch of the app. He will most likely talk about the criticism in tomorrow's vid."
caseyneistat,3drlq1,epacseno,3,Sat Jul 18 22:30:50 2015 UTC,"From what I gather he filmed/edited this yesterday/this morning and then drove pretty much straight away to Conneticut. The formula for these vlogs is pretty much always ""watch yesterday today,"" if he answers the initial criticisms of Beme than it will be in tomorrow's vlog that he films today."
caseyneistat,3drlq1,gundersons,3,Sat Jul 18 22:26:05 2015 UTC,"Also hoping for you guys getting the Android app, but also hoping for us Windows Phoners.. if ever."
caseyneistat,3drlq1,HEY_ITS_ME_UR_BROTHE,16,Sat Jul 18 23:56:26 2015 UTC,I love that he had to adjust his Three Topics Sign because he saw himself holding it incorrectly on the display of his camera. With Beme you will never see the first line of any sign...like seriously never.
caseyneistat,3drlq1,fakint,4,Sat Jul 18 20:51:00 2015 UTC,So the bemes aren't limited to 4 seconds? That makes a big difference.
caseyneistat,3drlq1,Dallow,8,Sat Jul 18 20:17:13 2015 UTC,"I believe from what he described is that it works in the same way as snapchat, you can keep adding to your Beme. So each beme is 4 seconds but you can join them together to make a narrative."
caseyneistat,3drlq1,Divinepurity,18,Sat Jul 18 20:18:31 2015 UTC,..... come on. This is EXACTLY like snapchat stories. WTF happened to not copying?
caseyneistat,3drlq1,EngineersIremember,2,Sat Jul 18 20:28:58 2015 UTC,"It's really hard to come up with an innovative idea.  That being said, this is  far from his hyped up talk."

caseyneistat,3drlq1,branmuffinzed,11,Sat Jul 18 22:19:39 2015 UTC,"Sort of disappointed he didn't address much criticism. Also, ""very soon but not a year"" is pretty vague for an Android release date.."
caseyneistat,3drlq1,wamzlam,5,Sat Jul 18 20:54:37 2015 UTC,"Ya he missed the hype boat for android. Most people will read the articles on tech sites about beme, try to download it and when they can't they won't try again later."
caseyneistat,3drlq1,BroomSIR,3,Sat Jul 18 21:18:29 2015 UTC,If Beme becomes popular then launching later on Android shouldn't be a problem.
caseyneistat,3drlq1,thisdesignup,2,Sat Jul 18 22:07:40 2015 UTC,that's a big if though
caseyneistat,3drlq1,TacticalStache,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:28:52 2015 UTC,"True, but everything is a big ""if"" until it actually happens. Doesn't change whether the possibility exists or not."
caseyneistat,3drlq1,thisdesignup,2,Sun Jul 19 03:37:29 2015 UTC,"well I mean instagram took a long time to come to Android, look where it is now... But i still agree"
caseyneistat,3drlq1,zeisss,3,Sun Jul 19 05:37:36 2015 UTC,Only like .001% of all apps get success like Instagram or snapchat and it really makes no sense for Casey to limit Beme by limiting to a single platform when he had 18 months to port it.
caseyneistat,3drlq1,BroomSIR,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:50:41 2015 UTC,No yeah I totally agree I was just pointing out an anomaly! :)
caseyneistat,3drlq1,zeisss,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:02:10 2015 UTC,Yea man. Casey honestly should i just started a video production company instead of creating an app which he hass zero experience in.
caseyneistat,3drlq1,BroomSIR,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:09:31 2015 UTC,"Then again, small startups have a limited budget, and trying to develop an app for multiple platforms prior to release can often end up costing valuable resources that could have been invested elsewhere. As with most apps that are released on mobile, these guys don't want to spread themselves too thin, and I can guarantee you that if Beme is a success on iPhone, the Android version will follow.    It's a shame for us Android users that he opted for iOS as his primary platform, but I definitely understand the reasons behind that decision. Here's to hoping we don't have to wait too long!"
caseyneistat,3drlq1,pinbil,2,Sat Jul 18 22:18:46 2015 UTC,you can use an universal framework so the app works on iOS/Android/WP with almost no extra coding needed.  (also wp version anyone?)
caseyneistat,3drlq1,HEY_ITS_ME_UR_BROTHE,8,Sat Jul 18 23:52:01 2015 UTC,I was expecting much more from today's vlog. he didn't really address any of the many problems that surfaced during the first day of beme.
caseyneistat,3drlq1,sniape,2,Sat Jul 18 20:41:09 2015 UTC,i hope he will actually talk about them and not just put them under the desk.
caseyneistat,3drlq1,HEY_ITS_ME_UR_BROTHE,2,Sat Jul 18 23:52:37 2015 UTC,To be fair there is a delay between what he shows us and what we see. So the problems that arose last night would be answered today and shown tomorrow.
caseyneistat,3drlq1,AutoVista,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:13:57 2015 UTC,"yeah, fingers crossed."
caseyneistat,3drlq1,HEY_ITS_ME_UR_BROTHE,2,Sun Jul 19 12:03:12 2015 UTC,"Tomorrow's vlog should be interesting, he'll have a whole day of negative reviews to digest and hopefully addresses them in the vlog."
caseyneistat,3drlq1,Chiefdrinkbeers,4,Sat Jul 18 21:43:50 2015 UTC,"the comment I left ""Casey can you please address the fact that people are selling codes for disgustingly high amounts of money, or asking for nude photos in exchange for codes. I think it is ridiculous and an abuse of power in a way and I think you owe it to your audience to call out the people doing that."""
caseyneistat,3drlq1,weirdofrompluto,4,Sun Jul 19 00:17:56 2015 UTC,"I think two of the biggest things people were complaining about were addressed. There will be an android version, and beme's aren't just 4 seconds long, just 4 seconds per clip. So I'm going to assume if you just keep the proximity sensor encased it will just continue to record for an additional 4 seconds and so on, and people will be able to view them continuously on one press, similar to a snapchat story.  (If someone who has the app could confirm, that would be great)"
caseyneistat,3drlq1,Xwec,3,Sat Jul 18 20:26:12 2015 UTC,But there's always an annoying gap between clips since the app stops after 4 seconds and then starts recording again.
caseyneistat,3drlq1,thegroovologist,4,Sat Jul 18 20:31:22 2015 UTC,"Can confirm. The bleep noise starts, you have four second. The end. HOWEVER, any clips that you record close together, say, within ten minutes or so, get added on to that beme. So a beme can be like a full minute.   But you can't just cover the proximity sensor. You have to take the phone away from your chest, uncover the sensor, whatever, and start again."
caseyneistat,3drlq1,Jaredbt,2,Sat Jul 18 20:32:26 2015 UTC,"Crap. I was hoping that if you just kept it to your chest, it'll just start a new recording almost immediately after the initial 4 second clip was done. Hopefully this gets addressed in the near future."
caseyneistat,3drlq1,Xwec,2,Sat Jul 18 20:39:26 2015 UTC,The only problem with that is:   Open Beme Set phone down face-down Go do something else 30-minute-long Beme of the ceiling
caseyneistat,3drlq1,MBD123,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:03:31 2015 UTC,Didn't address also the many people who want a code to try out beme...
caseyneistat,3drlq1,A380101,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:14:19 2015 UTC,I'm going to lose a lot of respect for Casey if he shoves all this criticism under the carpet.
caseyneistat,3drlq1,_Sunday,-1,Sun Jul 19 08:47:58 2015 UTC,Is it just me or is it strange that on 'Beme day' he left the office early to go home?  Surely he would have been inundated with things to do on launch day...
caseyneistat,3drlq1,mrwiffington,12,Sat Jul 18 20:24:33 2015 UTC,What is he going to do? He doesn't have any programming skills. His job is primarily advertisement I think. So going home to edit the vlogs is probably the most important thing.
caseyneistat,3drlq1,EngineersIremember,-12,Sat Jul 18 20:30:45 2015 UTC,"Casey loves to TALK about how hard he works, he doesn't actually work hard. Of course he went home early, probably to pack for his weekend getaway."
caseyneistat,3drlq1,haloruno,11,Sat Jul 18 20:50:55 2015 UTC,"How would you know he doesn't work hard? We see 5-10 minutes of his day, that's hardly enough to make any judgements about his life."
caseyneistat,3drlq1,gundersons,9,Sat Jul 18 21:28:09 2015 UTC,"You guys are fucking circlejerking way too much about how Casey is fucking hitler for releasing the bad app.  It's one thing to talk bad about the app, now we are attacking his worth ethic?  I'm out of here. This subreddit went from being very pro-Casey (like most die-hard fans are) to a very anti-Casey viewing. This place has become cancer.  I have seen multiple people attacked for having good views of the app or just Casey. Fuck this place."

I wouldn't be so quick to judge features but we all get the concept of the app. Which I find to be revolutionary. It takes time to grow on you. I like it though.

caseyneistat,3dt30h,bloodbuzzz,3,Sun Jul 19 11:42:20 2015 UTC,"I agree with you! I was pretty underwhelmed when I saw the vlog explaining it and before I had a code, but since I've been actually using it (about 18 hours) I'm really enjoying it. The 'nearby stranger' thing is particularly cool, since I live in Australia and wasn't expecting as many people as there are to be near me. I've had it crash a couple of times on me and have had glitches with bemes coming up multiple times even after I've viewed them, but I'm definitely enjoying it as a whole.   Despite their similarities, it's definitely a different user experience to Snapchat. In a good way. I like seeing random things from strangers and not feeling pressure to respond in any way.   Bad things:  The video quality is not great and when walking/moving fast it's especially bad.  I am never, ever ready to see my face come up on the reaction screen. So many chins. All the time. I do like that it fades away if you don't react, though.  I wish there was a ""don't show me this stranger again"" option"
caseyneistat,3dt30h,postposter,3,Sun Jul 19 08:03:03 2015 UTC,"Protip on the reaction screen if you don't know already - it doesn't come up randomly, it pops up when you move your finger. No finger moving = no double chin scare."
caseyneistat,3dt30h,Goathead191,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:57:28 2015 UTC,Yeah I think I would like more privacy options and like dont show me this stranger again option but those type of things could be in the final version. People shouldn't be so quick to judge the beta. I think right now its more for testing the servers out and things like that.

Sooner or later every post will be one of the following - ""Casey sucks"", ""Beme sucks"", ""I need a code"" or ""I have codes"".  What's the point in having all these threads about the same thing.

As Casey himself said, to promote the company upon release and ensure an audience for the app. Now that the app is out, and it is evidently Casey's focus, it seems a little odd to avoid talking about it."
caseyneistat,3ds8d9,dannylafiesta,4,Sun Jul 19 03:22:48 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree with you there, but to say hes taken a break from film making is simply not true."
caseyneistat,3ds8d9,IsPepsiOk,2,Sun Jul 19 03:25:58 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't you say that his work with advertisers etc has stopped, and apart from those rare videos, the majority of his vlogs have been produced in addition to his time spent at the business. I'd say he has in fact taken a break from his usual filmmaking workload."

caseyneistat,3dr14u,DeerOnTheRocks,5,Sat Jul 18 17:05:21 2015 UTC,I like the smile idea a lot. Maybe rather than making it an automatic reaction they can have the reaction preview pop up to let YOU know that your enjoying a beme and give you incentive to send a reaction.
caseyneistat,3dr14u,Jaredbt,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:16:16 2015 UTC,I was thinking it could be nice to have it do it automatically. So you don't have to think about it. Makes it more organic. It could take the photo automatically and then prompt you opt in to sending it with a message?

caseyneistat,3dr14u,saturnhillinger,6,Sun Jul 19 04:02:10 2015 UTC,"As others have pointed out in other threads, beme's biggest problem isn't really its features, it's the whole premise of the app. Casey seems to think that the tools similar apps offer to allow editing and composition make online interactions inauthentic, but this is just faulty reasoning. He's especially proud of how much time he spends editing and composing his own vlog daily, but it isn't inauthentic. When people interact in person, they edit and curate their behavior in exactly the same way they do online. We choose what we wear, how we act, what we do and don't say. This doens't make us inauthentic people. Posting online is exactly the same way, we pick and choose what to post and how to compose those posts when we make them ourselves. This doesn't make our posts inauthenthic, rather it is evidence that good content matters to people who interact online. Casey has deliberately made an app that hinders the quality of the content its users can make. If he really wants to do something to encourage people to be more authentic, he needs to completely switch directions. He needs to come up with tools that make it easier to put more effort into their content, not less. Imo, beme needs to simply start over, do not pass go, do not collect 200$. The only feature worth anything at all is instant selfie replies."

And even if i did ask someone to put on glasses so that the world appeared differently, that wouldn't make whay they were looking at less authentic, it would be different colors. Less time spent on content is less effort spent on content. Want to call it a feature? Fine, it's a dumb feature."

For example, he never shows any of the negative events that occur throughout his day. The whole premise of the app makes me skeptical whether it would actually catch on, however the reasoning behind beme so that you can record, but you can't review. It keeps you grounded in the moment and lets your phone do all the work, that way people see things for what they are."
caseyneistat,3dr14u,DuelingRenzoPianos,6,Sun Jul 19 04:04:21 2015 UTC,"If there was a way you could make it required to take a Beme at certain moments during the day/night.  Beme is still curated because you can still choose when to take a Beme. Obviously you don't want to take a Beme during a boring walk—you want to take one during an exciting time like at a concert, etc. so you appear interesting and exciting. But if there was a way to make you take Beme's at periodic moments that were maybe unexpected, then I think the app would be more true to its initial intention.  There could be a way where two friends would commit to a Beme session...they would have to send a Beme every hour or so throughout the night. Something unexpected may happen (crazy hook up, night gets crazier than expected, night ends early, etc.). There would have to be no way of getting around sending a Beme."

If someone just shoots the floor, either something sketchy is going on they don't want to show (therefore making the viewer curious and therefore the purpose of the app succeeds). Maybe it can shoot out of both cameras at once and present both to the other Bemer (can an iPhone even record from both cameras simultaneously?) This would make it harder to hide things."

caseyneistat,3ds2s9,FacialLaFleur,17,Sat Jul 18 22:31:19 2015 UTC,Not to kill your whole review but Beme does not own the patent behind the software that is used to take a picture or video utilizing the proximity sensor. They have no patent in regards to any utilization of the proximity sensor.
caseyneistat,3ds2s9,WhoMcfree,3,Sat Jul 18 23:24:07 2015 UTC,Shouldn't this app be treated as prior art for proximity sensor started recordings: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/auto-proximity-detection/id909858532?mt=8
caseyneistat,3ds2s9,jekyll5,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:49:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah as others are said you can't patent using the proxi sensor in front of the phone. Also all that stuff belongs to Apple and their developer kit. They aren't going to let one company stop others from using features in their hardware.  After using Beme a bit I'm not totally sold. 4 seconds is very limiting. It always cuts people off when talking. If you watch Casey blogs when he's filming POV imagine if he cut every 4 seconds. It would be a bit of a mess. Francine would start smiling then bam 4 seconds over you missed the moment. It's a social network that actually feels very isolated because you can't comment, just get random reaction photos. How much can you do in a reaction photo? Just a goofy smile or thumbs up. Forcing a reaction photo is not really genuine interaction.  Proximity sensor is kind of cool the first time you do it but after that you can feel the limitations. Putting your finger over it feels like a hack and just making do.  Most importantly it's just not that fun, your filming something that you can't even review and you know if going to cut out after 4 seconds. You are just hoping for the best posting it and then just waiting for photos of Random faces. Seems like one of those brain fart ideas that are super cool to begin with and have novelty but there isn't really any longevity there."
caseyneistat,3ds2s9,kex_ari,3,Sun Jul 19 08:55:54 2015 UTC,I think it looks much cleaner and mature than snapchat.

caseyneistat,3dr39u,gundersons,2,Sat Jul 18 21:56:29 2015 UTC,"I think the reason people are commenting negatively towards casey himself is because he went on that whole rant about ""copy cats"" and ""wholsesale theft"" and then he releases an app that is 90% snapchat clone.

Even if I am, half of the stuff I see isn't anything to do with that. I've seen people saying for instance that he doesn't work hard, he just likes to pretend that he does.

This is what running the pr wing of a company is like, its your job to avoid alienating your userbase for impulsive, selfish reasons. When he made that rant he was clearly criticizing jack's gap for starting up a vlog, but it's not like he invented vlogging. I just get the impression he doesnt always think about consequences. Still like his youtube channel, though."
caseyneistat,3dr39u,saturnhillinger,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:39:55 2015 UTC,I don't think he was criticising jacksgap on the vlog aspect (although it was shot in a very similar style to Casey's.) jacksgap had previously copied a few different video ideas from him eg. The video Jack made about surprising his girlfriend was almost exactly the same as Casey's video about surprising Candice in South Africa.

caseyneistat,3drx5k,WhoMcfree,3,Sat Jul 18 21:39:58 2015 UTC,If Beme made it up to 10 seconds that'd be awesome. I also think it's dumb that if it's shorter than 4 seconds it just gets deleted.

caseyneistat,3drx5k,OnlineNoob,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:19:31 2015 UTC,This. Four seconds is slightly too short to talk into the camera. Also I don't like how less than four second videos get cancelled because I often find myself accidentally cancelling recordings

caseyneistat,3drx5k,thisbotsays,3,Sun Jul 19 00:20:03 2015 UTC,"I think they are very different platforms. Asking if Beme will kill Snapchat is like asking if Twitter killed Facebook. They have different uses. That being said, I think it is relevant to talk about if Beme will become as popular as SC or other social media platforms.  Snapchat has existed for a while and it's had a chance to experiment with different things. Most of the features that make Snapchat ""Snapchat"" have been added within the past year or two. Beme is only a day old so there is plenty of room to grow. So in that sense SC does have Beme beat.  However one shortcoming of Snapchat that Beme seems to fix is seeing strangers' content. Beme always shows three strangers' bemes and they can be of anything. Also, this means even if I have no followers and I post a beme, a handful of people will probably see it anyway. On SC, the only people who will see my stories are my followers or SC's curated public stories.  Really, we have to wait and see what Beme will bring to the table in terms of new features."
caseyneistat,3drx5k,Legomaster616,2,Sat Jul 18 21:57:49 2015 UTC,"How do they have different uses? They literally do the same thing: allow you to publish short, ephemeral videos to a group of people. The only difference is that beme is a stripped back snapchat. Anyone going to beme from snapchat will likely miss at least one of the features."
caseyneistat,3drx5k,0x808,3,Sat Jul 18 22:20:22 2015 UTC,"Well I've been using beme for about a day and I can tell you they have different uses. I use snapchat for some things and beme for others. Snapchat is better for things I want to share with my friends, beme is better for things I want to share with the world. If I started using beme exclusively instead of snapchat I would most definitely miss all of snapchat's creative features but that isn't how I use beme."
caseyneistat,3drx5k,Legomaster616,0,Sun Jul 19 00:16:16 2015 UTC,"Snapchat's overall superiority is also clear to me, but lets just not dismiss Beme completely.

I'm guilty myself of editing posts and restricting my thoughts on my Twitter, Facebook, etc to only show the highlights and things I deem interesting. That's the problem Casey's trying to solve with Beme.   He's not saying that editing and putting out great content is inauthentic, instead it's about the comparison between a heavily edited Instagram taken with a DSLR then transferred over to an iPhone and an in-the-moment pic of something you drove by taken on your iPhone."
caseyneistat,3dqp6f,daBEARS40,2,Sat Jul 18 22:17:24 2015 UTC,I couldn't agree more. How many snapchats do you see that are 4 seconds long?
caseyneistat,3dqp6f,dev726,3,Sat Jul 18 23:18:36 2015 UTC,"Can we contain these posts to the mega-thread or /r/bemeapp? Or just add ""Beme"" flair."

The beauty of Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat is that it allows you to take one or two good moments and share them, and you do it on your own terms, you get to hold the camera in a way that doesn't make your chin look fat, you get to crop out the weird dude you sit next to at work, you don't snapchat the 8 hours you spend at your desk just the 45 minutes your at crossfit and then you share it and your wider social group thinks your a cool person. I don't want to share everything completely unfiltered, I don't want to accidentally press my phone to my chest and fire off a shot of me with my balls out reflected in a mirror. I don't see how it improves anything thats not already here, Vine was acquired three years ago, Snapchat is working with huge companies like CNN, ESPN and the Daily Mail and this just seems late to the party and with not much more to offer. Apart from the patent, if they have one on the proximity sensor as a button then I don't see how it's worth anything."

caseyneistat,3ds16l,sattleda,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:01:32 2015 UTC,"Okay, here's my view. I think it does solve a problem, and a pretty big one at that. People, especially kids these days (oh god. I am my dad) stare into their phones recording and curating their lives, experiencing it through a screen (concerts, events, parties...). With beme, even in it's buggy bare bone state, all that staring at the screen goes away. Not saying all the other social networks or even snapchat are going to go away, but maybe we'll see a few less glowing screens over the heads of people at concerts."
caseyneistat,3ds16l,MorgansButtcrack,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:52:34 2015 UTC,"Here's my counter argument to that. Again, keep in mind I do not care that it is buggy as most first gen applications are like that. The reason Snapchat is so successful is because they solved a real problem: people want to share things privately and for a limited time only. Snapchat realized that not every photo is meant to go to your 900 Facebook friends, but instead a close few. That's a real problem being solved. It's something that people knew they wanted from the moment they heard it. Beme isn't solving a problem, it's making one up. Limiting light from smartphones at concerts isn't something that will cause 100 million users to join Beme. It's a niche for people that have extra time in their lives to use yet another social media app. Tell me, what's one reason a user would use this over a Snapchat story. Because they don't want to see what they're posting? No, because obviously 200 million+ people do. The next Snapchat won't be another Snapchat. Beme is another Snapchat. Even if people liked the niche of Beme, it's a simple fix for Snapchat. Convincing people to use this app on a regular basis is a pretty tough sell if you ask me. After the hype dies, this app will be used by very few people in no time. How he convinced VC's to give him money I have no idea.  Sorry if there are any typos, I'm typing this on my phone."
caseyneistat,3ds16l,MorgansButtcrack,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:33:15 2015 UTC,"What is the actual real problem that the next social network can solve and win a market share? I think the real problem is that there are too many networks ... could the next network/app be an all-in-one type solution? Or something that frees up our time, is quick to use and then we can just get on with enjoying the moment? Personally, we need a Nostalgia app where people can share memories created before social media ...that is a gap in the market."

Yea, see, we don't know any of that. You only see the launched product but have no idea what the road to it was. Casey doesn't put everything in his vlog, so maybe they've been talking to their talking audience along the way. The app has only been released for two days, there's no way they could've already responded to criticism from the market. And, no, investors are not gonna be hesitant to invest in the future for that reason. If he has another idea that sounds great and finds a good team they will throw money at him again.

I see this as more of a soft launch, you can even notice it when you look at the app version, I think it's 0.30 so that's definitely alpha or beta. I'm guessing this was really to see how they would do under a massive amount of users and some other technical stuff.

caseyneistat,3dpzpv,MrJHImself,3,Sat Jul 18 10:15:13 2015 UTC,Not sure what you mean by this. I didn't get it either - he releases and app and then tells everyone to wait for the better version next week? Why?
caseyneistat,3dpzpv,ShezaEU,-1,Sat Jul 18 10:21:29 2015 UTC,When you create an app to get published the process can take a long time. Months even. So casey in that time has his team making bug fixes and tweaking it for a better performance.   So the app won't be completely changed it will just run better.
caseyneistat,3dpzpv,MrJHImself,5,Sat Jul 18 10:32:24 2015 UTC,"I forgot about the app store review process actually, good point."
caseyneistat,3dpzpv,ShezaEU,0,Sat Jul 18 10:36:40 2015 UTC,"As a developer, this is so off. For iOS, the maximum review time you will get is 10-12 days, but normally 8. Plus, if an update is coming out next week why not just wait? I mean seriously - you don't put an app on the store and say ""hey! my app is on the store today but it sucks! Get it in 7 days!"""
caseyneistat,3drsza,Throwawayaayay342,11,Sat Jul 18 21:02:19 2015 UTC,"If you honestly believe any aspect of anything by now hasn't been done in some way shape or form, you are nuts. There will always be something remotely close. The way you've posted implies that he ripped off the concept from that app specifically. Give me a break."
caseyneistat,3drsza,Xwec,5,Sat Jul 18 21:27:54 2015 UTC,Welcome to tech startups. Just take a look at Facebook. Only thing why it beat competitors was real time communication. Just wait until Facebook gets beaten and the story continues.
caseyneistat,3drsza,visiblysane,3,Sat Jul 18 21:25:35 2015 UTC,"Even non-tech startups do this. The technology in the Iphone was nothing new, it already existed in one way or another. The thing that makes those products successful is how those technologies are put together. No one had combined all the technologies before the Iphone. Similar to Beme there has not been an app with video reactions and proximity recording."
caseyneistat,3drsza,thisdesignup,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:12:28 2015 UTC,Wait you're saying facebook beat its competitors because of real time communication? Like instant messaging?
caseyneistat,3drsza,RaiseThrice,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:24:05 2015 UTC,"Yes. That was the main feature everyone else really lacked. Even though 80% of Facebook is pretty much copy of all that came before with that 20% real time communication in a way being new. That is how it usually works not with just facebook whereas only 20-15% is something innovative while rest being the copy of the best parts. In a way it is like evolution, they learn and avoid previous mistakes.  If I wanted to destroy Facebook I'd copy the best parts from facebook and add something new that just destroys them."

caseyneistat,3dp932,Astrophsx,0,Sat Jul 18 05:00:50 2015 UTC,"He's talking about ""interactions"". Maybe he should move to LA if he thinks people are into 4 second interactions.

His ""work"" mainly involves getting the word out, which I think he's done a incredible job of. He can still be a founder and raise 2mm in capital as long as he has his team doing the real work."

Don't be surprised if his vlogs are just an illusion, in order to promote the app. I like his vlogs. But I think he is just putting a new spin on an old idea and marketing it with a clever team of talented people.  His vlogs are carefully constructed and thus are not authentic, something he is trying to capture in his new app #Irony"

caseyneistat,3drr2f,Ljohnson72,-1,Sat Jul 18 21:05:42 2015 UTC,See this post for the Conspiracy Theory: https://www.reddit.com/r/caseyneistat/comments/3dp932/this_was_deleted_here_yesterday_screenshot_inside/  Casey is not monetizing his vlog videos. Some speculated it was due to the music he was using... others speculated that it would help increase/maintain viewership to help promote the BemeApp. I don't believe he has to disclose he is getting paid unless he is giving a review of a product. I could be wrong... but it is a little odd that on the day after the release of the big app that he would feature random employees handing out free candy. Kind of like the super bowl... when is Casey's vlog going to have the highest number of viewers? ANSWER: During the first few days after the release of his app!
caseyneistat,3drr2f,Supah_hot_fire215,2,Sat Jul 18 20:48:41 2015 UTC,Sometimes companies do this to promote themselves. I know coca cola does it a lot often on conventions or just randomly on the street I've come across several coke stands handing out free coke.
caseyneistat,3drr2f,_kashmir_,-4,Sat Jul 18 21:09:37 2015 UTC,"Right, but why feature it on the vlog instead of using that time to answer 1 short question?"
caseyneistat,3drr2f,bored_lad,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:14:12 2015 UTC,"He's not on a time limit. He chose to answer as many questions as he wanted and if he wished to answer more then he would have done exactly that, the result being the vlog would have lasted 30 seconds longer."
caseyneistat,3drr2f,lowji,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:27:35 2015 UTC,I personally can't see what it has to do with the music when one of the guys he used most often actually reached out to Casey to ask Casey to use his music.
caseyneistat,3dqy2a,DemRobertski,3,Sat Jul 18 16:33:07 2015 UTC,they're probably just invalid codes. a lot of the twitter codes have been recycled -- i really wouldn't trust the ones that aren't sent to you by someone you know or can somewhat trust; a lot of the twitter accounts are just putting up recycled links to gain RTs or follows

caseyneistat,3dmu0p,JazziestofJeff,2,Sat Jul 18 07:19:47 2015 UTC,He wants you to use social media but he wants you to use it unconsciously which is a cool idea but isnt really practical. i would go as far to say impossible because you want to know what is being posted of you and you want to interact with friends or strangers on social media.
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,HomieZach,4,Sat Jul 18 15:55:26 2015 UTC,"Also if I wanted to share an experience, I would experience it, and then later share it on twitter or something. I wouldn't really be experiencing the moment in full by holding my phone on my chest for 20 seconds."

caseyneistat,3dmu0p,golfkingmatt,9,Fri Jul 17 15:52:06 2015 UTC,I said it before. hard to patent the use of apples API. Snapchat's team with help from apple would destroy casey's patent in a lunch break.
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,yoRedditalready,3,Fri Jul 17 17:16:20 2015 UTC,Snapchat could just overlook the patent and not give a single shit.

caseyneistat,3dmu0p,waitingforpuberty,22,Sat Jul 18 06:14:40 2015 UTC,"I wrote this over on YT (on his unlisted video but here is my take):  Are people really interested in 'reality' though? That's up for debate. I mean, in truth, if championing reality that isn't highly sculpted and calculated why do a video of Beme that is highly edited as well as graded? That's not 'reality' either. And when you think about it people here enjoy Casey's vlogs primarily due to the editing and careful curation of his life. Would people be flocking to his videos if they were only 4 seconds without thoughtful framing and/or editing?  The ephemerality trend and trend of believing that people are mainly interested in beaming 'reality' (shots of a floor, shots of the inside of their pockets, shots of someone's back) seems to be plateauing with this release.   Maybe I am wrong. That's possible.   But I am not particularly interested in badly framed 'reality'."
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,nythroughthelens,5,Fri Jul 17 17:17:02 2015 UTC,You're not wrong.  You perfectly demonstrated why the philosophy (albeit an honorable one) behind the app is flawed.

caseyneistat,3dmu0p,savantt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:33:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think those are the same though because you have to watch them live and then they are gone. They are essentially like a mobile-focused version of UStream and Justin.Tv. What's different is Beme lets you watch on-demand, but you can only watch once."
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,usafooty,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:07:37 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair, for periscope, you can watch a broadcast for a certain period of time after it's gone live, but annoying that you can't fast forward through it."
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,cholodolo,2,Fri Jul 17 19:39:39 2015 UTC,"Right, but that's just another way Periscope is different than Beme, since Beme is one-and-done. If the argument is that Beme is the same as Periscope, I really disagree. I didn't even get into the fact that one is four-seconds long, and one can just go on forever."
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,usafooty,10,Fri Jul 17 19:54:17 2015 UTC,How does he plan on making money?
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,sbwells,19,Fri Jul 17 20:00:22 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think 20% of that went to the rent for that goddamn RIDICULOUS office in Manhattan. Like, what the fuck!?"
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,Rumsquall,16,Fri Jul 17 18:53:06 2015 UTC,Casey's not great with money..
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,BroomSIR,13,Fri Jul 17 20:08:23 2015 UTC,It isn't like he needed the stuff he gets sent to his mail anyway considering the way he rudely unboxes his gifts and tosses them to the side the next second only to complain how much stuff he has to clean up after receiving gifts people took there time out of to send to him.
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,Atsushi2ja,5,Fri Jul 17 21:51:07 2015 UTC,"He literally says thank you after every opening. People know exactly how he's gonna open them when they send packages to him. His entire tone when he mentioned possibly stopping mail time, was ""hey I'm super grateful for this stuff but I've nowhere to put it."""
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,gundersons,9,Fri Jul 17 22:49:50 2015 UTC,So the thing is it's venture capital not a loan. It's an investment. He was given money because people believed in his idea the people in this business know they are taking risks.
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,steelkin,5,Fri Jul 17 23:35:53 2015 UTC,"Honestly, as soon as i found out it was an app i was already dissapointed."
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,saturnhillinger,4,Sat Jul 18 14:10:30 2015 UTC,"I get why he doesn't want people to review and edit their bemes, and I get the whole proximity sensor biz. It's actually quite smooth how the app works. But there is basically absolutely nothing I can record for 4 seconds and for it to make sense. Vines are edited and so can be carefully cut to increase context. Beme is instantaneous.   The app header says 'xyz people spent zyx seconds being you'. That's cool. But did they really spend that long 'being' me or did they spend that long looking at my shoes, or at the person in front of me being caught off guard by the filming, or did they spend 4 seconds trying to figure out what the damn video was about and how to make a reaction? (I can't get reactions to work half the time).  The lack of flexibility in recording time is one of the biggest faults of Beme. The other parts of the app are still a sketchy Snapchat-like mess but at least the grounding for them is cool. The grounding is pointless if I can only film for 4 seconds, though.   Heck in every beme from Casey I've seen, he is cut off mid sentence, even when it sounds like he has something important-ish to say."
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,ShezaEU,3,Fri Jul 17 21:39:34 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I respect Casey but this app is just plain bad. It adds nothing new to what is available and already popular and, more importantly, it goes against people's natural need to present themselves in the best possible way.   There is a market for disappearing pics and videos and snapchat does that very well. But it became popular only because teens wanted to share naked pics and had a little bit of foresight not to want them to stick around forever. So it solved a real problem for someone, a very important one at that. You got disappearing, perfect, edited, ""non-real"" nudes. Add a quasi-idealistic feature of not being able to look at yourself when you take a video and make it 5 seconds long and you are already trying to reeducate people on what they want. Ever try to change someone? Why is social media like that - superficial, vain, insecure - and, yes, I am quoting The Grand Budapest Hotel - it is because people are like that, sorry to break the news to you. They just had the option to express that on social media and they took it, in droves. I don't see people changing because they downloaded Casey's app. Plus, they already have the option to be less vain and share more ""honestly"" on social media even without beme. No?   Anyway, what I think is going to happen is after the initial hype is over this app will flop or there will be a greater fool who will buy it for a few million before it eventually flops. Although I liked the marketing with the secrecy, anticipation and artificial scarcity with the invite codes, I have to call bullshit on this app."
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,palankata,7,Sat Jul 18 03:32:58 2015 UTC,"My random thoughts.  I don't know when/if i'm done posting or continuing to add onto a single Beme.  I understand the film it, and it's broadcasted.  But my biggest issue is not being able to save/keep my own.  if I'm at a concert and record i may want to keep that video  and see it again, not just pass it to you"
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,IamJhil,6,Sat Jul 18 10:31:06 2015 UTC,"Then you aren't using Beme the way it was intended.  Beme is a sharing app, not a personal video recorder.  If you want to save your own videos, just record them yourself with your camera or stick with Snapchat.  (Not trying to be an ass, just stating the reasoning behind the apps creation, to share, not to save.)"
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,Nothing_Amazing,10,Sat Jul 18 13:40:12 2015 UTC,Then why would anyone use the app? Snapchat does everything beme does but better and people use it.
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,BroomSIR,2,Fri Jul 17 20:14:08 2015 UTC,"Because it's a different experience.  It's the whole selling point of Beme.  You can't watch your own video to critique it and figure out whether or not it deserves to be uploaded.  It also prevents the user from editing the video.  It's 100% real.  It's viewed once and done.  In real life you don't get to replay events that happen.  They happen and they are done.    On the apps Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook, they all have filters and ways to edit the media and distort reality.  Beme gets rid of that to keep authenticity.    Did you watch Casey's vlog?"
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,Nothing_Amazing,3,Fri Jul 17 20:56:31 2015 UTC,Yes of course I watch his vlogs. I just have no faith in his app.
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,BroomSIR,0,Fri Jul 17 22:50:46 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see.  Then the question you asked was just out of frustration?  Because it's quite reasonable to understand why a video saving feature isn't necessary for Beme."
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,Nothing_Amazing,3,Fri Jul 17 23:23:46 2015 UTC,Casey's vlog tomorrow is going to be really good. Hearing his response to the criticism is going to be juicy.
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,BroomSIR,0,Fri Jul 17 23:37:32 2015 UTC,"Haha!  I totally agree.  Hopefully he will either give reassuring words and have more plans to expand on or say ""oops guess my idea sucks."""
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,Nothing_Amazing,0,Fri Jul 17 23:56:08 2015 UTC,"For about an hour this after I was sort of internally freaking out because an idol I lookup to and respect was finally making a giant mistake in his life after such a long winning streak for himself. But, now I'm sure he'll take the constructive criticism and probably fix most of biggest issues with the app. Seeing how Casey responds is really going to reveal his true character."
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,BroomSIR,0,Sat Jul 18 00:05:37 2015 UTC,Definitely!  We hate to see our heroes do things that we feel are putting themselves in harms way.  I have faith in Casey as well.  I feel that he will pull through and address things.
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,Nothing_Amazing,3,Sat Jul 18 01:32:06 2015 UTC,Well snapchat can do what I want and share with people so I guess I will stay there then.
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,Lunatic14,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:53:43 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Beme is not the app for you.  You want to be able to control every aspect of your social media presence which is not what Beme is.  What Casey envisioned  is a bare bones, fully authentic way to share experiences with people.  A good example is concert sharing via social media.  People are no longer going to concerts to just listen to music.  They point their phone at the stage and keep taking photos and video of the perfect moment to be able to share it on their social media to make their lives seem interesting.  Instead of watching the show live and experiencing the concept, they stare at a little screen making sure they capture the perfect video.  I have been guilty of this in the past.  Thankfully I wised up a few years ago and actually attend the show fully instead of worrying about my phone and how many likes I'm going to get."
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,Nothing_Amazing,0,Sat Jul 18 08:48:05 2015 UTC,Wow thanks man you really have it all figured out. Also all of social media is going to be non authentic. You only are going to record when you want to show stuff anyways.
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,Lunatic14,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:08:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I didn't figure any of this stuff out.  It's been restated over and over again as a problem with social media.  Beme is trying to break the current model of social media by going about it in a different way.  Instead of focusing on how your photo or video looks you, you focus on allowing people to see what your are experiencing.    I don't understand how you can be un-authentic on Beme.  Unless you look in a mirror before your Beme selfie, there's still gonna be that booger in your nose for all your followers to see on your feed."
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,Nothing_Amazing,3,Sat Jul 18 01:39:53 2015 UTC,I dont get how reserving the username works? Its not connected to a number or an email or anything for me? Any thoughts?
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,PusH_Scotty,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:44:18 2015 UTC,"It's probably connected to your device. For example, if you delete the app then reinstall it, I'd imagine your username would be recycled back into the system. Not sure though."
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,Ohsneezeme,2,Sat Jul 18 08:54:36 2015 UTC,This doesn't work. Earlier on I deleted the app and upon reinstall I couldn't grab the same username. It was essentially lost.
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,nathanlentz,0,Fri Jul 17 17:09:01 2015 UTC,"I wonder if this is something the Beme team will change in the future. If not, they'll probably run into problems very quickly with usernames."
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,Ohsneezeme,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:13:38 2015 UTC,I'm thinking so. There are a few bugs. Probably just from situations that they haven't experienced. (Should have had a larger beta long ago and properly tested the app). I have no doubt things will tighten up in the next few weeks though. They have some talented devs over there.
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,nathanlentz,2,Fri Jul 17 19:17:29 2015 UTC,"With Apples APIs, it is not possible to get a static and unique device IDs anymore. You can't fetch the users Apple ID either."
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,MCKapur,2,Fri Jul 17 19:25:27 2015 UTC,"that sounds extremely stupid. they need to use an email/phone#, people change/reset phones all the time and that's not an excuse to recycle the username, especially people with prestigious, short usernames"
caseyneistat,3dmu0p,tothe69thpower,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:50:13 2015 UTC,"That was just a guess, I have no clue how it actually works. It could also be paired with your Apple ID when downloading the app. It's a little hard to tell at this point."

The invite system is not new, alot of tech companies has done it look at dribbble as an example. He suggested to wait a week probably for 2 reasons  1. He doesn't want to give the servers to much traffic otherwise they crash 2. He said he is giving his loyal viewers a code it's just to say thank you.  On your second point he i can some what agree but the point of the whole app is not be a fake person it's all raw footage no editing like with vine and snapchat  They can patent it look what snapchat did with there record/picture button that big round thing, you will only see it in snapchat for example. Btw you can hold your finger against the proximty censor and it will do the same  The UI isn't great but it's not terrible i think the UX could be better and then with a few Ui changes it will be good keep in mind it's a simple app not much to design here  Your fifth point is just like your fourth point more personal taste it's even sad that you think social media is there to be a fake version of your self but hey you use your apps the way you like it  Something i totally agree on is that the beta was rushed they should have stress tested the servers little bit more and did aleast 2 to 3 months of solid beta testing  To 2 million is easly explaineble  1. The servers were all the beme's get posted on cost allot of money. 2. Casey and matt have a high salary they are both big people who atchieved alot. 3. The average ios engerineer get paid alot around 50k a year  4. Plus the office in newyork and all the equipment  5.

It was just a few years ago he stepped up from using iMovie to Final Cut. His work is getting by on knowing the least amount needed to complete his work which gives his videos a ""rustic"" charm. I think he was just an idea man who got help to acquire the funds. He could brainstorm his ideas and his team could try to build things that meet his vision and test them out. This is more than likely why it took 18 months to develop because Casey had very little technical background on how apps are developed. I can almost guarantee he did not come up with the proximity sensor idea."

caseyneistat,3dqnrh,wizardomg,6,Sat Jul 18 14:52:20 2015 UTC,Who tf cares?
caseyneistat,3dp5bo,WhoMcfree,4,Sat Jul 18 02:47:51 2015 UTC,I agree with your assessment entirely. Beme is a watered down Snapchat and that's it. There's nothing better about it than Snapchat
caseyneistat,3dp5bo,branmuffinzed,2,Sat Jul 18 03:04:18 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty disappointed with how unoriginal the platform was.  After almost 2 years in dev I was hoping for something...better.  I love the dude but I can't stand how he's trying to spin the proximity sensor camera feature as the only authentic way to share on social media.  Tbh it's just a gimmick, but he's counting on that feature + feedback on content in the form of selfies to differentiate his product.  Instagram and snap chat are way more straightforward and flexible."
caseyneistat,3dq521,ex-driver,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:35:58 2015 UTC,You can't delete a clip unfortunately. Casey hasn't talked about the subject of privacy yet. Nobody even knows how long it takes until a Beme gets deleted from the servers or if it gets deleted at all.
caseyneistat,3dq521,thegroovologist,7,Sat Jul 18 10:55:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's pretty messed up...."
caseyneistat,3dq521,NicholasSvH,-1,Sat Jul 18 11:41:06 2015 UTC,Not right! He mentioned in his last vlog that they will never be saved.

caseyneistat,3dqk0o,turtleattacks,2,Sat Jul 18 14:11:43 2015 UTC,It pieces it together automatically. Say you make one clip now and another one 3 mins later. Your followers will see that as 1 clip of the two put together. But if you make another clip say 5 hours later. It will show up as a different clip on your follower's feed
caseyneistat,3dqk0o,oleo_strut,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:19:52 2015 UTC,It should send you a copy of your video a few minutes after being posted and you can't edit it over cause that's points of the app. Idk how you piece it together.

caseyneistat,3dntmy,thegroovologist,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:12:47 2015 UTC,"What I don't get is that he says that about not wanting to create, yet he is very active on snapchat, doing just that. Sure, his app is a bit faster since it's pretty much hands free, but snapchat isn't exactly difficult and requires no more than pressing the shutter and sending it."
caseyneistat,3dntmy,Cant-Find-Username,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:23:56 2015 UTC,Faster in what way? Bemes take forever to load and going to record on Snapchat takes a fraction of time more.
caseyneistat,3dntmy,branmuffinzed,43,Fri Jul 17 22:37:16 2015 UTC,"lol what?  He praised the virtues of creating a tool that allowed others to create in one of his vlogs last week. He apparently developed that chart with a fellow of the MIT Media Lab. Then, he releases the app and presents is a way to share without the burden of 'creation'.  This, coming from a creator, makes absolutely no sense.   And yeah, Don't review your own app. Don't do that. Seriously, don't."
caseyneistat,3dntmy,ikeasurvivor,8,Fri Jul 17 20:47:31 2015 UTC,"What's the issue with reviewing your own app? I'm genuinely confused.

But I think you have to ask whether there's a big enough market of people who want to share their lives unfiltered, and a market for people who want to see others lives unfiltered through 4 second videos.  Personally, no interest. Everything I share is heavily curated/edited. Not because I'm hiding anything, but because I want to put my best work out there. I think the idea of wanting to throw everything out there and see what sticks appeals to a certain audience, but as you can see from his beme meetup videos, it's definitely a younger and not very diverse crowd. It's all people who are huge extroverts and social media hounds.  I hope it goes well because we all know how much work Casey puts into this. Hopefully it will be a huge viral hit within certain audiences. But I don't think it will as mainstream as something like twitter or instagram. Then you have the whole issue where it's not really different from other options out there. I don't know, I guess we'll see what happens."
caseyneistat,3dntmy,juaquin,7,Sat Jul 18 00:42:54 2015 UTC,"It's official, Beme aka The social network for lazy people or people who just want to share useless stuff. Sorry for being harsh but... It's really awkward that Casey Neistat (a self-titled creative) doesn't want to create or make people do something creative or productive. The app basically is ""share something badly filmed and probably not interesting at all just for the fun of making other people watching garbage and react to that"". That's what I got from Casey's review and all the informations I got all this week. Once again sorry for being harsh, I like Casey's video and I like him as a creative and filmmaker, this app doesn't make sense with Casey's moto."

Snapchat and Facebook didn't start out with 2 million dollars in funding and an entire team to build them. If you were disappointed with Snapchat at launch or if you went to Harvard when Facebook was revealed it's safe to say that's because they were built by a few people with limited funds.  Beme had a huge team, tons of time, and tons of money. There really isn't any reason why it should suck..."
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,elijahharry,15,Fri Jul 17 16:47:13 2015 UTC,You're right this time
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,ikeasurvivor,3,Fri Jul 17 19:17:10 2015 UTC,"The key difference is time. Snapchat, facebook etc. were not as feature rich as they are now. And you are comparing those jugguraunts to beme.  Give it time. Who knows, it might never catch on, but to be dismissive right out of the gate seems short sighted to me."
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,Jsunu,2,Fri Jul 17 22:56:14 2015 UTC,I know as a fact facebook launched with less development time than Beme and really only had one main developer... it was probably also more feature rich than Beme at the time of it's launch.
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,elijahharry,2,Fri Jul 17 23:05:05 2015 UTC,And didn't Snapchat offered something more than BeMe right at launch? Hell they even had a notification feature when people takes screenshots.

caseyneistat,3dn1vr,banksied,4,Sat Jul 18 02:09:31 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty big deal for a start-up that's still in the prerevenue idea phase.  Look at TechCrunch, I know it's not VC money but tech startups hustle their asses off to win 1st place and get the measly $50,000 prize."
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,elijahharry,2,Sat Jul 18 02:16:51 2015 UTC,"Except that the original idea, the very concept is fundamentally flawed. That's the reason why it sucks, and no VC will save you from a bad idea."

When you're the person/team making the app, you know exactly how and why the app works. Even with 2-3 rounds of 20 beta testers, not all the bugs and use cases will be revealed and/or fixed. In his vlog Casey said that he doesn't even recommend downloading it yet because they're submitting an update next week that will make the app better. I'm not saying Beme is the greatest app of all time (it definitely has it's flaws), but it certainly has potential."
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,barkett,-2,Sat Jul 18 03:34:40 2015 UTC,You obviously have no idea about app development and the infrastructure  that is needed behind the scenes. 2.5 million isn't a lot of money in terms of what they are trying to pull off. Maybe 12-18 months of runway before they need another round of funding. They only closed that round like seven months ago. But getting the product out there and building a base of users who get what this is supposed to be will ultimately help them get the next round of funding.   The key thing this app has over snapchat is that it is way more social. The layer to find/browse people to follow will ultimately be where this app succeeds. Pretty sure next weeks iteration will showcase all top snapchat/vloggers. In time they will also expose new people who would never of gained traction in snapchat because there was no mechanism to discover them.   It's easy to talk shit when you feel like you didn't get what you wanted for your birthday. Truth is nothing could ever live up to the buildup. Take a step back and except it for what it is right now and maybe put some forethought into what it can become before you dismiss it.
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,waxwing666,6,Sat Jul 18 01:55:28 2015 UTC,"You're making yourself look like a fool. You could buy a snapchat clone template for $129 (probably less otherplaces) that is much more powerful than Beme is right now. Switch up the UI and add Bemes ""amazing"" features and you'll have two million dollars left for management, adequate server space, and maybe even some marketing.  There is no reason Beme should have taken as long as it did and cost as much as it did. I have numerous friends who have developed apps and they all are surprised by this as well.  Proof of cloned template: http://www.chupamobile.com/ios-full-applications/sneakpeek-snapchat-template-for-ios-with-server-4240"
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,elijahharry,-3,Sat Jul 18 02:07:17 2015 UTC,"Stop embarrassing yourself kid. You read the comments on this clone before you use this as your proof. Shit won't even scale. It would of crashed by the weight of just today's growth of beme. Just another garbage clone that suckers buy and try to dress up with lipstick.   As for the time to develop. It really didn't take that long and I bet there is at least half that money still left in the bank. They spent a year trying to raise capital, perfecting the business plan and architecting the app. Then probably six months truly developing this app.  Any of your so called developers build tumblr, snapchat ,Facebook  or  anything a even a tenth of the size? On the surface it seems simple and that's by design. But under the hood there is a lot going on."
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,waxwing666,30,Sat Jul 18 03:05:12 2015 UTC,"What I find a bit of a let down (and I was never too invested in the app anyway, I much prefer Caseys movies) is that it was billed as this original brand new thing etc... and what it is is basically Snapchat with a twist... kind of thought it'd be more."
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,childishmc,3,Fri Jul 17 17:04:36 2015 UTC,This. I got really hyped when he mentioned it was something allowed users to create! It hardly does that. I can be way more creative with the longer record time on snapchat and not to mention the awkward way I have to hold my phone to create stories for beme.
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,mratomdude,19,Fri Jul 17 20:47:46 2015 UTC,"The biggest flaw of the app is that it doesn't live up to the promise of being a ""tool that empowers everyone to create [content]"". (I added the word content...more on that down below.)  It only empowers those that lock themselves into the rigid, artificial and arbitrarily set limitations of the app:   You can only share amongst other beme users You won't be able to share your bemes externally, like on facebook/twitter etc. as you could with vines for example You will have to convince others (your mum/dad etc., really? – unlikely) to join you on the platform   Because of this alone it falls short on reach and will never see the widespread adoption (""everyone"") that casey is dreaming of.  Yes, it does break down entry level barriers that scare off others (""editing suites are complicated"", ""I can't cut videos"", ""where do I upload etc."")...which existing tools (smartphones, messengers, fb, twitter...) already managed to break down...but unlike those beme builds up so many arbitrary new barriers that will most like scare off the majority of people even more:   can't review what's shared (non-tech savvy people being scared to share something they didn't intent to share) unintuitive design as an additional obstacle if the average joe can't create interesting content with existing tools, why bother dealing with new platforms with new limitations (duration, camera angle etc.)? Why pick up this challenge instead of another one? it has not less friction than snapchat. Snapchat is as low as friction can get. Hit the app icon and hit record, done. Beme has higher friction. You still have to start the app and then perform an unnatural gesture.  ""For a selfie, just place your phone on a wall"" – yeah right. The only thing that will happen is people in front of any kind of scenery trying to hit the proximity sensor on the screen-side of their phone with their fingers, which is now turned away from them, all while trying to get somehow into the frame of their phone's camera, without any ability to check if they actually are. No one will place it on a wall. – Congrats Casey, you actually made the selfie even harder! (As you've stated before, you yourself actually only use cameras with a tiltable screen for your selfie-style shot vlogs.)   In addition to all this, the main question is what is actually 'created' (a term that Casey always puts a lot of emphasis on) by the users? – In my humble opinion: nothing. noise. that is not content.  In a world that is drowning in shitty content, let it be images, text messages, group messages, articles, summaries of those articles, books, blog posts about books, movies, their trailers, all kinds of music, remixes of music, regular linear tv on hundreds of channels and an endless supply of series to watch, even education to get from various providers, or youtube comment sections to get lost in, endless meme-dumps to browse or reddit threads to never be found in some niche subreddit, why do we need a tool that does nothing else than create a never ending supply of meaningless shitty not well thought out noise?  If this world needs something it is ""less"". More tailored curation in this messy world to reduce and not create more noise.  Heck even Casey himself is thinking about leaving New York, because the surrounding of the constant noise is stressing him out. Why build a tool that does nothing more than create even more of that..."
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,nezia,11,Fri Jul 17 22:43:56 2015 UTC,I'm really excited to see how Casey responds to all his fans turning their back on him and how he addresses it. Casey needs a reality check.
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,BroomSIR,2,Fri Jul 17 23:03:28 2015 UTC,I agree. That's an honest review.
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,thegroovologist,14,Sat Jul 18 07:59:36 2015 UTC,"My stock answer for the hate (which may be valid) is: Casey is first and foremost an ad man... look at the amount of hype he created for the app; millions eager to know what it was, and each with a personal affinity to it's creator and his cute family (and hence hoping it's a success). Who knows if beme will take off, but in terms of the ad campaign/pr, I'd say in years to come it will be seen as ground-breaking."
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,Alex_Olympic,6,Fri Jul 17 18:57:22 2015 UTC,That I completely agree with. What a marketing stunt!
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,waitingforpuberty,27,Sat Jul 18 00:08:11 2015 UTC,"You have to realize we're on a forum dedicated to the creator of the app. His 'fanbase' in many ways - lives here. The fact that the backlash on this subreddit has been so strong is an extremely bad sign.   If he can't even get his 'fans' on board, despite the fact that he signed up all the big names in Social, points to how bad of a product Beme really is.   I was so excited for Beme to come out. I was looking for clues and hints obsessively for the past few weeks. Based on his creativity pyramid I expected a tool that would have turned the everyman into a creator. Like Instagram turned everyone into a 'photographer' (I know...).   Beme is just bullshit. I give it 24 Months to the graveyard."
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,ikeasurvivor,4,Fri Jul 17 19:16:47 2015 UTC,I give it 3 months before casey realizes he's out of funds and recreates his app.

Is it just targetted at lazy people.  Even that doesnt make any sense, I am striggling to play devils advocate which is a bad sign, yeah the app has some good idead but another app could implement them as they seem like frwtures not its own app"
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,Eruntien,17,Sat Jul 18 14:15:45 2015 UTC,"Of course it is not the worst app anyone has ever used. The problem here lies in expectations. Everyone was expecting the new Snapchat, the new Instagram of tomorrow. They saw some sort of genius in Casey that could somehow invent such a thing. The app has let down people and frustration sits in now knowing what Beme really is. Overall I like the broad idea Casey was going for. Essentially he wanted a social media platform that kind of hides itself from view to where your not looking at your phone all the time. All he really wanted to do was fix the issue of people locked to our phones.   EDIT: Side note, how is meerkat and periscope doing? Are they succeeding? Because those apps I thought were very innovative, and to be honest, I don't see a lot of people using them. I'm just putting into perspective what Beme could be...like does anyone see potential?"
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,DeerOnTheRocks,5,Fri Jul 17 16:36:19 2015 UTC,I think you hit the nail on the head with expectations.  People's expectations were too high because it had been hyped for so long.  Not saying it is amazing or anything but I think a lot of the disappointment in this sub has to do with having unrealistically high hopes.
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,mikemch16,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:47:21 2015 UTC,"Meerkat has all but died out, but Periscope is decently popular depending on who you follow on Twitter. The people on it broadcast quite a bit, but there aren't too many."

caseyneistat,3dn1vr,MichaelRahmani,-5,Sat Jul 18 01:11:19 2015 UTC,"I think he should have let his fan base known more about what was happening with the app, the idea behind it and let them see the app before anyone else. He always meantioned ""I will let you know more about the after (insert problem)"". He should have done it.  However, I think the hate because how frustrated people are or let down is over the top. If you don't like something, speak it out. But the amount of hate, and sharp criticism is WAY over the top. People are acting like children.  The app has potential, and people need to understand this will take time to perfect. Like I said, I don't think Casey or his staff thought it was going to be the next best thing, he just wanted to put out this cool new idea. We cannot go for the throat on something that is not even fucking day old post-release."
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,masteryoshi,8,Fri Jul 17 16:45:15 2015 UTC,This app is literally making me use snapchat more....
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,papichino,12,Fri Jul 17 21:02:14 2015 UTC,"Anytime someone with such a huge following such as Casey releases their own product to the public, there is always going to be a huge amount of backlash. It is the typical crabs in the pot scenario where the haters are going to hate, and the fan boys are going to applaud.  My only real complaint with the app (and maybe because I am an old guy) is that I don't really see this app as solving any sort of user problem or void in the market. I have never once watched any piece of social media content and said to myself, ""I really wish this was more authentic."" Honestly I prefer to watch a well crafted and edited video with a story rather than watch some candid mess of a moment but that is just me.   Yes it is not the most original concept but it has real potential as a new social medium, especially with the amount of youtube and social media personalities Casey has partnered with."
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,sfall,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:23:46 2015 UTC,"The part of what he wants to build off is the basic share that was part of snap chats roots. Teens dominate their time on Snapchat right now. They use it daily, that's what I think he is capitalizing on"
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,saturnhillinger,3,Fri Jul 17 22:44:33 2015 UTC,"The whole ""you can't edit or control how things look"" idea is totally a gimmick being billed as a five star feature. I don't want to share random shitty videos that may or may not even frame what I want to show people. He loves to remind people that the key to good content is hard work and how he spends hours and hours every day editing and composing his vlog, and then he makes a ""tool"" which purposely prevents users from putting any work at all into content? It just feels like the exact opposite of everything he's always preaching about."
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,ohsnapitsjuzdin,2,Sat Jul 18 04:12:07 2015 UTC,"He did mention how filmmakers would hate it, but is targetted for everyone else to just simply create. so i don't think he's stepping out of line in what he preached."
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,branmuffinzed,8,Mon Jul 20 03:01:14 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to say, but Ello had a better launch. Casey and his team of 10-15 people had 1.5 years and $2mil to make a good app, but they didn't. There's basically nothing right with the app right now. We all had higher hopes because your lord and saviour Casey Neistat hyped it up so much and made it seem like it was going to revolutionize social media. What we got was a watered-down snapchat with a stupid gimmick."
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,branmuffinzed,-12,Fri Jul 17 16:43:11 2015 UTC,This is the stupid hate I am seeing.   If you don't like the app SAY what you do not like. There is no reason to say things like    because your lord and savior Casey Neistat hyped it up so much and...   Let's stay away from being so salty about an app dude.
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,BroomSIR,8,Fri Jul 17 16:51:15 2015 UTC,"There is. It's because Casey's fanbase is one of the worst on YouTube. They blindly follow Casey, no matter what he does or how stupid it is. The reason I'm subbed to this reddit is because I was hoping for more nuanced discussion about Casey, not blind fanboyism"
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,branmuffinzed,3,Fri Jul 17 17:37:54 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. All his fans treat him like a god and even go to his ""church"" aka his office and wait to to see him."
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,branmuffinzed,-7,Fri Jul 17 23:01:26 2015 UTC,"Stop being an asshole.  Just because I don't agree with you doesn't mean I'm a fanboy, just like it doesn't make you a hater. Chill the fuck out."
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,elijahharry,-2,Fri Jul 17 18:10:52 2015 UTC,"I didn't call you a fanboy, I was talking about the majority of Casey's fans. As for me being a hater, you did call me that."
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,ikeasurvivor,-3,Fri Jul 17 18:14:18 2015 UTC,"That whole comment was directed towards me. You did not directly call me a fanboy, but you blaently called all Neistat fans ""blind fanboys"", which you are chalking up to be me.  No I didn't call you a hater. I said you were spouting stupid hate. You were being ridiculous and compared me to thinking Casey was Jesus Christ.  I get you disagree with me, but there is no reason to be so mean man."
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,ikeasurvivor,6,Fri Jul 17 18:27:23 2015 UTC,"No, I said the majority, which is true. Go to the comments on any one of his blogs and almost all of the comments are from the same group of people who find the one thing they can praise Casey about that day. The reason I came to see reddit's reaction is because here there's more interesting conversation that shows the flaws and positives of Casey's videos."
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,boondom,3,Fri Jul 17 18:31:42 2015 UTC,"Dude what is your issue, I never said anything demeaning to you... I was harshly criticizing Mr. Neistat and yes I admit it was a little over-the-top harsh but I never directed anything horrible at you"
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,Chiefdrinkbeers,-6,Fri Jul 17 17:05:21 2015 UTC,don't talk to me
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,_aaaa,2,Fri Jul 17 17:25:37 2015 UTC,"For the time, money, and talent used towards this app - the final product should have been much much much better.   Beme sucks. Thats the harsh truth. IT.JUST.SUCKS.  It was made by 'old' people who just don't know how to build an app that kids will use. You need kids if you're launching a social media platform. YOU NEED KIDS."

caseyneistat,3dn1vr,dakry,20,Fri Jul 17 23:12:07 2015 UTC,flappy bird. That shit was gold from the moment it hit the app store.

caseyneistat,3dn1vr,runchewrun,9,Fri Jul 17 19:00:09 2015 UTC,"Whilst not perfect, Periscope's launch was very successful, with an innovative app and a much more polished launch version than Beme."
caseyneistat,3dn1vr,Eruntien,4,Fri Jul 17 19:57:08 2015 UTC,"It doesn't have to be perfect at launch, but it does have to have a solid basis. Proximity detection for recording short videos is not a killer feature in which to build anything upon.   I have been using instagram from nearly the very beginning. Its killer feature was that it made shitty phone pictures (at the time) more visually appealing. What does this accomplish? It makes it easier to take short videos, faster. ok...?"
caseyneistat,3dpysx,sniape,2,Sat Jul 18 08:47:10 2015 UTC,I give codes to my friends... you are all my friends :D
caseyneistat,3dpysx,landsharkxx,2,Sat Jul 18 12:22:32 2015 UTC,I think the point of the codes is you have to actually put effort in to be able to use the app. If you're really interested then you'll go out and try to get a code (like I did). He mentioned that he wants people to actually use the app instead of just having it and not doing anything with it.

caseyneistat,3dpysx,NoahRhino,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:32:40 2015 UTC,"He can't control the ""black market"" so should he care? There is nothing he can do except to open the app up fully to the public which I don't see happening until a later point."
caseyneistat,3dpysx,thisdesignup,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:00:42 2015 UTC,"They should've just let X amount of people in at a time. Every hour 1,000 people get a notification that allows them to unlock the app that hour. If they don't unlock in time, they don't get in and they're cycled to the end of list. That way no codes are involved and it's a first come first serve because it cycles through by the first people who claimed a username."

Ask for a code.  If you get one, edit your comment and with as many codes as you can give. This way codes go to whoever is currently browsing. This way we also know you no longer need a code.  Once the codes are claimed (you can see this in your app), edit your comment again and cross the codes out like this so people know they're taken."

Sorry guys. http://imgur.com/zbWBsdj

caseyneistat,3draoq,BYDO1612,-1,Sat Jul 18 21:20:04 2015 UTC,"somehow it would be a relief if he would never vlog again, and then admit that whole thing has in fact been a PR-campaign and that he is retiring now, his pockets full of cash"
caseyneistat,3draoq,garagelift,2,Sat Jul 18 19:12:51 2015 UTC,"What do you even mean? He has already stated that the vlogs are being used as a platform to promote beme. Also, he doesn't monetize the vlogs. Also, beme hasn't made any money at all. They spent all of the beme money making a mediocre snapchat clone."
caseyneistat,3draoq,BYDO1612,2,Sat Jul 18 19:34:26 2015 UTC,"yeah, but on a much more personal level. in the vlogs beme is portrayed as ""his baby"" and I hope that he just had an initial idea for the app, and that he has not been more than the guy responsible for advertising it trough his blog. I hope that Casey just had a much bigger vision that simply could not be realized....so that this mediocre app is mediocre because of other people. because the way of promoting it (through his vlog) was great, and ""great"" is something we all expect of him"
caseyneistat,3draoq,BroomSIR,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:41:38 2015 UTC,He's been honest about his intention for the vlog since April. He has produced good daily content while running his own business and raising a baby. All for free. He doesn't even have ads in his videos.
caseyneistat,3doadu,usafooty,6,Fri Jul 17 22:10:17 2015 UTC,"IMO, it wasn't suppose to come out until next week, but there was so many people that have been posting details these past few days and a lot of that being somewhat negative he wanted to release the app and have it official before more bad press happened."
caseyneistat,3doadu,bankdank,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:13:31 2015 UTC,"But it's not like there was a groundswell of negative info in the mainstream. I think I saw one post here in this subreddit, which doesn't have that many subscribers or users. Most people didn't care about this app or know anything about it.  He also could've conducted the test groups without mentioning it in the vlog, and having other people conduct it, so no one would've known it was ""the Casey Neistat app"" and there would've been no reason for the testers to leak the info. He handled it in a way that was the opposite of being conducive to its details remaining secret, which was another big mistake. That should be 1b on my list... editing..."
caseyneistat,3doadu,thisdesignup,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:14:26 2015 UTC,But it's not like there was a groundswell of negative info in the mainstream.   Their might have been had their been much more time before an official launch. I saw comments from tech news writers trying to bribe those who commented as being beme beta testers. It wouldn't have taken long for the information to get out.
caseyneistat,3doadu,unodo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:51:42 2015 UTC,"This makes the most sense, in his last couple of vlogs he mentioned that he would explain the app entirely before its release, and then in his last one he explained it and posted it as he had already made it live."
caseyneistat,3doadu,FalafelBall,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:26:55 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I am waiting until Monday to settle on my opinion."
caseyneistat,3doadu,wizardomg,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:22:57 2015 UTC,Sam Sheffer said live on Periscope that they would be working with Casey in the near future probably for that feature you are wondering about. The real question is how much of a fanboy The Verge will be with Casey as they are to Apple.
caseyneistat,3dln03,ikeasurvivor,63,Fri Jul 17 07:15:52 2015 UTC,"So Casey says in the latest VLOG:  ""...and we wanted you to keep watching the rock concert while still letting you share.""  Who would want to share only 4 seconds of a rock concert?"
caseyneistat,3dln03,thegroovologist,21,Fri Jul 17 13:09:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Also, how can someone genuinely react to what they're seeing if it's only 4 seconds long and then it's gone? It takes a second or two for me to realise what is going on in the video, I'm then hardly gonna have enough time to remember the gesture for sending a reaction, or indeed view any content that is worth a reaction, in the remaining TWO seconds."
caseyneistat,3dln03,ShezaEU,16,Fri Jul 17 13:17:21 2015 UTC,They need to increase the timing. I thought it was a great idea till i saw that the maximum was 4 seconds. I feel like that shouldn't be the direction they take it. There is so much you can do with this idea actually. Just not when it's 4 seconds. Vine works because you can edit things.
caseyneistat,3dln03,Charles211,6,Fri Jul 17 13:32:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Obviously editing goes against the whole idea of Beme, so the only way to improve it is increase the time. I'm honestly surprised it's not a simple 'hold up to your chest and record for as long as you want' affair.  You can have a long line of short 4 seconds clips that appear in one 'tap-and-hold' (trying desperately to not compare this feature to Snapchat Stories)."
caseyneistat,3dln03,ShezaEU,3,Fri Jul 17 13:35:37 2015 UTC,"It would be cooler if you could record longer videos and give them a name, like ""Longboarding down main street"" or ""Riding a roller coaster"". So you could choose which longer POV videos you wanted to watch based on the title. My biggest problem with Snapchat is that all my friend's snapchat stories are boring as fuck. I only keep that app to snap my gf. I would definitely not use Beme as it is (though I can't anyway as of now, iOS only)."
caseyneistat,3dln03,Super_Zac,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:03:03 2015 UTC,I feel like all this input wouldve been important in the beta haha. He really should've released to a bigger platform.
caseyneistat,3dln03,Charles211,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:59:45 2015 UTC,Long even bad quality video takes up an insane amount of bandwidth. Especially if they are going to be hosting the video on their servers. They will need to keep the videos short and bad quality to make it reasonable when it comes to hosting costs.   So I would not hold your breath waiting for longer then 4 seconds video.
caseyneistat,3dln03,Statecensor,2,Sat Jul 18 07:54:37 2015 UTC,I understand that! i wasn't trying to say it should allow editing haha.
caseyneistat,3dln03,Charles211,2,Fri Jul 17 13:55:55 2015 UTC,they might not have the server space to store potentially hundreds of thousands of clips longer than 4 seconds......
caseyneistat,3dln03,leoroidss,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:18:47 2015 UTC,"2 million can buy a lot of serverspace, especially if the bemes get deleted after a certain time period (in sure they will)"
caseyneistat,3dln03,branmuffinzed,2,Fri Jul 17 22:43:05 2015 UTC,he doesnt have 2 mil for server space though.  if he employed a team of 6-7 for 2 years im sure it cost a lot. I highly doubt he managed to entice them to work with him in new york with just promises and stake in the company. also im sure leasing office space in newyork for 2 years isnt cheap.  honestly only getting 2mil from a VC in 2 years of developement isnt great for a social media app. there's probably a reason why they only raised 2 mil when compared to snapchat who managed to raise a 100+ mil in investments in their first 2 years. of course to be fair snapchat was already a fairly well working by the time they got their first round of funding. and the 2 devs essentially built it for free for themselves as a college project in a relatively short amount of time.
caseyneistat,3dln03,leoroidss,8,Fri Jul 17 23:04:41 2015 UTC,that is if your phone is able to record anything worth watching since it will be pressed against your chest and you have people standing in front of you. why do you think people do this at concerts.
caseyneistat,3dln03,yoRedditalready,3,Fri Jul 17 14:22:04 2015 UTC,I'd say 15 seconds minimum...that would make sense.
caseyneistat,3dln03,thegroovologist,2,Fri Jul 17 13:19:18 2015 UTC,4 seconds feels really long when you're holding your device against your chest. 15 seconds lets not even talk about it.
caseyneistat,3dln03,ikeasurvivor,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:40:13 2015 UTC,The proximity sensor thing really feels like a gimmick to me.
caseyneistat,3dln03,thegroovologist,4,Fri Jul 17 16:46:39 2015 UTC,"One man's gimmick is another's USP. Let's see how it plays out. It's hard to tell whether beme will be a success until a lot of people use it. I remember all the noise when snapchat got big:  ""Why would you want to automatically delete it?"" ""Why is it only 10 seconds?"" ""It's only for dick pics"". Snapchat turned out to fill a nice little niche for sharing small, low-effort content that isn't 'Facebook-worthy'.  Maybe beme will flop, but I like the 'authentic' idea. Let's wait and find out. Someone on here even said something like 'who would want to share themselves without reviewing/editing?' you mean like you do IN REAL CONVERSATIONS?!  Anyway. Just my two cents."
caseyneistat,3dln03,jagershark,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:01:03 2015 UTC,"So true. I remember reading a thread a while back (using a website that was an internet time machine). The thread was about redditors reaction to the new comment feature, basically you could write comments. And almost every single comment was a negative one, saying that it was a ""stupid"" idea. Yet Askreddit is today the most subbed subredit. A big fat LOL. So I agree with you"
caseyneistat,3dln03,EngineersIremember,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:35:27 2015 UTC,"You do understand that ""in real conversation"" you have the ability to correct yourself. Beme isn't the equivalent to real conversation. It's more in lines with blurting something out and running away..."
caseyneistat,3dln03,ChickenTraffic,12,Sat Jul 18 05:37:27 2015 UTC,"and what can you record with your phone close to your chest, standing behind other guys..."
caseyneistat,3dln03,edmontom,3,Fri Jul 17 13:18:54 2015 UTC,Exactly.
caseyneistat,3dln03,thegroovologist,3,Fri Jul 17 13:21:27 2015 UTC,"You watch the video? You can cover the sensor with your hand, and raise it up."
caseyneistat,3dln03,Charles211,13,Fri Jul 17 13:30:03 2015 UTC,"yes, I did watch it. but just think how stupid you will look like, while trying to manouver the phone to catch good angle, cover with hand and then record. not to mention that you will not ""pay attention to the moment"" while doing that"
caseyneistat,3dln03,edmontom,5,Fri Jul 17 13:37:38 2015 UTC,"You can just record a regular video/Snapchat video/Instagram video/etc and hold it up, and that's easier..."
caseyneistat,3dln03,lazyflowingriver,2,Fri Jul 17 13:40:02 2015 UTC,looks like the screen is completely black when you do that
caseyneistat,3dln03,dizzi800,2,Fri Jul 17 15:00:55 2015 UTC,lol the screen is completely black when you reocord.
caseyneistat,3dln03,Charles211,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:21:12 2015 UTC,If you're doing this you might as well just use snapchat
caseyneistat,3dln03,bowtiesarcool,44,Sat Jul 18 04:40:37 2015 UTC,"I've never used a less intuitive app.  I have literally no idea what to do inside the app (I had to come to this subreddit to find out). It's not clear what it's for, how to use it, how or why to follow users, who to follow, or how to see the content you've posted.  When I try to pick up my phone, it starts recording.  I set my phone face down with the app open, and that was very bad. Now my page(?)/profile is filled with blank videos, which I can't seem to modify or remove.  When I actually did figure out what the app is used for, I held the phone in front of me, it vibrated to indicate recording started, and then was cancelled a second later.   My advice to the creator is to at least be up front that this is a public beta, and have an open call for feedback within the app itself.  I feel like if there were beta testers -- and this is a massive, baseless assumption on my part -- they were probably yes-men followers of Casey Neistat (I'll admit I don't know who that is it but it seems he has quite a following) who didn't provide honest feedback. Go outside the circle if you want real feedback, and if it's public feedback, make sure you call it a public beta. I'm now turned off to the entire idea of this app because it didn't work for me (and doesn't fulfill a need).     edit -- some other concerns:    I'm pretty sure I'm going to see something I don't want to by watching things from ""faraway strangers"". There's no contrast on the text. It's so hard to read.  Oops, don't put your phone in your pocket with the app open.   I will happily offer feedback to the team if they need it, but right now, out in the open is the only way to do that. I can provide feedback as a product designer and an outsider/non-Casey follower."
caseyneistat,3dln03,Etab,7,Fri Jul 17 14:46:32 2015 UTC,Yep. The fact you can't get rid of old 'Bemes' and I'm unsure of how long they stay for is ridiculous. Everybody's 'test bemes' are now a part of their story thing and it sucks.
caseyneistat,3dln03,DanH-D,6,Fri Jul 17 14:57:24 2015 UTC,"I can't understand why someone who creates amazingly edited, well crafted Vlogs everyday would then create an app that does the exact opposite."
caseyneistat,3dln03,ParkShipPirate,6,Fri Jul 17 19:43:28 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. He says that he spends about 3 or 4 hours on editing his vlog every day, always picks fitting refreshing music and he also keeps an archive of timelapses to use later. And that's why I like watching it! So why does he encourage people to do zero-effort videos?"
caseyneistat,3dln03,HyozanX,2,Fri Jul 17 21:27:30 2015 UTC,"The thing is he isn't encouraging people to create content with this app. He's encouraging people to share moments through social media without technology inferring with the person's real time experience.    The team has a great vision and is something that no one is really zeroing in on, but the app fell flat."
caseyneistat,3dln03,grant622,3,Fri Jul 17 22:35:00 2015 UTC,"For someone who constantly praises intuitive product design, he totally missed the mark in his own app. Casey needs a new UX designer."

caseyneistat,3dln03,hangman_style,13,Fri Jul 17 08:00:10 2015 UTC,"Seriously, pretty much all Snapchat has to do is add an option to take photos/video with the proximity sensor and Beme is dead."
caseyneistat,3dln03,lazyflowingriver,7,Fri Jul 17 13:42:35 2015 UTC,how did it take 18 months though?
caseyneistat,3dln03,HEY_ITS_ME_UR_BROTHE,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:34:01 2015 UTC,Probably building all the backend and such. Snapchat already has all that so they would just need to add the simple proximity to record feature and boom.
caseyneistat,3dln03,Super_Zac,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:17:21 2015 UTC,"Snapchat can't. Someone actually pointed out they could have a patent for this. Cause if they hadn't, they would just copy it, and .. rest in peace Beme."

caseyneistat,3dln03,HEY_ITS_ME_UR_BROTHE,15,Fri Jul 17 20:13:39 2015 UTC,right but Casey said he's got a patent so snapchat won't be able to copy the whole proximity as a record method of they's what his patent is for beme
caseyneistat,3dln03,waitwhatthefudge,9,Fri Jul 17 20:54:08 2015 UTC,I doubt you can patent something like this. If you could patent something like this then the hardware of the phone itself and its functions become limited due to patents.
caseyneistat,3dln03,yoRedditalready,4,Fri Jul 17 13:37:09 2015 UTC,You most certainly can. check out the patent Snapchat has here: http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/21/snapchat-has-a-patent-that-could-help-it-become-the-defacto-camera-app/  so Casey's method of recording can be patented (recording video by ways of proximity sensor)
caseyneistat,3dln03,waitwhatthefudge,10,Fri Jul 17 14:19:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not a a lawyer, nor even familiar with patent laws. But I am sure Beme uses apples api to gain access to the proximity sensor, and I'm damn sure apple is not going to let you patent how their api can be used. This would stop the developer community (what iOS thrives one) from continuing to explore and create. What snapchat did patent was software(they made from scratch) and that is definitely something anyone can patent."
caseyneistat,3dln03,yoRedditalready,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:37:15 2015 UTC,"I didn't catch him mentioning a patent, was it in the video?"

caseyneistat,3dln03,ktmkid13,8,Fri Jul 17 14:12:41 2015 UTC,"No, because at least Tidal has something that draws some users in. Some people want HQ audio and exclusive Lil Wayne albums. I don't see why anyone would want to use Beme when it's basically Snapchat with the proximity gimmick."
caseyneistat,3dln03,branmuffinzed,13,Fri Jul 17 14:14:34 2015 UTC,"My guess: the initial idea was bigger or different than what could actually be implemented.  18 months of churning through ways to approach the problem and paring down your vision, your idea, until it's shrunk small enough to work.  That's probably why he's so excited about something so mediocre.  It was really cool in his head.  He's too close to the project to objectively step back and see that reality and the original dream don't match."
caseyneistat,3dln03,woohoowoohoowoo,5,Fri Jul 17 15:12:41 2015 UTC,"I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and reserve judgment until at least the app becomes open to the public. Perhaps a lot of time was spent in the conceptual stage, figuring out exactly what the app should be and how it should work. I haven't used it, so I can't tell if all of that effort shows. It's also possible he's been working on stuff that doesn't have anything to do with strictly building the app which we're not yet seeing."
caseyneistat,3dln03,besjbo,3,Fri Jul 17 15:44:53 2015 UTC,"well, when you spend 4-6 hours a day editing a vlog, you don't have much time to concentrate on a business.  The funny thing is that Casey has built up a valuable following on Youtube, he should concentrate on that full time."
caseyneistat,3dln03,everydayguy,6,Fri Jul 17 16:45:33 2015 UTC,"Casey honestly doesn't do much for his own company which I can see. He created the idea but he has zero app skills or any skills which would actually help his app become a reality. He can't code, manage finances, do UI design. All he can do his manage his company."

caseyneistat,3dln03,everydayguy,2,Fri Jul 17 18:35:42 2015 UTC,Yea except Casey's vision is crap. It doesn't align with his views at all. Not edited content is like the opposite of what all Casey's content is.

Casey has to realize his fans aren't the best option to test the app on as they will in most cases have bias opinions on the app. And i doubt Casey can keep the app running if the only people who use it are his fans."

caseyneistat,3dln03,markseesred,14,Fri Jul 17 07:54:48 2015 UTC,you nailed it  I'm actually shocked right now that this is what hes done
caseyneistat,3dln03,iOSecure,29,Fri Jul 17 16:19:55 2015 UTC,"I was literally just thinking the exact same thing when I was watching the reveal on the blog. It just looked like a poor man's snapchat that not only is less functional (can't take pics at whatever angle) but also more restrictive as well (needing a code? seriously?)  It's just.. terrible. I don't really know what else to say about it. It's actually such a poor idea and it is easy to see why it was so difficult for Casey to get backing for it. I understand the sentiment completely, but the concept and the execution are just so irredeemably bad."
caseyneistat,3dln03,bigboyjanoy,9,Fri Jul 17 23:07:05 2015 UTC,"I think your missing the point of using a code this early upon release. Although I kind of agree with you (for now) on it being like a poor man's snapchat, the purpose of the code is for people to send it to people they know, so people can create their own distinguished friend group. Just like Facebook or Snapchat, you wouldn't create an account and just message strangers, or at least I wouldn't.   There seems to be a countdown in the app (currently 99 days). I assume that once it reaches 0, considering the app has become more successful, the codes won't be necessary anymore."
caseyneistat,3dln03,MidsizedSedan,4,Fri Jul 17 15:02:53 2015 UTC,"There was once this social media platform google created  a few years ago called Wave or something like that and it built massive hype but only released a few thousand codes for people to use and as a result all the hype died because no one could use it. The product was fine, but all the potential users couldn't access it. Casey did something similar but his product is crap and he doesn't have the backing of a giant company like Google."
caseyneistat,3dln03,BroomSIR,7,Fri Jul 17 12:59:28 2015 UTC,"""Needing a code""   Yeah... It's a beta app of something being released by someone with a large audience. If they just opened the floodgates they would crash and burn.   They being their servers"
caseyneistat,3dln03,dizzi800,15,Fri Jul 17 14:27:35 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but still, how am I even supposed to pitch this idea to anyone at all?  ""Hey man, you should get this new app called Beme""  ""Cool, what is it?""  ""Well, it is basically snapchat but you basically have to cover the front camera to take a picture""  ""...""  ""Please bro I have no friends on it""  .."
caseyneistat,3dln03,bigboyjanoy,2,Fri Jul 17 22:28:33 2015 UTC,Ello. There is a reason it failed
caseyneistat,3dln03,branmuffinzed,3,Fri Jul 17 15:02:23 2015 UTC,I doubt they are angry. I'm sure they were told about the vision of the app and they still invested. If Casey went to Sharktank I don't think he would've gotten a penny.
caseyneistat,3dln03,TheUnarthodoxCamel,17,Fri Jul 17 15:07:14 2015 UTC,"The investor(s) are dumb as hell. I hope he has an extremely strong utility patent because this would be a damn simple update. And I'm shocked it took a YEAR for this  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand that people WANT to see themselves before posting it on the internet.   Visionary my ass... Then he uses an invite system and recommends waiting until ""next week""? really? this is social media. You don't implement a ""invite system""  If you can't handle the short burst of initial traffic you simply don't launch"
caseyneistat,3dln03,iOSecure,6,Fri Jul 17 22:56:10 2015 UTC,How are you shocked? It takes a lot of time to develop an app. Especially one that will be hosting and sharing multiple users content.  The investors won't be that upset. It's venture capitalism. The definition of that is investing in RISKY ventures that may pay off big. High risk high reward and they would have invested in many other ventures that failed. That's the nature of the industry.  For me the real test will be how they respond to the feedback.  Keeping it invite only is actually a smart idea. Because it keeps the app to the loyal followers who will be willing to iron out the problems.  You don't go to mass market with a product that clearly needs refining and changing otherwise you will be totally fucked from day 1.
caseyneistat,3dln03,thisistheslowlane,9,Fri Jul 17 14:45:08 2015 UTC,"His exposure will be highest on day 1. Invite systems do not work for social media  You can't advertise to mass market and then restrict users. Uploading it to the app store is basically saying ""Im ready"" if he wasnt he shouldve driven to more states for internal testing  People will react like this ""fuck that I'm not waiting when X app already does something similar and all my friends are already using it"""
caseyneistat,3dln03,iOSecure,3,Fri Jul 17 21:37:38 2015 UTC,You are so fucking right. Other companies/social media platforms have launched with invite systems and they've all crashed even with a better product.
caseyneistat,3dln03,BroomSIR,2,Fri Jul 17 15:09:53 2015 UTC,"I agree with invites.  It's like going to the bar and a guy says ""but you need to have an invite""."

caseyneistat,3dln03,TheUnarthodoxCamel,11,Sat Jul 18 14:31:30 2015 UTC,"yeah i feel like they should make an open beta version and test it with a larger audience to get feedback.  one question, did you give your honest feedback to Casey and co (like you wrote here)? cause if you did, and they are still not considering to change stuff or make it better, then it's sort of their own fault. In addition, even if it's a shitty gimmick, you might never know if it might actually take off. People thought instagram and snapchat were shitty gimmick apps at first"
caseyneistat,3dln03,gingerzak,11,Sun Jul 19 19:43:23 2015 UTC,I just can't see where I would use this instead of snapchat?
caseyneistat,3dln03,domd0m,3,Sat Jul 18 14:31:02 2015 UTC,This simple sentence shows all that is wrong with Beme. The differentiation factor is too low
caseyneistat,3dln03,ikeasurvivor,21,Fri Jul 17 21:32:33 2015 UTC,Damm. I work at a Tech Startup (not social media related) and know how hard it is to be disruptive. Marc Andreessen talks constantly about a startup or a new idea having to be 10 times better than what is already in the market and I think he is spot on. With out something being alot better it will be much harder to get the numbers. You do occasionally get lucky.. but unless there is a clear compelling reason for people to jump to a new platform it will struggle. If you are interested check out this lecture from someone who has done is more than once -> http://ecorner.stanford.edu/authorMaterialInfo.html?mid=2457  I don't mean to sound gloomy with this post.. I was really hoping that they had something 10 times better than any of the dozen social media apps I already have on my phone. Otherwise why would people move to it.. How will it grow.  I hope OP is missing something here.. :(  EDIT: Great (but long) post on tech disruption for anyone who's interested -> http://a16z.com/2014/01/14/the-four-stages-of-disruption/
caseyneistat,3dln03,NeverfearforIishere,9,Fri Jul 17 09:32:40 2015 UTC,"Its very unfortunate, because I want to like the app and use it a lot, but I dont. I do understand that he's trying to take out self-consciousness and fake representations from social media, BUT, at the end of the day, I'm not gonna send out a video to thousands of strangers that I can't even see myself. Thats not cause I'm self conscious, its just a simple act of review. And sometimes the unexpected happens and you want to delete a post or cancel your recording. But once its been 4 seconds, its out and a private matter is no longer private. I know thats unlikely a lot of the time but its that kind of reassurance and review that I need. It honestly just feels like a much worse snapchat. Hate to be negative, but its the truth for right now at least."

caseyneistat,3dln03,thegroovologist,9,Fri Jul 17 17:15:18 2015 UTC,Casey just post a video in the app that he's walking to the balcony. And this is exactly the problem with the 4 seconds. He welcomed the new user and need 3 takes to do it. He must see that it didn't work well!
caseyneistat,3dln03,FranklyReader,2,Fri Jul 17 07:33:12 2015 UTC,I also just watched some of his older beams. He wants to talk about something and it gets chopped off because of the 4 seconds limit.

caseyneistat,3dln03,markseesred,7,Fri Jul 17 16:56:30 2015 UTC,"I've seen the app for the first time today in the vlog and few things I thought of straight away are:   Why would some one use this over snapchat? So many people use snapchat nowadays, why should they switch or use both? As someone that uses snapchat occasionally I see no reason to switch.  Proximity sensor is cool/innovative but useless. I can hold me phone to my chest while holding the record button and get the same effect while having the benefit of being able to take selfies or pictures without flat surfaces to rest my phone on. Why would you not have any preview features? I want to see if what I recorded captured what I wanted, if it's not too shaky or not too blurry.   Sorry but it just seems like a simpler version of snapchat without all the useful features, I don't know what the new version will bring next week but as it stands, I wouldn't use it."

caseyneistat,3dln03,DrMalware,2,Fri Jul 17 16:30:41 2015 UTC,"I hate to compare beme to snapchat but it's just so similar.

As casey said, he used the vlogs to promote the app and I think this has fucked him up. If he had introduced the app later on (say 1 month ago compared to almost 4 months ago) people may have had far lower exepectations.  Also how the fuck did it take 10s of people 18 months to make this? I've seen other commentors here saying with their experience that the app should not have taken that long even with 3 guys, let alone a full office supported by tech professors from MIT.  I downloaded the app straight after watching the vlog and its already gone, yes casey said don't get it yet but I did anyway and what a waste of broadband it was. Had no idea what to do and gave up and went on snapchat.  Finally although fun in the work space is good for ethical reasons, i have no idea what anyone in the office was doing for 18 months, and although I can't say they worked because I only saw what was in the vlog, I have no idea how this app took 10 professionals 18 months and thousands in investments to make.  Sorry Casey but this is your biggest mistake."

caseyneistat,3dln03,lazyflowingriver,10,Fri Jul 17 18:08:29 2015 UTC,"I just got in and have a few opinions although I am not following anyone.  1.) The invite code thing is just straight up stupid. I know his focus is not getting more downloads, but better interactions. However, he won't make any money with this if there is an invite code needed. People will download the app then find out that they need an invite code and will just stop using the app and delete it. There will be a small userbase. People who are not on this Reddit or big Neistat fans won't use this app, meaning that there will not be true people using this app. For example, imagine if Mark Zuckerberg did an unlock code thing for Facebook and he had a big fan club Reddit page. The only people using that app would be people of Mark Zuckerberg. Again, there would be no true everyday people using this app due to this unlock code.  2.) I like the color scheme a little bit but however, I think that this current mode should be considered night mode and a more bright version being day mode. It is a feature Tweetbot 3 has.  3.) Where is the search box for searching for users? I just get this big list of users that I should follow. I want to follow people like Casey. A lot people are not going to have friends on here and it will be a lost cause. They would only be able to follow the person that invited them along with a whole bunch of other strangers.   EDIT: Just found the search box. It is in the following option. I do believe, however, that the search box should be more visible.  If Casey will fix all of this or add more features or whatever in the new ""final"" version that he will launch next week, why the hell did he even launch this version today? People will stop using the app today because of its lack of features.  On a scale from 1-10 on how I rate this app, it would be a 3.   Also, congrats Casey and team for the effort you put out for the app.  That is all I have for now. Thank you for reading.  (P.S. If anyone from Beme co. is reading this, feel free to PM me with any questions you may have or if maybe you just want to talk.)"

Then you can view their content. This will keep you interested as you know the person who is in there with you. The code will go away once they can actually handle the traffic.   They also stated this is pretty much a beta and the better release is coming out next week sometime which they fixed and added more functionality.

caseyneistat,3dln03,TheAlborghetti,5,Mon Jul 20 00:32:10 2015 UTC,I have already deleted the app
caseyneistat,3dln03,mealypotatoes,10,Fri Jul 17 15:24:59 2015 UTC,"Or maybe we're seeing this all wrong? Maybe. Just maybe, Casey understands that this is shit and it's just a quick thing they put together in a week. Maybe this is just marketing to make the real app seem even crazier and unique? The real app might be released next week and it's going to blow our minds. I say this because we're all right. 18 months and 2 million USD is just not what goes into making something of this quality. If I'm wrong than yes that is kind of sad.  But maybe, I'm right. This seems like something Casey might do"
caseyneistat,3dln03,Gonewild_Kumquat,5,Fri Jul 17 22:39:46 2015 UTC,That would be a horrible idea. He would turn a ton of users off from it even after the update because of the crappy original impression they got from it.
caseyneistat,3dln03,MJCPRODUCTIONZ,2,Fri Jul 17 17:00:07 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I thought something along those lines too. Doesn't make a marketing sense, I think, but what I noticed is this: He met with the beta testers in NYC, they seem to already have access to the app (one girl asks for Candace's username), then they are in the street probably testing the app. One guy is on the skateboard and films as he approaches Casey... wouldn't it make sense that he'd be filming with the new app? In fact Casey says ""did you get it?"" -> get what? The guy replies ""Damn, I only got three clicks""... what? Maybe next week's update completely revolutionizes what we see at the moment, I don't know."
caseyneistat,3dln03,leop911,4,Fri Jul 17 16:45:48 2015 UTC,"OK. mayyyyybe a decent plug-in for snapchat BUT .. a standalone app, from 10s developers, worked for 18 months, with a raise of $2M seed round?  NO, not even close."
caseyneistat,3dln03,DatguySpyros,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:13:19 2015 UTC,I really don't understand how this took 18m to build. A decent group of devs could put this together in a couple of weeks...
caseyneistat,3dln03,mrwiffington,4,Fri Jul 17 18:34:49 2015 UTC,"What a huge disappointment. This says a lot about the state of VC's as well, someone put up 2 million bucks for this."
caseyneistat,3dln03,CatalystCoin,8,Sat Jul 18 10:25:06 2015 UTC,"I haven't used the app, so I get that you're probably more informed than me, but I'm struggling to get why you're writing it off when it's similar to other things. Remember when everyone moved from MySpace to Facebook, even though they did the exact same thing? or from MSN messenger/Yahoo IM to Facebook messenger?  - If you look at the people Casey's been meeting with/signing up, there's clearly going to be great content on the app.   Yes, people will still use other apps, but I think of this like videos. I watch great, geniune content on Vimeo, but also watch things on Youtube. In the same way that I browse Facebook and browse instagram, why can't this co-exist with other apps. I think the 'genuine' nature of this means it'll have something other apps don't.   Guess I'll have to play with the app before I can agree/disagree with you properly!"
caseyneistat,3dln03,adamsunman,6,Fri Jul 17 17:09:44 2015 UTC,"I think that was just one of the points on why this app isn't as great as we all thought it was going to be. Apps and websites which basically do the same thing can co-exist, it's great to have alternatives, but when you compare Beme to (what it's obviously trying to be) Snapchat...it falls flat. The whole thing behind Beme is to share things without being self concious and to see people's reactions. Smart, yeah, but how many times do you have to keep putting your phone to your bloody chest to record a decent amount of footage for someone to realise what's going on and give an appropiate reaction? It's maybe just me. The only time I used Snapchat was to see what my friends were up to and in the rare chances I'll talk to them on Snapchat I would always cover the camera with my hand or something just so I could get a black picture. I don't want to take a selfie or record a video everytime I want to send my friend a message. This app is certainly for people who enjoy showing moments and love selfies. If you don't love any of those things then you'll be thrown into the category of people who just use the app to view people's Beme videos and that's obviously not what Casey wants with this stupid unlock code thing.  I seriously hope the audience for this app grows as seeing all the hard work Casey done for this to be thrown in the toilet would be horrible to see. I won't personally use this app but I'm sure a great amount of people will and that's all that matters. The audience will come."

Good point. When he talked initially about what he was going to do, he talked about how he learnt to edit using iMovie tutorials, and that this was the 'app version' of the same thing. You're right in that the 'phone to chest' feels unnatural, but then so did checking my wrist for a notification until I got an apple watch.   Absolutely agree on it not turning into a 'viewing only' app, and that's where I think the reactions are key. He's talked about a better version anyway, so let's see what happens!"
caseyneistat,3dln03,adamsunman,3,Fri Jul 17 23:08:49 2015 UTC,Yeah! Let's just watch what happens...especially me...just watch...from the far back seats...with my Nexus 5...go beme
caseyneistat,3dln03,Lack_,3,Fri Jul 17 13:37:44 2015 UTC,"Seriously...they had that whole team and Casey didn't get an Android engineer. If this was a paid app I would get the reasoning for that, but it's free. Maybe he couldn't afford to be paying an Android engineer or Matt couldn't thoroughly develop for the 2 platforms"
caseyneistat,3dln03,SuperSimpleStuff,3,Fri Jul 17 13:48:19 2015 UTC,But checking your watch is something that makes sense. Smart watches take an interaction you know and enhance it. No one has ever put anything to their chest to record anything.
caseyneistat,3dln03,branmuffinzed,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:57:12 2015 UTC,"ok, so bad example, but I guess something like selfies is a better one. Until the front facing camera became popular, people were taking photos of what they were looking at, now they take the opposite perspective.   You're right, it's really different and feels weird, but I'm already enjoying having a clear view of something rather than holding my phone up to record it."
caseyneistat,3dln03,adamsunman,13,Fri Jul 17 13:59:45 2015 UTC,This is the worst app I've ever tried.   I thought it was going to be live streaming of whoever was wearing 'Google glass' glasses. So interesting people could beam something and people could 'be me' from their perspective.   Casey has gotten so pretentious lately. And in not surprised that this is as is not functional. A hipster alternative to snapchat was never going to work as snapchat has it nailed for the masses at the moment. You can't bloody see what you're filming? You have to open the app before filming. No one knows you're filming which intrusive. Casey has said before that his life is boring in reality and his vlogs and videos embellish the best bits of his life. So it all seems hypocritical. I'm scared to say that his team were probably jobless and casey offered them a lot of money to do stuff he couldn't. And it can only be 4 seconds. Jesus. This is worse than google+.
caseyneistat,3dln03,Ryannnnnn,2,Fri Jul 17 14:45:21 2015 UTC,What you said about his team seems to be the truth. Did that Matt leave Tunblr for this idea or was he fired from it?

caseyneistat,3dln03,DeerOnTheRocks,3,Mon Jul 20 04:30:44 2015 UTC,"I doubt Casey is going to see this. So I suggest if you want to get his attention, download the app and write a review. That's what I did and unfortunately I had to give it a 1 star.. This app is shit."
caseyneistat,3dln03,Scottydbeatbox,3,Mon Jul 20 05:10:29 2015 UTC,I'm curious to see how the reviews are when they go up...
caseyneistat,3dln03,lazyflowingriver,3,Mon Jul 20 05:18:04 2015 UTC,"Also, I don't really see how the app can be changed or improved tbh. The only things that make it different from snapchat are the things that makes it worse than snapchat. Once they fix the problems and the things I dont like, it will just be snapchat with a proximity sensor and a much smaller community. Sorry Casey :/ I hope the vlogs keep coming. Its just hard for me to see this as a succeeding app."
caseyneistat,3dln03,ajcc,3,Fri Jul 17 14:55:59 2015 UTC,"It seems that casey made the app for the himself, the creator. Yes it's nice to be able to immediately post without having to push a button. The problem is that this sucks for anyone who wants to consume the content. The videos end up sucking. Casey said he wanted the app's ui to be a peak under the hood and not glamorous, which is fine when creating video but terrible for anyone who wants to watch it. I love you Casey but I don't know how you are going to fix this."
caseyneistat,3dln03,cmankick,9,Fri Jul 17 15:38:03 2015 UTC,"Although the app seems very much like other competitors, I do think the concept of not being able to judge your own video is interesting. Also I like how it shouldn't lessen the experience as you won't be looking at the screen all the time.  I agree that as it stands it needs improvement, but I can't imagine it's as bad as it is made out to be. The circlejerk seems strong in this thread."
caseyneistat,3dln03,Dallow,5,Fri Jul 17 15:47:31 2015 UTC,damn that's a shame to hear I really hope Casey improves it

caseyneistat,3dln03,thegroovologist,2,Fri Jul 17 15:52:24 2015 UTC,"The only thing I find unique about the app is to be able to tap the phone to your chest to start recording. That part is nifty. Most likely Casey does not have a patent or whatever it would be to keep somene else from doing this. If he does thats great, but i'm sure big companies like Facebook and Snapchat can find their way around it, Facebook could easily implement that into Instagram and Snapchat could easily put that into their app. I still definitely want to try Beme out to see what its like. Right now there are too many social apps out there to keep up with. I've seen apps like PPPHHOOTTOO (I think thats the name) there was another social sharing feed app that had a fantastic design. However it never caught on. If anyone has a code and would be willing to share I would definitely apprecite it."
caseyneistat,3dln03,grifftaur,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:51:40 2015 UTC,the reason it took so long to announce was precisely because of patent issues
caseyneistat,3dln03,Banaszewski,2,Fri Jul 17 18:53:12 2015 UTC,Gotta say I kind of agree. I've been messing with it this morning and it's still very buggy. The worst part is that there is no way to see what you have already posted and no way to delete what's posted on accident. If left this way I forsee the whole feed being flooded with shots of floor.
caseyneistat,3dln03,Creature91,2,Fri Jul 17 15:40:18 2015 UTC,Yea. Totally agree
caseyneistat,3dln03,hellojaelee94,2,Fri Jul 17 16:35:53 2015 UTC,"Okay but its the first release, I think you should give a little bit of time for the app to evolve and improve in function of the users. I don't think that snapchat was any better for version 1.0, they improved with time, its the same for beme"
caseyneistat,3dln03,fredhabsfan,2,Fri Jul 17 16:38:45 2015 UTC,I honestly thought this would be more of a snapchat/vlogging hybrid app. Make a short story using only snippets of video at a time.
caseyneistat,3dln03,PrettyPony,2,Fri Jul 17 16:39:42 2015 UTC,That is exactly what a snapchat story is.
caseyneistat,3dln03,jagershark,2,Fri Jul 17 16:46:40 2015 UTC,I don't understand why they released it so quickly without having the public beta testers provide them with quality feedback. It's only been like 1 week since the first public beta. They should have given it more time in public testing and delayed the release. Way too rushed...
caseyneistat,3dln03,PlamenDrop,2,Fri Jul 17 17:11:09 2015 UTC,"Something is funny to me. On one of his blogs, and on the beme.com page, it says something like they are pushing the limits of the camera hardware. How is using the prox sensor pushing the limits of anything?"
caseyneistat,3dln03,Bro-Science,2,Fri Jul 17 17:31:12 2015 UTC,I dont see the point of delaying the launch as the app is inherently flawed.

Am I correct in understanding that this guy spent an entire year of his life and $2M USD on making a handicapped Facebook knock-off?  How the hell did anybody think this app was a good idea, or that it would ever be successful? You don't launch an app by listing off all the things you can't do with it. You don't generate buzz with a tedious hipster lecture about staying in the moment, munching on an apple like some crotchety algebra teacher. You don't hit critical mass by repeating Google+'s exclusivity launch mistake. You certainly don't attract a userbase by poorly emulating the current hot apps, minus the functions that made them popular in the first place. You might as well spend a year developing a strain of marijuana that doesn't get you high.   I don't know much about making/promoting apps, but I do know failure when I see it.

Real people sharing real bits and pieces of their every day lives.    Honestly, I can't even really pinpoint what I like about it the most.  I just do.  I don't even really know much about Casey.  I just like this.  Once everybody figures out how to use it I think it's going to kick ass.  You can't judge the entire app based on half a days interaction with it.  I also think it's insane that EVERYONE on here thinks that they are some sort of tech savvy high-end web/app developer.  Stop.  We don't all need to be experts on everything.  People need to stop overdosing on things and just appreciate them for what they are.  I like the app.  That should be enough."

(They do have a discover feature, but thats basically content from brands/companies that pay them)  What i like: The way you shoot is interesting, and i would love to see people being really creative with it. I like that you can watch bemes from people far away. Thats quite interesting. I hope they content gets better and more creative.

I still fail to understand why should anyone want to go through the trouble of shooting a video, making a snapchat story, etc when it gets deleted after 24h. Maybe I'm old fashioned or too old for this kind of social media but I just don't get it.  So, realizing that beme was somehow a snapchat clone was the first disappointment, cause I couldn't see myself using it.  I downloaded it anyways, cause, what the hell, it's free! Why shouldn't I try to support Casey after all these years of watching his videos? But then upon opening it, the code stuff comes on. Well that's even more disappointing. I reserved my username anyways and I can see why they decided to implement this, but I can see A LOT of people will be bothered by this and instantly close and delete the app.  I too am bothered because I obviously don't personally know anybody who is already in, and I don't want to go around begging strangers for a code for an app that I probably will never enjoy as it was intended.  Also, please don't believe the people that say ""follow me on X (any social media) and I will send you a code"" or even worse the ones that ask you for your email address!! Those are clearly scams but this stuff comes up every time an invite-only platform is released.  I'm still curious to try the app even if I don't know how will I ever get a code"
caseyneistat,3dln03,sniape,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:09:20 2015 UTC,"Was reading through the Beme Job page...they're looking for UI/UX people who are a ""Strong advocate for putting a version of the product in users’ hands as quickly as possible."" and ""Conversely, weigh/prioritize speed over pixel-perfect design."" The real topper was ""A pragmatic approach: interest in Swift, Reactive Cocoa, and other nifty tools, but a strong bias toward using a sturdy chisel over a laser CNC""  Full Disclosure, I have developed for iOS before, but not on the scale of Casey and his team.   That said, here are my thoughts.   To me, I think the app is out, and thats a huge step. But they know the UI/UX is rubbish. It sounds to me like they are going to do some major polishing. Beme is a platform, and platforms grow and develop over time. I find the code entry system to be an interesting approach that seems like a way for Beme to drag out the hype of its launch for a bit longer than usual.   I wouldn't pass to hard a judgment on a beta app. Let the app come to full fruition first."
caseyneistat,3dln03,Jrp95,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:59:12 2015 UTC,"Why release it now then? This is such an issue for me. First impressions are EVERYTHING. Release the app when it is more fleshed out, more fully focused, and more distinguished then. As it stands now, it's none of those things."
caseyneistat,3dln03,nythroughthelens,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:52:43 2015 UTC,"First off, if this really violated your NDA you are a dick.  Sharing information with the public intended to be kept secret is rude and shows a huge level of immaturity and class on your part.  Secondly why is everyone so quick to trash this app, its barely been released yet.  Give them a chance to update and refine it over time.  Remember how much snapchat and facebook and instagram sucked the first day of release?  Probably not because you hadn't even heard of them yet.  So at least he's doing the marketing part pretty well.  I'm holding out judgement until I get to actually use it and see what it turns onto.  But I think the criticism is pretty fair in that this just seems to me like a simple version of snapchat.  I'm failing to see the value of a snapchat with less features and using the proximity sensor instead of a button...  But I'm not very hip so what do I know."

caseyneistat,3dqz6m,JagsTuga,2,Sat Jul 18 16:42:48 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I love Casey's videos, but wasn't the whole idea of the app being real and show your real reaction? The only thing I see are people trying to be all ""swaggy"" (whatever that means) and trying to make reactions that they in a real world situation wouldn't do. Even Casey did that, when you react to something in real life you probably don't do that kind of faces, he missed the propose of his own app. He probably now gets the point: Reality isn't really that exciting."
caseyneistat,3dqz6m,DannyStormborn,0,Sat Jul 18 16:52:25 2015 UTC,That is people reactions to his video....

caseyneistat,3dqz6m,TweetPoster,4,Sat Jul 18 18:09:06 2015 UTC,"But the posing aspect is real, because there's no opportunity to edit or delete or tweak your reaction before it's sent away. It's immediate and final -- unlike things like snapchat and IG where you can retake pictures over and over again until you like it.  That's -- in my opinion -- what he means by ""real"" and ""authentic."""
caseyneistat,3dqz6m,bradwwfc,2,Sat Jul 18 17:23:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, the posing is happening in that moment and can't be edited or changed and stuff like that but, for what i understood, the idea was reacting genuinely and at the moment like you were watching a video. So you mean that there are people that while reacting to something or a video get their tongue out or make poses? The reactions are comparable to what you see in instagram, snapchat or even facebook."

This whole thing with the vlog and the app has pretty much convinced me that this guy is actually a pretty dim-witted asshole with little to no humility and incredibley inflated sense of his own ideas. What kind of person thinks they've reached a level of success in their life that they give nothing but advice on how to (basically) be a success in everything they do? Someone who is arrogant. If NO ONE in this company had the balls to say that this app is basically garbage then they deserve to fail miserably (I hoped they don't, but it seems like they will at this point). Gah!!"

caseyneistat,3do176,_Sunday,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:08:19 2015 UTC,The answer to this question is simple both Casey and Candace have a sibling that lives in LA. Casey has a sister Jordan that's like never mentioned in the Vlogs but if you look up the Bio in their Neistat Brothers show page located here you see it mentions sister Jordan. Also Candace has a sister named Kara. So basically that's why in the vlogs Casey has talked about LA. While Casey has his brothers Van and Dean in NYC I'm guessing since Candace's only sister is in LA that's put pressure on him consider moving.

It's a common tactic employed by almost all social media apps and sites: you make it great, and approachable to users, you build the community and then you slowly introduce money making methods. That way the new users don't leave at the beginning because of ads and whatnot, and by the time you monetize you have a big following who won't mind a few ads"

caseyneistat,3dm7b9,gingerzak,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:54:37 2015 UTC,"no, just judging from the video. you can see he presses and holds, it takes some time before it actually starts playing. also, i feel that people will just use the proximity sensor as a button to record stuff, they won't have to put it against their chest or wtv"
caseyneistat,3dm7b9,swollenmonkey,2,Fri Jul 17 15:36:10 2015 UTC,I think it's a good idea but a lot of people won't use it plainly because most people on social media platforms probably portray there life to be more exiciting than it actually is

caseyneistat,3dm7b9,LikeTheseOdds,2,Fri Jul 17 12:57:11 2015 UTC,"Doesn't look that way at the moment, it's specifically using iphone features. I'd say it'll come over eventually. Just may take some time. I'm in the same boat, have an android.   One way to look at is though, when we get it it'll be close to prefect as they've had all the time to iron out any issues.  E: nvm, thought the proximity sensor was iphone specific. My mistake. Could come to andriod sooner than we think :)"
caseyneistat,3dm7b9,kylthmp,7,Fri Jul 17 13:00:32 2015 UTC,"specifically using iPhone features    All it uses is the proximity sensor. EVERY touch screen phone has one. When making calls and putting the phone to your ear it senses that, and turns off the screen. So EVERY smartphone has it.   Unless there is more that I'm missing"
caseyneistat,3dm7b9,WhenItsHalfPastFive,3,Fri Jul 17 13:33:27 2015 UTC,"I have an android, and I have noticed that a lot of popular apps come out for ios first.   I don't know much about it, but is it easier to make apps for iOS because theres not many types of ios devices, whereas there are billions of types of android phones? But I don't think the hardware of the phone should matter in this case."
caseyneistat,3dm7b9,yoRedditalready,-2,Fri Jul 17 14:18:56 2015 UTC,Its not only that it is easier to develop for iOS for the reason you mentioned (way less bugs due to only a handful of devices) but also that iOS is the mainstream market. it all comes down to customer demand.
caseyneistat,3dm7b9,WhenItsHalfPastFive,2,Fri Jul 17 14:35:30 2015 UTC,i wouldn't say the mainstream market argument is necessarily true though. Majority of the market of smartphones is dominated by Android.
caseyneistat,3dm7b9,GND52,3,Fri Jul 17 14:53:42 2015 UTC,"But the majority of those Android phone users occupy the bottom of the market and don't use many, if any, third party apps.   When you look at just the high end of the market, the segment of the market where people actually use third party apps, you see that it's dominated by iPhones."

caseyneistat,3dm7b9,DeerOnTheRocks,-2,Fri Jul 17 17:51:22 2015 UTC,"Casey needs an education. Needs to go  to college. I find it unfathomable that inside Casey's mind he just thinks, ""people shouldn't use filters and look good in their photos. No more interesting looks. No more looking good for appeal! People defiantly want to show the real you to their friends!!"" Thus Beme. Yeah casey, you don't want to see the real me. Trust me."
caseyneistat,3dm7b9,wyfair,17,Fri Jul 17 15:01:26 2015 UTC,Going to college has absolutely nothing to do with it.

Im not  risky enough to get so much funding and to put my job on the line. For Casey though, he is lucky that he has videos to eventually keep him going after this.

But the four-second video thing is just dumb. I hope that's because it's still in the beta stage and they want to keep resource usage low, because I can't think of anything useful you can do with a four-second video, especially one you can't edit."

I think Casey has been a victim of his own success. His video work is nearly always great and he has a solid filmmaking career to the point companies will literally give him a tonne of money to 'go wild' and make a promo video whatever way he likes. It seems this has leeched into the app. To me it feels like a lot of people invested on his name alone, a sort of ""Hey, Casey is good at making movies so surely he'll make a good app"" type approach. That, and I wouldn't doubt he has been surrounded by a team of 'yes men' afraid of voicing any real criticism.  edit: For anyone that wants to see for themselves I should have a few codes left if you want to PM me! :)"
caseyneistat,3dmss4,origpenguin,2,Fri Jul 17 16:55:06 2015 UTC,"I think Casey's fans as ""feedback"" is a shit choice.  Seriously, do you think you will point out flaws on your ""idol's"" app? I can just see thru the vlogs how all the people are cheering, i don't know, it's just weird and stupid. Why not give it to random strangers, not actual fans?"

caseyneistat,3dmss4,mstrymxer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:32:13 2015 UTC,Just look at the rating in the app store.  It's currently sitting at 4.5 stars with about 90% of ratings being 5 stars.

caseyneistat,3dmss4,DatGuyRich,6,Fri Jul 17 15:31:17 2015 UTC,My best guess is if after 18 months your app looks like this a update before the official release will only change minor things or fix bugs.
caseyneistat,3dmss4,able101,6,Fri Jul 17 16:38:29 2015 UTC,How long have they been developing the app?
caseyneistat,3dmss4,Drives_a_Fiat,9,Fri Jul 17 15:45:35 2015 UTC,"1 and a half years, with a team of 10-15 people, over 2 million dollars"
caseyneistat,3dmss4,HEY_ITS_ME_UR_BROTHE,4,Fri Jul 17 15:52:20 2015 UTC,"I don't get his reasoning. Why release an unfinished app that is seriously lacking on so many facets? I mean he even says it in his latest vlog: ""Don't download this yet, wait until next week when we update it"" (i'm paraphrasing here). What's one more week over the span of 18 months?"
caseyneistat,3dmss4,Adobz,2,Fri Jul 17 17:46:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, why did they not release it when its not ready?  And the other thing, codes? Seriously? Codes for a SOCIAL NETWORK? Social network is about getting as many people as possible, and even thought you think codes will stop getting the wrong people in, it will not, it will only SLOW it down."
caseyneistat,3dmss4,jekyll5,3,Fri Jul 17 18:55:11 2015 UTC,I don't think the team's intent is to stop the wrong people from getting in. I believe Casey even said in his vlog that he wants the community to build itself. Facebook started off with invites only before opening up.

caseyneistat,3dmss4,DatGuyRich,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:16:57 2015 UTC,"based on vlogs, he constantly talks about Beme consuming the past 18 months of his life.  Another vlog was titled 2 million dollars, and he talked about getting 2 million dollars in investments for beme.  10-15 people is a guesstimate based on how many people you see in his office that most likely contributed to beme"

caseyneistat,3dmss4,Ryannnnnn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:05:25 2015 UTC,Wasn't it going to be launched next week? I think he launched it early and I would speculate that was because of the info going around about the app.
caseyneistat,3dmss4,branmuffinzed,26,Sat Jul 18 06:57:50 2015 UTC,"To be fair, it's only been released, there's an update next week, they'll be reacting to feedback etc. but 4 second videos where you can't see where you're filming, not to Mention the auto-focus may not react in time, is not a concept I see taking off. Also, selfie reactions is the worst thing I've ever encountered. If you were using a 180 fish eye  lens, it may be tolerable.   The video is gone forever and it's not meant to be a good shoot, so memorable or documentable moments won't be recorded. I imagine this app will waste a lot of people's time. Even if they don't know it is.   The snapchat feature where they compile snaps from lots of people at a particular event. How is beme ever going to compete against that.   Beme wants to be more in line with reality? Reality is mundane. Social media is an artistic representation of human life."
caseyneistat,3dmss4,thisdesignup,21,Fri Jul 17 15:49:22 2015 UTC,"Considering Casey makes heavily edited vlogs, he should know that life is boring."

caseyneistat,3dmss4,branmuffinzed,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:22:58 2015 UTC,"I think we are talking about two different things. I was talking about a person being bored of their life while your talking about others looking in on someones life and it being boring. A life is probably way more interesting to the person living it.   Though I still stand by what I said. Maybe people just live boring lives. That doesn't mean life in general is boring... you just have to make it not boring. Boring is an outcome, not a definition.  In terms the app we still only have the option to show the best moments of life. They will just always be unedited moments, unless the app evolves in the future which is likely."

caseyneistat,3dmss4,Adobz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:30:34 2015 UTC,There's only so little an upcoming update can do to an app that took a year to make only to later looking like this.

Just to counter point this, in his vlog where he meets up with Beme beta testers at the dollar pizza place, I thought the people with their phones out recording in front of their faces were rude. It came across as ""I only care of getting Instagram likes and building my social network"". The purpose of Beme is to tackle those kinds of interactions."

caseyneistat,3dmss4,zyndr0m,10,Fri Jul 17 16:22:35 2015 UTC,I do agree in that the vlogs have dropped in quality. The first 20-35 vlogs had a lot of artistic editing and shots. We barely see him go ahead and place his camera down and then walk back to make it seem like a movie.  I know it must be a pain to do that frequently but stopping little things like that will end up leaving you as 'the norm'.
caseyneistat,3dmss4,HEY_ITS_ME_UR_BROTHE,5,Fri Jul 17 17:16:07 2015 UTC,There's a reason why he gets invited to different galas and awards. Outside this whole Youtube-thing he has actually built up a name for himself. I don't think many actually understands that.
caseyneistat,3dmss4,DeerOnTheRocks,6,Fri Jul 17 17:52:07 2015 UTC,"I personally hated the hoverboard. Every single video was about hoverboard.  And i agree, first thing when i saw his vlogs (since no. 50 i guess?) was euphoria, now it's just meh. It was fun. I loved the DIY stuff.  He said he prefers to make things over buying them. And in one vlog, instead of painting over the wallet (he couldn't see it because it had dark color) or something, he bought a 200 dollar wallet. His choice, but why buy something thats easily ""fixable"""

caseyneistat,3dmss4,branmuffinzed,4,Sat Jul 18 17:47:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's overrated. But I guess people thought he was perfect, in that case that would be overrating.  I think he's an awesome guy, who never stops doing awesome things. Some things work out and become successful, and that is what we know of him, and some stuff fail and get washed away by history. Defining him as a whole just by looking at one project that might not succeed (Beme) is wrong."
caseyneistat,3dmss4,Banaszewski,8,Fri Jul 17 22:51:20 2015 UTC,"Casey is overrated and the app sucks.   Casey makes nice videos and has had an interesting life, but his army of superfans suck his dick. Hard. He has so many people who will blindly follow him no matter how bad what he does is."
caseyneistat,3dmss4,Rumsquall,4,Fri Jul 17 16:24:54 2015 UTC,riding hoverboards and going to lunch meetings is tiring...it's way harder than standing on your feet in a hot kitchen for 12 hours getting yelled at by your manager at mcdonalds

caseyneistat,3dmss4,DeerOnTheRocks,2,Sat Jul 18 06:46:31 2015 UTC,"There does seem to be a lot of hero worship of Casey, including on this subreddit (before Beme that is =P), so if he's overrated it's largely because people just put him on a pedestal.    He's an interesting and creative guy, and to be honest I didn't think the app would live up to the hype because there was just too much hype."
caseyneistat,3dmss4,timejazzfroghands,5,Sat Jul 18 01:25:02 2015 UTC,"Yes Casey is overrated. He frequently does put out good stories and videos like many people enjoy, but all in all, there is no creative video genius in him. He style is actually very simple and easy. His edits are not hard, he just knows the right cameras to buy and how to use them. I do applaud him for at least knowing what to put in the vlogs, meaning he doesn't make it too boring. I honestly could produce the same editing vlogs he makes given the right equipment, but do I have an interesting backstory about riding hover boards all day, no. I'm sometimes very confused by Caseys style to be honest. For example the new Beme video. Why does he have to present the audience with a closeup of a playdough can and then proceed to slap some down on the table. How does this shot benefit the purpose of the video. At first it makes one think that maybe the playdough will have some importance inside the video. But no, it is just slapped down and then a little flag with the word ""hi"" is stuck in it. The point is, too many people are being sucked into this cool editing layout and gorgeous picture style of Casey Neistat. The truth is, you yourself can probably be just as good as it."
caseyneistat,3dmss4,DeerOnTheRocks,18,Sat Jul 18 04:36:24 2015 UTC,The fact that he is actually doing the things you say anyone can do make him unique. He doesn't sit around all day and undo others' attempts at creating.
caseyneistat,3dmss4,timejazzfroghands,-9,Fri Jul 17 15:49:30 2015 UTC,"Not everyone has the numerous high quality cameras, mounts, and editing tools he has available to him."
caseyneistat,3dmss4,DeerOnTheRocks,10,Fri Jul 17 16:18:24 2015 UTC,"Sure mate, that's what's holding you back. Casey started his career on a handycam."
caseyneistat,3dmss4,adamsunman,-6,Fri Jul 17 16:20:31 2015 UTC,"You think he would still have all the viewers and fans if he used bottom of the line cameras? No, in order to sustain a large audience he has to really get the right equipment. He has reached that point where people are addicted to him because of an almost celebrity persona that he resonates."
caseyneistat,3dmss4,timejazzfroghands,3,Fri Jul 17 16:27:41 2015 UTC,"Ummm. he kind of did? the Vlogs are a new thing, all of his original stuff was on bottom of the line cameras."
caseyneistat,3dmss4,DeerOnTheRocks,0,Fri Jul 17 16:31:15 2015 UTC,"What's your argument? Why does it bother you that he is famous for being a charismatic guy who creates good content? You say that you could do the same with his equipment, so what's stopping you? Go for it. Or don't."
caseyneistat,3dmss4,thisdesignup,-1,Fri Jul 17 17:06:07 2015 UTC,"I never said I am bothered by him being famous and for being a charismatic guy who creates good content. That's awesome that he has good enough stories for him to propel himself that far. If people want to watch him drive to Connecticut and mow the lawn, that is entirely up to them! He can do what he wants last time I checked. It is the people who call him a ""filmmaking genius"" that am I most directly speaking to. Who even has the money to spend on cameras and all that junk when you are employed...that's why it is hard. Only Casey has the stories that seem to generate an audience. What I am talking about is picture and editing quality that people are so amazed by. Again, the discussion that this entire thread involves around is : ""Is Casey overrated?"""
caseyneistat,3dmss4,HEY_ITS_ME_UR_BROTHE,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:43:20 2015 UTC,Only Casey has the stories that seem to generate an audience.   Exactly. It's the story and not the tools used to capture that story which make the story interesting. Give the same cameras to a bad story teller and you won't get a good story. Give Casey a cheap camera and you will still get the same quality story. Maybe sound and video quality will go down but the story will still be just as interesting.
caseyneistat,3dmss4,HEY_ITS_ME_UR_BROTHE,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:53:52 2015 UTC,"hey, hey.   camera doesn't matter, the user does.  otherwise, agree."
caseyneistat,3dmss4,DeerOnTheRocks,-1,Sat Jul 18 07:02:52 2015 UTC,"Bullshit. Youtube has so shit compression even if you use a quality camera, it will look crap.  And what's so quality about H264 aka heavy compressed video from 5DMK3? Even a Panasonic GH4 is 1/3 the price and is an absolute killer of 5D (in video).  tl;dr for those who don't know cameras well: He uses a 3k dollar camera that's fucking amazing for pictures (with a right lens and smart user), but shit for video."
caseyneistat,3dmss4,HEY_ITS_ME_UR_BROTHE,-1,Fri Jul 17 18:53:20 2015 UTC,You can't argue with the fact that his video camera gives him a much better looking vlog. And yes I mean with all the attachments included. Those costs money too ya know.
caseyneistat,3dmss4,DeerOnTheRocks,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:48:19 2015 UTC,"I shoot videos. No, better camera doesn't make you a filmmaker.  If i buy a golf set that's worth 10,000 USD, will it make me (never played golf) a pro golf player?  It changes the physical video quality, not QUALITY of the overall ""movie"" obviously. But people mostly care about the second thing.  And i don't personally know, but tell me, what of these attachements is so expensive?  He uses Gorillapod or something, that's 60 dollars. If i count the cameras, thats G7X (decent video) for 400 dollars? A 70D, and couple of lenses.   Problem is, you can shoot the same with a Canon 600D/T3i and with a ""decent"" 200 USD lens, or, for me, the old full-manual M42 lenses, which all could cost (i got 5 of them) for lets say 150 dollars (they are sharp but you need to set aperture and focus manually, which isn't ideal for vlogs obviously).."
caseyneistat,3dmss4,HEY_ITS_ME_UR_BROTHE,-1,Fri Jul 17 19:19:49 2015 UTC,"First off, when dealing with if its expensive or not, all products ""expensiveness"" are relative to someone's financial situation. And to just summarize what I've been saying this whole time, the cameras, the expensive ones do not make you are good filmmaker. He is a great storyteller. Therefore to me, I believe he is overrated because I read a lot of viewers think he is a film making genius. No you can't just be great at film with the right cameras. But you DO need them to grow a large audience!!"
caseyneistat,3dmss4,0x808,2,Fri Jul 17 19:48:39 2015 UTC,This one was good. I agree with all your points of this comment. I just didn't get your point which started it.

caseyneistat,3dmss4,DeerOnTheRocks,0,Fri Jul 17 20:00:29 2015 UTC,"Alright. Let me buy you an RED Epic film camera (40k dollars camera) with sharp lens, and the best editing program ever.  I'm sure your video on an iPhone will look better than on RED Epic film camera because you'd not know how to use it.  Let's compare it with real life. Let's say you never played golf, and i buy you the most high end golf set you can have.  Will the equipment make you instantly a pro golf player? Not."
caseyneistat,3dmss4,HEY_ITS_ME_UR_BROTHE,0,Sat Jul 18 00:39:16 2015 UTC,"I only said that I could make the videos because I have editing and video experience. Again not the story. It isn't hard to learn at all. Look at Casey, he had no education in school for film and you admire his work."
caseyneistat,3dmss4,DeerOnTheRocks,0,Fri Jul 17 18:51:35 2015 UTC,"No comparison here, but education doesn't matter (openly said)  Film school teaches you theory, not practice.  Me before high school: I could shoot great pictures, but didn't know anything about photography.  School has taught me what is crop factor and all the stuff (also important), but that didn't change that i could take good pictures without it.  I'm not comparing myself with Casey. It's a example. Learning isn't hard, that's true, agree with you."
caseyneistat,3dmss4,MorgansButtcrack,0,Fri Jul 17 18:57:26 2015 UTC,"Personally, what do you think Casey's videos would be like if he went to college for film making? (Of course assuming he still vlog and had the same life)  Could it have saved his personal failure of the HBO series?"
caseyneistat,3dmss4,MorgansButtcrack,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:53:22 2015 UTC,"In short, he has become overexposed too quickly. Before he went mainstream, he was more interesting, more exclusive, our dirty little secret - now the world knows him ... his authentic self has 'gone corporate'.

I find Casey's vlogs much more Interesting than other vlogs because Casey actually DOES stuff.  He rides a bike on NYC streets, jogs on NYC landmarks, mods his Google Glass, skateboards in airports, goes offroading in New London, engraves everything he owns, takes care of his daughter, treats his wife out to NYC dinners, and other cool stuff."

This man said he has put his whole heart and soul into this app and its not your place to judge if he hasn't or not. Lets take snapchat for instance, that was used for dick pics at first, now it's one of the biggest SNs out there. He even said not to download it today and wait until the big update, give it a chance."
caseyneistat,3dmss4,WhoMcfree,3,Sat Jul 18 00:13:26 2015 UTC,"It should have at least been solid from day one. It's not.  The whole concept is flawed.  He also misled everyone into thinking beme is something it's not.  Thus, the backlash"
caseyneistat,3dmss4,Alex_Olympic,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:57:47 2015 UTC,I totally agree with you that this is in the early stages and judgement should come with understanding that the social media platforms we are comparing it to are fully developed and worth multi-millions or even billions. With that said I do not see the market value for this app. It has a narrow window and really snapchat can with one update fully erase beme's main feature and selling point.
caseyneistat,3dmss4,Rumsquall,-1,Sat Jul 18 06:18:05 2015 UTC,"So, my answer to your 'rant' is 'no', and if anything, I'd say he is under-rated.  First of all, we have no idea if the app will take off. I remember when facebook first came out (when it was only available to certain colleges/universities), I had friends who made profiles while muttering how pointless it was. The one thing which we can be certain about is that the app could never have lived up to the hype which Casey himself created for it. Everyone wanted it to do different things. But does that make Casey over-rated? I'd say no; all we can judge him on is the advertising campaign which I would say was pretty successful! Millions of people know about the app and most of them want it to succeed as they have a personal affinity to it's creator (and his hilarious wife and cute baby)."
caseyneistat,3dmss4,Alex_Olympic,6,Sat Jul 18 03:30:48 2015 UTC,"So your saying an app, that's core concept as been overwhelmingly panned by critics and fans alike, should be successful solely by the personality of its creator and his cute family? That's pretty ignorant man. Facebook (obviously) filled a gap of human communication, its changed the course of history in many regards, you compare that to this shit??"
caseyneistat,3dmss4,Rumsquall,0,Fri Jul 17 18:50:11 2015 UTC,"You seem to have totally misunderstood what I said!  1) I did not compare it to facebook. I was just making the point that even Facebook wasn't universally seen as a success in the very early days. Before you jump to further conclusions, let me be clear, I'm not suggesting Beme will be anywhere near as successful as Facebook, but merely making the point that even the most successful of companies are sometimes questioned in the early days.   2) I said the jury is out on the core concept. It's only been out a day! What I did say was that the advertising/pr/hype generation surrounding the app has been outstanding. And part of the strength of this is that people feel they have an affinity to Casey and his family; I think it's a more powerful delivery technique than traditional advertising.   In a nutshell; the advertising campaign for the app 100% worked; but the jury is still out on if the app will be a success."
caseyneistat,3dmss4,Alex_Olympic,2,Fri Jul 17 22:05:48 2015 UTC,"Beme is at its core a bad idea. You could use that Facebook fallacy for literally infinite amount of ""innovative"" startup companies. Facebook was a good idea that was bound to catch on. This is not. Consumers ask simple questions and they want simple answers, this app solves 0 problems that needed, and I stress that word, needed to be consolidated. In his own words, Casey states that this apps goal is to cull the carved and unrealistic realities we create in social media, who the fuck wants to share the boring shit that goes on in their lives? Too many problems with this idea. I feel like you're ignoring the reality of the situation here. This app sucks, it will not succeed in any capacity in the long term."
caseyneistat,3dnr18,chirivimurduk,2,Fri Jul 17 19:39:51 2015 UTC,"This is a good response. I also think the point of art -- which is what photos and videos can be -- is supposed to aim at being beautiful, not just crappy or mundane examples of reality."
caseyneistat,3dnr18,Dil202,2,Fri Jul 17 22:16:39 2015 UTC,"This is correct—Digital content is yet only another layer we can use to curate who we are. When social networks go away, we are only slightly more 'real', not completely and totally ourselves (that's why it's important to 'be yourself on a date' because we find it so easy to put on a mask). There are still numerous further steps we can undergo to manicure our appearance to others beyond social networking."
caseyneistat,3dnp3o,Alex_Olympic,5,Fri Jul 17 19:25:26 2015 UTC,"Not wanting to let users ""modify"" what their capturing seems even more odd for a guy that spends half of his vlogs showing timelapses...on top of the fact that you almost always have to adjust the aperture to make the picture/video even remotely similiar to what you are seeing with your own eyes. through a lens=never real"
caseyneistat,3dnp3o,BYDO1612,3,Fri Jul 17 19:55:46 2015 UTC,"Hey, what's wrong with timelapses? Timelapses are my shit. I love doing them but hey I'm just a guy in film school."
caseyneistat,3dnp3o,landsharkxx,2,Fri Jul 17 20:28:52 2015 UTC,"nothing is wrong with timelapses...that is the point. they look great, and we are able to appreciate them because someone had the possibility in ""post-production"" to create them. in beme you have no authority on that an hence can only capture what your automatic setting of your iphone lens captures...that is what I don't understand. His vlogs are so heavily edited and now he is promoting a ""realness"" of social media that cannot even be there, because it is still life through a lens"
caseyneistat,3dnp3o,BYDO1612,2,Fri Jul 17 20:33:11 2015 UTC,Imagine the film industry without post...
caseyneistat,3dnp3o,landsharkxx,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:40:18 2015 UTC,"exactly...social media in my opinion is about stories, and stories are being made in post-production. most social media is ""not real"" not because the platform dictates it, it is because the users chose to modify their life/their story...just like casey does it in his blogs."
caseyneistat,3dnp3o,BYDO1612,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:43:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with your point about post-production, I love Casey's vlogs, but I've always found parts of the staged content slightly weird (e.g. when he goes on a run, plants his camera and runs back past it to get the shot. It's essentially acting). But as a film maker he must spend a lot of time thinking about that: e.g. when he speaks to the camera does he just film as he thinks or does he plan what he is going to say. There must be times when he has clips of him saying the same 'line' a number of times and has to choose between the original take and the more polished practiced one."
caseyneistat,3dnp3o,edmontom,6,Sat Jul 18 15:06:57 2015 UTC,"What also bugs me is that Casey of all people thought that the total lack of editing option and no way to see what and how you're filming (impossible to set good angle, frame etc) would be a good idea."
caseyneistat,3dnp3o,00001011010000,2,Fri Jul 17 19:39:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, especially when he went on that rant a few weeks ago about how important editing is when it comes to making decent content. And that's not even touching on the fact that it's basically Snapchat. Casey clearly has a passion for hating ""copy cats.""  Tried to find the vlog where he answered the question on editing, I gave up."

Some he does save, others he doesn't. And social media is no different, some things will be documented on YouTube and Twitter, some things will disappear into the ether, like on Beme."

caseyneistat,3dmf4g,crypticpixel,4,Fri Jul 17 14:16:44 2015 UTC,"There will be an Android version but not right now since they're basically Alpha testing then Beta testing next week. If you have the app, it sucks currently on the iPhone. It crashes a lot and some of the features don't work but you can't really complain since it's version 1 right now.   People are complaining that it's not on Android now but it's very hard for the app to be on Android because of the problems it has on iOS.  Also they're using a lot of hardware based things on the iPhone (like the Proximity Sensor) plus it's easier to build on iOS than Android (not being a fanboy. I've had experience with App Development)"

caseyneistat,3dmf4g,SuperSimpleStuff,4,Fri Jul 17 14:54:56 2015 UTC,"Seriously...they had that whole team and Casey didn't get an Android engineer. If this was a paid app I would get the reasoning for that, but it's free. Maybe he couldn't afford to be paying an Android engineer or Matt couldn't thoroughly develop for the 2 platforms.

Really bummed by Casey not talking about Android or that it will be iOS only (at first?) And everyone makes it sound like it's an impossible task to develop an Android App. When you make a social App it should reach the most amount of people.  Like others said: Android or Riot, if he's not going to address that in todays vlog many people (me included) will be really pissed. I don't know why he or Matt didn't respond to anyone on Twitter/YT regarding Android."

To actually make the app (based on assumptions since I don't have full access yet) I'd say a month or less. The complexity comes in at scalability and if the transmission is going to a server, the setup on the multiple servers they have to have. So, app, no. Infrastructure, maybe. Plus I'm sure the marketing will be pretty reasonably good.  To be fair, I have only published one app to the App Store, though."
caseyneistat,3doxai,mofukkinbreadcrumbz,3,Sat Jul 18 01:39:08 2015 UTC,"Based on their technology stack they are very well good developers since they are built on top of a programming language called Go created by Google. In a developer's standpoint the app took less than 18 months to built, but I do know you have to be very experience to do some of the stuff Beme does. After this, the hardest part of doing an app that will / has receive a ton of publicity it is how the app scales.  The infrastructure of this application is huge. They are probably wasting more money on servers than actually paying their employees."

caseyneistat,3dm91z,Freddy216b,6,Fri Jul 17 21:29:47 2015 UTC,"I don't mean technical flaws.  The concept itself is flawed.  I also think he method of deployment was really poorly planned.  He restricted his user-base to people with iOS devices. In addition to that, he made the minimum iOS version really high, thereby further restricting even more users.  As for the concept, I really don't think people want to see other people's ""authentic"" life. We pick and choose the best moments of our lives, and want to frame those moments in the most perfect picture as possible.  Nobody is forcing us to review, edit, personalize, or change our pictures or videos to make them look better. People do it because they want to."

caseyneistat,3dm91z,Freddy216b,2,Fri Jul 17 22:05:36 2015 UTC,"I don't know a lot about marketing, but the most logical thing to do would be to open your product to the biggest audience possible right away, especially if it's an app that relies on popularity like Beme.

This makes makes it sound like there will never be an Android version, or at least not for the foreseeable future.  I, as an Android user, am actually pretty interested in seeing what this app is all about, however it seems like Android users may never get their hands on it.  I hate to pull up statistics and things to make me sound smarter, but its pretty common knowledge that Android phones own a considerable amount of smartphone market-share (over 70% according to many sources).   So yeah, I'll be pretty disappointed if Beme never intended to release an Android version if I'm honest.  Edit: a little grammatical error"
caseyneistat,3dnego,conorisabagel,2,Fri Jul 17 18:19:54 2015 UTC,The quickest way to know if they are going to Android is to look in their job listings.

caseyneistat,3dq2oz,EDL1,5,Sat Jul 18 09:55:03 2015 UTC,"What?  There is a huge difference between his vlogs and Beme. Do you really think he would leave his Youtube channel where his reach is +300k to 500k views per vlog, not to mention almost 1 million subs?  But then again, I am not an expert. I am sure one of the many experts will be here shortly to put me right."
caseyneistat,3dq2oz,_aaaa,0,Sat Jul 18 10:03:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, I agree on that. But don't forget he did snapchat a lot, but I really mean a lot before his daily vlogs. And he was just fine + he can use the youtube channel for other projects and beme related stuff. And he also doesn't monetize his youtube channel. I'm also not an expert, just a dude that likes his videos."
caseyneistat,3dq2oz,pussyrich,2,Sat Jul 18 10:06:37 2015 UTC,Nah he can't do timelapses in Beme. I hope he will sells the company and do more freelance film making. Vlogs of him making movies for Nike will be cool.

In this case, Beme isn't significantly different from Snapchat to create a new niche in the market. Seeing your friends temporary videos is just too similar. The proximity sensor just isn't enough of a main feature to woo users over. As others have said its just gimmicky."
caseyneistat,3dncu9,17_character_limit,6,Fri Jul 17 23:02:55 2015 UTC,Its getting hate because Casey promised this brand new innovative idea and people look up to him like he is a genius who will re invent social media with this mystery app and now it is out its just a worse snapchat with a gimmick

caseyneistat,3dncu9,rjcxvx,-1,Fri Jul 17 18:33:27 2015 UTC,"As far as I'm concerned, the reasons that it's being attacked so viciously is because this sub is inherently toxic, and full of teenagers that are desperate to prove that Casey isn't intelligent to boost their egos.    This whole situation reminds me of Justine Sacco, a former personal relations exec that posted an offensive tweet and everyone had a laugh because they knew she was going to be burned at the stake. Here's a shorter article on that situation."

caseyneistat,3dmind,DanH-D,9,Fri Jul 17 14:00:44 2015 UTC,That is exactly what I said to myself as soon as I got in. I want to love it.  How am I supposed to think about tapping a reaction shot if I am focused on your 4 seconds of video?  I've shared my unlock codes with 2 real life friends who are not into Casey or too deep in tech.  They both love snapchat. Each of them said to me that they do not like beme. So if the goal is to steal snapchat users then beme fails to do so.
caseyneistat,3dmind,remthewanderer,4,Fri Jul 17 14:15:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah exactly, I've barely used Snapchat and it seems to me Beme is a lesser version. As others on here have said; if Snapchat add a proximity sensor feature, then there is no need for Beme"
caseyneistat,3dmind,DatGuyWill,2,Fri Jul 17 14:21:29 2015 UTC,"Although I'm sure Bebe is patented to shit, there are probably snapchat engineers on beme as we speak trying to get as close to the sensor feature as possible for snapchat without violating Caseys patent.  Casey was doomed from the start, any app that close to the big companies like Facebook and Snapchat will indefinitely be almost 'bought out' and deemed useless when these companies take their designs."
caseyneistat,3dq6ck,XGLuxus,4,Sat Jul 18 10:59:21 2015 UTC,"Haha what? It allows you to be social without tech getting in the way? Dude, the whole issue people have with Beme is the fact that it's arbitrary focus on how you record prevents you from simply recording. The gimmicky proximity sensor prevents you from recording what you want, and instead forces you to adopt what half the time is a bad angle.   Snapchat allows you to show your life without doing all of those things you mentioned, them being an option doesn't make Beme's stripped down experience superior or groundbreaking.   This is exactly the sort of Casey fandom that led to this app getting where it is: blind devotion that refused to recognize the flaws that should have been eliminated from the start."
caseyneistat,3dq6ck,IsPepsiOk,-6,Sat Jul 18 11:06:50 2015 UTC,"I'm really looking forward to coming back here in a few months and saying ""I'm sorry, what were you saying?"""

caseyneistat,3dq6ck,domd0m,-4,Sat Jul 18 11:19:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly, no idea. The whole idea of no preview and no filters intrigues me a lot. So I would definitely check it out. But I don't know that I'd defend it like I have been doing."

caseyneistat,3dmrq8,awgg919,2,Fri Jul 17 16:19:54 2015 UTC,"It's a little confusing and the idea of not being able to see what you've recorded* is going to be an adjustment for me. I agree the recording time should be much longer, I liked the suggested 15 seconds. I don't like the feedback indication for beginning and ending of recording. I often have my phone on silent (pebble user, woo!) so I have no idea when the recording starts or stops. I counted out 4 seconds in my head to achieve a successful posting maybe 1/2 of the time. If I can sell my friends on this app, I think it will stay on my phone (granted they sell themselves on it, too). If not, there really isn't outstanding content on the app as it stands, so it will be uninstalled. I will definitely follow the progress on this app as it grows.   *I've noticed a bug that lets me watch my own bemes. My views count as views on my profile and I can react to myslef. Pretty sure this isn't an intentional feature."

He will continue to make money off of his older videos, but unless he is making commercials or involved in other ventures how will he be able to make a living?

caseyneistat,3doczl,XGLuxus,6,Fri Jul 17 22:32:02 2015 UTC,"Sure, the interface and concept look very similar to Snapchat, but like Twitter, Beme doesn’t ask you who you want to message. Whatever you beme is released to your entire list of followers.   Snapchat Stories serve the same purpose.   Reality is that they’re pushing boundaries a little bit too far from public comfort, as visionaries often do, and usually that is initially not openly embraced by most people.   I'm sorry, but you must be drinking Casey Kool-Aid.   PPS: Can someone please give me an unlock code?   You might want to try the app before you write 500 words about how good it is."
caseyneistat,3doczl,branmuffinzed,2,Fri Jul 17 23:42:50 2015 UTC,Pushing the boundaries...that snapchat had already pushed long ago...
caseyneistat,3doczl,Cant-Find-Username,-1,Sat Jul 18 01:30:27 2015 UTC,"I'm very well aware of how Snapchat stories work, but it is not the same because of their different purposes. Beme is about authenticity. It's about ""this is how my life actually is"" rather than ""this is how I want you to see my life."" I don't know if you guys recall but when Twitter came out everyone was just saying like ""What the fuck is this? Why would I join a site where people are just writing down that they're having dinner or that they're about to go to sleep?"" I'm guessing I don't need to tell you it is now used for much more than just that... Anyways, I think Beme might be going through a similar phase where there's a lot of very confused people that don't understand Casey's vision. And honestly, I find it quite sad that these people are mainly his fanbase. I haven't read any legit reviews criticizing the app the way it's being done here or on his videos.  PS: I watched app tours and read plenty of bullshit reviews to be able to understand what's going on."
caseyneistat,3doczl,branmuffinzed,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:57:03 2015 UTC,Twitter served a purpose that couldn't be accomplished on another service. Beme would go extinct if Snapchat added one tiny feature.

caseyneistat,3dnupg,_aaaa,2,Fri Jul 17 20:07:02 2015 UTC,"You are missing the point. Evernote, snapchat, facebook, instagram were all addressing something which was lacking in the market. Beme, although hyped in that direction, doesn't share anything new to the market. The 'features' are all already out there, and I think that is the main problem with the app.  They want to sell a philosophy instead of a tool, the problem is that even if I adhere to the philosophy behind beme, I don't even need beme to make it happen."
caseyneistat,3dnupg,chirivimurduk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:33:57 2015 UTC,"Evernote really wasn't something missing, but it's the best at what it does. I can't say the same about Beme."
caseyneistat,3dnupg,branmuffinzed,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:40:07 2015 UTC,"What's interesting, is that many popular apps, like facebook, instagram or snapchat, had no user base at the beginning, no pr, no marketing. Beme, on the other hand, has - in theory - huge potential user base: Casey's fans, people who watch his films, vlogs. And there a lot of them. So it will be very interesting how Beme's future unfolds."
caseyneistat,3dnupg,edmontom,-1,Fri Jul 17 20:17:11 2015 UTC,"The only people who are upset are Casey dick suckers like yourself though...   To be a fan of someone is pretty sad. I am not a fan of Casey, I merely watch his vlogs.   Why are fans of beme so distraught every time someone airs their negative view of the app?   It's improssibe to be a fan of beme, when it's out of my reach. I am not a fan of beme. In fact I am not a fan of social-networking apps like Beme, periscope and Snapchat.   The app sucks, hard. That is my opinion and I am free to share it, just like you are free to share your love for it.   No love for the app here.  The thing I am trying to figure is the hate. It's Day 1. Tell me of something that has been outright perfect on day 1 without the need to improve it."
caseyneistat,3domaq,gingerzak,2,Fri Jul 17 23:52:29 2015 UTC,"I think I can speak for most people here and say basically we all expected an app different from all the major social media platforms that solved a basic problem that the other services lacked an answer to. In that respect it failed, was way over hyped by Casey and his people and aside from a gimmick to capture it doesn't do anything that interesting."
caseyneistat,3dn094,CrissBowie,2,Fri Jul 17 16:20:45 2015 UTC,I have the same issue as well. It's just a bug probably that will be sorted out in the future release.  I'm digging app this too. I spent the last hour leaving reaction pics to strangers. could do this all day.

caseyneistat,3dn84i,ikeasurvivor,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:06:41 2015 UTC,"It's not about him personally being shit.   The problem is that he hyped a subpar product way too much. Before the big reveal, he talked about the creation hierarchy in one of his blogs. Thus, people expected some innovative creation tool. That wasn't it. In fact, Beme has NOTHING to do with creation. That's what sucks and that wasn't cool on Casey's part. This is why people are pissed on top of the fact that Beme is just plain bad.

caseyneistat,3dibfe,bookerio,9,Thu Jul 16 14:33:14 2015 UTC,This makes me think that the app has a minimum length not a maximum.  If it had a maximum why would be seem bummed that he made it under?

But, because of that, people are obsessed with him as some kind of genius.  He's a talented filmmaker, but is it a huge surprise that he may not be a genius app developer or entrepreneur? There's a huge difference between making short films/having an engaging personality and creating a social media platform/app.  It won't make me like Casey any less, but so far there's nothing that leads me to believe this app makes any bit of sense."

If the app records 4 second video, why would the kid be exclaiming ""Damn!"" for only recording 3 and a half seconds?  Shouldn't he be glad that the video made it under the 4 second mark?    Or maybe he's saying ""Damn!"" in a good way...  Like ""Damn, I can't believe I made the video that short""."

I'm not even the first person to do a CN analysis video.    That said, perhaps there are some people who have not taken the time to take apart what they are viewing.

I already have mine set up and all my friends added. I refuse to download another social media app that solves problems I never had in the first place.
caseyneistat,3dfwza,Scottydbeatbox,3,Thu Jul 16 01:13:51 2015 UTC,"Looks like the app is about reactions via pictures. So, someone sends you a picture/(video)? and you react to it... with a picture. I'm disappointes."
caseyneistat,3dfwza,Scottydbeatbox,7,Thu Jul 16 02:02:56 2015 UTC,It sounds so stupid! Don't get me wrong I'm a huge Casey fan and everything. But I'm just trying to be unbiased in my thinking. I am seriously unimpressed and disappointed in the app.
caseyneistat,3dfwza,Astrophsx,3,Thu Jul 16 02:55:20 2015 UTC,"I feel like Casey was just the ""idea man"" since he has no background in programming and seem to only be managing things and helping promote. I have to wonder if he had ideas that they weren't able to build do to a small team and really $2m may not be a lot to fund an app with advance features? I think the app is about as cool as the logo from what details have been leaked."
caseyneistat,3dfwza,Jaredbt,4,Thu Jul 16 03:08:59 2015 UTC,"There's probably a reason he was turned down by multiple venture capitalist firms, and I think we're seeing it now.    The app lacks originality and is more of a mashup of existing platforms. Obviously if the app does magically blow up, investors will be looking to get on board, but I wouldn't bet my money on it obviously they weren't willing to either."
caseyneistat,3dfwza,Rumsquall,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:28:11 2015 UTC,"2m is a RIDICULOUS initial investment in terms of raw funding, I seriously doubt there are features that were left on the chopping block."
caseyneistat,3dfwza,JagsTuga,8,Fri Jul 17 00:02:16 2015 UTC,"Edit: Beta tester just asked Casey about the etiquette of reactions on Beme on Twitter. Looks like the person talking about reactions via pictures was right. It's more likely that the screenshot isn't of a livestream, but of a ""reaction"" in the form of a picture. This might be a shit app, oh god..."
caseyneistat,3dfwza,Professor_Panda,2,Thu Jul 16 02:01:45 2015 UTC,"That my reaction too (pun not intended ahah). I though that the app would be something like instagram or something like that with some kind of gimmick (which would be cool), if It's a spinoff Snapchat it'll probably be pretty shitty. That's my opinion right now but we'll see when the app launches."
caseyneistat,3dfwza,DeerOnTheRocks,4,Thu Jul 16 16:14:20 2015 UTC,"C'mon guys, let him release the app to the public or at least announce what the app is before everyone shits on it lol."
caseyneistat,3dfwza,DeerOnTheRocks,2,Thu Jul 16 13:54:23 2015 UTC,I don't think your right. Because beta testers were asking for Candices username. Why would Casey give that out. Like why in the world would Candice just want to talk to random people.
caseyneistat,3dfwza,lileyedmonster,2,Fri Jul 17 04:39:10 2015 UTC,"This won't be a super successful app the first time around. Sorry Casey. You're lucky you have fan boys to use it.

caseyneistat,3ddgn0,Mewzen,2,Wed Jul 15 15:37:49 2015 UTC,"All you have to do is go to Beme.com --> Jobs (at the bottom of the page)  The job descriptions and requirements give you a good idea of what they're looking to build.  It's a video streaming app, hence his meeting with Jerome in LA, as well as distributing the beta to a whole bunch of Snapchat, Instagram, and Vine-using teenagers."
caseyneistat,3ddgn0,MeowsiveUndersteer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:56:03 2015 UTC,Check out my guess (link to self post in subreddit)
caseyneistat,3ddgn0,nichampagne,0,Wed Jul 15 17:54:16 2015 UTC,It's a lot like Snapchat except users are limited to ~4 second videos and your recipients send reaction selfies. The 4 second thing is more of a rumor. It looks like within the app in order to activate the camera you lay the face of the phone against an object (chest/floor/table) and once you release the phone from the object the proximity sensor detects it and starts the camera. This information seems confirmed in one of the vlogs as someone seems to be using the BemeApp in the background.
caseyneistat,3ddgn0,Astrophsx,0,Wed Jul 15 20:18:33 2015 UTC,"I think its an app that connects people that want to fulfill a dream with people that can make it happen.  Want to (enter your dream here) spend the weekend on a houseboat on the mississippi river in Iowa? Enter your dream in the app, someone sees it and says ""hey, I can make that happen"".  Boom, connection made, dreams come true.  Thats my guess and I'm stickin' to it."
caseyneistat,3ddgn0,nichampagne,2,Wed Jul 15 17:34:34 2015 UTC,"That's a great idea, unfortunately rumor as it that it will be a video/photo sharing app. I think that's a awesome idea and I think that (if that Casey doesn't do that) you (or someone else) should create this app and turn this idea into a reality. That's something different, something new and innovative, it's not a spinoff of other apps as I think Casey's app will be. There are literally thousands of social networks and apps for that matter but apps that help dreams come true don't exist as much as they should."
caseyneistat,3ddgn0,JagsTuga,0,Wed Jul 15 21:01:42 2015 UTC,"Nice idea, but Casey's outlook is all about working hard to EARN your life goals. I'd be surprised if he set up something that just hands people's dreams to them."

caseyneistat,3ddgn0,Mewzen,3,Wed Jul 15 15:38:14 2015 UTC,"You are probably right. I guess I just assumed it didn't had anything to do with videotaping when he said it wasn't a vlogging app. I wonder how it will differ from apps like Instagram and Vine, if you are right."
caseyneistat,3ddgn0,Dallow,-3,Wed Jul 15 22:33:42 2015 UTC,I'm not sure why he was so standoff-ish in the beginning while taking a picture with the guy. Not sure if he was joking or not

caseyneistat,3dfyuo,TweetsInCommentsBot,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:36:19 2015 UTC,"Currently, no he does not make money because people are viewing his vlog. At this point his vlog is serving as a creative output and a marketing strategy to help with the launch of beme.   In the past no doubt he's made a profit from some of the videos he has on youtube. I don't think it's something that he could support himself with tho. He used youtube as a soapbox and in turn got hired for work.   He did mention in a video (or tweet?) that he doesn't always make money and he showed one month's total which was pennies I think. I'm sure there's other month's that have a little profit. But the point was the videos he created weren't meant to rake in cash like some people think."
caseyneistat,3dfyuo,grant622,2,Thu Jul 16 01:05:14 2015 UTC,"I believe that his money flow for most of his videos has been sponsors, not ads"
caseyneistat,3dfyuo,dizzi800,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:11:29 2015 UTC,"Ive been going back on forth on this topic in my mind everytime i watch his videos. I noticed something though - he never fails to include a shot of the huge facebook poster in his main workspace. Like why does he have a fucking huge facebook login page poster in so many frames? he must be up to something.  Yes he has proved many times that he doesnt generate cash from youtube, but that totally does not mean he is not making money off his vlogs - he is just NOT making any FROM youtube...."
caseyneistat,3dfyuo,pingpongwithpoo,-2,Fri Jul 17 16:41:24 2015 UTC,"Let's be clear: he is making money and gaining value by publishing ""free"" vlogs.  Are vlogs directly monetized?  No.  How do vlogs earn Casey money?   marketing.  The value of the audience is far greater than YouTube ads. views for commercial ads.  Do you really think that a contract for a ""viral"" ad created by a social media expert won't include payments to Casey for each view it gets?  More people coming to the channel for vlogs, more people watching Nike's ad, more money to Casey.   When you visit Casey's YouTube channel there are commercial advertisements covering his front page.  Nike probably made a term of their contract with him that the ""Make it Count"" video retains prominent position for a certain amount of time after initial publication.  There's no problem with Casey making money off his work... just don't pretend like he isn't simply because some videos aren't monetized while the rest are nothing more than advertisements."

Anyway, I say that, if you like this idea, just do it. Casey will probably do a video/photo sharing that's like any other app but will have some kind of gimmick that will make it look different (as I said probably, I really hope it's better than the rumors and screenshots make it look like). The idea you shared is different and interesting, something that Casey would do but probably won't be that as much as I would like. Would be cool if you or someone that seen this created an app with that propose."

I like Casey and his fairly convincing originality but dont think he is truly that altruistic ... there is always something in it for him: to be the next Zuckerberg; have most successful app ever etc not just about giving an app to the people of the world lol The bottom line is that it is about making money and being more successful than those who went before you.
caseyneistat,3demkd,MorgansButtcrack,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:16:25 2015 UTC,Why wanting his app to succeed and make money with it is a problem?
caseyneistat,3demkd,norlandonos,0,Thu Jul 16 14:45:39 2015 UTC,"A screenshot of Beme  It's definitely dealing with video, but I think it will be more straightforward then your idea. 2million is a big number (for comparison, tumblr initially got only $750000) but I think for such an ambitious idea you'd need more than that.   All of this is not to mention the supposed leaks saying that Beme will be an app that allows users to film short clips and have others respond with videos or pictures, no written comments."

caseyneistat,3d9luz,thestaticbass,5,Tue Jul 14 16:00:33 2015 UTC,So it's snapchat..?
caseyneistat,3d9luz,RemoteControlArtist,6,Tue Jul 14 17:50:40 2015 UTC,In a video from last year from Casey that someone reposted in this sub he talks about what snapchat lacks... my first impression of hearing about the 4 second videos was thinking of the movie Something About Mary where the guy comes out with a knock-off of 7-minute abs workout (his version was 6-minute abs).
caseyneistat,3d9luz,Astrophsx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:27:59 2015 UTC,So basically it's a SnapChat but with peoples responses to it built into it.

If you're asking what type of action is occurring in the screenshot then, yes, it does look like a FaceTime sort of thing going on here.  Edit: But we still can't be sure at all, it's just a picture."
caseyneistat,3d9luz,matteocef,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:42:09 2015 UTC,I lost the passage that said that is from Bemeapp Twitter LOL
caseyneistat,3d9luz,pedroedsousa,-1,Tue Jul 14 16:49:31 2015 UTC,I think it's FaceTime.
caseyneistat,3d9luz,Astrophsx,3,Tue Jul 14 16:21:29 2015 UTC,"It is from the BemeApp. It looks like Casey sent a ""Beme"" out and this was the response sent from someone who viewed it. From the other reddit user that posted yesterday.. Bemes are ~4 second long videos. The people who view your Bemes do not comment or like your Beme, instead they send a response. This response may be another video or selfie or maybe just a photo... but the response probably has to be taken at that moment and not supplied from your saved videos or images.  So the screen shot is showing Casey's view of the responses. Though it is a bit odd that he sees a video feed or is viewing his Beme that he sent out.   Or, You are seeing Casey's camera in the lower right corner because he was sent a Beme and he is sending his response?"
caseyneistat,3d9luz,lilmussels,2,Tue Jul 14 16:46:59 2015 UTC,"This doesn't seem to go along with the idea of Beme being a way to enable people to more easily be creative though. Sending 4 second videos to people isn't anymore creative than sending 10 second snapchats to people. Also, when Snapchat started, the only way to respond to a snapchat was to respond with a video. The chat feature came later."
caseyneistat,3d9luz,waitingforpuberty,2,Tue Jul 14 22:44:14 2015 UTC,"Dude, I saw the app live. This is it. I was highly disappointed as well."
caseyneistat,3d9luz,daBEARS40,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:38:47 2015 UTC,Do you have any proof that you saw it live?
caseyneistat,3d9luz,Astrophsx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:07:51 2015 UTC,What if the whole 4 second theory is just a plain rumour?  Edit: Turns out Vlog 113 seems to solidify the 4 second theory.
caseyneistat,3d9luz,Jestarz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:41:31 2015 UTC,Well it could be a rumor or it could be true. The fact is that its still a beta test and that anything can get tweaked before the rollout. I'm a few years younger than Casey and only have a mild understanding why teens and preteens have been utilizing snapchat more than Facebook. From a business standpoint the more you can get a person to use your app the more money you will make (more ads and more likely you'll get a click on the ad).   Beme could be a way to visually send a message instead of a text or an instant message. By forcing the user to make them 4 seconds they may be more likely to use the app throughout the whole day. I'm assuming with snapchat users make 1 or 2 per day. With Beme Casey may think that users will create more videos by making them shorter and make more responses. It is getting away from telling a story maybe? So it is not a vlog app. It could be an interesting concept if it works. I am really skeptical of the visual design after seeing the logo and in this screen shot with the florescent green. I think this definitely has a younger target audience.
caseyneistat,3d9luz,lileyedmonster,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:52:54 2015 UTC,i have a feeling that the app records your live reaction to something. seeing that you can see casey's camera at the lower right corner.
caseyneistat,3d9luz,thisdesignup,3,Wed Jul 15 13:02:55 2015 UTC,Not really. The reason Instagram and Facebook are still so popular is because responses remain whether you check the app in one hour or one day.
caseyneistat,3d9luz,Drizzle84,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:56:51 2015 UTC,Except Snapchat is extremely popular with tens of millions of users. Enough people clearly don't mind that responses do not last forever.

caseyneistat,3d8tte,Astrophsx,3,Tue Jul 14 15:59:06 2015 UTC,"The ""Neistat"" style is to make things look kind of shitty or grungy like his sunglasses. Maybe it looks more ""hardcore"" this way? lol What they should have done is had a black background and painted the logo with whiteout... kind of like his glasses. They should have done this digitally to enhance the texture. When you see the ""B"" written in white out it instantly reminds you of Casey's sunglasses and then you make the connection."

caseyneistat,3d9hzg,MorgansButtcrack,13,Tue Jul 14 15:33:30 2015 UTC,"If that's true, color me disappointed."
caseyneistat,3d9hzg,harry2caray,2,Tue Jul 14 15:47:04 2015 UTC,"In generally its been hyped so much if it isn't amazing I feel a lot of people will be easily disappointed, me included."
caseyneistat,3d9hzg,SkySouth,2,Wed Jul 15 22:39:57 2015 UTC,This isn't from a beta tester but someone who said they bumped into one in LA. He did point out in one of the vlogs that someone was using the app. I think that the whole idea of the proximity sensor activating recording could be true. The guy in the blog is holding the face of his iphone to his chest and then later you see him holding out his phone recording.
caseyneistat,3d9hzg,Astrophsx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:46:28 2015 UTC,sorry i meant beta tester THREAD that was up yesterday
caseyneistat,3d9hzg,Obie1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:57:55 2015 UTC,Which vlog?
caseyneistat,3d9hzg,Astrophsx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:23:19 2015 UTC,The one where they walk up the stairs and go to the elevated skywalk. Not sure what they call that in NYC.
caseyneistat,3d9hzg,unodo,4,Thu Jul 16 02:57:31 2015 UTC,Imgur Mirror
caseyneistat,3d9hzg,SkySouth,3,Wed Jul 15 10:18:41 2015 UTC,"Well, I think that person has the proximity sensor right, if you watch the blog (with Matt and Casey going to meet the beta testers? I think) Matt consistently has an iPhone to his chest pointing out. No idea on time limits though. I would just put my finger over the proximity sensor to not have it on my chest 😬  Also if you check @BeMeapp on Twitter he released a screenshot naybe 20 minutes after this post."
caseyneistat,3d9hzg,wizardomg,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:45:58 2015 UTC,Also known as the FunForLouis Intro Feature...
caseyneistat,3d9hzg,WhenItsHalfPastFive,3,Wed Jul 15 12:58:58 2015 UTC,"Honest reaction to that: Incredibly disappointed.  What is even the point of that?   Casey talked in the latest vlog about how he was so interested in social media and this is what he always wanted from social media. This?   Just use snapchat.   I really hope if this fails, he doesn't stop vlogging. I hope it doesn't fail, but I also can't see how it can succeed. I just hope he moves on to bigger and better things.  Who knows though, I never would have predicted snapchat would be this big, so Beme might have a shot at that level of success as well."
caseyneistat,3d9hzg,usafooty,2,Wed Jul 15 12:35:05 2015 UTC,"if it fails, he can monetize his blogs and still make a lot of money. Vlogging can be lucrative for people getting the amount of views he gets -- many YouTubers quit their real jobs and focus on vlogging."

caseyneistat,3d9hzg,narrowtux,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:34:47 2015 UTC,Has Casey or anyone from Beme offically released any information about that app?  So many people seem to know everything about beme yet afaik nothing offical has come out.
caseyneistat,3d9hzg,dizzi800,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:58:16 2015 UTC,He said he's going to talk about beme in his vlog this week. So first bit of info might come tomorrow.

caseyneistat,3d9hzg,waitingforpuberty,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:06:09 2015 UTC,So basically the recording is activated by a FunForLouis gesture.
caseyneistat,3d9hzg,elijahharry,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:55:14 2015 UTC,"He honestly seems like a smart dude. His business partner is obviously talented and intelligent as well. I just fail to understand why they wasted so many resources building a Snapchat clone. The app might very well be successful, but it's almost guaranteed that it will fail.   Every single time a new social network comes out and explodes, you systematically have a string of app offering the same features with a couple of tweaks. Storie (the funforlouis app) was a instragram clone. Google tried, and failed numerous times, to emulate Facebook. By building a Snapchat Spin-off, Casey is doing the exact same thing.   I expected much more from Casey."
caseyneistat,3d9hzg,waitingforpuberty,2,Wed Jul 15 23:18:14 2015 UTC,"I talked alot of shit about the app originally, but there has to be something great about it that we don't know about yet.  No way a snapchat clone would raise $2.6 million in VC funding... and if that's the case, must have been a really shitty firm."

caseyneistat,3d0e4d,Astrophsx,4,Sun Jul 12 17:15:02 2015 UTC,That's an awesome idea... Although it might blow up on him even more that way
caseyneistat,3d0e4d,Engr89,11,Sun Jul 12 20:28:32 2015 UTC,I think that he's gotten to a stage where something has to be done. The majority of packages now are sponsored ones from company's who are using him for free advertising. I like seeing fan letters and unique things like the painting that was in the last main time however that majority of stuff seems to be things he has no use for.   It would be cool to see him just give loads of it away at once or else to donate it to charity or sell it off and give the money to charity.
caseyneistat,3d0e4d,bored_lad,21,Sun Jul 12 21:02:07 2015 UTC,Yes he should cancel it. They've become ads.
caseyneistat,3d0e4d,grant622,6,Sun Jul 12 18:57:07 2015 UTC,"It'd be terribly wasteful to keep it going for much longer. You saw the amount of stuff he got in the past week.

caseyneistat,3d0e4d,PM_QUIL0N_SPAM,6,Mon Jul 13 04:05:51 2015 UTC,I do agree that things have got a little out of hand. He should most definitely NOT cancel it though!
caseyneistat,3d0e4d,ttubbster,2,Sun Jul 12 16:22:36 2015 UTC,I have noticed that it has started to become free advertisements for companies.. but it's still my favorite part of the vlog.
caseyneistat,3d0e4d,usafooty,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:37:36 2015 UTC,"I vote for it to be canceled. Casey is rich and he doesn't need random teenagers spending money to buy him snacks and gifts. It's more than one man needs to begin with, and Casey can afford to buy all this stuff for himself. Save your money and donate to a charity.   As for the companies, he should give stuff away to fans who watch the vlogs or stop using it as a segment for companies to promote their (mostly dumb) products. Like, ""oh you flashed the URL to the sock company for 5 seconds? Great ad!"""

caseyneistat,3d0cbu,Astrophsx,2,Sun Jul 12 20:59:41 2015 UTC,From the twitter posts from the beta users it seems like it might be like instagram/snapchat where you can keep your account private and only connect with friends.   From the people asking for an invite it made it seem like one user only wanted to add known friends (though it is unclear if they are allowed to add friends during the beta).

For the longest time, we didn't even know the name of the app and it was being referred to as the ""New Company"". If you want some clues, check out the Jobs page at beme.com.

caseyneistat,3d0cl3,banzski,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:11:44 2015 UTC,Plus buying a new portable camera almost every year. Plus a new iPhone. Plus an Apple Watch. Plus engraving all that with his name even though it could damage the insides.
caseyneistat,3d0cl3,branmuffinzed,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:48:05 2015 UTC,"So that's about $3000, if he bought the latest and greatest and paid full price for the phone. It's also likely that he bought the watch for Beme, and is writing it off in his taxes as a needed development tool.  $3000, btw, isn't a lot to spend on necessary tools when you're a professional. I've spent that on suits for work in one shopping trips. It hurts, but they're necessary for what I'm doing, same as an iPhone, Apple Watch, and a good camera is for Casey."
caseyneistat,3d0cl3,wkfink,0,Mon Jul 13 18:26:36 2015 UTC,"Also, he said he had his computer special ordered, which means it was more expensive."

caseyneistat,3d0cl3,ex-apple,0,Tue Jul 14 18:30:00 2015 UTC,"Hmm, guess I haven't seen that one. In any case, at one point he was a millionaire, and I doubt much has changed. The upside is that I have a feeling he re-invests quite a bit more of his income into creative pursuits than any corporation ever would, so I don't particularly mind him being loaded."
caseyneistat,3d0cl3,saturnhillinger,3,Tue Jul 14 19:25:54 2015 UTC,He has an apartment in Brooklyn? Did this get mentioned in the vlog somewhere? I must've missed it..?
caseyneistat,3d0cl3,are-you-really-sure,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:00:07 2015 UTC,That isn't Brooklyn. It's an apartment in the New York by Gehry building in downtown Manhattan
caseyneistat,3d0cl3,tonyiswonderful,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:06:05 2015 UTC,"There's a chance that I'm wrong, but I was pretty sure the second apartment is also in Manhattan, though, it's close to the Brooklyn Bridge.    I won't say the name of the building - to protect Casey's privacy - but it's expensive, designed by a well-known architect, and home to a famous drummer."
caseyneistat,3d0cl3,josephsrollins,2,Sun Jul 12 15:10:01 2015 UTC,There is an apartment near the Brooklyn bridge which is featured it a recent Ben Brown vlog from the time casey went to the Jeremy Loops show it public knowledge he owns the apartment I think Ben mentioned something about it being used by the company to put people up in when they are visiting for meetings etc. which is extremely common and in which case it wouldn't be Casey's apartment.
caseyneistat,3d0cl3,bored_lad,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:48:11 2015 UTC,"His apartment near Brooklyn isn't actually his. He originally said it's a friends, but more likely, it belongs to the new company."
caseyneistat,3d0cl3,wkfink,7,Sun Jul 12 19:50:54 2015 UTC,"It's absolutely none of my business, but it's obvious Casey has a lot of financial responsibilities...   His studio, office space, apartment, house in Connecticut, and apartment for business clients are all spaces that probably require a monthly rent to be paid, on top of utilities (electricity at the forefront) He has a kid and a baby to care for He has to invest time and his own money into his new company, new tools for his craft, flying for business etc...   Cost of living in NYC is pretty high, and he's able to make frivolous purchases and take expensive vacations.  My guess is that he's pretty well off, but because of the reoccuring expenses, he doesn't have a ton of money left over at the end of the day. The mail time segment has also come to show that Casey gets a ton of shit sent to him every day, and I think that has been going on since before the vlog.    He didn't get into the details of the college fund, and we don't know where Owen is going to college.  Even with tuition aside, there are a ton of expenses that going to college entails.  Maybe Casey doesn't feel that the money he's accrued in Owen's college fund is enough to adequately cover the total expenses of college.    You also have to remember that Candice has a jewelry company that does pretty well.  She might even make more than him.    Anyway, with that being said, I wish he wouldn't have destroyed the Canon camera.  It did make for a badass scene, though."
caseyneistat,3d0cl3,josephsrollins,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:05:47 2015 UTC,"The way he (mis)treats his stuff sometimes bugs me, I mean sure, it must be nice to be able to do that, but I die a little inside every time I see him just chuck something across the room for dramatic effect."
caseyneistat,3d0cl3,saturnhillinger,7,Mon Jul 13 18:23:12 2015 UTC,"You think it is dramatic effect.  Perhaps.  Maybe not.  What is being discussed here is a translation with a whole hell-uva lot of backstory.  His approach to things and life is one also held by his brother, Tom Sachs, and many in the Bricolage lineage.    Watch what people take great care of and you see what they care about.  Neistat protects his time.  He protects his work energy.  He is ultra-careful with the sharing of story and ideas.  Nothing gets in the way of those.  Including tools.  Because at the end of the day ANYTHING can be used to do the telling of a story.    This type of attitude is also seen in the questions he disdains.  In the actions and characteristics that agitate him.  There is a big lesson in there."
caseyneistat,3d0cl3,Ishootshots,3,Sun Jul 12 14:11:37 2015 UTC,But stillllllll... i totally would've taken that faulty canon off of his hands. An axe? Really?

caseyneistat,3d0cl3,Ishootshots,-1,Sun Jul 12 19:04:16 2015 UTC,"It's a $600 piece of shit that was making his job 1000x harder than it should be. Deleted scratch material when you're producing content is pretty much your nightmare scenario, shortly followed by malfunctioning gear.  $400-600 is a lot for people that aren't professionals (ie people that have a career and not a job), but for those of us that have a career, it's something that you can generally write off. I write my suits off on my taxes because they're required for work. Guarantee Casey finds a way to write off his gear, or to have his company pay for it."
caseyneistat,3d0cl3,wkfink,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:14:59 2015 UTC,Perfect way to phrase it.
caseyneistat,3d0cl3,wkfink,-3,Sun Jul 12 19:33:02 2015 UTC,Also he has less expenses than an average person because I highly doubt he is saving for retirement.
caseyneistat,3d0cl3,PM_QUIL0N_SPAM,-1,Mon Jul 13 18:14:40 2015 UTC,"I realize he is rich. (he splurges on hover boards and has multiple houses, lol). However, I was just trying to say something humorous about how he would probably never retire. I am very sorry you did not find it funny.  Edit: Also, I have stated previously that I thought he was worth around 1.5 million dollars."

caseyneistat,3d0cl3,usafooty,4,Mon Jul 13 04:12:21 2015 UTC,He appears to have disposable income as seen by purchasing the hoverboards etc.
caseyneistat,3d0cl3,VeinyPickle,-6,Tue Jul 14 04:15:29 2015 UTC,hoverboard is chump change bub 300-400
caseyneistat,3d0cl3,theneublack,-1,Tue Jul 14 04:25:56 2015 UTC,He said in a vlog it was 200...
caseyneistat,3d0cl3,PM_QUIL0N_SPAM,2,Tue Jul 14 04:29:53 2015 UTC,He didn't pay $200. He used an Amazon link where they were almost $1000. He found the cheaper ones afterward.
caseyneistat,3d0cl3,usafooty,2,Sun Jul 12 12:51:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the amazon one was 600 IIRC. However, didn't he purchase two black ones? I figure those came after he found the hoverboard for 200 bucks."
caseyneistat,3d0cl3,PM_QUIL0N_SPAM,-1,Sun Jul 12 16:49:42 2015 UTC,"200 before hype, then 100+ for an item that weighs 30 lbs shipping from china to the world... do the math  then consider how the prices went up due to supply and demand  clearly you arent too well versed in this area"
caseyneistat,3d0cl3,theneublack,-1,Mon Jul 13 04:12:45 2015 UTC,"I didn't say it was 200, I said that was what Casey said. You can watch the vlog, that is what he says. The title of the vlog even says you can buy one for 200 bucks.   Why are you even on this subreddit if you don't watch his vlogs?"
caseyneistat,3d0cl3,PM_QUIL0N_SPAM,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:16:54 2015 UTC,"What he's saying (though I don't necessarily agree with how severely he's applying it) is that although it was listed for $200 on Alibaba (I think it was Alibaba), the actual cost of purchasing it now is probably different (considering the international shipping price of such a heavy item, the fact that since the exposure by Casey's vlog, demand has increased and price has probably increased, etc). The only way to know is to check the link, but I don't think Casey provided one..."
caseyneistat,3d0cl3,beaverburgular,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:26:54 2015 UTC,"Um, do you watch his vlogs? He bought the hoverboard off Amazon, where it isn't available for $200. He found a cheaper source after he already owned it to share with his viewers."
caseyneistat,3d0cl3,usafooty,-2,Mon Jul 13 05:59:31 2015 UTC,I believe he's only personally purchased a few.  There was a particular mail time installment where somebody sent him a bunch.
caseyneistat,3d0cl3,josephsrollins,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:45:30 2015 UTC,"There were only two in that particular mail time, IIRC."
caseyneistat,3d0cl3,beaverburgular,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:32:58 2015 UTC,And I think he ordered that for the company.
caseyneistat,3d0cl3,markseesred,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:17:44 2015 UTC,He made it very clear that he didn't know where they came from (but didn't explicitly confirm that he wasn't joking or something).
caseyneistat,3d0cl3,beaverburgular,2,Sun Jul 12 19:53:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone is assuming Casey is rich I think it is something we all know however this doesn't mean he has a lot of liquid assets given he has his NYC apartment, house in New London and the second apartment. Then has his studio these would all have a lot of overheards. He also has a young child which is expensive. I'd also guess that a lot of his money has been invested in the new company recently.   He also sold his TV series to HBO with his brother for a couple of million and has been producing and selling ads and videos since before he started YouTube and I also assume he has been producing ads that we haven't seen on his YouTube channel that we may not even know about.   We also know Candice has a lot of independent wealth her jewellery company and we know she comes from money her father I think is a doctor and then have a Ferrari.   From all this we can assume that yes he does have moeny and has a net worth of a couple of million easily."
caseyneistat,3d0cl3,bored_lad,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:27:49 2015 UTC,"Re: Multiple homes...   His house in New London was bought at a very reasonable price (for a person able to afford NYC).  He probably does not have a mortgage on it (I do not know this, but the guess is well within reason).  Perhaps, unlike most folk, he isn't STILL paying for it.    The sale date seems like it was done when he had HBO money.    And NO posting where it is, you know the rules!"

caseyneistat,3d0cl3,eriikbeerg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:58:51 2015 UTC,He's also stated that most of that money he spent when he started doing stuff on YouTube.
caseyneistat,3d0cl3,wkfink,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:12:25 2015 UTC,"I think i remember him saying in the draw my life he sold his HBO series for around $2 million, but then he probably split it with his brother. Also he may not be super rich but he is doing well enough to not run ads before his vlogs. He gets hundreds of thousands of views a day and he can spare earning money to keep the quality of his work really high. In the end we shouldnt worry about what he makes. If he wants to share his wealth let him do it and not try to speculate."

caseyneistat,3d0cl3,jordanjones98,-2,Mon Jul 13 08:33:39 2015 UTC,"One important thing to clarify here, guys: being worth $1.5M is not ""rich"". It's middle class. Think about what goes into that: his house, the stake he has in his company, his car, his studios, his apartment, etc.  He probably doesn't have a ton of available cash, and what he does have goes into making videos, travel, and his new company.  Yes, he axed a $500ish camera. It was a piece of shit and the tool wasn't working and wasting a ton of his time. I can 100% guarantee that he wouldn't do the same with his pro-quality camera (because he hasn't yet, despite how many issues its given him)."
caseyneistat,3d0cl3,wkfink,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:17:42 2015 UTC,Funny how we live in a time where $1.5M is just middle class.  What am I? A peasant?
caseyneistat,3d0cl3,markseesred,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:34:49 2015 UTC,"I think people are missing the point: he doesn't have a $1.5M income. That is definitely in the 1%.

Do you know how much money someone has to have to be able to do that? I'm also pretty sure he drives an Audi or some other super expensive car. He also flies around the world on a regular basis and always first class. Also, he smashed a Canon 7D, which is worth more than $800. ""Middle class"" people don't smash expensive camera equipment for fun -- if they don't like it anymore, they re-sell it. Also, he bought his little hoverboard for like $1000 without thinking about it just because Alfie told him to. Dude is rich."
caseyneistat,3d0cl3,usafooty,2,Tue Jul 14 05:10:39 2015 UTC,"He owns a jeep, not an audi. He regulary gets sent cameras you don't know how much or if he even paid for it.

The Hoverboard was around $800 at the time. I looked. Go back and find the video when he ordered it. False assumption? He lives in Manhattan. He has a personal office in Manhattan.

caseyneistat,3cxkfp,MCKapur,3,Sat Jul 11 17:55:45 2015 UTC,They seem to have picked people in and around Santa Monica / Malibu to test the app. Each is active on twitter/instagram. One of the test users said the app was fun and the concept is was totally different than what they were use to. While Casey does have a lot of fans (22k+ have signed up to follow the BeMe twitter account) it would have to be a concept that people will want to continue to use. So from the little amount that has been put out there about the app it seems like he has created something original... just a matter of time to see if it catches on.

caseyneistat,3cu7np,HaddonH,4,Fri Jul 10 20:35:53 2015 UTC,"You would be surprised at how hard it is to nail a small logo that doesn't conflict with all the sports teams (he cant do blue and orange because of the chicago bears) other companies and what not.   facebook, twitter and skype dropbox and may others are based on light blue, perhaps he would want to get away from all that.   He knows that acid green is harsh, but no doubt he wants something that will stand out on your screen, logos of all companies evolve over time its not like this one in permanent.  For the moment, black on acid green is just beme"

caseyneistat,3ctat3,sergyy,2,Fri Jul 10 21:49:07 2015 UTC,"well, periscope is for live video as far as I know. You can't search for specific activities and it doesn't save videos for later, (or is it?). And periscope is mostly for people with lot of followers and they usually interact with the audience, so, for ordinary people it's basically useless (for creating content)"

caseyneistat,3coi5z,are-you-really-sure,5,Fri Jul 10 06:28:12 2015 UTC,"But it definitely explained why he is hanging out with jerome so much, 1 million SnapChat users in 7 days.  Jerome gets a few %'s of the company to bring in 1M users right off the bat, probably a bargan."
caseyneistat,3coi5z,HaddonH,11,Fri Jul 10 07:09:23 2015 UTC,"My Guess is that the interface will be very much like snapchat without the disappearing content. The video shooting mode will probably have a bunch of options from timelapse to fast forward. You'll also be able to add images/drawing/text to a video. I'm also pretty sure the app will be able to connect to third party devices (go pro, mini cams, google glass)."
caseyneistat,3coi5z,lacrapule,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:01:04 2015 UTC,yeahhh that would make a lot of sense
caseyneistat,3coi5z,hugh9889,2,Thu Jul 9 20:44:05 2015 UTC,I'm also pretty sure the fact that snapchat shifted from 'press to watch' to 'tap to view' caused a big headache for the company. I saw him in the streets the other day and he asked me what I thought of the snapchat update. He told me he wasn't a fan of the update and seemed a little worried. So I'm thinking they're changing the app right now to make it 'tap to view' instead of 'press to watch'
caseyneistat,3coi5z,lacrapule,3,Thu Jul 9 20:50:30 2015 UTC,"Continuation of previous thought. Right now, If you shoot with a camera/go pro you have to import to footage to your computer., Edit it, then upload it. All in all, a long, annoying, and crappy process.   SO, I think beme will allow you to bring content from your wifi enabled cameras seamlessly. And then edit/upload from the app.  Pretty sure you'll also be able to import third-party videos into beme."
caseyneistat,3coi5z,lacrapule,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:00:35 2015 UTC,Pretty sure you'll also be able to import third-party videos into beme.   Yup that would be good
caseyneistat,3coi5z,aidan573,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:05:31 2015 UTC,That sounds exactly like Snapchat but without any of the features Casey himself said made it awesome.

caseyneistat,3coi5z,postposter,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:58:14 2015 UTC,I don't see how the features he integrated into his app can be as groundbreaking as advertised
caseyneistat,3coi5z,lacrapule,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:01:44 2015 UTC,"Oh. I was referring to the Snapchat features that Casey said he liked most.   Yeah, I'm definitely curious but skeptical that Beme will deliver anything as good as the vlog's hype for it."
caseyneistat,3coi5z,postposter,3,Fri Jul 10 02:06:49 2015 UTC,He also squashed the idea that his App will be a vlogging app
caseyneistat,3coi5z,ttubbster,3,Fri Jul 10 02:18:58 2015 UTC,"Haha well if anyone does want a vlogging app I've been working on a little project myself. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.storr.reuben.vlogr feel free to give it a go, its free!"
caseyneistat,3coi5z,addihash,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:27:34 2015 UTC,He might argue that video sharing and vlogging aren't the same. Edit: Remember the video he watched of Frannie on his iWatch? Could be something like that.
caseyneistat,3coi5z,koorb,3,Fri Jul 10 07:48:38 2015 UTC,"But he also said that it's for non experienced people to be able to share stories, so yeahh, probably similar the snapchat"
caseyneistat,3coi5z,hugh9889,2,Fri Jul 10 07:08:32 2015 UTC,I'm sick of these speculation threads. Everything bit of information about the app has been so vague that it could be anything. All we know is it's a video app used to tell stories. The concept as we know it is so broad that it could potentially take a hundred different forms.

I guess I expect that he has come up with an idea that seems so simple and genius you can only wonder why I haven't come up with it myself."

In one of his vlogs I remember seeing a lot of eyewear... i.e. Virtual Reality sets, google glass etc. With the Oculus Rift hitting consumers in Q1 2016, and the probable future of VR, do you think Casey is experimenting with a social media version of VR. Like you said, you'd be able to capture someone else's point of view and share it for others to experience. I'm just not sure how it would connect to phones/smart watches... any help?"

caseyneistat,3cqagd,dazmanc,17,Thu Jul 9 22:29:35 2015 UTC,The $2.6 million or so in funding that he raised wasnt a loan or something that he'll have to pay back. The money came from investors who understood the risk they were taking. Casey doesn't owe them that money back should the app not do well.
caseyneistat,3cqagd,mountainMojo,7,Thu Jul 9 23:02:44 2015 UTC,Most startups fail. Casey and everyone else involved is aware that their startup may in all likelihood fail as well. Its part of the game and they wouldn't have it any other way.  Matt (his co-founder) and Casey both are relatively wealthy from past endeavors so they can afford to take the risk.
caseyneistat,3cqagd,dakry,2,Thu Jul 9 23:12:41 2015 UTC,"I'm rooting for Casey and his new app but this won't be the first time someone has tried a video based app. Shots, storrie, tinny are just a couple of video apps that have failed recently. Maybe Casye will be the one to take it to the next level."
caseyneistat,3cqagd,Pinkman5545,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:20:42 2015 UTC,"One of the main aspects of a social app is well, the social part. I think Casey has that covered and the vlogs helped a lot.

The next largest step is finding a way to monetize the app. Instagram and twitter... people wondered for the longest time how they would be able to make money. The same with craigslist. These are programs used by tons of people but never had ads in place from the start that needed to find a way to integrate ads or some sort of process of making money without losing the interest of its users."

Who knows, maybe he really did find a way to differentiate himself from Snapchat.  Casey seems to have a great intuition for when something will succeed. He called it pretty well when he said he was going to make a viral video with the gold Apple watch.

If I were to guess, you have around 30-60s per video, you capture what you want, edit it in the app, and the app shares it with everyone in the ecosystem. But, honestly, there's not much else what you could do with in terms of video-sharing. It would be basically snapchat with the discover option of Instagram...  Either ways, I'm excited to see what the app is about."
caseyneistat,3cl203,rib9985,5,Wed Jul 8 20:48:10 2015 UTC,"According to his vlog, I think the main focus is on being a tool for creation. Instagram and Vine don't really help with creations. They facilitate the content, and sure there are some things that help with creations (filters, cropping, cutting etc), but it's very shallow.  Sure it might host content too like Instagram, Youtube, Vine, etc, but I'm thinking that that bit will be a smaller focus."
caseyneistat,3cl203,jhuynh405,6,Thu Jul 9 04:56:59 2015 UTC,There's also an app called Storie that does exactly what you described. I hope it's something more.  http://www.storie.com/

caseyneistat,3cl203,rib9985,6,Wed Jul 8 23:51:40 2015 UTC,"He knows the person who made this application because he has been featured in his vlogs. I am sure that what he has in mind is much different than any of the existing social media platforms. I mean, he has the VP of Engineering at Tumblr so something has to be different."
caseyneistat,3cl203,kidfood,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:21:25 2015 UTC,"Probably not it, but Snapchat with Instagram discoverability is what the world needs."
caseyneistat,3cl203,merterdir,6,Sat Jul 11 00:33:32 2015 UTC,"Not sure if anyone watched the video where Casey speaks about his idea of the hierarchy of creativity, but he said that what he is creating with his company is a tool for others to be creative. So from this I would assume that the app/tool that they are developing will not necessarily be a platform for people to share their creations - as plenty such platforms already exist -  but most likely a set of tools to create audiovisual content.   We can only speculate what functions these tools will fulfill. The app could be an all-in-one suite for video capture, editing, and uploading to various social media.  Anyone got more ideas?"

Firm believers that less is always more, we're designing a product that aims to be ruggedly simple.  http://beme.com/jobs.html"
