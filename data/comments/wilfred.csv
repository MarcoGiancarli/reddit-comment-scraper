wilfred,3e2ttp,Bryce_Carmony,3,Tue Jul 21 15:04:37 2015 UTC,"3 camps. You gotta realize the point of the show was for Ryan to start asking the real questions, to find happiness instead of buggin about shit that just doesn't fucking matter. Just throw it away."
wilfred,3e2ttp,classysocks,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:00:02 2015 UTC,"I like to think that the original Wilfred was real, and that he drove Ryan insane over time. Ryan started recreating Wilfred in his dreams, in his drug trip, in his EMDR trance, and eventually reached the point (after Wilfred died) that he could recreate him entirely in a waking state. But I'm not naive enough to think the writers intended that. I think they just decided at the start of season 4 that Ryan was insane and didn't check it for consistency."
wilfred,3e2ttp,Splatchy,2,Tue Jul 21 17:53:59 2015 UTC,"I agree that the writers committed to the insane path once they knew the show was cancelled after season 4, they could have done a ""no one knows"" ending but I feel that would have been a betrayal to the fans. Having a definitive answer was a gesture of respect for sure. The moral of the story I took away is that happiness is self contained and not externally gained."
wilfred,3dypw9,ChoralesAndCruisants,6,Mon Jul 20 16:50:58 2015 UTC,Interesting theory. I saw it more as Ryan forcing the world to meet his half-remembered dogma (hehe-- dog puns!) but I really enjoy the idea that there was some magic all along.
wilfred,3dypw9,Saith_Cassus,5,Mon Jul 20 23:16:10 2015 UTC,"I just don't get why people think Wilfred failed.  The way we see Jenna, she really isn't an attractive person... she flirted with the guy to get him to do nice things for her even though she wasn't interested, she cheated on her boyfriend (twice apparently), and ... I just don't get why Ryan was so into her. I don't think he would have been happy with her because he wasn't able to be himself around her - Wilfred taught him to love himself & not sacrifice your character for someone else."
wilfred,3dypw9,sickduck22,3,Tue Jul 21 03:15:18 2015 UTC,"Yes!  I've been thinking this all along.  I found myself attracted to the exact same type of girl (flirtatious, bubbly, very attractive, didn't know what she wanted, even blonde lel) so I know how it goes.  Wilfred did what he was supposed to do.  Getting with Jenna was not the end result.  It was figuring out who she was, thus learning she wasn't the same person.  Good lesson that you sometimes don't want what you think you want at the end of the day when all is uncovered."
wilfred,3dypw9,sa-steve-va,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:39:59 2015 UTC,"I think the arc had to happen faster than intended with the 4th season being the final but I don't think Jenna with Ryan was ever going to happen, the moral of the story is that happiness comes from inside and is a choice, the ever after of ""he got the girl so he was happy"" wasn't apart of that moral. All the characters are a mix of good and bad, none of them are heroes or villains, that's what made the show such a nuanced treat."

In a post ""Lost"" world viewers have built walls around letting a mysterious suspense string them along for seasons at a time. I fell off after season 2 largely because of the fear, I only returned once the series was completed."
wilfred,3dpups,whatarewaves,22,Sat Jul 18 07:40:22 2015 UTC,"Wilfred honestly changed my life. The depth, the lessons it gave, and the perspective it shined on different key things in society changed my view on the world itself. Each episode taught a different lesson in a way that could give us a deeper understanding of that specific thing, the most important of which is happiness. In each episode, the title was something that Ryan learned about, and in every single case Wilfred was the one to teach him that lesson. After learning so much about how to live, by the end of the show, the plan was for Ryan to ultimately tie everything together and understand the most important thing of all: happiness. Happiness was the topic of two different episodes, but honestly, it was the theme of the whole show, it was the one true lesson to be learned above all. During the third and fourth seasons, Ryan starts to really question who Wilfred is and what he might be, and through time, he comes up with these wild theories, from aliens, to Gods, to cults, and gets so deep into these that he forgets to use Wilfred to find happiness like before. In the first episode, the thing Wilfred teaches Ryan is to ""just throw the ball."" Stop worrying about minor things, stop thinking about your problems for a minute, and just throw the ball. And in the last scene we see Ryan pick up the tennis ball, and without saying it, that's what it meant. Through all those ridiculous theories, sometimes you have to take a step back and just find acceptance. Sometimes you have to stop wondering about what you may never know, and just throw the ball. Now everything I just said you probably already know, but I think it's deeper than that. I think Wilfred was intended to be a metaphor for the meaning of life, or just life itself. Most of us can agree that life is defined beyond the walls of intelligence, it can't be understood by the human mind. If we were given the answer, it would be incomprehensible. The questions we asked are too complex to have answers we can understand. That's what Wilfred is. All in all, Ryan never finds out what Wilfred is exactly. Just like Ryan came up with crazy theories as to what Wilfred is, we come up with crazy theories as to what life is. Take a look at Greek Mythology. Back then, people pondered whether or not the sun was the wheels of a giant chariot. It made sense at the time because of their lack of technology and progress over time, and humans have an unmatched sense of curiosity. Ryan believed for a minute, even though it was just a minute, that Wilfred was an alien. He also believed that he was in purgatory the whole time for a minute. He also dreamed that he was a subject for a social experiment and that his entire life was an act. He comes up with these things because of the human sense of curiosity. The most logical explanation in the end is that Wilfred is just a figment of Ryan's imagination and that's it, but there are holes in that, like the hippo that Wilfred knew about. And there are also unanswered questions like why Ryan's mother saw a Wilfred-like creature in her cat, Mittens. Honestly, no answer makes complete sense, just like our theories about life. Nothing we come up with makes 100% sense to us, because we can't answer it. We'll think ourselves to death if we keep worrying about the questions that can't be solved, just like Ryan's life falls apart when he begins to search for the answers. In the end, we have to learn to just stop trying to think about it, and just throw the ball. Because as demonstrated in the show with how Wilfred gave Ryan happiness at certain times and brought him back from depression, if we live life the way it takes us, and learn from the lessons it teaches us, that is the only way we can find true happiness."
wilfred,3dpups,TucsonIsOkayIGuess,3,Sat Jul 18 08:33:43 2015 UTC,"Really well put! The elusivness of a singular ""theory of Wilfred"" pretty much mirrors the complexity of the interpretations of life.

We were so worn out at the end of those days all we could do is watch TV. It was the only time we really spent together, and it was incredibly important to me.

That's what we came to conclusion? When Ryan opened the closet there wasn't a basement. Was he just in his closet talking to Wilfred the entire time?   The second to last episode (episode 8 I believe) I think the series could have just ended with Wilfred and Ryan underneath the house. That was a pretty good scene. I think it would have left a lot of questions in answered but I like stories like that."

wilfred,3c2bsi,VivereInSomnis,3,Thu Jul 9 02:57:04 2015 UTC,"Since Bruce and Wilfred were both figments of Ryan's mind, they could each communicate with each other. This goes a little more into theory, but his early memories buried in his subconscious could have formed the basis for the games Wilfred and Bruce have for Ryan's sanity, since Bruce (or Krungel) played by Shane at the compound and Wilfred (or Mataman) played by the other guy whose name escapes me now had opposing ceremonies that played along with the personalities of the gods they played, which mirrors the games they play. The same explanation goes for the other 2 questions as well: Wilfred was essentially the way Ryan was able to open his mind to his hidden memories of the cult. I think he didn't want to tell his dad about Wilfred because he didn't want him to relapse or to feel guilty about causing Ryan problems later in life with his cult. I hope this helps!"

When I was younger and there was a chance of people like me getting offworld, only two lots of lifters were available, USAlien and Russian, more accurately Soviet. The USAliens didn't look like they would ever lift anyone foreign, not even if you became a naturalised American Citizen and even thinking about going Soviet was blasphemy, heresy, treasonous and grounds for being considered a loon. So I gave up on me being a Starman and got on with having a life. I eventually became too old, unfit and useless to be considered as prime astronaut material (or, to be fair, UNprime astronaut material) then the USAliens and Russians decided to give aliens rides on their toys. Just when it was too late it became possible. Typical, yes? The only way I'd get to the Moon or Mars now is if I were picked at random in some sort of lottery for a one-way ""suicide"" mission. I would go. I would not hesitate. Here, Luna, Mars or the moon of a gas giant orbiting Rigel, the Reaper is supposed to get us all eventually so I'd go.  If aliens invaded, I'd be the first to ""borrow"" one of their ships. If I didn't get trampled in the crowd of fifty million others with the same hunger. :) NASA keeps planning for a return trip to places like Mars and Saturn. If they hired weird little critters like me they could save a ton of money, fuel and time.  And there are millions like me. Some still young enough to be viable candidates ...

wilfred,39tnme,gregthesneakymexican,4,Sun Jun 14 18:44:48 2015 UTC,There's no definite answer. While there are very strong arguments for the fakeness of the basement there is no guarantee that it is real or fake.
wilfred,39tnme,Nichase,-4,Sun Jun 14 22:05:38 2015 UTC,"Sure there is. And it's pretty damn obvious. No, the basement is not real."
wilfred,39tnme,Soperos,3,Sun Jun 21 16:11:23 2015 UTC,"There's evidence for and against. Like in one of the earlier seasons (when Jenna and Drew are getting married in the back yard), you see Ryan looking out the windows of the basement at Jenna. There's also the doors leading to it from the exterior shots of the house.  ¬†  On the other hand, in another episode, as Ryan was coming down the stairs, you could see a hanger bar right in front of the door.  ¬†  tl;dr: Doesn't matter. This is a fantastic show."
wilfred,39tnme,noahfischel,3,Thu Jul 2 05:38:11 2015 UTC,Not a answer but something small I noticed... It always seems like the sun is shining the same way when he's down there. Especially in season 4 it's always directly behind the couch.
wilfred,39tnme,w00tix,2,Sat Jul 18 15:40:25 2015 UTC,"This may just be me being confused by american houses, but don't we see Ryan and Wilfred in the crawlspace at one point? Surely that means no basement, right?"
wilfred,39tnme,moghapurisa,2,Thu Jun 18 14:01:45 2015 UTC,When do we see them in a crawl space?
wilfred,39tnme,Soperos,3,Sun Jun 21 16:11:54 2015 UTC,Ryan tells Wilfred he had sex with Jenna. I think that's in the second to last episode of the series.
wilfred,39tnme,Ostrichmen,2,Sun Jun 21 23:18:23 2015 UTC,Are you sure it was a crawl space? I remember him telling him that but don't recall the crawl space.
wilfred,39tnme,Soperos,3,Sun Jun 21 23:53:39 2015 UTC,"Yup! Just binged the last few episodes today. I couldn't tell you, however, if the crawl space led below just the deck, or the whole house"
wilfred,39tnme,Ostrichmen,3,Mon Jun 22 00:59:36 2015 UTC,"Hahaha dude. I love that we are being assholes in one thread but civil in this one. Didn't even notice you were the same person.   As for your post, I can't believe I never picked  up on that. That seems like pretty solid evidence in favor of the ""basement is fake"" side of the argument. What do you think?"
wilfred,39tnme,Soperos,2,Mon Jun 22 01:58:46 2015 UTC,"lolfuq I always thought that the basement was fake. I think it was kind of given away in S4E3, there was a scene where Ryan was exiting the door and it showed a closet. I also just thought it was after the end of season 1."
wilfred,39tnme,Ostrichmen,2,Mon Jun 22 03:36:36 2015 UTC,Yeah I've always thought it was fake too. I honestly never got how people thought it was real since there was never anything normal going on down there.
wilfred,39tnme,Soperos,3,Mon Jun 22 11:16:58 2015 UTC,"Wait, why wouldnt the basement be real? I've finished the show, so no spoiler for me."

wilfred,3976zf,10ilikepie0000,28,Tue Jun 9 19:20:14 2015 UTC,"Bruce is imaginary, Wilfred is just a dog. Ryan's real father created these ""dog gods"" years earlier, and they stayed in Ryan's subconscious (along with the people who dressed up and played them) which is why he and Ryan had similar delusions.    The basement might be real. I think the point they were making by being ambiguous is that it doesn't matter if the basement is real or not, because whatever's behind that door that nobody else can see (either a closet or a basement) only exists in Ryan's head if Wilfred only exists in Ryan's head.    The tennis ball is a callback to the first episode (and earlier episodes in general). Personally I think it's symbolic of happiness; at the beginning Wilfred uses throwing the ball to teach Ryan about pursuing happiness, which is what the entire series has been about. At the end Ryan has accepted his insanity, let go of the girl he obsessed about and solved the mysteries that were plaguing him. He finds the tennis ball because finally, he is happy."
wilfred,3976zf,Splatchy,2,Tue Jun 9 20:18:38 2015 UTC,I thought the tennis ball was more of a callback to the season 1 finale/season 2 opener when the basement door was a closet

wilfred,3976zf,Soperos,0,Sun Jun 21 16:09:17 2015 UTC,"He wasnt blackmailing him. His ""dad"" was paying off his real dad to stay away from ryan."

wilfred,3976zf,bazoner,2,Tue Jun 9 20:06:09 2015 UTC,"I believe the tennis ball is symbolic of Ryan's sanity because in the first episode Wilfred tells Ryan "" why don't you stop playing ball with them and start playing ball with me"" he says this while holding the tennis ball then he chucks it when Ryan asks "" aren't you going to go get it"" Wilfred says ehhh I've got plenty of balls. And as the show progresses whenever Ryan's sanity seems the most fragile the ball is there for example when he opens the basement door and its just a closet that a tennis ball rolls out of, or when he sees Wilfred the dog for the last time and then of course in the season finale."
wilfred,3976zf,Klotzilla,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:27:14 2015 UTC,But how did he know exactly how they looked. He was able to pick them from pictures he never seen before and when he was the cult he was like 1-2 he would never be able to remember them.

That's why Wilfred, at the end of the finale, brings up all the weird memories from Ryan's childhood that he couldn't remember. It's there, I'm Ryan's head, but he can't get to it.

wilfred,38btov,I_just_watched_kpop,2,Thu Jun 4 01:12:25 2015 UTC,It's not a comedy. Very few funny things happen. There aren't very many funny situations. It's a drama in which the main characters are a suicidal stoner and a talking dog. It's kind of an absurdist drama.

I do think Ryan imagined the conversation in the alleyway, afterall he imagined an entire level in his house. The reason I believe Spencer's friend didnt call the authorities or anything like that is because before his death, Spencer told him Ryan used to be a lawyer. The two of them entered Ryan's house uninvited, so Ryan would of had an easy home invasion/self defense claim and the friend didnt want to end up in jail by reporting anything."
wilfred,37pbbr,h_aqeel,19,Fri May 29 09:48:48 2015 UTC,"There's no similarity between the Australian and American versions other than that Jason Gann is in it and he wears a dog costume. The character of Wilfred isn't this mysterious manipulative being that throws down life lessons, he's more like a spoilt teenager that hates his new step-dad, and there's no mystery element to it (he's just definitely real). I'd say it's darker but at the same time sillier. I do recommend it but there's no reason you'd like the Australian version just because you liked the American version"
wilfred,37pbbr,Splatchy,9,Fri May 29 14:16:14 2015 UTC,"I actually watched it before the American one was made, I thought it was great. It's definitely different, and the humor is much more Australian, but I love it just the same."
wilfred,37pbbr,spike9012,5,Fri May 29 13:54:20 2015 UTC,"YES. It is my favorite show of all time. u/Splatchy is oversimplifying Wilfred's character. He is definitely mysterious, and it is alluded to several times that Adam might be insane. I would also say that Wilfred is MUCH sillier in the American version. He also sounds unnatural when you can tell he's changing the way he speaks to be more palatable to Americans. It's only 16 episodes, and ends on a total cliffhanger. I've watched each episode countless times, and still notice new things."

A big part of the overarching plot line is whether or not the closet is real. Why give it away like 5 episodes beforehand, but only make the reveal very difficult to find? Makes no sense from the creator's point-of-view."

wilfred,37ijee,GrizzledSage,6,Wed May 27 21:58:39 2015 UTC,I second the Australian version (it also has Jason Gann as Wilfred!) but I'd also like to mention that Jason Gann and Elijah Wood have both said that they'd like to make a movie as well. If that ever happens it could be awesome.
wilfred,37ijee,bub166,3,Thu May 28 07:10:19 2015 UTC,"Oh man I certainly hope that Elijah Wood and Jason Gann do that movie together, that would be awesome, they act well together. I will probably try to watch the Australian version."
wilfred,37ijee,bub166,2,Fri May 29 03:17:56 2015 UTC,"I just started it and the first episode doesn't quite have me hooked the same way the American version's pilot did. But I'm about to watch more tonight, so I'll see how it goes!"
wilfred,37ijee,bub166,2,Fri May 29 03:28:34 2015 UTC,"Is it on Hulu or the internet somewhere, that I can watch."
wilfred,37ijee,bub166,2,Fri May 29 03:46:32 2015 UTC,"I found it on www.merdb.ag, but it's one of those sketchy sites with mirrors to streams. Works well for me but it depends on how willing to do that you are."
wilfred,37ijee,bub166,2,Fri May 29 04:24:02 2015 UTC,"I'll try it, and if I don't like, I do believe that the complete series at least the Australian version is only like $20 on amazon, and then $20 dollars per season for the American version. I don't know though I really, really loved this show. Intelligent, great writing, and fantastic acting."
wilfred,37ijee,ZadocPaet,2,Fri May 29 07:00:29 2015 UTC,"Yep, it's probably my favorite show of all time. Parks and Recreation and Futurama are up there but Wilfred takes the cake for me I think."
wilfred,37ijee,CupcakeUnicorn,3,Fri May 29 17:22:14 2015 UTC,I agree Wilfred takes the cake for me as well too. Up there for me though is Bojack Horseman is probably my second favorite show.

wilfred,36gos8,plethorashooawayyhoe,20,Tue May 19 06:37:59 2015 UTC,I dont think the basement ever existed for a multitude of reasons but one easy one is in the first season when kristen was shocked and confused when ryan mentioned he had a basement.
wilfred,36gos8,Schreibdaddy,4,Tue May 19 15:54:51 2015 UTC,yeah that makes sence. and the fact that who would have a basement door in their bedroom??
wilfred,36gos8,Schreibdaddy,4,Wed May 20 02:28:38 2015 UTC,"pretty sure the door was in the living room around the corner from the kitchen but i could be wrong, next to the sairwell"
wilfred,36gos8,samzplourde,4,Thu May 21 16:07:57 2015 UTC,"also ill just post this here instead of making a new thread..but..   omg the 1st minute of season 4 episode 8 is so hilarious to me... from the 1 armed charleston bees knees dance, him going ""YEAHH! RYAN AND BIG STUMP GOING TO THE VET TOGETHAHHHHH!"" and that damn walk he does when they're walking down the sidewalk.... lmao damn this show was hilarious."
wilfred,36gos8,Nichase,5,Wed May 20 02:32:13 2015 UTC,"The closet is the stairwell really, its just covered up by a fake closet at some point. I'm not sure if that was in his head or not though."
wilfred,36gos8,samzplourde,10,Tue May 19 07:06:42 2015 UTC,"It was never covered up by a fake closet. There closet isn't real and Ryan using the sledgehammer to break into the basement is symbolic of Ryan going insane (ie, he's breaking down his mental barriers)"
wilfred,36gos8,pi00pi00,2,Tue May 19 19:13:48 2015 UTC,There's probably different ways to interpret it.
wilfred,36b2u8,Bushmagnolia,17,Sun May 17 22:46:04 2015 UTC,It's definitely her left arm bro.
wilfred,36b2u8,canismellyodick,7,Mon May 18 02:33:13 2015 UTC,Jennas oddly positioned hand.  Probably covering up her boobies.w
wilfred,36b2u8,zebrahead110,13,Mon May 18 07:27:44 2015 UTC,"I see 4 hands, wheres the other?"
wilfred,36b2u8,Gre3nArr0w,3,Sun May 17 22:51:15 2015 UTC,Check the hand covering his hand at the bottom.
wilfred,36b2u8,tomwithanh,19,Sun May 17 22:54:10 2015 UTC,"Its her left hand. It isn't under him, its scrunched up between them."
wilfred,36b2u8,Gre3nArr0w,0,Sun May 17 22:54:47 2015 UTC,It looks like a man's hand when it's playing.
wilfred,36b2u8,JamacanPenguin,6,Sun May 17 22:55:34 2015 UTC,Theres only 4 hands in this scene. I don't know where you are getting a 5th from.
wilfred,36b2u8,Pinguh,2,Sun May 17 22:57:02 2015 UTC,"When it's playing it doesn't seem like either of their hands, for some reason but I'm probably wrong."

wilfred,36b2u8,Banshee90,1 point,Mon May 18 03:26:53 2015 UTC,How can it be positioned  they are both under the covers right.  If it was her hand it would have to be coming from Elijah woods ass
wilfred,36b2u8,OffsetFred,1 point,Mon May 25 13:13:30 2015 UTC,Her arm is around him.
wilfred,36b2u8,JTMrKC23,1 point,Tue May 26 04:40:46 2015 UTC,not unless she  has a 6' long arm it isn't. Look at her right arm sure its a bit slack but it doesn't even cross his entire back. The left arm couldn't be going around his entire body then touching his hand.

wilfred,36312b,redditor-for-2-hours,3,Sat May 16 01:35:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah...if you think about it, his mental illness put an actual dog (and, baby) in harm's way on multiple occasions. That's almost more sad and scary, especially since he decides upon instead of getting help for his mental illness, embracing it to make him feel happy while it still has control over him."
wilfred,36312b,Craig,11,Sun May 24 00:47:51 2015 UTC,"It gets better, man.   The story can certainly seem sad, but the show, viewed as a work of art, has significant merit and we were lucky enough to be able to watch it unfurl.

wilfred,36312b,pawling11,5,Fri May 15 20:49:17 2015 UTC,"You're right! I laughed so many times during the show, I mean it was funny and raunchy and all kinds of messed up during certain scenes and that made it all the more worth it."

He's mindlessly loyal, gets a bit too into it when there's competition, always cheerful, and always happy to see everyone and everything. Oh, and he's a massive idiot, but that's ok and we love him in spite of it."
wilfred,35wvxu,Saith_Cassus,8,Fri May 15 00:57:40 2015 UTC,I definitely agree with the dog/Drew comparison (I didn't even notice you mentioned it too until after I posted my comment)!

I thought he was such a sweetheart (being competitive is like the least terrible thing someone can be in the grand scheme of things)... actually, he was like the human embodiment of a dog. Loving, innocent, with absolutely no clue about the reality of what was going on around him. He really did love Jenna - and that makes me feel like even he was too good for her. There were so many scenes where he was just sad about them fighting, or her being upset with him. He really liked Ryan, too. I think he considered him a best friend. So yeah. I enjoyed his character a lot too."

When he takes his mom on a roadtrip away from the mental facility, that's him escaping with her. Ryan's Boss, like Amanda, was another character he pulled from the hospital. He killed himself because he was suicidal."

wilfred,354qbg,NotTheCartel,21,Thu May 7 02:18:37 2015 UTC,"The basement was just one of Ryans delusions. It didn't really exist (this is hinted at as early as s01e08, when Ryan mentions the basement to Kristen and she says something like ""the basement??""). No reason to believe it was heaven really, at least not with the way I interpreted the show.   The guy in the suit was part of the cult Ryans dad formed. Ryan's visualization of the dog wilfred as a human was based subconsciously on the man from the album, because that man played Mattamon, the good god. ""Bruce"" also was in those photos, he was a member of the cult that played the bad God krungle. The man that looked like Bruce who was blackmailing Henry was the actual ""Bruce"", but of course he had aged.   When Ryan saw wilfred take off the suit, he was under the influence of an experimental drug which apparently was meant to bring one's worst fears to life. In that sequence, Kristen was also shown to be in on whatever wilfred was up to. His greatest fear was that wilfred was actually real and he was in some sort of Truman show situation.   Wilfred claims to have found the symbol after posting something on reddit (can't remember what about) so I'd say in reality Ryan posted on reddit and somebody sent him back that.   The meaning of the show? Hard to say really, something about making your own happiness.   Cool things: in the pilot, wilfred says ""you and I are one mind"", revealing the basic dynamic of their relationship from the start (that is, that wilfred is just Ryans imagination, not his own entity). That's about the only one I can think of off the top of my head"
wilfred,354qbg,Keegan320,7,Thu May 7 03:54:12 2015 UTC,"I just finished the show and went back to the first episode immediately afterwards to understand the meaning of the ball. The first quote of the episode is ""Sanity and happiness are an impossible combination"". My interpretation is that in the end, he accepted himself which is true happiness."
wilfred,354qbg,madspam,1 point,Sun May 10 23:38:37 2015 UTC,I know that wilfred was based on the guy in the cult but how is it that he thought up wilfred's face far before he saw the guy in the photo album.
wilfred,354qbg,Keegan320,14,Thu May 7 04:11:23 2015 UTC,"Ryan lived at the cult from birth to 2-3 years old. The origin inspiration for ""wilfred"" was that guy, so wilfred had that guy's face. Ryan only remembered it subconsciously."
wilfred,354qbg,Cookiesoverther,6,Thu May 7 04:18:59 2015 UTC,Krungel (and Bruce) are explained the same way. The native american guide that was shot by Wilfred on Ryan's drug trip was also on one of the pictures.

wilfred,354qbg,greasywiener,10,Sat May 9 04:21:36 2015 UTC,How she just skipped out on Ryan after she already said that she loved him too.  I was frothing at the mouth with rage.
wilfred,354qbg,Jai-this-is-great,2,Mon May 11 15:28:22 2015 UTC,"I wish he would have fought for her more. When drew showed up, he should have suspected that Jenna, with her being in the fragile state she was in, might go back to him. If he had come out about their relationship to Drew, not let Drew stay with Jenna, and had been the one to comfort Jenna when Wilfred died, maybe he would have gotten the girl. But he was just so much of a god damn pushover, he practically handed Jenna to drew"
wilfred,354qbg,dragonfangxl,11,Tue May 12 06:19:41 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  I don't think anyone you have to ""fight for"" deserves you in the first place.  If Jenna had been worth Ryan's time he wouldn't have needed to fight for her, she would have been loyal to him."
wilfred,354qbg,kickinwayne45,4,Thu May 14 04:44:41 2015 UTC,"but he did suspect it to happen, Wilfred was telling him all the time to do something..."
wilfred,354qbg,versaceblues,2,Thu May 14 00:57:37 2015 UTC,"Well he either didnt believe it, or he didnt care."
wilfred,354qbg,madspam,5,Thu May 14 04:50:28 2015 UTC,The end message seemed to be indulge your delusions as long as they make you happy. I can't say I jive with that sentiment. Still processing tho.
wilfred,354qbg,kickinwayne45,10,Thu May 7 16:50:24 2015 UTC,"Thats not really what it was though. It was more along the lines of, happiness can only come from within yourself. Ryan uses wilfred as a way to communicate with his own mind, which many people can't do. They dont listen to themselves, they try to find happiness as defined by other people.... but never actually being truly happy (like Jenna and Drew).   I think him accepting that Wilfred was real, was more of a metaphor for how every should learn to accept their true selves."
wilfred,354qbg,ZenZenji,2,Sun May 10 08:15:53 2015 UTC,"""Sanity and happiness are an impossible combination"" - this was the quote in the very first episode. I think the end message is to accept yourself to be happy."

wilfred,354qbg,ZenZenji,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:18:16 2015 UTC,"Well, I think that that lesson wasn't universal. It applied to Ryan because Ryan realized himself that wilfred really was trying to help him out for the most part (Ryan was a much better adjusted person in the finale than the pilot), and his delusions (probably?) never actually harmed anybody. Those things can't be said of all delusional people"
wilfred,354qbg,BigCommieMachine,2,Thu May 7 23:05:12 2015 UTC,Just finished the last episode today. I cant stress that last line enough. Fuck Jenna
wilfred,354qbg,duckdude87,4,Tue May 12 06:17:26 2015 UTC,I swear that second to last episode was on another level of sadness.  When I first started watching the show it was the last place I expected to find such feels.
wilfred,35134d,Goku_Goes_Crazy,3,Wed May 6 05:44:35 2015 UTC,"Funny enough, they specifically said they didn't know what was causing Ryan to see Wilfred until the end of season 3.   But I agree, amazing show. Sad to see it go."
wilfred,35134d,Soperos,3,Wed May 6 21:59:05 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter whether wilfred was a god or imaginary. And the ending could have signified either. He led Ryan to happiness. Ryan was the only one who could see him. The only difference is whether he was an external or internal entity. Either way, as we've always known, Ryan has always been talking to a dog. Those scenes were hard to watch, but we should have known that that was how it looked to everyone else. It's not like that was a huge revelation."
wilfred,35134d,maninthedarkroom,3,Thu May 7 02:12:09 2015 UTC,"I guess.. I think it matters.   If Ryan had a psychotic break it brings some things into question. Did he kill Jellybeans? Did he try to electrocute Kristen and her boss in her pool? Did he set Jenna's house on fire? If not, how on earth did a regular dog happen to do all those things?  Also, if he did have a psychotic break (which I believe he did) it certainly explains the fact that no one ever reacted to him sitting having long conversations with a dog. The conversations were more likely happening in his head. But then you can also say it was ALL happening in his head. I just find that to be a cop out.   But hey, that's really what makes this show so great (for me) is it's been a year, and still when I see one of these topics pop up in my feed it makes me think."

Dogs can't do that shit, even if they're gods. I was in as much denial as ryan the whole time, but now I feel dumb for every thinking something different."

wilfred,35134d,maninthedarkroom,1 point,Thu May 7 23:43:25 2015 UTC,"I dunno, hes obviously shown he can make events happen in his mind, maybe much of the show just took place in his head. I was expecting them to reveal he killed himself and everything, even the neat little explanation was just a dream of a dying man, but that never happened."

With this ending, and in general an amazing last season, combined with 3 other amazing seasons, I really just think it has become a rare gem, and a really, really fucking great series. I'm both happy that they stopped after four series, but also quite sad that it's over. And the revelation in episode 9, of how Wilfred really loooked was just so fucking beautiful."
wilfred,34y2yb,Chewy453,12,Tue May 5 14:51:44 2015 UTC,"Maybe the real Wilfred could actually tell that they were dying, and he imaged imaginary Wilfred killing them lol"

wilfred,34wem1,fantabrew,6,Tue May 5 02:49:16 2015 UTC,Assumably there's a different actor in LOST. In a tv show you can usually assume the actors playing characters don't exist unless otherwise stipulated.
wilfred,34wem1,Nichase,2,Tue May 5 03:05:47 2015 UTC,"And for tv shows or movies the actors would have been in, there's an actor of equal merit with a different name and appearance than the correlating actor. Ie, there would be a different guy playing Frodo, similar enough but distinct in name and apperance.   This is just nitpicking."
wilfred,34wem1,Nichase,2,Tue May 5 03:06:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get what you're saying,  I just thought if he could see someone and recognize him as Robin Williams from goodwill hunting then maybe it wasn't totally insane."
wilfred,34wem1,Nichase,3,Tue May 5 03:11:00 2015 UTC,Memory of the episode's a bit hazy but wasn't the part with Robin Williams a dream sequence? It was Ryan in the dream trying to wake himself up.

He was 9 in s3 and 7 in s1 so I assume he was about 10 at the end of s4 and that's about how long dogs live (especially big ones). Also, usually dogs have health problems before dying of old age, and lung cancer isn't that rare in dogs, my last dog just died of it in 2013.  Ryan didn't kill his dog"

You can go with coincidence, since his dream while similar to what happened was still different enough that it could've been a coincidence, or you can say that in the universe of the show premonition dreams aren't that rare, or you could say Ryan retroactively added details to his dream to make himself think it was a premonition."

Well, the thing with 3 Wilfreds was probably just a weird memory from when he lived in the cult and it caused him to remember the location, then he runs into the 3 kids in costume. It's not really him predicting anything, it was his dream stirring up old memories. I can't explain the part about his father's death, which is much more important. Anybody have any ideas? It's a pretty big coincidence.... Then again I don't know how much time had passed between his premonition and his father's death."

Not only because the episode he first comes in is called Doubt, but Bruce is the only other one that really knows Wilfred, and can make Ryan believe that he's not the only one that can see him. So Bruce is the part of Ryans mind trying to convince himself that he's not crazy."

wilfred,345snw,phantom2052,32,Tue Apr 28 15:06:59 2015 UTC,That ''I failed you'' scene is actually hard for me to watch. There's so much love for Ryan in Wilfred's heart.  Side note: Drew is kind of douchy but he is a great guy who only ever wanted a loving wife (Jenna) and a friend (Ryan). Give him a break. I actually came to really like him by the end.

And it's never definitively proven that Ryan is crazy, just hinted at (remember when his dad said he takes dozens of pharmaceuticals a day? Maybe Ryan's dad is just the crazy one and not Ryan). Ryan realized that he didn't need Jenna to be happy and that Jenna and Drew obviously had their own issues. And Kristin?

wilfred,345snw,Saith_Cassus,5,Tue Apr 28 21:29:37 2015 UTC,Amanda shows us Ryan's other option. If Ryan decided that Wilfred was a mostly negative impact he could have ended up like Amanda. Did Amanda seem happy when Ryan saw her? It didn't look like it to me but at the same time she seemed to be making progress so I guess she plays a similar role to Ryan's father.

She still had work ahead of her, certainly, but she had a better grip on her life, and knew enough to know what would and would not work for her, as evidenced by her pushing Ryan away despite the fact that she clearly wanted him in her life (similar to how Ryan will always want Jenna in his, but has to accept that she isn't good for him).

wilfred,3444d1,Soperos,3,Tue Apr 28 23:58:31 2015 UTC,so ryan framed that black lady in the old people's home and that led to her suicide too?
wilfred,3444d1,ShreksBrother,2,Wed Apr 29 01:21:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, notice they didn't show that one in the flashback did they? Lol."
wilfred,343bwy,The_Pag_Man,31,Mon Apr 27 23:47:44 2015 UTC,"I was probably more upset than I should have been about the two actor changes. I lost some of the immersion I felt with this series, it just seemed wrong having to see a couple of the characters differently :(. But maybe thats just me."
wilfred,343bwy,Capwonder,10,Tue Apr 28 01:47:08 2015 UTC,"I felt the same, hated the recast."
wilfred,343bwy,metalfacedbongman,9,Tue Apr 28 05:13:09 2015 UTC,Not as bad as the Bruce recast. Dwight Yoakam had something about him that X Baldwin didn't.
wilfred,343bwy,Soperos,21,Sun May 3 22:46:37 2015 UTC,IIRC Mary Steenburgen had other projects going on at the time this season was being filmed.  ...So she got a cleanse.
wilfred,343bwy,iDontDoMeth,4,Tue Apr 28 00:46:01 2015 UTC,Thanks!
wilfred,343bwy,Imgodnigga,4,Tue Apr 28 01:09:36 2015 UTC,Yea I saw her on Last Man on Earth on FOX don't know if that was the reason or not... Still like her character on that TV show though check it out if you like comedy
wilfred,343bwy,lemons230,21,Tue Apr 28 05:20:10 2015 UTC,"Fun fact!   When Ryan is tripping out after that doctor tests a drug on him,  he enters a pure white room. On the wall is a picture of every actor on the show.  The pictures of Bruce and Ryans mom have an X through them suggesting the recast."
wilfred,343bwy,thr3lilbirds,11,Wed Apr 29 21:00:27 2015 UTC,"I was just happy the show actually acknowledge it. Wilfred says something along of lines of ""Ryan your mom looks great. Did she do a cleanse?""  I don't like the new actress because May steenburgen is hilarious and those are big shoes to fill."
wilfred,343bwy,joeprunz420,10,Mon May 4 02:03:38 2015 UTC,The actress was doing other stuff. Bullshit to me that they couldn't get her in for a few days of filming... I'm sure there was a money issue on top of everything else.   Absolutely HATED the actor switches.
wilfred,344hgx,EvasivePickle,5,Tue Apr 28 05:53:34 2015 UTC,"I think a ridiculously-specific-delusion-bringing genetic condition is less likely than something like schizophrenia with certain delusions inspired by one guy's dog god delusion based religion which they were all involved in, but yeah. Interesting."
wilfred,33z6li,Keegsta,37,Mon Apr 27 00:38:39 2015 UTC,"Jenna wasn't just boring. She was selfish, indecisive and disregardful of everyone else but her. Manipulates Ryan into doing things she wants to without giving anything back. Uses Ryan as a friend when she needs to but ignores him when he doesn't. Strikes up a relationship with him and then drops it in a second.   There is literally nothing in the series showing that she even slightly cares about anyone but herself."
wilfred,33z6li,Nichase,30,Mon Apr 27 01:29:26 2015 UTC,"She even straight up told Ryan one episode that she had been using him. I'm so glad that he basically told her to fuck off in the end. He realized that he didn't need anyone but himselfandWilfred to be happy. ""Sanity and happiness are an impossible combination"" -Mark Twain."
wilfred,33z6li,itisnotmybirthday,20,Mon Apr 27 02:44:01 2015 UTC,There was a saying when the show ended a last year.  Wilfred is love  Wilfred is life  Jenna is bitch.
wilfred,33z6li,Nichase,16,Mon Apr 27 02:58:26 2015 UTC,She couldn't handle her edibles either.
wilfred,33z6li,zewski,16,Mon Apr 27 05:07:17 2015 UTC,"I think Amanda may have been the most important secondary character in the whole series. If you really look into her character theres a lot of parallels between her and Ryan, some stark differences from Jenna, and even some similarities to Wilfred."
wilfred,33z6li,samzplourde,10,Mon Apr 27 01:16:35 2015 UTC,That's kind of the point isn't it? Jenna was never supposed to be who Ryan ended up with. We knew that forever but Ryan had to figure it out.
wilfred,33z6li,Deandalecc,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:25:13 2015 UTC,"I agree, it's just that she's too boring. After getting to know her pretty well over four years he doesn't see what I figured out in their first conversation, it's just unbelievable. But maybe that's just me, I would never date a woman like Jenna."
wilfred,33z6li,Deandalecc,14,Mon Apr 27 04:05:48 2015 UTC,"Well. Ryan is smitten, not in love. The difference is that he confused his hormonal reaction to her looks and behavior with real feelings. It happens all the time to people in high school but occasionally with adults as well."
wilfred,33z6li,Akronite14,4,Mon Apr 27 04:12:37 2015 UTC,He even says he was in love with a fantasy to her face.
wilfred,33z6li,Soperos,6,Wed May 20 00:04:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, she was almost like a regular person or something."
wilfred,33z6li,noobucantbeat,4,Sun May 3 22:45:50 2015 UTC,I really liked Amanda she was really cool and hot af honestly
wilfred,33vwro,chinsil,18,Sun Apr 26 03:25:28 2015 UTC,Yeah it is. Ryan's dad goes on to say that Richard used to play the role of Matamon during the cult rituals. That's why Ryan sees Wilfred with Richard's face.
wilfred,33vwro,Gogohax,10,Sun Apr 26 03:34:57 2015 UTC,But he saw Wilfred before he saw Richard. Or did he somehow remember Richard's face from infancy?
wilfred,33vwro,DUBYATOO,19,Sun Apr 26 04:00:19 2015 UTC,It's assumed that Ryan subconsciously associated Richard with Matamon from experiences as a young child in the cult. Then projected his face onto Wilfred.
wilfred,33vwro,done_holding_back,12,Sun Apr 26 04:53:07 2015 UTC,"Remember the episode where Ryan was drugged and saw Wilfred take off his costume?  I could be reaching, but I saw this as a cross between Ryan's real life and some repressed memory where he witnessed Richard being chewed out (remember his father saying he was an asshole?) then disrobing in front of a mirror while little Ryan hid in a pile of clothes.  I think Ryan remembers a good chunk of the cult and just repressed it, and his psychotic break re-introduced it to him."
wilfred,33s4p9,itisnotmybirthday,28,Sat Apr 25 02:25:33 2015 UTC,"I just finished it today and I actually liked it. It was all about self-acceptance. Ryan realizes he doesn't need Jenna, or his father, or even the answers to his past to find happiness. All Ryan needed was to accept himself, to accept that Wilfred is a part of himself that he loves. Really bittersweet the way they wrapped the whole thing up but goddamn it hit me in the feels."
wilfred,33s4p9,freakyvoiz,18,Sat Apr 25 02:34:38 2015 UTC,"The quote from the first episode decribes it perfectly: ‚ÄúSanity and happiness are an impossible combination.‚Äù ‚Äì Mark Twain. Without being insane, Ryan could never truly be happy. There's still a part of me though that wishes Ryan had killed himself. It sounds terrible but I feel like it would've wrapped the show up better than ending it with Ryan and Wilfred on a couch on a beach. I completely get the whole self-acceptance thing too. I always wanted Ryan and Jenna to end up together but I'm glad they didn't."
wilfred,33s4p9,freakyvoiz,12,Sat Apr 25 02:41:02 2015 UTC,I'm rewatching the first season again with this new found clarity.
wilfred,33s4p9,whateverusername123,6,Sat Apr 25 02:46:13 2015 UTC,I plan on doing the same thing after the fourth season really sinks in.
wilfred,33s4p9,AdamDe27,7,Sat Apr 25 03:14:26 2015 UTC,"I didn't really want Ryan and Jenna to end up together, especially towards the end, but I'm glad that they ended up together for a little bit so that Ryan could experience what it was like to be with her and get what he wanted (or at least what he think he wanted) for once.  I'm glad they didn't end up together, but I think I would have felt kind of sad if they never did, no matter how short the time."
wilfred,33s4p9,T4blespoon,5,Sat Apr 25 07:54:13 2015 UTC,"Not only am I glad they didn't end up together, I'm glad he finally told her to go fuck herself.  God that felt so good."
wilfred,33s4p9,misfitchronicles,8,Sun Apr 26 17:36:28 2015 UTC,"I believe it's conveying a message. That the world does not need to match our expectations and it can still be okay. At least something in that ballpark. Like one of those movies where it's not quite a happy ending but it's okay because the main character is okay with it. I also think you may feel your emotions were toyed with because I think they were trying to make the audience feel the way Ryan did a lot of the time, let down and confused only for everything to be not the way he thought it was."
wilfred,33rpfi,almeidaalajoel,11,Fri Apr 24 23:53:46 2015 UTC,I didn't think it was supposed to be a secret
wilfred,33rpfi,cheer4lyfetotally,13,Sat Apr 25 03:51:09 2015 UTC,"I agree, but there were some points where I started to question if maybe Wilfred was a magical being."
wilfred,33rpfi,Paintingfish,3,Sat Apr 25 05:55:11 2015 UTC,"Are they mutually exclusive? Can't Wilfred be both a magical being and in Ryan's head, i.e. it's Ryan's head that's ""magical""?"
wilfred,33rpfi,cheer4lyfetotally,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:26:58 2015 UTC,"I guess it's technically not impossible, but there's not much of a reason to believe that there's anything more to it than Ryan being delusional"
wilfred,33rpfi,Keegan320,6,Thu May 7 03:56:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think they were trying to eliminate the possibility that Wilfred was all in his head, but I do think they were trying to make you wonder what the truth really was, with that as one possibility."
wilfred,33rpfi,cheer4lyfetotally,2,Sat Apr 25 07:17:02 2015 UTC,I just feel that it was never a question of whether Wilfred was all in his head. The question was why
wilfred,33rpfi,pi00pi00,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:27:29 2015 UTC,The story was told out of Ryans perspective and since he denied having mental problems like his mother and turned a blind eye on any clues thats the way the viewer sees it too.
wilfred,33rpfi,Keegan320,2,Mon May 25 08:32:24 2015 UTC,"For a while there on this sub it seemed like it was. Everyone was arguing whether wilfred was Mattamon or krungle and I was reading it going ""Uh, I don't know what the cult has to do with anything yet, but wilfred is a hallucination...""   Edit: yeah seriously, just take a look around this sub. Even recently, a large portion of the posts claim that wilfred has to be real on some level"
wilfred,33su9q,whateverusername123,3,Sat Apr 25 07:43:36 2015 UTC,"Is there some question about whether or not Ryan died? I never picked up on that.   Regardless, you can take your whole post and delete ""Heaven"" and you've just explained what actually happened on the show."
wilfred,33su9q,MannaFromEvan,-1,Sat Apr 25 20:10:24 2015 UTC,"I think that there are a fair number of people who think that Ryan really died in the first episode.  It's touched upon in the show a bit when Ryan asks Wilfred if the basement is really Heaven.  And yeah, pretty much in any scenario the show is Ryan learning how to be happy, my explanation was more of a how/why."
wilfred,33rcbc,Donutsarelove,12,Fri Apr 24 21:54:41 2015 UTC,I think the best part about the ending was how open to interpretation it is.  So maybe he was a magical being the whole time who led Ryan to happiness by having him accept himself for who he is.
wilfred,33rcbc,The_Ostrich_Guy,5,Sat Apr 25 04:04:12 2015 UTC,hmm never thought of it that way
wilfred,33rcbc,MannaFromEvan,5,Sat Apr 25 05:00:24 2015 UTC,"Of course ""who he really is"" is a crazy person who spends weeks on end locked in a closet smoking weed with a dog."
wilfred,33rcbc,DialMforMuffins,6,Sat Apr 25 20:13:03 2015 UTC,"I know, right?! I'm in huge denial with Wilfred not being a magical being or Ryan having a special gift or something. It's like you feel the need to redeem Ryan from being just crazy as a redemption for yourself for feeling so identified with him(?)   But I really liked how they wrapped it up showing us that everybody else was also so fucked up in their own ways, but trying to do their best to be happy (even his dad! -profuse crying-)."
wilfred,33rcbc,bisexualwizard,5,Sun Apr 26 11:35:28 2015 UTC,"Like shit, for all this time I've been identifying and empathizing with some crazy guy who spends his days slowly killing a regular dog with pot smoke in a closet. Is that OK?"
wilfred,33rcbc,Soperos,3,Wed Apr 29 01:52:18 2015 UTC,"It's tough to digest. You want him to be a magical being, but there's no good explanation for that. I always felt ""If they say it's all in his head that's so lazy"", but looking back I can't see any better ending/resolution than what we got."
wilfred,33oqr4,The-MeroMero-Cabron,17,Fri Apr 24 06:54:53 2015 UTC,Boom.
wilfred,33oqr4,billiambobby,8,Fri Apr 24 21:25:31 2015 UTC,Fuckin' A for finding (or making) this!!
wilfred,33oqr4,whitesquare,8,Fri Apr 24 23:11:14 2015 UTC,"I love Calvin & Hobbes. Certainly has its similarities.   It's also kind of similar to Harvey, a story about a drunky-poo who has a 6' tall walking rabbit friend that he imagines. I believe it's originally a play but it's been made into a movie or you can find a screenplay of it. It's older, probably 1930s or 1940s I would guess, but still a great story."
wilfred,33oqr4,zebrahead110,10,Fri Apr 24 12:26:08 2015 UTC,Pretty sure its one of elijah woods favorite films
wilfred,33oqr4,JackDanielsBFF,6,Fri Apr 24 13:52:05 2015 UTC,It's one of the reasons he wanted to do Wilfred actually.

wilfred,33hjll,DaceyMormont,5,Wed Apr 22 16:00:24 2015 UTC,It's his insanity. David Z. said that that episode was inconsequential (which is honestly a bit disappointing. I agree with you.)
wilfred,33hjll,maninthedarkroom,3,Wed Apr 22 18:23:25 2015 UTC,A clone of the dog Wilfred. The anthropomorphized(sp?) version is Ryan's psychosis.

wilfred,33fx70,teewuane,10,Wed Apr 22 04:53:08 2015 UTC,Noooo. Of course not /u/teewuane. How the hell could you even think that?  Although the old lady he definitely killed her.
wilfred,33fx70,GSV-Culture,5,Wed Apr 22 06:00:51 2015 UTC,"That you, Wilfred?  Motive: That lady accused Ryan of stealing drugs from the drug closet and hated Ryan and Wilfred from the beginning.  Theory: Ryan/Wilfred did not like that so Ryan/Wilfred wrote a suicide note stating she had been stealing the drugs then killed her by taking her to the roof and pushing her off.  Wilfred was there when it happened. It's hard to tell but I think that means Ryan was there. Also, another thought, Wilfred was supposedly good at detecting when people were ""on their way out"". So maybe that's why he was up there. And Ryan really didn't do it?  Right before it happened Ryan was questioning ""how the hell he got there"" and was very confused/high. To me that suggests he had just been somewhere else or was having a ""fight club""-like moment. Then he ran straight to the roof where Wilfred was waiting. Like he was returning to the scene.  I think that's enough to wonder what really happened there.  But then again, maybe that lady had started stealing/abusing drugs when she lost her family to the earthquake. That's why the hospice director (Rashida Jones) said she hadn't been the same since then.  Another thing, after Wilfred broke into that room, I don't recall that lady ever being in the scene again until she was falling off the building. Maybe Ryan was hallucinating and seeing her as Wilfred?"
wilfred,33fx70,mordiksplz,3,Wed Apr 22 06:36:47 2015 UTC,"It was pouring out when the woman fell off the roof, and Ryan wasn't wet until we saw him go outside."
wilfred,33fx70,linkman0596,7,Sat May 23 17:42:14 2015 UTC,"I dont think he did.  One of the big things that keeps you thinking this isn't a mental illness throughout the show is there often seems to be proof that Ryan is actually able to see his future (the three people in dog costumes chasing him, his father's death, his injuries in the second episode).  While I don't think he actually is able to see the future, having the same part of his mind that created Wilfred being that good at putting stuff like this together, as well as his delusions keeping him from noticing certain things with his conscious mind explains most of it."
wilfred,33fx70,Rosco09,2,Wed Apr 22 16:21:45 2015 UTC,"I think if you think of the show as ""watching the show"" vs ""watching the show as Ryan sees it"". any of the predictions can be framed as Ryan convincing himself he had a premonition about it. Timeframe doesnt matter if we are taking the ""watching the show as Ryan sees it"" way, because you can convince yourself things happened out of order or place things in the middle of a timeline."

Wilfred loses his leg and is happy about it and Jenna says that shes never seen wilfred more depressed. There are tons of examples of this happening. I think everyone is too busy assuming that Ryan is crazy.   I don't think he is in the way everyone imagines him to be. I think he's crazy in a different way. His mom and dad both see their pets talk to them (Krungle, Mittens). So either the writers left out a ton of unanswered questions leaving us to fill in the blanks or they planned it all out.   How does Ryan find out about Krungle before he met his real father?   Who the fuck is Mittens? Is mittens just a confirmation of the finale? Or is it possible theyre all actually chosen?   Is it possible the gods chose crazy people and everything isn't actually bullshit? Maybe Ryan is the chosen one and only those 3 can see the gods for a reason.   How does Ryan imagine Wilfred and Bruce as real people? The folks in the album are identical to what Ryan imagines. Even if its repressed memories he was an infant the last time he saw those folks. He doesn't even remember the incident with his uncle until Wilfred mentions it."

Edit: Ok so I kind of get it. Bruce and Wilfred  look like the people who acted out Mattdamon and Krungle. So it is all in his head and it's just repressed memories from his childhood at the cult. He just remembers the guy acting out Mattdamon and the guy acting out Krungle and through some sort of disorder or something (schizophrenia?) he hallucinates them or something. It's still kind of confusing to me though. So he's crazy but he doesn't care because being with Wilfred makes him happy? He'd rather be crazy and happy than spend the rest of his life in the mad house and be sane? I don't know I'm still a bit confused."

I agree with you though - eventually you realize he's actually a nice guy and being a bro all by itself isn't inherently bad, just associated with certain bad qualities. Though there are some things just about his rough and tumble personality that some people might not like, e.g. when going camping all he could talk about was kicking over ant hills, struck me as weird.

wilfred,3391b3,teewuane,5,Tue Apr 21 00:40:30 2015 UTC,He's a good guy. Never was a dick. I imagine most people have a friend like him. I think Wilfred just said that he was a dick because Ryan was jealous.
wilfred,3391b3,versaceblues,3,Wed Apr 22 05:21:11 2015 UTC,"Wilfred was Ryan's subconscious though. Ryan liked Jenna, so his subconscious perception of Drew was that he was a dick. But as we get to know him better, that perception changes"

When he was inside the mental hospital, someone told him he ""spent all his time smoking with his dog in the closet of his apartment."" This begs the question is the basement really real or was it just a closet. Furthermore, does he actually live in a house or does he rent an apartment?"
wilfred,32r6k3,read_harder,4,Thu Apr 16 08:13:47 2015 UTC,I didn't even notice the apartment part. That's weird to think about

I don't know why else he would react that way if it were a basement.  Still, odd to give us that reaction with no real closure via a shot of the closet/basement."
wilfred,32r6k3,object_on_my_desk,11,Fri Apr 17 03:08:38 2015 UTC,"It really depends on your view of it, maybe there was a basement or maybe there wasn't."

wilfred,32r6k3,Hvatning,2,Mon Apr 20 22:11:55 2015 UTC,Sorry to be commenting this late but I don't think it matters if it was a basement or a closet. Ryan's reaction was rather ambiguous and I think that was the intention.

wilfred,32odcu,The6thNightmare,13,Wed Apr 15 12:15:48 2015 UTC,Honestly my favorite thing about the ending to Wilfred is how open to interpretation it is. You could argue a fairly good case for any number of possible conclusions and I think they're all mostly valid. Just depends how you see it.
wilfred,32odcu,bub166,13,Wed Apr 15 15:38:45 2015 UTC,"I mean, for me, I don't like the idea that he offed himself, because I don't think that it fits thematically with the series. The previous four seasons were about growth and coming to terms with how everyone else's idea of happiness isn't necessarily your idea of happiness. Ryan yearned for that white picket fence and being ""normal,"" but ultimately found happiness in existing outside of society and being crazy, just as his sister found more happiness aborting babies than she ever did delivering them. The point I saw was that life is weird, and that you find happiness that works for you-- everyone else's opinions don't matter next to yours."
wilfred,32odcu,Saith_Cassus,13,Wed Apr 15 22:32:24 2015 UTC,"First episode of the series has the quote:""Sanity and happiness are an impossible combination."" This quote is fulfilled in the last episode. He realizes that he is insane and that Wilfred isn't ""real"" but he knows that being with Wilfred is what makes him happy. He gives in and stops fighting. He is willing to live a life of insanity knowing full well he is fucked up but at the same time being happy. And that is the major theme of the series."
wilfred,32odcu,DriveMyCar191,6,Fri Apr 17 05:43:21 2015 UTC,"I think this theme also goes along with Ryan's mother finding happiness, saying ""my fourth leg was my sanity"""

wilfred,32q1od,Saith_Cassus,7,Wed Apr 15 22:47:50 2015 UTC,"He found happiness in life. It wasn't what everyone else might define as happiness. Hell, to the outside observer, he seems as crazy as they come. But he found a way to be comfortable with himself and the world around him. Wilfred is gone, but he also realizes that so much of Wilfred's personality lived in him from the start. Sure, Wilfred's physical body is gone, but the happy, kind-of-a-complete-asshole dog he hung out with is always going to be with him.   To kill himself over the sad times in his life would be a permanent solution to a temporary problem."
wilfred,32q1od,Saith_Cassus,2,Thu Apr 16 02:47:19 2015 UTC,"You make some good points but to say that it was a temporary problem is not necessarily true (in his life) as he himself stated that he did not believe happiness is a sustainable feeling, which I tend to agree with"
wilfred,32q1od,Giraffesarecool123,7,Thu Apr 16 03:04:50 2015 UTC,"That's the thing-- I agree with you. nothing is sustainable-- happiness or misery. Each eventually gives way to the other, and you have to weather the bad times to make it to more good ones.   I've given my thoughts on Jenna's role in the series before, but I believe that she serves to show how you can't be happy unless you're willing to endure some unhappiness. The series shows her reasonably ok for the most part-- never really happy, but never really unhappy-- because she isn't willing to take risks. She's sith Drew because he's safe. When she loses him, she instantly goes to Ryan rather than feel sad. When Wilfred passes, rather than mourn she embraces the brand new puppy overnight.   Contrast this with Ryan and how he spends most of the series miserable, but really gets to know himself in the process. Because of going through those difficult experiences, he comes out stronger and with a newfound knowledge of what happiness means to him-- even if that's just sitting on the couch with his imaginary friend."
wilfred,32q1od,wearOrRust,4,Thu Apr 16 03:24:24 2015 UTC,Wow yeah he learned so much from Wilfred it would have all been wasted if he ended it. Thank you! So much happier now.
wilfred,32q1od,conspost,-1,Thu Apr 16 03:30:53 2015 UTC,Wait what? Why are you sad that he learned to accept himself? It would have been way sadder if he killed himself. I don't understand.
wilfred,32ixb9,clitpic,16,Tue Apr 14 03:53:23 2015 UTC,Wilfred farted...
wilfred,32ixb9,thekotoz,13,Tue Apr 14 23:26:09 2015 UTC,"Agh, no. He squints and sees the tennis ball in the water. ""What is that?"" ""I think that's a question you can answer for yourself"" (we can interpret the ball however we want)  Earlier on, he basically farts and then blames it on wilfred, using it as an excuse to bring him back."
wilfred,32ixb9,maninthedarkroom,9,Wed Apr 15 04:25:30 2015 UTC,"I think the denouement is alluding back to the scene where Ryan and Wilfred first reunite after Wilfred dies.  They are walking through a world based on the picture they saw in the basement earlier.  The tennis ball serves two purposes in this scene.  As Wilfred produces the tennis ball he tells Ryan to stop thinking so much.  And then as he opts out of the game of catch, he tells Ryan ""I'm good"" as Ryan goes to mechanically (thoughtlessly) continue the game. This is to be understood by the audience to mean more than just ""I'm ok with ending this game"" but also ""I'm at peace with having died"".   I think you can read into this scene as much as you want.  It fits with the metaphysical surrealism of the show.  It would also seem to touch upon some of the broad themes of the show (e.g. any episode title, any cognitive behavioral concept)  In the final episode the ball returns to Ryan (as if in a metaphysical version of catch) and while I don't think any conclusion is being definitively displayed here, I think one reasonable interpretation is that the ocean is producing this ball, perhaps to incite Ryan to stop thinking/mourning, or in just a more ambiguous interpretation, to suggest he play catch.    However, if this were the case, I think a lot more could have been done throughout the series to make 'catch' a more central motif.  Catch has a lot of potential as a metaphor.  Could have done a myth of sisyphus thing with it."

wilfred,32ixb9,maninthedarkroom,9,Fri Apr 17 12:22:48 2015 UTC,"Elijah Wood said in an interview that after he read the script for the finale, he thought that Ryan was dead. But David Zuckerman said that wasn't his idea for it but they left the ending to be interpreted how the viewer feels it should."
wilfred,32ixb9,thebaddest125,10,Tue Apr 14 16:56:16 2015 UTC,Originally I thought he was dead to but now I think he's just lost his mind and is locked in his closet. But that he keeps commenting on a bad smell reinforces my theory that's he's withering away in the closet.   I think it's pretty crazy that a lot of ppl are ok with the idea that he found happiness by embracing his insanity. It's like when we watched his shenanigans with Wilfred and were entertained while also in denial that Wilfred was in fact a dog. When they did the montage of Ryan and Wilfred the dog it was horrifying. Just like the image of him in his closet talking to the ghost of a dog is incredibly sad.
wilfred,32ixb9,wearOrRust,5,Tue Apr 14 17:24:03 2015 UTC,"Originally I thought he was dead to but now I think he's just lost his mind and is locked in his closet.   The more I think about this the more I think they did a great job ending a unique series, because they really did leave it just open enough to think about without being all trippy just for the sake of it.  But I do think they actually rule out him just going crazy in his closet. I think that's actually the point of the quick ""huh"" when he looks in there, and we don't even get to see if the basement exists: he's not being controlled by these delusions anymore. Maybe he's stabilized and knows what they are, so now he can see Wilfred without it running his life. Or, maybe the action he finally stood up and took was for him to kill himself.  Either waythe closet/basement wouldn't matter anymore. That's why it gets just a simple ""huh"" when earlier in the series the same question was actually the cliff hanger."

My own conclusion was that Ryan came to terms that Wilfred was simply an extension of his own subconscious, projected onto Wilfred. Just because Wilfred died doesn't mean Ryan's subconscious did. So basically when Wilfred farted and Ryan smelled it, that means Ryan was really the one who farted. So he can answer the question himself."

Is it a tale of the effects of schizophrenia of life and the effects of life on schizophrenia, or is it bigger and more mystical?  There are more than enough things that point out the improbable, keep in mind I haven't watched the show since it was on TV, but the last episode didn't record so I had to wait until it came on netflix   The elephant toy in the Wilfred Clone episode? Wilfreds actions correlating with more complex human issues His real dad and mom just happening to know everything that happened - but attributing it to mental illness   to be honest - I think this is a show that more questions the idea of mental illness than one that is directly about it.   PLUS, my theory actually has some basis is recent science - my ideas are not fiction.   Again - I refuse to believe in the ""100% insanity copout"" as much I refuse to believe that ""being insane is more likely""  I like to think, as viewers, we are more intelligent than making those basic assumptions."
wilfred,32i23m,Keegan320,1 point,Tue Apr 14 01:10:00 2015 UTC,"He literally addresses this in the episode. Wilfred says ""What if you bought it on the way here and buried it so you could find it?"" .  This suggests that the story we see isn't necessarily what actually happens, but what Ryan believes happens.  Ryan retroactively alters his memory to make wilfred seem intelligent. The first example of this is in season 1 when Ryan pulls out a tooth and wilfred says ""that doesn't happen until later"". In reality, after he lost the tooth, he imagined that wilfred had predicted it earlier.  I'm not sure I understand. They didn't know anything they shouldn't have, they just knew of the cult, because that actually happened. But it's more likely that his real dad was also insane and ryan's schizophrenia manifested in the form of a traumatic childhood, than that his real dad actually discovered a god dog and fathered the chosen one.    I'm not sure how your  ""Wilfred is a God"" theory has ""basis in recent science"".

What if Wilfred is a form of consciousness that extends from the ""universal conscious"" and interacts with Ryan and Wilfred (the real dog) in a mental way - using both their bodies and Ryans mind as mediums to communicate and pass on his message  Thats a simple version of the ""he could still be a god theory""  3 has to do with everyone knowing so much about things Ryans experienced - even though none of them talked about it and Ryan hasn't been part of it since he was at most 2.5 years old, but likely younger, and unable to remember the faces/meanings behind the religion  Everything matches up too nicely at the end for me to just take the insanity cop-out"

wilfred,32i23m,Soperos,6,Sun May 17 23:27:06 2015 UTC,"I agree and think Wilfred is real for a number of different reasons.   First and foremost, Wilfred is beneficial. If all Wilfred did was be selfish and act as the personification of Ryan's inner voice always wanting this, or manipulating to get that, I would be on the crazy train. But Wilfred always leads Ryan through rough waters by mirroring his own behavior in such a way that Ryan eventually realizes he is wrong and Wilfred is right, and Ryan is better for it. That's not how mental illness works.  The cult guy in the shed told Ryan's mom he was dead so that she would move on. Wilfred did the same thing to Ryan. If he stuck around Ryan would stagnate. And by planting the idea that Ryan is just a crazy person he doubled down on Ryan moving on so that Ryan would not fixate on some weird cult worshipping of Wilfred the god.  I'm not quite sure why so many are latching on to the fight club ending. It's obvious and could be seen from miles away, and I have more faith in the writers than that.  Whether or not he is actually a god of some sort is up for debate. But whatever he is, he's more than just Tyler Durden in a dog suit."

Fantastic - I agree. Mental illness must be an illness. What is it if you have skitzhphrenia but it doesn't get in the way of life? What if it helps you find answers to questions? What if it helps mediate your actions and desires? TBH even if my theories are wrong - Wilfred DOES exist - just only from the perspective of Ryan. One does not need a physical body to exist. Just as our dreams are likely universes - Wilfred exists as part of Ryan."
wilfred,32i23m,Soperos,4,Tue Apr 14 19:02:12 2015 UTC,"I find it hard to believe he can pull that much continuity from the first 2 years of his life, recreating specific faces based off the roles they played in ""recreations.""   Wilfred, which I believe is the personification of Ryan's insanity, exists in Ryan's brain. In the season finale he was able to access the repressed memory about Ryan's uncle by accident. If Wilfred is able to casually and accidentally stroll into repressed memories, it's not at all a stretch to imagine that Ryan's insanity - the personification of which is Wilfred - can access memories from EARLY early childhood."
wilfred,32i23m,Heratio_Cornblower,3,Thu Apr 16 03:48:37 2015 UTC,"Thats good, thanks. If that is true - and assuming theories about dream-universes and all that mumbo jumbo and stuff we just don't understand the spirit realms/dimensions/universal conscious are true then Wilfred DOES exist as a being higher than fiction but less than reality - using conscious and the body of a dog as a medium. I think even with the insane theory my theory works, and so far I like my theory so Ima keep believing it :)"
wilfred,32i23m,OriginalUsername30,3,Thu Apr 16 17:33:20 2015 UTC,"I believe the ending is that Ryan is crazy, and I wanted that ending, so I'm happy with it.   But I think it's fun to toy with the idea that Wilfred was real. I made a similar post the other day about Wilfred really being a dog god, and how depressing that would be if it's real. Because if that were the case, it would mean the Wilfred we originally knew was really a dog god, but he died. Then Ryan started hallucinating him out of grief and a feeling of not being important. Which explains why he had such a rapid personality change. The Wilfred Ryan concocted in his head, during the short time he was there, was very friendly which is the total opposite of how he really was."

Did he get Jellybeans to run in front of a car? Although in season 1 they were less careful about making sure it was possible for Wilfred to be imaginary. Ryan can't have killed Ruby, for instance, because he was downstairs when she jumped/fell off the roof."
wilfred,32htjv,Splatchy,4,Mon Apr 13 23:05:34 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I just noticed that Ryan was the only one in the room with her (besides Wilfred) for at least a few minutes before she died. Rewatching the show knowing that Wilfred was only ever just a dog, made it seem like it could have been Ryan who smothered her, thinking it was Wilfred."

Wilfred joked about it a few times (Lost, Battlestar Galactica) and David Zuckerman even said at Comic-Con ""50% of you are going to hate where we're going with this"" (or something similar). But that doesn't matter, it's about the ride. I thought season 4 was very disappointing, I thought it sacrificed the show's great dynamic to make way for a lot of uninteresting cult background that turned out to be pointless anyway. But I won't let that ruin the show for me. The first 3 seasons are still some of the best TV I've ever seen and I can appreciate what they were going for with that ending. I guess if you need to you can just take solace in the fact that most of the show probably wasn't written with any inkling how it would all end."
wilfred,32adn7,TheOneTrueBastard,3,Sun Apr 12 21:47:09 2015 UTC,"The only troubling part was that it seems to suggest that troubled people should embrace their insanity, and believe me, that's a message crazy people do not need to hear."
wilfred,32adn7,c4sanmiguel,8,Sun Apr 12 10:50:21 2015 UTC,"I think Ryan just came to terms with reality, that he was never going to be normal, but that doesn't mean he can't be happy. It's a steady theme in the show and I think it has more to do with accepting yourself than embracing your insanity. Jenna chose to be ""normal"" and to keep lying to herself and she was unhappy for it. Ryan on the other hand, realized that trying to be normal was killing him and he didn't want to end up like his mother. He learned to tell his hallucinations apart from the real world and wasn't a danger to anyone, so why not embrace his imaginary friend?"
wilfred,32adn7,teewuane,2,Mon Apr 13 21:21:35 2015 UTC,"I'm okay with how it ended. Especially after re watching the series with that in mind. A lot of things pop out, like how man times Wilfred says things like ""I am you"". I didn't like that he came back after the real Wilfred died in the final episode but maybe after watch it all again it will make better sense. FYI if you do watch it all again, prepare to have more questions. And maybe that's the point but I like to think that there is an answer to everything in that show. If not, whatever, at least it was hilarious. Made me lol a lot especially because I have a dog and Wilfred was usually spot on."
wilfred,32adn7,tkeiy714,2,Wed Apr 22 05:15:59 2015 UTC,I think a main reason for the ending was FX ending it prematurely and the writers only having a season to finish it.

wilfred,329uum,d1ckboot,6,Sat Apr 11 22:50:13 2015 UTC,Boop :) IIRC the to be continued was a few episodes before the finale

Ryan hears him calling, he is in the painting with Wilfred and they start talking, Wilfred tells Ryan that he's mataman then they play catch, Ryan snaps out of it and has the ball in his hand. He sees Jenna and she says her and the ex (forgot name) are getting back together. Ryan tells her to screw off basically. That's all I remember"
