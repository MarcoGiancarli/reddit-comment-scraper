PRINCESSLUNA,1zi1gp,psychomotorboat,5,Tue Mar 4 04:20:20 2014 UTC,"I could write a huge wall of text (And I probably should to match yours), but I don't know that it would really do much good.  To me, Luna is many things. There are lots of different fan portrayals, and I love every single one of them (Okay maybe not every but you know what I'm saying). From Luna Afterdark's extremely grumpy and lonely Luna to  JohnJoseco's ""perfect gamer girl"" archetype.   As for which portrayal of Luna I prefer the most? I think the most interesting part of her character is that she's tied to the night itself in some spiritual way, and she shares traits with it like being a loner and somewhat alien. I'm currently creating a story blog on tumblr that heavily involves Luna, and I've chosen a slightly different version of her to include in it. In that story, I'm attempting to write a Luna who's lost everything, even herself, and feels intensely guilty for a great many things. She's trying to be more like her sister, in a somewhat naive way. Despite her wisdom from being immortal, there's still a nearly adolescent immaturity. I can't really hope to contain what Luna is to me in just a single Reddit comment, so I hope that my story will do so in time."
PRINCESSLUNA,1zi1gp,DarkFlame7,3,Tue Mar 4 05:44:59 2014 UTC,"Sorry for writing so much I guess. I had a lot of points to hit and I didn't feel a list would be coherent.  I read a bit of fanfiction and have found her portrayal to range from Neil Gaiman's The Sandman to pinkie pie, so I am not really focusing on fanstuff here, but I get your headcannon of her to be from fanstuff, much like mine is for all of the BPs.  Your story blog sounds like a pretty cool idea. Let this sub know when its up."
PRINCESSLUNA,1zi1gp,DarkFlame7,3,Tue Mar 4 06:09:43 2014 UTC,"Sorry, I didn't mean the long post thing as negative. I appreciate a lot of words and a character like Luna's deserves it.  And yeah, you're right that my idea of her is mostly based on fan stuff. It's largely because of how little she's been in the show so far. I do think what we've seen in the show is really strong, but the fan stuff makes her even stronger.   As for my blog, it's actually been up for a while, since Halloween. The blog features Scootaloo as a bat pony predominantly, but Luna is definitely... more important to me. Here's the blog. It's currently on a short hiatus, but I'm looking forward to what I've got in store."
PRINCESSLUNA,1zi1gp,DarkFlame7,2,Tue Mar 4 06:14:05 2014 UTC,"Sorry, I didn't mean the long post thing as negative.   No worries. I was thinking you were going to call be an egghead for a second there.   the fan stuff makes her even stronger.    Yeah I love how the fandom just takes everything about the show to the next level in all directions. Once you find the direction you like, you stick with it and reap the awesome.  And thanks for sharing the blog. This post was really cool."
PRINCESSLUNA,1zi1gp,DarkFlame7,2,Tue Mar 4 06:28:22 2014 UTC,Also I just noticed that you posted something of mine to another subreddit just today.  What a small internet
PRINCESSLUNA,1zi1gp,DarkFlame7,2,Tue Mar 4 06:31:17 2014 UTC,"Oh wow. Nice job on that picture man. EoP is certainly a favorite of mine and that picture is as well. Great to see a fellow Marsupial Alumni.  I'de love to give you a Critique or something, but I don't know jack about art. Great Job though. I might eventually use that for a custom mousepad or something."
PRINCESSLUNA,1zi1gp,himmelkrieg,2,Tue Mar 4 06:47:10 2014 UTC,"End of Ponies is still my favorite! I do love Background Pony too though.  I'm actually friends with skirts, and he's been helping me out with the story for my blog occasionally. I think the influences will start appearing more and more..."
PRINCESSLUNA,1zi1gp,PheonixCircle,2,Tue Mar 4 06:51:56 2014 UTC,"Ahh I love both stories so much. BP more though, all of that psuedophilosophy let me see things in a new light. EoP was simply epic at times though in just amazing ways. Like when Scoots unleashes her wings to escape the dirigible dogs or when harmony gives her speech to the trolls before fighting them all night or when Dinky turns into a cosmic radio.   I could go all day hahaha. If he's helping you out with your blog, I'm sure it will turn into either appledash, tron, or the firmaments.   Friends with skirts? I didn't know such a thing was possible for anyone who is not ponky. Send my that big lemur my regards."

PRINCESSLUNA,1xapiu,Myrandall,1 point,Fri Feb 7 19:54:30 2014 UTC,I really like the different mane colour on this one.
PRINCESSLUNA,1x5zd4,VladimirZharkov,2,Thu Feb 6 08:27:33 2014 UTC,Are you asking about the downvote? I don't think you did anything wrong. People just like to be critics and downvote art they don't think is 100% perfect.
PRINCESSLUNA,1wyr7f,cowofdoom,2,Tue Feb 4 06:02:38 2014 UTC,Came out pretty good!

PRINCESSLUNA,1v0vfl,Myrandall,2,Sun Jan 12 10:23:12 2014 UTC,It looks like you copied the wrong link there maybe? Here's the fixed one.

PRINCESSLUNA,1undiq,SaltLich,5,Tue Jan 7 21:27:38 2014 UTC,It looks great though.

PRINCESSLUNA,1sztpc,himmelkrieg,4,Mon Dec 16 08:01:54 2013 UTC,"It's pretty obvious her character is just pasted over the top of the existing intro scene, sadly."
PRINCESSLUNA,1sztpc,ridger5,2,Mon Dec 16 15:19:36 2013 UTC,She is still keeping Luna down. We need to overthrow the solar empire!
PRINCESSLUNA,1rszxf,himmelkrieg,2,Sun Dec 1 00:24:32 2013 UTC,"What a great series. I totally hear it too, btw."
PRINCESSLUNA,1rszxf,ChriosM,2,Sun Dec 1 16:03:54 2013 UTC,"Kenpachi Ramasama, we got a letter!"
PRINCESSLUNA,1rszxf,ridger5,2,Mon Dec 9 19:08:55 2013 UTC,Are you ready for some smooth jazz?
PRINCESSLUNA,1rszxf,ridger5,2,Mon Dec 9 19:25:13 2013 UTC,"It's so smooth, I can't take it!"
PRINCESSLUNA,1qd4w6,Balloons504,1 point,Mon Nov 11 08:00:12 2013 UTC,Luna's definitely looking like the less-dominant one here.
PRINCESSLUNA,1q4vr7,Myrandall,3,Thu Nov 7 22:48:49 2013 UTC,That's PRINCESS Moonbutt for you!
PRINCESSLUNA,1pn734,drawponies,1 point,Thu Oct 31 21:17:42 2013 UTC,Love it!

PRINCESSLUNA,1pebe2,Myrandall,1 point,Mon Oct 28 17:09:23 2013 UTC,It took me longer than I'd care to admit to realize that the angle is from the back.
PRINCESSLUNA,1ox7rf,Myrandall,1 point,Mon Oct 21 19:26:38 2013 UTC,...Is it the wine? Is that the taste?
PRINCESSLUNA,1oscs5,sndifferent,2,Sat Oct 19 18:00:29 2013 UTC,"She loved the night, moved each star with such tender and care. Singing a song of one to her thousands shimmering hearts in the sky. I like to think this was her final word as Luna when she became nightmare moon. That she was sorry.  And the stars could do nothing but comply to the elder sister, but none of Lunas listeners forgot her songs. Her decency. They aid her escape, and made everyone see that she was only guilty of an innocent try, fueled by love and beauty.  I talk to much."
PRINCESSLUNA,1nyxwf,Myrandall,1 point,Tue Oct 8 07:32:11 2013 UTC,Love it. Don't know why egophiliac doesn't allow comments on her posts.
PRINCESSLUNA,1nyxwf,ridger5,1 point,Tue Oct 8 15:29:23 2013 UTC,Have you seen some of the things that show up in comment sections on brony art?
PRINCESSLUNA,1nyxwf,E-Squid,1 point,Tue Oct 8 23:16:51 2013 UTC,"On reddit I see people bitching about it all the time, but I don't think I've ever seen a comment like those on DA."
PRINCESSLUNA,1nyxwf,ridger5,1 point,Wed Oct 9 01:41:03 2013 UTC,The last line is my favorite out of all Luna comics I've seen.
PRINCESSLUNA,1n8bb8,drawponies,1 point,Fri Sep 27 05:30:25 2013 UTC,What... what's going on? Are those pills?
PRINCESSLUNA,1md44c,throwawayaccount38,3,Sat Sep 14 06:02:43 2013 UTC,I'll just leave this here
