modeltrains,3dwdox,atrainmadbrit,4,Mon Jul 20 13:11:50 2015 UTC,Here's a video explaining how it works. It doesn't mentions how the cars are stopping and waiting at the junction though.
modeltrains,3dwdox,borrokalari,2,Mon Jul 20 11:22:23 2015 UTC,"Basicly there is a strip in the ""road"" and sensors underneath the gate area that tell the truck / car to stop.  Then once the switches are moved back the truck can move forward.    I looked into the Faller Car System about a year ago, but still waiting to pull the trigger.   They do some really cool stuff with their stuff."
modeltrains,3dwdox,GoKartMozart,2,Mon Jul 20 14:05:31 2015 UTC,"So basically when the sensor is active, it stops the motor in the vehicle and when the sensor is inactive then the motor starts again.  so the RR crossing activates or deactivates the sensor when it's enabled or disabled...  that is just genius.  The one thing that seems a bit off is the speed regulation; imagine if you had a sensor in the road that tells the motor to run slower so you could get the cars to slow down before entering a curve to keep it realistic.  You could even simulate traffic jam by rigging speed sensors and stop sensors to a control box that is handled by someone; When cars reach said sensor they slow down so the other incoming cars will pile up and slow down as well...."

modeltrains,3duge1,Backpacks_Got_Jets,5,Sun Jul 19 16:18:18 2015 UTC,Sounds like you need a smoke machine that's typically used for haunted houses and the like. I'd try doing a search on youtube for a 12v solution.   For safety reasons I do not recommend dry ice smoke.
modeltrains,3duge1,roj2323,6,Sun Jul 19 23:31:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're going to get near the amount of smoke you would want from the elements that model trains use. At best it's a little wisp, even if you had several running it would still be a ""jetpack just finished firing"" level of smoke, nothing akin to a running one. I think your best bet would be to get a fog machine from a party store and rig that up inside your jetpack. It would give you many times more volume with more force. The guys in the DIY subreddit would probably be really helpful with your endeavor too."
modeltrains,3duge1,gec44-9w,3,Sun Jul 19 16:28:22 2015 UTC,That's actually the level I was looking for. Just kind of an ambient light smoke
modeltrains,3duge1,gec44-9w,2,Sun Jul 19 16:35:19 2015 UTC,"Well as I understand it the mechanism is just a heating coil submerged in a reservoir of lamp oil or similar. The trick would be keeping your reservoir from sloshing and spilling ad you walk around with it. Also the smoke is going to want to rise, so it might be a little tricky to get the smoke to go out the downward pointed nozzles."
modeltrains,3duge1,Xuttuh,0,Sun Jul 19 18:49:22 2015 UTC,My though was trying to contain the system so the only path for the smoke to take would be through the tube leading to my thrusters.
modeltrains,3duge1,hyperdream,3,Sun Jul 19 18:51:16 2015 UTC,"Train units put out tiny amounts of smoke, not what you are after.  Look for a cheap 12v smoke unit (I use one in my car - for ummm reasons) like http://www.smokemachines.net/buy-12v-dc-battery-smoke-machine.shtml . I got mine from a party shop cheaper than that. Quality is questionable, but it is only used a handful of times, as would yours.  You might also consider dry ice. A small computer fan in each jet could suck the gas out of the pack. The interesting thing about dryice is that the vapor is heaver than air, so it falls to the floor. I've used that in theater shows, as it tumbles off the stage like a mist waterfall."

It will tell you when you've curved a piece of flex track too much which seems amazingly helpful. The only downside (for me) is that they don't have an OS/X version, so I had run it either at work or in a virtual machine.  There's a bunch of free plans done with AnyRail here if you want to see more examples."
modeltrains,3dp25b,ZenKeys88,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:16:32 2015 UTC,"For the ""What should we do here?"" part of the track plan, you should straighten out the switch work if you're going to have that area connected ""through"" (that is, it could be a detour past the tunnel). A train wiggling through that many switches is prone to derailment. Same thing applies to the switch directly underneath the word ""track."" Putting a switch directly opposite an S curve is another great spot for derailments.   Suppose you moved the yard to the ""What should we do here?"" spot and bumped the tunnel exit down a foot or two, creating a balloon track? Then you could extend the yard further, which you will genuinely want. I'm too tired to draw a diagram of this right now, but remind me if you like.

My MS Paint diagram shows what I mean. If you cut your current Pink Foam Plateau in half and move the switch ladder, you'll have MUCH more space on the lower level for a good-sized switching yard, all you'd have to do is move the tunnel portal down a foot or so. I also doodled in a lead running off the three tracks for the tipple so you could switch the tipple without interrupting mainline traffic."

I don't see the current generation at all being interested in something like this - much less for $75.  But then again, that sort of stuff must still sell, otherwise I can't imagine they'd keep churning it out over and over.  However once MTH bust onto the scene in the mid 90s, then Lionel started taking things seriously again because suddenly there was legit competition, and now they arguably offer some of the most detailed 3-rail stuff out there (though it also happens to be just about the most expensive 3-rail stuff out there too - which is why I tend to buy mostly MTH).  Unfortunately when they do release good stuff, they usually don't offer enough variety in road names to appeal to a broad enough crowd.

modeltrains,3d3xuy,milkymoocowmoo,6,Mon Jul 13 15:50:45 2015 UTC,"If you're looking at selling this stuff you could make yourself a small fortune. I can't speak of the models' rarities, but brass is very desirable to certain collectors.     The 'Optimus Prime' is a Southern Pacific cab forward. Interesting story about these! The SP routes featured a lot of long tunnels and snowsheds, and conventional steam locomotives filled these with smoke and nearly suffocated the engineers on several occassions. They tried just running the loco in reverse so the engineers were ahead of the smokestack, but this was clumsy and brought about its own problems.  A 'proper' cab forward design was commissioned. They burned oil instead of coal as this meant the tender didn't need to be in front of the cab, but this caused problems too. On one occasion the oil lines (the firebox was still at the cab end so oil needed to be fed up the length of the loco) leaked while climbing through a tunnel and coated the rails, causing the drivers to slip and eventually the loco stalled. When it started slipping backwards a coupler broke which caused a break in the air circuit, resulting in a train-wide emergency brake application. Now unable to move, the loco quickly filled the tunnel with smoke and steam (it was leaking that as well). Just when you thought things couldn't get worse, the leaked oil then caught fire and the crew was burned alive. :|     As for the weird suspension designs, the Big Boys were articulated like most of the other large steam locos. There were a few different types, but the most common was the Mallet layout. This is where the loco has one boiler but two engines - the rear set of drivers is attached to the frame, but the front set is free to pivot. The leading truck is attached to the front engine as well.   Articulation was basically what happened when the railroads wanted more powerful locos but the tracks could not physically handle a longer set of rigid axles. Not everyone was so accepting of these physical limitations...  The Ruskis produced one single 4-14-4 locomotive (for comparison, the Big Boy is 4-8-8-4). In an attempt to let it take on corners, the middle three axles had blind wheels (no flanges) and the very end axles front and back were able to move laterally. It didn't work. The loco derailed often, split rails and wrecked turnouts as it passed through them. The multiple wheels were intended to spread the weight out over the rails evenly, but it was still too heavy and the huge wheelbase only aided it in being too long to fit on turntables. It was also too powerful for the couplers of the day, but that didn't matter because the boiler was too small to run the loco at full power for very long. It was such a turd that it never actually entered service. Still...wouldn't say no to one in N! :)"
modeltrains,3d3xuy,milkymoocowmoo,3,Mon Jul 13 11:36:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know what I'm doing with the majority of them. I'll probably sell the unopened ones. We'll keep the SP 2-8-0 from the mantle, the Union Pacific Big Boy, and the weathered SP. I'll probably hold on to the Hunter/Cutter-built S P 4-6-0, too.  Do you think any of the damaged ones are worth restoring? A few have a bit of rust and corrosion, so I'm sure the electrics are shot. I don't have the time to take it on myself, especially with everything else going on. I'm also planning to move and there's only so much I can transport and store.  That's an insane story about the cab-forwards. Talk about an engineering oversight."
modeltrains,3d3xuy,lazyguyoncouch,6,Mon Jul 13 12:00:39 2015 UTC,"For sure. Besides, even being damaged doesn't rule out a collector wanting them. Brass is an alloy but does not contain iron, so it cannot rust. Any tarnishing is removable and doing so should reveal clean brass underneath, although in some cases that might be easier said than done (fine details). Again though, I know for a fact that some modelers enjoy bringing brass models back to their former glory.  Don't worry about the electricals :) The great thing about older models is that they tend to have simpler mechanisms, and it's not difficult to find a substitute motor if need be. The rest of the drivetrain can be more difficult, but nothing is impossible if you have the desire."

Does the track in your set have metal stud contacts down the middle and/or is there a metal ""sled"" on the bottom of the locomotive?  If the answer is yes, then you have an AC set (which is what Märklin makes, very similar in concept to 3-rail O Gauge), and you will not be able to run DC locomotives from Bachmann, Hornby, et. al. Rather, you are restricted to using AC locomotives (like those that Märklin makes).  If no, then you're in luck. You have a DC set and you will be able to run locomotives from other manufacturers that make DC locomotives, like Bachmann and Hornby, et al. However, you will not be able to use AC locomotives (again, like those that Märklin makes).  While the track gauge is the same, the method of getting electricity to and from the locomotives is vastly different. Thus, AC locomotives are incompatible with DC locomotives (and vice versa).

Both AC and DC are both a form of analogue control (which is what you're describing and is apparently what you have), whereas DCC is is digital control and is what's used (these days) to run multiple trains at different speeds.  One could have AC analogue or AC Digital or DC analogue or DC Digital.

I believe MTH produces a line called 'Lionel Tinplate Traditions' with a whole line of classic sets and accessories recreated in modern times. I'd look into it if I were you. Hey, it would also be cool to have them sitting side by side eh? The old vintage tinplate sitting alongside the fresh and glossy reproduction."
modeltrains,3d1hmd,TheOnlyBongo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:59:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've seen the Tinplate Traditions sets and pieces, but they are just so expensive and they don't make one of the kind that I have/really like to my knowledge so it just hasn't been worth it for me to buy.  If I ever have an exclusively tinplate/prewar layout (Christmas village layout, maybe), then it will be worth it."

I collect vintage militaria and firearms, as well as vintage trains and the like. ALWAYS make sure what you're restoring keeps the value, even if it's scuffed and love-worn. As my arms mentor said, you can't unpaint the Ecce Homo."
modeltrains,3d1hmd,Jeff_Faust,7,Mon Jul 13 02:23:48 2015 UTC,"'Tis no fun if it don't run.   I collect and operate American Flyer S gauge, and non-operational pieces are worthless to me. Might as well collect Hummel figurines if you're just going to shelve them.   The reproduction parts support for prewar (and postwar, for that matter) Lionel is such that just about anything can be made to operate again. No one will fault you for that.   Cosmetics? Do a little research into your items first. Relatively common items won't suffer in value from a well-done cosmetic restoration. Rare items have a value that transcends their condition, however, and are better left alone."
modeltrains,3d1hmd,AMCguy_HOtrains,4,Mon Jul 13 00:07:29 2015 UTC,"I repair trains part-time. There is no loss in value in doing mechanical repairs. Cosmetic fixes, yes, those can be detrimental to overall value....but if it's YOUR train, from YOUR family, and you want it to run? get it fixed! Take it to another shop! if the train is already beat up, play-worn, how much value can it lose by fixing it? Most collectors are nit-picky fussy rivet-counters, if the train isn't mint, they're not going to pay diddly for it anyway. If the train and cars have severe rusting, I wouldn't want to play with it like that either, getting rust on my hands. At that point, you just have to decide whether you are interested in play value, or shelf value.   Now , my shop has ONE advantage - the boss has a wall full of vintage Lionel parts, not MODERN ones, but New Old Stock. So he can replace old parts with ones from the same era, just unused. Most places don't have that type of inventory. His Dad was in the Lionel business for many years, so bought the inventory to use for repairs from another shop many decades ago. It's like a time capsule of repair parts. In THIS case, there is no loss in value, because you're replacing old parts with new old parts. :)  They're the same, just unused. That is the only way out of your dilemma if you want to both hold value AND get it repaired. You can look up Train Depot in Chantilly, VA if you want to send them there for repair. Labor is 65/hr though, plus parts.    IN the end, it's your train. do with it what will make you happy. People put V-8's in Model T cars, because they can. So what if they're not original? They're still on the road at that point. I feel the same way about trains, but then again, I don't own Pre-war, they ARE special, very limited volume, so you have to be careful about them, but if you're truly interested in running them, I see no reason not to repair them. Again, our shop has vintage Lionel parts, so at least contact the shop to see what it might cost to fix it with vintage NOS parts. Then you can have your cake and eat it too. :) - Jerry , multi-scale train repair tech -"

modeltrains,3d0pg9,Jeff_Faust,2,Sun Jul 12 17:01:46 2015 UTC,"You'd need a DCC system, like a PowerCab (street price approximately $140 last time I checked). You'd need a USB interface to go with your DCC system (NCE's interface is about $50). You'd need a USB cable to fit. Install JMRI on your computer, plug everything in, and off you go.   BTW, have you read through the NMRA's standards for DCC? You'll find them under 9.1 and 9.2 here."
modeltrains,3d0pg9,kellyzdude,4,Sun Jul 12 17:38:56 2015 UTC,"Do you have a DCC setup already? Do you want one, separate from the PC?  Digitrax has the Zephyr as their starter unit, and the Digitrax PR3 is the USB interface, or there is a third party device called LocoBuffer that will also do the same job -- some people like one over the other for different reasons.  NCE has similar tools, I'm not as familiar with those.  If you just want your Pi or PC to act as a command station, consider the Sprog device (USA / UK). It may fit your needs for now, but may not fit them long term. Just a thought.  JMRI is the ideal/standard interface, no matter what DCC system you're using. It definitely supports the PR3, LocoBuffer, and Sprog, as far as I can tell it also supports NCE along with several others."

modeltrains,3d0pg9,lilspikey,2,Mon Jul 13 04:17:45 2015 UTC,"If you do want to use a Raspberry Pi - it can't generate DCC output directly, as the timing needs to be very precise (down to nano-seconds I believe) and multi-tasking on the RPi means it can't guarantee that.  However there is the ""Gertbot"" (http://www.gertbot.com/) which you can connect to the RPi and it can generate DCC for you.  There's some example code over here too:  http://www.gertbot.com/download.html"
modeltrains,3d0pg9,time-lord,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:36:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info. I am somewhat aware of that limitation - this project I came across (https://github.com/hsanjuan/dccpi) shows the use of a h bridge which I think does what you described?   On a side note, if you have electronics experience, do you think a setup as shown on that githib would be straightforward enough for a newbie to build it on a breadboard or similar. Cheers"
modeltrains,3d0pg9,lilspikey,2,Mon Jul 13 12:26:53 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I'm guessing they're bit-bashing the GPIO pins to do DCC. I know the timing of DCC is quite strict, so don't know how reliably that will work. Might glitch a bit if RPi has brief high load spike etc. They might be doing something clever to workaround that though.   TBH I'd suggest getting something like the gertbot if you're unsure about the electronics. I destroyed one train (z-scale) due to ignorance trying to DIY the electronics.

I'm not sure why I didn't think of it, but I headed over to Flickr and did an advanced search looking for ""garmisch"" and ""train"" for shots taken between 1990 and 2007 (epoch/era V). It looks like the class 111 was very dominant at Garmisch for the latter half of the era and in 2007 it would look like they introduced the EMU-type train.

I can't identify it, but here's one that is similar - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8s8rF5ONEkE , Tenshodo is a maker of partial brass diesels, never heard of the Kumata before.

If you use real sand you will want to strain all but the finest particles out.  The nylon mesh used for women's stockings actually works really well as a super fine strainer for this.  You could also use one of the scenery products that's made from very finely ground real rock, such as Arizona Rock and Mineral or Highball Products."

If you're talking their individual locos, I've found them to be making great improvements and are probably worth consideration.  Their ""Spectrum"" line (again, in N scale) seems to be quite good, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them - especially the awesome little 44-ton switcher.

modeltrains,3clzx6,time-lord,2,Thu Jul 9 01:41:20 2015 UTC,"They're the Kia of model trains.  Much better than they used to be, arguably a decent mainstream buy, but nothing they can do will ever elevate them into the top tier.  They were definitely 'train-set' material 25 years ago.  A lot of zany product choices (the BQ23-7, for example, and a high-hood GP50, were not models the hobbyists of 1990 were desperately begging for) and a reputation for a mechanism that fell apart after a few hours of use, but they at least threw a good warranty behind their products.  I can still recall when they brought out the 'Spectrum' range-- it was seen as ""A major step forward for Bachmann, but still not quite Proto 2000'.  Someone evidently told them ""do some research as to what modelers wanted"" at that time, because among the first things they brought out in that range were a GP30 and a SD45, both of which were hugely underserved in affordable HO plastic at the time.  I have a Spectrum SD45, which I got like fifteen years ago to build as a static model (space constraints).  It was much better than Athearn's SD45 at the time (weird preproduction style radiators, cast-on grab irons, non-scale-width hood) but you could still see significant places where it lacked (the truck sideframes were so awful that I swapped Athearn ones on)"
modeltrains,3clzx6,Bounty1Berry,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:45:40 2015 UTC,"Funny isnt it? Look at Athearns website and their RTR SD45s are due next year in June. People are willing to pay ridiculous amounts now for the odd balls. Back about 15 years ago, I remember the only way to get a good GP30 was to kit bash one making the ""bump"" out of styrene. The industry has changed very much so since the 1990's. Ive even seen some hobbyists refer to this day and age as being the Golden Era of model railroading, where in many things such as what models are released right down to the now pre-ordering of trains and the death of the LHS is changing this hobby. Even the demographics are changing. Most modellers who were young in the transition era of railroading make remarks about long container trains saying all the engines and rolling stock dont look any different from one train to the next. Now look at all the varieties of intermodal cars available.   Bachmanns still making odd balls like the Spectrum Schnabell car. Until you dont have to test 5 of the same engine at the LHS to find the one that doesnt sound like a machine gun at 30 scale MPH, they will always be the Kia."

They werent as good as say Intermountains, but they put the Model Power ones to shame. When I got back into HO, I was looking to spend a little money on an engine and could afford a Bachmann or an Athearn. I tested about 5 Bachmanns (2 SD40s, 2 GP38s, and a GP35). One engine was DOA and taken to be sent in for warranty. Two were really noisy. One was kinda noisy. One SD40 in CSX Dark Future was nice and quiet and ran like a charm.

Just be prepared that when you see one, it's not going to go cheap. You could always wait for the newest Rutland RS-1 release from Atlas this fall and have it repainted. They are doing 405 in the original Rutland scheme and with REALLY nice detailing, so it might be worth it to do that! Or get the Rutland 405 and an undecorated one to do in the GMRC scheme because this latest RS-1 release from Atlas is seriously amazing. I'm trying to get /u/Vermont204 to do that, but this thing called money is in the way."

modeltrains,3c9itu,Jeff_Faust,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:31:42 2015 UTC,"Could also be that you've got significantly more resistance between the booster and the track on the slower block, even if they measure the same voltage unloaded.  You might also measure it while current is being drawn - either just let the locomotive slip against a big weight or something, or use a large power resistor (15 ohms, 25W or so)."

The idea of giving someone a list of desires and getting a polished plan back in a few weeks is worth the money to some.  Additionally some people have no idea of how a railroad works so they would rather someone design a layout for them so they can focus on the scenery and other areas that they are good at or enjoy.

modeltrains,3c8wnb,AMCguy_HOtrains,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:11:53 2015 UTC,"There were 4 major players in the USA ""toy train"" market - Mantua/Tyco ( same company,but sort of different divisions ), Life Like, Model Power, and Bachmann. Some other minor players like Cox, Revell, Playart, among others also. YOu can find that GP40 for 10-20 at train shows, there's not much value to them. The Mantua Western Pacific, it depends, if it has the early MU-2 motor, it's a slightly better quality than the later PT motor. The MU-2 on early Mantua's had black metal plate bottom, and two gears poked down a bit through some punched metal. The PT was  a plastic power truck, and the gears on one side of the wheels, easily distinquishable. The PT was NOT a great motor, quality was iffy, but some were OK, others ran horribly. The MU-2 was a abit underpowered compared to the PT, but was a more long-term reliable motor. So if it has the gears on the bottom, it's a slightly better and more desireable engine than the later PT powered versions. The '60's Mantua's were a better quality than later engines, generally speaking. go to HOseeker.net to see more on Tyco engines. There is literature on all makes of HO trains there. Good reference site.    Bachmann had it's up and downs, their pancake motor was a disaster, and noisy. Broke gears easily. Nowadays, though, Bachmann has some really high quality stuff, nothing like the '70's and 80's era trains.    Life Like engines were nothing to rave about (in the 70's). Very noisy . Some were good, others not so much. Life Like got bought by Walthers, they're still around, and like the new Bachmann, much better quality than the ""old"" days. 30 years can improve quite a lot of things! :) Just enjoy them as they are. - Jerry -"

He was like,'you did something for yourself,' which I guess I don't do often. I usually just fix my old stuff up because I don't see myself worth spending money on.  Any hoo, It was a pretty good deal 16 of the superliners, the 4 baggage cars and the Athearn RTR P42 were only $330 shipped from a facebook for sale site. I owned the F59PHI, and I got the Kato F40 from my LHS for $120 The other two superlines where ebay wins I had bid on before buying the lot.  So I blew a paycheck, but I put it on a card so I can just take a little of each one for a month or so so I don't put myself in a hole. I am pretty happy I've got a solid passenger train now.

I think I calculated saving something like 400 over new? So if thats what you paid for double what I got basically you got an AWESOME DEAL. And you should feel NO GUILT AT ALL over purchasing that. If a deal that good comes along and its something you know you will use then sometimes you just gotta pay first, ask questions later.   And its okay once in a while to spend money on yourself. You have to. Theres no joy in paying bills. Once in a while you need to break the cycle and live a little. Enjoy."

If I did find it, which would be a miracle, I would resto-mod it to work on the club layout (I'm not familiar with how things work here: are clubs called ""the club"" or ""my club""? Regardless, I'm referring to the CGMRC), which is DCC and has frogs with itty bitty flangeways so I will have to grind them down so they fit, try to get some metal wheels on the leading truck, replace the couplers with frame-mounted kadees (a club standard), remove the air pump and replace it with a new one (to remove some of the ""toy-like"" appearance that the club finds unacceptable for show), do the same to the valve gear, and change the gearing and motor so that it doesn't stick out into the cab (another  toy-like feature). Until I get an engine to pull the cars, though, I'm not going to mod the cars in case I decide the project is no longer worth pursuing."

If so, they make different versions of the wiring, so you can hook up to the track differently. They come in a slide type connector to plug to the EZ track, or you can get the wire with U-type connections that fit onto a terminal block or the older track with screws. Some hobby shops don't carry all those types, you may have to order it online.  Here's one from Bachmann's own website, with the round plug to the supply, and bare wires on the other end to customize your hook-up :  http://estore.bachmanntrains.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=66_74&products_id=8411  Again, many hobby shops don't carry all the variations, so you may just be better off ordering online. - Jerry -"

Not really up to par on my N, but I know they at least recommend a couple radi larger than the minimum radius for those cars. For example in HO: there is a 15"" radius which is rarely ever used, the common trainset 18"", and most of those cars come with a recommendation for 22-24"" minimum radius. As well truck mount and body mount couplers can make a difference especially if some of those curves are on an actual corner.   But you might not have a problem with this. Looks good!"

It's not necessarily Atlas vs. Bachmann, it's which era those companies are covering and selling cars in. There's Life-like, as well, making N scale. Plus others like Kato. Choices, choices! So, pulling a 60' modern tanker with a side-braced boxcar of 40' will be out of place. You have a lot to learn. They should all hook up, unless you run into the kadee (knuckle) coupler versus the squared Rapido coupler some come with. :)  Enjoy your new hobby, you will need to do research to discover which types are modern and which are older era. Usually the smaller the size, the older the car. 40' was standard, then 50' came later in the 50's and later. There's even 85' boxcars for auto parts! Monsters. You may need to go to a train show and ask for help from people who sell them for a living. Or a well-stocked model train shop, too. - Jerry - model train repair tech"
modeltrains,3bfu2q,dwwojcik,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:23:46 2015 UTC,Thank you. I wasn't even thinking that they could be from different eras. Looking into it the starter kit was all from the 40s/50s and the rolling stock I bought was from the 80s.   Looks like I have a lot of research to do.
modeltrains,3bfu2q,Rayd8630,2,Sun Jun 28 23:36:22 2015 UTC,"The plot thickens: That F unit is painted in Norfolk Southern's Office Car Special scheme, which is in use today, and is actually quite recent.  Bachmann is dumb.  They gave you a modern passenger locomotive to pull a 1940's freight train.  Personally I'm a modern guy, so I suggest you look into a modern Norfolk Southern freight locomotive to pull your Atlas freight cars, and look for some passenger cars for your F unit to pull.  Norfolk Southern's office cars appear to be in Norfolk & Western paint with NS lettering.  I don't know of any NS cars being offered, but I'm sure N&W cars would be fine to stand in, and maybe you could re-letter them at some point."
modeltrains,3bfu2q,MaximusRuckus,2,Mon Jun 29 00:17:15 2015 UTC,"I was actually going to suggest that. It is kinda dumb how they offer an F7, painted in a modern day scheme, with 40's rolling stock. But Bachmann is Bachmann.  OP, here is what your engine actually does: http://jefalcsik.rrpicturearchives.net/pictures%5C55053%5CNS%204271,%20Jeannette,%209-1-2010_2653-R.jpg  BUT if you look at Con-Cors website, they offer these cars in N scale :http://www.con-cor.com/N4000page6.html#Norfolk%20Southern  And Walthers shows as having some in stock: http://www.walthers.com/exec/search?manu=&item=&words=restrict&split=30&category=Passenger&scale=N&keywords=norfolk&instock=Y  Walthers is basically the biggest supplier of model trains in North America. They have their own line as well they sell a lot of other brands. Any hobby shop that sells model trains should be a Walthers dealer. So you can find the cars you like from that site and if they show up in stock, you can go to your hobby shop and give them the Walthers number (i.e. 223-40244 which is for the 85' Smooth-Side Mid-Train Dome - Ready to Run w/Micro-Trains(R) Couplers in Norfolk Southern) and they should be able to bring it in with you.  Con-cor isnt exactly the best brand out there. But I run some HO scale Con-Cor in my fleet just fine. They just generally lack some of the bigger details. Unless you are absolutely obsessed with the most finite details (see also: rivet counter) they can do the job. But this is just my suggestion. Its entirely up to you. Theres no rules saying you have to run modern engines with modern stock. It is generally suggested that a modeller decide upon an area or theme so that should a time come when he or she wants to do such a thing, they dont have copious amounts of rolling stock that dont fit the theme which can be hard to sell let alone sell for a price that is more than 1/3rd of its retail sticker price. You could even repaint the engine into an older scheme and go all transition era which would see that engine and some of the older stock and the caboose running the layout. Or you could just run it all as it is. Theres no right or wrong way to enjoy the hobby, as long as you enjoy it."

They'd keep a steamer near the hill or pass to provide the extra power, then once they were to the other side, drop the steam engine off to wait for something going the other direction.  Once diesels were powerful enough, the steam was retired, but it took a while in some places.  Source:  Dad grew up with a back yard that ran up to tracks where they did that.

If you're willing to pay for it, most of the modern models are very detailed as well.   That said, there are some disadvantages. You will find that HO has a slightly better selection of models and accessories to choose from (though the difference isn't nearly as big as it used to be). In the frequent circumstance where a model is produced in both scales, the N scale version is frequently released months or even years after the HO version."

modeltrains,3b8x56,janonb,5,Sat Jun 27 12:15:28 2015 UTC,It is easier to model in HO since the pieces are bigger. I've heard from old timers doing N-scale that they wish they had done HO because now their eyes are weaker and their hands shake and it's easier to do HO.

modeltrains,3b8x56,fotbr,5,Sat Jun 27 12:13:22 2015 UTC,"Ho, modern that is, has one advantage over N - easier to put a Decoder into the engines so you can run multiples. Sound is also iffy in N gauge, tough to fit in most vintage N engines. That said, you can model quite a bit in N compared to HO, if you're limited on space, it's a good scale to go with. Doing scenery and people is tougher, due to the smaller size, of course. And as you get older, I've heard the same thing - guys get out of N and into HO because of their eyesight ( and they probably have a bigger house now, too , compared to when they started ). If you're trying to decide, I suggest you build a small N gauge module, which could be incorporated into a layout later, and do trackwork and scenery to see how you like it. That way, you've only got a small investment in space, and you could set it up as a display if you decided to go with HO instead later. Just a thought. - Jerry -"
modeltrains,3b8x56,AMCguy_HOtrains,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:20:57 2015 UTC,"Almost all new N-scale diesel engines are available with DCC decoders already in place, or are DCC ready, making conversion pretty simple.  I'm not sure if the steamers are the same or not, since I don't model steam.  You're right on sound, although it's improving, it's not as good as the larger scales."
modeltrains,3b8x56,fotbr,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:34:09 2015 UTC,"True, but not everyone wants to spend MORE money to buy newer trains, when they may already have quite a few older N scale trains. Steam engines usually require a decoder in the tender, I just worked on a guy's Bachmann Spectrum 4-6-2, it would have been a nightmare to even try to install it in the tender. The loco also had the motor power connected through the chassis, so another isolation problem, and this is a modern N gauge steam engine. Not sure if they make a Decoder version or not. But if the guy already spent over $100 on it, why would he then want to spend more for another? If you have unlimited funds, sure, but most guys who bring their trains in for service or upgrades don't. - Jerry -"

modeltrains,3b8x56,dwwojcik,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:09:12 2015 UTC,"Modern N is expensive,whereas I can go to train shows and buy vintage engines that are 20-25 bucks. Same is true with HO, but with HO, some are more easily decodered, with N, there has to be space allocated for a decoder usually, or the engine is of a design that there IS room, or it can be made by removing weight material. N is a much tougher scale to get DCC installed, IF you are wanting cheaper vintage, if you have the funds to buy all new equipment, then it's not an issue as comparing it to HO with decoders. I'm just saying that if they want N scale, then it will be tougher to do some things compared to HO as far as modernizing them if money IS an issue. And many N scale makers don't produce as many vintage N gauge engines ( F7's, etc. ) with DCC, I see more modern GE and EMD locomotives, too, so if you want to run older style locomotives, there may be no modern equivalent available with modern drives, DCC, etc. That would be a factor for me if deciding which scale to go to as well. Or which system to use."
modeltrains,3b8x56,fotbr,3,Sun Jun 28 23:32:54 2015 UTC,"There are a couple of reasons I like N scale.    The main one is obviously the size.  You can fit the same layout into about half the space as you could with HO scale, true.  But you can also fit twice the layout into the same space.  In a given space you might be able to only fit a couple of industries in HO scale, while in N there might be enough room for an entire railyard.  The other is price.  High end/premium diesel locomotives haven't broken the $150 barrier in N scale as far as I've seen, while in HO they're often well over $200.  Fewer materials, I suppose, and with smaller size comes less intricate detailing and therefore simpler manufacturing.  Most things are pretty similar between N and HO price wise, but the price of diesels is very important for me.  They're easily the most expensive equipment on a layout, and building a fleet can get expensive fast."

modeltrains,3b8x56,geologistmane,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:14:21 2015 UTC,"I got back into the hobby in N scale for a couple reasons.  Since that's what I had as a kid, so when I pulled the box out of storage and decided to get back into the hobby, it was a natural fit.  The other reason is that while I have room for an HO layout, modeling in N makes things less cramped; I don't have to have everything squished right on top of each other, or absurdly shorten things.  I eventually want to do a Lake Superior ore dock (loosely modeled after the ones in Duluth) -- in N scale, an 800ft dock is 5 ft long.  In HO scale, it's nearly double that.  When you're dealing with ships and trains, things get really big, really fast.  In order to even have a chance at making my vision a reality, HO just wasn't going to work."

Just make sure you don't get one that's AC! :) Well, technically, the accessories output on all DC power packs ARE AC ( for the lighting ), just make sure you don't hook up to THAT to power the engine! Variable DC only.     People have also used batteries and rheostats as well. Try to get a good, solid one, MRC power packs were, and mostly still are, some of the best. Even some of the old MRC metal ones from the 1970's still work great today, I have several, they're hard to kill...Tyco gold power supplies, on the other hand, were usually iffy with age, and didn't hold up. And could get flakey. But you can use anything if it still works. ANd remember to NOT hook up to the AC / Accessories side. ;) - Jerry - train repair tech"

But HO, anything pretty much will work. Bachmann, Life-Like, Tyco, MRC, etc. I highly recommend joining this HO train forum, http://www.tycoforums.com , it covers all the makers of HO, and then some. Heck of a resource, the HO-Seekers area of Literature has many hundreds of HO diagrams posted for parts and trouble-shooting use. Of all the places to go, this Tycoforums has some of the best people who won't make negative judgements about Tyco, as it's main goal was to help Tyco people. Many model railroad sites are judgemental about Tyco, but this website was set up to help those who love them.

modeltrains,3b4x7s,Trtlman,2,Fri Jun 26 01:29:49 2015 UTC,"Might I actually suggest going N scale or even Z. Much easier in a tiny apartment. Even better if you can even find it, T scale. I know that didn't answer your question and I actually don't know the answer but it should work if it is the same output."
modeltrains,3b4x7s,Trtlman,3,Fri Jun 26 00:33:50 2015 UTC,So I might've exaggerated a bit when I said tiny. I have  space to run a small HO set. I have nothing against N scale though. HO just seems to have more stuff available that I've seen so far.

Different packs might have different features, but that's entirely contained within the pack itself.  So any train designed to use DC can use any normal DC power pack."
modeltrains,3b4twp,Trtlman,4,Thu Jun 25 23:51:32 2015 UTC,Not many people have a huge room for a layout. It also makes the trees really expensive as you already pointed out. I know of a guy who has his whole basement set up with an on30 logging layout with 2 foot tall trees everywhere. Makes rerailing something a real pain.
modeltrains,3b4twp,Numbers_Station,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:06:10 2015 UTC,"Ok, makes sense for the rerailing. And I did the math for a two story house. About 4 inches, the size of my buildings. Turns out my buildings are not too small, my train is too tall. In scale it is a little 20 feet tall, maybe around 21 or 22 feet, almost as tall as the two story buildings. That is over 5 feet taller than it should be. Are all trains off like this or just mine?"
modeltrains,3b4twp,DonCasper,2,Fri Jun 26 00:19:24 2015 UTC,"Is it too tall or are the rails too tall? Have you measured the wheels and the body separately to determine if the drivetrain is the issue? Are your cars to scale?   I don't have my trains on hand, but my train is pretty close to scale. Sounds like you might have an OO scale train on your hands though."
modeltrains,3b4twp,Numbers_Station,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:31:51 2015 UTC,"I measured the train from the wheels up. The rails are thicker making it look even taller but I did measure only the train. It is a Coca Cola steam styled train and someone actually even told me once it isn't true HO scale. I think I believe them now, lol."
modeltrains,3b4twp,scoobyduped,2,Fri Jun 26 00:36:40 2015 UTC,"Usually promotional trains like your Coca Cola set are not true 1/87 scale. I would measure an Atheran Genesis loco or car to get a good sense of scale. Although even the most expensive models can still have some error, as displayed with several of Atheran's GP series having a huge rear headlight.   Also, the code of your track could throw it off too."
modeltrains,3b4twp,AMCguy_HOtrains,2,Fri Jun 26 01:47:41 2015 UTC,"It is a Coca Cola steam styled train....   Pics would let us say for sure, but it sounds like it might be a Bachmann On30 set (they get repainted for promotional sets pretty commonly).  If that's the case, it's about twice HO scale even though it runs on HO track."
modeltrains,3b4twp,AMCguy_HOtrains,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:38:46 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt it is repainted but on30, or O scale as it is also called, thank you google, does make more sense for it's size. Coca Cola has made plenty of O scale trains."

But you can spend more money to get a correctly scaled building. Buying cheaper models may cut down on the realism some, but save a ton of money, same with greenery/scenery. YOU can build your layout any way you like it! :D  But I've only seen one guy's layout, who is no longer in my club, who has a VERY wooded layout, I'd say 85% of his layout is covered in trees. Gorgeous looking, but he also configured the track so it doesn't interfere, too. They're not super high, either. But doing THAT many trees took a log of effort, something not many people want to spend their time/money on - trees, rather than trains. My money is for trains! LOL.

The one thing that could be difficult with getting I to the hobby with stuff that seemed like it probably from... Geeze I don't know pre 1970 to the mid 90s, is that there is this awesome newer (compared to what you have) control system called DDC (digital command control I think) which basically lets you run multiple Trains on one track.  If you just want to run it be thing at a time at a loop at  home, the old DC stuff which is every you have is fine. If you want to really get into it (which with what you have you could totally fool someone into thinking you have) you might want to look into converting stuff into DCC. It's actually pretty easy once you get the hang of it if you are at least somewhat electrically and I suppose mechanically competent. Also all clubs that I'm aware of these days (and don't underestimate the knowledge you can gain from joining one) will probably be operating on DCC."

From the top: Athearn DD40, Athearn DD40, SW calf/cow set (probably an Athearn). Second row: GP40 (most likely an Atlas), Athearn GP35, either a U28C or U30C, can't tell which from the picture quality, but again Athearn. Then finally, another Athearn engine, a SDP40. Third row: either a SW or NW, really couldn't tell you what specific model, a GP20, F7A and F7B, and another F7A.   I don't know much about steam engines, so I'll skip those, but in the fifth shelf, the green one is a phase 1 C424 (the numberboxes stick out obviously in this phase, whereas every other Century phase has notched numberboards).

modeltrains,3ax5ry,xAgonistx,2,Wed Jun 24 07:13:23 2015 UTC,"The GP40 is most likely an Athearn based on the smooth, rounded fuel tank. The GP35 is most likely an Atlas/Roco engine because of the notch in the fuel tank and the unsightly handrails."

The individual pieces are definitely first-rate. Nice passenger and freight selection, too. I agree, keep those you like and sell off the rest. Here's the thing ( I'm a repair guy ), most engines, after sitting for years, need cleaning and lubrication. And the RIGHT kind, and not OVER-LUBED or you'll cause burned out motors! Knowing the right kind of grease and oil to use, and how much is VERY important to getting these engines to run well after many years of sitting and neglect. Most of the engines I see come through my shop, even mint ones, that have been stored for many years, need a total break-down to clean out dried-up grease and oil, and then correctly lubed to get them to run well. if you try to run them right from storage, you risk damaging them due to dry bearings and bushings, and grease that has solidified and will cause much friction. You can try applying power to the wheels upside down to see if it will run at all, if there is any lack of power, it would be best not to run it long until it gets cleaned out and lubed properly to restore the moving parts to top condition. Looks like most of your collection is American made, I've seen Fleischmann and Marklin engines come into my shop that the grease has turned literally to a glue-like state, and the motors are pretty much seized up, even if mint, due to the age. I've had to pull the armatures out of the bushings , hard, and clean them with alcohol to get the motors to turn well again. Just a warning, long term storage is NOT kind to the mechanical workings of model trains! Trying to run them without doing some work to them may cause damage. Just an FYI before you get into trying to run them around. Good luck, you have got a GREAT start on model railroading with that collection.

The rest, give it away or sell it (if the rest of the collection is the same kind of quality as the stuff in that display case, you've got some serious lunch money on your hands) and put some of that cash towards building a fair layout when the time comes. The thing with a model railroad is that it grows, whoever owned this collection before you probably spent decades amassing it all.

The 7420 is an Atlas GP39-2, part of their ""Trainman"" line, which is  supposed to be a more ""economical"" line (although the prices really aren't much cheaper than their higher end offerings). It is wearing the correct scheme for the prototype, however it needs an assortment of added details, such as grab irons, a better horn, an antenna like the 405 has, and various other modifications. I may end up replacing the fans with Cannon ones, but that's not very high on my list of things to do with it at the time."

That tiny gear may have split, and it's just spinning on the shaft now. Many manufacturers are going cheap and putting the gears on by press-fit onto a smooth shaft, they're not even splining the shafts anymore to give them some grip. And as the gear ages, due to the force of the press-fit, because they make them undersized to hold tightly to the shaft, they eventually split, crack, and then they're useless. Life-Like HO engines , and Bachmann as well, went through that phase in the USA in the 90's and early 00's, they've since made better gears out of more durable material, but if it's split, no glue is going to hold up to the torque that motor will put out.

modeltrains,3anii9,fresnohammond,12,Sun Jun 21 23:24:51 2015 UTC,"Even brown plastic ties still look like plastic. The best way to get good looking rails and ties is the same as its always been. Paint them. It's as simple as that. Get your airbrush out and paint everything a nice rusty brown color. Then you can use a Brite boy or even sandpaper and rub the top of the rails to restore conductivity. Then you can use a dark wash to weather the ties a little if you want. Someone that builds a ""hyper real"" layout with ballast and weathering, who leaves the track shiny black, is just being lazy."
modeltrains,3anii9,Pkwlsn,2,Mon Jun 22 01:58:34 2015 UTC,"I can't argue with this advice - the best way to achieve extremely realistic track is by painting it (I prefer something on the darker and greyer end of rust) and then using a wash to weather the ties.  Then again, I model a western US prototype, where that tends to be more accurate to the prototype.  If you're after a specific prototype, look at pictures of their tracks to get the right color.  The best you can do without painting is probably Micro Engineering with weathered rail.  Then you get not only brown ties but they also knock down the shine on the rails.  That's the biggest problem with not painting is that you still have shiny rail sides."

It will simulate aged ties better.  Then apply a rust colour to the rails afterwards as usual."
modeltrains,3anii9,Mock_Frog,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:17:40 2015 UTC,"Well, obviously, many buyers of model trains were parents for kids, so they didn't care if the track was ""weathered"" or not, that's a huge economic base. Why waste weathering on young boys? It'd be lost on them. And real modelers will do their own weathering for the most part. I'd imagine it would be expensive to try to pre-weather track for those too lazy to do it themselves,and the market would be small. So that's probably why they're still plastic and shiny. As far as brown ties go...most track now is Code 100 with black ties, and code 83 with brown ties, so if you have a deep-flanged locomotive, you won't be able to use the Code 83 track. They're color-coded for rail height, they're not just either black or brown. There's a reason for the coloration. Didn't have that back in my day, I don't believe. I wasn't into it heavily until the 2000's when I bought my first house, all my childhood trains were in storage until then.

Norfolk Southern (as the Chesapeake Western) operates from Harrisonburg north to Broadway, VA. From Broadway to Strasburg, VA is out of service, and CSX operates from Strasburg all the way to Harper's Ferry.

What I personally recommend is an around the room layout with an island. This gives you a nice long run with added visual interest and a natural view block which will allow you to model several scenes. The down side of course is that you will need to build a drop down, lift up or removable section to complete the loop across the door/ entryway."

In general with a DC setup you shouldn't use additional transformers unless they're powering two completely separate loops of track.   EDIT: My suggestion for the layout would actually be to keep things analog for now. An around the walls setup would probably be the best use of your space, as others have suggested.  I would do a double track main line, with a branch line running either above or below the main, crossing over with bridges and tunnels. Power each loop independently using one transformer each. It'd be less versatile than a DCC setup (each train would be confined to its own loop for the most part, though there are some ways around that), but also less expensive since you already have everything you need besides any additional track."

In all seriousness, this is from ~2011 and (I think it) gives a good comparison between the major players out there).  If your friend is just starting out, why not have him try Bachmann's EZ-Command DCC system. It's incredibly basic, sure, but this way he can see if he really likes the idea of DCC. I've also heard good things about their Dynamis system, but I have no experience with it.  NCE is good and very capable. I've found it to be a bit complex at times to work with, but that may just be a case of not using it enough.  I ultimately went with Digitrax. It like the idea of the modular LocoNET system, which I could later hook up with relative ease to my computer (and, in turn, JMRI). It doesn't hurt that I got a very good deal on a Digitrax Zephyr a few years ago though...  Hope this helps"

It's really easy to select the loco or make a consist, operate the trains change, directions and release the locos.  I did however, have issues adding engines with older decoders to a consist. Digitrax however, is more complicated. But its modular design makes it more expandable and better for my needs. I can add signaling systems, loco transponders and stationery decoders and integrate them in with the entire system. I don't need a separate system for signaling and they link to JMRI easily. Ultimately, I went with Digitrax because it's the standard for FreeMoN. Which is how I want to eventually expand my layout."

My club was into Digitrax due to volume discount for the club, so that's what I went with when I joined. I've been happy with it. I see more of it at shows than MRC, to be honest. I think MRC has a better quality system maybe, but Digitrax has beat them on volume sales, so they're more prevalent I think. I just bought a Bachmann EZ-Command unit off Ebay, the older gray unit, and it is VERY simple to use. But there are limits, it can play the sound, but I""m not sure you can change the volume with it. I'll have to read the manual more closely. And it only allows 10 addresses, # 1 through 10, so you don't get much choice there, either. but it IS very simple to use and operate. And you can program with it. A base Digitrax system is around $400-500. So for $150, you can probably get the newer EZ Command system, and it may have more controls than the older one I have. But for what it is, it works well. - Jerry -"

Its a cheap ($90 at modeltrainstuff), single-throttle, 15-button desktop cab that says it can control 4 (addresses 1-4) locos but appears to be able to control at least 10 (addresses 0-9)--though it'll only put out 2 amps of power, so your load could affect it greatly.  Beyond that, they say in the manual that they'll upgrade it to 4 amps for a $60 charge. and it can accept a Prodigy handheld throttle as an input, so after you get acquainted with it you can move on the cooler stuff (and start using 4-digit addressing too).    So far, I'm quite happy with it.   I've run a total of five N-scale locos with no problem, other than the hectic switching between them on the single throttle.  I've changed CVs on one of the locos (remapping class lights) and it was pretty straight-forward.  I'm planning on adding the MRC 1516 USB interface ($60 or so on Ebay) so I can have two more throttles on my computer.    My only gripe is that it doesn't have a separate program-track output, but a good-ole trusty DPDT switch fixed that."

My tipp for you: Put them for sale on the German ebay page as one auction with a short list of the cars/locos and 1-2 pics from each of them.

modeltrains,39tz64,IamYosho,3,Sun Jun 14 21:48:26 2015 UTC,"I would tend to disagree with the poster who says you won't get as much singly as you would a set. it all depends on whether or not someone wants to buy a whole set. Many collectores would look at the set, and say I've already got that piece, and that piece, and that piece, and I don't want doubles. Others looking for a set won't go but so high anyway. In America, small lots do well, a big one not as much. So it also depends on how much is in the set. LGB is a high quality maker of trains, so they should sell well regardless. But lumping them all together may not get you as much as selling them individually. Just an American train collector/operator's opinion. You may have something similar in Europe like Craigslist, which is a regional forum for people selling items. I've bought trains that way myself. So you might want to try searching for something like that over on your side of the pond. - Jerry -"
modeltrains,39tz64,AMCguy_HOtrains,0,Sun Jun 14 23:16:45 2015 UTC,"Since Reddit is mostly American, I assumed OP is American too. I am honest if I say, that I don't know much about the modeltrain scene over there or anything about the market and brand popularity. If there is actually a decent market for LGB (which is owned by Märklin today btw), then it shouldn't be a problem to separately offer each railcar and loco. My opinion is based on the assumption, that LGB is unkown in the US. If this is the case, then it should definetly be sold atleast in 3 auctions: the loco, the passenger cars and freight cars together. Since the insured shipping in this size will also cost a lot, people won't offer much money for a single car.    This can also be seen on shipping between European states, where the costs can go up to 15-20€ just for crossing the border and being insured. That would be comparable like sending a parcel in the US from one state to one of its neighbour states and getting billed 25$ for it.  Pages like Craigslist do exist over here, but only in a very very small scale. They can nowhere be compared to Craigslist in size and using frequence.  But never the less, it is also a legit option to sell stuff. :)"

The engine looks to be a poor runner, but with it being imported from Japan, it may be rare enough to fetch a good price with a collector ($50+).  The first boxcar (middle) looks to be the cheap stuff from the '70's, but the couplers on the second car (bottom) is a mystery, as they are hook couplers, commonly used in Europe.

The full width body allows for a larger and therefore heavier mechanism, and short of traction tyres this is the only way you get more pulling power. InterMountain have produced some decent FTs that are sold in AB pairs, complete with drawbar. With mine I speedmatched each A & B pair then assigned them the same DCC address seeing as they're permanently coupled. :)  Kato's variety of F & E-units are good, but their mechanisms don't have the simpler designs of some other brands and feature less metal, which detracts from the pulling ability. Still superior to a hood unit of similar size of course. If you do get some, do NOT rely on the tiny grey plastic clip that holds the motor tabs down onto the decoder. Half the time they don't create reliable contact after a decoder install, and when they do failure is a matter of when, not if. Save yourself the heartache and just solder.  If you're willing to go a bit later, I'm yet to find a diesel that pulls better than Athearn's F45/FP45 and I highly doubt you can without changing scales. These things are monsters and everybody I know who owns one (or more...I have 7!) agrees that they're unbeatable. The body is long & wide with a simple mech design that maximizes the available space for weight. The trucks on these are also a unique split frame metal design which gives them a further weight advantage over the plastic trucks you normally see on diesels. I shit you not I've taken a hood unit lashup off a stalled train, swapped it for half as many F45 and they've pulled it like the load wasn't even there. Unless Athearn bring their DDA40X to N you will not find a more powerful diesel."

Anyways, how good are the Micro trains heavyweight passenger cars and how much assembly do they require? Also, in HO I can't seem to find any heavyweight passenger cars. Any suggestions?"
modeltrains,399uqw,dwwojcik,2,Wed Jun 10 22:18:03 2015 UTC,"0-6-0s weren't really used for anything other than switching.  The lack of leading wheels prohibited them from moving at mainline speeds, or they'd derail.  They do have more driving wheels than a 4-4-0, but that's mainly because back when they were popular (1800s) trains were lighter and smaller so you didn't need as large of an engine.  You could probably get away with a switcher for now though.  It'll come in handy later if you get a yard or industrial area.  Sorry, I don't really know much about heavyweight passenger car models.

As you can see they're pretty pricey, and there don't seem to be any cheap plastic kits, only high-quality brass ones.  And yeah, an 0-6-0 hauling a passenger train isn't prototypical at all, but as you expand your roster it could serve as your Coach Yard switcher.  If you're looking for less expensive motive power options for passenger trains, you should consider picking up a first-generation diesel or two, such as an EMD F3 or Alco PA."

modeltrains,38xzsu,WhateverJoel,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:04:01 2015 UTC,"That's the real problem here -- the Timesaver was never, ever meant to be used as the track plan for a town or industry on a model railroad.  It is an interesting game but it is an extremely BAD plan for a switching district.  Anyone who has ever tried to do real switching in one (as I have) will tell you it is both frustrating and discouraging.  It bears NO resemblance to any type of track plan you would ever find in the real world, and there are few people who understand layout design who would get behind it and recommend it to anyone.   It's true, the Timesaver as a concept was designed as a puzzle to challenge individual's switching skills, generally as a form of competition in a controlled environment. It wasn't intended as a town on a real layout.  That said, it by no means restricts it. Railroads suffer more limitations than modelers in the sense that we have full control over where we want that building to be, because it will let us put the switch in the optimal location and everything will be aesthetically pleasing.  Railroads don't care about aesthetics, but they do care about practical limitations, and it generally isn't the railroad's choice where the industry they're being asked to serve is physically located - or any other buildings that might be in their way. That means they have to work with what they have, whether it involves switchbacks or other complicated maneuvers to get cars in and out. Especially by the time we condense it for our layouts, it can begin to look a little like a switching puzzle.  All that to say, just because it's a complicated puzzle doesn't mean you can't find it or something like it in the real world. And the railroads don't particularly like switching them either."

Is having the motor mounted in that orientation (shaft perpendicular to the rails) common for European model locomotives?  Every North American prototype loco that i have seen has the motor mounted with the shaft parallel to the rails.
modeltrains,38vfwm,kent_eh,2,Sun Jun 7 13:17:48 2015 UTC,"originally it was fitted to British steam locomotives in the tender as, due to the models having a more restrictive space, the tender was the only place big enough to fit a motor with enough torque to pull scale length trains of about 8 to 12 coaches, this was soon adopted in all larger OO scale models during the 70s and 80s as a standard motor that is thin and compact and provides a relatively high level of torque due to the diameter of the armature in relation to the length.  the motor can also apply 100% of available power to the wheels all the time, a screw-gear actually reduces the power going to the wheels, as it is diminished during the ""sliding mesh"" between the screw and the drive cog  but it has the downside of being clunky and noisy, and if it is cold you have to push the loco to ""kickstart"" the motor.  It was a perfectly acceptable compromise at the time, but now we have better motors that are fitted conventionally in the loco  nevertheless, if you can find a secondhand ringfield-driven model, then the chances are that as long as the armature is undamaged it will run just as well as the day it was made, so long as you give the loco a thorough service and an initial running in period of half an  hour to ""warm it up"". ringfield and pancake motors just keep on running, they are like an AK-47 machine gun: they are reliable, easy to maintain, and anyone with basic common sense can totally strip and reassemble the motor without the risk of damaging it."

I've seen a few cardboard buildings, and the realism leaves a lot to be desired. And even if they are close to realistic, you still have the hazard of they're more fragile than a plastic building, and more prone to hazards. Obviously if you're wanting cheap over realistic, it's a consideration, but for the most part, I don't see (m)any modelers using paper buildings, as it's still only 2D, there's no depth to any brickwork, etc. About the ONLY time I see it used is as facade work on a backboard for scenery. - Jerry -"

Then you involve all the different shades of colors to even try to get it realistic, and yeah, you're not really going to get a really cheap paper building that is high quality, too.

On top of this goes a layer of plaster cloth (Woodland scenic or similar) and then I brush on plaster. The rocks are carved out of more plaster placed on this, and then given a wash of acrylic and weather with weathering powders to make them a little more natural looking. It's not a cheap method, but it's rock solid. This layout is portable and sits on coasters so I wanted it as rigid as possible. I'm hoping to show it in a model show in October."

It worked out well and really showed myself my strengths and weaknesses when it comes to modeling.  I discovered I really hate making buildings, but track work and scenery are really a lot of fun.  So I've been focusing any more work in those areas.  After I built that I discovered the joys of t-track.  Small, modular little layouts that can be completed from start to finish in a weekend.  It's perfect for small spaces, though not nearly as impressive as a fixed, finished layout.  But I think it's a fantastic compromise.

modeltrains,38hnca,AMCguy_HOtrains,2,Fri Jun 5 04:48:44 2015 UTC,"Kato is a well-known and respected brand, and the quality is par excellence for N gauge. You selected well. :) The MRC power pack is another make that has enjoyed a great reputation over the years for their power supplies that last and last.    Folding layouts are tough to do, as you'd have to break the tracks apart to shorten that 6' area to 3' . Not an easy thing to overcome. At one time, I'd thought of making a good sized one, and mounting it behind a couch, where the underside of the layout would be visible, you could make it a huge picture of some type, but then it would pivot on poles that reached from floor to ceiling, and the layout would fold down over the couch, to run and operate when you wanted. Then it could be folded back up vertically out of the way. This, of course, would require wall space, and no window to block, and scenery that was solid and wouldn't fall off. So not sure how viable this would be if you wanted multiple buildings, mountains, etc. Not well suited for tall terrain or buildings. But when I lived in a townhouse, it was an idea I had that never gelled into reality.    The other option is a smaller shelf railroad, that operates around the perimeter of a room, and is point to point, with no loops. Saves a ton of space, but if you wanted to watch a complete circuit of a train, that would be impossible to do with that design. Making the layout modular so you could take it down is another option, one of my club members has a J shaped layout in his bedroom, his son has a loop in his own bedroom down the hall, and they can join them up with 4' modules going down the hallway to operate trains fully between the fully independent layouts. His however are big enough to loops trains in both rooms fully. But a neat design, and his wife and son fully enjoy the hobby, too. - Jerry -"
modeltrains,38hnca,AMCguy_HOtrains,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:51:31 2015 UTC,hmm how would the modular system work? Would it kinda work like how /u/HydroSqueegee described? I was thinking that with the folding thing I could have a two layer kinda thing going with the second layer and taller parts being removable. But thinking it a bit more I would think going with just a single layer for now would probably work.   Edit: Found a sheet of foam thats about the right dimensions except its a bit shorter depth wise. fits pretty good where I would want it to be aswell.
modeltrains,38hnca,dwwojcik,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:48:23 2015 UTC,"Modular railroading is a concept where a standard is set, like 2x4 foot modules, then you build the trackage on them at a certain distance from one edge, and they can then all hook up to each other, and are interchangeable in location. Many clubs do shows with this type. Free-mo is another concept, where the modules aren't a set size, but they're designed to fit together like a mosaic into a layout. But you can't rearrange those as they all have their specific place on the layout. But by building them as smaller pieces, they can be knocked down and put somewhere out of the way, or stored vertically."

What you need is the insulation board stuff, which is rigid.  It's usually pink or blue."
modeltrains,38ggl9,mjvasko,2,Thu Jun 4 01:20:05 2015 UTC,You can mount your buildings to a small base and then mount the whole assembly to the layout.  Something like foamcore works great for this.  You then blend the foamcore base into the surrounding scenery.  If you ever want to remove the building you just pull up the whole assembly.  This has the added advantage of allowing you to work on the building at the bench where it is easier and then place it on the layout when you're done.  It will also allow you to incorporate the building into its base and eliminate that often seen gap around the bottom of the walls.

modeltrains,38fd1s,AMCguy_HOtrains,2,Thu Jun 4 05:29:46 2015 UTC,"Ebay is your most likely way to sell Lionel trains and get the most money. YOu can always create a set or lots and sell them that way, but you often won't get the best money, the more you add to a lot, the less people want to pay, as they have duplicates, cars not worth much, etc. I'd put them in 3-4 car lots and sell them that way. Some model train shops buy estate lots, too, but you may only get 10% of what they are worth to a collector or buyer. Another thing is condition - if they're scratched up, missing the boxes, etc. the value drops off with Lionel collectors, so if they are not extremely mint, the value plummets dramatically. That's just the Lionel market. I work at a model train shop in Virginia, and I see what comes in, and what the boss pays for them. If you can find a single buyer for the entire lot of trains, obviously that is a good way to go. Try Craigslist, people are always advertising they buy trains there, too. Again, you probably won't get top dollar, but it will save you a lot of aggravation if you want to do one sale and done. - Jerry -"

Just ideas? Make a list. Are you doing all industrial, some commercial, some suburban settings, any farm territory? What are your modeling interests? The trolley line is great, many people don't run those. Far as the dead zone, why don't you get some thin foam-core board, many Craft stores carry it in white or black. You can cut it to fit the dead zone, then take it off, add farm or commercial or suburban scenery to it, and try it out. Nothing says what you do RIGHT NOW has to be permanent, if you make it modular, you try out different ideas, see how it blends, if you don't like it, tear off the structures and start over. If you're not ready for the financial investment of track switches yet, you could make a park, or some forest, and like I said, you can do it on foam-core, and actually make multiple cut-outs, and change out the scenery, from farm to housing to industrial, to even trackage, to see how you like it. Many people build a layout, then eventually tear it down and start over because it was missing elements that they wanted later. If you make modular pieces, you can remove them NOW, and put in another modular piece, with different scenery, and store them under the layout ( is the desk really worth saving? ) for future use and changes. Have some FUN with it, get the kids involved in the alternative scenery, too, using some of their ideas. :)  Make a miniature skate park, zoo, race track, tons of things you could do with it, and if you make the inserts modular, you can switch them out for variations and the layout won't get stale. How about some frosted plexiglas for an outdoor ice-skating pond? Do a winter scene! Put some trackage down, and make it an outdoor railroad museum to show-case your collection of engines.

modeltrains,38499r,AMCguy_HOtrains,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:22:46 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of great ideas in here. I remember now I wanted to have a section of track where the tracks would run through dense forest - that'd be pretty cool to do but I'll have to get the landscaping beneath it done first.  The foam core idea - you're suggesting tearing out the plaster where I have my dead zone and replacing it there? That's really not a bad idea - it would give me a lot more accessibility as well and be a lot less of a pain to repair if I had to.  As for the desk, sadly I can't just dump the thing, even though I'd like to. It's a very unique desk (it flips open and stows a typewriter inside) and it belonged to her great-grandfather. It also weighs a ludicrous amount. One way or another I'm getting it out of there though - I cut the legs to my train table to be a comfortable height for me and I want it off the 6"" risers. Maybe I can get a buddy to help me move it to the basement.  Slowly but surely I'm starting to visualize here. Thanks for all your advice!"
modeltrains,38499r,AMCguy_HOtrains,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:40:27 2015 UTC,"Usually an access area is a good idea on any layout, a removable section to get to the farthest part. I'm having that problem with my model train shop's test loop, they are using underneath for storage, and the few times I've had an engine under test break down and stop is...the far corner! GRRRRRRRRRRRR! Anyway, by removing the plaster, you can use temporary or interchangable foam-core sections to try out different ideas, then maybe later, if you want to make one permanent, you can re-plaster the scene in, or over an access hatch. But yes, I think if you're unsure as to what to do next, having an area where you can try out new ideas on your layout is never a bad thing. And your child(ren) can help and create their own sections to try their hand at scenery. Would be a great experience for all, I think. And having it removable on Foam-core board makes it easier to work on instead of bending over the layout constantly, you can work on it anywhere, outdoors, in the kitchen, etc. and just put it in place as needed. Obviously NOT a section that you want live track running on! But just scenery.  Sounds like the desk is a neat antique piece, but that it is seriously in the way where it is now.

The buildings are from the Woodland Scenics city kit, and I've still got a few left to build. I hop I can do more with the trolley line - that dead spot is driving me nuts."
modeltrains,38499r,garethashenden,3,Mon Jun 1 20:08:56 2015 UTC,"Mine is also coming out of a 8 month hibernation.  I got the ""fun"" (for me) part done -- base, rough terrain work, track bed, track, ballasting, and electrical work.  At which point, lacking confidence in my ability to make n-scale scenery look even halfway realistic, I gave the pink foam base a coat of brown paint, and enjoyed running my trains across the great muddy plains.  Then I ended up taking a ""short"" break.  Here's what I'm doing now to keep things going, keeping in mind that as a single guy with no wife or kids, I can leave partially completed projects ""as is, where is"" indefinitely:   Pick a building.  One building.  Do one thing a week to it.  Put the roof on it?  That counts.  One coat of paint?  That counts too.  Doesn't have to be a major step, just something. Pick an area of the layout (or piece of a module, in my case) about the size of a piece of paper, give or take, and do one thing a week.  Add a rock outcropping one week.  Paint it the next.  Add some turf another week. Once you get most of the bugs worked out, run an engine and a couple cars around the layout on occasion to remind yourself why you're doing this.   If your kids are old enough, maybe you can get them involved?  Make ""train time"" part of the weekend?  Build a simple little house for each of them, let them pick the colors and ""help"" you paint it?    For other motivation, one of the ""rural"" channels on dish has a ""trains and locomotives"" show on once a week that's perhaps a bit boring for the kids, but sometimes interesting in seeing how the prototypes did (or do) things, and is also interesting to see the various track-side structures and such.  I'm not sure if other sat/cable carriers have it, or what packages it requires, but something like that might provide some inspiration."

Actually doing anything was beyond by ability at that point, but apparently knowing it was ""my"" model and painted just the way I wanted was enough to keep me feeling involved, which in turn let dad enjoy his hobbies.  Sounds like a similar approach might work for your daughter too.  Instead of a building model, maybe pick up two or three cheap train cars, let her pick what colors they should be, and have ""her"" train run around the layout while you're doing your thing.  Oh, and that plane?  It's probably the ugliest thing I've ever seen.  B-58 ""Hustler"" with orange wings, red tail, green weapons/fuel pod underneath, and a silver fuselage with blue tiger stripes."
modeltrains,38499r,tommy16p,2,Thu Jun 4 16:52:33 2015 UTC,"I started this layout around 2010 or 2011, and I got it to this point and came to a grinding halt. Part of it is because my wife decided to store a huge desk underneath that raised the table 6"" and makes it hard to reach, but partially because I'm not sure where to go from here.  The streetcar loop is the last thing I did. It generally works but I have some continuity issues, particularly at the back part. The town is only loosely laid out and the big open section to the left will eventually be a railyard, but I have to go buy switches and stuff.  My problem is, I'm stuck. I probably haven't touched this thing since my daughter was born in December 2012. I've got some really nice engines (a huge collection) including a 2-truck shay and the KATO Morning Daylight GS-4.

modeltrains,382wvr,RykerGB,3,Mon Jun 1 13:46:58 2015 UTC,I like it. If you're fine without ever having your engines turn around then I think it's a good layout.

I designed an N-scale shelf layout in SCARM, but when I went to lay it out, damn, it's was packed to the gills.  I couldn't get my fingers between cars on adjacent tracks to pick them up or put them on the rails.

We're pretty well covered with the more popular ones (the J2 2-10-0s, K5 4-6-2s, 0-8-0s, and the oddly popular Triplex; However, there's some key locomotives missing, like the 2-8-0s, the 4-6-0s, the 2-8-4s, and the USRA Heavy 2-8-2s. I'd even settle for RTR Stillwell commuter coaches, (so I don't have to buy a ton of Brass and F&C resin kits!) or some re-release of the diesels (like the E8s, the FTs and the F3/7s). Bit of an underloved road compared to the NYC and PRR, but I think it has a lovely charm.  I'd love to see a new tooling of the classic Varney/Rivarossi ""Casey Jones"" 4-6-0 or the Tyco/MRC ""Sierra #3"" 4-6-0. I think there are plenty of kitbashing opportunities out of those two locomotive. I'd also love to see a retooling of Bachmann's USRA 0-6-0 (and variants), something I could see happening one day, considering they're retooling their ""Old West"" 4-4-0s at the moment.  I think from the other side of the pond, I was originally going to say a GWR 10xx ""County"" Class, but I was not aware Hornby made one! I'd love to see more early (pre-1900s, even better would be pre-1860/70s) steam. I know Hornby made a Rocket set a long time ago and Bachmann US makes some early steam sets, but hey, more is better. My unrealistic wish would be somebody (be it Hornby, Bachmann, et.al) doing a Brunel-Gauge set in OO/HO!  I'd also like to see Hornby do a retooling of their staple Holden B12s, as the current tooling is a bit past it's prime and considering how well the D16/3 ""Claude Hamilton""s look from the promo photos...

None of this stuff is good to us modelers, but collectors may like many of those pieces. The Disney one might have special value and definitely the ones with the old packaging, but maybe they were just too common. I can't help with an accurate appraisal.

Now you have a set of three Tyco passenger cars, in Rio Grande livery. THOSE sell very well on Ebay. They weren't common, and they command a good price from Tyco collectors. I'd suspect you could get more than 50-60 on Ebay if you chose to sell them there as a set. The Gilbert HO rolling stock is mostly common variety, there are pieces that bring good money, too, but I don't see any of those. Still, you could get, with the boxes, maybe 7-10 apiece from the right collector. Plasticville stuff is everywhere, some pieces worth more than others. Circus stuff sells well, I see a few pieces mixed in I think. Anyway, of all the items you have pictured there, the Rio Grande passenger set in the red boxes are probably going to bring the most value through Ebay. Let me know if you want to sell them.   ;)  I like Tyco myself, I repair model trains part time at a model train shop, and like to fix these even though they are considered ""toys"" by many operators, but the early Tyco and Mantua trains from the 50's and 60's were surprisingly good quality, and ran well. It was the later 70's and up el cheap-o stuff that lost quality and value, although certain rare pieces bring good money from that time period, too.

For the flat areas I painted using progressively lighter colors fairly thinly. For the roof and similar I drybrushed progressively lighter colors.

A good lube job is probably the most you need to do, if they run great now then there's little that needs to be done.

modeltrains,3790tr,atrainmadbrit,3,Mon May 25 21:25:23 2015 UTC,"Please note: this is my first attempt at a kitbash and the grey paint is a pre-primer of sorts until i can strip it and get it resprayed.  here's a little bit of ""prototype"" information that i came up with, but please keep in mind it's set in an alternate history where BR never happened (so steam would have lasted for much longer), if you are unsure of anything them please ask  So here is the basic concept:  Class: Gresley A2  Class size: 11, #3000-3010 (1 prototype, 10 production locomotives), renumbered #984-994 under Edward Thompson's renumbering scheme  Purpose: Express Mixed Traffic  Power level: 6-7MT  Number of cylinders: 2 (operated by internal cam-valves, most likely Caprotti. Although options such as Lentz are also available)  first built: 1925  Fate: #984, #985 and #990 preserved (#984 preserved by LNER, #985 privately preserved, #990 part of national collection), remainder scrapped.  Description: Originally built as a lone locomotive designed to test the valve gear that would later come to be used on the P2 class of Scottish Mikado locomotives, the locomotive proved so successful that a further ten more were ordered, with amendments made to any problems discovered in the prototype, they were soon put to work on express freights and semi-fast passenger services from London to Scotland, doing the job the unsuccessful Raven A2's failed to achieve,  and were used as the test bed for any advancements in locomotive equipment such as superheaters and roller bearings, one was even fitted with a booster truck, though this was a temporary affair.  during their working life they underwent a number of physical and aesthetic alterations, but between 1925 and 1939/40 the livery was as on the whole the same as with other Gresley non streamlined pacifics, although #3005 was repainted into a unique red-lined Garter Blue livery on an experimental basis.  all locomotives were repainted into Austerity matte black between 1940 and 1945  All Gresley A2s led long, successful careers right up until the early 21st century, when diesels began to take over, they were eventually relegated to slow freights, with three being used as bankers for express goods trains on the Worsbrough Bank. the prototype, #3000, was preserved by the L.N.E.R. for posterity, and frequently hauls specials and the occasional revenue earning express freight The Prototype remained unnamed throughout its life but the ten production A2s were named after industrial locations, with the coat of arms and motto of each town painted on the cab side:  3001 Frodingham Later renamed to 'Scunthorpe' in 1936 with the coat of arms and motto 'The heavens reflect our labours  3002 'Teesside' with coat of arms the motto 'Progress through Unity'  3003 'Newcastle upon Tyne' with coat of arms and the motto 'Triumphing by brave defence'  3004-3010 are yet to be decided  I'm planning to modify the loco to represent 3000 in service condition during the mid-late 2000s, when it was guaranteed a place in preservation, but it was still in regular service, and quite grimy"
modeltrains,3790tr,jagneta,1 point,Mon May 25 21:35:04 2015 UTC,"Certainly an interesting and very well thought out concept. I first saw the picture and was immediately reminded of Raven's A2 with the removal of the external valve gear. Then I read the background, which I think is pretty plausible.  I think the only thing I would have done differently would have been to go with external Caprotti/Lentz vavle gear, like on the P2s (only because I'm not aware of any prototype locomotives that had internal rather than external poppet valves), and potentially smaller driving wheels (better traction or so for freight). I'd imagine this would look something more like a Thompson A2/2, with a change in the placement of the cylinders...  The idea of an alternate history of the UK's railways (post-WWII) is very interesting. Are you sticking with LNER or will we see what the other Big 3 have got going on?  Regardless, this is a very cool project you've got going on. I'm excited to see the final product, whenever that is!  Kudos!"

I currently have a small brewery model that I'd like to incorporate but am open to other ideas. I'd like to have some switching yard operations but am very limited on space so a 2' x 6' shelf-style layout is by far the largest I can build. My goal is to have the ability to connect the mainline at the top with other, modular sections later on.   It has a minimum radius of 18"" with#5 & #6 turnouts. In the future, the mainline with the modular additions will be 24"" min radius.   I'm very new to this hobby and looking for any opinions anyone may have. Does anyone think this layout will provide for some decent operations? I'd like to practice building scenery on this layout so the lake/river will probably have a small mountain behind it so that I can practice designing different scenery effects."

It doesn't leave much operational variety but it can be done."
modeltrains,36zund,Gunner857,7,Sat May 23 15:29:31 2015 UTC,Interesting. Dumb question. Is there enough room to be able to back the locomotive down the track into the locomotive shed area. It looks like you need more track above the points on the line that leads to the  turnable area so you can park the engine while you switch the points. Hope my point is clear.
modeltrains,36zund,riskeverything,5,Sat May 23 15:40:11 2015 UTC,Honestly there is too much going on. The yards are both pretty much inoperable and you can't get anything into the roundhouse. Are you going to have enough cars to fill those yards? Or are they just going to be empty? What does your space look like? Are you wanting to do operations or just run trains? We can definitely get something going. What scale?

modeltrains,36zund,dwwojcik,3,Sat May 23 23:50:18 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest you look at pictures of real life track arrangements and try an include features from those.  For example, here's a picture of a class yard I found on Google.  As you can see, while there's a large number of parallel tracks, there's more of an emphasis on a fewer number of longer tracks.  Another big feature is having a ladder on both ends of the yard.  Railroads always double-end their yards because of how much flexibility it gives them.  Departing trains can pull out from either direction, and two switchers can work on the same train from both ends.  You've got more than enough room to put something like this in.  Just don't be afraid to curve it to make it fit."
modeltrains,36zund,Flizzarn,2,Sun May 24 00:59:01 2015 UTC,"You are so close to having double track all the way around. I would just go for it. Also, for the yard on the left, i love that its separated from the main line but for how big it is it seems a little to isolated. To get back on the main line you would have to back your whole train up. If you just add a switch before the switch that lets into the yard it will allow the train to either go back into the yard or go out onto the main line smoothly. I hope that makes sense. If not i would gladly provide a picture.   Over all i really like it. I love big yards and switching potential."

I like the suggestion of the O scale Bachmann model. It's big and the details are good and it won't make you too crazy to modify it. I just fear that you have described yourself as a noob but you want to take on some advanced stuff right off the bat.

modeltrains,36tf8z,goldfish_herder,2,Thu May 21 23:45:51 2015 UTC,"Bore da!  I recently just got back into it. I went with Hornby because from what I understand the HO/OO gauges have cross-compatible tracks and because Hornby is readily available in the UK.  What I did to start was basically to find a cheap set. I found that Argos was selling the Caledonian Belle for £40 (It's currently £45). I found this to be a nice base to get back into it. I use SCARM to design a track layout I wanted to build and then I went onto eBay and got bargins on all the track pieces I needed (ended up paying about 1/3 the retail value).  Now I picked up an unused Flying Scotsman set on eBay for £60 (only the box was damaged). Maybe you could look into getting something like that instead to start, gives you a bigger base and a nice steam loco and is also DCC compatible if you wanted to go digital down the line.  It was also recomended to myself to take a peek over at the Piko trains as a few other redditors have enjoyed their Piko sets so much."
modeltrains,36tf8z,ThatGuyNamedKal,1 point,Fri May 22 08:22:10 2015 UTC,Try to find local train shows / swap meets in your area - should be able to find your initial rolling stock & track for dirt cheap.
modeltrains,36tf8z,boomhaeur,1 point,Fri May 22 11:31:40 2015 UTC,"Ok, you're giving a wide latitude about your selection. I'm in the Colonies ( USA ), I take it you're over the pond. :) Anyway, you need to set out a few things first, because if you haven't selected a gauge/size yet, you can make some poor decisions buying a first set.     When you say "" coal bunker at the back"", do you mean the back of the engine itself? So in that case, you want a Dock side shunter type, which had the coal stored behind the Engineer, and no tender.   That will make your gauge selection easier, too, as a small engine like that can negotiate tight curves, no matter the gauge or scale. If you wanted a huge steamer, then an O gauge engine would require a 12-16 foot diameter turn-around, maybe not space you have. So you need to pick the engine, then the gauge/scale, and see if your home/apartment has the necessary room for it.    After that, there are some really nice sets out there these days, with good running engines that are reliable. Analog DC or digital DCC ? Do you plan to just run it on a home layout, or do you want to join a club later? DCC works wonders on a huge layout, but unless you're going to be running multiple engines at once, you don't need it on a home layout. But you can always buy DCC-ready engines, and even if they come equipped with a DCC Decoder, they will still operate on regular analog DC voltage, too, a big benefit. Just depends on the amount of money you want to spend. They're more expensive WITH the decoder, and will limit what other items you can purchase ( cars, track, power, etc. ) So you also need to decide if you're going to be a one-engine, home-layout operator, or go full-out with a DCC compatible engine. YOu can buy some sets with the DCC engine probably for L250, but I don't know prices over where you are. Passenger service, or freight? Another choice. Passenger cars are more expensive than the freights. With an engine with attached coal bunker, I don't think you'll be able to pull much passenger equipment, anyway.    Can't say I know much about Hornby, other than they seem to be solid locomotives, I've worked on just a few here in the USA. I do repair work in a model train shop part-time. Mostly HO and O gauge items, some N, some Marklin, Fleischmann, Lima, and other overseas makers I've touched a few times. It's a great hobby, but you need to map out the size of the space you have, and then see if you can fit the trackwork you may want into that depending on the scale of the trains you haven't bought yet. No point in buying O if you're in a tiny apartment, unless you're just going to do point-to-point transfers and switching. It all depends on your mindset, so you need to write down what YOU are interested in first, then see if what you want will fit in with your space limitations and budget. Good luck!

modeltrains,365w0w,DanknessMyst,5,Sat May 16 13:17:19 2015 UTC,"I am in the UK, there seem to be a lot of start-ups here with people making their own stuff and selling it on Ebay. Usually plaster, resin or metal casting. Some is very good and some of it seems badly planned and executed. I am always looking for detail items that escape the modelling clichés that turn up on too many exhibition layouts.  A big problem is model people. A lot of the better quality collections are very limited in scope and clichéd. Some of the moulds used date back to the sixties with very little innovation since (see Airfix and Wills kits) but still make very nice models. I prefer to paint metal castings than buy the bizarrely coloured plastic models from Germany, by companies such as Faller and Noch. No-one in post war UK (=steam trains) would wear those colours and even modern streets just aren't that bright.  You might do well with the twiddly details, plants, flowers and garden features, workshop detailing, small animals etc rather than large items that the big companies have covered. It would be nice to have tree armatures that don't snap when you catch them with a sleeve. This kind of stuff is very expensive but after you have splashed out a few thousand for train and track spending a bit extra to get fine detailing right no longer matters.  I don't know if UK products make it to the US but you might research; Harburn Hobbies, Dart Castings, Exclusive First Editions and Langley Models as well as the market leaders like Hornby and Bachmann.  Some small companies are producing loco body kits that fit regular models but may be fantasy, scifi or specific to an area or industry neglected by the mass-producers. You may make profit from this type of  niche-market product.  For top-quality scenery (at a price!) look at Woodland Scenics which is a US based company."
modeltrains,365w0w,BagOfBrokenBits,4,Sat May 16 15:30:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you for providing such a great insight into your experiences.  Model people isn't an area I had considered but I will definitely look into it. It would certainly be a very challenging area for me to tackle.  I'll have to spend some time going through all the companies you listed.  When you mention cliché items, as I'm not familiar with the norms, could you expand a little here. What's an example of something not so typical you've found?  And what do you see too much of?  Thanks again"
modeltrains,365w0w,BagOfBrokenBits,4,Sat May 16 17:18:26 2015 UTC,"For example, it seems that all model railway stations will have a man in a trilby and a long coat running for the train, even when the train pulled out 15 minutes ago. And the guard waving off the long-gone train. I hate that guy! I will never model a person running for a train. It is too clichéd. For that I want people just sitting and standing around looking bored. But lots of them.  All churches have a wedding and/or a funeral. (Mine has a sheep keeping the grass short!) I can pick out the Dapol brand of people wherever they turn up. The choice is so limited they turn up on every exhibition layout. I want about a hundred people for my cattle market scene. This would be the focal event of UK village life in the time frame I am modelling, a handful of figures just doesn't hack it.  I took a set of Langley white metal choirboys and carved/filed them into dairy-maids for my dairy and have the outgoing shift waiting at the station halt.  It was really hard to get soldiers without guns drawn for my military railway. I like the Langley white metal model people because they can be filed and reshaped. I took a set of cricketers and made the umpires into market auctioneers in my cattle market and the players became soldiers playing cricket behind the barracks. A set of soccer players became soldiers doing PT. It is a joint UK-US military base, in terms of trains and other hardware, but so far I have no specifically US soldiers to populate it.  I have a schoolboy in uniform set. I have the boys throwing rocks into a pool away from the market whilst the girls from the matching schoolgirl set are doing ""The Three Ashley"" thing - three girls walk in a line and block the space completely oblivious of anyone else. I also have boys playing with go-carts on the hill above the dairy which is a Langley set that I haven't seen anywhere else.  If you look on Youtube you will see examples of Exhibition layouts and of course the UK market is not like that in the US. Not many people would want the military stuff alongside the country life stuff that I am modelling. In the US you have brilliant examples of logging and mining railway layouts that are unlike anything we have. I assume people modelling those struggle to find appropriate figures in a similar way as myself. Rather than the UK based stuff I am writing about this might be a better area of research for your needs."

You'll need something better than your hobby-grade FDM/FFF printer -- the layer ridges that those leave are going to be massive compared to the detail you're trying to get, and will require more finishing than you probably want to deal with.  If you're looking to just build models and have them professionally printed on demand, go look at Shapeways and see what's selling and getting good reviews.  Or better yet, see what's selling, getting bad reviews, and make better versions."

modeltrains,365w0w,BagOfBrokenBits,3,Sun May 17 16:34:28 2015 UTC,"Having had time to think about the 3D printing process, this probably isn't the best method for the small parts I described earlier.  Maybe scenic ""flats"" would be more suited to 3D printing. These are low profile building fronts, backs, sides, to make up part of the backscene without taking up any layout space. They could be made paintable, about one eighth to half an inch deep and would be very useful. As some modellers are currently decoupaging the packaging from other models onto their backscenes a range of nicely made building flats would probably be in demand."
modeltrains,365w0w,BagOfBrokenBits,1 point,Sun May 17 09:37:32 2015 UTC,Yeah that's more along the lines of what I was thinking before I started this thread . I'd also be much better at modelling building facades. So what era should I be looking? If you could link me a picture of real buildings you'd like that'll be really awesome.  I'm also from the UK so what you think of the market is very relevant.
modeltrains,365w0w,BagOfBrokenBits,2,Sun May 17 16:53:52 2015 UTC,"I made the mistake (again) of assuming you were in the US. Apologies. I responded to the original question with that belief in mind.  A large part of the UK market is men like me in their fifties modelling steam from the ""Big Four"" maybe with earlier green diesels. A growing part of the market is younger people modelling ""Modern Image"". If you look on Youtube you can see exhibition layouts from all over the UK. Hornby is the UK market leader so take a look at their website, Bachmann buildings use a lighter colour palette and their buildings are more detailed, hence more fragile and more expensive. I think Hornby have got it right.   I model the LNER and I like red brick buildings as the main theme mixed with some white rendered buildings. I think that Great Western modellers will go for more stone buildings. People are going for a regional character that matches that of their trains. On another thread I was able to discern what locos were being run by the modelled architecture. For the serious, adult modeller this does have to be right.  I would say that Victorian/Edwardian frontages cover most of the country especially in the Steam Era. Buildings could be the backs of houses as seen on any train journey or the sides/rears of factories or railway buildings. It would help if they were modular, fitting into whatever space is available by trimming with a Stanley knife.  As for specific buildings just web search, I am sure you will find hundreds. It just a case of coming up with a set that goes together. So nothing too extreme, noticeable or detailed. I differentiate between foreground and background modelling. Anything in the rear needs to be slightly smaller, and less detailed than anything to the front to create false perspective. Also the palette would be more muted unless I'm creating a flash of colour to draw the eye. You really thought we just played trains, didn't you ;-)  You might want to contact your local railway modellers club for opinions of prototypes."

modeltrains,365w0w,AppleBerryPoo,2,Sun May 17 18:10:01 2015 UTC,"In the UK we mostly use OO gauge which (without checking) is, 1:76. Everywhere else uses Ho which (again without checking) is 1:87. N gauge is much smaller and O is much bigger. If you are able to offer stuff in OO and n it might be well received.   Most of the buildings you see in that video are Metcalfe card kits The water towers are Wills kits. Metcalfe kits are very nice but seem to age badly. In my occasionally steamy home I fear they would absorb damp so I don't use them.  It's a very nice layout and typical of the UK scene, any new products would have to fit in with what you see there unless it was niche market stuff that I mentioned earlier.  It isn't polite to laugh at peoples layout. They take hundreds of hours and can cost hundreds of pounds to put together. Watch lots of videos, you will see some very skilled work.

I doubt you'll be able to quiet it down too much, just since it's so old, but lubing definitely won't hurt.   For the track, I'd start with a simple soap and water soak, though I'm not sure how well that'd work on cigarette tar.  I imagine rubbing alcohol would be fine if you need something stronger."

I tried taking the locomotive apart to service it a bit as I'm pretty decent at electrical bits and bobs (I'm a vaping hobbyist so I have plenty of magnifiers, tools, etc) and because I wanted to try to get the smoke unit working again... but I didn't get very far.

modeltrains,360tro,Rayd8630,1 point,Tue May 19 01:31:00 2015 UTC,"For the track try taking a rag with a bit of rubbing alcohol to the rails. That might remove the gunk on the rail heads that I know has a built of a weird smell to it (its caused by arching between the train wheels and the track). Unless you mean they themselves smell like cigarette smoke or kitchen smoke. In which case I have never encountered that problem. Only thing I could think of is mask the rails and paint over the bases with some colour but depending on what that smoke is, it might not let the paint adhere correctly. Water with dish soap I can just see corrosion problems in the future with water and soap getting trapped in weird places such as under the rails between the ties. Drying with compressed air and then rubbing alcohol on the rails to remove any residue might work to fix that problem but now im just naming ideas off the the top of my head that I have never done. As I said Ive never had this problem before.  If its an old loco and hasnt run in a while, its safe to say whatever they used (probably some cheap grease if even that) when it was built is probably dried up and the motor may be trying to overcome it. If you can, pop the shell and while being very delicate, clean the insides up and put some fresh oil down. You should use the oil thats sold in a hobby shop BUT in a pinch ive used electric trimmer oil with decent success. If its running then stopping that might be a track connector issue. Ive noticed that EZ track like all pre-roadbedded tracks can often have problems with the rail connectors lining up when the roadbed is locked together. Take a pair of needle nose pliers and GENTLY (cannot stress this enough) compress the connectors until the ends arent sticking up and a rail can guide in smoothly. Maybe take the time to see if they are level and use the pliers to adjust that too.  Some of these connectors may need replacing and a local hobby shop should sell packs of them for cheap. They just slide off and back on. Then when you rejoin the track pay attention to the connectors- make sure the rail slides in to them and doesnt bend the connector or as I have even seen, push the rail forward on the ties."
modeltrains,360tro,AMCguy_HOtrains,1 point,Mon May 18 04:34:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the tips! I definitely need to replace all of the connectors on this track. I noticed quite a few of them were bent minorly that made marrying the track pieces a huge pain in the ass. I'll have to put that on my list of ""supplies to buy"" along with some terminal connectors so I can try using bare track instead of having to always use this EZ track stuff. :x  I've gotten some hobby oil and oiled the motor and the engine runs much better but the track itself seems to be the issue now so I'm going to make sure to follow your tips.  Do you think doing a soak for a few hours in rubbing alcohol would damage the track or plastic roadbed? I was thinking of doing a soak and then scrubbing the tracks themselves with a soft cloth. It seems like the smoke smell's seeped into the plastic of the road bed and it seems like rubbing alcohol is a good way to get rid of or mitigate it.  I'm looking to eventually get a more serviceable engine (it looks like this one isn't really intended to be taken apart) so I can do maintenance on it myself and I'd also want a smoke unit in it.

If this is the kind of reaction he has when he can't buy a model, he needs therapy before he is required to react to something of consequence.

I love long trains like this - they just feel so much more correct than the really short trains that you'll commonly see.   I am curious, though - how would the train have run differently if you had put all five of the consisted locomotives at the front of the train?"
modeltrains,35ns34,DietSeth,5,Tue May 12 15:23:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I agree, and thankfully the club layout is large enough to make it possible.  With all the power at the front it will still run fine on 99% of the layout, but we have a helix that is about a 1.2% grade I believe. When the entire train gets onto that you'll usually have a coupler somewhere let go at the slightest bump or uneven point in the trackwork. Atlas' Accumate couplers are usually the culprit for me, but when they work fine on 99% of the track it doesn't seem worth it to go changing every single coupler over to something better."
modeltrains,35ns34,DietSeth,4,Tue May 12 15:57:17 2015 UTC,"Ahh, that would make sense - I hadn't thought about all the weight that would be put on the couplers while going up an incline. Neat. Thanks for the response!"
modeltrains,35ns34,reddRad,2,Tue May 12 18:29:13 2015 UTC,"This is a 61 car Burlington freight train that I used as a guinea pig for testing out distributed power. At these lengths the weight of the consist can show weak links in the coupler chain if you try to tackle an incline, of which my club's permanent layout has many. When you have all your motive power at the front of a train your speedmatching doesn't need to be that amazing, but when split up you're going to have problems if it isn't.  The way I ran this train was a U25B, a C30-7 & an SD24 at the front, an SD45 roughly in the middle then another SD24 towards the end. Obviously all locos are powered here, no dummies, and all are in a consist. I organised it like this so that if the lead locos encountered a dead spot or something, the SD45 and rear SD24 would not have enough quite grunt to bring in all the slack and cause a derailment. This worked quite well, and the only issue I encountered was that the locos just happened to be spaced in such a way that they bridged both ends of a reversing loop. :)"

modeltrains,35j3p5,jared213,3,Sun May 10 21:39:32 2015 UTC,"I'd go with HO, since it tends to give the best balance of size, quality, and price.  I got started with an HO set when I was a bit older than that (which may make me a little biased I guess).    Your budget might be a bit of an issue, since as a general rule you get what you pay for.  But if you're good at looking for used/eBay deals, you should be able to find something.  Generally anything that would retail for less than $100 will be pretty low quality.  Avoid Life-Like starter sets like the plague.  Avoid sets that include ""freebies,"" like signs, bridges and other scenery like that, since that generally means that the quality of the actual train will be lower.  Try to find a set that's just a loop of track, a transformer, a locomotive, and a few cars."

They have metal handrails and are a bit older so they're usually easy on the wallet. Look for blue box and round house rolling stock kits as well as these don't have fine details that can be broken easily. Atlas Code 100 track will most likely be the best bet for your money as well.

Because sometimes a set may be cheaper than buying all separate. The benefit to buying separate is you get what you want.   http://www.modeltrainstuff.com/HO-Scale-Train-Sets-s/334.htm?searching=Y&sort=3&cat=334&show=300&page=1  Handful of sets under $100 there.

The inclines are a total of 3 inches from each level to the next (up or down) and according to the program work out to ~7 degrees, but it is a concern.

The yard is going to be a matter of personal taste, and the equipment you're planning on running.  If you're shifting short 40' cars around, you obviously don't need as much yard space as if you were moving 89' autoracks.  If you're using small power and short cars, the yard may be small but not ""too small"".  7 degrees is something around 12% slope.  Not something I would do, but if your locos can manage it and you're happy with the performance & reliability, then go for it."

modeltrains,34xpsy,BagOfBrokenBits,1 point,Tue May 5 13:34:52 2015 UTC,"Do you think the thickness of the wire has something to do with it? I'll try to close them tighter, do you have any idea what it could be if that's not the issue? Is the connection on those connectors not suited for such a thin cable?"
modeltrains,34xpsy,BagOfBrokenBits,2,Tue May 5 13:44:29 2015 UTC,Could be that if dropper is really thin then the metal bit isn't slicing through the insulation. I use the same wire for droppers as I do the bus (1.5 mm in English) The scotch connectors are specified at different sizes too. I think the smallest are yellow. Medium is blue and the largest is red. I use red for the power bus and blue with thinner wire for lighting etc.
modeltrains,34xpsy,BagOfBrokenBits,2,Tue May 5 13:49:49 2015 UTC,"I tried using one of the connectors to see if it pierces the insulation, and it doesn't really seem to make a clean cut because the cable is only 1mm thick.  Is there any other type of connector I could use? Using thicker than 1 mm cable is really hard to work with I feel."
modeltrains,34xpsy,Dascandy,1 point,Tue May 5 14:06:53 2015 UTC,Some people just cut the bus wire and solder the dropper and another length of bus at each junction. I think this approach may build up resistance in the bus which will affect train running on a large layout. I think that the scotch lock method is used because it doesn't build up electrical resistance which is also why thick wires are used.  I would recommend that you use thicker dropper wires. They can be awkward at the point where they are soldered to the track but it's a manageable task.  Solder the droppers before you lay the track. Drill the baseboard holes for the wire rather than make the wires fit the holes. When you make the connection try laying the wire along the length of the track and clipping it with a crocodile clip whilst you do the soldering and bend it to vertical afterwards. If the solder connection is raised after it has been soldered just file it down with a needle file.

modeltrains,34xpsy,PM_ME_YOUR_CHESTHAMS,1 point,Tue May 5 14:36:56 2015 UTC,If you hold a track pin (in needle nose pliers) against a sleeper and put the tip of your soldering iron against it you can melt a hole to suit yourself.

modeltrains,34xpsy,Dascandy,2,Tue May 5 16:03:15 2015 UTC,How do you remove the white glue if you decide to change your track arrangement? Lay a towel dunked in hot water on top of it for some time?
modeltrains,34xpsy,PM_ME_YOUR_CHESTHAMS,1 point,Wed May 6 15:03:09 2015 UTC,No. I think that would cause more mess than it's worth. If you have the track pinned down and tested and you lay it properly you won't have to move it. If I had to move it I would probably use a wide chisel.  If you were removing a section to put in a turnout then you might saw or cut the rail (with xenon track cutters) and lift the track with a chisel. I wouldn't re-use lifted track as it would be too bent and twisted.

modeltrains,347mtx,biffster,5,Tue Apr 28 23:07:09 2015 UTC,"I'm a modeler (dioramas, miniature wargames, etc), not a railroader, so take what I have to say with a huge grain of salt.  It looks good, but it seems a bit dark -- most of the tracks I've seen (in life, and in Google) have very light ballast.  Not all, mind you, so it's possible you're going for that.  The other thing is it looks like the ballast on most tracks (in Goog) is about 3-times as wide as the ties (so, a tie-length on either side).  Still, bad ballast is better than no ballast, and this isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination.  Good job. :)"
modeltrains,347mtx,matneyx,1 point,Tue Apr 28 23:48:55 2015 UTC,Thanks! And thanks for the tip about how wide to make the ballast. I was basically taking a shot in the dark; I'll use your advice and widen it out a lot.
modeltrains,347mtx,DaWolf85,4,Wed Apr 29 01:30:39 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it looks like someone threw a bunch of birdseed on your tracks. I noticed that the first time I looked at it and now I can't unsee it.  There are two things I think you can fix. First, it could be a lot tighter to the tracks - as /u/matneyx said, about a tie-length on either side. I might even go further and do only half a tie-length on each side. Depends what looks good, but it's too spread-out right now.  Second, the color. It's a very odd mix. I would try mixing the colors a little better and see how that looks, but you might also want to use a little less of one color. Also, you might want to try finding some black 'coal' pieces - I know there are some manufacturers that sell this - and replacing the dark color mostly or entirely with that.  Also, just for technique advice, right now it looks a bit like the light color was thrown on, glued down, then some of the dark color was thrown on top. Try mixing them before you put them down. This is what you want it to look like - very evenly mixed, no big clumps of one color. Even where there is a clump of color, it's carefully placed so that it doesn't overwhelm the area."
modeltrains,347mtx,zed857,3,Wed Apr 29 13:31:28 2015 UTC,Two other points as well:   The ballast that the OP used is too coarse/big for the scale of the track; it should be finer/smaller. Paint the track brown before ballasting (it's a little hard to see in the OP's pic - but his track looks unpainted based on the shininess of the ties and the color of the rail joiners near the left edge of the pic).
modeltrains,347mtx,matneyx,2,Wed Apr 29 15:48:28 2015 UTC,"You could use weathering powders -- or just dust scraped off chalk, or chalk pastels -- stippled lightly over everything to blend things together.  Light colors -- dirt and dust -- can be put on pretty heavily, but dark colors -- coal dust -- should be used sparingly as they kind of overwhelm everything."
modeltrains,347mtx,Shdwdrgn,2,Wed Apr 29 15:06:36 2015 UTC,"I am going for a look from my childhood memories, so that probably leaves this open to unrealistic colors right there.  :)  My Grandpa worked for Burlington Northern for all his life, from when he got out of the army after WWII, all the way through when he died at the too-young age of 59. Papo would take me down to the train tracks behind our house and tell me about why he loved trains and railroads and working on the line. In my memory, the ballast was coal - or at least as black as coal - to my 7-year old eyes. Or (more likely) I am conflating images of the ballast and what the trains carried (almost nothing but coal hoppers, we lived close to a coal mining area).  Anyway, my minds eye lends towards darker ballast, but I also can tell that there should be lighter gravel in it too. Hence, my question.  The closest example I could find is at:  http://www.hdwallpapersimages.com/wp-content/uploads/images/2001/Train-Tracks-Images-540x337.jpg"
modeltrains,347mtx,Shdwdrgn,3,Wed Apr 29 01:29:01 2015 UTC,"I've been reading up on various aspects of steam-era railroads, and there's a few things to consider...  The age of the railroad has a lot to do with the color -- if it hasn't been well maintained, the ballast will be very dirty.  General operations can leave a lot of oil on the track from the locos, so your memories of coal-black ballast might have been from the oil track down the center of the line?  Also the area you are remembering could have simply been a place where coal was spilled on the track and then pushed out of the way.  It also depends greatly on what kind of rock is available locally.  I remember areas where the ballast just looked like driveway gravel.  Here in Colorado the ballast appears to be a mixture of bright white and a deep purple rock.  Really the best solution would be to not trust your memory, but rather try to find color pictures of the BN from the time period you want to model, and see what they were using then.  And once you have some ballast down, you can dirty-up some areas to show less-maintained tracks.  Also the post above about the ballast being 3x the width of the track?  Yeah that's way to wide.  At MOST I would think 2x the tie width, but even that is pushing it.  I've seen some areas where the ballast starts sloping off right at the edge of the ties.  But again, it all depends on the location and how many years of old ballast have been pushed out of the way."

modeltrains,347mtx,Krauj95,2,Wed Apr 29 04:53:57 2015 UTC,"Ballast is always white/grey when it is laid down, the reason it turns brown/black is because of dust from the trains braking. (At least here in Norway)"
modeltrains,347mtx,ZenKeys88,2,Wed Apr 29 06:58:14 2015 UTC,"I use different colours for different tracks. Mainline tracks have a pinkish blend of local granite that is neatly laid in a generous depth. Branch lines have a sandy blend of fish-tank gravel with more scattered coal and debris and with grass growing through, laid slightly lumpy, uneven and thin in places. Industrial sidings get minimal thin grey ballast and signs of neglect and spillage.

This is really nice to allow switching the yard without blocking the main line.  My only suggestion is that you now have very little space for parking rolling stock.  There are really only 3 nice spurs, plus two tiny ones by what looks like the main yard.  In the main yard, you have two run-around tracks, which isn't really necessary.  You only need one, especially since the second is so small as to be nearly worthless.  I'd use that space for another spur/yard track."

However, if it's older (say, pre-80s) OO scale equipment, it might. This is because OO scale trains used to have notoriously deep flanges that would play up on US-style swiches and code 83 (and lower) track. The move from ""toy"" trains to ""scale model"" trains by Hornby and others, the mass-manufacturer of code 70 track by Peco, and more scale flanges on the models themselves has largely ended this.  So, if you're running anything made within the past 30 years or so, you'll be fine. If not, you may want to consider replacing wheelsets."

My suggestions, not DC specific.     Pick a connector type and stick to it -- I like anderson power poles, but they're not cheap. Pick a wiring color scheme, and stick with it -- don't grab that purple wire because you're almost done and ran out of green (or whatever colors).  This will just cause you problems down the road. Use labels too. You can never have too many track feeders. Heat shrink tubing is neater than electrical tape, but you have to remember to put it over one of the wires before you make a connection.

I want to use JMRI to allow friends and visitors to drive the trains with their android/iphones.    There is a reverse loop through the turntable, so this raises some questions from my inexperience.   On the instruction for reverse loops, it usually says the reverse loop must be the entire length of the train, why is this?  Second, where is the best place to put the reverse circuit?"
modeltrains,342a4l,Shdwdrgn,3,Mon Apr 27 19:16:20 2015 UTC,"Not really related to your question, but if I'm reading the plan right, you've got a 10% grade on the straightaway on the bottom of the outer loop which is kind of ridiculous and will almost definitely need to be reworked."

modeltrains,34193c,BagOfBrokenBits,2,Tue Apr 28 15:22:20 2015 UTC,I am in the UK. All my locos are 00. I understand this is the less accurate gauge that was used here historically because they couldn't make the motors small enough. I do have one blue diesel that is HO but I won't chip it. I will probably save it for spares.
modeltrains,34193c,BagOfBrokenBits,2,Tue Apr 28 21:13:37 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, It's your layout do whatever you like. I like to see what others are doing even if I am never going to do it myself.

Any locally bought DCC controller will work for this train once it is chipped, theoretically. Take advice from your local dealer or do good online research.  UK trains are generally OO gauge which makes them appear big when next to HO models, but they run on the same track as you will buy in the US.  If you are using an analogue controller the Pendolino will work straight out of the box without modification in the US. (But always check voltages) Edit: As Peanuts writes below."
modeltrains,33zmh1,bach123479,2,Mon Apr 27 03:01:07 2015 UTC,Some of the tank cars coming off of my work bench after being in the works for the last couple months. Too many more to finish up and finally put on my roster. The OMYA cars are my first attempts at pastel/acrylic paint weathering and could be so much better.
modeltrains,33zmh1,dharmadrummer,2,Mon Apr 27 03:04:34 2015 UTC,Where did you get your OMYA cars? I can't find them anywhere.
modeltrains,33zmh1,dharmadrummer,2,Tue Apr 28 18:34:34 2015 UTC,"A couple of ways. Watch eBay! I've found 99% of mine there. Google for them too. The best way I have found them through Google is find the reporting marks that were produced and search for them that way. PM me and I can give you all of the reporting marks ever produced. I have the 14k gal. kaolin tankers from Atlas, the 16k gal tanks from Walthers, the single 4 bay ACF hopper from Bachmann and the 5000 cu. ft. PressureAide hoppers from Atlas. I have all of the production ones except for UTLX 24006 from Walthers and ACFX 51615 from Atlas. Aside from the production cars, I've picked up as many undecorated kits from eBay as I can afford, painted them and slapped some Highball graphics on them. The three that I have pictured are undecorated kits that are modeled after real OMYA cars as best I can. When I get home tonight I can post pics for you with all the ones I have made up. You can buy already decorated kits too, like the J.M. Huber tanks or Georgia Kaolin ones, soak them in 91% or 99% isopropyl alcohol to strip the paint off (don't worry, it's COMPLETELY plastic safe!) and paint your own. I would highly suggest that if you have access to taking pictures of OMYA cars, do so. There are so many variants that you can't pick up from rrpicturearchive, and this way it makes your cars unique to your own experience! I have hundreds of my own recon photos if you need any help! Happy hunting!"
modeltrains,33zmh1,Vermont204,2,Tue Apr 28 19:14:52 2015 UTC,Thanks. I'm a little leery of using ebay so I may end up using decals on an undecorated. The paper mill across from my house gets them all the time so I just need to stop being lazy.
modeltrains,33zk77,Alwayshaveaquestion,2,Mon Apr 27 02:40:15 2015 UTC,"Building on what /u/reddRad said, I think when designing your track plan you should look to reality when designing your plan.  Your yard designs, while technically functional, don't look realistic at all, and probably won't allow for realistic operation, which could be a problem if that's what you're going for."
modeltrains,33zk77,dwwojcik,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:15:49 2015 UTC,So what would make it more realistic.  I absolutely want a realistic looking layout.
modeltrains,33zk77,dwwojcik,1 point,Tue Apr 28 00:40:47 2015 UTC,"Try looking up pictures of rail yards on google.  Ideally, if you can squeeze it in, there'll be a ladder on both ends.  You need a nice long yard lead for the switcher to pull cars out on without hitting the mainline, and a caboose track and an engine shed.   Also, try adding a few spurs around to build industries on so you can do some switching.  If you like I can sketch out some diagrams of what I have in mind if I have time later."
modeltrains,33zk77,dwwojcik,1 point,Tue Apr 28 00:54:27 2015 UTC,Ideally i want a layout that i can run 25 car trains around and do swithing if possible.
modeltrains,33zk77,reddRad,1 point,Tue Apr 28 02:08:45 2015 UTC,"Sure.  Basically I'm just saying make one big yard, ideally at least partially double ended, and more realistic trackwork."
modeltrains,33zk77,_ps,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:02:19 2015 UTC,"For realism, I like following railroad tracks on Google maps and looking for yards and interchanges and industries the tracks service.  You can see how yards are built and so forth.  Of course, with a circle on a table, it's tough to duplicate real life, but generally, people like to put one or two towns, each with a small yard, and perhaps a few other spurs for industries.  Your spur at the bottom is nice, maybe service a couple businesses at the end.  But the two (or three?) yards are too crammed together.  The two at the top seem like separate yards because of the two leads into them.  That rarely happens in real life, as it's harder to sort cars from one to the other.  And the one just below has to be a second town, since it's on the opposite side of the loop, but it's way too close to the top yard(s), unless you can squeeze a visual break between the two."
modeltrains,33zk77,reddRad,1 point,Tue Apr 28 01:01:48 2015 UTC,"awesome! You are so close to making it a double main, I would go for it."
modeltrains,33xjrl,CHanyy,5,Sun Apr 26 16:28:46 2015 UTC,"Looks good.  Just a few things   Make sure your tunnels have access points so you can fix derailments. Make sure you buy equipment that can navigate 18"" curves.  A lot of modern equipment is pretty long and might have issues with curves that tight. If you weren't considering it already, think about making the crossing on the left a single/double slip switch (it looks like you might have done that but it's hard to tell) I did a quick photoshop of an idea that might give you a little more room for an industry on the right side, and give you the incline/decline you were looking for.  Basically the whole grey section would be elevated above the rest of the track with grades up the back straight and the right side loop.  This would give you the whole back corner to work with for an industry since you can build on top of the tunnel rather than having to deal with a hillside.  Plus, having your layout cross over itself with bridges looks freakin cool.   But yeah, this looks like a great start, I'd look forward to seeing your progress."
modeltrains,33xjrl,scoobyduped,3,Sun Apr 26 17:14:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input!   The access points might be hard, as that part of the layout is up against a wall. I'll have to think of something there.  The stuff I have should work on 18"", though not pretty, but I want the continous loop so it'll have to do. Single/double slip switch? Not sure about the english lingo there. Using the woodland scenics risers, wouldn't I need 18 feet for it to work?"
modeltrains,33xjrl,kent_eh,2,Sun Apr 26 17:46:36 2015 UTC,"The access points might be hard, as that part of the layout is up against a wall. I'll have to think of something there.    Perhaps leave it open from the bottom.  Or make part of the ""mountain"" removable for access."
modeltrains,33xjrl,scoobyduped,1 point,Sun Apr 26 22:02:24 2015 UTC,"Slip switches can act as a crossing and either one or two switches.  A double slip switch would let trains go to your passenger yard and your second platform directly from your mainline.  With a single slip switch you'd need to choose one of the connections.    As far as the grade goes, you might be right, I'd forgotten how much space grades take up.  You'd need 16 feet with a 2% grade, or 12 feet with a 3% grade (a bit less actually since you don't quite need the full 4 inches of elevation, but not enough to make a huge difference).  Still, I'd say it'd be worth playing around in SCARM to see if you can get something to work."
modeltrains,33xjrl,Jeff_Faust,4,Sun Apr 26 18:17:41 2015 UTC,"18"" is going to be kinda tight for modern equipment. It'd be fine with 40' freight cars and 4-axle roadswitchers."
modeltrains,33xjrl,Jeff_Faust,1 point,Sun Apr 26 18:51:07 2015 UTC,"Tight works, it doesn't necessarily have to be pretty in the curve, as long as I can make it into a full loop.

That can provide an operational benefit-- it represents ""the outside world"".   You could even design it so that the end of that track section is disguised on the layout's normal viewing angle (hidden in a tunnel or behind buildings) so you can and set it up as a removable module-- run a train into the corner, remove the whole module-- track, cars, and all, for tidy storage, then snap in a different one to bring new equipment on."

Daily ebay searches, asking friends to keep an eye out. No luck for 2+ years. 5 months ago I called MTH to see if it was going to be released again(it was in the 2014 catalog). The lady on the phone said it had been postponed indefinitely....but they could still take an order!! I almost drank the kool-aid and was ready to buy the Overland Brass set...even though it was 4 times as expensive....and was still hard as hell to find. Turns out, I just happen to call a local shop I thought went out of business a long time ago...and boom. They had one still in the cardboard packing box as if it had just arrived from MTH. The person who originally ordered it 2 years previously got upset waiting to long and didn't pay for it. WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER! Now I just need to find at least 150 HO scale figures to populate the cars. I've ordered the RPO, and baggage car from Con-Cor to round out the entire manifest."

These are from the Hornby ""RAILROAD"" Range, And are generally lower build quality. By all means though if you are wanting to dip your feet into the water this is the starting point.

modeltrains,33fs6g,wozzy93,3,Wed Apr 22 05:58:07 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to put in my two cents here. I took a peak at your profile and it seems like your located in the UK. From my travels to Germany, Poland, and France, I noticed that the ""main"" scale used in Europe is HO. Hornby Railroad; as beautiful as the set you chose is, are a lower quality build just  like /u/texiun kindly pointed out. My suggestion is to also look at the German Piko models. I myself have a few Piko sets and all I can say is that the quality is very decent. I tend to let my train set run for hours while I'm browsing reddit or doing chores. I would say that my Piko set probably has a good 250-300 hours of run time in the past year with not one problem (unlike my German car) except for a few derailments. Now if you don't mind spending a little more or buying American, Kato USA has beautiful well built HO train sets, they are very detailed but can get a bit pricy. What  I would also look into (which I recently just bought my first set) are O scale trains. Moderately larger but are extremely awesome. And just like HO, moderately priced depending on which brand you choose. I'm new to /r/railroads but I will post some of my trains very soon. If you have any questions, feel free to ask, I have been into trains for most of my life and I'd be happy to give you any advice you need."

They are warmly recommended, from what I've used them (Been laying them out on the floor and fooling around for a few hours then packing it up), I have had nothing but pleasure from my sets."
modeltrains,33fs6g,Texiun,2,Wed Apr 22 15:17:52 2015 UTC,"Another thing you may see a lot about is ""DCC"" DCC is the new standard in model railroading and each of your trains either come fitted or can be fitted with a DCC Decoder. This allows you to run trains at different speeds. backwards or forwards, Stopped etc etc. Check out this video here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lC02g72NMRA  If possible try and buy trains that are DCC ready :) While it's a little bit more expensive to begin with. You are saving money in the long run.   Hope this provides a bit of help :)"
modeltrains,33fs6g,Texiun,2,Wed Apr 22 09:25:04 2015 UTC,"Ideally would prefer to get into something like this from the start, as you said, to save money in the long run - however I could buy it and never touch the set again. So something like this is DCC compatible?  As I understand it, if I wanted to convert a regular DC track layout to DCC it's the loco and the controller that would need to be changed. Is that correct?  If this is the case I could just start with a cheap DC set to sink my teeth into and mess around with track layouts before I get a nice DCC loco and upgrade the controller. Right?"

modeltrains,3390zf,WhateverJoel,1 point,Mon Apr 20 23:52:08 2015 UTC,Interesting. Who used to set the standards? The NMRA?
modeltrains,3390zf,fotbr,3,Tue Apr 21 00:56:10 2015 UTC,"Nope.  Steiner invented Free-moN as (I believe, but may be wrong) an off-shoot of the Free-mo (HO) standard, also not invented by NMRA.  Different goals for the layout; NMRA's goals for modules are focused on setting up the donut at a show and having multiple trains running at all times.  Which is not a bad goal, it's just different that the goals for for Free-moN."
modeltrains,3390zf,WhateverJoel,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:12:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Seems like Free-mo is a great way to have a semi-portable layout at your house that's more interesting than the doughnut the other standards used to be.  Are modelers separating themselves from the NRMA en-masse like railfans are with the NRHS, or is it just the one thing?"
modeltrains,3390zf,fotbr,2,Tue Apr 21 15:58:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's any sort of mass exodus.  The NMRA approach to modules works very well at showing running trains, but it isn't the most realistic setup, which is where some of the other module types excel.  A bunch of super-realistic scenery is nice to look at, but at a train show, seeing trains running is just as important, if not more so.  For example, years ago, going to train shows with dad as a kid, seeing the train crossing a bridge or going through the tunnel was more fun than just looking at the bridge or mountain.  Not having to wait ""forever"" (in little kid time) for another train to come by was also important to a much younger me.  The NMRA does a hell of a lot more than just their module standards, and what they do, they do pretty well; being a member, or adopting some of their practices and standards doesn't mean you have to do everything by their book.  I don't think it's fair to draw any sort of conclusions about the organization because of the existence of a few different module standards with different goals."
modeltrains,3390zf,WhateverJoel,1 point,Tue Apr 21 16:50:25 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. I just asked because I knew the NRHS was basically falling apart, so I wasn't sure if the NRMA was experiencing the same issues or not."
modeltrains,3390zf,sn44,2,Tue Apr 21 18:57:29 2015 UTC,"Yep, fotbr hit the nail on the head.  Ntrak and such are 'for the crowd', trains running in circles round and round.  Free-moN is 'for the operator'.  We have single mains, passing sidings, long gentle curves, wye's, yards, active industries, basically real world trackage.  Essential, the show allows us space to set up and have a giant operating session with spectators.    Kid's follow the trains for a lap or so then run off.  But the grownups (those without kid's pulling them away) end up staying for hours watching us coordinate trains through the wye, shunt cars, and of course highball from destination to destination.   I especially enjoy handing the throttle over to those who've been watching intently, asking them if they'd run my train up to the next signal.  Their eyes glisten."

The only issues I have found is that the engine has a piece broke off in the front and it is missing its drive shafts.  I applied power to the trucks but nothing.  However, the motor works with direct power to it so I need to figure out why it won't power through the trucks.  After researching, I found the engine is an Walthers GP9M.  I have tried to locate parts for it but no luck so far.  So, does anyone know where I can find the drive shafts?  Should I just get an universal set and try it?  Ideas?"

modeltrains,334gku,geeklantern,5,Sun Apr 19 13:22:28 2015 UTC,"DCC offers some nifty benefits--multi-locomotive operation, of course, but also constant bright headlights and car lighting, no-brainer reverse-loop operation, and more. It's not essential, however. There are still a lot of people running straight DC. Pretty much everything sold these days should be ""DCC Ready"" and will accept a drop-in decoder, but any good-running engine can be equipped. Whether you go DCC or not depends on how comfortable you are around electronics. It can be complicated, but there's all kinds of help out there."

modeltrains,334gku,Jeff_Faust,3,Sun Apr 19 19:20:09 2015 UTC,"Curve radius will be important. My Kato Broadway Limited runs fine on 13"" radius, but you'd be wise to lay down track temporarily and test with your equipment before you commit to a permanent plan.   Double track? Your call. One of the things I like about DCC is the ability to run more trains without more loops of track. We can set up a large T-Trak layout at a show and let several trains follow each other around on the same loop."

modeltrains,32xcry,GGL2015,3,Fri Apr 17 14:29:12 2015 UTC,"Well living in Europe you have the luxury of being close to all the German companies like Marklin, Fleischmann and Roco. Those are all solid choices.   Just know going in that if you go Marklin you'll pretty much be able to only buy Marklin going forward as all of their stuff is very proprietary and they use 3-rail AC instead of DC. Almost all other European brands use DC which are compatible with American brands as well."
modeltrains,32xcry,capngrandan,2,Fri Apr 17 16:14:52 2015 UTC,"In terms of compatibility with American, yes and no: Yes - electrically using DC power and safe, as in US 12V is top voltage, European trains can use up to 16V making them safe on American layouts. However European deep flanges won't go well over anything less than code 100 track. This is the reason for me that I switched to Proto87 (proto87.com) to operate both European and American trains with no trackwork conflict on same layout. If you are prototypical model railroader you may not find this necessary as I freelance combining American and European trains on one layout, but realistic wheels look nice too, however switches require narrower flangeways making track laying slightly a challenge. Here are some images:  HO on the left, P87 on the right: http://i155.photobucket.com/albums/s288/jasperofzeal/100_2245.jpg  P87 boxcar: http://www.proto87.com/media/ss_size1/boxmodp1.jpg  European trains with P87 wheels: http://www.eisenbahnstudio.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Tds928Enno5.jpg Notice barely-visible flanges.

Roco is probably the easiest to get and it's superb quality. I've heard gaugemaster from the UK is good quality, but haven't tried it.   NMJ had mostly norwegian stock/items, but incredible quality.   Woodland Scenics from the US is very available in Europe and I like to use that for scenery.

There was one shop where usually at least one employee would tail me around the store because he was convinced I was there to steal things (despite the fact I'm relatively well known in the modelling and railfanning community locally, and usually bought a few things on each visit).  There was one shop where if the owner didn't think you'd chosen the right brand of X/Y/Z or were doing something differently than him, he'd launch into a tirade about it being crap (despite the fact you were trying to buy it from his store).  There was another that had decent selection, but everything was in locked glass cases, and if you weren't one of the chosen regulars, nobody would pay attention to you and get things out of the cases for you to buy.  Forget it.  The frustration isn't worth it.  It's easier to hit up MB Klein, Walthers, or BLW and just order what I need.  Good price, excellent selection, no weird personalities to deal with, and whatever I wanted shows up in a few days.

modeltrains,32waaq,CHanyy,2,Fri Apr 17 06:15:12 2015 UTC,"Don't use a helix on a layout that small.  One thing people don't realize at first is just how much track they contain.  Using a 30"" radius, which would be quite small for an HO helix, each lap would contain ~15' of track.  At a climb of 4"" per lap you would have ~45' of track to gain one foot of elevation.  Your trains would spend more time navigating the helix than they would out of it.  I think you would find this to get boring fast.  I would recommend you consider a point-to-point style layout.  You can put staging yards at either end which are basically holding areas that you store trains.  The idea is that a train would leave one staging yard, navigate the layout and do some switching or travel right through, then park in the opposite switching yard.  You  could then bring a second train out and do the same thing again, either from the first staging yard or running in the opposite direction.  This has the added benefits of seeing a variety of equipment running and also appears more realistic as in real life you don't see the same train doing laps in front of you."

I sketched up a first impression of what I'd like here: http://imgur.com/a/HgPzS  Any ideas and changes you have to that? The green square would be some sort of lumber mill, and the turnout on the right loop would be if I eventually want to build a second layer under or over this one."
modeltrains,32waaq,Rico_Dredd,2,Fri Apr 17 15:41:43 2015 UTC,"I'd go point to point, and putt in an auto reversing circuit. Gives you more room for switching and industries at each end."
modeltrains,32waaq,garethashenden,1 point,Sat Apr 18 01:13:02 2015 UTC,Well I don't know. What scale are you working in and which country do you model? There's quite a difference between an HO American layout and a N British layout.
modeltrains,32waaq,quillsandsofas,2,Fri Apr 17 11:19:41 2015 UTC,"Totally forgot to mention that, it's HO and norwegian design"
modeltrains,32waaq,quillsandsofas,1 point,Fri Apr 17 12:39:10 2015 UTC,"So I'm assuming you're from Norway then. Well, quite frankly, I think you should take the advice from this thread with a grain of salt. Most people here are from America (I assume) and railroads in NA operate very differently from those here in Europe, as they have other restrictions, motivations and environments. This of course is also reflected in the track arrangement. Now perhaps you want to make american-style operations, or maybe you don't care about the prototype at all and just want to move some cars. Which of course is completely fine.  The best advice I can give you if you're going the prototypical way is to observe your local railway line or the specific scene/thing/route/station you want to model or to use as an inspiration for you model. How are the track arrangements? Why are they the way they are? What kinds of trains come through? What do they do there? How are the freight cars switched and spotted? What does the scenery look like? The buildings and structures? Once you have understood how these things work in real life it will be much easier to make a believable and well-working track plan.  ed: train->thread, whoops"
modeltrains,32waaq,Dascandy,1 point,Fri Apr 17 20:14:50 2015 UTC,"I am a train engineer in Norway, so the inspiration is already there.   I am not trying to model after something, but rather create a line where I can run my trains and model some scenery, but I've never created a model railway before and I've noticed that taking things from my 1:1 scale job onto a 1:87 scale surface doesn't quite work, so the help is more related to the practical solutions regarding model railway in itself."
modeltrains,32waaq,kellyzdude,1 point,Fri Apr 17 20:53:14 2015 UTC,"ah, interesting.  Well, the problem with model railroads not being able to represent their prototypes is as old as model railroading itself. The technique used is called scenery compression, where you try to capture the prototype's most significant track arrangements/structures/landscapes in a smaller space. Thus a 5-track yard becomes a 3-track yard, a bridge has only three spans rather than six, a siding can only hold two cars and not ten, and so on. That way you can archive a believable and usable layout that can still be identified as a certain locale/timespan/opertation."
modeltrains,32waaq,kellyzdude,1 point,Sat Apr 18 14:45:32 2015 UTC,If you go H0 scale or up you won't be able to fit in a loop on the left so you'll have to have some form of reversing somewhere. If you go N scale you can fit in quite an interesting layout - do you want heights / passovers / bridges too?
modeltrains,32waaq,kellyzdude,1 point,Fri Apr 17 12:02:14 2015 UTC,"Im not sure about heights, would you recommend building it up on foam or something?"
modeltrains,32waaq,kellyzdude,1 point,Fri Apr 17 12:40:54 2015 UTC,"Is this your first layout? I'd recommend against helices for the first round, or at least do some design and leave space to work on it later. Helixes need to be big and have a tendency to cause unexpected problems, and when they go wrong, they go expensively wrong.  So, simple requirements. The absolute minimum radius in HO is about 15"". The minimum radius for most equipment is 18"", and the minimum recommended radius is usually at least 22"". Most modular standards won't let you go below about 36"", but that's another discussion.  To get a loop, you're going to probably want either a 22"" outside and an 18"" inside, or a 24-25"" outside and 22"" inside. Assuming you go the first route you'll need about 46"" from the back to the front. From your image, you don't have close to that on either end, the far right might barely take an 18"" loop.  Now, if you went with 15"" radius, which noone will recommend, it might fit. But you'll be stuck with tiny locomotives and short rolling stock and probably still have problems.  You have a good space for some switching, and if you give up the idea of a continuous loop, you may just have a great layout opportunity. If you can get a 50"" square at each end, maybe the loop will become a reality again."
modeltrains,32waaq,kellyzdude,2,Fri Apr 17 13:57:22 2015 UTC,Quick sketch of a layout: http://imgur.com/a/HgPzS  Any tips/ideas?
modeltrains,32waaq,jagneta,1 point,Fri Apr 17 17:05:26 2015 UTC,"It's better than described initially, it sounds like you've developed your idea.  1) The radius on the curve at the far end will be a defining factor for what rolling stock you can run around it. Remember, smaller diesel units will run on 18"" radius, if you want larger diesels (think 6 axles) or steam, you'll need at least a 22"" radii.  2) You've added a reverse loop into the mix. There's been several posts recently, and they're not a huge problem but that add a small electrical complication that needs to be accounted for. If you're using DCC, you'll just need an auto reverser, most likely, possibly more than one if you have long passenger cars that are all lit. Your reverse loop is longer than I first thought, you should be fine with one.  3) Personally, I'd prefer some more opportunities for switching, but that's just me.  It looks like an awesome first layout, and I don't mean that as any form of put-down. It's a good there-and-back, it makes good use of the space, and has enough complex pieces to keep you busy building and playing operating."

modeltrains,32hxkj,1TONcherk,2,Tue Apr 14 11:45:18 2015 UTC,"Free-mo is a module standard for HO scale module building. (Free-moN is the N scale variant, and we see posts regularly from at least one of the guys over at Free-moNebraska).  Basically, the standard defines dimensions only for the endplate of the module, and some requirements for track passing through it (minimum radius of curves, minimum switch/turnout number, etc). Within that, you can do whatever you want. We have a couple of modules that are 2 feet long, and others that are 6-8 feet long, endplate to endplate.  If you're interested, look us up on Yahoo, we're always happy to have more members.

modeltrains,32ezlb,Snail_Lord,5,Mon Apr 13 06:34:03 2015 UTC,You can only turn your trains around once then after that you'd have to do it manually. How big is this layout?
modeltrains,32ezlb,Hidiousclaw,2,Mon Apr 13 06:45:10 2015 UTC,Can't you just back them through the reversing loop?
modeltrains,32ezlb,Staphylococcus0,5,Mon Apr 13 06:55:27 2015 UTC,"Sure, but you have to keep repeating that.  And with a station in the center, a train would pass it normally, and the second time it would pass it backwards.

modeltrains,32ezlb,PM_ME_YOUR_CHESTHAMS,1 point,Mon Apr 13 10:02:43 2015 UTC,Haha. Yeah I guess that would work.
modeltrains,32ezlb,Hidiousclaw,3,Mon Apr 13 13:57:30 2015 UTC,"As a first timer, I would not recommend that reversing loop in the middle.  I know everyone says an auto-reverser would solve all problems, but I think a first timer trying to get all the switches and wiring setup up for that will be very likely to give up and shove it all in a box.  Start small, see what you like and what you don't, get some experience, and then go all-out on your next one.  Also, as /u/Hidiousclaw said, this reversing loop is poorly designed anyway.  OP will get frustrated with only being able to reverse in one direction very quickly."
modeltrains,32ezlb,reddRad,2,Mon Apr 13 14:10:31 2015 UTC,"I can agree the wiring is a bit tricky. It is a bit easier if you're going to go with dcc. I've wired up a wye on my first layout, it takes a bit of time but is very worth the effort."
modeltrains,32ezlb,Hidiousclaw,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:22:05 2015 UTC,I beg to differ on the reverse-loop criticisms.
modeltrains,32ezlb,Jeff_Faust,3,Mon Apr 13 21:19:22 2015 UTC,"I don't believe that's ""beginner"" work. I agree that once it's set up, it's very easy to run, but that is very different from wiring it all up.  Heck, I have trouble just getting the feeder wires soldered to my N-scale track. I don't think OP, a beginner, would, or should, invest in a DCC system right away.  Keep in mind how simple the track plan is.  Does OP really need DCC to run multiple trains on that?"

modeltrains,32ezlb,Jeff_Faust,1 point,Tue Apr 14 10:14:12 2015 UTC,An oval has just as much expantion opertunity as anything else you could do with that amount of space. As long as expantion is kept in mind you can always add things later. But if you don't plan on expanding that reverse loop becomes cumbersum having to back through it all the time. I agree that a reverse loop will make a section of a layout more practical and more interesting in the long run. But for some one just trying to get into the hobby to run some trains wont want to do anything beyond the basics.

If you ever decide to expand and start running larger locomotives and rolling stock it will be a very frustrating section of the layout. Not to mention you will need to put in a auto-reverse to prevent your trains from shorting your line. If you would like to put in a station I would suggest just a passing siding of sorts. it will let additional trains pass while one stops at the station and won't give you as many problems in the long run."

modeltrains,32afm6,bach123479,2,Sun Apr 12 01:26:25 2015 UTC,"The Addison Railroad was a branch of the Rutland Railroad established in 1871. The branch crossed through Addison County and across Lake Champlain to New York. The section of track that it ran on was notorious for accidents including an engine rollover and an train that went through the bridge into Lake Champlain. Also included on the line is a covered bridge in Shoreham, VT which is still in place today, though the 19 miles of track and bridge have been removed.  This is an original uncirculated stock certificate from the creation of the company in 1871."

modeltrains,329r69,Gunner857,7,Sat Apr 11 21:39:38 2015 UTC,"You've got a great start, but there are some things I question about your design. In addition, only you know why you've laid track where they are in your drawing, thus my comments are simply based on how I am interpreting things. So please don't take my comments too critically.   Firstly, I have to agree with /u/ANGR1ST on the yard's entry. That's way too tight. I also agree with /u/PM_ME_YOUR_CHESTHAMS's comments about the functionality of the yard. Have you considered a double ended yard? If you've decided you're sticking with a single-ended yard, I would add provision for an arrival/departure track and a yard lead. Something like this is far more flexible than yours is at present.  I also think there's a bit of redundant trackage on the left side of your track plan. Perhaps you have some idea of what they're doing and why you've laid them as such, but from my point of view it's very redundant. I think they could be simplified down to two switches: one off the mainline and then a further one to differentiate between the passing loop to the top or the reverse loop back to the main.  Your move in the upper right is excellent, as it keeps your double-track mainline interesting. I would suggest refining it similar to this to simplify the trackwork, as well as eliminate s-curves which would wreck havoc on your rolling stock.  As a curiosity, what are you planning on running? Is there a specific prototype and era you are after? Things like that ultimately determine what sort of rolling stock you can run which in term governs what your minimum curve radius will be.  I hope this helps!"

The New York Society of Model Engineers in Carlstadt, NJ and the Olde Newburgh Model Railroad Club in Walden, NY are the two that immediately spring to mind. They both have HO-scale club layouts, with the NYSME also having a 2-rail O-scale club layout. The Newburgh club also has a traveling HO-scale modular layout.  I know there's a O-Scale trolley club out on Long Island. And there's also the Brooklyn N-Trak and the New Jersey N-Trak groups. However, I'm not certain if these groups have club layouts.  I believe there's another club up in Poughkeepsie, but I'm not terribly familiar with it. And if you don't mind a few hours traveling, there's also the RPI Model Railroad Club and the college up in Rensselaer, NY  As far as anything within the 5 Boroughs (withholding the N-Trak group), I'm not sure there are any, simply due to the price of real estate. I know it's something I've been looking out for over the past 4 years here. Perhaps another Redditor knows otherwise...  Hope this helps!"

There are a few commercially available, but I wasn't able to find a good comparison of what they include and how they work (one says it includes proximity sensors, another claims not to need them, stuff like that).   You could also get an arduino, a 12v power supply, a motor driver chip, and a couple proximity sensors and set the whole thing up yourself.  Once you get the arduino figured out, it would be pretty easy to have it run a trolley until it gets to one of the proximity sensors, then have it stop, reverse, and run to the other end."

I have mounted the truss bridge in the center and creating a girder section on both sides and under it. Basically it is one solid bridge and I think will look and work great. I decided that I will go ahead and detail it because I plan on using it on a permanent layout in the future. The only thing I haven't decided on is the color. Should I do it a gray color or black. I also plan on weathering it somewhat. Hopefully by the time the weekend is over, it is all done including whatever wiring I decide to do for the track.  And yes, that is a cat for size comparison.

It uses a standard G gauge transformer (The LGB 50081 is recommended, thankfully I had a spare one), and is not included with the set (as it was not at original time of sale).  Extra track is available from the same site (link provided below), priced at about $8.50 per segment (12 curves to a full circle), with price breaks as you buy more. Track/switches/etc usually pop up on eBay for a little less per segment, but the guy who runs the site (Doug Burwell) actually takes the time to do a major cleaning and detailing on every piece of track - absolutely worth it.

modeltrains,311hj7,CHanyy,5,Wed Apr 1 10:36:45 2015 UTC,"is it possible to buy an AC locomotive and operate it on a DCC layout in the same way, or is it something that has to be added/removed in order for it to function in the same way?   From what I understand of Märklin and their AC system, no.   Märklin operates on a stud-contact system, similar to 3 rail O-Gauge here in America. This means there's a metal skid underneath the chassis that picks up power from studs on the center of the track, and the 2 rails act as returns.   DC, and DCC use a 2-rail system, with 1 rail as a pickup, and the other as a return. The only difference is that DC is an analogue system and DCC is a digital system.  Märklin does manufacture their own brand of digital control, very similar to DCC. However, I'm not sure how compatible the two of them are, considering the major differences in electrical currents between the two systems.  If you had a DCC locomotive, you could take it to a DC layout and operate it with no problems other than loosing the ability to use all the DCC functions. Conversely, you could take a DC locomotive to a DCC layout and run it, even though that risks some damage.   However, because the way the electrical systems work and are set up, you wouldn't be able to take a DC locomotive to an AC layout or vice versa.  I hope this helps somewhat. As I am American, I'm not 100% versed with Märklin's system as it's not really used over here. If anyone knows better, feel free to correct me!"
modeltrains,311hj7,jagneta,4,Wed Apr 1 11:08:42 2015 UTC,Be careful with a DCC loco on a DC layout. That could fry certain decoders. But most modern ones should be fine; just read the manual.
modeltrains,311hj7,PastaPappa,2,Wed Apr 1 11:45:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you for some clarity!  Just to further clarify some of my confusion here, I am looking at a model train. On the description it says ""DC, delivered with 21 pin MTC for decoder"". Is this something related to DCC operation?  The website has AC, DC and DCC locomotives listed, but some DC listed locomotives and multiple carriages has the MTC pin thing listed, so I'm maybe thinking there's something I can add to make this run safely on a DCC layout?  You say that DC locomotives on DCC layout risks some damage, is this something related to this decoder pin thing?  The only reason I listed Märklin is because I have some Märklin locomotives I got as a gift when I graduated (I'm a locomotive engineer), I'm thinking of just using them as decoration and not operative if they aren't usable as you say.  Thank you again for the help!"
modeltrains,311hj7,PastaPappa,1 point,Wed Apr 1 12:42:05 2015 UTC,"The 21 pin for decoder means the locomotive is 'DCC Ready'. It is set up to run as DC, but you can buy a standard decoder that plugs in and voila, it's now a DCC engine."

modeltrains,30qwo2,fotbr,5,Mon Mar 30 03:47:33 2015 UTC,"The best answer I can give you is to look at 101 Track Plans for ideas.  While most of the layouts featured are based around HO scale, a 4' x 8' HO layout fits fairly comfortably in a 3' x 5' area in N scale, and with a few changes, can often be made to fit a 2' x 4' area.  In a small space, you have to be selective about what you put in.  It will likely mean tight turns, so running big steam locomotives and the larger diesels are probably out of the question.  Passenger cars and long freight cars are going to look funny on tight curves, and some may not run well at all.  Other ideas for you:   Mike's Small Trackplans Carendt.com micro & small layouts"
modeltrains,30qwo2,fotbr,1 point,Mon Mar 30 04:02:27 2015 UTC,"Also, a ""walk around"" layout is often not the best use of space; you may be better off with a ""shelf"" type layout.

Just because you don't have a loop doesn't mean your limited to ""holiday trolley-set"" back-and-forth operation.  A ""fiddle yard"" where you can (physically, with your hands) switch cars and locomotives on and off your layout to simulate new trains, and an industrial park with a few industries all needing cars dropped off or picked up can make for very satisfying operating."

modeltrains,30o1vl,Bounty1Berry,2,Sun Mar 29 05:49:07 2015 UTC,"Who are the locomotives named after?  It seems like naming engines is not a big thing in the US, compared with, say, the UK."
modeltrains,30o1vl,Bounty1Berry,1 point,Sun Mar 29 05:57:40 2015 UTC,"The engines are named after people who were important in the Vermont Rail System. Rosalie W Szuch, who 301 is named after was an owner of the Clarendon & Pittsford Railroad. Ironic because 306, the Clarendon & Pittsford engine is named after an owner of the Vermont Railway.  Green Mountain RS1 #405 is named F. Nelson Blount, who was the owner of Steamtown when it was based in Vermont.  Vermont Railway 311, which wears a special 50th anniversary paint is named after the wife of the current Vermont Railway owner.  The naming of engines is almost exclusive to shortlines in the US. And even then there are very, very few that actually name their engines. To be totally honest, I can't name another railroad in the US that does this. Just another thing that makes the Vermont Rail System unique. The VRS has named all but three of their engines."

modeltrains,30o0nr,jagneta,5,Sun Mar 29 03:18:23 2015 UTC,"So, I went to the train show in Edison, NJ today. It's usually a big show when it rolls around every few months, but today was about three times the size. Anyway, I digress...  I had plans to purchase some ""pre-owned"" rolling stock or some specialty tools. As I was walking up and down the isles, looking at what was for sale, this 0-8-0 in a box of mixed stuff off to the side caught my eye. $45 later, and she was mine. Quite a catch, even though I did not get the things I intended to get...  She's a HO scale USRA 0-8-0 switcher sold/manufactured by Walthers/Proto2000, and lettered for the New Haven as #3401 of the NH's Y-3 class. She is a DCC-ready (i.e DC/Analogue) model.  Naturally, for the price I paid for it, there's got to be something wrong with it, right? Well, the front pilot step on the engineer's-side is unfortunately missing and the front coupler needs replacing, as seen here in this photo. She's also seems to have a loose axle on the third driving wheel, and sort of ""pops"" up on a curve -- you wouldn't notice it unless you actively watched for it, and doesn't interfere with operations. The front headlight also needs a new bulb or new wire, but that's not a pressing priority.   Other than those minor issues, she's in very, very good condition. She runs very smoothly, and only needs a tiny bit of oil to get rid a small squeak in the gearing. And in time, DCC Sound-chipping and weathering.  I don't model the New Haven directly (I primarally model the Erie and the L&HRR), so she'll either find a home in the yard at Maybrook, NY (which is the current plan), or she'll end up being ""re-painted"" (i.e swapping out the body shells) into Erie paint.  Anyway, thought it would be good to share this with you guys. Anybody else catch some good bargains recently?"

However it didnt look as good as the fine turf on the other half.   I ended up pulling it up (very easy) and doing turf instead. Turf would not take you very long on a layout that size and would cost about the same. The amount of time you spend measuring and cutting it out is close to the time it take to sprinkle on and glue down the turf. I would recommend turf for the looks.  BUT the mat is a good option if you plan on pulling it up later. Does not look as ""real"" but its pretty close."

modeltrains,305fza,MasterNation,1 point,Wed Mar 25 06:28:54 2015 UTC,"Mallet locomotive:       The Mallet Locomotive is a type of articulated steam railway locomotive, invented by the Swiss engineer Anatole Mallet (1837 - 1919).  The essence of his idea combines articulation of the locomotive and compound steam use. The articulation was achieved by supporting the front of the locomotive on a bogie frame (called a Bissell truck); the compound steam system fed steam at boiler pressure to high pressure cylinders for the main driving wheels. As the steam was exhausted from those cylinders, it was passed into a low pressure receiver and was then sent to low pressure cylinders to power the driving wheels on the Bissell truck.

Other things like pre-mixed joint compound would probably be easier to work with and more forgiving, but PoP comes in a huge bag and it was really cheap!

Is that just high hopes or are these trains that sought after? When I started going through everything, I thought like $1000 for it all, but that's looking incredibly underpriced compared to other listings.

modeltrains,2zwwmm,windupmonkeys,3,Sun Mar 22 20:14:03 2015 UTC,Just use any standard electronic solder. There is nothing about soldering rail joiners that is significantly different than soldering 2 wires together or soldering wires to connectors.  Do Not use acid core plumbing solder.

modeltrains,2zwwmm,Jeff_Faust,1 point,Mon Mar 23 21:37:41 2015 UTC,"I was going to try soldering the tracks together because the locomotives slow down as they get farther away from the feeder. Cleaning them and the track has not helped so I thought maybe I'd be able to solder them together for better continuity.   Based on your advice, I'll first give adding more feeders a try, rather than solder the joints."
modeltrains,2zwwmm,Quasi_Evil,1 point,Tue Mar 24 02:01:07 2015 UTC,"Soldering the joints might help, but as others have said, it completely defeats the point of Unitrack.  I'm betting it's just raw rail resistance getting you.  Throw a few more sets of feeders on and some decent wire back to the power source and I'll bet the problems go away.  That said, my preference in rail joint soldering is good ol' 63/37 tin-lead solder, rosin core, 0.032"" diameter.  I'll then usually put on a little Superior Flux No. 30 to make the joint flux up better than it would with just the rosin.  Has worked well for me for fifteen years now."
modeltrains,2zv13d,Gunner857,7,Sun Mar 22 01:09:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, don't do that. And I mean it in the nicest possible way, too.  First off, what size room do you have to work with. Can you use the walls? What scale are you modeling in?  Off of the top of my head, you're not going to be able to reach the middle or back if the layout is against the wall. Your sidings are too short, and there isn't a way for a train to reverse in both directions without going through the loop backwards.  Feel free to ask any specific questions, and ill do my best to.

I recommend keeping 22"" curves if you want to run passenger trains, but if not, you can compact it even more by using 20"" on the outside and 18"" on the inside.  It's not perfect, but it's a good start. Look at /u/fotbr 's response for some specifics of what you should have in a good layout."

modeltrains,2zv13d,fotbr,1 point,Sun Mar 22 21:24:06 2015 UTC,"I used the baseboard (the blue) as the room dimensions. I would make the benchwork pretty much hug the track, so you basically would have a shelf layout with loops at each end."
modeltrains,2zv13d,_ps,3,Sun Mar 22 22:29:17 2015 UTC,"I think you've got some good ideas, but as you probably note, it needs some improvement.  I'd suggest figuring out what your interest and goals are, and what your railroad's purpose is.    First, what are your goals?  Are you looking for something where you can just watch trains run?  A layout focused on switching/shunting?  What type, and how much, modeling & scenery do you want to do -- do you prefer more natural settings or a concrete jungle?  Second, what time/era are you wanting to play with?  Early steam, with shorter engines and shorter cars lets you use tighter curves.  Late steam, with some of the monster engines (Challengers & Big Boys, for example) are going to require larger curves just to get them to run reliably.    Third, are you wanting to model passenger service, or freight?  If passenger, where are the people coming from/going to? If freight, what kind?  General freight, or something more specialized: a mine of some sort, lumber mill, gain elevator, etc.  Let those industries drive your overall design, since they'll all have their own requirements.  For practical considerations, even if not driven by realistic operation, having a loop to have a train run continuously is often a good feature.  Having a turnaround loop is often a good feature.  Having a ""fiddle yard""1 is nearly always a good idea.  You've got decent starts at all of these.  1 An area with enough room for ""the hands of god"" to swap cars & engines on and off your layout."

Then I take a semi stiff paintbrush and gently push the decal from the paper onto the target location. The excess water lets the decal sort of float there without sticking. Then I use the brush to make sure the decal is in the exact spot I want it while drawing the water away little by little with a piece of paper towel. If the water is almost gone and it's not in the right spot, I'll add a little more water with the brush. This technique works well for me."

TS14 has TOFC, but its the same trailer model on every car. And I have no experience building scenarios in it so usually when I run in quick drive theres no traffic and green signals all the way. If there was a game that combined the cab simulation of TS14, and the different options and variety for consists like Trainz, I would open my wallet INSTANTLY.  I mean yes TS14 does have its Cajon Pass route which is almost like the Tehachapi route, but it doesnt have the loop. Also, havent seen a lot of ATSF for TS14. Again. Huge deal breaker.

modeltrains,2zjc3n,MichaelArnold,1 point,Thu Mar 19 05:22:20 2015 UTC,Intermountain detail quality is superb. Their newest can forwards are what you want to look for as their older runs had some problems with the motors and not being able to pull much. Regardless Intermountain and BLI have great detail quality and are both great runners. BLI brass hybrids will be nicer if available but expect to pay more.

I remember when the N and Z Walthers books were merely magazine thick. Today, they are almost the same size as the HO book. You can do more with less space.

Theres no doubt an abundance of US modellers on this page. I know there are a few, but less, Canadian modellers like myself. And one problem us Hosers are having right now is with ordering and purchasing from the US. Customs is having a blast raking us across the coals which has caused the creation of a few Canada buy and sell groups online.   As well its great to see modellers from across the pond come in here. But a gift exchange might get complex and messy if your match is half way around the world. Not to mention the difference between OO and HO being one such tiny hurdle.   Im sure this was a preliminary thought. But since no one has said anything so far, it should probably be noted. And since we are a niche subreddit, the turnout might not be as large as some other swaps."

modeltrains,2zb76d,scoobyduped,5,Tue Mar 17 04:12:35 2015 UTC,"I think you've always been a bit too ambitious for a 4'x8' setup.  This is definitely a step in the wrong direction compared to your last couple iterations.  A couple of the sidings that are barely long enough for one car are back, and there's just generally too much track in not enough space.    If I were you I'd think about moving away from the basic layout table.  Try putting together an around the walls design, something that could take the main scenes you want to have and spread them out a little."
modeltrains,2zb76d,ZebracakeDietPlan,2,Tue Mar 17 04:38:59 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I don't know your space constraints for a layout but 4x8s are an unrealistic space eating way to watch a train go around in just about the smallest circle possible.  If you can, like the above poster suggested, look into a more linear shelf like around the walls idea.   I had a 4x8 once when I was younger and looking back on it I'd say it hindered my enjoyment of the hobby more than it helped. Glad its gone."
modeltrains,2zb76d,dwwojcik,1 point,Tue Mar 17 05:01:50 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately 4x8 is my absolute max and even that was really pushing it. I rent, so can't have anything attached to the walls. My space is one half of the double garage. So it has to be free standing, and be able to have people get around/past it. It also needs to be able to be put away to get the second car in in the case of a severe storm or something (no idea how that will work, lol). So I really just need to make the most of what I've got to work with."
modeltrains,2zb76d,greenwizard88,2,Tue Mar 17 06:06:44 2015 UTC,"A linear shelf doesn't necessarily have to be attached to the walls, you could just have a row of long narrow tables against the wall.  It would probably be easier to move if you get a new place, and depending on the size of the garage and the car you might even be able to park inside without moving the layout."

The locomotives needed the same thing done for their wheels as well.   All of this took hours of work for a little less than what you have. However, after it was all said and done it ran better than I ever remembered it had"
modeltrains,2zaozc,kellyzdude,1 point,Tue Mar 17 13:10:23 2015 UTC,"Doesn't need to be flex, replacing with Nickel Silver snap-track is good.  Most older track I've seen is brass, which oxidizes and holds dirt much better (worse) than the more recent nickel silver track.

I did this engine for a friend in the KC metro who models the PGR Airlake Park and surrounding area (see a Jim Hediger article in MR from a few years ago).  I've also done a couple of the 'lightning bolt' scheme PGR SW1500s and the SD38-2 for him.  They are fun to do because, that we are aware of, nobody has done a commercial release of PGR engines and I find their paint schemes unique, and respectful of the predecessor road (MN&S).  I model Burlington Northern in about 1991.  A sizable portion of my locomotive fleet is custom detailed and/or painted to meet the needs of that era.

You'd need something like, either a muscle wire servo (but which would probably be too fast to look good), a microservo that you'd use in RC planes (you'd have problems finding a way to drive that from a model train perspective), solenoids (inefficient, power hungry, and have a snapping motion, or some kind of pushrod with an actuator (actuator would have to be in the shell).   So an off the shelf solution? No.   The rest of the responses seem to be about whether catenary exists.

There didn't seem to be very much resistance. the engine rolled smoothly without noise, with the trucks and gears on with the missing worm gear separating the trucks from the engine.  I then popped the drive shafts with the worm gear off at the flywheel so I could run the engine without the shafts flopping around. I could put resistance on the flywheels just about to stall without getting any noise.  While the engine is all apart I'm going to wash all the gears and the trucks in rubbing alcohol in the morning to clean the off, re lube the gears and motor following the guide in the locos manual.

Unfortunately, there's a lot of customization between manufacturers on how they cram stuff into their shell.. so something that fits a Kato shell probably won't fit an Atlas shell without some trimming and grinding.  Finally, detail has really improved over the years, so those old shells wont looks so great next to newer ones.  It might be better just to find a new model in the same road name.  One thing you might do is make your engines free-rolling and just use them in a consist with a modern engine that runs better."

Most of my stuff is either Varney, Athearn, ROCO, or Mantua. With a little dedication, you can make a quality layout with you're current stock.   Once I find a place to  call my own, i'll set up a DC/ DCC system, but for now I just can't justify spending the time/money/space to set up a DCC blocked layout just to have to destroy it again when I move.   It is, however, up to you. If you're dead set on changing to DCC, I would buy a DCC starter kit (Bachmann is cheapest, but you get what you pay for) and go from that. You can slowly build up your pre-installed stock, while occasionally self-installing a decoder or two into your old stuff for memory's sake."

When you do get to the point of going DCC, converting track wiring over to DCC isn't a horrendous task if you keep the wiring accessible, and you can build up (both purchases and conversions) a DCC fleet over time instead of needing to spend a bunch right away."
modeltrains,2yw9gr,dakotabranch,1 point,Fri Mar 13 14:06:04 2015 UTC,"I agree with this.  If you like your old engines, then I'd definitely keep them.  Get them running well on DC and then convert one by one.  Even a basic hardwired DCC install in a BB engine is pretty straightforward.    The thing that hasn't been mentioned here is adding some prototype specific detail parts.  Sunshades, cab roof details, snowplows, MU hoses and cut levers are easy to add, cost little and lend a ton of credibility to your model without breaking the bank.

modeltrains,2yw9gr,kellyzdude,1 point,Fri Mar 13 18:56:51 2015 UTC,"Depends on what is actually happening.  Each engine needs to run well on its own before you attempt consisting (even on DC) or putting DCC into them.  Do you have corrosion issues or do the gears simply need a drop of lube?  I don't know that there's a lot you can do for engines from different manufacturers, other than put DCC into them and speed match them via programming.  For example, the old Proto SD60 and SD60M.  They were geared such that their scale top speed was something like 50 or 60MPH, which makes them slower than about everything else out there.  Without adding DCC, and doing the speed matching thing, there's not much that can be done to slow other engines down to run well with them.  You are going to want to look over your roster and figure out what is appropriate to run together, what is worth spending time on and which units need to be replaced or substituted for."

If dad ever gets around to retiring, they're planning on a basement railroad to keep them busy - dad likes the realistic operations side of things, mom likes miniature things, so they think it'll be a good hobby.  It probably will, assuming of course that they don't kill each other over it.  Next up, I've got a half dozen locos and their corresponding DCC boards that need swapping in; that's a pretty easy evening's worth of work.  After that, I've got 4 older non-dcc-ready locos that need their old rapido-style couplers swapped out, and a close look to see if converting them is worth the trouble.  Along with general ""working on the layout"" tasks those will probably keep me busy until the middle of next month."
modeltrains,2yqucg,fotbr,1 point,Thu Mar 12 01:41:05 2015 UTC,"Awesome, at first I mis-read that you were scratchbuilding a model of your grandparents house for your grandparents -- I was intrigued by the idea of the recursive model, then realized I was wrong.  Unfortunately, with exception to my most recent acquisitions, all of my locos were built well before DCC was thought of, or at least created. Mostly Athearn Blue Boxes which are easy enough, but a couple of Bachmann Spectrums which are essentially N-scale locos, in HO size -- split frame that's 3/4 of the height of the body leaving little space for a decoder and no space for error when insulating the motor away from the trucks, or the decoder board from the frame..."
modeltrains,2yqucg,fotbr,2,Thu Mar 12 02:42:01 2015 UTC,"I would have figured that in HO scale they would have come up with a better chassis design than the split frame thing.    I'm a N-scale guy with a few relatively ancient locos as well (if the rapido-coupler bit didn't give it away) and I'm scared of breaking some of the bits I've got just by looking at them.    I've seen youtube videos of some amazing conversion work done with N-scale split frame models and (very) careful application of a dremel to make room where none existed before -- perhaps something similar might work for you as well.  Other than that, as I'm sure you know, kapton tape is your friend.  Good luck!"

It was incorporated in Virginia on February 26, 1973, and it acquired the C&O (which controlled the other companies) on June 15. On November 1, 1980, Chessie System merged with Seaboard Coast Line Industries to form CSX Corporation. However, the Chessie image continued to be applied to new and re-painted equipment until mid-1986, when CSX introduced its own paint scheme. The B&O and C&O were not legally merged out of existence until 1987, when the company's official successor, CSX Transportation was founded."

modeltrains,2ykli3,Shdwdrgn,1 point,Tue Mar 10 20:05:49 2015 UTC,"There was a posting here just recently (maybe 2-3 weeks ago?).  I've also been watching for more information in this thread, an open-source solution would be great.  [EDIT] Here's a link to the original reddit article I was hinking of (he actually is doing wifi).  There's also this thread which is unfortunately lacking any follow-up info.  Hopefully the author responds to my request for a link.  WIFI would be good if you have a really large setup, but folks are reporting good connections with BT at 30-40 feet, so if you had the transmitter in the center of your layout most people would have no trouble.  Really though, the only difference between BT and WIFI would be the radio, the rest of the hardware and software would be the nearly same.  There are a lot of cheap BT devices on ebay that plug directly into a serial port (or for example, onto the I/O pins of a raspberry pi or arduino/teensy board).  You can also get similar sensor boards that plug into the I/O ports and pick up RFID tags.  Ideally I would like to tag all of my cars and run the locos from BT, all under computer control.  The software could be pretty simple, written in multiple blocks.  Have one block that defines basic rules, like only one train allowed in a track section at once, another block that identifies individual trains as sensors pass over each detector, and yet another block that defines various schedules where a train moves from point A to point B or drops off/picks up cars from the spurs.  Once you start putting everything together, it becomes this complex orchestra of movement around the track."

modeltrains,2ykli3,fotbr,1 point,Wed Mar 11 02:12:38 2015 UTC,"That was great, thanks for the link!  My idea shouldn't be complicated, just robust.  It's more a mater of adding different layers to a system that interact with each other.  For example, you have the bottom layer which detects if the section the train is trying to enter is already occupied, and if so, that train gets stopped.  Then you have a higher layer where you might be sending manual signals to control a loco, however if you try to enter an occupied block, the lower layer has priority to try and stop trains from colliding."
modeltrains,2ykli3,Shdwdrgn,1 point,Wed Mar 11 04:52:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah after reading your previous comment again I think you're right. Basing it off Heirarchical (totally made a new word, waiting for Honorary PHD in English from Oxford) rules would be the easiest way, but it would take time to construct the code. That said once you have it up and running it really would be a beautifully ""complex orchestra of movement around the track.""  I just realized halfway through this comment that this already exists in games like Railroad Tycoon II. You set the trains destination, way points and priority and you're good to go.   My mind is now racing. Given my limited space, this could make switching layouts much more entertaining and the block idea would compliment a modular design.  I owe you a cookie Sir/Ma'am for the inspiration"

Keeping the programming as simple as possible seems to be the only way to avoid catastrophe, but the aspect I'm trying to figure out now is making sure I can track both the front and the rear of each train.  I'm thinking maybe something as simple as an IR light detector at the intersection of each block, but that's one of those things I need to work out once I get some track laid."

modeltrains,2ykli3,Jeff_Faust,2,Wed Mar 11 20:00:55 2015 UTC,"Warning, a lot of words are below.... :)  Probably the cheapest way (and in my opinion the best way I have found) to accomplish this, assuming you have a PC that you can use to control the layout and that is not an associated cost, is to use a Sprog 3 DCC Command Station along with JMRI software.  The Sprog 3 is a USB controlled DCC system, which connects to any computer that can run Java (so windows, MAC, Linux...)  and costs about $100.   It will support 2.5A of current plus you can add $60 boosters to it as required.  I can not say enough good things about this little controller.   All associated software is free, and is HIGHLY functional.    You could also of course go with some of the commercially available DCC units that support a computer connection, at a much higher cost, and maybe still use JMRI.   I started converting to DCC in about 2010.  I've used other commercial systems so I am speaking from experience when I say that the Sprog is just as capable, and in many cases, more capable, than other DCC systems costing hundreds of dollars more.   In my setup, I have a 10 year old Windows XP machine with an ancient Pentium-D processor that I have dedicated to the layout.  It is mounted to the under side of the bench, which in my case is a 36""x80"" N scale layout.  The PC automatically boots and logs into windows, then starts up the required JMRI apps (decoderpro, withrottle, web server, etc) in 80 to 90 seconds (yes I timed it).  There is no monitor or keyboard attached, I push the front power button to power on the machine, and the PC plays a diesel horn using a JMRI script when the software is up and ready to run.   To shut down, I just press the front power button again.  I of course can hook up the monitor and keyboard if need be, but as long as windows boots OK I can just RDP or VNC in from a laptop.     Words can not express how absolutely phenomenal it is to sit a loco on the track, have JMRI / Decoderpro completely read and save all CV's to a customized roster table, and then to be able to use a graphical interface to change anything the decoder supports.  Take a speed table for example.  Instead of calculating a speed slope then sending over 28 separate DCC commands with a clunky hand controller, I use the JMRI Programmer app to set the speed table start and end points and it will automatically calculate whatever curve you desire, and with a single mouse click it will send all 28 of these values to the decoder literally in a few seconds.    Edit - almost forgot this - Once you have JMRI running, you can start an application called WiThrottle.   This will broadcast, over your wifi, and you can connect to it from any Android or Apple device, to then use that device and a throttle / programmer / web interface to the system / etc.   Android uses a program called Engine Driver (free) and Apple uses WiThrottle (Free version and more functional paid version).   the Sprog is also quite resilient to idiot users.   For example, say someone decided to clean up some wiring and move the unit to a more permanent location, but found after hooking everything up it would not work.   Say also that same person after about 20 minutes of reboots, power cycles, etc, finally found that they had accidentally hooked up the 14V input wires to the Srog track terminals, and the track wires to the Sprog power terminals.  The unit still powered up this entire time, although it obviously could not communicate with the layout, and once the mistake was found and wires properly hooked up it still worked fine and seems no worse for the wear.....  not going to mention any names.....  :)  I feel like I also need to say that I have no relationship with Sprog.  I just really think it's one of the best, most cost effective, solutions for DCC control.    Hope this helps.   Google ""Sprog 3"" and ""JMRI"" for more info and feel free to ask any questions you come up with."

The Christmas buys were almost entirely ready-to-run sets and the Thomas wooden stuff.  Also their scale stuff has gotten ridiculously expensive lately.

Their Legacy Big Boy costs 60% more than the MTH one does ($1599 vs $2699), and the scale modern diesels (SD-70ACE / C44-9 / ES44 / etc) are sitting at about $530 +/- from Lionel, and are about $100 cheaper from MTH.

modeltrains,2yf3rz,PlappyODaniels,2,Mon Mar 9 19:16:42 2015 UTC,"The rock work is all done with Geodesic Foam and Casting Satin from Bragdon Enterprises.  We also used several of his latex rock molds (which are far and away the best I've ever seen).  It's a bit expensive if you have to cover a huge area like we are, but if you're doing a simpler layout like a lot of the 4x8 or 8x10's that get posted on here, then the starter kits he's got available for $50-150 will probably take care of just about everything you need (though the molds do need to be bought separately I think).  I cannot recommend his product highly enough.  We're using the foam to do the scenery shell because it allows us to cover a huge area quickly and it's way lighter than plaster cloth or hydrocal, but you don't necessarily need to use it.  It's a two-part resin that reacts similar to how spray foam or liquid plummer type stuff works, but it dries totally rigid.  It gets layered over two sheets of regular door screen, and is then glued / stapled to the benchwork to form the shell.  The rocks are a little more involved, but fairly easy still.  The casting satin is also a two-part mixture, but more like a polyurethane than anything else - it gets poured into the molds, and then backed with a little bit of the foam to provide strength.  It's pliable for about 30 minutes before it hardens, so it can be molded to just about any shape.  The killer thing with the rocks is they're super easy to blend together because of how jagged and erratic the edges are.  Gaps get filled in with a paint-ready caulk, after which you can't tell it's put together piecemeal (the section in the pics above is probably about 25 different castings all stuck together in some way or another).  Once it's in place, it gets primed with white tempra paint, then the cracks are detailed using a thin dusting of black powdered tempra that gets sprayed with water to get it to stick.  Once that's dry, then it basically gets water-color painted with a very light wash of acrylic paint to taste.  All the talus and boulders are just pea gravel from Home Depot, and the ground cover is various colors of fine and medium-fine crushed foam from Woodland Scenics."

I've got that the F7 version of that set, but the cars are the same, in N scale, and the angles are much more like what you see between the GP40 and car #1.  The car overhang looks about right.

modeltrains,2yg38u,reddRad,1 point,Mon Mar 9 18:09:54 2015 UTC,"I've had no problems with the cars on the supplied track, which is a pretty tight radius."
modeltrains,2yg38u,dorpal_the_great,1 point,Mon Mar 9 20:10:03 2015 UTC,So what is the difference between code 55 and 80? As best as I can tell the only difference is the color of the ties.
modeltrains,2yg38u,reddRad,2,Mon Mar 9 19:49:53 2015 UTC,"The main difference is the size.  Code 80 is 0.080"" high, while code 55 is 0.055"" tall, and much more realistic.  N-scale is 1:160, so 0.080 is the equivalent of 12.80"" in real life.  I doubt there has ever been rails that were over a foot tall.  One problem with the rail height is that a lot of old engines/cars have wheels with very large flanges (pizza cutters) that worked fine with code 80, but will bump over the ties on the smaller code 55.  I have some Roco European cars that do that.  Modern rolling stock should have wheels with smaller flanges that work fine on both.  Code 80 has been around forever, so there are probably more availability of switches/crossings/bridges/etc.  Code 55 is newer, and manufacturing has gotten much better over the years, so it looks a lot better.  Code 80 really can't be improved, because it has to match all the old track out there.  If you're just starting out, most people recommend code 55, because it looks so much better.  Incidentally, HO scale has a similar decision to make, between code 100 and code 83."
modeltrains,2yg38u,dorpal_the_great,1 point,Mon Mar 9 20:06:52 2015 UTC,"That's really interesting, did they change anything else between 55 and 80 besides rail height? Also since there is physically less metal in code 55 is it cheaper? Or is code 80 still cheaper just because it is so much more common?"
modeltrains,2yg38u,reddRad,2,Mon Mar 9 20:38:59 2015 UTC,"Well what changed is the ""looks better"" part.  The ties are brown, instead of black.  They're smaller and closer together.  The spikes are also much smaller.  Everything looks more realistic.  And no, despite there being less metal, the track is ""better"" so they charge more."
modeltrains,2yg38u,dorpal_the_great,1 point,Mon Mar 9 20:47:42 2015 UTC,"So here are a couple I've been thinking of. The first one was using Bachmann EZ track and the second is with Atlas code 80. Believe it or not both end up being the same price. But these are 3x6 instead of 2x6. I found that with the 2x6 there wasn't a lot of room for ""operations"" or even a doubled up loop in the middle for additional track mileage to have less empty space. I also think that the tightest code 80 radius might be like 10 inch radius but I'm not sure if that is at inner rail or outer rail. I am doubtful that you will be able to get a wide enough radius in 24 inches for long axle cars. But most of my experience in the matter comes from HO work when I was younger, it could be different in N."

modeltrains,2yg38u,c25375,1 point,Sat Mar 14 13:10:35 2015 UTC,"I would avoid that set to start out with.  The cars it has are longer which will cause issues on the sharp curves.

modeltrains,2y9zrm,NotAnotherKerman,3,Sat Mar 7 21:38:18 2015 UTC,"A DPDT, and a pair of insulated rail joiners.  Digitrax references it in their knowledgebase: http://www.digitrax.com/tsd/KB71/dpdt-double-pole-double-throw-electrical-switch/  See the image at the very bottom, use the insulated rail joiners on each rail entering the siding so that it is properly isolated from the rest of the layout. Wiring the siding to the switch, with one half fed to the RAIL A/B and the other half fed to the PROG A/B. Flip the switch to RAIL A/B, run the loco in under its own power, then flip the switch to PROG A/B to program. This has the added benefit that you can switch back to RAIL to test your changes, and back to PROG to fix any errors without having to lift the loco off the track or mess with re-railing.  Just be careful that the locomotive isn't bridging the gap between the programming area and the rest of the layout when you issue programming commands. If you're not confident you or your guests can do this, perhaps an extra section of track in between the programming section that can be turned off while programming, for safety.  That said, the loco-jumps-forward-when-programming -- I've never seen this. Is it unique to the DCS200, or your specific decoders? I've definitely not yet observed it with TCS or Digitrax decoders.."

Regarding the loco-jumps-fordward, it's strange but I thought it was a normal thing as I have several locos from different brands (couple of kato, walthers, micro-trains and atlas converted with digitrax decoder, a BLI that came with DCC and sound and an Athearn Big Boy).  /u/musson also mentioned his locos do not move on his programming track but I've found this on the DCC Wiki:   Decoder Acknowledgement  There is an acknowledgement (ACK) mechanism specified. This allows the decoder to act on instructions regardless of the ability of the programmer to detect the ACK signal.  There are two mechanisms defined:   BASIC ADVANCED   BASIC  This is defined by the decoder providing an increased load on the programming track, of at least 60mA for 6mS. One method is to apply power to the motor, or a similar load connected to the decoder.  Many decoders apply a short burst of power to the motor, causing the locomotive to lurch forward.  ADVANCED  Covered by NMRA Standards S-9.3.1 and 9.3.2  http://www.dccwiki.com/Decoder_Programming"

I find once I program the loco I don't need to do it again.  If I get a new loco I just hook up the programming track and lay it down on my layout, do the programming and then put it away. My locos never move on the programming track at all.  N scale Unitrack and mostly Kato locos (1 Atlas)."
modeltrains,2y9zrm,Hidiousclaw,1 point,Sat Mar 7 22:36:03 2015 UTC,Thanks! That is true but I like to mess with the speed tables of my locos.   My locos do move in the programming track. I read somewhere that a decoder must acknowledge a programming command by increasing the amp load for several miliseconds. The load increase is achieved by turning the motor a bit. That's why my locos jump fordward.   I'm an N scaler too!  Edit: here's where I read that part http://www.dccwiki.com/Decoder_Programming
modeltrains,2y9zrm,time-lord,2,Sun Mar 8 02:00:56 2015 UTC,You would have to push it unless you add a switch.

This way you can drive it on them switch to the programing track. Hopefully my train lingo is sufficient. Haha.

modeltrains,2xp6tn,ndepirro,9,Mon Mar 2 19:26:59 2015 UTC,"Well, ignoring the DCC installation because on this model it is quite easy, I can outline a few steps for weathering. I'll use some train terms here, so if you don't know what they are, you may have to look them up. Nothing fancy, but it helps to know the names of the components. I did this one more than a year ago, so I don't recall exactly what I did, but I follow a general plan each time. Very few details were added to this loco. Detail Associates lift rings were added, for sure. Basically, looking at a photo of the prototype unit, I add cables or different radio antennae, or whatever.  Looking at a photograph of the actual locomotive is best, but you can wing it as well. Is your locomotive rusted out with well-established rust? Was it recently bashed and showing new rust? This Amtrak unit didn't have much rust, so I didn't add much except on the plow. This kind of has to be decided before starting. The most important thing is to think about how dirt, rust, and damage might occur on the real thing. I feel like sometimes modelers follow a routine that fails them because it's just a dumb routine that doesn't use any imagination.  For weathering, there might be some cleaning to do to remove any fingerprints. I try to always wear rubber gloves when painting, but during assembly, I don't so those fingerprints have to be wiped off with some alcohol on Q-tips. It's not a big deal, but some cleaning is usually needed. I weather the first steps with the shell off the chassis. I may or may not mask the windows with a liquid mask. I have also cut small masking tape pieces to mask the windows in the pattern of the wiper blade path. That way airbrushed dust will be on the windows but not where the blades would travel.  Next, with very thin black paint (water based in this case) sometimes even with alcohol mixed in to further thin it and lower the surface tension, all vents, grills, and seams are given a darkening wash using a very small brush. This step alone makes the whole shell look less like plastic. You have to know what the different parts of a locomotive actually do to get it right, but some grills are filter screens, and some are more like vents or mesh. No matter what, black will make them seem like they have some depth.  Then, I might use a very thin wash of black chalk in alcohol and water, or a AIM solution like Quick Age, to further that darkening of the cracks. Basically, the entire shell gets a wash to darken anything where dirt might collect or just to bring out the details. This step can be repeated.  At this stage, if I wanted to really rust-out a roof, I would apply AIM rust solutions, and/or rust-colored chalks mixed with flat (clear) finish thinned with water and alcohol. Sometimes acetone can be mixed in to create reticulation of the chalks in the solution so that when they dry, it has a natural appearance that you can't get with a brush. I use this to excess with very rusty locos. At this point I might also begin to streak thin black paint down from the roof onto the sides of the cowl. This would be to simulate rust or stains that wash down with rain. Basically, always keep thinking about what the cause of the marks would be in real life. (I will share an SD60 that I am working on that is heavily streaked, once I finish it.) Any open rust also would streak down. I won't get into rust or damaged paint here because this unit doesn't have any.  Next, I might start messing with some soot-black chalks with nice soft brush. I use a round pointed brush with about 1/4"" diameter. It's good to know where soot collects in real life. An intake vent doesn't have soot but might still have some dark dust around it, but not as much as an exhaust. There might be cause for using a smaller brush, but not usually. Black chalk can also help to simulate black stains on the walkways caused by diesel oil or whatever else. You can also just ""spill"" some thin black paint to get a nice effect. Gloss black might suggest a fresh spill. This F40PH doesn't really have much walkway area, but it's still something to think about.  The chassis and trucks might need some paint details like some red on the fuel filler caps and things like that. Once that is completed, I might attack with some earth-toned chalks first and really brush it into every detail. I always paint the faces of the wheels with a brown paint, usually Floquil (solvent based) Freight Car Brown. If I take the trucks apart, I will airbrush it, but if the trucks seem fragile or if there are too many details that would be damaged, I will just brush the paint onto the wheels and rotate them to get 100% coverage. I might use some solutions or washes on the chassis too, but you want to try to avoid getting the electrical contacts at the wheels too dirty. I will usually follow up with some dark rust chalk. I will be making applications of rust solutions to the pilots and plow at this stage. A wet Q-tip is always around to keep things under control and to keep the rust off the MU hoses.  Next, I will generally start airbrushing the reassembled loco. I use a variety of mixed up paints to simulate the road grime that kicks up onto the entire bottom half of any operating loco. Trains really throw dirt around, so your regional dirt color might be ""important"" to know. The grime is brake dust, oil, grease, sand, who knows what else. If an loco is running behind another, for example, two streaks will form where grime was spit up from the wheels of the first. This same marking is found on rolling stock. When in a turn, the wheels of the locomotive will kick this grime up onto the sides of the cowl, so I usually airbrush the areas where this rooster-tail of grime would land. It is mostly a very dark brown. I alternate between a few different browns until it looks right. You might want to do that obligatory diesel fuel spill under the fuel filler with some thin gloss black. A spill tapers off as it pours down the side of the fuel tank. I usually wipe some of the gloss black off the tank to get it right. Like much of this, it's good brushwork that makes it look correct. This ""fuel spill"" is one of those things that people always seem to do on each and every model, so I kind of hate it. When done correctly, it looks good, though. Also, at this point I have probably wiped the headlights and ditch lights clean a few times. Couplers would probably have a lighter or more orange fresh rust color, again, achieved with chalks.  On the Amtrak pictured here, I worked some black chalk onto the model and then rubbed it away using only vertical movements, but leaving it behind in any area where dirt might collect. Amtrak stuff is hard to work with sometimes; it has a metallic finish because of the paint Amtrak uses called Platinum Mist. Amtrak models can look bad really fast if you mess it up. Some lighter buff chalks were applied to the chassis and trucks to bring out the detail, but still keeping in mind that a train moving forward would have dirt hitting the forward-facing surfaces, so that's where I applied the last layer of dust. I don't just do it to ""bring out the detail"" with no other consideration. I cleaned some of the handrails and other areas where the crew handles an engine. Some additional black was probably sprayed on the roof where soot would be, and then some further black chalk. If the dirt on the lower part of the loco looks too even, maybe applying some black chalk in some places might help. The entire model is then sprayed with a thinned flat finish to lock it all down and also get rid of any remaining gloss. That's not always what you want, but on this one, the entire shell was made pretty flat.  Once finished, you must take care when handling the model. I usually use a little cloth to pick them up so the oil from my fingers doesn't destroy all my work."

""Then, I might use a very thin wash of black chalk in alcohol and water, or a AIM solution like Quick Age, to further that darkening of the cracks.

modeltrains,2xpxz7,Bladdars,2,Mon Mar 2 22:42:58 2015 UTC,"I go by the size of the layout, that usually determines what looks good. I usually run 20 to 30 with one loco at our local club and I believe it's a 20'x20' layout and a 2% grade."

modeltrains,2xpxz7,kellyzdude,2,Tue Mar 3 01:50:13 2015 UTC,"There are a handful of technical limiting factors when running longer trains:   Are the cars properly weighted, and do they behave when being pulled around curves? Minimum radius on the layout (relates to the above, but also independent). Maximum grade on the layout. Longest passing area. What the locomotive is physically capable of - the model, not the prototype.   For example, when I'm referring to my modular club, there aren't many modules set up for passing, so trains tend to run short. At the other club with its large fixed layout, there are some steep grades and some sidings aren't very long so they can be limiting in terms of operations - you can run over-length trains, but only in one direction.  Grades and curves are tricky, the tighter curves tend to cause problems more with derailments than they do with friction as the train wants to ""stringline"" and pull to the inside of the curve. If the cars aren't properly weighted (or not weighted at all) they're more likely to increase the probability of such an event.  And then there's the loco itself - can it pull 30 cars up that grade? Maybe, maybe not. I've seen 0-4-0 models that can, and Big Boy models that couldn't.  The only way to find out, in most cases, is to try."
modeltrains,2xpxz7,bach123479,4,Wed Mar 4 21:37:05 2015 UTC,"It also really depends on what you're doing with your layout. If you have a switching layout, it could be just the couple of cars you're moving to different industries. If you're pulling a consist it should be whatever looks good on the layout you have. I model the Vermont Railway as well, and for me it could be a couple grain hoppers at the feed plant or a 30 car consist of OMYA tank cars and hoppers."

This explanation, which may not be correct, is only for the brave ...  7mm scale is O gauge = 7mm to 1 foot but in the US this was rounded to one quarter inch to one foot.  4mm scale is 00 gauge = 4mm to 1 foot  HO is Half O gauge = 16.5 mm track gauge but here in the UK we carried on using OO trains on HO track. In the US the trains were corrected to 3.5 mm to the foot which is Half O gauge so the US models look small here but run on the track.  My advice: Don't get into this."

modeltrains,2xivcx,wpnw,2,Sun Mar 1 03:04:51 2015 UTC,"Doesn't ""two pickups"" mean that, while the train is straddling the insulated point, that the front pickup is being powered by one transformer, while the back pickup is getting power from the second transformer?  That can't be good, can it?"
modeltrains,2xivcx,reddRad,1 point,Sun Mar 1 04:02:56 2015 UTC,"This was my concern. I've done it, and it actually works... but I'm not sure how it affects the lifespan of these old transformers."
modeltrains,2xivcx,wpnw,1 point,Sun Mar 1 04:38:59 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be worried about the transformers at all, I'd be more concerned that the engines themselves would be harmed by surges if anything.  But like I said above, I don't think it would be a problem - what you described in your follow up post is very similar to what I used to run on, and we never had problems with transformers powering interconnected loops like this."
modeltrains,2xivcx,wpnw,1 point,Sun Mar 1 08:08:04 2015 UTC,"I think as long as you're not using transformers with two immensely different outputs, then it won't be a problem.  My dad used to be part of a local group that had a modular O-gauge layout that would set up at the local train shows, and we had it configured so that the inner and outer loops of the main line were powered by separate transformers - but there were interchange locations where you could switch tracks easily (and they were the insulated points).  We just made sure that the throttles were about at the same position and it was fine.  This was all before DCC was a thing, so it wasn't just a matter of give your track power and you're good.  If you have one maxed out and one set at minimum then you'll see the trail jerk and speed up or slow down, but I don't think it would damage the motors or anything - or at least it would take repeated, sustained use like that to induce damage.  I could be wrong though."
modeltrains,2xivcx,reddRad,2,Sun Mar 1 07:59:59 2015 UTC,"You want a train, powered by one transformer, to traverse a crossover switch and suddenly be controlled by the other transformer?  This is a very bad idea.  I'm curious if you've tried it, and what actually happens?  Generally, if you want two transformers to drive two trains, you divide up the layout into blocks.  You wire both transformers to a bunch of DPDT (double pole, double throw) switches, each of which is connected to one of the blocks of your layout.  Think of the controllers running a train, not a loop of track.  When you want the train to move into another loop/block, you make sure the switch is set for that train's controller to power that section of track.  (One caveat: I'm not familiar with Lionel 3-rail track.  If that works differently, then ignore everything I said.)"

modeltrains,2xivcx,DeliciousNoseClams,1 point,Sun Mar 1 15:42:05 2015 UTC,"A little extra explanation here...   I am running a train on the outer loop, which is transformer A. At the same time I'm running another train on the inner loop which is transformer B. I can park the train running the inner loop on a section of parking track, which is isolated, and kill it... and then I want to switch the train running on the outer track (transformer A) so it can leave it's circuit and run on the inner track (B) without stopping. This means the train would momentarily leave circuit A to cross over to circuit B which is two different speed controlled circuits. The dividing point is between the turn-outs.  Does this help? And does it sound stupid?   reddRad - 3 rail track is basically A/C positive voltage on center rail and outer rail is negative. A/C definitely behaves differently than HO does with DC power."

This is because I've been thinking about people's ideas and looking at lots of layouts and real world pics online. After all that I've come up with this. It is quite busy, yes. But that's really just how I like it. It has everything I want in it and is actually more of a 'functional' layout than my previous ideas. With the yards, extra stations and loader, the trains will actually have a bit more of a purpose than just driving around in circles as they did before. What you can't see on this image is that I will have a road coming under the raised station and the two mainline bridges, through a tunnel under the yard, then out to the front to deliver things to the raised loader. Trucks will be moved from the yard to be loaded here, then racked up ready to be taken.   Some things may need to be adjusted depending on the sizes of certain models I want. That's what I need to start looking into now."
modeltrains,2x2h4r,DietSeth,3,Wed Feb 25 02:57:31 2015 UTC,"Your plan has really come a long way from when it first started - I like it! Do you have any timeline for when you'll start building?  Someone may have already suggested this so I may be redundant here, but I'd suggest setting up the track and running some trains on it for a while before actually making anything final. I find for me that a layout may look great on paper, but once I start running trains on it is when I start finding things that I don't really like about it."
modeltrains,2x2h4r,capngrandan,2,Wed Feb 25 03:27:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  At this stage I don't have a timeline. I'm currently looking at the parts I have stored from buying bits and pieces over the years and working out what I'll need. The issue is space. I don't really have a lot of room in my current house. I'm moving this year. I had hoped it would be in the first quarter, but circumstances have meant that may be pushed back somewhat.  I definitely agree with laying it out. As I don't currently have the space, what I have done is been building the layout in Trainz simulator. That's how I found some of the problems with the previous build. I'm going to start creating this one in the simulator and then I was thinking about uploading a video to YouTube of it running in the simulator."

modeltrains,2wy9bk,marauder3058,1 point,Tue Feb 24 17:54:24 2015 UTC,I don't know what might be causing the Rule 17 issue but the stock lights in the engine are unfortunately very dim. There are built in resistors in the engine so the stock 1.5v lights can be used plug and play with any new decoder. It works but leaves the lights looking very weak (I have the same issue). I wouldn't be to surprised if that kit fixed all your problems although I haven't actually done it myself.

You could brush some thicker glue on the mountainsides and sprinkle ground cover on it.  Then vacuum up what doesn't stick.  But don't forget that in reality, very steep mountain walls/hillsides don't often have much vegetation on them, either, unless you live in a rain forest.  I think your hills look great."
modeltrains,2wtu9r,reddRad,1 point,Mon Feb 23 05:15:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I suppose the other option would be to make rocky  areas where the vegetation doesn't stick. I might have to figure out how to custom make rocks for those areas though"
modeltrains,2wtu9r,garethashenden,1 point,Mon Feb 23 12:38:19 2015 UTC,"If it were me, I'd want to smooth out the contours of the hills a bit. You've got a terraced look that looks a little odd. But aside from that, brush on white glue and the sprinkle on the ground cover. Don't bother diluting the glue, you don't want it to run."
modeltrains,2wtu9r,dakotabranch,1 point,Mon Feb 23 09:41:07 2015 UTC,Hmmm interesting. So smooth out the hills a bit more. I guess I can still keep some area flat for the rock outcroppings. Thanks for the idea!
modeltrains,2wtu9r,Jeff_Faust,1 point,Mon Feb 23 12:36:12 2015 UTC,"I think it looks like you are on the right track.  What have you tried?  How about painting on white glue with a crappy art paintbrush before you apply the foam?  In nature, surfaces that are steep like this are eroded or are exposed rock, lacking much vegetation.  I think you need to consider what it would look like when little or nothing is able to grow on a steep slope."

modeltrains,2wqb48,Xuttuh,2,Mon Feb 23 05:36:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, the 2"" Deep Throat C-Clamps from Harbor Freight are the best, cheapest clamp I've found.  They fit the end plates perfectly, and the deep throat clamps the modules near the top which reduces module sag.  Track is flush with the end plates and all alignment is by eye.  The build tolerance between person to person would never be able to accommodate alignment pins as perfect alignment is probably the most important part of operation.  If one alignment pin was just a hair off, you'd never be able to compensate.  It's just easier to align things by eye then clamp."

modeltrains,2wmc34,ThatRailsGuy,1 point,Sat Feb 21 03:09:25 2015 UTC,"I used black paint when I was a kid, but the only thing that did was show where your paint strokes were.  Possibly multiple coats would do the trick, though.  A couple other thoughts..  At the time, I had used grain of wheat bulbs, and they were waaaaay too bright.  Dimmer bulbs (hopefully LEDs these days) would be more realistic, and also help with the bleed-through.  Also, most kit windows are clear plastic, but unless you have real interiors, it'd be better to have them frosted (put some wax paper over them).  This also helps with diffusing the light.  One of these days I need to learn how to use LEDs for lighting buildings..."
modeltrains,2wmc34,reddRad,1 point,Sat Feb 21 07:32:36 2015 UTC,A coat of flat black on the interior is usually enough to block out light bleed. You'll need to do a couple coats though.
modeltrains,2wmc34,Pkwlsn,1 point,Sat Feb 21 08:58:10 2015 UTC,"Cut a rough interior out of black construction paper, and glue it to the inside of the walls.  Also make a room divider or 2 and tape/glue them in there.   That also prevents spectators from being able to see right thru the building's windows to whatever is behind.  Actual interiors are not that hard to do rough approximations of, though. Most buildings don't need to be super detailed on the inside. Cut a set of curtains out otf a caralog, magazine or flyer and stick them to the inside of a window. Put up some wallpaper (more construction paper, or to be fancy the inside of a patterned envelope with a wash of some colour)"

modeltrains,2wk61e,capngrandan,4,Sat Feb 21 03:35:03 2015 UTC,"If you do use them, make sure you open them up and give them a good clean and lube job. When trains sit for that long the lubrication usually dries up and gunks. Diesels are pretty easy to take apart too so you got that going for ya."
modeltrains,2wk61e,capngrandan,2,Fri Feb 20 17:45:00 2015 UTC,Yeah I nailed a 3'-4' piece of flextrack to a piece of wood and cleaned it.  I started with 1000 grit sandpaper and water.  Then after it dried i wiped it with rag and pink eraser and more gunk from the rails came up.  Then I attached my old controller and a lot of the trains were jerky and grumbly.

modeltrains,2whyg8,JustinMagill,1 point,Fri Feb 20 14:44:29 2015 UTC,Is it true that it sends DC voltage on the rails at the same time as AC when you hit the whistle switch?
modeltrains,2whyg8,JustinMagill,1 point,Fri Feb 20 17:22:06 2015 UTC,No its not exactly DC. That would stall the motor. I think it does switch to a half wave rectifier so its a positive voltage in addition to the extra volts.

Too many people think of model trains as ""toys"" and as such, don't fully grasp the value and love that the models hold.  Anyways, I'd recommend getting in touch with the closest active NMRA division (see here for listings: www.nmra.org/regions .) If anything, they can help you with identifying and pricing the items for sale, plus you'll probably end up selling some of them to the members if they see something they ""need.""  I am quite grateful that you appreciate the hobby and don't write it off as some weird interest held by people who never grew up like some people think.

The bad part of that is that he worked hard all his life and this was a hobby through his life and he worked hard at this too. I don't know if he'd appreciate selling it in a block to someone who might not appreciate it appropriately.

modeltrains,2w0twy,fotbr,2,Mon Feb 16 02:56:01 2015 UTC,"Apologies in advance for the wall of text.  The problem I have with paying to have a car weathered by someone who knows what they're doing is this:  I have more than one car.  A lot more.  Having only a few weathered cars would look out of place amongst a bunch of new shiney ones.    If your price was a flat $10 per piece -- as a number picked entirely to make the math nice -- to get my fleet of coalporters and coalveyors done would run me $380.  Add another $20 to get two engines done so they look like they've been on the coal run for a few years, and I'm up to $400.  Now, keeping in mind the time and materials that go into a good weathering job like your example piece, $10 per car would be way too low, and is not meant to be a serious ""what I'd pay"" answer, but it serves to illustrate the problem with having large fleets of cars and paying someone else to weather them -- even a cheap cost adds up very quickly.  Still here?  Good.  If I were you, and wanting to make it a side business, I'd set up a small website with some good before/after photos of your work, figure out what your time is worth, make up some flyers, business cards, and a display case with some of your stuff in it and spend the $20 or whatever for a table at a local train show.  Show off your work, hand out flyers & cards, etc.  Talk to the people coming by your table, get a feel for your customer base.  If you're swamped with orders, your prices might be too low.  If people flee in terror when they see your prices, they might be too high.  Maybe you find you need tiers of weathering?  ""Basic"" could be a quick spray of dullcoat to knock the shine off, and maybe a bit of grime.  ""Complete"" could be more involved and detailed, like your example.  Maybe you charge more for steam engines than diesels (or the other way around).  Maybe take a page from Flo and offer multi-car discounts if they're all getting the same treatment that lets you assembly-line it instead of doing everything one at a time.  TLDR - Set some prices, set up at a train show, listen to feedback, adjust according to your market."
modeltrains,2w0twy,smoothinto2nd,2,Mon Feb 16 23:43:19 2015 UTC,"If I were you I'd do up a couple sets (probably 3-4 cars each) make sure they'd fit in a smaller flat rate box then see if you can set a price, shipped that people bite on. I'm actually going to be trying this soon myself with custom graffitied/weathered cars. I'm hopping using used cars in good condition I can at least make a little money of it. I'm not expecting to even make what my time is worth from a monetary stand point but It's partly to just fund the hobby of the act of weathering/graffiting the cars."
modeltrains,2w0twy,trainz64,1 point,Wed Feb 18 02:15:17 2015 UTC,"Not really sure, but just saying that the most expensive part is always gonna be shipping if you try to do something like this. There's a couple other people that do custom work and stuff and just to send the car to them is like 2-3 times the price of the actual work. So just keep in mind that unless whoever you're doing it for is close enough that they don't have to pay 30-40 dollars+ for shipping, people are going to have to fork out a lot of money to have you do this.  But on the nicer side of things, good luck!"

For local guys, sure....for a flat rate, since weathering is really fun and when properly done, adds to the realism.  EDIT:  Not to rant...but a fair amount of model train guys don't have a solid scale modeling background, thus when they build layouts, weather cars etc...you end up with crappy results.  If you combine the two skills, you truly will have a beautiful setup."

Using Atlas #6 switches and Flex Track, I got something roughly 5' in length. If you changed out the switches for something of a smaller number like #4s (something dependent on the rolling stock you're using), you'll be able to save space there.  Hope this helps!"

N scale is neat if you wanna build models of really big bridges but the detail work can be hell on the eyes if you don't like looking at tiny things. O scale would probably require more scratch-building and there might not be as many detail casting and such available but all my trains are HO or N so I have no clue what the O scale market is like for modelling.

modeltrains,2vow9q,hailasia,3,Thu Feb 12 21:03:35 2015 UTC,"Hi there, I think I can help you with some of the questions.   CFF is actually the french name for the federal swiss railways (Chemin de Fer Fédéraux suisse), which is called SBB in german  and FFS in italian. The class seems to be a Re 460, a swiss electric engine mainly used for express passenger service With the ICEs I'm not really sure what you have there, some pics would help. One thing I'm certain is that the cars with the blue  don't belong with the ICE, these are older regular passenger wagons for intercity services. The cargo locos are TRAXX' family locomotives for freight, numbered by the SBB CFF FSS as Re 482 and 484. The green ones appear to be Re 420's, also known as Re 4/4II . They are multi-purpose engines and are both used for freight and passenger services. Not sure on the one with ""the the diamond shaped wire touching thing"", photos and/or somebody else might help. And by the way, these things are called pantographs.   So in general you have the some of the most important swiss engines plus some cars and something for a german intercity and an ICE, could be a perfect start for a swiss layout. Its certainly doable if you have the will and the $$$ to make it a reality.  Oh and for the value: it's really difficult to estimate over the internet and also depends on the condition and the age of the models, as older ones are usually not that detailed."

The track just clicked together, and the controller just connected to these dongles underneath the tracks. However, marklin, priding itself on fine details, are very sensitive. Little pieces break off easy and the coupling break like thin ice, so be careful. They should each be worth a decent penny each."

Go to your local big box home improvement store and get some chicken wire (you only need a small amount).  If you can, try to get as thin a gauge as possible (and if you have a choice, get the smallest holes possible).    Once you get the chicken wire shaped the way you want the hills to look, get some old news paper and make some homemade 'Modge Podge' (mix water with Elmer's glue...or any white glue).  You don't need to mix much, but make sure you use enough glue (it should have the consistency of Jell-o, before it's been refrigerated).  Cut the newspaper into strips (about 1"" wide by 3""-4"" long).  Soak the strips briefly and lay then on top of the wire.  Do this until you've covered the area.  Once you've got it covered, allow it to dry overnight.  After it's dried, it'll be pretty durable and you can paint on it, or attach whatever else you're building.  You can also use this method to make durable buildings (if you have the skill and patients to work with the wire).  Check out YouTube for other useful videos.

Cabooses provided shelter for crew at the end of a train, who were required for switching and shunting, and to keep a lookout for load shifting, damage to equipment and cargo, or overheating axles (hot boxes). Designs were originally modified box cars or flatbed cars carrying a cabin, but later became specialised vehicles, with projections above or to the sides of the car so crew could observe the train from shelter. The car also served as the conductor's office, and on long routes, included accommodation and cooking facilities.

I think a location for the controls will make itself more apparent once you figure out things like the height of the shelf.    You might consider adding an engine house or RIP track to the upper left or upper right corner, just as an excuse for a building.  Maybe a yard tower in the middle?  And a row of flats along the back would add a lot of interest without using much room.  They are commercially available if you don't want to scratch build them (""Radical Flats"" are one line that comes to mind)."

modeltrains,2vdqa7,luckyjezter,1 point,Wed Feb 11 08:25:04 2015 UTC,"I do like that layout quite a lot!  Thanks for pointing it out.  Unfortunately, my bookcase shelf has only 8"" of clearance, so going vertical will be extremely tight."
modeltrains,2vdqa7,luckyjezter,2,Wed Feb 11 15:33:41 2015 UTC,"Right off hand, you could do some sort of industry.  I am not sure what type of background, if any, that you plan on doing but you could make a few flat face buildings on each end for the back tracks on each side.    As far as the controller goes, it depends on how you have the bookcase.  It could be on the shelf under this one.  When I thought about doing this once, I planned on mounting a board just under the shelf and have it like this.  You can mount the controller, any switches, or anything else on it.  You could recess it back as well.  As for the wiring, if you did what I mentioned above, it would hide the wiring as well.  If you decided to have the controller elsewhere, you could also use a router bit and cut grooves to hide the wires in.  Lastly, and this is a suggestion I gave someone else the other day, build an coffee table or such with an N-scale layout in it.  It is one of my next projects that I am going to start hopefully later this year.  Have to finish my HO-scale around the room shelf layout first."
modeltrains,2vdqa7,Jeff_Faust,1 point,Tue Feb 10 05:04:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions.  Definitely want to do some kind of flat buildings on the background, and yes, those could be industries for the rear tracks.  Any idea if flats are sold?  Or maybe I could buy one kit and use all four sides as four buildings?  Wonder how that would look..  For the controller and wiring, at this point, I would prefer all the shelves in this bookcase to look the same, so I don't want to add depth to this shelf, but I agree, that's the simplest way.  And definitely, the coffee table is on my wish list, but I wanted to develop some skills doing this shelf first, before moving on to larger projects.  Thanks again for the feedback!"
modeltrains,2vdqa7,Jeff_Faust,2,Tue Feb 10 05:52:55 2015 UTC,"Hey, no problem.  That is what we are here for.  I think buying a building and using the sides would be a good idea.  I have seen where some people bought several of the same building to make a larger building since all the parts look the same and came from the same set.  All the sides would be similar in design and color and all so you could create a false flat building of any type then.  It would be very unique."
modeltrains,2vdqa7,Jeff_Faust,2,Wed Feb 11 04:26:26 2015 UTC,"You could probably forego the runaround at the right end, save the cost of the two turnouts, and lengthen the spurs just a teeny bit. I don't think the plan would suffer with just a single runaround.   As for the controller...you any good with a soldering iron? Build a simple throttle right into the layout.   Overall, looks good. Nice, simple plan with a lot of potential."
modeltrains,2vdqa7,Xuttuh,1 point,Tue Feb 10 21:08:19 2015 UTC,"You're right, the one on the left is a little small, anyway.  I just wasn't sure if I wanted to traverse nearly the whole layout to do a runaround.  I'll think about it.  I don't have a problem soldering.  My MRC Tech II is pretty huge.  Do you have any suggestions for a compact home design?  Thanks for the comments!"
modeltrains,2vdqa7,Xuttuh,2,Tue Feb 10 21:14:43 2015 UTC,"Here's the throttle I built into my layout ten years ago. The circuit is based on one in a Peter J. Thorne book from decades ago. I've gone DCC, but it still sees occasional use. You'd need only one reverse toggle, not two (there's a reverse loop in this layout).   As you may be aware, I'm also a big fan of Arduino-based throttles.    I just wasn't sure if I wanted to traverse nearly the whole layout to do a runaround.    Of course you do! You want to spend more time running the train!"
modeltrains,2vdqa7,Jeff_Faust,1 point,Wed Feb 11 01:15:42 2015 UTC,"After some research, I've decided on this walk-around throttle.  That way, I can hang it at the end of the shelf, and not take any space on the layout.  It seems silly to have a walk-around all for 7 feet of track, but when switching cars, it sure will be nice not to have to walk back and forth from a stationary throttle.   Of course you do! You want to spend more time running the train!   You've got an excellent point there!  Thanks!"
modeltrains,2vdqa7,Xuttuh,3,Wed Feb 11 03:15:14 2015 UTC,Good choice on the throttle. That should work nicely.

modeltrains,2vdqa7,Xuttuh,1 point,Wed Feb 11 11:22:18 2015 UTC,"Interesting throttle. There doesn't appear to be any smoothing of the rectified DC, so you wouldn't get a constant DC. I can't figure out what the cut off switch does. How do you use that?"
modeltrains,2vdqa7,Jeff_Faust,1 point,Wed Feb 11 11:21:54 2015 UTC,"PWM is pretty common for small-DC-motor control these days. All my Arduino-based throttles use it. Conventional model-railroad wisdom (dating back to the '60s) says that pulses are bad news for locomotives, but my experience has been good."
modeltrains,2vdqa7,Xuttuh,1 point,Wed Feb 11 21:32:06 2015 UTC,"The argument was that is builds up heat in the motors due to full power being applied verses the EMF back force. That puts more heat into the windings, and shortens motor life. But as you say, PWM is used almost everywhere, and I think many DCC systems use it.  For your overload protection, you use a crowbar circuit and pop a fuse. Have you considered using a 12v zenner?  What does the cutoff switch do on your throttle?"
modeltrains,2vdqa7,PM_ME_YOUR_CHESTHAMS,1 point,Wed Feb 11 21:45:46 2015 UTC,"The fuse has since been upgraded to a 0.75A polyfuse, which has worked fine. The switch labelled ""Cutoff"" is just a second reversing switch, for the reverse-loop portion of the layout. A simple oval would not need it."

I built mine, pretty much like a kitchen table type thing.  6 legs for stability, a frame 3x7 ish, with the table part ontop. This has worked well with the frame further in, as my table has a slot car track in the middle, so needs chairs to sit up to/under it, so needed the frame part reset. BAD part about that is.. now that I am running wiring.. a lot of it is on the OUTSIDE of the frame under the edge :( didn't think of that.

But you could very easily paint the whole thing green, then some black or brown roads, blue lake or stream, etc.  It won't be amazing, but it'll be better than bare plywood.  But if your husband has no interest in scenery, I'm not sure you should be pushing him this direction.  Instead, you might ask to join him in his hobby, and you take over scenery duties, while he handles the trains.  Might even bring you two closer together to share an activity."

Seems too 'zoomed in' compared to what I'm thinking, wondering if anyone had seen any pictures that might provide inspiration.  Definitely not keen to push him in to scenery if it doesn't excite him- I had originally thought to do it with him as you mentioned, and a couple of years ago he was looking at a little bit of scenery stuff and I was going to do that element if he wanted it, but I think he's settled happily into his more pared back approach, just wondering if there are any nice options now that he can have some dedicated space for it (probably not horizontal space left out all the time until our baby is a bit older, but collapsible on the wall at least). It currently just looks a bit unfinished with blue foam and plywood.... My other thought was even to just get a nice piece of wood now he has had a chance to figure out a good layout, as neither of us is a big fan of plywood texture/colour if it's going to be visible on a whole wall length. He seemed fairly keen on the flat map idea I think, but I had the same problem I'm having here if not being able to articulate well what I'm picturing, I think I need to grab some butcher's paper and see if I can sketch it out (may be hampered by my lack of drawing skills but hopefully can get the idea across lol)"

modeltrains,2v99lp,jarleek,3,Mon Feb 9 05:17:02 2015 UTC,"Growing up, my dad had an flat HO layout that was on a 4'x4' piece of plywood that hung over their bed.  It was hinged to the wall and when he was ready to use it, he would lower it down.  It was held to the wall via a long chain and was unhooked to lower it.  Once in place, the chain would be stretched out to the furthest point to hold it up.  From there, he would add what buildings and such that was not able to stay on it while folded onto the layout.    The same should be easily done with an N-scale layout.  However, depending on its size, you might get him to look into doing a layout built into a coffee table or something along that line.  That is what I plan on doing in the future.  It will serve as a dual purpose and wouldn't take up anymore room that is already there.  Just a thought..."

However, you can still make a nice switching layout.  Another option would be to have the shelf/layout removable, so when you really have to have a full loop you can take it to a table, and connect some snap track to it for a loop. (see here)  And a third option would be to just do a modular layout, which again, you could assemble at a table then disassemble and store (T-Trak would be perfect for this)  Since you are working in such a small space, I highly recommend you check out Carendt. If you go through the Small Layout Scrapbook, you can find hundreds of micro layouts. A micro layout is an entire, operable model railroad in less than four square feet of space. Be sure to take note of the various methods for packing a lot of punch in a tiny space."

modeltrains,2v3h8a,ANGR1ST,2,Sun Feb 8 18:37:34 2015 UTC,Are those all the turnouts you own?  You could invert the entire layout left to right. That'd get you the same operational capability as having the trains enter from the current lower left.
modeltrains,2v3h8a,Xuttuh,1 point,Sat Feb 7 19:59:38 2015 UTC,I do own a few more turnouts but would have to buy a couple new ones to completely mirror the layout. That's fine though since I'm planning on replacing some of my current turnouts anyway since I've found that some of the older brass stuff isn't so happy with my new DCC system. I like your idea of just mirroring the layout - I might just go with that. Thanks for the input!
modeltrains,2v3h8a,Xuttuh,2,Sun Feb 8 18:39:02 2015 UTC,You might consider making one of the lead tracks a hump yard for a bit of added interest.  The other thing you might try is flipping the layout 180 and running the feed from the cassette via a line across the front
modeltrains,2v3h8a,ruitfloops,1 point,Sat Feb 7 22:23:28 2015 UTC,The hump yard idea is great!

modeltrains,2v3h8a,roj2323,2,Sun Feb 8 18:41:02 2015 UTC,"yeah, the angles and gap make it very interesting. You could easily have a wharf scene along the left side. Maybe you'll need to invest in some more points to mirror the layout left to right rather than flip it."

Just a couple, or maybe three.  Somewhere where you can shunt the outbound cars and pick up the inbound.  It adds somewhere for the cars to go or pick up from, just something more than a single track.  Maybe the area in the lower right?  Your runaround's short, but then that ups the challenge as you can only do a couple cars at a time."
modeltrains,2v3h8a,quillsandsofas,1 point,Sun Feb 8 02:14:34 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input! I think my redesign will incorporate a small interchange yard as you suggested. I am limiting my trains to and from the staging area to 2 or 3 cars so the small runaround isn't a huge deal. I think my redesign will also increase the runaround size though.

Without having the trackplan I can only guesstimate, but it looks like over half of the track is hidden from view and this is quite a lot! It's your layout of course but my advice is to try and tone them down a little."
modeltrains,2v0o0q,milkymoocowmoo,1 point,Sat Feb 7 00:14:10 2015 UTC,looks like a nice layout but I have to caution you against placing two  switches back to back. In my experience it's a great way to derail trains because the ittle bit of slop in the wheel sets will push off one point can catch the second. even adding an inch or two between the switches would help prevent this issue.

The layout space is purely theoretical right now, so it'll likely have to be revised for the space constraints of my first actual apartment, but I'm considering it my achievable dream layout for now (as opposed to the dream layouts of my childhood which rivaled Miniatur Wunderland in size and scope).    But what do you guys think?  Suggestions?  Things that don't make sense?  EDIT: things I forgot to mention: it's HO scale, the area shown is 3'x9'-ish, the track going down offscreen goes to a staging yard which is basic and uninteresting, and the wye switch with the short stubs on the far right is a placeholder for a Walthers carfloat apron or something similar."

Also what is your plan with the docks?"

Right now, my thoughts are a fuel distributor and a team track with a transfer warehouse.  The two-tracked spur on the left side was a late addition, so I'm not entirely sure what I want to do for a third industry, or what I want to go where, but I definitely have time to figure that out.

If you want to move from the outer loop to the inner, that's fine. But if you want to move from the inner to the outer you have to reverse.

OP you are more than welcome to do whatever you want obviously because this is YOUR layout and not ours. I'd suggest though taking a step back and simplifying things. Think about what industries you want to model, and what kind of cars you want to have on your layout. Do you want to model industries? Switch out certain cars to certain places?

modeltrains,2utxdp,reddRad,1 point,Thu Feb 5 04:36:00 2015 UTC,I've been playing with an idea for a layout that tries to balance the running room/distance a bit better without just filling every square inch of space with track.   Solution I've come up with is folding two reversing loops over each other... ie. Like this have to sacrifice a second mainline but I'm also not convinced a 4x8 HO layout can truly support dual mainlines.  (And OP: before committing yourself to a layout I highly recommend taping out a box on the floor and test fitting like so - will help you work through any real-life issues a program like SCARM can't catch)

Layout with heights  The upper level actually doesn't reach full height until closer to the yard so there's a good stretch to rise over. I expect my next tweak will be dropping the lower loop after the switch to see if I can buy myself a little more room.  Edit: Actually looking at it again - I may just bury the bottom loop altogether and fold it back on itself then I can use that whole front side for a gentle grade down to it."

modeltrains,2us35y,MikeCharlieUniform,2,Wed Feb 4 18:32:19 2015 UTC,"I just discovered this site, looking for a way to let me model my 11'x17' space based on the guidelines in Armstrong's book, ""Track Planning for Realistic Operation: Prototype Railroad Concepts for Your Model Railroad"".  After I figured out my minimum curve radius, I worked up a table of other minimums, and calculated that my squares for planning should be 14 1/4"" (a 90 degree turn fits in a square - 12"" minimum mainline radius, dual tracks, with a minimum spacing between tracks).  I needed a little less than 15 squares by 10 squares, but didn't want to plot stuff out on the tiny squares on regular graph paper. So I just printed out a 11x17 piece of paper with crosshairs every inch. Perfect for starting to sketch out track plans.

To exit the FUNC+(10|20) modes, press FUNC again. To check/change any functions you enabled in those upper ranges, you'll need to re-enter the relevant FUNC mode to do so.

modeltrains,2ucjrq,Axiryth,1 point,Sat Jan 31 22:32:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks to the suggestion of a redditor yesterday, I've recreated my layout in SCARM in order to play with the hight issue. In SCARM, it lets me adjust the gradient of individual track. As I do so it colour codes the height. Up to 2.4% is green, 2.5-3.9% yellow, 4.0% and over is red.  I'm assuming green is all good and red means way too steep. But I'm curious about the yellow. Going as steep as I can in green only gets me to a height of 1.34 inches for the bridge. Far short of what I wanted. If I go into the yellow, however, I could improve that. Adjusting gradients to the high end of the yellow bracket gives a bridge height of 2.13 inches. But from what I've been told, 3.9% is probably too steep for a lot of things.  For the record, the biggest train I'll be using is a Bachmann Gordon pulling four express coaches. So it needs to climb the hill. The less powerful trains would be Bachmann Thomas and Percy pulling small carriages and trucks."
modeltrains,2ucjrq,dwwojcik,1 point,Sat Jan 31 22:40:04 2015 UTC,"This is OO/HO, right?  If that's the case then 2.13 inches is nowhere near enough.  The NMRA recommends at least  3 5/32 inches."
modeltrains,2ucjrq,The_Valar,2,Sun Feb 1 00:12:47 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It still wont be enough. But if I lower the track underneath to go below the level of the board slightly, then I may be able to get enough. Unfortunately I don't think the software allows me to do negative height. So the only way to test is to raise the entire layout up by a set amount."
modeltrains,2ucjrq,The_Valar,1 point,Sun Feb 1 00:16:46 2015 UTC,Is there a particular reason you want to have the curved track leading off the board? It seems to be giving you some trouble in the design.  Maybe if you considered using that set of points to access a factory or similar with a siding or two of its own?  You could still have the bridges to carry the track over a river or drainage culvert?
modeltrains,2ucjrq,kent_eh,1 point,Sun Feb 1 04:23:19 2015 UTC,Not really. It was originally going to be a road or river. But when I rearrange the yard and had a section of track in that direction I thought I'd try and work it in. But I don't see how at this stage. I think I'm best off to forget it and go back to the original plan.
modeltrains,2ucjrq,gdkitty,2,Sun Feb 1 05:30:40 2015 UTC,Something like this is what sprung to my mind.   The factory might still work with the tracks on different levels. It might rely on you making your own structure though.

modeltrains,2u90so,Axiryth,7,Fri Jan 30 23:19:05 2015 UTC,This one is by far the best of the three. I might have some concerns about the triple bridge but I am unsure about the elevation you're planning in the layout. If you have the track increasing in elevation while going through the tunnel you can probably make it happen but then you're also going to need to deal with changing elevations across the three tracks in the left side of the layout. Personally I'd make it flat and maybe do a cross over of those three tracks if you're set on that branch off.
modeltrains,2u90so,dorpal_the_great,3,Sat Jan 31 00:28:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, even though it's my favorite so far, I do still have a number of concerns ranging from minor, to plan breaking.   You can see some joints on the curves don't quite match up. But I'm confident a bit of flexi track will help correct that. Height. I'm not yet positive I can get the height for the bridges. The gradient will start at the tunnel entrance at the front and again at the opposite side, so I will have to contend with a triple track gradient, I think I'll be ok with that. But I'm still not sure there's enough length to get the height I need. Bridge pieces. I don't yet know what lengths and widths the bridge pieces come in. That back bit might need to be reworked if they're shorter or longer than I anticipate. The station. I know the length of the platforms of the kit I'm using. But I don't know the width if each platform. Hopefully it'll fit in the gaps I've left in front, in between and behind those tracks at the front. If not, I'll have to rethink that area. I'm not sure if I've left enough room for the roundhouse and the elevation of the track to the left. I may need to being the roundhouse and the turntable slightly more into the centre of the board."
modeltrains,2u90so,scoobyduped,2,Sat Jan 31 00:59:40 2015 UTC,Try setting it up in SCARM.  That should let you play around with the elevation in a way you can visualize.

modeltrains,2u90so,Hidiousclaw,1 point,Sat Jan 31 11:14:53 2015 UTC,"This is the third draft. After a suggestion from redditor u/reddrad got me looking in a different direction, I made major changes. This incorporates a lot of his idea along with retaining a lot of my original ideas plus all of my 'must have' elements. I'm much happier with this one. But ideas and suggestions are still most welcome. The scale on the board is set to feet this time. So one square is one square foot.  I'd like to do a little more with the shunting yard. But I'm not sure about overcrowding it. I thought maybe bring the main arm more in to the left, extend the arms longer on the right and maybe fit an extra arm or two at the back off to the right. Any suggestions?"

modeltrains,2u48u7,dakotabranch,1 point,Thu Jan 29 20:20:38 2015 UTC,Nice shots.  The only beef I have is mainly with all engines that have lit number boards.  They don't look good because they bleed out too much light around the edges.  And they typically lack enough definition to be credible in more well lit (simulated daytime) conditions.    I've partially solved the bleed problem when I have the engine disassembled for painting and DCC.  I hand-paint a very dark color on as much of the non-exposed part of the clear plastic as I can.  Soldering because the rails are painted?
modeltrains,2u48u7,MichaelArnold,1 point,Thu Jan 29 22:59:53 2015 UTC,"Most likely because the joiners are not too great, and soldering will lead to much better connectivity."

modeltrains,2tz3un,ComancheCrawler,2,Wed Jan 28 16:21:33 2015 UTC,"There are two programs which I have designed many layouts on.  Railmodeller and Empire Express. Both programs have their faults and neither is a complete well rounded program.   Recently Railmodeller updated it's software to a more mouse friendly version (railmodeller Pro) but many features including 3D rendering are missing and I don't recommend purchasing it until those issues are resolved. (It was also recently pulled from the mac app store for bugs)  Railmodeller's old version 4.1.9 is ok to use but not being able to set switches on a grade, poor 3D rendering and a finicky tool pallet with missing features makes it a challenge to put together a plan in a timely manner.    Empire Express is a better program in that the tool pallet is more complete and easier to use but the main drawback to the program is the track is drawn only as a line and the track pallet is far from complete.   Empire Express examples:   HO  https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7565/15627909927_e828925f0b_b.jpg  N  https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8661/15193136954_b63d7ed256_b.jpg  HO  https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3821/10440395216_2b83d1c08f_b.jpg  Sorry but I have not publicly posted any railmodeller layouts yet.   .  .  .  .  .

The track is quite oxidized (brashish collored to begin with I think, plus with age).  Also over LARGE curves, etc.. connecting the multiple sections is really a pain.  All in all for the track itself, you would likely be better to go with your newer stuff (not sure what you got). The newer FLEX track is GREAT to work with :)"
modeltrains,2tz2jt,gdkitty,1 point,Wed Jan 28 17:41:08 2015 UTC,"Judging by the brand names, I'm guessing you live ""accross the pond"" and I'm not terribly familiar with the various brands over in Europe, but it sounds like older equipment that will hold you back as you try to move forward. Pictures would definitely help us tell the quality.  ""Most looks to have been silverish in color, but has now lost its shine and looks dull."" Sounds like aluminum rails? I doubt the (now) standard nickle silver rails get to be that dirty, but I could be wrong. Probably a good idea to dump the track and purchase new track, since lousy rails make even the best equipment run like crap.  If the trains themselves are all about the same quality as Tyco, then they're crap and should be replaced as soon as you can. My feeling on early train purchasing is that you should always spend your money on a small amount of higher-end equipment, rather than a large amount of low-end equipment. There's one layout I operate on that has a large amount of crappy equipment saved from 30+ years ago, and the owner is pretty much stuck using it because he cannot practically afford enough good-quality equipment to offset this. He makes do, but its clear that he should have focused on quality rather than quantity."

Even back then it was my uncle's left overs and old stuff he didn't want anymore. I'll post pics of it all as soon as I'm able. I'm thinking it may be aluminum. Some darker track looks the color of brass too. But it's all darkened and looks oxidized.  I'll post images of the trains and rolling stock too. I'm not sure of the brands off the top of my head. But I'm going to use them to practice my weathering skills before I throw them away. Unless they do actually turn out to be valuable, but I doubt it.  The one thing I didn't mention in my original post, which I'll post pics of too, is a whole heap of Hornby points. Left and right standard, no express. These are still in their packaging and the rails don't look tarnished or anything. I only need a couple for my layout and was thinking of selling the rest.

Maybe from the top right and then come in two rows with switches? Although I just remembered you wanted elevation along the back. Are both lines going to be elevated?
modeltrains,2tu6oj,Hidiousclaw,1 point,Tue Jan 27 15:03:26 2015 UTC,"I agree. I want to find a way to make it accessible directly from the main track. But as the back half of the layout is going to be raised, I'm not quite sure how. I was thinking of moving one of the loop cross overs to the back. As they will both be raised they could cross over back there just fine, as long as it doesn't interfere with the bridge.

I'm brand new to trains myself, but I've found it makes me a lot happier to have room to build up industries around the yards. My layout is N Scale 2' x 4' (so exactly the same size in scale).  For instance, I have a ""town"" section with a passenger platform and some warehouses, and an ""industrial"" section with an oil field and some coal mining. This way I can deliver coal and oil to the town, run freight and passenger on the main line, and deliver crew changes and beer to the coal miners and oil field. My personal opinion is that your layout will be too crowded, but I'm a novice myself (so what do I know?).  Best of luck with whatever you decide!  edit: Also, I think you have more width than you're giving yourself credit for. Looking at the grid lines, that doesn't look 1.2m wide to me."

Have fun and post pics when you make progress!'  edit: Just to parallel the original comment, I think you have more length to play with also. Looking closer, I don't think you're pushing 2.4 meters long yet either. I do tend to run my trains dangerously close to the edge though..."
modeltrains,2tu6oj,Duke_Thunderkiss,2,Wed Jan 28 06:04:38 2015 UTC,I think the theme or era you're using makes a lot of difference to the type of layout you're happy with. You nailed it with the visual of the trains in the roundhouse around the turntable. I've still got a long way to go before I'm happy with the layout though I think.  When I start my next plan I'm going to measure out the correct length on the grid and mark it with a piece of rail or something so I know exactly where I am.

The factory itself wasn't very unique, just a generic 2-storey pre-fab steel building painted beige, sitting on a rail siding, with a large electrical transformer sitting next to the building between the rail siding and the truck loading dock.

modeltrains,2tuqmu,Trainguyrom,4,Tue Jan 27 19:01:54 2015 UTC,"One method of reducing the real estate that large facilities consume is to have the facility be a siding next to the backdrop (with a visual blocker) and then the facility itself would be painted/printed on the backdrop (so, off the layout).  Also, don't forget that you can do interchanges for added switching as well as being a source for comodities that you couldn't otherwise model.  There are some pretty standard industries too, like a food processing plant, furnature factory, etc.  And finally, you can quite realisticly place multiple industries on one siding. If the furnature factory is next to the food processing plant, why have two sidings when you can just do one? This also makes for more switching, which can be fun, or you can also be lazy and not worry about being at the platform."

I'm not yet sure how long the bridge will be. I'm also still trying to work out my gradients and maximum elevation. I'll be running a variety of Bachmann Thomas & Friends on this layout along with a Hornby Flying Scotsman.

I find it frustrating that I can't select multiple pieces of track to move together, but have to move a section in individual pieces.   I also find it frustrating that I can't set my baseboard size so I can see the physical extent of my layout. Instead you just have to watch where the pre-set 1 metre increments are. That makes it a little difficult considering my layout is 1.2m X 2.4m.  The other thing is that it doesn't include some track pieces, mainly the flexi-track.   On the up side, I do like that it has actual Hornby track pieces, including the RRP in my local currency. It can give me an exact shopping list of what need to buy. I also thought I read somewhere that the plans can be imported into Railmaster. But I've since read that that is incorrect.  I like it and would recommend it. But it is the only software I've used. Others here may be able to recommend something better that I haven't tried."
modeltrains,2tq2e7,reddRad,1 point,Tue Jan 27 01:03:02 2015 UTC,"Is the plan for both of the mainline pair to go up in elevation?  If not, you could have one of them go up the hill and the other stay level, then have them cross in the middle of the back with one on the bridge and the other in the gulch.  That would give you (effectively) a double-length mainline.  If you did that and eliminated the crossovers in the front, the spur in front would then be 2 full laps away from the turntable, and vice versa.  Of course, if 2 mainline loops are important so you can always have 1 running, I understand that.  That's more my style, too."
modeltrains,2tq2e7,dakotabranch,1 point,Tue Jan 27 03:02:50 2015 UTC,I've been toying with that idea. I'm not positive either way yet. But at the moment I'm thinking both lines going up as I like the visual of the trains running opposite directions and passing each other by.

modeltrains,2tq2e7,flashmann,4,Mon Jan 26 22:14:06 2015 UTC,"I'm sure. I'm building the track I've been putting together in my head for twenty years. Sheds and a turntable are a MUST. As is a tunnel, a bridge, a level crossing, a station platform with a siding and a few other things. There are a number of 'must have' keys elements and those are among them. I know they take up a lot of room. But for twenty years I've wanted to build a layout with a shed and a turntable. Due to a variety of constraints, I'm only able to build one layout and no bigger than this. So this is my one opportunity to squeeze in as many of those key elements as I can. It's still a work in progress, but I'm determined to keep all of my key elements."

modeltrains,2tqiay,Magicmarq,2,Mon Jan 26 17:01:17 2015 UTC,"Just starting myself.. and going NECK DEEP here.. and with my 4 year old.. so I am going a little overboard :P (big 4x8 setup, etc) But I understand not everyone wants to go that way.  While they don't have necessarily all the fun stuff included.. a set might be easiest to begin with. Usually comes with an engine and set of cars, track for a basic circle or loop, transformer, sometimes a few extras.  While you have more selection of picking and choosing separately, can easily cost more.  I am at the 'decorating' phase... that's when it really starts to get expensive :("
modeltrains,2tqiay,gdkitty,2,Mon Jan 26 17:41:24 2015 UTC,"For kids I would recommend HO scale. O scale while larger and probably more kid friendly, can cost twice the amount as HO does. N scale in my opinion isnt very kid friendly until at least adolescence. Today, it generally costs the same as HO scale. But its size can require a more delicate touch.   Take a look at the Worlds Greatest Hobby website (http://www.greatesthobby.com/). As I have said before, since its a site made by the NMRA (National Model Railroad Association) and a lot of manufactures, it does contain a fair bit of sales propaganda. It does contain the blue print for the WGH layout, or as it is sometimes called, The Madison Central. Usually most starter sets that have an oval of track require the switches and a few other pieces to make the track plan itself.  As for a starter set well since its for a child and you plan to let him have it for a bit to see if hes legit got the train bug, Id recommend the set of your choice. There are a few things you might run into that might add difficulty to your decision. First being you will see sets that are DC or DCC. DCC is digital control and is being considered the future of model railroading. It will come with a DCC controller as opposed to a normal DC rectifier. A DCC system will require the locomotives that are run on it to have a DCC chip installed. You can also control two or more engines on the same layout at the same time, provided the system is set up to see them as individual engines (because you can set them up to run like the modern trains you see where you have more than one engine pulling a train. This is referred to as consisting or MUing). Even though SOME will let you run a DC engine on DCC tracks generally the speed control is limited to a constant speed, if the engine runs at all. With DCC wiring is more simple, and leaves room for expansion into making locomotives that sing and dance like the real thing, though it can get pricey. HOWEVER generally the most expensive part of DCC is the initial start up. For a simple layout, like the one I mentioned, the WGH layout, DC or DCC would not make much of a difference. With two DC engines on the same track, unless you added isolation switches to the blocks (basically make the section of track its own circuit), the engines would go in whatever direction and however fast the controller is dictating, regardless of anything. As for putting DCC engines on DC track SOME decoders have dual mode, but most people disable it as it can cause problems such as ghosting (where a DCC locomotive lags or doesnt respond to changes in controller output).  Heres a link to a search from Walthers (one of the biggest distributors in North America) showing all the HO sets in stock. You can narrow down the search even more using the bar on the left : http://www.walthers.com/exec/search?category=Trainset&scale=H&manu=&item=&keywords=&words=restrict&instock=Y&split=30&Submit=Search . You can even separate DC from DCC. You can also check out Athearn. They offer two sets: the Iron Horse and Warbonnet. Same simple premise. Their site hasnt been that great since last year so your local hobby shop that sells Athearn will be able to help you locate one easier.   My suggestion: Hard to say personally. A kid coming from Thomas might have a love for Steamers. Though lots of kids seem to love the modern container trains.   TL;DR: HO is probably your best bet for kids, research, determine if you want DC or DCC, go shopping."
modeltrains,2tqiay,Rayd8630,2,Tue Jan 27 01:22:27 2015 UTC,"One nice thing about HO, relative to N, is that there's a lot more ""construction-related"" stuff you can graduate into.  You can start them on simple shake-the-box kits, and move up to more and more advanced projects as he grows."
modeltrains,2tqiay,Bounty1Berry,2,Tue Jan 27 06:16:13 2015 UTC,"HO is a good start, I didn't get my kids an official starter kit I bought used at the local shop and went from there, they are still too rough to get new but they love what I get them none the less  Also one of the many interlocking track systems is the best place to start for kids. They can take down and rebuild the track at ease into any configuration they wish. When I was a kid I had to put up with a nailed down static train board! Kids today have it easy!"

modeltrains,2tqiay,gdkitty,2,Mon Jan 26 17:21:41 2015 UTC,"N is great for its size.. if I wasn't given a whole bunch of HO scale stuff.. I likely would have chosen N.  But N being smaller, might be a little more difficult to handle by your son?  (cars can be tricky to get on the track right, etc.. N just makes it even smaller to get on)"
modeltrains,2tqiay,dwwojcik,2,Mon Jan 26 17:43:46 2015 UTC,"I wasn't too much older than 6 when I got my first N-scale.  Until your son's motor skills develop some more he might need help getting the cars on the track, but as long as you can trust him to be gentle then I'd say N Scale is a fine choice.  As for Kato products, I highly reccomend them.  I don't have any of their trains, but my power pack and my track is all Kato.  It's a little pricier, but in this case you get what you pay for.  Metra is cool, I live in suburban Chicago less than a mile from a Metra station so I see these all the time.  I think the lights on the cab car model are directional which is sweet."

A nice change of pace from the Ntrak triple track mainlines.  On your wind turbine blade train - did you make (3D print?) the braces/supports?  Looked really nice.

modeltrains,2tnvzu,Axiryth,4,Sun Jan 25 23:26:57 2015 UTC,"Your maximum elevation depends on your maximum grade.  And the grade depends on a lot of things.  As a rule of thumb, most model railroad books recommend a maximum grade of 2%, meaning that as the track travels 100 inches, it can rise up to 2 inches in elevation.  However, if you decide you're only going to have very short trains so it's not hard to pull them up a steep grade, or you're always going to have multiple engines to pull up a steep grade, then you can go higher than 2%.  When I was a kid, I had an over-under figure-eight HO layout on a 4x8 sheet of plywood, using Tyco trestles.  To get up and over itself in one loop, and back down in another, was about a 3% grade.  It worked, but the train crawled going up, and ran like a bat out of hell going down.  It was incredibly unrealistic and unsatisfying."
modeltrains,2tnvzu,reddRad,1 point,Mon Jan 26 06:00:05 2015 UTC,Thank you. That's quite helpful. Unfortunately it means I may not get my bridge as high off the ground as I would like.
modeltrains,2tnvzu,reddRad,1 point,Mon Jan 26 15:43:28 2015 UTC,"If you want a bridge (which I agree is awesome for visual interest), I would suggest digging down rather than up.  What I mean is, when you lay track on a flat plywood, there's nowhere to go but up, and as we just discussed, it's difficult to have enough room to go very far up.  But imagine your track on stilts all the way around.  Your benchwork is already a foot below the tracks, so the track doesn't have to go up at all.  When you do the plaster or paper mâché terrain, you simply go down as far as you want the bridge to be high.  Sometimes people call this the cookie cutter method, where your plywood base is simply cut into the pattern of the tracks, and it's held up by risers attached to your benchwork.  It's a lot more work up front, but gives you a huge amount of freedom for your terrain."
modeltrains,2tnvzu,gdkitty,2,Mon Jan 26 17:08:10 2015 UTC,"Not positive on the elevation part... but I know, even on that LARGE of a layout..  really depends on how tight of a turn you want.  I am setting up a 4x8 table.. and its a 20"" curve (to allow some of the LONGER length passenger cars I have).  The track along the straight aways, is only about 1-2 inches from the edge.. and with the 20"" curves.. there is only maybe 3 inches along the 4' side.. before it curves back.. so  your upwards gradients, will be while the track is turning, likely?"
modeltrains,2tnvzu,catonic,1 point,Mon Jan 26 00:20:39 2015 UTC,"I'll post an image of my track plan when I get home. But yes, the gradients would be while the track is turning. In order to make the loop in the space I have, both 4' sides are completely curved. The only straights are on the 8' sides. I'm considering continuing the gradient along the straight at the back, but it depends on how much room is left on either side of the bridge that is to be the centerpiece of the back straight. I'm sure my terrible description will make more sense once I post the image."

modeltrains,2tnb96,SaltyBarnacles,2,Sun Jan 25 20:43:10 2015 UTC,"You might like to see what other people are doing on Youtube and look at pictures online. You need to decide on the scale you want to use, the type of trains you would like to run and the control system that suits your needs. I am especially impressed by mountainous logging and mining layouts from the States and Australia but my layout is nothing like those. It is LNER post war UK.  There is no need to rush into it. I have been building my layout for five years so far. I built a small military railway as a separate system so I could test and run trains whilst I am building mainlines and branch-lines around that but those loops could be a year away from being finished.  I spend a lot of time ""playing trains in my head"" so I can think through track-plans, clearances, sight lines and all the model detailing I want."
modeltrains,2tnb96,BagOfBrokenBits,2,Sun Jan 25 21:20:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Great advice!  And yeah, I had an idea for a huge big table with a mountain cut-away around one of the corners, so you could see inside of a tunnel, have like a detailed little mining tunnel type thing with buttresses and stuff like that. I'd make the whole thing from layered foam, and just cut it all away and kind of sculpt the landscape so to speak.   I have a feeling it'd be a ridiculously expensive venture though."
modeltrains,2tnb96,BagOfBrokenBits,1 point,Sun Jan 25 21:27:47 2015 UTC,"Yep, It will be a ridiculously expensive venture. Railway layouts usually are :-) However so are most hobbies and entertainments. One persons hobby is as valid as the next persons. Just spread the cost over time, shop for bargains, and don't spend money you cannot afford.  I use layered sheets of extruded polystyrene foam (Do not use expanded polystyrene, it isn't worth the mess) on a lightweight wooden frame on builders trestles. My layout is about 18 inches from the deepest quarry base to the top of the highest hill over tunnels. You don't need to build a huge heavy table so you can save on timber costs. Do research before you start buying stuff.  You need to be able to lift off the over-tunnel scenery sections or be able to access the track from underneath."
modeltrains,2tnb96,BagOfBrokenBits,2,Sun Jan 25 21:41:45 2015 UTC,"Cool!   The tunnel idea would only have a tiny little part of it actually being a tunnel, it'd just be a cutaway on the side so that you can see the whole inside of the tunnel. It's hard to explain, but it'd be just about as open as any other part of the set.   ...can you recommend any good beginner sets? I'm also not sure whether or not I want to go for HO which seems to have way more accessibility, or one of the smaller scales like Z or N. I have a lot of space, but I don't want to have to completely trash my setups if I have to move a few years from now."
modeltrains,2tnb96,BagOfBrokenBits,1 point,Sun Jan 25 21:46:19 2015 UTC,"I am in the UK, things are not the same, someone more local to you will be along in a minute :-)  I have a tunnel out of my quarry based military railway that leads through an open rocky gulley to connect to my Branch line. The access to the tunnel is through a hidden hole in my service well. Inside the tunnel the ballast is bright red, there is bright green scenery and a river of gold. It is independently lit with LED's and I am going to add gaming figures like dragons and trolls. It was going to be Area 51 but it evolved. It has nothing to do with the rest of the layout it's just a bit of fun. There is a layout on Youtube where all the underground mining detail has been put into place, some people are very talented but foam is surprisingly easy to work with.  My layout was originally designed to be dismantled and stored when I was still married, which is why it was made with a lightweight frame and stands on foldable trestles. The boards are narrow enough to fit into a cupboard and are only attached to each other with plastic bolts (so no tight rusted fittings) Although the track runs over the joints I could dismantle it without to much effort and it would be transportable and re-usable. So if you design these features in place now it will save work and expense later."
modeltrains,2tnb96,smoothinto2nd,1 point,Sun Jan 25 22:03:43 2015 UTC,"That sounds awesome. Do you have any pictures and videos of your setup?   Also, I think I'm going to go with HO. Is the track that expensive for something relatively large? Something like this seems to be something around the size I want. I might end up doing a big L shaped corner one so that I have more straightaway track, but I'm not so sure yet on layout."
modeltrains,2tnb96,smoothinto2nd,2,Sun Jan 25 22:08:04 2015 UTC,"At some stage I will post pictures here and on Youtube but I am hoping for an unveiling in a UK magazine when it is finished so I don't want to spoil the impact of that.  I use 00 scale which is the UK version of HO gauge (same track, slightly larger engines) I use set track on sidings and in some odd places but I use Peco flexible track for most lines which is cheaper per foot and should give better running. I have some used track bought on Ebay. My military railway is a loop of vintage track in desert sand from the Battle zone sets which I think is similar to a product still available in the States from Bachmann. I am going to use a grey version of this in my coal yards as it's what I had as a boy.  I have a double mainline and a double branch line with industrial sidings which is common in the UK. We have an up-line and a down-line and we drive on the left."
modeltrains,2tnb96,smoothinto2nd,2,Sun Jan 25 22:27:52 2015 UTC,"Welcome. I've got a few questions for you. Where are you located? How big is the space you have to put the layout? Do you have any plans to move?  Reading what you've wrote I think you right thinking HO is the scale to get into. It's the most popular and is the sweet spot when it comes to size, realism, price, and availability.  You've got things to consider like where you want to model, if you want recreate a specific place, era, or feel, or if you want to just do your own thing. At least having an idea of what you like will be good so you don't invest in equipment you end up not wanting or using down the line.  I used to live in California and remember Southern Pacific and Union Pacific pretty well and I like the look of the older diesels so I model stuff that's based on the west coast. I don't have a specific local but have certain equipment I go after.  You can choose between DC and DCC control. That's Direct control where all engines on a given piece of track do the same thing or, DCCTRAIN offers ideas and information for DCC TRAINS. Digital Command Control where each engine can be ""dialed in"" in the controller and controlled separately. DCC is the new ""standard"" but a bit more expensive to get into.  Cost can be quite something. A ""good"" diesel engine can run you from $80-$250 easily depending if you want it to come equipped with DCC or sound, and ""good"" steam tends to be $150-$500. I put good in quotes because everyone has different standards. To start out I'd probably look for something that DCC ready that way you can choose which way to go later down the line. DCC ready means that it's DC but has a plug in it to accept a DCC chip if you want to convert easily.  Also google 'Modular layouts'. From you you've described I think that's a good way for you to go. Not only can it grow with you, but depending where you are there might be local clubs where you can join you modules into every now and then .  Pic up a couple model railroader magazines. They're great for ideas and to let you know what's going on in the hobby. They also have some cool layout building/track plan specials.  I'm going on an on so take that in and ask more questions!  edit: oh ya most ""train sets"" that come with track and equipment are normally pretty cheap. Also the track tends to be on plastic ballast which you're probably not going to want to keep on using if you're making a more realistic layout. That being said Walthers, Bachman and Athearn make pretty good starter sets."
modeltrains,2tnb96,metreman555,1 point,Sun Jan 25 23:06:10 2015 UTC,"Hey! Thanks!   I love the diesel electric CN freight trains you see a lot of in Toronto and Canada in general. I love North American trains mostly, have a soft spot for some of the older steam engines of NA, but I really love the SD70M-2's.   I'd probably design a bit of a mountainous landscape with a few bridges and stuff, but I'm not 100% sure exactly yet. It'd likely be somewhat realistic Canadian mountainous stuff.   I'm prepared to probably spend a few hundred just getting the engine and a few freight cars, and some track, but I'll be doing a lot of the scenery and stuff like that cheaply and over a long time. I'm gonna be putting a ton of detail into this set, and I can't wait to get started.   Any recommendations specifically? I'm planning on going to George's trains in Toronto, probably to take a good look and see all the stuff in person. I'll pick up a few magazines when I'm there! Good idea!  For now, I'll almost certainly be only using one train at a time. I doubt I'll be getting into DCC stuff for a while yet. Maybe after I've finished university and have a stable job."

I know I still have the Bachmann White Christmas steam engine new in its box but there might be one or two I am missing.  I have the Gravy Train engine as well as the boxcars and the caboose that goes with the set.   The center green switcher behind the Gandy Dancer is the locomotive for the GI Joe Electric Train and Battle Set.  I recently just acquired it from the local flea market.  It came with all the railcars and a lot of Joes/Cobras, the two Joe tanks, and one Joe jeep.  I always wanted it when I was a kid as well as the TRANSFORMERS Electric Train and Battle Set.  I hope to track down one of them at a good price in the future as well.  It would make an interesting set to have.  As you can tell, I really like the Sante Fe railway and their Warbonnet theme they use.  Most of all these locos run, except the two dummies.  A few of these are going to need some work done to them.  Most all of these have not ran in years.  I went to the local hobby shop earlier and picked up some lubricant so I can overhaul them all."

modeltrains,2thp8b,Cheeseburglar_9000,5,Sat Jan 24 07:00:43 2015 UTC,"This is all done with geodesic foam from Bragdon Enterprises.  Saw this guy demoing at a train show years ago, and was instantly sold.  It's not exactly the cheapest way to do scenery, but as you can see the results can look basically photo-realistic. He sells a starter kit that is supposed to do 16-32 square feet of material for about $150 (depending on how much of it you use for the shell and how much you use for the rocks specifically).  Highly, highly recommended if the price isn't an issue.  It is a tad messy though, but definitely tidier than plaster or hydrocal.  Even if you don't use the foam for the base, the molds should work with other materials as well, but I'd consult with his instructions before doing so.  I don't know that hydrocal would pick up the detail of the molds that he makes though.  So anyway, the way it works is it's a two-part process using a polyurethane plastic casting satin to form a shell on latex molds, and then pour an expanding foam over it to create a backing that is pliable at first but then solidifies to a hard shell frame, which then gets hot glued onto whatever surface you're using as a base shell for your mountains.  We're using the same foam because it's lightweight and can cover a huge area with a relatively small volume of the stuff.  We bought I think five or six different molds and this section was done using I believe only four of them, which range in size from about 8x14 inches to 2x3 feet.  Once the molds are glued to the shell in basically a patchwork, slightly overlapping way (which creates a very natural, erratic appearance to the rock, because you can cut them wherever you like and you can't tell where the seams are), then the gaps between each cast are filled with a paintable caulk sealant, and the whole thing gets primed with plain old white painters gesso.  Then for coloring, first step is to spread a very thin layer of powdered black tempera paint in the cracks, brush off any large deposits left over, then spray the whole thing with water to get the powder to stick.  Once it dries, then it gets painted with a wash of generic cheap acrylic paint that you can get at any craft store.  The idea is to be very conservative with the color and to do it in several layers and build it up.  I still haven't got that part down yet, because everything I've painted thus far ends up looking kind of homogeneous and washed out, but it's still pretty representative of what we're trying to model (Pacific Northwest).  This is all just following the directions provided with the foam stuff we bought from this guy, and he provides GREAT directions even without visuals.  It's pretty easy to do, but the measurements for the liquids takes a little bit of trial and error, and there's a fair amount of 'let it dry' time between each step."
modeltrains,2thp8b,Cheeseburglar_9000,1 point,Sat Jan 24 07:46:14 2015 UTC,"wow, foam. i never though of a spongy material. does it harden?"
modeltrains,2thp8b,Cheeseburglar_9000,1 point,Sat Jan 24 19:58:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah it hardens.  It's not really ""foam"" in that it's spongy though, it's a resin material similar to the 'foam in a spray can' stuff you can get at any hardware store.  It starts as a two part liquid, then expands and hardens when mixed.  When it's dried, it's quite strong and much less brittle than hydrocal or plaster.  But the foam is just used for backing for the rock forms, the detail is held by the polyurethane casting satin."

Seuthe is (or was, last time I checked) probably the most known manufacturer of model rail smoke generators. Guagemaster appears to sell a wide variety of them. There are other companies out there that sell them as well.  I suppose the trick, though, is powering it. Normally they're wired up to the motor of a locomotive. Perhaps wiring it up to a switch and a 9V battery or two would work, but I've never seen it done before.  I should point out, I've personally never used them. I think the majority of model railroaders (especially in the smaller scales) don't use them either. Smoke generators tend to leave a bit of residue all over (mitigated by regular cleaning), and they don't look all that realistic either.   Perhaps it works for your needs though.  Hope this helps!"

modeltrains,2t68ru,gdkitty,3,Wed Jan 21 14:35:16 2015 UTC,"From the image, you can see that the setup is a basic (although LARGE) loop.  There is ONE left turn Y, leading to a dead end.  Currently the train will run at full proper speed, across about 3/5 of the track just fine... but when it comes to the GREEN area, it slows down quite a bit.  On the bottom right corner, you can see that is where the power leads come from.. so I don't think its necessarily a too far away issue, its actually FAST in the further away parts.  Now, when I was putting the track down.. I started with the piece that is just to the LEFT of the power leads.. put the power in, then continued counter clockwise..  when testing at that point, BEFORE I had completed the loop (say only went to the top right corner) I don't remember it slowing down across the first laid down piece..  But now that the loop is completed.. there is the slow down.  So.. likely a voltage drop, right?  And then, somewhere along the front in the area where its green, is where its happening?  Sugestions?  Going to try first and make sure all the track connectors are tight/making contact.  Then try to remove 1+ sections along the front.. and see if by removing one, causes the slow down to stop?  UPDATE:  Changed about 4 of the conectors to newer ones.. Added a new lead just on the far side of the Y. Has got the speed up to about 80% of what it should be.  Still need to do some track cleaning (don't have any rubbing alcohol at the moment)  Hopefully the cleaning should get it a little closer.  Beyond that.. might mean a MAJOR take up of ALL the track, which I don't really want to do right now :P  The slow down.. actually co-insides of where it slows down in front of the 'station' building, etc.. so it actually fits :)  Thanks everyone for the help.  UPDATE 2:  Finally got a volt meter... though I am a little confused...  Train off the track, transformer on about 1/2 throttle, showing 7.8-8v (which is right).  No matter where you test on the track.. good or bad area.  Only when the train is going across the area where it slows down, you see about a .4v drop (likey was more of a drop before the other lead).  But you see that no matter where you test.. anywhere on the track."
modeltrains,2t68ru,myregnamewasused,2,Wed Jan 21 14:41:06 2015 UTC,"Voltage drop would most likely happen furthest  away from the power leads.  Dirty track could be a  factor, but I'd try disconnecting some track on the other side to make sure that there is a continuous loop.  If you have a multimeter you can also check when the power is disconnected that there is no connectivity between the two tracks.  I'd pay the most attention to the turnout, making sure that there's not a short between the points."
modeltrains,2t68ru,salamysamich,1 point,Wed Jan 21 15:04:16 2015 UTC,"Hmm. that is a good point.  And I guess if it was just a general voltage drop in that section.. putting the meter on while live, should show LOWER than say the section where it is moving fast)"
modeltrains,2t68ru,JustinMagill,2,Wed Jan 21 15:12:45 2015 UTC,"What scale is this? How long is the run? Generally, there should be power leads every 3 feet or 1 meter to keep a stable voltage through the rails."
modeltrains,2t68ru,jonathanrdt,1 point,Wed Jan 21 20:41:01 2015 UTC,"Its HO  I was unaware of the need for the extra leads..  The original set that came with it (mind you this was 30 some odd years ago) only has one set.. and that is for probably 2+ metres of track.  This is probably close to 4M.  Odd part is.. is that the voltage seems fine on the FARTHER away spots.. its closer to the one set of leads that the slowdown is happening.  I might pick up 1 extra set of leads on the way home, just incase.. to put in the bad area, worse case scenario... to see if there is an improvement. (adding them in, shouldn't INCREASE the voltage across the rest, right). I would just run both sets of leads into the same power output on the transformer?"
modeltrains,2t68ru,jonathanrdt,2,Wed Jan 21 20:46:42 2015 UTC,No it will not increase voltage of the track. It will merely help balance it. Hook it in parallel to your old leads on the transformer.
modeltrains,2t68ru,Yellow_Watermelon,1 point,Wed Jan 21 21:23:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  Picked up at least another set of leads, so at min will try adding another set in the area where the slow down is.  (As well as replacing some older connectors just in case)"

modeltrains,2t68ru,jonathanrdt,3,Wed Jan 21 15:00:42 2015 UTC,Even brand new track might be a little dirty. Wipe it down with some rubbing alcohol.
modeltrains,2t68ru,jonathanrdt,2,Wed Jan 21 15:15:22 2015 UTC,"Maybe that will be my first thing..  Check voltage across it, see if there is a drop with a volt meter.  Wipe it down & check / tighten any connectors along the slower part..  Then from there.. if still no go.. pop 1+ pieces out.. and see if its just one section causing it.. etc."
modeltrains,2t68ru,jonathanrdt,2,Wed Jan 21 15:36:58 2015 UTC,Yup. Clean clean clean. Dirty track is prevalent most times. Just some robbing alcohol and you'll be fine after that.

If they are not soldered together, then there can be a voltage drop across them, that may cause a slow down.  This can be verified by measuring the voltage at different parts of the track."

Try to work out how you want to use the layout, what sort of industries are involved, and then plan the layout around those."

For now, I really did not want to go too much into scenery and buildings and all that.  I mostly want lots of track with various sidings and such so I can display what all I want while still having a single full running loop around the room.  I also just want to use what I have right now.  A lot of the buildings I have are city and town buildings (general store, firehouse, apartment, etc) and not so much industry.

If the software had to build the layout in a designated area (say 4 x 8 feet), that would limit it.

Second, you have a single connection between the inner and outer loop - you're going to have to back the entire train up to switch loops, depending on direction of travel.  Neither of these are huge issues, just something you might end up being frustrated with down the road."
modeltrains,2svgm5,fotbr,1 point,Mon Jan 19 03:16:54 2015 UTC,"Tbh the track switch track is there more for scenery than anything.  I thought it would look cool by a grain/coal elevator.  I went into anyrail and fixed the problems with the curve, though."
modeltrains,2svgm5,SteveOSS1987,1 point,Tue Jan 20 02:12:05 2015 UTC,"Very basic tip from a newb who's still learning from mistakes: have your track at least a couple inches above wood (or whatever your base is) on foam. You can always dig down and add rivers and other terrain this way. I only did 1 inch on my n-scale, and I wish I could get some sections lower. Also, sculpt-a-mold has got to be the best plaster for rocks. Good luck!"

modeltrains,2su9pp,xboxkyle,1 point,Sun Jan 18 16:37:59 2015 UTC,"Theres a few videos on Youtube how to do it. You take off the shell, then carefully disassemble the drive shaft/worm gear mechanisim. Then you take apart the trucks and clean the gears and give them one tiny drop of light oil. Though with Athearns when they make that noise it could mean a broken/chipped gear as well unfortunately. Its happened to me before. Bought a used Athearn that ""just needed some cleaning."" Get it apart, clean it, found some damaged teeth. Motors pretty worn out. Essentially it was an over priced decoder. Someone ran the crap out of it. Between a couple missing handrails, the motor being worn out, the trucks having some missing teeth, a short I fixed in the wiring, and a continuity issue I couldnt seem to solve I took out the decoder and scrapped it."
modeltrains,2su9pp,Rayd8630,1 point,Sun Jan 18 18:27:12 2015 UTC,"I finally managed to get it apart, and all the gears are in good shape. What type of oil should I use? Is there anything special or would wd40 work just fine?"
modeltrains,2su9pp,capngrandan,1 point,Sun Jan 18 18:58:26 2015 UTC,Do not under any circumstance use wd40. It breaks down plastic. I use Labelle products and they work great. I've heard of people using ATF as well as hair clipper oil too.
modeltrains,2su9pp,Rayd8630,2,Sun Jan 18 21:46:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah Ive used Wahl trimmer oil in a pinch when I had something that was seriously bad. The Labelle oil the previous poster mentioned works is more of what you will need. You only need one tiny drop on the main gear that turns the other gears. Just enough to create some resistance to friction. The big thing to check is the Worm gear. It attaches to the drive shaft and drives the big cog in the trucks. It will have two tiny brass raceless bearings with washers. The grease that they put on the ends tends to solidify on those so clean that up and replace it with a tiny drop of oil. And I mean TINY. And clean the worm gear out thoroughly with a Q tip or a fine point foam paint/detailing brush. Even the tiniest spec of dirt in those can cause noticeable performance issues. Also clean around where the trucks pickup power from the wheels. This video describes it better:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYkzmwS-sYg  I will say if this doesnt fix your issue, do not feel so bad. A lot of modellers say that these Athearns have a ""usable life."" Not trying to discourage you, but when they start wearing out there is replacement parts if you are ambitious, but sometimes its cheaper to start new. If you Google things like Cleaning Athearn Locomotives, or Athearn Locomotive Loud Noise you will see that this is a problem that has been around for a while and has discouraged some people from the brand.   Its also something a lot of vendors at these Train Shows know. So they sit there and try and sell worn out engines telling you it just needs cleaning. One of the big reasons you have to be able to try before you buy or say goodbye. If a vendor wont let me try an engine, I walk.  You will also need this site as it is A HUGE HELP when you are undertaking this operation:  http://hoseeker.net/athearn.htm  Since you will have it torn apart one thing a lot of Athearn owners like to do is hardwire the pickup wire which greatly increases performance of these engines. You will need a soldering iron to do this so again, entirely up to you. But depending on how much you have spent, you could use this as a good learning experience for working on your engines. Best of luck. Let us know how it turns out."
modeltrains,2su9pp,cjcampo61,1 point,Mon Jan 19 00:44:02 2015 UTC,I've used good ol' 3 in 1 oil on my HO scale trains and my O gauge Lionel trains for years with good results.  According to the folks at 3 in 1 (now owned by WD40) it is totally plastic compatible.  I've never heard that WD40 breaks down plastic but anything is possible.  I've use WD40 also with no problems.  A small dab of light weight lithium grease like labelle's or lubriplate should be used on the gears.
modeltrains,2su9pp,kent_eh,1 point,Thu Feb 5 01:32:57 2015 UTC,Athearn sells (or used to) replacement gear kits.  There also used to be some aftermarket re-gear kits available from Walthers

Unfortunately, I'm not terribly well-versed in HO scale manufacturers (I do N and On30).  I know that Atlas is pretty good in N, and I'm pretty sure that's also true in the HO. Athern is respectable in HO, and their freight car kits are known as ""shake-the-box kits"" because you could practically assemble them simply by shaking the box. Walthers is also pretty good.

The ballast is definitely possible, but for putting ballast on top of the plastic ballast, it won't have a complete layer without going over the ties a good deal too, unless you use the finest ballast."
modeltrains,2ss4su,BadgerSixTwo,1 point,Sun Jan 18 01:00:43 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the hobby!  Can you separate the track you have now from it's plastic roadbed? If not, what I would do is start replacing the track you have with ""normal"" code 100 track and cork roadbed. if you can separate it you can just reuse your old track.  Just for reference ""Code 100"" is referencing the height of the rails. While not the most realistic size Code 100 is the cheapest and is most likely what the track you have now is, allowing you to connect to the rest of the track you have with out having a jump in track height. You'll have to build up to the same roadbed height though.  I would trace around the track that's down now so you have a reference point on where to nail down the new track and roadbed (the flex track idea you have is a good one)  As far as the ballast goes there are a number of different methods for addressing that. If you go the cork bed route you should buy some model train ballast then spread and glue it down. There are a bunch of how to videos about it. Watch a few and pick a method/look that you feel comfortable trying and like the look of.  Have fun!"

I actually never got to the ballast spreading stage on my layout (why I'm pointing to how-tos instead of trying to give advice on something I've not actually done) as I wanted to do the grass/sand first figuring that in real life the ballast would have fallen on top of the ""natural"" scenery."

modeltrains,2sdj7d,trainz64,1 point,Wed Jan 14 06:21:39 2015 UTC,Is it your locomotives or rolling stock or both?   So from what I gather your trains are derailing at the frog when the engine is taking the diverging route. There could be 2 issues at play here.    1) The flanges on the wheels are too shallow and are not guiding the cars through the turnout properly  2) The frog is molded improperly/defective and is not guiding the wheel through the turnout   Does this happen on multiple turnouts? Do you happen to know what number the turnout is? (could be too sharp for larger locomotives)
modeltrains,2sdj7d,Staphylococcus0,3,Wed Jan 14 09:29:39 2015 UTC,"Or one (or more) wheelsets is not adjusted to the proper gauge (width).  Or the width of the turnout is not right (spacing between rails, spacing between guardrail and rail, frog to stock rail...)  Turnouts can be a bit finicky, especially when you are starting out.  If you don't have one, get an NMRA standard  gague and learn how to use it. That will help you diagnose a lot of track and rolling stock issues."
modeltrains,2sdj7d,kent_eh,1 point,Wed Jan 14 14:54:55 2015 UTC,Do they make those for OO?  I think that's what scale OP is using.
modeltrains,2sdj7d,Staphylococcus0,1 point,Wed Jan 14 16:50:12 2015 UTC,I assume so.   They are available for the more common north american scales. I would expect someone maxes one for the common UK scales too.
modeltrains,2sdj7d,kent_eh,1 point,Wed Jan 14 18:23:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, it happens on most turnouts on the layout when I just run a car over them. They go through the first half of the turn ok, then either the first or last set of trucks pops off when going over.  This is the part: Right Hand: http://www.hornby.com/right-hand-point.html Left Hand: http://www.hornby.com/left-hand-point.html  This is the engine I'm trying to run over:  http://excaliburmotorsports.org/media/GP38-2_BNSF.jpg  It's a Life-Like (now owned by Walther's I think?) GP 38-2 in BNSF heritage scheme. It's fairly short and manages to make it around tight turns on the layout, but will still come off on these switches.  As for the rolling stock, they're all no longer than the loco as well."
modeltrains,2sdj7d,Staphylococcus0,1 point,Wed Jan 14 09:42:07 2015 UTC,Hmmm...  are there certain cars that can make it through the turnout or do all of them derail?
modeltrains,2sdj7d,Staphylococcus0,1 point,Wed Jan 14 09:54:19 2015 UTC,"Well, a fair few derail, but some do make it past. However they do make a clicky-click and do bump into the wrong spot at first, but then they move back to the correct lane."
modeltrains,2sdj7d,Staphylococcus0,1 point,Wed Jan 14 09:58:16 2015 UTC,That leads me to believe that the turnout isn't within guage/standards.  however your flanges could be too big and they are hitting the plastic at the base of the frog causing them to jump.

Plug in the power supply/command station, and then have a corresponding number of throttles to the number of trains you want to run at once. If you have a large layout, you will have to start thinking about ""power districts"" but that's only if you start taking over the basement.  True, most starter-sets don't come with DCC installed. You're better off buying the trains/tracks separately, and you'll get better quality in both as a result."

Personally, I like the modern era. A while back I did some research into the locos I already had, and aside from the one that didn't exist I have a GP35 which NS retired in 1988 and a Dash 9 that wasn't built until 1995 - I also have UP's Desert Victory that only existed in its camo paint scheme for a few months in 1991. So my approximate era is ""late 80s, early 90s."" I'm also taking some creative liberties with my backstory since it's assuming history happened a little differently.  I like your idea, and if you can make it work to a standard you're satisfied with then awesome :D"
modeltrains,2s7mo7,kellyzdude,8,Mon Jan 12 23:50:28 2015 UTC,"Personally, I like to model a specific (ish) era, and keep the things bolted down on my layout consistent.  This does not stop me from having a narrow gauge train passing the Jupiter (US standard gauge, built in 1868, scrapped in 1909) on my 1932 British standard gauge layout.  Do whatever makes you happy though! I personally avoid all references to animal farming on my layouts because I find it a bit too morbid, even if it's unusual to have a British goods station without a cattle dock."

However, I do have some later 50's early 60's stuff, plus a couple N&W black 1980's engines that I have a soft spot for cause that's what I grew up seeing.  My son collects modern day NS and W&LE equipment which when they show up on the layout (which is often) causes a giant tear in the fabric of space time in the basement.  But yeah its whatever makes you happy. When I get to the point I can host an operating session, the layout will temporarily narrow to a strict 1954 time period."

A possible solution could be that you're modeling Norfolk Southern's 21st Century steam program, or some heritage/tourist operation, alongside modern day NS Operations.

The idea is that it would be set in an alternative modern era in which we never got the internal combustion engine ""quite right"". The railways would be powered by steam engines (or EMUs for commuter services), and any cars or tractors would be either steam or electric powered. Other than that though, it would still be more-or-less the same as today, with people wearing modern clothing, talking on cell phones, maybe have some billboards advertising the newest steam-powered car...

EDIT 2: Above video is still cooking, give it a bit. Also the wobble is nothing to worry about, it's an effect that the rolling road causes somehow. Every steamer I've ran on it does this, including Kato's new FEF-3, and diesels can do it a bit as well. With such small drivers it's often impossible to get every axle supported and I think this uneven loading brings out the slightest of imperfections that otherwise go unnoticed."

You have two choices, you can install a decoder that will let you do lights, and then either swap it out or add a sound-only decoder later, or you can bite the bullet and go for a sound setup out of the gate. Of course, if you have multiple locos you can take a mixed approach and only give some sound to begin with.  TCS has some how-tos for several of the Bachmann Thomas-line locos, see their complete list (search the page for ""Thomas"")    http://www.tcsdcc.com/Customer_Content/Installation_Pictures/HO_Scale/HO_Search/search.html   For decoders; TCS makes the WOW Sound Steam decoder, Lokusound and Tsunami are also well known. On the more budget end there is Digitrax, and the really budget end is MRC, not recommended.  The challenge will be finding sound packs for the Thomas line.

From what I've seen and heard, most of the smaller Thomas locos don't have much room in them at all.

The class was designed for mainline passenger and freight use with more power than the D51 and a higher maximum speed than the C62 steam locomotive classes. This was achieved by installing two 1,100 hp engines in an 18 metre long centre-cab design, unusual for mainline operation. The V12 DML61 engines were developed from the 6-cylinder inline DMF31 engines used in the DD13 locomotives.

modeltrains,2rt1p6,Staphylococcus0,1 point,Fri Jan 9 05:19:33 2015 UTC,Definitely N scale
modeltrains,2rt1p6,MichaelArnold,2,Fri Jan 9 11:17:17 2015 UTC,Yup. 3x6 will allow for a very limited layout in HO. N scale would be the way to go as most of the time you can get more for your money. Engines are usually a bit cheaper and you can fit a lot more. Imagine this. You can fit a 6x12 HO layout on the 3x6 in N scale.
modeltrains,2rt1p6,Staphylococcus0,2,Fri Jan 9 12:52:28 2015 UTC,Eh not quite. 4'x8' scales the best to 3'x6'
modeltrains,2rt1p6,MichaelArnold,1 point,Fri Jan 9 14:22:15 2015 UTC,N scale is half the size of HO. So building an n scale layout on a 3x6 is roughly equivalent to building an HO layout on a 6x12.
modeltrains,2rt1p6,Staphylococcus0,1 point,Fri Jan 9 14:31:43 2015 UTC,Not exactly. Things get cramped at that size. My scaled down 3'x6' from a 4'x8' layout looks pretty good. (it would work well if I had built a better subbase) Granted I added a couple sidings to take  up a little more space but overall the curves and such scale well.   You have to remember that the radii get halved which can lead to some really tight curves even in N scale.

modeltrains,2rsde8,DustySpokes,2,Thu Jan 8 23:22:38 2015 UTC,"I can see how that can happen. I would say start small, and be ready to tear it down and redo it as your skill progresses. Most start with a 4x8 loop for ho or something of similar size for each scale and grow from there. Also look at real railroads and learn from them. You'll whittle down your likes from that."

modeltrains,2rsde8,MichaelArnold,3,Fri Jan 9 03:13:47 2015 UTC,"The starter sets are good for just that, Starting.   They are usually decent reliable locomotives but they lack on details and such.   Personally I wouldn't go too deep into locomotives and cars unless you are dead set on modeling a specific railroad at a specific time period. I'd get one or two engines that you like and then a few cheaper cars to pull behind them while you work on your  layout. (I don't recommend trying to run trains while working.)"
modeltrains,2rsde8,adventureBigBoy,3,Fri Jan 9 03:21:19 2015 UTC,"Yup. Buy some cheap stuff to get started. $40-$60 Bachmann locomotive with DCC on board, and a few pieces of low end Walthers or Bachmann rolling stock. Once you figure out exactly what railroad and industries you want to model then you can start investing in nicer stuff. I pinpointed my ear down to a early 2000s after BN and ATSF merged. So now I'm stockpiling locomotives and really decent quality rolling stock. http://i.imgur.com/umwrgdW.jpg"

However, try to stay away from the really old stuff that will just be a massive headache.  I would buy good quality rolling stock and engines they will last you a lot longer and you will use them more. For me personally the first loco I bought was a cheap one and I haven't ran it for years. But the first good quality loco I bought I still run today.  See if you can find Athearn ready to roll both new and used. They make some really nice rolling stock and engines that are in a good price range.   DCC is a really nice thing to have. I had the Zephyr and really enjoyed it. The new one has a new capacity of 22 engines active at a time! A Zephyr should last you a really long time especially If your doing a 4x8.  Well that's my two cents.  The best part about model railroading is the community it creates. Try to find a club or meet new modelers in your area. It is a massive help.  If you need help we're always here!"
modeltrains,2rsde8,PM_ME_YOUR_CHESTHAMS,2,Sat Jan 10 08:25:07 2015 UTC,I love these threads!  Firstly do you know what scale and size of layout you are interested in doing?
modeltrains,2rsde8,PM_ME_YOUR_CHESTHAMS,2,Thu Jan 8 22:43:57 2015 UTC,"I am going to go with the HO scale, which i gather is the most widely used scale.  My layout will not be huge but I want to run multiple loco's in the space so I am guessing there will be a pier set and some turnouts. Thinking of doing freight trains with some kind of yard setup.  For track thinking of going with EZ track (nickel silver with the roadbed).  My questions are more about the controllers. I am planning to invest in DCC but am confused which one to buy.  If I go with the Zephyr is it ok just to have the device with no extra boosters ? Will there be enough power for multiple loco's ? Do i need extra wiring or will the track be enough ?  Sorry if my questions sound dumb but if you guys can share your knowledge and how you started your first layouts that would help me a lot and save me from expensive mistakes.  Thanks"
modeltrains,2rsde8,Accidental_Alt,1 point,Thu Jan 8 23:32:45 2015 UTC,"I would highly recommend the NCE Powercab over the Zephyr, but they are both great units. If you're doing a massive layout you would need boosters but for something small you will be fine with the one unit. The other thing with the Zephyr is that you need to allow room on your layout for the controller. The Powercab is handheld and plugs in to the fascia panel, this saves you a lot of room, and you can multiple fascia panels on your layout.  When it comes to wiring, most of us run two bus wires under our layout and use feeder wires soldered to the track which are dropped though and attached to the bus wires below. I do this on every piece of track to eliminate any spots where I could lose power. I also solder my rail joints, but leave my turnouts unsoldered.  I'm still in the process of starting my first layout. I chose N scale and I am doing an 8x4 layout. First off I built the table. I then designed my track plan using AnyRail 5. I highly recommend you download it, watch the tutorials on their site and design your own. From there, I printed off my track plan 1:1, laid the pages on my foam and traced the track lines with a hobby knife, traced over that with a marker and started laying my track and trackbed.  EZ track is a good system, but I find it can be a bit limited in terms or radius, which is why I went for flex track. If I wasn't running the big American steam locos that I have I would have gone for the Kato Unitrack.  You're always going to make mistakes. And that's a good thing. It forces you to learn new and better ways of doing things. Hobbies are never cheap. The thing that I have learned is to join a forum and ask as many questions as you can. If you're unsure of something you can guarantee someone else has been in the same position.  Ask any specific questions you have and we will see if we can answer them!"

Your test rig looks great, but is RF interference going to be an issue once the antenna is stuffed into an N scale shell, 1/4"" away from a brushed DC motor? How about address space? Is the guy running a Lionel model of UP 844 on the O scale layout down the aisle going to interfere with my N scale 844?   I'm not trying to shoot down your concept here. It's just that there are a lot of factors to be taken into an account in order to turn it into a successful standard."

modeltrains,2rmsvd,MichaelArnold,1 point,Wed Jan 7 16:46:38 2015 UTC,"I did, I actually have just an RF version working too but there is something about the wifi that keeps pulling me back, the fact that I can open up a browser and go to http://192.168.1.32/speed/12 and have it work is great. Zigbee/XBee are expensive too. Cool tech though."
modeltrains,2rmsvd,metalgod,2,Wed Jan 7 16:51:00 2015 UTC,"True enough on the expense part.  When you mentioned wifi I assumed you were still using the low level AT commands (for some reason that's where my head went).

modeltrains,2rmsvd,kent_eh,1 point,Wed Jan 7 16:59:37 2015 UTC,Good idea. Any smartphone can become a throttle with no additional hardware.  The router can be used as security to keep random spectators off.
modeltrains,2rmsvd,metalgod,4,Thu Jan 8 01:41:27 2015 UTC,"More Details:  The video doesn't explain everything.  The train has a server running on it, a basic webserver. You then hit the ip with commands and it executes them. Currently it has speed control and basic lights so you open a browser and type in:  http://192.168.1.32/speed/12  or   http://192.168.1.32/speed/fast  and it adjust to that speed. Same for lights. There is also logic onboard to do certain things like not try to cross a turnout if the switch is wrong and I've played with the idea of asking for permission from ""dispatch"" to switch the turnout.  Also I should add that this works for signals, switches, lights etc. I have one wifi module that can control up to 64 switches, detect 16 blocks of track and control all of the led signals. Again, dirt cheap. That's still in the works but since the communication part is the hardest and that's solved the rest is just work."

modeltrains,2rmsvd,Glockshna,1 point,Wed Jan 7 16:36:30 2015 UTC,A bluetooth control for their trains if yours is actually WIFI though then it's an improvement because the first thing I thought was what happens when the train gets more than 6ft away or goes under staging or into a tunnel....  Bluetooth isn't as strong or long range as WIFI   They've only released it in a small set and seems very toyish right now   http://shop.bachmanntrains.com/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=258_966

modeltrains,2rmsvd,fhqvvhgads,1 point,Wed Jan 7 16:57:06 2015 UTC,"I beg to differ, but having a wifi connection does not automatically dictate you can control it through a browser.  Your software has created an interface between the wifi radio and your http stack.  There is no reason you couldn't do the same setup with bluetooth, infrared signals, or any other number of transmission techniques.  Any way you look at it, you're using a serial connection to collect a string of text, which you are feeding in to some sort of interpreter."
modeltrains,2rmsvd,boredinbiloxi,1 point,Thu Jan 8 14:18:06 2015 UTC,"The difference is wifi communicates using tcp by default, none of the other methods you mention do so you then need yet another layer to do that plus a way to connect to the network which would be wifi unless you want to do it with some emulation which would kind of defeat the point."
modeltrains,2rmsvd,CrazySpence,1 point,Thu Jan 8 14:49:08 2015 UTC,"I'm starting to think this may be the reason why the wifi chips are so expensive -- they have to provide another layer of communication.  The way I look at the project, you would have a central computer (maybe a raspberry pi?) that connects to all the devices (trains and controllers).  The controllers would operate signal lights, turnouts, and even car identification.  The train devices would simply run the locomotives.  Every device would report its information back to the central computer.  I think where we differ in approach is that if I wanted to control a locomotive from my cell phone, I would want to connect to the central computer (wifi, bluetooth, internet, etc), request that I be given command of that train, and the computer would then process the commands I send rather than taking the train through its pre-programmed route... but the computer would still block any commands that violate its basic rules, such as trying to run to trains into each other.  The computer still retains a degree of control over the trains and prevents multiple parties from trying to control the same train at the same time.  Does that make sense?"
modeltrains,2rmsvd,Shdwdrgn,1 point,Thu Jan 8 15:47:10 2015 UTC,"Heh, the sketch I have in my notebook from Monday of this week is that setup. A Pi (A+) controls everything and servers nice webpages using Python to access everything. Other boards (Signals, Detection, Turnouts) can be snapped on with a simple 5 pin cable which is an I2C bus. The Pi is running software to keeps things running and to update events (track is on block 2 what should I do, etc). The part I've been working out now is how to easily get that PI on the network and I think I'm going to take the same approach as the Chromecast does. It acts as an accesspoint when it's plugged in so you can connect to it at which point you see a setup screen to enter the password of your actual wifi router. Save, reboot and now the pi is on the network.    The only part that has to be wireless really is the train and you could use bluetooth or wifi or rf or leds it doesn't matter except what's the easiest. If you're comparing price IR would be the cheapest but probably give you the most issues and the others are all about the same price. It's a matter of how easy they are for me to prototype with, their size and how much I like the tech. I think BT is great for point to point so it would work but if I'm already on the networking why not just keep it that way with wifi? I'm getting new RF chips this week which I plan on trying, they're about $7 with all components and I would need one on the PI and one on each train. If that works it might be easier than wifi."
modeltrains,2rmsvd,Shdwdrgn,1 point,Thu Jan 8 16:02:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying there's anything wrong with the way you're setting it up, I'm just throwing out other ideas.  It would be really cool to start an opensource project that ties all these possibilities together so that anyone interested can pick and choose their components.  The software would be essentially the same no matter what, so if a set of standards could be agreed on then folks would have a great point to jump off from in building a system that suits their needs, budget, and component availability.  The real trick might be in a receiver that scales down for N or even Z.  A question about displays... I've been working with XTrkCad lately, and I wonder how hard it would be to add an API to show specific positions of trains?  This could make for a pretty powerful combination -- model your track, build the layout, then have a visual map of the running trains from the same program."

Ideally, larger curves are far more prototypical. Your locomotives and rolling stock will perform much better on them, as well as look more realistic.  In the end, the choice is yours to make. However, if you have the chance, get a copy of John Armstrong's Track Planning for Realistic Operation. From memory, he goes over the choice of scale and minimum radius."

If you look at current trends, Walthers cars ""run best on 24"" radius or greater"", or something like that, and cars that run on 22"" radius curves are fewer and farther between than they used to be.

I tried to pack as much stuff in my layout this first time, the only thing I couldn't manage was an elevation change, which in hindsight I probably could have."

modeltrains,2rht9s,vetlemakt,1 point,Tue Jan 6 07:40:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not familiar with Märklin trains, but 2 tips I'd offer for folks new to model trains are as follows:  1 - A little bit of maintenance goes a long way. Keep your locomotive gears and rolling stock axles lubricated. They will run better and roll more easily. Also keep your track clean. You may wish to pick up a book about getting started with model trains, they usually contain basic information about how to perform these tasks.  2 - Learn a little about track planning. Sometimes train sets will come with a few diagrams about interesting ways to set up your tracks, but take that a step further. Plenty of resources are available about how the real railroads set up sidings, freight yards, passenger stations and so on. When you understand how the real trains operate, you'll have more fun switching your miniature freight cars and serving your miniature trackside industries."

modeltrains,2red2i,rampage1991,1 point,Mon Jan 5 19:26:12 2015 UTC,"I'm torn! I model early BN with plenty of pre-merger stuff so I have a lot of the smaller diesels, but big steam is just so majestic. My excuse for the Yellowstone and my Challenger is that my fictional BN bought them for excursion service. :) I was originally going to model transition era C&O but unfortunately it's slim pickings for them in N. In contrast BN, CB&Q and GN gear (and to a lesser extent NP & SP&S) is far more available."
modeltrains,2red2i,fotbr,2,Mon Jan 5 22:43:18 2015 UTC,It's your little world and it plays by your rules.  My mid 90s BN world has a CB&Q Silver Streak Zephyr that they've kept in service because in my world (much like the real world in this part of the country) Amtrack doesn't exist (but really because I've got a soft-spot for the old E and F series locos and I like that set).
modeltrains,2red2i,capngrandan,2,Tue Jan 6 00:24:11 2015 UTC,"Am...trak...? Never heard of it!  The theme I'm going with for my layout (stalled at the baseboard stage unfortunately as I moved house and don't currently have room) is a fictional BN sub designated as being 'low budget/priority', hence it gets all the hand-me-down rolling stock and motive power that is yet to be repainted. My trains at the club usually end up being a bit of a rainbow. :)  As a fan of art deco I too have a soft spot for the EMD streamliners (my kingdom for a modern Pennsy T1 in N!!). I've got the E5s pictured above, a Great Northern F7 ABA set and a Northern Pacific FT ABBA set. I'll most likely end up with a few of the CB&Q F units that Kato is releasing in a few months too, wallet permitting!"
modeltrains,2red2i,Bartybum,3,Tue Jan 6 10:02:18 2015 UTC,"I love this train. IMO the Yellowstone is a bit of an underdog as generally when you talk about large steamers people think immediately of Challengers, Big Boys and Cab Forwards. I only recently found out that Bachmann made these last year and I just had to have one. Today it finally arrived!  My thoughts on this train are best summed up as follows- 'Who are you and what have you done with the real Bachma-...NO DON'T GET THEM!! You can stay.'  I already own one of Athearn's Challengers and in all honesty this Bachmann makes it look like a piece of crap. It's dead silent, it runs just as smooth as any of my TCS decoder-ified locos, and it performs brilliantly in general. Our club layout has a helix with a grade of about 1.2% and this loco pulled 39 hoppers up there without slipping. I'm so damn impressed I wish I'd bought more than one."

modeltrains,2rdfrl,dwwojcik,3,Mon Jan 5 12:19:19 2015 UTC,"I had the option of taking back my ho stuff from when I was a kid but I restarted in the summer with n scale. I just graduated and am definitely on a smaller budget, with room constraints so going n was a good decision.   I started looking for everything on eBay. I knew I wasn't going prototypical because the budget. I managed to get enough track to cover two layouts of 2x10 for around 100 bucks. I spent another 80 for ten switches. And here's a big question. Do you want to go dcc? I bought the zephyr and it was the best decision of my life. Of course now my locos would be a bit more but I have three now and I've spent 200 for those, all dcc. This was still all eBay. Once I got my track I worked out a layout and got some old rigid insulation from a friend. I ended up going with a 2x6 with a 2x4 L off the right side. I just put it on a makeshift shelf unit. Those plastic ones. I laid all my track learned how to do a bit of wiring including a wye.   Yesterday, I rebuilt my shelf and took all my wiring off. It was along side the track because I didn't really have a base. It now all runs through the foam and into the wood shelf. Since September I've collected things here and there when I have the opportunity. Usually all used/sale from the hobby store in town.   So long story short. It's really up to you. Your layout looks decent but it seems like you might have jumped the gun on scenery if all your trains keep derailing, only because now it's harder to fine tune your rails and connections. There's no reason for you to have to restart but what do you like doing? I really enjoy laying track and figuring out how I want everything. I added another siding to my layout yesterday. Hopefully you can find your passion and continue with the hobby!"

modeltrains,2r90fv,bach123479,8,Sat Jan 3 23:54:02 2015 UTC,Well you look at your prototype photos and then you look at the model and then you make them match...  The specific differences between a GP38 and a 38-2 are:  Dash 2s have a water sight glass on the engineers side of the long hood.  Fill that in.  The cab of a dash 2 will have angled overhangs on the back of the cab roof.  Cut these off flush with the cab back.  Dash 2 units were generally delivered with blomberg type M trucks with snubbers (shock absorbers) on one end of each axle and brake shoes on the inside of the wheels only.  Swap out the sideframes with blomberg Bs (no snubbers and 4 brake shoes per side).  On the rear of the long hood of dash 2s there is a blank circle for alternate positioning of the marker lights.  An xacto #17 blade makes quick work of that. Lastly the battery box covers (on the side of the front steps on the sides of the short hood) on dash 2s were bolted on and didn't have latches.  You can get the latched doors from cannon.  The paper air filter box behind the air intakes grilles was initially introduced on some GP38ACs and appears on all dash 2s and late standard 38s.  I believe they appeared in 1970. (Dash 2s were introduced in 1972)  Now this is where the prototype photos come in as many units rode on older trade in trucks.  Also during the life of the 38-2 the size of the radiator opening shortened up and well as a tightening of the space between the radiator fans.  Regular 38s all have the larger spacing.  This makes units like the older Athearn GP38-2s very hard to backdate convincingly since they have the smaller spacing.  You  would have to cut them out and replace them with Canon.  At least you have that option.  Good luck!

modeltrains,2r90fv,TheFue,1 point,Sun Jan 4 12:34:09 2015 UTC,There is also a difference in the distance between the centers of the radiator fans; on the -2 they are much closer together than on a 38.
modeltrains,2r90fv,dakotabranch,3,Thu Jan 8 21:01:12 2015 UTC,"/u/HalfVast gives many good points.  For late -2 models, you'll also need to backdate the radiator inlets.  The shudders were outside the carbody on later examples.  Inside on all the straight GP38 units.  But I gotta ask a broader question.  Why? What scale are you working in?    If HO, then why not just purchase the version you are in need of?  Atlas has produced an excellent GP38 in HO.  They did do undec versions, so you can find them occasionally floating around on Ebay.

Digitrax Zephr for your DCC, goto Southern Digital, they have a starter set with an extra throttle and 2 decoders for a little more than the list price of just the system.  Very easy set up, and if you get a set with a powerpack you can use that as an extra throttle."
modeltrains,2r3sft,brima,3,Fri Jan 2 18:11:02 2015 UTC,First things first. What scale do you want to model and sort of size layout are you looking at doing?
modeltrains,2r3sft,PM_ME_YOUR_CHESTHAMS,1 point,Fri Jan 2 15:15:43 2015 UTC,HO or N scale.  I have about 6.5 x 4 feet to work with.
modeltrains,2r3sft,PM_ME_YOUR_CHESTHAMS,6,Fri Jan 2 15:21:04 2015 UTC,"Probably N scale would be more suited to that size. The next step is to decide what make of track. Peco is really good for flex track and points, and Kato has amazing set track with trackbed already attached. I highly recommend downloading AnyRail 5 and watching the tutorials on their website and then designing what you want from there. If you decide on N scale join the nscale.net forums. We're always happy to answer questions or give advice!"
modeltrains,2r3sft,Hidiousclaw,4,Fri Jan 2 15:27:24 2015 UTC,I too would recommend n scale with a dcc system. I've only spent around half of your budget so far and have plenty of things to use. I'd recommend eBay for track and your first few trains. But that's just my opinion from a guy with a low budget.
modeltrains,2r3sft,Staphylococcus0,1 point,Fri Jan 2 16:27:51 2015 UTC,You can scale a 4'x8' HO plan to 3'x6' with a little tweaking pretty well.

modeltrains,2r3sft,garethashenden,5,Fri Jan 2 15:45:21 2015 UTC,"HO is roughly twice the size of N. If you have a model of a boxcar that is 40' long in real life, it will be 3"" in N and 6 in HO. HO give you more detail on the individual models where as N lets you model more of the landscape around the railroad. Have a look at the pictures in this thread to get an idea of what can be done in N."
modeltrains,2r3sft,Shdwdrgn,2,Fri Jan 2 16:32:17 2015 UTC,Or to put it another way... a full circle in HO takes about 36 inches.  In N it takes about 18 inches.  Add from there to make ovals and other more interesting shapes.
modeltrains,2r3sft,PM_ME_YOUR_CHESTHAMS,0,Sat Jan 3 22:44:32 2015 UTC,With N scale you will fit double the amount of track in the same space as you would with HO.
modeltrains,2r3sft,ottergoose,5,Fri Jan 2 22:51:23 2015 UTC,"I would suggest looking at N scale, and a standard called T-Trak. That'll give you a chance to build scenery out to completion in a small space to get technique down without committing to a larger space immediately.  If you use Kato Unitrack, you can quickly build a layout on a tabletop that will run well, then get the hang of scenery on a smaller module.  If you like the modular concept (it's nice for the layout to be portable, and also nice to be able to easily replace a portion of it, as inevitably happens if you stick with the hobby), you could build the whole layout with it.  In the event you don't like the hobby, resale value of equipment might be a concern. Unitrack holds its value fairly well, as do products from Kato, Atlas, MTL, and a few others. Generally the cheaper toy grade stuff (Bachman especially) is cheap to begin with and has less value to someone else should you ever try to sell it."

modeltrains,2r1jhy,Encryptid,7,Thu Jan 1 22:31:17 2015 UTC,DCC would make your life 9000x times easier
modeltrains,2r1jhy,trainz64,2,Thu Jan 1 23:00:33 2015 UTC,Please elaborate. I'm not familiar with DCC?
modeltrains,2r1jhy,Hidiousclaw,7,Thu Jan 1 23:17:42 2015 UTC,Dcc is a digital way of controlling your trains. Rather than powering the whole track section your trains are digitally controlled. Each has its own unique pin and the controller can choose which train to control. All that is required is one connection to your track (maybe more depending on length) and that the particular train is dcc equipped and you have a dcc throttle unit. You can have a bunch of trains this way all operating on the same track.   I'm just getting into it myself and its a thousand times easier than the analogue system. I'm sure someone will go into more detail than I have. :)
modeltrains,2r1jhy,PM_ME_YOUR_CHESTHAMS,1 point,Thu Jan 1 23:27:32 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, DCC is the only way to go these days. So much less confusion, easier to wire, much more fun."
modeltrains,2r1jhy,Hidiousclaw,1 point,Fri Jan 2 02:00:54 2015 UTC,Couldn't agree more!
modeltrains,2r1jhy,trainz64,1 point,Fri Jan 2 02:36:01 2015 UTC,"DCC is like the way of the future for model railroading. You use a single controller that powers the whole layout, and each loco is assigned a different ID Number that the controller responds to. You need locos that have a special DCC chip in them for them to be responsive to the controller, some locos will come DCC fitted (usually pretty expensive), others DCC ready with a plug to put a chip into (cheaper) and older DC and even analogues ones can be converted with some love and a lot of work. You can even control accessories from the controller, like motorised switches, lighting in buildings and other extras. It's really a great system that is a crap ton easier than DC and analog, but it can take some work to convert an existing layout into DCC."
modeltrains,2r1jhy,kellyzdude,2,Fri Jan 2 02:39:54 2015 UTC,"Short of DCC, you want multi-pole switches. Easiest is DPDT, or Double-Pole-Double-Throw. Attach Transformer A to the top section, Transformer B to the bottom section and then the middle goes out to the rails. Flip the switch up to use Transformer A, down to use B, middle to turn it off. My old club had something like 20-25 sections all split for top/bottom control in addition to the isolated yard sections, before they finally went for DCC.  Split the railroad into enough sections and you can easily run multiple transformers. All it takes is some imagination in wiring, and then clear labels and documentation so that the operators don't get too confused.  If you just want the ability to turn individual spurs/siding on/off, either a momentary on switch (hold the button to apply power) or a simple on/off switch (switch on, switch off) between the throttle and the rails would also be viable.  Ultimately, DCC will make your life several hundred times easier, though more expensive up front with the loco conversions that will likely be required, installing the decoders.  Wikipedia has a reasonable intro to what DCC is, and there are countless resources to learning more about the various DCC systems, pros, cons, options, ideas, out there as well."
modeltrains,2r1jhy,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Jan 1 23:58:33 2015 UTC,"Digital Command Control:       Digital Command Control (DCC) is a standard for a system to operate model railways digitally. When equipped with Digital Command Control, locomotives on the same electrical section of track can be independently controlled.  The DCC protocol is defined by the Digital Command Control Working group of the National Model Railroad Association (NMRA). The NMRA has trademarked the term DCC, so while the term Digital Command Control is sometimes used to describe any digital model railway control system, strictly speaking it refers to NMRA DCC.

modeltrains,2r0kb1,tacticalemu,3,Thu Jan 1 16:45:19 2015 UTC,A lot say it's for a sound thing. If the trains are directly on a foam or wood base they make much more noise. Mind you I've never not used cork roadbed so I don't know how much louder they really are. I started my n layout back in summer and I would recommend going to a flooring store. I don't think many people use cork underlay anymore but I was able to get a huge sheet of it for around 10 dollars. My cork is glued to my foam but my track is only pinned down to the cork. This will let me change the track if need be or I can take it off completely without too much hassle
modeltrains,2r0kb1,Hidiousclaw,1 point,Thu Jan 1 16:55:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input. What thickness should I be looking for then? I'm sure I could find cork sheets around me somewhere, but from a quick look at the Home Depot site, it seems to come in 1/4"" and 1/8"". Which would keep more to scale with N-scale? Also I'm guessing that after its on the cork, you then would put a more realistic ballast material over it and to mound up the sides more naturally. Or do you just have the bare cork."
modeltrains,2r0kb1,fotbr,1 point,Thu Jan 1 17:23:42 2015 UTC,"1/8 would be better, and yes, you would then ballast it in using the media of your choice.  I've been happy with woodland scenics ""fine ballast"" varieties, but there are many other options."
modeltrains,2r0kb1,Hidiousclaw,1 point,Thu Jan 1 17:29:30 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what thickness mine was. I haven't put my ballast on yet. But yes. I'm going to just put it over the cork and it'll look pretty natural. I'm not too worried about having it really prototypical. Here's a picture of what it would look like with the cork and ballast   http://www.trainboard.com/railimages/data/500/N_scale_test_track_1_.jpg
modeltrains,2r0kb1,dwwojcik,3,Thu Jan 1 19:22:53 2015 UTC,"In addition what what Hidiousclaw said, the roadbed (It doesn't have to be actual cork, there are artificial alternatives.  I'm not sure what's cheapest) is also for aesthetics.  Very rarely are real tracks laid directly on the ground- it's usually built on top of a mound of gravel for drainage and such.  You don't need it to run your trains but if you want a realistic appearance I'd recommend it."
modeltrains,2r0kb1,dwwojcik,1 point,Thu Jan 1 17:05:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input. I replied to Hidiousclaw and I would like to extend the same question to you then.

modeltrains,2r0kb1,reddRad,1 point,Thu Jan 1 17:24:57 2015 UTC,"Looking at N-scale specific products, 1/8"" seems to be the way to go.  You can get cork strips with beveled edges specifically for model railroading, but buying the sheet would probably be much more cost effective.  Once you've got it installed you would want to add realistic ballast, about up to the height of the top of the ties.  Edit:  Actually, I think it could go either way.  Choose whichever thickness you think would be best."
modeltrains,2r0kb1,PM_ME_YOUR_CHESTHAMS,1 point,Thu Jan 1 17:54:43 2015 UTC,"You have the two correct answers already:  looks and sound-reduction.  To your follow-up question, the height of the commercial n-scale cork roadbed is 1/8"" (I just measured mine).  The only problem is that the commercial stuff has a nice angled edge, which you'll have to cut yourself (cork isn't that easy to cut without tearing) or ignore.  Also a suggestion if you cut from a sheet:  Cork the width of the tracks will be somewhat difficult to bend to the curve of the track.  The commercial stuff has two side-by-side strips so they're narrower and bend easier.  Good luck."

Can you please go more into your process of how you got to where you are? I'm on quite a small budget. Did you buy all of your trees? Is there something particular you follow to get the look of your hills? You say it's all made of foam, but what did you use for a base?"
modeltrains,2qr7lf,Hidiousclaw,13,Tue Dec 30 04:56:20 2014 UTC,"I'll try to be organized, but I'll probably forget a lot so feel free to ask whatever you want.  The entire layout is solid pink styrofoam.  You buy 4' x 8' sheets of it at places like lowes..... My sheets were all 2"" thick, and I used 3 sheets total.  Every sheet was cut in half so they were 2' wide...... Perfect.  I then made my initial level for the track.  I used 2 full 2x8 sheets, and 2 1 foot sections to make the 2' by 9' layout.  At this point it was 4"" thick, and only had 1 very minor seam.  I was extremely critical about that seam because ALL of my track would be on this layer of styrofoam!!  There is no elevation change in my layout.  The seam was the only important joint.  Obviously this would have been easier if it was 8'...... As there would be no seam. I used styrofoam specific glue (it comes in tubes that are used with caching guns).  At that point I laid my track.  I was incredibly lucky to get the track I have, and will admit that it would cost a lot to recreate it (I'll elaborate later).  Knowing this, I laid my track in a different way.  I placed all of my track on the 2' x 9' rectangle, and played with it until I had exactly what I wanted.  There were no obstacles to work around, so it was incredibly easy to get a track plan that didn't force track to 'bend' where it shouldn't..... Once happy, I outlined where I wanted the ROADBED on the styrofoam using a sharpie.  Be VERY careful to not move ANY of the track.   Once finished, I moved all the track.  I bought double sided tape to make the actual roadbed.  The double sided tape was made by 3m, and comes in large spools from anywhere like OfficeMax.  I got mine 2cm (~0.75in) wide.  The tape itself is surprisingly thick.  It's on the order of 0.1 inches thick, and sort of a foamy/bendy consistency.  The tape is going to do a lot for us.  It will be used as the cork in your layout, it will be the outline of your road bed, it will hold your track in place, and it will hold your ballast in place along the rails   This is why the sharpie is so critical, because you can work wonders with double sides tape and an exacto knife!  My track is 100% covered.  I used as long of straight sections as I could, then just lined up several parallel rows of tape and carver out the corners!  Looking for that sharpie so you know your track will fit properly.  At this point you have a flat, 2' x 9' pink rectangle with a lot of double sided tape going around anywhere that there would be cork on a normal human beings layout..... Hopefully you're able to follow this.  So the next step is somewhat time dependent.  I placed large segments of track at 1 time.  To do this I took a segment of track, and placed it on the double sided tape where it should go.  (All of the tape should still have it's cover, by the way).  Using my exacto I cut the double sided tapes cover EXACTLY where both ends of the track segment were.  I then used Elmer's glue (not kidding) to create a 'bead' to the edge of my double sided tape.  I also use Elmer's glue to fill the areas between the two tracks.  There was always a good sized gap between the double rails, which makes the ballast look more sunken in.  So with all of your glue in place it's time to go.  The glue is workable for a long time, the double sided tape is not.  Peel off the cover from the double sided tape for your track segment.  This is why cutting the cover EXACTLY at the end is so important, you don't want to uncover any extra area!  (Unless you think you can do your whole layout in one shot).  Place the track quickly, but do a good job.  The tape grabs like you wouldn't believe. Sprinkle ballast EVERYWHERE!!!!  You want the ballast to get on that tape ASAP.  Push down if you can, just to make sure it gets everywhere.  When you're done you can vacuum the excess into a sock or something, but bare in mind the Elmer's takes a while to harden.  You can touch up the ballast as well if you like, but the tape is extremely adhesive.  Once that's done you're ready for the next track segment.  When I did this I left all of the power and switch connections above the ballast, clear from hards way. You will have to drill holes all the way through your layout later for those, so keep that in mind.  As a side note:  the reason I use this method is because the track can easily be salvaged (at the expense of the layout).  With Z scale I didn't feel like permanently gluing hundreds of dollars of track to a $5 piece of foam.  Trust me, this technique WORKS, and it works well.  The track is extremely strong, the ballast looks great, and I've pulled track to reuse it before.  Feel free to try a sample piece before you commit to your whole layout.  Keep in mind if you pull track, you are starting over.  There is no going back.  So no we have a flat 2' by 9' pink rectangle, 4"" thick, with ALL of the track laid and all of the ballast down, but the wires are all about ground.  It could be run though.....  So the next part is the lower hill.  The 4"" thick styrofoam needed to go downward and meet the water, so I got a Sheetrock knife.  If you google it, it's the really toothy looking thing.  Long, saw like blade.  I started carving at a downward angle.  I just randomly cut what I thought looked good.  I was extremely careful to leave more than I wanted.  Nothing was consistent, everything was random angles, the knife really chews up styrofoam.  You will make an extreme mess.  By the end of it I was literally using the knife to just grid away, there were no 'pieces' coming off, rather a constant snowfall of tiny pink flakes.  All of my sculpting was done this way.  Eventually I got it down to the raw hill beneath my forest.  I carved all of the hill on the outside of my track.  Even from an arial view I no longer have a rectangle, as there are chunks missing on that side.  So next I added a new layer of styrofoam.  This layer is on the bottom, and will again be a 2' x 9' rectangle.  This layer is the water in my layout.  So if you're following, we are still looking at a pink 2' x 9' rectangle, but the entire hill BELOW the track is carved, and at one point the hill breaches into a flat plane which will soon be out water.  Next I added the scene divider.  You guessed it, more styrofoam.   Mines about 1 foot tall, and it's slightly offset.  Either way, cut your tunnel portal out with the drywall knife and glue it down!  Brace it well and use a bunch if glue (you should always be using a bunch of glue).   There is no secret to the upper part of the hills, it's all guess and check.  I built mine up out of 4 layers of styrofoam (to the peak).  It's solid pink styrofoam.  I built the stack oversized and started carving away.  The tunnel is simply a gap in the styrofoam.  All of the pieces I used are big, I did not glue hundreds of pieces together.  The upper hills were maybe 10 large pieces of styrofoam total.  The end hill that wrapped the divider was a little tricky, but still is just large pieces.  Using the same technique with the drywall knife I started sculpting the upper hills trying to 'follow' the lower hills.  Granted there is an abrupt cut off where the track is 'carved' into the hill, but all that involves is holding the knife at a different angle.  Imagine the track is not there, and just guess where the hill would naturally be, then cut an abrupt edge where the track is.  I did not carve the hills on the layout.  The stacks of styrofoam were glued together, and fully hardened before I started carving, but they were NEVER glued down (to this day! You can if you want, it just make track cleaning easier for me).  I would place the hill on the layout, and eyeball what I wanted done, then remove the hill and do it.  It takes a while, but that's how I did it.  I did end up hot-gluing small pieces of styrofoam down to look like large boulders is random steep portions of the hill.  So at this point you have all your track laid, ballast down, hills carved, and scene divider up.  Next, drill the holes for your power, and switch connections through your ballast.  Feed the wires through, and use some Elmer's glue and ballast to hide the hole if you want to.  Don't glue the track down, just a cosmetic thing.  Wiring is going to be on you, as every layout is different.  Please look into how your track should be wire PRIOR to laying the track.  Some things can't be fixed.  At this point your layout is done, it's just missing color and plants.  I'm not going to lie, this is all typed on my phone.... So I'm going to go ahead and post this, then start another reply to myself."
modeltrains,2qr7lf,Hidiousclaw,8,Tue Dec 30 07:22:40 2014 UTC,"And we're back!  I'll start with the plants, because you can make them whenever you want, but you add them at the very end.  I copied this from a previous response:  The trees are all homemade. They start as large diameter pipe-cleaners I bought from Michaels (a large craft store chain near me). I bought black and white, honestly I can't tell you which started black or white anymore. There's a lot of paint. I randomly cut them to length, trimmed the 'trunks' down to the twisted wire and shaped the rest of the tree all with a scissors (made a cone on top, and ruffed up different areas). I lined them all up (trunks in the ground) and spray painted the hell out of them. Black and brown first, and I kept going until all the trees looked more or less the same. My dad has a lot of spray paint so I just kept doing different layers with random shades of black and brown. Then I sprayed several different greens, trying to get a good variety. I sprinkled green powder paint on them too, then painted over that. When I was happy with the look I started randomly placing them on the layout. They are just pierced into the styrofoam, but have never moved. I think they're small enough and there are so many that no one has ever bothered looking closely. They're not that well done, but I got about 300 trees for maybe $20. I'm approximating.  The bushes are just woodland scenic from a hobby shop.  I ripped them into appropriate sized pieces and threw them all in a shoebox to spray paint just so they didn't look uniform.  When the time comes you will hot-glue these to the ground.  But now for the paint:  Starting with the scene divider, I painted it white, then added a little blue (drops at a time) at the top, and worked it slightly down.  It's easy to add too much, and it's hard to keep the 'most blue' at the top.  Use very long, horizontal strokes.  I don't have a secret, but don't be upset if you get to redo it.  Or just avoid a scene divider?  The hills all started with the base 'rock gray' but it was a relatively light shade.  I put it everywhere there could be rocks, and then some.  You can do your whole layout if you want!  Most of it would get covered though.  I used a brownish green earth tone for the ground cover.  I sprinkled some woodland scenic green powder all over it as I went (while the paint's wet).  On the upper hills I painted the ground up to the 'abrupt' cutout for the track, leaving everything that should be stone still gray.  I went too far and later had to add more gray over the edges of the grass/ground cover. Each color should be fully dry before starting the next color.  The earth tone and grass is what butts up against the ballast, but you can do whatever you think looks good.  This is as much as I did with the earth tone.  Then I went back to all of the rocks (everything that was gray).  Using black paint and a small brush, I put the black paint ALL OVER the rocks.  Get it in every area, especially if it's deep!!  If I made a video you would think I was destroying them.  You almost can't see gray.  Almost immediately after I would dab up ALMOST ALL of the paint with a paper tower.  Don't get the black paint on anything but the gray paint.  You will remove most of the black paint with your paper towel, but what's left is going to look very deep/textured, even if it's not.  I intended on highlighting areas with white, but never had to.  You can continue adding black until your happy, and white if you want..... and gray if you want to try again.  Finally comes the water.  I got a very rich looking blue and put it all over the water area.  I completely coated it.  Then I added a small amount of black paint (we're talking drops) further out 'to sea.'  I brushed them in to make the paint fade to a slightly darker shade further from shore.  I then added some drops of white to create a slight wave affect.  When you're painting water your brush strokes should ALWAYS be in the direction the waves would come it.  I more or less just followed the shore.  So that's it for the paint.  There's no set order of operations, and it's really much easier than it looks.  Don't be afraid to just try something and then start over.  This worked for me, and I think it looks good.  With your scenery painted just stab the tree trunks in the ground (no glue required) and hot-glue your bushes down!  If you're like me you'll go overboard on this step!  I wrapped my layout with wood to protect the edges, but the layout is plenty strong on its own.  I should also mention track, as it's an important consideration.  I copied this from a previous comment:  Marklin has the best variety of track, without roadbed, and with lots of switching options. But it's spendy..... I got most of mine through a lucky find at a train show.....  Next comes micro-trains. They recently released eztrack (with plastic roadbed) and switches and whatnot. It works great, and for table top layouts it's perfect. BUT!!! They have always made, and continue to make flex track without roadbed!!! It's the best deal on track hand down, but they don't offer switches!? Wtf micro-trains!?  Next in line is Rokuhan. They also make eztrack (with the plastic roadbed) but I've never used or even seen it in person.  I may have left something out, but autocorrect has been fighting me for a long time and I don't feel like proof reading.  I'll look for pictures later."
modeltrains,2qr7lf,Hidiousclaw,4,Tue Dec 30 08:17:47 2014 UTC,Really good info and great tip about the double sided tape. I've been stalled in actually building my layout because I didn't quite know what to do for roadbed and you have just kick-started the season for me.
modeltrains,2qr7lf,Hidiousclaw,3,Tue Dec 30 10:10:43 2014 UTC,"I'm glad it could be of some use!  The tape is easy to work with, and I've always been happy knowing my track could be repurposed if need be.  I hope to see pictures of your layout someday!"
modeltrains,2qr7lf,translunar_injection,2,Tue Dec 30 10:34:29 2014 UTC,"Do you know which model of tape you used? Searching around the home stores doesn't yield what seems like it will work as well and it is absurdly expensive ($19 for 10ft).   Also, any pictures of the build process? I just went out and bought foam thanks to your inspiration."
modeltrains,2qr7lf,PM_ME_YOUR_CHESTHAMS,3,Fri Jan 2 20:39:35 2015 UTC,"Some of the construction.  Unfortunately those are ALL the pictures I have from the build.  Honestly never thought I'd need them, but I wish I had better pics at all of the stages.  The first pic in the album (with the control box) shows the track with ballast already on the layout BEFORE the lower hill was carved.    I've been looking into the foam tape online and unfortunately it is much harder to track down than I anticipated.  I paid much less than what you found.  My tape was made by 3M.  It is 0.75in wide (I previously said 20mm, which was wrong.  3M is American and only deals with inches), and 1/16in thick.  The 0.75in was just the right size so I didnt have to cut the tape on any of the straight sections of track.  They come in varying length spools, and mine was 36 meters long.  It's white tape, with a green pattern on the cover.  I'm about 90% sure this is the tape I used, in the 0.75in width.  The picture looks exactly like what I purchased, but 3M has a lot of different part numbers and a terrible website.....  I'm not home, and even if I was I doubt I could confirm the 3M part number.  My tape came from OfficeMax, so you should look at office supply stores near you as they might carry it or something similar.  I paid on the order of $30 (USD) for the 36 yards.  I hope this is of some help.  I recommend trying a sample of your specific tape and a single piece of track before destroying your layout based on my recommendation.  If there's anything else I can do just ask."
modeltrains,2qr7lf,PM_ME_YOUR_CHESTHAMS,2,Fri Jan 2 23:39:42 2015 UTC,"This was so thorough. Couldn't have been more impressed with your response.   On my layout I'm planning on having three removable sections. I'm a student and usually move once every two years. For the piece you glued on, the 1 x 2',  did you alternate your base layers or is it one straight cut through to the bottom? I'm starting to wire mine together and this is where I'm a bit stuck. I'm running dcc so that makes things easier. It seems like you said all of your wires run to the bottom of your base. Did you just staple them into the bottom? You said yours is portable yet surely they don't just dangle there?"
modeltrains,2qr7lf,Whoops_Mr_Moto_,3,Tue Dec 30 16:43:28 2014 UTC,"THANK YOU for the GOOoOOOLLLlLLLLLllLLD!!!!!  Never ever had that before, so this is really cool!  Unless it wasn't you?  The 1' x 2' pieces were alternated for strength, and when the final lower layer (water) was added the 1' x 2' segment was alternated again.  If the layout was 8' or less I wouldn't have needed to do anything.  Just a thought.....  On my layout the wires come all the way through to the bottom.  I then carved small canals through the pink styrofoam with an exacto to run all the wires to the same corner of the layout (where all the controls/transformers are).  Obviously I tried to make it look neat and organized, but no one has ever bothered to look at it.  With the wires in their canals I put a high quality duct tape over them to hide the canals and hold the wires in.  The intention was if I was desperate I could still access all my wiring.  At several times I've thought about adding an additionally lower layer to conceal all of this, but haven't seen a good enough reason to or not to.  I also could have done the canals prior to adding the water layer and then it would be concealed by that.... again, just a thought.  If you're using DCC you might want to just conceal all the wiring because there would never be a reason to change it.  As an indecisive DC guy I wasn't 100% confident I'd be happy, but I've never wanted to change anything.....  The bottom of the layout is completely smooth because of the tape, but I gave it 0.5 inch tall feet with felt bottoms so that it would slightly levitate over any surface it's on.  I also use folding saw horses to display it (the layout does NOT have built in legs).  In the overhead shot you can see a set of saw horses, but those are not the ones I use.  I found very modern looking, black, plastic sawhorses that are 2 feet wide!  If I'm dressing it up I can also drape a black cloth beneath the layout, over the sawhorses.  I should mention I had a table saw to cut the styrofoam, which helped to ensure both halves were the same width (2' minus half the saw blade!).    The layout itself was quite cheap to build.  The biggest expense was paint, both canned, and spray.  I used a lot of paint at every step of the project, and you will need a good variety of colors.  The track is extremely pricey, so keep that in mind.  If your budget doesn't allow for switches you can save a lot using the micro-trains flex track.  Rest assured the double sided tape will preserve your track, as it can be lifted off.  It's a delicate process, and cannot be reversed, but it's a great feeling to peel all of your expensive track off a cheap layout and it still looks brand new..... In a way you feel like your not spending as much on the layout because you know you can salvage the (by far) most expensive part!  The trains themselves are also spendy, but it kinda sounds like you've already crossed that bridge.  Good luck!  Feel free to ask whatever you want.  I don't think my techniques were perfect by any means, so don't take this as a concrete 'game plan.'  Everyone has their own secrets, but what I described resulted in the layout you see.  It was much simpler, and much easier than anyone expects.  I'm going to load some pics of the layout under construction.  As you build yours take pictures along the way.  This is the first time I regret not having the whole thing documented."
modeltrains,2qr7lf,boredinbiloxi,2,Tue Dec 30 18:17:22 2014 UTC,"Yes, I don't know what it does. But I hope it's as fantastic as people say.   Okay. That's what I figured you had done with the base. I only have a 2inch base of foam on mine and going thicker is definitely something that I want to do. Your whole mountain side comes off the base? I imagine that can take a lot of weight off when you go to move it. I'll definitely go with that approach. I bought cork from a flooring store for my roadbed. It was ten bucks for more than I'll ever use. Luckily for my track I bought it off eBay. I've spent maybe 150 on it. But if you looked at my posts (I'm on my phone or I'd link) I have enough to do double of my layout. My cork is glued down but my track is only pinned down. That'll make it easier to restart if I do. Because the track is used and not perfect I have to run more feeders to my track but that's the only negative I have found with it.  I really love your double track and wish I went that route. Also the divider is really smart. I like my layout but it's tough to make it look more realistic when you can see the overall loop the whole way. Really shows me why a lot of people have one side tunnelled around. If that makes sense. Any chance you can link to those pipe cleaners? I'm in British Columbia and Michael's is close by. Also I've used spray paint on foam before and it would eat away the foam. Is there a particular brand of spray you're using? I'm sure I have more questions. Being on my phone right now I can't reread your replys."
modeltrains,2qr7lf,PM_ME_YOUR_CHESTHAMS,2,Tue Dec 30 19:31:18 2014 UTC,"http://shop.hobbylobby.com/products/15mm-black-chenille-stems-124560/  These are the pipe cleaners.  By 'big' I was referring to the diameter, which is 15mm (A standard pipe cleaner is 6mm).  I could not find the right diameter on Michaels website, which is odd because I know I bought mine there..... They should be relatively easy to get??  I started with white and black, but the only way to tell which are which is by looking at the very bottom of the trunk that didn't get painted.  The lighter and darker trees are all determined by what shades of green you use.  This is why I randomly distributed them throughout the layout, and intentionally painted them in a random way.  I didn't want things to look too uniform.  I would recommend getting just black, and would still be afraid of vibrant colors, just as a precaution.  Something I should point out is even at 15mm the trees are pretty narrow for z scale.  I only recommend using these trees if you plan on have lots!  There's stength in numbers..... And once it starts filling out people don't notice the small stuff.  In one of my 'construction' pics you can see the hill with far fewer trees, and they look pretty meager.  But by the time I was done it looked like a relatively dense forest!  You have to commit to the forest look.  The trunks were on the order of 0.5 to 0.75 inches long, and I would say about 0.5 inches was pierced all the way into the foam.  They don't budge, and you can straighten them out if needed.    It's pretty easy to figure out how to shape it with a scissors.  I don't have any pictures of the process, but if you need help I could describe it.  The paint also helps make the branches look full/dense, as a lot of the fluffy stuff (on the pipe cleaners) will still together.    The trees themselves were about 3-4 inches on average, but there are several taller and shorter.  They can't be too tall or you will begin noticing how narrow they are!!!  When I painted them I lined them all up in a sacrificial piece of styrofoam.  They were all pretty close together (to not waste paint), and not very deep in the ground (to make sure plenty of exposed trunk was painted).  Yes the styrofoam will start melting away from the paint, yes some of the trees will fall over, yes you will have to rotate them is certain sides aren't getting good coverage, no I don't have a better alternative.  Once dry I started planting them on the layout!   I feel bad if I'm giving you too specific of advice.  Everything I'm describing is what I did, but that doesn't mean it's the best (or only) option!  I guessed how to do it..... There are probably better ways to make more realistic trees, but this was cheap, easy, and fast.  Hopefully you build whatever sort of layout you like, and if this is the sort of layout you like I hope these techniques work for you too!  If you need anything else just ask.  I hope to see some pictures as your layout progresses!"
modeltrains,2qr7lf,oklahoma_stig,2,Tue Dec 30 22:39:01 2014 UTC,Yeah. I was a bit iffy if that diameter would be sufficient for n scale which I'm modelling. I'll have to look into it. My dad use to make ones for HO. Taking real twigs and wrapped them in a green moss like that spider Web stuff used for Halloween. And they he'd spray it with hair spray and sprinkle some sort of green powder on it. But there's a reason he only made a few. Haha. Much more tedious.
modeltrains,2qr7lf,modelRRbenchworkCOM,2,Wed Dec 31 03:10:26 2014 UTC,"Haha, yeah my dads HO layout doesn't have nearly as many trees!  He has to get pretty imaginative.    It's possible there are larger pipe cleaners available that may look more 'N' appropriate, I just found the ones I had used.  Again, thanks for the gold!  It's cool someone appreciates the input!"
modeltrains,2qr7lf,modelRRbenchworkCOM,2,Wed Dec 31 06:02:57 2014 UTC,"Yeah. No problem. You've been unbelievable helpful. I think I found some pipe cleaners that are 1"" rather than a half.

modeltrains,2qr7lf,niko1499,1 point,Wed Dec 31 13:58:36 2014 UTC,"All of the mountains ABOVE the track are removable (everything touching the divider).  They come off as 3 pieces.  I never glued them down because I hate cleaning track and this makes it a breeze!  The weight is not a concern at all, but it's good to reduce the risk of damaging it.  Plus it's nice to just lift off my tunnel, just in case.  Spray paint for the trees ONLY!!!!!  Should have been more clear.  It takes a lot of spray paint to get the trees to look 'real' if you will, but that's the only place that spray paint was used on the layout.  I mentioned it because it takes a LOT (probably still more than you're expecting).  Several cans worth.  I probably used 6-8 cans of spray paint on the trees.  Overall the trees are still very cheap if done this way.  All of the styrofoam is painted with house/wall paint(?).  The ground and rocks were matte, the water was on the glossier side.  I took a lot of the paint from my dads collection, so I can't get too specific because I more or less used what I had.  My divider was chosen for that reason exactly.  I hate huge tunnels because it's a waste of track and make the layout too boring.... But I didn't want to see the track loop over itself.  My only other thought was to make scenery on both sides, similar to the one side of my layout, but rather than the scene divider I would have made the mountains even taller to work as a scene divider!  If done well I think this could look amazing.  The double track is really neat.  I know it's not as prototypically correct, but I would DEFINITELY do it again!  And I highly recommend the double sided tape.  It's a preference thing, but I'm very very happy with the result.  I live rock throwing distance from BC.  My michaels parking lot is flooded with Canadians going to Costco!  Hahaha.  I'll get a link to the pipe cleaners soon."
modeltrains,2qr7lf,Staphylococcus0,2,Tue Dec 30 20:16:58 2014 UTC,With close to the 300 tress you were saying. It doesn't surprise me that it took that much paint. Yeah I agree with your point about the tunnels. It's nice to use all of your track for viewing. Thanks for showing the other pictures you had. Looks good. I am leaning more to redoing my layout now. The one I'm particularly done was more for learning
modeltrains,2qr7lf,chokingonlego,2,Wed Dec 31 01:04:20 2014 UTC,"Some of the construction.  The pictures sort of clarify what's going on.  I have to admit there's a lot of back and forth when I do anything like this, so even though the divider is painted in some pics I may have still been modifying the hills.  Either way, these pics show some of the intermittent steps.  I wish I had taken more, and that my camera wasn't a potato.  The pic of the electrical box shows the track before I carved the lower hill..... I doubt you care about my wiring, but it's the only pic I had that shows it prior to any cutting.  Also, I guess I put the scene divider on sooner than I remembered?  Admittedly I built the layout a couple years ago.  Edit:  the pics at the end where it looks 'done' do not include my largest batch of trees.  I like the forested look, so once I had my technique down I made a lot of trees."

modeltrains,2qtibp,Bounty1Berry,1 point,Tue Dec 30 19:08:41 2014 UTC,"Hmm, thinking about something like this would be quite cool. As /u/brima mentioned, the British GWR transported a lot of coal, so a factory that relied on coal would be prototypical. I really like this idea, thanks so much!"
modeltrains,2qtibp,brima,3,Wed Dec 31 02:00:11 2014 UTC,"Great Western UK, or US? US Colorado or Illinois?  Seems like there's a lot of Great Western railways...  If US Colorado, this might be helpful.  Apparently sugar beets and refined sugar were king for them until the '70s.  No idea what beet based sugar refining or storage looks like, but it might be interesting (not something you see in every issue of Model Railroader, anyway).  Chicago Great Western was coming out of bankruptcy in the '30's, and bought a bunch of 2-10-4's for piggyback service in '39.  You could feed anything that fits on a truck to piggybacks.  Their passenger service was pretty famous throughout, so you wouldn't be far off to carry that traffic.  Looks like the GWR in the UK was primarily about passengers and coal, general goods in third place.  A mine or local coal dealer?  In the US a mine would be the center of the whole town, company housing, store, other suppliers, so there's a lot there.   Best thing might be to pick a town or towns your branch runs to from the main line, and find out what industries were there in the '30s.  Research is half the fun."

modeltrains,2qje44,MichaelArnold,2,Sat Dec 27 17:43:20 2014 UTC,"N scale is the next HO scale. With a lot of the baby boomers who primarily do HO scale starting to age, and since the younger generations grew up mainly seeing long intermodal trains with 6 axle diesels, I can see a day in the not so distant future when N scale dominates the industry. I mean in a 4x8 HO scale layout I could maybe have a road switcher shoving 4 or 5 cars along. In that same space in N scale I could have a couple SDs, ACe, GEVO's, or Dash 9's pulling long strings of autoracks, intermodal, or any other long modern style consist."
modeltrains,2qje44,Rayd8630,3,Sat Dec 27 22:50:45 2014 UTC,"Exactly why I chose this scale. I have very limited space so I can't run big six axle diesels in HO. I've been doing N for awhile now, but the amount of detail they're able to cram into such a small model still amazes me."
modeltrains,2qje44,MichaelArnold,3,Sat Dec 27 23:15:15 2014 UTC,I'm modeling long cars and big locomotives in HO. Lol. I like the size. More detail. When I move into a house the entire basement is going to be devoted to an HO empire.
modeltrains,2qje44,fotbr,2,Sun Dec 28 01:30:35 2014 UTC,"I know it's a small sample size, but here's a bit of anecdata about a local train show, held in the same venue in December of two consecutive years.  I'm ignoring the non-model-train-hardware vendors (ie, those selling food, books, t-shirts, ""engineer"" hats, buttons, coffee cups, etc) but I do include the display layouts.  December 2013, about 60% HO, 20% Lionel, 15% N, and 5% everything else.  December 2014, about 30% HO, 20% Lionel, 35% N, 10% Thomas & Friends, and 5% everything else.  It would appear that at least locally, N is growing, at the expense of HO.  The Lionel collector market is I think a bit different, being made up more of collectors.  Even the vendors that were there both years had significantly more N this year than they did last year.  The abundance of Thomas and Friends (in all scales) I think is another clue that the market is changing and vendors are trying to attract younger people to the hobby.  And by younger, I mean not just little kids, but college kids and twentysomethings that also watched thomas as a kid and still like it.  The club layouts were basically the same, but the clubs bringing N scale layouts expanded, while the HO clubs brought the same layout they've brought in the past, with maybe a module or two changed."
modeltrains,2qje44,Rayd8630,1 point,Sun Dec 28 00:21:51 2014 UTC,"I wouldnt say that those results are exclusive to your local area. Just look at this subreddit. I see more N posts than HO posts these days. O scale pops up every now and then and G scale to an even lesser extent. I think its mainly caused by an influx of younger people to the hobby. Which is good. 10 years ago the future of the hobby looked grim. When the Lionel Kids and baby boomers started to pass on it was predicted the industry would shrivel up. But now younger generations (X, Y, and onward) seem to be bringing it back. There was a bad social stigma attached to model railroading for a while. That it was just filled with lonely, creepy, old, and not trying to be racist, white men. Shows like Thomas and Friends helped spark an interest in trains into the younger generations as kids and now that these kids have grown up, have money from a career, they dont really care about stereotypes anymore because they are just ridiculous. So they indulge themselves in the hobby. Also, it would seem that people arent as afraid to admit they have ""geeky"" hobbies anymore. Even though in my opinion this hobby is as geeky as building a model car which almost every young boy (and some girls) did at one point or another Im sure.  And with the younger generations it seems N scale is the drug of choice. You can do more in less space. Space is getting harder and harder to get these days. Industry sees this and is rushing to meet the demand. I remember when the Walthers N and Z book was as thick as a periodical. Now its the same size as the HO Walthers book. To the same extent: N scale used to be confined to a corner of a hobby shop. Now it seems in most places it uses the equivalent amount of space as HO scale."
modeltrains,2qje44,fotbr,1 point,Sun Dec 28 01:32:26 2014 UTC,"Well, I've only been back in the hobby for a bit over a year now, so I don't have too much to go on, and only want to speak to what I've actually seen.  As a kid 20+ years ago, there seemed to be quite a bit1 of N scale stuff available (even though, looking back on it, quality was dubious), and while I was hesitant to get back into N scale, I'm glad I went with it.  Otherwise, yeah, never been afraid of geeky hobbies -- that's all I've ever really had -- have money, space and time for my hobbies (though never enough of the last), and I'm not really concerned about organizations that consist mainly of geriatric white dudes (other than congress, ha ha).  I'm fortunate in that there are two dedicated model-railroad stores in the immediate area, but both still have a very heavy emphasis on HO and larger, with N relegated to a very small corner in each of them.  Which is a shame, considering the amount I've spent online in the last year.2  If either of them are increasing their selection of N, it's not enough that it is noticeable yet.    Then there are two generic ""hobby"" stores in the area are focused on plastic models and RC cars/planes/helis/""drones"", with half an isle in each of them for model trains -- of which you might find a few pieces of Bachmann N ez-track, and if you're lucky, a car or two.  The rest of their railroad stuff is HO or Lionel, and one is staffed with people with bad attitudes and diarrhea of the mouth.3    Then you get to the Hobby Lobby & Michaels stores, with, if you're lucky, a single Bachmann N kit, and a couple HO kits.  They do tend to have a better selection of paints and airbrush supplies, and enough turnover in inventory to have ""fresh"" paints.  When it comes to clubs in the area, the larger clubs are all HO, while the smaller clubs are using N.  The difference really seems to be that the larger clubs have set themselves up to model a certain railroad or a specific time period, and all have adopted the NMRA two-through-track module standard.  The N clubs are fragmented around which module standard they've picked -- there's at least one T-Track club, and at least a four three-track NMRA/N-TRAK clubs that I know of, though at least two of them are church-based clubs that are not particularly accepting of those that don't regularly attend their services.  EDIT:  All that said, I do love some of the HO stuff I've seen, and I would have a G-scale loop running around my cube at the office if I thought for a second I could get away with it -- a removable bridge would make for a great cube ""door"".  1 Where ""quite a bit"" is defined as ""far more than my allowance, birthday or Christmas money would allow me to buy"".  2 While they were both willing to order stuff in for me, their pricing was ""take MSRP listed in the Walthers book, add 20%"" and ""it'll be on the next order I put in, which might be a month or two"".  3 They don't like you, don't want your money, and don't want you in their store.  All the online reviews of the place reflect that too.  Asking about them ordering something resulted in an answer of ""We don't fucking do that because people never buy the goddamned shit they order and then we're fucking stuck with it.""  I'm no stranger to cursing, and it doesn't really bother me, but when you're dealing with a customer, it's just not professional.  Needless to say, I won't be going back or referring anyone to that store."
modeltrains,2qje44,oklahoma_stig,1 point,Sun Dec 28 02:46:07 2014 UTC,"My local area (OKC) had more N at our local train show than last year. Also seemed to be more O scale and less HO. I started out in HO because I like the size, and i'm very clumsy and my hands are pretty big, so N scale just didn't appeal to me as much as HO did. That being said, I just got an N-Scale set from my grandpa who had it lying around for a few years. Set NIB never used. Not sure how i'm going to use it, but I may use it as a starting point in the future to experiment with N Scale. I doubt HO Scale will ever go out of style and we'll always have parts, but some local shops may start stocking more N scale (My local shop still is mostly HO)"
modeltrains,2qje44,milkymoocowmoo,0,Mon Dec 29 04:04:51 2014 UTC,"My club's clubroom has a HO layout that wraps around the edges of the hall, and the space in the middle is occupied by a U-shaped N layout.

I'm not sure since I just got started with Lego trains (don't see the fun unless you build the locomotives and rolling stock yourself) but most of the fun of a train layout is expanding it and improving on it. I don't really see the point of people who build a diorama or set up, inevitably expand, build a new set up, and repeat. I think we all relate to the ""scale it back"" and ""don't you have enough"" remarks as /u/Rayd8630 put it. Some people don't see the point of collecting."
modeltrains,2qjj1b,fotbr,3,Sun Dec 28 08:07:11 2014 UTC,"Instead of downvoting like others have (comment is at -1 as I post this), let me just say this:  Some people like watching trains go around in circles, on the floor, around the tree, or on a simple layout not concerned with being realistic.    Some like modeling scenery, towns, time periods, etc, and the trains are simply a part of that.    Some just like building models.    Some people like switching or shunting puzzles, and are content with some manual switches on a slab of plywood with no scenery at all.    Some like trying to be as realistic in their model railroad operations as possible, to the point of rail-car data-cards, fast clocks, and operating sessions with many people each controlling a specific piece of a layout.    Some like collecting, and have walls upon walls of display cabinets where they show off all their pristine models, but never run them.    Some like ""spaghetti bowl"" layouts with as much track as they can physically fit the space they have to play with.    Some want something they can train the iguana/guinea pig/cat/chihuahua to ride in/on.    Some like playing with actual steam engines in varying sizes.    Some enjoy going for a nice ride around their yard, or the giving rides at their club's park location.  Not everyone is into model trains for the same reasons you are.  None of them are ""beneath"" any of the others (although some may be under foot and prone to being stepped on), just different facets of the same hobby.    I don't see anyone putting down floor layouts, and proclaiming that ""all the fun"" is in one aspect, and that you ""don't see the point"" is a bit rude."

modeltrains,2qbh9u,miniclubbin,2,Thu Dec 25 02:50:49 2014 UTC,whats your track cleaning secret to running slow?
modeltrains,2qbh9u,105Hummel,2,Thu Dec 25 10:04:39 2014 UTC,"I use kneaded erasers.  They're always the gray, puddy-like erasers you can see millions on google. Artists need them for something, but I use them to clean track!   American Z Lines and Micro-Trains are both pretty good about flywheels.  My marklin steamers don't come out of the boxes anymore....  Edit: Just in case anyone was interested, the erasers are cheap so I combined about 4 of them.  They last forever.  To actually clean the track I work the eraser a bit just to soften it.  If you physically rip the eraser in half any stretched areas are typically very soft and tacky, so I just rip it and smash it back together.  Repeat.  There's not much technique after that, just run it along the track.  I typically keep folding the eraser over itself while cleaning.  If you've never used the erasers before imagine them being the consistency of clay, but it won't leave any residue.  I clean about 45 linear feet of track in 5 min, possibly longer if there's a noticeably bad spot."

modeltrains,2q91zj,mcphatmann,5,Wed Dec 24 05:17:56 2014 UTC,"Welcome to model railroading! Doing a layout is a brilliant idea. Hopefully I can help with your questions.   Should I start with a kit?    I'm going to say no. A kit is a good idea if you want to run your train in an oval. If you're going to do a layout you will most likely be using flex track as it's more cost effective, easy to use and you can design anything using it.   What type of rail should I use? Old brass is super cheap.    This all depends on your chosen scale, which in turn depends on your available size. Of course the bigger area you have the better. I would recommend using flex track. See above. But if you are doing N scale I would recommend the Kato Unitrack. It's a set piece option that has the track bed already installed.   Are there particular brands that are of higher quality that I should focus on?    Most of the big brands will be fine. Peco, Atlas, Kato, etc   I'm most interested in the diesel engines and European electrical locomotives, where should I be looking?    Again, depending on your scale. Dapol do some nice European locos.   Are there any definitive guide books to get started, or YouTube channel s?    Getting started is the probably the most difficult part. Once you've figured out your area and scale, you then have to look at what you want in a layout. Do you want a turntable? Do you want industries or country towns? Once you've got that part down you then need a track plan. I would highly recommend downloading and using AnyRail5 and watching the tutorials on their site on how to use the software.   Once your plan is done you will need to figure out your bench work. Check out the model railroader website for this, as they have a good guide. Watch as many videos as you can, and jump on forums and ask as many questions as you need.   My local shop specializes in O gauge, but that seems too big and expensive, I think HO is the way to go, but I need convincing.    I agree with this. HO is good. There's a lot more products available in HO than any other scale. N scale is great, it's half the size of HO so theoretically you can fit twice us much in the same amount of space.   What the hell is DCC and is it necessary?    DCC is Digital Command Control. Is it necessary? Well that depends on how many trains you want to run at once and a little more. If you go for DC you need to set up isolation blocks so you don't burn your locos out. With DCC each loco has it's own decoder with it's own address. You basically type in the address on your control and your able to move that train, switch to another address and bam, you can control that one too. Easy.  For me, DCC was a given. I like technology, and there's a lot of stuff coming out for DCC. Most of the HO locos are optioned for DCC or DC, turntables now have DCC etc.   I would highly recommend the NCE Powercab.   I hope this has helped."
modeltrains,2q91zj,PM_ME_YOUR_CHESTHAMS,5,Wed Dec 24 05:53:38 2014 UTC,"I'm assuming you're in the UK?   Kits are OK, but many times, you will get a better value if you purchase things piece by piece. For example, a kit will often include an oval of track with roadbed built into it. If you're jumping into building a model railroad, and not running your trains on your carpet, you will find conventional track easier to work with. Generally, brass has been replaced with nickel-steel. They also make steel rail, but it rusts rather quickly. I had brass on a previous railroad, and cleaning it was really frustrating. If you're building a very small railroad, cleaning brass won't be too bad, but personally, I say buy nickel-silver to save yourself the trouble.  I don't know much about European brands, sadly. I have a set from Roco, an Austrian manufacturer, which was OK.  Check for online retailers...they're usually cheaper than brick-and-mortar stores. Plus you don't have to deal with the socially-oblivious hardcore modeler types who often staff those places.  Model Railroader, an American magazine publishes a number of books on how to get started building a model railroad. I'm sure there are youtube channels out there too.  You are correct, O gauge is big and expensive. HO has the benefit of smaller size, and lower cost. It is also the #1 scale worldwide in terms of models produced for that gauge, meaning you'll have the widest range of locomotives, rolling stock, buildings, etc... in HO. DCC - Digital Command Control - computer signals are transmitted through the rails. Each locomotive (and some accessories like switches) will have a microprocessor which interprets these signals to adjust speed, as well as operate sound/smoke/etc... Each locomotive has its own unique address, and because of the onboard computers, multiple trains can be operated on one single circuit of track.    Before DCC, layouts had to be wired into isolated ""blocks"" to allow for multiple train operations on the same line. It was complicated and a pain in the ass.   Is DCC necessary? Strictly speaking no, although if you do want to operate multiple trains, operate trains with onboard sound, or have access to a variety of hand-held and wireless controllers, then DCC is well worth the investment."

If that was the only issue, I suppose the only thing I might want to do is get some replacement wires to connect things with... again, I'm no expert, but I assume it's a tad unsafe if the insulation is melting/burning off... any idea what type of wire I should look to buy at Home Depot (or a hobby store)?"
modeltrains,2q6qiz,zOSguru,2,Tue Dec 23 17:53:31 2014 UTC,The wiring without insulation can cause issues if it comes in contact with another bare wire or conductive surface.  I'd suggest a hobby store though any thin gauge wire will work provided it fits in the track lock-on.    Good luck!
modeltrains,2q6qiz,zOSguru,1 point,Tue Dec 23 18:03:45 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the notes on the wires!  I just tried re-wiring things to the transformer the way you described… And l had some success! The engine's light turned on and I had no smoking or bubbling wires. However the train would not move, or not very much. If I nudged it it would maybe continue a few centimeters further… But it would always stop.  So I assuming now that the main issue lies within the engine.  Possibly it just needs to be cleaned and lubricated... However, the hobby stores near by either are closed or don't service trains…. Is doing repair/maintenance work like this by myself possible/a good idea?  I'd hate to ruin the thing, but I have some limited experience in building/repairing a 3d printer...

modeltrains,2q1j7g,st4tik,1 point,Tue Dec 23 01:33:03 2014 UTC,"Well my entire track setup is now DCC, and I can't run DC without eventually ruining something because of the current and voltage differences. I already have a DCC Great Northern A unit, and wanted to add a B unit. This was my solution. Saves money on buying a new DCC B unit. There was no change to the ""look"" of it, it was a functionality problem. With this particular unit, unless the motor is turning the wheels basically do not roll. If you hook it up to a locomotive, it just gets pulled along with the wheels locked in place. The drive shafts need to turn the main drive gears, which in turn drive the three gears linked to the axles. There's a lot of mechanical motion going on there. With the gears removed, the wheels roll freely. To remove the gears, I had to remove the motor. To remove the motor I had to clip the wires anyway.

modeltrains,2q16dt,goldfishgraveyard,4,Mon Dec 22 03:14:00 2014 UTC,"It looks like you put the lockon wrong. It should look like this. http://i.imgur.com/VRnwqYW.jpg One wire for the center rail, the other for one of the outer rail."
modeltrains,2q16dt,quazax,2,Mon Dec 22 06:25:25 2014 UTC,"I didn't notice this, but you're correct, the lock-on is definitely installed incorrectly in the photo. The clip on the end opposite the terminals attaches to the center rail."
modeltrains,2q16dt,ottergoose,1 point,Mon Dec 22 13:18:55 2014 UTC,I think this and my dirty tracks were the problem. I swear that I tried every different combination I could think of to put the lockon to the tracks correctly previously but combined with dirty tracks I reverted to my incorrect way.
modeltrains,2q16dt,roj2323,3,Mon Dec 22 14:24:59 2014 UTC,"one wire goes to the middle track, the other goes to the outside track."

modeltrains,2q16dt,roj2323,2,Mon Dec 22 05:47:36 2014 UTC,thicker wire would help with amp capacity but for that he's doing it should be fine.

modeltrains,2q16dt,bball975,2,Mon Dec 22 14:27:27 2014 UTC,"Clean the track with a rag and cheap rubbing / isopropyl alcohol, or automatic transmission fluid, if you happen to have either around; even if it looks clean, if it's a used set, it's almost certainly dirty.  If you'd like rule the track out completely, hold the locomotive upside down (perhaps in your lap), apply some power to the transformer, and touch one of the wires to one of the large wheels, and the other to one of the electrical pickups between the wheels (the part that would contact the center rail of the track).  If you test the output of the transformer with your voltmeter, keep in mind that the output is AC, not DC."
modeltrains,2q16dt,quazax,1 point,Mon Dec 22 05:02:34 2014 UTC,Is one better than the other? I think I have both trans fluid and alcohol around. I'll try applying power directly to the engine.

modeltrains,2q16dt,ottergoose,2,Mon Dec 22 05:46:43 2014 UTC,Don't use Q tips. The lint rubs off and gets in the gears and motor. Any lint free cloth with isopropyl alcohol works perfectly. I use a cotton handkerchief.
modeltrains,2q16dt,Trainfanz,2,Mon Dec 22 06:52:35 2014 UTC,"I've been using it lightly on the wheels themselves to ensure good contact because I work in HO (so a handkerchief really just doesn't get in there), but I don't know how well it works for O.

Rio Grande and the Pittsbugh and West Virginia were technically owned as part of the same system a few years before 1909, but they didn't operate in the same sense as a BNSF or UP does today, they were all individual railroads and kept separate equipment. Pittsburgh and West Virginia and the Virginian never had a direct connection to each other either.   Though that's all largely irrelevant to your question as a connection wasn't needed for cars to be found on a different railroad. You'd probably have been able to find a Virginian boxcar or flatcar on the D&RGW occasionally as part of normal operations, though not on the narrow gauge sections. Hoppers would have been more rare for reasons that are too long winded to explain at the moment, though if you want to run them go for it anyways or you could try to repaint them.   Other industries you might find near logging would be paper mills, tanneries, anything that makes wood into a finished product (furniture, door knobs, thread spools, etc.), sometimes large chemical plants that use pulp to make synthetic fibers, though 1909 is probably too early for those.  There are a few places to go on the internet, [American Rails] (www.american-rails.com) is good for basic maps and short histories, just be warned it's riddled with ads and popups. Most railroad history is , however, still in actual hard copy book form. I'd recommend perusing Amazon or eBay and finding a few books on the Rio Grande or Colorado railroads or a general book on modeling logging or mountain railroads. Western railroads aren't really my area so I can't give any specific recommendations."

modeltrains,2psm8y,roj2323,4,Fri Dec 19 17:16:53 2014 UTC,Kato makes excellent products. I use Unitrack all the time for T-Trak modules.
modeltrains,2psm8y,Jeff_Faust,1 point,Fri Dec 19 21:26:36 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I think of Kato Unitrack as a waste of money unless you're doing a temporary setup or using a standard that requires it. It's great track, but if you're just going to be nailing it down and burying it, you're really spending more than you should.  Atlas has track that is pretty much the standard which is much cheaper, however its a little bit more difficult and fiddly to lay. Basically, if the track has built-in roadbed, its ideal for something you'll be assembling and disassembling frequently, but it will cost more.  So its up to you if you want to pay a little extra to remove some work. I have operated on a very large layout that was 100% Unitrack, and it worked quite well. The owner did have to modify a few pieces to get everything to fit perfectly, but it was a really crazy setup where he would have had to modify the track regardless of the type of track.  I am curious, though, why aren't you looking at a starter set? Generally those sell for less than the cost of all of the components combined, and the equipment is carefully-chosen to give the best experience for a new-comer (meaning its decent quality, but not too pricey.)"
modeltrains,2psm8y,Trainguyrom,1 point,Sat Dec 20 05:15:40 2014 UTC,Just a small warning when it comes to Unitrack. If you constantly are setting up and tearing down those joiners will become lose and may need replacing or tweaking after a while.

The reason I have not looked at the starter sets was because I read that you can get better quality if you buy piece by piece.  Again, I know nothing about this hobby.  So I have no idea if that is true.  Also, I do not really have a dedicated space.  So it might be setup and torn down a few times."

I've had some pretty nasty build up on some of my engines at times, which often results in lots of sparking and inconsistent movement on the track.

The pickups seem to be blackened a bit... but the alcohol didn't take much of it off. Anything abrasive will introduce metal dust, but is there something else I can try that might do the job?"
modeltrains,2pqwws,wpnw,1 point,Fri Dec 19 03:59:40 2014 UTC,"The pickups are usually the biggest problem spot in these kinds of situations.  If you can't clean it well with a q-tip. then use something else that will give you a bit of bite on the surface of the roller (obviously no steel wool or anything metal).  Fingernails work pretty well to get the crust off, I've found, and then clean it up a second or third time with alcohol or lighter fluid.  The contacts aren't fragile at all, and you may need to use some elbow grease to get them cleaned.  Simply running the engine isn't necessarily going to help the situation, because it could just pick up more gunk.  You'll want to periodically clean the pickups and track (primarily the center rail) too, depending on how often you run it."

modeltrains,2ponge,MichaelArnold,6,Thu Dec 18 15:06:41 2014 UTC,heh - years ago on a large N-scale modular layout I managed to get a 100 car train running. It was ~36ft long (one whole side of the layout) and needed a helper engine in the middle.  It was also grouchy as hell and would frequently derail but it did make a few successful laps.
modeltrains,2ponge,boomhaeur,1 point,Thu Dec 18 15:49:02 2014 UTC,"we used to do this on the club layout too. Mid train helper, and usually a pusher.   Then we got fancy and started using whistle signals (via the soundtrax in the lead unit) to signal speed changed to the operators.   Then, usually, this happened"
modeltrains,2ponge,kent_eh,3,Mon Dec 22 03:48:41 2014 UTC,"It wouldn't be too hard really, you'd just need a huge layout, huge funds and excellent track."
modeltrains,2popua,openwheelr,2,Thu Dec 18 14:46:54 2014 UTC,"Sounds like your old track might be dirty, or depending on the age and material, corroded."
modeltrains,2popua,fotbr,1 point,Thu Dec 18 14:50:30 2014 UTC,"Well I've cleaned the track and took some very fine-grit sandpaper to it as well. Maybe the connectors are a little corroded. If I'm going to pull track up, might as well replace it as I go."
modeltrains,2popua,webculb,2,Thu Dec 18 15:05:36 2014 UTC,Probably the best idea. The new built in roadbed track is much better about this.
modeltrains,2popua,quazax,2,Thu Dec 18 15:27:51 2014 UTC,"Fine grit sandpaper and abrasives in general causes long term damage to n scale track. It causes pitting which is impossible to clean after track gets into it.   As for your question, all the different tracks with built-in roadbed are incompatible between brands. The highest quality and most expensive brand is Kato."
modeltrains,2popua,Trainguyrom,2,Sat Dec 20 01:49:27 2014 UTC,"Sandpaper isn't good for tracks, as has been said before. Your best bet for cleaning would be what's known as a ""bright boy"" like this: http://www.modeltrainstuff.com/Walthers-Bright-Boy-p/949-521.htm  To use it, just run it along the tops of the rails like you would sandpaper. Unlike sandpaper, it won't damage the rails, and it will last you several years before it gets completely worn down.  As for the new locomotive not running on the older track, that's odd. It is pretty much unheard of for a model railroad manufacturer to purposely make their trains incompatible, with the exception of couplers, but even then, there are only two types you should ever run into in N, and both of those are quite common and easy to replace.  I'm thinking the problem is that the old track is dirty/damaged or something in the wiring is faulty. It's generally good practice to have more than one engine, and getting a halfway-decent backup engine is pretty inexpensive and easy in N. I'd recommend getting an Atlas or Kato engine as a backup, since those brands are quite reliable.  As for replacing the track, you should be fine with Atlas, since their tracks are pretty much the standard. It sounds like you aren't terribly concerned about realism, so I highly recommend you avoid ""code 55"" tracks. When you see ""code 55"" or ""code 80"" or anything like that, it refers to the size of the rail. Code 55 is much closer to scale than the standard 80, but the rails are too small for many wheelsets. Code 80 is the standard in N, and probably what you have now, so stick with that.  One side note: in HO scale, Code 100 is common on cheap track, and I believe 83 is the smaller, more realistic size. I work in N and On30, so I'm not very well versed in the HO scale nuances."

modeltrains,2pi8p4,Timtad,7,Wed Dec 17 12:40:42 2014 UTC,"If they made it in the USA the supply would be fine, but it would cost twice as much."
modeltrains,2pi8p4,webculb,3,Wed Dec 17 15:05:49 2014 UTC,"Maybe. But when they (Atlas, Athearn) sent manuf overseas, the price didn't change at all.We, the consumer, didn't see any of the savings. And delivery time turned to crap. Besides, I'd rather pay more to employ Americans in American factories. Micro Engineering, for example, makes a superior turnout and track, doesn't change 2x as much, and manages to make them in the USA."
modeltrains,2pi8p4,SD70MACMAN,3,Wed Dec 17 18:41:04 2014 UTC,"I agree with you on employing Americans. However, by manufacturing overseas Atlas can make the track at the same price point and keep the difference as profit. This helps keep them in business longer. It doesn't make any sense, from a business perspective, to manufacture in the US anymore."
modeltrains,2pi8p4,webculb,3,Wed Dec 17 18:58:32 2014 UTC,"actually employing americans generates market for products.  Manufactures don't create demand and jobs; consumers with money in their pocket's create demand, which results in jobs."
modeltrains,2pi8p4,Timtad,2,Wed Dec 17 22:07:38 2014 UTC,"I agree with you. However, Atlas is going to do what is best for their company. Just like every other company out there. It's the cycle that is turning the US into a 3rd world country. Bit by bit."
modeltrains,2pi8p4,webculb,2,Wed Dec 17 22:26:15 2014 UTC,"How much extra profit are they pocketing while there's no track to be sold?  How much of that extra has now been eaten up by all the retooling, setting up new lines, building new relationships with new manufacturers, etc?  How many of their track customers have gone elsewhere because shipping date after shipping date passed with no track to show?  I waited for two years for any sign of C55 flex and turnouts.  I eventually decided there just wasn't any way I was starting a medium-sized layout based on the track and turnouts I had and what few I could find.  I didn't want to bet that supplies would come back by the time I burned through my stock.  So I went with ME and handlaid turnouts.  ME because they make a great product here in the US, and handlaid because I needed more sizes than ME's #6s.  ME isn't that much more expensive.  Don't take this the wrong way.  I love Atlas - they make good products, and I have several friends who work for them.  What they've done for the model railroad hobby is immeasurable.  My entire motive power fleet (8 GP38-2s and 7 SD60Ms) is Atlas because they look and run great.  I wish them the best and hope their track supply comes back, but I'm solidly in the ""I'll believe it when it's back in stock somewhere"" category."

I've seen many shops fail for other very good reasons - bad service, surly opinionated owners, poor selection, completely uncompetitive prices, etc.  While I was in college, the local shop went under because the owner was obnoxious and opinionated, had everything marked way up, and couldn't figure out why his sales kept dropping.  Simple - we'd rather drive 50 miles to a better shop than deal with him!

Not to pass the buck but if you Google ""Lionel 736"" you'll find out information about your engine (like this stuff) and you can do that for the cars too. There's a ton of information out there.  To answer your other questions:   It's O gauge.  I'm not an appraiser and the value will depend on the quality and if it works. The engine alone is probably worth a minimum of $100+ and the cars can be worth just as much. For a lot of these things the sentimental value is more than the actual value.  If it runs then yes, you can use it.  For probably closer to $300 you can get a Polar Express starter set that'll run on the same track as your stuff."

modeltrains,2pe5pi,changetip,1 point,Tue Dec 16 02:13:54 2014 UTC,This was my dads toy train when he was a kid in the 1950s.   We also have track and buildings.  The track is metal with three bars across.   We also have a transformer.  The tiny trains are from the 80s and I think we're N scale.  The large ones are the ones I'm most curious about.  What scale is it?   What's it worth?  Can we still use it?  I want my son to get one for Christmas the same size.  So this is why I need to know what size this is.  What do you recommend in the $200 range?  Thanks!!!
modeltrains,2pe5pi,JennyCherry18,5,Mon Dec 15 20:31:54 2014 UTC,"Here's some listings on eBay for your 736 Berkshire, that'll give you a decent idea of what people would pay for one. Looks like around 150 is average.   Your pieces are from Lionel's ""Postwar"" era (which is basically anything from 1945 to about 1969 I believe). They're considered some of the most desirable.  The train is in ""O"" Scale. Sometimes you'll see them as ""Standard O"" and 0-27. These use the same track size and everything, only that 0-27 is more toy sized and Standard O will be closer to true scale. You can mix and match if you like but the difference will be very apparent.  Can you still use it? Absolutely! Most of these trains require a little maintenance but will run fine. The motor in this locomotive is a Pullmor motor, an open brushless motor. It will require a few drops of lubricant to keep it running (easy to do). Here's a video detailing the motor  Lionel still makes sets, any of these will come with track and a power supply and will this train just fine and be 100% compatible.  EDIT: Forgot to mention that these trains are highly servicable. I've taken ones with years of neglect and restored them quite easily. If you find it doesn't work then take it to a service center hobby shop in your area. Repairs are usually very reasonable and it'll work for years after that with just basic care."

modeltrains,2pd39l,bach123479,4,Mon Dec 15 15:00:27 2014 UTC,What sound decoders are you using in your locos? As far as I know the only brand you can program with custom sound projects are Digitrax sound decoders. If you're just trying to adjust volumes you just have to program the CVs. The manual that came with your sound decoder should tell you which CVs you'll need to program.
modeltrains,2pd39l,capngrandan,2,Mon Dec 15 15:59:27 2014 UTC,"I haven't bought the sound decoders yet, but the digitrax ones were what I was planning on getting. This is my first sound project, so I didn't know if I had to manually pick the sounds I wanted and associate them with a specific engine. This makes things so much better!"
modeltrains,2pd39l,capngrandan,3,Mon Dec 15 16:06:41 2014 UTC,"I recently bought a Digitrax PR3XTRA USB interface and I have put some of the John McMasters sound projects in both my Big Boy as well as my Spectrum 2-8-0 and the custom sound projects are leaps and bounds better than the ones that come with the decoder. I believe that JMRI works on Mac computers as well. If you have the PR3XTRA you can use JMRI or Digitrax' SoundLoader software to put those sound projects on the decoders. You can also program CVs that way as well. The SDXH166D sound decoder does come with a 8 sound projects (6 diesel, 2 steam) and they aren't terrible but they are 8-bit and you'd want 16-bit sound on a 16-bit sound decoder. The SDH166D is 8-bit and comes with a steam and a diesel. I have both and if you have it in your budget I recommend spending the extra $20 or so and getting the better 16-bit one as it will be much better in the long-run.   If you do go that route though, I'd recommend getting the Digitrax Zephyr DCC system. That way you can hook your throttle up to the PR3XTRA as well and you can then run your trains through a computer as well being able program CVs and sound projects. You can still program the sound decoder irregardless of which DCC system you chose but if you want to run the trains with the PR3XTRA you'll want to go with a Digitrax DCC system.  NCE does also make a USB interface with which you can run your trains/program CVs through your computer with JMRI but you won't be able to load custom sound projects onto Digitrax sound decoders with it. The PR3XTRA is proprietary for that."
modeltrains,2pd39l,capngrandan,2,Mon Dec 15 16:26:26 2014 UTC,"Say I'm stuck with the Powercab. What is my best option for a sound decoder, digitrax or other? I really have no idea which direction to head."
modeltrains,2pd39l,everylittlebitcounts,3,Mon Dec 15 17:16:22 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure what your budget is, but mine was semi-tight so I went with the sound decoders I could afford so I stuck with Digitrax.   There are a ton of different brands out there, the best being SoundTraxx Tsunami, ESU LokSound and TCS WowSound. They truly produce amazing sound, but it also comes at a higher price tag (~$100 each w/out speaker). If I had the money I'd go with them but I'm content with my Digitrax ones (~$60 includes speaker) because of my ability to load custom sounds.   I can't recommend the Powercab enough, it's a great DCC system and as said you can use the PR3XTRA to program CVs and Digitrax sound decoder sounds. Ultimately it's up to you but I love my Powercab."
modeltrains,2pbk5x,bball975,2,Mon Dec 15 02:48:00 2014 UTC,"Is it a gouge in the plastic, or jsut some paint chipped off?  Many modellers like Squadron green putty for filling gaps and scratches.  Use it just like doing full-size bodywork on your car (only with smaller tools)  Then a thin coat of paint, blended in with some weathering, and you're good to go."
modeltrains,2paqe3,OrangeL,5,Sun Dec 14 22:13:33 2014 UTC,Love my powercab. So easy to use.
modeltrains,2paqe3,marauder3058,3,Mon Dec 15 03:51:48 2014 UTC,"I went with Digitrax (but not the Zephyr) for my stuff.  Friends went with the Zephyr, and from the little bit that I've messed with it getting them up and running, it's a nice little unit.  The NCE Powercab has a good rep, so I don't think you can go wrong either way.  As for cleaning cars -- have you tried plain old warm/hot soapy water?  I know the temptation is to go for the miracle cure, but sometimes soapy water really is the easiest answer."
modeltrains,2paqe3,fotbr,2,Sun Dec 14 23:06:09 2014 UTC,"Honestly I haven't touched them. They smell really badly due to the wax. If I could boil down ""old people smell"" into one scent, this would be it.  I also inherited the layout (also covered in said smell/wax) and water/soap on it didn't help. Sandblasting was suggested but impractical- ended up discarding the whole thing."
modeltrains,2paqe3,Jeff_Faust,3,Mon Dec 15 04:33:20 2014 UTC,"If it's wax, give mineral spirits a try. It should take it off without damaging paint or plastic.   And, PowerCab."
modeltrains,2paqe3,ZebracakeDietPlan,2,Mon Dec 15 01:34:16 2014 UTC,"I'll give that a shot, thanks."
modeltrains,2paqe3,capngrandan,3,Mon Dec 15 04:33:48 2014 UTC,"With the NCE Powercab I felt I could hand the controller to my wife, younger son or non-model railroader visitor and they could get a train running and blowing the horn with very little assistance."
modeltrains,2paqe3,Pkwlsn,3,Mon Dec 15 02:17:15 2014 UTC,"Here's another thing to consider in regards to the NCE PowerCab. I bought a Powercab about a year and half ago and I love it but recently I picked up the Digitrax PR3XTRA USB interface and along with using JMRI I can program my trains with my laptop. I would have to get the NCE USB interface to run them though. The main reason I bought the PR3XTRA is because I can load sound projects onto my Digitrax sound decoders. The ones that come with the decoders (SDXH166D) aren't that great but there's a guy named John McMasters who has made dozens of 16-bit custom sound projects and he does a great job with them. I recently loaded one into my Spectrum 2-8-0 that he modeled after a Southern 2-8-0 and it sounds fantastic now.   If you get the Digitrax DCC system you'd be able to run your trains along with it as well in JMRI if you get the PR3XTRA. If you don't intend on using Digitrax sound decoders though, I'd go with the NCE PowerCab and its' USB interface."
modeltrains,2paqe3,capngrandan,2,Mon Dec 15 14:44:29 2014 UTC,Will the NCE powercab not run Digitrax sound decoders?
modeltrains,2paqe3,capngrandan,2,Mon Dec 15 19:11:24 2014 UTC,It will. Any DCC system that is to NMRA standards will. I have a Powercab and my Digitrax sound decoders work great!
modeltrains,2paqe3,Hidiousclaw,2,Mon Dec 15 19:25:29 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the tip, forgot about sound programming. I don't see myself using a USB interface in the near future.  If I read your post correctly, you bought a digitrax usb interface to program sound, but those trains still run on all DCC brands. So why would I need the NCE usb adapter? Is it not just a decoder programmer?"
modeltrains,2paqe3,BusRider,1 point,Tue Dec 16 19:41:58 2014 UTC,The only reason you would want the NCE usb adapter is if you want to actually run and control your trains with a computer rather than the Powercab handheld. It is also nice to be able to program your CVs using a computer interface rather than doing it on the handheld.
modeltrains,2paqe3,BusRider,2,Tue Dec 16 22:18:43 2014 UTC,"I bought a zephyr back in August to get back into the hobby. Love everything to do with it. I was completely new at dcc and for the price I thought it was reasonable. Using it for n scale on a 6x7 layout L shape. I thought about the power cab but it's easier for me to run multiple throttles with the zephyr. I think I can have three total, all controlling different trains through the zephyr."

modeltrains,2p8wwk,reddRad,4,Sun Dec 14 15:56:12 2014 UTC,"Model railroad control has barely changed in the last 100 years.  If the term ""DCC"" means nothing to you, there's no problem at all, you're likely running basic DC power. DC voltage is applied to the rails, positive feed to one side and negative to the other, the locomotive picks up the power and the motor turns. To change direction, change the polarity and the motor turns the other way. There are exceptions (mostly in European or O scale where it was fed with AC and required a special signal through the rail to tell the locomotive to reverse -- I doubt this will be a problem for you).  Judging by your post this next bit is irrelevant, but I have been wrong before and it may help someone else:  The problems will come if you have DCC. Analog locomotives can be run, but it's not ideal and shouldn't be used for long periods of time. They certainly shouldn't just sit on the DCC layout for any length of time. If you plan on running these on a DCC layout, you'll need to consult with a DCC expert on if it is possible and, if so, how to install decoders in these units safely."

modeltrains,2p73oo,dwwojcik,6,Sat Dec 13 20:11:16 2014 UTC,"My initial plan was to put gravel (size ""quarter minus"") down and lay the track on that.  Before I went through the effort and expense, I just laid the track out on dirt to try it out for a while.  Unfortunately, life got in the way, and I didn't spend enough time getting nice smooth grades and such, and the trains didn't run that great.  Then I bought a steam engine at a train show that completely failed to handle any grade at all when I got home, so I ended up being pretty depressed about the prospects of this railroad.  And thus it sits, and why you see it the way it is today.  Essentially, it is abandoned.  For now, at least.  I still have hope for the future.  I agree concrete would be best, but that's a real commitment to a design.  I didn't feel like I had the optimal track plan just yet."

Is it rare now, or common?   Your best bet is to translate the Russian and see what this set goes for on Russian eBay. Maybe nothing, maybe a lot.   Your second question:is it interesting?

I'll list a few of my favorites:  www.thisamericanlife.org/podcast a popular NPR show that shares the stories of people around the country  www.npr.org/programs/wait-wait-dont-tell-me/ Wait Wait is a hilarious news quiz off of NPR. The panelists are all comedians, so it gets funny fast.  www.serialpodcast.org/about Serial is a spinoff from This American Life, and each season is a single story. The first season, which is just wrapping up is an investigation of a 1999 murder where a young man was convicted for murdering his ex-girlfriend, but there is good reason to believe he is innocent.  www.twit.tv/ TWiT is a small company that produces a number of computer and technology podcasts. I personally listen to Tech New Today, Tech News 2Night and TWiT (This Week in Tech) These particular podcasts tend to be very general and entertaining. Some of their more special-interest shows like FLOSS Weekly and Security Now tend to require much more in-depth knowledge to understand.  www.theskepticsguide.org/ The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe is a weekly science podcast which has a special focus on debunking and condemning pseudosciences like Astrology, Homeopathy, Psychics, Acupuncture, etc. The hosts of the show are doctors and scientists, and promote critical thinking and proper science education. Because culture and religion play a major roll in ""junk science"" I don't recommend listening to it if you are strongly religious or believe conspiracy theories/pseudosciences. This podcast doesn't require much in the way of scientific knowledge to follow and enjoy. Occasionally they delve into trying to explain how things happen/work at a molecular level, or an outer-space phenomenon, which can be hard to follow, but you don't really have to fully-understand it to enjoy the show."

modeltrains,2p3qu3,webculb,2,Fri Dec 12 21:11:03 2014 UTC,"The corral manual shows how to hook it up to the older style tracks, not FasTrack.  The manual suggests a converter track that converts from FasTrack to older style, but that solution still has it using an older style track in front of the corral.  The operating track explains how it works and what the buttons do, but not how to hook up something like the horse corral."
modeltrains,2p3qu3,webculb,1 point,Fri Dec 12 21:18:25 2014 UTC,That might be your best bet if the attach points are built for the older style track. Get 2 fastrack to old style track converters and a piece or two of old style track to put in front of the corral.
modeltrains,2p3qu3,quazax,1 point,Fri Dec 12 22:20:09 2014 UTC,It could be the corral you got is the old one and the one you linked is a new one designed for fastrack. They should update that manual.

modeltrains,2ovmo2,ReadyPlayerJuan,2,Wed Dec 10 22:52:12 2014 UTC,"As others have said - Atlas C55 has been out of stock pretty much everywhere for years due to their Chinese supplier going under.  Sectional finally started showing up a couple months ago, and now the #5 turnouts are trickling in, but there's no sign of the flex, #7, or #10 turnouts yet.    Micro Engineering also makes some fine code 55 track flex, and it's actually C55 rail so it's easily compatible with Atlas sectional and the like.  Plus, if your prototype is North American, ME is much closer appearance-wise."
modeltrains,2ovmo2,Quasi_Evil,1 point,Thu Dec 11 07:00:57 2014 UTC,"It's the lack of turnouts that have stymied me.  I managed to score a bunch of Atlas Code 55 flex and started on bench work, but the turnouts dried up and it's been idle ever since."
modeltrains,2ovmo2,ReadyPlayerJuan,2,Sat Dec 13 17:00:57 2014 UTC,"ME's turnouts aren't bad, but you're stuck with #6.  I switched over to building my own when I started really getting serious about getting the layout built last year.  It takes a bit of practice, but when you get done the turnouts look spectacular and work well.  You can get all manner of jigs that make the task easier from the FastTracks guys:  http://www.handlaidtrack.com/  Personally I've got a #7 right now for yard turnouts (as that's where I'm starting on the layout), and I'm probably going to pick up a #9 or #10 jig for my mainline turnouts in the next month or two."

modeltrains,2orx1o,biffster,6,Tue Dec 9 18:01:36 2014 UTC,"If you're running 3 engines on one powerpack, it can pull a pretty good amount of power. Are you running them together or on seperate tracks? if they're on seperate tracks, you'll want to look into some more complex wiring  www.nmra.org/beginner/wiring  Also, when I exibet at train shows with the N-Trak group, we frequently get comments about 30+ foot long trains pulled by ~3 powered locomotives, so its worth pointing out that these model engines can pull a lot on their own. Typically, if you want multiple engines on one train, you should have 1 powered engine and the rest dummies.  One other possibility comes to mind. If you have multiple powered engines on one train, and they haven't been calibrated to run in sync, they'll all be fighting each other since model trains seldom have two engines run at the exact same speed without somewhat complex calibration. One might be pulling the slower one, or maybe pushing the faster one, and in the end, they end up going slower than either one on their own."
modeltrains,2orx1o,Trainguyrom,2,Tue Dec 9 20:14:31 2014 UTC,"It depends.  Are you using all 3 on a single loop of track. Or separate loops? Separate lives can be isolated using insulated joiners. That will allow you to use another small power pack. However, if you're using all three and one you're going to need a larger power packed with higher and ratings. I recommended a MRC tech II. They don't have to be new, and they have all sorts of cool features like momentum and breaking that you can use. You can usually find them on ebay for a good price."

modeltrains,2on9jh,afterdescription,4,Mon Dec 8 13:57:16 2014 UTC,"The Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway would have run directly through Racine on the line to Chicago starting in the early 1870s when they laid track/bought smaller railroads.  The Milwaukee Lake Shore & Western ran through Racine until 1893 when it was bought by the Chicago and North Western Railway.  The Minneapolis, St. Paul & Sault St. Marie Railroad ran through Racine as well starting in the 1880s.  S.C. Johnson & Sons started there, so in the 1890s they would have been receiving pulpwood and sending out flooring. Malted milk was invented here so there would have been box cars and tank cars of products going in and out. It's close enough to Milwaukee and had enough German immigrants to assume that there was some beer production here (to a lesser extent than in Milwaukee proper). Although the largest eastern WI meat processing areas were in Green Bay and Cudahy, Racine probably had some meat industry as well. Before the 1900s, Racine would have had some commercial fishing companies as well, none at a grand scale, but enough to sustain a fish factory or two by the old port.  It still looks unfinished, but here's the local historical society's website. www.racineheritagemuseum.org  Laser cut kits of flat cars, gondolas, and stock cars for a decent price and unlettered. http://www.rslaserkits.com/N-RollingStock.html  Micro Trains did special runs of 36' meat packers and brewery reefers. Back then, the companies owned the cars and would advertise on the side along with their company's location. If I recall, many were in cities around Chicago, Green Bay, and Milwaukee, as well as southern Wisconsin. They would be seen in Racine depending on the location of the buyer. http://www.micro-trains.com/special_edition_Brewery.php http://www.micro-trains.com/special_edition_MeatPackers.php  Micro Trains also does 36' cars (common length of freight cars then) mostly boxcars and stock cars but they are lettered for ATSF and Denver & Rio Grande.

CB&Q skirted the edge of Wisconsin along the Mississippi between the Illinois border and Prescott.   Atlas just released some new GP9s for Soo Line (WC division) and Milwaukee, as well as Soo RS1s in maroon. InterMontain makes F units for Soo (passenger FP7 and freight schemed F7), Milwaukee (both the earlier two tone orange and later solid orange schemes) and CNW F7s.  Kato just put out CNW F2 A and B sets in the old scheme. Atlas also makes GP7s and SD9s. Life Like used to make SD7s which are okay on detail but the motors weren't the best (and hard to convert to DCC), but the shells should fit on Atlas frames.  Depending on if 1970 is a firm cutoff or if it's 1970s, the Milwaukee would have SD40s in the early 70s (N scale models made by Kato) and their other fun stuff like SD10 rebuilds and the SDL39 series. And the Missabe used to lease their power to the Milwaukee in the wintertime.  Other than that, you'll probably have to custom paint your own stuff, especially Soo Line.

Bachmann tends to include curves with a radius too small for most trains (even though they make larger ones).  For context, my first n scale was a Bachmann. It included 11.25"" radius curves. Every locomotive (even other brands) derailed on them. Got some 12.5"" radius curves to replace the old ones, and derailments disappeared overnight."

Rumor has it that MRC decoders are a bit touch and go but lately they seem to have worked that all out.  Online retailers such as modeltrainstuff.com are great for finding specific decoders and the website for Digitrax lists what decoders are made for different locomotives, so those will be easy to find.  A simple google search for other brands should also suffice.  For brands such as Atlas and Kato, most of their locomotives are DCC friendly, or DCC ready which seems to be the same thing haha, but the installations should only take about 20-40 seconds depending on the locomotive.  modeltrainstuff.com is, to me, the obvious choice of online vendor given their prices and stock selection.  Other places such as Amazon don't have the same amount of information available, but if you know the exact product you are looking for, then you should be fine.  Other than that, your local stores and train shows can be useful too.  I am thinking of getting the PowerCab myself, given that it is user friendly and fits my needs and budget.  Good Luck!"

modeltrains,2obhxf,MichaelArnold,1 point,Fri Dec 5 03:31:03 2014 UTC,Easiest thing to do is download some track plan software. You can get an Any rail trial that will let you put down 50 pieces of track without having the full version. Any rail is super simple and easy to use. And yes. Fast Track is very nice stuff.
modeltrains,2obhxf,pretzelcuatl,1 point,Fri Dec 5 03:38:33 2014 UTC,"8x4 is tight but better than nothing.  If you go 0-27 instead of full 0 you'll fit more.  Most of my trains are MTH.  Lionel is great, but they're a little more expensive.  Check out the MTH website -- they have a budget 0-27 line called RailKing that, well, it ain't 0, but locos cost about a third as much, and they can run on 0 track if you upgrade.  Weaver builds nice 0 trains but I've had lots of tech problems with them.  MTH is the most solid and affordable.  I've got about twenty engines...!"

modeltrains,2obhxf,dwwojcik,1 point,Fri Dec 5 03:33:25 2014 UTC,"Yes, the turn radius is 27"" instead of 31"", and you wouldn't want to put a full 0 engine on those tracks.

modeltrains,2obhxf,Cross-Country,1 point,Fri Dec 5 03:55:59 2014 UTC,DCC isn't for three-rail O.  It only works for 2 rail DC systems.  Both Lionel and MTH make AC compatible systems that function similarly (TMCC2 Legacy and DCS respectively) but they would probably be overkill for a 4x8.
modeltrains,2obhxf,pretzelcuatl,1 point,Fri Dec 5 12:06:37 2014 UTC,A couple of years ago I bought a couple of Lionel starter sets to put some trains under the Christmas tree.  The starter sets are more economical than buying individual components.  Has everything you need for a basic layout and you can use your existing equipment with them.  BTW:  Lionel sells conversion tracks that allow FastTrak to be connected to classic.

Just be aware that most MTH trains are O-42 and while they'll run on the same track as Lionel, the scale may be a little off."

There might not be enough differences in the width of the rail base to make a difference.

What sort of construction did you use for the surface? Is that track on road bed right on plywood or does it have a foam layer? Are you making yours for a home layout or for club meet ups?
modeltrains,2o4dwj,Bronze80,2,Wed Dec 3 04:26:11 2014 UTC,I personally Avoid foam for subroadbed on portable modules. It's not really meant to hold up.

I'd assume HO has a few more options in terms of buildings, though I've seen a number of N scale Japanese buildings, temples, etc.  I think a better question to be asking yourself is what exactly do you want to build out (a few houses, a street/neighborhood, an entire village?) and how much physical space can you dedicate to it.  You might force yourself into a scale just by answering that."

You don't have to use their stuff but check it for ideas.  Don't use premade grass mats or the like -- take the time to build it up yourself and you'll be much happier IMHO.  I'm no expert, but I always use a sheet of homasote (or similar cellulose board) as the top layer of my layout because it takes glue wonderfully and is easy to paint/pin/nail to.  Grab some foam from a craft store and start building up your land however you want.    Build it up in layers.  Earth tone paint, layer of dirt, layer of grass, etc.  Get the base done first (dirt and grass where you want it) before getting overwhelmed.

I don't think the number boards light up but the ditch lights are functional right out of the box. You can always add an extra set of LEDs yourself for the number boards if you're comfortable with soldering. I added a Digitrax SDH166D sound decoder to it because it came DCC-ready and it looks/sound great!   I also own an Intermountain SD40-2 which came equipped with a ESU Lokpilot non-sound decoder. Once again, great detail and the slow-speed performance of the ESU decoder is phenomenal. I just bought it this year so I would assume the Intermountain GEVOs have a similar motor and probably the same decoder. If I would've had the extra money I would've gotten the sound version because the ESU LokSound decoders are fantastic. Hope this helps!  EDIT: I forgot to mention that my SD40-2 does have lit-up number boards that are controlled by function 5. Not sure if the GEVO does, but just figured I'd tell you."
modeltrains,2nx1sr,capngrandan,2,Mon Dec 1 15:00:10 2014 UTC,"The Athearn NS units bother me endlessly because the headlights are in the wrong place.

To think they'd do complete runs of special units without attending to that obvious detail is baffling.  /rant  Intermountain have been getting good reviews and the ones I've heard sound pretty good, if you prefer lower cost the Bachmann models are an option. There are also a handful of Youtube channels dedicated to reviewing locos and such which may be helpful."

Personally I think they look a little better than what Athearn was offering(especially their molded over fan cover).    Quite recently I acquired some AC6000 BLI loco's and I am totally blown away with their performance.  They by far sound the best out of all the top tier manufacturers IMHO.  At the level we're talking about, most all of them are great operating at low speed."

In both of them the number boards lit. The only con on the Genesis? the lights are bulbs not LED's.  I also have some GEVO's from Intermountain and even they are not as detailed as the Genesis the amount of detailed is good.  I really like them, and the lights are LEDs. Some folks said that are too light, but I've running 20-25 cars long trains with a single unit without a problem."

modeltrains,2nw287,Trainfanz,1 point,Mon Dec 1 03:48:52 2014 UTC,"If the engines are mostly Tyco or old Bachmann I'd maybe think twice before spending a ton of time repairing them. The old Tyco and Bachmann stuff is pretty crappy to begin with so you might be better off checking eBay for some newer running engines and getting rid of the bad ones. For example you can get older Athearn blue box engines for fairly cheap and some of them can even be had in brand-new condition. Those things are indestructible, which would be good for a 5-year-old.   However, if you do go the route to clean and fix them some cleaning and lubrication of the motor can go a long way. There are a bunch of Youtube videos out there on cleaning and lubricating engines. I use Labelle lubricants for my trains and they have worked great for me so far. Some have said that using Dexron ATF works well too though."

You break the two pieces apart, flip one of them around, and then you'll have the tapered sides that you expect.  As for the ""slenderness"", HO roadbed is not going to fit under O track, for sure.  Since HO is ""Half-O"", you might be able to put an un-separated piece in the middle, and then the two tapered pieces on the outside to make it wide enough."

This has to be done carefully though, because if you were to just lay track directly off the cork to the plywood the sudden change would certainly cause derailments.  That being said however, his ""real world"" choice of a 2% is a bit excessive since model trains can handle much steeper grades than the locomotives they are meant to represent, a steeper grade would take less space to get to plywood level, giving him more room for his industries."

Other buildings are bought pre-made in a white rendered finish and they will be placed together where that is appropriate.  I think that it is important to show common materials being used in the same locality. ie in an area where the buildings are of a particular type of brick a wooden structure would stand out as inappropriate and visa-versa. As long as there is uniformity that makes sense in this way then anything goes, it's your layout after all :-)"

modeltrains,2nmu8o,marauder3058,3,Fri Nov 28 18:39:10 2014 UTC,"I think you can add in the technical skills required. Like the woodwork required to construct baseboards and the electrical work, including soldering and devising appropriate circuits. Also creating workable gradients and clearances. Then there are the artistic skills like carving foam, landscaping and scenery and painting of all kinds.  I do all kinds of historical research so that colours, vehicles and buildings are correct for the time my layout is set in. I have also researched farming practices and aspects of society at the time so I know that my layout correctly illustrates a time and a place in history.   I love looking at the American and Australian mountain, logging and mining railroads that are so different from anything in the UK. They are very inspirational for the amount of detail I would like to achieve.   I have a military railway that is separate from but connected to my post WW2 English country railway. As part of that I have soldiers on parade, doing PT, doing fatigues and vehicle maintenance. Then off-duty they are shown playing cricket behind the barracks and off base there are officers looking at horses at the cattle market whilst the lower ranks are having a chat with a one-legged veteran outside the pub called The Boars Head (more of that in a minute) and one who is meeting his wife and kids.  The cattle market is the focus for lots of activity but some boys have left the crowd to throw rocks in a pool under an out-flow pipe (Woodland Scenics water effects anybody?) As well as the livestock market there are market stalls including of course a tea-stall flying a Union Jack. This all takes place by the Branch Line station that services a small English village with a church, (where a tethered goat is working to keep the grass short) and workers cottages. I construct prefab housing that was used at the time from the Dapol bungalow kit. On the edge of the village is the piggery (hence the name of the pub) and meat processing works where the trackside buildings will be detailed inside with hanging carcases I am carving from old model cows.  It took me a month to make and paint three buildings as part of the dairy complex that has its own sidings for the daily milk train. I detailed the inside of the milking parlour with a separate pump room and staffed the complex with teenage sized milk-maids made from a set of white-metal choir-boys with a bit of filing. The dairy complex is being built over the tunnels I needed to construct to get all the lines around a corner in the room before heading into the town area and mainline station. It has its own Wayside halt.  And people think I just ""Play trains"" !"

Normal (non-rechargeable) batteries respond very poorly to being charged, generally by bursting and spilling corrosive goo everywhere.  I suspect, because they're still using NiCd chemistries, that their charging circuit is trickle-charge based.  NiCd can take a continual, low level charge without suffering permanent damage.  The same is NOT true of NiMH chemistries.  So as long as you use a NiCd 9V-like rechargeable battery, you should be fine."

modeltrains,2nen60,Bronze80,3,Tue Nov 25 20:26:52 2014 UTC,"If the track plan is worth a damn, it will include a track piece listing.  If not, you can attempt to re-draw the track plan with something like scarm (windows, free), anyrail (windows, free limited version / $ full version), 3rd plan-it (windows, $$), RailModeler (mac, $) that will let you draw your track plan using pieces from a track library, and then when you're done, give you a list of all the pieces you use and how many of each of them.  If you like your partially completed layout, instead of starting over, why not just do one piece of yours at a time.  Build a mountain.  Run trains for a bit.  Build part of town (or all of town).  Play some more.  Build an industry.    You don't have to do all of it at once, and dividing it up makes it a lot less overwhelming."
modeltrains,2nen60,fotbr,2,Tue Nov 25 20:43:49 2014 UTC,Thanks for the tips on the software. I think downsizing is partially due to being overwhelmed by the larger layouts and also I don't know where I'd set up a 3'x6' layout at the moment. The convenience and portability of a 2'x3' seems to appeal to me.
modeltrains,2nen60,fotbr,2,Tue Nov 25 21:02:37 2014 UTC,"Oh, If you're after small(er) sizes, I'd also recommend looking into some of the modular standards that have developed.  FreeMo-N, TTrack, whatever the NMRA standard is called (NTRACK?), and probably a couple others I can't think of off the top of my head might also give you ideas.  You can also come up with your own ""standard"" that's as simple as you like -- so you can build module(s) as you feel like it or get around to it, and connect them together, even if only temporarily, when you have space for a ""big"" layout.  I'm doing a variation of the freemo-n standard for my personal layout - that way I can build a <insert industry, feature, etc> and not worry about anything else."

modeltrains,2n9wgb,easttex45,2,Mon Nov 24 16:33:36 2014 UTC,"This sounds like an issue with the track. The locomotive runs, so that is good.  The outside rails are not insulated from each other, but they should be insulated from the center rail. If you know how polarity works, the center rail is positive and the outside rails are negative. If there is a bad connection on one of the pieces of track, the center may have lost it's insulation and is causing a short.  I would check all of the pieces of track or maybe try some other track, test it piece by piece."

modeltrains,2n9wgb,cjcampo61,2,Mon Nov 24 20:24:56 2014 UTC,Sounds to me like the E-Unit  in the engine is dirty.  This is the reversing unit on your AC powered trains.  The contact drum and fingers can get dirty and cause problems Also the solenoid plunger can get sticky with age.  A good cleaning with electrical contact cleaner will help.

There's no point in continuing with something that you don't totally like, you'll loose interest and be frustrated/discouraged.    It's debatable whether it's worth trying to salvage the track. It's expensive, particularly the turnouts, but easily damaged on removal and then there's all the ballast to clean off before it goes back down. May be worth trying though.    One piece of advice before starting the new layout. Plan the layout, not the track. Yes, you need a trackplan, but that's only a small part of the whole. Plan the industries, scenery, roads, wiring, operations, et cetera and make sure it's what you really want before you start actually building. Take your time and do it right."

Nails & Spikes can be carefully pried up and then removed with a decent pair of needle nose pliers.  Track glued down with Elmers / white glue can sometimes be pried up with something like a putty knife.

The reason i am asking for a ballpark figure is because i have a possible buyer for the job lot, and i have no idea what the whole lot is worth, so i came here to hopefully get a better idea."
modeltrains,2mz62l,roborabbit,2,Fri Nov 21 15:46:02 2014 UTC,"Best advice is to catalog everything with part numbers and descriptions so you have a list of everything. Then start searching e-bay for similar items. There is an option on e-bay to search through ""Completed listings"". This will give you a good idea of what people are realistically buying these trains for or if there is even any interest in such and item.  The Hornby A4 Mallard you have appeared to fetch approximately $65 - $100 USD, 40 - 65 GBP in recent auctions. Your A4 Mallard could be in that price range if it runs well.  Be aware that there are special editions of that A4 Mallard locomotive that fetched considerably more. That's why I pointed out to catalog all the details.  If you are comfortable selling on e-bay and you saw that there is demand for that train item you could put it up for a low starting bid and it should be bid up to a reasonable price.  A detailed description of the train item will be important including if you have to original box and the condition of it. If you can test run the items and mention how well it runs in the auction description it will help you get a higher price. Be aware that your track could be dirty and the wheels on the locomotives could be dirty too. The dirt will prevent smooth running. Seek out help from a hobby shop or someone in the hobby on cleaning track and locomotive wheels or admit in the auction that you don't know the running condition. There are some pretty simple tricks and tools to get trains running their best.  An alternative to e-bay would be to look for model train shows or swap meets in your area. You could set up a table with your trains and sell them there. Again it will help if you looked up on e-bay what is considered a reasonable price.  If you were to sell your collection to a hobby shop they would only offer you a small percentage of what you would make selling it yourself. The shops want to make a profit too. To get the most money for this collection you will need to sell it yourself. Sell all the items individually (keep sets together: sell sets like the TGV as one set). The exception is if you have miscellaneous items, like track, that you are only getting a few cents for anyways.  I have bought and sold different model trains from around the world and I can't keep up on what things are worth. The prices change with economic times and demand. There isn't a simple answer to what this collection is worth. You appear to have a mix of nice items and average items. You either have to catalog the collection and determine its value or sell it at a discount and let someone else figure it out."

But im still going to give everything a once over on live track.   I remember cleaning track and wheels when i was younger so ill watch a few youtube videos and give everything a good clean. The reason i ws asking for a ballpark figure is because im in need of the money pretty much right now and i have a possible buyer. So i want a few inputs on roughly how much it is all worth, as at the minute if he tells me a price i wont know if its high or low. I have a vague idea of how much i think its all worth.   When i was photographing it all i made sure to leave the end of the boxes visible so i could just use the photos to research average prices. I used ebay for most of this. I have only researched the engines so far.   I came here to ask for a ballpark figure because i dont have a lot of time due to work and studies, i am slowly getting through it all though.  One thing that i think is a plus is that i have kept about 90% if not more of the boxes in VG condition.

OO is a scale (1:76.2) while HO is (1:87). While they do use roughly the same track the scales are slightly different   00 uses the same track as HO (16.5 mm/​0.65 in gauge), which is not correct for this slightly larger scale, but it is the most common British standard for ready-to-run trains."

I saw a really good price on a Lionel Polar Express train for around the tree. My son was two at the time and he loved it. He isn't really into Thomas at all, but he sat on the floor with me and just watched the train go around. It lasted for about two days and then the train crapped out. I sent it back and decided to do some more research and maybe get a really good train. I ended up going for a N-scale layout because I didn't have much space to set up. I didn't give up on getting a set for the Christmas tree though. I did some hunting on eBay and ended up buying an LGB G-scale set. It's just the starter set, but I think it will work great around the tree. My son, who is now three, has a great time with it. I now let him take the controls (I'm always ready to jump in if there is a problem). He's actually been really good about it. He doesn't touch it if I am not there with him. Which is pretty incredible, because that dude is a maniac. I guess all three year old kids are maniacs though. It sounds like you and the whole family might have found a fun hobby. Have fun!"
modeltrains,2mv1pe,The-Rev,1 point,Thu Nov 20 10:38:41 2014 UTC,I am concerned with getting a small scale train because I have seen how he plays with the wooden trains. Would you recommend G-scale over O-scale for kids?

modeltrains,2mtrpw,Hawkeye_Pierce1952,2,Thu Nov 20 00:33:20 2014 UTC,"It depends on what you want to do with your layout.  Personally, I went with N, but that's almost entirely because I like long trains.  There is a much better selection and availability of trains & accessories in HO though, and much more detail in the models."
modeltrains,2mtrpw,fotbr,1 point,Thu Nov 20 00:54:30 2014 UTC,"Well, I really like switching and operations. Do you think I would get more out of N for that?"
modeltrains,2mtrpw,WarpedHorizon,1 point,Thu Nov 20 02:42:51 2014 UTC,"Yes, N will allow about twice as much in an area as HO. Longer trains, bigger yards, more impressive scenery are N's big advantages. But you might want to  try both first- spend some time at a show, shop, or club and try to operate both.   No matter what you choose consider building on a shelf. Less to be overwhelmed by, smaller footprint, and easier to move and rebuild if necessary. 12"" by 6' is enough for a few spurs, a passing track, and some scenery."
modeltrains,2mtrpw,fotbr,1 point,Thu Nov 20 06:50:13 2014 UTC,"Probably, because you can fit more in an area.  But even at N scale, a mile would be 33 feet, so nothing is going to be perfectly realistic, so keep that in mind.  Selective editing of what you want to put in your layout (ie, leaving things out) is going to be important, regardless of scale.  BUT.  4'6"" is probably too wide to lean over, so you'll need access from both sides, so take that into account.  Unless you have good access to it, I'd keep your layout to a width that you can easily and comfortably reach to the other side of.  There's a website that was posted here not too long ago that has been a good resource over the years when it comes to small layouts, and IIRC, they're mostly HO, so it's not impossible to have a good operating & switching setup in a small space with HO too."
modeltrains,2mtrpw,RokurGepta,1 point,Thu Nov 20 16:23:59 2014 UTC,"I agree with fotbr, N scale will allow you to have longer trains and more scenery without it seeming so jammed into a small space. I run both for that reason. I run HO primarily at larger club layouts and N at home. There is way more stuff available in HO, but the amount of N stuff is getting pretty darn good. Both scales rock."

My first HO layout will be on a 4X8ft sheet, but even that is not a lot of room for it. If you want to do a switching layout try to go longer and narrower. This will accommodate HO scale.  Personally I am going with HO for my main layout because of price and availability. I am enjoying N scale for this initial layout, but it just isn't for me."

The shelf is 11.5"" wide and goes most of the way around the room except where the 3' wide walkway to the door is.  This gap is where I am going to have a removable bridge to link the two sides.  The room I am building it in is the 9'9"" x 10'3"" bedroom in this photo.  The closet door has been removed and the shelf crosses in front of the opening.  So really I have lots of room for rolling stock to roam as well as be housed in whatever sidings I build and a rail yard.    I am here for at least another year so no big deal.

modeltrains,2ms2n8,Goodatwhatido,6,Wed Nov 19 15:58:39 2014 UTC,"I'm going to look at this from another perspective, you're not going to see a lot of sales over the holiday seasons.  Yes, the few sets that are sold in Target/Walmart/Toys-R-Us may go on sale, but otherwise you won't see a lot.  Margins are thin on model trains, the people who sell them just can't offer big discounts no matter what the occasion.  Train shows are a mixed bag.  Some of the sellers at them seem to offer things at top dollar, I think hoping that the random public that comes in really doesn't have a good idea of what they cost.  Others offer some phenomenal deals because they work off volume and loyalty with repeat customers.  So you can find good deals, but you absolutely have to be careful.  Find some of the people who have set up layouts at the show and ask them which vendors they recommend for what you want.  Many of them will go to the shows year after year, and will have developed an idea of who has good prices."
modeltrains,2ms2n8,nscale,6,Wed Nov 19 22:58:21 2014 UTC,"I've been going to area shows long enough that I know which vendors are likely to have the items I'm looking for. Prices on new items are generally pretty good (most of these guys don't operate out of a storefront, so they don't have that overhead).   You've done your research. If the price looks good, grab it. Be sure to take the vendor's business card just in case there's a warranty issue."
modeltrains,2ms2n8,Jeff_Faust,3,Wed Nov 19 23:38:17 2014 UTC,"Train shows are risky.  I got screwed on a G-scale Bachmann 4-6-0 Big Hauler.  Worked ok on the level test track at the show, but couldn't manage a 0.0001% grade at home.  No way to return it.  The only reason I'll go to a show any more is to see the modular layouts, or perhaps pick up something non-functional (scenery) or easily fixed (rolling stock)."
modeltrains,2ms2n8,reddRad,1 point,Wed Nov 19 19:20:41 2014 UTC,Do they sell brand new things at decent prices?
modeltrains,2ms2n8,reddRad,3,Wed Nov 19 19:52:51 2014 UTC,"In my experience, there may be a couple actual large hobby stores with a presence at the show, but the vast majority of sellers seem to be people who buy up discontinued stock, or estate sales, or from closing hobby shops, and then just resell whatever they have.  So yea, there are some ""brand new"" things, but you don't get the normal advantage of new stuff like warranties or being able to return them.  Also, you have to go through tons of garage sale quality stuff to possibly find something good.  I don't mean to put you off train show sales, but like I said, I got burned and am pretty down on them (at least for high-tech things like engines).  By the way, your post also asked about Black Friday train sales.. Just FYI, I don't recall seeing any significant sales the last few years, and even if there are sales, it always seems to be the things you don't want."
modeltrains,2ms2n8,MichaelArnold,1 point,Wed Nov 19 23:18:53 2014 UTC,Oh yes. Just have to get there early and look at everything. I picked up 3 Life Like P2K SD60M's BRAND NEW at the last show I went to. Retail price on those were $149.99 and they already had $40 DCC decoders installed in them. So we're looking at $189.99 a piece brand new. $570 for all three. I paid $165 for all three of them. Amazing deal.
modeltrains,2ms2n8,Juxen,2,Thu Nov 27 00:21:03 2014 UTC,"Train shows are possibly the best deals you can get, if you know what you're looking for. Sometimes it involves a lot of luck, like if the salesman doesn't know the value of what he's selling. I knew of a guy who got two DCC-equipped SD45's for a total of $30. They looked and ran just fine. Turns out the guy had inherited the trains and didn't know what he was selling.  Just take your time, do research on what you'd like, and come up with a realistic number in your head. If you don't find them at the show (or they're too expensive), you can always check eBay. Also, there's a website here that sells new locomotives for far less than MSRP, and I've heard several good reviews about it.  Good luck!"
modeltrains,2ms2n8,The-Rev,2,Wed Nov 19 16:43:49 2014 UTC,"Take your phone and look things up before you buy. I always hit train shows about an hour before closing on the last day. If it's been slow you can get good deals. A little while back I managed to pick up a full starter G scale set (piko, nothing fancy), an extra 8ft of track. And 3 extra cars for 250. I was excited, but now my wife won't let me go to another show unsupervised..."
modeltrains,2ms2n8,Rayd8630,2,Wed Nov 19 18:23:02 2014 UTC,"Train shows can be good and bad. Ive bought a couple locos from shows and they were probably $50-100 bucks less than retail with decoders installed. One wasnt working too well-needed a good cleaning out from over oiling. If you are buying used, you should know how to service what you are buying or you could essentially be buying over priced garbage. What you can always do is what I have done: offer to leave a piece of collateral and in exchange, they let you take it to a layout in the show where you can try it. This is if you are buying used. When I hit the shows, I find the same stores hit the same shows and usually have the same offerings as the last show. Sometimes they have deals (such as save the taxes), but sometimes they mark up the prices a little to make it look like its a bargain. This is where having your smart phone on you (as others have mentioned) will save you. As well if the saying is ""Timing is everything"" then I find the shows generally work like this: The mornings are when all the stuff is out including the rare one off pieces and custom built pieces that are overpriced and the stuff they know will sell like hot cakes is out. Dont expect to be able to barter at this time AT ALL. In the afternoon usually a couple hours before closing bartering is generally more effective as the vendors look to make some last minute cash. Just make sure its something you want. Or you will end up taking a huge hit trying to off load it when you decide you dont want it. As for deals after Thanksgiving well being from Canada, I cannot say too much about the deals down in the US. But I have found that outside of the Walthers flyer, deals and discounts in this hobby are few and far between. The stuff at the department stores is just entry level crap that is usually left overs from old runs/tooling and designs that arent used anymore/entry level thats designed to go around the X-mas tree and sit in the attic for 40 years until its discovered, posted on this sub, and the poster finds out its worth 40 bucks on Ebay."

It was mainly 5 or 6 hobby stores from the area and then individuals that set up what looked like flea market tables that specialized in trains. The hobby stores that were there charged exactly the same as they charged at their store, plus there was an admission fee.  I live about a hour from Atlanta, so I wouldn't frequent those hobby stores anyway and I don't really have a local shop, but nobody can beat the prices of online stores like modeltrainstuff. If I had a shop in town, I may pay a 10% premium to get stuff quicker and to support them, but the markup is usually more like 25%. I always get stuff online now and I probably won't be going to any more train shows."

modeltrains,2mqvfp,ptownpaul,2,Wed Nov 19 14:50:48 2014 UTC,If you try this technique WEAR GLOVES!!!  Great stuff works very well but the stuff is nearly impossible to remove from your skin.  Also I would use trash bags under and around anything you are spraying this stuff on as it's hard to remove from hard surfaces too.   That said don't be afraid to manipulate it a bit by hand once you spray it. It is very malleable and although it has a short cure time you can shape it to an extent like drywall mud.   The original great stuff will push so be aware that of you fill a gap with it it may move things around.  The door and window formula is much more forgiving in that respect but the final product is also very soft so Use the 2 different formulas based on the application.   Final note:  WEAR GLOVES

I don't think it's exactly an uncommon piece, but it's old enough that you'd have a hard time finding one for sale.  Looks rather beat up to me, but if it's in working order and not rusted or anything, it would be likely to fetch several hundred bucks on an auction at the least.

modeltrains,2mpnd7,Thezanthex,6,Tue Nov 18 22:52:19 2014 UTC,"Here's a little advice, take it for what it's worth.   You need to inventory it.   I know that's probably a giant pain in the ass, but the details are everything.   Locomotives, cars, accessories - start a spreadsheet of what you've got, and try to capture manufacturer and model or model number of everything.   Ebay can help a lot with this, as a reference.  If you try to sell the stuff in a lot, like to a hobby shop, you're going to take a bath.  They will offer cents on the dollar.   If you have an inventory, and do a little research on line (once you know what an item is, you can search ""completed"" auctions on Ebay to get a feel for real market prices), you'll be infinitely better armed for sale.  If you have regular train shows in your area, they usually have a flea market/vendor area where you can buy a table and sell stuff.  Go to  train show, regardless, and see what vendors are asking for the kind of items that you have.  Again, knowledge is power.  You'll be faced with a couple of choices - sell the stuff on Ebay, once you have a good working knowledge of what it is (this will get you the most money, but will also be the most time consuming and sometimes frustrating - take it from somebody who is an active Ebay seller/buyer).  Second, you can find train shows as noted above and sell from a table, and finally, you negotiate a lot sale either with a hobby shop, or possibly with collectors if you advertise the opportunity at train sites on the internet.  In almost every case, they're going to start by asking what you have - so you're back to inventory.  If you don't have the patience for an inventory, you might be able to find a model train fan in the area that's willing to do it for you, in exchange for something from the inventory.   This may be the fastest way - a knowledgeable person will save you a shit-ton of time in figuring out what you have, rather than you having to start from scratch.  It would be worth it for you to negotiate a trade of some kind for their expertise.  Hope this helps - good luck!"

So whether you have a gold mine or just a lot of trouble is impossible to know.  And of course auctioneers/appraisers know this and will likely screw you.  Best bet is to list things in small batches on eBay as you figure out what they are and let the market decide, but that's a ton of work as well.  Really it comes down to asking what your time is worth to you.  PS:  Sorry about your grandfather."

Get this stuff inventoried and you can price it out and take it to a few train shows. Keep in mind you are not going to get retail prices at a train show, People are looking for a deal so Knock $50 off of each engine unless it's really pricy then make it $100 off and this stuff will fly off your tables. Btw the all of the Georgia stuff is great as locals like buying local road names.  Train Shows   Golden Spike is having a show in January http://www.gserr.com/shows.htm Another show in March http://www.themodeltrainshow.com/ There's probably a few shows on this list as well: http://www.railserve.com/events/train_shows.html   I hope this helps.

I ballasted the track and lined part of the tunnel with come faux brick that is made of foam and sticks right on. I was thinking of going for a more natural look, but went with this to save money. I also placed two lights inside that are hidden behind the foam, this provides some soft light so it still looks underground like.

modeltrains,2mp211,Trainfanz,2,Tue Nov 18 20:51:29 2014 UTC,"Your link is not a Schnabel car, as mentioned previously.  Schnabel cars are typically used for transporting unusually heavy solid loads like transformers.  The car you linked to would be used in a foundry setting, transporting molten metals.  You better have a lot of room to run or even display these buggers.  My specialty is HO scale.  Bachmann released a 'passable' Schnabel car in HO a year or two ago.  There are a few resin HO kits for these cars also.    I agree, these cars are special.  Only a few of each type are ever manufactured, which leads to scarcity among model railroad offerings.   If you can't find what you want, you might consider building one yourself!"

modeltrains,2mp211,wpnw,1 point,Tue Nov 18 21:51:31 2014 UTC,"There are actually quite a few O scale cars that would fit with what you're looking for, the problem is making sure you have both the clearance on any layout(s) you may want to run them on, as well as an appropriate curve radius.  Most of those really big cars are limited to a minimum of 42"" diameter curves - some need wider even.  MTH and Atlas have both made big, unique looking rolling stock like this - MTH has done a Schnabel, a similar type of hot metal tank car to what you linked above, and Atlas has done Articulate Auto Carriers.  The best Lionel has I think would be double-stack container cars or something like that, which aren't terribly unique.  If you don't have a hobby shop near you that stocks O gauge stuff, I would suggest you start by browsing through MTH's catalogs to see what they have available - they have by far the best variety of rolling stock (though some of it - particularly the stuff that falls under their ""Rail King"" line is much more toy-like, if you're trying to avoid that sort of thing)."

I was always blown away by the quality HO and N scale layouts I'd see at train shows when I was a kid, while the group that my dad was a part of was always running stereotypical ""toy trains"" around a big boring loop - often at near warp speed.  I think had there not been a huge movement toward serious 3-rail scale stuff in the late 90s I would have dropped the hobby entirely.  I guess the big manufacturers (MTH, Lionel) have to market to the demographic, but I always shake my head when a new catalog comes out and it's still full of said ""toys"".  I can't imagine they'll be able to continue producing that kind of stuff once the baby boomer generation dies out.  Either way, I'm glad this is winning approval of non-O folks.   The amount of planning that must have gone into that benchwork is staggering.    The benchwork actually didn't require a whole lot of planning.  It was the track plan that took so much time.  We went through literally hundreds of different variants before settling on a design.  One of the original finalists was going to feature a 13-foot long model of the North Fork Bridge spanning the walkway.  I actually had started building it as a project for shop class in high school before we decided that particular design wasn't quite going to work (not due to the bridge, some of the curves around the wall corners were cutting it way too close)."

modeltrains,2melv3,Krauj95,1 point,Sun Nov 16 00:18:32 2014 UTC,How much planning went into the track layout? Did you start mapping out track with pen and paper or did you start with one loop and build everything off it?
modeltrains,2melv3,JustinMagill,1 point,Tue Nov 18 17:12:34 2014 UTC,"I think it started out on just printer paper, yeah.  But then we got hold of a program called RR-Track (which was pretty much the only option 15 years ago) and started to go from there.  It worked decently enough to give us an idea, but it was hard to work with whole pieces of track (and flex track was a nightmare, even though we didn't end up using it except for straightaways because Atlas-O flex is really hard to actually flex).  So eventually we went back to paper and ended up doing most of the design work on a 2x3 foot sheet of 1"" grid paper for nice easy scaling.  It helped that my dad was a landscape architect by trade for many years, so he was very inclined to the planning process.  We didn't actually start building anything until we had a solid idea of how it was going to end up working, because it was basically a 100% commitment to a single design once it was started, due to the spacing needed in several tight areas."

I painted the brick red with model paints, adding details like darker shades under the windows, etc. Then I painted the concrete parts, like the windowsills and foundation. Let that dry for a few days. I make a paste of artist pastel chalk and isopropyl alcohol. I slather said paste all over the brickwork, being sure to get it into the mortar lines real good. The alcohol lets it dry quickly, otherwise it would take forever. Make sure you let your initial paint work dry for at least a couple days, or the alcohol might take it off. Rub the dried chalk mixture gently with a slightly damp washcloth or towel. Don't have it too wet or rub too hard or it will take it out of the mortar lines too. I recommend practicing on a small, cheaper building to practice first."

If you do decide to go N-scale, then the Tomix ""Thomas and Friends"" sets are great for keeping kids interested.

The National Model Railroad Association is largely responsible for making model railroading what it is today, by creating standards and best-practices, as well as providing a framework and network for small clubs to grow and prosper. Not all divisions have a youth subdivision, but some of the larger ones do. I would recommend contacting a division near you, and if they don't have a youth division, I'm sure they'll be more than happy to provide advice and information. www.nmra.org/regions www.nmra.org/beginners-guide  Finally, I would like to share a free digital magazine that has quite a community tied to it. Model Railroad Hobbyist. Again, its geared towards adults, but you can still find information and probably get help there. www.model-railroad-hobbyist.com/  My biggest tip is that you can find a guide to pretty much anything on YouTube, or elsewhere on the Internet. I'll just throw out some links to railroad-related websites I happen to have sitting in my bookmarks. Some may be irrelevant, but I still throw them out there: http://www.virtualrailroader.com/ http://www.modeltrainsoftware.com/ http://www.wymann.info/ShuntingPuzzles/ http://jmri.sourceforge.net/ http://www.carendt.com/ http://www.modeltrainstuff.com http://www.modelrailroadforums.com"

modeltrains,2m9soj,Smurphizzle,1 point,Sat Nov 22 04:25:46 2014 UTC,"Well it depends on the scale you uses. You can get a micro scale that's about 1'x2', or you can get a large scale for 8'x12'. There are scales between these, but I'm just showing the size difference."
modeltrains,2m9soj,Mock_Frog,1 point,Fri Nov 14 11:24:21 2014 UTC,It can take up as much space as you throw at it.  There are setups out there that are well over 1000 square feet.  You pretty much have to decide how much space you will want to use and go from there.
modeltrains,2m9soj,marauder3058,3,Fri Nov 14 18:58:04 2014 UTC,I would suggest a Athearn Iron Horse set if he is into HO. Decent starter set for $150ish.

They are good quality without being super high end and thus super expensive.  The ""Warbonnet"" sets are 1950's era and the ""Iron Horse"" could represent the 1970's to present day.

modeltrains,2m9soj,webculb,2,Fri Nov 14 20:14:58 2014 UTC,"The three most popular scales in the US are N, HO, and O.  Basically N is small, HO is medium, and O is large size.   The best thing to do is see if there is a local store that specializes in trains. That way you can see the size differences and decide on what size you want to get.   To answer your questions:   Amazon for N or HO scale, ebay for anything, and modeltrainstuff.com for anything. A good quality basic train set runs from $150ish to $450ish depending on scale. If $300 is the absolute max I would recommend N or HO scale. An O scale set will set you back more like $400 if you want something of good quality.

As long as you don't want to run long engines and long cars you can get away with small radius curves. I would use a switcher type locomotive, some flat cars to put the plates on and a caboose if you like. If you use 24"" radius curves that's a 4' diameter curve which if centered leaves you 2' foot along the sides between the edge of the table and the track for people have room to eat."

I would consider imbedding the rails into the table, like on street trackage. Probably best to do just rails, since the ties may make the center channel of wood a little too loose, although you will need to be very careful about keeping them exactly in gauge.  As for scale, go with something beefy and childish like Lionel-style O scale, or LGB G scale. True scale models probably wouldn't be stable enough, plus there would be a ton of details to break off or get in the way. You'll want trains that are designed for a young child with strong, over-sized working parts, since this isn't a setting where being gentle is an option."

modeltrains,2ly75b,KJP1990,3,Tue Nov 11 23:58:12 2014 UTC,"Life-Like:       Life-Like Products LLC (now Life-Like Toy and Hobby division of Wm. K. Walthers) is a manufacturer of model railroad products and is based in Baltimore, Maryland.  It was founded in the 1950s by a company that pioneered extruded foam ice chests under the Lifoam trademark. Because ice chests are a summer seasonal item, the company needed a way to keep the factory operating year round. As model railroading was becoming popular in the post-war years, they saw this as an opportunity and so manufactured extruded foam tunnels for model trains. Over the years, Life-Like expanded into other scenery items, finally manufacturing rolling stock beginning in the late 1960s. At some point in the early 1970s, Life-Like purchased Varney Inc. and began to produce the former Varney line as its own.  In 2005, the company, now known as Lifoam Industries, LLC, decided to concentrate on their core products of extruded foam and sold their model railroad operations to Wm. K. Walthers.    Image i - D&H 7301, an EMD GP38-2, is an example of the earlier line of Life-Like products.

I acquired six passenger cars this past weekend at a swap meet - to find out that yes, they don't like to do 18"" turns.  I suppose I should be looking for a minimum of 24"" where these guys will run?  I do think this will have to be a single-town affair - and I'm okay with that.  What I'd like to avoid is a layout that just does loops.  Loops are great for scenery,  showing to people, and just generally watching - but boring as hell to operate."
modeltrains,2lu311,Vectorsxx,2,Mon Nov 10 20:28:50 2014 UTC,"Have you thought about doing an aroud-the-walls style?  Something like this.  I just drew that sorta freehand without considering curve radius or anything like that. But it's something to think about. Just make sure the corners aren't too sharp for the equipment you want to run.   Steam era or first generation diesel era freight cars were mostly 40 footers, and can be happy on relatively tight turns, but modern auto-racks and container trains (or the heyday of streamlined passenger trains) need much wider corners."
modeltrains,2lu311,roj2323,1 point,Mon Nov 10 22:01:51 2014 UTC,"I was thinking about something along these lines myself, but if you put a backdrop in in the very back, you can cut a little area out in the back and have it be an access area that is hidden. This way you can add more track space in the middle if you choose."
modeltrains,2lu311,roj2323,2,Tue Nov 11 01:48:53 2014 UTC,"As has been said before, HO scale is going to be tight with that small of a space. I'd recommend looking into design methods for improving operation in a small space.  For example, I read an article in a back issue of Model Railroader talking about placing a siding with some signage and maybe a few details showing that the siding leads to an industry, but then you save space by having the industry off of the physical layout.  There's also low-relief industries you can do, as well as doing some forced-perspective in scenery. Make sure you put a lot of effort/money into the backdrop, because a simple backdrop can make even a very narrow layout look larger.  If you look through this website, you should find inspiration for fitting in that one extra industry, or just how to get tracks into the tight spot. Carendt is a website made up almost entirely of micro layouts, which are entire model railroads in 4 square feet or less. It's most definitely worth spending some time looking through. www.carendt.com"

My rails were black and are now a slightly lighter black, which fits in with most of the ties I have seen in my area.   I did sand it at first with 400 grit paper, maybe not the best, but what I had handy. It took way too long to get through the coat with that and I discovered that it chipped off easily when I scraped it with my fingernail. It had several days to dry at that point though. Then I took my rail cleaner and ran it across the top of the rails."

Do the following: Put the engines to be programmed on the main, you should be able to alter your speed tables in OPS mode with these engines. Adjust your V max (V mid half this value) for the faster engines down until the max speeds match your slowest ones, then build your speed table from there. Lower V mid for the one that accelerates quicker to max speed to match them.  As for sound, no two engines sound completely alike especially if different prime movers have been installed or upgraded.

modeltrains,2lodll,PM_ME_YOUR_CHESTHAMS,5,Sat Nov 8 14:55:31 2014 UTC,"You have one reversing loop.  So, first, make sure you understand how to wire those up.  They're not straightforward.  Second, you can reverse a train going clockwise to be counterclockwise, but you have no way to reverse a counterclockwise train.  That's going to be frustrating.  Consider adding a second reversing loop for the other direction."
modeltrains,2lodll,reddRad,5,Sat Nov 8 16:41:28 2014 UTC,DCC and an auto reversing module will take care of any problems with the loop. Another loop would take up too much room. That loop will mainly be used to drive trains back in to the yard. I might add a siding or interchange track to dump the cars on before the loco heads to the roundhouse.

modeltrains,2lodll,dwwojcik,1 point,Sun Nov 9 03:57:32 2014 UTC,"Why which part?  That reverse loops are complicated?  They're not really, but you can't just hook up two wires and be done with it.  If you think of a positive and negative rail, when you make a loop, you will end up shorting the positive to the negative.  So you have to isolate the reversing section (break both rails on each end), and while the train is in that block, you need to reverse the polarity of the rest of the layout, so the polarity is correct when it exits the loop.  If you mean why two reversing sections instead of one, just trace your finder along the tracks and try to reverse your direction when you're going counterclockwise.  There's no way without a second reverse loop."

modeltrains,2lodll,DaProf,1 point,Sat Nov 8 20:31:57 2014 UTC,In my opinion its better to have fewer longer tracks as opposed to more shorter ones.  Its more realistic and more practical for switching.
modeltrains,2lodll,DaProf,2,Sat Nov 8 20:43:01 2014 UTC,"I'd put a second reversing loop in there by connecting the inner track on the upper right to the loop around the lake, forming a little bit of a wye. Then you could extend from the spur in the middle near the lake down to the lower left corner.  That would also give you a bit of a folded dog-bone path if you toggled the switched back and forth.  I'd also consider adding a lead track on the left extending out parallel to the main in the lower left. That way when you're switching in the yard you don't have to pull out onto the main."

modeltrains,2lfnv9,Jacob_Marley,1 point,Thu Nov 6 03:31:36 2014 UTC,If you don't like the way dish soap is working out you can dilute isopropyl alcohol with water (70/30) or just use 100% either works. Use an eye dropper or pipette. 50¢ - $1 at the local hobby store.
modeltrains,2lfnv9,fotbr,3,Thu Nov 6 10:30:25 2014 UTC,"You can go either route and be okay.  I've personally always used Scenic Express's matte medium.  They sell a concentrated bottle that you can mix into a 1gal container and get the right mixture.  http://www.sceneryexpress.com/MATTE-MEDIUM-CONCENTRATE-16-OZ/productinfo/EX0030/  White glue and water will work as well just gotta find the right mixture of water to glue.  2:1 water to glue I believe works okay.  The down side to white glue is that it may not dry clear.  The matte medium from Scenic Express or Woodland Scenics will dry clear.  Before using either, remember to spray the ballast first with a water/alcohol mixture after you've brushed it into place and have it formed how you want it to look.  Or a water with Ivory Soap mixture will work too.  This cuts the surface tension of the water and allows the matte medium or white glue mixture to flow between the granules of ballast.  If you don't do this, the glue may bead up and you'll get clumping.  I have not done this, but you might be able to add the alcohol or Ivory Soap directly to the matte medium/white glue mixture.  But try a small batch of that before you do it.  I can't verify it will work properly.  If you wear contacts, or know someone that does, I use empty contact saline containers to put my matte medium in.  Then you can easily drip the matte medium into place and not constantly have to refill a dropper.  I know many people don't like ballasting as it's tedious, but I really enjoy it as it's a simple process.  Be liberal with your glue and around turnouts, esp. the switch points, drip your glue in from the outside of the rails.  Capillary action will carry the glue under the rails and into the inside of the turnout.  But, it won't wick up onto the switch rails and glue them in place.  Also, I will often times after the first soaking of glue has dried, come back and respray the area with my water/alcohol mixture and put more matte medium down.  You want the ballast to be locked in so when you come back to clean the track you won't be breaking chunks loose.  Not to plug my own channel, but I did a ballasting video for YouTube awhile back.  Here is a link to it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWbUMp7cnXQ  You might find it helpful to a point.  Have fun!"
modeltrains,2lfnv9,kent_eh,2,Thu Nov 6 03:21:43 2014 UTC,"My method is pretty basic and fairly common:  Water & white glue, 50/50.  Mist ballast with 70% rubbing alcohol until wet, drip water/glue mix on."

This will help you start to see how the track can be put together snugly.

I think the biggest reason people try to look up the value of their crappy Tyco/Bachmann/other garbage is the they hear about the collectible Lionel and American Flyer stuff and hope that they are sitting on a gold mine, so we definitely need to make clear that its crap. Although, there is the rare occasion when these people actually are sitting on a gold mine, but that is incredibly rare.  However, I do believe on this particular post we are being a bit rude and harsh. If we kick these people to the curb, it could reflect poorly on us when someone just getting into the hobby is considering joining. I'd say help those looking for the value, but do so in a way that is helpful and polite, but won't annoy the rest of us."

I'm not super familiar with old Tyco stuff, but their new stuff is pretty good. A lot of the rails look like they're brass? If that's the case, most of those won't really get a whole lot, old brass rails are hard to use now and require a lot of upkeep. Based just on those pics, I'd guess you could probably ask around $30-$50 for the track and accessories as a lot, probably around $100-$150 for the rolling stock, and if that loco I saw is powered, you'd probably get $20-$40 if it's just regular DC and in decent working shape.

It does appear that several pieces of rolling stock there are missing trucks, which renders them practically valueless.  Your best option is probably to donate the equipment to a youth train club, since its more work than its worth to try and sell them.  As Juxen said, a hundred bucks for the lot is reasonable, although more serious modelers wouldn't even look at these.

On Ebay in the UK the Post Office part as a smaller set is listed from £20 to £50 BiN but people are bidding on one at £8.50. A two-rail set with the LNER coaches is at £100 BiN. I doubt if they will sell though. Hornby have a newer version.  If you are outside of the UK it might be worth more if it's scarce and someone wants it. You might make something from an Ebay sale if the right person comes along otherwise don't get your hopes up.  A dealer might give you e10/£/$ if you are lucky ...  but you know it might sit in the case for months before the right buyer comes along and someone has to be paid to check it and clean it .... 10 is probably the best you can get but maybe you want to keep it as a family heirloom ...

If you model steam era, you might have better luck looking in spaces for On3 or On30 models, since that is one large market that is largely to scale and realistic.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On30_gauge"
modeltrains,2kt5vi,Trainguyrom,1 point,Fri Oct 31 23:53:15 2014 UTC,"So, On30 or On3 models are the same/correct ones for O gauge?  I have an MTH train set, but the buildings are ones that my mother bought from Hawthorne or whatever they used to be called.  I'd like to tie it all together somehow, with figurines that look like they actually would fit in the houses."
modeltrains,2kt5vi,ANGR1ST,2,Sat Nov 1 00:25:46 2014 UTC,"Sort of. I'll have to briefly explain ""narrow gauge"". ""gauge"" is the distance between the rails, while ""scale"" is the size in relation to the prototype (as you know, O scale is 1:48). in America the ""standard gauge"" is 4'8.5"", and anything narrower than that is ""narrow gauge"". One of the sects of model railroading that has been growing quite well is On30. This is O scale on HO gauge track, representing 30"" gauge prototypes  http://imgur.com/bBN0aUe  There is a photo I found in a quick Google search. Both of those engines are O scale, but the smaller one is On30, and obviously the equipment on narrow gauge lines is smaller, otherwise they could be quite top-heavy, as well as negating most of the advantages to narrow gauge.  http://imgur.com/h8eXcc8  To summarize: On30 is O scale, but runs on narrower gauge tracks, portraying narrow gauge prototypes. On30 is a particularly popular gauge (I personally plan to model in it once I have enough space) and even though it uses HO gauge tracks, it is still O scale.  Now for why I recommended looking at products marketed to On30 (or any narrow gauge O scale, for that matter). Narrow gauge is very much a ""special interest"" and generally only attracts experienced modelers. Because of this, companies producing products marketed towards narrow gaugers focus on realism. Most serious railroaders like to have realism and proper scale, so its a no-brainer for manufacturers to make higher-end scale models for narrow gaugers.  But since Lionel is dominant in O scale/gauge (at least in perception), and since their products are designed for children up to teenagers, the focus is not on realism but on functionality (e.g. animations, automation, etc.) and for functionality, they have to sacrifice being to scale. The rest of the market in O scale standard gauge has followed suit (except for those specifically marketing towards the shrinking scale-modeling O scalers)"

And I believe it was available in a regular production run later in LGB's life, either just before the bankruptcy or just after they were bought out.  The model number of that one looks like it was the collector's edition, which, in addition to the fact that it was made in Germany, should increase its value. I'm not sure of the differences between limited and production runs, aside from the model number, so hopefully the box is in very good shape.  The made in China model would probably get you between $800 and $1000 on eBay, depending on availability from other sellers.

modeltrains,2kmeki,PM_ME_YOUR_CHESTHAMS,2,Wed Oct 29 14:42:41 2014 UTC,"I guess I should clarify why I mean by ""crappy""  First, as kent_eh said, the accuracy and details. Many lower-end model trains have details that are significantly out of scale, because its a lot easier and cheaper for the manufacturer to mould large items than small ones. There are also many more details omitted, most commonly being small lettering on modern trains that on the prototype details safety information and capacities.  Second, are the motors in the engines. Sure, they work and run around the track, but these older, low-end engines tend to jerk a bit at very low speeds, if they go at low speeds at all, or even make some pretty annoying sounds. A high-end locomotive will be almost silent, and run extremely smoothly at all speeds, and often won't go as fast as the cheap ones because that high speed is unrealistic and dangerous for the engine.  Third, there's the functioning parts, like the trucks and couplers. All model trains, regardless of their quality, will derail and crash. The difference is how often they do this. Low-end model trains (both engines and cars) are made cheaply, and the manufacturer won't worry as much about making sure the wheels are perfectly round and the trucks free of ""flash."" They also often have couplers without springs, since those springs are a royal pain to add, but proper springs make for extremely reliable couplers.  Finally, there's adherence to the NMRA Standards. Nobody is required to build models to these standards, but doing so ensures a significantly better-running layout, because everything should be completely compatible. The naked eye can't really see whether or not the standards are met by a product, because it involves very small differences in size/weight (e.g. millimeters and grams) I think simply glancing at this page will illustrate why many manufacturers don't follow the NMRA standards to the letter.  http://www.nmra.org/index-nmra-standards-and-recommended-practices  For an overview of what these standards are and why they exist, see here: http://www.nmra.org/standards Just know that today, even though manufacturers may not follow the NMRA Standards, they do make a large effort to make their products compatible with those that do conform."

modeltrains,2kfdlw,ZebracakeDietPlan,3,Mon Oct 27 03:10:33 2014 UTC,New ties are generally a deep brown or brown/black color.  You can just go over the ties with a thin wash of the color and do it pretty quickly.  Once that's done you can use a small brush and paint the sides of the rail to kill the shine there.  Rails are usually a rust brown color (but not orange!)  Look at some real track it you have it close by.  Ties are anywhere from black to light gray depending on their age and location.  Rails tend to be a light brown on busy tracks because of fresh rust washing off the tops of the rail to a dark almost black rust on little used sidings and spurs.  When you're done run a bright boy over the tops of the rails to remove any paint there.

I have a Chessie GP40 that came with my EZ command and it is uuuugly. Oddly enough they started selling them again stand alone recently but for very cheap which isn't a bad idea giving how expensive things are today but they are fairly inaccurate  So that being said if there's something you wanna try on a decent engine but are worried of ruining it try it on the bachmann cause it can't really get any worse!  FYI not all bachmann's are terrible, I have a GP35 and GP7 that were actually fairly accurate and just needed detail parts."

modeltrains,2kb9e8,2manyProjects,5,Sat Oct 25 20:16:42 2014 UTC,"what is the difference in track codes?    Code of the track describes the rail height measured in thousandths of an inch.   Code 55 is .055"" tall. Code 80 is .080"".  That's literally the only difference.  Now, different brands might have slightly thicker ties, but a bit of sandpaper on the bottom of the ties can make them match exactly.   Since you tend to move frequently, have you considered going modular? There are standards for most scales which would allow you to join up with a club layout in the future if you decided to."
modeltrains,2kb9e8,kent_eh,2,Sat Oct 25 22:58:06 2014 UTC,"I was thinking about that, and initially I think I'll make a modular layout for myself, for ease of transport. I don't know what to do as far as track though, if I need to use segments or flexible stuff. I suppose I'll look up requirements for the modular thing and see what i can make of it. Thanks for the info"
modeltrains,2kb9e8,kent_eh,4,Sun Oct 26 01:15:29 2014 UTC,"I prefer flex.   One of the benefits of flex track is that there are less joins.   Another is that curves can be any radius you want, not just what is available in sectional track."
modeltrains,2kb9e8,quazax,2,Sun Oct 26 01:37:29 2014 UTC,A hollow core door is a good compromise between a true modular layout and a traditional one.  I installed folding table legs to mine.  It makes the layout height adjustable and if I need to I can fold the legs and rest it against the wall.
modeltrains,2kb9e8,PM_ME_YOUR_CHESTHAMS,2,Sun Oct 26 21:37:52 2014 UTC,"Someone correct me if I'm wrong as I'm only a noob too.  Depending on the make of track you use code 80 is a little higher than code 55. There are sometimes problems running older locos and cars on code 55 due to the differences in the top flange of the rail. Most newer stuff will run fine on both.  You say you want to run one train now, but when you get into it you will want to run more! I suggest going DCC straight off the bat. I highly recommend the NCE Powercab too. Very easy to set up and use.  What size layout are you thinking of?"
modeltrains,2kb9e8,PM_ME_YOUR_CHESTHAMS,2,Sat Oct 25 20:28:57 2014 UTC,"I was thinking of setting up something essentially modular, using quarters of a 4x8 sheet of plywood, not necessarily in normal configuration. It makes it more transportable than normal and can be reconfigured to make new layouts. I don't know whether a flexible track setup is better, or if I should use segments and make a layout that way."
modeltrains,2kb9e8,biosloth,2,Sun Oct 26 01:13:25 2014 UTC,I would suggest a standard 4x8 for your first layout. On both my layouts I've used flex track. Less joins in the track the better.  I highly recommend checking out the Model Rail Roader benchwork guide.I will post the link when I get home. Also head over to nscale.net great forum for n scale and someone will always have answers to your questions.
modeltrains,2k9ipj,Bleak_Morn,2,Sat Oct 25 05:02:47 2014 UTC,"I don't think you need to worry about cars rolling out of sidings unless you have a serious slope.  However, I do agree with you that sidings are usually lower than the mainline, so n-scale roadbed on the sidings would look pretty cool.  As for a vertical transition from one to the other, that's tough.  Are you going to use a belt sander held at a slight angle?  Cork doesn't cut very easily, and I suspect sanding would be even worse.  But the rule of thumb is that any grade should be 2% or less (slightly more is probably ok for a short transition like this), so measure the height change and calculate the distance you need.  But, any change in elevation creates a tiny kink in the rails.  In the worst case, the coupler from a car on the flat section can separate from the coupler on the car on the grade.  I would want to put the transition a bit further away from the switch than you have it, maybe a full car length.  Please take all the above with a grain of salt, as I've never tried what you want to do.  Good luck."
modeltrains,2k9ipj,reddRad,2,Sat Oct 25 07:03:21 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I plan on smoothing out the cork.  I always sand it enough to remove any imperfections and the photo is a rough ""before"" photo.  I think, to avoid coupler issues, I'll make a more gradual transition by adding N-Scale cork through the first turnout and maybe from there defend a little further as it goes down to the short siding.  I just really want to get the track down in the weeds without causing too many operational headaches.  Not sure if you're familiar with the track plan - but visual interest was added by adding slight elevation changes to the risers for each industrial spur.  Not sure how much that's likely to frustrate operations down the road though.  May be better just to leave everything flat."
modeltrains,2k9ipj,reddRad,3,Sat Oct 25 14:01:45 2014 UTC,"After replying last night, I thought of a better solution to making the transition than sanding the cork.  You could take a strip of balsa wood (or some other soft wood) and sand that down into a wedge.  Place that under the n-scale cork to make it rise up to the HO cork level.  I suspect soft wood will be much easier to shape than cork."
modeltrains,2k9ipj,BagOfBrokenBits,2,Sat Oct 25 15:26:15 2014 UTC,"As ReddRad has written I would  allow more space between the switch (= points in UK) and the start of the incline. Otherwise you are creating a likely trouble spot that will lead to derailing.  In the photo it looks like you already created a kink in the trackbed. I would sand by hand as much as is necessary to create the smoothest possible transition. You can sand cork when it's glued down with PVA. Careful work at this stage will save a whole lot of pain later.  When you ballast do a short section and put a weight on the track whilst it dries to keep the track conforming exactly to the change in grade, don't rely on track pins.  Best of luck. Don't forget to post pictures when it's done :-)"
modeltrains,2k9ipj,BagOfBrokenBits,2,Sat Oct 25 13:08:57 2014 UTC,Yep. I plan to smooth the cork with a surform tool followed by some sanding.
modeltrains,2k9ipj,kent_eh,1 point,Sat Oct 25 14:06:54 2014 UTC,Surform? really? That may be it bit coarse and tear it up.
modeltrains,2k9ipj,BagOfBrokenBits,2,Sat Oct 25 14:21:35 2014 UTC,That's for general shaping - then I sand it a bit after that.

I feel like if he was so quick to jump to and $800 offer, that he knows something that I do not. It was actually suggested that I take it to the pawn stars in Vegas, and see what they say, or see if he has a friend that can give more info.

Track is higher resistance than a copper bus wire."
modeltrains,2jtjml,kent_eh,2,Mon Oct 20 23:05:09 2014 UTC,"This is true with flex track, but not Sectional track. Sectional track you'll want to do feeders about every 10 feet."

modeltrains,2jtjml,Quasi_Evil,1 point,Tue Oct 21 00:00:17 2014 UTC,"My standard is 24AWG feeders at least every 6 feet, with a minimum of 2 feeders to any given section.  Those then are a maximum of 18 inches long, and run into 14AWG bus wires under the layout.  (Additionally, I never depend on power fed through a turnout - the inner two rails on the diverging end get feeders.)  However, I'm using all 3' flex sections, hand-laid switches and every non-insulated joint is soldered.  A good test is to drop a quarter on the track all around the layout.  If the booster shuts down quickly and reliably, then your wiring is adequate.  If it doesn't, it may not shut down in a short circuit and thus may melt/burn things."
modeltrains,2jtjml,PM_ME_YOUR_CHESTHAMS,1 point,Tue Oct 21 22:16:29 2014 UTC,It's really up to you. On my current layout I've opted for feeders on every piece of track. That should eliminate problems. So far I have only put feeders after any insulated joints and it seems to be running fine.

You'll have the old-guard, average age 67, and a handful of kids being brought in for Boy Scouts or assembling sets from circulation.  This is dangerous, because it tends to stratify the hobby.  If all your market is ""train set for the 9-year-old"" and ""retiree who can build the layout of his dreams with his finally cashed-in IRA"", the products and services available develop a huge gap-- anything suitable for people in the middle.  I feel like the disappearance of the traditional shake-the-box kits is a great example of this-- they were cheap enough that you could buy them and not worry about messing up too badly on a kitbash/superdetail/weather/paint job... which made them an excellent transition from an acquisition-driven hobby (collect hundreds of cars, run on the same circle of track) to a construction-driven one (building stuff yourself, blending stuff together, complex kitbashing, making a detailed and themed layout)"

Even during Christmas they only sell a few plastic sets. 20 years all, train shows had a lot of middle age men, as well as retired folk. Now its just the retired folk..."
modeltrains,2jox6e,fotbr,3,Mon Oct 20 11:11:28 2014 UTC,This is also a sign of the fall of middle class America. Most middle age men are having a hard time just getting by. No time &/or money for hobbies. The cars and planes are a little more popular since you can buy one set ($30-$50ish) and work on it for months to build it.

It might be worth the $5 - $10 to pick up their HO catalog as a reference for what's available and who makes it.
modeltrains,2jps60,fotbr,3,Sun Oct 19 21:13:33 2014 UTC,"Better yet, go to walthers online.  I've found most detail parts that I use come from Details West and Details Associates.  Some of the stuff you need might be sold out from Walthers might be available on ebay.   Some of the time, illustrations at walthers are poor and the same part on ebay might actually have a picture of the exact part you are bidding on.  You don't need much Special for your model.  This engine looks pretty vanilla EMD.  My shopping list would be lift rings (they are all generic), a weed cutter plow for the rear, a BN style plow for the front, a horn (I'm still no good at identifying the specific one), 3 cluster MU hoses, a trainline hose and pilot mount ditch lights.  You said you already have the grab irons."
modeltrains,2jps60,dakotabranch,3,Mon Oct 20 11:52:19 2014 UTC,"As far as the ditch lights go, how difficult would they be to hook up with dcc? This loco is currently dc with a dcc conversion in the near future."
modeltrains,2jps60,dakotabranch,3,Mon Oct 20 15:39:14 2014 UTC,"Depends on how good you are with a soldering iron.  If I were going to do the project, I'd get a Digitrax DH163 and wire headlights on the white and yellow wires.  Then I'd wire the ditch lights independently on the purple and green wires.  That way, you can program decoder to flash the ditch lights alternately.  For the bulbs, I'd probably use Miniatronix 1.5volt 30mA bulbs for the both sets of headlights and each ditch light.  PM me later if you wish and I can get you dropping resistor values.  If you don't use resistors, you'll blow the bulbs.  You might also be able to use surface mount LED's in this application.    Use the blue wire for common for all your lighting circuits.  Some very small heat shrink tubing would be very handy for this project also.  Be sure to take before and after pictures so we can see how ya did.  EDIT: flash alternately, not flash independently."

modeltrains,2jqu95,the11devans,6,Mon Oct 20 01:45:26 2014 UTC,"I'm going to say no, and I'll explain my answer. Track cleaning cars already exist and are plentiful. And you can run them in your consist with other cars. So you can just clean your track while you run a train. And being able to switch to multiple gauges would not appeal to as many as you think, as most people are dedicated to one gauge. Not to say that no one would use it but that it would appeal to a very small group."
modeltrains,2jqu95,MichaelArnold,2,Mon Oct 20 02:27:41 2014 UTC,"As above. I have mostly HO scale and some N scale. I already have track cleaning cars for both. Keeping cleaning cars for both scales around is not a problem. HO scale cleaning car: $19.99. N scale cleaning car $12.99. I've seen some European layouts that have both HO and HOe gauge on the same layout, that would be a very small market, and as mentioned it would not be a problem to keep a cleaning car for each guage.  As someone else mentioned battery/track powered hybrid could be usefull for cleaning tracks with really poor conductivity. Though on a small train layout a five finger locomotive would get you through a tough spot. On larger layout I've seen people use multiple locomotives to make sure the cleaning train doesn't get stalled on a dirty spot."
modeltrains,2jqu95,roborabbit,2,Mon Oct 20 17:36:50 2014 UTC,This. Hell I made some myself recently and they work wonderfully.
modeltrains,2jqu95,milkymoocowmoo,3,Mon Oct 20 07:15:58 2014 UTC,"I think the concept of ""battery powered"" is more of a play than ""multiple gauges"".  If you used track power plus a battery backup, it could be ran ""by itself""-- falling back to battery power when track is too dirty or oxidized to conduct reliably.  This solves some of the chicken and egg problem of ""I want to drag the track cleaning car around, but the track is too dirty to even run it reliably""  Multiple gauges might be more of a manufacturing convenience-- make it so a single SKU can be stocked, and the user can adjust it down to HO, TT, or N.  Practically speaking, I suspect that it will be difficult to support too-widely seperated gauges (i. e. No. 1 and HO) because the clearances on smaller gauges won't even admit something which will fit the larger one."

modeltrains,2jqu95,dwwojcik,3,Mon Oct 20 11:41:22 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think this one is going to cut it. Frankly, it seems like you're inventing a problem so that you can have fun with the solution.  A friend of mine went to a local railroad museum and restored their crossing shanty as his Eagle project. But, if you're like me, that's just too blue-collar to know what you're doing.  I'd say trawl through model railroad messaging boards and see if you can find a common issue. Maybe you can find a cheap alternative to some electrical component, like a low-cost low-skill throttle? Or perhaps a cheap, scalable system for controlling battery-operated trains?  My final tip is one that could potentially make a splash, although it isn't railroad-related. Many techies have the annoyance of wanting multiple audio inputs for one speaker system, but few exist and they're all in the $50 ea. price range. Perhaps you could figure out the wiring for one, with volume control for each channel, then release a tutorial with schematics and parts lists.

That way, if something goes wrong with the wiring, you can access it from below, and you end up damaging only a tiny bit of scenery.  Whereas in your case, to rip up those wires, you'll also cut a strip out of your scenery.  In addition, in your case, you now have wires sticking out of the edge of your layout.  Are you going to add a fascia around the edges to cover that up?"

You are only supposed to push the switch button for only a second, otherwise they will burn up.  If they are buzzing but not moving this will probably be caused by either something blocking the switch from sticking, a stray piece of foam shaving perhaps? if your track and the switch points are still buzzing but not moving then I would suggest taking apart the plastic housing surrounding the switch machine if you feel up to it.  I have had pieces of foam get inside the plastic housing and foul the mechanism that way or even get inside the solenoid motor and screw it up that way.  If it is all clear then maybe some VERY light oil or some graphite powder couldn't hurt.  Hope this helps!"

After that, get enough peco track to make an oval around your tree, probably $25, if you want some turnouts, $75. BAM, you have an awesome setup (e.g. every item is great) and you can totally integrate it into an awesome layout later.

As for Christmas trains.. I personally feel it should be a winter scene, so I took a white sheet and laid tracks over that.  Let me tell you, that is a very bad idea in N-scale.

Each train is individually addressed, so they run simultaneously. The street lights are 12v incandescent, and they can be controlled by an engine throttle to make them remotely dimmable. The houses were built by hand from the Cut & Assemble books (older ones were matte finish pages, look way better than new ones, which are glossy).  Here is a gallery of the board construction.

Track is glued to cork using craft glue, all track joints are soldered except one for expansion/contraction. Layout shows no signs of aging since construction in 2003."

modeltrains,2jhv49,marauder3058,4,Fri Oct 17 14:20:31 2014 UTC,I went with a NCE Power Cab pretty much right out of the gate. DCC is so worth the investment. I say it easier to start early.
modeltrains,2jhv49,capngrandan,3,Fri Oct 17 13:30:42 2014 UTC,I was a total newbie going into DCC after a few years of DC operations and the NCE Powercab has worked great for me so far. The instructions booklet you get with it is fantastic and easy to read. I can definitely recommend the Powercab as well!
modeltrains,2jhv49,garethashenden,2,Fri Oct 17 15:00:14 2014 UTC,"It's probably easier sooner. The more locomotives you have when you switch, the higher the initial cost as they'll all need decoders. Once you do switch the decoder cost can be factored into the purchase price of anything new. As for what system to use, it's kinda up to you. If you've got a bunch of friends who all use the same system then that would be a logical choice. If we don't consider the systems from Bachmann and the like, most manufacturer's systems will do most things. It's really down to how you like the interface. One of the entry level systems is probably best for now, Zephyr, PowerCab, etc."
modeltrains,2jhv49,MichaelArnold,1 point,Fri Oct 17 12:01:24 2014 UTC,"That's what I was thinking.  I have 3 locos that are real, and two older Bachmann locos that probably are not all that useful for a DCC layout unless I do some real work to make room for a decoder."
modeltrains,2jhv49,PM_ME_YOUR_CHESTHAMS,3,Fri Oct 17 14:21:57 2014 UTC,Whenever you need it really. Are you ready to run two trains at once? Do you have accessories that can be controlled by DCC? Do you want sound in your locomotives? If yes to any of these I'd consider the digitrax zephyr. Also remember that you locomotives will require a decoder as well.
modeltrains,2jhv49,popawell,2,Fri Oct 17 11:09:27 2014 UTC,I think the Zephyr it is!
modeltrains,2jhv49,Inconspicuousinky,3,Fri Oct 17 14:20:47 2014 UTC,"I have thr zephyr and a powercab and I would recommend the powercab over the zephyr. To me, it's easier to use, handheld, and seems to be of better quality."

modeltrains,2jhm28,Hawkeye_Pierce1952,11,Fri Oct 17 04:26:30 2014 UTC,"Model trains allow a huge range of personal preferences. Many simply want to build models, others want to build a replica of real life in miniature, yet others don't look for too much accuracy of appearance but want to form trains and run to a timetable.  Personaly I like to shunt wagons and build a train rather than spending too much time making sure the model grass is the correct height.  Each to his own, that's the beauty of model trains, have fun doing what YOU want to do."
modeltrains,2jhm28,quillsandsofas,3,Fri Oct 17 07:31:48 2014 UTC,"Personally I'm more for the realistic operations, but of course I also appreciate good modelling and visual design. I'm not from the US, but if you are, then I've heard good things about the special interest groups for operation in the NMRA, the opsig. Pretty sure you can find some operation-oriented people and layouts there."
modeltrains,2jhm28,reddRad,3,Fri Oct 17 08:16:58 2014 UTC,"I like to duplicate what I see in real life, which is long trains going through beautiful scenery.  Sadly, I've never gotten to see what goes on in switching yards.  However, operations/switching does sound like a lot of fun. I just don't know how to do it without it being so much work (timetables, waybills, etc, etc) that it would stop being fun."
modeltrains,2jhm28,dakotabranch,2,Fri Oct 17 16:07:19 2014 UTC,"Many modelers that operate don't actually have yards where trains are made up and broken down.  A train may come pre-made from staging, do its work in a few (or many places) and then disappear back into staging.  The best way to find out whether your like it or not is to try it on someone else's layout that already has it set up.  The NMRA group in your local area and NMRA's Opsig would be good places to start."
modeltrains,2jhm28,Trainguyrom,3,Fri Oct 17 19:07:10 2014 UTC,Nice timing on this topic! I just made a video as an assignment from school (I'm majoring in Visual Communications) about the operating sessions at a local home layout.  http://youtu.be/YTroXgz6os8
modeltrains,2jhm28,DaProf,2,Sat Oct 18 00:29:33 2014 UTC,That was very impressive ... good work!  Now do a series for us people stuck in areas where layouts like this are few and far far far between. I'd certainly like to learn how a operation session goes. Perhaps follow a single train from start to finish.
modeltrains,2jhm28,quazax,2,Mon Oct 20 01:53:48 2014 UTC,I enjoy operations.   You can do basic operating sessions at home using a small layout and car cards or switch lists.
modeltrains,2jhm28,kent_eh,2,Fri Oct 17 11:51:09 2014 UTC,"When I was a club member, I found a few guys who liked operations a lot more, but they didn't use the club layout (which was designed as a show display / constant running layout) for operating sessions.   The guys who liked operations did round-robin operating sessions on each other's home layouts.   When I was in a modular group, we did the constant running thing for shows, but we also had a few modules set up with customers to switch off the main line and passing sidings. Once we went full DCC, we could have a small regional switching job darting in-and-out of the mainline (dodging the thru trains) to service the various industries.  Another thing we did for fun at shows sometimes was to run a ""helper service"" on a ridiculously long mainline train. Picture a big steam loco on the front, 50-60 boxcars, another steamer as a mid-train helper, another few dozen cars, and a pusher back with the caboose. Different guys operating each engine (yay DCC!) and communicating speed changes with whistle signals (yay soundtrax decoders!).  Even though it looked like just a big train to most of teh spectators, it was a pretty solid challenge to operate."
modeltrains,2jhm28,Quasi_Evil,2,Fri Oct 17 19:43:30 2014 UTC,"I'm a prototype-focused operations guy myself.  To me, the point of the layout is to serve as a transportation system in miniature, and what I enjoy most is the movement of ""freight"" over the line in a manner as close to what the prototype would have done as possible.  Then again, I'm a railfan and historian first and a modeler second.  My layout was specifically thought out to model the key industries that source and sink traffic along the line, along with appropriate interchange.  I also run on a number of layouts, though, where the primary goal is to run trains.  They're no particular prototype and are built for scenic or modeling value.  Some of them are quite beautiful, but I've always found running on them to be non-engaging.  There's just something missing.  But then again, as many of said, different modelers derive enjoyment from a wide variety of aspects in the hobby."
modeltrains,2jhm28,costistoodamnhigh,1 point,Sat Oct 18 05:30:32 2014 UTC,"Wow, I wonder where you are located. I just want to have fun, no pun intended towards Madonna fans, but all of the clubs and interest groups here in my area want operations. They won't let you play unless you know the rules, so I just stick to myself with my own layout.   I would think most model railroad clubs would have a good share of members who are operator oriented. Even magazines talk about all the operators in clubs. I would just outright ask them who is into the operations side."
modeltrains,2jgfjm,MetalManic,3,Thu Oct 16 21:21:01 2014 UTC,"That's a cute little Marklin starter set. I think it would go for about $100 on ebay. Maybe just a little more if the box is in perfect condition.  If you need to find some comparable sets you could search through ebay for ""Marklin Starter Sets""."
modeltrains,2jgfjm,roborabbit,2,Thu Oct 16 21:50:59 2014 UTC,"Thanks. I paid $75 for it so probably not worth the effort. My wife likes building those Christmas villages during the season. Its missing a train. Heck, those Christmas sets are at least double $75 and lousy quality.  Sounds like a nice item to incorporate rather than sell. >That's a cute little Marklin starter set.

modeltrains,2jgfjm,capngrandan,2,Thu Oct 16 23:20:11 2014 UTC,"That's a great idea! Marklins are super high quality stuff (made in Germany). Just so you know, if you ever wanted to buy a different locomotive for that set you'll have to get another Marklin as they have a proprietary 3-rail AC system vs the 2-rail DC system we have here."
modeltrains,2jgfjm,roborabbit,3,Fri Oct 17 14:54:56 2014 UTC,Danke ( see what I did there? :)  )
modeltrains,2jfo6j,Jjjppp11,3,Thu Oct 16 17:27:26 2014 UTC,"If you're in the US, yes because pretty much any locomotive you can buy is DC (or DCC that can also run on DC). If you're in Europe there is also 3-rail AC trains (mostly Marklin brand). In that case you have to be careful.   In regards to DCC, once again if you're in the US look into getting one of the Athearn starter sets as I believe those locomotives come DCC ready (just need a decoder). If you want to get into DCC (which is worth while if you want to run 2 or more trains simultaneously), then you'll have to get a DCC setup. There are many starter kits for this including NCE Powercab (which is what I have and love), Digitrax and many others. There are tons of tutorials and reviews for all of them on YouTube. That, and everyone here is very helpful.   Before you get that financially invested in model railroading, I would suggest starting with a DC starter set and if you do indeed catch the bug and when you start expanding I would move to a DCC system."
modeltrains,2jfo6j,capngrandan,3,Thu Oct 16 17:37:02 2014 UTC,"The new train will run on the starter set. The one thing you might run into is the starter set transformer might not be enough if you go for long train of lighted passenger cars.  I haven't used DCC myself so I can't really help you there.  I have also just started the model train hobby a few years ago in O (Lionel,MTH). Hope everything goes well for you."
modeltrains,2jfo6j,webculb,2,Thu Oct 16 17:38:42 2014 UTC,"If you have the money, DCC as soon as you can. It's amazing.  If you have a permanent layout, that is."

modeltrains,2jdcn8,o_c_d,8,Thu Oct 16 00:11:33 2014 UTC,Scenario. Derailment in the tunnel. Ready? Go!
modeltrains,2jdcn8,billthethrill1234,7,Thu Oct 16 02:34:47 2014 UTC,"I'll just toss the layout in the fire and give up on model trains forever.   None of the foam is glued down yet, so what I was thinking is making a hole in the back, one that could be used to view the train as it goes through and that I could use to reach derailed or uncoupled cars.   I figured I would make it square and try to make it look like the inside of a real tunnel. The other option would be to have the third layer of foam, the one that covers the tunnel removable.   What would you recommend?"
modeltrains,2jdcn8,reddRad,4,Thu Oct 16 02:52:43 2014 UTC,"Most modelers like to have a removable piece of wood or foam painted black so that the tunnel is dark, but you can fix problems inside should a train derail or you need to clean the track.  Just remove the wood and you can access the track.  This is usually a little easier for other layouts that have the tunnel closer to the edge of the layout.  Perhaps set up a small armature inside to support the weight of the scenery in a way that takes up less space so that you can have a sturdy layout that is also easy to troubleshoot."
modeltrains,2jdcn8,Social_Hazard,2,Thu Oct 16 03:43:31 2014 UTC,"Yes, this is the correct solution, and exactly what I did.  Make at least two of those layers of foam removable near the edge of the layout.  You can completely leave it open, but then some light gets into the tunnel.  I'd just leave them there, but make them loose enough you can remove them easily."
modeltrains,2jdcn8,Social_Hazard,3,Thu Oct 16 04:17:37 2014 UTC,"I'm defiantly not going to tell you how to do things, but I learned to paint the Styrofoam first then lay the track, not only do your spikes sit better but then if you miss a spot with the ground cover it doesn't stick out. 2 or three shades of browns in latex house paint always did the trick.   How do you like n scale so far? I'm in ho but I don't have room for an ho layout, so i'm thinking of switching scales"
modeltrains,2jdcn8,brima,3,Thu Oct 16 04:22:15 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't ask for advice if I dint want it, so feel free to tell me how you would do it. I do plan on painting the foam first, with the exception of the pinned down track, nothing is locked in place.  I have boxes and boxes and boxes of HO stuff but no room to do a layout. I got almost all my HO stuff for free and there was a small box of n scale within in the boxes. I'm using this as a learning experience but I don't plan on sticking with N scale long term. The biggest thing against N for me is the cost. A lot of the n scale stuff is basically the same cost as Ho stuff, but because of the size is inherently more delicate.   On the other hand, there is something about the small size of everything that I find very attractive. The details that they manage even with the small size is pretty fantastic."
modeltrains,2jdcn8,billthethrill1234,0,Thu Oct 16 14:22:54 2014 UTC,I know what you mean. It kinda sucks because after 5 years of being in an HO club I had to leave. The leadership fell apart and things started getting stolen. So now I have a fair amount of nice equipment and nowhere to run it.  What really gets me about n scale is that i can build a pretty good sized layout in a room that would only be able to hold a tiny HO one. Now i just need to find a guy who wants out of n scale and do a trade!
modeltrains,2jdcn8,billthethrill1234,3,Sat Oct 18 04:34:32 2014 UTC,"Looking good.  Just to add one thing to the suggestions about the tunnel - in addition to having derail access, you'll want to make the tunnel wider on the inside of the curve.  While your current rolling stock will go through, if you decide to run longer cars - like passenger cars, or modern freight cars, they're going to over hang the inside of the curve.  Once you're an inch or so beyond the tunnel entrance, no one can tell how wide the tunnel is, so give your trains plenty of room in there."
modeltrains,2jdcn8,txelen,1 point,Thu Oct 16 19:46:54 2014 UTC,Yes. I picked up a bachman boxcar for 10 bucks at my hobbyshop and it fits through the tunnel. That was luck more than anything that it did.
modeltrains,2jdcn8,PM_ME_YOUR_CHESTHAMS,2,Thu Oct 16 23:41:54 2014 UTC,Looks like it's coming along! Maybe add another siding to allow for some more realistic running?
modeltrains,2jdcn8,capngrandan,1 point,Thu Oct 16 03:44:22 2014 UTC,"Yes, I was thinking of adding another siding to the existing one so that it will look like a tiny freight yard.   Is that what you meant or did you mean someplace else?"
modeltrains,2jdcn8,capngrandan,2,Thu Oct 16 03:50:46 2014 UTC,"I was thinking diagonally across the layout from that one to maybe simulate another industry or a small passenger depot, but the more the merrier ;-)"
modeltrains,2jdcn8,MichaelArnold,2,Thu Oct 16 04:02:24 2014 UTC,"First, kudos to you for getting around to doing this, I like to see a layout come together.    -I would install a second siding, a longer siding off of the opposite side of the oval.  You might want to relocate the lake to make room. Don't make it parallel to the existing siding, that will look weird, and put some buildings around it to keep the layout from looking too busy with track.  -I would include one of those road cross + re-railer combination sections of track."
modeltrains,2jdcn8,MichaelArnold,1 point,Thu Oct 16 06:40:46 2014 UTC,The retailer is on its way from model train stuff.   I am trying to minimize the amount I spend on this layout so I was going to skip the town. The thing you thought was a lake was going to be a large hill of small bluff. I was thinking of putting a farm  between that and the train track. I was thinking of attaching a siding to the existing one to simulate a small yard. That caboose will be weathered and then put into a graveyard type place
modeltrains,2jdven,thebellows,2,Thu Oct 16 03:16:06 2014 UTC,"Wow, lucky!  I must admit I was expecting to see a box full of old Tyco, Life Like, etc. near junk.  You have inherited some very good quality and quite valuable/collectible stuff there.  I'd start by checking the prices on MB Klein which is a large and popular hobby shop.  You can also look on Athearn's website but they only list MSRP which the items rarely sell for as they are usually discounted.  Some of those items are only produced in limited runs so you may have to look around a bit more for pricing.  Examples being the Athearn Turbine, the U50s, the Big Boy; The Broadway GG1, the Daylight GS4; The Kato CR SD80.  Good luck with the sale!"

I see that some have prices, most of those prices were MSRP and you won't get that price back but you should get 80-90% of that back if you sell them. Like Mock_Frog said this is worth a few thousand dollars, but if you are looking to sell I would go with the ebay route, usually whatever you sell there always ends up going for the fair market value.   I would also look at selling individually if you're up to the challenge cause it will be a lot of work. You have a lot of different trains spanning a large time frame so people may be hesitant to drop a ton of money for a wide variety of trains. Don't get me wrong if you sell this as one big collection you'll still get a lot of money but not as much."

Second, what else do you have on the circuit?  If there are accessories, powered switches, lights, and / or you're pulling passenger cars with pickups for interior lighting, you may be pulling more amperage than the circuit can handle (accessories, switches, and lighting should all be on at least one isolated circuit, if not one for each if you have a bigger layout).  I can't offer a whole lot on the subject as the layout I'm building isn't fully operational yet, but it'll have a pair of Z-4000s when all said and done, so this is certainly valuable information in the end."

modeltrains,2j85sp,77slevin,2,Wed Oct 15 09:37:07 2014 UTC,Prototype (in this context) is what the model is based off of. So an american prototype would be rollingstock/cars made in America.

modeltrains,2iv7z4,garethashenden,3,Fri Oct 10 20:55:10 2014 UTC,"If you model steam era you could potentially do some narrow gauge to get more trackage in, maybe a duel-gauge interchange? If you model diesel era, you can still get away with it as a tourist line or freight service in a particularly dense area. Traction is also nice and compact, and there you wouldn't have to bother with narrow gauge unless you want to.  However, for a traditional HO scale layout, you can still have fun. Just make sure that you have plenty of scenery obscuring your view of the layout. Model railroads always look larger if you can only see a small portion of it at one time.  There are also some ways to ""cheat"" space constraints. One is to have fold-out/clip-on bits that go off the edge so that while operating you have just that much more space for track, but you can quickly and easily get back to the original form factor for accessibility. Another is to do multiple levels. In 4x7 there isn't really space for a helix, but you can get away with a track in the back with a somewhat steep grade. Don't forget about staging tracks. You can have more trains hiding underneath the layout, although again you'll have the challenge of running tracks there.  One idea I have for hiding that incline is to have a track go into a tunnel, but disguise where the tunnel leads by strategically placing hills and valleys. To do this, you will want to make sure that ""sea-level"" isn't on top of the plywood but a few inches above it, because then you can do hills and valleys. Frankly, too many model railroads suffer from being built with the track being mostly one height and not having terrain sink much lower than that. When you just have the flat baseboard with hills on it, but virtually no valleys it really just looks toy-like.  You can easily build up the earth with Styrofoam and carve out all of your valleys, but be aggressive. If you end up with areas not quite right for tracks to sit on, you can build it back up with crumpled newspaper, straight plaster, or any of a number of other ways  Other ideas: Raise the mainline up around 1/8 inch for added realism, superelevate mainline/branchline curves ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cant_%28road/rail%29), super-detail EVERYTHING, scratchbuild as much as possible, crowd-source modeling projects (e.g. ask modeling communities to challenge you to build, model and implement something, or maybe a challenge to rebuild something) Create a blog or YouTube series involving creating the layout, experiment with micro layouts ( http://www.carendt.com/ ) etc."
modeltrains,2iv7z4,reddRad,2,Sat Oct 11 02:39:19 2014 UTC,I'd consider an L shaped layout. 4x7 but 2' wide or so. Something inner-city comes to mind. Lots a switching and street running. Obviously this won't work if you want somewhere to watch the trains go by.
modeltrains,2iv7z4,BobDendry,1 point,Fri Oct 10 23:01:34 2014 UTC,"I had a 4x8 HO layout as a kid.  It's fine.  One foot shorter won't make much of a difference.  You're not going to have a complex, interesting track plan, but if you focus on other aspects, like scenery, you can still have a lot of fun creating an awesome layout.  That said, I have since switched to n-scale, because I felt the more intricate track plans in the same space would hold my interest longer."

Im glad you could take something away from the pictures, there was a ton of testing done to get the rock looking right. Tree arrangement is something i feel is self taught, i have over fifty issues of modelrailroad magazine.. and dozens of books an they never explain good placement. I found starting at the back of the hill/mountain, and planting in sets of three, really helped bring out a solid look. And you nailed it! having a removable mountain scene is so nice in case of derailments and cleaning : )  Cheers"

Didn't want to lubricate it if there was an underlining problem.  I examined the motor more thoroughly and could see build up on the gears and moving parts. I used some WD-40 to clean off the build up and that seemed to work nicely. But the issues are still there

modeltrains,2i20nt,Jeff_Faust,2,Fri Oct 3 00:00:42 2014 UTC,"Bear in mind that coupling/uncoupling are that much more difficult on curves like this, so that's going to complicate switching. Before you build, it might be a good idea to mock up the sidings on a board (hold the track down with double-stick tape) to see how your equipment performs on it. If you find the yourself getting frustrated doing the kind of switching you'd like to do, you can reconsider before you commit track to permanant installation."
modeltrains,2i20nt,NSfoamer,1 point,Fri Oct 3 00:20:05 2014 UTC,"That's a very good point! I really like the idea of a branch that's climbs up to a mine/similar industry. Maybe I'll see if I can work a bit of straight track in there. Or maybe at least try to decrease the curve towards either end where coupling/uncoupling would be most likely. I think I'm going to end up using a lot more flex track than I have in the diagram. I had a hard time controlling the flex track in Railmodeller, so hopefully I can lay some down, play around, and find something that will suit my needs."

modeltrains,2i0nem,Underwoof,8,Wed Oct 1 19:07:26 2014 UTC,"Model railroading is an incredibly diverse hobby, ranging from extremely high-detail models like this http://imgur.com/I5bwJqF to more toy-like models like this http://imgur.com/wjcFqAX  I presume that he's building a layout of some sort, since he moved a pool table out, so he definitely isn't a hardcore collector. Hardcore collectors generally try to keep their models as original and pristine as possible, and thus don't run them. As with any functional object, usage, however careful, will inevitably break something or wear something out. However, many collectors actually run their collection, but their layouts are often set up and arranged to avoid most of this damage. http://imgur.com/vYF7cCp  But, if he's like most model railroaders I know, he isn't interested in collecting, so much as building. It involves taking off-the-shelf models and modifying them to fit your needs, and/or add/change details. This Reddit post has a nice mix of in-progress photos and images of completed areas www.reddit.com/tb/2hnwo1 If he falls into this category, but you haven't seen his layout, compare some of the work and tools to this free online magazine www.model-railroad-hobbyist.com  However, this is purely speculation, and it should be far easier to ask what his plans are. As has been mentioned before, offering to help build his layout would not only be a fantastic gift to him, it would also give you quite an experience. Generally, when someone gets help building a model railroad, it isn't to do all of the intricate detailing, but to help with larger elements. This is stuff like creating mountains, trees, rolling hills, or early on, just building the benchwork and laying track. Since model railroading has so many different aspects to it, the modelers almost always need help with skilled portions like wiring or building the baseboard (known as ""benchwork"") or painting the backdrops. These are skills that don't require model railroad experience, but just some basic knowledge, plus whatever skills you have.  Model railroading isn't about running a train around in circles making silly noises (although people can if they want to) its about building a miniature empire, building and fine-tuning intricate models, putting hours into detailing and customizing and even scratch building trains so that your miniature world can see movement and come closer to completetion.  Beyond all that phylosophical stuff, one other thing would be to ask him about magazine subscriptions. There are many magazines devoted to model railroading, and many of these are actually focused on a single subject or scale/gauge. Here are a few good examples:  http://mrr.trains.com/ http://www.rrmodelcraftsman.com/ http://www.ngslgazette.com/ http://www.on30annual.com/ http://www.nscalemagazine.com/ http://ctt.trains.com/  Again, before buying him a subscription, check with him to see what magazines he would like. For example, if he models Union Pacific in HO scale, he probably wouldn't be at all interested in the last four magazines I listed.  Finally, make sure he is aware of the NMRA (National Model Railroad Association) and if he isn't, I'd recommend paying for membership as a gift (assuming he lives within a reasonable distance of a division). www.nmra.org and for finding a division in your area: www.nmra.org/regions"
modeltrains,2i0nem,Trainguyrom,5,Thu Oct 2 04:25:11 2014 UTC,The scale is very important.  Try to casually inquire which he is interested in.
modeltrains,2i0nem,dwwojcik,2,Wed Oct 1 19:29:16 2014 UTC,Consider getting him something to decorate his train cave?  I agree with the others about you joining him in his hobby though. That would probably mean more than anything you could buy.
modeltrains,2i0nem,lazerusking,2,Thu Oct 2 02:33:01 2014 UTC,"If you are worried about purchasing the wrong gift, you could always buy him a gift card to a local hobby shop or hardware store. He would be able to purchase model railroading tools, or even a (electric) train. Good luck!"
modeltrains,2i0nem,_Aedifex_,1 point,Thu Oct 2 03:11:32 2014 UTC,Make sure to ask him what prototype he is modeling after ( area and railroad). Also ask him the scale. I would suggest on probably getting him rolling stock as he may want certain engines.

It's an older cheaper set by Bachmann with the Rapido style couplers but is fine for a beginner just getting their feet wet. If you go for it make them test it for you to show it works before you buy. If the engine stutters and doesn't run smoothly I'd say you should walk.
modeltrains,2hyghg,bryguy23,2,Wed Oct 1 06:18:49 2014 UTC,Not really. I actually bought the same one in February for $40 at a train show. It's a nice starter set.
modeltrains,2hyghg,Trainguyrom,1 point,Wed Oct 1 10:41:10 2014 UTC,"Honestly speaking, that equipment is crap. Old Bachmann N scale products are dirt cheap, but have very little detail and run fairly poorly. They do work, but if you really get into the hobby, you should definitely consider replacing the rollingstock with something better.  Atlas tends to be a great choice for balancing quality with price, and Micro Trains is widely considered to be the very best. Bachmann's N scale has improved a bit over the last twenty years or so, but its still fairly low end stuff. However, Bachmann has a product line called ""Bachmann Spectrum"" which provides significantly better-quality products at a decent price. Spectrum is comparable to Atlas in quality, in my opinion.  But for your question on price, $40 for that is pretty much normal. I see sets like that in that price range at train shows all the time, and they're often in roughly the same apparent condition. Just remember: you get what you pay for.  Oh, one last brand comes to mind: Kato. In terms of quality, they're somewhere between Atlas and MicroTrains, but sometimes only on par with Atlas."
modeltrains,2hyghg,Trainguyrom,1 point,Fri Oct 3 03:07:42 2014 UTC,"To clarify:  Bachmann Spectrum products are good quality, but they cost more than regular Bachmann. Always be wary of regular Bachmann products, since they're generally pretty low-end, plus the old Bachmann N scale is pretty crappy.  And to define ""crappy,"" it basically means that the details are poor (out of scale and/or completely missing, and often obviously plastic that is mass-produced with little quality check) the working parts are often deformed slightly causing more derailments and less smooth rolling, and for engines, they just have a cheap motor that won't move slowly well, will require a high level of maintenance if you actually want to keep it running (fairly) reliably (btw, not worth it), as well as being loud and rough  And then there's the couplers... In N there are two types of couplers you'll most-likely encounter: ""knuckle"" and ""Rapido"" Knuckle couplers are the way to go, since they are realistic, more reliable and closer to scale. Rapido couplers are these ugly square brackets that just look like crap. These two types of couplers don't work together, although you can make a ""conversion car"" which has Rapido at one end and a knuckle at the other.  Knuckle couplers are also often called ""KaDee,"" referring to a well-known and respected manufacturer of the couplers."
