beyondthebump,3e2g33,pandadipose,10,Tue Jul 21 13:09:38 2015 UTC,They're usually cam girls or the like. They use whatever hashtags they can to get views so they can direct people to their site or whatever. Lots of hashtags are abused that way.
beyondthebump,3e2g33,gryffinwhore,3,Tue Jul 21 15:17:59 2015 UTC,I just report all of them. It feels like they are body bragging to moms ugh
beyondthebump,3e2g33,drewlb,5,Tue Jul 21 15:30:17 2015 UTC,"When you report everything, you basically fill the system w/ ""spam"" reports. I'm using the term ""spam"" because you are reporting things just because you don't like it. It is not kiddie porn or hate speech, or death threats. It's just content that meets the sites TOS, but which you (and yes, probably most people) dislike with. BUT, you are consuming resources and taking away the ability to deal w/ the serious stuff. Radio Lab did a good show that touched on this at Facebook. http://www.radiolab.org/story/trust-engineers/   Edit: I stand corrected, I guess I was thinking tumblr. If nudity is a TOS violation then I guess it would be fine to report, but I'd personally stay w/ the ""use reporting sparingly for egregious violations""."
beyondthebump,3e2g33,bonjourtabby,7,Tue Jul 21 16:40:52 2015 UTC,I didn't think nudity was within the TOS for Instagram.

Step 3) Come back in a few minutes when you've collected and regrouped, then begin the process of soothing your infant again.  Diaper, feed, sleep.  Diaper, feed, sleep.  This is your mantra right now.  Repeat until you're sick of it, but basically as soon as he wakes up from a nap you should be aiming to get him down again for another nap.    As far as stress and frustration, I played music that made me calm and happy, watched tv shows while I was walking around with him.    Stay calm, but don't be afraid to put the baby down and walk away for a few minutes.  Ask for help if you're alone all day, see if your neighbor can come over and keep you company for a bit."

It's kind of expensive (we were lucky enough to have a friend let us borrow hers).  He also really loves this - the shapes at the top pull off, so he will sit and play in front of it, then try to pull himself up with the shapes.  My mom got him this for his crib.  He loves to wake up to it!  I have to get him up at 6am every weekday, so if he's in a deep sleep, I find that if I turn this on after I've woken him up, it distracts him from being so angry about being woken up, lol.  I also got this from my shower, and he loves it as well.  Always buys me a few minutes of play time in the crib while I go pee/throw clothes in the laundry/etc.  Besides the toys, he has mostly been about having me walk him around, and having me stand him in front of our living room window so he can look out and play with my curtains, lol."

There was no conclusion on how the white noise affects hearing, development, or speech because no babies were involved in the study (pesky ethics and all)."

I switched to swimming and elliptical. It really continued to bother me all throughout my pregnancy. Literally the day after I had my son it was 75% gone. Now I'd say it's about 90% gone.

So in my eyes you have 4, maybe 5 options.    Dont pay the nanny, keep the kid in a public place like a library, and make everyone miserable. Or take baby to a daycare and pay them and still make everyone miserable.  Pay the nanny, but still take care of the kid yourself or ask the nanny to tolerate doing her job in a public place all day.  Ask the nanny to take the kid to his/her house for the week unsupervised by you, which could be weird.  Ask the nanny if you and the kid could come to her house each day for the week and offer a bonus for the trouble. Which could also be weird, but hey, if she is watching your kid it might be nice to know what she lives like anyway right? And you can try to run errands and stuff to limit your time there.    honestly I think asking the nanny to crash at her house during the day is probably a huge request, but it might be your best option and if the nanny ends up making some extra bonus $ on it then she will probably oblige."

My 2 year old has some 24 month stuff and some 2t and they fit her similarly but the 2t is a little bigger.   But it also depends on where they're from. Different brands also are different sizes.

The good differences: I sleep better, am generally happy, have more patience, and see things in a positive light. I'm always in a good mood so it's helped me perform better at work, stick to my budget, and motivate me to do my school work. All in all I feel like a different person.  The bad side effects: The first week or so it made me really sick. Decreased libido. The first 2-3 months were the worst, I really had no sex drive and its really hard to orgasm. It seems that the past month it has gotten a bit better. I think my change in mood means more to him than sexy time, though.  Overall I give Zoloft a thumbs up.

But I have literally 0 sex drive. It doesn't have to be forever though, so I would  say get yourself feeling better first.  This time I only got bad side effects for a few days when I started taking it but the first time I felt crappy for a few weeks. I got shaky and felt like I was going to throw up and I twitched loads.

I told him that I care enough about our relationship to try to change my habits, and he can decide whether or not he cares enough to change his.   We also discussed our roles with our son Isaac and how to make that situation fair. I'll be leaving my job in the next week or so, so I'll be home with the baby all day and I know it wouldn't be completely fair of me to just drop the baby on him as soon as he gets home from his full time job.

beyondthebump,3e0i1q,briliantlyfreakish,5,Tue Jul 21 00:39:46 2015 UTC,We tried our lo out in the front section of the travel system stroller just after 4 months. We took her for a walk around the neighbourhood and watched as she looked allllll around. We would go up ahead and look back at her and she would be all smiles. She loved it! However we are very careful to not tip sideways over a curb or go on bumpy paths yet. She's only 4.5 months now. It's nice that we know she can enjoy the scenery instead of staring at us the entire time. She does that all day long!

When they were tiny we put the head support from the car seat in the stroller. Once they were 4 months or so we took it out.   If your stroller doesn't recline much then it's probably best to wait until they are sitting up and aren't going to slump down.

I also always burped him, even when he fell asleep nursing because if I didn't try he would usually spit up. At that age he would either stay asleep or quickly fall back asleep.   I've been told that if their poop is mucousy then it's something from your diet. Not sure if this is true, but I can definitely tell if DS doesn't like something I'm eating. In addition to eliminating dairy, are you eating clean? Like no processed foods, lots of fresh foods, no fatty meat, etc? If I have a lot of oil or fat I can see it in DS's poop. I made olive-oil poached fish one night and the next day his poop was green and smelled EXACTLY like my dinner."

My kid skipped right over the puree baby food and eats gently mashed or torn food.

She'll get solids for breakfast (8:00am) and then for a snack at around 11:00am.  She'll take a bottle at around 10am, 12p and 3p.  If she wants a fourth bottle it's usually at around 5p.  I also nurse on demand at home, so she'll eat another 5 times throughout the night.    She wants to eat everything I am, so if I eat dinner when she is awake, I'll give her a little bit.

I don't mind because while it's important for him to get his liquids in the form of milk, he has to learn how to use a cup in order to move up to the toddler room later. And I sure wouldn't want to waste all that breast milk on his shirt and bib, and getting thrown on the floor.  I aim for dinner to happen every night, but sometimes with traffic and such, it's just too late and he's too tired. Bedtime is 7:30, and if I don't get him in the chair by 6:45, I'll skip food and just nurse him."

We switched my son to those at bedtime, and that completely solved our sleep issues (he was also waking up because his diaper was full and uncomfortable). We weaned him off of the bottle right around 13 months, so my situation with him is a little different (he is currently 16 months), but we also don't usually have drinks available for about 45 minutes to an hour leading up to bedtime (7:30). It's just a routine we got him into, and it works really well. If we let him have something after that cutoff (which does happen, of course) I can almost guarantee he'll leak through his overnight diaper and wake up in the morning with soaked sheets."

I also cut him off the bottle on his first birthday and got a rubber nippled sippy cup to help him transition. Now as long as the last thing that he drinks before bed is milk he's a happy camper.

beyondthebump,3e1ov7,SouthgateJenny,3,Tue Jul 21 07:49:15 2015 UTC,"You're only 4 days postpartum -- it's very common to produce a lot (and to leak a lot) the first month postpartum. This WILL level off. Some moms just start freezing this surplus for rainy days in the future; I produce extra but even now there are days where I'm not making that much to pump.  But what I can say is that I didn't have pain. I sometimes get ""blocked up,"" so to speak, and have to take a hot shower or massage to loosen it up.   If that relieves the pain, it's a good thing. Pumping every 2 - 3 hours at this point isn't ridiculous, either. If the pain continues, call for help. If you're not having pain and you can survive the pumping at this stage, go for it.   But at this point, because you aren't also nursing, 15 oz.+ a day is not absurd. Some moms only make 20 oz. a day, some may make more than 40."
beyondthebump,3e1ov7,dalikin,5,Tue Jul 21 14:58:08 2015 UTC,"Hi :) For engorgement when your milk comes in (which is what is happening to you) you actually need to express very little rather than emptying your breasts fully. Every time you empty them you actually encourage them to produce more. Continue to feed your baby on demand but don't pump every 2/3 hours. Just express out just enough to relieve a little of the discomfort. For me that was only about 10ml, but for you that might be  more as you are already overproducing. If you are currently getting out 15oz a day, you need to dial it down - so let's say you express 2oz per session, from now only take out 1oz. Then tomorrow start taking out only 0.5oz. This will signal to your breasts that you have too much milk. If your breasts are left 'full' it tells your body ""The baby is not drinking this milk, stop making so much!"". If you take all the milk out your body thinks ""Baby is hungry, I need to make MORE!"".  During this process you will need to feel your breasts carefully, looking for any lumps and bumps. If you feel any hard lumps focus on those areas and massage them while you express out the milk. If at any point you notice any wedge-shaped redness radiating from the nipple/areola you may have mastitis (it can happen when you get very engorged) and if you see this go to the doctor straight away as they will need to give you some antibiotics.  Use heat (hot shower, warm facecloths) to relieve discomfort as well as cold stuff.  Also (this sounds like some weird old wives tale but it actually works) buy a whole cabbage and put it in your fridge. Pull off whole leaves and stuff one leaf in each bra cup. You can use green or red cabbage but red may stain your clothing, so green is preferable. Swap out the leaves once they get warm. You'll smell like cabbage but the engorgement will fade quickly with the use of the cabbage leaves, and the coolness of them will help the pain.   I hope this helps!   Take ibuprofen a couple of times a day to relieve the pain also. It should subside within a few days.  Let me know if you have any questions."
beyondthebump,3e1ov7,dalikin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:47:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not able to nurse as my son is still in the hospital, so I've just been trying to pump every 2/3 hours so I can keep feeding him once he comes home. I am freezing everything I pump right now."
beyondthebump,3e1ov7,Brolee,2,Tue Jul 21 07:51:14 2015 UTC,"Ahh okay that makes sense! In that case, just do the other things (heat, cabbage, ibuprofen) and try to just pump a consistent amount each day (e.g. 15oz) to help regulate the supply. The supply will regulate once you get into more of a routine and are consistently taking out a similar amount each day. You can build on it from there as your baby gets older - remember, if he needs more add more pumping sessions or feed him more often to boost your supply, and pump/feed less to reduce your supply. 15oz is great for having a new baby. You are doing a great job, and the engorgement will subside in a few days :) Just do keep an eye out for the mastitis as it can knock you around really badly if you get it."
beyondthebump,3e1ov7,dalikin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:54:50 2015 UTC,Thank you for the responses. I'll try the cabbage leaves to help with mastitis if these gel packs don't work.

beyondthebump,3e1ov7,katkatkatkat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:57:10 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to add that if you use the cabbage leaves, use a rolling pin to crush the veins in the leaves before using."
beyondthebump,3e1ov7,Just_Move_Out,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:41:10 2015 UTC,"Sorry, the cabbage leaves are to help with the engorgement, not mastitis. Mastitis needs to be dealt with by a doctor. If you use the cabbage leaves it can help to reduce the amount you produce so try using the cabbage leaves ASAP and see if it helps before you try reducing the amount you pump by pumping less. That sentence is a bit confusing but I hope it makes sense.   If you do go ahead with reducing the amounts you pump, just please please keep a careful eye out for lumps/bumps and redness, as mastitis is basically when you get a blockage from milk just sitting there and it causes an infection, and it is no fun!

beyondthebump,3e1ov7,MrsCrapnapkin,2,Tue Jul 21 12:44:34 2015 UTC,"I remember this feeling, it's terrible.  Engorgement can be brutal.   My best piece of advise is :  Let them drip!  I've heard that dripping is the only way to decrease pressure in your boobs, but also not be sending the signal that they should be making more milk.  It was gross, but I just wore a loose t-shirt and no bra - and I dripped all over the place.    Right now, it probably feels like it will last forever, but I promise it won't.  It will only be a couple of days, and then your boobs will get the message that they're making too much milk. You're doing the right thing: Warmth, massage while nursing/pumping, ice.  Wait. Repeat.    Make sure you aren't pumping too much - I'm not sure how much a newborn eats in oz, but try to pump exactly that amount."

I ended up using the k'tan for the first 6 months and then switched to the ergo. I still use the ergo baby daily. My son gets overheated very easily. I never got the ergo baby insert because of him overheating. The kangaroo hold with the k'tan is easy to do once you get it down. I had to watch the videos repeatedly. The ergo baby is much easier to use down the line.
beyondthebump,3e06oj,manyvests,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:12:57 2015 UTC,I have the boba air and gave been using it with my 5 month old for about 2 months. It says not to use it until they weigh 15 lbs but I have a tall light baby with excellent head control so I use it already.

beyondthebump,3e06oj,mediocrity511,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:33:19 2015 UTC,I've not seen anyone mention the Connecta Solarweave yet. It's a soft structured carrier in a special lightweight fabric that's also uv resistant. Comes in some lovely colours as well. At my local babywearing group it's very popular and everyone tries to hire the one from the sling library when they're off on holiday!

I live in Florida and the heat index has been well above 100 everyday for over a month, so I know the heat struggle. The best carrier I have is my Tekhni with Repreve. We can take a stroll in the middle of the day and she doesn't get a single drop of sweat on her. And I love how versatile wraps are, so many different ways to carry! Wraps are great for babies of any size, newborn to toddler.  I've heard great things about lillebaby airflow! You might have to put a receiving blanket under his bum since he's so little, but I'm sure he would grow into it in no time.  All in all, I highly highly recommend the Tekhni wrap. It's a bit pricy but you will be able to use it with your son for YEARS. The repreve blend is made of some sort of black magic and really is such a blessing for those hot summer days."

beyondthebump,3e06oj,OryctolagusCuniculus,0,Tue Jul 21 06:01:37 2015 UTC,"I can highly recommend a Ktan-style carrier. My baby sweats a lot and we have used them since he was born, and are still using them at 21 lbs. We use it for hiking, doing yard work, breastfeeding, really anything.   It is three pieces - two loops (like infinity scarves) and a sash to tie around. When it's hot you can just use the two loops and skip the sash. Like this, but don't do step 6. http://www.babyktan.com/hug.html (On the website they say ""sash must be used"", but we do not use it because it is stable enough without)  If you're like me and don't want to spend $50 on two loops of t-shirt fabric, you can easily sew them yourself in less than 15 minutes. I can link a tutorial if you want."

Don't like that book? Burn it. Can't stand it when that chair acts up? Put it in storage. Or, wait. Burn that too. Good riddance.  Done? Good. Now look around the things that make you happy, calm, relaxed, or just content to be alive. A great TV show, one particular blanket, that exact spot on the couch. These are now your staunch allies in the war on stress and sleep deprivation. Yes, delivery pizza and cookie dough ice cream is included. We're all friends here.  Order your stuff online, pay the ridiculous shipping fee. Shamelessly ask your parents / brother / neighbour to pick stuff up for you. Yes, that includes that creepy dude with the weird dog. He's fine.  A decked-out changing station is not only fun to build, but the only thing that stands between you and catastrophe. Redundancies for everything that can get soiled. This definitely includes your own clothes -- and don't you dare say ""I'll just wash them often."" That road leads to madness. Also, if you don't have at least three trashcans in every room, you're going to wish you had.  If you're part of the Formula Club, get more bottles. No, I know you have like a dozen of them. Get more. You do NOT want to have to clean a bottle in the middle of the night to the sound of the third aria of Infantia Dramatica.  With all this said, I wish you welcome to the show that never ends."

Then his startle reflex kicked in and he started waking himself up constantly. between the internet and Happiest Baby on the Block, I was convinced to give swaddling another try.   He hated it for two days. And then it turned into a 'time to go to sleep now' switch. Now I'm dreading have to give it up when he starts rolling over.   We use the halo swaddle sacks and love them."
beyondthebump,3dyrem,aerrin,3,Mon Jul 20 20:24:36 2015 UTC,"Let me say that the velcro swaddlers are not NEARLY as good as The Miracle Blanket. That thing is absolutely amazing.  Personally, I am an extremely tight swaddler with just a regular swaddle cloth, but the Miracle Blanket is even better because the removable foot pouch thing allows you to change diapers WITHOUT removing the swaddle! It's incredibly great.  Also, I would 100% recommend getting the Happiest Baby on the Block DVD. The book is fine, but the DVD is 50x better. We've followed that man's suggestions religiously and our baby is an incredibly happy girl, great sleeper, and barely ever cries at 6 weeks.   If we DON'T swaddle and soothe, she's a fussy, inconsolable mess. Seriously -- baby magic."

(I found this much better to use when he was little than the boppy) Velcro swaddle me blankets   Now that he's older I still use most of this except we switched from swaddle me blankets to halo sleep sacks with the Velcro swaddle (more leg room for him to kick as he pleases)  We now use the boppy pillow instead of The breast friend. Also great for tummy time.   He is in the ergo more than the ktan but I still use the ktan  He sleeps in the pack and play at night instead of rock and play but still uses rock and play for naps.  He is always playing on his activity mat when awake. Either on his back swatting at toys or tummy time trying to learn to roll over.

If not, we got an Infantino one that's about $30 on Amazon. Our son is 8 months old now, and we still use it all the time! SwaddleMe wraps. I could never get the hang of swaddling, and even when we could, it was never tight enough for our Hulk baby to keep him contained. A drunk baboon could swaddle your baby in these. Several different types of bottles. Our son was hella gassy in the first 5 months. Like, man farting and screaming gassy. He didn't eat from a bottle much, while I was on leave, but every time we went anywhere, someone always wanted to feed him. We got Avent bottles as a gift, and he didn't do well with them. We then tried a Munchkin Latch, which made him projectile spit up. Finally, we broke down and spent the money to get Dr Brown bottles. Yes, they're a pain in the ass to clean. Yes, they leak when they flop around in the diaper bag, but, oh my god, they're amazing!! He had issues latching on at first, since we got the skinny ones, but now they have the wide-mouth kind, and they're great.   Good luck with your little one. Those first few months are crap, but just try to enjoy the tiny happy moments so you have something to look back on.

I strongly, STRONGLY recommend you familiarse yourself with the signs and what it looks like as it can really screw up breastfeeding, your baby's latch, your baby's weight, your nipples, and all manner of fun things. If you are breastfeeding, watch some videos on how to get an effective latch or take a quick session at a health clinic--I found this helped me immensely! Also, start using lanolin at about 37-38 weeks. Use it daily before bed to help your nipples prepare for breastfeeding, then use it every. single. time. after you feed. It's totally safe for baby."

beyondthebump,3dyrem,skunka,2,Mon Jul 20 20:59:48 2015 UTC,"That's not actually reflux. Babies have an immature sphincter at the top of their stomachs which causes them to regurgitate food regularly (hence the need for lots of burp cloths!). Totally normal and causes a mess but no pain/discomfort for the baby. Acid reflux is usually caused by an overproduction of stomach acid and is painful/uncomfortable for the baby, especially when laying down flat. It's not very common but the poor babies who have it do have a rough time."

I initially wanted my son to sleep in his crib in his room, but it made me extremely anxious for months. So, overnight, he slept in a pack n play in our room. He loved his bouncer, but I only discovered the Rock n Play after he was too big for it and damn I was sad about that. It would have been awesome. Anyway. A video monitor helped save my sanity as I could check on him and make sure he was breathing without disturbing him. We use Summer Infant Wifi and LOVE it. We even travel with it. If you're really anxious, you can get things like the Oma baby monitor which clips onto their diaper and monitors their breathing. If breath halts for 15ish seconds, an alarm sounds.  We had a little diaper pail to start, but when breastfeeding poops stopped, the plastic absorbed the smell and his room stunk. It was gross. We use the Ubi which I love and it contains the smell.  Lots of changing pad covers and mats. We bought Kushies which we put overtop of the changing pad and cover so we can toss the Kushies change mat without changing the cover as often.   Crappy washcloths for quick mop-ups, especially if you're having a boy. You will get peed on.   We bought a Twilight Turtle so I could flip it on and see him if I needed to pick him up or soothe him in the night without fully disturbing him.  Lots of snacks.   My brest friend nursing pillow, tuck's pads for your lady bits, a donut pillow to sit on, lots of deodorant or Kleenex refresh wipes for you. You will sweat buckets. Zip up baby PJs.

Boppy, water bottle, remote control for Netflix, and maybe some snacks I can eat with one hand were necessary especially those first few weeks during clusterfeeds.   Also, a lot of baby stuff is unnecessary but a changing table is important if you value your back. I have diapers, butt paste, wipes in the warmer, and little washcloths all stocked there with the diaper pail right there. It makes it so easy and it is so nice to not have to search for your supplies when the baby needs changing. Oh, and the wash cloths there are for drying his butt after wiping or he gets a rash.

He still loves it at 6 months since now he knows how to bounce himself and he thinks it's fun.  2) Halo Bassinest - Not cheap, but particularly post c-section (which I didn't expect to have) this thing was amazing.  I could swivel the baby over to get him out to nurse without getting out of bed, and climbing in and out of bed was one of the most painful motions.  The vibration feature was also pretty awesome.  3) Halo sleepsack swaddles.  We've swaddled him arms bent, arms straight, one arm out, both arms out, depending on what he liked at the time.  Very versatile.  4) Playmat.  He would lie under there and stare at the toys and give me a break.  Now I lay him there for tummy time so he doesn't spit up on my carpets, lol.  5) Good nursing bras.

I'm not worried about SIDS because theres nothing in her crib that would suffocate her and her head control is great, I would just LOVE if she could figure out how to get back because she hates being on her tummy. She went from waking up once a night to eat, to 3 or 4 because she ends up on her tummy. I can't just roll her back and she's good. I have to sit and rock her for a while to get her back to sleep."
beyondthebump,3dzw8a,mbecksd,5,Mon Jul 20 21:49:03 2015 UTC,"Your best bet is a medication called comfortis. It's a pill that you can give the dogs (I believe the cat too) which kills any fleas on them and then kills any fleas that bite them for a month afterwards. My dog was literally CRAWLING with fleas last summer, and the house was full of them. You could see fleas hopping up out of the carpet. It was horrible. But within 2 weeks of giving him the medication there were no fleas on him, and no fleas in the house!!"
beyondthebump,3dzw8a,electric-bones,4,Mon Jul 20 22:08:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, please get an actual flea medication for your pets.  We use Advantage now as Frontline stopped working for us last year.  We have carpet almost everywhere and resorted to using diatomaceous earth to fully rid our house of fleas that a lovely family of foxes infested our yard with. This is dangerous to inhale so be sure to use it correctly.  Also, Dawn dish soap is one of the best things to kill fleas, so if you find a flea, be sure to immediately drown it in a cup of water with Dawn.   You can also wash your pets with it, but it tends to dry out their skin so I would do that sparingly."
beyondthebump,3dzw8a,puckbunny51,2,Mon Jul 20 23:22:39 2015 UTC,"Frontline also stopped working for us! Advantage saved the day. Plus with Advantage you can treat the animals every 10 days until the infestation is under control, unlike frontline where you have to wait the full 30 days between treatments."
beyondthebump,3dzw8a,Bmorehon,3,Tue Jul 21 16:35:31 2015 UTC,"Our vet said that Frontline hasn't changed their formula in a really long time and that fleas just became immune to it over time. We also used Advantage more frequently to get the problem under control.   Our vet said it was unnecessary and wasteful,  but it made me feel like we were doing more."
beyondthebump,3dzw8a,puckbunny51,3,Tue Jul 21 23:35:11 2015 UTC,If you use food grade diatomaceous earth it's not dangerous - just messy and sort of sucky (although it definitely does the job!).
beyondthebump,3dzw8a,sunnygator,3,Mon Jul 20 23:39:03 2015 UTC,Any fine particles are more or less dangerous to inhale and can be irritants especially for babies and people with respiratory problems.
beyondthebump,3dzw8a,fluffmama,2,Tue Jul 21 04:18:57 2015 UTC,"I guess dangerous is a relative term. Here is some good information about DE. It should go without saying that you shouldn't blow a bunch of it in your kid's face, but compared to a lot of other things (including polluted air in major cities that are filled with babies who travel down streets filled with gas fumes), this probably isn't the worst. Especially for temporary flea treatment. Especially compared to chemical pesticides.  Having used the product, it's pretty easily cleared from the air in a few hours. You can take the baby out of the house while you apply it and once it's settled and you've vacuumed and dusted it should be good to go."

beyondthebump,3dzw8a,albertparsons,2,Tue Jul 21 00:57:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm in the same boat right now. Six cats (indoor only) and they caught their annual case of fleas. We give Comfortis to the two (sometimes three) cats that will eat it with their wet food and a topical on the rest. We had to do it this past weekend. We just sequestered the cats into separate rooms for the day so that the baby couldn't touch them and they couldn't lick the topical off of each other before it had a chance to spread.   Go to your vet and get a flea treatment from them. They'll know which ones will actually work in your area. You'll need to use it for the next three months, minimum. (Allegedly, the Seresto flea collar is actually pretty good, but I'd be worried about using it around the baby.)  You'll also need to wash anything your pets sleep on in the hottest water the materials can stand. Do this every 2-3 days for at least the next few weeks. Then, vacuum every day and empty the canister or throw out the bag outside, every time. The fleas don't die in the vacuum like other bugs & spiders do. The eggs will just hatch in there & they'll hop right back out into your house.  Also, don't bother with the flea dip for your pets (especially your poor cat). The bath only kills what's on them right then, if you're lucky, and doesn't have any lasting effect. As soon as you put them back out into the house where the fleas are, the fleas jump right back on your pets."

If you do that, I would suggest a drastic change (at least 9:30pm), at least for the first two days. Otherwise baby will wake early out of habit and be very cranky.

beyondthebump,3e0ljq,whiskeyjane45,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:40:02 2015 UTC,"2-3 extra oz is more than plenty if you're already nursing on demand! So far I've used both Target and Lansinoh brand, about 80 bags from each brand. I haven't had a single leak. One tip that helps me with transferring milk is using the breast shields as funnels. I fill each bag with 4 oz and lay it flat in a loaf pan in the freezer.  If the bag leaks the pan is there to catch it. When the bag is frozen into a slab I move it into another loaf pan where I stand it up vertically so many bags can fit inside the pan. When I have 50-60 oz collected in the tin I put the bags in a larger storage bag with date and amount labeled to move into the deep freezer. You only need to make 1-1.5 oz per hour of separation for your first day back. What you pump the first day should be enough to sustain him the next day. Ask your daycare provider to text when LO is hungry so you can try to pump close to that time. This helps your body stay in sync with your baby's needs. When we started daycare I was pumping three times a day while LO was eating twice at daycare, it resulted in a slight overproduction problem for me on the weekends. I'm now pumping twice a day and it's working out much better. Offer to nurse at drop off and pickup to minimize the amount you need to pump. You can also tell your daycare provider not to offer a big feeding, only a small amount if absolutely necessary, if they know you're on your way back. Good luck with going back to work!"

beyondthebump,3dytpt,IveCreatedAMuenster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:54:24 2015 UTC,"I was worried about how much attention my son would get in daycare.  He's almost 10 months old now and he LOVES it.  He loves his teachers and the assistant that helps out.  He loves the other babies, just watching them and giggling at them.  Sometimes when I go pick him up, I stand outside the classroom window and just watch him for a couple minutes and he is just having so much fun.  I didn't think babies this young enjoyed other children, and they don't technically ""play"" together, but they very clearly enjoy watching each other and smiling and laughing at each other.  He also gets to do activities and play with toys I am not sure I would ever think of or that even a nanny would/could do.     Anyway, I chose center daycare because I felt that it was the safest environment for my son, but I had the same worries he would be sad or neglected.  Now I feel that he is loved and enriched there and I can already see that as he gets older and learns to socialize he is going to have some automatic friends in some of his classmates.  The downside of a room full of babies is germs ... it's unavoidable and it sucks.  I'm hoping that means we'll have fewer colds/infections when he's old enough to remember.  But really ... that's the only major downside."

beyondthebump,3dyx5v,happyhapsy,3,Mon Jul 20 17:41:28 2015 UTC,"When it comes to solids, current advice is to not judge based on milk intake. The signs of readiness are being able to sit independently, able to bring objects to their own mouth to chew and interest in your food such as trying to grab it and mimicking chewing. If those signs are present, then go for it!  You don't have to do rice or oatmeal at all if you don't want to. We started off with solids once a day, now at 6.5 months we do it twice.

beyondthebump,3dyx5v,mediocrity511,2,Mon Jul 20 19:47:28 2015 UTC,"It's possible! With ur daughter, she was showing interest in food for weeks before we started weaning. But we wanted to try hold off for 6 months because of the benefits of that and because she wasn't sitting properly either. We started at about 5.5 months in the end, her sitting was good by that point and she was literally grabbing the food off our plates!  If you do start before he can sit independently then you will need to do the more traditional weaning route of runny purees. If you wait until he can sit, then you can do baby led weaning, which is what we're doing."
beyondthebump,3dyx5v,IveCreatedAMuenster,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:51:23 2015 UTC,"Most people advise against cereal in a bottle these days, and most people also do not think cereal helps babies sleep as rice is far more quickly digested than the fats and proteins in formula or breastmilk.  In my experience, my son slept like shit when we first started solids because it made him so gassy and constipated.  When we started, we offered it on a spoon once a day and quickly learned to do it in the morning so that if it made him gassy it did not keep him up all night.    I think the hunger is probably more likely a growth spurt than an indication that he is ready for solids."

We figured it was time when she was able to keep her head up consistently and she was showing an interest in food when we were eating.   We started with rice cereal. We tried it in her bottle, but she didn't care for it. So we tried it liquidy and fed with a spoon. She didn't like it either, but was totally into the spoon. So we thickened it up more to the consistency of oatmeal and she devoured it. We have to thicken any veggie or fruit that is naturally watery for her now with the rice. she's all about texture.   We fed her for ""dinner"" a little bit before bed time, about 1/4 cup worth, gave her a bath and then gave her a bottle before bed for about a week while she adjusted.   Now she gets 3 meals a day. In the morning she usually has banana or apple. At lunch (12-1), any kind of veggie. Squash, sweet potato, peas, carrots, brocolli. Same with dinner (5-6). She lets us know when she's done. Usually by slamming her hands on the tray in front of her. haha  Making her food is a breeze. I usually steam/boil fresh veggies until they are soft and throw them into my ninja blender. Then I pour the puree into silicone cube trays and freeze them. They're the perfect size and you just throw a cube or two into the microwave for about a minute. Always test the temperature before feeding it to LO.  It's really not hard. Just do what you feel is right. LO will let you know if he's not quite ready and you can try again later. But at 5.5 mo, he's probably ready. :)"

beyondthebump,3dyed4,evilaliencat,4,Mon Jul 20 15:28:50 2015 UTC,"We haven't had a poopcident yet but we often get secondhand toys. I launder anything plush. If it doesn't make it through the wash, I toss it. Anything wooden gets scrubbed and rinsed with dish soap and hot water, but no soaking. Plastic gets tossed in hot soapy water and scrubbed. If I'm worried about something gross, like having been stored improperly in a garage or attic or something, I also do a bleach or vinegar dip in the sink, where I just dunk and swish and then let air dry.   Wet haven't done books because they're hard to clean and they always go in his mouth, but I suppose Lysol wipes and a spritz of some safe disinfectant and air dry might work!"

Books and other hard to wash things sit in the sun outside for a few hours (it is a natural disinfectant).  If none of the above work, adios to the toy."

I once dated a guy who came home drunk and puked on the books I kept in the washroom. Normal books, not childrens books. Could not be cleaned without destruction. Did my best to wipe them but paper is absorbent it holds things and can easily be a breeding ground for any bacteria that touches it. I tossed them. If they aren't plastic books and it touched anywhere paper/ cardboard that would absorb it you might have to toss'em. If it's just the cover you can lysol those."

Books are pretty much impossible to sanitize. At my library books that have any kind of liquid damage get withdrawn from the collection. Even if they appear dry they can harbor mold which can quickly spread from book to book. We use a bleach solution to clean book covers, but they're covered in that thick library plastic so the bleach doesn't damage them. Any damage to actual book pages, though, and there's no way to truly get them clean.  That said...I've picked up dropped books out of the dirt, shaken them off, and handed them to my kiddo. And pretty much all library books are covered in germs (Shhhh, librarian insider info). So, yes, there's no way to sanitize books, but what are you going to do? Poop books, though...those I would toss :)"

Alternately I might try the hosing off - for sure hose them off lol.  Then the dishwasher?  And the regular washing machine if they are the fabric books/stuffed animals.
beyondthebump,3dykc0,Lollipop77,12,Mon Jul 20 16:11:53 2015 UTC,But you are nursing successfully. You don't have to exclusively breastfeed to breastfeed. You are doing great.
beyondthebump,3dykc0,justsomemammal,11,Mon Jul 20 18:13:54 2015 UTC,It's ok to be sad but there's no shame in feeding your baby formula. My baby has been exclusively formula fed from birth and she's a healthy chubster. You gave it your best shot and that's what parenting is all about.
beyondthebump,3dykc0,LilaFaith,7,Mon Jul 20 16:20:30 2015 UTC,"Try fenugreek. Make lactation cookies.  Drink more water than you think you need. And give your son some time.   He probably is still struggling to nurse effectively and needs time to learn. It probably took 2 weeks for my son to get really good at it after having his tongue tie clipped at 5 weeks. Yours is much younger and probably still learning to nurse properly.  If a little time and other things don't help, then there is no shame in quitting and feeding formula. Heck, there is no shame in switching to formula now if that is what you really want. Do what is best for you and baby.   You should speak to your OB about feelings of depression. You can take medicationfor depression and breastfeed if you choose to continue to. I breastfeed my son and take anti depressants. I am a much healthier person for it, and my son is better taken care of."
beyondthebump,3dykc0,briliantlyfreakish,2,Mon Jul 20 16:51:04 2015 UTC,"I second the fenugreek recommendation. It's magic stuff and has worked wonderfully for me and many of my breastfeeding friends. Only side effect is your sweat starts to smell like maple syrup :)  The first few weeks are the absolute hardest and I don't think anything you learn during pregnancy really prepares you for that. Lean on your support network. Make sure your partner knows that right now, your only job is to feed your baby.  Try to get out of the house, even if its just to sit in the backyard. It is so easy to lose perspective when you're feeling tied to a nursing chair and pillows. Hang in there, you can do this!"
beyondthebump,3dykc0,fernyfantastic,2,Mon Jul 20 21:17:22 2015 UTC,I second all of these suggestions. I went to Target CONSTANTLY the first two months or so. Just to get out of the house realy.
beyondthebump,3dykc0,briliantlyfreakish,3,Tue Jul 21 00:18:12 2015 UTC,"Please don't beat yourself up over it. I am speaking from experience. When my little gremlin was born she needed immediate emergency intervention and was intubated, and then was operated on 2 days later, and hospitalized for three weeks. The first 10 days or so she did not eat any food at all, not even through a feeding tube. Trying to get her to latch after I could finally try (almost a month old!) was impossible. She would flail, get frustrated, chew, and did not understand. I pumped but after leaving the hospital my supply started to diminish and then I got pretty ill and couldn't even get up, which did not help either. I always had to supplement her with formula for increased calorie counts, but eventually we just swapped entirely. I felt immensely guilty like I was a failure to my daughter, and I had wanted so badly to breastfeed. However, I have learned time and time again with her that nothing goes to plan and it is best to just not only do what is best for her, but what was best for us. She was not eating enough. I was miserable and exhausted pumping 30-45 minutes every three hours to get not enough for her and still having to give her a formula bottle. After I got over the initial feelings of guilt, we are both so much happier. She is eating what she needs to and I am not going nuts pumping. My husband can feed her anytime. There are nights when he sleeps with her out in the living room and I can sleep an uninterrupted 8 hours. She is exceeding her developmental milestones and is thriving, despite her CHD and other issues. Do NOT beat yourself up if you can't do it. Obviously we all want to do what is best for our babies, but the best thing is to make sure they are being fed period. I hope lactation can help, but I just wanted to offer another experience. :)"
beyondthebump,3dykc0,RaziyaRC,3,Tue Jul 21 03:30:46 2015 UTC,"I can't really relate because I went into breastfeeding knowing it probably wouldn't work... and I was a tiny bit disappointed when it didn't... but honestly, my life got so much better once I quit. There's nothing to be ashamed of. You tried. It just doesn't work for everyone. Formula is awesome. If it wasn't for formula, my baby would be dead. Embrace the extra free time you get by not pumping! (just trying to look at the positives). :)"
beyondthebump,3dykc0,happyhapsy,2,Mon Jul 20 16:16:58 2015 UTC,"To add to what others have said. Try to decide if you want to stop or are just becoming overwhelmed.The first month-6weeks are really tough for everyone, it normally gets a lot easier if you can manage to stick it out but if it's really miserable then formula is nothing to be ashamed about. If you would prefer to carry on if possible, the main things are drink lots and lots (I need at least 3litres of water a day, you may be different), eat as well as you can and try to rest as much as possible (i always found a nap would help if milk was low). To increase the amount you make, you have to increase stimulation, which means attempting to feed every hour or two during the day (this only needs to happen short term) and at least once during the night (feed or pump if asleep). There is a slight delay, so increased demand tends to result in more milk the day after. This website was really helpful for me kellymom."
beyondthebump,3dykc0,here_kitti_kitti,2,Mon Jul 20 19:05:56 2015 UTC,"Be kind to yourself. You're already doing amazing just by thinking about whether you should stop or not. While its generally accepted that 'breast is best' (nutritionally, anyway) compromising your mental health isn't a good trade off. Formula fed babies thrive just as well (search reddit for FF adults - many are just as healthy and intelligent as BF people - myself included). And as has been suggested here, you don't have to exclusively breastfeed to breastfeed. Be kind to yourself, you're doing so well."
beyondthebump,3dykc0,Evastria,2,Mon Jul 20 23:19:48 2015 UTC,I breastfed as much as my supply allowed and formula the rest. It doesn't have to be all or nothing. I was able to experience the nursing bond without stressing and leave my baby when I wanted to
beyondthebump,3dykc0,Ishslittleone,2,Tue Jul 21 00:36:35 2015 UTC,"Fenugreek and blessed thistle are both great herbs. Also fennel tea. Lots of skin to skin contact and if you supplement, use a supplemental nursing system so your breasts are still getting the stimulation while you supplement. The first 6 weeks are the toughest. Be gentle with yourself and take it one day, or even one hour at a time if you have to.   Please dont use pumping as an indication of supply. Lots of women with good supplies get diddly squat when they pump.   La Leche League has a support line you can call anytime and vent to. Sometimes we just need to vent to people that have been there.  I hope your appointment went well. Hugs."
beyondthebump,3dykc0,Creepella_the_third,3,Tue Jul 21 01:37:59 2015 UTC,"Your feelings are very similar to what I felt after my son was born. Just remember that a good mom feeds her baby.   Whether that feeding is through nursing or formula, no judgments need to be made.  As for supply, try using a hospital grade pump. It was the only thing that helped me at least supplement with breastmilk during my son's first four months due to hypothyroidism and a lip tie.    Now, about the depression.  You need to talk to your OB about this.  A lactation consultant is great for some things, but the doctor that managed your care throughout pregnancy is much better qualified to deal with this essential concern.  They can also offer you a referral to mental health professionals if you feel the need.  If you know you could relapse into depression, please remember that depression hurts you, baby and the whole family and your mental health is of great importance.    Overall, I recommend talking with an unbiased medical professional about the pros and cons of various types of feeding and their potential effect on both you and baby.  If you are able to continue with nursing, that's wonderful.  However, if you decide on formula, that is wonderful too.  In the end, all that matters is a happy, healthy family, momma included!"
beyondthebump,3dykc0,Detroiteanca,3,Mon Jul 20 16:24:01 2015 UTC,"So do you really feel like giving up or are you frustrated it's not working out? If you really want to stop there is no shame in that. Breastfeeding does not work out for everyone and that is ok. Breastfeeding is not going to make or break your child and doesn't mean you're any more or less of a mother. I struggled with breastfeeding at the beginning. My supply has never been abundant and we had to start supplementing at one month. I really considered switching to formula because I was so frustrated but didn't because breastfeeding is important to me. A friend told me she struggled and things got better around two months so I decided to stick it out until then. It did get significantly better around two months, we're at almost six months now. It hasn't been the easiest journey but I'm happy with my decision. To help my supply I did several things. I only ever  offered formula after the boob. I actually read my pump manual and learned how to use my pump properly because I wasn't before and started pumping after several feeds a day. I also started eating oatmeal every morning, drinking Mother's Milk tea and taking fenugreek and blessed thistle every day. We still have to supplement with a couple ounces of formula some days but not every day. It took me a while to accept but I finally realized breastfeeding didn't have to be all or nothing. I love breastfeeding but it also kind of drives me crazy because of all I have to do to maintain my supply. Only you know what is best for you."

I made sure I projected the right look for that photo and I was lucky that at the end of my birth I still looked fresh and glowing. I could PM a link to you if you really wanted to see it, but from the sounds of it you wouldn't.  Here's the thing: when she was placed on me I didn't really feeling anything except. I was completely emotionally numb and just focused on the fact that I needed that picture for her birth announcement (so image conscious :-/ ) I was looking at her freshly pushed out body and the gunk all over her face and I thinking, huh, you're not very attractive are you?   In fact she was kind of icky. Her face was grey because it was covered in gunk and then even under that the trip had given her quite a bit of facial bruising. She also seemed rather bug eyed to me. I went through the motions. I did what I had to do. I latched her, she suckled. And (almost) all I was thinking about was let me see the dinner menu so I can get an order in before the kitchen closes.  Don't worry, she's grown on me since then, like a barnacle. I know objectively she still has weird, little-old-man-face, but now I find her cute.  If it isn't too late, have you considered going in for a newborn photography session?

I did eventually get to hold him wrapped in the hospital blanket, but I was so exhausted that I don't remember it, but in the pictures my eyes are closed and I look like I'm asleep. I did not get the time to gaze lovingly at him. We also had a three day NICU stay due to jaundice.  I feel you mama. Your delivery sounds so much worse than mine, but I sympathize. I have the same feelings when I see other moms post those pictures. For the first week or so after he was born I bonded with him slowly, and it tore me apart because I never got that moment of instant love right after he was born. He was taken away from me before it could happen.   Now he's 11 weeks and that overwhelming love is there. He's healthy and I'm grateful. I still feel a bit sad when I think about how his delivery and his first weeks were not what I imagined and I don't know if that sadness will ever go away completely, but it's not as bad as it used to be.  You are amazing and strong. You went through hell to bring that wonderful baby into this world, but you're also entitled to feel however you need to feel about it. I hope it stings a little less as time goes on. Hang in there, you're doing great!"
beyondthebump,3dwsmv,catsreaction,2,Mon Jul 20 06:06:43 2015 UTC,"Your post birth sounds a lot like mine. When I saw my son I was on magnesium and could just reach in through the holes in the NICU bed, and I hope some day I can love that photo."

My one year old peanut was born after a failed induction, failed epidural, and then a C section that I felt because of the failed epidural. All sorts of failing went on.  My daughter has a severe heart defect that was thankfully diagnosed while I was still pregnant. After she was born, they immediately took her to the NICU. I didn't really see her until the next day and that was only briefly before she got transferred to another hospital. I then had to hang out for another day before they would release me, with no baby and I was really upset.   But it got easier, and though it still stings sometimes that I got ""cheated"" out of a lot of the regular baby-having experiences, it's not something that affects me regularly anymore. I'm positive you'll get to that point also. It just takes some time.  Good luck! :)"

beyondthebump,3dwsmv,Ledagood,2,Mon Jul 20 15:58:06 2015 UTC,"I'm insanely jealous of other women's birth experiences. My babies were born at 34 weeks. My daughter came out okay, but my son took one breath and then stopped breathing (though i didn't know what was going on at the time). Both babies were immediately carted off to the NICU. I didn't get to see my babies for nearly 24 hours because I was sick. I was able to hold my daughter for about 30 minutes, but wasn't able to hold my son for three days. After that, they both did really well and came home after 13 and 16 days. I know compared to a lot, my experience isn't that bad, so I feel guilty for feeling the way I do. But my entire pregnancy, I was looking forward to that moment of having my children placed on my chest, and I can't help but feel resentful that I didn't get that."

I was so in the zone I forgot to ask my fiance to take a picture of me with her. I was so upset, it's like I wasn't even there. I still get upset about it when I think about it, but I have my baby and that's all that matters."
beyondthebump,3dwsmv,Bmorehon,2,Mon Jul 20 14:46:15 2015 UTC,"I think ""it doesn't matter as long as the child is healthy"" can be such a damaging mindset. It's truly a celebration and a relief that our children came out of birth healthy, but I think it can minimize the fact that it's perfectly healthy to mourn the fact that your birth experience was scary, and stressful, and whatever else.   I had a bumpy birth too and it felt whenever I brought up my feelings of grief or sadness about the experience, that's what was always said- it doesn't matter because the child is healthy. Believe me, I'm overwhelmingly relieved my child is healthy, but that doesn't help process the feelings and kind of gives the signal that I need to just stfu about it.   I kind of went on a tangent, but what I'm really trying to say is it's Okay to grieve what you didn't get! I'm at peace with the way my son's birth happened now, but there was a lot of sadness and tears for the first few months when I thought about it."

I think I had blocked out many things about my birth story being traumatic - we had taken no childbirth classes, read few stories, watched no videos and I didn't have any idea what I was in for.  I was on magnesium as well, and baby had jaundice, and I had high BP that would not quit.  On top of the nuttiness, we got that 100"" of snow in his first month, starting 1 hour after we got home.      He's now 6 months and I want to book a professional photo shoot because I love photos and there are almost no pics of me and babe, but I can't even look for photographers because newborn photos make me so sad.  Actually, I'm tearing up thinking about it now.  I hope you can let it go too, and when you figure out how, I'd love to know about it!  Hugs to you."

My MIL took a bunch of photos of me in the hospital and then posted them to Facebook. I never asked her to remove them, because, well.. it's honest. But god. I look like big fat swollen death. Luckily she didn't tag me in any, but the fact she posted them was just annoying.  I think because of this (and the fact that I'm photo crazy and take so many photos of my baby and husband together) I always make sure to ask my husband to take photos of me and baby. If I couldn't get the first hospital photo, I will make damn sure I've got plenty other happy ones to look back on. :)"

He went into distress early in labour and I had to have a csection. He was born with severe MAS. He spent two weeks unconscious and hooked up to a ventilator. I didn't get to hold him until he was 15 days old. It was miserable. I've taken a lot of flack from crunchy people over ""choosing"" an emegency csection. I don't like seeing those pictures either. It also makes me really sad to think that if we have a second I might get those pictures but I'll be so sad I didn't with our first.  You aren't alone and it really sucks."

beyondthebump,3dw9tx,thekenzta,9,Mon Jul 20 05:13:10 2015 UTC,"My understanding of EBF past solids is that the only milk they get is from you - no cows milk or soy/almond/coconut/whatever. Not on purpose my son only gets milk from me, he just won't drink the other stuff."
beyondthebump,3dw9tx,DinosaurSprinkles,15,Mon Jul 20 06:52:15 2015 UTC,"So, breastmilk and food? Because that's normal.  Edit: Making sure you know that wasn't sarcasm! :)"
beyondthebump,3dw9tx,Wine_Queen,9,Mon Jul 20 13:30:56 2015 UTC,"My guess is that's what she means. Some people use ""EBF"" to mean no formula/cow's milk, but it could mean in addition to solids depending on the kid's age. Personally I find it confusing because I never know what people mean exactly when they say ""EBF,"" since it means different things to different people. I don't know how it would be possible to have a 2 year old that doesn't eat solids, but a 2 year old can totally still nurse if that's what the mom and child want."
beyondthebump,3dw9tx,bonjourtabby,9,Mon Jul 20 14:04:58 2015 UTC,My understanding of exclusively breastfeeding is feeding them from the breast to the exclusion of anything else.
beyondthebump,3dw9tx,lawhottie,3,Mon Jul 20 14:05:11 2015 UTC,"That's true up until the point when they start solids. People still say exclusively breastfed long as they are not getting milk from anywhere else. Basically, it means no formula and no bottles. But it can mean solid food as well after 6 or so months."
beyondthebump,3dw9tx,dagger_guacamole,9,Mon Jul 20 14:20:51 2015 UTC,"Oh, I call that breastfeeding! Then breastfeeding with formula or cow's milk, etc is called supplementing."
beyondthebump,3dw9tx,lawhottie,0,Mon Jul 20 14:32:01 2015 UTC,"For the first 6 months, yes. But an EBF toddler has a different meaning in the ""look at me and my fancy acronym"" crowd."
beyondthebump,3dw9tx,DinosaurSprinkles,6,Mon Jul 20 15:16:46 2015 UTC,"Lol. I'm curious about how other dairy products fit in. Are they not EBF if they eat yogurt? Or if they've tried chocolate cow's milk? I breastfeed my toddler, but he enjoys tastes of our ice cream, etc. I haven't considered him exclusively breastfed since he's been eating some semblance of meals."

I always let relatives hold him when they ask at gatherings because I know they look forward to it and because I hope it starts to help him understand that the world won't end. And also because he occasionally surprises me and is totally chill with someone! But when/if he REALLY starts screaming I want to take him back. Seems reasonable right? Why do you WANT to hold a screaming sobbing baby?  But it is always the same comments--""You're spoiling him"", ""That baby has you wrapped around his finger!"", ""So-and-so never cried when others held them"" and my favorite: ""But he's too young to only want mom and dad!""

My cousin recently tried to shame me for not posting as many pictures of my daughter to social media as I do my son. There are several reasons why this is ridiculous to me. I'm a stay at home mom so I spend most of my day with my son while my daughter is in school. My daughter was born before I had a smartphone or used social media, but if you look at my FB albums I've posted the majority of my pictures of her from her first few years. The most important reason that I share less of her is that she's entering her tween years and I'm trying to respect her privacy. All of this is apparently lost on my cousin."

Otherwise, no, it's not hugely necessary. I started a daily walk to Starbucks (one mile round trip, from my home through a vibrant and walkable downtown area) when my baby was about six days old, and kept it up for three or four months. I had literally created, while pregnant, a separate ""Starbucks budget"" just as a sanity-saver for those early months, that I put money into weekly before I went on leave. It was a lifeline. It ensured that no matter what else went on that day, I got some fresh air, got some amount of physical movement, saw and talked to some other adults, etc. Plus I got a treat for myself every day in the form of a delicious iced tea, which was pretty great for my overall mood at the time. The baby loved being outside. People loved seeing the baby. Nobody tried to touch him or cough on him or Ebola-puke on him. We did not walk through hazardous waste, war zones, or extreme weather. I don't really understand people who have a problem with this?  I know someone who stayed home for TWO MONTHS each with both her kids. I mean like never ever took them out of their house. She went grocery shopping a few times but only once her husband was home to stay with the baby. That honestly boggles my mind. I cannot imagine it. If nothing else I feel like getting out keeps even very young babies sort of interested and un-bored.

Before having my baby I was pretty tiny and it made me so uncomfortable when people would say that I needed to eat something or that I was all bones. It's more of an internal thing I guess. It's just hard for me to see a woman shrink back down when it's been so hard for me to even drop 20 lbs of my pregnancy weight. You go girl for getting your body back, though. It's truly an accomplishment and I feel genuinely happy for you and all others that do that. But then at the same time I just feel crappy about myself for not being there too, I suppose."

I have two kids, 15 months apart, and was ball to a size 2/4 (depending on brand) within 4 months without trying. It's just genetics. On the flip side, I didn't have enough body fat to exclusively breastfeed. No matter how much I ate I just couldn't keep up, I would start losing too much weight, and my milk had little to no fat in it, which isn't good for babies. Luckily I was never shamed for that."

Then later that night she got mad at me for letting him have air popped popcorn because ""He needs to eat his hotdog before that crap food"".

I don't think this counts as mommy shaming, but my husband's grandmother called us to tell us we should be putting our babies on their backs to sleep. Our kiddos were in the NICU, and the nurses sometimes put the babies on their bellies or positioned them in different ways to help the babies with digestion and to keep them from getting flat spots on their heads. She didn't say anything at the time, but called us later to tell us how horrible it was. (Nurse shaming?)

Dear Husband: I spent ten months watching my body morph and change beyond my control (and often to my distress) growing a fucking baby, then had surprise, serious stomach surgery to remove him, and guess what: I don't like the body that I was left with.

You can start at 36 weeks and stay out until your doctor releases you; usually 6 weeks for vaginal and 8 weeks for CS unless you have some other healing to do. Then you can get paid bonding leave through the state for an additional six weeks. Most employers will honor that. But yea, I feel you on the other stuff."

beyondthebump,3dvt4i,twistyabbazabba,7,Mon Jul 20 19:10:12 2015 UTC,"Not as good as it sounds. I'm in CA and work for a major university. I had to pay into disability for a year before being eligible, I couldn't start using it until week 39, it had a thirty day hold before it ""kicked in,"" i had to exhaust all of my vacation and sick time before it would cover anything, it was for only 70% of my pay check, and it ended at 6 weeks postpartum. All told, it covered me for about 2.5 weeks."
beyondthebump,3dvt4i,bellalinda,2,Mon Jul 20 10:38:31 2015 UTC,There should only be a 10 day hold according to the EDD website and I'm not sure why you were required to exhaust all your leave? I've been on short term disability three times and they never required that.
beyondthebump,3dvt4i,twistyabbazabba,2,Mon Jul 20 19:12:06 2015 UTC,University policy and I suppose it depends who carries the disability insurance- mine was through Liberty Mutual and that's just how it worked. I expected better from a big university and was pretty disappointed in their maternity leave policies.

I worked til the day i had the baby at 40 weeks, got 6 weeks for vaginal/8 weeks for C-section at only 50% pay, and no bonding time. Oh and the first two weeks of disability were unpaid and I had to opt in to the disability insurance and pay for a year first to be eligible. And if I hadn't started to pay in when I started my job, the terms were way worse."

But then I needed to be induced. Labor was crazy intense (though short) and ended with an emergency c-section. After that I thought ""I really don't know if I can do this again. We should stick with one.""   But now that he's three months old, the memory has fuzzed a bit, and I'm feeling healthy and strong... Now I'm starting to catch myself thinking about what I could do differently to make the second go smoother. So maybe it'll still happen. Eventually."

beyondthebump,3dvt4i,Flewtea,2,Mon Jul 20 04:49:35 2015 UTC,"Thats not necessarily the case. We've all had different experiences and I think most of us are trying to be helpful. I have had two not great but certainly not complicated pregnancies, two easy labors, and two of the world's most horrible sleepers. I have to try really hard not to laugh every time I see someone complaining about how terrible waking up every three hours is because they genuinely have no clue how much worse it can be. Before I had our first, that would have been me too. And one of the things that made me feel the absolute worst after she was born was not having known her brand of awfulness was just...normal. Just one, albeit rare, possibility. It would have saved me so much mental stress to have known that beforehand. So yeah, I'll tell people how hard it is honestly. Because having such a rough time is bad enough without being completely blindsided by it as well."
beyondthebump,3dvt4i,thepriceforciv,2,Mon Jul 20 05:50:55 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I'm brutally honest with how difficult my baby was for the first few months. I think it can help moms prepare and let them know that it is normal to have a bad experience, but it gets better.  I also tell them about my friends that had the dream baby that STTN at 6 weeks, just so they know that the mommy experience can vary greatly.  What is hard for new mothers to understand is that babies are SO different and there isn't much parenting you can do to help a difficult baby become easier.  You can nudge them in the right direction, but they are who they are from the moment they are born.  I think it is good for new moms to understand that they can do everything right and still have a horrible newborn experience."
beyondthebump,3dvt4i,mrsninja,3,Mon Jul 20 17:39:00 2015 UTC,"I'm worried that I'll have the same situation -- a baby like my first one.

The second could be WORSE than the first."
beyondthebump,3dvt4i,technoangel,2,Mon Jul 20 08:00:58 2015 UTC,"Heh, second pregnancy has been easier than the first BY FAR and honestly, I got the crazy child first so I'm hoping the second one will be the nice mellow one. But either way, I have only gained 22 lbs at 33 weeks pregnant so I'm sure that I'll bounce back even faster than last time! However, I am an only child and I was very happy with being an only child. To each their own!"
beyondthebump,3dvt4i,megalynn44,7,Mon Jul 20 04:52:07 2015 UTC,We're struggling with this now. I genuinely love being a mom and want more kids. I don't want to put the responsibility of older parents or grandkids on the shoulder of one child. My kid (20 months) loves other people and would be so happy to have a sibing or more. BUT I have absolutely no desire to be pregnant again. I'm not keen to do the newborn thing all over again. I just.... I feel absolutely undecided. Nothing seems like the right choice right now.

beyondthebump,3dvt4i,Teemo4evr,18,Mon Jul 20 05:00:19 2015 UTC,"For everyone saying they don't want more because their babies are so hard, give it some time. You don't have to have babies back to back. You don't have to have a baby and a toddler. I have a 4 year old and a newborn, it's awesome. My older kid can wipe his own butt and dress himself and get himself snacks and bring me diapers and throw the dirty ones away. I wouldn't have 4 kids 4 years apart, but two is totally doable."

But, when I have a good day, I want to start trying for another baby right away! My son will not be clingy and demanding forever, and when I think about my future, I do not see us as a family of 3. I see a large family with lots of love and chaos. I see family get togethers with my grown children and lots of future grandkids. In the end, I know we will have more kids even though I feel like I am one and done often!"

Six through disability, and six paid by the state through family leave/baby bonding. Just in case that helps...  Oh, and yes. I wanted two. And then after trying for two years and going through treatments, my colicky refluxy 11 week old is making me rethink that. I absolutely love her, and when she smiles at me it lights up my world. But I don't think I can go through treatments again, and I don't think I can go through the colic/reflux again.

And I'm staying at home with him, which my mom didn't do.    I'm very lucky, but I don't know how long it will last.  We're not going to have another until this one is out of diapers or unless my pill fails.  I set a timer for it!!  I'd also like for #1 to be in daycare while I take care of #2 during the first few weeks.  That or have him stay with a family member or have my retired aunt come over for a few hours and watch #1.  Everything is so fucking expensive NOW.  I can't imagine how much daycare will be in 3 year unless some major social reform happens where childcare is made more affordable or maternity leave also pays for childcare for other children...    I'm at home alone, too, for 12 hours, 4 days a week.  My parents spoil him, but they live down the road.    Everyone gets so overwhelmed thinking how they could possibly do all of this themselves and I think it's a terrible mentality because it's so discouraging, but at least in the USA, the ""it takes a village"" idea has gone out the window.  Now it's a ""you got knocked up, you got a job, deal with it"" mentality and ""I'm not responsible for your kid"" kind of thing.  No basis of community anymore.  Very individual.  Keep the doors locked, never come over unannounced, etc."
beyondthebump,3dvt4i,rstan25,5,Mon Jul 20 13:08:08 2015 UTC,"Before I got pregnant I wanted two kids fairly close in age. I wanted to start trying for number 2 by number 1's first birthday. I was hoping to have a boy and a girl. Well pregnancy was not fun. I gained a bunch of weight and have stretch marks from the middle of my stomach down to my knees. I had to have a C-section and recovery was brutal. I really do not want to go through that again. And if my body still doesn't seem to be getting back to normal after a year or so, I'm considering plastic surgery. But I won't want to have to do it all over again.  LO has two cousins 18 months older than her and will have another 9 months younger than her. She'll have children close to her age to grow up with. And I will encourage her to bring friends over and have slumber parties.  Also, with only one, we can afford a lot of fun trips and give her great Christmases and birthday parties.   My husband and I discuss it all the time, right now I think we're one and done. She's fulfilled my need for babies. I was baby crazy before I got pregnant and now have absolutely no desire to have another. My husband wanted a boy, but he doesn't want two girls. So I don't think he minds either way. I got the Nexplanon birth control that last 3 years. I figured 3 years is plenty of time for me to figure it out but I really think I'm done. I think I wanted the experience of having a child but I don't want a big family. Just one is all I need. Plus, my husband and I can't wait until she's bigger and we can take her on fun vacations and activities. Having another baby would be like starting all over."

Even after coming home, he had to go back for countless appointments and had about three or so surguries before his first birthday, and another three or so by the time he was 10.

There was a period where it was ""well, let's revisit the issue in a year,"" but then it morphed into ""you know what? I'm done. Are you done?"" and that's that. Our amazing, vivacious, independent toddler is going to be an only child, and while sometimes it makes me a bit sad that I'll never experience the baby stage again, I get happy remembering that I won't have to go through things again.   This is it. No more. And if, for some reason, we decide in a few years we can afford another baby or want one, we will adopt. No more natural babies. I also doubt we will ever feel the need to want another. We are so content, and complete, as a family of 3. I wouldn't want it any other way."

I like other people's babies but shit, it's so hard when it's your own and you're the one doing everything and making all of the decisions.

Babies go through transitions where they get easier and harder, and this is normal. For me the 16-24 month was challenging with increased ability/movement and not being able to get a moments break because she'd hurt herself or something. It got easier again some time after 2 and a lot of fun around 3. Parenting with Love and Logic book really helped my husband and I agree on parenting things and have a really well behaved child. If you have anyone in your support network whom you trust, ask if they could step in even for an hour or two. It helps to have periodic breaks where you can have some time to be just you."

I had to have a forceps delivery with episiotomy (cut made in perinium) and then lost 2 pints of blood when the placenta was delivered so had a blood transfusion. It's put me off having anymore, at least for 10 years or so.  Thankfully fiances parents are now on board and love her, but don't think I'll ever really trust them not to judge us/have ago at us about things - particularly his dad who I manage to be polite and civil to but doubt my relationship with him will go any further than that now.

This pregnancy has been smoother emotionally and in our relationship. The longer time went on the harder it was to think of starting over with a baby, but I'm looking forward to it now. Each year that goes past my daughter gets more fun and easier. We don't have anyone in the family with children her age so that is hard. Everyone's family situation is their own.

The colleges really aren't that expensive if you start at a community college for the basic courses and shop around.  Between scholarships, grants, and being very very careful neither my husband or I had any school debt when we graduated (we did have a car payment).  However there really isn't any way to be careful enough to save yourself from medical debt.  My dad is an attorney and my mom was a nurse when my sisters died.  They had good jobs and good insurance.  They had good friends who raised money to help pay for bills and let us stay with them when we were homeless.  It just wasn't enough.

Pads the hospital has,  and good ones just use them.  I never touched any electronics I brought, and barely the tv and I was in the hospital for 4 days.  Clothes to go home in.  I also stayed in the hopital gown.  I wish I brought more outfits for my lo.  I only brought take home clothes assuming they would provide.  Well they did but they where size 6months. Wipes, if you hate the idea of using rags.  My hospital provided rags for diapering."

I had baby's bag packed so I had more than I needed for her. I wore the disposable underwear that the hospital provided and used the pads they provided. I stayed in the hospital gown because none of my clothes were practical for nursing.... and felt awkward not having a bra to wear when visitors came."
beyondthebump,3dz96r,InnocentHeathy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:44:27 2015 UTC,"My husband refused to leave me the first time, so clothes and toiletries for him. Forgot about his stuff and he made a huge scene about leaving me all alone (even though my family was there) until my brother forced him out. This time, I'm planning to have him leave and go home and rest afterwards because of our daughter (don't know who will babysit her yet).   Edit: My husband has a distrust of hospitals and bad experiences so he does not really trust them. In his old country, people go to the hospital to die and not to live. So it is hard for him to overcome that mindset.  Your favorite snacks because after all that trauma your body went through, you would want your favorites.  I was really really exhausted and slept most of my stay so I didn't read any books, play games, or anything. I just slept, ate, breastfed, and rest. So I don't plan on bring anything else. That book of sudoku was just laying in my bag. Maybe and iPod for music or something this time.  I brought a small bag of makeup that I did not use. So this time, lip balm and lotion. My lips gets chapped easily and kiehl's lip balm is my holy grail. A lightly scented lotion because of all the bleeding like you are going through a massive overdue period makes me feel icky.   My glasses because no way am I going to deal with contact lense so soon. Besides, I might be too exhausted and forget to take them out.  The hospital I went to gives new mothers their own rooms for privacy.  If your hospital room is shared, you may want to bring something to relax you or calm yourself down or give you some quiet, like noise canceling headphones. My sister in law complained about her roommates's visitors being noisy and she could not rest. It mad her really grumpy and irritable.  Nursing bra and comfortable clothes to go home in. Car seat for the car because the hospital won't let you take the baby home without one.   My one little secret. A tiny bottle of red wine. I know, you're not suppose to drink when breastfeeding. I pump and dump. But after abstaining for 40 weeks...I want my red wine with smoked Gouda cheese. Okay, maybe hold up on that one."

Everyone told me I'd lose weight breastfeeding, if anything it made me prone to gaining weight. I've always gained weight easily so I've always made an effort to exercise regularly ( did a 5k a few days before LO was born) before and during my pregnancy. With that said I gained a lot of weight but lost it by 3 months- but- I am used to exercising/ watching what I eat because I do gain weight really easily. With that said to lose weight I ate about 1800 calories a day and by 12 weeks PP I was running 50km a week. That's a tonne of work, but losing weight is hard and it sucks. What helped me was focusing on fitness goals and not the scale otherwise it would get depressing. Plus it made me feel really strong having fitness goals that I reached!

She also told me that things may just shift so clothing may not fit even if I am close to my old weight. All of this made me feel better that it was normal to hang on to baby weight for a while and if my clothing didn't fit, well I hadn't failed.

Don't expect to bounce back within a few weeks or months. Some people do, but lots of people don't. There's a wide range of normal and you just need to eat healthy and keep up some light exercise but try not to worry about it too much. Just focus on your baby and doing fun stuff together. Once your baby gets older and is more mobile you'll be chasing him/her around and the weight will come off faster! :)  Personally, I bought some cheap (larger) clothes that I could wear while I was losing the weight so I didn't feel like none of my clothes fit. Having nice clothes that fit me well even though I was a bit bigger really helped my self esteem."

beyondthebump,3dwb8p,happyhapsy,2,Mon Jul 20 16:20:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure there is a ""normal"" since everyone loses weight differently. I lost half of my baby weight (40 pound gain, 20 pounds lost) in the first 2 weeks, but it's stalled out since. I imagine it will stay at this weight until I can exercise again. I read somewhere that BFing only helps you initially lose weight in the sense that it's using up the extra fluid in your body from pregnancy/delivery. After that, it torches through calories which can either help you burn fat or makes you ravenously hungry, like me.   I'm trying to be patient about losing the weight. I was obese a few years ago and gave myself a year to lose 50 pounds. I think it's fair to give myself 9 months to lose 40."

beyondthebump,3dwb8p,Juliet11,2,Mon Jul 20 03:19:10 2015 UTC,"I have always struggled with my weight. I like to be at the 130-135 range which is the high end of healthy weight for my height (5'1""). But I was 147 when I got pregnant, which is the heaviest I had ever let myself get. I really wish I was at a healthier weight when I got pregnant. But what can you do? The last time I weighed myself before giving birth via c-section, I was 189. A 42 pound gain!! My doctors were on my case with my weight the entire time. But my legs were so swollen and I was so exhausted all the time, I literally didn't want to do anything but lay in bed.   A few days after coming home from the hospital, I weighed my self and had lost 11lbs. And then a few days later I weighed myself again and lost 11 more pounds! I was losing all the water I retained. I got to the 160 range really fast. I was happy to lose 29lbs in such little time(less than a month) and without even trying! But my stomach definitely had extra skin and looked deflated. I wanted to give my skin time to tighten and I was recovering from C-Section anyway and wasn't cleared to exercise until 2 months postpartum. So I continued to do nothing. And I stayed at 160lbs for the next month. So I was stuck at 13lbs over pre-pregnancy weight and 25-30lbs overweight.   Right now I'm also 11 weeks postpartum. This last week, my little one has been very demanding and I have a hard time doing anything other than entertain her while she's awake. So I eat breakfast when she goes down for a nap around mid-morning. During the day before my husband gets home, I can't manage to eat more than quick snacks. Like protein bars and fruit. Then I'll eat dinner when hubby's home. So I'm basically skipping a meal and I'm breastfeeding. I'm also carrying a 13lb+ baby around most the day. I was happy to step on the scale and see that I'm at 158.6!! Finally broke the 160 mark. From here on out it's slow and steady. I have 11.6lbs until I'm at prepregancy weight but 23.6 before I'm at a healthy weight.   I still cannot wear 95% of my clothes. The only jeans I can wear are my maternity jeans, but they don't stay up on my non-pregnant belly. None of my shirts can handle my DD's when I was a B cup when I bought them. And I never had a gut and a lot of my shirts are not very flattering on my new shape. I tried walking but it's like 90 degrees outside most days and it's been raining almost everyday. My husband and I set up a basketball hoop and tried to set up a volleyball net to play outside, problem is we can't both be out and leave LO alone and it's not very fun playing by yourself. I bought a hula hoop though! And I do manage to play with that every once in a while. It's one way to squeeze some exercise in between the small windows of time I have. I'm trying to get in the groove of doing some core work outs but I'm not doing a good job. I need to crack down and do it.   Right now my overall goal is to try to stay away from junk, eat more veggies and drink more water. And to try to exercise with the hula hoop a few times a day and do some core exercises 5 days a week (like sit-ups, squats, planks). These are things I can do in the house and without taking up too much time, because there's not much time to do anything with a baby. (Not to mention that I work 10 hours a week and am homeschooling my little brother.) I just want to be able to wear my clothes again.

beyondthebump,3dwb8p,twistyabbazabba,7,Mon Jul 20 06:23:11 2015 UTC,Downvote for you for being the comment police.  OP asked whether losing the weight quickly was normal.  For some people like /u/Juliet11 it is.  What only people who gained 30 lbs and haven't lost it 1 year out should comment?
beyondthebump,3dwb8p,AHusbandAnd2Cats,4,Mon Jul 20 13:13:33 2015 UTC,So only responses that say it took months or years to lose the baby weight are acceptable on here ?

I think that it was hard to lose the weight because of the demands of having a baby! I was snacking all the time but not really eating good meals.  So I ate more at night and ate foods that were convenient. Things that helped me were menu planning and meal prep. I also make an effort to at least take her for a walk every day.

I was at 140 to start, stayed at 175 for a while then the last 2 weeks went up to 186!!!!! That was mostly  fluid from preeclampsia though.  I'm now at 142 and 11 weeks out. I breastfeed and I don't have time to work out. I was on bed rest the first 6 weeks!  Since I was immobile though I had to be very conscious of what I ate. Stick to real serving sizes (so 1 cup of cereal, not the whole bowl). Don't buy processed foods as much. So instead of sugary oatmeal packets, just get raw oatmeal. Even if you add some sugar or honey it will be better than the packets. When I want a snack get a piece of fruit or veggies. I'm a big fan of green beans, avocado, sweet potato, spinach. I got a juicer so one meal a day is usually a fresh veggie and fruit  juice. One apple sweetens the carrot/kale/beet juice incredibly well. I don't have store bought juice, no soda, nothing to drink except water and occasionally milk. If I have a big glass of milk I count that as a meal also, like for dinner. For snacks yogurt is good. Yogurt with shredded flaxseed will keep you full for a long time. I'm also a fan of walnuts. They are calorie dense but a handful can keep me full until the next meal instead of eating chips or something and it's a good fat."

It slowly went down to 160 or so once I became more active and I was hauling the baby around town more. At about 155 I got serious and knew it wasn't going to just fall off with a bit of exercise. I'm now tracking everything I eat, exercising 6x a week, and have made different short term goals.

We didn't sleep for over 42 hours. I really wish I was joking. Everytime she latched, she got a mouth full of blood from my scabbed up nipples. No creams or nipple shields worked. All the LC I called thought I was being over dramatic. No one believed how bad it was.   Turns out she had a horrible tongue tie, a upper and lower lip ties. My nipples are scared and have no feeling in them anymore.   First time she had formula; she drank all 2 ozs. And slept for 3 hours. She was so hungry and tired.  I tried pumping, but I never made enough, and what little I did make, made her gassy.   So I said fuck it. And stopped pumping around week 4. Why would I make things so hard on myself for nothing?  She just turned one. She's never had a fever, and we have a great bond. She's in the 97% for everything. I've never had to deal with marathon feedings. Everyone in the house can take turns feeding her so I could shower. I really don't feel like 'I missed out' on anything.   If I have a second child, I probably won't try breastfeeding. I really feel my nipples are to damaged. I have scars on both of them :/   Online forums? For me I said fuck em.  I can find a website that says water is poison if I look hard enough, shit there's websites that would call me a horrible mother because my child gets her shots.

No one told me that they feed on demand, whether that's 15 minutes later, or an hour or whatever. Or what ""demand"" looked like. Here I was trying to feed every two hours, and my supply was nearly nonexistent. Combine that with a very tired, very hungry 5 day old and I was so glad to have a sample can in the pantry.

Sad to hear that some people would consider it ""breaking down"" but shit, when you've had three hours of sleep combined in a 72 hour period because your child is starving and miserable, well to each their own but I say there's nothing wrong with ""giving in"" to formula if that's going to ease some stress and anxiety. Sometimes breastfeeding doesn't work out and when it doesn't it's nice to have the formula ready to go."
beyondthebump,3dw1d1,twistyabbazabba,4,Mon Jul 20 06:32:41 2015 UTC,"Since you can't return it in most cases, only exchange (if not all cases, I'm not too sure) I would rely on samples if you are worried about ""giving in"" or wasting. We needed to supplement because baby was dropping pounds and my milk hadn't come in yet at Day 5. So it was extremely helpful to have some of the samples handy so that we didn't have to run out with a 5 day old after our first ped visit to grab some. But I haven't needed to use it since and don't feel as bad that I may potentially waste an open can because 1. it was small to start with. 2. I didn't pay for it."

It was very comforting for me and I still have it around just out of sentimentality now."
beyondthebump,3dw1d1,Say_Meow,3,Mon Jul 20 16:50:34 2015 UTC,"Disagree! Super helpful to have. My LO was a master latcher on the hospital and somehow forgot how to do it by the time we were home. Stressed momma + starving baby =/= BF success. What ended up working was giving her just a tiny bit of formula to take the edge off and then putting her right on the boob. Even if you're BF just fine, you might just want a short break at some point. Ideally, you'll have pumped and can use expressed milk, but keep your options open for yourself!  Also don't forget the bottled water for the formula."
beyondthebump,3dw1d1,entailments,2,Mon Jul 20 07:42:22 2015 UTC,"The supply issues some women have makes formula a necessity, even if it's just for the short term. Emergencies come up too, and it can be nice to have formula on hand in the event that there is no extra breast milk available or mom cannot give milk (accident/injury/bad illness, unexpected business trip, unexpected travel for any reason). Just one less thing to think about in a possibly stressful situation.  I had a collection of several dozen ready to feed bottle samples and a dozen powder samples, and I'm very glad I did because my milk took forever to come in and the LC wanted me to supplement for a few weeks. It was either supplement or have baby readmitted to the hospital with iv nutrition. I'm very glad I had that formula already. Made me feel better knowing it was there, and I didn't need to spend hours debating over which brand or format to use or how much to buy or worry about the cost or take a very hungry, unhappy infant into a grocery store, I just had to grab one from my basement."

The one nearest us didn't, which she informed me as I pulled into their parking lot.   The next one away did, but they were closing in five minutes. I put the coals to it and got there just as the manager was walking up to lock the door. As I hustled past the customer service desk, the girl working there called out, ""Hey! New dad??"". She had already pulled the item and rung it up for me. I paid and scooted home and our squiddo slept in that thing, between two parents, for her first four months or so."
beyondthebump,3dw1d1,polydad,2,Mon Jul 20 12:11:00 2015 UTC,I had a similar one and tried to use it with just myself in the bed while my husband was deployed after daughter's birth.  As you can expect....does not work with only one person in the bed....I was disappointed but I'm glad to see that it actually would have been worth it if my hubby was there to counteract my side of the bed making the bassinet lean my way.   I ended up reselling it and just let her sleep in the bed with me until about 3 months when I got her to sleep in her crib.  I love your epic race to purchase though!

I actually work 1-3 hours a day from home as well, so I do more than your husband. I am exhausted by the time my husband gets home. So he does take her as soon as he gets settled and I take a break. BUT I take her back at some point. During the times that we're both home, we split responsibilities equally. You deserve a break at some point. And a break is more than 10 minutes. Yes, with you working, your husband is going to spend more time with her. Overall, he will watch her more than you. But that's his role in your household as the SAHP. You shouldn't feel guilty for wanting a break. It sounds like you're constantly working/taking care of baby that you can't enjoy your time with her. Whenever you get home, he should give you 30 minutes or so to get settled and then you can take over for an hour or so. But then he needs to give you a break to do something on your own. And you guys definitely need to spend time together as a family. Like play with the baby together or watch a show while snuggling the baby or something."

I work from home so I do the majority of baby and household stuff, but when my husband comes home he will spend time with the baby so I can cook dinner and do dishes. He'll also take the baby to his parents' or brother's house for a few hours on the weekend sometimes so I can catch up on work. Does your husband take care of the household stuff other than childcare? I agree that taking care of a child all day is exhausting, but so is working full time.

beyondthebump,3dvpz6,KimberSliceAZDD,4,Sun Jul 19 23:14:01 2015 UTC,"Read up on safe co-sleeping for tips. We have a ""co-sleeper"" that sits in the bed with us.   You could try babywearing to get chores done around the house. And putting the baby down for a little bit to get a shower isn't unreasonable, sometimes you have to let then fuss a little bit to take care of yourself.   If you don't have one, think about getting a used soothing chair (idk what they're called but they vibrate) or a swing, they can be life savers. I put my son in one, set the timer for however long I needed (20-30min) and knock out chores or get a much needed shower."
beyondthebump,3dvpz6,Dannniiiii,5,Mon Jul 20 14:24:46 2015 UTC,"This. The little co-sleeper that goes into the bed was the only way I was able to get up and do anything. I would get him to sleep, lay him in it, and lay my hand on his belly until he was in deep sleep...then I peaced out. It had mesh on the sides so if he rolled, which he didn't at that time, he could still breathe perfectly. Peace of mind!"
beyondthebump,3dvpz6,Bear_Mustache,3,Sun Jul 19 23:33:13 2015 UTC,How old is your baby? Is he/she rolling yet? I pretty much do exactly the same as you have described. If I wake up before him I leave him in he bed in the middle with a pillow on either side of the edges of the bed. He isn't rolling yet and he is in a swaddled sleep sack. He doesn't budge an inch and I can brush my teeth and get some breakfast before he wakes up for his own breakfast.
beyondthebump,3dvpz6,FoxenTheSnow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:56:05 2015 UTC,"She's 2.5 months, not rolling yet, but can easily wiggle her way across the bed, even when swaddled. I'm scared she'll wiggle her way to the edge or roll over for the first time on the bed, and either fall off, or suffocate in the pillows."
beyondthebump,3dvpz6,FoxenTheSnow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:44:37 2015 UTC,I would probably just put the mattresss on the floor then and forgo the pillows. That way if she does roll herself off she will only fall over a couple of inches instead of a couple of feet.
beyondthebump,3dvpz6,piandicecream,2,Mon Jul 20 14:23:42 2015 UTC,We put the baby monitor next to her with a few pillows so I have time to grab her before she rolls off.
beyondthebump,3dvpz6,tolietduck,5,Mon Jul 20 14:59:17 2015 UTC,"She's more independent than you think. Make sure there are no pillows/blankets near her in the bed and leave her there. If she's old enough to roll, build a pillow fort at least a foot away from her."
beyondthebump,3dvpz6,bonjourtabby,15,Mon Jul 20 09:52:01 2015 UTC,"Pillow fort isn't really a good idea. It's a suffocation hazard for one, and for another, the baby might be able to roll the pillows off the bed and then fall (ask me how I know.)"

beyondthebump,3dvr7o,maybeitsapony,4,Sun Jul 19 23:05:58 2015 UTC,I'd start pumping and making a freezer stock! Especially since you're making an oversupply. You never know when that extra might come in handy!
beyondthebump,3dvr7o,gillybtbump,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:12:34 2015 UTC,"I also have an oversupply (this is my second kid, but I had the same issue with my first). This time I haven't pumped at all, the first time I pumped semi-regularly, but I was also plagued with mastitis - I got it 4 times - so I am trying a less 'stimulating' approach now. If you don't want to pump you could always go with an emergency bottle of formula to leave at the sitter's place - it's only 2 hours, baby might start to get hungry again by then but probably not. You would know their schedule best.  I regularly go to 1 hour gym classes. I take this baby with me, because the classes accommodate that, and he is super calm and doesn't make a fuss. With the first I used to just leave her at her grandparents for 2 hours, feed her before I left and then when I got home. I never left her with a regular bottle, it was never a big problem. I think they had one or two frozen bottles of breastmilk for emergencies. Maybe once or twice she was a little antsy by pickup time."
beyondthebump,3dvr7o,SouthgateJenny,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:36:20 2015 UTC,"He was 10 days old when I left him for the first time with my MIL, so quite young. I had to go WAYYY out to have my doctor check my incision for infection; as it was late, my husband wanted to go with me. We were gonna about 3 hours and I was on pins and needles the whole time. I hated it.  I didn't have a choice because of hospital complications, but my son was on the bottle the first 2 days of his life. We took another week to establish breastfeeding because he would cry when it came to latching; he just wanted the bottle. Eventually, he was on both at the same time and we never had problems with nipple confusion. He still, 8 months later, gladly eats from both.  I would advise starting to practice with a bottle. Offer it, see what baby does. If he starts fussing, offer a boob. Eventually, baby will notice both serve the same function and he may warm up to a bottle (this is assuming he doesn't take to it right away, which he may).   At only 5 weeks out too, your body is still establishing things. The first month or two all I did was drip milk. I didn't even bother sleeping with a shirt on...I just put a towel down. That leveled off around month 2 and now I don't even leak.   I agree with the others: take advantage of that oversupply and start freezing. My extra stash has been sent to Milkin' Mamas."

I was gone 4 hours for class and she was just fine. I didn't need to leave my second til he was three weeks old and was gone for 8 hours to help in-laws move. I think as long as you have food prepared, are emotionally ready, and have someone you trust to babysit. It would be a good idea to try feeding with a bottle so they have experience. Mine were both easy to feed by bottle and breast but some refuse change."
beyondthebump,3dvr7o,InnocentHeathy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:54:31 2015 UTC,"I left my LO with her grandmother for maybe 2-3 hours when she was 2 months old and then left her again for like 5 hours a few days later. First time was so hubby and I can go out to a nice restaurant. Second time was to see a concert of my favorite singer from childhood. It was her last tour so I couldn't miss it.   I breastfeed and had an oversupply as well. I was squirting LO in the face, painful engorged boobs, soaking shirts and bras. I took my bra off one time and milk just started pouring out, like it looked like I just took a bottle and dumped it on the ground. My solution was actually to pump between feedings and store the extra milk. That way my husband could feed the baby anytime I needed a break. Eventually my supply evened out even though I was pumping. I think that was because my husband was bottle feeding her my expressed milk a lot so I wasn't producing that much more than she was drinking. Actually I started to slack on pumping and started to lose my supply, but I started pumping every two hours until I got back on track. Now I only pump once or twice a day and usually she ends up drinking a bottle once a day so I'm not really adding to my stored milk anymore, just maintaining it. I have probably a day and a half supply in the freezer.   Anyway, I have enough stored milk and LO had been used to drinking expressed milk from a bottle ever since she was a week old. So I had no problem leaving her with her grandmother. I would definitely suggest practicing on the bottle. You probably will just need to pump before you leave so if LO gets hungry he won't have to wait until you return. And sometimes he might not even drink it and you can work on building a storage. I wouldn't risk leaving LO without anything."

beyondthebump,3dvr7o,whiskeyjane45,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:17:38 2015 UTC,"I left my baby for the first time when she was 2.5 months old with my parents for 4 days. My husband had bought tickets to a music festival before I knew we were pregnant and he convinced me that the break would be good for me and you know what? It was 3 glorious nights of not waking every 2-3 hours. Even though I was still getting up early, I was getting better sleep. She was only 30 minutes down the road, so if anything happened or if I needed my baby fix, I wasn't far. I've always struggled to have enough milk and my supply goes down extremely easily so I have to pump regularly. I would get about 2 extra ounces a day so I started putting that in the freezer as soon as I got the pump. By the time it came to leave her with my parents, I had one extra day of milk.   My baby had to be supplemented with formula because she was a preemie and was having growth issues (this did not help my struggle with my supply) so she was used to a bottle. If you have established breast feeding, I would definitely get her used to a bottle first. You don't want to leave her with someone, only to find out she won't take the bottle. It may take a few days to get used to it. Since you have an oversupply, it might be good to give her a bottle and pump to make up for the missed feeding instead of pumping extra and risking your body making even more milk. This will also let you get in that practice with the bottle.   It's good to get a break, even if it's only an hour or two. Your baby may not even be hungry by the time you get back, but it's good to have that milk, just in case. You may not have a chance to feed before you leave our she may be cluster feeding and want to eat earlier, you just never know.   For more info on pumping, you should check out kellymom.com. There is a fun of info on nursing and pumping."

I think they recommend introducing a bottle relatively early (once breastfeeding is going well) so your LO gets used to it and doesn't refuse it (I haven't actually introduced a bottle yet). I had pretty crazy oversupply for a while so I waited until my milk settled down (he had a ton of green poops for a while). I try to pump once in the morning (because my boobs are full) after he eats. So I just get the left overs. Sometimes I get 2 oz, sometimes I only get 0.5. If I only get 0.5 I try to pump some more later in the day or just add two pumped quantities together to freeze. My LO is pretty inconsistent in his eating. Some days he is super hungry and some days he eats a bit less..  Good luck!"

We were supposed to be at my grandma's at 1. Baby went down for a nap at 11.

Without them I was at high risk for depressive and manic episodes. That's worse for the baby. But it all had risks. Without meds I became incapacitated and cried every day.  Now I have the baby and take my original meds. We're doing formula and donor milk.  She needs to talk to her doctor about the spectrum of options.
beyondthebump,3dwtzn,monkeyinprocess,3,Mon Jul 20 11:19:51 2015 UTC,"Therapist here. If she's going off meds, it's super important that she gets/stays in counseling. A good therapist can be a support and also teach her some tools to use during this time. (For example, cognitive behavioral therapy -CBT- and mindfulness exercises are a big help). Group it in with health care costs associated with pregnancy. Moms well being is the best thing she can give to baby at this point."

She likes to hit the play gym in the morning and she will do that  for about 30 minutes. Then she normally eats. After she eats I put her in her sit me up and she plays with the toys on there while I eat breakfast and get ready for my day. Then it's normally almost time for a nap. While she naps I clean or relax. When she wakes up we eat and then I'll get on the floor with her for tummy time. Then I'll let her swing for a little so I can eat lunch. Then nap time and we just kind of cycle through playing at the gym, the sit me up, and her swing.

Ours does a story time that's geared toward babies up to 12 months old and it's a great way to get us out of the house and socializing with other people.  We do the story time one morning a week, and one other morning a week I go to a neighborhood playgroup that meets up. It's more for the moms than the babies, but it's been fun to have a core group of moms and babies that we've known since they were a few months old. Check on your neighborhood website or Nextdoor if there is one, otherwise search Facebook or Meetup.com.  The other three mornings a week we go on walks, hang out inside if it's too hot, or we go to the gym where she hangs out in their childcare for 30-45 minutes while I work out (this didn't really work for us till she was 6 months old though, she would get too fussy)."

beyondthebump,3du5fd,Jacque336,2,Sun Jul 19 20:56:33 2015 UTC,"Finn is 15 months old, and we have ""entertainment stations"" throughout the house. We spend the early morning in bed, where he practices his chit chat. Once he gets a bit more energetic, I can move him out to the rest of the house. Quite a few of these allow for self-play, which is good for getting some chores done: -playmat with exercise bars (I put his feet where he can kick the bar/make the toys move) -entertainment chair + 1-2 toys -swing, do when he is winding down for a nap -bouncer, moved to wherever I am at the time -toy pit= the snoogle+the baby sitting up, legs buried in his his toys. I only use this when I'm sitting next to him, usually pumping  At any of those, I'll chat with him or play with his toys/sing/do funny voices, etc. The point, I think, is the variety of options, stimulation levels, and skills/muscles used that keep him entertained.   For the most part, holding/wearing him at this age is his favorite thing. Just letting him see new things makes him happy- a peek into the fridge, splashing his toes with water in the bathroom sink, etc.  I also find that taking him out is essential. Anywhere works, as long as he gets to observe the world. The park or the parking lot both work well. He loves waiting for appointments because we get to sit in a waiting room and practice standing, sitting, lap tummy time, meeting new people, etc. He just wants to see a wide variety.   On hot days, libraries, malls, etc. work as well. These are also places where people are more likely to come up to you and chat while you're sitting with a baby, so good for adult interaction! Finn also likes it if I put my calls on speakerphone."

I was 'prone to them' as a baby, I was also breastfed, but I had them CONSTANTLY, like 5+ by the time I was 6 months.  Babies get sick - get a cold, then the congestion gets to the ears and sometimes turns into an infection.  This is life, you're doing great!"
beyondthebump,3dwooo,AHusbandAnd2Cats,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:18:53 2015 UTC,"That's not so bad. I had ear infections a lot when I was a baby, like every other month. I had tubes placed three times and they stopped. To this day, however, when I get a cold or really bad allergies, my Eustachian tubes don't drain properly and I get clogged up for days."
beyondthebump,3dwooo,ummmmmmnope,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:48:33 2015 UTC,"Don't blame yourself!  It's common for little ones to get ear infections because their Eustachian tubes are not in the proper position for them to drain correctly yet.  It has absolutely nothing to do with you, it's just the way he's made!  Two infections in 11 months isn't bad at all.  The real issue is when the baby can't get over the infections or it's a constant cycle.  Example:  My little one got her first at 6 months old and it was a constant cycle until she was 9 1/2 months old when she got tubes.  Infection, antibiotic, off for 3 days, infection, antibiotic, off for 3 days, infection, etc.  That's where the real problem lies.  Infrequent infections aren't that big of a deal (even though suffering through them DOES suck).  Rest assured that if the infections become more frequent your pediatrician will recommend tubes.  And they can, for many babies and parents, be a real game-changer!"
beyondthebump,3dwooo,puckbunny51,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:58:14 2015 UTC,"You're probably doing nothing wrong. Some kids are just prone to them. My daughter got her first double ear infection at 7 months. We battled it for four months straight with antibiotic after antibiotic, but her ears never drained. We were in the doctor's office every other week. Her hearing was affected. I felt horrible, but all the doctors in her pediatric practice and the ENT assured me, some kids just get them. She ended up getting tubes before she was a year old. It took literally five minutes. Her ear infections never came back, and she hears perfectly. According to the ENT, her ear canals are tiny and just can't drain by themselves without the tubes, so she would have just kept getting infections without them. 2 ear infections in 11 months is really not that many. I'm sure nothing you are doing is causing them.    EDIT: She was also breastfed until a year old."

beyondthebump,3dtuir,freckledcupcake,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:05:13 2015 UTC,"My little guy was diagnosed with severe to critical Aortic Valve Stenosis with regurgitation when I was 34 weeks pregnant with him. His aortic valve, which should have three leaflets letting blood through like a one way door, has maybe one and a half leaflets trying to do the job (technically a bicuspid valve, but the doctors call it functionally unicuspid), which restricts the flow of blood through that valve, and causes some of the blood that's pushed through it to regurgitate, or flow backwards through the valve. He had a balloon valvuloplasty done when he was two days old, where they inserted a catheter in through a vein in his leg to break open his aortic valve to get more blood flow. He was in the cardiac ICU for a week and in the cardiac step-down unit for three days before we could take him home. He was on meds five times a day for about two months, but he's currently med-free.  He's 1yr 5mos now, and doing great, with his Stenosis/Regurgitation classified as moderate. He has regular visits to his pediatric cardiologist about every 2-3 months, where he has an EKG and an echocardiogram. I've been told that he will eventually need a valve replacement (and the younger he is when he has that done, the greater the chance that he will have to have more than one replacement surgery done in his lifetime because artificial valves don't grow with the recipient), but for right now, he's holding steady.  I have noticed that all of the pediatric cardiologists I've dealt with tend to be of the ""we don't want to fill you with false optimism or hope"" so they tend toward the dire in their predictions. That scared me at first, but I have sort of gotten used to it. They also realize that this is scary for parents, so everyone has been really good on explaining things clearly and encouraging me to ask any questions.  I made it a specific point to ask the hospital where my son had his surgery done for his medical records - sometimes asking a doctor directly can get around the fees some hospitals charge for copying medical records. I have three copies of these records - one scanned into PDF format on our computer so I can email it to a medical office, one paper copy in our fire-proof safe, and one paper copy in a three-ring binder.   I'm kind of compulsive on having our family's medical paperwork organized (ex medical receptionist and currently non-practicing nurse here!), so I already have folders for both of my sons with a copy of the birth certificate, immunization records, copy of our insurance cards, etc. My younger son's folder also has copies of his current cardiology visit notes (the pediatric cardiology office sends them to each patient after each visit). The cardiology office should be sending these notes to your pediatrician anyway, but I like to have a current copy in case you want to ask/share something with the pediatrician.    I also have a thirty-second ""elevator speech"" memorized that sums up his medical history. I sometimes have trouble thinking or talking straight if I'm scared or nervous, so this helps if I have to explain his medical history to a doctor or nurse in an emergency. Again, I'm compulsive about these kinds of things, but I also have a ten-second set of directions to my house memorized so that if the worst happens and I have to call 911, I won't have to worry about stuttering when I'm giving directions...but I already had this memorized for my older son, who doesn't have a heart problem.  Good luck, and I hope your son gets and stays healthy!"

beyondthebump,3dv8wt,nncydrw,7,Sun Jul 19 20:21:48 2015 UTC,"I let my son fuss when I needed to do something else (e.g. use the bathroom) or if we were sleeping and I wasn't sure if he was waking up or not.  In general, though, I tried to hold him as much as possible if he seemed at all unhappy as a newborn.  Newborns can't really self soothe, so I don't think you can expect him to so.  Once he was about 4-5 months old, I knew he could calm himself a bit so I would let him fuss a little before naps or bedtime, but I personally didn't let him cry-cry and still don't."
beyondthebump,3dv8wt,IveCreatedAMuenster,2,Sun Jul 19 20:28:22 2015 UTC,us too!
beyondthebump,3dv8wt,lacyjanec,3,Sun Jul 19 20:50:39 2015 UTC,"We were the same as this. No way would we have let her cry or whinge/grizzle when we were able to help her. If I was on my own, I would generally wait till she was asleep to do things I needed to do, or else pop her in a stretchy wrap."
beyondthebump,3dv8wt,fernyfantastic,11,Sun Jul 19 21:20:09 2015 UTC,"I'll go ahead and say that I was very clingy with my baby at the newborn stage. For the first 3 months I barely put her down. Only to go use the restroom, go in the carseat, or when I passed her off to someone else. As soon as a whimper started I started shushing and calming her, she never really got to the point of full out crying except in her carseat (she never has really liked it, but at least now the crying has stopped during every car ride.) Everyone told me how spoiled she would become by me holding her, but it's what I felt I needed to do. Now she will 9 months old soon and barely let's me hold her, I only yet to hold her when she gets frustrated with something, or she gets scared, or just needs a snuggle. We coslept (snuggle style, belly to belly) for 8 months and now she refuses night time snuggles. At around 4 months I started putting her down a bit, then she started rolling and exploring and that's when she didn't want cuddles at much.  I say if it works for you, do it. You cannot spoil an infant as they don't understand manipulations and expectations yet. They cannot self sooth for a bit so while fussing may be temporary and stop on its own it also may not. I know lots of snuggle time doesn't work for everyone, but for me I thought of along the lines of ""She was in my belly for 40 weeks hearing my hearbeat, she should be able to have the opportunity to still hear it and know that while her surroundings have changed her mommy is still the same."""
beyondthebump,3dv8wt,celest3alove,3,Sun Jul 19 21:26:45 2015 UTC,"This! I held my son a lot when he was a newborn. I always got critized that I was spoiling him. But now at 6.5 months, he never wants to just be held because hes exploring the world by trying to crawl, rolling, sitting up. The only time I get snuggles is when he's napping in my arms."
beyondthebump,3dv8wt,runn24x,3,Mon Jul 20 02:28:51 2015 UTC,"I'll let my girl fuss if I'm finishing something that can't be delayed or setting up to nurse her. I'll also let het fuss a bit at night to see if she's really waking up or not. At first, I was grabbing her every time she'd make a peep and neither of us were getting much sleep."

beyondthebump,3dv8wt,KimberSliceAZDD,2,Mon Jul 20 00:48:32 2015 UTC,When my baby was a newborn we pretty much always picked him up when he was fussing. Although he never really let us put him down to begin with. I think it was around 2-3 months that we started to let him fuss a bit.
beyondthebump,3dv8wt,aintnonames,2,Sun Jul 19 20:58:05 2015 UTC,I always pick him up if he's fussy or crying and he's 8 weeks today!
beyondthebump,3dv8wt,skunka,2,Sun Jul 19 21:08:11 2015 UTC,"A newborn can't calm themselves down. If your newborn is soothed by you holding them, that's GREAT. Do it. Hold them as much as you can!! Get a carrier or a sling and wear that baby everywhere! I have a baby who doesn't seem to like being held most of the time and it's a bummer, especially when she's upset and my instinct is to hold or cuddle her."
beyondthebump,3dv8wt,bonkyubonbon,2,Mon Jul 20 06:47:00 2015 UTC,"It depends. If the fuss is a release for them to fall asleep and seems to be helping them wind down, I say leave them be. Sometimes my daughter would just yell and make noises until she fell asleep but she wasn't really crying or upset, she was just sort of fighting sleep and if I let her go, she'd pass out. Other times, you can tell the crying is escalating and they need to be settled by mom."
beyondthebump,3dv8wt,I_just_ate_guacamole,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:56:17 2015 UTC,I let him fuss if I have to do something that can't wait or if he's having tummy time. But otherwise he generally stays in someone's arms if he's fussing because he isn't yet able to self soothe.
beyondthebump,3dv8wt,takibi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:01:48 2015 UTC,"A newborn isn't going to calm themselves. Sorry. If you take care of them while they fuss, they may not have a need to graduate to full blown crying. A newborn is very needy but it's a short life stage. Congrats!"
beyondthebump,3dv8wt,nooblers,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:31:05 2015 UTC,"Sometimes my son will fuss in his sleep while passing stool, gas or whatever. He calms down and I don't need to wake him up.  If he's awake, I either nurse or change him. Seldom its anything else but if it is, usually he just wants to be held. I don't believe in leaving a lonely baby alone unless I REALLY have to do something (finish cooking that pancake, use the toilet).   I don't believe in ""oh just let them cry"". I believe that them crying will cause adrenaline and corisal to spike in our blood, causing more unnhappiness and health problems later on. But if I absolutely need to finish something, he wont die from 5 minutes of tears."
beyondthebump,3dv8wt,SeaStar96,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:46:11 2015 UTC,"We would let her fuss a little at bedtime from nearly the beginning. I don't mean cry, but just noise and squirming and a little fussing. We'd usually rock her in her bassinet and more often than not she'd fall asleep quickly. I'm not sure if we just got lucky with an easy sleeper or if being slightly ""hands off"" with fussiness helped, but she's been able to self soothe from a really young age. But, most of the time when she was very little we were holding her anyways. So it was mostly just at bedtime that we'd let her fuss, and then at maybe 3 months old when she started taking naps in her bassinet instead of the swing or on me."
beyondthebump,3du04c,wifemothervegan,51,Sun Jul 19 13:26:31 2015 UTC,"The only part of this that the bride gets to have a opinion on is whether or not you bring the baby to the actual wedding. What you decide with your parents in terms of childcare is none of her business. That said, baby will be fine on mostly solids for a day. Will she take water and other liquids from a sippy cup or a bottle? Will you need to go pump anyway? Having her in the hotel but with your parents seems like a great compromise."
beyondthebump,3du04c,xboxwidow,10,Sun Jul 19 13:37:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this. It is exactly what I was feeling. And yes, I would have to go pump anyways so in my mind it's actually easier to go feed her instead."
beyondthebump,3du04c,risorius12,16,Sun Jul 19 15:48:47 2015 UTC,Your friend just doesn't get it and that is OK. You have to do what feels best for your kid.
beyondthebump,3du04c,bonjourtabby,2,Sun Jul 19 15:05:57 2015 UTC,"I think even once she does have kids, we will differ in our parenting styles. I think she's the type to let the kid go without for 8+ hours (which is what my LO will do) until she does take the bottle/sippy."
beyondthebump,3du04c,ummmmmmnope,21,Sun Jul 19 15:49:59 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a great solution, and how nice of your parents to offer to do that! Your friend doesn't know what she's talking about. You're getting the best of both worlds here...you can enjoy the wedding and still pop in to feed and see your baby when you want to."
beyondthebump,3du04c,kayteedee,2,Sun Jul 19 14:03:23 2015 UTC,I have a great mom! I think she could see that this was something I really wanted to attend. She's always a wonderful support.
beyondthebump,3du04c,twistyabbazabba,17,Sun Jul 19 15:52:46 2015 UTC,"What does your gut tell you to do? Do what YOU feel is right for you and your babe. The bride can say no babies at the wedding but she can't tell you what to do with him while he's not there. I would be more relaxed, personally, with my baby nearby if he didn't take bottles. That said - will she take a sippy or straw cup? Or maybe she would drink it from a regular cup?"
beyondthebump,3du04c,bonjourtabby,5,Sun Jul 19 13:33:29 2015 UTC,"My gut tells me to do exactly what we are doing! I think I'd rather our first night away be not related to such a big event so that if we need to come home early or be more available via phone, we can. She does take a sippy cup with a straw for water but still won't really drink the milk. She'll take a few sips and that's it."
beyondthebump,3du04c,bonjourtabby,7,Sun Jul 19 15:51:21 2015 UTC,Don't change your plans! My husband and I recently did something similar for a military ball because I didn't feel comfortable to leave baby with grandparents overnight. We were able to relax and have a good time knowing baby was close by if she needed me.
beyondthebump,3du04c,MrsFunner,2,Sun Jul 19 15:19:56 2015 UTC,This is great to hear. Thank you for making me feel more secure in my decision.
beyondthebump,3du04c,MrsFunner,8,Sun Jul 19 15:53:17 2015 UTC,"You're the mom, you do what you think is best for your baby. Me personally, I'd want mine nearby, then again my baby is not quite two months old and the thought of being out of town away from him gives me anxiety. But especially with yours not taking a bottle, I'd have her nearby. Your friend needs to worry about herself and the wedding and quit worrying about where your baby is for the day. For some reason this really irritates me!!!!"
beyondthebump,3du04c,kaseyyeaaah,6,Sun Jul 19 13:39:22 2015 UTC,"Me too! Like does her friend think that having the baby at the HOTEL will somehow affect her wedding? Maybe she's just totally clueless about parenting or something...I can understand not wanting babies at the wedding (we had a child-free wedding too), but you're crazy if you think you can dictate how your friends work out the babysitting."
beyondthebump,3du04c,cmcg1227,5,Sun Jul 19 14:06:08 2015 UTC,I think my friends just miss me overall. They are still quite the partiers (and yes... I use to be one too) but life has changed. The fact is I'm not going to be hanging out getting smashed all weekend like I might have 2 years ago!
beyondthebump,3du04c,momonomicon,4,Sun Jul 19 15:55:26 2015 UTC,"Sometimes my friends show the same kind of cluelessness. They'll invite us out to the bar at night, after our son's bedtime, and with no pre-planning so no babysitter set up. I guess if you have no experience with kids it doesn't occur to you that someone with a baby has a different lifestyle! It's not like we can't still have fun, but we need some advance notice and there are some things we won't be able to do for a little while."
beyondthebump,3dsdb1,BuzzBuzzSnipSnip,24,Sun Jul 19 00:12:28 2015 UTC,"I hate being asked about his schedule. Maybe I suck at this, but we don't HAVE a schedule. We have a kinda routine that only works maybe 60% of the days.  It makes me feel like a shitty mom :-/ Like everyone elses baby was sleeping through the night and taking 3 naps and going to bed at 7:30 by this point."
beyondthebump,3dsdb1,TankSpank,3,Sun Jul 19 01:32:55 2015 UTC,"Seriously? With a 2 month old? 60% of the days is pretty fucking amazing. At that point, our ""routine"" was completely nonexistent and we were all in survival mode."
beyondthebump,3dsdb1,dls2317,6,Sun Jul 19 13:26:23 2015 UTC,"I've never kept a schedule. My son sleeps whenever the heck he wants to sleep. Yesterday he took two one-hour long naps and went to bed at 7:30. Today he took two hour long naps, one two-hour nap, and went to sleep at 9:30. I don't worry about it. He lets me know when he's tired and gets plenty of sleep each day."
beyondthebump,3dsdb1,MrsCharmander,6,Sun Jul 19 02:09:54 2015 UTC,"That sounds like me! If she's hungry, she eats. If she's tired, she goes to sleep. Her body is setting the schedule, not me! She's not in day care and school is many years away. She has here own schedule, and it works just fine."

Just last week she decided 5 am is a great time for her morning blowout, thankfully those early morning waking are done, and now the last few days she's been going to sleep past ten.

I wish I could have him on a schedule but we can't. And the people that ask about his dang schedule are the people that KNOW the situation and that we don't have one. Drives me nuts.
beyondthebump,3dsdb1,whiskeywishes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:13:53 2015 UTC,"We're at 7.5 mos and no schedule. The only thing remotely routine is I wake him up at 6 during the week, and he goes to bed around 7. On the weekends, he sometimes wakes around 7. Sometimes he sttn, mostly he's up once a night to eat (never seems to be the same time). He usually can't stay up longer than 2 hours, but sometimes, he will stay up 3 hours, or sometimes he wants to nap after only being up an hour. I just try to go by his cues.   I hate being told constantly that his bedtime is too early. This is only told to me by older family members. Other moms, moms I've talked to on here, my pedi, and any info I've read online all say his bedtime is perfectly normal."
beyondthebump,3dsdb1,appletoozler,8,Sun Jul 19 13:35:32 2015 UTC,"My standard answer is ""with his eyes closed."" Then if they look confused I ask if that's how they themselves usually sleep or if I'm doing it wrong."
beyondthebump,3dsdb1,I_RunWithScissors,16,Sun Jul 19 07:14:40 2015 UTC,"It's not the question. It's the tone.   When my mom asks how he sleeps it's cool. She's genuinely asking how we're doing.   When my ex's friends/other moms I'm not close with ask anything about him in that tone. That time where you know that they're judging and that they're going to give you unsolicited advice... I want to scream.  No. I didn't do babywise. No. I don't want to do babywise. So. No. My baby does not sleep through the night. He wakes up 3ish times to eat. Because my parenting style is different. I co-sleep to accommodate that, I'm very happy for you that your baby was sleeping alone at 1 week old. I know that that meant a lot to you to have your own bed and space.   No. I don't want to try supplementing with formula ""just once a night"" because I don't want to end up tanking my supply. That you weren't very attached to breastfeeding is fine. Your baby is healthy. She sleeps through the night and she eats mostly formula.  My baby is also healthy. He doesn't sleep through the night and he's breastfed. He eats when he damn wants to. Just like I eat when I want to.  I don't judge you. I don't offer you advice about how you could boost your milk supply to reestablish breastfeeding full time. I don't link you to contradictory articles about babies on schedules.  I know you're happy with your schedule and your formula, I know that's what's working for you.   It's your baby. Raise her the way you want to AND LEAVE ME THE THE FUCK ALONE TO RAISE MINE THE WAY I WANT TO.  /rant."
beyondthebump,3dsdb1,bnm3424,5,Sun Jul 19 03:33:34 2015 UTC,100% agree about the tone. There are people who ask how the baby is sleeping or how he is doing & it's 100% genuine. Others however just ask to look like they care or want to start telling me what they did with their kids. The tone difference is so obvious it's annoying & I can feel my neck tense up every time.
beyondthebump,3dsdb1,SandrasUsername,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:27:43 2015 UTC,"I guess what gets me is the tone and then that they seem to assume I'm unhappy. When I say he doesn't sleep through the night or that I co-sleep they automatically start talking about babywise or sleep training... Or dropping his comfort feed.  I don't want to.  I'm not unhappy. I chose this. My baby will only be a baby for so long. I'm going to be selfish and enjoy every second I can. I'm happy. I like hearing him breathe or feeling him move against me and why not comfort him? If he needs a feed for comfort then why deny him?  Someday, I will move him into his own bed. Someday, he'll night ween. Someday he won't be my little nursing. Why rush it?"
beyondthebump,3dsdb1,bnm3424,4,Mon Jul 20 03:54:57 2015 UTC,"Yessss ugh I ranted the other day to my husband about how what we're doing isn't broken (baby is super happy, we are happy, everyone sleeps well) so WHY does my mother always try to fix it?? She is obsessed with babywise but I am pretty much an attachment parent all the way. He sleeps in a bassinet next to our bed and I'm about to upgrade him to a minicrib in our room because he's outgrown it. He nurses on demand. We don't have a strict schedule. And my mom is always like ""when are you moving him out of your room? You'll sleep better!"" And I'm like MOM. I am sleeping great. I like him in our room. I don't want to move him yet. She also constantly asks me about his schedule, which is more like a loose guideline, ha. I do not have some kind of crazy schedule for him. I feed him when he's hungry. We play and stuff, but I don't do this eat play sleep thing. We're fine, it works for us, and we're really pretty stress-free as far as everything goes. But she won't leave it alone. I love her, and she is great, but this backseat parenting stuff is driving me nuts. I am really happy with the way I'm raising him, I'm not feeling guilt or worry about it, and I am not looking for advice, so please just let me do it the way we're doing it without trying to persuade me into doing it a completely different way that I have consciously and deliberately decided against."
beyondthebump,3dsdb1,jjjanuary,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:42:17 2015 UTC,"Our schedule is the same way. He skips naps, he naps longer later in the day when he does.  He gets all the sleep he needs, he's gaining weight, he's happy, I'm happy.  I just want to tell people to kindly butt out.  I'm sorry it's your mom though! I think my mom is so good because we're living with her and she sees my son every day. She knows that he's happy and healthy and she knows that I function.

beyondthebump,3dsdb1,fartist14,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:41:50 2015 UTC,I think that does have to do with why one of the moms I know is like that. Her mother and she got into a HUGE fight about the way she was raising her daughter (babywise) and I was the one who comforted her and told her that she was the parent and she was doing what worked best for her and her husband and her daughter and not to listen.   ...  So that the next week she could give me advice on how to get Bubs to sleep through the night and lecture me on how co-sleeping was going to smother my baby -.-
beyondthebump,3dsdb1,bnm3424,3,Mon Jul 20 04:04:12 2015 UTC,I could have given out this exact rant. My mom texted me the other day to tell me that my cousin uses babywise and if I'd heard of it- like its some novel idea and it's the miracle cure to my problems. I'm 12 weeks into this shit and of course I've researched everything under the sun during my sleep deprived days. Nothing works except time.
beyondthebump,3dsdb1,babyelephants2,2,Sun Jul 19 12:15:13 2015 UTC,Bubs is four months old.  I've looked at everything. I've only ever considered non-CIO methods...

She's chatty, and I'm generally cool with that, and it is nice to get to boast about my babies when I want.  But let's cut it to once a week, maybe? They're 4 months old. I love them, but they're not exactly rolling over one day and talking the next. I enjoy their giggles when we play ""flying baby"" or ""where's the baby,"" but these aren't games with cliffhanger endings that deserve a minute by minute retelling.  It's not boring or repetitive... I guess I feel weirdly pressured either to have them doing something new all the time, or to be the kind of mom who CAN report on ""OMG my baby did the cutest thing today!"""

And I'm a horrible liar and can't pretend to say that I put my baby in a crib and he stays there all night. So they find out that my baby is sleeping in my bed.

Before bedsharing, I was so tired I couldn't think straight. I would fall asleep holding him and wake up disoriented. I would cry every night knowing it was going to be miserable and exhausting.

I think they are mandated/required by the state but you are allowed to opt out. When I did my pre-registration I signed a form saying that I did not want the eye drops. When we were getting closer to delivery I also let my nurse know as a reminder. It wasn't a big deal, they were all fine with it I just had to tell them I didn't want it."

beyondthebump,3dvyla,InnocentHeathy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:54:09 2015 UTC,"I wasn't informed of either of these procedures but my husband was. I knew about the eye drops because all my nieces and nephews had gooey eyes when I first visited. I didn't learn about the Vitamin K shot until hours afterwards. But I had my baby via C-Section so all that was done in the nursery and my husband was there while I was still in the OR. They didn't ask if they could do those procedures, but they informed my husband before they did it and he was present. I think he probably could have declined if he wanted. They did ask me if I wanted her to have the Hep B shot later that day."

She eats and swallows all foods from her spoon ( which she fiercerly attacks) and will hold her own bananas and brocillis and gnaw on them. Some babies are not interested in eating at all until much later. Follow that baby's lead! All babies are different and in the grand scheme of things waiting  few extra months to give more solids is no time at all!
beyondthebump,3dt619,oopsielalala,2,Sun Jul 19 22:22:33 2015 UTC,"That's great that she's so into eating! Our lil guy's been getting spoon fed for a couple months now and is still pretty indifferent about it. He does like grabbing any cup we're drinking out of, but just to gnaw on it lol."
beyondthebump,3dt619,oopsielalala,2,Sun Jul 19 23:06:35 2015 UTC,Does he like holding foods himself to gnaw on? Like a lightly steamed asparagus? I like the baby led weaning stuff because then there is no pressure to get babies to eat. We started with only giving LO foods ( when she showed interest) like asparagus and we did not use spoons at first. She does  like spoons and I use them to give her foods like egg yokes. But she really loves holding foods herself which means she eats very little but makes a very big mess ;)

beyondthebump,3dt619,woollywhelk,2,Sun Jul 19 23:47:14 2015 UTC,"Yea, it still scares me when we try new foods. Asparagus lightly steamed ( not the flowered end) works well because they can't bite a piece off. Or brocillis with the florets cut off ( or a long piece of carrot) so it's just the stem part. If it is just slightly soft they can suck out the juices without biting parts off. I think my LO finds it entertaining too to gnaw on stuff with tastes- she can now gnaw on softer things like bananas and strawberries without getting a whole chunk in her mouth"

So I put on the tankini and she proceeds to make fun of the small sliver of skin she can see that shows my bagillion stretch marks.  Mer.  I hate my body too post-baby.  I send you lots of hugs :)
beyondthebump,3dqlwb,MrsFunner,12,Sat Jul 18 15:16:46 2015 UTC,"I stopped by to see my grandmother on my way home from the 1 week pediatrician appointment because she hadn't seen the baby yet. First thing she said to me after fawning over my little girl was ""oh you've got a belly, are you exercising yet?"" ...one week post partum with a second degree tear and a lot of blood loss, I told her I wasn't allowed to exercise yet, I was still recovering. Her response was ""well you should start exercising as soon as you're allowed, you don't want to get a pot belly."" Screw you Nana, when you gave birth, you still had 1 more week to go before being discharged from the hospital. Some people just don't think before they speak. That's why we have these subs though, to keep each other sane."
beyondthebump,3dqlwb,woollywhelk,4,Sat Jul 18 15:41:29 2015 UTC,Ugh. It was a different time back then! I feel like women in my grandmother's era gained like 15 pounds in pregnancy and then everyone chose formula simply so they could go back to starving themselves.. Don't listen to her!
beyondthebump,3dqlwb,missamberlee,3,Sat Jul 18 16:40:59 2015 UTC,"Yah, I've been meaning to ask my mother if she was formula fed, because I'm willing to bet my grandmother didn't breastfeed, so has no idea what goes along with it. Easier to think about exercise when someone else can feed the baby and you aren't worried about fitting enough healthy calories into your day to keep supply up. Also, I gained about 25 lbs during pregnancy, and at 3 weeks out I've dropped 23 of those, so Nana is clearly crazy. :p new moms have enough to worry about in the first few months. Body image should not be one of them. You made a human! Be proud! I'm lucky to have a really wonderful husband. When I was feeling bad about my stretch marks, he said to look at them as battle scars that show the work I did to make our beautiful little girl."

Everyone makes such a big deal about ""the baby weight"" and ""I don't want to have kids because it will destroy my figure"" yet no one talks about things like urinary incontinence! I'm way more concerned with peeing myself than my weight, thank you very much. And I so wasn't prepared/didn't know this was a thing.

I tell this to everyone who posts about feeling grossed out by their freshly postpartum body: it isn't all about weight loss. It takes time for your skin to start tightening up again. Your ribs are still wider than they will be in 6-12 months. Your hips are too. Your boobs will perk up again, it takes years after breastfeeding/even just the milk coming in to get that back. But it totally happens! And it takes a long while, which sucks. But I noticed about 6 months PP that everything in general just looked tighter and less stretched out. I hadn't even started exercising yet and I was still ~30 pounds overweight. Now it's been about 6 months since I stopped breastfeeding and my right boob is already looking much perkier! (If only lefty would follow suit lol). Stretch marks fade eventually. Your skin is an organ that needs time but it does heal itself. It'll never all be the same but our bodies are amazing and resilient as hell!"

Besides that, due to media and celeb pictures being touched up today's people have no idea what real bodies look like anymore. When princess Kate emerged from the hospital on the day of birth, some were shocked she showed her postpartum bump. On the day of birth. We only see the extreme in the media - the 1 in 10.000 pregnancy body that bounced back in n weeks. Well lemme tell ya those pics were tampered with and that woman must be exhausted and had help! Bit of a rant here, sorry.  Besides the fact that your awesome body created your baby out of pretty much nothing, I'm sure you look lovely and a lot of women (if not most) feel not so good about themselves postpartum.

My first instinct if my husband said something like that would be to look at those photos with him and try and get him to see how extreme the changes my body went through in such a short time really were.

""i need some weights because i feel bad about my body since you brought attention to it :(. i want you to find me attractive"" or something. this is when he says sorry and that you're lovely!! remember, you're normal! better than normal by fitting back into your pre-peg clothes and at 9 weeks!"

Dogs, raccoons, etc. yes, though.  Unfortunately, i've also found garbage (from the humans) in them--buried, like the f~ing garbage can was just too far for them to make it...and yes, I live in a nice area.  I still find gross-ass sh!t in them from time to time and it's just not worth it.  That's about 25% of why I nope out of sandboxes--the other 75% is that it freaking gets everywhere and in everything and takes forever to clean off of all of my daughter's stuff (shoes, toes, hands, pockets, car, washing machine, etc) and let's face it: I'm a grumpy old person in training--I don't have time for that.    That being said, I know how I feel is irrational--because I love it when my kid gets dirty/sweaty/covered in kid-goo.  I feel like I'm doing something right when she's filthy/dirty/sweaty after a day outside (most recently after picking blueberries at the farm.  The tub was brown after her bath!).

We're just a lot more diligent about cleaning their hands and faces. At home we don't worry as much. My 2 year old loves first and rocks and if she put it in her mouth, I tell her not to, but I don't freak out.   As far as sandboxes go, we make sure to wash them really well and definitelu make sure it doesn't go in mouths. But it depends on the area. The park near out current house is a nice clean park. But our last neighborhood part was a known hangout place for drug users and I had seen needles and stuff in the sand box. So definitely not. It really depends on where you go.   If you get a sandbox for your back yard, make sure to have a cover for it so it doesn't become a litter box."

If you have a kid who is old enough to not put things/their hands in their mouths until they've been washed, maybe no big deal."

A simple ""he's not comfortable around older kids right now"" with a friendly smile would suffice.   As far as the germs and personal space and smacking... he's seven months, not seven weeks, and it was a straw not a rock. Personally, I really wouldn't see it as a big deal. Maybe part of your kid's hesitation is that he can sense your own anxieties?  I totally understand how situations can be uncomfortable and people make you feel bad, and I'm a total crier at times like that. So I know it sucks and I'm not minimizing how it felt. But it would be good to have a couple lines ready to say when other kids get too friendly and maybe relax a little over germ worries?"
beyondthebump,3dsvu7,notmymonkees,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:18:39 2015 UTC,It's very normal. Toddlers see babies and automatically want to run up to them and touch them. I've had that happen with my 14 month old and as long as they're not snotty and coughing I honestly don't have a problem with it. I think it's adorable that toddlers love babies so much.

He was shopping with dad while I was in another aisle. When I came back a few minutes later he lost it. He needed me Right Now! He was fine until I showed up. Everyone looked. It sucked, first of many I'm guessing.  I work in a book store. We play music and have a coffee shop. People sit on the floor and read books that they don't buy. There is a kid crying in the children's area at least 10% of the time. It's totally fine that your babe cried. If anyone had the balls to complain to me about someone's crying baby I would invite them to leave.  I find my LO is best with new people on his home turf.

beyondthebump,3dqxty,nikknak,15,Sat Jul 18 16:30:58 2015 UTC,"I've heard so many stories about babies who normally sleep great in their own crib regressing after a trip and sleeping in an unfamiliar place. Maybe you should put off all these changes until after your trip? You could keep trying naps in the crib in the mean time just to see how she does?   Personally I think babies learn to sleep alone when they're ready to. Many babies continue to nurse at night, so going cold turkey with that at her age doesn't sound necessary to me..."
beyondthebump,3dqxty,bonjourtabby,12,Sat Jul 18 17:01:32 2015 UTC,"So recommendations to do CIO and night weaning are not medical advice, they are parenting advice. Your doctor is not a child psychologist or sleep expert. She's right in that your baby is most likely physically capable of sleeping through the night, but it's perfectly normal for her not to be developmentally or emotionally ready at this point.  If you do want to night wean, I know some people have had success with Jay Gordon's method and he's an advocate of cosleeping. I think night weaning, plus crib training plus cry it out sounds like an enormous amount for a baby to cope with all at once. Maybe decide wether you'd rather get her in her cot, or not nursing through the night first and tackle that. Let her get used to the change, feel safe and secure with the new routine and then assess wether you want to take things further.  I'm not a fan of cry it out for various reasons, but it isn't the only method of sleep training that there is. Maybe you could look into gentle sleep help if that fits more with your philosophy on parenting."
beyondthebump,3dqxty,mediocrity511,5,Sat Jul 18 20:15:19 2015 UTC,"Preach! I take my doctor's advice when it relates to medical advice, but when it comes to sleep advice, I nod my head and let it pass into one ear and out the other.   I had a pretty terrible sleeper that hated sleeping alone, and even with me, hated sleeping on her back. She would only sleep on her side, smooshed up against me, and would nurse every two hours. I was able to start her off in her crib, nursing/rocking her to sleep, then she'd wake up at 10:30, and I'd bring her to bed with me every night.  We used Dr. Gordon's method for night weaning at 12 months. It's been nearly two months, and my kid is sleeping through the night in her bed.  There were times when I doubted my kid would ever sleep all night in her bed, but here I lie spread out like a starfish with my covers up past my waist in my roomy bed!  Go with what your heart tells you. If there were only one way of getting babies to sleep on their own, there wouldn't be thousands of books and websites advising you on how to get your kid to sleep."
beyondthebump,3dqxty,hammymchammerson,15,Sun Jul 19 03:07:59 2015 UTC,"First, it's not ""abnormal"" at that age to wake up often. Yes, babies that age are capable of sleeping all night, but not all of them do.   Second, Co sleeping isn't wrong. You don't have to stop until you're ready. Yes, it can potentially postpone when kiddos are ready to sleep alone. But there's nothing wrong with that if you're ok with it.   My second daughter is 2 and still wakes up at least twice at night to nurse. We're working on night weaning but slowly.   Do what feels right for you."
beyondthebump,3dqxty,bumblemom0503,7,Sat Jul 18 17:41:11 2015 UTC,"So I would run far away from that doctor, for many reasons.  I'm a mom of two children who have both had severe reflux, and any doctor who isn't a total idiot knows that ""silent reflux"" exists.  Just because there is no spit-up certainly doesn't mean there isn't any reflux.  Uncontrolled acid can do long-term damage to the esophagus and also, obviously, make her miserable.  Also those medications are pretty low risk and safe in the long run so there's no need to be so cautious about putting her on a medication.  The complete refusal of meds there seems wreckless to me.  Secondly, as many others have said, sleep stuff is a parenting decision, not a medical decision.  Your doctor should respect that.  I am very against CIO and my pediatrician is very for it.  She politely asks me if I would like her advice on sleep and I politely decline and we both nicely go on, business as usual with no harm no foul.  So you shouldn't have to go seek out a doctor who believes the exact same thing as you do just to find someone who is respectful of you.  You are paying THEM to do a job.  That said, even my pro-CIO pediatrician assured me that it is normal for my daughter to still be nursing a few times overnight, and she's 9 months old.  Find another doctor, ASAP."
beyondthebump,3dqxty,katiekabooms,5,Sun Jul 19 01:15:41 2015 UTC,"You NEED another doc. Your baby sounds just like mine who had bad silent reflux. As soon as we got him on Zantac he went from only sleeping a half hour-hour to sleeping 5 hour stretches. It got better for a while on it's own but now it's back at 9 months. We got the ok to up his dosage, and lo and behold he doesn't hate being on his back again, he sleeps better again, etc.   You will probably find (like we did) that she will even take to the crib easier since her tummy doesn't hurt. My son would wake up, nurse for comfort, and then hurt worse from all the food, so he would nurse for comfort, etc. It was a horrible cycle. I'm just glad we had a good doctor. Hang in there!  (The pacifiers might actually be a good idea. Baby wants suckling for comfort, but more food then going back to sleep can make reflux worse.)"
beyondthebump,3dqxty,Kadesh2,4,Sat Jul 18 20:47:39 2015 UTC,"My baby didn't sleep though the night until she was 11 months old, and we never co-slept.  To say that your baby should be sleeping through at 7.5 months is bananas.  Hang in there."
beyondthebump,3dqxty,merveilleuse_,8,Sat Jul 18 22:34:42 2015 UTC,"We are in a parenting support group with six other families with babies all born within a month of each other. We are right around 9 months. Of the seven families, only one has a baby that sleeps through the night. Sure, they are capable and shouldn't NEED to nurse at night, but this period of time is so crazy for them- developmental leaps, crawling/moving, teething, etc etc etc....it's no wonder they are in need of some extra comfort.   We co sleep- since about 4 months she would start the evening off in her crib, sleep anywhere from 2-5 hours, and then I bring her to our bed. Right around 7 months the crib sleeping completely stopped. We try each night, and in the past two weeks have started getting a couple hours again.   I don't have much advice to help, other than to let you know that it is normal to not be sleeping through the the night and to still nurse. I know there are certainly sleep training methods that don't involve CIO, and we are currently doing some research there.   Also- if you are going to be traveling and sleeping together then, I would wait on any training until you are back."
beyondthebump,3dqxty,frankmillie,3,Sat Jul 18 17:08:57 2015 UTC,"Here's what helped us- start with playing in the crib for a week. Put her in there with a bunch of toys while you do laundry. Then work on getting her to nap in the crib. Then, have her sleep in the crib until the first wake up, then second, then all night. Yes, it's slower, but less traumatic for everyone. After she's used to the crib, then I'd work on feedings. I had my husband go in for every other wake up, and get him back to sleep without boob. Once that worked, I eliminated feedings between 11-3. You can go from there. Now he's 9 months and goes to bed at 7, I dream feed him at 11, and he wakes up for one feeding at 5am. Going to drop the dream feed soon. Best of luck! Edit: forgot to add that we only put him down in the crib on his belly or side. He's old enough and sleeps best this way."
beyondthebump,3dqxty,andthischeese,3,Sat Jul 18 22:14:02 2015 UTC,"OK. If you want her out of your bed and sleeping on her own, there are going to have to be gradual steps to do so. The Dr was pretty simplistic, IMO, about what to do. Here's what I'd suggest:   Get the kid into her crib. For a few days/nights, you could sit with her and put a hand on her if need be. Don't pick her up. Then, move the chair a little further away and stay there until she falls asleep. Then further the next night.    That's one approach. What worked for me was graduated CIO--put her in her crib awake but drowsy. Let her cry for a short period of time (3 minutes). Go in, comfort her. If she's really freaked I'd pick her up and give her a snuggle. Put her back after a couple of minutes of comfort. Let her cry a little longer (5 minutes). Go in, comfort.   This way was a LOT, LOT gentler than hardcore CIO. She knew I was there and she knew she was safe. But she got to sleep pretty quickly. She went from 20 minutes of naps and 4-5 hours of sleep a night to two 45-90 minute naps and 10 hours of sleep with two wakeups.   Night weaning: It's up to you if you want to do it. I never did. After awhile she'd just wake up once to nurse. Then she just stopped around 12 months. I fully weaned her at 13 months. Some kids also never take to a pacifier. Mine took one for a few weeks and that's it.    IIRC, Ferber had some good suggestions for night weaning. Might want to check out his book.    Reflux: No advice here except talk to another doc.    re: your trip: Most short-term disturbances like a trip can screw up the schedule, for sure, but it'll only take a few days to get back on track. If you can power through the next week, I'd suggest waiting until you get back.   TL;DR. Yes. Take it one battle at a time. CIO isn't always hardcore; you can do it for short periods of time and it can be pretty effective."
beyondthebump,3dqxty,dls2317,0,Sat Jul 18 19:14:53 2015 UTC,Great advice! When did you start this graduated CIO routine?

beyondthebump,3dqxty,BB_Queen,2,Sat Jul 18 23:06:09 2015 UTC,"I would DEFINITELY wait until after your trip to do anything.  And I think your doctor is full of shit.  My kid woke up every 2 hours until she was 10 months old- and we didn't co-sleep (she just wants to play all damn night if she's in bed with us).  Then we did some sleep training with the help of a sleep consultant, got her on a better nap schedule, and did a tiny bit of CIO with timed checks.  She JUST started sleeping through the night completely on her own volition 5 days ago.  Even now she sleep through on her own about 4 nights a week, and still wakes up once to feed on the other nights.  Do what feels right to you- your daughter with sleep eventually."
beyondthebump,3dqxty,insidia,2,Sun Jul 19 01:28:51 2015 UTC,"My baby sleeps in his own crib and wakes to feed some nights every three hours or sooner. I wish I felt comfortable bed sharing because walking to his room is not ideal. I can't imagine doing CIO, it's just not natural for Mom or baby IMO. We have tried the ferber(?) method a little. It's less abrupt to the CIO as you go check on baby and pat them back to sleep, but you are not allowed to hold them. This lasted for us for about a week. Mom and Dad are both push overs in this house, we are OK with it though. I think he will get thier on his own and I work from home so I have the time, not everyone has this luxury though."
beyondthebump,3dqxty,pregonewb,5,Sun Jul 19 18:09:24 2015 UTC,"she tells us to use CIO  No.   No.   Babies are humans, and some are cuddly. I can't make any recommendations, I'm not there, but the facts are that CIO is bad for her health. Studies show that CIO babies retain that level of stress throughout their sleep and into their next waking phase. They also have a higher propensity to adult depression."
beyondthebump,3dqxty,madcatlady,10,Sat Jul 18 18:13:59 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but I have to disagree. Dr. Sears has said that CIO can be ""damaging"", but the scientists whose studies he cited said he was misinterpreting their research.  The damage that people claim can come from CIO has never been proven as far as I can find. It's true that neglect and prolonged stress can negatively effect babies, but this comes from actual abuse, not a couple night of crying for 20 minutes or so.  My son is suuuuper cuddly, and I mostly coslept for the first 6 months. After only 2 nights of CIO, he barely cries. He went from waking up every hour to sleeping in his crib all night.  I'm not saying everyone should do CIO, and in fact if we had a bigger bed I might still be cosleeping just because it was nice. But CIO is not proven to bad for a baby's health, and I think you will find most doctors recommend it."
beyondthebump,3dqxty,BB_Queen,8,Sat Jul 18 19:46:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you for responding- I was going to but would not have been as articulate.  This perspective drives me nuts--yes, prolonged periods of unanswered crying (like, Russian Orphanage level neglect) does lead to stress levels and damage to the child.    Dr.Weissbluth also provides research supporting the lack of these consequences/ residual stress-related side effects in his book (Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child)."

beyondthebump,3dqxty,dls2317,2,Sat Jul 18 19:20:43 2015 UTC,"I can't give advice on CIO as I haven't done it personally. But I do want you to know that you're not alone. My son is 6.5 months old and has never slept alone (except for the first night in the hospital). He'll immediately start crying if he's put down and he only takes naps in my arms (like right now).  He also nurses at night every 2-3 hours like yours. I can't try CIO because it'll just hurt me too much to hear him cry so much. But if you still want to try it, go with what the other posters have said and do it gradually.   Some babies are just very clingy. I used to get a little envious (still do sometimes) when I see and hear people talk about how their baby sleeps soundly in a crib. But I've gotten to a point where I don't mind. He'll only be this little for so long and I enjoy the cuddles.   Also, reactions like that doctor's make me not want to tell anyone about my co-sleeping habits. Is there any way you can get another visit with your regular doctor to get their opinion about all of this?"

Dr.s shouldn't give parenting advice anyway.."
beyondthebump,3dqxty,LinnyLou23,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:45:09 2015 UTC,"Very little to say here except cio is fine for some not for others so go with your instinct. You are very far from alone with a lo who still wakes up that often. Just stopping all feeding in the middle of the night is crazy, you need to ease her out of it. but the most important thing to be said here is that Dr is a jack ass. Call and talk with your original dr on Monday. You shouldn't need an appointment for that. Before you call, write down a list of what you want to talk about to make sure you think clearly when dealing with him/her. I'm the queen of getting off the phone with the dr and being like 'why didn't i say these things!' Deal with your trip and cosleeping, tackle the crib afterwards. In the meantime you can try to illuminate some of the night feedings, but it will mean sleepless nights for you of rocking your baby while she'd rather eat. Do it gradually for your sanity if nothing else."
beyondthebump,3dqxty,mrsninja,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:01:04 2015 UTC,"My daughter woke up about every 1.5 to 2 hours at that age. We also co-slept and she woke up to nurse or for comfort.  Early in the night, she would only sleep for 20-40 minutes at a time because of what I think were undiagnosed reflux problems.  It's hard to see the forest for the trees when you're in this situation.  I think that you're on the right track with the night weaning (my daughter finally slept for a 6 hour stretch when we night-weaned her at 9 months) but be gentle with her and yourself.  If it's not working great, don't push it.  Deal with it when you feel a little stronger.  I'm not a fan of cry-it-out in all its forms, but maybe let her cry for up to 15 minutes or whatever you're comfortable with.    You sound like you are a caring, concerned mama who loves your little girl.  I would trust your gut over doctors' advice on this one.  All babies are different and you know your little one better than anyone.   She will eventually sleep better, I promise.   And for a little hope, my daughter was a terrible sleeper.  I remember going on vacation when she was 8 months old and being embarrassed at having to ask my sister-in-law to sleep with her because she woke up every couple of hours and expected a bottle/boob.  It was hard!  But now she's almost two and a half, sleeps 11-12 hours at night + a 2 hour nap during the day.  You'll get there.  That first year is really hard for those of us with the insomniacs and the comfort nursers."
beyondthebump,3dqxty,Canary_,0,Mon Jul 20 08:38:01 2015 UTC,"If you want to get her to sleep in her crib try buying one of those portable playpens. My baby sleeps in one of those when we travel, and it makes for a great crib substitute.   You can teach her to sleep in her playpen before you leave for your trip, and then when you're away she can continue sleeping in the same playpen. When you return home you can gradually transition her to an actual crib by maybe putting her playpen beside the crib, or maybe trying it inside the crib if it fits.   I got us a portable playpen by the guava family brand from Amazon. It's really great because it sets up quickly, it's fairly lightweight, it doesn't take a crazy amount of space when it's folded - it's pretty compact, and the best part is one side of it unzips so you can lie down beside your baby and nurse or just have your arm around her or hand on her tummy, and then when she's fast asleep you can zip up the side and sleep comfortably next to it.   When we travel I usually have the crib set up on a queen size bed so if the queen size bed is against the wall the crib will be closest to the wall and then the rest of the bed is where I sleep.   The portable playpen idea is very good for people who travel a lot with their babies. And it doesn't have to be necessarily overnight trips, as I really think it would work for naps as well, like if you're camping or you want to make a long day trip somewhere or you want to go over to a friends house and spend a few hours there you can put your baby to sleep in a separate room and in her own crib.  Just a note about the gradual cry it out method, I'm not a big fan. When I sleep trained my boy at six months I found that the Ferber method actually made things worse, because every time I would go in the room to comfort my boy he would just hysterically cry as I tried to leave. So then when I was really at the end of my rope I just said fuck it and I did the regular CIO, and within about 4 nights the tears stopped altogether and baby was just going to sleep normally and quietly.   A friend of mine also had sleep problems with her nine month old and she hired a sleep consultant. The Sleep consultant told her to use that chair method that somebody else mentioned, and it worked for her.    So it really depends on your baby and what you're comfortable with with regards to which method of sleep training you choose, if any."
beyondthebump,3dsir3,BabyLM141,3,Sun Jul 19 01:06:47 2015 UTC,"I have a 9 year old who slept like a dream as an infant (and still does) and a 9 month old who still sleeps like a nightmare and always has.  She still has to take her naps ON ME and we've only recently gotten her into her crib at night.  She has some nights of sleeping good and some nights being up once per hour wanting to nurse.  You know what?  I'm rolling with it.  I'm not comfortable with CIO but I feel that anyone who is comfortable with it should go for it.  If you're NOT, don't feel pressured to do it.  We're getting enough sleep to survive and I keep reminding myself that it won't last forever.  I'm 30 years old and I'M a bad sleeper and was as a baby as well.  Not in any way bragging, but I have a high IQ and spent all of my school years in the gifted program.  Just saying that if you have a happy smiley baby who is developmentally on track, do what works for your family.  You are NOT doing anything wrong."
beyondthebump,3dsir3,katiekabooms,2,Sun Jul 19 01:20:23 2015 UTC,"Our girl was an awful sleeper. Same as you, we ended up cosleeping unplanned. Eventually, we waited until she was asleep for about an hour, and then put her in the crib. She would wake up a couple times a night, and end up back in our bed before morning. We kept putting her back in crib when she was way out.  We at least got some better sleep. But, she started sleeping longer and longer in the crib, and now, at 17 months, has been sleeping through the night for a couple of months, and naps better too. She just finally got used to sleeping away from us, or my mom, who watches her."
beyondthebump,3dsir3,79augold,3,Sun Jul 19 01:23:56 2015 UTC,"My son also refuses to sleep in his crib, but I honestly feel lucky about how well he sleeps in bed with me. He can go 12 hours at night and takes 3 good naps a day with me next to him. In an ideal world he'd be in his crib, and I'd be able to sleep on my stomach and have baby-free time in the evenings, but our son just doesn't seem ready to sleep alone. He's a clingy baby, and goes straight to shrieking like he's being tortured when we try to make him sleep alone, so I honestly don't see how CIO would work for us. Maybe he'd literally cry until he's so exhausted he passes out, but I don't think that's really how it's supposed to work.  We just try to find time to be intimate when the baby is awake and happy playing in his playpen. I'm looking forward to the day when our son is finally in his own bed, but until then I'm just glad he sleeps."

So when we moved to a 2bd apartment when he was around 11 months, we gave up on the crib altogether and put a full mattress for him on the floor in his own baby proofed room. This way I could nurse him to sleep and then get up and leave. It made things so, so, so much easier. Do you have a space you could baby proof and try a floor mattress? It made a world of difference for us. He still woke up a few times a night but it was much easier to get him back to sleep and I could go back to my own bed without a baby rolling around and kicking me all night."

It took literally two days of Ferber-style CIO to completely change how our nights are.  My LO hated being in his crib, and I also had to ""sneak"" him into the crib while he was asleep. But babies sleep cycles are so short, that he would wake up every hour. I really felt at my wit's end and I felt trapped because I pretty much always had to hold the baby and never had a moment's peace. It's blowing my mind how fast CIO has worked and how much happier we all are now.  I didn't buy the book or anything, I just did what was outlined here: http://www.babycenter.com/0_baby-sleep-training-cry-it-out-methods_1497112.bc?page=2  If you want to do CIO, but are worried about health risks, this is a good read: http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/the_kids/2013/07/clinical_lactation_jumps_on_the_dr_sears_bandwagon_to_say_sleep_training.html  I will say if you choose to do this, the first night is EXTREMELY difficult emotionally. But it's important that if you start this, be consistent and know that it is supposed to work within a week (only took 2 days for us!)"
beyondthebump,3dsir3,BB_Queen,2,Sun Jul 19 02:25:26 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you've found a partial solution in cosleeping. And since NOTHING else has worked over 8 months, I would try to tackle the negatives that come with the successes of cosleeping rather than reinventing the wheel.  Finding ways to improve your comfort level and quality of sleep, and ensuring adequate sex and intimacy are grown-up obstacles to be overcome by (presumedly) rational adults. Baby's not sleeping well any other way right now and there's no reasoning with him.   Know that there is no shame in doing what works for your family right now because it works right now. It doesn't mean it will be that way forever. It breaks my heart to see so many parents fight a successful option because it's not what they ""should do"" or what if it ""becomes a habit"" or it ""might cause x future problem.""   The intimacy issue IS totally a tough one for sure, but I know plenty of couples who have slept fully separately during the first few months or even years of childrearing who deliberately and successfully reshaped their sex lives by being planful and creative.   Whatever you choose to do, I wish you the best. Long term sleep deprivation is literally torture, and I am so sorry you are suffering through this :("

That being said, they're also valid because they are YOUR reasons, and you don't need to justify your choices. If formula works better for you both, feed her that! As long as you're feeding her, you're doing a great job.   I stopped nursing my youngest at 7 months because I didn't want to have to deal with my low supply anymore. The constant pumping and supplements, and oatmeal and herbs and teas was driving me batty. I did it for 3 and a half years for my oldest, and with the newest child, I decided that enough was enough."

We have to supplement with formula some days but not every day. So every day I wonder if I'm producing enough. It's so frustrating. Every day I do the oatmeal, tea and herbs. I've tried stopping and my supply suffers. I like breastfeeding. It's so convenient and cheaper than formula but its also driving me crazy."

I'm also in the UK so hi neighbour! My son is on cow and gate milk and has infacol before each feed, you could try infacol too, he was very windy and sicky uppy before starting him on it at a week old and he completely changed to a different baby after that, never cries, he slept for long stretches at night.

We try not to get too upset and gasp and stuff when we see it happening because that just makes him more upset than he would have been if we played it cool. So! You got that out of the way :) I think it happens to every baby ever."

beyondthebump,3drfzo,andthischeese,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:21:34 2015 UTC,"Congratulations! Welcome. For weight gain, that's pretty normal. Babies bulk up due to all the fluids mom is given during labor, then lose the water weight. All you can do is feed on demand- as often and as long as baby wants. My doctor also recommended waking him every 3-4 hours at night to feed until he regained his birth weight. Best advice I was given was to get a good nursing pillow, large bottle for water, and expect to spend a lot of quality time with Netflix. They nurse more than not in the beginning. For the skin part- I've heard of them burning off skin that grows where is shouldn't due to the trauma. But not healthy skin that is just smooshed. For me, the doctor just ended up removing a bit of the stitching when I went in. But just a heads up, the swelling can make skin look weird and like its stitched incorrectly when it isn't. Definitely continue to use tucks cooling  pads."

Lower than normal estrogen means pffffffffft in the sex drive department usually and a Sahara Desert-esque vagina.  Tell honey honey homeboy to chill his ass out, no sex till AT LEAST 6 weeks because hey, if you've got any tears and him putting his weiner in you could introduce new bacteria and potentially cause infection, or better yet, if you're not on some sort of BC, womp womp, Irish Twins. But I'd be pushing for him to come to your PP appointment and have the Doc/Midwife/OB/Whoever lay down the law as well. Hearing NO from an outside source may chill him out a bit.  Either that or get mean with him. Ask him what part of ""NO!"" does he not understand?   And it will get better.

beyondthebump,3dqabz,kmcg2375,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:43:28 2015 UTC,"I think the 6 weeks is the recommendation to allow time for healing and recuperation, which is different for everyone. I'm not saying this shouldn't be abided by, but I'm 2 weeks out from a ""non-damaging"" birth, and I'm ready to get back to it already (we are still waiting the whole 6 weeks, though). The part I remember being the hardest to deal with when starting back up was the overwhelming ""what if I get pregnant again"" thoughts."
beyondthebump,3dqabz,jessicAshley,4,Sat Jul 18 16:13:07 2015 UTC,The 6 weeks recommendation id's to allow the wound from where your placenta detached from your uterine wall to heal. This gaping wound is what causes the risk of infection from sex.
beyondthebump,3dqabz,MrsFunner,2,Sat Jul 18 18:43:18 2015 UTC,"Yup. This is the main reason for the 6 week recovery period.

Nothing turned me on at all when he did it until about 6 weeks, and we did not even attempt sex until 8 weeks. I had a pretty sizable tear, and I stopped him before he even tried to start and laid down rules. GO SLOW! If I say stop, you better stop right then. I pointed out where the tear had been, and told him to angle away from there to keep pressure off it, and use tons of lube. He didnt last long, thank god.

Yea it might start off feeling like a chore or a duty, but it doesn't really take all that long, and it is a wonderful opportunity for you and your partner to bond sexually again, despite the trauma your body has been through. I can say that for me (not for everyone, I know, but for me) it is worth losing 15 minutes of sleep to make sure the needs of my partner are met, and to remind him that his needs are important to me. The general advice in this sub is that the husband is being selfish and should be murdered for having a sex drive... I feel like that's kind of mean and makes me feel bad for them."
beyondthebump,3dqabz,emrose28,2,Sat Jul 18 18:15:46 2015 UTC,It's not that he's selfish because he has a sex drive...

They sleep 20 minutes then wake up and wait until you get them back to sleep. They haven't learnt to do this on their own.  You will need to look at creating new sleep associations. ‘Sleep associations’ are the routines, habits and patterns that are connected with self settling. Sleep associations help us drift off to sleep and go back to sleep when we wake during the night. At the moment they is unable to self settle without you. If they wakes they require you to get them back to sleep. They are unable to do this by themselves. Sleep training (lack if a better word ) will be needed.   Developing new sleep associations that don’t rely on you and that will provide comfort and settling in the middle of the night is needed. This means consistency with however or what ever approach you use for sleep. Maybe start with trying to get them to sleep for the morning nap when you are most fresh. When it's nap time, place them in cot. Now, they will get made at you. That's ok. They will cry, that's ok to. It if a stop/start cry leave them be, they are learning to self settle. If they become agitated, or you can't cope go to the and calm them. Don't remove from cot. As soon as they are calm, leave the room. It you don't feel comfortable leaving room, sit next to cot or place one hand on them. Do something you feel comfortable with and then gradually over the next few day, slowly move further away from cot or out of the room. This needs to be done at a pace you feel comfortable with so you can be consistence. Only try resettling for the length of nap time. Say 40 minutes. Even if they haven't slept that's ok. Try again later.  Start working on day sleeps first. It's easier cos your less tired. Night sleeps will come later. If you have as partner, friend or family member that can help you plan a sleep strategy it can be a great support. They can give you back up when you need help. Sometimes when they are crying, get a drink of water, walk the long way around the house anything with may give you child a few extra minutes to self settle might help.

beyondthebump,3dqh66,entailments,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:55:44 2015 UTC,"Are their hands swaddled. At 3 months they will be bringing them to her mouth. Instead of you putting the dummy in, you can put it in their hand to find their mouth. Basically teaching them to do it. Then they become less reliant on you.   If this doesn't work them put it in. Sleep associations begin to form around 4 months do you won't be doing any harm."
beyondthebump,3dqh66,Zanyigloo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:13:53 2015 UTC,Yes we are still fully swaddled. Planning to start weaning soon. It's hard because she's such a poor napper that I'm reluctant to take anything away that helps her sleep just a little bit more.

beyondthebump,3dqh66,Zanyigloo,2,Tue Jul 21 01:58:01 2015 UTC,"So our routine starts early even though he isn't sleeping until around 6.  For some reason I find we thrive on that early routine. The only times we shake it up is if we are not home, and typically on those days we're so busy we poop out our little guy easy.  2:30/3 - He wakes up from his last nap of the day and we start ""dinner"" we're playing around with food now so he get's some banana or whatever puree plus some bottle.    3:30 - He get's to play some while I'm cleaning up from his ""dinner"" and starting to get bath stuff ready.  4 - We get into the bath, we're taking them together for now as I can hold onto him better and he plays more.    4:30 - Out of bath, he gets toweled off, fresh diaper, lotioned up/massaged, pajamas.  At this point I'm still wet and naked so I set him in his bouncer in front of some cartoons (the only screen time he gets) to quickly take my own shower and rinse off, my husband is always around and watching at this point but we find if my hubby interacts with him too close to bed-time then baby boy is too excited for sleep.  Between 4:45-6: I put him in my lap and we read a book or a few, and then we'll do some quiet play where we might practice petting the dog, or playing with soft toys.  Come 6 I put a fresh diaper on him, and will put a sleep sack on him IF he is only in a onsie, if he is in sleeper pajamas I just leave him in that only.  I also put his snuza monitor on at this time.  He then get's a bottle while I play his music (rockabye baby renditions of Journey) and once his bottle is done he goes in his crib.  Sometimes, if he doesn't go down right away or has become over stimulated he will go in the swing for a bit before being transferred to the crib.  He sleeps from 6:30/7 to about 1 or 2AM where he'll need a diaper change and between 2-4 oz, then sleep again until 4 or 5 where it's just a diaper change, then between 6-7 he wakes up for the day."

Other people swear by them though so they may work for you. I don't think Orajel can be used on babies this young. I think it numbs then too much and they might have a hard time swallowing. We do mostly cold teething rings and just distracting him as best as you can during the day. For us, the top two teeth were much worse than the bottom. We gave him ibuprofen at night and that helped tremendously. My friends son is a really late teether and is getting six teeth at once (he's 13 months), so it could be worse!"
beyondthebump,3dq9l3,stressedpie,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:56:52 2015 UTC,Teething is rough for sure.   Yes teething can cause a rash because of all the drool they swallow. It can also make some babies gassy.   We have used Hylands teething tablets and they work fairly well but sometimes just aren't enough. We don't use orajel because of the risks of choking due to making the throat numb. But infant motrin works great. People say Tylenol but that's actually not as much of a pain reliever as a fever reducer and and helps with swelling. So for things like teething it doesn't work as well. At least in my experience.
beyondthebump,3dq9l3,bumblemom0503,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:00:43 2015 UTC,"I used orajel naturals, and gave Tylenol. My daughter liked cold teethers, my son only chewed in his blankie. Both of them would have a rash sometimes, and their pop is different while teething."

I would have said it was the movement of one that makes the second pop up, but he's currently getting one either side of his front teeth, so that theory doesn't hold water :)  We've found as soon as they pop through the gums fully (i.e. there is actual tooth clear from the gum line) the crankiness and drooling subsides dramatically.  Edited to add I was told do not to use Orajel or any other numbing gel on an infant. With all of the drooling and tongue movement, you wind up numbing way more of their mouth than intended, and they can choke on their saliva if they swallow any of the gel and numb their throat."

I personally take everything I read or am told into consideration and do my own research (not on blogs or message boards but in books, journals, position statements from AAP, WHO, CDC, etc.) and also ask a lot of questions on here and other parenting subreddits. I consider the source - is it my grandma who can barely remember what it's like to have a newborn? My nurse coworker with a baby 2 months older than mine? I will probably give different weight to their advice. Then I come up with my own plan from there.   I don't always agree with our pediatrician (she said I should start giving my 4 month old solids and by 6 months he should be eating 3 meals a day and topping off with breast milk... Um no.) so I listen to what she has to say and go home and read some and decide from there.

beyondthebump,3dpgf0,kerida1,5,Sat Jul 18 19:10:35 2015 UTC,I would say check to see if you can see a lactation consultant they can really help. The advice they gave me was to breastfeed first then supplement and also to try pumping in between feedings or after feeding so that i could offer my pumped milk first. If you offer boob after LO will not be as hungry so less demanding on the boob and your boob only knows to increase supply if it knows you need more. They recommended fenugreek to get my supply up and it helped but made LO too gassy and fussy to be worth it. I also made lactation cookies which are delicious and helped a tad ( i think more because i remembered to eat when i had them) http://www.drmomma.org/2010/08/lactation-cookies-recipe-increasing.html?m=1. And i also took blessed thistle.  My advice maynot be the very best but i did see signs of improvement doing that. I was never able to get my supply fully back and now can't get much of anything at 7 months but i think most of that was because i realised until 2 months after that while trying to get my supply up i was also drinking a drink that is used to dry up supply. So insure you also check on like kellymom for a list of what can dry up supply so you can avoid that while building up a supply.
beyondthebump,3dpgf0,kellomi,2,Sat Jul 18 04:48:42 2015 UTC,"Fyi, I thought that I wasn't making enough milk (thyroid issues), business the problem was poor bf sessions due to a slight tongue and lip tie. The pediatrician noticed them but did not say anything about how that might be our problem; a lactation consultant told me that peds are frequently poorly trained on this particular issue.   A lactation consultant recommended a ""sandwich"" method. Start on the breast,  switch to bottle if they start getting fussy/lazy, feed enough to take the edge off (1/3-1/2 normal bottle), then back to the breast before they are full. Pump afterwards.  It works very well for us- my supply has increased by 2-3 ounces daily in about a week."

You can also just use a tube in a bottle of formula.    It allows you to feed your LO her supplement while also giving extra breast stimulation to increase milk production. And, it saves some time by not having to do a bottle after you breastfeed.   This is what I used to get my low supply (also due to thyroid issues!) way up. I went from being able to feed LO 0.5-1 oz. per feeding, in total from both breasts, to 3+ oz. total per feed."

Basically, the point of all this was to mimic what happens with breastfeeding to keep the baby interested in the breast. We were told 3oz is way too much for a newborn to get at one time (if your baby is older this may not apply, although we never did more than 2 oz bottles for the first 4 months or so).   For us, this worked. Our daughter always needed to be supplemented due to my low supply (although we were able to keep it around 6 oz per day) and she's still breastfeeding at 22 months."

beyondthebump,3do6lg,generallyok,0,Sat Jul 18 02:20:41 2015 UTC,yeah my little guy won't take a bottle from me. he will at daycare though... tho i don't think he likes it much.
beyondthebump,3do6lg,kitty_hawkins,0,Sat Jul 18 01:47:17 2015 UTC,Yeah my girl doesn't like bottles much either even when I'm gone.  I work 12 hour shifts so I'm usually gone from home 13+ hours on the days I work.  Baby girl takes as little as possible while I'm gone and then eats up a storm as soon as I walk through the door.  I still pump the full amount when I'm gone too so I guess that's one good way to get my supply up.

It's expensive though.   Good luck!"
beyondthebump,3do6lg,jod02,2,Sat Jul 18 06:20:02 2015 UTC,"Has she been checked for a lip or tongue tie? Low weight gain is one of the many indicators of a tie. Try to find a specialist in your area as it's easily overlooked by peds.  Are you or baby suffering from any of these other symptoms? http://www.mommypotamus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/tongue-tie-symptoms-5.jpg  My son just had his lip and tongue tie revised. Although we didn't suffer from all of these problems, we did have a few issues which led me to get him assessed. I had talked to 4 different doctors and nurses before I finally found someone who could properly diagnose him!"

beyondthebump,3do6lg,mrssunny,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:10:51 2015 UTC,"My baby's lip tie was first noticed when we saw a lactation consultant, and confirmed by a dentist who specializes in frenulectomies. Her lip tie was cut by an ENT doc...unfortunately it looks like it grew back so we have an appointment with the dentist again next week to have it redone. :( he's not in our insurance network, but I just feel 100x more comfortable with him than going back to the ENT again."
beyondthebump,3do6lg,The_Bravinator,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:46:11 2015 UTC,We just got LOs tongue and lip tie lasered by a pediatric dentist. If you have a lactation consultant they should be able to refer you to one.

I asked about the possibility with my baby and the ped straight up said that I'd be better off seeing a lactation consultant about it. Turns out she doesn't have one, but part of it really is knowing whom to turn to. :)"
beyondthebump,3do6lg,dat_persian,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:39:00 2015 UTC,"We saw a pediatric dentist. There's an awesome Facebook group called ""Tongue Tie Babies Support Group"" which I highly recommend. They're really helpful at identifying ties and for recommending a specialist in your area. It's a very supportive group if you suspect your baby to be tied, they have loads of information and it's been nice just to have a group of people who can relate to our problems.  I hope you get it all sorted out. Even if you decide to quit breastfeeding still get her checked. A tongue tie can lead to problems further down the road with speech delays and troubles eating certain foods. Good luck!"
beyondthebump,3do6lg,dat_persian,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:34:03 2015 UTC,How's your nutrition?  You sound like a busy mama.  Just checking on you 😀.  Also sounds like your LO might benefit from the formula.  3oz is a lot of milk!  Doesn't seem like she isn't getting the milk.  We tried lots of bottles and finally had luck with Munchkin Latch.
beyondthebump,3do6lg,Blenda33,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:02:54 2015 UTC,"My nutrition is pretty good. Could I stand to eat a few more carrots and a few less chips? Yes. But I'm not eating poorly by any means. Im 100% okay with and willing to give her the formula. Honestly, I hate breastfeeding because I'm the only one who can feed her, so I would love for my husband to take on the task of 1 bottle a day.   I have been through standard doctor Browns, enfamil nursers, and had most success with tommee tippee, which are my personal favorite-yay! We haven't looked at the munchkin latch yet, because we have all the others in hand, as well as wide and standard playtex, avent, and nuby. Is the shape of the nipple on the munchkin similar to any of the ones I've used? If it's different it may be worth buying to try next. (Both my other children were formula fed, breast feeding was not a good thing for either of them, and we tried a million bottles with them, which explains me having so many on hand. I'm not just buying every bottle I see, haha!)"
beyondthebump,3do6lg,knittybynature,2,Sat Jul 18 04:21:31 2015 UTC,"I can relate.  I made it to my 3 month goal and went EFF.  We had so many problems and my son wasn't gaining impressive amounts of weight then he started being really weird with the bottle so we had to try several.  The latch bottle is wide, round and soft.  I felt like it mimics the breast the most.  He even does that cute little lip quiver while he's drinking from it that he did when he would breast feed."
beyondthebump,3do6lg,librarianzrock,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:13:47 2015 UTC,"I think you need to find a way to start feeding her more, soon. Very soon. Use a syringe if she doesn't like the bottle. Find a way. She needs to gain more weight. (I'm sorry if this is tough love, my baby gained weight slowly, we supplemented. A close friend had a baby who barely put on weight, slightly less than your LO. She didn't seem concerned and neither did her Dr, so I didn't say anything, despite feeling horrified at the lack of weight gain. Then baby ended up in hospital for a week as she was 'failing to thrive'. Why the f didn't I say anything!! Don't wait to feed her more to see if you can boost supply or fix a lip tie. More food now.

She just hates the formula and it makes me miserable to see her scream so much as if she's being tortured when we give it to her. I'm definitely concerned, and I know the ped is too because I've never seen her look so worried about anything, and my kids have been seeing her for nearly 4 years, and she was my ped as well. Thank you for being concerned, I definitely don't want baby girl to end up in the hospital."

Then maybe call the midwife. I hated that my son had colic but the boob soothed him and I credit it to helping his weight gain.
beyondthebump,3do6lg,ginger_mcfreckle_vag,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:37:04 2015 UTC,"Come over to /r/breastfeeding for EBF support too! I had to pump after each feed to boost my supply. If you use formula, make sure to pump breastmilk each time you use it, or your supply will decrease."
beyondthebump,3do6lg,snowellechan77,5,Fri Jul 17 22:33:45 2015 UTC,"The thing is, my supply is not low. She eats and is satisfied. When I pump to replace the times she takes a bottle, I get anywhere from 5-7oz. I can even pump 3-5oz in between her feelings if I choose- I don't do that because I also have 2 other children and I really don't have time to bf and pump. That's why I'm at such a loss over what to do. It's like my milk fills her belly, but does not really benefit her growth. It's just stops her from losing weight."
beyondthebump,3do6lg,candidate0,2,Fri Jul 17 22:56:07 2015 UTC,Has she been checked for a lip and tongue tie? There might be a milk transfer problem. It could also explain her difficulty with bottles--some tied babies don't take bottles well.

beyondthebump,3do6lg,MustacheBus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:41:43 2015 UTC,My lactation consultant said to push the nipple up into the rid of baby's mouth to activate the suck reflex.  She also said to have someone else feed her because if baby smells you/breastmilk then she won't go for a bottle and fit the person to hold them in a different position than you would normally breastfeed them in because it will confuse them because they week be expecting the boob since they are in that position to eat

When I was growing up I could fit way more furniture in my room so I guess that's why it feels small to me? Idk. The other bedroom is even smaller so if we have another kid someday I'll feel even worse. Oh well. This is hopefully our forever home so they'll have to get over it!"

We ordered a crib in January on back order and it kept getting pushed out and out and out... So with a month away I canceled it and bought the same one in-stock in a different color.

I'm not about to be cleaning bodily fluids out of the cracks between the 150 year old floor boards.   I didn't know they were striking - that would make sense! I was in love with the color of the crib - we have an antique kinda feel to our decor and even though the rest of his room is more ""modern"" than the rest of the house I still wanted something rustic.

Initially I was freaked out and devastated (b/c I was planning a natural water birth) but I realized this is the first of the bagillion things that I can no longer control with a baby and, honestly, I couldn't be happier with how everything turned out.  I had a C section at 39 weeks.  I have a beautiful, healthy daughter and was able to plan it all and figure out work without all of the crazy I went into labor surprise.  Also, recovery wasn't actually that bad.  If I decide to have another baby, I'll prolly just schedule another Csection.  I hope your baby flips, I know some do at last minute even though mine didn't, but if she doesn't you still get an amazing baby in the end - and that's all that matters!"

beyondthebump,3dp4ck,insidia,3,Sat Jul 18 15:26:59 2015 UTC,"My baby was also breech- I tried chiropractor, acupuncture, and an external version.  She was (and is!) a stubborn little beastie.  My husband and I took it as a lesson to parent the child you have, not the child you think you should have!  :)  Good luck.  I scheduled a c-section as close to my due date at possible, so she was born 1 day before her due date.  Honestly, the planned c-section was fine (morphine is AMAZING).  I was walking the same day, she breastfed like a champion, and it really didn't matter.  I had my baby.   You also need to give yourself some space to mourn the birth experience you thought you were going to have. Yep, it's sad.  It's not what you wanted.  But you know what?  It's what your baby needs.  And as a very wise friend of mine said, it's still a birth.  It's no less miraculous because you need a little help.  It's still this amazing little life coming out of your body.  So mourn it, but also realize that you still get a birth experience.  It's just different that you envisioned...like so much of parenting."

beyondthebump,3dnspb,Nikita_pit,2,Sat Jul 18 10:04:31 2015 UTC,"I'll add more some more ideas- it depends on what other work you already have done as to what would fit with your style.   You could do the star signs of the kids, as a picture (ex Leo lion), the symbol, or the constellation.  Hand/foot prints  Date/time/weight/place in numbers (ex: mm.dd.yy hour:min lbs.oz 0000000lat 9999999long) this is a good one as you could add other siblings in a list underneath, and like your wedding details as well maybe?  Once they get older and start showing personality it's a bit easier to be able to pick different things to represent them.  If you have the Japanese style tats that are popular you can add baby animals to them (tiger+cub) (big koi + little koi)   Or something like a DNA strand?  Maori/pacific designs traditionally are used for showing the whole family tree A family crest?  Nature stuff lends itself to family type tattoos - new life etc - trees, fern fronds unfurling, birds in nests, bears with cubs, penguins..   Or maybe something more about you being a father an dthe strength/wisdom that brings rather than specifically about kidlet..?"

beyondthebump,3dnmq9,steelbydesign,13,Fri Jul 17 19:08:00 2015 UTC,"Everything you are experiencing sounds pretty normal for the first few months with a baby. It's really common for moms to be extremely concerned about their babies eating, diapers and sleep. As you know, it's a huge adjustment to be responsible for a tiny, needy human! But it sounds like your wife might benefit from hearing from others that your baby is doing just fine. Hospitals or community centers often offer mom/baby support groups. It might help ease her worries to talk with other moms. That said, if she feels her anxiety over your baby is overwhelming, she should definitely talk to her doctor. Postpartum anxiety is very real and can be treated."
beyondthebump,3dnmq9,risorius12,7,Fri Jul 17 19:15:13 2015 UTC,"It's pretty normal to worry or have some anxiety when you're a new mom, and your wife is probably still going through some hormonal changes that might be affecting her. But do you think this is outside of her usual behavior or personality type? It is possible she has something like post-partum anxiety.   The best thing you can do is be supportive and listen to her. Don't be dismissive when she's worried about something. Finding research to help calm her fears is helpful I'm sure, but if you think she's going beyond normal first-time mom anxiety you might want to talk with her about it. She may be struggling more than you know."
beyondthebump,3dnmq9,bonjourtabby,3,Fri Jul 17 19:15:03 2015 UTC,"This! I would feel so much better when I'd voice my concern about something to husband, and he'd come back a little later with research he found. It was just nice knowing he was listening and cared and was just as concerned as me (even if he was faking it)."
beyondthebump,3dnmq9,happyhapsy,8,Fri Jul 17 19:17:53 2015 UTC,"Are you my husband?!?! No, but really, that all sounds pretty normal (especially considering it sounds like there were some feeding issues...god, that fucks you up as a mom mentally and emotionally), the first few weeks I was an absolute wreck. There were nights I literally just stared at him all night because he had a bit of congestion so I was convinced if I didn't watch him he would strangle in his sleep. I almost wore a hole in my phone googling stuff. Good news is that at almost 12 weeks I have calmed down considerably.   Also keep in mind that as tired as you are, and I am sure you very well are, she's likely even more exhausted. She's just come out of 9 months of gestating, she's recovering from labor/csection, she's lactating. Her body is a veritable soup of hormones, instincts, and emotions right now.  All you can do is continue to be supportive. The first few weeks are hell, but it does get better eventually."
beyondthebump,3dnmq9,enyri,5,Fri Jul 17 19:44:10 2015 UTC,"3 weeks is still really, really early.  I feel like every woman goes through this, especially within the first month. What helped me was googling everything. Ha. I know people say ""whatever you don't, don't google it"" but to me it provided a sense of comfort knowing my baby wasn't the only one going through XYZ problem.  Maybe suggest BabyBumps community? A sense of community and knowing you're not alone is crazy helpful. Are there any mom/new baby groups in your area?   But, stay strong dude. I can't imagine being a husband in the new baby scenario. It's rough. Just be as annoyingly supportive as possible!"
beyondthebump,3dnmq9,happyhapsy,3,Fri Jul 17 19:15:04 2015 UTC,"As everyone is saying, what you, The baby, and her are experiencing is all normal.

She'd have a real time with him lol. I also I was waking my baby (per doc orders) every 2-3 hours to feed him and had no expectation at all for him to sleep all night. Babies eat constantly, just because it's night time doesn't change that. Sounds like she needs to learn more about babies to realize what's normal. Maybe buy her some books?"
beyondthebump,3dnmq9,JustCosmo,2,Sat Jul 18 05:36:52 2015 UTC,"The more you tell your wife to calm down and stop worrying, the worse it's going to get.   You need to reverse course and validate her fears. ""I understand you're upset about the baby sleeping through the night."" ""I hear that you're afraid you're doing something wrong."" Then just let it be. Don't try to fix it. Don't make suggestions. Just repeat what she's saying and drop it.   The harder you fight her the more ingrained her patterns will be. You have to just accept it and let her figure it out for herself.   It's the opposite of everything you want to do. But as soon as you stop trying to ""make"" your wife agree with you, both of you will be a lot happier.   Good luck! I knew it's frustrating."

beyondthebump,3dl3pk,sukithefox,41,Fri Jul 17 03:39:35 2015 UTC,"Ok so I get you had a bad day but for the record a parent asking questions then follow up questions about a bite, hit, bump on the head is not out of line.  If you picked up your kid and they had bite marks wouldn't you ask ""do you know how this happened?  do you know who might of done it?  If you don't know, do you know who would know"" - I would for sure want a big thorough explanation of what happened, and its not out of line for a parent to ask that.  Being upset about stains on clothing is ridiculous, kids are so messy - that would get my goat too.  On that vane, being upset about said bite/bump on the head is silly too, I'd want the whole story but this is normal kid stuff, so I get that part of what you're saying.   Also, those other parents probably ARE tired too.  You're judging their jobs and you have no idea what they do.  I often am on my feet all day even at my 'office job' - I'm an engineer who frequently has to walk our giant (4 football fields +) plant.  Its exhausting for them to be a working mom JUST LIKE ITS EXHAUSTING for you.    If your working conditions are this bad you need to complain to your employer.  You are legally entitled to breaks to pump - they'll have to work that out for you, and as an hourly worker you're entitled to regular breaks too.  Advocate for yourself with your employer, its not the daycare kid's parents fault that your working conditions are bad.    I thank our childcare workers all the time and really truly appreciate what they do.  But some of what you're explaining is just natural parents asking questions, and situations with your employer that parents have no control over.  edit also this is why maternity leave in the US needs to be longer!  You're hormonal from birth and breast feeding, missing your baby, still (likely) not 100% physically fit - This is hard!  I was lucky to have really nice supportive child care workers when I went back at 8 weeks, b/c I was NOT READY.  I also experienced super irritability with my boss/all co-workers too b/c I was mad that I even had to be there."
beyondthebump,3dl3pk,AHusbandAnd2Cats,17,Fri Jul 17 13:33:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah... this rant rubbed me the wrong way. It's not a competition of who has it worse. Everyone is tired. Everyone has bad days. I would never think to say to a daycare provider ""please tell me how mentally exhausted you are playing ring-a-round-the-rosie and reading toddler books all day while I make decisions that could mean life or death / cost my company millions of dollars / design a structure where the tiniest miscalculation could kill hundreds."" Or ""I got 3 hours of sleep last night but I still had to smile and be nice for my client lunch to not ruin the relationship with my company."" Because.. yeah. We ALL have to do that. This isn't unique to being a daycare provider and there's absolutely no reason to take it out on the parents because your employer sucks.    On a related note, these examples are exactly why I took my kid out of a big daycare. I'll be honest - I'm at work from 7-5pm. I don't have 15 extra minutes to spend at daycare searching for my kid's pants because there were 8 different adults in the room that day and nobody knows who put them where. I know my reply here sounds super negative, but I truly feel for daycare employees who have shitty management. That isn't fair and it sucks."

I think I talk a little too much about how much we disliked our Kindercare experience. A huge part of our dislike was the rotating teachers and their lack of communication with one another. We had a few recurring issues that we talked to both the teachers and the director about. Far too many times for comfort, it happened AGAIN and would be explained by ""oh well so-and-so was out and other-person covered, they must not have known."" - Right, that's why we mention it on the daily sheet we fill out every morning AND it's in our file.    I know there are good big box daycares - we have friends in other Kindercares and they love them - but our experience wasn't good. I think I also look back on it as worse than it was because of how wonderful our in-home is now."

Occasionally another one of the teachers from a different room lends a hand - this happens in any business like this, but I have found them all equally as competent and fabulous and I'd say 90% of the time its the same people."

A lot of times people get worked up - there's yelling, irrational anger at weird situations etc., and I'm the one who has to take it.    You HAVE GOT to learn to let it roll off your back, don't take it personally b/c if you can't do that or you'll just continue to get this pissed off/have your feelings hurt.  The way I handle it is to just kill them with kindness ""Oh no, I didn't write the report, but I can find out who did"", ""Sorry that onsie got stained, kids will do that!"" then whatever irrational response you get ""YOU STAINED IT ON PURPOSE"" just smile and say ""again, so sorry, hope you have a good day!""

But we are all held accountable for our work. I would ask a lot of these questions. If my child had a bump or bite when I came at pick up I'm going to expect an ouch report. If there was no report I would ask his teacher  at pick uo, expecting you to have communicated with the morning teacher. I hold you both accountable for the days events. If your center is not following labor codes in rest periods you should discuss  that with the director. You don't know what their job entails. And just because you are tired does not mean we aren't as well. We're all in the same boat."
beyondthebump,3dl3pk,BB_Queen,2,Fri Jul 17 13:34:04 2015 UTC,"Oh I had an ouch report for each injury, for the bump it even had the other teachers signature. The mom still blamed me.

And the mom complaining about her work is totally justified. But she went on for about half an hour, and everyone had to work around her and smile and listen, and in that time we REALLY should be watching the kids, but customer service is being stressed right now."
beyondthebump,3dl3pk,BB_Queen,7,Fri Jul 17 15:19:48 2015 UTC,"I'm am so sorry, parents suck sometimes. I cannot fully relate because my job is with a summer daycare that has very short days, mixing all age groups for most of the day (we take 4-14 year olds and only break off for a bit of the day), and to top it off its a FREE program for parents. They don't have to qualify for anything, don't have to make ""donations"" to reserve a spot, nope, fill out an emergency contact and allergy form and we will watch your child for a few hours while you do god knows what.  Just this week I had a mother get mad at me because her son was sent home from this program after violently dick punching another child. She told me how she wasted her time bringing him there and how we should have punished the child that got punched too because he obviously did something to deserve it. Okay lady, we didn't force you to bring your child, but we have done behavior reports everyday saying how he's constantly in time out, or cussing, or telling everyone how his dad's in prison (he makes sure to specify it's prison because and I quote ""jail is for pussies""; this child is 6). Nope lady, I can handle all the stuff that comes from his mouth that he obviously hears at home seeing as how all the obsenities he knows are flying out of your mouth, but he became physically violent with another child. He is not allowed back, he's pushed it too far. The other kid didn't actually do anything, he was currently in the middle of a game of go fish with me and 4 other children. When we asked your son why he did it he said he thought it'd be fun, so no, the other child did not deserve it. Now take your brat and get out of my face.  Normally I don't have many problems from parents, and usually we have 98% lovely kids. It's the 2% that I sometimes hate what I do, but then some sweet well behaved child will do something and I'm reminded why I love it again."

Sometimes I feel like pulling my hair out with one baby, forget a handful of them. I know most daycare workers are in it because they are passionate and loving and all around awesome, like you. But man, it scares me to think about my kid ending up with someone like your coworker (or worse) who doesn't give a shit about the job because you can make minimum wage anywhere, but has the immense stress of a room full of young babies."

And the last summer I worked their my kid's teacher came to me 2-5 times a day to tell me how rotten my kid was. Which sucked because I would walk past his room, watch another kid hit him, see him hit back and then he would be yelled at.   When you work there, and have your kid(s) there it's so much more difficult.

I especially feel bad for the woman that's in charge of my son.. she is so sweet and nice, and incredibly hardworking... and she drives a shit can of a car. Obviously I don't know her personal situation, but it just makes me feel bad that all these mom's pull up in fancy SUVs, and she's driving some 1980s crap on wheels.

A passenger in the row in front of me (middle seat, said he had kids and understood the need for help to be in the same row) offered to take my mom's seat and the guy next to him would switch to the middle so Asshole could have the aisle seat in front of us and my mother moved to his seat.   Every time any of us bumped the seat or the children made a noise, he turned around and leered.  He just made it unpleasant for everyone around him.

Lol, given his temper tantrums now, it's nice to think back to a time when a big public cry didn't happen that often!  I got pregnant with my second son with my first son was only 5 1/2 months old. At that same restaurant, after we brought in our younger son for the first time, two or three members of the waitstaff also expressed what looked like genuine shock at the fact that I had been pregnant (""I saw you a couple of times, and I never realized you were pregnant!""). Made me smile."

We've flown with our daughter from just about 4 months to most recently at 13 months and every time we've got compliments about how good she is, especially the last time when I flew with her alone. I say we're just lucky, they always reply that it's a reflection of her parents. (Still think we're lucky, though ;))  My favorite from when she was young was a short morning flight (Spokane to Seattle, so 45 minutes) and I was rocking my sleeping baby to keep her asleep the entire flight after nursing. Someone near us had our eye on us but after the flight said it was so sweet how I patted and rocked her so patiently. Aww."

It's a little dish that fits on your toilet and you can soak your parts in it. You can buy special postpartum sitz bath herbs online. You brew the herbs like a tea and sit in the sitz bath for 15 minutes. Then dump it out and replace with ice cold (literally ice) water and sit until it goes warm. The alternating hot and cold help aid healing. I healed way faster doing these soaks and wished I had from day one!"
beyondthebump,3dkzsm,ruby_saffron,4,Fri Jul 17 06:18:40 2015 UTC,"Congrats!! I also had a big hungry baby at 9lbs 8oz.  Although I had no supply issues and he latched great...it was still so hard! He would nurse for 30 mins on each side and then be hungry in another hour. My nipples were raw and I was in pain. I stuck it out exclusively breastfeeding for 2 weeks before I finally caved and gave him a bottle.  It..was..glorious! I finally got a break and his tummy finally got full. Now we are 5 weeks in and he gets mostly formula, I still breastfeed him a few times a day and this has worked for us.  Ultimately you need to do whatever works for your family.  Do not feel bad for a second if you decide to give formula.  No baby ever dropped out of college because they were formula fed.  I would keep in mind that once you stop breastfeeding all day it is super easy to slide into only formula.  I have stopped making a ton of milk but I have enough to give him a few ounces of breast a day.  It is nice to be able to boob him to sleep and still get that bond.  Good luck and you do you, don't worry about anyone else!"

Supplanting if OK to do. While breast is best... Fed is even better. It does take a bit for all the breastfeeding to be figured out. It's OK. My anecdotal advice: we tried to be as active as possible during the day. Walks, mall time ( if that's comfortable for you), just being active. Side note,a few days after we got home we went to a small mall. I couldn't walk more than 10 minutes before mommy was to physically exhausted to keep going. Then at night we wouldn't go anywhere, quiet time. It helped. Best advice is two fold. This too shall pass & it will get better. Also congratulations!!!! You're a mommy!!!"

I was on that for like 2 weeks round the clock then as needed for the next 2 weeks then I didn't need it anymore.  Pump every time you supplement to get that simulation and so your body knows its time to feed the baby.  Drink a shit ton of water, seriously when you think you can't drink anymore have 2 more glasses.  Also eat!  Nom nom nom.  And try to sleep lol just do your best on that one!  Just act differently - Days choose when it 'begins' we picked 7am and open all the windows turn lights on sing play tv vacuum everything.  Nights choose when that begins when she was that little we chose 8pm, the lights are dim, tv is low, interaction is low - feed, put back in bed no talking/singing.  Baby will eventually catch on.

beyondthebump,3dkzsm,emrose28,2,Tue Jul 21 16:16:52 2015 UTC,"Congrats!  About feeding I was lucky and didn't have any issues, I just fed every single time my daughter cried for the first few weeks. The more they attach the more you can build up your supply. One down side is you can develop a bit of an oversupply and cause a big rush on milk letting down. This can be helped by feeding laying on your back, or close to it, or laying down and feeding until your supply evens out. I personally would simply try and feed more and not supplement too much or too often but up to you, it is your baby and you need to be comfortable which what you do. Also do you swap sides during feeds?   Day/night - I decided not to wrap my daughter during the day, only at night and kept her in the lounge with me with light and noise during the day. Left her bassinet for night time only. Didn't take very long to get the two sorted as she loves being wrapped and even at 17 months likes to have a wrap on while she falls asleep at bed time.   Can't help you with the tear part, I had a section. My general advice is read everything, listen to everyone and then decide what you want to do and stick to it. Don't let someone else tell you want you should do, listen to what they have to say but if it is something you don't like, or don't feel comfortable with don't do it. And don't let anyone tell you you are doing something wrong! It is your baby not theirs!"
beyondthebump,3dkzsm,meadoweravine,2,Fri Jul 17 03:24:20 2015 UTC,Congrats! I had 3rd degree tearing too. It does get better! I made 'padsicles'- I froze large pads soaked in witch hazel. It helped a little too. Stay on stool softeners for a little while too. If you're not feeling more normal after a few months there's always pelvic floor PT.   Feeding- hang in there! I suggest you check out /r/breastfeeding. La Leche Leagues are also a great resource.  I understand how taxing it is to feed constantly. Supplementing formula can actually cause your milk to not come in as well and can sabotage successful breastfeeding. I'm not judging those who formula feed- I was just given the same advice (to supplement) and decided it wasn't right for us.  I was not prepared pre baby for just how much time I'd have to dedicate keeping him on the boob!   I promise it will all get better!
beyondthebump,3dkzsm,kmcg2375,6,Fri Jul 17 03:37:34 2015 UTC,Seconding the recommendation for /r/breastfeeding!  Supplementing with formula while your milk comes in will NOT help it come in.  Keep babe on the breast as much as possible!

beyondthebump,3dkzsm,love_is_life,3,Fri Jul 17 04:51:09 2015 UTC,"My milk was slow to come in so we supplemented with formula from days 3-6 (roughly?), then tapered off. Very small amounts, 10-20mls, 30 mls if she was really thirsty (30mls = 1floz). Also kept breast feeding at every demand, and also offer breast before bottle (this is important). Seriously, saved my sanity, she was so hungry and just kept crying, she couldn't sleep, I couldn't sleep. Milk came in a few days later and we fed fantastically after that."
beyondthebump,3dkzsm,bonjourtabby,3,Fri Jul 17 13:57:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, but that is supplementing in a very controlled way, and showed that it worked best with babies who were losing ""large"" percentages of their birth weights. Unless OP is supplementing only a third of an ounce per feeding exclusively with a syringe, and her baby falls into the range of having lost more than 5% of his birth weight, your link doesn't actually apply."
beyondthebump,3dkzsm,AlwaysWenning,2,Fri Jul 17 05:03:59 2015 UTC,"Donut pillow! Seriously, it is amazing and helped so much, even on my soft and cushy couch. It took the pressure off my stitches and butt. I took it with me everywhere.  Babies take a while to switch to day time regimen. Their circadian rhythms don't kick in for months, so there's that. To help, keep night time quiet. Low lights, little/no TV, quiet music, very little stimulation, dark bedroom. Changing a diaper? No talking to baby or making eye contact. Soothing baby? No eye contact. When it's day, make it bright and fun and stimulating.   Edit to add: babies cluster feed like crazy the first few days because their stomachs are tiny, growing and only hold a very small amount of food. Colostrum doesn't fill them for long and breast milk of any kind breaks down a lot quicker than formula. Try not to supplement much or for long, as that could impact your supply. Nurse as much as he needs and your supply should kick in. If you need help, eat oatmeal and take fenugreek. A lactation consultant can do wonders.  Also, congratulations!"

I continued to use the peri bottle for a long time though, because I was still freaked out about rubbing anything down there...  Breastfeeding is hard work in the first few weeks! Cluster feeding is totally normal and doesn't mean the baby is starving. They have tiny, tiny stomachs and can be satiated with a tiny amount of milk, but they'll keep on suckling. I swear we had some 6 hour non-stop sessions that only ended because I was going to lose it. Let the baby suckle as much as you can stand, and spend as much time as you can holding him (skin-to-skin is great!) to help build your supply. I remember worrying about how much he was getting and why he wanted to nurse constantly...in retrospect I wish I could have not worried and just enjoyed my little newborn. Hopefully your partner can be very supportive during clusterfeeding! I watched so much Netflix and just snacked and drank a ton of water.  When you supplement, go pump EVERY TIME so that your body doesn't think it can get by making less milk. We had to supplement in the first few days because my milk wasn't in yet and our son had high bilirubin levels. Formula can constipate a newborn so watch out for that.  Things in general are hard those first few weeks! But it will get easier. The baby will sleep more regularly and be less clingy (probably). You just have to get through these next few weeks. Have your husband or whoever you trust watch the baby for a few hours regularly so you can nap. It's so, so helpful. The baby will learn day and night soon. Try taking him outside every day to see the sunlight, and after sunset turn all the lights off and make the house dark and quiet for him. This will help him get his circadian rhythms in order.  Edit to second the recommendation for a sitz bath. It helps so much with the healing and also just feels good, and it's an easy way to get 15 minutes alone...your partner won't question it when you're soaking your sore vag in the weeks after giving birth!"
beyondthebump,3dkzsm,dealio,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:12:20 2015 UTC,"My milk didn't ever really come in well and it took us over a week to figure out what was wrong with my LO. Our lactation consultants suggested supplementing to help her out and I was devastated because my body wasn't doing it's job. Always try to offer the breast first (if you can, sometimes the pain was so bad I couldn't because of major latch issues the first two days) but then don't be afraid to offer a little formula after that.   In the beginning we were going through at least 8oz of formula per day...now we're down to about 3-4oz per day usually! So it does get better! Don't be upset about having to (or wanting to) supplement as long as you keep offering the breast it will be ok! I cried so much at first but now I'm glad we did it, a happy fed baby is better than an exclusive breastfed baby or a formula fed baby. It also gives my husband a chance to feed LO and have some special time with her while I get a break!  She started at 7lb 11oz, dropped down to 6lb 2oz, and is now (at 7w 3d) at 10lb 3oz! Best of luck Momma!!"

We took our 2-week-old to a basketball game. But, we were in a suite and were able to keep her tucked away in a corner in her carseat and make sure people didn't get too close.   I've been to a couple of those buffets and they can get a little crazy. So I'd just make sure you have a plan for avoiding the germs. Maybe get a table in a corner and plop him out of the way.

It may seem like she's being lazy, but when a baby is that young, that's kind of all she can do. Especially if there isn't much to do around the house. Once your baby gets older and starts interacting more I'm sure you will see her having less down time. I was a nanny for a family for a year and started when the baby was 3 weeks old. The first couple months that's how it was. I'd feed the baby. And he would sleep. I'd do some dishes. Make some food for the family if I was there late enough into the day. Do some of their laundry if needed. But there was a lot of time just hanging out waiting for the baby to need to eat or be changed again. Once he was about 3 months old and became more aware, I spent more time playing with him and keeping him entertained. But there was still sometimes some down time of just hanging out. If you're wanting her to do more you could maybe make a grocery list and have her do some shopping. Suggest taking the baby for a walk. Something like that.  I'm my experience being a nanny and babysitter, there were some differences. A babysitter is there for just that. Taking care of the kid. But as a nanny I did more things for the household/family.

I would unload a dishwasher and do their breakfast dishes or something...but not dishes from the night before or whatever. As baby gets more active, the nanny will be busier. If she is on her phone instead of interacting with baby, then that is a problem. Something to remember- as a nanny, you don't get 'breaks'...there is no 15 minute break every two hours or a lunch break- you are 'on' all the time. So sitting down and playing on a phone during a nap is just taking a rest.   I used to babysit in college for date nights and I told one of the parents one night that I felt bad that they were paying me the same rate all night, when most of the time the kids were sleeping and I was studying. They told me that they are paying me for my time and my time is valuable. It isn't like I could go run errands or meet up with a friend. I was there and my time is worth something. That made a lot of sense to me."

I'm mainly concerned because she has my kid sleeping for like 3 hours straight, and messing up her sleep at night.  Did you ever babysit in a situation where the parents were at home? I also did a lot of babysitting, but parents weren't around. I feel like it's a bit different with me at home all the time..."
beyondthebump,3dk9pl,AHusbandAnd2Cats,6,Fri Jul 17 02:10:11 2015 UTC,"If you're concerned about her sleep habits, then you need to give her a schedule, but expect chores to suffer as both she and baby adjust."
beyondthebump,3dk9pl,AHusbandAnd2Cats,5,Fri Jul 17 04:21:02 2015 UTC,"She's not forcing your baby to sleep 3 hrs straight, your baby is taking a nap...  Never wake a sleeping baby!  Also I have found - and there are books on this, sleep begets sleep, good naps during the day lead to good sleep at night."
beyondthebump,3dk9pl,frankmillie,-1,Fri Jul 17 13:46:26 2015 UTC,"I know, I've read that too! I think someone forgot to tell my baby...for her, these long naps seem to beget night wakings. And I had gotten so used to her sleeping through the night already :("
beyondthebump,3dk9pl,NannyDearest,3,Fri Jul 17 16:39:09 2015 UTC,"This is not the nanny's fault or the fault of 'too long naps'.  Babies that are 10 weeks old do not sleep through the night, you may have a few nights in there with a full 7-8hrs, but as a rule this isn't the norm.  Baby is hungry when she wakes up at this young age, and they need it for nutrition at this age too."
beyondthebump,3dk9pl,Yassssmaam,2,Fri Jul 17 17:56:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if the sleep schedule is pretty far off from what it looks like when you are taking care of baby, then you should talk with her about the schedule. Although, at that age, I don't feel like waking a baby up is normal. My own baby never slept for three hours at that age, no matter what I tried- ha. She was on a pretty consistent 35-45 minute nap every hour and a half...so still a lot of sleeping, but not long chunks.   I haven't been a nanny where it was the norm when the parent was there, but they have stayed home on occasion, whether sick or preparing for a trip or something. I find it is much harder to nanny when the parent is there...kids act different, I don't really know where my place is, etc...obviously that's for older kids.   Sounds like you probably just need to have a conversation about schedule."
beyondthebump,3dk9pl,skottysandababy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:52:52 2015 UTC,"It's normal for a new born to take 2-3 hour naps and to not sleep through the night. It seems like your expectations of your little one don't match reality but I promise, it has nothing to do with your nanny. She should be letting baby sleep as long as it wants during the day until 4-6 months, when a routine or pattern will begin to emerge. Even then, never wake a sleeping baby.   As far as feeling like you're paying her to do nothing you just need to reframe the way you're looking at it. Your nanny doesn't get to leave the house when babe is sleeping so you're paying her to be on call the moment she's needed. She doesn't get an hour for lunch break or time to run to the bank. Any time baby is asleep and her contractual obligations are met she should feel free to relax, read, do homework, watch tv, or play on her phone. That's how nannies work. Sorry if that isn't what you expected. It can be mentally exhausting to play with children all day, she deserves time to recharge."
beyondthebump,3dk9pl,notmymonkees,6,Tue Jul 21 23:29:14 2015 UTC,"She isn't relaxing. She's on call so you don't have to be.  Babies are supposed to sleep a lot. You're paying to have someone supervise your baby, respond so you don't have to, and do whatever housework you need.   If you want someone cheaper then just start interviewing nannies. But acting like your nanny should be moving every minute she's on the clock doesn't sound like a good plan."
beyondthebump,3dk9pl,meteorliath,8,Fri Jul 17 03:35:07 2015 UTC,"If you're paying her to be a nanny then that's all she should be doing, taking care of the kid.

beyondthebump,3dilli,teetow,2,Mon Jul 20 12:53:06 2015 UTC,"So it opens just enough to let the cat through, but not enough to let baby through?   Pretty much. The ""clip and strip"" maintains a gap of about 10cm (about 4""), which is plenty for our cat (but may be a problem for larger kitties).  Baby can theoretically trap herself if she reaches in and then leans on the door from the ""inside"" (the side towards which the door opens) but we haven't had any issues with that. They figure it out pretty quickly.  As a bonus, you can still close the door as usual -- the strip is flexible."
beyondthebump,3dilli,bellalinda,7,Mon Jul 20 14:06:22 2015 UTC,"My best advice is to have one room as solidly baby proofed as possible to allow for safe playing, whether that's the baby's room, a family room, or play room if you've got one. Get some cheap gates (North States makes $20 gates) to block off that room or trap baby in (or the more expensive gates if it is the top of a staircase). Then do all the outlet covers, wire covers, etc. It can be the one place where you can relax a bit and let the baby explore.  For actual baby-proofing items, we did all the furniture straps as we have a climber. We tried the corner and edge bumpers for the coffee table, but she made it her mission to pull them off no matter what adhesive we tried. I gave up after a few days on that. We put bungee cords across the bookshelves to keep her from pulling every book off (a favorite activity for awhile), and although she could still lift the books off, the bungee cords are enough of a deterrent. Our most recent purchase was closet locks for sliding doors since she discovered she could scale the shelving in there. I would recommend doing the baby-proofing in stages as needed. We had a company come out and do a consultation (free) and give us an estimate. After an hour of pointing out all the million ways our child could get hurt in our home, we got a quote of $4500 to baby proof everything. Then we went to Buy Buy Baby, spent about $100 on drawer locks, gates, and furniture straps and did it ourselves."

beyondthebump,3dilli,bellalinda,5,Thu Jul 16 19:32:24 2015 UTC,"I agree about doing it in stages- we eventually had to address more areas as she got taller and learned how to open doors, but it was less overwhelming to baby proof as needed instead of everything at once."

Basically, the parents recognize when the kid is going to go based on sounds/facial expression and hold the kid over the potty.

The vast majority of homeopathic medicines will be so dilute that a dose doesn't contain a single molecule of active ingredient.   Basically, there's no evidence that homeopathy works any better than a placebo. And obviously in the case of babies, it's you the parent who is subject to the placebo effect.

beyondthebump,3dkde0,jrfish,3,Thu Jul 16 23:45:49 2015 UTC,I got a long baby gate and put everything that I don't want baby to touch against one wall and then blocked off that wall with the gate. And then the rest of the living room has the normal baby proofing stuff!
beyondthebump,3dkde0,thekenzta,2,Fri Jul 17 00:13:46 2015 UTC,Shelves were our best friends. We basically put wall mounted shelves everywhere we could and just put everything as high up as we could. Ikea has great ones and they are pretty sturdy if you anchor them properly. We also got some storage cubes and those have been great. They have softer edges (when the tops aren't trays) and are generally heavy enough to support the baby/toddler. My son didn't figure out how to open them until he was two so it buys you some time. Hope that helps.

You can technically get a tummy tuck at the same time as your c-section, however I would think that waiting until your uterus has shrunk down would give better results."
beyondthebump,3dlja3,QuiteSimplyJane,6,Fri Jul 17 13:54:25 2015 UTC,"Since you have no idea how your body will recover after baby #2, I wouldn't rush to get all that done.   What kind of boob job? Bigger or smaller or just lifted? I had a breast reduction several years ago, and let me tell you, recovery is a nasty bitch. There's no way you'd be able to pick up a baby for at least 3 months after that surgery. So yeah, give it time. But good luck! I'm somewhat jealous... I absolutely hate my postpartum tummy."
beyondthebump,3dlja3,happyhapsy,3,Fri Jul 17 15:19:22 2015 UTC,Lipo is typically done before or during a tuck as there is no point getting rid of excess skin only to remove more fat and create more excess skin
beyondthebump,3dlja3,Amy_MUA,2,Fri Jul 17 17:44:31 2015 UTC,"From people I've heard of doing this :   http://www.realself.com  Is very valuable, especially for the U.S. My understanding is you should get at least three quotes/appraisals from different surgeons and maybe find specialists for each aspect you'd like to take care of. May as well get it right the first time."
beyondthebump,3dlja3,katarzynawid,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:38:23 2015 UTC,"I always thought that liposuction would be best done before a tummy tuck if that's where you're removing tissue.  Otherwise you get the tummy tuck and then remove fat and after the second procedure the skin isn't as tight as before.  Of course if you talk to a surgeon he'll probably have a preferred process.  Some do liposuction during a tummy tuck to consolidate recovery time and costs.  It does make recovery more painful.  As for boob jobs, fake boobs tend to be painfully obvious and very hard.  A lift is much more natural looking/feeling.  If you do implants, pick a plastic surgeon who does cosmetic work.  It can be very different than reconstruction.  Don't be afraid to Google names and look for reviews online.  Surgeons can end up with a certain ""style"" or way they always do a procedure.  If you look through their before and after photos, and everyone has the same tummy/boobs at the end, then make sure you like them and that they would look good on you.  Also comparison shop since there is a huge variety in pricing and you don't get what you pay for in this branch of medicine.  You pay what the local market charges regardless of the skill level of the surgeon.  Personal recommendations are best, if you can get them."

beyondthebump,3dhdjz,bandgeek_foreves,19,Thu Jul 16 07:50:37 2015 UTC,"Sleeping with him on the recliner is far more dangerous that bed-sharing done safely, sorry! If you're sleeping upright, your baby could fall off or slip and get wedged against the cushions.  Why do you feel better if he's downstairs in the pack and play? Some anxiety about your baby is normal, I used to have to check that my daughter was still breathing every so often too. But post partum anxiety is a very real thing. If you think PPA could be an issue for you, then I'd advise you speak to your doctor, there are tons of things that can be done to help. Also I know you are going to get replies suggesting breathing monitors, if you think you might have anxiety then I'd think very carefully before getting one. Sometimes doing things like that to make you feel safer can feed clinical anxiety and make things much worse and then you look for something you can add to make yourself feel safer and it all just escalates."
beyondthebump,3dhdjz,mediocrity511,7,Thu Jul 16 08:06:39 2015 UTC,"This, sleeping upright in the recliner is far more dangerous than following safe bed sharing recommendations. It is especially dangerous since you are so tired.  I can identify with your feelings though. With my first born I really led myself to extreme exhaustion by failing to sleep. I had my second child a week ago. I will say the key to sleeping for me has been to sleep with her on my chest for now. I can feel her, feel her breathing, and I know she is safe.  Good luck, newborns seem so fragile and delicate at first. It's nearly impossible to not worry, your now deeply invested in someone else's well being. But it will get easier, and I think the first step will be to try and identify a way you are comfortable sleeping and  they are safe. Even if it is spending the money on a snooza so if they did stop breathing an alarm would wake you up."
beyondthebump,3dhdjz,MustacheBus,3,Thu Jul 16 10:37:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, the recliner is 100% more dangerous.  I bedshare and was not ever willing to nap with the baby on the couch!  That being said, I think the anxiety is mostly normal.  I was terribly anxious.  I'm still a little anxious about when he's asleep (my son chooses to sleep in all the dangerous ways).  It gets better as their head control increases and they become more aware of things.  When I watch my son nap on our Drop Cam, I can see how easily he moves his head to change his position.  LOTS of anxiety dissipated then.  You'll get there.  You are being a good mama looking out for your munchkin.  But don't sleep on the recliner with him!"
beyondthebump,3dhdjz,goldenw,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:11:52 2015 UTC,"I think he sleeps better in the pack and play... In the bassinet he makes all these snorting and congested noises and can't seem to really settle. At this point I think my anxiety is just new mom/tired related, also, the fact we were in the nicu is playing games because I was so used to just seeing his heart rate and knowing he was safe at all times. Never thought I'd miss being there!!  I will definitely keep an eye on myself and if it doesn't get better in a few weeks I'll mention it to my doctor. Thank you"
beyondthebump,3dhdjz,KimberSliceAZDD,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:01:28 2015 UTC,I know exactly what your feeling mama! We were in the NICU for 10 days and as anxious as I was there I was also relaxed because I knew the nurses were there with us 24/7. Once we got home I was the same way. The first few weeks honestly just plain suck. I did bed share those first weeks for sleep but we were up every 2 hours to nurse. It just gets better eventually. You start just kinda instinctually knowing your baby and what his noises mean and eventually you get some sleep! Get sleep when you can. Housework be damned. You need to live like your a newborn yourself! Just eat and sleep! Take advantage when you can with hubby or any Other family to let you sleep while they watch baby.

beyondthebump,3dhdjz,love_is_life,2,Thu Jul 16 22:30:04 2015 UTC,"It will get better.  I remember when my son was around that age, and I would drift off to sleep, then startle awake because I was convinced that my baby was in my arms, and why was the baby in my arms as I'm drifting off to sleep on the couch/in the bed???  I'm going to drop him!  Of course, he was actually in the bassinet next to our bed, but it was such a weird feeling that happened often in the first weeks.  We moved the baby into his crib in his room at around 8 weeks (long story short, he grew super uncomfortable in his bassinet, and took to the crib really well).  Talk about anxiety!  We have an audio monitor, not a video one.  I was always so paranoid when I didn't hear him making any sounds, convinced that I would go in to check and he would be lifeless.  It really just gets better with time.  Now, at 7 months, I enjoy the longer stretches of sleep, and don't feel so much anxiety."

beyondthebump,3dhdjz,sellyberry,2,Thu Jul 16 13:54:16 2015 UTC,"If you are this anxious, I would suggest getting a baby breathing monitor. They attach to the diaper and alert you if the baby stops breathing.   Also, I know it's comforting, but you need to stop sleeping with him on your chest. If he isn't lying flat, his chances of suffocating are increased exponentially. He has no neck strength and even his position or the way he sleeps against you and your clothes could smother him. You are so fatigued you may not even know it until it's too late. If you're more comfortable with him in the pack n play,  let him sleep in there! It's perfectly safe. Can you put a video monitor nearby or even move the PNP to your room?"
beyondthebump,3dhdjz,atasteofhappiness,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:17:06 2015 UTC,Thank you... I think I really needed to hear this.

beyondthebump,3dhdjz,snarklepop,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:47:15 2015 UTC,"I think there are good suggestions here (re: the AngelCare mat or a clip on baby monitor like the Snuza).    I will say that I think that to an extent this is normal.  I know I felt like this the first couple weeks at home.  I think part of the problem is that when you are so sleep deprived, the anxiety is even worse.  I felt that once I caught up on a little sleep, I was able to start relaxing a little, but for the first month home I think I was really only able to truly relax when I knew someone else was awake with the baby in another room.   What helped me the most was when we started giving LO a bottle of pumped milk once a day (not an issue if you are formula feeding, but we waited until 3 weeks to give a bottle since my son was nursing) ... I would go to bed immediately after nursing my son at around 7pm.  My husband would stay awake with him and give him his bottle when he got hungry, and take care of everything baby for awhile.  This was after my husband went back to work, but my husband generally stayed up until midnight most nights.  Sometimes my son would need to nurse again, but he would bring me the baby and then take baby once he was done nursing until that midnight time.  This let me get some good chunks of 4ish hours of sleep.  That made a huge difference and let me start to relax a little and reason with myself that my baby was fine, was sleeping in a safe place right near me, and that it was ok for me to sleep.  If you feel like your anxiety is getting worse or not getting better by 6 weeks post partum, please talk to your doctor.  Everyone seems to know about postpartum depression, but postpartum anxiety is also a thing and you can get help!  That said, I do think this kind of anxiety at first is normal.  One day you are responsible for yourself, the next day you are responsible for this fragile-seeming little thing that needs you for everything!    If you can have a relative stay with you or if you can spring for a baby nurse for a night or two, that also might help you catch up on enough sleep to calm down a little.  I know those aren't always feasible for everyone."

Turned out that I had a severe case of post-partum anxiety.  Looks like others are mentioning that possibility.  I would recommend calling about it today if possible - I declined very rapidly between 3-4 weeks after birth, to the point that I could barely function, and I couldn't believe how quickly I went from feeling okayish to feeling most definitely not even close to okay.  Seeking help early is really helpful.  Even if it turns out this is just normal new mom stuff, it can't hurt."

Try to lean on your husband as much as you can for the next week until he goes back to work and have him watch the baby so you can sleep.

Also, I felt/feel like such a failure when I think about my delivery. I was in labour for 21 hours with an epidural at 12ish hours and three hours of pushing which exhausted me. When I think about how long it took me to push my son out, I feel like a failure which is the stupidest concept. I wish women would talk more about effective pushing!

I barely had any bleeding, such a small amount of lochia that a panty liner just became annoying. My stomach is by no means perfect, I still have some separation and I have done ZERO ab work (except yoga). I had a first degree tear with 2 stitches, yes it burned a little but the spray and sitz baths really helped. Every woman is different, everyone will heal at different paces and of course course everyone has their own perception of pain."
beyondthebump,3dehuf,meowmeowlove,8,Wed Jul 15 23:59:05 2015 UTC,"I think OP's point was to talk about the potentials that could come. Recovery, vaginal pain/dryness, sex, all that stuff isn't talked about nearly as much as it should be. Women are told they will be healed usually by about six weeks, so it can be shocking and upsetting when they're not ready for everything by then. It is good that OP is being honest with her experience and that others can see that what they may go through/have gone through is a shared experience and ""normal."" Prepare for the worst, hope for the best."
beyondthebump,3dehuf,pamplemousse3583,2,Thu Jul 16 02:10:12 2015 UTC,I understand and respect what she is saying but it does sound scary and isn't always the case.

beyondthebump,3dehuf,spifflett,6,Thu Jul 16 04:46:45 2015 UTC,I'm glad this was not your experience! And I hope you get other ladies responding that their respective recoveries were a little easier as well!
beyondthebump,3dehuf,punchyourfacein,2,Thu Jul 16 07:13:04 2015 UTC,"I'm more like you, I think I only bled heavily in the hospital then lightly at home for no more then 3 weeks.  My stomach is back to normal at 8 mths out and was pretty normal at 4 months.  Sex is still a hurdle for me though, mainly b/c I'm so exhausted working and taking care of a house/baby I think!"

beyondthebump,3dehuf,LostInTheAtlantic,2,Thu Jul 16 03:39:12 2015 UTC,"I definitely took a very long time to heal. At 10 months out I'm finally getting back to normal sexually (yay!). I had the heavy discharge for many months coupled with pelvic floor soreness until like 7 months pp. Sex hurt. So. Bad. I'm young and fit and healthy and didn't even tear much giving birth, but it took forever for my pelvic floor to tone up. Once I got my period though, BAM, libido was back and sex started feeling great again."
beyondthebump,3dehuf,CactusCait,2,Thu Jul 16 00:46:00 2015 UTC,"My own experience was very similar to this. I'm a year out from birth (3rd degree tear) and my husband and I need to take sex slow for a few minutes because it's uncomfortable for me. Even with lots of lube and foreplay. Thankfully it's  only uncomfortable for a short while. It's nice to hear other women having similar experiences. You start to wonder if your vagina will always be like that, but it's so much better than a few months after I gave birth."
beyondthebump,3dehuf,34F,2,Thu Jul 16 02:46:50 2015 UTC,"What about the saggy skin? To be honest, my bleeding stopped at a week and a half and I healed wonderfully. My stomach muscles feel fine, but I have tons of excess skin that still hangs there :/ I'm 7 weeks out. It's really affecting my self esteem because it is really noticeable. I still have people ask if I'm pregnant because of this excess. How long should it take before I go other routes? I exercise regularly and breastfeed."

She prescribed Estrace (vaginal estrogen) and its $100 even with insurance! There is no generic. We can't afford it right now so we just aren't having sex. It sucks so bad, I miss it sooo much.

I have no real advice, just wanted to say that I got my period back at 14 months despite still breastfeeding 4-6 times a day. BUT my daughter did start sleeping through the night occasionally (lol like twice) and I guess that was enough to get the engine started up again. My sex drive started right up just before my period came back. Things still aren't what they once were, but the past few weeks have been majorly different than what it was like for the previous year.

No I am generally opposed to hitting children, but I believe that even most people who do believe that spanking is a valid form of discipline would agree that losing your temper and hitting a 4 year old in the head has nothing to do with discipline and is simply abusive.  I could not be friends with someone who abuses his kids."

Once when his daughter wasn't listening he took a ball and threw it at her head as hard as he could. She was 4 at the time. And he's not only like that with his kids but his wife. He doesn't hit her but he has been mentally and emotionally abusing to her. ""You're a horrible person. You're stupid."" And he tells her regularly that he hates her.   He's chilled out a lot over the last couple years but it's still there. We have cut down how much we hang out with them partly because of this behavior.   I hate it..."

What if you find out later that he did something even worse like broke a kid's arm? I would approach the wife first and see if she wants help to leave him. This does not sound like a healthy relationship. Otherwise call CPS or at least the child's school. Hitting a child in the face is not discipline."
beyondthebump,3dgs2o,Lillyroseviolet,5,Thu Jul 16 13:02:23 2015 UTC,"When dealing with a person who continues to do something once you've expressed how it bothers you, you have to be straight forward and blunt. You can't beat around the bush, or be nice about it. You don't have to be mean either, just firm. Let him know not to spank/hit his children in front of yours. And if he can't respect you asking that of him, he need to have him leave. I know its difficult, but if you really don't want your children around that, then you have to prevent it. You can't blame him if youre allowing him to be around your children in the first place.   My mothers husband is like that.. He doesnt understand boundaries & I refuse to have my son around him. I never want him to hold my son, talk to him, ect. So its my responsibility to keep my son away from him because if I put my son in a position where he is around her husband and something happens, its my fault for taking my son there in the first place."
beyondthebump,3dgs2o,Lillyroseviolet,2,Thu Jul 16 05:23:19 2015 UTC,I fully agree. I have to protect my kids. I talked with my husband about it and he feels exactly the same way I do. I'll probably talk to her about it cuz he gets super defensive. He has major ego issues so ANY time someone disagrees with him about anything even small things he gets super bent out of shape. He got super pissed off at my husband once because he disagreed about his opinion on a particular cell phone. And didn't talk to him for like a week. So I think I'm gonna talk to her. She gets defensive easily too but if I approach it right she's pretty open.

But they're always in the right context. So while we're hoping she'll start coming up with her own sentences and actually be able to have a back and forth conversation, she's at least able to communicate her needs better.

The father is abusive. Your children could feel traumatized for being exposed to witnessing the father's abuse. It is also confusing and unhealthy to know an adult, a ""safe"" adult, did not stick up for the victim or protect them. At the least, the victims will remember that you knew and did nothing. That is something that would trouble me. I personally feel the mother needs to step up and protect her kids but for whatever reason she is choosing not to. I would not be okay with that. The examples you have given of the father's behavior are very disturbing. It may not happen all the time but it is abusive, and likely occurs at home even more and possibly to a more significant degree. You really need to reevaluate whether you are ok being a bystander in this situation. At the least, protect your own kids from witnessing abuse."

I don't want to accuse anyone of abusing their child or tell them how to parent, and granted I wasn't there.  But a hand slap across the face doesn't seem like appropriate constructive behavioral feedback for an 8 year old.  Can you approach the mom and say, ""I know this is odd, but my daughter was very upset when (husband) was punishing (child).  We are trying to not use those types of strategies because (your child) doesn't respond well.  What sorts of things warrant punshiments for your family so we know when to redirect (your child) or walk away?""    If nothing else you've let her know that it's upsetting behavior for the dad to participate in and that you are pulling your kid away from that.  Or you could say, ""we're only hanging out with people who don't abuse their children."" Because even if they are friends, you don't want your kids to be around it.  Neither would I."

How does your current job fit in wirh your future plans?  Also, consider anything else you get from your employer, such as health benefits, tuition reimbursement, valuable experience, pension, contacts, and so on.    And that's just for the economics.

Taking a year or more off of work will significantly affect your lifetime earnings and your retirement savings.

beyondthebump,3derte,macm2,4,Thu Jul 16 00:06:41 2015 UTC,I disagree with this as it totally depends on your profession and circumstances. i don't think having a gap in your CV of a couple years spent raising a child or children carries the same stigma it may have in the past. And employers are starting to recognise the benefits of retaining experienced staff through part-time work.
beyondthebump,3derte,fernyfantastic,4,Thu Jul 16 04:12:08 2015 UTC,I think this is a rosy glow view of the world.  Taking extended time off and having a resume gap would for sure affect my career.  I'd take a pay cut when I came back.  Especially if I did this for every kid I had.
beyondthebump,3derte,AHusbandAnd2Cats,0,Thu Jul 16 13:04:06 2015 UTC,Wow really? A pay cut for having a baby? I'd have thought that would be discrimination and illegal.
beyondthebump,3derte,fernyfantastic,3,Thu Jul 16 19:38:06 2015 UTC,"No.  Say I'm currently making 100k per year.  And I want an extended maternity leave of 2 years with my baby.  I would have to quit my job.  And when I went to find a new job after that 2 years question #1 will be ""why is there a 2 year unemployment gap in your resume?""  When you say its b/c you stayed home that will come off a few ways - it shows that you are not 'hip' to the industry b/c you've been out of the game, and it shows that a career is not your priority.   Cue them lowballing you.  Even if you could make the 100k again, which I think is a stretch you will have missed out on 2 years of raises that you will never get back.    Then after you take another 2 years (per this example) - same thing happens.  This isn't discrimination, its business.  You don't pay people MORE then what they left the work force at for an elective absence.  Best chance you get what you got when you left, most realistic stance is its less.  Until maternity leave culture is changed in this country - this is reality."
beyondthebump,3derte,AHusbandAnd2Cats,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:43:52 2015 UTC,"This example still sounds like discrimination to me. Granted, hiring discrimination is extremely difficult to prove, but I'm pretty sure ""having kids"" is in the same category of personal attributes employers can't discriminate on the basis of as religion, marital status, sexual orientation etc.  I'm certainly not saying that mothers should be able to return to work on more pay than when they left, BUT provided they can demonstrate that they have made reasonable effort to get back up to speed prior to returning by attending conferences, maybe a bit of training etc, there should be no reason they can't expect to resume their careers at a similar point to where they left off.  But then, I live in a country (not the US) with pretty strong industrial relations laws and where most women take around 12 months leave for each baby, so gaps in employment histories for childrearing are pretty common."
beyondthebump,3derte,fernyfantastic,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:01:03 2015 UTC,"No.  This would go for someone who took a 2 year break for another reason.    And its not discrimination b/c you have freely QUIT YOUR JOB.  So they don't owe you your job back, and can pick candidates for jobs that don't have resume gaps.  This is the nature of the beast.  Its like saying that someone wanted to go on safari for 2 years, quit their job, and they should make the same amt as before.  really that show's they'd rather do something else (vacation) for 2 years and are ok with freely quitting their jobs.    FMLA only covers 12 weeks.  Anything more than that companies don't have to keep your job, in the US.  Anything more then the 12 weeks its not discrimination not to hire you back.  Rules is rules, whether they are right or wrong.    I'd love to have government protected 12 months though, how nice!"
beyondthebump,3derte,AHusbandAnd2Cats,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:05:23 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm not talking about being hired back by the same employer you had prior to having a baby, but taking a year or two out of paid work and upon returning (applying for a new job) being discriminated against for being a parent and having had a break in your career history. It would be pretty sad if you were forced to work nonstop from early adulthood to retirement without ever being able to take time out - for travel, raising kids, caring for elderly parents, writing a fricking novel - without being penalised for it."
beyondthebump,3derte,fernyfantastic,2,Fri Jul 17 02:14:04 2015 UTC,You are obviously not American.  Here that is absolutely not ok - work work work :(.  Employers would laugh you out of the joint for thinking its ok to take year(s) off to travel etc.

That really sucks that on top of having minimal mat leave, you're penalised for taking unpaid time off to raise a baby. That's just horrible! I have colleagues who have returned to work after 2, 3 or 4 years off and while they haven't gone up while away (of course) they are able to return to pretty much the same level of position as before.  Fun fact: My employer (state education dept) actually DOES financially recognise time spent as a full-time parent. 2 years counts as 1 year of employment service in terms of progressing up the pay scale. But they are the exception."

We originally had signed up with Kindercare, then my husband found a different place for nearly $100/week cheaper.   The older your kid is, the cheaper it is, too. And most places will have a discount if your kid only goes 4 days, or 3 days, or whatever.  Also, do you or your husband have any kind of FSA account?

I get away with a $90/week child care bill because my MIL (also a gem) watches my son twice a week (for free).

beyondthebump,3derte,sailorgaia,5,Wed Jul 15 20:31:20 2015 UTC,"Yep. Literally half of my money goes to daycare and half of the remaining money goes to student loans. That tiny bit of ""extra"" plus covering health insurance justifies having me work instead of living off of my husband's income. It's crazy.    The MINIMUM price of daycare in the my county is $1020 - with a median of $1387 and 75th percentile is $1725. That means 25% of daycares cost more than $1725 per month! In-home daycares can go as low as $920, but even those still get pricey. Of course, data is only available by county (not city) and I live in Seattle proper - which means that we get the higher end of these numbers because outside of the city = cheaper. I've never seen anything close to $1300 in the city for infant care (mostly $1600+). That doesn't even consider the fact that waitlists are often longer than 1 year. It's been 10 months and I haven't heard anything from the 3 lists I'm still on...    So uhh... my rant aside... yeah. It sucks. My family lives 3000 miles away. The free/cheap babysitter is a foreign concept to me. Check if your school provides daycare or if they have discounted daycare. Alternatively, you do something like a weekend job / food industry and work opposite hours than your partner and avoid paying for daycare. It's hard until you can find a way to make more money or you move somewhere cheaper."
beyondthebump,3derte,because__science,3,Wed Jul 15 19:17:54 2015 UTC,This is why I went down to part-time. My mom babysits so we don't have to pay for daycare.

beyondthebump,3derte,Odomoso,2,Thu Jul 16 02:24:03 2015 UTC,"Not that much.  It's enough to be comfortable, but definitely not enough to absorb a hit like daycare without some pretty serious adjustments."

beyondthebump,3derte,AHusbandAnd2Cats,2,Thu Jul 16 13:06:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah... in my area childcare is around $120 per DAY for babies under 1 year old. So, about $2400 per month, and we don't qualify for government rebates because we both earn too much.   BUT, I'm in a country where most women take between 6-12 months maternity leave so there aren't a lot of under 1s in daycare. It gets cheaper after 1 year as the staff to baby ratios go down."

That makes it around $10/hour.  Which is a steal really for the amount of work infant care takes.  We use a big corporate daycare and we love it.    I don't see it as sacrificing my income, I see it as peace of mind knowing my LO was well taken care of all day.  I still get my income and I guess I'm 'happy' to pay for quality care.  I would see it as sacrificing my income should I quit my job to stay home though.    If you're looking for some less expensive options you could check out a nanny share, an in-home daycare or depending on how low your income is, whether you can get a subsidy."

You also have to figure the other benefits of going back to work like personal growth and intellectual stimulation if that matters to you. It does to us. Neither of us would be particularly fun to live with staying home all day but that may not be you.

beyondthebump,3derte,generallyok,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:03:55 2015 UTC,The cost is ridiculous. We just adjusted our schedules so our kids are only in daycare part time. 1. Because it cuts the cost by 30% and 2. Because we like having them with us.

beyondthebump,3ddg1g,fatmama923,10,Wed Jul 15 20:01:20 2015 UTC,"Well...  why not beer? The problem is the alcohol, and beer has a much lower ABV than wine does.  If we're going on ""pregnancy advice"" and ""a glass of something"" being the unit of measure, seems like beer is the safer choice."
beyondthebump,3ddg1g,wheeeethrowaway,2,Wed Jul 15 22:35:12 2015 UTC,"Nope, because it's about percentages.   A standard serving of 5% v/v beer is 12 oz. That's 0.6oz of alcohol.   A standard serving of 12% v/v wine is 5 oz. Again, 0.6oz alcohol. Some servers serve 6oz wine, so you get even more (and people notoriously pour out more than that when pouring themselves ""just a glass"" of wine).   So people typically consume the same amount or more more alcohol by drinking wine than they do by drinking beer. Naturally different beers and wines have varying alcoholic content, so you might get more alcohol in a standard beer volume, but you get the idea.   For places where alcohol is sold in weight/volume, since ethanol is less dense than water, a 5% beer is a bit stronger than a 5% volume/volume one (takes more ethanol to match one weight unit of water).  And thus ends your math and chemistry lesson for the day. ;)"

If I felt very confident with the gizmos, and less anxious, I'd have probably gone 6 weeks or later but no sooner than that due to that risk of exposure to communicable diseases on planes. All those respiratory viruses are so serious for newborns... I'm also a nurse and hear all the horror stories.  I don't have great advice either way, I guess I just know the feeling of wanting to go to your best friends wedding despite all the reasons not to."
beyondthebump,3dgnug,because__science,2,Thu Jul 16 05:25:49 2015 UTC,Yup. If the baby was for SURE going to be past 6 weeks I'd be way more into the idea of going-probably still on the fence but leaning towards going. I know I'd probably be in pretty good shape by then (not withstanding a major delivery complication which is still always a possibility) and the baby would have had at least a few shots by then for some protection. Plus a 6 week old baby is way bigger and sturdier than a 3 week old baby. I just feel guilty missing his big day and sorry for myself. I know he'll understand and it's fine-it's not like I'm the groom! I just hate to miss it. He's been there for all of my big moments. I'm also totally fucking jealous of the fact that my husband can just fly across the country to go to his friend's wedding the week before without having to think about these things! Sorry you had to miss your bff's wedding too. Maybe both couples will renew their vows? In some awesome kid friendly place? In 10 years time? A we can go to those ceremonies?
beyondthebump,3dgnug,Tudie86,2,Fri Jul 17 00:07:56 2015 UTC,"This might not be possible-but can you wait to buy your plane tickets and decide if you can go, after your delivery? So many variables with the delivery and recovery period that I would be very hesitant to make any concrete plans until I made it through the other side. Especially if you ended up with a C-section, I don't think you'd be ready to fly or attend the wedding and then you'd be out the money for the flights. Leaving it up in the air is not ideal, but that's how I'd play the situation. And hopefully you have a super smooth labour and delivery and are feeling like a rockstar and can be there for the big day!"
beyondthebump,3dgnug,zuggyziggah,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:57:53 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about this option. If anything I think I'd buy the ticket and then pay the change fee since waiting will just mean that the airfare will skyrocket. It's just so frustrating! If it was sooner, I'd know I couldn't go. And if it was just a little later-after the baby was six weeks and had some shots, gained some weight, etc, I'd totally go. It's this totally dicey 3-4 week situation that's so tricky. But I guess it's not really based on the answers here. Thanks for responding."
beyondthebump,3dgnug,Wdc331,2,Thu Jul 16 23:45:56 2015 UTC,"Two couples I know flew cross country at 2-3 weeks (WA to NJ, WA to MA - one had c-section, one didn't) and it was by far a million times easier than flying with an older baby. One of them went to a wedding where her husband officiated, actually. If I had a reason, I definitely would've flown at that age... BUT I don't know what it's like throwing a toddler into the mix. October is still before peak cold and flu season so I personally wouldn't be too worried about germs - it's easy to keep baby close to you. If it's important for you to go and to see family, definitely bring the whole family and let husband primarily take care of toddler."
beyondthebump,3dgnug,Wdc331,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:45:23 2015 UTC,"The toddler is WAY more work. Infants are actually super easy to fly with usually. No ear issues because they haven't developed all that stuff yet. They can't get really loud yet because they have tiny lungs. The only issue we had with my first was throwing up. Our second flight with him he projectile vomited all over me. Fortunately I was wearing layers and had a change of clothes. I wouldn't be as worried about germs if the baby was past the six week marker and had all of those shots... That said, my first was born in NYC and I took him on the subway all the time which is probably more disease infested than most airplanes. Thanks for your response. It's good to know I'm not crazy for considering it."
beyondthebump,3dgnug,eastwoodhs,2,Thu Jul 16 23:53:14 2015 UTC,"We just attended a wedding last week when our daughter was 4 weeks old. I had a vaginal delivery, no tearing and healed really quickly. It was an awesome night! We drove three hours with her and our 17 month old and left the older one with my mom before we drove another hour to the wedding. I breastfeed and the wedding was outside so I just went to a bench when she was hungry and it was no big deal. Plus because she sleeps most of the time it felt like a night out with my hubby and I got to have a drink and chill out with old friends. I'd say if you are feeling good go for it."
beyondthebump,3dgnug,eastwoodhs,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:13:44 2015 UTC,"YES. If I could drive, I would totally be going. We'd bring the bebe to the wedding (grooms are fine with it) and leave the toddler (who is way more work) with relatives to have a lovely evening catching up with friends we rarely see. Le sigh. It's just the flying bit that makes it all so complicated. Happy you had a fabulous time at the wedding!"
beyondthebump,3dgnug,eastwoodhs,2,Thu Jul 16 23:55:24 2015 UTC,"First, I would absolutely not bring an infant that young on an airplane, especially once cold and flu season has started. So taking the infant would be right off the table for me.   Second, I wouldn't be up for it myself - I've had c-sections and there's no way I could have managed a flight at 3 or 4 weeks post partum, if my doctor would even have allowed it (I still wasn't able to lift anything heavier than the baby at that point, so I couldn't have put my suitcase in an overhead bin or even on the scale at the ticket office, for example). I was a sopping, sobbing mess of milk and tears and spit-up most of the time, getting sleep in 45-minute increments, prone to falling asleep while sitting up and unable to make interesting conversation with anyone. I still looked five months pregnant and wore nothing besides sweat pants and nursing tank tops.   If you can afford it, maybe buy a refundable plane ticket so that if it does seem like it will work out, you can go but if not, you can put the money towards a future trip. There are so many variables that are out of your control (what if your baby comes two weeks late, making you only 2 weeks pp? what if you have a c-section? what if your baby comes several weeks early and is in the NICU when you would be traveling? what if your baby comes right on time and everything goes fairly smoothly but you are just so damn tired that you no longer want to go?) that I just would not count on being able to do this. Your friend will understand - I had friends miss my wedding for this exact same reason, and I'm sorry they weren't there but man, after having my own kids, I totally get it and I don't blame them at all."
beyondthebump,3dgnug,manyvests,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:34:48 2015 UTC,"Exactly-these are all of the things I've been thinking about. Just because my first was easy doesn't mean this one will be. Each pregnancy and baby are different and there are no absolutes. Just because everything is going smoothly doesn't mean it will continue to do so. I was actually thinking that if I went by myself, sleep would be a major bonus-a hotel room all to myself would be kind of amazing. I vaguely remember the 3-4 week marker being my breastfeeding/sleep breaking point last time. I just felt like a sleepless cow-I couldn't leave the apt or baby for more than an hour. They call it the 4th trimester for a reason!"
beyondthebump,3dgnug,twistyabbazabba,2,Fri Jul 17 00:00:01 2015 UTC,"I can only tell you what I would do and that's HELLS NO. At 3-4 weeks PP I was still bleeding heavily, had stitches that made sitting uncomfortable, and was just generally exhausted. In addition, your milk supply is just getting established so being away from baby that much would likely seriously harm it. Finally, I would not feel comfortable taking a small baby on a plane and exposing him/her to all those germs.   Nope, I would send a nice gift and pay them a visit in the spring."

The way we found out that I was pregnant in the first place was because I was rushed to the ER for a bleeding ulcer. Imagine being told you are pregnant after passing out in the ER bathroom while trying to provide them with a urine sample! Luckily, the 5 day ICU/hospital stay gave me enough time to digest the news, haha.   My OB had mentioned a topical ibuprofen before for bad cramps before I was pregnant, and had told me I might be able to order online, but obviously with a breastfeeding little one, I am hesitant to do so as I don't know how safe that would be. Orally, I don't want to take anything that would make me ""fuzzy"" as I do fast-paced, detail-oriented work and also most importantly, I don't want to put my son at risk.   I'm going to call my PCP tomorrow to get his advice, as he is more accessible than my OB, who is only in the office a few times a month. I know I'm asking for a miracle fix, but it's worth a shot.

beyondthebump,3dfrb5,Espelyn,5,Wed Jul 15 22:39:10 2015 UTC,"Are you doing anything other than heat and meds? Do you still have a clog? It feels so much better once you get rid of the clog and get the milk out.   Somethings that worked for me to clear clogs:  *Pump while squeezing and pushing above the clog, pushing towards the nipple.  I was exclusive pumper though. For nursing, nurse on the clogged side first with baby's chin pointed towards the clog. You can also try feeding while dangling the boob into the baby's mouth by laying baby on the ground and crouching over them.   *In the hottest shower you can stand, use the heel of your hand and start pushing down and towards the nipple, starting from behind the clog. You want to use the milk pressure to force it out. It may hurt but when it clears it's so much better. Keep pushing then pick up your hand, move a little further down towards the nipple and repeat. Push like you want to pop your boob, it requires force.   *Look at the tip of your nipple. Look for any white dots. Scrape them with your nail as this can be the tip of the plug. Often the milk will come shooting out if you had one (they are called nipple pore plugs or blebs). I always had one when mine started clogging. If you have nipples of steel you can also squeeze around the white dot like you would pop a pimple.   *Have your SO suck it out. I know, sounds weird, but adults can suck harder and listen to directions. Make sure the latch is correct and chin pointed at clog   *vibrate the clog (didn't work for me but did for others). You can use an electronic toothbrush or you know, whatever you have that vibrates.  Edit formatting"

I ended up getting a prescription for percocet so I could function, and had to (and still have to) exclusively pump from that side, as we still haven't fixed her latch, despite multiple LC's taking a look.   Not sure if nipple damage is your issue, but I'd definitely call your doctor and see about better pain meds, and maybe a different antibiotic.

beyondthebump,3dcrhl,aerrin,3,Wed Jul 15 12:00:00 2015 UTC,Also look up paced feeding for breastfed babies. Kellymom has a good page on bottles for breastfed babies!  Apparently they often eat much faster from bottles and their tummies don't realize they're full quite that fast.
beyondthebump,3dcrhl,fernyfantastic,19,Wed Jul 15 13:11:30 2015 UTC,"It could just be that your baby is in the middle of the fantastic fun time that is the 4 month growth spurt/sleep regression. My little girl went from waking 1-2 times a night to 3-4 times for about 5 weeks. Nothing would settle her but boob, and she was properly hungry. She's 5.5 months now and is getting back to 1-2 wakings. And during those 5 weeks she gained almost a kilo, grew 5cms and learned to roll over.   It's awesome that your husband wants to help, but you may just need to wait it out. With all the development going on right now, your baby might just need the comfort that only you (and your boons!) can provide. Can your husband take him for a while in the morning to let you sleep in a bit instead?"

beyondthebump,3dcrhl,fernyfantastic,2,Wed Jul 15 13:55:31 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's what it is. At this age, a baby's sleep cycle halves so a baby who was getting 90 minutes at a time before now wakes up every 45 minutes."

beyondthebump,3dcrhl,garfbaby,6,Wed Jul 15 20:21:42 2015 UTC,"You may also want to look into paced bottle feeding techniques if you haven't already. They slow the delivery of milk so it's more like nursing. There are some good YouTube videos out there that show you how.  It may also take a few days (and long nights) for baby to get used to dad style vs mom style. There are still some times nursing feels like the only tool that works, but there are a lot of times when bouncing and patting and shushing work (as long as it's not mom doing it) work too.  Between taking longer to eat and some better calming techniques hopefully dad can get down a style that works.  And naps. If your baby takes naps and you can nap on those bad nights, it really helps. ;)"

beyondthebump,3dcrhl,appletoozler,3,Wed Jul 15 11:13:25 2015 UTC,"Sounds like your husband needs some middle of the night confidence.  I second the recommendation for watching Happiest Baby on the block and learning some soothing techniques.  Then he just needs to relax and keep trying until something works. He needs to be able to learn that he is just as much of a parent as you are, and that if he does something different, it's okay.  This was really hard for me, and for my husband at first as well.  It required me not standing over his shoulder and giving suggestions, not going in after 5 minutes (even if it killed me to hear baby crying), and to let them work it out.  I don't mean that your husband can't ask for tips, or if it gets excessive, can't come get you.  But let them make that choice.  Sleep in a different part of the house if you can while they work it out.   If your husband goes in there, knowing that he will fail, then baby picks up on that.  Once they get a rhythm, it's all gravy."

I've heard there's a bit of a regression around 8 months as well, so I'm not sure if this is it or something else.  Does baby take a paci?  It was a big help for us during the 4 month regression.  My first plan of attack would be for me or my husband (pedi recommended my husband first, so LO wouldn't smell me, but sometimes, husband wouldn't wake up) to go in to LO's room, give him the paci (oftentimes, it had moved to a location he couldn't reach in the crib, or he had rolled over on it), and rub his chest/head.  Oftentimes, he'd go back to sleep for at least another couple hours.  Sometimes, he wouldn't settle, and then I would nurse him.  After the sleep regression, LO got really good at finding the paci in his crib in the middle of the night and putting it in himself.  I'm finding now, with this sleep regression or whatever it is, he is not wanting anything to do with my husband, and I'm having to nurse him down every time (paci and chest rubs are out)!  After the 4 month regression, he went back to STTN or waking up once to eat.  The past couple of nights, he's back to wanting to eat 3x a night.  I'm trying to grin and bear it at this point in time - like some ppl have said, sometimes it's just more about that comfort for them.  Sorry I don't have a lot of advice, but I feel ya sister!  Looking forward to others' responses."
beyondthebump,3dcrhl,Daseinsend,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:11:03 2015 UTC,"I agree that researching the 4 months sleep regression is helpful. But also, your boobs aren't only food for your kiddo--they're also comfort, security and affection. A bottle just isn't the same thing, even if it has the same nutritional content. Is setting up a safe co-sleeping situation possible? Studies have shown that mothers who co-sleep sleep more even though their babies wake more often, because it's so easy to immediately soothe them. Co-sleeping need not be a permanent solution--it can be something you just do to get you through the regression."

I do not think it is a bad idea to get it checked out before his well checkup.  Honestly, I think it's best to address any issues at separate appointments than the checkups so that you can focus on his overall wellbeing during the checkup and not a specific concern that you want to address."
beyondthebump,3de6ik,IveCreatedAMuenster,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:03:09 2015 UTC,"Should I have pushed for an earlier appointment, then?  I just hate to think that we have to sit around for another two weeks when he could be getting in to see a physical therapist and starting therapy during that time.

beyondthebump,3de6ik,IveCreatedAMuenster,2,Wed Jul 15 16:15:38 2015 UTC,"I do think it's worth asking if they can see you earlier or let you know if there are any cancellations.  In my experience, waits for PT evaluations are usually the bottleneck and can take a long time once you get the referral, so if you can get it sooner, the better.  I'd explain this to the doctors office, maybe they can set up an evaluation without having to see him (long shot, but worth an ask)."
beyondthebump,3de6ik,tercerero,3,Wed Jul 15 17:03:00 2015 UTC,"I know my insurance sets it up to where ""well child"" checks are free and anything else requires a co-pay.  The doc's office always schedules the well child checks within a few days of the birthday (by date, not weeks), but other appointments can be made at any time.  It's annoying sometimes to have two appointments so close and not being able to count them as both well child.  Our office though does have two waiting rooms, one for sick children and one for the well child appointments."

There are 52 weeks in a year and 12 months in a year - if a month was only 4 weeks, there would be 13 months in the year.    Assuming you're on a regular vaccination schedule, doctor's offices are usually pretty particular about dates - we couldn't schedule anything a few days before there needed to be exactly 2 months (or whatever) between the vaccines for them to be fully effective. My son was born on the 8th and I recall he had his 2 month appt on the 11th and we weren't allowed to have the 4 month appt before the 11th because of the vaccines."

It just seemed weird to me since I have been counting every 4 weeks as a month in terms of his age. I'm a FTM so I've just never really encountered it before.   I did ask if it was about the vaccines because he hasn't gotten his first set due to hiccups with his insurance, so the spacing wouldn't have been an issue since his first shots will be with this office.

beyondthebump,3de6ik,skunka,3,Thu Jul 16 01:57:53 2015 UTC,Dr's will pretty much see you for the one main reason you made the appt then see you back for the next problem or visit. I know it sucks but thats how it usually works. I guess they would be with certain patients all day long if they treated them for everything at once. 😁
beyondthebump,3de6ik,skunka,3,Wed Jul 15 16:06:11 2015 UTC,This is because of vaccines.  You have to wait a certain amount of time after the 2mth vaccines to get the 4mth vaccines.

beyondthebump,3de6ik,KimberSliceAZDD,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:45:29 2015 UTC,"I know for adult physicals most insurances won't cover it until it's at least exactly one year after your previous one.

beyondthebump,3de6ik,BlueberryFaerie,2,Wed Jul 15 18:36:37 2015 UTC,"I live in Canada so my doctor might be different (because how she bills). But she would definitely do both things at once. I think she realizes how difficult it can be to get out of the house at a scheduled time. For our 1 month appointment she did my 6 week follow up at the same time (it was for me, and not baby so maybe that's a factor).  Edit: just read the comments about vaccines. That makes sense."

beyondthebump,3de6ik,mnh1,3,Wed Jul 15 18:07:54 2015 UTC,That's a terrible then. I guess they can't charge for multiple appointments on the same day and so if they force you to come in twice they get paid another time. :(
beyondthebump,3de6ik,sweetpea07,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:17:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I'm thinking maybe if we were closer to his 4 month mark, they may have let me just do one appt, but since that's nearly a month from now we need to get in sooner.

At 2 months, she started sleeping through the night, but only took two very, very short (20-30 minutes) naps during the day.   It seems to be a common agreement that it's a growth spurt sleep regression. She eventually got back into the good napping habits. But as of 4 months, she started waking up every few hours. So yes, their habits will eventually balance out better, but expect that every few months, they will get out of whack again.   Personally, I would say this is normal, but maybe someone else has a different answer."

Part of what seemed to help, we found pacifiers he liked, and I basically forced him down for naps.

You can do whatever you need to with that time, whether it is to sleep, clean, have a hot bath or whatever.   I have family and friends do this because it seems like as long as LO is being held by someone they are generally content. If you are breast feeding then give them that and then hand them off to the person and do what you need to do.   A good option is a student, if you are uncomfortable with a high school student you could try an early childhood education student or nursing student... someone who needs money and has an interest in caring for people/children.   Its just an idea, but sanity is valuable."

It lasted for about five weeks and I cried so much thinking that motherhood was going to be terrible forever. It's a huge cognitive leap plus sleep pattern changes that makes life hell.   It will end! And things will get better! It might take a while, but you will get your happy baby back. For now, do whatever works to get baby to sleep. We did a lot of walking around the mall because my LO would only nap if she was being worn or in the stroller and in constant motion.   Check out the Wonder Weeks (there's a book and an app). My daughter is nine months now and the Wonder Weeks has always been very close in predicting when she's going to be starting a fussy stage. The one that your LO is in right now was by far the worst one we've had yet, but when it's over, you'll feel like you can handle anything! Good luck!!"
beyondthebump,3dduqo,soon2bdad,7,Wed Jul 15 14:28:55 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely take a food holiday and come back fresh in a couple weeks.  At his age, formula should be his primary nutrition anyway.  Some kids just take longer to get the hang of eating and find a lot of comfort on the bottle.    Don't stress over it, and don't try creating situations where he's already stressed (like making him extra hungry, for example)."
beyondthebump,3dduqo,tercerero,5,Wed Jul 15 14:41:11 2015 UTC,"Does he show an interest in what you're eating or try to grab the spoon out of your hand? You could try looking into baby led weaning. That's what I do with my 10 month old twins. They have no interest in puréed food, but love feeding themselves. There's tons of info out there and you can check out /r/babyledweaning. You basically just give them finger shaped pieces of whatever you're eating. It's messy, but it's fun seeing them eat big people food."
beyondthebump,3dduqo,clairrific,4,Wed Jul 15 14:36:05 2015 UTC,"My kids HATED being spoonfed. Like capital H hated it. We gave them age appropriate finger foods and let them feed themselves instead. The pediatrician gave us an OK on it too since she said food is practice for babies until they are one. Before that, their main source of calories and nutrition is still breast milk or formula. It can be messy but the kids love the independence."
beyondthebump,3dduqo,snarklepop,2,Wed Jul 15 16:05:08 2015 UTC,"Sounds like my kid.  He HATES the spoon, it has to be finger foods or purée in a self-feeder or something else he can bite or do himself.  He mostly has shredded up meat and fish, sticks of cucumber, cooked veggies and noodles, cubes of cheese or avocado.  Also, Os (we crack them in half because he shoves them in a handful at a time).  It takes lots of coaxing to get him to try something new (unless it's my lunch).  I also agree with trying the homemade stuff if you're stuck on purees.  Have you tasted the jar stuff?  Sometimes it's really good and sometimes it's like ""bleh, no wonder he doesn't want it""."
beyondthebump,3dduqo,patientish,2,Wed Jul 15 18:23:55 2015 UTC,Maybe try giving him food when he's not super hungry. At this point he satisfies his hunger with milk so if he's really really hungry he's going to be upset if he's not getting a bottle. Try an hour after he's drank a bottle so he'll be just a little hungry. And don't worry! Food before one is just for fun.
beyondthebump,3dduqo,sweetsleepescapesme,4,Thu Jul 16 01:21:14 2015 UTC,"Have you tried cutting up soft foods (flaked chicken, steamed potato chunks, cottage cheese, fruit, etc) and putting them in front of him? Some babies prefer self feeding more than being spoon fed. Also it might be better if he's not hungry when being offered solids. Mine was always too annoyed and distracted to eat solids when she was hungry so she'd get her milk first and then an hour or two later we'd offer a solid meal or snack. Also mine was never a fan of commercial baby food (at least not the savory meals but she ate fruit purees from jars) so we had to make our own meals from scratch and froze many of the ingredients in small portions. Have you tried giving him homemade foods, even if it's from your own meals?"

She's gonna go through periods even after she picks up interest where she's not interested again.  It takes time.    Just keep offering tastes here and there and she'll come around.

We do baby led weaning (finger foods) and ours is almost 7 months. Some days she's in to food, some days not. She prefers to feed herself though so she can control it. If she doesn't want it, we just try again the next day. Food is just for learning flavors and textures at this point.   For finger foods she likes sweet potato or carrot ""fries"". Just cut in fry shape and bake or steam until soft enough to mush with your fingers but firm enough to hold. No salt though (salt is too much for their kidneys at this age).   She also likes toast strips with things spread on top. You can do avocado, tomato paste, mashed banana, mashed baked apple, thin spread peanut butter etc. She just gums away on the toast and licks the topping off."

The dogs will play bite or wrestle with each other and do a pretty decent job at avoiding LO if she's nearby.  If the dogs get too rough, they know ""chill out"" as a command to stop. If we're playing fetch, they'll avoid LO or if I'm afraid LO's going to get hurt, I use the ""wait"" command. If LO does get knocked down and cries, I use ""go lie down"" and they don't move from their safe spots until I give a release command.  Teaching leave it and basic stop and go type of commands have been a lifesaver. Short 5 minute training sessions or before the dog's meals everyday is what I've done to train my dogs.

beyondthebump,3dcfkt,dalikin,3,Wed Jul 15 19:30:13 2015 UTC,"Some kids are born with teeth (mine, for example lol) while others do just teethe really early. However, usually the first teeth that come through are the two front ones at the bottom.   Did he cry when you touched the white part on his gum? Was it hard like a tooth or it just wouldn't come off his gum? The reason why I ask is that a tooth coming in first at the back would be very unusual, and oral thrush (which is extremely common) in babies starts with white spots on the gums, cheeks, and roof of the mouth. Or like the other posters have said, it could be an Epstein pearl."
beyondthebump,3dcfkt,dalikin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:47:27 2015 UTC,"It was as hard as a tooth, both the part that's sticking through and I can feel the whole tooth under the gum. At first I was worried about thrush but no way, that's a tooth.   Also...oooooh my god, your baby was born with teeth?! I hear that's super rare! Was it really unnerving?"
beyondthebump,3dcfkt,Littlepumpkinmama,2,Wed Jul 15 05:29:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah haha she was born with her two bottom centre teeth. I was a bit freaked out because initially I was worried she was some kind of mutant, but she is totally normal! She still only has those two teeth though even though she is 8 months old! I want her to get more! She was winning at teeth and now she is falling behind all the other babies her age! Lol :D"

I felt the tooth under the surface of his gums, so I'm fairly sure that's what it is. I know in rare cases, babies are born with teeth, so I figure it's not impossible that he be born with them super close to the gum."

beyondthebump,3dawh1,goldenw,30,Thu Jul 16 17:30:20 2015 UTC,"This is 100% normal. You just have to make it through.  Hold your baby as much as you can. Remember that just a few weeks ago he was snuggled in your belly - of course he wants to be snuggled on you when he sleeps.  Honestly, for me, accepting that my baby wanted to touch me 24/7 helped me reason through it.  Learn to pee holding the baby, eat holding the baby and do lots of other things holding the baby (mine wasn't into his sling or carrier). And remember, he's a baby.  He's not trying to cause you problems.  Good luck, it really does get a lot easier."
beyondthebump,3dawh1,showing_not_glowing,5,Tue Jul 14 23:53:38 2015 UTC,This!
beyondthebump,3dawh1,danatastic,17,Wed Jul 15 00:12:20 2015 UTC,"New mom over here, 3 and 1/2 weeks PP, and it's like you wrote about my baby. Sometimes we get the magical, 3 hours sleep, but usually we're less than 2 hours in between every feeding, and he almost always needs to be held to stay asleep. 85% of the time, he needs a nipple in his mouth too.   Is it possible that you're just growing through a growth spurt right now? Most babies have one around 2 to 3 weeks. About a week ago, we had just that, and it was 2-3 days where he was constantly fussy, constantly wanting to eat, and I could never put him down. It was a nightmare, but it got better after a few days. If you suspect a growth spurt, I'd recommend getting some good snacks, a giant jug of water, and just preparing for a long netflix watching/breastfeeding marathon. Don't even try to get anything else done, just relax, breastfeed like crazy, and try to enjoy the time with your baby.   Since the growth spurt, 3 other things that have helped tremendously for me;  1. Putting baby in a sling, and just accepting that I'm probably going to have to hold him for the next 24 hours while I do the laundry/go to the store/watch a movie/ etc. I also had to accept the fact that everyone I encounter, stranger or otherwise, is probably going to see my giant, dark, postpartum nipple at some point, because this baby is going to make me whip them out all day, everyday.  2. Co-sleeping. I swore I wouldn't do this before he was born, but then reality crept in and I realized that I wasn't going to survive unless I learned how sleep while nursing. I figured out how to nurse in a side lying nursing and that has improved my sleep and mood tenfold. Plus, it is just genuinely cute to wake up to his face.  3. A good swing. Swaddling him and laying him a swing has been an awesome new discovery this week. Even awake, he's calm in the swing, and it has the added bonus of occasionally lulling him into a nap. It's given me the freedom to do an hour of yoga everyday so far this week, and that's really helped with my mood.   Another note, is there anyone you can get to just come over and take him off your hands for awhile? Sometimes just having another person around to share in the frustration can be really reassuring.   Best of luck to you these next few weeks!"
beyondthebump,3dawh1,smembot,5,Tue Jul 14 21:53:47 2015 UTC,"I just have to second all of this advice.  Co-sleeping, a good wrap, and a baby swing are the only things that kept me sane during the newborn phase."

My LO is gassy but I bicycle his legs to help with the gas and that's enough for him now. A friend of mine swears by the gripe water though! She says it extended his sleep so much and made him much happier. Although at 3 weeks, that's a pretty normal sleep pattern, their stomachs are just so tiny!"

beyondthebump,3dawh1,mauut,0,Wed Jul 15 03:12:48 2015 UTC,One other thing that helped us.. Was when I stopped consuming cows milk products - with colic its good to try and eliminate cows milk and it's products from your diet. This takes 2 weeks before you know for sure if it's helped or not.. But worth a try if your baby is gassy like mine

beyondthebump,3dawh1,madalitchy,7,Tue Jul 14 21:41:53 2015 UTC,"This all sounds completely normal, newborns are just needy and unpredictable. They need lots of cuddles and are moody feeders, especially the first 12 weeks (called by some ""fourth trimester"").   Sorry to hear you went through the NICU experience, that can be taxing on its own (my son was in NICU for 10 days too, that was rough).   Have you tried/considered swaddling? Newborns have a moro (sp?) reflex that makes them flail, wake themselves up, and often fussy. A tight swaddle would solve many of the flailing issues with my son. That said, fresh babies just want lots of cuddles, my son spent many many naps just in my arms, or on my chest. They outgrow that phase but I know it's rough on the parents (especially mom) while it's going on.   Hang in there, and feel free to ask/PM me if you have more questions about swaddling."
beyondthebump,3dawh1,whittylocks,5,Tue Jul 14 23:12:18 2015 UTC,"Swaddling is the best. Even if the baby doesn't seem to like it (our son fought it like crazy at first), they almost always do after they grow used to it, and now swaddling our son is like an instant 'you're sleepy' switch in his brain."

It's hard.  Really hard at first and then it slowly gets better.  My son was a screaming non-sleeping fart machine for the first month of his life maybe month and a half but now at three months he's smiley, giggly and the gas is virtually gone or at least he knows how to deal with it better.  He's sleeping much better but now my lack of sleep stems from constantly checking on him and being unable to fall asleep after feeding him at night.  Ask your pedi about probiotics.  There's a lot of new info about how they can help with colic &amp; gas do you to gut bacteria. I know it's hard right now but you will get to a point where he will go a little longer between feedings and sleep a while so you can get things done but for now just take care of yourself and rest when you can I won't say sleep because sometimes it was really hard for me to sleep when he was sleeping but just try to take it easy.  And if you have any troops call them in so they can watch the baby while you sleep if you can turn your brain off.    I remember telling my husband one day that I regretted having a baby and now his smiles melt my heart and I feel so undeserving of his love when I walk in the room every day and he smiles when he sees me you'll get there and you'll feel the same way I promise."

I can get some stuff done and if he stays awake, he is at least content. I don't like the baby bjorn or snuggli carriers, but love my ring sling. Fairly easy to learn how to use.   My little guy is so gassy too. Doesn't seem to bother him (he grunts a ton, but stops screaming when he is picked up). Keeping track of what you eat is a huge burden and I don't think it is necessary personally.   Try nursing lots when he is fussy. My guy pops on and off the nipple when hes fussy and it gets old fast. What works for him is loud ""shhhhhh"" noises in his ear, and jiggling his bum while he tries to nurse. Usually the jiggling will get him to stay latched and not pop off. I love the laid back nursing position for fussy times cuz it is comfy for me and helps me stay calm."

beyondthebump,3dawh1,prolificsalo,2,Wed Jul 15 02:06:19 2015 UTC,"Hey hon, Besides the NICU stay this sounds really familiar. First, take a deep breath. Second, realize that yes it's normal. Third, let's see what might help. My advice is only based only own experience and you might be doing some or all of this already but here is what helped us: 1. For the gas- those farts man, they are crazy. At your next appointment with the pediatrician tell him or her about that. They might recommend a probiotic. Mine did a wait-and-see because my daughter had awful gas and had trouble burping so he said if it kept on like it was he had a probiotic to recommend. Fortunately it got better after maybe 6-8 weeks. For her we really had to BURP her. You may have seen a nurse or LC burp babies at the hospital. They sat my daughter up and leaned her over their hand, hand on her tummy. Then it looked like they beat the crap out of her back but really it was just firm, swift pats/thumps to the back to work out the air. Also my daughter had mucus she swallowed so we had to really work those burps up and out. We did this at home and it helped. Also laying her down across husband's leg, belly firm on his thigh or calf if his legs were crossed, and firm pats. I also found that holding her firmly to my shoulder, stomach to my upper arm and chest, while walking upstairs with a little bounce to my step would help the gas move up. Weird, I k ow, but I, like you, needed sleep and a break and I tried everything. 2. Happiest baby on the block and other sleep and soothing books/videos are great and helpful but I have had to cherry pick what works. Don't get hung up on any one thing being the best. For us, she only slept while laying in the detachable seat of the baby swing, while we bounced it with one foot. It was the graco duet connect. It got better around 6 weeks and barring some bumps since then (she is 9 months now) she now sleeps for at least a forty five minute stretch whenever she is put down but usually waaaaay longer. And she slept through the night and sometimes still does. You will sleep. Soon. I promise. And I'm sorry I don't have better things to say about that! 2b. Swaddle! Keep the arms and legs from flailing. Those tiny babies and that Moro reflex will get you every time. I used the summer infant swaddle me Velcro thingies and oh my god life savers. I swear.  3. Eating and nursing. Does your hospital have a lactation help line? Call them. Do it. If they don't, Google. Call la leche. Call a different hospital. Call any LC. See what they think. Maybe a nipple shield? Maybe something. Else? I used a nipple shield for about a month and had to basically present the boob with a friggin engraved invitation. Now she eats like its her job.  Listen. It's so hard. It might get harder. But coming from someone who was where you are and can remember it in vivid horrible technicolor... You are doing a great job. You're going to be fine. I hope i have helped you even a fraction of the amount that other moms helped me during those early days.  Good luck mama."
beyondthebump,3dawh1,stone_soop,2,Wed Jul 15 02:48:56 2015 UTC,"Try to see if there's a correlation to what you're eating to days he's fussy. Also, definitely try to swaddle him.

beyondthebump,3dawh1,AK2K12,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:12:40 2015 UTC,"Sounds like us. See my history for my similar post. Now baby is 6 weeks. Still gassy, sleeping mostly in 2 hr chunks with a 3-5 hr chunk once or twice a night. Baby is always gassy but more so when I eat dairy, tofu, cabbage, broccoli, spicy foods.   We've figured out how to best help her with gas. I burp her before feeding and interrupt her a few times while feeding to burp her. I burp her over my shoulder and pat firmly from her bottom to top repeatedly. Then I burp her sitting on my knee leaning her forward with her chest/neck leaning on my hand and my other hand patting her. I do this after feeding too. Between feeds we prop her somewhat upright on her back and massage her stomach/intestines very gently. Sometimes sitting her upright and putting her in the fetal position helps (aka Ergo with infant insert.) We also will give her gas drops if nothing else is working. Sometimes she will work it out when on her back on the changing table.  Sleeping: she's currently passed out on my in the baby ktan carrier im wearing. She sleeps during the day on me, in a slightly inclined baby seat thing, and sometimes in our bed. At night for the first month she mostly slept on my or my husband's chest. We now cosleep with her on the mattress next to me more often. Sometimes she sleeps on her back and sometimes her stomach. We tried the swing, which many friends found successful, but she doesn't like. Swaddling sometimes works, and when it does, she sleeps longer and deeper.  We introduced a pacifier to her at 4 weeks and that's been helpful. My nipples are happier, and it's easier to get her to sleep while not on the boob.  Good luck! It will get better."

beyondthebump,3dawh1,MamaBeeLu,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:13:18 2015 UTC,"First 6 weeks suck sooo bad. Ironically, when they're fresh out the womb they're very agreeable, then it all goes to shit for almost 2 months.   First off, there's always a burp after a feed. If you don't get one right away, keep trying. Change your angle, don't be afraid to pat firmly with purpose.   Secondly, if he flails when he's sleeping or when you put him down, that's just his startle reflex. That shit it hard wired and he can't help it even though he's not falling, etc. Swaddle him very snugly and securely, arms at his side.   Third, for gas, watch your diet (visit kellymom.com for info about diet when breastfeeding. It's unlikely that something your eating is definitely making your kid gassy, it's more likely that he's swallowing air that then gets digested. You can also bicycle his legs, bend his body at the waist with his legs up, and try things like that to work out his poots. If he seems to have pain from gas you can gently apply pressure to his belly with a snug swaddle or by changing the way you hold him.   You may also want to try baby wearing. Frees your hands without having to go through the song and dance of him startling when you set him down."

If possible call family  over,  like your sister, but so she can hold the baby while you shower and eat and maybe take a nap.  Also, get infant gas drops ASAP. I have 2 bottles and my boy did what you described. He wanted to sleep but the gas wouldn't let him. He got the drops after feeds and definitely before bed and voila. Suddenly we were getting way more sleep!   Hang in there. You're doing great!"

I was about to lose it when my BFF said well just try swaddling one more time? 5 weeks old ( again why didn't I try sooner !) until 4 months she was swaddled for every nap and bedtime. I used the Velcro swaddlemes . Also we had a swing lover. She didn't like it for the first three ish weeks but it was either me or swaddled in  swing for naps.
beyondthebump,3dawh1,Jodie182,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:26:44 2015 UTC,Something else you may consider if hes so gassy from solely breastmilk- he may be sucking in air when he nurses and that could be because of a lip or tongue tie. We had two diff people tell us he was fine and he had a grade 3 lip tie so he couldnt flare his upper lip correctly so he sucked in too much air when feeding. Also DEFINITELY try swaddling if he is flailing.   We had a terrible terrible few days where he didnt sleep at all right around that stretch. Get the wonder weeks app- its awesome!

When my kids started crawling they also had a hard time napping and sometimes I ended up having to drive them around so they would sleep.   Another more expensive option is to buy a pack and play or travel crib. The mesh sides make it harder for baby to grab onto and pull themselves up.

Now that he is teething doesn't work as well but when not teething this is how we get him to stop going crazy in his crib practicing his skills."

If I were to take him out and bring him to the living room, he'd get into everything and go exploring. He is quite an independent little guy, and he hasn't fallen asleep in my arms in about 6 months (though I've tried many times!). If he's not in his crib, he absolutely refuses to sleep. He used to do so so very well in his crib. He's play for about 6-7 minutes and then fall asleep. These days, I think he's just wanted to get into everything rather than nap."

Since we started putting the jammies on in the bathroom where it's still warm he doesn't cry anymore. Also if this is new maybe he's just going through a leap or growth spurt and is just a little more cranky than usual and it might pass.

Then about 4oz when we go to bed around 10. Most of the time she'll then sleep bottle-free till about 4 or 5am.   Our routine starting at 5 is bottle > play (sometimes nap) > bottle/yogurt/mush-of-the-day > bath > pjs > book > bottle > crib.  Long story short - maybe he's calorie loading/hungry and its kicking in during the activity of the bath? Will he eat before and after the bedtime routine? Maybe then he'll settle easier?

My girl is 9 weeks old, and we are currently transitioning to exclusively formula feeding. We've been doing a combination since she was born.  For us, my supply is not the issue. She has a bad latch and cannot transfer enough milk. I've also seen a couple of lactation consultants, and their response was, ""Everything looks fine,"" and yet she still wasn't gaining weight.   I went to pumping and bottle feeding breastmilk plus one formula bottle a day and she's been gaining fine ever since, but now we're discovering food sensitivities. Dairy, citrus fruits, and who knows what else upset her stomach and send her into hours-long screaming  fits. It's impossible to know what will bother her until I eat it and make her hurt.  We are switching to all formula because we've decided it's just too much. Pumping around the clock is hard enough. Having to eat around her sensitivities was sort of the last straw.  Like you said, I know breastmilk has many benefits above and beyond formula, but I think I've given her a good start and I have to do what's right for me and my mental health, too. Her pediatrician told me, ""She can still go to Harvard or wherever she wants if you give her formula."" I of course feel some guilt, but I'm working through it."

We combination fed till 15 months when she refused boob. There were times when I felt useless breastfeeding, but she always liked the boob, like a cuddle and some food, then I'd give her bottle. I found it the best of both worlds.  The breastfeeding was very handy when teeth were coming in; was such a comfort for her.  This worked for us.

I was sad, and it was disheartening, but despite some pang here and there we are all happier. Also she still enjoys nursing here and there. Additionally I read a lot about the supposed benefits before she was born (link  link2) and concluded we don't really know a whole lot about it and there is certainly very little proof of real benefits outside of the iga antibody which shows a reduction in incidences of diarrhea. Give up the guilt, you're going to have a lot more ahead and you don't want to torture yourself about how your well fed baby is actually fed."
beyondthebump,3dd7r8,susanmack,0,Wed Jul 15 13:52:09 2015 UTC,"My LO is 8 weeks tomorrow, and I had a similar labour and delivery to you, with complications during the c-section leading to not holding/feeding my LO until ~2hours post birth. My milk came in at 6 days pp.  From Day 2 I had to supplement with formula because he was dehydrated and becoming jaundiced. Thankfully I was able to transition to exclusive breast feeding from about 10 days (including 1-2 EBF per day), however I've had problems with my supply on and off, particularly in the afternoon/evening.  What I've found to be useful in increasing my supply is * keeping myself well hydrated (drinking far more water than I normally would) * pumping first thing in the morning when my supply seems to be best. I also notice that my supply seems to improve after I've slept (even if it's just 1-2 hours while LO naps) * lactation cookies/biscuits. there are heaps of recipes online but the key ingredients in these recipes that allegedly increase milk supply are brewer's yeast, flaxseed and oats. Thankfully my partner is into brewing craft beer so we had plenty of the yeast on hand! Not sure what the science is behind these working, but I certainly noticed a drop in my supply when I wasn't eating a few of these biscuits a day.  All of this is probably only helpful if you decide to continue combination feeding. That is a personal decision for you, the benefits of breastfeeding are well documented, but so are the benefits of looking after your own mental and physical health.  Personally, I like being able to breastfeed as a first option, but then also have bottle feeds available if I need to go out (or if I feel like a glass of wine now and again!)"

beyondthebump,3ddn95,tercerero,3,Wed Jul 15 13:28:17 2015 UTC,"Right now, if I were experiencing symptoms of depression or anxiety, I'd find a psychiatrist to see.

But your only choices aren't necessarily meds or no treatment. With counseling, you may find that meds are not necessary at all, or can be taken at lower doses, or just for a short time. Or if you start a combination approach, you may at least find out that meds are effective and counseling is not, and be given confidence that meds only really are your best option, which makes it truly worth it to continue/not continue breastfeeding as you see fit.  If it makes you feel any better, given my twins' reflux, I'd probably choose to go on zoloft if I needed meds and keep breastfeeding. I'd deem that better for them than making their reflux worse with formula.

This doesn't of course mean that you necessarily need medication, but it does means seeking help and perhaps you could try some form of therapy. Another reason I decided to breastfeed whilst on medication is that there's some fairly new research that shows that mothers who have to stop breastfeeding before they're ready are at a higher risk of depression. For me, the evidence shows concrete risks to my baby if I'm depressed outweighs the fact that there isn't the evidence to  Rove that Zoloft is 100% safe."

beyondthebump,3dbcyp,elves86,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:06:58 2015 UTC,I will look into those. Thanks! Even if I find somewhere to pump at work it might still help if I ever need to pump in public.
beyondthebump,3dbcyp,jhonotan1,7,Tue Jul 14 23:57:29 2015 UTC,I too worked at a small company. I used two options. Option #1. My boss (male) offered to let me use his office. It worked fine but it was sort of embarrassing to kick him out every three hours. Option #2. Pump in the car with a nursing cover. From the outside it just looks like you are sitting in your car. I got so used to pumping in my car that I even started doing it while driving.

beyondthebump,3dbcyp,silentcecilia,3,Wed Jul 15 01:47:45 2015 UTC,"I'm with everyone on using a nursing cover in your car.  Not sure if you have one, but they make bras that hold the flanges in place while you pump. They're a little spendy for me, so I just took a worn out sports bra, cut some holes, and sewed around them so they wouldn't fray. Easy peasy!! Then you have both hands free."
beyondthebump,3dbcyp,snarklepop,2,Wed Jul 15 06:58:44 2015 UTC,"Office? Storage closet? Meeting room?  Hand pumps do work. I would say they are less efficient (time wise). I absentmindedly pump one breast at a time while browsing the internet watching tv. I probably wouldn't do this at work, but I do at home."
beyondthebump,3dbcyp,andthischeese,2,Wed Jul 15 02:44:11 2015 UTC,What about using a nursing cover to pump in your car?
beyondthebump,3dbcyp,madalitchy,2,Wed Jul 15 03:45:46 2015 UTC,"Since you work in an office building, you could ask some of the women on your floor if they have a space you could use. Maybe they have enough staff at another company on your floor to have a designated pumping space you could make use of?  Or maybe there is a single occupancy bathroom somewhere in the building?"
beyondthebump,3dbcyp,madalitchy,2,Wed Jul 15 04:52:12 2015 UTC,"The most important thing is that you feel comfortable, or getting let down will be increasingly hard. Personally, I would probably prefer to sit in my car, listen to music, and put something in the windows. (Maybe a sun shade on the front and throw a towel over the drivers side window?)."
beyondthebump,3dbcyp,PriceZombie,2,Wed Jul 15 05:03:19 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you already considered this, but using a nursing cover would be a good way to get some makeshift privacy in your car. It's not ideal, but a decent stop gap solution until you're able to hopefully find something else in the building. Significantly decreasing the frequency of pumping is likely to adversely affect your supply sometimes pretty quickly (especially this soon, most supplies aren't ""established"" in the sense of variation proof until 12-20 weeks)"
beyondthebump,3dbcyp,crystal1107,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:32:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks, yeah I didn't want to risk losing what I've already established. Luckily this morning with the advice of others on here I did use a nursing cover and just pumped in my car. I think it will work for now. I think I'm just new to this whole thing and I'm a pretty modest person so it's all the more intimidating for me."
beyondthebump,3dbcyp,knittybynature,2,Wed Jul 15 15:02:39 2015 UTC,"Pumping at work is challenging even without worrying about having your space/privacy. Another thought - maybe you can get those sun shades to put on the windows closest to you to get some extra privacy? Like these - I used them to keep the sun out of my sun hating baby's eyes :) I pumped at work for 12 months so I feel for you, hang in there and feel free to PM me if you want to vent or have any questions I may be able to help with."

beyondthebump,3dbyi1,savsavsav,3,Wed Jul 15 02:08:06 2015 UTC,"I found for me my sex drive was very limited post baby but after starting to have sex my libido improved. You obviously have some issues in regards to the trauma of the birth and the months pp which more than likely is contributing to this, possibly some form of PTSD. The trauma of the section, plus reopening of the wound, plus the concern over your daughters safety all can cause PTSD. Are you able to go and talk with a professional? I had a c-section and my incision opened up slightly and it would make me hesitate about having sex because I would worry about the sex causing it to open. The stress and worry of that made sex very unenjoyable for the first little while. Also if you don't feel comfortable about your own body you're not going to want to to be intimate.  Maybe try and start without the sex, just cuddle on the couch or in bed. Build that intimacy back up slowly, it's hard when you don't feel like it but making time is very important. Maybe a couple of hours on the weekend when you can get your child looked after and you both go and do something together, a walk, movies, picnic etc. A friend used to have 'date' night with her husband to try after the children were born to make sure their relationship didn't suffer too much. All your time and energy is going into looking after yourself and your daughter, his is in work and none of your energy is going towards each other. Small steps are the way to go, and definitely have a couple of sessions with a professional.  Good luck!"
beyondthebump,3dbyi1,ladynotme,2,Wed Jul 15 03:13:21 2015 UTC,"I think I am going to try to talk to a counselor or therapist through my insurance. Your idea of taking is slowly makes sense. Right now when we hang out at night, we are always sitting on separate couches. We talk nonstop and are always communicating when we are together, but we don't sit right next to each other like we did before all this. Maybe I can get a small tv for the bedroom or something, and we can start watching a movie in there at night occasionally, and it will nurture that closeness from snuggling together, without making me anxious about expectations (that aren't even there, he is the most patient man ever"""
beyondthebump,3dbyi1,LilaFaith,2,Wed Jul 15 03:26:07 2015 UTC,"Oh, wow, you poor thing! That's literally not what I expected when I opened this. I figured it would be and open and shut case of ""foreplay and lube"". I agree that you went through some serious trauma! Financial and housing problems, emergency c section, nicu stay, infected incision... I would be surprised if you were in the mood. First off, how are you physically? After 7 months of an infection, your doctor might not even think sex is on the table. You might want some light counseling to help cope with all the terrible things that happened. I'm really sorry all that happened to you."
beyondthebump,3dbyi1,The_Bravinator,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:24:45 2015 UTC,"Physically I am just fine. I didn't get a period for 10 months, and I've only had one and a half since then, but doctor says it's all fine. We tested thyroid and all that, since I was gaining so much weight, but nothing showed up. I did get one depo shot a couple months after the baby was born, so that might be affecting me too, though I never got any more after the first.   Anyways, I'm not depressed, I can't really point out what it is. I cannot stress how happy I am right now (my daughter is worth doing this a million times over), regardless of the no sex issue and the weight and all that, but it's still this lingering feeling all the time of something almost like dread. Strange... Anyways, thanks for replying! I think I'm going to look into maybe some counseling therapist type of thing."

beyondthebump,3dbyi1,PolkaDotBalloon,2,Wed Jul 15 06:49:23 2015 UTC,"I wish I had more constructive thoughts to offer here but I just wanted to chime in seconding the recommendation to seek out counseling.  Also, wowza, you had such an awful series of experiences! I had a few things similar to your situation: 40+ hours of labor followed by emergency section, didn't get to see baby for a couple days, 1 week NICU stay that kept threatening to go longer, incision site re-opened though healed up in a couple weeks. This is only a fraction of what you had happen and yet it left me pretty confused and angry. Like you, I don't think I was depressed. I just...I don't even know. I saw a counselor maybe 8 or 9 times and it really helped. See if you can find someone who specializes in new parenthood. The woman I saw actually turned out to be a social worker in a hospital NICU and was a lactation consultant. So she really got what was going on. Even just the one week in the NICU left me feeling pretty awful and I found I had a lot to talk through about that. (partly because we were not treated well there but that's another story...)    Oh, I also found that doing a bit of journaling helped. It was good prep work before and during counseling too.   In terms of low sex drive, that's something I've always struggled with. General advice: make sure your husband is on board with a policy that once you start making out there are no expectations as to how far it will go. Gotta ease back into stuff. There shouldn't be an expectation that both people will get off or that you'll go all the way. It might just be a back rub or it might go farther. One nice thing about this is that it reminds you how nice foreplay is and you get really good at it again.   Again, sorry this isn't super insightful or anything!Long time lurker and created an account just to respond to this because I know how guilty it can make you feel when you haven't had sex in a LONG time.   [edit to add- I found this counselor through a recommendation by a woman who teaches birthing classes. or the NICU might have a referral. or you can use this site https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/ ]"
beyondthebump,3dbyi1,carrots4love,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:12:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you for sharing that, hearing about other experiences helps a lot. It can be very lonely when you or your child has health issues that nobody you know can understand. I'm going to try to see if I can talk to a counselor or therapist through my insurance. I need to try getting intimate, and I'm going to. Maybe even doing something like buying a small tv to watch movies in bed together will help. Right now we sit on different couches or I sit at my sewing desk while hes on his computer when we are together. We talk a lot, always discussing things we are reading online or watching on tv, but that closeness from always sitting next to each other like before is gone. I know he doesn't expect anything at all, and honestly if we do have sex I expect him to want me to take it slowly. He understands all this, but the guilt is overwhelming because he doesn't expect it, but I want him to have it. If that makes sense? I never had a really huge sex drive before, though it was much more than this haha"
beyondthebump,3dbyi1,bonniejb,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:22:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's so hard because you've just had a baby and whenever people come by they're just like ""oh my gosh, congrats, isn't it great being a mom?"" and yes, of course it is, but you also have all this stuff going on like an open wound on your body and bad NICU memories and all that. I really really felt for you when you said it was like a nightmare with the incision being opened. I don't know the particulars of what treatment you received for that but we handled mine at home- my husband had to pack it with gauze twice daily and then pull the gauze out. Thank goodness it wasn't infected, it just re-opened.  I still think about that sometimes and it just freaks me out. And then the NICU stuff- we were in such fear that something would happen to generate another automatic stay there. And you just want to get out of that place but it's totally out of your control. When we left it felt like we were busting out of baby jail! Sorry, now I'm just going off and venting! Ahh!!  My husband and I are so tired out at the end of each day that it's super easy for us to just end up with him on his phone and me on the computer (we're doing it right now, haha!). So we'll accidentally go days without ever being close! I'm really trying to work on that- we both need to find ways to be more physical throughout the day. Maybe encourage your husband to do that too? Seems like non-sexual touching can inspire sex!    Sounds like your husband is being very sweet and supportive, not wanting to pressure you. So perhaps the main pressure here is your internal sense of ""we should be having sex!"" For myself, I try to set that aside and not think about how often most people have sex. I figure quality > quantity and even if it's just foreplay stuff if it makes us feel closer that's way better than someone having sex often but just doing it quickly and going through the motions."

beyondthebump,3dbyi1,timerout,2,Wed Jul 15 03:26:59 2015 UTC,"I felt very similar to you. Stressful pregnancy and birth, followed by additional health problems after. The accumulative effect on me was that I felt, not depressed, but mentally fragile. My GP at the time, when I mentioned I hadn't had sex yet a couple months post birth, told me to just do to get it over with and stop holding myself back. I did it, because I felt like you do now, that my relationship was suffering, intimacy was missing, that I was being unfair to my husband, blah blah, all stuff I told myself. My husband was fine with me taking my time. He told that, yes he missed it, but didn't need it. And we were still close and talked and stuff. I wish I had waited longer. It hurt and I felt gross after. It hurt the next half dozen times as well.  For the first year and a half we'd have sex maybe once or twice a month, then nothing for a few months. My son turns two in a few weeks and our sex life has really only picked up this past 4-5 months. I feel more like myself than I have since I was pregnant.  It's like, you've gone through a life changing experience and added a third person to your marriage. I feel like there is a lot of pressure for women to 'bounce back'. Get back your pre-baby body, go back to work, maintain friendships, basically stay the same person you were before. It took me a long time to work through the issues I had, accept myself and accept this new person in my life and my marriage.  My husband and I had to find new ways of being with each other when there was always someone else claiming our time and attention. And whilst I was still breastfeeding, someone else who had prior claim to my body. That's something I've never heard anyone else express, that while I loved the closeness between me and my baby, I also resented him for needing me. I stopped when he was about 20-21 months, and was able to reclaim myself, my body was my own again, and my sex drive came back with it.  Give yourself time. If you don't feel like having sex, don't. It's hard to find time for each other when you have a baby, but try. Even snuggling up together on the couch and watching a movie while she sleeps. Your husband sounds like an understanding guy,  talk to him about how your feeling, how you can keep the closeness in your relationship in other ways. It can feel like dating each other again.  I hope things start to perk up for you!"
