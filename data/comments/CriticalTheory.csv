CriticalTheory,3dzfzx,chorizotot,4,Mon Jul 20 19:54:50 2015 UTC,"My favorite quote on this subject is as follows:  ""The purpose of art is to impart the sensation of things as they are perceived and not as they are known. The technique of art is to make objects ‘unfamiliar,’ to make forms difficult to increase the difficulty and length of perception because the process of perception is an aesthetic end in itself and must be prolonged.""-Viktor Shklovsky  I'm not sure if it's truly something that can be universalized but it always spoke to me. Art is experiencing the uncanny and connecting with a radically alienated order of things outside of the conventional symbolic order."

CriticalTheory,3dzfzx,lacunahead,6,Mon Jul 20 22:49:41 2015 UTC,"I've found Kant's aesthetic theory to be extremely productive for looking at art, and aesthetic judgment in general. The gist of it is this: aesthetic objects have no purpose (insofar as they are aesthetic), but rather have a structure which implies purpose - purposiveness.   Think about the sorts of judgments we might make about objects when we're doing science (determinate cognitive judgments). We have some sort of concept we've defined (let's say ""dog,"" we're doing some pretty basic species classification) which involves criteria for determining whether or not any given object is a dog. We observe something which has four legs, a wagging tail, fur, etc., and we conclude that it's legitimate to subsume that thing under the concept of ""dog."" There's no room for creativity - we're basically just tabulating an object against a set of properties. Kant argues that the condition for the possibility of making such a judgment involves the positing of ordered regularities in nature, as though the world around us were designed according to a purpose. Otherwise, we would have no basis for e.g. assuming that we could even have an abstract concept to which the disparate phenomena of the world might adhere (let alone lots of those phenomena!).  Now think about an aesthetic judgment. When we come across an aesthetic object we also feel as though it has a sort of order or design, and so we might try to come up with a concept under which we can subsume that object. But we can't quite place the aesthetic object under a concept without losing something which seems essential to it - in other words, insofar as we are able to subsume an aesthetic object under a concept, we have ceased to treat it aesthetically. It's as though nature is overflowing with a surplus of design/orderliness, which delights our imagination by letting it run free, so to speak.  Whereas a determinate cognitive judgment eliminates possibility in judgment, or at least reduces it to a binary choice (yes, the object fits the concept vs. no, the object doesn't fit the concept), an aesthetic judgment opens the object to an infinite field of possibility with regards to the concepts our imagination posits to deal with its surplus orderliness. As such, aesthetic judgment has the structure of a determinate cognitive judgment insofar as it posits or implies an orderliness/purposiveness in nature, but differs insofar as it can never find the right way to fully express that orderliness/purposiveness. In a way, aesthetic judgment thus prepares us to engage with alterity, insofar as we have to deal with something which we can't fit within our conceptual scheme.  So art has no purpose, and that's why it's so beautiful!"
CriticalTheory,3dzfzx,kajimeiko,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:34:42 2015 UTC,"Kant argues that the condition for the possibility of making such a judgment involves the positing of ordered regularities in nature, as though the world around us were designed according to a purpose.

As such, aesthetic judgment has the structure of a determinate cognitive judgment insofar as it posits or implies an orderliness/purposiveness in nature, but differs insofar as it can never find the right way to fully express that orderliness/purposiveness   -""in nature""- but how about within art?  Is kant saying the beauty( by using the word beauty i know i am ignoring his 3 categories of aesthetic appreciation, so apologies for that) found in an art object is its ability to complete a purpose? In this case, a purpose being, let's say,- deft communication of an idea.

CriticalTheory,3dzfzx,enormousloser,2,Mon Jul 20 20:15:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if there is a clean, all-inclusive answer to that question.  I'm not an expert in aesthetic theory by any means, but I can recommend some books that, I feel, have been very enlightening for me.   Six Names of Beauty by Crispin Sartwell. This book is a pretty casual introduction into other alternative cultural conceptions of what us westerners might call Beauty. It is basically, a counter to the notion that aesthetic beauty is a universal thing. The section on Wabi-Sabi, in particular, is a really good cultural description of that characteristically minimal and humble aspect of all things Japanese.  Selected Writings by John Ruskin. This is an anthology of writings/essays from the victorian era. It is very poetic and dramatic, and really speaks to to things like the wonders of the natural world, poetic inspiration, and the Sublime- an aesthetic sensation of ultimate majesty. There's also some good stuff about the essentials of gothic architecture. Semiotics: The Basics by David Chandler. This is not exactly a light read (I never finished it, to be honest) but it really is a fascinating one. It's more about linguistics that it is about making art, but its implications are far reaching. In a nut shell, Semiotics or Semiology is the study of signs. It's a deconstruction of the communication of ideas and information. It will make your brain fall out of your head.   On a personal note though, I really recommend taking an existentialist approach to this question. Art does not exist in a theoretical vacuum. So much context is required for producing, critiquing, and understanding art- and so I don't think there is any one true way to rationalize art. It all depends."
CriticalTheory,3dzfzx,kajimeiko,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:12:45 2015 UTC,"Art is a historically and culturally determined concept, not a cultural universal, and its purposes spring from its specific contexts. Art is relatively recent in origin (the Renaissance) and confined to the West. The purposes of art are products of this intellectual tradition; the Western concepts of art include seemingly opposed positions such as expressionism (making you feel) and the appreciation of beauty (aestheticism); both of these are rooted in avant-garde traditions that emerged in reaction to the idealism/classicism of the art academies, which themselves grow out of Renaissance concepts of the painting and sculpture as liberal arts, concepts in turn based on the revisiting of the texts of classical antiquity.  The multiplication of the purposes of art in the 19th through 21st centuries--e.g. as social criticism, satire, raising of consciousness, political activism, etc. grows out of the proliferation of -isms rooted in the conflict between avant-gardes and the academic tradition.  This is a distinct, Western set of intellectual traditions with an associated set of historical institutions (galleries, museums, art criticism, the discipline of art history, etc.) that have nothing to do with non-Western or pre-modern concepts of creation, beauty, design, etc. etc."
CriticalTheory,3dvvur,dlm2137,8,Sun Jul 19 23:37:16 2015 UTC,"Here you can watch Zizek eat breakfast while he talks about how contemporary Marxists shouldn't defend Soviet communism:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nh7qrUh1mY  If I had to make a guess at his distinguishing features of ideal Communism vs. Soviet communism, it would be that the Soviets didn't usher in the radical change to ideological/imaginative life on the basis of ""brotherhood""; instead they had something like economic socialism with a political totalitarianism. I would say Zizek's ""smoking gun"" for the failure of Soviet communism would be its obsession with explicit propaganda (and, like, the murders), since an emancipated or revolved state would probably be able to police itself internally (the members in some kind of collective agreement)--not that every state that polices itself internally is a good one."

CriticalTheory,3dvgxo,skeach101,4,Sun Jul 19 21:30:14 2015 UTC,"then is feminism a ""structuralist"" ideology, since it's based on what it means to be female/woman. Wouldn't a post-structuralist reject these labels?   Well, there certainly are ""essentialist"" feminists, some of whom are probably structuralists. I was just reading Linda Hutcheon, and I believe she makes the point that there are many kinds of feminism, some of which clash not only in their objectives, but also in their underlying worldview. She specifically calls her kind the radical post-structuralists. See also:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-structural_feminism  The main angle for post-structural feminists is to denaturalize the supposed and inherited discourse of the ""nature"" of the female. So, what it means to be a woman is simply how someone who is female becomes interpellated and identified in society (what Butler loves so much about drag--a spectacle that perverts our naturalized understanding of gender)."
CriticalTheory,3dvgxo,Bananasauru5rex,2,Sun Jul 19 22:07:08 2015 UTC,"I think the point you made at the end is key so I'm going to make it again.   ""Just because it's a social construction doesn't mean it isn't real."" The idea is that, despite the claim that there is no essence of womanhood, people are still treated differently based on their being identified as women. Plenty of men are rapists looking for a woman to rape. Women face cat-calling, etc.   Therefore, even if one were to reject the idea that women even exist, one would still be able to mount a feminist project based on how people identified as women by others are treated in society."
CriticalTheory,3dvgxo,thinkonthebrink,2,Mon Jul 20 07:38:01 2015 UTC,"And the post-structuralist would argue that time would be better spent breaking down those constructs rather than finding new ways to navigate them, correct?"

CriticalTheory,3dvgxo,kinderdemon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:16:47 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily ""breaking down"" is itself a modernist construct that needs to be viewed critically. Post structuralist feminism emphasizes the level of personal liberation (personal is political etc) over some utopian project to destroy gender forever. it'd be nice if gender roles died out or changed, but in the meanwhile there are practical inequalities to be dealt with and navigated."
CriticalTheory,3dvgxo,thinkonthebrink,2,Mon Jul 20 16:11:52 2015 UTC,I'm getting more and more confused with Critical Theory by the day it seems....
CriticalTheory,3dvgxo,exnihilonihilfit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:43:41 2015 UTC,"the difficulty is that the idea of breaking something down addresses it as a something.   so for instance, if I think that people labeled as women as treated unfairly, then I have to deal with the ideas behind those judgments and actions in their specificity. so how do I undermine the idea of an essence of femininity? maybe I've just moved the idea from ""those with wombs"" to ""those identified by others as female,"" but I'm still invoking the idea.   the other problem is that if you just say, well, all these ideas are lies and I don't want to deal with them, you're confronted with the impasse of identity and difference. so if I say, black people are worse than everyone else, that's outright racism and anti-blackness. but if I say, black people are human just like everyone else, then I render invisible the ways in which this is not true in practice, by invoking a category of sameness which erases or covers over difference and otherness.   The challenge is to find a way to appreciate radical otherness, and not get fixated on a universal category which is ultimately idealist- i.e. more in the mind than actual. On the other hand, getting bogged down in the particulars of radical otherness: race, class, gender, and ultimately individuality and subjectivity- leaves you without the ability to mount a large-scale political project actually capable of deconstructing, in a material sense, the cause of the abstract antagonisms analyzed by one's philosophy.   I.E. in order to actually break down men vs. women, we have to be able to address men and women on a mass scale (and others). to do that, though, we have to speak to people in their specificity: white, black, rich, poor, male, female, etc. But trying to get that right has often distracted from the question of large scale organization. I've repeated myself but I was just trying to be clear."
CriticalTheory,3dvgxo,Ameribro,5,Tue Jul 21 00:23:26 2015 UTC,"Feminism has several varients most of which are not ""based on what it means to be female,"" rather they simply try to explain and bring light to the experiences of women and to promote equality for women and men. As such, feminist theories often embrace poststructuralism as a means of eliminating  inequality. Still, there are other forms that may assert that there are meaningful differences that cannot be overlooked."
CriticalTheory,3dvgxo,qdatk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:06:20 2015 UTC,"Without going into the minutiae of dozens of competing theories, a high-level assessment would be that the strains of feminism which focus on identity politics can generally be brushed aside in a truly critical approach.

Furthermore he doesn't provide any sources for any of his ridiculous claims like ""information is corroding the market's ability to form markets correctly"" or that ""intellectual property is valued in modern accounting standards by guesswork."" Markets despite all their flaws and failures, are still the best way we have found to distribute goods and services. And yes, current tech accounting is currently rough, but it has ALWAYS been the case. When transistors exploded onto the computing scene in the 70's no one knew how to value that market, same with radios, or the cotton gin, we can see this happening on reddit right now. Continuing, philosophers, social scientists, and even economists have been predicting a ""post-scarcity"" economy for centuries if not millennia. I'm sure you guys have heard of the luddites. Here is Keynes doing it http://www.econ.yale.edu/smith/econ116a/keynes1.pdf[1] . But while the nature of the work may have changed (Horse buggy repairmen to Mechanics, for example) there is still work to be done.

The problem we face with democracy and capitalism, is that we have it good. That means there's not much urge to improve democracy and to think of a better system as capitalism. At least for the majority of people. Next up, the alternatives have been socially dismantled.   As for China, the thought of a loss of power likely was the catalyst that made them decide to implement capitalist characteristics. Next up, I sometimes wonder how much of a choice we have in our social systems. We are forced to compete, at least in the current situation, and this might force us to make certain decisions and this in turn leads to certain social structures. I see it as a sort of system game theory (be aware I do not know if it is similar). If there's not a universal cooperation, then there's a need for a specific system that can compete with others. Or, the most powerful system impose structural changes on the less powerful, that it will have to implement at the fear of losing. Of course this also comes down to what decisions are made, it is not that one specific structure is picked, but they must be picked.  I hope this adds to the discussion.

However, the Convention specifically allows export for reuse and repair under Annex Ix, B1110. While numerous international press reports have made reference to allegations that the majority of exports to Ghana are dumped, research by the US International Trade Commission found little evidence of unprocessed junk being shipped to Africa,[9] a finding corroborated by the UN Environmental Programme, MIT, Memorial University, Arizona State University, and other research.[10] In 2013, the original source of the allegation blaming foreign dumping for the material found in Agbogbloshie recanted, or rather stated it had never made the claim.[11]   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agbogbloshie"

But I'm not totally convinced at the wiki on Agbogbloshie. As I read it, Footnotes 9 is a study that shows that majority of official USA exports to Ghana are not junk but that doesn’t mean much as this kind of dumping is illegal, plus Europe is supposed to be the more significant origin. Footnote 10 is a ref to something on slashdot from a Bloomberg reporter that doesn’t support the contention of the sentence as neither “UN Environmental Programme, MIT, Memorial University, Arizona State University” are mentioned in the link, and foot 11 is an argument about what percentage of European exports to Africa are waste.     Plus earlier in the wiki where it says that it is an “e waste hoax”  the linked sources does not use the phrase hoax but instead says that  “In the case of Nigeria, this was at least 100,000 tonnes of e-waste entering the country illegally in 2010” https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewasteguide.info%2Ffiles%2FOgungbuyi_2012_BCCC-Empa.pdf    Unless I missed something....    I’d agree that the Basel Action Network gives exaggerated numbers at 80% of E-waste, but the counter sources listed above generally grant 9% of imported technology into West Africa is e-waste.     Plus anecdotal evidence that some of it is foreign in origin:   http://www.itworld.com/article/2774074/security/reporters-find-northrop-grumman-data-in-ghana-market.html http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/witness/2014/09/e-waste-trail-2014924132443417118.html http://www.dw.com/en/home-for-some-e-waste-dump-for-the-world/a-17313876     So I’d say on balance clearly some percentage of Agbogbloshie is waste comes from within Africa and some without."

CriticalTheory,3d4bdj,constant-desmond,4,Mon Jul 13 12:22:45 2015 UTC,"Nice! Your decently fair representation of both sides is appreciated, but the tone of this feels like you're ultimately trying to defend good ol' pop music against the curmudgeonly old Adorno. Though the content is there, the core positions and points don't feel particularly strong in their conveyance, I sense a lot of restraint in the writing.  He was definitely short and narrow sighted when it came to his larger understanding of pop music, and you make an excellent point about his inability to consider the future (probably his biggest misjudgment in this and other respects), but I think his finer points regarding music are often harder to fully appreciate without a very deep understanding of the ""serious music"" to which he so often refers, a knowledge which unfortunately today usually only a handful of academically educated musicologists, composers, and other musicians possess.   If nothing else, your suggestion that pop musics which reference ""serious music""s become somehow more ""serious"" in themselves is absurd, and one that would meet strong derision from Adorno and a great many musicologists, music theorists, and composers. Such instances usually amount to nothing more than cheap appropriation and fanciful posturing. The majority of such examples are simply a superficial textural imposition of one music on the core of another. The skeleton is the same, it's just been given a fancy bow-tie.  On another note, you use the term ""tonal serialism"" by which I believe you meant ""total serialism"". ""Tonal serialism"" isn't really a functional term, aside from the abstract concept of serializing tones in general, but such a definition is basically contained within the larger definition of ""serialism"" anyways, so it's a bit redundant even if it were in common parlance. Also, The Beatles and Pink Floyd never employed any such techniques. You may want to consider using a less specific and more accurate term, such as ""free dissonance"", ""atonality"", ""chromaticism"". Though those are all problematic in their own ways, they're at least not quite so blatantly wrong (by nature of their being a lot less specific).  Sorry if that sounds like I hate you. I'm glad this exists, I just think it could have used a bit more editing, and consultation with some music specialists."
CriticalTheory,3d4bdj,moviedude26,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:32:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the longer response! -- I hope you don't mind if I try to clear a few things up.  I certainly don't feel like I'm defending pop music from the curmudgeonly Adorno, I suppose for a couple of reasons. Firstly, I see it as a mistake to read Adorno in this, often totalizing, way. Like Rose or Scherratt, I consider that any disdain in Adorno's work was gleaned from pessimism, which does actually entail a lot of hope that gets overlooked or ignored. This is certainly true of pop music, which leads me to the second reason; the fact that towards the end of his life Adorno conceded that he'd heard a great many pop songs - which shouldn't be overlooked - this doesn't seem to move towards any need for a defence. He was certainly not what I think he is often mistakenly perceived as.  I'm happy to concede a mistake in my mention of tonal serialism and I'm grateful for that, but an attack on my musical understanding is maybe a little too strong - I'm not sure why my own musical studies should be overlooked because of this alone!  Anyway, my main reason for a reply was in regard to this part of your post:   ""If nothing else, your suggestion that pop musics which reference ""serious music""s become somehow more ""serious"" in themselves is absurd, and one that would meet strong derision from Adorno and a great many musicologists, music theorists, and composers.   This is a misunderstanding of my claim and, it should also be noted, a conflation of Adorno with other sets of thinkers (as you said, musicologists, music theorists and composers) which doesn't serve to really understand either, I think this kind of reification would be something that would meet a lot of derision from Adorno. My point is that Adorno's original paper does make claims against pop because of a lack of musical tradition or lineage. We know what he made of the correspondence between, say, Beethoven and Schoenberg. My claim was instead that pop music can have a tradition and, better yet, one that can exceed itself and incorporate elements of the other in a way that serious music struggles with - this kind of absurdity seems to me more like an antinomy in the original separation asserted by Adorno, one that he didn't just overlook at the time but simply didn't understand because the social movements were lost on him, so his interpretation of both pop and jazz was based too rigidly on the harmonic language involved. I don't think that pop is made more 'serious' by means of incorporating 'serious' music but that, instead, we can see any number of groundings of pop lineage all the time. I wish I'd added a small mention of Animal Collective in relation to The Beach boys now! If I was making the claim you interpreted, you would definitely be correct to argue for a cheap appropriation - this is the argument I do not make because I would have to agree with it. It was something I thought about a lot after having read Badiou's 'Fifteen Theses on Contemporary Art'   Thanks for your feedback"

In the context of Baudrillard's general thoughts on consumption, he sees consumable objects as being signifiers in a language of consumption; when you buy into a product, you take on a whole system of consumptive signifiers along with it. Sign value is all about that — the object as a symbol within a framework of other symbols rather than simply an object with its use. The object, as a signifier, stands for more than just its use. He talks about this in his Consumer Society work, if you want me to look up/quote exactly where he says this just let me me know :)  oh and also, Baudrillard's work on consumption is very much related with Thorstein Veblen's ideas regarding conspicuous consumption, you could look into him a bit if you are interested in consumption. Sign value has to do with conspicuous consumption: when you buy a Ferrari, you arent just buying it solely to use it as a method of transportation — you are buying into the image of the Ferrari, both the logo and what that stands for as well as the social benefits that one gains from being able to show it off.

Wheat, for example, is a distinct use-value differing from the use-values of cotton, glass, paper, etc. A use-value has value only in use, and is realized only in the process of consumption"" (A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy)  It looks like use-value is more concerned with explicit function -- by saying use-value is manifested in the use of an object, a conscious use is implied. Along with the emphasis on the physical characteristics of the commodity, it seems to be differentiated from more ambiguous, even unconscious uses of the commodity as seen with prestige, conspicuous consumption, etc.   I should note that I'm not that knowledgeable with Marx and could be missing something, I'm just going by what I currently understand of use and sign value. I think a question behind what you're suggesting is ""what does it mean to 'use' a commodity and how is that understood in use- and sign-value?"" There very well could be something worth critiquing in Marx's or Baudrillard's understandings of use-value and sign-value."
CriticalTheory,3cqiu0,MagikalGoat,3,Fri Jul 10 04:22:59 2015 UTC,"It looks like use-value is more concerned with explicit function   Dude no. Use-value is the object in its specificity. It is not an action or a utility. It is the object.  From the same page you used, but its citation of the first chapter of Capital:   The utility of a thing makes it a use value. But this utility is not a thing of air. Being limited by the physical properties of the commodity, it has no existence apart from that commodity. A commodity, such as iron, corn, or a diamond, is therefore, so far as it is a material thing, a use value, something useful. This property of a commodity is independent of the amount of labour required to appropriate its useful qualities.   You can also think of it in the way that Marx patterns his arguments in the first few chapters of Capital:  [topic] : [specific/qualitative], [general/quantitative]  value : use, exchange  labor: concrete, abstract  Concrete labor is the particular labor wholly incomparable with any other, e.g. ""I just brushed my teeth"" describes a concrete labor wholly different than ""you brushed your teeth"" or ""I brushed my teeth last week.""  (And ""brushing teeth"" describes an abstract labor because it can be quantified by averaging the labor-time.)  Take that pattern and look at value: use-value is a particular qualitative form (object) wholly incomparable with any other, e.g. a specific toothbrush has a particular use-value distinct from all other toothbrushes. (And toothbrushes in general have quantitative exchange value.) Nowhere is the act of brushing teeth needed for the existence of use-value, because the use-value is the specific object."
CriticalTheory,3cqiu0,soceng,2,Fri Jul 10 16:45:32 2015 UTC,"Oh okay thank you for the clarification, I thought I was missing something. So use-value is meant to distinguish the physical object from its other characteristics (exchange value, sign value, etc.); I guess me and OP were confusing utility and use-value. Going back to the original question, OP is wanting to know whether utility is involved with sign value — so what I should have said is that utility is about explicit function, not use-value, right?"
CriticalTheory,3cqiu0,MagikalGoat,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:25:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, utility is about explicit function. And (though I don't know much about it) it sounds like you have sign-value spot on:   consumable objects as being signifiers in a language of consumption; when you buy into a product, you take on a whole system of consumptive signifiers along with it   Though it probably is also like use-value, that is, specific to the particular object. Or is it maybe determined by its position in the network of signs? Like, is an expensive watch of different sign-value when it is next to another expensive watch than when it is next to a cheap watch?"
CriticalTheory,3cqiu0,soceng,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:34:01 2015 UTC,"I just went back and read some of George Ritzer's foreword for Baudrillard's Consumer Society, he explains just how Baudrillard's sign-value ties in to Marx's use-value:   ...what we consume is signs (messages, images) rather than commodities. This means that consumers need to be able to read' the system of consumption in order to know what to consume. Furthermore, because we all know thecode', we know the meaning of the consumption of one commodity rather than another. Commodities are no longer defined by their use, but rather by what they signify. And what they signify is defined not by what they do, but by their relationship to the entire system of commodities and signs.   As he says a few pages before this, sign-value actually replaces use-value -- while of course use-value (the physical object) still exists, use-value no longer matters as much as sign-value, the symbolic dimension of a commodity. Especially when you consider the immaterial nature of social life with the advent of the Internet and the current state of media, the symbolic meaning of a commodity has become increasingly important.   I shouldn't have been lazy and just gone back to the text to begin with, that would have saved a lot of trouble lol"

CriticalTheory,3cqiu0,grumpenprole,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:50:03 2015 UTC,"No, it's not.   Symbolic Exchange and Death:   Capital no longer belongs to the order of political economy: it operates with political economy as its simulated model. The entire apparatus of the commodity law of value is absorbed and recycled in the larger apparatus of the structural law of value, thus becoming part of the third order of simulacra (see below). Political economy is thus assured a second life, an eternity, within the confines of an apparatus in which it has lost all its strict determinacy, but maintains an effective presence as a system of reference for simulation. It was exactly the same for the previous apparatus  the natural law of value  which the system of political economy and the market law of value also appropriated as their imaginary system of reference ('Nature'): 'nature' leads a ghostly existence as use-value at the core of exchange-value. But on the next twist of the spiral, use-value is seized as an alibi within the dominant order of the code. Each configuration of value is seized by the next in a higher order of simulacra.   Maybe you should have asked, is use-value unique from sign value?  The reason is that positing use-value as a tenable concept only works within the world of individuals, needs, products, etc. But all these things are only simulated. So there really isn't a use value, only sign value. For example, what is a candy bar worth vs. a can of soda? The debate here is not about, well, how many calories does this one have, do you look good consuming it, etc. It's that the entire discourse around value is ultimately a play of signs.   Use-Value relies on the split between nature and labor to make sense. Baudrillard posits that this construction is idealistic (aka a simulation) because it projects the idea of nature onto the outside world- passive matter for the manipulation of labor. Here's a link.   I feel like most of your discussion is about whether an objects utility due to its prestige or other signification-based value should just be another part of use-value. But the real challenge of sign value is that it undermines the whole notion of use-value. It's not longer ""the ferrari isn't just about getting from point a to point b,"" it's undermining the commonsense logic that there is a point to getting from point a to point b, attempting to criticize all our so-called rational behavior as, basically, our self-medicating to convince ourselves we're sane and banish the Others outside (if you know Baudrillard, you know this means the dead)."

A commodity, such as iron, corn, or a diamond, is therefore, so far as it is a material thing, a use-value, something useful. (458, Karl Marx selected writings. Second Ed.)   To Marx, an object's utility makes that object a use-value. That use-value as a ""property of commodity"" is ""[...] independent of the amount of labour required to appropriate its useful qualities"" (459). However, these use-value objects gain Value when imbued with human labour. For a use-value to become a use-value commodity, ""[one] must not only produce use-value, but use-values for others, social use-values"" (462).  Unfortunately, I have not read Baudrillard yet. So, I can not comment on the text that produced sign value. However, from the wikipedia entry linked, it seems as though sign value, or ""strange social properties"", would be part of Marx's Fetishism of Commodities. For Marx, a commodity has both material and immaterial value (473)."

Once an object has made the 'cut', been worked with and graduated to a commodity, it will then inherently have use-value, regardless of any utility beyond simply being a commodity?

CriticalTheory,3cp1fl,RobGlass,2,Thu Jul 9 16:58:13 2015 UTC,I continue to think that the hardest ideological blow that could be struck against the current European system is represented by the demand for the complete elimination of Greece’s debt – a speculators’ debt for which the Greek people bears absolutely no responsibility.    Anyone want to defend that?  Seems a little hyperbolic.

The problem is that assuming an entire nation is culpable for the debt incurred by its previous governing body makes no sense, given that it's not their fault ultimately, it's the fault of politicians who played around at their people's expense. Further, it's not their fault that the conditions demanded to pay the debt back were simply one sided and unacceptable. They were being bullied into accepting shitty lives because someone made some bad investments.  The last bit is the most important. Creditors aren't playing by their own rules. In debt relations, debtors are assumed to be responsible enough to pay back their loans. But the creditor takes the risk that this won't ever happen. Thus in Greece's case, its creditors aren't willing to accept that they made a bad investment. Moreover, the initial loans were from private banks, so we encounter a classic case of trying to privatize profits and socialize losses. If Germans are looking for people to be pissed at, they should look to the banks that roped them into paying for their own mistake.  Greece basically called the bluff of the standard debt myth which says creditors assume a risk, in order to avoid having debtors prisons."

CriticalTheory,3cfwt2,kajimeiko,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:56:14 2015 UTC,"Contradiction is present in the process of development of all things; it permeates the process of development of each thing from beginning to end. This is the universality and absoluteness of contradiction which we have discussed above. Now let us discuss the particularity and relativity of contradiction.  This problem should be studied on several levels.  First, the contradiction in each form of motion of matter has its particularity. Man's knowledge of matter is knowledge of its forms of motion, because there is nothing in this world except matter in motion and this motion must assume certain forms. In considering each form of motion of matter, we must observe the points which it has in common with other forms of motion. But what is especially important and necessary, constituting as it does the foundation of our knowledge of a thing, is to observe what is particular to this form of motion of matter, namely, to observe the qualitative difference between this form of motion and other forms. Only when we have done so can we distinguish between things. Every form of motion contains within itself its own particular contradiction. This particular contradiction constitutes the particular essence which distinguishes one thing from another. It is the internal cause or, as it may be called, the basis for the immense variety of things in the world. There are many forms of motion in nature, mechanical motion, sound, light, heat, electricity, dissociation, combination, and so on. All these forms are interdependent, but in its essence each is different from the others. The particular essence of each form of motion is determined by its own particular contradiction. This holds true not only for nature but also for social and ideological phenomena. Every form of society, every form of ideology, has its own particular contradiction and particular essence.   jesus h christ..."

CriticalTheory,3cdyw9,WorstHumanNA,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:28:24 2015 UTC,"I think a question like this, on this particular subreddit, is obviously going to garner a lot of agreement of sorts - don't forget, the recent 'favourite critical theory book'-thread had a lot of praise for Discipline and Punish 1.  ""Classrooms. Schedules. Standards"" - You're mostly talking about Foucault's conception of the different procedures which aim to produce docile bodies. We know, for example, that Foucault considered the body docile in the extent that it can be ""subjected, used, transformed and improved"".2 In staking these claims, he acknowledges two prerequisites for the subjection of disciplinary modes: (i) that the individual be constantly observed and recorded while (ii) the internalisation of disciplinary individuality, or a transformation of the soul, is ensured in the body of the controlled. These modes of control make an economy of the body, controlling the operations of the subject through constant coercion. Docile bodies don’t simply do what is expected of them, they do what is specifically expected of them. In this way, the body is specialised and rendered suitable for insertion into the mechanisms of production.  Since you mentioned test scores, it seems worth adding that Foucault gave us three modes of disciplinary procedures:   (i) Hierarchical observation -- this mode of discipline is aligned with manifesting particular practices in the individual by making the body accustomed to the gaze, an anxious state in which the individual is aware of being viewed.  (ii) Normalising judgement -- under the threat of being judged abnormal, individuals maintain particular codes of conduct that place them on a scale in relation to everyone else.  and then, the combination of both constitute a third modality of control,   (iii) The Examination -- the exam proceeds by way of determining what the individual knows and further controls behaviour by coercing a pursuit of particular study or treatment.3    1.

Amyways the section about Nature as masculine and masculinity as Natural is brilliant.    Loving Nature thus becomes enslaved to masculine heteronormativity, a performance that erases the trace of performance: as the green camp- ing slogan puts it, “Leave no trace.” Masculinity performs no performance. If you appear to be acting masculine, you aren’t masculine. Masculine is Natural. Natural is masculine.

These are larger social trends, which are particularly visible in Django and The Help, not unique to those films"
CriticalTheory,3c463v,agtaeckerwyss,7,Sat Jul 4 22:41:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can use them as examples if you have to rip them out of their context to do it. One of the most important parts of southern stories is the gothic, that the story itself and every scene takes place inside of a setting of horrible brutality. It is something the audience cannot ignore because it is right there in their face throughout however to the characters it is not necessarily identifiable in the same way even if they know brutality is there. Even if they have to interact with it in some way(and they always do) it is basically just the essential stuff of their environment. This brutality that is so apparent to the audience is a part of the character's world and always has been, it presents itself in the world as the world, not as a power structure or system of things but instead as a force of nature itself that can only be weathered rather than dismantled. If you are familiar with noir sort of stories you know that it is characterized by the protagonist coming to terms with the idea that there are forces that are simply much more powerful than he even if they are unjust. Southern gothic is much the same, only that there is no big reveal. Everyone knows it from the start. The characters understand this even before the audience does because they grew up in it. Not only this but the characters may not even understand what is to unjust about it even if it painfully obvious to the audience. Brutality is there as a staple of their society.  It reminds me of another concept in other stories which is karma. A good example of what I mean by this could be Ong-Bak 2, the martial arts film taking place in medieval Thailand where the protagonist is a Prince that was dispossessed of his birthright by some kind of coup when he was very young. He was trained into adulthood by benevolent bandits and allies to the common people. At the very end the protagonist is actually defeated. it is revealed that the sword strikes he delivered to the king that stole his father's land did not kill him and the entirety of his ambitions is undone. At the very end he is lying on the ground, defeated, and the narrator ends the movie explaining that this was just karma and essentially the way of the universe, and just how shit works out sometimes. Admittedly they ended up making a third Ong-Bak movie where he escapes his captors and somehow wins the day, but it seems a lot like a hastily thrown together ""do-over"" and sort of strips the second movie of that sort of karmic quality that made it so good. The Ong-Bak 2 even had a very dark sort of mood to it, where it was not uncommon to see a bunch of people rounded up as slaves and maybe thrown into a crocodile pit for entertainment. This sort of thing is of course what the protagonist and his crew set out to fight even though he doesn't manage to save the day in a final climactic moment where what is right utterly destroys what is wrong as is so common in these types of movies.  I think the point is this. The Author didn't like that the characters did not see it through a larger political critique. But when you are dealing with southern gothic something needs to be understood. When we see brutality in the south it is not presented as a political system that can be changed, it is as though the fucking gods are toying with these people. And they basically are when we think about the kind of total power some people can have over others under the old south. It is like Karma, or the Odyssey. We are all very aware at what a shitty deal Odysseus' men get in that story and it bugs us because in his punishment by the gods, they get cut down. Shit's not fair at all, however the way the story is told we don't even get the option of ruminating on why they get punished as well or why the gods are such assholes, they just are. The gods are petty assholes, Odysseus' men are doomed for seemingly no trespass they are guilty of, and the reader is left really wishing there would somehow be some goddamn justice even though the author is just like ""yea its pretty brutal and unfair and kinda just how it is, let's move along with the story or Odysseus shall we?"""
CriticalTheory,3c463v,ruminating,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:16:57 2015 UTC,"I think you make a good point here, which touches on a broader issue I have with a lot of CT. I've noticed that a lot of critique tends to imply that the entire subjective experience of oppressed people is defined by a constant, directed sense of injustice, and that those who 'get on with life' do so only because they are ignorant. This thinking can be seen as far back as Marx's notions of class consciousness. If we accept this reductive view, it becomes unacceptable for a film to portray oppressed people who don't achieve some sort of 'enlightened', revolutionary consciousness. However, the idea that we -- the 'enlightened academics' -- can dictate the 'true' experiences of others is not only conceited, but potentially very dangerous. For example, in the introduction to One Dimensional Man, Marcuse quite explicitly implies that a life exploited under capitalism is not worth living -- I doubt that the people whose lives he refers to share that view. While it's true that oppression is always operating on an unconscious, symbolic/ideological level, we can't forget that everyday life still persists even in the worst conditions. Ignoring this robs oppressed peoples of something fundamentally human, and reduces them to their identity.  sorry if I got too off-topic"

Just because a piece of art is commodified doesn't necessarily mean that it instantly and completely loses all of its value in terms social critique, analysis, or perspective.  And, in fact, I think if you look that you'll sometimes see art which has been commodified but which effectively beats the censoring power which might have restricted it.  But just because I put price-tag on something and put it in the market doesn't mean that it can't still have some redeeming social value.  That's not to pass judgment on the particular films in question either way, but it seems a bit ridiculous to completely write off the value of a film simply because it was featured in a theater.

Brilliant. I love it.   Can someone please explain to me the quoted Deleuze paragraph at the end? It sounds like to me he's saying that if you view everything in terms of only difference there's no antagonism anymore, no 'proletarian' and 'capitalist', no 'master' and 'slave', but it still creates antagonisms. Someone explain this to me? And what's this beautiful soul in reference to?"
CriticalTheory,3bit86,neoliberaldaschund,6,Mon Jun 29 17:19:34 2015 UTC,"A quick and dirty explanation:   The 'Beautiful Soul' is a reference to Hegel. The quote is an attack on the Hegelian dialectic wherein antagonism, change and difference is thought of as external to and dependent upon prior identities.  Deleuze's main criticism here is that Hegel has failed to think of difference in itself. He can only think of difference in relation to the Same, or a prior identity - prolitarian/capital, master/slave and so forth.   Instead, Deleuze builds a notion of difference divorced from dependency. For Deleuze, like in the work of Bergson, difference differnentiates itself from itself without need for mediation. Antagonism is therefore inherent to difference itself.   Hope this helps."
CriticalTheory,3bit86,Several_Wolves,3,Mon Jun 29 21:20:38 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. Thanks for the explanation. This is the critique that Zizekians  like to say about Deleuze, if there's only difference how is there any antagonism. Useful, thank you."
CriticalTheory,3bit86,neoliberaldaschund,3,Tue Jun 30 00:10:24 2015 UTC,"No problem. In my view, the Zizekian/Hegelian critique doesn't meet Deleuze on his own terms. Deleuze's point is that there is no need for difference to be raised to the point of contradiction and in fact no need for there to be an 'antagonism' in the external sense called for by Zizek and Hegel - these are dialectical concerns.   From a Deleuzian perspective, the dialectical approach, with its dependency on external difference, cannot account for the necessity of being since the cause of the dialectical movement (difference) remains external to its effect (sublimation) and its terms (identity).   If the cause is external it can only account for the possibility of being. For there to be a sufficient cause, however, it must be internal to its effect: hence difference differentiating from itself without mediation. This is the Deleuzian virtual.  If you're interested in reading more about this, Hardt's book on Deleuze is a great place to start. I'd also recommend Henry Sommers-Hall 'Hegel, Deleuze, and the Critique of Representation'."

CriticalTheory,3bbyob,AnxiousReginald,8,Sun Jun 28 04:37:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, the video glosses over this point which Butler does make herself:   ...the very possibility of becoming a viable subject requires a certain gender mime be already underway. The ""being"" of the subject is no more self-identical than the ""being"" of any gender; in fact, coherent gender, achieved through an apparent repetition of the same, produces as its effect the illusion of a prior and volitional subject.

You'll probably find the first thesis rather familiar (first line of Kapital Vol. 1):   THE WHOLE LIFE of those societies in which modern conditions of production prevail presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles. All that once was directly lived has become mere representation.   Capitalism become spectacle through the use of images (life mediated by images) wherein the mass of advertising and capitalist produced images produces a sense of reality that is always just beyond my sight. I'm a boring schmuck, and everyone else a block over is really living life like I see on TV and in advertisements.  His followup Comments on the Society of the Spectacle is more lucid, but not as powerful I think, but it's a quick and important reading.

CriticalTheory,3b6rxt,SMLCR,2,Fri Jun 26 22:17:33 2015 UTC,"I don't know how patient you were/are when it comes to reading Marx, but your question is sort of difficult to answer when you aren't equipped with the content of all three volumes of Capital. If you aren't willing to commit yourself to reading all of it like me (I'm currently a third of the way through volume three) then I would suggest picking up Marx's Capital by Ben Fine and Alfredo Saad-Filho for a brief rundown on everything that comes after volume one.   The reason for this is that Marx's logical procedure is starting out with concepts arising out of elementary and basic abstractions, leaving aside phenomena which are not intrinsic characteristics of the concept itself--e.g. Marx's insistence on beginning his analysis of money by abstracting away the use of money as capital in order to establish what constitutes money by itself. After he does this he proceeds to critically examine higher, more complex forms of economic phenomena as modified extensions or sublated forms of the previously established simple concepts. This was why after I finished volume one I felt sort of dissatisfied about how apparently oversimplified the theory seemed (which is how I imagine you might feel) in light of how complex economic reality actually is. My questions were only answered as I went along.  I'll give one example pertaining to your concern about ""post-industrial"" capitalism. In chapters 13-15 of volume three, Marx discusses his Law of the Tendential Fall in the Rate of Profit (LTFRP). The rate of profit is given by the ratio s/(c + v). As productivity develops, constant capital (c) enlarges, thus increasing the denominator and diminishing the rate of profit. A crisis of overaccumulation occurs when variable capital (v) can't be invested at a rate of exploitation (s/v) high enough to halt or counter the decline in the average profit rate; and as you already know, employment is undertaken only insofar as this facilitates the valorization of capital. To combat the declining profit rate, capital is invested in developing countries where rates of exploitation are higher owing to their mostly labor-intesive industries (where the ratio of variable capital to constant capital is higher in relation to advanced capitalist countries). These high rates of exploitation serve to increase the average profit rate back in the home market and the labor force there increasingly becomes employed in service sector industries to facilitate the metamorphosis of capital through its circuit (M-->C-->P-->C'-->M...) and serve primarily to realize the surplus-value embedded in commodities now produced offshore. Hence post-fordism and globalization.  My advice for your research is to try and acquaint yourself with the many crevices of Capital as you can bear to sit through. Your reading list is perfectly fine but there's also a plethora of content in Marx can't afford to be passed over in my opinion."

So when someone criticizes CT seriously and from an informed position, countering CT on their critical projects (and thus using 'means of CT' itself), it seems likely to me that those critics are quickly swayed under the umbrella of CT. If they would use other, simpler means, that is: ""simply saying that CT sucks, is anti-American etc."", then they are the bozo's you referred to.   It seems that if you take CT seriously and offer critique on it, there's a good chance that you are quick to be swayed under CT as well, even if you don't want it. Likely, you're said to be 'just approaching CT/critique from a different angle', but still a critical theorist.

CriticalTheory,3ar63t,lulzzzzz,3,Mon Jun 22 21:06:03 2015 UTC,"I find this analysis to be quite weak, and built on some very faulty assertions about games:   My first, and simpler objection is that using a framework for analyzing film unsurprisingly overlooks all substantive qualities of games, and it is no surprise, therefore, that games are reduced to ""film, just playable films."" This observation is true insofar as films are 'still images, just moving still images' -- that is, not at all.  My second objection stems from the author's analysis that games are attempting to be indistinguishable from reality. I would argue just the opposite, that the crux of a game's design is how it is made unreal; how it rejects, subverts the 'functionings of reality'.   This aspect of games should seem most obvious from the fact that nearly all games take place in radically different worlds from our own. This occurs not only in the sense of setting, character, or appearance -- elements which the author seems most interested in, but which are ironically more characteristic of film and literature than of videogames -- but on the far more immediate and fundamental level of the actual 'laws of the gameworld'. Through these differences of structure and function, gameworld and gamic action exists within an altered symbolic network, in which even those supposedly 'real' elements bear new and different meaning  For example, the criticism of GTA5 as ""...basically a reproduction of modern day L.A. with the only imaginative content being the narrative and controlling of highly successful criminals"" misses the most important feature of the game, namely the way in which it makes all actions largely inconsequential. Although the world it models is far closer to a direct, unimaginative mapping of reality than most, the ways in which it is unlike reality are precisely what makes the game. On a very basic level, you (the player) are occupying a world in which you can be shot dead, run over, etc. an infinite number of times, and walk out of the hospital a moment later with little punishment. This inversion fundamentally reorganizes the ways in which the world is understood and interacted with. This is why players will perform actions which they would find horrifying in reality; if GTA5 were functionally indistinguishable from reality, players would behave just as they do in the real world -- a behavior which no game to my knowledge seeks to produce"
CriticalTheory,3ar63t,agtaeckerwyss,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:42:28 2015 UTC,"I see no difference in the narrative structure of films and video games save for the direct control of the protagonist, whereas in film you passively engage and identify with the protagonist. In most games the overall narrative of the game remains the same regardless of the minor manipulations from the player.  As for your second comment I simply looked at the scrutiny of graphical quality, frame rate, etc. in video games as an aesthetic indistinguishably between virtual and reality. For example in GTA, the aesthetics resemble modern L.A. with the narrative (or filmic) content being manipulated and differentiated from reality. Again, I'm focusing on aesthetic indistinguishably. The inconsequential actions of the player in GTA (muder, crime, etc.) is just that: inconsequential. The abstracting into the character that simulates freedom makes the player unaware of the immersion into an aesthetic, immaterial reality that remains constant in the virtual game and outside in reality."
CriticalTheory,3ar63t,agtaeckerwyss,2,Sat Jun 27 22:43:46 2015 UTC,"First off, sorry if I came off as rude; if I'd known you were the author I would have addressed you more directly.  Like I said, you're analyzing games using the conceptual frameworks of film (and to a lesser extent literature), which is why all gamic action seems to you superfluous. What you identify as 'narrative' is not really the narrative formed through the lucid experience of play, but rather the strictly filmic elements contained within that experience. Furthermore, filmic elements are not a consistent feature of games as a medium, or even as a tradition. Many games have few, or none at all -- try to understand Tetris as a 'playable film'.  I admit that the structure of cutscenes and major plot developments in most contemporary big-budget games tend to parallel film, but these elements cannot be privileged above the actual play experience. People tend to use the term 'narrative' to refer to games' filmic elements, but this popular term shouldn't be conflated with 'narrative' in the more typical sense, meaning a sequence of events forming a story. Using this latter meaning, just because the actions performed by the player aren't always acknowledged in cutscenes doesn't mean they aren't part of the narrative -- keeping in mind that each player's narrative is different, and there is therefore no 'fixed' or 'correct' narrative. The majority of GTA5's narrative wouldn't be the crime drama you describe; it would be running over pedestrians, shooting at cops, getting killed in stupid ways, etc. These aspects seem to you 'minor manipulations' because they are inconsequential to (or at odds with) the filmic portions. Rather than attempt to deal with this contradiction, you have made the filmic elements into the 'true narrative', which overrule and dismiss the gamic events.  Similarly, your comment seems to suggest that your usage of 'aesthetics' refers solely to the audiovisual aesthetics. However, this ignores the many other aesthetic qualities particular to games, most importantly the 'systems aesthetics' -- often called 'aesthetics of play'. Systems aesthetics are the aesthetics communicated through the ways in which the game world is systematized and expressed through game mechanics. the particulars and complex interactions across these systems are tremendously aesthetically significant.  For example, contrast old-school Resident Evil against something like Left4Dead. Although similar in audiovisual content, setting, and premise, these games are vastly different aesthetic experiences. Even if every character, location, audiovisual element, and scripted (ie filmic) event were made identical, the mechanical differences alone create an irreconcilable difference in the way every game element is experienced. The same zombie making the same sounds in the same room is still a different aesthetic experience because of the mechanical dimensions present. Again, an analysis of games cannot be performed without the analysis of those elements which are uniquely gamic.  If you'd like some game studies/ new media theory literature that expands on these topics I can recommend:   Aarseth, Espen. 2007. “I Fought the Law: Transgressive Play and The Implied Player.” Galloway, Alexander R. 2006. “Gaming: Essays on Algorithmic Culture"" Järvinen, Aki. 2009. “Understanding Video Games as Emotional Experiences.” Myers, David. 2009. “The Video Game Aesthetic: Play as Form.”   although to be honest these texts simply re-articulate concepts which game designers have been using longer and with greater nuance. Games themselves (that is, specific games, not 'games in general') should be the basis of your analysis, and you'll learn far more by critically engaging with a game than by reading some Deleuzian explain their most basic features  (edited: formatting)"
CriticalTheory,3ar63t,SMLCR,2,Mon Jun 29 05:07:06 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say that the step from film to video games is superfluous but that these aspects of playability and interaction are better looked at if taken as a subtractive step. The immersive aspect is not something added to film but is a reduction, and thus abstraction, from the Benjaminian role of film in society. I used to play video games a lot back in the day and the positive aspect of gaming (I mean here the pleasure in escapism) is a potentially toxic one in my opinion. I tried to make this idea more explicit with a sort of underlying Heideggerian theme where modernity is plagued with the lack of Being, or the inability of anyone to even raise the question of Being in the first place. Most importantly, the late Heidegger's turn toward the analysis of art is in the foregoing of the scientific comportment toward being as merely an end for exploitation and human gain for an aesthetic of just letting the ontic world be and remaining at a sort of a distance: I see the same ontological difference here between the person playing a video game and the person viewing a film. So by aesthetic I mean more of a phenomenological comportment not merely the audio/visual or material form the games take but the transcendental comportment the player takes necessarily in interacting with the virtual space. Even Tetris has this minimal difference (exploiting blocks versus letting them be) so this 'systems aesthetics' sounds like a good topic. Where I had previously stated that games are merely playable films was a bastardization of the properly dialectical sublation of film to video games I was really trying to make with out getting too heavily into the theoretical aspect. So, while yes the playability of games is superfluous to the aesthetics of the film as deployed by Benjamin, it still somehow becomes its own demon I describe as the way the properly everyday, postmodern subject behaves, or with the aesthetics of singularity. In the cited Jameson article he talks about the move from the modern into the postmodern, you could even parallel this same movement in the difference from film to games: which, again, was an implicit assumption in my article.    I admit that the structure of cutscenes and major plot developments in most contemporary big-budget games tend to parallel film, but these elements cannot be privileged above the actual play experience. People tend to use the term 'narrative' to refer to games' filmic elements, but this popular term shouldn't be conflated with 'narrative' in the more typical sense, meaning a sequence of events forming a story. Using this latter meaning, just because the actions performed by the player aren't always acknowledged in cutscenes doesn't mean they aren't part of the narrative -- keeping in mind that each player's narrative is different, and there is therefore no 'fixed' or 'correct' narrative. The majority of GTA5's narrative wouldn't be the crime drama you describe; it would be running over pedestrians, shooting at cops, getting killed in stupid ways, etc. These aspects seem to you 'minor manipulations' because they are inconsequential to (or at odds with) the filmic portions. Rather than attempt to deal with this contradiction, you have made the filmic elements into the 'true narrative', which overrule and dismiss the gamic events.   Yes, here is the subtraction from film I mean. While the player is performing these acts of violence he is acting as if he were a criminal as suggested by the framework of the narrative implicit to the virtual (video game) realm. With the abstraction into the medium and immersion of the person playing as the games character, this narrative becomes hyperreal, or with the simulation of freedom the framework becomes subsumed into the very inaccessible primordial realm Kant describes as the noumenal. This closing off of Being is precisely the function of immersion that makes illusive the implicit 'correct framing' and is done with the simulated free acts of the player that you say give a second meaning to 'narrative'. However, this is the exact role of the postmodern logic in controlling the everyday subject that I'm trying to make explicit: this ambiguity of narrative that is a key aspect for the role of film as political. So at this level the role for society in film parallels that of the video game (both as mapping apperceptions and representations for everyday comportment), however with the latter (the movement toward the postmodern) this role is made more ambiguous through the provided artificial freedom that makes more real the virtual: hence the proposed emphasis on analyzing the reality of the virtual for a diagnosis of everyday life. The act of playing a video game gives an illusive, positive role to the immersion and becomes an end in itself which masks its own negative character of removing the filmic revealing of Being through passivity.   So, I don't overrule and dismiss gamic events but simply transpose them to the virtual where they become implicit coordinates for the very reality of the representations characterizing life. Overcoming these contradictions you describe (I admit, your analysis here was spot on but the contradictions nonetheless are crucial to my analysis) land us back at the medium of film, or the passive observer where the gamic events are null and void but still very real at that level of analysis.   Thank you for your responses though, you haven't been rude at all. I suspect that I maybe didn't even know exactly what I was writing until now, with a critical engagement, and I feel the idea has been developed all the better for it."

CriticalTheory,38y8qs,StrongbowPowers,3,Sun Jun 7 21:29:06 2015 UTC,"The best thing you could do would be to find a really good Derrida teacher, someone who isn't hostile to his work and is willing to go over it with you.   Beyond that, you can read his work (Structure, Sign, and Play; Of Grammatology; Writing and Difference), and the background texts that influenced him that might also help you (Heidegger, Husserl, Hegel, Marx, Freud, Shakespeare, Joyce, etc.), and of course books about him and deconstruction as u/evagre pointed out, and all of those things may help or mislead you to varying degrees.   I was fortunate to get a thorough introduction by a great Derrida scholar as an undergraduate, where we spent most of semester going in-depth on Of Grammatology. A focused reading on something like that is about as good as you could get, with some ancillary readings of Rousseau and Levi-Strauss, with a group of people or a professor seems to be the most productive way. Given your self-professed entrenchment in ""analytic"" philosophy and your username, I'm guessing you're in Britain or Ireland? And I could see why it would be hard there to find someone willing to help.   It's frustrating for me, because I've seen a handful of posts like this where people are interested in seeing what all the Derrida hype is about but then are turned off by what seems to be ""nonsense"" to them. I will say that, one of my professors once told someone that ""just because you don't understand something doesn't mean it's nonsense,"" and I think this is the sort of mindset you need going into Derrida. I promise it's not nonsense; he is purposely ""slippery"" in his meanings and usage of terms because his writing is actually trying to exemplify his message. You're correct in your observation that a number of explanations of deconstruction miss essential points. If anyone ever calls deconstruction a ""technique"" or a ""system"" or a ""tool"" in their explanation of Derrida, then stop reading it. Derrida's point was that deconstruction was not something someone did, it was something that was already happening regardless.   I would also say, as a starting point, that one of the main lessons I've taken from Derrida is to stop believing in ""perfect,"" ""nature,"" ""pure,"" or even ""god,"" since any godhead would be perfection and the basis or meaning, structure, etc. If you take that starting point to heart, and if you think it through to its numerous conclusions, you can see why people would be against Derrida on principle. His own philosophy was essentially a critique against the whole tradition of Western philosophy starting with Plato, and, in a way, continuing a project started by Nietzsche, Heidegger, etc.   (You may also see why looking for a ""skeleton key"" text might now seem kind of funny to a ""deconstructionist"" or Derrida scholar, since that is almost exactly what he avoided. Which reminds me, have fun! It's all about play and joy, rather than the abyss and nihilism.)  This was long, but I hope helpful to OP or anyone else looking for a start."
CriticalTheory,38y8qs,buckykatt31,2,Sun Jun 7 23:20:09 2015 UTC,This is the best intro text to Derrida's work that I know of: http://www.amazon.com/Deconstruction-Nutshell-Conversation-Perspectives-Continental/dp/0823217558
CriticalTheory,38y8qs,theagonyofthefeet,2,Mon Jun 8 05:10:42 2015 UTC,"In addition to--uh--most of the comments here, you could watch a few of these videos from a graduate class in Modern Rhetorical Theory in which Derrida is evidently pretty integral. The prof is great and he gives a background and walks through Structure, Sign, and Play. You should have no problem following along and it's a really great intro. These 3 video's are primarily concerned with Derrida: Structuralism Primer, Structure Sign Play 1, Structure Sign Play 2."
CriticalTheory,38y8qs,Louie-dog,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:29:08 2015 UTC,"I think there are two possible responses to this. One would be to say, your final intuition is correct: Derrida is responding to his particular mid-twentieth-century French version of the European/continental philosophical tradition, so that knowing that tradition is crucial to understanding his response. One place to start here are Husserl’s Logical Investigations and what Derrida does with them in Voice and Phenomenon: lots of the typical moves are set out here. Beyond that, Heidegger's Being and Time helps to explain things like what Derrida might have meant by the term “presence”, so very common in his early work, and why the notion that being = presence might have been something he wanted to critique. My experience at least, when I was first coming to grips with Derrida whilst writing my dissertation (also in literature), was that the more Hegel-Husserl-Heidegger I had read, the more his own texts made sense to me.  However, this might be the long way round. So another response would be to point you towards some secondary literature, perhaps specifically a book I have only read parts of, but which has the advantage of being both explicitly introductory/explanatory and something Derrida himself was involved with, Geoffrey Bennington’s Jacques Derrida. If you do take a look at it, I'd be interested to know if you feel that it helps at all, because I’d recommend it to others if it does."
CriticalTheory,38y8qs,evagre,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:01:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response! I'm definitely going to look into Bennington's book (I think I can snag it on Interlibrary Loan - I'll let you know how it is). Reading Derrida definitely makes Hegel seems accessible by comparison, so I may take a detour into some sections of Phenomenology of Spirit before I tackle Husserl."
CriticalTheory,38y8qs,evagre,2,Sun Jun 7 22:37:43 2015 UTC,"As an afterthought to this: if you feel that your background in analytic philosophy is making it more difficult than necessary to understand Derrida, one philosopher you might find interesting/helpful is a guy called Samuel Wheeler at the University of Connecticut. Note in particular his Deconstruction as Analytic Philosophy, published in 2000."
CriticalTheory,38y8qs,humanstain,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:21:07 2015 UTC,"Christopher Johnson's very short book in the Routledge Great Philosophers series does a good job of putting across the early Derrida. It's savvy: It concentrates on one especially important section from OF GRAMMATOLOGY, but manages to restate in plain speech much of Derrida's early theory of language just by glossing those pages. Suzanne Lüdemann's POLITICS OF DECONSTRUCTION is also an introduction, but focusing on his later work, after what is sometimes thought of his ethical-political turn. The introduction (about JD's precursors) is weak, but the rest of the book is lucid and reliable."
CriticalTheory,38y8qs,ripe_program,0,Mon Jun 8 02:58:26 2015 UTC,"hm some long responses.   How about. ""Derrida for Beginners"" (illustrated). ;). It's quite good.  My real suggestion though, is to adjust the way you read. Go in loose, hang around, come out before you're out of juice. Rinse, repeat. The meaning is in your response.   Does that sound strange? No one is marking you; there is no ""theoretical framework"" to identify; it's not a memory game.   As they say, reading like this is also a kind of writing."
CriticalTheory,38y8qs,The-Internets,-1,Mon Jun 8 05:01:51 2015 UTC,"In the abyss 'sound functions' which comprise 'audible' language start to disintegrate before being called upon for use. Its as if your 'body' (a whole topic in itself with such an environment) and its relevant 'parts' time-travel and stop the completion of such impulses, like you pushing against your own finger when trying to enter an mirror. You are doing it and not doing it, by doing it you are not doing it, not doing it oddly enough doesn't do it, but make no mistake if you are doing it you do do it just in such a way as to not do it as you do it not doing it. So you can't really say 'it can't be done'.. fak  Why does this matter? Well, if you follow, you are not following, since you are using functions of comprehension tied with 'audible' as in you can 'translate comprehension.' What I mean by this, which is a terrible terrible way to say it and probably should never be repeated - like above - for comprehension's sake, the very-ability to 'mental' -to- or -the- comprehension is the 'evidence' you are either (in)directly using or 'translating' 'audible-ish functions.'   At first glance about such writings this understanding could help you. Forget 'comprehension' and 'understand' the above as you 'gaze' with yourself, knowing, you are reading. You will take care of the reading, you need to 'understand' what is said. To read without reading, or more appropriately, read without reading to <any>. Trust yourself to do the mundane for you, then and not only then but most likely then you will start to see and perceive the intricacies and modularities necessary to develop understanding.   Example: Analytic (an ally's tic | an alie tic-a onewaylie habit) | Anal(y) tic-an anal habit | ana ly tic | an lit ic-an lit I see) and it goes on and on. Using not only phonetic but uncompromising ""prefix/suffix"" 'technology' (haha) and other forms of lingual bullshitterii its possible to turn almost any sentence, or word if chosen right, into a whole dissertation of itself, which could have as much or more combossibility than its self."

No funding at the New School, and Committee on Social Thought is beyond highly selective. If you apply for the latter, be very specific about the contours of your project. If you don't already have a project in mind, I wouldn't bother applying because you will not get in on having a vague research direction. In terms of advice otherwise, I would say focus on individuals rather than programs. Seek out current critical research+theory being produced and key in on the people behind it. Apply to them in your applications because that's how you get in. It's far more committee members going ""I like this candidate, I want to work with them"" than the committee as a whole making an aggregate decision. And only apply to places with full funding. It's harsh, but it's necessary to say that given current conditions, you will avoid debt and position yourself to have a career in academia only if you can find a department which thinks you're worth funding. If no department thinks you're worth funding, you have to consider the likelihood of departments thinking you're worth hiring down the stretch."

Minnesota also has a good program—Critical Studies in Discourse and Society. You might also look into Stanford's Modern Thought and Culture. They're critically oriented in the sense that they are highly transdisciplinary (or anti-disciplinary, if you like). If you're interested in critical approaches to media, look into Brown's program in Modern Culture and Media and NYU's program by a similar name (this is all from memory, so I apologize if I'm slightly off). In terms of relevance, I would say critical theory is growing in relevance at different schools, especially if you're interested in political economy. Particularly at UC schools, there's been a heavy increase in concern over capitalism since the 2008 meltdown. There's also been a rise in interest in histories of capitalism from a critical perspective around the country, which differs enormously from ""economic history"" as traditionally conceived. Hopefully some of this helps."

I was intending to look for cultural studies programs but from what my advisor has told me, to go for strictly cultural studies is to really limit yourself in terms of what you can do upon completing the PhD — she suggested I do sociology with a focus in culture instead. Sociology allows you to branch out a bit and fill a decent number of positions; unfortunately for critical theory, many people either do not know what it is or may have negative connotations for it. Sociology is flexible and (especially in conflict theory) is very accommodating of critical theory — the important thing is who you are studying under, not necessarily what your degree is called. Look at a few schools that interest you and look at the the research interests of the professors there — if you see multiple people that teach theory and multiple ones that teach cultural sociology, that could be a good fit for you."

He's missing out on a lot of the nuances - such as the fact that Deleuze originally opposed sense and these incorporeal transformations on the surface of bodies with the schizophrenic language of depth in Carroll and Artaud, respectively. I can't explain that change any better, but it would be nice to have some explanation.  Maybe I just need to go through his stuff again and see if he references it elsewhere, though."

But the thing is not to offer a solution to the people, but to pose a more adequate question.   Could anyone expand upon what he might be talking about here? I can understand the first half of the statement, but I'm not entirely sure where he's going with the second half. An adequate question in what sense?"
CriticalTheory,378p8e,Surtur1313,6,Tue May 26 14:40:38 2015 UTC,I think he's refering to the fact that sometimes problems are only problems because we are too attached to the idea of solving them instead of thinking whether or not they are the real problems in the first place. — This point is similar to what Zizek mentioned in examined life about recycling. That the notion of recycling takes place only because we are not really ready to change our waste generating consumerist lifestyles... ie. the problem is not the pollution or the waste we generate but the way of lifestyle itself - consumerism. (ie. seeing the problem between symptoms and disease)
CriticalTheory,378p8e,poltsi,-2,Tue May 26 16:46:26 2015 UTC,"He's prefaces this statement by listing out a bunch of solutions offered by other theorists. Zizek thinks that by delving into the present situation, describing it endlessly, ad nauseum with a couple dirty jokes, should be enough to change the world.   This is why I dislike Zizek's ideas. He provides nothing more intellectual than a group of stoners sitting in a circle talking about how bad the world is, man. Zizek dresses his arguments in the ""correct"" theoretical jargon and gets worshipped by those who cannot understand there are different solutions to the same problem. His audience are those paralyzed by the enormity of our social problems. It's easier to hear how bad the world is than to hear how much work it's going to take to fix it. Zizek wants to address and readdress and readdress the problems of democracy and capitalism but provides no path. Zizek is simply a critic. How hard is that these days? Everyone's a critic, right? It's hard to come up with viable solutions to the present social problems. It's a lot easier to parrot everyone's ideas and frame them in polysyllabic words that make English majors feel justified for being English majors (source: I'm an English major).    The solutions and questions thing is a pillar of Zizeks thought and I just can't get behind it. We need solutions, not a fancy retelling of the problems."

CriticalTheory,378p8e,PseudoExpat,1 point,Tue May 26 16:31:53 2015 UTC,"Not entirely true because we must conceptualize something before we build it. Hypothesis is the first and most important step of the scientific method. This is where we must think and not do.   It's all about the right tool for the right job. Science is good for the material and things we can sense and making technology. But philosophy is what drives the abstract human-centered institutions of our society like religion, politics and economics.    Zizek rarely adds anything new to either science or philosophy. To me, critique requires solutions. It's lazy and irresponsible to simply be a critic without solutions. Why should we listen to someone like that?"

No one with any Marx-style materialist sympathies would think this, and Zizek is just a tad Marxist.   Of course Zizek adds nothing new to science. Why would he?  I don't understand that criticism.    As for adding to philosophy, that's pretty vague. You can find antecedents for almost everything everyone says. But in a relative sense, the way he puts the Lacanian subject of desire, Hegelian negativity, and the cogito together is pretty new.

Simply critique with a little bit of vague Marxism. It's easy to complain but hard to come up with solutions. I think its lazy and irresponsible to rile up the intellectuals without providing a clear plan. Its his responsibility to create this plan out of his ideas, not ours. He gets off the hook this way and gets away with never really committing to an actionable philosophy. His philosophy is empty, has no teeth, so I consider him a marginal philosopher at best among the others on my bookshelf"

For example, in some sense, post-structuralism is a critique of structuralism, but it can also be read as continuing the project of structuralism by different means. I think the same could be said for postmodernism, or even something like postrock.   To answer the OP, off the top of my head I'd take a look at Paul de Man's The Resistance to Theory, Linda Hutcheon's The Politics of Postmodernism. ch. 2 of Zizek's Living in the End Times, Etienne Balibar's Equaliberty, Eduardo Cadava, ed. Who Comes After the Subject?. Maybe also Lyotard's The Postmodern Condition. David James' essay ""Metamodenrism"" might also be useful.

I also think the author may be a bit reductionist in their reading of Object Oriented Ontology, but I'm not well read enough on that subject to know.  I think my biggest problem with this is that the author seems to ignore the gap between omission and repression. They simply state that because we don't talk about it, it must be symptomatic in some way. I don't think that would necessarily be true as that would mean the entirety of the unsaid is symptomatic, which reduces symptomatic to an empty adjective.

CriticalTheory,36qyvl,mosestrod,3,Thu May 21 12:45:21 2015 UTC,"Things have inevitably changed, capitalism has mutated and globally things have altered enormously. The party's over and Jameson's book was written before the music stopped so whilst it's value maybe exists primarily as a retrospective the text does contain a shadow of capitalism's true form, if it can be considered a form.   Jameson's whole line of enquiry seems to reflect glimpses of capitalism at work, moving and mutating beneath the surface of culture. It permeates the text like some ominous shadow beneath the ocean. I approached the book with some apprehension, knowing little of art, but it really is compelling and having grown up in the 90s it really seemed to expose something about late capitalism and the shift in global power that's occurred post 9/11.   It stands to reason that Jameson's  analysis in this book may not reveal as much as about today's capitalism but it could be argued that that, in turn, is evidence of the of the truth behind the impressions of capitalism's amiable adaptability that we see in the book. New perspectives are necessary in order to expose simialr fleeting glimmers of what moves beneath the surface today, but it might be that postmodernity has passed through the phase of its existence where a shadow can be cast at all and capitalism has eclipsed entirely any chance for a clear illumination of what swells the waves of Western culture. I believe that Jameson's success in this text belongs to the past but it is perhaps one of the last truly successful insights into capitalist culture before it engulfed us as it has now. But I'm a gloomy pessimist."
CriticalTheory,36qyvl,cremefraicheeee,2,Sat May 23 09:32:20 2015 UTC,"I read this text in a class last semester and it is a work I'm studying for my Masters. I admit that I was hostile to this text at first. The amount of information he packs into his sentences is intense and intimidating on a first read. But I found all of this text stimulating, or at least intellectually provocative, especially his notion of pastiche. Jameson writes that the culture of late capitalism can no longer appeal to the moral import of satire and he insinuates that genuine satire is not possible in the ""spectacle society."" My critical theory prof was a student of his (Robert Tally, see the term ""geocriticism."" I can't find the link right now but Tally wrote a great essay on Stephen Colbert which questions Jameson's claim (will hunt down link and edit this post, but it appears in the collection Stephen Colbert and Philosophy)).      Jameson marks a definite turn away from ""traditional"" Marxist  analysis (a la Adorno, Benjamin, Habermas) toward a more optimistic (or at least resigned) form of Marxist critique.  Personally, I liked his essay ""Postmodernism and Consumer Society."" (This is the essay which the first chapter of Postmodernism grows out of but it is an easier read as an introduction to Jameson's thought.)  The text is very impressive and still very relevant today. I think it is a must at read for anyone diving into (post)modern critical theory."

I have a lot of issues with those movements -- particularly when they are used in a vulgar form (dragonkin, #KillCISWhiteMen, 'they' as a singular pronoun) -- but it has been difficult to argue that we can save critical theory, given its dependence on a conspiritorial hermeneutic (wherein the existence of a critique is, arguably, the source of its truth-value).

CriticalTheory,360mbm,dishspongesghost,6,Fri May 15 02:18:36 2015 UTC,"So I'll speak as someone who read Capitalism & Schizophrenia but who also has a mental illness, I guess.  At the end of the day, I choose to medicate myself because I want to keep living.  Mental illness is often a life and death matter.  Not only that, but when I'm depressed or too manic, I can't do what is needed for me to survive in this society.  In a perfect fucking world without capitalism, would I be unmedicated?  I would need to spend almost 24/7 taking care of myself and would likely need a caretaker to provide me with meals.  Taking care of myself might include doing productive things that make me feel like I have purpose and worth, but most likely, when I'm having an episode, I would have to dedicate 24/7 to not killing myself or harming others.  I would likely need a part- or even full-time caretaker.  Would I even have a mental illness if society wasn't so fucked?  Who knows.  Maybe I'd be a goddamned priestess instead.  But it doesn't make me feel liberated or empowered to even think about this shit, because taking care of myself in the present, in reality, is so urgent.  I understand that not everybody feels this way.  You should look into SPK, the Socialist Patient's Collective.  They were an activist group of people with mental illnesses who wrote about ""using illness as a weapon"" against capitalist society.  It's pretty cool, but my main critique of them is that not everyone has the time, energy or clarity to be an activist or whatever, and I think it's almost ableist to suggest that there wouldn't be mental illness without society, or that people with mental illness would be better without society.  That said, I second u/terry_cosmo's suggestions, as long as you read them with the understanding that people with mental illness have agency.  I understand that everyone on an anti-depressant may not ""need"" that anti-depressant, but people can choose medication without being coerced by a doctor or capitalist expectations of functionality.  In a perfect world, I might still choose to medicate, because mental illness fucking sucks.  I do not think it sucks because society tells me it sucks, I think it sucks because of my lived experiences.  In fact, medicating makes me far more capable of participating in subversive activities and thought than I would be able to otherwise.  So when you're talking about mental illness abstractly, you can never remove yourself too much from considering people's lived experiences.  I have not touched on involuntary medication or hospitalization or diagnosis because I have no personal experience with that.  I have luckily not felt oppressed by hegemonic psychiatry.  I understand that like any other professionals, though, psychiatrists and therapists can be agents of social control.  I don't think that being such is an inherent trait of that role, though.  I think it's quite possible to be a psychiatrist who defies overmedicalization, overdiagnosis and even the concept of sanity.  Obviously though this is not the case for all practitioners and I think those who are not critical of the social function of psychiatry do a disservice to their patients, without a doubt.  I hope this was coherent.  I'm at work so sorry if it's not."

If depression comes from social assemblages, I think it follow that the only way to un-depress yourself is to have that assemblage's characteristics change.

CriticalTheory,360mbm,terry_cosmo,4,Fri May 15 23:47:14 2015 UTC,"I also think the way we commonly treat psychological illness isn't very beneficial...I guess because it's often seen as a ""cancer"" that needs to be stripped out of the psyche, or pushed back down so it doesn't manifest, when in my experience both of these actions make it worse in the long run. Even if it's scary to consider, I feel like a healthier way to deal with this would be to be more open to it. Of course, it's a tricky topic... Some people I find have interesting views on it are Alan Watts, for example, in his talk ""The value of psychotic experience"": https://youtu.be/cuX8sKr1Sa4 Then R.D. Laing has some interesting talks about depression and schizophrenia as something to overcome, not something to numb out until it's not felt. He has a metaphor of depression as being a prison (easily found on youtube), where he says how most of us find ourselves in this prison of depression and the door is open. But it's us who don't go out, because we stubbornly feel we need to discover why we ended up in that prison, what it is, what's happening. We spend so much energy remaining in a bad place because we want a sense of closure. And yet, he claims, this investigation can only happen from outside the prison, and that one of the biggest chains that keeps us in it is this desire for ""knowledge"" to be acquired from within the bad place. Then on a more radical side, there's Terence McKenna, who talks of the schizophrenic state and many of its effects (perceiving patterns everywhere, seeing and hearing things, etc) as being inherently positive traits that help the individual become more aware of one's own psyche and thus heal. But because culture turns these symptoms into ""things we must fear"", whenever one hears or seens things the first reaction is one of fear and paranoia, creating the usual ""someone is following me"", and other such thoughts. Here's a clip (someone's put music and visuals which I find distracting...): https://youtu.be/ZEglHjd_gUQ On another note, I find it annoying how mental illness is often bundled together with ""having strange opinions"". Mental illness is a very real thing, and creates a lot of suffering, but I think most of the suffering comes from the friction felt between the sufferer and culture's norms. There's a side of it that maybe has to do with neurology and thus could be helped by drugs, I'm sure. But there's a side of it which is simply ""a different set of opinions"" which have nothing to do with the social inabilities. For instance, Philip K Dick, science fiction author, had some very far-out and strongly held ideas about how time flowed backwards, the past was manufactured by aliens from the future, which were also God, and so on and so on. A psychiatrist sees this and assumes he's schizphrenic. Most people assume Philip K Dick was schizophrenic, but when you read his accounts of all this or watch interviews, read biographies, he was just as capable of living his life as anyone else. I mean that often the appearance of ""fringe thought"" is instantly categorized as ""dangerous delusion"", when what doctors should be worrying about is whether the patient is able to cope with their life in society, and not concern themselves with changing people's opinions about the world to fit one consensus."

I wouldn't say this is the case at all, at least not among mental health professionals. I'm currently studying Clinical and Health Psychology - and have received psychotherapy and counselling for various mental health issues. My understanding is that the current, mainstream view of mental illness is that, contrary to being a ""cancer"" that can be 'pushed out', it isn't something that can be neatly cured. Drugs are acknowledged to be useful for managing symptoms, but talk therapies which teach patients the skills they need to keep their symptoms at bay are recognised as the best long-term solution (though the effectiveness of both drugs and talk therapy depends on the disorder and specifics of the therapies used). It's not so much trying to 'strip out' the problem as saying ""you have this problem, here are some ways you can cope with that problem"".   I'm not sure where the idea of 'pushing it back down' comes from, because the consensus in my experience seems to be that ignoring a mental illness and avoiding talking about it will just make it worse (unless you're talking about how the general public sees it? Because if so I agree, there is still quite a lot of harmful stigma around talking about mental health). That said, I can't speak for the entire field, and mental health treatment is pretty broad and diverse. Things also might be different in other countries (I'm from the UK, and don't know much about mental healthcare in other countries). I'd be really interested to hear more about your thoughts and experiences concerning this."

The point is that seeking help for depression through ""mainstream"" ways does not preclude radical action/anticapitalist discourse/whatever your goal is. For example, I take anti-depressants, but they have worked to motivate me to work against the system instead of being apathetically complicit with it. Seek help through whatever means you feel could help you, but don't let your new found happiness (if you're successful) get in the way of acting/thinking radically."

CriticalTheory,35u545,RobGlass,13,Wed May 13 15:09:07 2015 UTC,"I watched it through to the end and I'd like to propose that, despite the implication that her work combats ""neoliberal whiteness,"" Harper's engagement with ethical-consumerism is, essentially, a neoliberal proposition. Furthermore, I will argue that the fundamental tension between structural forces and personal agency found in such a position is also present in the privilege theory she mobilizes. My fear, spawned from the structural similarity in these arguments, is that privilege critique is not a revolutionary or anti-capitalist understanding of the world, but instead a tool of neoliberalism itself.  I would love to hear the rebuttal to this. I have been unable to work my way out of it on my own.    Harper aligns herself with ""ethical consumption"" theories that take as a prerequisite the idea that capitalism can function ethically if populations consume ethically: if we can just buy free-range chicken eggs, free-trade coffee, and commodities made under fair & ethical labor conditions we can fundamentally transform capitalism into the benevolent organizational apparatus that we desire. Such a formulation of consumerism is fundamentally different than its roots in Nader's push for regulatory apparatuses which protect consumers from abuse by corporations. The idea is that the onus is on the individual to solve structural problems through their individual actions, rather than the implementation of structural apparatuses which prevent unethical consumption and consumption patterns which reinforce abusive production conditions.  This is, for me, an incredibly problematic position. We might take as analogous the push for individuals to ""do their part"" in saving the planet from its impending ecological destruction by recycling their cans & bottles. Despite this highly successful campaign -- in my part of the United States recycling is ubiquitous -- capitalism as a structure still rewards the wholesale exploitation of our natural resources. (I think there is quite a large body of research into this point, Naomi Klein's argument that capitalism cannot solve the climate crisis being the most prominent instance.) My claim is that by pushing the responsibility onto the consumer we totally ignore the need to alter the structural conditions created by the politico-corporate class who ultimately determine the range of our freedom of choice in their very organization & direction of our productive activities. Insofar as Harper wishes to push the need for action onto the individual homo economicus for unethical practices, she practically absolves of responsibility those who implement unethical practices. This argument is, at best, playing into the hands of the neoliberal project and, at worst, actively supporting of its 'sickly individualism' -- it seeks not the regulation of the market-system, but the individual action.   Yet Harper still recognizes the existence of structural forces. In her explanation of ethical consumption, Harper reads several passages from her book Scars where Savannah, the black, female, (repressed) homosexual, lower-class main character, is confronted by the structural forces which lead her to make unethical purchases (e.g. she loves McDonalds). Harper uses the term ""Neoliberal Whiteness"" to describe so-called ""ethically consuming"" colonizers' inability to understand that unethical choices by the colonized are often a direct result of the structural conditions of their unprivileged experience-- Savannah's white, male, heterosexual friend, for example, criticizes her McDonald's habit, ignorant of the fact that she uses it as comfort food when the daily abuses by white, neoliberal society become too much for her. Yet Savannah does exercise her agency by trying to alter some of her behaviors, in one passage turning down the offer of a $15 chocolate martini in Greenwich Village (cocoa is produced under terrible conditions in Africa) bought by the same white, male, heterosexual friend. Despite the cool-headed poise of a 3rd friend (a South American whose father was killed for trying to organize workers in his home country) who teaches the white friend about abuses in cocoa production, Harper says Savannah's rage at the purchase & purchaser is justified.  So I think the tension is clear: there are structural forces in play which dictate and excuse the individual actions of some and not others. It is okay that Savannah eat at McDonalds because she is lower-class, et al. -- to her it is a cheap, comforting meal -- but it is not okay that her privileged friend orders a chocolate martini. And I mean.. this is the trap of privilege critique right? It is a simultaneous appeal to postmodern structural determinism and modern free-will, wherein the unprivileged group is primarily impacted by systemic forces and the privileged group has access to ""true"" agency. I guess you could read this into metamodernist theory which claims access to both modern and postmodern positions, but privilege critique is fascinating insofar as it assigns these two positions to different groups (or perhaps on a continuum based on a checklist of possibilities of privilege? or perhaps only in instances of comparison between the relative privilege of two actors?).  Just as in the recycling example, privilege critique puts the onus onto the individual to change systemic problems, but redefines ""individual"" as a position that can only be accessed through privilege; all others remain merely ""populations"" whose behaviors are dictated by structural forces. And, just as in the recycling example, it is individuals who must be regulated at the level of choice/action; the notion of introducing legislation to make ethical action viable in a market-system is totally excluded. (In fact, in the Q&A someone asks what Harper thinks about offering bonuses when purchasing healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables with food-stamps and she rejects the idea as an attempt to control the actions of unprivileged populations.) And so I double down: ""This argument is, at best, playing into the hands of the neoliberal project and, at worst, actively supporting of its 'sickly individualism' -- it seeks not the regulation of the market-system, but the individual action.""  What do you all think? I'll expand on anything if you have questions about my position."
CriticalTheory,35u545,MagikalGoat,11,Wed May 13 21:51:48 2015 UTC,"Your explanation of privilege misses the point of how privilege is usually used to describe scenarios. Didn't view the entire OP, but you seen to presuppose that privilege is an individualist construct, when it is not necessarily so. I can describe one group or individual as holding a privileged position against another group or individual without 1) making out the privileged group as the ideal for the rest to strive towards 2) assuming liberal humanism as the framework for evaluating harm or injury towards certain identities or 3) assuming the privileged group has some kind of god-like autonomy which the unprivileged do not have access too.  In fact, your whole response is based on structure and agency being two distinct concepts. You describe it mostly as there being one or the other, or a mixture of both. But meaningful definitions of either structure or agency must include the other within them. Agency means nothing if we cannot explain in some ways its limits, which is structure. Structure is similarly meaningless if it has no subject which to limit, which is agency. It really seems that throughout your post you use rigid binaries in order to describe the OP as inadvertantly supporting one side instead of the other, which is bad in your analysis (ex. neoliberal vs. non-neoliberal, individualistic vs. non-individualistic, structure vs. agency). Not taking any stance on the OP, but I think more nuanced descriptions of such concepts would be beneficial to the discussion as a whole. Setting up binaries like neoliberal vs. non-neoliberal have little relevance in a world in which neoliberalism pervades nearly every aspect of society.  Edit: I agree with your point that ""ethical consumption"" is a poor answer to the problems set up by the OP and probably furthers them by foreclosing opportunity and energy better spent on more revolutionary answers. But I do think that there are ways in which our own consumption can be more or less harmful, meaning that the OP is not something which we should entirely reject."
CriticalTheory,35u545,reconrose,3,Wed May 13 22:33:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the great reply!  You're definitely right about the binaries, though I would say they are mostly for the sake of brevity. For example, I am using ""neoliberalism"" as shorthand for the deregulation of markets, the focus on the individual for the facilitation of governance, desire to open markets, et cetera. The distinction between structural & individual responsibility is more complicated -- I do need to figure out their interrelation, this is true.  But maybe you (or someone) can explain privilege critique positively, rather than pointing out that there is a space for it to be formulated differently than I do?  Just to finish briefly, I still feel (despite your critique) like the focus on individual responsibility is the key component of privilege theory -- isn't it what makes it different from ideology critique which just offers false-consciousness as a way to absolve individuals of personal responsibility? And then do we run up against the point you do agree with in regards to ethical consumerism, namely that privilege critique may be ""foreclosing opportunity and energy better spent on more revolutionary answers"" in its obsession with the actions of individuals (or individuals in populations)? ... i think this is the thrust I was trying to make in my comparison."

CriticalTheory,35pxhy,SenatorCoffee,6,Tue May 12 15:27:07 2015 UTC,"There's a collection of essays called Deconstruction and Criticism that features Bloom (not really a deconstructionist), Paul de Man, Jacques Derrida, Geoffrey Hartman, and J. Hillis Miller. All the articles, save perhaps Bloom, perform deconstructive readings of a text. However, be warned, this is not an introduction to deconstruction, and the language used is very esoteric and the arguments are not always easy to grasp.   With this in mind, as a word of advice: read the poem that's being deconstructed before reading the essay. Deconstruction is trying to read the text against itself, giving a sort of alternative reading of the text. Meaning, if you don't know the standard, New Critic meaning, the real significance of the deconstructive reading will be lost.   Second, in my case, I had to read intro texts before penetrating Derrida, or even Culler. If you find yourself completely lost, I'd advise checking out Peter Barry's Beginning Theory which contains a simple chapter on deconstruction and an example of a deconstructive reading. If you still find yourself blurry on deconstruction, but don't find yourself ready for Derrida, I'd suggest On Deconstruction by Jonathan Culler. He's a deconstructionist who essentially translated Derrida into understandable terms, while also offering his own arguments. It's been an invaluable source for me, both for its insights, and its intelligible writing.    Then, if you feel you are read Derrida, I'd suggest reading a chapter in Of Grammatology called ""…That Dangerous Supplement…"" where he deconstructs Rousseau to show the dangers of arguing that writing is a supplement to speech.   That's all I've got. Good luck on you journey into deconstruction!"

In most cases deconstruction here encounters on opposites (dialectics).  2) Investigation of opposites in terms of their hierarchical relationship to each other. (Which element is more common, which is more rare, which doesn't appear at all ? Which element is rated higher than the other in the text?)  3.) Reversing and weakening the found pairs of opposites and their displacement by the non-said.  4).Development of another, ""third"" (in two-part opposites), ""fourth"" (in three-part opposites) etc. terminus for each found opposition which puts the historically consolidated contrast in movement or rather puts into light the always existing movement.

CriticalTheory,35pxhy,BlocMan7,2,Tue May 12 21:21:59 2015 UTC,"Correct. The way I was taught was to look for binary oppositions. One is usually thought to determine the other: master/slave, white/black, powerful/weak. You have one concept ""on top"" or ""in the center.""   Then what you do is, as we say, ""de-center"" it, because for us the opposites define each other by the way they interact in their relationship. The king is not the king without subjects. This interaction, not just ""downward"" but also ""upward"" is usually referred to as ""play."" You can imagine a circular shape to it. I'm not sure what you meant by a ""third"" thing emerging here, although maybe in reference to a sort of synthesis (I've barely read Derrida at all, i find Foucault much easier to understand).  There's probably better examples but i just think reading a Foucault primer would be good for getting a sense of how you can deconstruct history and political discourse.

CriticalTheory,35pxhy,squigglesthepig,3,Tue May 12 21:57:11 2015 UTC,"Here is an explanation of the process of deconstruction I posted some time ago. Not very good, but a beginning for some people.   I recommend you read the introduction to Of Grammatology written by Spivak. Pay attention to Pg lxxvi & lxxvii.  I also recommend Geoffrey Bennington's section called ""Saussure and Derrida""  from the Cambridge Companion to Saussure.  Then, finally read Linguistics and Grammatology(section 2 of Of Grammatology). This is how Derrida deconstructs Saussure.  Nevertheless, as /u/BlocMan7 has said ""That Dangerous Supplement"" is a good section if you're familiar with Rousseau. I, on the other hand, was more familiar with semiotics.   Lastly, On Deconstruction by Culler is definitely a must read.  Edit: Here is an excerpt from Culler's book:  ""In simplest terms, structuralists, take linguistics as a model and attempt to develop ""grammars""-systematic inventories of elements and their possibilities of combinations-that would account for the form and meaning of literary works; post-structuralists investigate the way in which this project is subverted by the workings of the text themselves.

In that case, one could consider the coupon community policing itself to be a de facto policing for the coupon companies themselves, for the companies are trying to spread their brand to the widest possible audience; by making sure people don't clear shelves, it furthers that goal.

CriticalTheory,35hq3i,whatwhywhoami,5,Sun May 10 14:12:48 2015 UTC,"The essay where he famously makes that claim -- that justice, like deconstruction itself, is undeconstructible -- is called ""The Force of Law,"" available in DECONSTRUCTION AND THE POSSIBILITY OF JUSTICE. I wouldn't say that he ""presents his full argument"" in that essay, but then presenting arguments isn't really Derrida's thing. You might also look at DECONSTRUCTION IN A NUTSHELL, which contains a long and approachable interview with Derrida about ethics and politics."
CriticalTheory,35hq3i,humanstain,1 point,Sun May 10 14:47:49 2015 UTC,"I think in The Force of Law he says that deconstruction is justice. I think he's systematically incompetent on this issue, maybe in a good way, but once you enter his labyrinth, you won't emerge for several years, so that'll use up any thought that could be devoted more freely to the matter.   Actually, justice is eminently deconstructable, perhaps not using Derrida's tools, but according to some pretty basic things. Since someone like Derrida assumes justice in a strange way, and is rather concerned with getting more authentic about things, he keeps justice largely unexamined, which is quite unfortunate. Justice should be deconstructed and reconstructed (enconstructed). Most interesting to see it coupled with the themes of ""force"" and ""law"". All a terrible quagmire that promises no progress whatsoever. Much like Foucault's ""power"" coupled with the genealogical enterprise, Derrida is more concerned with activating differences and breaking apart discourses that might close over authentic justice. But authentic justice itself is precisely what needs to be enconstructed, but that's a term Derrida never used...  EDIT: To fill out this difference a little, Derrida is about bringing force and law into greater authenticity, but leaves aside the fact that justice should be about creating the conditions of possibility of that which can only arise on its own. To be sure, those efforts in Derrida are all, in a way, oriented precisely to this condition of possibility, but he utterly fails to realize that justice to which he refers us by means of one gesture of authentication after another, that is, one refusal to take a given stand after another, one operation of unseating logicentrism after another, one effort to undermine totalization after another, the justice to whose presipice we are finally brought is the very sort of thing Derrida is at pains to disrupt: the imposition of force, the creation of the illusion of totality, equalization, the economic, etc. The same goes for Foucault in terms of power. What is lacking here is basic thinking in nonviolence. It's important to grasp that in these thinkers, and the same goes for Heidegger, there is a partial accomplishment of a kind of logic of nonviolence as a kind of ""non-force"", a will-not-to-will, but this is pretty well wholly lost in the process in the strangest of ways.   Wholly. Totally. Yet this totality is an absence. In the center of this absence lies ""justice"", which is a seething battle of forces and illusions, power and dominance, violence and brutal extraction. This is why Derrida, Foucault and Heidegger spawned no movements to really change the criminal justice system, why Foucauldian's don't really do anything about the prisons, why the nonviolence that could emerge within Derrida arises only as the barest aside in the admonition that totalist nonviolence would be the ""end of the world""."

Napoleonic law would has the same ""one big piece"" sense to it, but rooted in an individual fiat; Moses too, perhaps.  a cute video on law: https://youtu.be/elrTpoY6AYQ"
CriticalTheory,35hq3i,ravia,1 point,Tue May 12 07:12:03 2015 UTC,"As I said, it appears that Derrida is simply concerned to lead to justice without actually entering into it, and in that way I believe what he does is problematic. What you said here, coupled with this operator of ""strangeness"" you've included, sets up, quite simply an acceptance of anything from the justice of the beheadings by the IS to the dropping of Zyclon B in the Nazi concentration camps. It is there in war and sanctions. All very strange. But I think it is also there, right in the heart of Derrida: a fundamental problem especially in its dominance that has foreclosed precisely what thinkers today should be attending to: the unfolding and support of nonviolence thoughtaction.   The ""deconstruction"" of deconstruction is precisely something more original than the replication of the same in the negative form, the use of the means of totality and construct against itself. It is the turning of the en of enconstruction, envolution's reply to revolution and the non-metaphysical origination of nonviolence. Where the force of law would obtain, which is also where there is war, it is the melting of hearts, the defection of those who will no longer fire upon protesters who are members of their family and others. It is the authentic remorse buried beneath the law of conscience in which the guilty cower to the deluded satisfaction of those without sin in degradation of what harm is at issue. As the guilty and their captors -- themselves and / or others - - ape justice, they limp along behind authentic justice the way logic limps along behind original thinking, while the capitalists of Justice, among  whom we we must count Monsieur Derrida, make a living, a fortune, a killing off of the interests involved. In the case of Derrida, it is quite possibly the most corrupt operation of all, since it is precisely his operation to venture beyond law, to pronounce this beyond aporia, to fall back on metaphysics, to return to the Same under the revolutionary banner of change. In short, it is typical postmodernism, the ongoing dominance of negation paving over plenitude, possibility, amelioration and trauma in utterly controlled, crazed psylence and essential violence. But what does that mean, to pave over trauma? Derrida, who was given to consider the possible, including what he called ""the worst"", may not have been ready for the answer."
CriticalTheory,35hq3i,ripe_program,1 point,Wed May 13 08:45:56 2015 UTC,"hmm. Non-violence has always been a problematic notion. I watched Ben Kinglsly spinning yarn in a white robe, and then the waves of people charging each other later in film, and started wondering. You seem to have some personal investment in the term, which is admirable. I'm sure Derrida would have personally approved.   Are we talking about Violence? It is one of the themes which has attracted me to philosophy.    Neither Common Law nor German Law, supports those things you mentioned. To believe it does because those bad men and women, back then, did such things under the mantle of legality is to mis-understand.    The standard of common law (Justice?) emerges over time. It emerges from, excuse me, a logos,  a labour, perhaps; also, perhaps even a Capital Logos. ...Point being, it is not synthesized.   It can be, and is being, abused, of course."
CriticalTheory,35hq3i,ravia,1 point,Wed May 13 15:57:33 2015 UTC,"No doubt. But what philosophy has not pursued or even begun to ask the question of is specifically what has been termed is special way nonviolence. This has been as unaddressed as Being was for Heidegger. I don't think the movie Ben Kingsley was in is in any way a good introduction to Gandhi, any more than one could make a movie of the activities of Kant by way of introduction to his thought. Your prima facie reaction in which you draw together the broadest syntagm connecting a scene of satyagraha with a scene of violence is perhaps reasonable at a certain extremely provisional level, but if you are using it more rigorously it is essentially unacceptable. It all still leaves open whether one has any idea what they're talking about when they say nonviolence. At this level it really is very much like the meaning of being for Heidegger in relation to a Western metaphysics that had not even begun to ask the most preliminary ontological questions.  The Nazis certainly had their laws. I'm not at all sure it is a misunderstanding as you say. That the standard of common law emerges over time leaves on addressed the violence structures within such a law, and therefore their illusions. It is degradation arising from those illusions that led to the Nazis in the first place, which is another way of saying a failure to open that address what is really involved in non violence at a micro level in things such as the discipline of children, the use of force. As I said, it is a matter of procedure that Heidegger among others made recourse precisely to nonviolence as a matter of method and strategy in order to avoid the effects of violence in their interpretations. The core of the phenomenological method, that of letting things show themselves, is an essential non violence, but it is one that is situated regionally while in the situation of law it has a similar, parallel realization within legal systems and society. Justice rooted in nonviolence is like philosophy rooted in phenomenological preliminaries: both disrupt the particles of force owing to the impossibilities of force and violence. Nonviolence in the manner of extra diplomatic contest is a bit like Derridean deconstruction as it occurs within a text, at least in certain ways. But both Heidegger and Derrida failed to even begin to address or recognize nonviolence, just as they failed utterly to recognize Gandhi, which is quite remarkable when you think about it in that syntagmatic way of yours."
CriticalTheory,35hq3i,ripe_program,1 point,Thu May 14 22:21:16 2015 UTC,"Also, a plain question:   It appears that Derrida is simply concerned to lead to justice without actually entering in to it.

CriticalTheory,35avv1,mohawkvalley,24,Fri May 8 15:56:27 2015 UTC,"Something you and your associates have to ask yourselves is how appropriate it is to project the methods of the natural sciences onto human beings. Social theory certainly isn't as empirically verifiable as the natural sciences. However, the verifiability of the claims of scientific method to objectively capture the why's and how's of human behavior is also at question.   Methodology in the natural sciences works because we can control environments of experimentation and isolate natural phenomena away from other phenomena (e.g. controlled variables) to obtain answers and results. This becomes difficult to do with human beings. Furthermore, unseen social forces are at play influencing the way we think and understand ourselves and others. For example: have you ever been told that you need to read old literature in its historical context? This is fundamentally impossible since what you're actually doing is idealizing the past through your own historical consciousness in the present. Chomsky is certainly correct in the second video that historical facts remain the same. However, he doesn't adequately answer (in my opinion anyway) whether through facts alone he can determine the precise cause and nature of those facts. He is not only assessing facts from his historical consciousness, but also from his own specific share of the totality of socially produced knowledge existing in the world.  Human existence is finite and our finitude doesn't allows us to possess knowledge of everything in the world. Objectivity in the natural sciences is obtainable because scientists are able to parcel off relevant phenomena of study from irrelevant phenomena, thus obtaining the necessary parts and whole of an object of study. To obtain the same objectivity in the human sciences would require that we assume a god-like position outside of human history with the beginning of time and the end of humanity at hand as our parts and whole of study.  Social theory certainly isn't a complete picture of the world, but I don't think it pretends to be so; or at the very least, people who claim that their theory has higher ground over all others are full of shit in my opinion. The positivists who claim that the natural sciences hold all the answers are just as equally arrogant as the aforementioned latter.  Now, if we know we can't have all the answers, this might then lead one to ask what the fuck is the point of immersing herself in dense and difficult theoretical texts. In my view, deciding not to bother leaves us with even fewer answers than if we did. There's nothing to lose in studying theory.  Chomsky's certainly correct about the ivory tower separating academics from concrete social struggles. I also think obscurantism is a thing to be avoided. Theory holds rich insights and as such should be shared by everyone. If there's a simpler way of communicating a complex idea then by all means we should do so. However, I think this is more a problem about the impotency of contemporary academia than it is about the content of theory itself."
CriticalTheory,35avv1,deMonteCristo,5,Fri May 8 16:52:13 2015 UTC,"Objectivity in the natural sciences is obtainable because scientists are able to parcel off relevant phenomena of study from irrelevant phenomena, thus obtaining the necessary parts and whole of an object of study.    Except that it's not, in many cases.  What science has excelled at is pointing out when and where it has limits and drawing conclusions that are understood to be accurate within those limits, which are laid out, and which are not transgressed.  For example, the idea that measurement affects the reality being measured in quantum physics is an articulation of those limits (and one that is highly relevant to the social sciences).  In my opinion, where much social science goes wrong is in not articulating or even assessing its own limits very well, starting with not self-reflexively taking into account issues of social structure of the knowledge gathering process itself.  There is hardly any study within, say, mainstream economics, of the social structure of the economics field itself.  There is little to no justification of what constitutes independent 'fields'.  What, exactly, is the difference between sociology and economics?  It makes more sense to look at certain methodologies (deconstruction, modeling, empirical information gathering) than to argue that the fields as currently constituted make sense.  So why does this happen?  I would argue that this has much more to do with issues of power rather than impossibility.  To put it bluntly: never expect a person to understand what their salary depends on them not understanding.  The same goes for departments and institutions.  ""Democratize everything!""

I will say though that I used to be a diehard Marxist until I read Hans-Georg Gadamer's Truth and Method. I still possess an affinity with Marx and Marxism but since then I've ventured out more. The one drag about studying Marx is the amount of reading you have to commit yourself to in order to really get Marx, but I don't regret the time I spent reading all three volumes of Capital at all. I'm currently focusing on reading other theory and philosophy in light of materialist dialectics in order to gauge points of convergence and divergence between them and the potential limits of both."

It's a tough body of work to approach, but it is incredibly rewarding.  Heidegger is indispensable and in many ways still ahead of his time.  A lot of conceptual work in the social sciences still lags behind philosophical advancements made by him and his direct and indirect students.

These things definitely happen in the social sciences (especially the 'mainstream') more than in the natural sciences.

This is wrong for two reasons, Chomsky's stances have shifted since new information came to light (The Collection 9/11 came out in 2001), and Chomsky has written much more on the subject. So, it comes across as academically facetious. Then Harris asks for a fair debate, but Chomsky is going into this discussion knowing that Harris has been disingenuous in the past. Chomsky keeps referencing his past writings because he knows Harris has not read them (which would answer every question Harris had).

CriticalTheory,34h5u3,content404,3,Fri May 1 02:50:32 2015 UTC,"Ownership of Information Commodities  Generally speaking the concept of ownership can be broken down into two categories, de facto and de jure.  De facto ownership is having the ability to control how something is used while de jure ownership is having the right to control how something is used.  Although they usually coincide these types of ownership are independent of each other.  It can be shown that de facto ownership of ICs is an exercise in futility and de jure ownership is at best limited to the producer of an IC.  Attempts at de facto ownership of information commodities run directly against the market pressures for more effective media.  Demand for the IC fuels development and/or production of its medium, and the medium has the inherent purpose of making it as easy as possible to obtain the IC.  Once someone has obtained the media containing the IC they have the potential to create an infinite number of that IC.  If everyone has a copy of the IC then the market is saturated and no more exchanges of that IC have any usefulness.  The only way to prevent this is to institute some restrictions on the media which prevent easy duplication, but restricting the use of the medium also restricts the use of the IC.  Those who have purchased the IC find themselves jumping through hoops just to use something which they have already purchased.  This is self defeating, it will create market pressure for alternative media which circumvent the artificial restrictions of the previous media.  Artificial restrictions on media end up being treated in the same way as a technological limitation on media, another obstacle to be overcome in the pursuit of greater access to information.  We are now in an age characterized by a universal media which is quickly rendering all other media obsolete, namely the world wide web.  For any information commodity, once it has reached the web it is impossible to control.  Instances of that IC are distributed across the world in countless computers, making it impossible to restrict who has access to that IC.  This is the most recent development in a long term trend, the history of information media has a clear trajectory towards better access to more information.  The asymptotic limit is unlimited access to all information, at which point any IC is available to anyone at anytime.  At this point the concept of ownership has effectively become obsolete.  This is inherent to information commodities and as such all attempts at de facto ownership are doomed to fail in the long run.  De jure ownership is more subtle since it is a normative question.  Let’s assume that justified transfer of ownership can only come from an equivalent exchange of labor value, i.e. a fair price.  The fact that market exchange values of ICs do not reflect their labor value implies that a market exchange of an IC does not lead to a transfer of justified ownership of that IC.  This result is quite peculiar, particularly if one of the parties in the exchange is the producer.  If anyone can claim ownership of the IC then the producer is certainly one of them but somehow they cannot transfer just ownership of the product of their own labor.  This is because the market exchange of an IC does not represent its labor value, so in almost all circumstances the producer will be underpaid and thus the exchange involves some measure of theft.  If we suppose that the producer is actually paid in full for their labor then we run into further problems.  A chain of singular exchanges between distinct parties, A → B → C → D etc., are a game of hot potato in which each successive person is hoping that they can be paid in full.  Theoretically these appear just but after each exchange the buyer retains the commodity which they have just sold to someone else, essentially they are getting something for nothing.  However if each exchange of the IC is free (i.e. the price is zero) then the people involved are receiving zero labor value for the payment of zero labor value.  These transactions are just since they are fair exchanges but we will still have someone who went uncompensated for their labor value.  How can we have just transfers of ownership if there are so many ways in which at least one of the transfers will be fundamentally unjust?  Selling a stolen good is a form of theft, someone will be exploited no matter what.  This all stems from the fact that the market exchange value of an information commodity does not represent its labor value.  If this were not the case then it would be at least theoretically possible to have just transfers of ownership but the that fact de facto ownership cannot be enforced means that there will still be some kind of theft simply due to the reality of IC markets.  There’s no way to avoid the theft of labor value in an information commodity market.  There are two components of this injustice, the information commodity and the market.  The IC itself is only a commodity when brought to a market, otherwise it would simply be information that is a product of human labor, so the commodity component and the market component are one in the same.  There’s no way that the information product can be the source of injustice, it is an inert amoral ‘object’.  The market however is a human social activity and thus is within the realm of moral criticism.  Given this then it must be the market which is the source of the injustice as it is human activity that will eventually rob someone of the fruits of their labor.  There are many more topics which can be addressed and implications to be explored but here I have attempted to show some of the key properties of information commodities.  The most significant of these being that information commodities have no exchange value, that information media dictate the conditions of an information market, and that ownership of information is inherently problematic.  These and their implications are enough to demonstrate that information markets have many inherent characteristics that are damaging to producers of information commodities and are easily manipulated to unjustly extract labor value from people within the market.  Attempting to fix these problems within a market appears to regenerate the same or create very similar problems.  In effect, solutions to the problems of an information market are self defeating.  As we progress further into the information age these problems will become more and more pronounced, affecting increasingly large numbers of people and contributing to market crises to the detriment of all except an elite few.   If the market itself creates and perpetuates these problems with information commodities then we cannot look to the market to solve them."
CriticalTheory,34h5u3,MagikalGoat,2,Fri May 1 02:50:51 2015 UTC,"1st & foremost: I think you stray from Marx's theory a few times, though I am sure I do as well and I would like to hear about it. It doesn't really hurt your argument -- everything still makes sense -- but I put a few bold marks in red pen on the printout.   You make the claim that ""the exchange value of a commodity is the market (social) perception of the congealed labor bound up in the commodity"" but this is far closer to Ricardo's labor-embodied theory of value than Marx's appeal to socially-necessary abstract labor-time. You clearly understand it -- we can see that through your parenthetical inclusion of 'social' -- but we have to keep in mind that labor is not in the object and that, instead, the object's exchange-value is established by the cost of its reproduction in a given market in an industry with particular productive capacities. That is to say, for Marx when a commodity comes to market its value is derived from the cost it would take to reproduce it given the state of the industries that supply that market. You also state that ""high demand"" is equivalent to ""high use value"" and so far as I understand Marx this is not the case. Use-value is the thing and nothing more. It is a qualitative being, never a quantitative measure. Remember, Marx moves from the comparsion of use-value & exchange-value and then discusses concrete-labor & abstract-labor; these comparisons are both movements from the qualitative to the quantitative. I'm not too sure about this last one, but in making the argument that value is created in exchange (""the market exchange value comes from the labor necessary to convey that SIC, not from the exchange value of the SIC itself"") aren't you aligning yourself with Condillac & Colonel Torrens' claims that ""the exchange of commodities in its developed form, commerce, is productive of surplus-value"" (Capital Chapter 5)? That is, for Marx you are always exchanging equivalents and so whatever profit is made comes from unpaid labor; for Condillac & Torrens the producer is always receiving more than he gives to the consumer, for he has created surplus-value in his mercantile activities. I mean, you're basically saying, ""Well Apple can sell songs that ought have no exchange-value for $.99 because they are creating value when they give it to you."" [someone rebut my point here. i think it has a fault but I can't see it.]     I was going to say that my last point is resolved by the way you recognize that the exchange of info-commodities is fundamentally their reproduction -- that is, exchange does create value insofar as it contains within its process the manufacture of the commodity -- but, again, the info-commodity lacks exchange-value.. so even the reproduction should not posess it. And of course that is what forces you to claim that the exchange is, itself, a commodity that requires labor-time & is thus valuable.  I don't really buy it though. Given the negligible cost of data transmission is a song really worth even $.99? And given bits & bytes as the medium of exchange, shouldn't all data be worth the same? And why would we then have to be ""double dipped"", first by a metered payment to our ISP and then the same amount to the distributor of the commodity? Something here just doesn't fit.    I also cannot stand this idea that an info-commodity can exist in the mind (""can be retained in human memory""), and the related the idea that info-commodities are ""produced by the mind alone."" Simply put, they do not exist until they are made manifest in the physical world through some act of physical labor. When you write a poem in your head it does not exist until you speak it. When you think of a recipe it does not exist until you write it down. But maybe this ought to embolden us to accept this previous point about the conflation of exchange and reproduction: it cannot exist in the mind but only when made manifest in its production in exchange.  And we could then point to your section on The Medium and say, ""it is not just that 'a certain kind of medium is necessary to make use of a particular information commodity' but rather the info-commodity requires a physical medium to exist, be it as vibrating airwaves or bits or text""? --- or could you come back on me and say, ""ahh, but what about neurons""? Maybe I'm an old-fashioned dualist.  I am also a little afraid that you're basically trying to say everything is an info-commodity, e.g. the knowledge of ""how to fix a leaky pipe."" Not only can they be produced in the mind alone, but anything produced by the mind can be an info-commodity? But maybe that is true of physical goods as well, if they are brought to market.  This argument has been quite the winding woodsman's path... but do give me a reply and maybe we can tease more out of it.    Just some things I loved:   non progenitor instance of an SIC   great term. i'll definitely be using (non) progentior, as I had no concise way to talk about the original.   act of bringing it to market negates the labor value of the SIC   cool, though I'd say its mere existence does that.   One of the most commonly cited arguments in favor of free market capitalism is directly undermined by this, namely that the market will efficiently allocate resources to producers according to the usefulness of their labor.   this is so good. this is like Marx finding his tendency of the falling rate of profit: an argument for how, at a fundamental level, capitalism cannot succeed. really good stuff.   Acquiring an SIC which is already possessed does not increase the number of SICs possessed   this is a cool point, but it is unfortunately connected to your fetishization of knowledge, namely that you think it is a commodity. I have two copies of the same song on my computer. They are objects and they are different.   each possessed SIC is simultaneously infinite in number and finitely one   great quote and it can still stand even if one rejects the preceeding quote I mentioned.   If we have a situation where the inventor of an IC has also created a particular medium for it then the income they receive from the sale of the IC is dependent upon the medium   it would be cool to use this point to talk about Software-As-A-Service where platforms are built as the medium of your consumption of information.   If everyone has a copy of the IC then the market is saturated and no more exchanges of that IC have any usefulness.   Yes. Cool point. c.f. Asger Jorn's discussion of Communism as a constant seeking of difference and how the ""quality"" of a commodity decreases the more people have access to an identical commodity.   The asymptotic limit is unlimited access to all information, at which point any IC is available to anyone at any time. At this point the concept of ownership has effectively become obsolete. This is inherent to information commodities as all such attempts at de facto ownership are doomed to fail in the long run   i came. this is communism today imo -- an information commons.    great essay!"
CriticalTheory,34h5u3,MagikalGoat,1 point,Wed May 6 21:09:39 2015 UTC,"I also wrote on information commodities last semester and I think the intersection of these two essays is pretty interesting. I have some comments on yours that I will put in a different top-level post & maybe /r/criticaltheory can help us pick apart the topic.    On Information Commodities & Online Advertising  The Information Commodity  Situated as we are at the beginning of the Third Millennium as the first generation of the Digital Age, there is a certain pressing need to evaluate that which we call the commodity, bringing our understanding of it into line with the realities of digital distribution. We now engage not just with material goods, but hyper-material goods: products which are not formed from atoms but from information, itself. While there is a strong inclination to appeal to the whole material infrastructure that digital access requires (processors, fiber-optic cables, etc., along with the innumerable sites of their manufacture) as the true substrate of digital goods, such a view prevents us from taking a close look at how these goods actually behave within hyperspace, itself. Though one ought not forget that the Internet relies upon the material world and cannot be entirely separated from it, this essay will examine what might be called the ‘information commodity’ or ‘info-commodity’ with the presupposition that a set of information which is robustly communicable and can be consistently resolved into a particular form (by a display driver, a video codec, a web browser, etc.) is, itself, a thing.  This understanding of a digital good is not unfamiliar to us. An everyday good which has been central to the digital market is the MP3 audio file, which can be distributed via the Internet or physical storage devices such as a compact disc, and then be decoded and listened to in precisely the same way no matter what device it is being played on. In essence, we can treat the MP3 file like an object to be used, which is exactly Marx’s definition of the commodity: “The commodity is, first of all, an external object, a thing which through its qualities satisfies human needs of whatever kind” (Marx 125). And it is true: MP3s are brought to the market, bought and sold, much like the favored pedagogical examples of linen or tea. Insofar as the MP3 is a commodity, we can examine its forms of value using the traditional Marxian distinction between ‘use-value’ and ‘exchange-value.’  For Marx, the use-value of the commodity is the thing as such. He writes, “The usefulness of a thing makes it a use-value … It is conditioned by the physical properties of the commodity, and has no existence apart from the latter. It is therefore the physical body of the commodity itself … which is the use-value or useful thing” (Marx 126). It is, then, the set of information and its manifest forms, in our example the MP3 file sitting on the desktop, or perhaps as an attachment in an email, which are the use-value of the information commodity. We double-click the MP3, it loads in our preferred music player, and our need for aural stimulation is satisfied. The useful character or qualitative value of the info-commodity is really no different from the useful character of any physical object. What is much more difficult to apply to the info-commodity is the quantitative form of value, which Marx calls exchange-value or, “the proportion in which use-values of one kind exchange for use-values of another kind” (Marx 126). While we need not explore Marx’s derivation of money as the ‘universal equivalent’ of use-values, we can understand the need to determine where the exchange-value of a commodity comes from -- a fundamental economic question -- and it is here that the difficulty arises.  For Marx’s intellectual predecessor David Ricardo, value was the ‘labor embodied’ in a commodity; that is, the commodity contains within itself some amount of work that was needed to turn raw materials into a final product which guides the quantitative measure of that commodity’s exchange-value, its price. What is so curious about the information commodity is that it takes roughly the same amount of labor to produce one unit of a particular information commodity as it does one hundred units, insofar as copying an info-commodity takes a negligible amount of work. Applying Ricardo’s theory to the MP3, though the original useful thing (perhaps the final mix or ‘Gold master’ of a particular song) may have some amount of work contained within it, each time the file is replicated the total amount of labor embodied by any particular copy decreases. The exchange-value of an information commodity, understood through the embodied labor theory of value, should thus always approach zero and, given enough copies, be considered zero for all practical purposes. Marx offered a slightly different theory of value, namely that the value of a commodity is its ‘socially necessary labor-time’ for reproduction -- the labor-time it would take to produce the object at the moment of sale -- yet it too must consider the exchange-value of an info-commodity to be zero. The moment any particular MP3 is created, the socially necessary labor-time for its (re-)production becomes negligible, and so too does its exchange-value. More broadly, the moment any set of information is created is the moment its becomes valueless.  While such definitions of value from classical economics may be out of fashion today, insofar as the debate over the ontological character of value has become passe, the info-commodity is a prime example of what is called a ‘nonscarce good’ which is widely understood as, “a thing in demand that can be replicated without limit” (Tucker 2010). While scarce goods function according to market logics of supply and demand, the function of which is to distribute a limited amount of goods given a potentially infinite number of human wants, nonscarce goods have a character such that, “there can be no contest over ownership … [and] no need for norms governing their ownership and use” (Tucker 2010). A nonscarce good is thus valueless and so, without relying on any particular theory but rather a general economic principle, we can consider information commodities to be without exchange-value.  Now, despite this quality of everything from MP3s to ebooks to software being valueless, we know that they are commonly sold for a cost, though one far lower than when these goods required some physical medium for distribution (a vinyl record, paper, or a CD-ROM). This is due to the imposition of an artificial constraint, namely that of ‘intellectual property’ (the history of which is fascinating, c.f. Hesse, “The rise of intellectual property, 700 b.c. - a.d. 2000” (2009)). Intellectual property law confers upon the original producer of any info-commodity the right of reproduction, thus preventing the infinite replication of the good and denying it its nonscarce character. This is, however, merely a legal constraint, not an ontological property innate to the information commodity. As music piracy has shown, intellectual property does little to prevent the spread of info-commodities; though there are rare cases of retribution through channels of state power, this constraint does not actually change the nature of the object, itself.  The Advertising Model  In his recent essay, “The Internet’s Original Sin,” Internet start-up veteran Ethan Zuckerman discussed his tenure at Tripod.com, an early “proto-social network,” and the difficulties that he and his team had in monetizing their product:   Over the course of five years, we tried dozens of revenue models, printing out shiny new business plans to sell each one. We’d run as a subscription service! Take a share of revenue when our users bought mutual funds after reading our investment advice! Get paid to bundle a magazine with textbook publishers! Sell T-shirts and other branded merch! At the end of the day, the business model that got us funded was advertising.   While his essay is mostly an apology for the ever-infuriating ‘pop-up ad’ which he invented, it is important because it notes just how early advertising became the “economic foundation of [the Internet] industry.” Indeed, this is because advertising is able to monetize what should really have no value, insofar as webpages are information commodities just like an MP3 or an ebook. While there are certainly material costs of webpages, such as the electricity and storage space it takes to host them, they still fit the definition of a nonscarce good. When loading a webpage, the page “is copied into a memory buffer and sent to another part of the computer, copied again into RAM and sent to the graphics card where it is copied again, and so on;” in essence, “they exist to be copied and can only ever exist as copies” (Warwick 9). What Zuckerman and his team discovered was that it is far easier to monetize something that is actually scarce, namely space on their websites.   Today it is difficult to think of an Internet without ads, with 2014 revenues reaching nearly $45 billion, due in no small part to Zuckerman’s discovery (Interactive Advertising Bureau 2014). By selling a part of the useful thing itself -- a part of the set of information which is nonscarce -- the difficulties of the information commodity’s lack of exchange-value were resolved. What is so fascinating, however, is that the advertising model fundamentally alters the role of the information commodity. Much like how capital investment (M-C-M’) changes the commodity from a good solely meant to fulfill a need into a thing which can produce more money than it took to make, the embedding of advertising into the very form of the info-commodity turns it from a thing which fulfills a need into something which will potentially generate a future sale. By first understanding how online advertising works, we will perhaps be able to more fully understand this transformation in its fullest effects."
CriticalTheory,34h5u3,MagikalGoat,1 point,Wed May 6 19:34:45 2015 UTC,"The Demand Chain  Advertising has two basic purposes. First, it is an attempt to alter the ‘tastes’ or ‘preferences’ of a consumer when they arrive at a market. Coca-Cola’s advertisements, for example, are meant to provoke a decision to purchase their product rather their competitor’s when we sit down for a meal in a restaurant. Second, advertising attempts to move a consumer to the market to make a purchase. A late night infomercial provides its phone number at the bottom of the screen so that we can call them to purchase their product. While these two purposes are rather straightforward, their execution is not always so. Advertisements do not necessarily lead directly to a market, but often advertise other platforms that distribute other advertisements; we can imagine seeing an advertisement for Monday Night Football and changing the channel to ESPN which is playing a car commercial. However, at some point in these advertising changes there must be a suggestion meant to either alter the future choices of a consumer or a direction to come to market in order to purchase a product.  When examining the workings of online advertising it is important to understand how the immediacy of hyperspatial navigation has increased the active role of advertising seeking to the direct a user to a market where a purchase can be made. Exchange, as a social activity, is necessarily predicated on some form of communication, but prior to the Internet either the market was located in a different place than the advertisement, such as a billboard on the highway advertising a local store, or the medium of communication was distinct from the medium of the advertisement, such as catalog mail-orders or infomercial hotlines. Online advertising, on the other hand, exists within the same medium of communication as the markets it advertises and the user may view the advertisement and make a purchase from the same physical location. This collapse of the advertisement and the market into the same (hyper-)space has allowed for the formation of what might be called a ‘demand chain.’ Insofar as websites are connected by hyperlinks, advertisements exist as sponsored channels of movement. This means that online advertising can pursue not only the alteration of the user’s tastes, but the full movement of the user from a search engine (or other web portal) to a store. Like the ESPN example above, each advertisement need not be a direct link to a store, but may instead direct users to other websites which do not have anything for sale; however, somewhere in the great interconnected mesh of webpages with sponsored hyperlinks, there will always be an advertisement which completes the chain by directing the user to a market.  The fact that the internet relies on its configuration as a demand chain to generate revenue from information commodities has real consequences for how the user appears to content creators and advertisers alike. While the utopian dream of the Internet was for a true peer-to-peer environment, focused on the sharing of information, the advertising model proposes that users be conceived as objects which must be convinced to act in a certain way. In something of a dystopian turn, this means that insofar as the qualitative social characteristics of information are obscured by the quantitative measure of the successful direction of the user, the monetized info-commodity mirrors Marx’s famous statement, “It is nothing but the definite social relation between men themselves which assumes here, for them, the fantastic form of a relation between things” (Marx 165). (We should note that, given the existence of non-monetized ‘information commons,’ this transformation has not yet fully taken place. The web 2.0 movement towards quantified metrics such as Likes, +1s, and Reblogs, however, does seem to suggest that we are moving quickly towards the complete objectification of online social relations.)  Advertising Metrics  There are three common metrics used to measure the movement of users from search to sale: 1) Pay-Per-Mille, an advertiser pays for each thousand users that see the advertisement, 2) Pay-Per-Click, an advertiser pays for each click on the advertisement, and 3) Pay-Per-Action, an advertiser pays for each action (such as a sale) that is completed after a link is clicked (sometimes a flat-rate, sometimes as a percentage of the sale). As each of these advertising models measure human activity in a different way, they fulfill different roles in the demand chain and lead to the production of different types of content which best exploit the characteristics of the metric. By understanding these nuances we will come closer to understanding how the monetization of information commodities leads to the commodification of human action, itself.  Info-commodities that are monetized with a Pay-Per-Mille model tend to create what is known as ‘clickbait’ content. Since this measurement of human activity merely measures the number of users to whom the advertisement is displayed, the quality of the content of the information commodity is essentially irrelevant: all that is needed is for the user to load the page which serves the advertisement to the user’s web browser. This often leads to info-commodities with catchy, vulgar, or infuriating headlines which peak the user’s curiosity on a search page or a social media platform. By the time the user learns that he has been duped and that the content is uninteresting, the advertising money has already been made. Recently there have been attempts to develop software which measures not only that the advertisement has been served, but also the number of “attention minutes” that the user spends with the advertisement in sight (Forbes 2014).  The Pay-Per-Click monetization model, on the other hand, demands the user’s engagement with the page long enough to see the advertisement and then decide to move to the page it links to. It is hard to generalize the types of content which are produced to exploit this model, as it is the most common model on the internet (Scott Fox 2011). It is the model used by ad-networks such as Google’s AdSense which use searches and other demographic information to serve advertisements to a particular target audience. However, beyond demographic targeting, the actual quality of the user (whether or not they will purchase a good or click another advertisement after navigating to the new page) is unknown and irrelevant to the host of the info-commodity.  Pay-Per-Action monetization models are exclusively the tool of ‘affiliate marketers’ who host webpages which aim to not only direct users to a market via ‘affiliate links’, but also convince them to make a purchase. As they are not paid to host these links, but rather paid for successful sales, affiliate marketers are the most aggressive advertisers and take on a highly active role in the demand chain. The information commodities monetized by affiliate marketers are often reviews of the products which they are promoting or information associated with a particular ‘niche’ (the most common of which is, interestingly enough, “Internet Marketing/Make Money Online” (Affiliate Summit West 2013)). While Pay-Per-Mille and Pay-Per-Click advertising space is commonly sold by the average webpage owner to recoup hosting costs or earn small amounts of money, the affiliate marketer enacts a strategy of ‘affiliate arbitrage’ and actually purchases these ads in an attempt to increase his web presence and drive more traffic to his high-value affiliate links. So long as the cost of the advertising is lower than the subsequent affiliate pay-outs, the affiliate marketer comes out ahead.  Though there are certainly many smaller actors who use one or more of these methods to monetize their information commodities, the money always flows from the markets themselves, be they specialty stores looking for a larger market base or gigantic retailers with full online catalogues. However, these markets compete first and foremost on search engines. Markets attempt to strengthen their ‘organic’ (unpaid) advertising by optimizing their webpages to Google’s PageRank algorithms, making them appear higher in search results related to their products. By adhering to strict measures laid down by Google such as reaching a minimum amount of content on a page or featuring related keywords, these markets are able to attract the most valued user demographic, namely those users who are already trying to buy something. Curiously, markets often let affiliate marketers use their trademarks (e.g. www.BlacknDecker.com) in order to fill up search results in a tactic called ‘road-blocking’: rather than having Black & Decker’s competitor appear in the search results for “Black & Decker” due to their similarity as tool manufacturers, the results become cluttered with affiliate marketers who will take only a portion of the sale for preventing its loss to the competitor."
CriticalTheory,34h5u3,MagikalGoat,1 point,Wed May 6 19:36:04 2015 UTC,"The Rise of the Vectoralists  In his brilliant work, A Hacker Manifesto, Ken Wark describes the emergence of a new class which exploits information for profit. While the pastorialist class used land for profit, and the capitalist class used commodities for profit, the new vectoralist class understands that information is the newest form of property which can turn money into money-prime. By controlling the ‘vectors,’ ‘flows,’ and ‘stocks’ of information, the Vectoralist class attempts to commodify information, itself. Wark’s text lacks a nuanced economic analysis of the vectoralist, instead satisfying itself with philosophical musings about the ‘hacker class’ whose love of free information might position them as a truly universal class which could pose a meaningful challenge to the bourgeois capitalists and vectoralists alike. Its basic concepts, however, are vital for understanding the mindset of actors in the internet advertising demand chain.  We must understand the vectoralist class not merely as intellectual property magnates who attempt to use state power to enforce copyright law (though there is good reason to see them in this way, too), but as the owners of different information commodities which sit along different vectors from search to store. By controlling potent stocks of information, these vectoralists seek to control the flows not of information, but of users, themselves, through monetized channels of information-access. They seek not the utopian vision of an internet of free communication -- a true information commons -- but instead an internet which only serves to facilitate the sale of goods, populated not by people, but by objects or some kind of memetic-automata. It is a truly dystopic vision, but perhaps one not so different from that of the capitalist, merely updated for the Third Millennium and the Digital Age."
CriticalTheory,34dcvr,self_titled,2,Thu Apr 30 06:11:13 2015 UTC,"If anyone wanted to to find the substance of the conservative ""Cultural Marxism"" claim, it seems to come from Kenneth Minogue's ""Alien Powers: a Pure Theory of Ideology."" Honestly, i have to say that i tend to be attracted towards conceptual systems that seem deliberately shrewd and know how to employ a good catch 22.  Definitely respected the marxist edifice more when i have finished Powers.   In short, Minogue presents an idea of what would be referred to as ""cultural marxism"" several years after it is initially published. It doesn't rely on anti-semitism or conspiracy theories or anything like that. Minogue claims that, throughout the late 19th, and throughout the 20th century, numerous non-economic-class groups understood themselves to be facing repressive situations, and required a theoretical artifice within which to theorize and begin moving against the repressive forces. Minogue claims that those groups who were most successfully at integrated marxists analytical categories and tactics into their repetoire tended to attract more followers and give a sense of identity between their own struggles and the working class movements (Which attracted even more members). The dominant grammar of leftist, primarily workers,  movements was marxism, and various non-workers groups  recognized the powerful doors that could donning the marxist garb could open within leftists circles. Minogue tends to agree with at least onr of the sentences the angry academia.edu guy mentioned as well: minogue saw marxism at its best when applied to certain economic positions, and understand the appropriation of particular categories and tools from the marxist bodies of work as inferior copies of the original. So, whenever you see non-economic, group sized political movements who understand the essence of politics to be zero sum between groups, one of which is in a lowered position and whose emancipation would end the very system of domination (a good number of frminisms, anticolonial practices, anti-racist oractices, just to name a few) you are seeing the legacy of marcism applied to the cultural sohere in work.  Also, i'm sorry about the spelling. My ambien seemed to have kick in as i tried to type. I grew up reading conservative theory, can to this kind of critical tradition a few years ago for a change of pace. If anyone has questions about sources for elements of conservative theory, might be able to help. Night."

The first interesting sentence i found was this one:   To be Black and Muslim is to occupy a space of simultaneous invisibility and hypervisibility.    which is neither profound nor illuminating.   The hypervisibility of Blackness makes one’s identity as a Muslim impossible precisely because Blackness precludes Muslimness in the cultural imaginary.    I live in NYC, and am friends with Muslims and live among African muslim immigrants. This quote is not the case in my experience, as ""black"" African Muslims are a typical presence in NYC, which is not even mentioning the presence of American Black Muslim groups such as NOI or the Five percenters.   So to occupy both subject positions is to experience the downward thrust of cognitive dissonance: you will always be too Black to be a true Muslim, but you must live with all of the pain that America inflicts on both Black people and Muslims.    Who defines themselves based on the prevalent culture? Why would anyone wish to impose this on themselves? I do not find the idea that someone can be ""too black"" to be a true Muslim to be a prevalent concept, and I do not think the author made a convincing case for this idea. The racism inherent in the Middle East and North Africa, where black slavery literally still exists(in mostly Muslim cultures), would be a more apt place to look for this sentiment.  The following was almost interesting, but again it is not a novel idea, nor is it illuminating, nor is it argued for in a convincing way:   How are we to understand ourselves and our social locations, if being Muslim precludes being Black, which cannot be reconciled with being an American subject? The historical and contemporary erasure of Black Muslims can only be situated in the context of a violent anti-Black solidarity; the Black Muslim in America must then contend with an economy of unresolved strivings—towards faith, visibility, resistance, and self determination.   This piece was basically a personal reminiscence with a handful of vague, ungrounded ideas.  What about it do you find illuminating or brilliant?"

In a thought-provoking article co-written by UCLA Professor Khaled Beydoun and Muslim Anti-Racist Collaborative cofounder Margari Hill entitled “The Color of Muslim Mourning,” the authors pointedly ask the Muslim community who they prioritize and why. “Deah’s fundraiser for dental supplies for Syrian refugees went from $20,000 before his death to $380,000. In contrast, Mattan’s family still is struggling to raise $15,000 for his burial costs,” they write.   Or,   How many of us can say the same of Mahdi Hashi, a Somali British national who has been stripped of citizenship and currently rots away in detention in Manhattan after refusing to spy on other Muslims? The Muslim community’s disinterest in his case speaks to the violence of what Frank B. Wilderson has termed “anti-Black solidarity.” Even when protecting his community, Hashi remains invisible.   What about it do you find illuminating or brilliant?   The article could have been written in straight, empirical, sociological terms: Black Muslims are ignored by whites and non-black Muslims alike.  But she went a step further and offered an interpretation of how this disregard actually functions: the simultaneous invisibility (as Muslims) and hypervisibility (as blacks).  Rather than simply accounting some empirical data, she shows how black Muslims, in effect, have no place, or have no given identity, in society."

Most of what was stated in this piece, besides what I cited as interesting, is not novel.   Also, you use your anecdotes to refute her data, and then say ""This piece was basically a personal reminiscence"".   But I am not stating my anecdotes are brilliant critical theory, as you appear to imply of this essay. That is what I am questioning.

In contrast, Mattan’s family still is struggling to raise $15,000 for his burial costs,” they write.   I looked at one article on the mustafa case. It says the motive is not established, which is vastly different then a clearcut and wildly glaring murder of passion, with a culprit, which is the case in the other example:  http://www.ibtimes.com/mustafa-mattan-shooting-muslims-react-murder-canada-ignored-mainstream-media-1815664  the author does not offer evidence as to the motive or circumstances of the mustafa killing, so it would appear unfounded to compare the two as equal.   But she went a step further and offered an interpretation of how this disregard actually functions: the simultaneous invisibility (as Muslims) and hypervisibility (as blacks). Rather than simply accounting some empirical data, she shows how black Muslims, in effect, have no place, or have no given identity, in society.   This is unfounded and she did not give an argument to support it. So Hashi has been in the news- how many middle easterners have been detained on similar charges? ISn't everyone in guantano detained on similar charges? This seems to be a common practice by the US govt and not one specific to ""black"" muslims."

I am saying that there was an outcry over the double murder because it is so obviously an outlandish crime with poignant political and cultural overtones. The second appears to be a random murder, and it is not known if the victim's ""blackness"" or his religion has anything to do with the crime. So it seems pointless to compare the two, except to offer a basis for the writer's thesis, but in fact this specific evidence does not necessarily support her thesis, for the reasons i just stated.   She did give an argument. You even responded to her argument in your post! How did you respond to something that wasn't there?   I meant a convincing argument. Presenting evidence that does not support her thesis is not a convincing argument to me. I will concede this semantic point here. She does present an argument, but it is unconvincing."

And the essay is about how those political and cultural overtones are created.    You agree the difference in the responses to the murders is a matter of culture and politics.

No it's about how she thinks black muslims are hypervisible and invisible at the same time.   You agree the difference in the responses to the murders is a matter of culture and politics.   No I don't!  I stated that the two cases are so different as to not warrant a comparison.  as per the news story i found on the 2nd case, there is no culprit and no motive. Huge difference.

I am a fan of Zizek's philosophical gymnastics concerning various realities and their relationship to ideology, but I often feel that this little clips and soundbites are often blatantly inaccurate, morally irresponsible and are simply cheap and empty shots primarily serving to cause a reaction. However, if I'm wrong, if there is something substantive to the notion that 'political correctness is a more dangerous form of totalitarianism', I would be interested to know."
CriticalTheory,34021y,Ienpw_III,6,Mon Apr 27 11:10:09 2015 UTC,"Well, he gives his answer in the first couple minutes of the video. Not only does political correctness, like totalitarianism, tell you what to do, but unlike totalitarianism it also tells you how you must feel about what you would do.  I'm not sure I buy the argument completely but that seems to be what he's saying."
CriticalTheory,34021y,pappyon,9,Mon Apr 27 13:37:18 2015 UTC,I think he's mixing them up then. It isn't that both tell you what to do and political correctness adds how you must feel i.e. informs morality in some way. Both tell you how you must feel about what you do (let's not pretend that totalitarianism is relaxed about your attitude). But it is only totalitarianism that will tell you what to do. Political correctness is rarely enforced and is usually pluralistic with regards to cultural norms.
CriticalTheory,34021y,burkiish,4,Mon Apr 27 13:48:51 2015 UTC,"Well, that's the thing. Political correctness means you internalize the coercion, rather than someone forcing you. And I don't see that he's trying to make traditional totalitarianism seem more favorable in an objective way, I think he even explicitly says so, but for you as a subject to act against coercion."
CriticalTheory,34021y,pappyon,3,Mon Apr 27 17:04:12 2015 UTC,The title of the video explicitly states that political correctness is more dangerous
CriticalTheory,34021y,burkiish,3,Mon Apr 27 17:56:07 2015 UTC,"For sure, but I don't think his thesis is possible to reduce to a sentence. Anyhow, it's probably just a publicity stunt.   EDIT: Further, If I listen to his full rationale I find hem speaking from the point of view as a subject, not as a political practice. I find this interview with Pasolini to be in line with the argument here when he discusses the impact of fascism contra consumerism on the Italian society, though it touches on a different topic."
CriticalTheory,34021y,Ienpw_III,3,Mon Apr 27 19:34:56 2015 UTC,Agreed. I imagine his response to this point is that political correctness is self-enforced -- he alludes to this in the video and it seems to disturb him.

This relation must always remain unspoken of for it to be ideologically effective, although everyone can be perfectly aware of it. This is what Žižek claims to constitute ideology of daily life. To illustrate, when the first guy stands up and criticizes Stalin, the shocking effect of that statement or meaning thereof rests on the unwritten prohibition of publicly criticizing Stalin, while the second guy renders precisely this prohibition explicit, thus undermining the whole social order. He effectively takes away the possibility to pretend that the prohibition doesn't exist, which is the condition for the smooth functioning of that social order.

CriticalTheory,33eisq,reconrose,2,Wed Apr 22 13:41:16 2015 UTC,"Why have certain parts of the classical (Freudian) theory been dismissed?      Freud was just a man. Like so, he was a product of his time and his own biases. A lot of the now classical theory has been refuted and dismissed, sure enough. But the central thematic remains and has been extensively developed by those after him (Jung, Lacan, Zizek, to name a few). It's long from dead, as it will never cease to be a powerful tool to uncover, what Zizek would call, the unknown knowns of our behavior, i.e. a funny joke pertaining to unconscious and latent behavior.      Why is it still a major force in the zeitgeist?      Because it is arguably one of the boldest theories that haver been elaborated. Besides the bold factor, it also managed to capture the spirit of the times and has permeated society ever since. I advise anyone who is interested in these topics to check ""The Century of the Self"", a documentary that exposes just how widespread this theory has been applied to marketing/corporate culture/mass consumerism/etc. All issues that have been discussed too by critical theorists such as Adorno/Horkheimer (although from a different perspective, ofc). Besides all this richness, it certainly helps explain (like e.g. in your own particular case) a lot of behavior, not just the pathological kind, but specially. Let's not forget that all the major theorists were actually practicing psychiatrists. And according to a lot of them (Freud included) we all share some degree of pathology (in our every day life, there's a famous book with that same name) as well as a society as a whole (see ""Civilization and its Discontents"")."

How is being homonationalist different than any other form socially-organized categorization? It seems to me that being homonationalist is an epestemic position that isn't concrete.   This is her definition of Homonationalism (closely paraphrased) from the video: An Analytic framework to think about state biopolitical production of different populations in relation to one minoritized population to another specifically centering around Homosexuality.  edit: Furthermore she talks about Homonationalism in India and how Gay Marriage is the newest rights-based focus. She cited this as a Colonial assemblage of homonationalist knowledge production."
CriticalTheory,339nb2,rad_q-a-v,1 point,Wed Apr 22 07:44:52 2015 UTC,"Not sure if I can get into the details, but i've spent some time with this topic. I think homonationalism gets the same rep that folks usually attach when they first hear about foucalts formation of biopower. All the early work is focused on the criticism of those topics. But foucalt clarifies that biopower isn't necessarily good or bad, but instead an instrument or tool used to maintain control. E.g. biopower is usually bad, but probably good when used to stop things like rape/ethnic violence. I think in this instance she might particularly be worried about people taking homonationalism=bad as absolute, instead it's something that needs to be constantly looked out for and criticized in its context.  Homonationalism is somewhat epistemological, shaping the way we know the world, but also an ontological issue regarding how queer populations orient towards the nation state and vice versa."

CriticalTheory,32rw4f,Dorindon,17,Thu Apr 16 05:26:19 2015 UTC,"You have to be careful not to confuse a criticism of the theory of evolution and the myth of man.  One cannot really criticize the theory of evolution as being ""anthropocentric"" because it deals with all kinds of evolution- plants and animals.  However! Many people take evolution to mean that we (humans) are (1) the most evolved thing on the planet and (2) the pinnacle of evolution and will not/cannot evolve more. That is the ""myth of man"" and where postmodernists would have their disagreements. What is to say that blue whales are not more evolved? Maybe they are and simply try their best to avoid us asshole humans- or they can understand our language or read our minds but find us quite silly and unimportant. Maybe they have transcended technology and found enlightenment below the waves, choosing a life of peace and feeding off only the smallest, least intelligent creatures of the sea??  Anyway- just a thought.  ...whales are cool."
CriticalTheory,32rw4f,keredomo,12,Thu Apr 16 06:03:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think many who have an understanding of evolution think of humans as being its pinnacle or that human evolution has stopped (although it has been slowed by technology — glasses etc).

CriticalTheory,32rw4f,ReZemblan,6,Thu Apr 16 08:29:53 2015 UTC,"I just kind of made that statement to illustrate the difference between those two concepts, theory vs myth, and I agree with you that those with an understanding of the theory would probably feel we have yet to reach our ""final form"" or if there could ever be one.  I think the main point in attacking the myth (for a critical theorist) is to off-balance the idea that ""people are the best!"" and undermine the kind of logic a general reader might use without realizing it. What kinds of critiques might we have if we picture people as ""animals"" or how might our view of the world change should we try and imagine it not ""for us"" but ""without us?""  Those are just off-the-top-of-my-head (read: weak) examples, but I agree with what you're saying."
CriticalTheory,32rw4f,keredomo,4,Thu Apr 16 09:45:20 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't know if it was Stephen Gould or someone similar but I read a paper back in an animal cognitive science class back in college that was heavily pushing that narrative, and it was an evolutionary biologist.  It was extremely sensational about humanity's achievements through evolution and how being animals that have reflective consciousness makes us the most advanced/powerful compared to the rest of the animal kingdom.  Now maybe this idea is falling out of fashion, but many evolutionary biologists pushed this narrative leading up to the 70s."

You're more likely to find the attitude towards evolution you've mentioned caricatured by critics of evolutionary theory like Mary Midgley, who simply misunderstands ideas like the selfish gene.  Back in 30s and 40s and earlier in the Victorian period, when eugenics was a big thing, you find a lot of writers talking about evolution in those terms, both applying it to the animal world and to social darwinism, but those are discredited ideas and the only people who espouse them these days are crackpots."

CriticalTheory,32rw4f,keredomo,3,Thu Apr 16 06:43:47 2015 UTC,"1- I should rephrase: do some postmodernists contest the fact that we have common ancestors with monkeys. The popular conception of 'descending from' monkeys is scientifically false. Monkeys are just another branch.  2- Is it possible that sometimes postmodernists wrongly interpret the claims of the theory of evolution. I have never heard an anthropologist claim that man was at the center of everything. On the contrary, from the sole perspective of survival, bacteria or cockroaches are much more 'fit' , ie able to withstand environmental challenges. I am using the term environment in a broad sense."

Though I think it's the same thing as #1. I mean, every group has that one person who says, does, or thinks stupid shit. Sometimes those people even get published.  I'd be interested to see the article where this was mentioned just for the context and perhaps to see if they cite any sources for that statement.

CriticalTheory,32rw4f,allhailkodos,9,Thu Apr 16 20:37:34 2015 UTC,"Another problem postmodernists might have concerns how totalizing the theory is: the idea that everything from biology to culture can be explained with one complete metanarrative (because the theory of evolution is more than just a scientific theory, it can also be considered a worldview). This is even truer when you take into account Dawkin's gene-centric interpretation.  In this way postmodernists might view the theory as just another falsely universal and dogmatic metanarrative that must be gotten rid of.  And then in addition to that you have the ""usual"" postmodern-philosophy-of-science debates : can the theory be falsified ? Will it one day be superseded by a better theory ? Can we say that the theory is True or is it just a mere explanation ? Can other forms of knowledge offer different models that are just as valid ?... Some postmodern authors might have answers to these questions that are critical of the theory's validity.  Source : The Theory of Evolution from Darwin to Post-modernism by J.

It's hard to find books that brush such wide sweeping strokes without vulgarizing a few things. It's part of the work of interpretation:  You read it to learn the good stuff and to teach yourself ways to understand why the bad stuff is wrong or not explanative enough.

CriticalTheory,32k17r,YoStephen,7,Tue Apr 14 14:20:27 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  I'm going to take Wikipedia's bit on ""text"" in the context of literary theory since I've not read any actual Derrida (frankly, I'm a bit new to critical theory, and I've heard that his work is formidable to read):   In literary theory, a text is any object that can be ""read,"" whether this object is a work of literature, a street sign, an arrangement of buildings on a city block, or styles of clothing. It is a coherent set of signs that transmits some kind of informative message.[1] This set of symbols is considered in terms of the informative message's content, rather than in terms of its physical form or the medium in which it is represented.   This definition of ""text"" seems problematic. Some visual works are comprised of a sign system with clearly denoted meaning (for example, road markings), and in that sense it can be symbolically ""read"" in the same way as a kind of proto-hieroglyph in order to understand an informative message. However, when it comes to certain visual arts, such as painting, there is not always a clearly denoted symbolic meaning - I might make a marking on the canvas just by accident, or just to see what effect comes from applying the paint in a new way, and to read a symbolic meaning into something like that seems difficult to justify as anything more than mere apophenia. The object may not contain any denoted symbols, and instead, to make sense of the object in a symbolic sense, it requires some amount of translation from its mere physicality into a message.  But let's forget that for a moment, and instead accept that definition of text. Instead, I rephrase my original query:   I've noticed that when it comes to interpreting a work of visual art, what people are often doing is translating what they see into words, and then interpreting not so much the image itself as a verbal translation of the image; so in effect, they are verbally interpreting a verbal interpretation of a visual work.   Even if we accept the visual art object as being a kind of text, it still seems to me that in order to make sense of a work of visual art, people tend to interpret their visual perceptions in a verbal way in order to make sense of the object, and ultimately their critical opinion is comprised of a verbal interpretation of a verbal interpretation of a visual work."

But the fact of the matter is, everything on that site is filtered through a person who may or may not have the right idea.   I empathize with your decision to defer though. Why bother muddling though dense philosophical writing when the there is already a long tradition of scholarship? (serious) Your understanding of someone like Kant, for example, is probably just as well informed by actually reading him as it would be by reading a critique of Critique of Pure Reason. (hehe)   I get that this is a casual conversation but that's not reason to actually BE a casual. Nahmean?  As for your actual comment on text and reading, if I may weigh in. I think the etymological frame you want to approach ""read"" is more like read into than literally having information conferred onto you by known symbols. The fact that there is a visual work at all is something that can be read into just as well as the work itself can be read. Like you say, it comes down to interpretation which I think is compelling.

CriticalTheory,32gfzx,amitpop,18,Mon Apr 13 16:25:16 2015 UTC,"That's because ""post-race"" is not an argued position. Anyone who actually thinks about it knows that it is an untenable claim. It is, rather, an ideological resource that certain kinds of people draw on in order to not have to take race into account. It is ideological because ""unthought,"" and it is really at the service of cementing racial disparity under the sign of its imagined irrelevance as a factor in contemporary American life. It is a deeply conservative belief (bordering in many cases on actual racism) masking as social progressiveness. It's the attempt to conjure away social inequity by imagining that is doesn't exist, and then patting yourself on your back. So I think that your paper shouldn't be about ""post-race"" as an ""argument,"" but about the work post-race rhetoric does in the context of American society/politics. I think you'll be able to find lots of good analysis on Obama's election, for instance, that interrogate these issues in depth."

Very rich terrain there build from Chief Justice Roberts's assertation that ""if you want to stop discriminating against race in America you have to stop discriminating against race in America."" You'll find tons of good stuff around this and it'll be fresh.  Another place to start would be Fukuyama's The Ends of History and the Last Man. Lots of push back against this from many sources as he's advocating in a roundabout way for ""post-race""; another good place to start research for those in favor and against.  Walter Benn Michaels work might be fruitful, as he is arguing not that we're post-race but for a push to focus more on class rather than identitarian politics. It's absolutely more nuanced than that, but might again help as a platform for your research.  Finally, re-thinking your thesis a touch and reapproaching ""post-race"" as a form of advocating for a ""non-politcal"" stance which disavows race might be useful. In such regard, non-political to spontaneous consent of current racial norms (or post-race as an issue) will need to be unpacked, but I think this move could land in a larger paper (and you could use that great Roberts quote as an epigraph, as not talking about race condones the current racial landscape and mirrors Roberts position)."

CriticalTheory,31wjd7,Pringlecks,19,Thu Apr 9 16:28:51 2015 UTC,"This was not Peter Sloterdijk's finest hour, nor indeed his clearest or most rational engagement with critical theory. The context was a lecture Sloterdijk had given at a place called Elmau in 1999, in which for some members of his audience, amongst them Jürgen Habermas, he had seemed to interpret Heidegger’s ""Letter on humanism"" to approve of eugenics (which was advocated by the Nazis, the crucial background to all of this) and had at the very least not suggested that he had any problem with that. (So two questions were mixed up with each other: was Heidegger really advocating a programme of eugenics like that the Nazis had wanted to establish, and what exactly was Sloterdijk's attitude to such an—admittedly entirely theoretical—programme?) Habermas in any case felt that this was an attempt on the part of a currently fashionable philosopher to rehabilitate national-socialist thought, and leaked the text of the lecture, which had not (as far as I'm aware) been public, to a couple of journalists at major German newspapers, apparently (although this may be pure defamation on Sloterdijk's part) with the suggestion that they paint it in the worst possible colours.  The linked article is Sloterdijk's reply to the articles that were then written. It is polemical, personal, and almost hysterical in tone (in my view; other readers may have different opinions about this). Habermas is accused of having talked about Sloterdijk behind his back, in crass contradiction to his theory of open and rational communication, and thereby having turned Sloterdijk into an object, a mere commodity (with an unmistakeable allusion to the famous passage of Das Kapital where the commodity begins to talk). Sloterdijk subsequently identifies himself with the 19th century German author Heinrich Heine, a major figure in German literature (not selling himself too short here), in order then to claim that, having taken a step back from the whole debate, he can now see die kritische Theorie in its true colours: as a kind of pleasant, poetic fiction, a liberal mask, behind which a kind of Jacobine power politics, supported by the mass media, has hidden its true countenance. ""Critical theory died on this 2nd of September [1999]"", writes Sloterdijk, the day the second of the two allegedly Habermas-inspired newspaper articles about the lecture appeared.  This of course does not answer the question put to us by the op, which has its own validity and interest, and to which I would love to read a thoughtful answer. But I think that Sloterdijk is the wrong partner for such a conversation. To me, far from being a real contribution to the necessary and necessarily ongoing discussion about the current liveliness and importance of critical theory, this was a cheap ad hominem response to a personal scandal. Since 1999, Sloterdijk has been on my list of thinkers I can no longer take entirely seriously. It may be, as another redditor has suggested, that Spheres is one of the greatest works of philosophy out there; since this foolishness, however, my interest in finding out has diminished significantly."

Do you by any chance have more details on the Sloterdijk lecture?  I'm just curious as to what sections from Letter on Humanism he may have been referring to.

CriticalTheory,31lah8,Klaus_Rother,10,Mon Apr 6 14:59:52 2015 UTC,"Ok, well I'm going to attempt another vulgar generalization like the other poster.  Hope it isn't too horrible.  It's a really stupid distinction to be honest, and it started as a political crisis within the ""Academy.""  So in the early 1900s, a lot of post-Kantian thinking was catching strides and the foremost ""respected"" movement within the British Isles was Logical Postivism (not enough time to go into explaining that).  Empiricists latched onto Logical Positivism and basically wanted to end ""metaphysics"" (I use scare quotes because a lot of them had extremely vulgar conceptions of what metaphysics is).  So the major dogma was that philosophy was a tool to help science better understand the world and that more or less the main goal was to get sharper definitions of language to further understand some fixed and linear conception of the world.  Progress was predicated on getting a more lucid conception of the world through empiricism, and the Kantian notion of a separation between the subject's mind and the ""thing in itself"" (or reality as it is to ""itself) was being abandoned by many.  So along with this there were a lot of post-Hegelian thinkers like Nietzsche, Heidegger, Scheler, Sartre, etc. who more or less focused on ontology and the minimum conditions for us having access to a world beyond the subject (which for Heidegger was unearthing presuppositions in systems of thinking, which was the groundwork for deconstruction, not the bastardized vulgar attempt the author of OP's article is making).  So metaphysics was still ""attacked"" by these thinkers, but they were still interested in the question of Being (Nietzsche in a more in-direct way; trying to generalize without being vulgar here) and man's existential relation to the world.  What is truth?  How do we form meaning? etc. etc.  Well, in a lot of the same fashion as the author of OP's article, people like Bertrand Russell and his cronies who were empiricists and positivists saw work like Heidegger's and because of it creating a system with its own technical language to elucidate extremely complex and abstract ideas, passed Heidegger and others within that ""tradition"" as being bullshit and ""non-critical"".  So in political fashion, they sought to differentiate themselves from the existentialist bogey-man and lumped all of that work and it's cousins into the name ""Continental"" (meaning, of the continent of Europe, i.e. Germany, Italy, France, but not our loving and pure British Isles like the Queen's Great Britain...)   So American and British philosophy focused itself on the stylistic tendencies of the empricists/positivists who actively hated the post-Nietzschean/Hegelian philosophy of greater Europe and called itself ""analytic"" to imply it was more rigorous by default and more aligned with science.  Well the last 80 years or so have proven how contingent and politically charged that distinction was in the first place.  Many thinkers draw from both traditions and many continental thinkers (particularly Heidegger and Merleu Ponty) were very very rigorous AND used science and logic quite often.    So really, this article OP posted is indicative of the existential panic that dogmatic empiricists go through when they're confronted with more expansive and pluralistic academic work:  they refuse to actually read it, make every effort to prove why it's either flat out contradictory or purposefully meaningless, and then pat themselves on the back for how great and untarnished their narrative of the world is and why the other departments need to be unfunded and disappear already.  Before somebody jumps me for making a biased account of the history (yeah I'll be honest about nasty politics when it sways farther in one direction...), I studied analytic philosophy MORE THAN continental in college, even though I'm more of an expert on Heidegger/Nietzsche than I am standard analytic philosophy.  At this point it's mostly just a distinction in style, with a lot (not all) of analytic philosophy attempting to strip debates down to as simple of terms as possible assuming that most questions are just the result of ""confusions.""  Well, a lot of continental thinkers would argue that the words we use to frame questions themselves are loaded with assumptions and presuppositions that have been formed by historical and political contingency, thus the way to understand the world is to un-pack (or, ""bracket"" as the founder of phenomenology said) the language and discourse itself. Deconstruction is basically the practice of de-situating terms within a text or a ""system"" that establish the relational meaning of everything within that text or system.  If words that establish relational meaning have a fluid definition over time, then there is no absolute thing in reality that we signify with those words.  Some form of a gap (this is hard to say since it's something most thinkers disagree on, huge point of contention) between the subject and the world is in tact, although for many many many more reasons than this vulgar generalization has time to account for.  And because these assumptions into some linearity in progress and language have real effects on the living world as we inhabit it (as in, some groups of people get labeled as ""other"" based on inherited words and ideologies that aren't rigorously confronted or ""bracketed""), many continental thinkers these days jump into questions of identity, gender, politics, etc.   The idea from a lot of them, definitely not all, is that we need to slow down with how we approach philosophical questions and basically deconstruct the questions themselves.  The extreme version of this is ""post-modernism"" (not everyone agrees on a definitno of this movement) where the idea of any ""narrative"" or ""system"" as accounting for the world is impossible because the fluidity of language means the narratives and systems will always at some point contradict themselves.  The discourse gets extremely complex, hence why these thinkers often invent words since normal language lacks the tools to quickly elucidate these ideas to people who already understand the basics and want to go further with it.  The ""word salad"" is as necessary in this field as it is in literally any academic or scientific field, the only reason we get so much shit for it is that we're not ""a science."""

It is extremely unfair to expect this work to be approachable to anyone.  I studied physics but yet I still don't understand quantum mechanics.  Well, it's because I haven't taken years of physics, learned relativity, etc., taken higher level calculus, and spent the time and energy that everyone who engages in higher level physics has done to be where they are today.  For some reason people think philosophy should be different.  It's not, it has existed as a specialized and technical field long before the current sciences took form.  We're talking about over 2,000 years of history just to understand basic contemporary philosophy.  It is a specialized field like any other and it takes a shit ton of time, patience, and studying to reach the level of having a non-vulgar understanding of something as complex as Heideggerian ontology or post-structuralism.  Also don't feel bad or assume I'm using you in these examples, I'm not.  These are just extremely common things I have to respond to in my every day life any time someone finds out I studied philosophy.  Everyone seems to think they're a philosopher as long as they have opinions about the world and their place in it, but yet not everyone runs around calling themselves scientists just because they used a control variable to figure out the best sweetener to make a cake...

It's just, in my particular field of study, I can direct a layperson to one or two books that will at least give them a general understanding of the field, even if they aren't able to engage in the complex methodologies used to derive the foundational premises.  I guess what makes me frustrated with my attempts to engage with critical theory, and specifically continental philosophy (I don't have the same trouble with analytical, it seems) i'm simply told that it takes years of study to understand. I'm not asking to be an expert in the continental school, I just want to under stand where you all are coming from.  Edit: i'll clarify: I'm no evolutionary biologist, but when I read ""The Selfish Gene"" by Richard Dawkins, I was given insight into the field that, and I should emphasize here, left me still a layperson, but an informed layperson. Similarly, a person might read ""Nudge"" by Richard Thaler and get a pretty good example of how my field of behavioral economics works.

CriticalTheory,31lah8,bluebluebluered,2,Tue Apr 7 00:07:21 2015 UTC,"There are a huge variety of books and articles that give clear and precise introductions into major thinkers. Don't listen to those who say you need years of study to understand it. All you need is a healthy interest in what the ideas are trying to say. For example, if you read the routledge guide to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason it will make the original text - which is virtually impossible to read beginning to end - a hell of a lot easier.   For specifically continental theorists like Foucault, Satre, Deleuze, or Derrida I would recommend reading articles on Stanford or listening to some lectures that are meant for undergrads on youtube, there are plenty if you look hard enough. From there moving on to some of the shorter easier texts shouldn't be too much of a problem - or at least reading some commentaries on the original texts.  Basically try not to be put off by the 'world-salad', it doesn't have to take years to learn how to read it but it does take a little bit of effort. I personally find it much more enjoyable than reading a lot of analytic philosophy. Some authors read much more like poetry or literature than like maths."

Not trying to antagonize you and your studies (I am lightly studying in economics, focused on theory, hence why I know the silliness of behavioral's origins), just trying to say it seems a lot easier to catch up to modern behavioral than any type of modern philosophy that isn't the trolley problem. Meanwhile evolutionary biology is at least Darwin-old and has enough sub-fields (paleontology, geology, population statistics, and environmental studies) that I absolutely concede the ineffability of legit evolutionary biology (and not the simplistic stuff you get in high school) to the layman."
CriticalTheory,31lah8,Klaus_Rother,1 point,Tue Apr 7 02:00:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah sure buddy, let me so how I can get you started.  I should be more careful and say it like this:  if you want to get to a level of understanding some of the tropes that people like OP and the author of OP's article like to brandish off as nonsense or as OP called it ""masturabatory,"" it takes much more work, because it's more recent contemporary work that feeds off phenomenology (which itself is difficult) and requires a nuanced view of Kant AND Hegel.  But don't let that stop you!  Even if you want to understand the ramifications of deconstruction on media and art in their effects on the every day world at some point in the future, you can get a basic understanding of some of it as you slowly move forward.  So basically what I'd recommend is buying a book like Will Durant's 'Story of Philosophy.'  It will give you a quick and basic overview of the history of western philosophy and will primer you with the fundamental terms like metaphysics, ontology, platonism, empiricism, a priori, etc. etc.  So if you read a book like that, then you'll be roughly current up to about 1900, at least at a beginner level.  That's when I'd pick up a book like this one http://www.amazon.com/Existentialism-Writings-Second-Charles-Guignon/dp/0872205959/ref=sr_1_14?ie=UTF8&qid=1428368006&sr=8-14&keywords=existentialism  That books is where my journey started.  I read that as a freshman in college, it taught me A LOT.  That will give you a primer on existentialism, which is the tradition I'd start with in continental (it's easier to grasp, and one of the earliest).  For better understanding of the terms outside the individual readings, these books are usually decent http://www.amazon.com/Existentialism-Short-Introduction-Thomas-Flynn/dp/0192804286/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1428368006&sr=8-5&keywords=existentialism  Once you've gotten that far, then I'd try to tackle phenomenology.  It's probably the most important contribution from continental philosophy, and in a lot of ways it never ended, it just morphed into new approaches that are in many respects children of the original ""method.""  So for instance, if you read some of the Heidegger in the first book I sent you, I'd then go read the Heidegger wikipedia page for some extremely brief background.  Try to get some really quick primers on his differences between his teacher Husserl who is the ""father of phenomenology."" [the most important take away here is to understand how Heidegger believed he ""overcame Descartes"" and how he believed Husserl didn't, and then how that created Heidegger's own approach, which is pretty much the godfather of all recent continental philosophy, i.e. rejecting the Cartesian starting point]  Then checkout plato.stanford.edu (it's Stanford's huge encyclopedia of philsoophy).  try to read the Heidegger entry and if you start understanding some of it, then bingo, you're making serious progress.  And then from there you have so many avenues to choose from.  Then you could read some Foucault, Derrida, Badiou, Zizek (more of personality than a rigorous thinker, but he still has some important ideas that he shares with many other thinkers), Boudrillard, Sloterdijk, etc.  I'd even recommend reading more of those ""Very Short Introduction of...."" books from Oxford.  If the author is good, they end up being great (just always check reviews first, some of them for other disciplines aren't as good).  And you could find some on post-modernism and post-structuralism, and they'd give you a basic idea of what they mean, and with all of your new-found background in philosophy, you'd be able to make connections with it and have much broader understanding of it than a ""layperson,"" even if you can't get into graduate level arguments as to whether Derrida's method of deconstruction betrays Heidegger's de-struction or whether or not 'the ontological difference' dooms humanity from ever having absolute signifiers in the world.  But at the end of the day, you don't need to worry about graduate level discussions unless you want to be a dick with a superiority complex on the internet and brandish off 200 years of complex academic work as ""masturbatory"" and ""rarely actionable"" while conveniently failing to provide even one example for why that work is as bad as you say it is....  haha but I digress.  Please man, let me know if there is any more help or any more resources I can point you to, I would love to do as much as I can!  I had so many great older students that helped me over the years and I feel indebted to their help."

That's beyond insulting, I could write a fucking paper and have it done by the end of the week with pages of extremely applicable aspects of continental philosophy as they relate to every day life.  It doesn't fucking end.  Whereas most of analytic philosophy in it's cross-over is more applicable to science than every day life, so in that regard, if it's from the layman's perspective, there's nothing actionable from a large portion of analytic philosophy for his individual life.  But I'm done fighting with someone who clearly has never studied any of this.

It's almost like sometimes people like to use certain words ('read,' 'text') when referencing less-definitive things.  Ex.  ""I'm reading too much into this.""

You, and most people in this thread, know (or are capable of knowing) that the signifiers used in math and STEM fields aren't equivalent to the language used in critical theory - and that there are fundamental differences in the types of ideas referenced by a ""theta"" or ""X"" symbol in a physics equation and the types of ideas referenced by calling something the ""other"" or referencing ""modes of capital production"" in critical theory.  The value of STEM fields is their ability to create airplanes, medicines, or machines, as you say.  The value of a Judith Butler essay is helping people understand where our ideas about human sexuality come from and how those ideas may be irrationally harmful to other humans - one field is addressing existence outside the human construct and the other is addressing problems within human construction (obviously there are exceptions but you see where I'm going).  Both fields involve learning multiple layers of ideas and putting them together - to get a rocket to fly you need to understand gravity, wind resistance, propulsion, etcetera, and to understand human sexuality you need to understand the context of language, the history of social regard for sexuality, media influence, etcetera - the difference is that one of those structures exists regardless of what you believe.  Even when you're talking to people in critical theory who understand the terms as you do - their opinion as to the influence of media on sexual identity will likely be informed by their own experience, as is a large portion of critical theory.  This seems to be taken for granted by a lot of critical theorists, however, who use phrases like ""the ontology of the photographic image"" to mean something concrete when it really means something informed by individual experience.  The result is people talking at each other, not really exchanging ideas.  At best you take the language someone else uses and replace it with your own ideas about human experience and have an internal exchange of ideas.  In reference to my original comment - that's exactly what this thread and every other thread criticizing the verbosity of critical theory is - people talking at each other (virtual brick walls)."

CriticalTheory,308y7n,postmoderno,9,Wed Mar 25 13:11:08 2015 UTC,"Here it is amigos. I'll start with the first part, I'll put the rest later. I have to catch a plane!  FREDRIC JAMESON THE AESTHETICS OF SINGULARITY An ontology of the present is a science-fictional operation, in which a cosmonaut lands on a planet full of sentient, intelligent, alien beings. He tries to understand their peculiar habits: for example, their philosophers are obsessed by numerology and the being of the one and the two, while their novelists write complex narratives about the impossibility of narrating anything; their politicians meanwhile, all drawn from the wealthiest classes, publicly debate the problem of making more money by reducing the spending of the poor. It is a world which does not require a Brechtian V-effect since it is already objectively estranged. The cosmonaut, stranded for an unforeseeable period on this planet owing to faulty technology (incomprehensibility of set theory or mathemes, ignorance of computer programmes or digitality, insensibility towards hip-hop, Twitter, or bitcoins), wonders how one could ever understand what is by definition radically other; until he meets a wise old alien economist who explains that not only are the races of the two planets related, but that this one is in fact simply a later stage of his own socio-economic system (capitalism), which he was brought up to think of in two stages, whereas he has here found a third one, both different and the same. Ah, he cries, now I finally understand: this is the dialectic! Now I can write my report! Any ontology of the present needs to be an ideological analysis as well as a phenomenological description; and as an approach to the cultural logic of a mode of production, or even of one of its stages—such as our moment of postmodernity, late capitalism, globalization, is—it needs to be historical as well (and historically and economically comparatist). This sounds complicated, and it is easier to say what such an approach should not be: it should not, for one thing, be structurally or philosophically neutral, on the order of Kosselek’s influential description of historical temporalities. But it should also not be psychological, on the order of the culture critique, which is designed to elicit moralizing judgements on the diagnosis of ‘our time’, whether that time is national or universal, as in denunciations of the so-called culture of narcissism, the me-generation, the ‘organization man’ of a somewhat earlier stage of capitalist institutionalization and bureaucratization, or the culture of consumption and consumerism of our own time, stigmatized as an addiction or a societal bulimia. All these features are no doubt valid as impressionistic sketches; but on the one hand, they thematize reified features of a much more complicated social totality, and on the other, they demand functional interpretation in order to be grasped from an ideological perspective."
CriticalTheory,308y7n,keredomo,3,Wed Mar 25 19:00:21 2015 UTC,"So I am anxious that the account of temporality I want to offer here not be understood as one more moralizing and psychologizing critique of our culture; and also that the philosophical thematics I am working with here—that of time and temporality—not itself be reified into the fundamental level of how a culture operates. Indeed, the very word culture presents a danger, insofar as it presupposes some separate and semi-autonomous space in the social totality which can be examined by itself and then somehow reconnected with other spaces, such as the economic (or indeed such as ‘space’ itself). The advantage of a notion like ‘mode of production’ was that it suggested that all such thematizations were merely aspects or differing and alternate approaches to a social totality which can never be fully represented; or, better still, whose description and analysis always require the accompaniment of a warning about the dilemmas of representation as such. Meanwhile, of course, the very term ‘mode of production’ has itself been criticized as being ‘productivist’, a reproach which, whatever misunderstandings or bad faith it may reflect, has the merit of reminding us that linguistic reification as an inevitable process can never definitively be overcome, and that one of our fundamental problems as intellectuals is that of redescription in a new language which nonetheless marks its relationship and kinship with a specific terminological tradition, in this case Marxism. So my thoughts on temporality here invite all kinds of misunderstandings, not least in sharing features with slogans that have been influential in other national situations as well. In France, for example, the concept of presentism, le présentisme, has become widespread since its coinage by François Hartog; while in Germany, Karl Heinz Bohrer’s notion of suddenness and the ‘ecstatic moment’ of the present, a good deal more aesthetic and philosophical than cultural, is no doubt a related thought, which should be placed in perspective by the awareness that socially West Germany (I still call it that) is a good deal more conservative developmentally than France or the United States. [1] Far subtler than any of these slogans are the analyses of Jean-François Lyotard, whose conception of postmodernism—the supersession of historical storytelling by ephemeral language-games—already moved in the direction of a concept of presentism. His final work on the sublime sharpened this focus in an even more interesting way: for he proposed to add temporality to Kant’s description of the sublime and to describe it as a present of shock, which arouses a waiting or anticipatory stance that nothing follows. [2] This is an apt formalization of revolutionary disillusionment—in many ways Lyotard became the very philosopher and theoretician of such disillusionment—and certainly has its relevance to our own moment; but it also illustrates the kind of ideological effect that thematization—in this case, an insistence on temporality—can produce. But as the terms postmodernism and postmodernity have been abundantly criticized over the years, and have perhaps, in the rapid obsolescence of intellectual culture today, come to seem old-fashioned and out-of-date, I need to say a word about their place in my own work and why I still feel they are indispensable."
CriticalTheory,308y7n,bedoot,3,Wed Mar 25 19:00:45 2015 UTC,"Postmodernity and globalization My theories of postmodernism were first developed in China, when I taught for a semester at Peking University in 1985; at that time, it was clear that there was a turn in all the arts away from the modernist tradition, which had become orthodoxy in the art world and the university, thereby forfeiting its innovative and indeed subversive power. This is not to say that the newer art—in architecture, in music, in literature, in the visual arts—did not aim at being less serious, less socially and politically ambitious, more user-friendly and entertaining; in short, for its modernist critics, more frivolous and trivial, even more commercial, than the older kind. That moment—of the art that followed the demise of modernism—is by now long past; but it is still that general style, in the arts, that people refer to when they tell you that postmodernism is over and done with. There is now, to be sure, something called postmodern philosophy (we’ll come back to it) and even, as a separate genre, the ‘postmodern novel’; but the arts have since become far more political; and insofar as the word postmodernism designated an artistic style as such, it has certainly become outmoded in the thirty years since I first used the term. Yet I soon became aware that the word I should have used was not postmodernism but rather postmodernity: for I had in mind not a style but a historical period, one in which all kinds of things, from economics to politics, from the arts to technology, from daily life to international relations, had changed for good. Modernity, in the sense of modernization and progress, or telos, was now definitively over; and what I tried to do, along with many others, working with different terminologies no doubt, was to explore the shape of the new historical period we had begun to enter around 1980. But after my initial work on what I would now call postmodernity, a new word began to appear, and I realized that this new term was what had been missing from my original description. The word, along with its new reality, was globalization; and I began to realize that it was globalization that formed, as it were, the substructure of postmodernity, and constituted the economic base of which, in the largest sense, postmodernity was the superstructure. The hypothesis, at that point, was that globalization was a new stage of capitalism, a third stage, which followed upon that second stage of capitalism identified by Lenin as the stage of monopoly and imperialism—and which, while remaining capitalism, had fundamental structural differences from the stage that preceded it, if only because capitalism now functioned on a global scale, unparalleled in its history. You will have understood that the culture of that earlier imperialist stage was, according to my theory, what we call modernity; and that postmodernity then becomes a kind of new global culture corresponding to globalization. Meanwhile, it seems evident that this new expansion of capitalism around the world would not have been possible without the degeneration and subsequent disappearance of the Soviet system, and the abdication of the socialist parties which accompanied it, leaving the door open for a deregulated capitalism without any opposition or effective checks. At the same time, the political, social and economic project of modernization which held sway in the twentieth century, organized around the construction of heavy industry, can no longer be the aim and ideal of a production based on information and on computer technology. A new kind of production is emerging, whose ultimate possibilities we do not yet fully understand; and hopefully the interrogation of the culture of postmodernity, taking the word culture in its broadest acceptation, will be of some use in exploring this new moment in which we all live."
CriticalTheory,308y7n,shreekingeels,3,Wed Mar 25 19:01:13 2015 UTC,"Time’s presents  In my first descriptions of the postmodern (which I do not at all repudiate), I described the transition from the modern to the postmodern in terms of an increasing predominance of space over time. The classics of modernism were obsessed, in some profound and productive sense, with time as such, with deep time, with memory, with duration (or the Bergsonian durée), even with the eternal dawn-to-dusk of Joyce’s Bloomsday. I suggested that with the new primacy of architecture in the arts, and that of geography in economics, the new dominant of postmodernity was to be found in space itself, the temporal sinking to a subordinate feature of space as such. But this perhaps paradoxical assertion obliges me to return to time and temporality, in order to say what a time subordinated to space might look like, and what a spatial temporality might entail.  In an earlier essay, entitled ‘The End of Temporality’, I sketched in something like a popular or mass-cultural experience, not so much of the abolition of time altogether, as rather its shrinkage to the present. Using contemporary action films as a symptom, I pointed out that nowadays they are reduced to a series of explosive presents of time, with the ostensible plot now little more than an excuse and a filler, a string on which to thread these pearls which are the exclusive centre of our interest: at that point the trailer or preview is often enough, as it offers the high points of films which are essentially nothing but high points. [3] Here, at any rate, I would like to deal with this phenomenon—which I call the reduction to the present or the reduction to the body—in a more serious, or at least a more philosophical way; and I propose to characterize such temporal developments as they appear in the realm of the aesthetic and of taste, in that of economics, in those of concepts and social phenomenology, and finally in the realm of the political itself.  But I must first enter a warning about all the fields I have mentioned, which correspond to the various academic disciplines, all of which seem to me outmoded in the new circumstances of postmodernity and globalization. In my earlier work on postmodernism I identified a phenomenon I called pastiche, suggesting that it had become a major mode of postmodernism in the arts: the simulation of the past and its dead styles, a little like Borges’s Pierre Menard copying Don Quixote word for word three centuries later, or those photographs of Sherrie Levine that offer identical copies of famous photographs of past masters as new works. For as a kind of final turn of the screw, postmodern pastiche extends to modernism itself, and a few contemporary artists seem to return to the religion of art to produce works whose aesthetic is still that of the modern period—I think above all of filmmakers like Sokurov, Gherman, Elice, Tarr and others; the literary pastiches of the modern are much less interesting.  But far more important, in my opinion, is the regression to modernist theory in the mode of such pastiche; and here the revival turns on the very idea of the modern itself. For in the thick of postmodernity, it is a statistical fact that more than ever political and cultural commentators have returned to the ideal of modernity as something the West can successfully offer the underdeveloped parts of the world (euphemistically called ‘the emerging markets’) at a moment when modernization itself is clearly as obsolete as the dinosaur. For modernization, offered by the Americans and the Soviets alike in their foreign aid programmes, was posited on heavy industry, and has little relevance in an era in which production, profoundly modified by information technology and relocation, has undergone its own postmodern turn.  So I hope that we may avoid the now antiquated debates on modernity and in particular on modern art, which have generated new revivals, on the mode of pastiche, of that older sub-discipline of philosophy called aesthetics, itself virtually extinct in the era in which genuine modernism in the arts was pioneered and developed. There are two ways of grasping the meaning of aesthetics as a disciplinary term: either as the science of the beautiful, or as the system of the fine arts. The beautiful, which was able to be a subversive category in the late nineteenth century—the age of the industrial slum, in the hands of Ruskin and Morris, Oscar Wilde, the symbolists and the decadents, the fin de siècle—has in my opinion, in the age of images, lost all power either as an effect or an ideal. As for the system of fine arts, it has in postmodernity imploded, the arts folding back on each other in new symbioses, a whole new de-differentiation of culture which renders the very concept of art as a universal activity problematic, as we shall see; my title is therefore pointedly ironic. If the dilemma of an older aesthetics lay in history and in the historicity of the modern arts, that of the present is problematized by singularity itself. This is then what I want to begin with, before passing in review a number of other topics—the economic, the social, the political—in the light afforded by some new conception of postmodernity which takes into account globalization and singularity alike."

CriticalTheory,2zoyms,benjamincarpenter,26,Fri Mar 20 12:30:51 2015 UTC,"I'm going to assume you were referring to aestheticizing politics roughly in the way Benjamin refers to aestheticizing politics in The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.   The argument goes like this: the development of new technology creates a new mode of perception for people: namely, that of the mass. Now, because art is completely mass-reproducible (e.g. through film, TV, the Internet) the same art object may be experienced by humanity as a collective. Indeed, the art object itself begins to produce its viewers as participants in a collectivity. It's quite obvious that these new forms of art allow us to live out fantasies in content (e.g. movies about the underdog, about superheroes imposing justice and order, romantic fantasies, etc.) — Benjamin's insight is that they also produce fantasies by merit of their form. That is, mass-reproducible art makes you feel like you're part of a collective because its mass-accessible, each piece is seen from a single audiovisual perspective, and so on.   But this creates a contradiction between the fantasies of solidarity and collectivity produced by the art, on the one hand, and the reality of a fractured, alienating, and exploitative social sphere on the other. He highlights two possible responses to this contradiction: politicizing the aesthetic and aestheticizing the political. The former involves the analysis and use of art/aesthetic objects for a politics of mass solidarity, e.g. abolishing exploitative capitalist labor relations. So, we intentionally use art as a weapon for bringing about social change by harnessing the way in which it produces a collectivity. The latter, what you refer to, involves projecting the fantasies of solidarity and collectivity onto the social sphere as though its contradictions were already resolved. That is, the fascist response to the new mass media is to mask the existing contradictions of capitalism at the level of ideology while ignoring the contradictions at the level of the political and economic system.  This is the primary example Benjamin provides of the aestheticization of politics (quoted from Marinetti):   “For twenty-seven years we Futurists have rebelled against the branding of war as anti-aesthetic ... Accordingly we state:... War is beautiful because it establishes man’s dominion over the subjugated machinery by means of gas masks, terrifying megaphones, flame throwers, and small tanks. War is beautiful because it initiates the dreamt-of metalization of the human body. War is beautiful because it enriches a flowering meadow with the fiery orchids of machine guns. War is beautiful because it combines the gunfire, the cannonades, the cease-fire, the scents, and the stench of putrefaction into a symphony. War is beautiful because it creates new architecture, like that of the big tanks, the geometrical formation flights, the smoke spirals from burning villages, and many others ... Poets and artists of Futurism! ... remember these principles of an aesthetics of war so that your struggle for a new literature and a new graphic art ... may be illumined by them!”   War is aestheticized (the aestheticization of the political). It is seen as a way for people to participate in a collective act of solidarity rather than as wanton slaughter in preservation of the status quo.   So, back to the Pussy Riot piece. I don't know if I'd call it an aestheticization of the political. Sure, it's an art piece about politics, but you can have political art which is certainly not an aestheticization of the political — indeed, that's part of the point of being able to politicize the aesthetic. Pussy Riot here at least intends their video to bring awareness to and valorize black struggle against the racist state apparatus:   Some fairness might be found // From ashes of his death (lyrics)   However there's still obviously the question as to whether they're successful, whether the video is exploitative, whether the video has its own racial tensions, etc."

CriticalTheory,2ziusu,Potso82,7,Wed Mar 18 22:56:50 2015 UTC,"This is right up my research alley, though I focus primarily on television. The best introductory book to theories of humor and parody in my opinion, is Simon Critchley's On Humour. I'd look to him for an explanation of Bakhtin's and Bergson's insights.  Unfortunately, there's not a whole lot of good stuff on digital culture and parody, but you might check out the work of Dave Gurney (http://cla.tamucc.edu/communication/faculty/dgurney.html). Henry Jenkins' website might also hold some relevant info for you. His books, especially Convergence Culture dance around a lot of these issues, though less directly as regards parody. Probably the most useful thing you could look at is Bolter and Grusin's book Remediation.  This is getting a bit further from being immediately telling to your project, but I feel that there is a strong explanatory power in Baudrillard's Fatal Strategies that can be applied to parody. Very simplified: you follow the rules and tropes of a mode of thinking/style until it collapses upon itself. Also, Fatal Strategies is pretty readable Baudrillard and quite enlightening. It's a gateway to Forget Foucault if that interests you.  Also, based on the lingo you're using, I want to make sure you're familiar with the short section of Jameson's Postmodernism where he discusses parody/pastiche.  One question though: why are you defining Too Many Cooks as an internet phenomenon when it originated as a TV special? If you are going to address its virality or some other aspect of its internet-specific life, I'd explain as much. If you are kind of bending its media-specificity to fit your thesis, I'd consider bending your thesis to your evidence rather than vice-versa.

This author is reading way too far into country music.  edit: When the author says ""This is why there are country songs,"" I merely meant to point out that this is a really hasty generalization. Most country music (especially ~1980 onwards) doesn't have the Lacanian depth that this author seems to think it has."

CriticalTheory,2yiasa,jerpskerp,3,Tue Mar 10 03:48:36 2015 UTC,"For a contemporary theory, you can take a look also at David Harvey's ""The New Imperialism"".  But there also the ""classics"", which may interest you:  I think John Atkinson Hobson's ""Imperialism: a study"" (1902) was the first to elaborate a theory of imperialism as a result of capitalism (specially the idea of an excess of capital that couldn't be employed in the domestic economies of the industrialized countries, so it sought external markets). He was a liberal but influenced a lot the early twentieth century Marxists.  Rudolf Hilferding's ""Finance Capital"" (1910) discussed the financialization and growth of corporate capitalism, which fomented the monopolization of economy and practice of inflated prices, as consequence emerged the need for external markets.  There is also Rosa Luxemburg's ""The Accumulation of Capital"" (1913), which has a different strategy: part of her argument is that imperialist politics is fundamentally the other side of economic accumulation; there is an ""organic link"" between extraction of surplus value and the expansion of capitalism worldwide. What Marx described as the ""primitive accumulation"" was in fact a constant phenomenon of capitalism.  Bukharin's ""Imperialism and World Economy"" (1917) and Lenin's ""Imperialism: the highest stage of capitalism"" (1916) follow in great measure both Hobson and Hilferding in their diagnosis of the emergence of an ""organized capitalism"" (or ""state capitalism"") as a result of the growth of the corporations and formation of cartels etc. So there were the formation of ""national blocks"" of capital competing in the world market etc.  (It's a frequent topic of their discussions this idea of a collapse of liberalism, with its ideals of laissez faire, pacifism etc. and the growth of social regimentation, militarism, nationalism etc. I think they are a pretty interesting reading.)  I think these are the most important ""classics"", but there are others, like Kautsky's ""Ultraimperialism"". Also, after WWII in Latin America, Africa and Asia emerged those theorists of decolonization and of ""dependent"" or ""peripheral"" capitalism who in one way or another develop these ideas further."
CriticalTheory,2yiasa,ogoidbr,2,Fri Mar 13 12:55:56 2015 UTC,"To answer the second question first, I've always treated early, linguist Chomsky as a critical theorist and later, political Chomsky as political criticism and commentary (at least what I've read, which isn't quite a lot for a few reasons).  As for Imperialism, lots of people focus on or peripherally about its impacts. Many post-colonial theorists  focus on criticisms of imperialism and its effects, but if you're starting at Chomsky, perhaps starting on criticisms of the United States as an imperial power is more what you're looking for? To which, I'd point you to the New Americanists, specifically a great place to start is Cultures of United States Imperialism. It's a starting point anthology by Donald Pease and Amy Kaplan which would very much interest you and give you many of the ""hits"" of New Americanists who are criticizing American imperialism (also, Futures of American Studies is great, but not as transformational as the former).  For specifically Chomsky's criticisms, what little I've read didn't really impress, so I stopped reading; so, I would leave it to someone else to explain who has read more."

Basically capitalism as the culture of infinite growth and progress constantly changes norms, and norms are invisible and predominantly are responsible for consumption/resource depletion. These changing norms are the driving force of capitalism. The economy must grow by 3% every year for decent growth and that means sweeping up more and more of the world into commodities which need to be consumed more and more. Because the literal bottom line is growth or death, capitalism as a cultural force cannot be stopped, it needs to be replaced. So there's that.  Deleuze & Guattari make the earth itself an example of the multiplicity of life and the death of any one singular meaning.

Poking around Berkeley's anthropology department will yield more scholars working on similar projects, like Charles Hirschkind Randall Styers has done some great work. He's probably still best known for Making Magic: Religion, Magic, and Science in the Modern World, a Foucauldian project looking at how discourses within religious studies constitute the category of magic as a foil to all of the ""good, proper"" aspects of modernity, and how the ambiguity of the category threatens to challenge this distinction and much of the cultural work that rests on it. Winnifred Fallers Sullivan, who is only a critical theorist in the broadest of senses but is still a leading authority on problems with religious freedom law (she specializes in the U.S. context but makes some points that are broadly applicable) and well worth a read for anyone interested in related issues She's not nearly as big of a name, and she focuses more on particular social critiques than on developing theory (putting her in the ""critical theory very broadly construed"" category along with Sullivan), but R.

I'd recommend, if specifically focused on religion, to look at Giorgio Agamben's works. I found The Time that Remains to be incredibly insightful, especially if you have a background in Walter Benjamin. He also has recently published The Highest Poverty, The Church and the Kingdom, and The Kingdom and the Glory, which while I haven't read seem to align with your interests of a noteworthy contemporary theorist doing religion.  Besides Agamben, Alain Badiou is also a big name who does a book on St. Paul, St. Paul: The Foundation of Universalism. Judith Butler is still doing very cool things, I'm thinking of Frames of War and Precarious Life, but her tackle of religion is more of a critical of the ontotheological tradition and a bit of the Hannah Arendt move, as I read it, of using her position outside of Judaism to critique Judaism (Arendt calling herself a ""non-Jewish Jew.) If the nation-state and looks at democracy or politics is more your thing, Wendy Brown's Walled States, Waning Sovereignty (which actually touches on religion a bit) or her just published Undoing the Demos could fit. With politics, also, Jacques Ranciere is still worth reading (even if just for his essay ""Ten Thesis on Politics) and Chantal Mouffe is interesting.  These are the big names for me, presently, with a few lesser known names (but not lesser thinkers) being Lauren Berlant with affect theory; David Harvey's work on neoliberalism and capitalism;and  New Americanist / transnational American studies has some interesting work by Donald Pease, Lisa Lowe, Amy Kaplan, and/or John Carlos Rowe.  An even smaller name, but one I'm very interested presently (but I've veered now far from religions, haven't I?), is William Spanos. boundary 2 just dedicated an entire issue to him and his work and I'm really digging his onto-political criticism. He's doing the transnational American thing in some works (focusing on Melville), but his approach in The Legacy of Edward Said, Heidegger and Criticism, and Exiles in the City: Said and Arendt in Counterpoint is quite hip and aggressive, which I'm enjoying."
CriticalTheory,2y3ick,zzuum,5,Fri Mar 6 02:55:17 2015 UTC,"I believe Foucault is using the term 'modern soul' as a place-holder, if you will, in which the 'modern soul' is meant to be the maluable conception of a 'self', particularly in relation to Enlightenment ideals.  As quoted from here (Which I encourage you too read):   In this mode, scientific inquiry, classification and codification became trump. The Enlightenment indeed cast a light on all things, opening them up to the human mind, and gave the world a sense of structure, progression, optimism. The modern conception of the human was here born and elevated to the status of overseer; the human was essentially a rational self whose purpose was to think, observe and figure out. At the same time, the concept of freedom, which had not previously been fully entertained as an a priori truth, came to the fore. The rational agent was considered to be autonomous, with the capacity for free thought and action1"
CriticalTheory,2y3ick,Surtur1313,3,Fri Mar 6 05:07:31 2015 UTC,"I read Foucault as saying something more radical: that the webs of power that bodies are caught in not only determine our conceptions of ourselves, but (at least partially) determine the way our 'minds', 'souls', 'selves', etc. actually are.

CriticalTheory,2y3ick,pixi666,2,Sat Mar 7 23:41:16 2015 UTC,"Reading a bit on this now in 'Ethics of Dissensus' by Ziarek. She claims Foucault's reading of the soul is as a transcendental identity designed to construct a (liberal, humanistic) idea of 'man' where the 'radical spatiality' of the body, its dependency on historical and cultural specifics, is obscured by the notion of a holistic soul. Seems similar to Lacan's idea of the holistic 'Self' being used to overcome the alienation created by our fragmented consciousness--although Foucault uses it more in a social/political context.  ""Foucault argues that the appearance of the moral conscience (soul) as a new object of punishment at the beginning of the nineteenth cnetury is but an effect produced by the new disciplinary technologies of the body: 'It would be wrong to say that the soul is an illusion, or an ideological effect. On the contrary, it exists, it has a reality, it is produced permanently around, on, within the body by the functioning of power that is exercised on those punished.'"""

I think his style of pessimism does actually entail a lot of hope that gets a little overlooked.  Anyway: I think he would have expanded his notions of the culture industry to entail things like social media, whereby the artist has become an extension of the visible artwork - commodifying the self. The industry in this way has become much more veiled, the subject essentially mimics the mechanisms of industry on an individual scale - like in Negative Dialectics where he states something along the lines of ""people have become like ideology themselves"" (that's a caricature paraphrasing, so forgive me). These kind of social operations would have bothered him a lot, I think. The internet itself would have garnered a lot of discussion too.  Remember, this is someone that wrote fragmentary accounts on everything from the slamming of doors and locks to the giving of gifts, pop music, positivism, enlightenment and so on. It's endless.

If I say 'hate' then I seem to imply a fixed dichotomy that entails and opposes 'love' too - I think he was trying to undermine these kind of absolute claims and oppositional relations quite often. 'Melancholy' is a good term, one that he uses in Minima Moralia and one used by Gillian Rose too. The Melancholy Science, I think that's very nice.  The emphasis on negation seems to me to have given Adorno this unfair representation as 'hateful' when really he was preserving his ability to seek another way, free from pernicious methodology/ideology.

I tend to think of situations that I find myself pessimistic about and the residue that is left over tends to be a hope for a better outcome, I hope that isn't too abstract to convey over a forum like reddit.  In fact, with pop music he does confess the harmonic language of pop as having a greater heterogeneity than that of serious music - towards the end of his life even mentioning that he'd heard a number of very good popular songs. He might have seemed like a snob, and maybe in many ways he was, but he still took the time to write about popular music a lot when no one else would touch it"

Said was influenced by Foucault, so a familiarity with his theory of epistemes and knowledge/power would be useful. As for his literary critiques, a lot of those can be summarized through reviews of the book (as mentioned by u/deleuzilla). They are in a similar vein as Chinua Achebe's critique of Heart of Darkness, which is a relatively short essay that you can find online.   For a more contemporary continuation of Said's work, check out his student Joseph Massad's Desiring Arabs.

CriticalTheory,2w5n5a,Dragon9770,6,Tue Feb 17 03:55:34 2015 UTC,"I have nothing valuable to input but would love to hear more of your research because Ive wondered it myself.   Mimetics have been around forever (fairy tales, nursery rhymes, stock characters in puppetry and plays, popular lines of poetry and prose), but the influence of mass media certainly leads to very quick and widespread propagation of very complex modern ideas distilled into a single image and 1-2 lines of text.   I would submit the ""universe of meaning"" found in memes is irreperably tied to current cultural expression and rarely brings about true change or new ideas.  Attempts to do so rarely last beyond a month, and thereafter simply become mockeries of themselves in popular culture, such as #yesallwomen, which is not treated kindly in reddit culture. Memes are a new way to state old ideas. Scumbag Steve is a repackaging of Goofus or an old school cad.  I am facinated that memes are used to instantly frame a narrative and shape expectations. Confession Bear immediately inspires sympathy and comisseration. Scumbag Steve/Stacey causes us to expect a villain and tragedy. Left/Right Penguin is a story of misfortune and triumphant reversal. Memes can be used to tell a story boiled down to its essence, its shortest possible form. Puppetry again comes to mind, its a series of stock characters used to tell a narrative.  And of course you can analyze them using whatever literary theory you favor. Feminist theory would have a lot to say about Good Girl Gina, who rather than being the ""good person/friend/sister/coworker who is female"" equivilant to Greg, is used 95% of the time in reference to girlfriends being nice to their boyfriends."
CriticalTheory,2w5n5a,CourageousWren,3,Tue Feb 17 10:53:42 2015 UTC,"How could I forget Good Girl Gina, that is probably the most universally abhorrent, because it almost never fills the Greg-who-is-female model.  I forget the other one, but its basically the same thing but some topless college girl.  At least they are obvious, right?  ""I would submit the ""universe of meaning"" found in memes is irreperably tied to current cultural expression and rarely brings about true change or new ideas."" - Again, its not like I have invested much into this idea besides some notes taken while reading Critical Theory for the first time, but I would certainly not argue it is wholly liberating (i myself listed several qualifications to that), but I am arguing for that small niche of possibility.  The fact that these collections of images and, as you put it, condensed narratives, are propagated in a manner that is possibly free of the general system (I express myself with #rageface rather than Homer Simpson's ""D'oh"").  The more I think on it, the weaker this avenue appears, but if there were any place in which a new universe of meaning could be constructed, however partially, that is not in an academic circle or in the heart of an already existing revolutionary struggle (which puts the cart before the horse), stupid internet pictures that attempt to convey human experience is the best I can think of on a worthwhile enough scale."

CriticalTheory,2w5n5a,breadrock,3,Tue Feb 17 17:40:47 2015 UTC,"Ok, so the internet, online communities like reddit and 4chan, and everything getting digitalized make for huge amounts of information liberation. Hackers and pirates rejoice, because information is free. Anything can become an image macro (another word for text on an image, first lifted from the 4chan tradition of Caturday) when all movies and tv shows and all media become digitalized. This is what should help frame your discussion, a technological change.  You seem to be lacking a history of memes in general. Maybe a historical background would be good for you. Look into 4chan, how memes originated at 4chan and then moved on to reddit and facebook at large, and Anonymous.  After you do that, you should consider Buzzfeed. Buzzfeed is very interesting because as you say it encourages people to consider themselves put in each other shoes but it is an entirely for profit advertising company, and was actually inspired by Deleuze and Guattari.  http://www.critical-theory.com/from-deleuze-to-lolcats-the-story-of-the-buzzfeed-guy/  Read both his academic article and the post in the New Yorker.   So aside from backstory that would help frame your questions, I would say that yes you are right that people can, should and must use the images and role models of their times to formulate how they feel, but how is evoking your feelings in a meme any different than evoking your feelings in language? It's different, but remarkable similar. That quote you provided hits the nail on the head for me.     This must necessarily be so, for language is nothing private and personal, or rather the private and personal is mediated by the available linguistic material, which is societal material   So there's an increase in societal material to work with for expression, which is neither inherently liberating or oppressive. That's how I see things, but this question of culture and agency in the digital age is so vast this is just what I'm going to come up with now."
CriticalTheory,2w5n5a,Marshmlol,3,Wed Feb 18 03:12:44 2015 UTC,"""So there's an increase in societal material to work with for expression, which is neither inherently liberating or oppressive."" My impression from Marcuse was that he was insisting that there was ""inherent"" goodness and badness, because the way that societal material is produced offer suggestions of meaning (in even non-critical art theory, you cannot derive a ""proletarian struggle"" meaning out of ""See Spot Run"").  The age of Marcuse was saturated with stuff like Leave it to Beaver, and that was the societal material people had to work with within their language.  The production of media itself determines content, form, and ultimately its impact upon the universe of meaning one's language inhabits- we frame and interpret ourselves through the lens of our environment and the words we speak carry different weights and connotations: no kid who grew up with South Park will ever be able to take ""Respect my authority"" in a fully serious manner.  That is a rather obviously political example, but the conveyance of virtues through the ""good guy/scumbag (blank)"" is a low-key example of building up a media landscape on which ideas of something akin to virtue ethics could be built (somewhere right now Aristotle's skeleton is a turbine).  So basically, you can't seperate the language from the historical situation of the person, and that contexualization includes a media universe that strongly influences people and the mode in which that production of that media has importance; the anarchization (democratization implies too much structure, even with Reddit algorithms and voting) of a portion of this total media landscape through internet media production, typified by the image macro, opens a possibility of escaping, well, capitalism's effect on the mind...maybe...just a little perhaps.  I doubt even ""Scumbag capitalism"" getting the traffic amount of GGG is enough to make revolutionary subjects, but perhaps it can help with a little bit of ""commune escapism"" without actually leaving the techno-political order.  And thanks for the reminder about the Buzzfeed guy.  I avoid that site, so I only have a middling amount of experiential data to pull on, but I keep forgetting to read his article.  Thanks."
CriticalTheory,2w28ow,mt923,8,Mon Feb 16 09:26:11 2015 UTC,"Derrida's ""Differance"" is incredibly pivotal in this regard. Also Barthes' piece at the end of Mythologies where he applies the second order of meaning, myth is his term for it,  to de Saussure's structure of a sign. These I think are the most directly accessible and efficient (meaning content to time invested) pieces regarding the unfixed nature of language. Might be good to read Structure, Sign and Play while you're at it.  Anything by Derrida that directly addresses ""free play"" applies here. If you haven't, go back and touch up the basics from de Saussure."
CriticalTheory,2w28ow,fermenter85,7,Mon Feb 16 17:52:02 2015 UTC,"The idea that language has its origin in reality is torn apart starting after the positivists.  Quine dismantles the analytic/synthetic distinction (read ""Two Dogmas of Empiricism"") and proposes a more systematic theory of meaning, Wittgenstein takes it to another level with family resemblances, language games, etcetera (read the Investigations), and Sellars talks about how one must rely on the context of a previously known system to utilize the ""roles"" of words (read ""Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind"").  After that (not really in any order), Rorty says that language is used to cope with cultural environments to achieve a pragmatic end in Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature.    Foucault talks about the way language has referred to the world in The Order of Things.  In The Archeology of Knowledge, he says that statements create rules which govern what can be meaningful.  ""Truth production"" is also covered in AoK, which may find sympathies with your idea that ""constant revision of our narrative and discursive tools is one of the key forces propelling cultural change.""  Derrida is probably the biggest player here (terrible pun intended).  Of Grammatology and ""Signature, Event, Context"" are probably best for what you're looking for.  Also, +1 for One-Dimensional Man as mentioned by /u/Dragon9770.  That book was a game changer for me."

I just assume all the super smart people here already got all the classics down pat, with Adorno and Horkheimer memorized.

I just began studying critical theory, and there is no opportunity to even discuss it at my current college (thankfully, I'm transferring).  It's definitely a ton of stuff to cover in all too little time.  Thankfully, you can get a grasp on the positivists rather quickly, relatively speaking.  Read Descartes's Meditations, Hume's Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding, Russell's The Problems of Philosophy, and Ayer's Language, Truth, and Logic.  The overarching theme here is epistemic foundationalism.  For the positivists, that comes through empirical knowledge.  And there you have it (more or less)!"

My own stuff outside of college has brought me up through the 19th century, with a little Hegel, a little Keirkegaard (the understandable stuff at least), some Neitzsche, and a fuckton of Marx.  Critical theory is really my first foray into 20th century philosophy that isn't philosophy that pretty much started in the last century (as far as I am concerned, philosophy of science goes Bacon -> Quine (pretty just for falsifiability) -> Kuhn (who I bet Marcuse would have put in ODM if they were publishing within 2 years of each other) ).  I knew positivists (are they the same as analytic, as opposed to contienetal?) where super-British, and all about logic, close to scientism, and loved math more than mathematicians, but that is just the caricature I have learned.  I would like to give the modern ones a fair shake some day, though coming in post-critical theory will be tough.  I would expect super-intelligent people here, since its a very niche sub, but I get super intimidated by even some of the people in /r/socialism, /r/communism (when they aren't defending Stalin or North Korea), and /r/RadicalChristianity (seriously, their Hegelianism and Existentialism is incredible- I would have stayed in church if those people ran the one I grew up in)."

There is the really great example of the human resources study he quotes in which the act of clarifying worker complaints particularizes the statements, depriving them of their social indictment (""Wages are too low"" is clarified as ""The wage of employee B is too low after the medical emergency of his wife;"" it is technically more accurate, but it changes the meaning).  I just keeps going on about historical context, but most of his argumentation is negative (""Wittgenstein is shit,"" etc.).  He has a great line like ""We only understand each other through a clouded universe of misunderstanding,"" and the ""logical language of the common man"" proposed by such linguists does not represent actual language and in fact restricts it to oppression-supporting speech."

This has nothing to do with the text.   The article has this tone that just grated me all the way through, as if I was reading a blog post by someone speaking to his friends in their Ayn Rand club - an assumed position in the reader, one that meant everything written was a nudge and a wink.   Do I even need to explain why this isn't analysis?   A quick search on the author hints he is part of a community of scholars who position themselves against: ""poststructuralism, Marxism, psychoanalysis, gay and lesbian criticism and queer theory.""   Again, this has nothing to do with the actual content of the text. I position myself against everything in that list (though I am sympathetic towards marxist analysis), yet I still consider my main camp to be that of critical theory. This has nothing to do with the text, and all to do with the author's position. But who cares if that's his position? I don't respect Heidegger's position, but there is still merit in reading him.   ""There just didn't seem to be any substance to the article, to me anyway - it was just empty..""   This should have been the first sentence of the analysis, because it would then allow the person to expand on why he/she feels this way. Take this last sentence and put it at the beginning of the ""analysis"" and then ask yourself if the analysis in question actually substantiates the argument made in that sentence."
CriticalTheory,2vk1eq,un_daim,1 point,Wed Feb 11 17:44:03 2015 UTC,Thoughts? I'm a bit troubled by Zizek's evocation — and poor philosophical defence — of a ‘true self’. Maybe it was just convenient to use the term.  I get it.
CriticalTheory,2vk1eq,zbufferz,15,Wed Feb 11 17:46:00 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that he brings this notion precisely to question it. His point is to say that there is no «true self» because our inner («true») self is the lie (the story) we construct to justify our real, external, situation and actions. Example: I'm not able to get rich, so I start to claim that i'm happy without money, that I'm left wing oriented, etc. I create a false «true me» who dosen't car about money to legitimate and accept my real condition."
CriticalTheory,2vk1eq,un_daim,3,Wed Feb 11 20:51:24 2015 UTC,"He actually makes a point in one of his recent books that relates to this.  He considers the idea that many modern philosophers and indeed postmodernists posit that the truth while unknowable is sort of endlessly approachable.  Kind of like a mathematical limit function.  You never get to the truth but all these approaches from all sides do get us closer.  He argues that this is wrong.  There is no absolute truth, what we are in fact doing is creating endless streams of absolute truths to blind us to the realization that there is no absolute truth.  The implication of his argument are much more profound than the example you give ""I'm not able to get rich, so I start to claim that i'm happy without money"".  It's more like ""I'm not able to get rich, but I am a person who deserves to be, so the world must be unjust.""  Further, I am left wing because I want to fight this injustice.  You see the appeal in there to the absolute truth?  There there are people who deserve it, that there is some cosmic metric against which one can be evaluated as deserving or not.  That's the lie.  There is no 'deserve'.  There is no 'fair'. There is no 'just'  So he goes further to explore what put that ""truth"" in your head to begin with, and that is where all of his work on ideology comes in."

I think what he's basically saying here is that ideology has a material basis just like what Althusser wrote about, mixed with Zizek's interpretation of Lacan. An example of this is when Zizek gives an example of how ideology works by talking about an anecdote about Niels Bohr. There was a horseshoe outside of Bohr's door, and in Europe it is said to be good luck. When asked if he actually believed it, Bohr said, ""No I don't, but I was told that it works even if you don't believe in it.""   Let's take a look at the self-aware, cynical hipster who buys starbucks. Inwardly, they know that the system isn't working and that the humanitarian causes it promotes is a sham and their self-narrative is that they are beyond ideology, but they 'negate the negation' through their cynicism while they gentrify neighborhoods and shop at whole foods; in other words they are themselves through their mask.   You also have to look at what the conscious ego tells itself doesn't always mean what it tells itself what's Real since the unconscious is pretty much a blackbox. Zizek also talks about how ideology is an unconscious fantasy structuring reality. This is how I interpreted it, anyways."

Experts are consulted to govern every aspect of our lives, so many people who are anti-gmo or vaccination have some gripe with the establishment or authoritative knowledge. So that's Foucault and governmentality for you right there. Here's a reading on the topic.  So here comes the Zizek. Okay, so things aren't going well in society, wages haven't kept up with inflation, something just smells foul to the average person. What will replace the faith that people had in institutions?

It's getting really bizarre seeing everything getting contested in the public media in all the wrong ways, like a politicalization of everything. Suddenly climate scientists have agendas and can't be trusted, food scientists and gmo food can't be trusted, drug companies can't be trusted (that one is probably true though). People are kind of cherry picking their facts and then putting a reassuring story over everything else they don't understand. (Like I don't understand how global warming actually works or how bad it will be but I accept it because it makes sense that after thousands of years of trashing the planet something would go wrong. So perhaps that's to be expected, no one can know everything, but if nothing's unbiased anymore common discourse has failed.) And this is happening on both sides of the aisle in America; conservatives are obfuscating economic outrage with moral outrage, and liberals aren't talking about that a key part of Obamacare was an increase in taxes if you don't have health insurance and are just dismissing it as Republican nonsense. It's like, pick your worldview and we'll hook you up with an appropriate fact sheet to convince you your way of life is the only way to live. The matrix of common ground is shrinking and independent cultural-political ways of life are growing.

CriticalTheory,2vgnfm,CAkEBall,2,Tue Feb 10 21:39:14 2015 UTC,"Just curious to know where you are coming from in this. Have you read any early Baudrillard (Pre-Critique of the Political economy of the sign) or Marx? I'm just curios because knowing where Baudrillard is coming from can be very helpful in understanding his terms, some of which have very specific meanings in terms of Capital and economics.  Understanding his lineage but then break with Marx is particularly important, especially here because he is sort of bending a Marx argument (the connection between wage and labour) to his own uses. (I haven't read the particular text you are quoting.)  This text is obviously Baudrillard transitioning to his later metaphorical bent. It is treacherous because Baudrillard begins more and more using literary devices that often make it difficult to understand where he is coming from. Irony is a particular trap Baudrillard seems to lay with relish, (something Marx did as well) making it very difficult often to understand where he is siding with his argument. He will later in his career renounce all sides and basically just lie back and create giant nihilistic clusterfucks for all to fall in.   But so my point is that asking whether or not something ""is a good thing,"" within a Baudrillard system is sort of beside the point. He most often doesn't see ""good"" in anything, but is instead trying to describe the system.  Sacrifice here might seem like ""the way out"" but sacrifice probably means something no one wants, likely immediate death.  This passage is especially indebted to its Baudrillard's Marxist roots, ""waged labor because of the equivalent nature of the exchange of labor and money"" is a Marx idea.  Baudrillard is trying to go one step further and say that not only is Capital extracting labor by wages, it is doing so by making it exchangeable it for prolonging the moment of death.  That it, (and possibly only it) has the ability to deny death, and that this power is what makes the exchange even possible. There is no ""equivalent wage"" as far as I can tell that can be paid?  (this is sort of turning the political talking point or idea of a Job (""we need more Job creators"") as being the lifeblood of people on its head and saying that in fact it is the opposite, that jobs or employment are in function a stayed execution sentence from an economic system which has already doomed us.)  In the passage you quoted there is no ""symbolic death"" there is only death. This might be what you are getting hung up on. Labor is basically  capital's refusing the worker their death, and in doing so makes the exchange of labour for wages possible, ""indifferent consumption of life and death."" This is sort of a poetic argument and is in line with Baudrillard's desire to extrapolate everything to its endgame scenario.  The different between sacrificial and economic is its dealing with the moment of death, the sacrifice is immediate but the economic is prolonged so that it may be extrapolated."
CriticalTheory,2vgnfm,toadnovak,2,Wed Feb 11 01:24:30 2015 UTC,"In the passage you quoted there is no ""symbolic death"" there is only death.   Not so sure about this. If we combine his thoughts on simulation, then ""capitol"" may very well be ""refusing the work their death"" and replacing it with the simulation of death — labour itself?"
CriticalTheory,2vgnfm,toadnovak,2,Wed Feb 11 18:17:39 2015 UTC,"If this is what Baudrillard is saying it would be really interesting. It could be. Death is very important to Baudrillard, the only thing I think he ever mentions as an exit from simulation, and so him stating that something can simulate death would be interesting. However economic systems I can't imagine would want to simulate death, because workers would then be less inclined to want to enter its system. More likely its a simulation of life. (But again I think Baudrillard is careful in what he is saying, and again is breaking slightly with Marxism (the ""pious and revolutionary view"") in that Baudrillard already has given up on the idea of the communal utopia and enlightenement of the worker on the other side of capital, there is no such thing as unsimulated life.)  ""Labour is not opposed, like a sort of death, to the ""fulfilment of life"", which is the idealist view; labour is opposed as a slow death to a violent death. That is the symbolic reality.""  You might be right, but he seems to be going out of his way not to say it explicity?"
CriticalTheory,2vgnfm,thinkonthebrink,2,Wed Feb 11 20:27:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, I was making a rather lame connective point that I don’t think holds up. While reading your comment I had in mind one of his initial propositions in Simulacra and Simulation — that we have “killed” the Real in the procession of simulacra, making it a kind of symbolic death procession. It’s death in a different context.    However economic systems I can’t imagine would want to simulate death   Well, if we want to hold on to anything from my original point, it might be this: in labour’s deferral of death, it creates for the labourer an idea or ideal of some non-achievable death. We understand the kind of death we are being denied, but only through a simulation created by labour itself. Or maybe I’m just tired."
CriticalTheory,2vgnfm,bossmilky,1 point,Wed Feb 11 21:36:16 2015 UTC,"Well after all there is a section of this book called survival, or he equivalent to death. A quote:   So it is with death. Death is ultimately nothing more than the social line of demarcation separating the 'dead' from the 'living': therefore, it affects both equally. Against the senseless illusion of the living of willing the living to the exclusion of the dead, against the illusion that reduces life to an absolute surplus-value by subtracting death from it, the indestructible logic of symbolic exchange re-establishes the equivalence of life and death in the indifferent fatality of survival. In survival, death is repressed; life itself, in accordance with that well known ebbing away, would be nothing more than a survival determined by death.   His point is that the sharp divide between life and death is an illusion. We are determined in life by our conception of death.   The best synonym for symbolic death is radical indeterminacy.   I highly recommend Andrew Robinson's series on Baudrillard (and others) on the Cease Fire magazine. Here's a quote from him:   Modern culture dreams of radical difference.  The reason for this is that it exterminated radical difference by simulating it.  The energy of production, the unconscious, and signification all in fact come from the repressed remainder.  Our culture is dead from having broken the pact with monstrosity, with radical difference.   https://ceasefiremagazine.co.uk/in-theory-baudrillard-2/"
CriticalTheory,2vgnfm,thinkonthebrink,1 point,Mon Feb 16 01:00:32 2015 UTC,"I'm more interested in your questions, I guess, than in trying to provide answers.  But I love Baudrillard, so I'll take a guess. The slave or prisoner of war has no real ""labor"" value because they are, in a sense, already dead. They expire as infinite, and not potential, labor.  Whereas the free person (freed, really) has labor value or sacrificial value-- he either does not meet his labor potential (and sacrifices to something else) or he does meet his labor potential (in which case he may as well be dead-- he does nothing but work, and may as well be a slave).  So the working class' labor is predicated on symbolic death. Anything else would require sacrifice (like, say, someone being an artist, or committing themselves to religion, something with cultural or other use-value than the purely economic). So, workers are denied the dignity of anything but symbolic death in the numbers and figures of those controlling capital.   I read the concept of ""sacrifice"" like I might read it in Bataille-- that sacrifice is the rapturous thing that constantly eludes us, the thing that negates all, the thing that has no use-value.   I hope someone who knows way more than me will follow up here."
CriticalTheory,2vgnfm,thinkonthebrink,1 point,Wed Feb 11 20:32:15 2015 UTC,"I'm so excited that you posted this. Labor and death is one of my favorite passages in the first chapter of Symbolic Exchange and Death.    What I don't understand is how the calculation of equivalence requires death in the first place. Additionally, if the problem of waged labor is equivalence, what if the employer just didn't pay an equivalent wage?   It's not so much ""how much"" of a wage the laborer is paid, but that he is paid a wage. Passing from living without a wage being important to living in need of a wage.   In my opinion, Baudrillard's thought here is best expressed int he genealogy he provides: the slain enemy becomes the prisoner of war, conserved in order to serve.   The idea is that you are kept alive because it is convenient to do so. Those who are not valued are routinely allowed to die and are outright killed. Therefore the laborer is not ""worth killing"" because he is not fighting on the real battlefield.   I have more thoughts but I'll try to do your questions...   1)Is symbolic exchange always a good thing?   It's more like symbolic exchange is everything. Baudrillard's thoughts on good and evil, if you look at his late writing the Spirit of Terrorism, is that it is not the good that triumphs over the evil, but that evil dissolves the concept of the good from within by showing that the ""good"" is not good.   In my mind, symbolic exchange is what's beyond ideology. To Baudrillard, ideology is fundamentally about 1/0, creating hierarchical distinctions. This process is ultimately in vain, because we are unable to directly encounter the world through our piles of concepts.   So in the end I'd say that symbolic exchange is not always expressed as a good thing (I thing I'd want to happen, I guess). The reason it's interesting is because it posits a realm beyond the knowledge of systems of quantifiable classification.    2) What does it mean for death to be sacrificial? He talks about deffered/slow death vs violent/sacrificial death, but what would sacrificial death look like.   It's not the best example, but a really striking one is suicide bombing. Again from Spirit of Terrorism, Baudrillard writes that the symbolic power of the terrorists' act derived from their turning modern technology against itself and in their willingness to die for their cause.   So what would the difference be? It's the difference between trying to find a job and setting yourself on fire on the capitol building. But see that's already something that's been done. The fact is that even if you did nothing but wage symbolic violence against the system, it would find a way to censor you. And if you were a big enough threat, it could kill you.   The slow death is monotony, night after day, whereas the violent sacrificial death gives up the ultimate value of life. If we'll do anything to stay alive, then we'll never rebel- we'll turn on each other. This move beyond the absolute value of life mirrors the jump from ideology to symbolic exchange, since life/death is just another 1/0 system.    3) What is the economic vs the sacrificial. Baudrillard talks about how death distinguishes between the two, but what is that difference? Is one bad and the other good?   I think it's in that chapter... Baudrillard talks about the motto KILLING EATING DEVOURING and then GIVING TAKING EXCHANGING. Maybe that's not exactly it but I think it's close...  So maybe it's a little counter-intuitive, but I'd say Killing-Eating-Devouring is more on the side of the economic. It's like saying, we're going to kill all the buffalo because that way the Indians won't have anything to eat and we'll drive them off this land we want.   On the other hand, the sacrificial is more like the way the indigenous people interacted with the world. When they killed a buffalo, they may thank it or the world spirit, trying to make some gesture of gratitude for being kept alive in the world through the death of other things.   So..  We have to kill and consume in order to survive, but how do we proceed from there? Baudrillard advocates sacrificing ourselves to the cause of giving the greatest gift that we can, of rising to the highest challenge.   So the economic viewpoint wants to be productive, while the sacrificial seeks not to accumulate but to leverage one's ability with one's life as a stake.   Footnote: the problem for the left is that the high profile examples of people risking their lives are people inflicting death on huge numbers of non-combatants. The bourgeois armies also proudly enforce the exploitative conditions of trade that suck life from some and disperse it to others. A student protester once talked about throwing oneself on the gears, but how many people really do that? So it's not that the sacrificial is good, you can sacrifice yourself for something heinous and stupid. But at the same time you're not really free as long as you're relying on the wage (economic structure) of the system you're trying to fight."

This is also done in a similar manner in Dialectic of Enlightenment insofar that religion is an important authority that gets overturned, if one can call if that, during the Enlightenment.   If you want more ""focused"" treatments of religion, I would look at Religion and Rationality: Essays on Reason, God and Modernity by Habermas, and some of Horkheimer's aphorisms in Dawn and Decline that discuss the nature of religion and its function in capitalist society.   [I know Horkheimer isn't really contemporary but the more I read by him the more I think he's an essential read!]  I would also recommend reading works by John Caputo, who is a philosopher of religion working with the insights of poststructuralism and the like. He's probably one of the clearest writers I've had the pleasure to study and is not only a humble person (from what I can tell from interviews and lectures) but is also really insightful.

CriticalTheory,2tixxy,shaguarpaw,3,Fri Jan 30 23:49:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think they're necessarily synonymous. Critical theory can refer to two things: in the narrow sense, it's the Frankfurt School tradition of western Marxist philosophy - your Adorno, Benjamin, Horkheimer, Marcuse, and maybe their successors Habermas and Honneth. In the broad sense - and the one that people usually mean nowadays - it is a philosophical tradition concerned with the critical interrogation of power, ideology, and emancipation - covering a wide variety of different ""theories"" (gender, sexuality, race, post-colonialism, class, psychoanalysis, disability studies, ecology, and so on).   Literature typically covers all analysis of literary texts, with usually a decent amount of freedom to branch out into film and visual art - Derrida's dictum that anything can count as a text is pretty well-accepted. There are many tools used in literary criticism but the postmodern discourse analysis rooted in critical theory maintains an absolute, unquestioned hegemony in almost all serious literature departments. You can still do formalism, it's just going to be extremely rare and you'd probably have to look for a pretty marginal program to specialize in it. This is why I'm rather skeptical of hard divides between Humanities departments - almost no serious academic does literature without informing their work with doses of history, cultural anthropology, and especially ""critical theory"".  So, typically, if you wanted to do critical theory, in most universities that maintain classic disciplinary divisions you'd end up in the Comp Lit or Literary Theory department. This says very little about the kinds of critical theory you can study there and I'd advise you to view department names with a healthy dose of skepticism. Working with professors whose work you find inspiring and who can help you take your own thought to the next level is far more important in graduate school."

In other words, the ""throwback"" to something thought of as more authentic, or a more authentic time is ultimately made real through the same process of simulation and so serves to regenerate this very process making it morally or practically legitimate by virtue of the perceived ""authenticity"" that the suspenders or straight razors represent.

What I am essentially trying to analyze is the hipster phenomenon where people believe the older practices to be somehow tied to a more authentic life..but in this the hipsters show themselves to be so penetrated by the consumer society and capitalism that even the notions of authenticity tend to derive from objects and the practices that were brought about by those objects. So I'm thinking early baudrillard will be the best bet...I've read system of objects, consumer society, critique for the political economy of the sign, symbolic exchange and death, simulacra  and simulation, the perfect crime, and passwords so far."
CriticalTheory,2td2xq,ruminating,2,Fri Jan 23 07:19:53 2015 UTC,"I think the hipster deal is a pretty good example of what I went over earlier in that those that engage in this sort of thing are part of a tension regarding pomo production. The variety of shittyness of every commodity, every activity, every lifestyle available is so dramatic and so obviously simulated, produced specifically to be needed, needs groomed specifically to meet what is produced that just as Disneyland serves to create a fantasy so fantastical that the ""real"" world and the preconceptions that dominate it actually becomes real and not simulated, the absolute ridiculous array of nonsense has made some commodities far more authentic by comparison even while they are in every way the same as those other commodities, activities, and lifestyles they stand apart from. In this way, the entire process is restored into confidence.  So I think their motivation in this case is a reaction to how obviously simulated everything is, although this reaction is also a part of that simulation as it is also played out through the market. Their reaction is not even being recuperated in that it is a part of that same process. Its like a shitty dancer suddenly becomes aware that he is a shitty dancer and so tries really hard to dance better, but only knowing how to dance poorly, he just keeps shitty dancing as a means of trying not to dance shitty anymore."

CriticalTheory,2t9osp,WhiskeySeven,6,Thu Jan 22 15:03:54 2015 UTC,"Well, in the first instance, the guy probably found the association post-black notebooks to be unappealing; I dont know his life, but the professor might have found good reasons to not like carrying the Heidegger name as a professional badge.  Second, isn't critical theory all about denying the dualism purported to exist between the world of the mind/thought/ideas and the real physical world (just starting getting into Horkheimer and Adorno, so I could be misunderstanding)?  Besides, in a few ways, the Heideggerian ideal contained in Being and Time correlates to the Nazi ideals (at least the non-genocidal parts), thus why Heidegger would be such a staunch supporter early on: the man himself saw it as the political blooming of his philosophy.  The black notebooks were the nail in the coffin, to the point that people wanting to think the best could no longer do so.  So no, I don't think you can separate the man from the work (we certainly don't do that when analyzing Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, acknowledging their aristocratic associations/positions and their anti-democratic political philosophies)."
CriticalTheory,2t9osp,Dragon9770,3,Thu Jan 22 22:06:14 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I've read a lot of Heidegger, and I used to belong to the man/work camp (and this question of the black notebooks doesn't even seem to be man/work, it's more like work/work, as in, what work really counts as the canonical Heidegger, and what makes up the anti-semitic, personal asides?). Recently, however, I've just decided that he makes the most sense when you read him as a Nazi thinker. Too many parallels exist between his thought and the logic of the Third Reich to justify doing otherwise.   editing to say that Heidegger isn't 100%, across-the-board consistent with Nazi ideology, and in fact contradicts it at times, but there are still many similarities."

Hitler wasn't even consistent with Nazi ideology (where is his blond-blue eyes strong Greco-roman physique?), but if anyone wanted to find a philosophy that would be most consistent, it would be his (right Hegelianism is way too Prussian and left Hegelianism is way too liberal to make Hegel any sort of precursor/match to Nazism, thus why I would contend Heidegger)."

There are so many schools, thinkers, frameworks, etc. that I could never think of critical theory as a unified project for or against anything. Adorno certainly criticized a lot of thinkers for being too abstract, but of course critical theory does not begin and end with Adorno.    Besides, in a few ways, the Heideggerian ideal contained in Being and Time correlates to the Nazi ideals    Are you talking about eigentlich? Sorge? And could you elaborate on the connection with Nazi ideals? I ask for clarification only because lately the trend seems to have shifted from accusations against the man to accusations against the philosophy (not that Adorno hasn't already been there done that, but I'm talking more about journalism) but without a whole lot of textual citations (or at least examples) from the philosophical works, which are much more fruitful for conversations like this."
CriticalTheory,2t9osp,breadrock,1 point,Sun Feb 1 23:12:13 2015 UTC,"I will admit, my critical theory is shallow (have only gotten through Hork/Adorno now and plan on branching out soon, so I have not built up an understanding of the commonalities among theorists).    As for Heidegger (who my understanding is only in secondary literature so far; sorry, am only an undergrad and a year ago I barely knew Descartes), my recollection is that basically the ideal of the dasein correlated to the idea of a strong rural, independent country man (he did do a lot of his writing in the rural Black Forest) because you could only realize your humanity through interaction with nature, away from modernity which distracted one from one's mortality, and in struggle.  The most recent secondary source I saw this in was this documentary ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8YTD51lGFg ), which I trusted because it squared with what all I had already known about his thought."
CriticalTheory,2t9osp,Dragon9770,2,Sun Feb 1 23:23:09 2015 UTC,"His Nazism, according to Figal and other readers of his diaries, shaped and influenced his philosophy;   But Figal didn't say that. Figal said his notebooks were anti-semitic and he didn't want to associate his name with an anti-semite, which is understandable.    this was already something said about Being and Time   Heidegger didn't join the Nazi party until 1933, well after Being and Time (or at least what he had finished of it) was published. Figal himself acknowledges this (from the Daily Nous article which the c-t.com article cites): ""Figal also emphasizes the difference between Heidegger’s earlier work (i.e. up to an including Being and Time) and the mid-1930s.""    It's like trying to separate...Kierkegaard from his Christianity   Unrelated, but I'd like to think that if you did this successfully you'd get some kind of virtue ethics."
CriticalTheory,2t9osp,breadrock,3,Fri Jan 23 04:43:29 2015 UTC,"I would concur - unless a persons work is explicitly racist/homophobic/sexist etc then you should still be able to study it without being associated with any personal views the author may hold.  Otherwise it is rather cutting off your nose to spite your face.  Man cures cancer but hates blacks?  Lets ignore his work?   Though at the same time, you also have to judge the value of their work compared to what they did.  Thus Heidegger's work is still of interest and value, whilst say, to invoke Godwin, Hitlers art is not good enough or of enough value to overtake what he did (though again, if he had cured cancer then would be able to ignore it?  A lot of scientists were ex-nazis).  Ill stop waffling now..."

I am familiar with the concept of a noosphere, but noopolitics is less explored.  Anyone out in Redditland want to take a stab at defining it or explaining a bit?"
CriticalTheory,2sve2p,ocherthulu,3,Mon Jan 19 07:51:58 2015 UTC,"So on a very basic level Noopolitics is, on my reading, a play on words. It's a combination of of Nou in nouveau (meaning new in French) and Noo coming from the Greek Nous (meaning mind/spirit/intellect etc.) It's Stiegler's argument for a new kind of politics that is also the politics of the Nous; of the mind.   The best way of achieving this is through understanding and utilising the pharmacological nature of technology - which Stiegler argues is inherent in us as humans, as we naturally seek to externalise our knowledge into objects 'ourselves'.  The technological Pharmakon inherently has the ability to be cure to it's own poison. So for any possible malaise that our over reliance on desire driven technologies causes, the cure is already within that particular techonology, we just need to switch the type of desire from destructive (i.e. consumerist) to constructive.  Social networks are one of the best examples of this. They allow the user direct participation in their own individuation and therefore our own collective individuation - the individuation of each individual understanding that they being individuated as a whole - this is quite a tricky/complicated idea.  The Noopolitics that he's referring to then is a politics of generalised participation within the political sphere - and not only participation but understanding of the importance of that participation (the 'Nou'-politics) - this is something that is only now becoming capable through the interconnectivity of human ideas which are facilitated through the development of social digital technologies (i.e. social media).  I'm sorry if this was a bit of a bad/rushed explanation but I'm pretty tired! If you need any clarification on anything I'll try and help tomorrow."
CriticalTheory,2sve2p,ocherthulu,1 point,Tue Jan 20 00:46:00 2015 UTC,"thank you, this is extremely helpful as well as thought provoking.  your description is somewhat reminiscent of Axel Bruns' concepts of ""produsage,"" or ""participatory convergence""  would noopolitics be limited only to technology, or could it bet reminiscent of Axel Bruns' concepts of ""produsage,"" or ""participatory convergence"""
CriticalTheory,2sve2p,ocherthulu,3,Tue Jan 20 01:00:37 2015 UTC,"No problem. Yes precisely, I mean I'm not sure if Stiegler himself makes the connection but theres definitely an overlap. Here's a great interview that outlines his thoughts towards opensource software etc. I can't remember how much depth it goes into but it was great when I was starting to get to grips with his thought.  http://krisis.eu/content/2011-1/krisis-2011-1-05-lemmens.pdf  In relation to the second point, for Stiegler it is in relation to technology but Stiegler understands technology slightly differently to our general conception of it. Again this is a pretty in depth analysis that's outlined initially in Technics and Time 1 but i'll try and summarise.  Stiegler sees man, as a species, as being fundamentally 'technical'; that is fundamentally linked to a process of technicisation. This process can refer to any externalisation of human consciousness into outer objects. A basic example may be the trace of knowledge that an early hominid may put into a flint arrowhead. The knowledge of the process of breaking the flint and creating a sharp object is PRESERVED in the object itself. This object then preserves knowledge of human understand OUTSIDE of the human brain, Stiegler calls this our third kind of memory (separate from out personal memory, and the genetic memory of our ancestors.)   And this reasoning can be extended to any form of human created exteriorisation, be it a primitive tool or a complex computer system. All of these things FUNDAMENTALLY serve as part of our own exist as humans and thinking beings. This process is one of the things that essentially separates us from other animals.   So coming back to your point, noopolitics is probably not just limited to technology, but can extent to the WHOLE technical realm/sphere which defines humanity from its very inception. Technology as we see (i.e. computers/industrial tools etc) is just a small part of our process of techinicisation which has been apparent from the start of humanity. Since the industrial revolution this process has led us to a state of repressed desires, we've been limited by the oppressive systems of the culture industry described by Adorno and Horkheimer into a state of disinterest, disengagement and a disassociation with politics - and indeed with our interactions with other humans in general.   What social networks allow is the transindividuation (again another dense concept - but generally means the understanding of societies collective individuation through their own individuation - in fact I'd need to read up on the details of this as it's a bit tricky) of our culture. So yes, the produsage that Bruns describes fits quite well in that category as far as I understand it, I may be wrong though!   If you - OR ANY OTHER REDDITORS - are interested in this stuff check out this video, it's really good to get a grounding on what the hell Stiegler's on about, though it doesn't go into his later stuff about social media etc. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymtnUDAOEWc"

From a vaguely far-right perspective, I notice that grievance politics and consumerist complaints appeal to similar emotions. In both cases, there is a sense that an institution has failed to fulfill the [citizen|consumer's] authentic wishes. And in both cases, the person fails to notice that his/her honestly felt wishes were originally suggested by the institution.  Should advertisements show more minorities? Answer: why is it normalized that advertisements ought to matter to minorities?  An article asks, should feminists wear makeup? Answer: why should feminists need an article to decide whether to feel good about makeup?  Have microtransactions ruined gaming? But if microtransactions are the result of a free market, are you willing to make a principled anti-market argument that amounts to more than whining?  So on, and so forth.  From both a consumerist and progressive standpoint, a institution has failed -- failed to manage expectations, that is. The golden goose has allowed itself to be spotted, and now it runs in fear. As in the movie Inception, suggestibility gets out of hand and destroys its source.  A little bit of behavioral economics can show that our stated preferences do not match our revealed preferences. Companies take advantage of this by appearing to fulfill the former while actually fulfilling the latter. Sooner or later, a consumer looks behind the curtain: ""Oh no, Google collects my personal data, I feel violated, now I really know better what I want, time to use DuckDuckGo instead."" ... But would the expectation of a good search engine be possible without Google's intrusiveness.  To a leftist (which I am not), you should be concerned about what kinds of mindsets are (in)capable of fighting neoliberalism.

CriticalTheory,2sjbqq,wecanspeaktothedead,2,Thu Jan 15 18:04:31 2015 UTC,"to paraphrase some of the article:  Movies are increasing dominated by franchises and super-franchises. Not only are there trilogies of movies about certain heroes (like the orginal 3 star wars movies or the Nolan Batman movies), but within the Marvel universe, for instance, franchises become bound together with movies like The Avengers and then all start to set-up each other.   The viewer is driven by a desire to know what happens next for these characters and the universe they inhabit. There will never be an ""Ultimate Showdown."" These movies are made with the next movie, the next 6 movies, in mind.   Long off-hand Commentary:  I'm reminded of how we set up ideological franchises, so to speak. The United States, for instance, can be posited as the highest nation with the duty to bring freedom to the rest of the world. Our stage of believing this corresponds to our desire to see the next Batman movie, or care about Batman.   We then see what happens in the mirror of the ideological fantasy we have created. The effort to ""humanize"" the superhero parallels our increasingly complex conceptions of the world. The power is fallen, internally divided, emotionally disturbed.   Still, watching Batman will never let us ""understand"" America. The movies are engrossing partially because they are made to be socially relevant, but they are also a ""waste of time"" if we don't move from contemplating representations to thinking about our own desire. Contemplating the movies ""too long"" mirrors our tendency to flee from immediate experience ourselves into the search for an accurate representation of what we are.   So we're caught up in what the next installments of the enfranchisement of history will be, so to speak. What will happen between ISIS and USA? Two epic warriors, two enter, only one will live... at the same time, we can have the impression that this won't really matter for us: we will watch it on the news, but we can't imagine our daily reality really changing.    What we watch will eventually hit home to us. The explosions will not be on a screen but right in front of us. We will not be afraid for the hero, but afraid for ourselves. In fact, we could assume this radical state of not knowing what to do, what we want, at any point. Instead we are fascinated by the internal and external representations of our being drawn into the abyss."

CriticalTheory,2sffwj,Qwill2,1 point,Wed Jan 14 19:03:13 2015 UTC,"This is a nice article. it was a nice companion piece to the superhero/schizophrenia article.   I think the best example right now is the ""environmental crisis."" It's something that affects everyone, but some people are more insulated from its negative effects. Nevertheless, they may be affected later, or else devise means of protecting themselves.   I haven't read the Marx but I know he was looking at the tendency of economic crises in the expansion of capitalism. His point was that there is an antagonism within capitalism which makes these crises perhaps inevitable, and certainly determined by the functioning of capitalism.   I think the point here is that there is always a crisis. Just think, for some people in the world today, they are being lined up and shot, or starving to death or dying of disease, brutally mistreated. What sense is there in saying to this person, there is an economic crisis in America, it's a pretty big deal. There response would be a justified: why should I care about so-called crisis when I am already in the lowest state in which I can be?  Because of this, immanent to the contemplation of a particular crisis is the political question of the definition of crises and the designation of crises as crises.   So there is the dimension of the crisis for capital, as well as how capitalism is itself a crisis.   The gesture to the idea of crisis is a means of saying ""it is all open. Nothing is written."" When the economy collapses and no one knows what's going on, we may be more free, since we will no longer be constrained to what we think should happen, which is no longer possible.  The last section reminds me of the end of Zizek's 2014 book Absolute Recoil. He's writing that the subject, the partial reality, exists because of an inability of being to just be being. Not only can there not be the absolute thing, there can also not be nothing. IE I can never find my true desire, nor can I not desire."

CriticalTheory,2s3l03,easydownloadhelp,3,Sun Jan 11 22:01:30 2015 UTC,"On the first part--language and culture shaping an individual's identity--I'd say that's almost self-evidently true. Language is one of the most important and immediate tools humans use for social interaction, so it follows that language is the foundation of many forms of identity construction.   Similarly, culture, aside from being heavily composed of language, provides symbols, icons, images and collections of linguistic specific tropes: grammars, phrases proverbs and so on, which give more specific and local forms to the way we communicate.   (TL;DR Language and culture are lenses for nearly all human interaction, and so it follows they are lenses for identity construction)  As for protecting the individual against domination, I don't think that's a yes/no issue. Language and culture create new ways for us to act, interact and understand ourselves, but they also provide the basis for repression and domination at the same time.  For example many of the cultural norms present within Western liberal societies--individuality, ambition, meritocracy--allow us to navigate the world in headstrong ways, to have a sense of self-ownership over what we do. But at the same time this kind of individualism means we internalise many problems that are at least in part structural, that we blame ourselves for domination that comes from outside us or due to inadequate social ordering. Similarly ambition is ambition of a certain kind: economic ambition, the desire to be independent and produce value--but only within existing structures of work and consumption, which are arguably highly centralised and contain multiple levels of domination.   I can think of other immediate exmples regarding gender, religion, subcultures etc. where I'd say culture and language are pretty much a double edged sword in terms of protecting against domination.  (TL;DR Language and Culture give us the power to navigate the world, but this navigation can both reproduce and challenge social domination)"

He argues that a specific form of whiteness emerged in Canada that was heavily influenced by Britishness. Examining four allegorical figures that recur in a wide range of Canadian writings between 1820 and 1950 – the Loyalist fratricide, the enterprising Scottish orphan, the muscular Christian, and the maturing colonial son – Coleman outlines a genealogy of Canadian whiteness that remains powerfully influential in Canadian thinking to this day."

CriticalTheory,2raasq,NewAlexandria,10,Sun Jan 4 15:10:03 2015 UTC,"The sudden popularity of eating booty brings an array of questions to the fore—Is this a 'queering' of straight sex?   Only if you have to put a label on it.   The inherent ridiculousness of ""real niggas eat booty"" aside, Gates tapped into something with his comments.   Something that you won't understand as long as you keep saying shit like that.    While hip-hop culture's varying portrayals and performances of masculinity are often criticized as being regressive and restrictive—particularly when it comes to sex—the recently popularity of ""eating booty"" among rappers and rap-fans demonstrates the ways that hip-hop can be a space for progressive, even transgressive discussions about black pleasure, masculinity and sexuality.    I just kind of resent the idea that this is an inherently liberating social practice. Yes the anus is the most repulsive part of the body in popular imagination but how long will it be until SJW's start complaining that heterosexual men eating booty is sexual gentrification? Or how long will it be until heterosexual men start boasting about their booty eating in order to show dominance over those who don't? What, you don't eat the booty? What are you, some kind of faggot? The anus is considered disgusting so in general ahem on the whole I'm in favor of the trend (you know, flows of desire and so on), but it could just as easily be recoded back to another sexual act that one ""does"" with implications about who you are and what type of person you are. I mean, come on, we're not talking about ending the subject-object divide here, and if you still see the point of eating booty to make your partner satisfied then you can still be treating her as a an object. I don't see this practice as any more liberating than supermanning a ho, both using objects for what they ""aren't meant for"". And these vague hip hop generalizations are cheap ethnographic work. Disgustingly cheap. This is what you would turn in as a lazy research proposal before you go out and actually do fieldwork.   In closing, whether or not something is liberating seems to change very quickly, and this seems like cheap analysis. Also in general I doubt that Gawker is a good source of shitting-your-pants-good critical theory. Maybe I just don't see it."

The idea that women's bodies aren't objects for male consumption, or that telling women that they're not good enough for Reason A rather than Reason B isn't actually an achievement, remains a mere distraction from the main narrative, which is that big butts are in so women can add that to their checklist of things to either work for, pine for, or feel inferior about, so long as they don't ever feel like the shape of their body is fine and natural and also completely unconnected from their worth as a human."

CriticalTheory,2pdft5,mrFranzy,4,Mon Dec 15 16:58:45 2014 UTC,"From Delillo's White Noise:   Several days later Murray asked me about a tourist attraction known as the most photographed barn in America.  We drove 22 miles into the country around Farmington.  There were meadows and apple orchards.  White fences trailed through the rolling fields.  Soon the sign started appearing.  THE MOST PHOTOGRAPHED BARN IN AMERICA.  We counted five signs before we reached the site.  There were 40 cars and a tour bus in the makeshift lot.  We walked along a cowpath to the slightly elevated spot set aside for viewing and photographing.  All the people had cameras; some had tripods, telephoto lenses, filter kits.  A man in a booth sold postcards and slides -- pictures of the barn taken from the elevated spot.  We stood near a grove of trees and watched the photographers.  Murray maintained a prolonged silence, occasionally scrawling some notes in a little book.   ""No one sees the barn,"" he said finally.   A long silence followed.   ""Once you've seen the signs about the barn, it becomes impossible to see the barn.""  He fell silent once more.  People with cameras left the elevated site, replaced by others.  ""We're not here to capture an image, we're here to maintain one. Every photograph reinforces the aura.  Can you feel it, Jack? An accumulation of nameless energies.""   There was an extended silence.  The man in the booth sold postcards and slides.   ""Being here is a kind of spiritual surrender.  We see only what the others see.  The thousands who were here in the past, those who will come in the future.  We've agreed to be part of a collective perception.  It literally colors our vision.  A religious experience in a way, like all tourism.""   Another silence ensued.   ""They are taking pictures of taking pictures,"" he said.   He did not speak for a while.  We listened to the incessant clicking of shutter release buttons, the rustling crank of levers that advanced the film.   ""What was the barn like before it was photographed?"" he said.  ""What did it look like, how was it different from the other barns, how was it similar to other barns?""   You might think of a photograph of the barn as a perfect simulation, but the signs pointing to the most photographed barn, the postcards and slides you can buy of the most photographed barn, the people taking pictures of the most photographed barn, the pictures of pictures of the most photographed barn, these are all constituent parts of Baudrillard's simulacrum. These are signs which have lost their way, their referents buried."

CriticalTheory,2pdft5,ocherthulu,4,Mon Dec 15 23:10:31 2014 UTC,"as I understand it, simulation is the way that our postindustrial societies have agreed to build a cultural lexicon out of agreed upon copies of formerly real things.  For example, the imprint of Sacajawea on the dollar coins (in the US) several years back.  Sacajawea is a symbolic icon that conjures up indian-ness and cooperation among tribes etc.  The US Treasury chose this symbolic vehicle for its new dollar coins, perhaps in an effort to move beyond dead presidents as its cultural frame of reference.  This is an act purely in the symbolic sense, nothing real has happened between Indian/Native American tribes and the US government other than the substitution of a dead president for a dead indian.  The simulacra would be many more steps removed from this and would encompass the incredulous nature of postmodern sciences on the value of currency without a gold-standaed, a critique of using ""in god we trust"" since 1950, and the claims that currency is disconnected from labor in all material ways.  In this sense (might not be great example though), the sign-reality conversion would have taken place when we agreed that money equals labor, the sign-sign conversion occurs when the symbolic plane has been rewired and finally, the sign-signified collapse points to the bankrupt notion of currency in its totality.    put more simply, the simulation still has some grounding in reality--there is a connection between symbols and material things, but the simulacrum is where symbols become ""free floating"" and no longer have clear referents in either the symbolic or the material."
CriticalTheory,2p7ytk,Rizzpooch,7,Sun Dec 14 01:08:25 2014 UTC,"A way I've always found helpful to think of Benjamin's messianic time is in terms of the contrast between 'history' and 'the time of the now', or as Benjamin puts it, “The way it really was” vs. “seizing hold of a memory as it flashes up in danger.”  Roughly, from the point of view of history, time is given a sense in terms of its narration; for historicism the past is determined as a series of events leading up to the present, whereas for the Messianic approach, the past’s presence as a memory is key.  First of all, it is key in the sense that it is the past for a determinate conflict in the present that is at issue, and second it is key because it is specifically in the form of a memory that entails the possibility of losing everything. To remember is always to remember a tradition, a collective memory, but the relation to tradition is what is in part at issue; historicism reifies the continuity of the tradition, and as such, “how it really was” as it leads up to “how it is;” this places the tradition into the hands of the ruling class, or whoever determines ‘how it really is.’ The Messianic, on the other hand, return’s to the tradition’s dead, to the hope of what could have been otherwise in the past in order to resuscitate this hope, to re-activate it.  Where 'history', then, narrates a past, present, and future, the messianic 'now' involves the mobilization of elements that refuse to be narrativized. One doesn't become the Angel of history, but one is related to the Angel insofar as the Angel gives you the messianic identity of history; history is a series of impositions of narration upon the now, a narration that involves the imposition of suffering insofar as that order is always an 'enforced' order. So the Angel sees a piling up of disasters rather than progress, and the messianic approach to time is all about weaponizing those non-historical, non-narrated elements against 'history.'  In what sense is that messianic? In the sense that it's about changing the significance of the past, raising the dead in a certain sense. What we can be understood to lack in the present is bound up with the specific contingencies of our life: what could have gone one way, but didn’t; outcomes that went unrealized. The past, then, is a time not just of bare occurences, but of possibilities realized or unrealized; and those unrealized possibilities may call out to us as failures, as injustices, ones which demand correction. These unrealized possibilities in the past endow us with a weak Messianic power in the sense that, while we cannot go back to the past, we inherit in some sense the possibility for those failures and injustices, those unrealized potentialities, to amount to something. Thus we are endowed with the power, but the power belongs to the past; it is a claim the past makes on us, a power but also a responsibility.  EDIT: sorry if this is, like, really incoherent. writing this on a quick break from term papers."

CriticalTheory,2p1lfc,Chisaku,1 point,Sun Dec 14 08:36:50 2014 UTC,"Cabinet Magazine had an issue five years ago devoted to dust. It's not exactly theory but it's not exactly not theory, either. Check it out.  From the first relevant essay:   This vision of the recent past as already shrouded in dust acquires, in the works of a more dialectically or perversely inclined Modernism, the lineaments of the fantastic or of an oddly eroticized appreciation of decay. In the section of the Arcades Project entitled “Boredom, Eternal Return,” Walter Benjamin briefly refers to the role of dust in the nineteenth-century interior, a substance at once magical and mundane: “Plush as dust collector. Mystery of dustmotes playing in the sunlight. Dust and the ‘best room.’ ... Other arrangements to stir up dust: the trains of dresses.” In the decaying Paris arcades—the furred arteries of the modern city—dust both occludes and outlines the once-novel commodity and its slow desuetude. For Marcel Proust, too, dust was simultaneously to be feared (in the form of the lime-tree pollen that brought on his asthma, or the choking fumes of the coal fire in his bedroom) and welcomed for the physical and aesthetic veil it cast about him as he wrote; Proust lived his last decade in a cloud of medicinal powders, propped up among material remnants of his past—photographs, books, and furniture—that he refused to allow his servants to dust. And a few years after Proust’s death, in the pages of his journal Documents, Georges Bataille pointed out that the dominion of dust in legend and reality had not yet been properly acknowledged:   The storytellers have not realised that the Sleeping Beauty would have awoken covered in a thick layer of dust; nor have they envisaged the sinister spiders’ webs that would have been torn apart at the first movement of her red tresses. Meanwhile dismal sheets of dust constantly invade earthly habitations and uniformly defile them: as if it were a matter of making ready attics and old rooms for the imminent occupation of the obsessions, phantoms, spectres that the decayed odour of old dust nourishes and intoxicates. When plump young girls, “maids of all work,” arm themselves each morning with a large feather-duster or even a vacuum-cleaner, they are perhaps not completely unaware that they are contributing every bit as much as the most positivist of scientists to dispelling the injurious phantoms that cleanliness and logic abhor.  Dust, Bataille suggests, may one day gain the upper hand over domestic servants; he pictures a city in which dust has triumphed, “invading the immense ruins of abandoned buildings, deserted dockyards.” In fact, Bataille hints in a fragment entitled “Débâcle,” we may already be living in this grotesque and desiccated dustscape."

CriticalTheory,2ow1w1,EugeneLang,9,Wed Dec 10 19:02:09 2014 UTC,"The question of the state is omnipresent in your book. Whoever critiques its raison d’être is allegedly a liberal. But isn’t that forgetting the traditions of anarchism and Marxism, from Bakunin to Lenin? Aren’t you overlooking that dimension?   This is an interesting question and the answer was a bit off-putting. Were there really no considerable engagements by anarchists and anti-state Marxists in the post-War era worth considering? Deleuze and Guattari have been read in a quasi-anarchist manner for a while now and we know without a doubt that Foucault was familiar with their philosophy. Mario Tronti would likely have been at least a little familiar to Foucault as well. Not to mention the most obvious critiques coming from the Situationists.   When Foucault goes so far as to say it’s “clear that there is hardly any sense in speaking of a ‘right to health,’” and asks, “should a society seek to satisfy individuals’ need for health? And can those individuals legitimately demand the satisfaction of those needs?” we are no longer really within the anarchist register.   I can't even begin to address this. How is this outside the anarchist ""register?"""
CriticalTheory,2ow1w1,annoyingbeggar,5,Wed Dec 10 21:13:13 2014 UTC,"“didn’t Foucault make it possible to bring into the light all these people who had until then been ignored by orthodox Marxism — which had only been able to see economic relations?”   yes. But why are 'they' marginal in the first place, and what are they marginal to. This kind of approach leads to a circularity wherein those who are marginal to the process of capital accumulation, are realised as so, but in that fact only in relation to capital still. You cannot at the same time note power 'marginalises' these groups whilst also stress their importance (to power). The debris of human bodies that's laid to waste in the storm of capital accumulation. Marxism focuses on socio-economic relations because they are the most important to power; they represent the heart, at the same time the strongest and weakest point. You cannot escape that fact hence even 'Foucaultians' talk of 'marginal'. Marginal to what? Marginal to 'the norm', marginal to capitalist social-relations, those who don't – for whatever reason – fit into the standard relations of domination and exploitation.    “He clearly removed from the shadows a whole spectrum of oppressions that had been invisible before.”   they were only removed from the shadows for intellectuals, as objects of study. In reality these groups still exist in 'the shadows', as marginal.   when the interviewee of this piece says  'we should “build on what already exists,”' it sounds like he's the neoliberal   would find its outlet in the “struggles against marginalization” of ethnic or social minorities. The lumpenproletariat (or the “new plebeians,” to use Foucault’s term) acquired a new popularity and was now seen as a genuinely revolutionary subject.   For one 'lumpenproletariat' is itself one created by Karl Marx which rather dispels this fanciful notion that this 'class' of peoples was never noticed, analysed or questioned. The real problem is that the “struggles against marginalisation” tend to be struggles to become 'not-marginal', i.e. to become part of the norm. As such this isn't a revolutionary act but one of reproduction and perpetuation; the aim being only to extend what's normal, rather than destroying social beliefs and practice that enforce a 'norm' upon different individuals, all that's wanted is to be 'accepted'. This lacks the capacity to remove alienating identities, since it merely re-situates them. That can no doubt be a big change (the acceptance of homosexuals for example), but it's not revolutionary in the sense that the process by which groups are/become marginalises, and the power at the centre, had remained untouched.    For these authors, the problem is thus no longer so much exploitation, but rather power, and modern forms of domination.   The author lumps together lots of theorists in one here. But – generalising – the problem with a focus on domination is it's transformation into a fetish, as if the 'goal' of modern society and it's institutions was domination, when in reality it's exploitation. The domination in the workplace is but a mean to a good rate of exploitation, such a relation is obvious if we look at rates/degrees of domination and it's change over time (as a workplace is required to be more oppressive when competition is greater and there's a declining rate of profit, see compound system in Southern Africa for example). That's not to say studying domination isn't useful, it allows us to study those institutions who – through a division of labour – perform social functions specialised in domination. Such a division decouples an immediate relationship between exploitation and domination to gain effectiveness at the latter, but such a relationship remains. If we study 'domination' in the abstract we lose the question 'what is it all for?', why lock people up in mental institutions or prisons at all? Simply for the sake of domination for it's own ends. And ends up with a bad history of why these things came to be (such as the state) in a given epoch.  I definitely agree that the struggles of those generally ignore by mainstream labour and social movements have the capacity to be revolutionary more than those already integrated (i.e. unions), but at the same time they have the tendency to simply want integration. This has always been the crucial question. For example, blacks in the west as subjected to extra-economic violence and oppression, have the potential – unlike those white workers who don't experience this – to attack the system on a deeper level, the root of why blacks are required to be outside of history, their fate decided. But at the same time there's the tendency to become just like white workers, merely to be exploited equally instead of a liberation and a revolution that would have freed both workers."

Ain't I A Woman? is a pretty seminal text as far as black feminism goes. I also really love her essay Eating the Other, a fantastic and fairly accessible discussion of otherness and white supremacy in commodity culture.  Someone else mentioned Frantz Fanon, and I'd highly recommend The Wretched of the Earth, a text on the psychological impact of colonialism on the colonized peoples.   Cornel West is worth checking out. He often approaches racial issues with a sort of historical materialism, a la Marx. Race Matters is, I think, his sort of preeminent text, but I've only read a few scattered essays by West.  It might even be worthwhile to examine some of MLK's more obscure writings. Everyone knows about five minutes of the ""I Have a Dream"" speech, but few people are aware of his writings on war, economics, class conflict, etc.  Lastly, (white) authors like Richard Dyer and Theodor W. Allen look at the construction of whiteness and white supremacy by way of examining historical visual and literary cultures; understanding the history of white supremacy is pretty crucial to understanding the historical and contemporary positions non-whites occupy in literary culture.  Also, not quite what you asked for, but if you're interested in race and literary theory, it would be worth checking out the work of Edward Said, specifically Orientalism; Nationalism, Colonialism, and Literature: Yeats and Decolonization; Culture and Imperialism.  Sorry if these aren't really what you're looking for. I'd say of the authors I mentioned, hooks, West, Dyer, and Said might be most relevant to your interests."

CriticalTheory,2o31nq,Buffalo__Buffalo,1 point,Wed Dec 10 03:49:31 2014 UTC,"The critique of the myth of progress has many presumptions. Firstly, just because enlightenment idea of progress was linear, unidirectional and considered to be inevitable doesn't mean that all concepts of progress will be based on that. The models of a linear line and a circle were given to contrast the progress concept with change concept. But here's an alternate model: A spiral. Many 'A' to 'B' points. Multiple directions of progress. Doesn't necessarily need to be unidirectional (if a goal doesn't yield results then go back to the centre and pursue another 'arm' of the circle).  The idea of progress is simply this : things can get better.  Now I know many PoMo thinkers will counter argue with their bland subjectivist arguments but subjectivism doesn't necessarily negate progress.  Progress means that compared to previous times you experience a better quality of life now. The quality assessment can be subjective, but this subjectivity doesn't negate the argument as such. Also, just because you think subjectively doesn't necessarily mean you will experience the world as subjectively. Just because one thinks starvation, thirst, lack of physical security etc. doesn't really cause unhappiness or suffering doesn't mean that when they actually experience those conditions the physical suffering will disappear. There is a difference  between thought and lived experience.  Simple things like food, water, shelter, clothing etc. can be markers of progress. Referring to the article, it says that progress has only occurred in the west, but the point is somewhere it ACCEPTS that it has occurred. Thus, SOME notion of progress is retained."
CriticalTheory,2o31nq,mumra71294,3,Wed Dec 3 12:02:00 2014 UTC,"I was thinking about this too but...  ""Simple things like food, water, shelter, clothing etc. can be markers of progress."" Maybe progress in terms of standards of living, but none of those can be markers of progress toward peace, which seems to be the point of the article. It is possible to have a great economic scenario even in the midst of massive humanitarian crises. GDP and other economic markers does not equal progress in the humanist/enlightenment sense of the word (e.g., as rationality or Truth).   ""Progress means that compared to previous times you experience a better quality of life now."" That is actually not what progress means...'progress' is just a term used to denote movement relative to an end goal. Thus you can make progress while still making everyone's life shittier, if that was your end goal.   Furthermore, a spiral is still a line, just a curved one. There is a beginning and an end to a spiral - that doesn't circumvent the notion of progress as forward moving. It's an interesting attempt at a work around, but in the end you're just positing a very 'inefficient' line. Still doesn't seem to change the course of the author's argument..."
CriticalTheory,2o31nq,mumra71294,1 point,Wed Dec 3 21:01:55 2014 UTC,"Well,  1) Yes the economic markers are easier to quantify and other humanitarian matters aren't. My point being the relationship between better security and peace does have something to do with the basics. I am not saying the basics can give you a perfect measure.  2) If we can identify violence then we can identify peace. The author quotes shootings on the streets and schools as an example of first world violence. My point is if shootings go down then it is SOME indication of peace in SOME respect. I am not saying it's the ultimate measure and I don't intend to negate the subjective aspect of such attempts to measure human feelings and happiness. But it's some indicator nonetheless. And we NEED indicators whatever anyone says. I mean if someone is seriously trying to imply that there is no difference between an ISIS controlled syria where people are being beheaded and raped in astonishing numbers and lets say a place like Sweden or any other country where they aren't going through a (civil) war then I don't think the world needs to take that seriously. This kind of argument is a shabby attempt to negate all attempts to improve human living conditions where it is frankly pathetic and most of these arguments come from first world intellectuals who are safely and comfortably locked into their ivory towers. Countries which are said to be in the third world desperately need a direction to improve their lives and the negation of any possibility of direction is simply a hyper-exaggeration.   3) When I talked about progress I specifically talked in the context of humanistic progress whose ultimate aim is human happiness. And the spiral is a collection of A to B points but it's multiple, multi-directional and is not a linear model. Moreover there is no reason why there can't be inter-connected spirals. I don't see the problem with this model as it addresses almost all the so called short-comings of the linear, presumably Enlightenment model of progress. Just because spiral is made of lines doesn't mean that it has the same characteristics of a line. Hence, the critique of the linear line model doesn't really apply to a spiral. Also, I don't intend the model to be a static one. The spiral also gives the feeling of movement and the model itself can develop new points and lines depending on the situation. The strength of the spiral is that there is some direction to move to but its multiple and allows the space to actually change directions and unlike the circle you don't necessarily come back to the point from where you started while having that choice of coming back."

Normally people would talk in order to understand each other and reach consensus regarding their plans and interests. Yet, their use of language may as well be distorted, leading to manipulation and persuasion of others, even if they don't consciously intend this. This is called systematic distortion of communication, where systematic stands for the System (as opposed to the Lifeworld) - the state bureaucracy, the corporate world and other spheres where language is used mostly in an instrumental manner (giving orders, bargaining). These distortions are almost ubiquitous, and there needs to be a special space where people may get rid themselves of these learned ways to distort communication.

But when it comes to the details of his arguments, I don’t always find them as convincing as I would like.  Specifically, he relies too much on a set of simple oppositions: in a world of manifest injustice, what Žižek looks for is a Leninist decisiveness in political action, which he has come to ally (in books like this) with a Pauline Christian love of “the act.” In opposition to these, he trots out a long line of caricatured opponents and ideological ersatzes, from complacent liberal multiculturalism to obsessive ecology to “New Age spiritualisms,” “neo-paganisms,” “Western Buddhism,” “gnosticism” (though that one plays a somewhat different role in his arguments), and some of the ideas of philosophical rivals like Gilles Deleuze and the “weak” onto-theologies of Gianni Vattimo and John Caputo — most of which he treats less in their own right than for the ways they are used and abused by the broader culture."

Marxist analysis can be applied to countless works of culture or art so you will need to be specific about the reasons why you would choose to apply Marxism to your choices in order for the arguments you will eventually chose to unpack these films with to be convincing."
CriticalTheory,2m4nds,ocherthulu,2,Fri Nov 14 00:07:16 2014 UTC,My thoughts on that question are that each film arguably represents a signifcant example of Marxist theory within its respective time. As well as this each film could be seen through the lens of Marxism and its relationship to the dystopian world each film is set in.  I was thinking of maybe choosing a chapter or specific work of Marx and argue that through the lens of Marxist theory each film represents the fear of the dystopia. The fear of where society in its respective time may be heading. Whether that is a conscious or subconscious thought of each director is open for debate.
CriticalTheory,2m4nds,mice_are_nice,2,Fri Nov 14 22:35:14 2014 UTC,"In my view, this approach might leave your analyses too vague and unfocused. For the marks, you'll need to convince the reader that a specific area of Marxist theory will be as a good as necessary in order to unpack the subtext of the film -- not just ""arguably represents"".   Also, the worlds of both films, viewed through a Marxist lens, are dystopias - no argument. Your analyses should instead attempt to show why and how they are such.   Example: ELYSIUM (like DISTRICT 9) depicts a world where an extreme form of apartheid exists, manifested by the high social-privilege required in order to access healthcare, with absolutely no official means to challenge the status quo. Your analysis could, for example, refer to David Harvey's Marxist/Lefebvrian work on the rights to the city/citizenship/borders/etc, etc,."

I can't recall anyone (there might be some, but not to my recollection, perhaps Habermas?) who view culture as something that is detached from the current hegemony. That is, you cannot see culture as something that in western culture is detached from capitalism (Culture Industry for instance), and because the core of culture is capital and exchange of goods, culture will never change at its core.  That being said, scholars who believe in the potential of revolution or reform of capitalist society often see culture as the place where the first steps must be taken. A change in culture means a change in ideology because culture IS the way ideology comes to life. (Stuart Hall for instance, who builds on Gramsci)  Problem of viewing culture as a negative thing? My answer would be, that  a change in ideology would have to emerge through culture. That is where potential for change lies.  Anyway, that's one interpretation at least.."

So, the visible way of doing things, which can linked somehow to the culture is a way we ""play out"" our subjectivity as in a certain ideology?   a change in ideology would have to emerge through culture.   I've been wondering about the priorities of culture vs. ideology. I'm, however, aware that both are probably overlapping with each other, which obviously makes the distinction hard to make. Personally I've thought that there is just 2 possible positions to address this problem. The one claimed by Zizek, minimal subject (there's none) or absolute subjectivity as in the social representatio theory (Serge Moscovici).  The world according to these positions is quite similar. The problem is that I can't still wrap my mind around the concept of how these 2 positions would differ in practice, (if there's difference at all)."

CriticalTheory,2kc35u,kinderdemon,5,Sun Oct 26 02:47:28 2014 UTC,"My understanding is that an object can be known and a subject cannot. For example, I cannot understand the totality of what it means to be someone else or how that external subject perceives reality and develops decision calculi from thier perception, so any attempt to manipulate that subject is necessarily a gamble.  An object on the other hand has 'set' definitions that articulate its being within the world, and therefore can be manipulated using something akin to a formula.  Baudrillard's full argument then is that signifyers and ideology (objects) have a reached a point where they overcode subjectivity, in that instead of creating authentic subjects based off intimate experiences with reality, individuals default to ideology to mediate how they encounter reality, which is an inversion of an authentic subject formation that would develop ideology by analyzing subjective experiences within reality. This is how the nature of hyperreality comes to invert the subject/object divide.  This is just my reading though, if this doesn't make sense to anyone please enlighten me."

However, ideology operates/exists on a different ""level"" than subject and object   I agree with you that Baud's use of ""manipulation/representation"" is on a metaphysical plane, not an actual one. I do not agree with your definition that an object is the same as ideology, I do not think it belongs in the duality of subject-object per se, but instead it is a mediating mechanism, an operation which comes into articulation between one or the other.   In my courses I tell my students that ideology is a framework for discourse, which is, a representational matrix that exists between subjects and objects. Both can be mediated through ideology but neither one are synonymous with it."

A classic example of subject object is civilization/nature. The self-conceptualization of the civilized subject breaks down upon realizing that it has invented the object, nature, to ground its thought. Nature doesn't exist the way we think it exists. Thus we see that we as subjects are to an extent determined by the objects by which we are seduced.   To me Baudrillard seems to advocate embracing being an object as a political strategy. What this says to me is focusing on how one is an object of transference and desire. Thus, for example, one wouldn't think ""oh dear, I will face negative consequences for this- better not!"" because the focus is not on my role as subject/ narrator of my own story. Instead, I am also a character in the story of the other.   ""The father is always already dead and always still alive."""
CriticalTheory,2k58ud,-mickomoo-,2,Thu Oct 23 23:27:34 2014 UTC,"“Identity politics” is commonly criticized for focusing on the narrowly personal at the expense of the structural, but such criticisms must be viewed with a skeptical eye. It would be ludicrous to argue that a person’s race, gender, or sexuality has no impact on his or her lived experiences; you might as well claim that social class doesn’t exist.    This isn't necessarily a valid counterargument. Surely critics of identity politics can admit to a systemic framework which uses/used notions of identity (gender, race, etc.) to oppress those people while at the same time criticizing identity politics for affirming these very identities according to the system's terms.   There should be a critical space which can both acknowledge the identities reified by legal infrastructure and aspire to overcoming those identities. Just because a legislator decided that you being a ""woman"" was important to who you are, doesn't mean you have to accept that it is important."

That said, I'd recommend reading ""Differance"" first -- if you don't like what he's up to there then you definitely won't want to read a whole book.  Finally, I'd recommend some Foucault. ""What Is Critique?"" is a fantastic introduction to his thought. From there your Foucaultian options are wide open, though I'm partial to Discipline and Punish.  P.S. (because I wrote finally already) I'm just getting into Deleuze now he's incredibly exciting."

I decided to leave Foucault off since, at my Uni, Foucault gets a lot of focus, like whole classes devoted to studying him, so I figure I will get enough of him at some point (I am only 3rd year in the USA)."

One way to cover the ""Lord and Bondsman"" section of Hegel is to read Kojeve's Introduction to the Reading of Hegel. It is wonderfully clarifying for how Hegel and psychoanalysis jive, especially in Lacan and to a lesser degree, Zizek. (Lacan and many influential French philosophers studied with Kojeve.)"

CriticalTheory,2jll03,neoliberaldaschund,3,Sun Oct 19 14:57:25 2014 UTC,"Yes, that was his intention, to systematize Historical Materialism in the same way Lacan did with Freud, i.e. to re-establish it on more modern foundations. That's why he rejected Hegel and introduced more structuralist readings of Marx.  I'd say he remained a materialist in the Marxian sense, in that he still cared about the analysis of the 'material conditions'. But despite this, most of his original contributions had very little to do with the workings of capitalism as an economic system. I'd say that the main ones were (1) the structuralist refashioning of Marx's core philosophical concepts (2) the 'interpellation' theory of Ideology. As passé as he is nowadays, I actually find his work very interesting and foundational.  Zizek, Laclau, Mouffe and the rest of the Post 'Marxists' took those two aspects of Althusser work, and rejected the economic part of Marxism. While they claim to be materialist (and, in a way, they are, in a kind of lacanian/kantian sense), they focused so much in Discourse analysis that I think their 'Marxism' is beyond recognition. That's why I said they were much more post-Althusserian than post Marxists. They did away with all of Marx's theory on Capital. Deleuze and Guattari did not.

There's exists a social reality masked by an ideology, and the role of science is to reveal this distortion, and make the true reality conscious.  As you said, Zizek's take is completely different. The Lacanian concept of the Real, defining it very roughly, is that which both precedes and resists symbolization. Therefore, reality in itself would be, by definition, beyond comprehension and unintelligible. I can clash with it, but it does not show itself (when it seems to show itself, it does so only through phenomenological appearance aka imagination) nor does it speak (only through symbolization). I think it could be compared to Kant's das Ding an sich   ""rather than being just a barrier to grasping the Real, this absence is itself revelatory of this register. To be more precise, as that which is foreign to Imaginary-Symbolic reality—this reality is the realm containing conscious apprehension, communicable significance, and the like—the Real is intrinsically elusive, resisting by nature capture in the comprehensibly meaningful formulations of concatenations of Imaginary-Symbolic signs. It is, as Lacan stresses again and again, an “impossibility” vis-à-vis reality."" Link   As you put it, Ideology would not be the glasses that prevent people from seeing reality as it truly is, but the distortion the reality itself. I'd only add: in so far reality appears to us as an intelligible order.  Edit: added a bit."

Is the only way for Barthes to construct a myth is through that 3 part signifier-signified-myth combo? Because as the author says, the underlying message of all advertising is to pursue satisfaction. Seems pretty mythical to me. Yes, it does seem to be more allegorical than mythical, but there's more than one way to skin a cat.   But more problems with their objections to Barthes, they say that late-capitalism is in the active stages of destroying all meaning.    As will be shown, there is no need to naturalize a mythical history at the end of history, no need to legitimize cultural values and meaning in a society bent on the destruction of all fixed meaning – in fact, such a project of mythologizing is actually counter to ‘project’ of late capitalism.   I'm skeptical about some of these grand claims about the project of capitalism is or it's intentions...we're speaking about capitalism like it has a will. There's no need to naturalize a mythical history at the end of history?! What about the end of history itself?! Ya missed that one!  It's very hard to define capitalism. We are talking about Barthes, okay, so maybe they meant that capitalism, in coming up with new things to sell, uncouples signifiers from signifieds, like now those boots mean something else so now you gotta buy something else. But certain signifiers are sticking around these days, the flag for instance. Or green bits of paper we keep in our wallets, those haven't lost meaning. (Shut up, bitcoin.) And yeah, capitalism constantly commodifies and changes the meaning of nearly everything, but some things stay the same and other things maintain the same cultural function when they do get commodified.   It just gets very tiring hearing grand proclamations from anti-capitalists like capitalism is the final boss, an evil, monolithic entity.

That debate rages on today – between those who believed an enlightened class have to “uncover” the oppression of the masses (the unconscious, the machinations of capital, etc), and those who see that resistance is everywhere around them in the status quo.

CriticalTheory,2ik9xp,analia_vu,1 point,Wed Oct 15 14:44:31 2014 UTC,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzrHwDOlTt8  Though it's worth pointing out that Chomsky himself was a big fan of the Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese Stalinists  http://www.mekong.net/cambodia/chomsky.htm#chiii   Describing the media coverage of Southeast Asia as a ""farce,"" Chomsky and Herman contrasted the grim reports on Vietnam by New York Times reporter Fox Butterfield with the with the much more favorable comments of the members of a handful of non-governmental groups. This, Chomsky and Herman asserted, was evidence of a campaign of disinformation:   ""The drab view of contemporary Vietnam provided by Butterfield and the establishment press helps to sustain the desired rewriting of history, asserting as it does the sad results of Communist success and American failure. Well suited for these aims are tales of Communist atrocities, which not only prove the evils of communism but undermine the credibility of those who opposed the war and might interfere with future crusades for freedom.""(8)   Seeking to bolster their point, Chomsky and Herman examined three books on Cambodia: Murder of a Gentle Land, by John Barron and Anthony Paul, Ponchaud's Cambodge Annee Zero, and Cambodia: Starvation and Revolution, by George Hildebrand and Gareth Porter. Chomsky and Herman write:  ""The response to the three books under review nicely illustrates this selection process. Hildebrand and Porter present a carefully documented study of the destructive American impact on Cambodia and the success of the Cambodian revolutionaries in overcoming it, giving a very favorable picture of their programs and policies, based on a wide range of sources. Published last year, and well received by the journal of the Asia Society (Asia, March-April 1977), it has not been reviewed in the Times, New York Review or any mass-media publication, nor used as the basis for editorial comment, with one exception. The Wall Street Journal acknowledged its existence in an editorial entitled 'Cambodia Good Guys' (November 22, 1976), which dismissed contemptuously the very idea that the Khmer Rouge could play a constructive role, as well as the notion that the United States had a major hand in the destruction, death and turmoil of wartime and postwar Cambodia.""(9)  Hildebrand and Porter's book deserves examination. One simple fact provides a clue to the authors' sympathies: The book does not contain even a single sentence critical of the Khmer Rouge. Chomsky and Herman make no note of this: Just as Hildebrand and Porter had nothing negative to say about the Khmer Rouge, Chomsky and Herman had nothing negative to say about Hildebrand and Porter.  At only 124 pages, Starvation and Revolution is a slim volume. Describing the reports of atrocities in Cambodia as ""systematic process of mythmaking,""(10) Hildebrand and Porter present a glowing depiction of the Khmer Rouge. The authors assert that the charges of starvation in Cambodia are unfounded: ""It is the officially inspired propaganda of starvation for which no proof has been produced... Thus the starvation myth has come full circle to haunt its authors.""(11) The Khmer Rouge, according to Hildebrand and Porter, were rebuilding the country quite effectively, implementing a ""coherent, well-developed plan for developing the economy.""(12)  A few of the book's omissions should be noted. The book makes no mention of public executions. It makes no mention of the forcible separation of children from their families, no mention of the separation of husbands and wives, no mention of the repression of ethnic minorities, no mention of restrictions on travel, or the abolition of the mail system. Put simply, the book bears no earthly resemblance to the reality of communist Cambodia.  Hildebrand and Porter's claims regarding the evacuation of Phnom Penh are particularly galling:   ""The evacuation of Phnom Penh undoubtedly saved the lives of many thousands of Cambodians... what was portrayed as a destructive, backward-looking policy motivated by doctrinaire hatred was actually a rationally conceived strategy for dealing with the urgent problems that faced postwar Cambodia.""(13)   The remark is surely one of the most sordid fabrications within Porter and Hildebrand's work. There are a number of points which need to be made. First, all major towns and cities were evacuated, not just Phnom Penh. And this was not a new policy: As Ponchaud pointed out in Cambodia: Year Zero, ""ever since 1972 the guerrilla fighters had been sending all the inhabitants of the villages and towns they occupied into the forest to live, often burning their homes so that they would have nothing to come back to.""(14) Clearly, if the policy had been in place since 1972, it had nothing to do with a shortage of food inside Phnom Penh in 1975. Although most sources suggest that there was enough food in the capital for only about a week, Ponchaud, who was there, believes it was more likely that there was enough for a month. Several voluntary agencies and foreign countries offered aid, but the Khmer Rouge refused. This refusal suggests that the Khmer Rouge believed that starvation was less important than maintaining the purity and self-sufficiency of their revolution.  Whatever the reason for the exodus, how can its brutal nature be justified? Ben Kiernan, arguably the West's foremost authority on the Khmer Rouge, estimates that 20,000 people died in the evacuation of Phnom Penh.(15) How could evacuating hospitals possibly have saved lives? To quote Ponchaud's eyewitness account: ""I shall never forget one cripple who had neither hands nor feet, writhing along the ground like a severed worm, or a weeping father carrying his ten-year old daughter wrapped in a sheet tied around his neck like a sling, or the man with his foot dangling at the end of a leg to which it was attached by nothing but skin.""(16)  It is difficult to reconcile these words with descriptions of ""a rationally conceived strategy.""  Similarly, Hildebrand and Porter do not discuss the final siege of Phnom Penh, when the Khmer Rouge rained rockets and artillery down on the city every day. One would think that a description of the plight of civilians in the midst of a civil war might mention that they were being shelled on a daily basis.  By 1978, even Gareth Porter seemed to want to distance himself from the book. Interviewed by Ed Bradley for the CBS documentary ""What Happened to Cambodia,"" Porter's eyes dart back and forth when Bradley questions him about the Khmer Rouge regime. He casts his eyes down and stutters slightly. ""My... my only plea is for some degree of balance in assessing the human suffering that undoubtedly still exists in Cambodia.""(17)  It is frustrating that Chomsky and Herman do not note the obvious omissions in Hildebrand and Porter's book. Equally frustrating is their claim that the book is ""based on a wide range of sources.""(18)   Sophal Ear has some particularly sharp words for Chomsky  http://argumentsworthhaving.com/2014/03/09/cambodian-refugee-sophal-ear-vs-noam-chomsky/   Sophal Ear:  “Indeed, perhaps someday Chomsky will acknowledge his ‘honest errors’ in his memoirs, speaking of the burdens of academia and the tragic irony of history. His victims, the peasants of Indochina, will write no memoirs and will be forgotten. They will be joined by his North Korean and Bosnian victims…For decades, Chomsky has vilified his critics as only a world class linguist can. However, for me and the surviving members of my family, questions about life under the Khmer Rouge are not intellectual parlour games.”   Chomsky denounced the Khmer Rouge when they were safely in power. He has never to my knowledge denounced the North Vietnamese Stalinists. In both cases he was very opposed to any attempt to stop them gaining power in the first place."

I would describe simulacra as follows. Consider a piece of plywood in an empty room. At first sight, it is plywood. Or, at the very worst, a perfect, sci-fi-style clone of a piece of plywood. Here, continuity lives. In either case, the object is a piece of plywood. However, what if the piece of wood were a laminated fir, treated to look like plywood? And what if there were a label telling us as much? Here, we have something different. Continuity has been ruptured. It looks like plywood, but it isn't. ""We know very well, but ... ."" The key being an essential difference that keeps us from conceptually, or at least linguistically, acknowledging the thing as a thing in itself. A simulacra is a thing that is something else."

CriticalTheory,2ihzbm,keredomo,7,Tue Oct 7 07:14:22 2014 UTC,"In short, simulacra is a reversal of the map-territory relationship, leading to a disappearance of the territory  I come from a computer science background, so I will use some CS analogies, but hopefully it's clear enough. (The existence of two cultures in academia frustrates me to no end.) (I'm not high, but maybe a little drunk on my own thoughts.)  A map is a practical abstraction, treated as equivalent to its territory. It is not equal to its territory, but equivalent, given some particular restricted criteria. Because we are limited to that criteria, a map can potentially be smaller than its territory. A trail map can fit in your pocket because it summarizes only the most important features of a park.  Likewise, in CS, we build abstractions on top of bits and silicon. As you move up the abstraction pyramid, concepts move farther away from bare metal and closer to natural language. At the bottom level, you are sending 1's and 0's through an Ethernet Cable. At the top, you are saying, ""walk 5 steps sideways in the video game"".  A benefit of engineering with abstractions is that one layer is not strictly dependent on the details of the lower layer. Say we replace the Ethernet Cable with a wireless card, and your mouse with a controller. A video game should not care which implementation is used, as long one exists.  A map refers to its territory; an abstraction is implemented through a more concrete level. What's the difference, really? Suppose we try to keep the same map when the territory does not exist. Sounds strange, right? Why would I have a map for a nonexistent place?  But a map is not just an equivalence, it is an artifact in its own right. In the same way as a video game can exist without ethernet, cartography can exist without particular land. Cartography entails topics that are not reducible to accuracy of representation of land. Off the top of my head, these include aesthetic considerations, culture, politics, data science, and puzzles. We could have a lot of considerations without even mapping a real place.  Now, extend the artifact-nature of maps to all abstractions. Taken to its furthest extent, some ""maps"" bootstrap themselves, and end up being as large as, or larger then, their territories. At a certain point, the territory is no longer necessary. At this point, we have reached precession of the simulacra. The map comes before, it precedes its territory, reversing the relation. With this, we can understand what Baudrillard means when he says ""The Gulf War Did Not Take Place"". What he means is, the concept of war has become more significant than the tanks and bullets that we think ""War"" refers to."
CriticalTheory,2ihzbm,laofmoonster,3,Tue Oct 7 03:20:15 2014 UTC,"I just remembered a relevant story, I wish I knew the source but I don't.  Meteorological maps have color conventions. So light rain is green, snow is blue, red is hot, and so on. Some time ago, a TV station tried to use a different color scheme. Viewers freaked out and complained. They could still find out the weather -- It's the same weather! -- but the change was still unacceptable. The color scheme became a solidified ritual, irrespective of the temperature and precipitation it represented. Simulacra preceding reality.  EDIT: one more example from /r/sorceryofthespectacle"
CriticalTheory,2ihzbm,laofmoonster,2,Tue Oct 7 05:14:19 2014 UTC,"The simulacrum does indeed result from a situation in which truth cannot be distinguished from falsehood. In Baudrillard's terms, the Imaginary and the Real collapse into one another. A helpful way to approach simulation is to follow B. and think of someone feigning a sickness: when someone is merely pretending to be ill, they try to reproduce the symptoms of the sickness but subsequent tests could show them to be entirely fine. In simulation (as opposed to pretending), the person feigning illness would actually manifest symptoms of the illness. In the simulated case, would the person actually be sick? Impossible to tell - the illness is simulated!  Baudrillard's definition of the simulacrum is ""the generation by models of a real without origin or reality."" In the above example, the person feigning illness is generating a model of this illness that had no basis in reality; the person was not actually sick.   If you really want to get deep into this, simulation is distinguished from representation and the difference is important. In representation, signs still exchange themselves with the Real (they have a grounding in reality and represent it). In simulation, these signs no longer exchange with the real, but rather exchange with one another in a perpetual exchange. When the sign exchanged with the Real, it presupposed fixed poles (determinant truth/falsehood, meaning/nonmeaning, etc.). When signs exchange with one another in an uninterrupted circuit, there is no fixed meaning, the system is indeterminant (what is true can also be false) - the poles collapse in on one another and there is no distinction between truth and falsehood because the signs are no longer exchanging with reality.   This is largely derived from Baudrillard's Marxist roots; the increasing simulation of reality is a product of the capitalist system; like the commodity, the liberation of the sign (introducing it into a system of perpetual exchange) was a necessary development. Fixed meaning would be an impediment to the flow of capital and as such it was necessary to liberate everything (Baudrillard's apocryphal orgy) and allow it to 'float free' in a system of equivalency (of all signs) which allows for constant exchange."
CriticalTheory,2ihzbm,LitostPC,2,Tue Oct 7 07:57:58 2014 UTC,"I am coming from a more Guy Debord and Marcuse influenced perspective, but I have read Baudrillard as well. From my understanding, simulacrum is the idea that were are surrounded by only representations of experiences that we have not lived first-hand. For example, television shows, movies, even books would be included. Even art is a simulation of reality if it aims to be representational. People, especially in the modern era, live their lives in a completely passive way, only experiencing these representations of reality, never really interacting with them. Hope that helps."

In sum, MOOCs are another false ""progressive"" conversation of the ""new"" ""21st century"" university--which gain momentum by accusing costly and more successful models of being ""old"" and ""stuck in tradition""--that have very, very little to do with actual education and the assessment of learning, and everything to do with profit creation.

While the bankers all get their bonuses  I'll just get along with what I've got  Watching the weeds in the garden  Putting my feet up a lot  I'll explore the outer limits of boredom  moaning periodically  Just a full-time, lonely layabout  that's me  6.

CriticalTheory,2hsr6s,motke_ganef,4,Tue Sep 30 00:14:41 2014 UTC,"Unless I have missed something extremely important (As someone from what used to be the USSR I have no idea of what ""Marx"" is read in Western Universities. Apparently they have emphasized books ignored in the East [f.e. the «Grundrisse»] because they didn't have the manpower to defend alternative interpretations to works considered canonical in Communist China and in the USSR.) there is firstly the second part of the communist manifesto written together by Karl Marx and Frederic Engels in 1847. Please read the whole thing to answer the implicit question « what with 'bourgeois' ».   The bourgeois clap-trap about the family and education, about the hallowed co-relation of parents and child, becomes all the more disgusting, the more, by the action of Modern Industry, all the family ties among the proletarians are torn asunder, and their children transformed into simple articles of commerce and instruments of labour.  But you Communists would introduce community of women, screams the bourgeoisie in chorus.  The bourgeois sees his wife a mere instrument of production. He hears that the instruments of production are to be exploited in common, and, naturally, can come to no other conclusion that the lot of being common to all will likewise fall to the women.   i.e. to the owner of factories, steamliners, publishing houses, to the Grand Bourgeois, his wife is just a tool to produce him a heir. He is by no means a monogamist. Aside from all the elitary prostitutes for his own pleasure he has access to his chambermaids, to his female workers, to the wives of his male workers etc. etc. etc. pp.   Bourgeois marriage is, in reality, a system of wives in common and thus, at the most, what the Communists might possibly be reproached with is that they desire to introduce, in substitution for a hypocritically concealed, an openly legalised community of women. For the rest, it is self-evident that the abolition of the present system of production must bring with it the abolition of the community of women springing from that system, i.e., of prostitution both public and private.   He's writing in 1847. That you remember before you start shouting ""oh, what nonsense"".  Now, the big Marxist classic book devoted to love and marriage are the «Origins of the Family, Private Property, and the State». It was written not by Marx but by Frederic Engels in 1884. Karl Marx has died in 1883 and Engels wrote that book based on the notes Karl Marx had made about the 1877 book by Lewis H. Morgan called «Primitive Society». Lewis H. Morgan was an American lawyer trying to defend the property rights of the Iroquois tribes on land. Amongst the other things he did describe Iroquois courtship. To put it in most simple terms they didn't have a concept of fidelity or fatherhood. Their camps are divided in different longhouses each one inhabited by a particular Gens, by a community of matrilineary related people and dominated by the eldest woman, by the matriarch. The man cannot own anything because they cannot have children. There are no ""fathers"" in the Iroquois society. Men belong to their mothers' Gens. They hunt for it. But there is a taboo on sleeping with the women from your gens. For courtship you try to get adopted into a different Gens as a male.  Morgan already compared that to the demi- or fully agrarian native American tribes like the Pueblo Indians or the Aztecs who did, in fact, have know both fatherhood and the nuclear family. They also had slavery. Hunter-Gatherer tribes have no use for slaves. Their prisoners of war instead they either cannibalize (Tupí indians) or they adopt them (plains indians).  Engels goes further in stating the obvious:    The increase of production in all branches – cattle-raising, agriculture, domestic handicrafts – gave human labor-power the capacity to produce a larger product than was necessary for its maintenance. At the same time it increased the daily amount of work to be done by each member of the gens, household community or single family. It was now desirable to bring in new labor forces. War provided them; prisoners of war were turned into slaves. With its increase of the productivity of labor, and therefore of wealth, and its extension of the field of production, the first great social division of labor was bound, in the general historical conditions prevailing, to bring slavery in its train. From the first great social division of labor arose the first great cleavage of society into two classes: masters and slaves, exploiters and exploited.  As to how and when the herds passed out of the common possession of the tribe or the gens into the ownership of individual heads of families, we know nothing at present. But in the main it must have occurred during this stage. With the herds and the other new riches, a revolution came over the family. To procure the necessities of life had always been the business of the man; he produced and owned the means of doing so. The herds were the new means of producing these necessities; the taming of the animals in the first instance and their later tending were the man’s work. To him, therefore, belonged the cattle, and to him the commodities and the slaves received in exchange for cattle. All the surplus which the acquisition of the necessities of life now yielded fell to the man; the woman shared in its enjoyment, but had no part in its ownership. The “savage” warrior and hunter had been content to take second place in the house, after the woman; the “gentler” shepherd, in the arrogance of his wealth, pushed himself forward into the first place and the woman down into the second. And she could not complain. The division of labor within the family had regulated the division of property between the man and the woman. That division of labor had remained the same; and yet it now turned the previous domestic relation upside down, simply because the division of labor outside the family had changed. The same cause which had ensured to the woman her previous supremacy in the house – that her activity was confined to domestic labor – this same cause now ensured the man's supremacy in the house: the domestic labor of the woman no longer counted beside the acquisition of the necessities of life by the man; the latter was everything, the former an unimportant extra. We can already see from this that to emancipate woman and make her the equal of the man is and remains an impossibility so long as the woman is shut out from social productive labor and restricted to private domestic labor. [...]  The man now being actually supreme in the house, the last barrier to his absolute supremacy had fallen. This autocracy was confirmed and perpetuated by the overthrow of mother-right, the introduction of father-right, and the gradual transition of the pairing marriage into monogamy. But this tore a breach in the old gentile order; the single family became a power, and its rise was a menace to the gens."
CriticalTheory,2hsr6s,motke_ganef,2,Tue Sep 30 00:29:49 2014 UTC,"As the hunter became a herdsman and a peasant he also needed someone to bequeath his herds, slaves and fields to. Enter fidelity. Since there was no way to determine the biological fatherhood you got the utterly draconic emphasis on female fidelity enshrined in all the eldest scriptures that we still have from primitive agrarian societies, from China, through Persia and India, through Babylon and Israel to Greece.   The Monogamous Family  It is based on the supremacy of the man, the express purpose being to produce children of undisputed paternity; such paternity is demanded because these children are later to come into their father’s property as his natural heirs. It is distinguished from pairing marriage by the much greater strength of the marriage tie, which can no longer be dissolved at either partner’s wish. As a rule, it is now only the man who can dissolve it, and put away his wife. The right of conjugal infidelity also remains secured to him, at any rate by custom (the Code Napoleon explicitly accords it to the husband as long as he does not bring his concubine into the house), and as social life develops he exercises his right more and more; should the wife recall the old form of sexual life and attempt to revive it, she is punished more severely than ever.  We meet this new form of the family in all its severity among the Greeks. While the position of the goddesses in their mythology, as Marx points out, brings before us an earlier period when the position of women was freer and more respected, in the heroic age we find the woman already being humiliated by the domination of the man and by competition from girl slaves. Note how Telemachus in the Odyssey silences his mother. [The reference is to a passage where Telemachus, son of Odysseus and Penelope, tells his mother to get on with her weaving and leave the men to mind their own business – Ed.] In Homer young women are booty and are handed over to the pleasure of the conquerors, the handsomest being picked by the commanders in order of rank; the entire Iliad, it will be remembered, turns on the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon over one of these slaves. If a hero is of any importance, Homer also mentions the captive girl with whom he shares his tent and his bed. These girls were also taken back to Greece and brought under the same roof as the wife, as Cassandra was brought by Agamemnon in AEschylus; the sons begotten of them received a small share of the paternal inheritance and had the full status of freemen. Teucer, for instance, is a natural son of Telamon by one of these slaves and has the right to use his father’s name. The legitimate wife was expected to put up with all this, but herself to remain strictly chaste and faithful. In the heroic age a Greek woman is, indeed, more respected than in the period of civilization, but to her husband she is after all nothing but the mother of his legitimate children and heirs, his chief housekeeper and the supervisor of his female slaves, whom he can and does take as concubines if he so fancies. It is the existence of slavery side by side with monogamy, the presence of young, beautiful slaves belonging unreservedly to the man, that stamps monogamy from the very beginning with its specific character of monogamy for the woman only, but not for the man. And that is the character it still has today.   This is the origin of monogamy as far as we can trace it back among the most civilized and highly developed people of antiquity. It was not in any way the fruit of individual sex-love, with which it had nothing whatever to do; marriages remained as before marriages of convenience. It was the first form of the family to be based, not on natural, but on economic conditions – on the victory of private property over primitive, natural communal property. The Greeks themselves put the matter quite frankly: the sole exclusive aims of monogamous marriage were to make the man supreme in the family, and to propagate, as the future heirs to his wealth, children indisputably his own. Otherwise, marriage was a burden, a duty which had to be performed, whether one liked it or not, to gods, state, and one’s ancestors. In Athens the law exacted from the man not only marriage but also the performance of a minimum of so-called conjugal duties.  Thus when monogamous marriage first makes its appearance in history, it is not as the reconciliation of man and woman, still less as the highest form of such a reconciliation. Quite the contrary. Monogamous marriage comes on the scene as the subjugation of the one sex by the other; it announces a struggle between the sexes unknown throughout the whole previous prehistoric period. In an old unpublished manuscript, written by Marx and myself in 1846, [The reference here is to the German Ideology, published after Engels’ death – Ed.] I find the words: “The first division of labor is that between man and woman for the propagation of children.” And today I can add: The first class opposition that appears in history coincides with the development of the antagonism between man and woman in monogamous marriage, and the first class oppression coincides with that of the female sex by the male. Monogamous marriage was a great historical step forward; nevertheless, together with slavery and private wealth, it opens the period that has lasted until today in which every step forward is also relatively a step backward, in which prosperity and development for some is won through the misery and frustration of others. It is the cellular form of civilized society, in which the nature of the oppositions and contradictions fully active in that society can be already studied.   The hero of the song of Pet Shop Boys has, basically, realized that there's no point in getting angry or sad about the loss of the exclusive right of access towards one particular female sexual partner. This sense of entitlement first appeared in the agrarian society and is these days upheld because it is in the interests of the ruling WASPish bourgeois patriarch class.    It is a bourgeois construct and our hero has «given up the bourgeoisie». A Marxist would say he ""has attained a class-consciousness"". From the song we cannot glean if our lyrical hero is a prole, or a lumpen-prole or anything else but he is evidently not a bourgeois. He doesn't have a factory to bequeath to his ""rightful son"" so now he can laugh about his previous self moping around with «bunch of roses» «promising fidelity».  I hope that help. Feel free to ask about the other lines. In the meantime I will start «Flicking through Karl Marx again». Thank you, OP, for linking that song. I have never previously heared about the PSB. What are their other funny songs?"

CriticalTheory,2hof3w,casebash,12,Sun Sep 28 05:53:12 2014 UTC,"The structure of the English word 'reification' gives it a 'repetition' vibe under the influence of what is assumed to be a re- prefix. However, the word comes from the German term Verdinglichung, which means 'to make into a thing.' [Ding: thing (Ding an sich, etc). The re- is actually from Latin 'res,' which means 'thing.' (Res publica: a public thing, republic)]. Then it just means what it sounds like: making a supposedly objective 'thing' out of subjective practice, usually under the influence of ideology. Instead of seeing reification as the habitual holding of individuals to this or that stereotyped standard, 'race' itself is a reified concept because it has no objective, absolute existence. We convince ourselves that it's there, then it 'becomes a thing.'  The meaning of 'Essentializing' is going to depend on who's saying it and when. Going down certain Hegelian threads, it can certainly be a ""positive"" thing (Feuerbach, Lukács) when it refers to what is 'essential' to a subject in the, again, absolute sense. ""Negatively,"" it probably involves privileging a (reified) category over its individual constituents. Any category is abstracted from experience, 'essentializing' is an attempt to reverse this relationship."

Of course, that isn't the case at all (we can't even say that all black women have black skin.)   Reification, on the other hand, is like when something is reinforced or recreated over and over. It's a cyclical process whereby something is made more and more real. So to go along with that example, gender would be reified by holding those women to stereotypically feminine standards, or ""treating them like women."" Does that make sense?"

CriticalTheory,2hdpvj,emperorlarsob,11,Wed Sep 24 23:45:54 2014 UTC,"I'm pretty tired and this isn't going to be fully coherent so bear with me.  Butler's point is two-fold: 1) there is no identity that is able to be understood without difference which isn't possible outside of society. There is no essential subject. She's not the first to claim this, her point in bringing this up is mainly to attack the idea of gender.  A person is ""disabled"" only in relation to a world in which they are marked different against a normative social understanding of what it means to be ""able-bodied."" You are not ""disabled"" if you're missing an arm but you've never met another human; more importantly, you can not know what it means to be ""missing"" an arm if you have no multi-armed person (or zero-armed) person to compared to. However, once you put the subject--in this case a one-armed individual--in a society that has multi-armed individuals, those physical attributes (can) become the markers of difference and, therefore, identity.  2) Society not only marks difference and teaches us to understand those markings as identity, society teaches us what that identity means through socialization and specific treatment as a consequence of that identity. Once identified by society we can interact with that identity in a variety of ways; but whether we choose to conform, defy, or do a mixture of both, we are acting in relation to our socialized understanding of what the essential aspects of that identity are. In addition, we have a tendency to make known those choices so that society will interpret our identity the way we understand ourselves (which are, of course, socially informed). Always imperfectly, we perform what we imagine our identity to be.  Lets go back to our one-armed individual. Our friend was born with one arm in our society wherein two-armed is normative and preferred. From pity to bullying (and many other reactions), society interacts with this individual in a dramatically different way throughout his life and labels him ""handicapped"" or ""disabled."" Our friend decides to defy the stereotype that he is unable to play sports and decides to play baseball, an especially two-handed game. He figures out a way to bat one-handed, has a special glove so that he can catch and throw with one-hand, etc. He defied the odds and becomes a competent player. Despite our friend's defiance of society's expectations that are placed on him due to his ""disabled"" identity, he was still forced to interact with that identity in a direct way--in defiance--and that interaction formed the basis for his sense of self. He was still performing his identity in relation to what it meant to be a ""disabled"" person."

CriticalTheory,2hdpvj,minimuminim,1 point,Thu Sep 25 12:50:46 2014 UTC,"I apologize, I'm not competent enough to deal with your second point.  In some aspect or another, I think nihilism always sits on the horizon when we practice critical theory. This is a consequence of critical theory's central project: to hold modernity accountable for tremendously failing to live up to it's claims. We usually do this by attacking one of modernity's ideologies, in this case secular humanism. Judith Butler is one of many thinkers who focus on critiquing the assumption that essential characteristics can be understood and classified through empiricism. I think that the threat of falling into nihilism seems to loom so high when we critique and deconstruct humanism because it is the moral ideology that society has been based upon for over two-hundred years. But this critique is necessary so that we can open up and reveal the faults and successes of humanism the same way that Enlightenment philosphes first challenged the claims of religion and divine monarchs to moral knowledge and authority. Then, just as Enlightenment humanism came to replace religion as the fundamental basis of society, we can replace humanism with something else. That something new won't be totally different; just as secular humanism was highly influenced and contained within it many aspects of the old religious system, the next moral ideology will include major strains of humanism.  I actually think the transformation in the discourse of gender that has occurred since Judith Butler first published Gender Trouble in 1990 is perfect example of the way many of our fundamental assumptions can be obliterated and then reconfigured. Butler, among others, was one of the most important early thinkers that provided the philosphical framework for today's ""third-wave"" feminism. While we're deeply indebted to the feminists of the 60s and 70s for laying the ground work for the women's rights movement since, it's pretty widely accepted that mainstream second-wave feminism dropped the ball on understanding and embracing intersectionality (not that they were the only ones). On gender, second-wave feminists notoriously referred to the essential woman who had characteristics shared by all women (but never men) and existed before/outside of the patriarchy (Check out the Goddess movement for some especially egregious examples). Gender Trouble is Butler's refutation of both traditional-patriarchal and second-wave assumptions about gender essentialism. Since Gender Trouble came out, the conversation on gender has drastically changed, especially in the last decade or so. While LGBTQ individuals continue to face harassment, moods are rapidly changing. As a society, we're beginning to think about gender differently but we're probably not moving into a gender-less world."

Essentially, as far as I understand her, she's saying that the only doer that exists only exists because of the doing; because that doer is made by the act, there is no temporally stable ""foundation"" from which to experience identity.

CriticalTheory,2h1q5f,Ienpw_III,6,Sun Sep 21 17:19:15 2014 UTC,"Given that game theory is very mathematical, I'd imagine it's a lot harder to mount an attack against it. Perhaps against how it is (ab)used, but maybe not against the theory itself..."
CriticalTheory,2h1q5f,Adornos_Ghost,4,Sun Sep 21 21:17:26 2014 UTC,"The critical theory critique of game theory IS against the theory itself.  It posits a version of rationality that is positivistic and reduced to mathematical formulas as you rightly point out.  But individuals do not always act according to such a rational theory.  Furthermore, it is possible that the model itself leads to irrational outcomes that are the product of a series of purportedly rational decisions.  Game theory does work to an extent and clearly has its truth in the equilibrium of Mutual Assured Destruction since the Cold War, but it is complete bullshit to suggest that humans act rationally at all times in what is an irrational world--like the irrationality that now we all live in a time where the hit of a button can cause the destruction of the entire plant, and we are increasingly getting to that point."
CriticalTheory,2h1q5f,Ienpw_III,2,Sun Sep 21 22:55:01 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure you're entirely accurate.  My understanding of rationality as it applies to economics is that it means actors will always act s/t they maximize their own utility (it's usually assumed that one knows what one's own utility function is). In effect, this means that one's actions are driven by their utility functions. In other words, you're distilling what makes people act how they do into one function.  Sometimes people don't know their own functions. Sometimes people's utility functions seem externally irrational. But that doesn't mean they are irrational in a game theory sense -- it's a non-normative definition of rationality that depends entirely on the utility function. For instance, if I can maximize my utility by hanging naked from the Burj Khalifa and singing O Holy Night, then doing so is rational. In standard usage of the term, that's irrational, because we make assumptions about what I should be doing. That's not the place of game theory.  Determining those utility functions can be difficult. But often in game theory, they're defined as givens from the start. For example, in the prisoner's dilemma, we state from the very beginning what the players' utility functions are (cooperating if the other player cooperates yields x, betraying yields y, etc.). Maybe a real person would not always act as the player would. But that doesn't always matter, because game theory is mathematics. I don't think you can criticize the theory itself.  What you can criticize is application of it. If real people empirically don't act as game theory predicts, that means that their utility functions do not match those as defined by the model. In fact, since game theory is entirely logical, that's the only thing it can really mean (as long as you've done all your math right) -- that your givens don't match up with the real world. In that case, claiming that they do would be mistaken, but the game theory itself would still be solid.   So, if you're criticizing game theory, what you're really criticizing is people who make overly broad conclusions about human behaviour from it -- people who read too much into it and who ignore the empirical evidence. I'd bet it's pretty difficult to find actual game theorists who do that. Maybe that's why there's not much criticism of it."

The idea that maximizing utility is an end worth striving for or whatever is normative as hell. Here the question what utility is concretely, and how the field(s) defines it has not even been posed.  Anyway, if basically no one acts according to their utility functions, so nobody does whats best for them at the given situation (see the ethical implications here?), what is game theory even useful for?   Determining those utility functions can be difficult. But often in game theory, they're defined as givens from the start.   On what grounds are those defined? Usually on some specifically western ideas of rationality, wanting to maximize a numerical outcome. Basically non innately quantitative relations are made fully(!) quantitative with some prior assumptions about good or optimal outcomes, by a priori assigning numbers to choices (and thus the outcomes) and then checking how this completely deterministic account turns out in the end. Its tautological from the very beginning. Whatever the fields accepted norm on assigning utility to whatever is makes the outcome predestined. It just reinforces prejudices here. Ask yourself what those utility functions are.  This does not even address the fundamental issue that human beings would need a utility-calculating-heuristic that is genetically or biologically fixed for it to be applicable everywhere and every time. If it is only socialized, you'd need vagueness, cross-cultural differences (maybe on extremely small scales), and tons of other things to make it work. For it to be socialized you then need an account on how your brain, your mind, or whatever can be shaped by outside influences that are not strictly biological...  Apart from this there is also the question if cooperate or defect are the only options anyone can ever take, or if its only 2 endpoints of a spectrum, or even worse, only 2 options of a larger set that are not connected by a linear relation.  To then fix issues (question what are issues, are they defined in game theory, or outside of it and formalized with it?) you use incentives, because they simply change numerical values to those that make the preferred outcome more likely. This in turn reduces humans to - exactly - classical homini oeconomici, that can be controlled by certain means.   since game theory is entirely logical   Aristotle is a human being.  Human beings are green.  Therefore Aristotle is green.  This is entirely logical, nonetheless it is wrong, based on wrong assumptions. Something to keep in mind for everything.  Btw. i like game-theory, i like how it shows the problems that can arise from ""rational"" action, and the elegance it has in doing so, and how important cooperation becomes in iterated versions, which poses some problems for classic ideas of selfishness. Not that it would not also lead to a redefinition of selfishness as every action everyone ever takes, because in the end it somehow also maximizes their own utility. This of course makes the very concept of selfishness utterly useless."

CriticalTheory,2h1q5f,hex_m_hell,6,Mon Sep 22 07:17:44 2014 UTC,"Game theory is mathematically sound. It's use in economics isn't. If you want to attack the use of game theory you only need to look at the assumptions that are made when applying the mathematical models to reality.  The economic use of game theory relies on assumptions about humans as logical and informed actors. They aren't. Done. Game theory proves extremely useful in explaining some biological behavior. Game theory can be used to model capitalist economics, but just because it can be used as a model of human behavior within a specific social environment doesn't mean that it models all human behavior. It's use is highly assisted by external psychological analysis.  Game theory is critical to designing a functional economic system, but in order to do so it must take in to account how humans actually work. Capitalism is an economic system that came in to existence when primitive humans developed naive models of human interaction based on their experiences with despotism. After it had already existed for several generations, economists began applying game theory to model it. At no point have the basic assumptions of the capitalist system been reviewed or engineered. People don't work for monetary reward. The idea that they do is one of the core assumptions of capitalist economics and it's demonstrably false. All models based on this assumption are therefore flawed.  Capitalist economics entire ignores much larger questions like ""what is good?"" and ""what do we want from a social system?"" Social psychology shows us that we have the capability to engineer systems that promote different types of behavior. Behavior is a product of systemic forces.   There are, in fact, several forces within the capitalist system that promote socially destructive behavior. Any system that fails to take in to account the social psychological forces implicit within it's structure cannot possibly be good. The attack is not on game theory itself (which is sound), but on it's use, application, and the implied assumptions of the models used."

The model assumes people always work for money and the more money you throw at people the more they work. Several studies have demonstrated that this isn't true.  People work harder the more money you give them until they reach a certain point. At that point they stop being motivated by money entirely. Instead they're motivated by other things like recognition, a sense of power, etc. If you raise people beyond subsistence levels, the entire dynamic changes. Managers have known this for years. There are several ted talks on this.  A company I worked at gave infinite paid vacation. No one abused it because we all worked for a different reason. All the game theory based economic models say that shouldn't work, but it did. We weren't working for money, we worked for knowledge. Money doesn't matter."

Maybe drug use is revolutionary but only in a passive sense. It certainly wouldn't have much impact on police brutality or unjust courts. But drug abuse could be a passive form of slowing the flows of capital. Unlike destroying your neighborhood or even setting yourself on fire, the self destructive behavior of drug abuse is a passive means of resisting the (re)production of meaning within the capitalist system. Drug addicts engage in a form of consumption outside the state sanctioned market. Plus, their addiction can also cause the user to withdraw from forms of state-sanctioned consumption in order to afford their habit. Also their capacity to produce suffers when their addiction leads to unemployment. So they resort to theft and other crimes hostile to the system  in order to procure their needs . The system needs active consumers to flourish, but if enough people began to live for their addiction, the system would suffer but it could hardly foment a revolution.

Such a suicide is designed to provoke a public outcry of sympathy for the person and rage against the policies that resulted in their choice to die. Without the media, suicide would be a private act and, therefore, politically pointless."

CriticalTheory,2fslqp,5yearsinthefuture,3,Mon Sep 8 15:52:05 2014 UTC,"This is a clickbait article totally devoid of any critical theory.  Moreover, it just isn't correct to say that people first dislike pop songs and then they like them after they are beaten over the head with them.  It's much more rational to say that pop songs follow a pretty consistent and predictable structure (namely, AABA) which is rather easy on the ears.  This makes them pretty likeable.  Pop songs are mostly banal compositions which only really innovate in terms of tone quality and timbre; ""Fancy,"" for example, is quite conventional except for the nasal qualities of the voice and the unique electronically-engineered tones.  I for one disliked ""Fancy"" the first time I heard it about the same amount as I dislike it today, after having listened to it several dozen times.  On the other hand, I immediately liked ""Rude"" the first time I heard it, and I still like it today.  I don't think I'm particularly special or immune to the ""brainwashing"" influences that this trashy article claims exist, so why is it that my taste has been so consistent even after dozens of listens?"

I will repost what he said here because I think he raised some interesting points, even if it resembles Adorno on overdrive.  My point is a very simple one and my co-moron friends (here in the asylum) have confirmed they have readily understood it as well. So why do you feign being more stupid me, moron, and my moron friends? Are you a troll? That's fine with me. Socrates has also been a troll. Let us philosophize then.   The Music Industry Is Literally Brainwashing You to Like Bad Pop Songs — Here's How   Why bad pop music? Why not bad jazz music? Or: Bad twelve tone music? When Marx is talking about the Culture Industries his two examples include John Milton and an Opera singer. It's not like Opera is done for art's sake alone. Even if it is an atonal Alban Berg Opera that they are performing they're still making money. So: where's the fundamental difference?  Enter Marx:   Die produktiven Arbeiter selbst können mir gegenüber unproduktive Arbeiter sein. Z.B. wenn ich mein Haus tapezieren lasse und diese Tapezierer Lohnarbeiter eines masters sind, der mir diese Verrichtung verkauft, so ist es für mich dasselbe, als wenn ich ein tapeziertes Haus gekauft hätte, Geld gegen eine Ware zu meinem Konsum verausgabt hätte; aber für den master, der diese Arbeiter tapezieren läßt, sind sie produktive Arbeiter, denn sie produzieren ihm Mehrwert. Dieselbe Sorte Arbeit kann produktiv oder unproduktiv sein. Z.B. Milton, who did the ‘Paradise Lost’ for 5 Pounds Sterling war ein unproduktiver Arbeiter. Der Schriftsteller dagegen, der Fabrikarbeit für seinen Buchhändler liefert, ist ein produktiver Arbeiter. Milton produzierte das ‚Paradise Lost’ aus demselben Grund, aus dem ein Seidenwurm Seide produziert. Es war eine Betätigung seiner Natur. Er verkaufte später das Produkt für 5 Pfund. Aber der Leipziger Literaturproletarier, der unter Direktion seines Buchhändlers Bücher (z.B. Kompendien der Ökonomie) fabriziert, ist ein produktiver Arbeiter; denn sein Produkt ist von vornherein unter das Kapital subsumiert und findet nur zu dessen Verwertung statt. Eine Sängerin, die auf ihre eigene Faust ihren Gesang verkauft, ist ein unproduktiver Arbeiter. Aber dieselbe Sängerin, von einem entrepreneur engagiert, der sie singen lässt, um Geld zu machen, ist ein produktiver Arbeiter; denn sie produziert Kapital.""   A teenager who makes an ear-rape video on youtube is not hired by an entrepreneur. Or: when you have a peon sing a tune for himself and his friends it is also not a music industry. But otherwise money doesn't smell. There is no rock money, no jazz money, no opera money. Back to the article. The end:   [...] Numerous social and cognitive factors make it very easy for the pop music industry to gather an audience for artists they decide are worth promoting, and once we've been initiated to those artists, there's no turning back.   If they are talking about a theory on what social and cognitive factors play part in the formation of a musical taste why do they limit themselves to one particular genre? How is one industry worse than another? What makes the songs of the Black Eyed Peas objectively ""bad"" as compared to those of Kurt Cobain or of Eduardo di Capua? Each one of them was working in his particular genre thinking not just of their money. There were some very good pieces produced by the Music Industry. The Requiem of Mozart is an obvious example: his role here was that of a hired hand, a proletarian. So is it also bad? You tell me, please. Why do I like the Requiem of Mozart? Brainwashing just or maybe there is something else?  And my reply which isn't particularly well thought out because it's late and I'm tired:  I don't know why you're calling me a troll.  I asked why you wrote your comment like a moron?  I was referring to this: ""2deep4you"" , ""sheeple"" & ""Tr00 music ain't for yuo.""  I could tell from the rest of your comment that you weren't a moron but somebody who decided to articulate themselves like one for an unknown reason.  Anyway, getting back on point.  Just a slight correction:   "" When Marx is talking about the Culture Industries his two examples include John Milton and an Opera singer.""   Marx never mentioned ""the culture industries"".  That term was coined by Adorno and Horkheimer in the Frankfurt School much later.  Of course they were Marxist critics, so I see your point.  I'm just being pedantic on that.  I'm not disagreeing with you by the way.  But I think your line of thinking isn't particularly productive (pun intended).  It leads to a scenario where art is only art when the artist is impoverished or unsuccessful.  It suggests that culture is enforced from the top down and is never ""organic"" from the bottom up.  You used Nirvana as an example.  They were signed because they made music that people liked.  They took Seattle by storm and then and only then did the record company sign them up."

That is a circular argument. Going by that article they brainwashed the people in Seattle. It's two ways to express one single thing. Justin Bieber also wasn't born in the boarding room or assembled from inorganic1 cyborg parts. He began his career by taking youtube by a storm. I'm sure it wasn't any different for the black eyed peas. Because that's how the record companies work. They do not trust in this brainwashing theory.  This is why I gave ""ear rape"" as an example for ""tr00 art"" - to lead the whole idea ad absurdum. It has no record companies involved at all. So: more tr00 than your Cobain?  You, by the way, may find a very productive place in the music industry: as a critic you've got to justify the irrational taste of your public and you already are very good at justifying your preference for Kurt. What came first? You reading his biography or you liking his music? Apparently there's also some demand for the biographies of the Black Eyed Peas.

Socrates was permabanned for trollery. And those are the memes from Hipster runoff. They're not ought to make you write a wall of text in an effort to explain the obvious.  1 I'm well aware it's Gramsci's term for what the Stalinists would have called a ""class traitor"". Again: who cares about the caste of a singer? He's here to sing and not to tell me his biography. Therefore I don't believe that ""inorganic"" singers and intellectuals should be murdered or made to fell wood in Siberia. They are as good as the organic ones and, oftentimes, better. Viktor Yerofeyev and Gore Vidal are so good at describing their respective elites exactly because they are so inorganic."

The point is very simple though: Why is Iggy Azalea ""bad"" music that you have to be brainwashed to like, whereas Nirvana is awesome and rad and you like it because you have great taste?  And I think the answer is very simple: The premise of the article is utterly wrong.  People who like Nirvana like Nirvana.  People who like Iggy Azalea like Iggy Azalea.  People who dislike Iggy Azalea are not going to gradually like her over time if you play Iggy Azalea for them dozens of times.  The same goes for people who dislike Nirvana.    If this article actually were devoted to a critical perspective rather than a superficial, conspiratorial one, then it might look at why something like Iggy Azalea is being released these days and what it says about the culture that consumes it."

I think the author raises some pretty interesting points, even if they're unable to be especially expanded upon.    I can’t eat without instagramming my food. I can’t shit without playing Candy Crush. I can’t even remember who half the people are on my Facebook feed, but I’ll still mindlessly scroll through their tedious status updates and wince at their tacky wedding photos. Out of these aimless swipes, clicks and likes, a new world is being born. A world where everything we do, no matter how inane, is tracked, recorded, sorted and analyzed. Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer has said the whole process is “like watching the planet develop a nervous system.” And through this system, every human action has become a potential source of profit for our data lords, a signal for them to identify and exploit.   There's some serious stuff to work with in this paragraph alone - while 'users' mindlessly feed technological addictions, an entire form of economy is being established based on those addictions - even those who are creating and working for these applications and companies remain largely oblivious to this new commodification and instead 'plug-in/shut-down' and simply go along with the buzzwords and trends in order to 'play the game'.    “We are about to enter a world that is half digital and half physical, and without properly noticing, we’ve become half bits and half atoms. These bits are now an integral part of our identity, and we don’t own them,” says Hannes Grassegger.   A really solid quote and one worth digging into some. We're permanently leasing out aspects of our own identities without the ability to ever regain control of them. Or at least from current standpoint, it seems to be this way. What kind of effects is that going to have in the near-future? Long-term?  Maybe its not the most profound article ever, and maybe it covers a lot of things that have been talked about before - but that doesn't mean its entirely drivel. I do think there's some serious value inside this article, despite its stylistic forbiddings and occasional fluff."

Attributing it to the nature of the internet amounts to the same. The web is a medium, it can only tell stories we tell it. This is a societal issue. The same society that binges on entertainment that makes people like the victims rich. The same society that finds security and privacy at odds while ignoring our tendencies to irresponsibly provide personal information to third parties at a whim. The same society that lets the porn industry define our modern mediums.  With this in mind, I think its clear this is a symptom rather than a problem itself but if it is it was a problem before now.

Sometimes readings of a particular text or event (in this case) can produce really interesting turn of phrase or concept, but taken out of context, these phrases can quickly turn into jargon. Where an idea was interesting and powerful in the discourse out of which it was born, the same concept can quickly be used as a gloss for a different context. I think Richard Rorty deals with this problem in his reading of Heidegger when he discusses how Heidegger writes against the reification of language. An interesting concept inevitably becomes old and blunt through repeated use - Heidegger wanted to constantly trade in vocabulary to avoid this problem (though he failed). Like you see with Barthes' structuralism, language is always becoming some flourish, rather a chain of them, that we string together. Critical theory really suffers from this (although all discourses do) because it is so popular: in its attempt to be accessible and utilitarian, it quickly produces jargon out of interesting ideas and we end up getting a bunch of blog posts that make repeated use of copy-paste."

You could do an analysis like that for Britney Spears too, but come on, Jennifer Lawrence is a completely different creature than Britney Spears. So there's a certain quality to Jennifer Lawrence that has some interesting effects when mixed in with other issues.   And yes, you can analyze everything.

CriticalTheory,2ej3nt,TheRedWhale,9,Mon Aug 25 14:04:31 2014 UTC,"[Throwing like a girl] has its “source in the particular situation of women as conditioned by their sexist oppression in contemporary society.”   I think this is exhibited in many embodied-behaviors women participate in - especially something like the books-clutched-to-chest action described in the article. The criticism of ""female"" mannerism being ""a mere thing — a fragile thing, which must be picked up and coaxed into movement, a thing that exists as looked at and acted upon” is spot on. I'm not necessarily convinced that this is the direct root of the ""girly throw,"" though.  Throwing is an athletic action, and and that means a practiced, rehearsed action. Boys are given many more opportunities to throw things during their development. Girls are often discouraged, and therefore less practiced. If this is what is meant by ""women's conditioning by their sexist oppression in contemporary society"" I completely agree, but I think that is too soft a reading of the article. The claim is that women throw without recruiting the shoulder directly because they are conditioned not to view their bodies as fully recruit-able things. I think this holds with mannerisms we see - but not with throwing.  I think the strongest evidence of this is simply this video of men throwing with their non-dominant hand. If throwing is a matter of how you feel embodied in a space first and a matter of practice second (or not at all), we wouldn't be seeing the girly throws we see here."

Essentially, you pay to go to africa or wherever, and then you do volunteer work there. Its quite obvious whats going on here really; how can somebody with no practical experience actually benefit these places?  Recently, I read an article, in which the journalist describes how they went to help build a school. Every day after they'd finish bricklaying, the real builders they were working with would tear down what had been built, because it was so shoddy, and rebuild it properly.  The volunteers were, of course, shocked to when they realised this (who'd have thought a group of students with no practical skills are terrible builders?). But, I don't think its just simply trying to look good, these people believe they are actually helping others. But its still a kind of narcissism, and has some rather unfortunate implications in my opinion; its a kind of white middle class burden; 'I must help/enlighten the poor starving/uncivilised third world, despite the fact I have nothing practical to offer'. Or you could say its a kind of coping mechanism to avoid engaging seriously with the problems at hand.  Anyway, there's my rant.

CriticalTheory,2dznu4,Hevil,4,Tue Aug 19 17:13:50 2014 UTC,"You have echoed my thoughts exactly, though I would say (very generally and in the case of the ""ice bucket challenge"") people are not actively ""avoiding engaging seriously with the problems"". By which I mean, a person isn't  thinking ""I can't/don't want to do this/that, I will do this instead"" but only ""I can do this"". They are not thinking of what they could do, because it is not something they would think about until it is brought to their attention. This convenient gratification trend allows them to do something and feel good in return. Do you remember the ""cinnamon challenge"" from a few years back? That's what I thought this amounted to, attention in exchange for playful humiliation, until I looked up the purpose. However, I'm not convinced it is actually any different.  I have seen what happens when someone stops and thinks, ""this is silly, what could I do instead?"" They give money, which doesn't actually engage differently from pouring ice on your head other than literal contribution. Donation means one can hand off the problem to the idea of helping, much like offering entertainment under the guise of awareness. ""Now I've done my part."" What could they do instead? I have the opinion that a person would not try to think of such things, especially when there are convenient ""solutions"" right at hand."

If yes, awesome. If not, it might be a good idea to reconsider your trip. Sadly, taking part in international aid where you aren’t particularly helpful is not benign. It’s detrimental. It slows down positive growth and perpetuates the “white savior” complex that, for hundreds of years, has haunted both the countries we are trying to ‘save’ and our (more recently) own psyches.

CriticalTheory,2dznu4,minimuminim,5,Mon Oct 13 08:58:31 2014 UTC,"Dual degree in political theory and non-profit management here, can confirm.  The ice bucket challenge is excellent marketing. For a while now, non-profits have noticed how hard it is to get people to go to fundraising events or to volunteer, they found that you can actually get people to pay you in order to NOT be asked to contribute or attend an event. Many charities now even have fake events, where you pay to not show up.  I definitely agree with Zizek when he talks about corporate social responsibility (Starbucks) and purchasing as giving charitably (t-shirts, etc). Look at charitable crowdfunding campaigns, all donations bigger than $2.50 usually come with a coffee mug.  I think what would be helpful to understand, is that non-profits are booming right now in terms of demand (2008 killed govt funding for many social services run by the state, which were then privatized and contracted out to non-profits). So contracts were increased while funding dropped, while unemployment and purchasing power of middle-class people dropped. The middle class is the largest donor base of the non-profit world, middle class people are more generous. So you have a situation of increased demand, without the capital to really be supplying services.  Here comes the desperation that has made non-profits cling to new digital marketing schemes because of their relative cheapness and general loss of ethics in exacting donations. Many non-profits have closed due to de-funding from the gov. And de-funding from foundations which have recently changed their focus from poverty to more popular causes (education, community revitalization (aka prepping areas for gentrification), and healthcare). This is high time for digital marketers in the sector, and is only the beginning of more, similarly unethical schemes (think KONY, amazon smile, those shitty rubber bracelets, and earned-income oriented non-profits that sell things in able to provide services (usually a service fee)).  TLDR Non-profits were hit in 2008 with de-funding, have resorted to desperate schemes to increase donor bases w/ out the continued support of the middle class (due to their near extinction) and foundations which are becoming increasingly apolitical (outside of D.C. & state capitals)."

This has been the failing of most of the ""Arab Spring"", except perhaps for Tunisia, where there just appears to have been a fortuitous collection of people. Egypt 2011 was incredibly important, but the really great lack was support for the nonviolence part specifically, which is something thinking people around the world could help along with social media.

Talking about Mcluhan's ""spectrum of 'hot and cool'"" can be very tricky, indeed.  When he describes sensory involvement, it's on the most primitive of possible scales.  In the case of television, its a matter of making a coherent episode of ""Simon & Simon"" out of >the actual dots<. You probably picked up on that.  But proceeding form this level of sense processing directly to the quality of a social movement, as an inference or deduction, as if it were a machine we were discussing, is as close to an error as one can make in social science.  I'm saying this because I've done too.  That's not to say that there is no relationship.

The proposal itself is as much of a probe or testing-the-waters as I find McLuhan's philosophical approach in general to be.  I believe that it's likely a social movement could benefit from the collaborators/participants sustaining it having a more involved and intimate mediation between themselves and collaborators/participants across different localities, via the use in certain ways of the kinds of technologies I'm promoting, but of course I or no one else knows for sure until it's concretely tried out."

I've found that there are a few things that work for me. I've learned, first, that I have to be self aware when I read. If I don't understand something, I've got to stop my momentum, turn back, and read it again. I've probably read through some of my books two and three times before I actually ""finish"" them.   I've also found (and this might be redundant/obvious for you, but it definitely wasn't for me) that reading theory (of any kind) is different than reading fiction or any other genre of non-fiction. I can rip through a book on history, a novel, etc. pretty quick. Critical theory books, on the other hand, are much better if I take my time and read them slowly, even stop here and there to think about what I've read and let it simmer.

(Steam is popular. Even I use it.)  This is actually quite unsustainable and leads to a lot of proprietary restrictions. It churns what we make into a disposable item in line with the service's want to get you do a certain thing so it can make money. Steam is notorious for filling out game backlogs.

The arguments against 'identity politics' presented in this essay are bogus, yet I am not quite sure I am any more comfortable with the state of leftist politics after reading this -- nor am I convinced that 'identity politics' is not still a viable object of critique.  I suppose I am still worried about a reliance on a correlationist/experiential epistemology, the sole legitimacy of (symbolic) violence from a position of the hegemonized/oppressed, and the practical elimination of critique in favor of censure (masquerading as 'rage'). I do not want a retreat into bourgeois 'universalism,' but instead the recognition that politics must be enacted through the affinity of individuals -- indeed, even the meager sacrifice of the supposed moral high-ground would do much to reinstate a badly needed real politik on the left. I mean, fuck!, if you're operating with the postmodern epistemology which allows offense criticism then you can't very well appeal to the concept of morality in the first place.  I just want a recognition that we're engaged in politics when we critique symbolic structures of oppression, and that there is thus room for debate, difference and mutual aid despite disagreement.

CriticalTheory,2c2bf0,locke78,6,Wed Jul 30 03:28:14 2014 UTC,"I have long been a follower of ""I need feminism..."" posts and I have done a couple myself as well. I think it has been a great outlet for many people to express their opinions, relieve a bit of their past traumas (harassment and rape posts mostly) and vent about their daily problems. When we look at feminism it is easy to observe a big number of strands and subcategories as well. It is sometimes difficult to follow their train of thought because they overlap at some many points, but they have numerous contradictory/opposing views, too. With this and people's passion and inclination to see things black and white, they can end up ""not needing"" or hating feminism, as they can for many others -isms. I'm sure the posters of Women Against Feminism still need or like many aspects of feminism...  When I first looked at the blog, I thought I was going to see arguments regarding collective representation, pluralism, formalism but most of the things I have seen were ignorant and silly. Still, these views should never be ridiculed, which defeats the purpose of an inclusive feminist movement. Making fun of these women only further problematizes the elitist position of feminists, which is also a common criticism. (PS. I have done graduate research and my thesis on feminism focused topics and I still feel anxious talking at feminist events and gatherings.) I didn't see many examples of punk feminism on the blog but it can be a choice for many people who are not comfortable with some forms of institutionalized feminism.

I understand that it's not a useful, inclusive practice to ridicule instead of educate or listen to someone, but disregarding (whether through ignorance, malaise or otherwise) historical and contemporary marginalization or resistances is a huge erasure of oppression and a way of being implicit in oppressing one's self and others.

CriticalTheory,2blt2p,Jeremy_oc,3,Thu Jul 24 16:15:04 2014 UTC,"Plasticity is not something that is done as an activity but is the condition writ large for how the brain (and society generally) operates. Contrary to past models of the brain which believed that the brain became a more or less rigid structure after childhood/early adulthood development, the brain continues to change over time developing or eroding synaptic links based upon social pressures and individual experience. As Malabou notes, ""If a synapse belongs to a circuit in frequent use, it tends to grow in volume, its permeability increases, and its efficacy increases. Inversely, a little-used synapse tends to become less efficacious."" She contends that this allows for a gradual molding of the brain over time based upon the particular environment of the individual. This is why, for example, we could say that a carpenter uses different parts of their brain in different ways then, say, a judo master.   Malabou identifies two particular results, or truths, we can glean from our knowledge of brain plasticity. The first is that there's always the possibility of emancipation of the brain (and therefore, the individual subject). In other words, the subconscious forces that act upon individuals in the real, material world aren't deterministic but, in fact, can be adapted to and overcome: ""...by trying to become conscious of [the plastic mechanisms forming our personality] we may...acquire a new freedom, that of imposing our own organization on the world rather than submitting to the influences of the milieu."" In particular Malabou believes that this notion of plasticity allows us to contest the broadly structuring principles of capitalist ideology.  The second big truth Malabou wants us to realize involves the relationship between the neuronal (the physical functioning of the brain such as synaptic firing) and the mental (the conscious thoughts that individuals have). If a person is aware that the brain can change based upon the social conditions we exist in then changing what we think about can actually change the physical function of the brain itself (in small, gradual ways over extended periods of time).  As for all the Hegel stuff, Malabou contends that the condition of plasticity necessitates a negation of existing beliefs/synapses/neurons in order for new ones to emerge (or ""explode"" to use her own term). To put it another way, you can't go straight from Libertarian to Communist. There has to be a process of negating the initially held beliefs in order for the physical function of the brain to accept the new ""explosion"" of Communism in the brain.   Hopefully this clears things up a little bit. If it doesn't I blame only myself for having not read Malabou's work in a couple of years and being a little rusty on some of the finer points."
CriticalTheory,2blt2p,TheGhostOfLenin,2,Wed Jul 30 02:01:33 2014 UTC,"I see you got no answers so far, I will give it my best shot.  I would say the plasticity she refers to, in social terms, is the condition of alway being assumed to be able to cognitively take on any task. It's no longer rigid specialization that is the defining factor of our society. Although production still is heavily specialized (i.e. division of labor), individuals are in a higher degree expected to be able to take on any task. Essentially, our society is characterized by the strive of very high cognitive capabilities. Plasticity means change, and the ability to cope with change.   Furthermore, when they compare it as ""the hermeneutic motor scheme of our 'new age'.” they mean it is what we strive for, define us and our society as well as the other way around.  Hope my answer is sufficient since I am by no means an expert on her writings and I base this on my very limited knowledge of it."

If you are going to invoke Nietzsche, then the least you could do is to read the paragraph you are quoting from:  ""God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. Yet his shadow still looms. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us?

By giving those people free rein, doesn’t liberal science tacitly encourage verbal outrages and irresponsible sloganeering? Not really. Quietly but inexorably working in the science game is the disciplinary mechanism of marginalization . Though the rules of the game do not allow majorities to repress other people’s opinions, they do give them every right to shrug them off. People who are irresponsible, who bruit about opinions but won’t stand to be checked or won’t abide by the results, are dismissed as nutty or obnoxious. People who go around saying that the Holocaust didn’t happen are pushed to the fringes. Liberal science tends to discourage such people by marginalizing them.   Rauch, Jonathan (2013-10-01). Kindly Inquisitors: The New Attacks on Free Thought, Expanded Edition (p. 85). University of Chicago Press. Kindle Edition.    Liberal science cannot exert discipline if it cannot use its tool of marginalization to drive unsupported or bogus beliefs from the agenda.   (p. 120)    The world is always full of people who hold silly or obnoxious opinions and who have the means to broadcast them. That will never change. One of liberal science’s great discoveries is that , provided such people are forbidden to use violence, the best strategy is to marginalize them unless and until they submit to proper checking. Ignored, they lose their megaphone.   (p. 129)  Again, apologies for not actually reading the text and arguing against a headline. I thought people would appreciate the quoted passages. From the headline, one could ask though: ""What are the groups and ideas that should be allowed freedom to emerge and educate without being attacked, dismissed and marginalized."" Also: ""Who decides who those groups should be?""."
CriticalTheory,2arkq5,reconrose,13,Tue Jul 15 14:43:49 2014 UTC,I did debate in high school. There is a type of argument called a Kritik that is usually based in critical theory. I became interested in critical literature after studying and using Kritiks.

I couldn't do CX, so I stopped debating, and read Zizek and Deleuze and Guattari for fun. Then I did college CX, and that turned college philosophy classes into a joke. Every continental-ish class in philosophy or the humanities was a breeze, and the analytic classes were simple enough to get through easily after doing debate.  Debate is seriously, hands down, the best way to teach kids about philosophy and politics. Nothing compares to them being forced to actually read and understand arguments and then relate them to competing arguments. You don't even have to make people read. People pour hundreds, even thousands of hours into critical literature just for fun and because they want to win.  Also, on a personal note, I felt that my mental health issues weren't just biological, but had to do with the way that society was organized. Reading critical theory and understanding how that worked was extremely cathartic and actually helped me deal with those issues."

However, I noticed that a lot of the isolation that I felt wasn't some kind of delusion, but an effect of the way that capitalism individualizes people, especially in the age of technology. Part of that is the neoliberal ideology of self-reliance and individual achievement, but it's also the result of the material destruction of communities through poverty and the personal effects of work and school, the latter of which functions essentially like a business in the ideology of neoliberalism. I've since moved on from focusing on capitalism to seeing it as a part of or result of the complexities of settler colonialism and anti-blackness (even as a white person), but that's more of a personal preference in scholarship.  You should definitely check out Franco Berardi's work.
