F1Porn,38n1uu,midgrid,9,Fri Jun 5 07:29:40 2015 UTC,A truly brave man. Drove like a fucking nutcase in F1 until he shattered his legs. Couldn't drive anymore so he took to powerboat racing.  Refused to lift the throttle for the wake of a large ship and ended up killing himself. Absolute balls of steel.
F1Porn,38n1uu,WinfieldBlues_25s,5,Fri Jun 5 11:55:08 2015 UTC,"Not exactly true. He did refuse to lift up, but he killed himself because he wore seatbelts at a time when most powerboat drivers did not. He just didn't conceive the fact of not going strapped up while driving at massive speeds. And that's what killed him, the boat sank and while his co-driver simple swam away, he drowned tied to the thing. Had he not been wearing seatbelts he probably would have lived on. It's sad to think what killed Gilles was doing the exact opposite thing."
F1Porn,38n1uu,Draco092,5,Fri Jun 5 16:51:20 2015 UTC,"Villeneuve was wearing seatbelts, though - the belts themselves were ripped from the chassis by the sheer force of the accident."

Can't remember much about how and why he got the Tyrrell drive for 92, as 91 was a fairly torrid year for him at Osella - but I imagine he must have brought a large amount of Francs with him!  Tyrrell had to employ some very ordinary drivers in the 90's (Rosset for example!), as you say they were doing very well for a team without much sponsorship."

F1Porn,36dco8,midgrid,3,Mon May 18 14:13:06 2015 UTC,Any reason they aren't on slicks?  After a Google it looks like it was a regulation? As most pictures have similar looking conditions and I didn't really see much about tires on the wiki.

F1Porn,36dco8,tylerstig1,2,Tue May 19 16:01:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, FIA wanted to reduce mechanical grip, so that we could have more wheel to wheel racing, unfortunately teams got around that by going all out on aerodynamics, and in 2009 they brought back slicks and started regulating aerodynamics(aero grip) instead of tires(mechanical grip)."

F1Porn,33owa1,Jam71,2,Fri Apr 24 09:07:01 2015 UTC,"In hindsight, Martini was incredibly lucky to get so many shots at F1.   After this debut at Monza for Toleman he was with Minardi for their debut season in 1985, then it was back to F3000 and he didn't get back to F1 until 1988..."

F1Porn,33m9ej,meebs555,3,Fri Apr 24 00:45:35 2015 UTC,"Lol, no. That's the oil tank. It's the standard location for the dfv. The gas tank are way safer than that. They're to the left and right of the driver."
F1Porn,33m9ej,tpwalsh,2,Fri Apr 24 01:50:28 2015 UTC,1969? That late and no wing? Strange.
F1Porn,33m9ej,tpwalsh,4,Thu Apr 23 19:35:20 2015 UTC,"During the late 1960s, the cars' wings rapidly developed to a point at which they were extremely high and mounted directly to the suspension.  This was dangerous for obvious reasons, and this design was actually banned between sessions of this race meeting - here's Hulme's team-mate, Bruce McLaren, driving earlier in the weekend.  Most teams had nothing to fall back on until they could design, build and attach lower-profile wings to their cars for the following races."
F1Porn,33m9ej,midgrid,4,Thu Apr 23 19:52:25 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I thought they went right from wings on uprights, to wings as bodywork and there wasn't much of a transition period."

F1Porn,33kqrw,SlowRollingBoil,2,Thu Apr 23 15:29:19 2015 UTC,They have a camera rig attached to the back of the wing.  It is in motion as they have several shots from this day that was a promo shoot.

F1Porn,33kqrw,midgrid,2,Thu Apr 23 18:19:13 2015 UTC,Here is several other shots from that day showing it in motion so I assume since it's in motion in other shots why not this one?

F1Porn,33kqrw,midgrid,0,Thu Apr 23 18:35:01 2015 UTC,"All of those shots are so manipulated that I think it's impossible to say whether the car is actually in motion for any given one.  Take this one, for example: the driver's gloves are clearly Photoshopped in later and the steering wheel is again not illuminated.  It would also be physically impossible for him to turn the wheel as it is already touching his body (I suspect it could easily be a mannequin)."

F1Porn,338rpq,MC_Dickie,0,Tue Apr 21 00:15:37 2015 UTC,"I think it has something to do with the lighting. It was dusk, so you can see the sparks better.   And as said, they use skid plates to create sparks when the car bottoms out. Artificial show-element :). But in the sun of the previous grand prix's you didn't notice them that much.  Also, it depends on the bumpyness of the track ofcourse."

F1Porn,335lt0,89M3,0,Sun Apr 19 22:30:04 2015 UTC,It's a gimmick. They had them put titanium plating underneath just so they would spark.
F1Porn,335lt0,corntorteeya,11,Sun Apr 19 23:28:16 2015 UTC,It's not a gimmick. They just changed the metal that was already in the plank before from magnesium to titanium. Titanium wears quicker and does not break off in large dangerous chunks like the magnesium sometimes did. Forces the teams to run slightly higher set-ups because of plank wear regulations.   See this reddit comment with info from Charlie Whiting.

F1Porn,335lt0,sonusfaber,1 point,Mon Apr 20 13:14:50 2015 UTC,"It can be crossed from the track side. The white line extends into the middle of the track, so drivers would have much less space for overtaking if it wasn't allowed. Not to mention the first lap would be very tricky with the whole field storming down to turn 1 but they can only use half of the track, or just over 3 car's width."

He never had any pretensions to be the #1, but always delivered solid performances to lock up the WCC and when Schumacher broke his leg, stepped up and almost won the WDC.   He had enough competitiveness to put in the best drives he could every race, but lacked the ego in his career to be satisfied with banging models on yachts instead of winning the WDC.   When Rubens was #2, there was always the drama because he thought he could beat Schumi and wanted to try to. Irvine didn't care."

F1Porn,31jhau,kers_equipped_prius,3,Sun Apr 5 18:11:18 2015 UTC,"I know it gets said every time a car from this era is posted, but man I miss the crazy aero of the mid-2000s."
F1Porn,31jhau,Funkagenda,4,Sun Apr 5 22:02:09 2015 UTC,Best looking car of all time.
F1Porn,31jhau,Polly_Ester_NO,2,Sun Apr 5 20:41:18 2015 UTC,The wave of MP4-20 love this week has been great.
F1Porn,31jhau,DonMan8848,2,Sun Apr 5 22:10:44 2015 UTC,"I'ma letchu finish, but BMW-Sauber created the best looking F1 car of all time  EDIT: I'm dumb. Fixed the team name."
F1Porn,31jhau,Juls317,1 point,Mon Apr 6 02:56:57 2015 UTC,You mean BMW-Sauber?  My favorite from the mid-2000's aero is the Toyota TF107.
F1Porn,31jhau,kpstormie,1 point,Mon Apr 6 03:14:44 2015 UTC,"I fixed it. I knew something wasn't right about calling that a Williams, I think I just brain farted because of the ""BMW"" part."
F1Porn,31jhau,Juls317,1 point,Mon Apr 6 03:33:23 2015 UTC,Fuckin hell. But that Sauber and Toyota are orgasmic pieces of engineering. That insane aero is just sublime and it only got crazier as the years went on. I really wish we could've seen where the craziness was going next.
F1Porn,31jhau,Pooter_McGee,2,Mon Apr 6 13:17:47 2015 UTC,"so umm... those side pod vents, they're used to direct the radiator heat onto the winglet so it flows over the rear wheels ?"
F1Porn,31jhau,booplouie,2,Mon Apr 6 04:07:11 2015 UTC,This picture shows why I love Monaco. Few more inches over and that's a accident. Damn near precision.
F1Porn,31f3zc,loger2,5,Sat Apr 4 14:01:56 2015 UTC,"Every time I see him in this car, it makes me angry."
F1Porn,31f3zc,gilligan156,-2,Thu Apr 9 06:12:41 2015 UTC,"Get over it. People die. I don't blame Williams. He was a great driver, and it was a shame. I see that picture, and I remember a flat out driver racing for a fantastic team that would have brougt him more championships."
F1Porn,31eunp,majestickillboy,6,Sat Apr 4 11:56:26 2015 UTC,I must go. My people need me.
F1Porn,31eunp,EMINEM_4Evah,2,Sat Apr 4 13:24:55 2015 UTC,This car actually looks pretty good for a 1995 car.
F1Porn,31eunp,Gnadalf,5,Sat Apr 4 18:12:34 2015 UTC,For a '95 car? The entire grid was looking awesome
F1Porn,31eunp,dieomesieptoch,2,Sun Apr 5 06:23:44 2015 UTC,"I prefer mid 80s and late 2000s cars. The 90s looks boring to me. No turbos, no aero."
F1Porn,31eunp,Gnadalf,1 point,Sun Apr 5 10:37:34 2015 UTC,"Pity it was the slowest thing on the track by a goodly margin. Well, after the first race when the MasterCard Lolas weren't stinking up the place anyway."
F1Porn,31eunp,Brickie78,3,Sun Apr 5 00:03:47 2015 UTC,"This was '95, Lola was '97.  Fun fact: This Forti is the last F1 car to have a H-Pattern gear shifter. By then, everyone had moved to paddles."
F1Porn,31eunp,SMauler9,1 point,Sun Apr 5 11:37:47 2015 UTC,Lola was '97.   Of course it was. Doy.
F1Porn,31eunp,Brickie78,1 point,Sun Apr 5 11:53:24 2015 UTC,Any video?
F1Porn,31evi1,majestickillboy,-1,Sat Apr 4 12:09:25 2015 UTC,"Maldonado could learn a lot from Jean Alesi about how to crash. Alesi was the master of wrecking. I think he may have crashed out 7 cars at Monaco in one race (not weekend, just the race)."
F1Porn,31evs8,majestickillboy,1 point,Sat Apr 4 12:13:43 2015 UTC,"Could you post this to /r/vintagef1, please?"
F1Porn,31fgdd,MrWADConsole,1 point,Sat Apr 4 16:04:37 2015 UTC,I think this is the first season in awhile where all the cars on the grid are beautiful. Looking at the old 2010-2013 high nose cars is so weird now.
F1Porn,31fgdd,Th3_St1g,1 point,Sun Apr 5 15:29:04 2015 UTC,My favourite the 2011-2013 cars anyway. This time cars ugly for me.
F1Porn,31aser,majestickillboy,2,Fri Apr 3 11:32:34 2015 UTC,That car is ridiculously flimsy and has a suicidal driving position. Reuteman was lucky to retire alive.
F1Porn,31aser,mapoftasmania,2,Fri Apr 3 19:31:42 2015 UTC,That is a sexy looking car...
F1Porn,31aser,gizm770o,1 point,Sat Apr 4 04:56:45 2015 UTC,I wish modern formula cars looked as cartoon-like as the ones in the mid to late seventies.

F1Porn,31ar3d,majestickillboy,5,Fri Apr 3 11:12:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting this, the Arrows A19 really was a beautiful looking car."
F1Porn,31ar3d,BlueInq,1 point,Fri Apr 3 12:33:16 2015 UTC,Though it's funny how short the nosecone is compared to 2015 cars.
F1Porn,31ar3d,sissipaska,1 point,Fri Apr 3 13:11:23 2015 UTC,"I'd rather say that 2015 nosecones are funny, compared to 1995 cars :-p"
F1Porn,31ar3d,alexnoob,1 point,Sun Apr 5 13:19:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's one of my favorites. It just looks so tough with the raised nose, all black and Danka and Zepter sponsor livery."
F1Porn,31ar3d,Man7ox,2,Fri Apr 3 14:40:47 2015 UTC,I miss glowing brakes.  Really captured my imagination watching F1 as a youngster.

F1Porn,316cqk,RabesAU,4,Thu Apr 2 11:16:52 2015 UTC,Is this even a photograph?
F1Porn,316cqk,diggory_venn,2,Thu Apr 2 12:52:57 2015 UTC,Composite maybe.
F1Porn,316cqk,XJ-0461,2,Thu Apr 2 21:04:42 2015 UTC,Great pic! Hi-Res is good. No worries.
F1Porn,316cqk,I_also_never_post,3,Thu Apr 2 11:24:43 2015 UTC,How was this taken?
F1Porn,316cqk,whatthefat,3,Thu Apr 2 14:53:15 2015 UTC,They have a rig attached to the front wing to do video and still shots for promo material.  I'll try and find a picture of it.
F1Porn,316cqk,RoboticNubbin,3,Thu Apr 2 16:56:14 2015 UTC,Here is one where they used a video rig on a track. http://www.mrmoco.com/products/rigs/modula-rig/videos-photos/

F1Porn,3164g4,boredwithlife0b,3,Thu Apr 2 16:19:59 2015 UTC,"I'm sure I'm in the minority, but I really loved that track/race"
F1Porn,3164g4,WassDogg304,1 point,Fri Apr 3 03:18:22 2015 UTC,"I loved it too. To be fair I only saw it in 2012, and I was new to the sport. Maybe I should go back and watch it again."
F1Porn,3164g4,SeannoG,3,Thu Apr 9 01:25:24 2015 UTC,I miss this gp so much it had such a good vibe especially when alonso won
