AskWomenOver30,3dyn7r,NoozeHound,11,Tue Jul 21 10:38:36 2015 UTC,"Hey there - I'm 3 weeks away from being 40 (and fabulouuuuus! hehe). Never had kids, never wanted them. Intentionally, I tend not to invest much time in friendships with women who have children (I've tried and it just ends up not being a friendship that suits me). That means I don't have a ton of female friends. But, of the 4 or 5 close female friends I DO have, none have children. Here is where I met them:   work (software, consulting) - either my coworkers, or the SO's of my male coworkers fitness (krav maga & triathlon training group) edit - training, not coaching as I previously stated! Oops!! my homebrewing hobby (I have belonged to one of the local clubs since 2009)   What kinds of hobbies do you like? Are there clubs or meetups that you could join to meet others with similar interests?"
AskWomenOver30,3dyn7r,CapOnFoam,7,Mon Jul 20 17:28:42 2015 UTC,So after a long day of coding you go kick some ass and finish up with a brew? :)

AskWomenOver30,3dyn7r,kziv,2,Mon Jul 20 21:33:50 2015 UTC,"hell yeah! See you out on the course ;) (any chance you're in the KC area? That'd be weird.)  I started doing triathlons because I love fitness (especially cycling), and I thought it would be a good way to set goals for myself. AND, I realized this winter that all my friends were beer friends, and all my social activities revolved around drinking.  I needed some friends with healthy habits.  And, it's working! While I'm not besties with any of them, we're a social group and I'm making a few friends."

Any good ones (70.3 preferably) there later in the year? My race calendar is already full through June!  I got into tris because I love swimming, was running for cardio, and had just joined a cycling club to make friends so I figured why not combine them all. I've made some amazing friends and plenty of casual acquaintances."

This is my first year.   Kansas Ironman unfortunately discontinued in 2013. However, another group called Legend Endurance took over the course it used to run and now does 3 races throughout the season. I'm doing their last one at the end of September, Legend Ad Astra. I've previewed the course and it's pretty. Hilly, but beautiful. Goes through farmland... You can check out the race info here: http://www.legendendurance.com/legend-ad-astra.html"

AskWomenOver30,3dyn7r,kziv,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:45:08 2015 UTC,"I had to look it up, but it looks like it's hillier than Augusta for sure, and similar to Mont-Tremblant. People don't seem to believe that Kansas is hilly, but eastern Kansas sure is!  Here's a map (and elevation) of one of the earlier tri's the same company hosted, which I believe is the same route:  http://www.legendendurance.com/assets/free-state-short-bike.png (from the main page here)  Augusta looks like just over 1000ft total ascent. Mont-Tremblant is 1800. Lawrence is 1974. Phew! :)"
AskWomenOver30,3dyn7r,CapOnFoam,2,Tue Jul 21 16:42:31 2015 UTC,"That's totally doable for me! I did the Clermont, FL 70.3 and it looks like it has just over 2000ft climbing, so it's comparable. I highly recommend that, btw, if you feel like traveling for an early spring race."

I just learned how to swim this January (properly anyway, all I could do was doggie paddle) so I'm probably a couple years from a HIM, but I'll keep it in mind should I decide to do one.   My goal right now is just to develop a good base and learn where I'm strong vs where I need to focus improvement. And, work on speed! I'm slow all around and I'd love to kill my sprint times next year."

AskWomenOver30,3dyn7r,localgyro,9,Mon Jul 20 17:21:56 2015 UTC,"What I found more useful than focusing on finding women friends without kids was to find women friends with a life of their own. I live in an area where most women have kids, and many of my friends do, but most of them love to get out on their own, even without their spouses, and are interesting people who talk about way more than their own kids and are respectful of my not wanting any.  I met them by joining local athletic clubs (triathlon, swimming, running, cycling). Women who don't have kids will show up to events that are during prime kid hours (dinner time, weekends) and women who have kids but have a life outside of them may be more intermittent but you'll see them too."
AskWomenOver30,3dyn7r,kziv,5,Mon Jul 20 21:38:45 2015 UTC,"Work! Women in my area overwhelmingly disappear from the workforce after they have children, so the same-age colleagues I still have either didn't do the kids thing or had kids younger and are back in the working world.   Other than that, I would guess any time-intensive evening hobby would be a good place to start. A wine tasting club or weekly salsa class or weekend art appreciation trips - basically anything that's massively easier to fit into your schedule when you don't have to be home by 8 to put the kids to bed."
AskWomenOver30,3dyn7r,innovativesalad,10,Mon Jul 20 21:29:55 2015 UTC,"I have the same problem, but it's not just the child free thing. I feel like I have views that the rest of society would consider weird, so I don't think there are many people that would tolerate me.  I'm childfree by choice and unmarried. I call myself ""openminded"" when asked about religion. I hold liberal social views but conservative fiscal ones. I live below the Bible belt where being part of a church and having prejudices is common here.   I really ought to move up north. I think I'd fit in better up there."

I joined a midlife women's Meet-Up group but have to confess that I haven't been to any of their get-togethers. I do sometimes meet women at work, and the older I get the more I meet women whose kids have moved away, who now have time for friends again. My best CF friend was a friend of a friend, who I met on Facebook. So, all this to say that it's definitely not easier. Perhaps easier for me, living in Seattle, than in other parts of the country, but still not as easy as I'd hoped. Good luck to you. PM if you want an online friend. :)"

Do you live in a city? I feel like it is a lot easier in the city than the suburbs. Go out to a bar, start a trivia team, sign up for a fitness class at the Y, hit up concerts of bands you like (make small talk between sets with people). That is what I've done in the past. I am also lucky that 3 of my gfs from high school decided to be childfree like me though.   Also don't discount men as friends-a large % of my childfree friends currently are men.

I do understand my biases (my environment skews child-free), but I'm also going by the endless stories from single parents of all persuasions about how challenging dating is. So I'd be pretty surprised if large numbers of women, at least in my approximate culture and demographic, would think to hold it against anyone that they didn't have kids.

At 37, she does not have much time left to become a mother at all. Although I don't have anything against children, I just never wanted to sign up for such a lifelong lasting commitement... I am 39 years old now, but I feel so much younger. Also I never had a problem spending time on my own...

AskWomenOver30,3dxf8e,DeepSouthDude,5,Mon Jul 20 13:24:45 2015 UTC,"I think this is a generational thing. The 'Confirmed Bachelor (wink)' seems to me to date back to before people could be out.

AskWomenOver30,3dv2nx,ifeelsillyy,8,Sun Jul 19 19:29:05 2015 UTC,"Not exactly because, in my experience, the free time in university was all over a 24 hour period where as now it's in blocks. Im 39 and my SO and I are childfree. In that respect I sort of have more free time than my parent friends. However, even if you look at the M thru F job plus commute, I only really consider free time on the weekend. I may go out after work, but not often. Also, my SO doesn't always have a normal schedule. That throws a bit of a wrench in things too.  I do, however, thoroughly enjoy my free time and our free time as a couple. But it does look a bit different from uni free time."
AskWomenOver30,3dv2nx,flappybunny19,6,Sun Jul 19 20:17:49 2015 UTC,"so then....what's the point of life? go to work, have kids, retire, die?  will I not have time for hobbies?"
AskWomenOver30,3dv2nx,flappybunny19,5,Sun Jul 19 20:23:33 2015 UTC,"No no no! That's not what I meant. I'm sorry if it sounded that way. I work in the pharmaceutical industry. As odd as it sounds, I fucking love my job. I mean giddy excitement for certain things, general happiness for most others. I only despise a few areas. So I looooove what I do.  My SO is the exact same way with his career, but his is in the video game and now movie arts areas. He genuinely gets bouncy when discussing projects.   The biggest issue I had transitioning from university to real world was getting my schedule down. In uni I was so used to 3 to 4 hours of sleep, wake and do work or go to the lab. Fyi, I did my independent study labs between midnight and dawn because I could get so much more done w no one else there. Then class, then a nap. Then class. Then free time. Then my sleep again. It was a bit rough in the beginning learning to sleep for 8 hours straight.  I don't schedule many fun things during the week because I don't enjoy it.  That by no means suggests it should be that way for anybody else. In all honesty, I usually schedule family time during week day evenings. Family time being for my SO's family as mine is about 300 miles away. Though I love them, I guess I don't consider that so much free time.  To see my family, older home town friends, etc. I plan that for weekends. We also plan for friend fun time over weekends too. Many of our friends have munchkins, so there are schedule issues at times. Also, many of our friends do not live within a 10 mile radius. And with a commute of around an hour, week day hang outs aren't always conducive.  That being said, I have a lot of friends from work. So after work drinks, dinner, etc usually does happen after work. It's my nonwork friends that get scheduled for weekends.  And please remember, I'm39. My SO is 43. Our general friend circle is in mid 30s to mid 50s.  This will alter hang out times. When I was in my early and mid 20s we did have more free time overlap. As people get older, and if they want to, they will have kids. This will always affect free time, even if you're not the one who spawned said munchkins.   Please don't think that as you age your life necessarily becomes boring. It doesn't have to. Throughout your life people will enter and leave. It's up to you to choose whether or not to interact more than superficially with them.   And regarding your hobbies, that's entirely your choice. And absolutely dependant on your actions. If you want them, you reach out, grab them, and ensure they're given priority in your life. My SO and I have several hobbies we do and enjoy. Many times those hobbies are not of interest to the other. We do things together, we do things apart. That's what makes us happy. You will find out what makes you happy as long as you're open to looking for it.  And never be terrified of failure. Just because one thing didn't work out doesn't mean the next thing won't succeed...or fail. In other words, don't have a per approved plan for every aspect of life, because it'll never work out exactly as planned."

BUT that means I also made a lot of sacrifices along the way. Work-life balance is a huge struggle, and instead of having kids, I travel. Having kids for some people is their life's work, and that is rewarding in ways that, again, the kind of fun we had in university just isn't any more.   Look, in your 20s you are just learning what kind of life you want to have, and in your 30's you live the consequences of the choices you made. So, think about what is most valuable to you. What are your priorities and values? Travel is a value to me, so I work like a dog for 9 months out of the year, and then have breaks to travel. Work-life balance is a necessary goal. Some people can work 90 hour work weeks as a lawyers and feel completely satisfied, some need to work 30 hours a week at a daycare to feel as if their life has meaning and balance. It's up to you to decide what works for you. It's not easy."
AskWomenOver30,3dv2nx,helianto,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:57:43 2015 UTC,"how do people find happiness if life is such a struggle?  My parents told me that university is the hardest part of life and then it gets funner and easier.  I mean as a university student I have no money and no time because studying is endless. Surely, after graduation, life is at least better than that...."
AskWomenOver30,3dv2nx,helianto,2,Sun Jul 19 21:02:37 2015 UTC,"Every day you make choices about what's important. What career you choose makes a big difference, as does what kind of attitude we bring to that career. It doesn't matter if you are a waitress or a doctor - how happy you are doesn't depend on anything but your attitude. If you want to make time for a boyfriend and rugby and volunteering and having a career you care about and makes a ton of money - well, no. You'll always feel tension between how much time you spend with your hobbies, career, friends, SO, and personal growth and development. It sounds like you have been convinced that there comes a day when you have ""made it"" and life is perfect. But that's not how things work. You make choices - right now you are choosing to study that hard, take those classes, have those friends, and volunteer. every day you make the choice about spending time on each of those things. When I work several 12 hour days, and I'm stressed, I do think there has to be an easier job - but would I really find that more fulfilling? I remind myself that I chose this. I choose to work hard. Happiness isn't just about smiling and laughing and having fun - happiness also comes from feeling useful, having purpose, and contributing to something greater than yourself. All of that takes some work, but it's a deeper kind of happy.   Yes, life is often a struggle, and it's not going to be easy. But it is worth it. You will not be given the golden key to life's happiness on graduation day. You will have been given the tools to approach life with better skills. The whole point of a liberal arts education is for you to have rich inner life where you think about things deeply, and thus have the self-knowledge to make choices that are valuable to you, to appreciate what you have, to take responsibility for those choices. If you are ignoring your boyfriend because you have volunteering you would rather do -that is a choice. You accept the consequences good and bad. That's what being an adult is all about. I think students these days have had so many expectations put on them, and they are scheduled for every second of their day every day, but they are told it's worth it because then they'll get a good career and life will be rosy. But life isn't something you get to live later, life is now. Life is the choice you make today. This is your life, right now.   You sound really depressed. Maybe talking about all this with a counselor would be good."
AskWomenOver30,3dv2nx,MonsieurJongleur,0,Mon Jul 20 06:26:27 2015 UTC,"I want to have a normal 40 hour per week job.  I dont want to work much over time.  That sounds terrible, even if you love your job.  Dont' tell me there's something wrong with me for expecting a work/life balance - if you can't reasonably expect to have a chance at a happy and healthy life then there's a problem with society, not me."
AskWomenOver30,3dv2nx,sharilynj,3,Mon Jul 20 06:32:14 2015 UTC,"Woah, I did not say there was anything wrong with you. Just that it will be a tension whether you have a 40 hour a week job or not. When you were first dating didn't you find it difficult to balance time between your boyfriend and your friends? That's just life is all I'm saying. As your life becomes richer, and you have more responsibilities and more interests, the challenge of maintaining balance just multiplies. I don't think there is anything wrong with wanting work life balance, and I hope you find it, but creating that balance requires choices. And the balance you choose will look different than the balance someone else would choose. This is true now in university, and it will continue to be true throughout your life. If you feel your life is out of balance now, and you are hoping that it will suddenly change when you graduate, that's unlikely. You have to learn how to maintain balance as you gain new responsibilities and new opportunities, or forces out of your control change. Think about it, there will be times when a partner needs you and he'll come first, and then other times when work is really under a deadline and that will come first, and then your sister or best friend gets married and you need to put time into her, and so on. Yes, that is challenge and there is no easy answer and it's not something wrong with society that makes that challenging - deciding what you value and want is what makes that challenging. You have choice, that's why it's hard. If you lived in a society with no choice, it would be easier perhaps.  You sound over-stressed and wondering if it will ever get better, and you seem depressed about the idea that things don't get easier when you are an adult. That means there is something wrong now with your balance, and nothing external is going to magically fix that. That doesn't mean there is anything wrong with you, just that you are finding it hard to balance everything, and maybe you need some tools to help you make choices and be ok with them. That's perfectly normal.   Balance is something you create, not something dependent on anything outside of yourself. You won't find a magical equilibrium that stays static. Everything changes, and you adjust. Life is dynamic, and so are you."

AskWomenOver30,3dv2nx,sharilynj,3,Mon Jul 20 13:45:18 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what you want out of life (financially and time-wise), and what kind of career you want.   I went through a brief period in my 20s where I had to work 70 hours a week to make ends meet, and was sitting on a non-profit board AND freelance writing at the same time. I could've dropped the board position and the writing and saved my sanity. But I think this kind of thing happens to a lot of young people, unfortunately. Treading water financially can really suck.  I'm in my mid-30s now, with a stable position at a large ad agency. Unlike most ad agency jobs, I rarely work more than 40 hours a week, so ""day job"" life has been very managable (short commute, too). Anything that's felt like a time-suck recently has really my own damn fault. I wrote and published a book last year. My fault. I remounted a solo stage show I created. My fault. I'm getting back into taking more writing and performance classes. My fault. Aiming to move to a new country next year, so I have tons of work to do for my visa application. My fault. I still buy and sell vintage on the side because I love it, even though I probably should've stopped ages ago. My fault. (Responding to a Reddit post instead of doing dishes? My fault.)  If you're wondering if you'll ever feel like there's enough hours in the day? No. But you will have more control over how you use those hours."

What if I pick the wrong hobbies and hang outs and never find a like minded guy to marry? What if hit 40 and realize life is meaningless?  What if I never have time todo fun or meaningfull things? what if the 'rat race' is literal - what if people really have tiem for nothing but work and then they die?

AskWomenOver30,3dv2nx,whenthepawn,2,Sun Jul 19 21:56:58 2015 UTC,"Life will never be perfect, no matter how you define ""perfect."" Be prepared for that. Be okay with that. I have regrets, but I'm still happy. Happier than I've ever been, actually.  I had my quarter-life crisis at 27. Sold my house, sold my car, quit a stable job, moved halfway across the country, alone, with no real plan.  My life began when I did that. All the stories they'll tell at my funeral are the ones from the last 9 years.   But I still worry about all the same things you do. Is this as good as it'll ever get? I'm not getting any younger. I know what my meaning of life is, but what if someday I stop caring about that thing or view it differently? Will my life have been a waste? What if I never meet the right guy? Will I have wished I had kids? Could I be doing more to make my dreams a reality? Since I'm an only child, when my parents get old and I have to be back in my hometown to be near them, will that mean my life is over too? Am I running out of time?  This is normal. So normal. In fact, if we weren't asking ourselves these questions, only then would we be at risk of having a meaningless life.   If family is important to you, have a family. If free time is important for you, take a job that allows you to have your evenings and weekends and 4 weeks of vacation. The power is all yours. You will tailor your life to look like the dream you never knew you had.    But if we should serve others, and together serve some common goal or idea -  for any one you, what is that idea? And who are those people?  In my experience, you will truly serve only what you love, because, as the prophet says, service is love made visible.  If you love friends, you will serve your friends.  If you love community, you will serve your community.  If you love money, you will serve your money.  And if you love only yourself, you will serve only yourself. And you will have only yourself.

AskWomenOver30,3dv2nx,mermella,2,Sun Jul 19 23:11:02 2015 UTC,"Ok, story time.  The thing that I love - and therefore serve - is comedy. I view it differently than most people do. I find it deeply beautiful, and it's the only thing that I've ever been truly passionate about.  This was inconvenient, though, because I wasn't destined to be a performer. It's not in my DNA. I don't like being the centre of attention, and never considered myself all that funny.   So how, then, could I serve it? I tried to just not, for a very long time. That didn't work. I started covering comedy as a journalist, and that satisfied me for a while (it was before Laughspin and Splitsider and all that shit, so I still felt I had value in that regard). Became friends with a lot of comics. But it reached the point where i had no choice. I had to get on stage. I had to be creative.  Fastforward through some standup (eek), improv (eek), and comedy writing (semi-eek). Somewhere in there I made the move.   I ended up writing, producing, and starring in a one-woman show. Partly comedic, partly dramatic, but all true (and very honest) stories about my life. I was incredibly proud of the show, mostly because it was so HARD to do. It was an hour of me - just me - on stage, telling stories. I worked SO hard, and it paid off. It's my biggest accomplishment to date.   I toured it in 2011, did a run in 2012, and then finally in 2014 I got into a big festival in my hometown.  My dad's side of the family is massive. Big, Christian, family-is-the-most-important types.  Almost all of them still live in my hometown. Exception: my aunt and uncle, who live a 4-hour flight away. I love them. When they found out that this festival was likely the last chance to see my show, they didn't even hesitate: they booked a flight.   The rest of my dad's family? Not so invested.  One of my other aunts and uncles decided they would hold a BBQ for the entire family, in honour of my out-of-town aunt and uncle.   Not only did they do nothing for me (fine), they had the nerve to hold this shindig on one of the evenings I had a performance. They gave so few fucks about me, that they chose to compete with me. And then send me an invitation, like they didn't know.   A handful of my cousins came to the show (and loved it). None of my other aunts and uncles could be bothered. Silence. Not even emails of ""congrats"" for all the great press I got. They couldn't be bothered to drive 20 minutes and spend $10 to support the most important thing I'd ever done.  But that huge BBQ? Definitely worth the hassle to hold.   Huge families aren't always everything you imagine them to be.   There are no guarantees. But most of the decisions you make aren't set in stone, either. If I wanted to do a 180 and work in an office tower again and spend my nights watching Dancing With the Stars and get myself pregnant, I could do that tomorrow. (And likely have my dad's family's approval, too.)"

When I turned 30 I realized my entire life was based around work and it wasn't really worth it... so I found a closer, less stressful job.  I'm pretty much free to do whatever I want at 5 on weekdays and all days Saturday and Sunday. My partner and I are also both kind of hedonistic and we'll happily put off chores in favor of doing something fun.

I'd have to say the opposite of most. My skill set is very much prized which allows me to pick and choose companies I want to work for. I live in a relatively small town where my commute is about 10 minutes. I choose hours outside peak travel times. Which is easier in my small town since our peak is like 730-800. And 1630-1730.  I could work more and earn more money but I enjoy having a life. I'm passed my partying stage and prefer early nights using the days to do things I love. I have plenty of spare time but I created this life for myself. I also have no kids.  I pay off all my debts like car and house loans as quick as possible. I pay my credit card off every pay check and refuse to up the limit. By staying debt free I can afford to take risks with my life. I travel a lot. Our holidays here are four weeks but I often take unpaid leave to travel more as I love to travel. I budget this in to my life.  I think the hardest thing about growing up is money. But if you are smart with your money you can work jobs that you enjoy without selling your soul.

I volunteered (work that I wanted to do, not for my resume) and had hobbies.

AskWomenOver30,3dv2nx,adjur,2,Mon Jul 20 21:24:30 2015 UTC,"I've only been out of school for a couple of years, but in general, for me it's about the same amount of free time.  When I was in school I kept to a pretty strict 9-5 (well... sometimes more like 11-7) type of schedule where I did all my classes, homework & projects during ""business hours"" on weekdays, so to speak, so my evenings/weekends/etc were always free for whatever. I was a comp sci major so working on personal projects did advance my technical skills, but it was also a hobby for me, so it wasn't like I was sacrificing anything to do it.   Now I intentionally picked a place to work where there would be no overtime, no crunch time, steady 9-5 hours without any nights & weekends type emergencies. That said, going into a field that's highly in demand allows this to happen a lot easier because I had the freedom to easily turn down job offers and be very picky about the location, company culture, etc. to find a good fit. That said, the job I ended up accepting was not the highest salary I was offered (by about $10k) because I chose comfort and convenience over the extra $, and I couldn't be happier to have done it. After all, something's gotta give.   So I've still got plenty of free time for hobbies, relaxation, etc. Also a short, low-stress commute through a couple of cute, historical downtown areas which makes for a pleasant trip home. (My first job out of college had kind of a crappy commute - not that long, but very high-stress as it involved going into a nearby city. I'm much happier now sticking to the 'burbs for employment.)  I've been with my SO for almost 5 years, through a good chunk of school and now as my career is beginning. He's in the same field (different company though), similar hours.

AskWomenOver30,3dsyf8,localgyro,22,Sun Jul 19 04:25:28 2015 UTC,"From the viewpoint of that decade, I will say this -- like any decade, it is what you make of it.  I know people who've turned 30 and decided that they were then old -- and it was as if by thinking that, they made it happen.  I know people who continue to make the same stupid teenage mistakes over and over well into their 40s.  I know people who are in their 50s who party at clubs and go to kinky conventions.    Don't assume that you'll get to your 40s and automatically get your life together and hit your prime.  We are all works in progress, and we are all the result of our cumulative experiences and what we've made of them."

AskWomenOver30,3dsyf8,localgyro,-2,Sun Jul 19 04:05:28 2015 UTC,and sex   You know I stopped right here. Do explain more. What's sex like in your 50s? (I'm actually a horny teenager and not a woman in her 30s you know).
AskWomenOver30,3dsyf8,FreyjaSunshine,8,Sun Jul 19 04:21:02 2015 UTC,"I'm 46.  And <shrug> I'm guessing it's a lot like sex any other thing -- it varies wildly from person to person.    For me, I divorced at age 41, after being married for 19 years.  My ex was my first-and-only sexual partner up until that point.  I didn't cum until my mid-30s (which I credit to my body's wierdnesses, not any failing on his part), which probably had contributed to thinking that sex just wasn't all that amazing.  Now, as a single person, I'm having more adventurous experiences and enjoying sex more, but I still don't honestly see what the big deal is.  I mean, it's fun, but so is going to see Ant-Man.  But I'm more confident about my body than I used to be, more likely to say ""what the hell"" and try something new.  Sex is a lot better now than it was 20 years ago, but not all that different in any tangible way, really."
AskWomenOver30,3dsyf8,DeepSouthDude,2,Sun Jul 19 04:28:43 2015 UTC,"I didn't cum until my mid-30s    Was there any hang up that you had to cross to get there? When you got there, where you thinking, ""eureeeka!"" or was it more of ""huh, so that's what all the talk is about""?"
AskWomenOver30,3dsyf8,FreyjaSunshine,6,Sun Jul 19 04:34:35 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't know what made the difference.  Up until then, masturbation was actually ... boring.  Like repeatedly rubbing your elbow.  I'd try it periodically, because I knew it was a good thing to do, but I'd get bored and stop.  And one night .... it was a bit more interesting.  :)  That first time, it was definitely a ""huh, so was that it?""  It still wasn't what you might see in the movies, with a full body spasm and hair tossing and shouting and what-not.  For a long time after that, it was something I experienced only with direct clit stimulation - never during penetrative sex.    I seem to get better at it with time and practice, though.  But there are still plenty of times where I just can't seem to get into the right head-space and I can tell it ain't gonna happen, no matter how much I want it to."

AskWomenOver30,3dsyf8,totosmaster,8,Mon Jul 20 00:37:08 2015 UTC,"I hang out in various subs, I have to confess I get excited when I run into somebody else my age ( I am 51 ) there are times I feel like a freakatron for my views especially when people are navigating relationship questions. ""Should I ask somebody out over FB"" is a big dilemma for people. Then I chime in and say no in person or chat on the phone and then I realize nobody under 40 talks on the phone now. So my advice is useless.  Even at my age I am faking tons of things and making it look like I know what I am doing. For the most part nobody notices because they are too wrapped up in their own shit or they are also faking it."

Seriously, a hand-written thank you note may be a throwback to the past, but if/when someone from the younger generation actually does such a crazy thing, it makes an impression.

AskWomenOver30,3dsyf8,lucy42,8,Sun Jul 19 04:46:32 2015 UTC,"Echoing /u/totosmaster   Things I'm happy with now:   living alone living in same state but no family anywhere near (they all moved away).  At least I moved out of my home city.  I was terrified at first but quickly got over it.  I know I could move again elsewhere and handle it. Being OK with someone hearing my opinion and calling me an idiot Being single.  I'd really like a companion but I'm less willing to compromise on some issues.

AskWomenOver30,3dsyf8,cyanocobalamin,6,Sun Jul 19 19:11:11 2015 UTC,"I'll be 62 this Thursday and I have been a redditor for about 4 years. Although I don't frequent many of the default subs I spend a lot of time on reddit in general. I spend my time perusing usually small subs that relate to science fiction and fantasy, a few television shows, and some of my other interests, Harleys, the Keto lifestyle, makeup and nopoo for girly stuff and you have to throw in some politics (I was raised in Maryland, worked in D.C.) and relationship things. All of which seem pretty normal to me.  I would enjoy some subs populated by people of my own age but I joined Reddit because I don't have any young people in my circle of friends and I don't want to be left out of the loop so to speak and end up like my Mother who's main complaint these days is ""I have outgrown the world"" and only complains about the lack of morals, religion and has a general ""get off my lawn"" attitude towards especially the younger crowd.

AskWomenOver30,3dczr8,Buelldozer,8,Wed Jul 15 14:44:42 2015 UTC,Here's a man presenting an argument a man will understand!
AskWomenOver30,3dczr8,MonsieurJongleur,6,Wed Jul 15 18:00:53 2015 UTC,Thanks. I like the way you think. He's a real man's man and this is definitely speaking his language.
AskWomenOver30,3dczr8,MoeBetterBooze,8,Wed Jul 15 18:21:14 2015 UTC,"Masturbation is usually a solo activity, and it's likely that he's not trying to intentionally not include you, but instead enjoys the freedom to do this without fear of being judged, be on display or what have you. Most of the time it isn't about a person's partner. Others have brought up that he may be afraid that liking butt stuff = being gay, and I'd say there's a good chance that this is part of it. If that's the case, then all the assurances in the world from you that it's not gay likely won't do much. It would be about him and how he views himself.   My thoughts are to respect his privacy in this area. He already knows you are down for the toys during sex. However, I reflect the sentiment of the wife of the doctor who says that what he's using is potentially unsafe. My advice is to buy yourself some butt plugs and vibrating dildos for him to see you use while you guys are having sex, BUT make sure that they have a flared base, are neutral in colour and just a cylinder shape. If part of this is about fearing being gay, he isn't going to use a pink penis shape vibrator with balls as the flared base, haha.  I need to note that my approach is non confrontational because I am a non confrontational person. So if you want to talk to him about it, my suggestion is to keep it about the safety aspect, not your feelings of not being included. As I say, masturbation is a private thing and most of the time doesn't have anything to do with a person's partner."
AskWomenOver30,3dczr8,mrs_shrew,7,Wed Jul 15 18:18:43 2015 UTC,"Fuuuuuuck I thought you meant electric HEDGE trimmer! I had a weird image, but was nevertheless impressed at his dedication."

AskWomenOver30,3dczr8,addtothebeauty,2,Wed Jul 15 19:46:28 2015 UTC,You weren't the only one who thought that!!  I did a double-take when I first skimmed over it!
AskWomenOver30,3dczr8,blu3dice,2,Thu Jul 16 21:15:34 2015 UTC,I read it wrong first too! Still shuddering from my misconception.
AskWomenOver30,3dczr8,rosiedoes,11,Fri Jul 17 15:59:06 2015 UTC,"Am I missing apart of the story, if he hasnt told you about this how do you know? Are you feeling weird because he is masturbating or because he is doing it anally? Either way I say respect his privacy. He's allowed to do something solo sexually without including you. Maybe one day if he wants he'll bring it up so anal play can be apart of your sexual relationship together but for right now it seems like this is something he is only interested in doing by himself. For safety concerns you could buy a butt plug, and just casually bring it up as toy for the both of you and leave it in a common place like a dresser drawer."
AskWomenOver30,3dczr8,rosiedoes,2,Wed Jul 15 11:15:08 2015 UTC,"I know because he slams the raser drawer (where only rasers are kept) each morning. It's awoken me up several times. He doesn't use the vibrating part but he accidentally turned one on one day without ""using"" it. Our bathroom is inside our master bedroom and he leaves the door cracked. I wouldn't have known but he's amazingly obvious about it.  You've got a man interested in anal play, whose very ""secretive"", doing something with a raser and not turning it on each morning before work. I just put 2 and 2 together."
AskWomenOver30,3dczr8,amgov,6,Wed Jul 15 18:18:56 2015 UTC,"He's slamming the drawer, leaving the door open and being amazingly obvious about his penchant for aquatic bum tickling? Yes, sounds like he doesn't want you to find out at all.  ;)  Buy him a toy that isn't going to skin his sphincter and leave it in the drawer for him.  That should start a conversation."
AskWomenOver30,3dczr8,hey_hey_you_you,4,Wed Jul 15 19:37:10 2015 UTC,Hahaha he's a walking zombie in the morning. He's loud and brutish. He probably thinks he's being pretty slick.
AskWomenOver30,3dczr8,kjvlv,6,Wed Jul 15 21:12:21 2015 UTC,"Bless him. Well, I stand by the toy suggestion, perhaps he won't even notice it's not his preference.   On a more serious note, try not to be offended by his secrecy. Sex and the City years ago had a scene about ""secret single behaviours"". Those things women do that are not things we share with out partners. Just a personal thing that isn't intended to be seen, but isn't intentionally exclusive either. Perhaps this is just one of his."
AskWomenOver30,3dczr8,Marsandtherealgirl,8,Wed Jul 15 21:44:55 2015 UTC,"He probably feels ashamed. Even though there's no need to, lots of men do because they've heard the message that only gay men like butt stuff. Reassure him that's not the case. And he should probably get a real toy."
AskWomenOver30,3dczr8,kjvlv,3,Wed Jul 15 10:53:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I would just buy him a butt plug. A really nice butt plug, like the Njoy Pure Plug or the Tantus prostate massager (if he's using clippers, I'd put 5 bucks on him enjoying the vibration).  I'd give it to him like any other present and make no issue of it. Let him do with it what he will. If you like, at some point when you're having great sex, suggest involving it. In any case he's likely to use it rather than the clippers just because it's better for it. Why would you hit a nail with a rock when you have a hammer?"
AskWomenOver30,3dczr8,MonsieurJongleur,2,Wed Jul 15 17:26:57 2015 UTC,"Wow these are great! Very unisex also. Thank you, I'll probably be buying something like this soon."
AskWomenOver30,3dczr8,Not2original,10,Wed Jul 15 18:54:40 2015 UTC,"here is how it will progress.  Your husband will push it further up his rectum each session until one time the muscle ""suck"" the implement out of his hands.  then he will have a running razor in his rectum and have to go to the ER for removal.  He then will become a dinner party story for ER docs and nurses.  I am married to a Doc.   you should hear of some of the things that are removed from ""straight"" guys butts.   Tell him to move to a plug and be safe about it."
AskWomenOver30,3dczr8,kziv,16,Wed Jul 15 14:29:33 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you mean by ""straight."" Plenty of men who enjoy anal stimulation are perfectly secure in their sexuality as straight."
AskWomenOver30,3dczr8,zeezle,13,Wed Jul 15 14:44:35 2015 UTC,"perhaps the quotes were not needed.   in the OP description her SO is ok with fingers and electric razors but not ok with a plug or dildo.  perhaps he thinks those are gay.  Just odd to me where people draw the line and their reasoning.  Like the old saying goes, kinky is using a feather and perverted is using the whole chicken.  In short I did not mean anything by the """""
AskWomenOver30,3dczr8,addtothebeauty,5,Wed Jul 15 14:59:19 2015 UTC,kinky is using a feather and perverted is using the whole chicken   I laughed like a crazy person at this. Just thought you should know.
AskWomenOver30,3dczr8,cathline,6,Wed Jul 15 18:00:22 2015 UTC,I also fear for his safety. A dildo or butt plug is much safer than a plastic trimmer handle with a razer at the end.   try presenting this as an argument to him for why you'd like him to get a dildo or butt plug.  You're concerned for his safety.
AskWomenOver30,3dczr8,blu3dice,5,Wed Jul 15 12:14:02 2015 UTC,"He may not feel comfortable yet admitting to himself/you that he enjoys actual penetration. It could be tied to views of masculinity, social approval, whatever.   But (har har) maybe you could buy a similarly sized vibrator and leave it with a note saying you want him to have ""only the best"" and that you're ready to join in if/when he's ever interested. That puts him in control and gives him space to sort it out while still addressing the issue and showing you're totally ok with it.   If you find that he still prefers the trimmer, at that point bring it up for safety concerns. Who knows, maybe it's a fetish!"
AskWomenOver30,3dcp8y,allthewrongstuff,14,Wed Jul 15 06:13:53 2015 UTC,"Life gets better when you take control of it. You make the decisions, ypu fight for yourself,  you make yourself happy, you give yourself validation.    You've picked someone you feel you understand cos he's had a tough life too but actually you're now getting double the negative impact, from his life and from yours. He doesn't sound like he can help you grow as a person so you should reconsider your relationship,  especially as he had this other woman (doesn't matter if she didn't want him, it's still betrayal). That is just my opinion obviously and it's your life, but I've had a similar relationship and we just dragged each other down constantly.    You need to get out there and do things that grow you, so you're not waiting for other people to tell you. Life does get better but it's not handed to you on a plate, you have to get it and you have to be discerning about what you'll accept, ie no low expectations."
AskWomenOver30,3dcp8y,mrs_shrew,6,Wed Jul 15 11:45:01 2015 UTC,"You are so young, don't give up on yourself. Yes, let him go because a relationship built on dependence never works out well. You say you can support yourself? So do! Let him take care of his own damn self - you can't be anyone's savior, even if it feels good to have that kind of power, it's always just an illusion. And it is a kind of power trip to love being needed, and doing that because you're lonely is really unhealthy.   First, you need to love yourself. When we are kids we look to our family to show us our worth, and to teach us we are worthy of love. For whatever reason, you didn't get that from your parents. So, now you have to find that within yourself. It's harder, but you can learn to love yourself and feel worthy of love.   My first move if I were you would be to move out. A temporary place on your own where you can dream of what you want, do the things you love to do, explore ideas that interest you, and think about the kind of life you want. Then you can plan where to go and learn to build a support network. That's the second thing. Look for people who like the things you like. Into movies? Join a film club. Into video games? Connect with girl gamers online. Into books? Get a part-time job at a bookstore. Follow your passions and you'll find others like yourself. Then you'll build relationships. It takes time. You will be lonely sometimes, maybe even a lot at first, but you'll learn to love yourself, and that will make you open to the love you deserve from others.  You don't deserve how your bf is treating you. You are absolutely right that we can't help loving two people sometimes, but we can help our own actions like texting. He is disrespecting you and you do deserve better.  One of the things no one tells you about your 20s is that you will be lonely - a lot. Especially if you never fit in to the world you were born into. Now you have to find the place you can call home. You have to tap into your inner strength and your inner light. Learn to let it shine. Just because ""home"" never appreciated you doesn't mean no place ever will.   Books that can help: The Hero Within, and The Hero With Thousand Faces. Literary self-help to help you realize your story is not completely unique. You are traveling through your journey in life, and others have gone before. Let their stories help you to discover your own courage and strength. You can do this."

Regardless, go see a counselor who specializes in depression and cognitive behavioral therapy.

AskWomenOver30,3dcp8y,blu3dice,3,Wed Jul 15 11:20:02 2015 UTC,"I wholeheartedly echo the sentiments of the person who suggested getting possible depression assessed by a doctor. But branch from that into counselling.   I had a similar childhood to you and really wished I'd have gotten help for my issues at your age. I'm now 33 and it's been a hard journey to sort myself out. I ended up in a not so good marriage and some unhealthy friendships. To get myself sorted out, I had to figure out why these things ever happened to me in the first place. For you, it seems like you are aware of where some of your issues come from and that's good, you can build on that.   And I do agree that you should break up with this guy. There's not a good way to do it. He will cry, be upset, possibly threaten suicide, etc. Please, please stay strong when he does this. I know it's not fair that these bad things happened in his life and they caused him to not be able to be self sufficient, but the thing is that he should be seeing a doctor/therapist and helped that way. And you are not a doctor. All you are doing is enabling him to avoid seeing a doctor. If he doesn't have much money, then that's what social programs are for, helping people who have barriers to employment. There was a quote I saw on reddit ""Don't set yourself on fire to keep someone warm."". I think that applies here.   If he threatens suicide, do the responsible thing and call the police. You are not a professional trained to deal with these specific situations, leave it to the people who are.   If you feel like going back to your hometown is too much for you, then don't. Rent the cheap room instead. Do what's right for you. And after you let the guy go, please please go no contact. Change your cell number, emails, change your social media settings, etc. You are already aware that you feel guilty for him and that makes you vulnerable, acknowledge this weak spot and protect both yourself and him by not allowing him to be able to guilt you into coming back to him.   And yes, be single for now and learn about what a healthy adult relationship looks and feels like.  You are not alone in this world, there are lots of kind hearted people out there, and lots in this sub. :)"
AskWomenOver30,3dcp8y,MoeBetterBooze,3,Wed Jul 15 18:47:35 2015 UTC,"First off, you're not nobody. But you are 21; you aren't who you're going to be yet. This is a crossroads for you.  You have so many paths to choose from.    You shouldn't consider one that includes you taking responsibility for caring for an adult man who's on his own path, who isn't able to care for himself, and who also chases other women.  You don't owe him that. He's not the one. If he wants to change his life, he'll have to do that.   Your dilemma is existential. It's hard to find meaning in life and hard to find real connections with other people.  It will be another 10-20 years before most of your contemporaries admit that they feel as alone and empty as you describe right now.  But here's the thing: they do.  Life has a tendency to look empty, and as you get older, ir starts to look a lot like a series of losses.  But you are ahead of the curve.  This is an opportunity to choose another path.  This doesn't have to be your life.   Join the Peace Corps; get a working holiday visa to another country (these are available even if you're not in school) and go; start graduate school; volunteer to save puppies or kittens; find something you love and fill your life with it until you get through this time.   Can you afford therapy?  Some people wait until their 30s, 40s or 50s to deal with these things.  Don't be one of them.  If you can, find a good therapist, one who will do more than just listen, but will actively give you feedback. Consider doing individual counseling for a while and transitioning to a group, maybe.    Above all, cut yourself some slack. I know you look at the future and it looks bleak.  But you're looking at it through the lens of the past.  Your future hasn't been written yet.   Be kind and generous with yourself.  Give yourself the care you wanted and didn't get, that you've been giving to this boy, and your life will change."

AskWomenOver30,3d9c9p,MonsieurJongleur,7,Tue Jul 14 14:51:06 2015 UTC,It seems that we are from similar backgrounds and circumstances growing up. My parents and extended family were one generation away from farmers and were children during the depression. Because of their limited budget the things they bought were usually not name brands and it seemed they replaced broken items regularly. I either read or heard that you should buy the best you could afford and have it for a long time. (r/buyitforlife thinking) So in my adult life I have done without until I could afford better quality things and I rarely have to replace them.

Also known as the Sam Vimes Theory of Economic Injustice among fans of the late Terry Pratchett.  Samuel Vimes earned thirty-eight dollars a month as a Captain of the Watch, plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots, the sort that would last years and years, cost fifty dollars. This was beyond his pocket and the most he could hope for was an affordable pair of boots costing ten dollars, which might with luck last a year or so before he would need to resort to makeshift cardboard insoles so as to prolong the moment of shelling out another ten dollars.  Therefore over a period of ten years, he might have paid out a hundred dollars on boots, twice as much as the man who could afford fifty dollars up front ten years before. And he would still have wet feet."

It is time for her issues to be rooted out. Speaking of roots, what is at the root of her issue? Why is she the way she is? What is driving this anxiety?"
AskWomenOver30,3d4deu,olily,2,Mon Jul 13 16:46:10 2015 UTC,I'm not sure.  I think her mom a little but she's always been really insecure in the way where she's really self deprecating and makes comments about how she looks and what she says and stuff. But since she had a kid it's about how she's a bad mother or how her kid is such a terror.  Which isn't true - her kid is normal and she's fine but totally normal things like crying at the dentist are presented as though they're really unusual and if she was a good  mother or wouldn't happen.
AskWomenOver30,3d4deu,olily,2,Mon Jul 13 17:04:40 2015 UTC,"her mom a little   Did you know her growing up? What's her relationship with her mom and dad? Maybe she doesn't feel confident in her parenting skills because she feels her parents weren't particularly good and she doesn't want to repeat their mistakes, but she's not sure how to strike in a new parenting direction. Or maybe her parents were very negative, always coming down on her, and now she feels she can't do anything right. If either of these is the case, maybe if you occasionally sincerely complimented her on parenting (""I love how you read to Susie, that's a great habit"" or ""You're so good with Joey when he gets tired and grumpy""), she'd feel more confident.  (Or maybe I just made a wild, random guess and I'm really out in left field?)"
AskWomenOver30,3d4deu,dinosaur_train,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:12:41 2015 UTC,Definitely the second option- her mom is critical and selfish.

Maybe when she starts getting upset, if you ask her ""What did I say to make you feel that way?"" or ""What made you think that?"" would help.

AskWomenOver30,3d4deu,dinosaur_train,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:39:38 2015 UTC,"That's a good way of going about it.  Whenever she brings up something,  my instinct is to apologize but turning it back to her might make her see and come to the conclusion that that's not how it was intended.  Like once we did something and were discussing hanging out further and I was like ""we should because (friend) is here and she doesn't come out often so we should take advantage. "" and she started making noises as though my comment was a Jan at her for not hanging out but really it was just she's here now so let's hang out.

You might even be doing something you don't even realize--like maybe you're looking down or away as you're talking and she thinks you're avoiding her eyes but you really are just watching where you're going and you don't want to trip over your shoelaces. Communication is really tricky--we pick up so much information from body language and tone of voice and she's just reading your signals wrong.

You know her, so you are going to have to figure out how to best approach. But, you need to figure out a way to spell out to her that she's been damaged by her mother and she deserves to be free of that. In addition, her kid deserves a mother who is free of all the baggage too. Encourage her to seek professional guidance. Pros are there for a reason. If she doesn't get help her kid will be just as unhappy as mom. Try to stop a lifetime of misery from happening before it starts. Post an update after your talk."

I also did not like how vicious and sexist the vitriol became.  That being said, she failed in a significant and public way.    I don't understand a for profit business model that relies heavily on volunteers.   Maybe the closest analogy would be scouting which depends on local leaders.  [Or are boy scouts and girl scouts nonprofit organizations?]  In such a scenario, significant resources are given to the volunteers to recruit them and  help them perform.  Apparently reddit has been pretty unsupportive and even MIA for the mods for quite some time.  Recipe for disaster.  Also a CEO is a leader who needs to articulate a vision and make it happen.  They also have a big PR responsibility in raising funds, assuring investors, and creating positive momentum.  At a critical time when mods and users were clamoring for forthright answers, Ellen was absent.  Then she made some out-of-touch comments to the mainstream media downplaying the users. Then after 3 days, she gave a brief, vague apology and left the thread after 20 minutes.     From a strategy and communication standpoint I can't defend any of these actions or non-reactions.  The statement released today showed much more respect and appreciation for the users and the mods even while calling out bad behavior and firmly stating that the inmates won't be running the asylum.   TL;dr Ellen Pao didn't deserve personal attacks.  She was in over her head professionally and needed to be replaced.

AskWomenOver30,3curo6,cyanocobalamin,2,Sat Jul 11 12:20:12 2015 UTC,"I don't understand a for profit business model that relies heavily on volunteers   It does work really well in the amateur/pro endurance racing circuit (anything from your local 5k to Ironman world championships)! I 100% agree with you though: any well-run organization will both build a strong set of tools and procedures for volunteers so they're never put in a situation where they're left out to dry, and reward them with exclusive value items, whether it's priority registration for another race or a volunteer-only shirt, etc.  As you said, Reddit seems to have failed on both counts."
AskWomenOver30,3curo6,kziv,2,Sat Jul 11 11:58:09 2015 UTC,this is a very balanced take.

AskWomenOver30,3curo6,MrsChimpGod,8,Fri Jul 10 23:17:23 2015 UTC,Here's a not so brief synopsis of it from /r/OutOfTheLoop.
AskWomenOver30,3curo6,harry_manbacks,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:58:53 2015 UTC,"The problem with that synopsis is that it's only describing part of the situation, the public part revolving around Victoria (chooter).  The larger problem that many don't know about is that Reddit management has been ignoring, abusing, and lying to the reddit mods for a long time. Trouble has been brewing in the back room, so to speak, for over a year.  The situation with chooter brought this to a head because it impacted the largest and most popular sub-reddits in a way that was highly visible and extremely uncomfortable.  Much of the stuff said about Pao is unconscionable but you have to remember that much of Reddit is under 18 and that's just how they act."
AskWomenOver30,3curo6,Buelldozer,10,Sat Jul 11 18:54:55 2015 UTC,"I knew she was going to resign (or be ""resigned"") as soon as the shitstorm over Victoria's firing started.  My inner cynic wonders if that wasn't the plan for her as interim CEO from the very start... being female, Asian, and the principal in a well publicized discrimination suit made her an ideal scapegoat for the worst of Reddit's userbase to take their vitriol out on.  (And oh my, did they ever.)"
AskWomenOver30,3curo6,DkPhoenix,24,Sat Jul 11 13:27:43 2015 UTC,"I absolutely appreciated the work that Victoria did to facilitate AMAs.  But, the truth is we don't know what was going on behind the scenes.  She could have been fired for very good reasons.  I think that leadership should have handled the situation better, and anticipated the white knighting that was going to happen.  On the other hand, the way Reddit has treated Ms. Pao is despicable.  There is no excuse for calling her horrific names, comparing her to dictators, and blaming her for ""the downfall of society""."
AskWomenOver30,3curo6,Neee-wom,31,Sat Jul 11 01:44:15 2015 UTC,"I don't feel like I know enough about the situation to comment on how she was running the company, etc., but I definitely noticed a Reddit-esque mob mentality about it that I'm almost certain (at least for some people) was influenced by her gender. That part I really didn't like. Say what you will about her leadership abilities, but many of the attacks seemed heavily gendered (just like how the media attacks Hillary Clinton for things they'd never call men out for, regardless of what you may think of her as well).  I realize the leadership and direction of Reddit is important to many people (and I do enjoy many subreddits myself), but at the end of the day Reddit is a private company and they can do whatever the hell they want. My take away from all of this, is that I wish this level of outrage could be directed toward something more meaningful to society, such as climate change or inequality. Just think what we could do in one day if this many people mobilized about something like that."
AskWomenOver30,3curo6,harry_manbacks,8,Fri Jul 10 23:53:02 2015 UTC,"I completely support the position of women in leadership roles. Reddit being a place of ideological progress (LOL), because it's part of the information age surely has allowed talented women to reach areas they deserve to be in. Yet, I'd say their gender had absolutely nothing to do with their ""mutual destruction"".  You're logic seems absolutely backwards, however. There's no reason seeing women fall from leadership positions should suck if they're removed for reasonable reasons, such as if they were absurdly unqualified in the first place. Pao being a woman means nothing to the facts that she knew virtually nothing about her own website and was awful at finding ways to effective monetize it, and her failure says nothing about womens' standing in business at all."

Couple that with their continued mistreatment of the moderators and blammo-PR nightmare.  I mean come on, did they really think they could fire the one person who made AMAs work right before a three day holiday when IAMA and other default subs had major AMAs on the schedule and no one would notice or care?  The mods were justifiably pissed and that's why they darkened their subs in protest. The whole thing was completely avoidable if Reddit management had let Victoria go in a controlled way with a published plan to pick up her workload.  Instead they bumped her out the door with no game plan for picking up her work and left a lot of moderators with egg on their face regarding their scheduled AMAs! They also damaged their reputation with the folks who do these AMAs because now it's obvious that Reddit is a circus being run by monkeys and you can't count on them to do things in a reasonable way."

There is a lot of work that goes on behind the scenes by the moderator teams and the larger and more popular the subreddit is the more work needs to be done.  Reddit management plays a vital role here because while mods can handle content they can't handle the website itself. I won't bore you with a comprehensive list so let's just say that the mod teams in the big subs are spending hours each and every day working around missing or busted tools that the Reddit management has been promising to deliver for 18+ months.   ...calling the CEO of the company a whore/slut/cunt has nothing to do with how usable the interface is, or how unique and interesting the content it.   I totally agree with your main point that Pao wasn't deserving of the sexist treatment she received at the hands of many Reddit users however the CEO is most definitely responsible for the running of their company and this case Pao was failing miserably. Regardless of gender any CEO performing this poorly needed to be relieved."

AskWomenOver30,3curo6,Noshiba6,3,Sat Jul 11 20:30:18 2015 UTC,"As I already stated, I thought she was ineffective as a leader.  We've all probably had the boss that liked to hide in their office when the 'troops' were spinning with panic and rumor.  That's how the user-side of Reddit felt to me during the 'blackout'.   However, I do think the sexual harassment suit brought on an additional edge of judgement and cruel rhetoric.    Any company defending against a wrongful termination accusation is going to have to show that they fired (or didn't promote) the individual because they were incompetent, not because of sexual harassment or another protected circumstance/status.    As a result, Ellen Pao had to make the decision to publicly fight her former employer, expose details of her personal life and know that they would need to paint her as incompetent to win their case.  She did that, it was in the news, redditors gave opinions freely and she lost the case.    Well, whether she won or lost the case, she was guaranteed a substantial loss by taking a hit to her reputation and guaranteed a small win by showing that she wouldn't be intimidated.  I don't think many of us, in the same circumstances, would have gone to trial.  The more women who are willing to take the small win by being courageous, the more it benefits the rest of us.    Me? I'd be too much of a coward to be dragged through the mud in that type of lawsuit."

AskWomenOver30,3curo6,ivysneeze,16,Sat Jul 11 03:48:12 2015 UTC,"The coddled little boys who largely populate Reddit weren't spewing their bile at Alexis Ohanian, who was probably making the decisions Ellen Pao was blamed for. But instead of a thoughtful protest against a few actions people didn't like, it quickly turned into an opportunity to call Ellen Pao a cunt, to make various racist comments about her, and to crow about her discrimination suit, displaying a collective utter lack of understanding about how courts work or what happens in litigation.    The latter is fine; not everyone can understand why juries and courts do the things they do.  But around the 15,000th repetition of ""cunt"" it became clear that it wasn't about Reddit.  It was just an opportunity for a lot of powerless, bitter, semi-grown men to vent their anger about their own failure to attain what their sense of entitlement tells them they're supposed to have attained. These kind of guys never, ever learn that they will never be taken seriously as people so long as they lash out like that and reveal their own insecurities, but they'll keep trying, screaming ""cunt"" the whole way, and wondering why women don't want them.   Conde Nast will still want to monetize Reddit, and shitty things will still happen to Reddit.  I wonder who they'll complain about when it's an all-male crew.   That said, I thought the privatizing the subs was a pretty cool method of protest."
AskWomenOver30,3curo6,unclebottom,9,Sat Jul 11 01:48:05 2015 UTC,I think the true face of this site was exposed to more people during the FPH fiasco and Victoria's firing.

Your post is literally no better than the posts you're decrying!  Anyway, if you think that Alexis wasn't getting blown up you need to think again. He was being torn apart in the back room forums where the moderators gather. All his posts were instantly downvoted to oblivion and moderators everywhere we calling him out on his bullshit.  I understand that most people don't have access to those forums so you can't see it happen and you didn't know about it. Now you do.   That said, I thought the privatizing the subs was a pretty cool method of protest.   In the end this is what brought Alexis out of hiding and made him stop posting inflammatory comments in the moderator and public forums.   If the big subs hadn't done this then it's likely nothing would have been resolved.

In my decades of experience, it helps to have both men and women in power on your side when faced with a cowardly leader who's using you as a scapegoat.    A few years ago, a male colleague in a higher position than me was trying to cover his ass about something that went wrong that I uncovered, because he didn't do enough at the time to fix the problem when I initially approached him. After getting one ripped by the CEO, I tried to give him my side of the story but he wouldn't listen at the time because he trusted this other guy more. Not one to easily give up, I waited until he and I cooled down (about a week) in order to rectify the situation and my reputation.   During that week, I talked with two other colleagues about the situation (something I rarely do, since I'm able to handle issues on my own and don't like to stir up dirt). I gave them details, dates, timelines, and my actions and words in contrast to the colleague that threw me under the bus. Since they know me as a rational person, and looked at the issue from the outside without an emotional involvement, they backed me up because they knew I was sharing the truth about this situation.   With their support, I approached the CEO again when both of us were calm. He actually listened to me, and apologized for fighting against me the first time we talked. It takes a ton of balls to say ""I'm sorry"" and he did. With clear heads from both of us, he was also able to realize that that other guy was at fault. As for that asshole who tried to ruin me? I've just allowed him to dig his own grave among our colleagues, which he's quite capably done.   The guy who used Pao as his scapegoat is like that colleague who threw me under the bus. Unfortunately, Pao didn't have a long-term reputation for success at reddit as I have had at my job, and it doesn't look like she had the support of her colleagues to back her up about Victoria's firing when she needed it. Pao could have said something in this forum, but she would've come across less as a professional (plus, it would've been harder for her to find another position had she attacked yet another company after her disastrous lawsuit).

If you gilded a comment that's 12 hours old, it doesn't look genuine.   I did manage to catch one perfect comment once, where on a game he plays online he'd helped out another random player. The player then made a reddit comment on the game sub thanking the anonymous saviour (my husband), to which my husband confessed to being the person.

AskWomenOver30,3co54w,BufordsASlyOne,6,Thu Jul 9 15:45:29 2015 UTC,"You're definitely not the first women in her mid-thirties to question her sexuality. My Mom didn't fully come out as a lesbian until she was well into her forties.   I think this is a delicate area to figure out. You should absolutely explore this new feeling you're having but make sure you're not doing it at the expense of someone else. What I mean by that is, you don't want to ring up your friendly neighborhood lesbian and take her for a test drive.   There are resources online that can help you determine if what you're feeling is based in frustration with men or if it's actually your true sexuality emerging.   /u/MonsieurJongleur's advice of posting in /r/actuallesbians is a great start and they'll have a lot more resources more tailored to the subject than you'll find here."
AskWomenOver30,3co54w,BadVogonPoet,26,Thu Jul 9 14:35:08 2015 UTC,The fact that you're beginning to develop and harbor harmful and intolerant attitudes and stereotypes towards certain people based on their gender does not change your sexuality.

AskWomenOver30,3co54w,zfolwick,11,Thu Jul 9 17:53:36 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say trying, but she's likely frustrated because the men in her life haven't lived up to a certain ideal she has about how men should be, think and act. This happens to men as well, though it's likely also true that we're quicker to be called out for sexism when we experience or voice this frustration.  The key here is that she needs to accept and own her own frustration and deal with it, because it's not the responsibility of the men of the world to live up to whatever ideals she has about how she would like us to be. Neither is it the responsibility of women to live up to the ideals of what any given man wants them to be.   All anyone has is the responsibility to be themselves and try to be a generally nice human being to others. You don't owe it to anyone to be anything else. End of story."
AskWomenOver30,3co54w,sublimesam,-9,Thu Jul 9 18:15:11 2015 UTC,"I think my situation is not necessarily that men aren't living up to an ideal (unless that ideal is be an adult) but more that all the relationships I've seen seem to dissolve into women being the mom and men being big babies and super sensitive.  Also, I've never had what I would call a good or comfortable relationship with a man, but I've had very close friends that are girls where I felt like, ""this is what I want a relationship to be like, but with sex.""  Also, at the moment, when I think about sex with a man, I feel bored.  But I don't know how I feel about sex with a woman.  I mean, again, I watched Orange is the New Black and if I could have sex with Stella, that seems like it would be amazing, but she is but one, unattainable person."

You already decided what my deal is, and so that's that.  But I think you're wrong.  Not necessarily about counseling, which of course, could be useful to anyone, but just your assessment of where I'm coming from."
AskWomenOver30,3co54w,DrunkOrHigh,6,Fri Jul 10 00:00:34 2015 UTC,"My assessment is that you have ideals about how you think men should be/behave in relationships and you have not yet been able to find a relationship that is fulfilling for you, and that you should not hold other people (men) responsible for this.   When I suggest self-reflection, it is because I perceive that you are taking your own frustrations and instead of trying to own them as your own emotions, projecting them onto other people and calling them big babies.   For what it's worth, I haven't downvoted any of your comments.  And as a side note, a person who writes off half the population as boring and child-like should tread lightly when accusing others of pre-conceived notions."
AskWomenOver30,3co54w,sublimesam,2,Fri Jul 10 01:05:38 2015 UTC,"What are these ideals? The ""adult"" thing? She explained that in the next sentence where she described her experience with guys that she finds herself having to coddle. She's not ""writing off half the population."" She's frustrated with her experience and hasn't found any men that intrigue her. She then becomes intrigued by a new thought, one that involves a relationship with a woman. Then she posts on Reddit to get some helpful advice. Then you come along and unleash holy judgment upon her because you've read far too many articles on Jezebel and your head is so full of clickbait nonsense that you have to chastise people on the Internet for just living their lives and not hurting anybody.

Sorry to have upset you. I'm not too familiar with Jezebel. I would have made the same comments to a man lamenting his frustrations about dating women. It's perfectly acceptable to become frustrated in the dating world, and very easy to do so.   I wouldn't have commented if OP had said ""You know, I've realized that I personally have not found much satisfaction in the relationships I've involved myself in over the years, and noticed that they have all been with men. While I respect men and accept them as they are, perhaps I would gain more fulfillment in my relationships if they were with women, based on my own needs.""   OP, however, externalized her own frustrations and not only blamed her emotional state on the men she's dated, but extrapolated to men in general, noting that her friends also date ""big babies.""  I was giving very general advice about taking ownership of one's emotions and perceptions of the world, and avoid making generalizations and stereotypes about people based on things like gender, race, etc."
AskWomenOver30,3co54w,zfolwick,3,Fri Jul 17 02:55:48 2015 UTC,"It kind of just sounds like you've only been involved with guys you neither like nor respect. So that's one problem. The other part of the problem, I'd bet is that you're modelling a hetero relationship dynamic that you perhaps saw your parents have? Or maybe you saw it in popular culture-- it sounds very sit-com-y.   I have had relationships where I had to be the mom. But I've also had relationships where the man was a full partner and we didn't have a nagging dynamic.   Now, all that being said. It doesn't mean you're not gay. It's actually well,documented that once people get out of hetero relationships into gay ones, the household division of labor evens out.   I remember reading one article about men who'd been married to women, and then realized they were gay, and got involved with men. The journo interviewed the man, who had happily learned to cook and do laundry, and then interviewed his ex-wife, who was understandably disgruntled that without a woman in his life he happily and willingly started pulling his own weight.   For his part, the man did seem a little sheepish about that, but gender roles are pretty hard to see until you're on the outside looking in."

I rarely meet guys that I feel like are really interesting or cool, but I feel like I meet really interesting cool women all the time.

AskWomenOver30,3co54w,cyanocobalamin,3,Thu Jul 9 17:39:15 2015 UTC,"Sexuality is a fairly fluid thing, and there's no right or wrong, or certain age it can change. And it's normal to feel confused if you feel your likes changing or if you discover a part of yourself you've hidden.  That being said, it is a separate thing from being a bit bored of guys or put off by their behaviour. I think it's understandable if you've been put off by guys if you've had nothing but not the greatest relationships, but swearing off men (so to speak) would be treating a random ""symptom"" of what's going on with the not so great relationships, not the cause. To get to the bottom of the relationships, you'd have to assess why they ended, any recurring issues, any ignored red flags, etc. Otherwise, the issues with the relationships would follow you into the gay ones, if you chose to be with a woman.   I'm not 100% sure I'm being clear as I have issues with aphasia and today feels like a rather aphasia-y day for me. So I'll try and put this into a ""nutshell"". What I'm trying to say is that if you are late for dates and stuff a lot and it caused a lot of friction in hetro relationships (the being late thing is a completely made up and random example), that may be something you'd need to address to prevent it from becoming an issue in a gay relationship."

I recently came back to Romania to stay with my parents as I found out my dad has lung cancer and has a few weeks left to live. He's too old for chemo so the doctor has recommended we take him home.   I've been here for a month now and I have a lot of feelings. I feel like I need someone to talk to about this stuff but my mom has never been good at discussing these things with me and she is very emotional too right now.   It feels good to be back with my family after 5 years in Denmark. I had felt very lonely in Denmark. I finished a masters degree there and I just moved to another city, Aarhus, to start a new job. I have no friends there. I have my boyfriend, it's true. But we have felt very lonely in Aarhus since we moved. I started a new job which pays ok, but my expenses in DK are not small because a 2-room apartment to rent is around 1400 USD. Buying is also a 10-20 year commitment.  So these things like having no friends and paying a lot in expenses even though I have a good job have been really getting to me and my boyfriend. We were depressed.  So now on top of that I find out my dad is very sick and I just don't know if I can take any more bad news or bad things. I feel like I'm imploding and I have no control over my life.   There's all the questions in my head about whether I should have come back sooner and be with my parents since it doesn't seem like I am very happy in my new city. I feel good to be eating good tasty food again and being able to walk outside and feel the warm weather (which is seldom seen in DK).  I'm just very confused and I don't expect any answers.

I am usually a fence sitter or a middle of road sort, and that definitely is where I stand on this.  On the one hand, some of the reddit CEOs seem crummy. I'm sure the moderator tools blow. It sucked that that lady lost her job. Users seem unhappy. Etc.  But on the other hand, reddit is a business. They are allowed to do what they want with the mod tools. They are allowed to piss off the users. They are allowed to hire weirdos. They are allowed to fire people. And people get fired everyday all over the world, fairly or unfairly. It really comes down to the fact that reddit is a privately owned business and we don't like the product they are selling, we can take a hike. Also, how many businesses have weirdo or crummy CEOs?  But then I go back to thinking that if no one speaks up, then necessary stuff may not happen....

AskWomenOver30,3bxogn,Poopkitty,15,Fri Jul 3 01:13:22 2015 UTC,"That's the tweet-sized version. The expanded version is that IAMA mods didn't know she'd been canned until a celeb called asking where she was. They had 24 AMAs lined up today and suddenly no support structure. Firing Victoria was just a visible symbol of the seeming capriciousness on the part of the admin team, and it's become a 'final straw' sorta deal."
AskWomenOver30,3bxogn,JonoColwell,4,Fri Jul 3 01:27:38 2015 UTC,"The goal is to protest the sudden firing of one of the main communication and assistance pipelines for some of the largest subs, one of the big complaints is that there is, without Victoria, very little way to completely verify that it's not a third party/an agent filling out the AMAs.  Other subreddits are taking this opportunity to protest against the general uninvolvement of the reddit corporation and  admins in the site, a consistent complaint is that the moderation tools are completely insufficient and out of date, fixes are always promised, never coming, mobile applications are also abandoned but kept on the chrome store.  check the big posts in /r/outoftheloop for better info though."

If none of those things work out you could find opportunities to work with kids or find a way to be happy without kids.   You have no kids now.

Upside: I have several other friends who were single into their mid or even late 30s, and still managed to have kids or adopt. One positive is that partners (male and female) by that time tend to be more mature, more certain of what they want/need from a relationship, and tend to share the urgency of starting a family if they want one. Courtships tend to be shorter and kids come quickly in many cases.  Upside: perhaps there's a guy out there with kids that's looking for a partner. I just married a couple (I'm a wedding officiant) who were both just <40, and the guy had two kids from a prior marriage. The ""new mom"" is an awesome addition to the family and the kids love her.  Upside: I'm in a profession where everyone has graduate degrees, and as a result often don't get around to investing in relationships until >30. I know 10+ couples that married late (40+ even) who then adopted and are raising beautiful children together in their 40s.

I thought I was going to marry and have children with him, and it just sucks to think that there is a very real possibility that I might not have children at all now. No matter how many logical responses you hear about ""you still have time"", or ""you could do (insert alternative fertility option here)"", the fact of the matter is that you might not be able to do that, and time really is kind of short now. And maybe I don't want to adopt or be a stepmom; I wouldn't mind doing either of those things, but I still want to be pregnant and give birth to a child too.  Even if I were to start dating someone TOMORROW, it would still presumably be several years before we got married and were ready to try having kids, so there you are already in the 33-35 range, which is obviously not the end of the world, but it is definitely a pretty real timer.

I assumed I'd missed the boat regarding having children and the best I could hope for was getting together with a divorced father.  It took me nearly 2 years to get over the break up and I was an emotional mess so didn't consider properly looking for a relationship until just before my 32nd birthday.   Got together with my now husband, and with us both being older our relationship timeline sped up. Not crazily fast but engaged after 9 months, married a year after that (I was 34), had a baby at 35 and now pregnant again at 39.  I understand why you feel worried about the future, but at 32 it's not 'game over'.

I think you're overreacting given that it was a fling, not a relationship, and a fling you wouldn't even have pursued if you had all the information. Could your response be hiding some jealousy?

AskWomenOver30,3bset2,turtlehana,2,Thu Jul 2 00:37:03 2015 UTC,Agree to disagree.
AskWomenOver30,3bset2,turtlehana,10,Thu Jul 2 00:59:12 2015 UTC,It's not wrong of you to feel that way but I don't think you should allow those feelings to ruin your friendship.   It was out of character for her. Just share how you felt and move on. If it happens again then question her character but don't punish her for one mistake.
AskWomenOver30,3bset2,turtlehana,-3,Wed Jul 1 19:45:00 2015 UTC,"Well, see, I'm not so sure it's out of character. The one-night stand is out of character, but she has a lot of flings. She often dates men that Sally and I find to be assholes. Her dating life is frequently full of drama and messiness. So, I wonder if just how out of character it is for her, especially given her response when I asked her about her boundaries."
AskWomenOver30,3bset2,turtlehana,17,Wed Jul 1 19:49:43 2015 UTC,"You're not the one dating her... she doesn't think they're assholes... They're isn't anything wrong with flings...  You should only judge her on her friendship with you unless she does something so reprehensible you can't comprehend; adultery, murder, abuse, cannibalism, kills cats, etc   Though if you're going to judge her then perhaps you two shouldn't be friends."
AskWomenOver30,3bset2,MonsieurJongleur,-3,Wed Jul 1 19:59:12 2015 UTC,"She does think they're assholes. My description of her dating life is actually how she describes it. No, I'm not judging her for having flings. I've had them myself. What I'm wondering if this situation coupled with her past dating history should raise a potential flag for me in regards to our friendship.  I'm now wondering if she would place a man above our friendship in the future, especially given how she responded with basically ""It's Vegas"". Meaning, if I were dating a man who she found attractive, would she try to pursue him? or if he flirted with her and she found him attractive, would she act on this attraction? I'm not so sure she wouldn't."
AskWomenOver30,3bset2,shenuhcide,6,Wed Jul 1 20:07:22 2015 UTC,"If you're pursuing a guy and he goes for her just because she comes on to him, he isn't worth your time.   If she does that then end the friendship. If you don't want to wait, you don't see any value in maintaining the friendship, end the friendship.   There is no way to know if she will do it again.  Is she a flirt? Some people just have flirty personalities. Have you discussed this with her and how you feel about it?"
AskWomenOver30,3bset2,UpliftMofo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:11:10 2015 UTC,"I think you're right, especially about not knowing if she'll do it again. I guess I had certainty before that she would never do anything like this, and now, I have doubt. I don't like having doubt, but you're right.  She's not a flirt. She flirts with men she's interested in. We did talk about this specific situation (I mentioned her responses in the original post).   I asked her about this particular situation and asked her about her boundaries re: if a man tries to pursue both of us. Here is her response: She said in the past there have been instances where a man tried to pursue her and Sally (her best friend). And in the end, neither of them reciprocated or dated the guy. Melissa said that this was the first time it happened like this though. She also said that this was her first one night stand, which is true. But Melissa was also like ""it's Vegas. So, I knew I was never gonna see him again."""
AskWomenOver30,3bset2,oopsgirl,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:17:17 2015 UTC,"Sorry I meant in the past, not after the situation."
AskWomenOver30,3bset2,SwiggyBloodlust,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:25:44 2015 UTC,"Oh. Well, we've, of course, talked about her dating decisions in the past. Mostly, in a problem-solving or venting or listening way when she was in the midst of drama. I've never had concerns about her judgment regarding men until this recent event (and few other recent events that are posts within themselves). So for me, it's a new view that I have of her. I hope this makes sense."
AskWomenOver30,3bset2,oopsgirl,4,Wed Jul 1 20:34:19 2015 UTC,"To me the issue is that she aided and abetted a cheater. That's enough for me to distance myself. As for her pursuing him, I probably would have been annoyed at the time, but having found out he was cheating, I would have laughed and figured they deserved each other. Feel free to step back from the relationship, but also, just let this go. People frequently behave badly, it's not good for your health to hold them to your standards. Just acknowledge their human frailties, and if you feel you need to, bow out of their lives."
AskWomenOver30,3bset2,Chalools,13,Thu Jul 2 00:15:30 2015 UTC,"I'm more bothered with the fact that she slept with a guy she knew had a lady back home.  Sure, he may have had ""permission"" or was in an open relationship, but would you really trust something a stranger in Vegas says to you?  She sounds like she has questionable judgement and, for lack of a better word, ethics.  This would probably keep me from associating with her."
AskWomenOver30,3bset2,SwiggyBloodlust,3,Wed Jul 1 20:14:34 2015 UTC,"Well, honestly, I was bothered by that too. Although I don't do one night stands, I don't see anything wrong with them, especially if both parties know the situation. But I was surprised that she went through with it given he had someone back home. I didn't know he had anyone back home cause he surely wasn't acting like. Had I know, I wouldn't have even flirted with him much less kissed him. There have been a lot of instances where I didn't agree with her judgment pertaining to men, but I just chalked it up to that she does things that I wouldn't do. Nothing to be concerned about. Just different strokes for different folks, you know. I never sat with the thoughts until after this incident, and now, I'm questioning how much I can trust her in regards to men."
AskWomenOver30,3bset2,I_want_that,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:28:55 2015 UTC,"Although I don't do one night stands,   Then what is the issue. Why were you flirting with this guy in the first place? Why did you kiss him?  What did you want from this encounter and what do you think he wanted?  You flirted with him and stopped things after a kiss. This guy wanted to hook up with someone. It sounds like you didn't want anything more from this guy, so why not let your friend get more out of him?"
AskWomenOver30,3bset2,MuppetManiac,9,Thu Jul 2 18:45:33 2015 UTC,"I think I used to be like your friend, so I think I can offer a different perspective.  It sounds like she has very low self-esteem, to the point where she desperately needed the triple ego boost of having a guy hit on her who was also hitting on you and who already had a partner. She may have even felt like she was doing you (and the other ladies) a favor, removing him from the playing field and ""taking one for the team.""  It makes sense to be careful of people like this, because their diminished sense of self worth can make them toxic to those around them. But if possible, I would give her the benefit of the doubt that she's not just a bad person."
AskWomenOver30,3bset2,UrbanCowgirl79,3,Wed Jul 1 22:30:55 2015 UTC,This was a great (and may I say brave?) response. As someone with friends who've been like this I agree.
AskWomenOver30,3bset2,CaptainCoral,2,Wed Jul 1 23:06:15 2015 UTC,"thank you for being open about this. it's not easy to admit, even if it's online to a bunch of strangers.   i don't think she's a bad person, but something is going on. i don't know if it's a self-esteem issue. she does tend to date assholes and will pursue men who are seeing (but are uncommitted to them) other women, but she also comes across, to me at least, quite confident in herself and her abilities. ultimately, i cannot call it. can you explain more about ""taking one for the team""? do you mean that taking this guy off my hands would be helpful because...why?"
AskWomenOver30,3bset2,Mloveb,11,Thu Jul 2 00:02:37 2015 UTC,"I also seemed very confident, but at least in my case it was a total facade.  When you are that fragile, the last thing you want is for other people to be aware of your vulnerabilities and you make every effort to hide them. You believe that if you are weak, people will hurt you, and worse, that nobody would want to be friends with the real you.  I dated guys who were taken a few times, so I can give you lots of examples of what I mean by ""taking one for the team"". The first guy I ever slept with had a girlfriend, and he broke up with her just long enough to take my virginity, then went back to her. I had a rough home situation, regularly told that I was worthless, was doing poorly at school. I was emerging out of an awkward prepubescent phase and didn't realize that I was turning into the kind of person who could attract someone decent. So when a cute guy showed interest, I thought I was lucky, and when he actually left his long-term girlfriend to be with me, it gave me an enormous ego boost, even though he convinced me that it'd be better if we kept our relationship secret, you know, so people wouldn't think that our thing had started while he was still with his ex. Even before that, he'd always talk shit about her and how stupid she was, and how he was only with her for the moment but would never marry someone like her, so I never felt guilty and even believed I was doing her a favor.  After that inevitable fiasco, I developed a crush on the boyfriend of a girl I knew pretty well. Her parents were strict so she couldn't stay out late, and while she wasn't saving herself for marriage, she was waiting until she was in a serious, committed relationship to lose her virginity. He told me that he really cared for her, but having to wait three months (or whatever, I don't remember) was a deal breaker for him. I was still devastated over the last thing, and I was too scared to start a new relationship, but I did want to have sex. In my idiot teen brain, it was perfect: she would date him, I'd sleep with him, and when she was ready to have sex, we'd end it. Of course it didn't end up that way.   In the situation you described, I can easily imagine being in Melissa's shoes.  I'm out in Vegas, at a club, having fun with my friends. I see you getting hit on, and I feel jealous. Why are you getting attention? What about me? Maybe other guys are hitting on me, but if they're interested in me, then there's obviously something wrong with them. Why don't the kinds of guys who hit on /u/icecream2354 want to hit on me?  A while later, your guy comes to chat with me. I have no idea that he's flirting with me, figure he has some ulterior motive, like trying to get me to give him information about you. It might look like flirting on the outside, but to me he's just being manipulative.   At some point, I realize that he really is interested in me, and I love it. Someone who's attracted to /u/icecream2354 is also attracted to me! I have value! But also, that's a really dick move on his part. And then I find out more about him, that he really is a cheating asshole. But he's cute, and /u/icecream2354 sure as hell can do better. And I don't want to be alone."
AskWomenOver30,3bset2,pinkpixy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:31:22 2015 UTC,"I can concur as someone who was like your friend once upon a time that going back to find him on the second night—and being rejected—is indicative of someone with low self-esteem who needs attention from men to feel okay. In my case, when I was much younger, I valued attention from a man above all else. I would hook up with the guy even if he had flirted with my friend earlier in the night in a situation like this where he was someone we just met and not anyone that my friend was dating. I would also hook up with someone who was already in a relationship. However, I would never fool around with a good friend's boyfriend. But I can't say where your friend would draw the line. That's unique to the individual. I'd go with my gut on this one if I were you. Only you can tell whether you should trust her or not based on your experience with her. There are many levels of friendship. Maybe she can be your friend, but just not one that you give enough power to hurt you."
AskWomenOver30,3bset2,cyanocobalamin,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:58:28 2015 UTC,I see some comments have been kind of harsh. In a way I get it: when you've never had a friend like this it's hard to understand let alone envision.  She probably is not a bad person to most others but she is almost certainly a bad person to her own self. That particular type of competitiveness stems from some hurt.
AskWomenOver30,3bset2,pinkpixy,3,Fri Jul 3 21:27:24 2015 UTC,"I figure you CAN be wary of her, but she can still be a friend. She might need someone like you someday. Friends can serve different purposes. She can be the fun friend, or the party friend, or the 'always up for something spontaneous' friend, but maybe not the person you can count on when you have a serious love interest and she's been drinking. Good luck!"
AskWomenOver30,3bset2,cyanocobalamin,2,Thu Jul 2 02:19:38 2015 UTC,"This is kind of an ""all's fair in love and war"" situation. There's nothing inherently wrong with her because she was interested in a guy and had an affair with him. It was in bad taste because she knew he was seeing someone else. But I mean, you backed off. This guy wanted to get laid, and it sounds like he wasn't terribly picky about with whom. So, whatever."
AskWomenOver30,3bset2,pinkpixy,2,Thu Jul 2 14:47:27 2015 UTC,"Or given that he was ""up for grabs"" that I have no cause to feel this way since I wasn't dating him and we both met him that night?   This. It was ""up for grabs"". Flirting at a party doesn't put a claim on a person.  Everybody involved in this situation was an adult and all activity was consensual. There are no problems here, nobody did anything wrong."
AskWomenOver30,3bset2,cyanocobalamin,2,Thu Jul 2 16:55:15 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I'd prob chalk it up to just being at a random party in Vegas, and she just assumed you weren't serious about him. Was it rude and sorta careless? Yeah. But, it's not like you kept flirting with him after she started talking to him, and made it clear you were definitely interested. If this was at a mutual friend's dinner party at home in a small, personal environment then I'd say it would be a discussion to have, when there are boundaries and it's clear the intention. For now, I'd just totally let it go, and yeah, your feelings might be hurt but you'll probably just forget about it in a few days. This guy sounds like an asshole regardless, so don't stress over it."
AskWomenOver30,3bset2,pinkpixy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:14:36 2015 UTC,Why don't you talk to your friend about this? Tell her how you feel and what you think about it and see where her mind was at?
AskWomenOver30,3bset2,cyanocobalamin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:34:25 2015 UTC,"I had a friend like her once.... I was in a social group with a lot of guys. We all had similar interests. So i invited her along thinking she'd enjoy it also.  Anyway, there was one guy i particularly liked and i told my gal pal about it. The next thing i know, she's all over him, starts sleeping at his place, etc. I was mad at her over it and told her but didn't shutdown our relationship.  So months go by and i meet my now husband. I thought by this point she had learned her lesson. She had a construction job that paid under the table cash and my man needed to make money some how so i allowed them to work together. The next thing i know, my then boyfriend now husband  tells me how she was flirting with him and putting her hand on his thigh. You know, really engaging.  So after that i stopped talking to her completely and she msged me one day on Facebook, ""i don't think this is working out. I need a friend break."" Then she promptly deleted me on Facebook. Ok...?  I never went after her men. When her ex asked to fuck me, not once but twice, i declined both times. That went for any of my girl pals through the years.  So i marked her off as a maneater and left it at that.  She then refriended me on Facebook months and months later, right before her wedding. She didn't even bother to invite me though we had spoken about being each other's bridesmaids.  So OP, do what you've gotta do. My advice would be to keep her at arms length and if men are involved, do not invite her to mingle."
