So, emacs is to elisp what rails is to ruby. I use elisp to build my editor.  As a knock-on benefit, emacs allows runtime changes (kind of getting at your interpreter thing). This allows me to either rebuild the editor for the task at hand (without abandoning the task at hand), or build a micro-editor for the task at hand (most commonly, executing elisp as part of a regex replace command)."
emacs,3dzq23,ressis74,2,Tue Jul 21 04:47:47 2015 UTC,"Im aware of evaluating functions through C-x C-e, and a cool function where you can eval and replace.    C-x C-e is powerful. You are already using Emacs as a Lisp interpreter correctly: whenever you see a visible valid Emacs Lisp code, you can evaluate it. Anywhere. Every buffer is just data to feed to your Lisp interpreter, instead of typing code in a limited REPL prompt like your Python prompt.  It's just that some buffer can hold other data other than valid Lisp code i.e. your text or image. But of course, you can manipulate these data too. For example, in Emacs, you have function that operate on text at point, or in other word, text at point is input to such function. During the development of srefactor, I use the Semantic functions that operate on text at point exclusively. For example, you can open a C file, enable semantic-mode and then move point on a function definition, press M-: then enter (semantic-current-tag) and you will get the tag information parsed by Semantic for current function at point. Whenever I finished a function that processing some C code, I open the a C source file and test directly file using the above method to see immediate results. The returned data is a list holding various information about the tag at point. M-: is another worthy tool to learn if you want to use Emacs as a REPL.  You can also jump to any loaded Elisp code with C-h f. You can inspect any variable value with C-h v. It's just that you don't have to type into the REPL explicitly as code. You are already given a more friendly user interface.  Emacs itself is already an interpreter, but it offers more than just typing code on a prompt."
emacs,3dzq23,tuhdo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:43:47 2015 UTC,I tend to use C-M-x (eval-defun) instead of C-x C-e (eval-last-sexp) because the former operates on the top-level expression surrounding point. I don't have to remember to jump to the end of the s-expression.  Edit: just noticed that @delbosforo pointed this out already below.
emacs,3dzq23,jimm,2,Tue Jul 21 10:27:32 2015 UTC,"C-M-x evals the top-level under the point. So you don't have to move if all you wanted was to evaluate the current defun or whatnot. No need to use the batch mode. Use buffers as input, and (not necessarily) temporary buffers for output. You also don't really need a traditional repl, just write what you'd write into repl prompt into the *scratch* buffer then use C-x C-e and C-M-x for evalling. There is also eval-region and eval-buffer.  The gist of my message is, nearly anywhere in emacs is a repl prompt. Say you are editing a function and for that function you wrote an expression like (directory-files  dirname) where dirname is a variable. You don't need to eval all the function or copy-paste to ielm, you can quite literally edit the experession where it is, and then go to the end of it and hit C-x C-e to see if it is correct. Sorry for the convoluted example, but I hope I was able to explain the gist of it. I use such approach all the time, and I haven't really ever needed an ielm buffer in my emacs use.  For some time now, I've stopped using shell scripts for elisp. What would be my shell scripts are now elisp functions. I compose them in the scratch buffer, I test them, and if they work, I put them somewhere. There is a function γ:userdir-symlink which symlinks my little corpus of dotfiles to my home directory, for example. I compose all my functions first on the scratch buffer. When I'm incorporating code from others, I first put it into the scratch buffer, I tame it there and then move into a file, if I decide so."

Handy when modifying .emacs and so on. el -> eval last. Just evaluates the current sexp and shows output at bottom.

emacs,3dx6t5,instant_sunshine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:24:16 2015 UTC,C-numbers is a better habit if you want to arbitrarily jump x rows/cols   I never understood this. When do you know you are moving exactly 3 rows or 7 rows? It seems way faster to hold control and hit n a few times really fast and then you are really close and can adjust. Where as if you guess wrong with C-number adjusting is harder.
emacs,3dx6t5,excitedaboutemacs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:51:17 2015 UTC,"If you use prefix arguments for other things, like killing five lines, or scrolling five lines, then it becomes natural to use them for cursor motion too.

(Also I strongly recommend helm to go with projectile, but it's not strictly necessary for what I describe below.)  Projectile is a popular project management extension for emacs; the important point here is that it detects projects automatically from their directory structure (git/hg/svn/etc.), and adds a whole set of functions that operate just on files in that project.  Perspective is sort of like a window manager for emacs; it maintains logical named workspaces and remembers what buffers and windows were open in them.  Then persp-projectile links them together so that visiting a project with projectile creates a new perspective for it, and this makes it pretty easy to flip between multiple open projects without the ones in the ""background"" getting in your way.  Altogether, this buys you: fuzzy matching on project names and filenames; lots of project-local operations; and individual project workspaces.   Very handy."

So I pretty much live inside of emacs (only dropping to traditional shells when compelled to by the fact that emacs is shit-ass slow at rendering large amounts of text).  What I do is make C-e autocomplete to a list of my open shells, and C-E open a new shell. It makes it really easy to just switch around to different shells. I usually have various shells open at once to be in the various places I need to be.  I use ido for the buffer switching, which is snappy.  Does that help at all?  PS. I would stick with the vim keybindings if you can! Emacs isdefinitely does not have well thought-out keybindings. I've actually tried to switch to the vim bindings before, but it's hard, because you don't have to change just the normal bindings, but every single other mode you want to use to. (Maybe someone has come up with a smart autoremapping scheme since last time I tried.) Also, I strongly recommend mapping capslock to control (a built in pref, if you happen to be on a mac)."

emacs,3dwsqx,ReneFroger,2,Mon Jul 20 08:34:26 2015 UTC,"If your problem is accidentally closing/killing the buffer, well, stop doing that.  Either switch to or find whatever buffer you want, or bury the buffer or close the window, leaving the previous buffer active.  When you start to bring up a switch-to-buffer dialog or switch-to-buffer-other-window dialog, you can hit the tab key in the minibuffer and it offers completions or use the arrow keys up/down to switch between the choices.   You can also use M-x list-buffers to have a buffer of detailed choices, that also offers buffer manipulation, etc.  There are lots of other ways to find buffers -- e.g., speedbar buffer-view, ibuffer, menubar switch to buffer/frame options, mouse pop-up menu switch to buffer/frame options, etc.  If you just have a few, then you might like tabbar.  In terms of keyboards shortcuts, it really doesn't matter because you can program your own -- whatever floats your boat.

emacs,3dwsqx,lawlist,2,Mon Jul 20 05:43:41 2015 UTC,"I will preface by saying that helm and projectile do make things much nicer if you have reached the point of customizing your emacs.d files.  Even without helm and projectile, you shouldn't be having this much friction. The biggest workflow improvement would be to not close your files or processes like eshell -- Emacs can handle it. Once you have a file from a project open in the current buffer,  a subsequent find-files will start at that same path. If you need to revisit a previously opened file, C-x C-b (or whatever evil-mode uses) to switch back. Learning to split your buffers with C-x 3 and C-x 2 may also help.  Helm and projectile simplify things further by e.g. reducing typing with fuzzy matching (helm) or knowing your version controlled projects and searching only through their files (projectile) -- they do much more but that is a general flavor.  Once you learn of packages like these, a good starting point to trying them out is borrowing code snippets from other people's .emacs.d configurations on github."

emacs,3djfrc,screaming_for_memes,24,Thu Jul 16 19:29:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think there has ever been good justification for their notability policy. I think at some point people on Wikipedia became embarrassed by the depth of coverage on certain topics but the lack of coverage on other topics that they thought were more important. But that has nothing to do with the goals of an encyclopedia. Traditional encyclopedias deleted articles to make room for other articles, but that isn't the case here.  I think there could be other reasons to justify deleting an article, but notability shouldn't be one of them. The best reason would be if the contents of the article became inaccurate over time and no one wanted to step up to maintain the article. Even then, the article should at least be archived, and put into ""archive mode"", in case someone does step up later.  But this notability stuff, in my opinion, is really damaging for Wikipedia. The main reason is that it hurts morale. This is disastrous for a project that depends on volunteers. When you delete an article that someone spent time and effort on, well, you may never hear about it. You probably just destroyed some of that person's passion for getting involved in Wikipedia, but he will probably never tell anyone about it. Someday he might just stop contributing, and find something else to spend his time on.  Then the people left at Wikipedia will wonder why they are running short on volunteers. After much soul searching they will conclude that the user interface for editing articles on Wikipedia must be too difficult to use."
emacs,3djfrc,parolang,8,Fri Jul 17 01:55:28 2015 UTC,"Add to this the fact that Wikipedia editorial debates are often amazingly bureaucratic and anal-retentive, with power users humorlessly citing chapter and verse of Wikipedia's voluminous policy documents (accompanied by intricate markup) to bulldoze the opposition.

emacs,3djfrc,atomic_rabbit,2,Fri Jul 17 13:01:27 2015 UTC,"Wikipedia has as a fundamental principle that any claim should be reasonably verifiable by any reader. Pursuant to this is that notability is established if the subject receives significant coverage by at least two independent reliable sources. This allows for an actual article (content-wise) and for readers to be able to verify the claims.   Wikipedia is trying to be an encyclopedia and not just a repository for anyone to talk about whatever they want to talk about.  Honestly it sounds like you don't actually understand Wikipedia's notability policy, which is fine as Wikipedia defines plenty of terms in ways that don't necessarily match common use but do have meaning within Wikipedia.   The best reason would be if the contents of the article became inaccurate over time and no one wanted to step up to maintain the article. Even then, the article should at least be archived, and put into ""archive mode"", in case someone does step up later.   Fortunately this flies against multiple policies and guidelines as it is a terrible idea. If something becomes inaccurate then it should be tagged as such and anyone who cares can come along and update it. At least it will be tagged. One Wikipedia guideline is that once something is notable then it is forever notable. What's worth keeping in a repository does not depend on its current state of popularity.   But this notability stuff, in my opinion, is really damaging for Wikipedia. The main reason is that it hurts morale.   There's a lot of things on Wikipedia that can hurt morale, but honestly I don't know the solution. Wikipedians are trying to make a high quality repository of knowledge therefore there has to be rules and standards otherwise it's just everyone's personal blog. Having standards means that those people who don't understand those standards (or agree with them) will find the process demoralizing. But it's the nature of any project like this.   You probably just destroyed some of that person's passion for getting involved in Wikipedia, but he will probably never tell anyone about it.

It's not even fair to compare Emacs and Vi, since Vi is only an editing method, while Emacs is an environment.  You can implement a method everywhere:   the Vi method is implemented in Vi and Vim, in their crappy single thread environment (even Vimmers will agree that it's crappy). the Vi method is implemented in Emacs through evil mode and many others.   Emacs, unlike Vim, is a great environment. The only issue that people seem to have is that the default editing method in Emacs isn't Vi-like. Which is OK, since most people are actually more comfortable with the Emacs method, and you can customize it instantly.  I think people have started to realize it with Spacemacs, which is a pre-configured Emacs that has the Vi method on by default. If not for the built-in thing that Vim has going for it, it would drop in popularity almost instantly, since Spacemacs is superior to Vim in almost every way."
emacs,3dfn42,yellowviper,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:52:17 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest reason I ever use vi, even more than it being installed everywhere, is that it loads up so fast.

To add your own, look into customizing the variables: eshell-visual-commands, eshell-visual-subcommands, eshell-visual-options.

For example, in your method, what if the lead key is say 7? 7 is pressed by index finger, and is less occuring. Though, it's a bit further than the homerow's semicolon, but improve by using middle finger than pinky. Would you think that'd be improvement?"

Just to make it more clear: with my current setup, the right pinky almost never moves: it's always resting on the ; modifier.

These pains have not resurfaced ever after; though I also switched to an ergonomically optimized keyboard layout at the same time, so I cannot tell these two changes apart. (Though, if you are going to learn a proper typing habit, it might make sense for you to also move away from QWERTY or your local variant, and my guess would be that the touch typing benefit using QWERTY is much less significant).  Another factor concerning ergonomics, which I noticed after my switch, is that typing is much smoother and less cognitively effortful than before, when my hands were moving all over the place, which would take its toll on maintaining a train of thought.

(local-set-key (kbd ""ä"") (kbd "")""))   (kbd "")"") is executed immediately and returns a string.  So your passing in a string, not a function. You can prevent the immediate execution and ""functionize"" it by wrapping it in a lambda  like (lambda () (kbd "")"")).  But this still doesn't do quite what you want. That's just a function that evaluates to a string and doesn't insert any text. You need to call insert to insert text."

So a frame is what Windows, Linux, OSX call a ""window"", and what Emacs calls a window is something inside the frame."

You can manage other frames in the same Emacs process from within Emacs. Or you can have the same frame, but with different window configurations using the link I gave above.

That was where MSWord, for instance, would have one outer window with menus and toolbars, and you could open multiple documents within that outer window and tile or cascade them using the Window menu, next to the Help menu? You could also maximize a document within the outer window and it would appear that it was the only active doc.  If you are then you can use a single frame split into multiple Emacs Windows, but it certainly won't look the same. With later versions of MSWindows, MS has started to go back to the SDI again for everything.

emacs,3ct7ih,VanLaser,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:12:56 2015 UTC,I do not really see the point of creating a new frame if you want to treat them like emacs windows. Just split your screen with (C-x 2) for horizontal break or (C-x 3) for vertical break.

emacs,3c61zl,Colada,2,Tue Jul 7 00:01:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure. Personally I haven't really spent much time exploring using the mouse in emacs, mostly because of the anti mouse stigma. I need to try binding double click to expand region, because that could give you the precision that you desire.  Furthermore, with emacs you can both map mouse events under a prefix key, as well as use mouse events as a prefix key. You can put mouse events in keyboard macros. I could console log whatever symbol I click on after pressing F7 (as an example).   I really need to experiment with this stuff and find out what the limitations are. But a lot of times when I'm looking at code and trying to reason about it, I'm not sitting there with my fingers on the home row.  But it won't completely replace the keyboard.

I have switched to Emacs from another application and have not yet put my hands on the keyboard. Occasionally within Emacs I switch to the mouse because of the scroll wheel, the ability to quickly & precisely resize windows and/or wanting to click links with a cursor. For example, a list of links produced by gtags can be very dense and often needs to be resized.   Selecting text with the mouse is often cheaper than a full context switch in those cases."

This can be tested in a terminal window or something like M-x shell within Emacs.  If that utility does not offer a listing that you would like, then the next step would be to sort the output with Emacs -- that would involve creating a custom regexp to match the output of the utility of interest (or archive-mode may already have a regexp included, you would need to check), and then gathering the data into a list, sorting the list, and inserting the list into the output buffer.  For example, I installed the full version of rar that does not have the default output of the free-rare for which archive-mode was written.  So, I have my own regexp that looks like the following and I modified archive-rar-summarize accordingly.  Such a regexp can be used to gather the data, and put it into a list for purposes of sorting.  (defvar unrar-buf-regexp (concat   ""^ +Name: \\(.*\\)\n""   "" +Type: \\(.*\\)\n""   "" +Size: \\(.*\\)\n""   "" +Packed size: \\(.*\\)\n""   "" +Ratio: \\(.*\\)\n""   "" +mtime: +20\\([-0-9]+\\) +\\([0-9:]+\\),[0-9]+\n""   "" +Attributes: \\(.*\\)\n""   "" +CRC32: \\(.*\\)\n""   "" +Host OS: \\(.*\\)\n""   "" +Compression: \\(.*\\)\n""   ""\\( +Flags: \\)?\\(.*\\)?\n\n?"")

emacs,3bsabz,ReneFroger,27,Wed Jul 1 19:09:06 2015 UTC,"Most people don't want to customize their editor, they want something that ""just works"" and holds their hand along the way. There is value in that, but a lot of us see more value in having our editor bend to our will.   Look at the success of sublime text. It was pretty, and it ""just worked"" out of the box for people used to CUA keyed programs. Things like in-file autocompletion, html tag matching, multiple cursors, and a nice theme are there and easy to use by default so it makes the experience much more enjoyable.  I don't think I would have ever stuck with Emacs if I wasn't forced to because of the company I worked for at the time, I'm glad I did but I really understand why people don't put in the effort to use Emacs. It is because the effort is really quite large.   Starter packs provide some of the ""out of the box"" niceness people want which is why Prelude and Spacemacs have been such a success, but a lot of long time Emacs users really cringe at the idea of starter packs because they cringe at the idea of bending to the opinion of an editor instead of the ender bending to the opinion of the user.  As such I find most Emacs users really don't care about marketing Emacs because the people who know what they want in an editor will find their way to Emacs on their own, and people who want an easy to use default experience won't ever be sold on something like Emacs. In the past I have been very willing to talk to developers about Emacs and I would try to convince them to use it and support them in learning the editor however almost everyone I convinced to start using vanilla emacs eventually gave up and everyone using a starter kit never moved away from the kit's defaults. Because of this I don't really market Emacs towards people, I just tell them it's something they should experiment with and after that it's anybody's guess whether or not they stick with it.  That being said, the main value in marketing Emacs to more people is building a bigger community and hopefully then building bigger and better packages that make text editing even more efficient for everyone. However I'm not sure this pipe dream will ever actually work itself out."
emacs,3bsabz,jordonbiondo,4,Wed Jul 1 19:25:36 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you.  I think it is worth discussing the ""longtime Emacs users"" and in particular the developers.   It's not only the issue of starter packs and defaults, but the conservative community has promoted a culture of Emacs not being ""for"" non-emacs users.     Emacs defaults are set in stone and there is no plan to incorporate alternate configurations along with the standard release. Not changing the defaults is of course completely understandable, since it would break everyone's configuration, and for what it's worth most of my more radical configuration changes are only useful because of major packages like Evil mode and Helm.  Still, including nothing out of the box is a real hurdle.  Emacs development is very cautious and measured.  It's not ""move fast and break things,"" it's, ""all breaking changes will come with an essay explaining to you why we are choosing to do it this way."" Core Emacs is rock solid, lightning fast and takes very little memory. However that's not the way I use Emacs, or I expect the way most people do.  I load up doing things like running Irony-mode and Rtags at the same time, just because it works, damned if Emacs wants half a gig of memory, I've got 24. When I use Emacs it breaks, hangs, has compatibility issues, is completely funky and an absolute blast to use.  I do not think this is not what the core Emacs developers envision for the software. This is really a detail regarding my second point, but close to home for me.  The lack of multi-threading holds Emacs back for me, a devotee, and I'm certain it is the same for prospective newcomers.  The fact I can hang my editor because I accidentally used grep instead of ag to search a large code base is completely unnecessary. However, there is no way to introduce threading without allowing the possibility that Emacs code breaks. I was looking in to why there is no multithreading in Emacs and followed the arguments about what is necessary until I eventually researching half-baked category theory) and realized I hit a fundamental disagreement with what I'd like Emacs to be.  I would rather they introduce threads in a way that breaks Emacs once in a while, because my experience of using Emacs without threads is broken in a different way.  But leaving a few question marks in the design documents is not the GNU Emacs way.  Emacs developers are very forthcoming about the fact they do not develop the software with non-emacs users high on their minds.  For example, the functionality of Emacs on Windows is far worse than on Linux, and much worse than is really necessary, if the developers prioritized the build at all.  But an official release of Emacs for Windows is relatively new, and it is explicitly justified as [http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/efaq-w32/Why-Emacs-on-Windows.html#Why-Emacs-on-Windows](a way to convert users from proprietary software to free software), not because supporting Windows gives them the largest potential user base.     While I have taken a critical perspective here, I should soften the tone by adding I find nothing fundamentally wrong with the GNU Emacs development mindset or that I would imagine pushing my own goals would have much success.  Emacs was my gateway to using Linux, and I think Emacs certainly achieves the goal of cultivating the free software ecosystem. The reason I like free software is not because of any radical economic grounds: the reason I like free software is because I can open it up and tinker with it to make it work the way I want.  Emacs is the Lispy embodiment of this philosophy."

emacs,3bsabz,chuchana,3,Wed Jul 1 20:39:05 2015 UTC,"This is a wrong mode of perception anyway. We should be aware that Emacs is not a text editor. Apart from web browsing, all I do I do in Emacs. Mail, pdf-reading, authoring, RSS, read-later lists (i.e. org-mode), some note-taking (although I mostly use pen and paper for that), programming, listening to podcasts (i.e. EMMS), looking at pictures, git (i.e. magit) etc., I hardly ever use the OS for anything. So in fact, the comparison is flawed, Emacs is not in the same class with neither of the products it is compared to in this thread. Maybe the only contender for a comparison is Rob Pike's Acme, which is a rather lovely piece of software I at times attempted to use and appreciate. Emacs is a generic platform for computing.  On the other hand, Visual studio and Eclipse are programmers' tools, they are only as generic as a car factory, they are completely focused on programming. Vi(m), on the other hand, and ex are great tools for text editing. But that is it, it is a program purposed for text editing. Yes one can use it to write mail or LaTeX, but still, it is a text editor, not something like Emacs.  Vim bests Emacs in text editing, mutt bests Gnus as a mailing tool, anything that renders PDFs doest it better than docview, Emacs lisp is a sub-par programming language, and this list may go on, but what makes Emacs the snowflake it is is that it is a system on which all this functionality is integrated using one programming language and that the system and the language are effortlessly extendible.

If you sit down in front of vim, with crappy customization choices, its likely to be configured similarly to any other vim you're going to come up against on another machine.  This is a bit of an apples to oranges comparison, because emacs as an extensible text editor solves a different problem than vim the ubiquitous text editor.  Where vim can help you with editing text on a remote machine after you've ssh'd in and need to edit a file, emacs CAN be used to remote in and edit files, but if you happen to be sitting on a random machine you need to service and reach for an editor, vim is likely to be there, and while emacs may, it certainly won't have your customizations.

Lisp may be an academically better model, but practically it fails. The reality is that the larger community doesn't like programming in emacs lisp. While I find the language enjoyable, I don't blame them for not liking the language. I believe there is a lot of untapped power in using external services (esp. with respect to my top-level comment).  To put it in other words, it's better to use grep when it's there than to implement grep in elisp. It's faster, less painful, and more familiar."

But when you need to actually use the info .. well then you use sed to rewrite these lines, but it's stream model isn't as easy, the syntax and commands obscure, so you use awk, but ... but but but and now you're almost wishing for something like a full programming language.  I don't refute the benefits of reuse, external well tested and performant modules, at all. But the lisp philosophy is pretty powerful, it seems to me that so far the impracticality is that the world isn't ready.  You talked about language support, IDE aren't that great considering the amount of resources poured into them for decades (until 2010s, only Eclipse Java refactoring was interesting, VS, beside nicely indexing the code base, was a joke, other languages couldn't be tool, php <5 at best had a preserving rename)  See racket and the way they stack languages on top of it. See courses about processing languages at the sexp level instead of dealing with concrete bikeshedding syntax, LALR parsers or ad-hoc PCRE most of the time. I can't help but to think that a lispy core would lessen the load for everybody. At that level of abstraction you don't need byte level throughput like grep utils, you need tree based typecheckers that sort of thing.  I'll admit, right now, I end up in python using sh for OS integration because it's a good middleground although keeping that LispMachine idea in a corner of my braine."

I'm very much of the opinion that emacs needs to improve its 'potential interoperability' with proprietary or bleeding-edge systems. Much of the draw of language-specific IDEs is the wealth of language-specific features. The fact of the matter is that emacs already has the framework in place to imitate or gainfully replace IDE features – the missing piece of the puzzle is language support.  How can this be resolved? I'm very much in favor of the daemon approach: write some sort of service in the language of your choice that can provide information to emacs (hopefully in a standardized format, so that it can be useful to other tools as well) and write a receiver in elisp to implement features. This division of labor suits emacs well: emacs queries the service for information, the service responds. This is usually much faster than trying to do everything in elisp – both in terms of runtime and in terms of development effort."

I wouldn't have bothered trying out Emacs (spacemacs) if I hadn't been told to a couple of times by other users (on here). And told in a friendly way - I don't mean ""you must do xyz"" of course. The reasons why I should try Emacs were always logical so I thought that I would.  Having something like Spacemacs to start with has been really nice as well - esp seeing as I came from vim. I understand the points about using defaults, not fully knowing the system etc etc. But for me the positives far out weigh the negatives, and I can always learn whats there already, it's not like the configs are all compiled binaries or whatever.  eLisp is a bit of a barrier for some perhaps - as it can seem like a bit of a pointless language if one realises one isn't going to use it anywhere else. I get that people would say one spends enough time in an editor to validate learning a language specifically for that editor, but to some people (possibly learners such as myself) I imagine that this is a bit of a negative. Whereas Sublime uses Python and Atom uses JavaScript. From what I've seen Atom seems like the best choice to many as it's open source and the languages used to configure it are ones that (someone such as myself at least) are more likely to be encountered.   I downloaded PyCharm the other day. It's slower than emacs starting up, the interface is cluttered and generally I didn't enjoy it as much. But I might try it out, though I'm unsure I've actually got the inclination to try another editor out now.  So yeah, i don't really know much about marketing i guess :P"
emacs,3bsabz,instant_sunshine,3,Wed Jul 1 21:17:18 2015 UTC,"My argument is simple, Emacs is a power tool. The analogy would be ""why do end users rely on Notepad instead of using Notepad++?"" or ""Why do users use a hammer, when they need a jackhammer?"".  Until their needs aren't met by low end software, they won't look for another tool. Emacs is at the top of the text editor food chain. A new user doesn't realize they have needs that aren't met by the tool at hand.  If you want to market, perhaps sticking to the power tool idea would be best. That appeals to users which are actively seeking more powerful tools and techniques and open to learning."

It's really not a huge problem that Emacs isn't more popular.  Emacs ends up being something that pops onto your radar, and perhaps ignore, as too complex for your needs... until your needs develop to the point where you want to try it out.

Vi is a standard, and it is a part of unix tradition. Vim is a good piece of software that builds on that standard. Unix became popular among techies, and vim among unix lovers, two groups that mostly overlap. Emacs is part of another tradition, which is distinct from that of unix, which is not as popular as it, which makes emacs less popular. Eclipse and other stuff are from a very different other tradition which does not really overlap with that of unix and emacs. Just accept and move on.

emacs,3bsabz,__baxx__,8,Wed Jul 1 21:02:25 2015 UTC,"Why everybody has to have this period of emacs evangelism once their life? Why is it a problem that it is lesser known?   It's often the case in this industry that the winner takes all. I think some of this may be motivated by a fear that minority players like Emacs get marginalized out of existence.  As much as I like Emacs, I do think this fear is justified. Emacs' biggest advantage is its innate flexibility, which it achieves through the use of elisp. Unfortunately, custom language implementations are expensive to improve, and elisp is already highly optimized for what it is.  This makes the next jump forward (multi-threading, JIT compiled, whatever) all that much more expensive. Without a larger base of potential contributors, the likelihood of those types of fundamental improvements being made gets less and less and the entire platform suffers as a result. (Even more mainstream dynamic language runtimes like Ruby and Python suffer from some of these same sorts of problems... Java and JavaScript have avoid it mainly because they've had Fortune 500 companies pouring money into their mainline implementations.)  If it's not clear why I've said as much as I have about the underlying elisp implementation, it's because the functionality of the editor is bounded by the functionality of the underlying implementation languages. Part of what tools like IntelliJ/Eclipse bring to the table is background analysis of large bodies of text... that requires something that's beyond the capabilities of elisp as it stands today. (For that matter, I've been told that elisp has proven too slow for something as simple as find a list of all files in a project...)"

Most people just want a tool to get things done - customizability is redundancy to them. Customization for most ends at selecting a theme from a listbox; some don't even get that far.  Even in the best case scenario for popularity of Emacs if it ever gets super trending among programmers, is that 95% of people will use it the way they use Notepad, with zero customization. But what is the difference between using Notepad-subset of Emacs and using Notepad?  There's no benefit to the community, no benefit to the Emacs developers, no difference to the user, and no benefit to companies that sell Notepad clones.  My opinion is that if you don't know Elisp, you're missing the best part of the Emacs experience. And contrary to what some people say, it has to be a LISP. I've authored many Emacs packages, and I know for sure that I couldn't do it in C or Python or Ruby (not impossible, just too big of an effort for a hobby). It could be possible to do in JavaScript, but I wouldn't touch JavaScript without getting paid a lot, since I really don't like JavaScript.  I've spent considerable effort learning Elisp, since I didn't know any type of LISP beforehand. And I understand that not every programmer wants to do that. For example, I think that learning Blender would be cool: making 3D models looks fun.  But I'm not willing to invest months of effort into learning Blender."

People have said something like this several times in this thread. It's not the reason. The maintainers of Emacs would very much like to include more packages. They're talking to the maintainers of Magit and several other popular packages. The next version of Emacs will come with Company installed.  There are two minor reason, firstly some authors don't want to fix up their packages to the quality standards that the Emacs maintainers want, or they're in the process of doing that and it's taking a while. Secondly, sometimes the Emacs maintainers think something is better in ELPA than in Emacs even though it's important to the rest of us. (They put nlinum-mode in ELPA, for example, I think that should be in Emacs).  The main reason though is copyright attribution.  GNU packages require copyright to be assigned to the Free Software Foundation. There are good reasons for this. If they didn't do that then they'd be unable to change the license. We'd all be stuck with GPL version 1 and it's legal problems. Also, the author of some code can change the license that their code is under at any time. People can rescind their contributions. IANAL, but as far as I know, nobody has successfully rescinded a contribution that was copyright assigned.  When a package is obscure nobody cares who contributes to it.  Later on it becomes popular the FSF come looking for signatures.  Then the main maintainer spends ages contacting all the authors and getting them to sign paperwork. This is what's currently happening with Magit BTW."
emacs,3bsabz,cbrachyrhynchos,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:54:15 2015 UTC,"First, I wouldn't go so far as to say that Vim's customizability is horrendous. For an editor that can open in a terminal in sub-second time and still have all of your key binding preferences and even some more advanced color and formatting stuff all defined in a single configuration file, it is quite capable. It is the ideal portable editor.  Now, I have my Emacs configuration pretty well honed at this point, and I do take it around with me and use it on multiple platforms (Linux and OS X at least), and it works nicely, but the first time I open it on a new machine it has to download and compile many packages, and it does take a few seconds to open in general (which doesn't bother me, personally).  Now, that said, why do people not evangelize Emacs? That's a better question to ask; not why Emacs shouldn't deserve the same public following as Vim (because it does), but why so many Rails devs and JavaScript devs are choosing Vim rather than Emacs. I think there are a few reasons.   Emacs is at least as unintuitive as Vim for a beginner. Emacs lacks high-quality ""getting started"" guides geared toward those people we wish to see using Emacs (the ""hip"" Rails and JS devs who evangelize Vim today). Emacs has a residual public image of being the Richard Stallman editor of choice, which carries along with it this perception of being crufty and/or not modern. Obviously untrue, but until people come out in force to fight that perception it will probably live on.   That's just my take on it."

IDEs are great if you're using the preferred language, the preferred build system, the preferred project directory structure, and often the preferred design paradigm. If you don't need multiple folders, a Makefile, a header file, a version-control system, compile-on-save, and a half dozen command-line arguments to get a ""Hello World,"" an IDE is over-designed.

This is clear after you ask what q does in evil normal state by using Ctrl-h k q. This tells us that:   q runs the command evil-record-macro [...] If REGISTER is :, /, or ?, the corresponding command line window will be opened instead.   So if you now open evil-commands.el to look at evil-record-macro's code, you can see:     ((eq register ?:)     (evil-command-window-ex))   So, that's the command called: evil-command-window-ex.

I haven't come to actually figuring out what exactly happens there as no amount of window.el hackery does away with it. Could be worth a bug report...   Basically, I wanted to replicate these mappings from my vimrc   Evil is a bit unusual in its approach as it basically constructs a type system of Vim's grammar. This has the benefit that motions and text objects magically fit together with little effort, but also the downside that it's hard to break out of that system unlike in Vim where you can just override what an operator does. As in Emacs a key can only specify a command or prefix (in Vim this distinction doesn't seem to exist, probably as there aren't really prefixes), it's necessary to decide for one, so a good amount of commands in Evil are prefixes and instead read in the next key themselves or dispatch on their own.  There's a few ways around this, one is using Emacs keyboard macros which basically are sequences of keys you'd hit. These can make for both a transitionary tool to migrate Vim remappings to Emacs or to do more advanced actions than simple keymap editing would allow for. Keep in mind that while you can state a specific Evil keymap, the keyboard macros themselves are brittle as there's no equivalent to the non-recursive option.  (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd ""j"") (kbd ""g j""))   The officially endorsed alternative is to directly bind the right command to the key or if not available, writing your own or replacing the official command with something selfmade. This allows for a more robust alternative to keyboard macros, but can be annoying for simpler customizations."

Does evil mode have the ""leader"" functionality. I searched for it and found some evil mode plugin for it, but when I tried it, it didn't work (presumably because it looks to be unmaintained at the moment).  But then I saw it doesn't really matter, I'm using "","" for my leader, and for example, just mapping "",z"" seems to work. So I guess "","" is a prefix key in this case? Asking because what if people used to use a ""non-prefix"" leader key in vim, and wanted to do the same in evil-mode? Not possible I guess?  Although, thinking about it, it would be pretty weird to use a key that vim already uses as a command for the leader key anyway. I.e. using ""s""  for the leader key doesn't make much sense, unless they switched it or something.   There's a few ways around this, one is using Emacs keyboard macros which basically are sequences of keys you'd hit. [...]  (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd ""j"") (kbd ""g j""))   That's really cool, I thought it was impossible to do such a thing directly. I looked it up before, and the consensus seemed to be that you always have to use the function instead. And to be fair, that did make sense, especially when I could not find any ""non-recursive"" option for keybindings. And now you just confirmed that too.  Although, I just tried mapping q; to q: and it didn't work, probably because q is not a prefix key as you and VanLaser said, or because it's a brittle way to do things as you said, or something.

Here is a link to a simplified usage of the display-buffer-alist relating to the *Help* buffer:  http://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/5754/2287  There are a number of packages by authors that create workarounds to restore a previous window arrangement or otherwise tap into the display-buffer-alist -- e.g., winner-mode, elscreen, shackle, etc.  On a side note, in Emacs we use the word frame to mean the whole kitten kaboodle; whereas, the word window is used to describe individual areas within a specific frame."

In fact, that's the example given in the documentation:   Sometimes, you may wish to define the same set of local variables to all the files in a certain directory and its subdirectories, such as the directory tree of a large software project. This can be accomplished with directory-local variables.   You continue:   Otherwise, why would you store them into a hidden file?   That doesn't follow at all.

Version control information is hidden because you are not supposed to fiddle with it. Why would you hide your project settings, instead?  Also, version control information is redundant.  If you copy the contents of a directory without its hidden version control information, the project is still intact.

As I quoted above, the documentation for directory-local variables specifically suggests using them for project settings. Calling that a ""hack"" seems unwarranted.  In any case, /u/vifon's suggestion is still the best IMO. Project settings should be editor-agnostic and editor-external.

Maybe hack is a misnomer.  I meant that I would rather have a file that clearly identifies a project.  When you see a .git folder, you know that version control is handled by Git.

On the other side, you list one very clear disadvantage - systemd craps out if Emacs, heaven forbid, asks something on exit, and please bring your own brittle ad-hoc solution.   Apparently, one can beat them without even trying?"
emacs,3b0qpa,monotux,3,Thu Jun 25 17:30:46 2015 UTC,"I meant the ""beat 'em join 'em"" as a joke, I have not really used linux without systemd and cannot speak to the benefits of running using linux without it.  However given that most users are running systemd, there are some small benefits that can be exploited by digging in a little bit.  My understanding of these benefits differs from yours, and regarding the points you've brought up:    This setup has been effective for me. I do not type emacs --daemon to start the server, and I have removed (server-start) from my init file. Monitoring with automatic restart is an important benefit for me since I change my emacs configuration frequently and often restart emacs multiple times in a session.  (I use Restart=always.) Starting emacs at boot gives the advantage of not having to wait for it, startup from desktop or terminal will be instantaneous.  Adding emacs daemon service means your computer will be fully efficient in using your CPU to start all processes as fast as possible. Suppose a user runs emacs in .xinitrc.  Suppose that all processes have started except for X, and X is the last process to start.  Then a multi-core CPU will be partially idle while waiting for X to send the command to launch the daemon.  In contrast, if emacs is specified as a system process with no dependencies, as soon as any CPU core is running less than 100%, those cycles can be used to start emacs. I completely agree these benefits are small and subtle, but maximizing small subtle benefits is why I choose emacs over other editors.  I did not mean to imply systemd craps out if emacs doesn't quit correctly. I meant that the script provided may not be adequate to explain to systemd how to quit emacs cleanly if you have a complex configuration.  The hang I described is the same as if you accidentally ran emacsclient -e ""(kill-emacs)"", causing the daemon to wait for confirmation without a client attached to offer it. For example, system shutdown is unaffected: shutting down your computer with a hung daemon is the same with or without systemd.  If you want to send sigkill you can run systemd --user kill emacsd, pkill, use a graphical task manager, however you normally do it.  Systemd pretty much views its job as completed after it has run the command ExecStop. All of this is a benefit in my view, since it is an easy way to describe a customized emacs shutdown process if your configuration makes doing so nontrivial."

emacs,3b0qpa,verdigris2014,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:00:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this, I've been using the 'alias emacs=emacsclient -c' trick for many years but I'd been thinking about trying to move to a setup that automatically started emacs. Auto-reloading is a big plus for me, too.  The one thing I haven't cracked with this config is loading environment variables. I'd like my PATH (set in .profile) to be exposed inside emacs, so when I run child processes like 'make' it picks things up correctly.  So far the best I have is to put in .profile, after I set PATH:   systemctl --user import-environment PATH   Which works, except that .profile loads on user login and the systemd user service starts earlier at boot time - so I have to 'systemctl --user restart emacsd' before the new PATH is recognised.  The only way around this I can think of is to 'systemctl disable --user emacsd' so it doesn't start automatically at boot, and manually start it in .profile after I update the PATH. However if I'm doing this then I'm maybe not gaining a whole lot by using systemd in the first place...  Does anyone have any suggestions?"

Projectile binds to these when ggtags-mode is enabled. In you're project buffer, try:  M-x RET describe-mode   and see if the ggtags-minor-mode is enabled.

You should still run the describe-mode function when you receive the error to check if ggtags-mode is enabled.  https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/blob/master/projectile.el#L1810-L1815"

emacs,3axzk9,agumonkey,5,Wed Jun 24 12:07:02 2015 UTC,"I have to say that I feel like a bit of a dolt with magit. I know it has a lot of fans, so I installed it and then stupidly set it as a my default external editor and then later went to do a git diff --cached for staged files and discovered magit opening up all kinds of buffers with hashes in them and I couldn't read it at all.   What do I do to learn to use magit more intelligently? I do all git work via command line, so I'm not sure if it's worth it to learn magit?  I have heard people complain about ediff-buffers for merge conflicts and stuff, but I actually kind of like ediff-buffers because of the side-by-side split with left-right selection, skipping, etc. Should I try to use magit for merge conflicts?"
emacs,3axzk9,erewok,6,Wed Jun 24 22:18:10 2015 UTC,"For me, at least, just scratching the surface of magit is plenty. I also do most of my git work command line, but staging (interactively, with colored diffs, and single key commands), and the integrated blame annotations and the gutter, these things just make the experience, and make sense integrated into my editor. I guess if you did everything in emacs that would be one thing, but I don't understand the appeal of gnus either ;)  So, my 2c is try using magit-status more and the rest less, and see what you think."
emacs,3axzk9,lygaret,2,Thu Jun 25 01:28:51 2015 UTC,I appreciate this feedback. I'll start trying to use magit-status tomorrow and see where it takes me.
emacs,3axzk9,erewok,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:13:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, good luck. I've noticed that people tend to fall into one of two camps when it comes to emacs usage: those that think of it as an (extremely customizable) editor, and those that think of it more like an OS in and of itself. I'm in the former category, and while I don't think either is better, necessarily, thinking of it that way helps me understand a subset of functionality many packages provide to me, as opposed to the other group.  Magit is a good example; if you use emacs like I do, where it's an editor with customizations, the parts of magit that make sense are those that you'd do in the course of normal editing operations. E.g. check the status, see the branch you're on, look at the history for the file you're working on, etc. If you use it as an application platform, you get all the other sweet stuff (which I'm not 100% on, so I won't talk too much about).  I tend to think of the whole thing like this: would you use an external application for a task if the time to context switch was negligable? If so, the emacs mode (magit, gnus, the various shells, the bug tracker integrations, etc.) makes sense. If you wouldn't, either because you already have a system you like or it's not actually a burden to do it the original way, there's still a ton of use from those packages, it's just a subset that actually gets used.  Rambling at this point, but I wanted to get something more explicit out there ;)  Edit: full disclosure, I'm a vim convert to evil-mode, and that experience helps me think of emacs as an application platform with a really good editor (evil), which means I tend to look critically at the other modes and ask if I'd use them as a feature of my editor, rather than as a separate application. Most I wouldn't, but that's just my workflow."
emacs,3axzk9,lygaret,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:50:18 2015 UTC,I think you're probably on the right track in that I didn't give it enough thought when I just tried to use it as my external diffing tool and that I really didn't learn to use magit properly or with the proper mindframe.  I have been inspired by these comments to give it a fair shake.
emacs,3axzk9,erewok,2,Thu Jun 25 22:25:22 2015 UTC,"Magit is awesome for 3 reasons. It makes everything a little easier, it makes a few things absurdly easier, and it improves discoverability all around.     Just start with Magit-status, pulling, commiting and pushing. There's nothing magic about that part, but it's a nice interface that makes your life a little easier.   At the end you'll get so used to staging and commiting partial hunks, discovering commands without having to Google, and to having a nice interface for everything, that you'll never want to go back.   The stuff that happens between the start and the end is just a big blur where I have no recollection."
emacs,3axzk9,BruceConnor,2,Thu Jun 25 01:41:06 2015 UTC,"If I'm reading you correctly you're still using git from the command line, but having it launch emacs/magit when it wants an editor?  If so, this sounds like swimming upstream.  Overall, it's a git environment, much less a tool to aid command-line git.  I pretty much never use the git command line except to clone.  Mostly it means that all activities have shortcuts that amount to a couple of keys, like having a comprehensive set of aliases in your command line, and things like partial staging and reviewing commits become very streamlined and easy.  Many items, like in logs and commits, are interactive, so from them you can drill down to the logical item it's referencing.  Select a log line to see that commit, select a commit line to go to that point in the file, select a branch name to check out that branch...  So unless I'm reading you wrong, you'd do much better with magit if you saw it as an all-encompassing way to interact with git, rather than a tool to help your command line git.  If that doesn't fly with you, I suspect magit isn't for you.  Learning it is very easy and straightforward because of the hydra-like interface it offers - hit ? to see the keys available, and when you hit a key it'll show you all the options for that.  I use Projectile, and have it by default jump me to a magit-status window when I enter a project ('(projectile-switch-project-action (quote projectile-vc))).  That becomes my default view and jumping-off point for a project.  Works very nicely.  I use ediff for merging from magit - I'm not sure I get your last point/question?"
emacs,3axzk9,fantastipants,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:12:01 2015 UTC,Your comment and others have forced me to realize I have used magit poorly in the past and that I need to reconsider how I approach it. I think I never properly conceived of it before and it led to frustrations.

The way Yegge describes it makes every instance of a variable names foo buffer local. In every buffer across Emacs, not just the one you're programming a mode for.

It was based on Maclisp which was a predecessor to Common Lisp. Over the years Elisp has become more similar to Common Lisp. So, it's a good idea to read about Common Lisp too.

emacs,3aprkn,augmentedtree,5,Mon Jun 22 14:44:44 2015 UTC,"nlinum provides line numbering, it's fast and works well for large files. That's because it uses jit-lock for the fontification.  It only font-locks the lines on-screen.  This mode is based on linum which doesn't use jit-lock. I think that's why it's slow.  I don't think that calculating offset through the whole buffer is the problem. Emacs often does that. Internally the buffer data structure has a cache of where each line break occurs to make operations like that faster.  You should report it as a bug to the author. It would probably be reasonably simple to compare it's code against nlinum and fix it yourself."
emacs,3aprkn,RobThorpe,2,Mon Jun 22 15:26:02 2015 UTC,"Any source on the cache thing? I find the existence of such a thing a bit hard to believe considering the long lines bug is still a thing. If it exists, then I'm surprised it isn't made use of."
emacs,3aprkn,wasamasa,2,Mon Jun 22 17:41:22 2015 UTC,"By ""the long lines bug"" I assume you mean the very slow performance of files where all the data is on one single line?  Like the XML files some tools generate?  That hasn't been solved, as I understand it most of those problems are because language modes assume that there will be many lines and each line will be short.  They use jit-lock-regions and regex in corresponding ways, but this breaks with long single-lines, they end up scanning the whole buffer.  But this doesn't have much to do with the newline cache.  I should have been more explicit, the cache is of newlines in the buffer, not ones on the screen. It doesn't deal with lines wrapped by visual-line-mode.  It helps Emacs put point in the right place when skipping over very long lines.  See the variable ""cache-long-line-scans"" or ""cache-long-scans"". In the buffer structure it's the field newline_cache."
emacs,3aprkn,RobThorpe,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:04:13 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reference. Perhaps it's possible to extend it for screen lines as well to end this annoyance once and for all.  The described phenomenon also happens when it's all short lines save for a single long line which is very annoying as it happens once in a while in REPL buffers and renders them inoperable.
emacs,3aprkn,wasamasa,1 point,Tue Jun 23 09:58:39 2015 UTC,"I think it would be difficult. Like many things with Emacs the problem is the high-level code and it's very difficult to fix at the low-level. Many people (me included) write regex with ^ and $ in them. If there's one very long line then those regex will match huge amounts of stuff. Syntax tables do the same thing. Think about a C program that's all on one line, Emacs has to look for ""//"" and then mark the rest as a comment if it finds that. Doing that requires going through the whole line. For jit-lock regions start and end with particular lines. These things can't really be stopped. The regex engine could be faster, but that wouldn't fix the problem entirely.  For REPLs it may be easier to fix it though. When one long line occurs it will make things slow, once. But, once it's been processed and font-locked there's no reason why that should happen again. It is done again because font-locking in REPL buffers generally works the same way that it does for normal editing buffers."
emacs,3aprkn,RobThorpe,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:52:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks again, if this is the reason for most of these slowdowns, then there's at least hope that it's not that hard to fix for the individual modes."
emacs,3aprkn,wasamasa,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:04:39 2015 UTC,"I believe the long lines issue even occurs in plain text buffers -- emacs has a problem rendering them. Using visual line mode fixes it for me, which only changes rendering, not the lines code traversing the buffer would see."

emacs,3aprkn,BruceConnor,3,Mon Jun 22 15:00:40 2015 UTC,Why do you need to calculate the distance from the whole buffer for relative line numberings? Just count newlines from point in both directions until you're outside the window.
emacs,3aprkn,hvis,2,Mon Jun 22 17:38:22 2015 UTC,"Indeed. You don't usually need to see the numbers when editing, and when you do want to go to a certain line number, it's better to use M-g M-g."
emacs,3aprkn,lawlist,2,Mon Jun 22 15:00:45 2015 UTC,"At some point, someone may wish to release a minor mode that uses just window-start and window-end and replaces line-number-at-pos with (format-mode-line ""%l"") -- in combination with the post-command-hook and window-scroll-functions hook.  This would make it lightening quick (even for humungous buffers), but anything not in the visible window will not have line numbers, e.g., another window displaying the same buffer at a different position will not have line numbers displayed.  It can be done fairly easily using the following concept for calculating window-start and window-end prior to redisplay:  http://stackoverflow.com/a/24216247/2112489  This method also reduces the number of calls to the overlay function -- thus making it extremely efficient.  I do this with a custom minor mode for drawing line numbers (although not relative) and displaying a thin cross-hair spanning the four window edges."
emacs,3aprkn,ducketh,2,Mon Jun 22 17:35:58 2015 UTC,"If I'm understanding this correctly, it doesn't account for visual lines.

BTW if I'm wrong, please tell me, I'd love if it were this easy (I'd be using relative linums all the time if they weren't so slow)"
emacs,3aprkn,lawlist,2,Tue Jun 23 02:19:29 2015 UTC,"In the regular version of linum, a wrapped line will have only one line number at the beginning of the line, even though it may be wrapped several screen lines.  I remember putting in a special condition for when the beginning of the line was above window-start.  Folded lines will have line numbers, but the folded portions will not be visible and neither will the line numbers.  The main time-suck comes from the function line-number-at-pos and from placing overlays over the entire buffer from top to bottom.  (format-mode-line ""%l"") only works for visual lines where point is visible, but that is all that is needed for the concept outlined in my comment above -- format-mode-line comes from the C-source code and is lightening quick, whereas the lisp version of line-number-at-pos walks each line one by one from top to bottom of the buffer.  To be honest, I've never used relative line numbers and haven't ever thought about how that might be implemented.  However, I've spent a zillion hours writing and modifying my custom minor mode that uses regular line numbers (and cross-hairs) from just window-start to window-end -- and I've spent time with the measure-time clock to save every tenth to hundredth of a second possible given the constraints of Emacs.  To deal with line numbering each and every wrapped visual lines, if that is what you want, that would require using vertical-motion on each visual-line to gather the data as to the various positions."

IDEs are great for some things.  Most features can be assembled in emacs, but it's more of a 'roll-your-own' methodology.  Auto-complete is great, language-modes are a must, lint-like minor-modes are very nice (flycheck for example).

Who should care about it and who should ignore it?   You, and only you.    All of this holds true for emacs, or vi, or whatever.  Use whatever makes your work-flow the easiest/quickest/least-stressful.  Open-source editors like emacs/vi are nice because they tend to work across platforms.  On a daily basis I use Windows for email/web/Office applications, but always have VNC open on a Linux machine and end up SSH'ing around various networks with various OS flavors and emacs versions.  At home I use OS X.  I like that (after a bit of fiddling) my emacs configurations work pretty seamlessly across all these flavors (different OSes, GUI and terminal, emacs 21.? - 24.4).  The same cannot be said for Visual Studio.  edit: formatting"

emacs,3aiji5,acr4,9,Mon Jun 22 02:35:33 2015 UTC,"I'm a happy Emacs user but I think your questions are very good and totally valid.  Of course people in this forum will argue that Emacs is superior to other tools and that the (considerable) investment of time is worth it.  However, the truth is that Emacs is not for everyone.  I'm a researcher and that means that 90% my of work consists of manipulating text: I write emails, research articles, code for data analysis, etc.  So for me it is crucial to optimize the task of producing text and Emacs allows me to do this.  Also, doing all those activities in one application gives me a consistent interface and when I discover a new way to improve text editing, all my daily tasks benefit from that, not just one.  Many of my colleagues are impressed when they see me working in Emacs because to them it looks like magic.  However, when they ask whether I recommend switching to Emacs, I hesitate because I know how much effort it was to make myself feel at home in Emacs.  The truth is that in the time that it took me to learn Emacs I could have written several research articles.  Will my investment in Emacs eventually pay off, I can't tell.  What I can tell is that my work has become so much more pleasant with Emacs.  When I don't like how some task is done in Emacs, I simply change it.  Emacs adapts to my way of thinking in contrast to other tools which require me to adapt to what their developers thought would be the best way to do things.  That's why working with Emacs is a liberating experience and a lot of fun, and I believe that this will ultimately also be reflected in the quality of my work."
emacs,3aiji5,tmalsburg2,8,Sat Jun 20 18:17:33 2015 UTC,"A portable editor like Emacs or Vim can stay with you across jobs and programming environments.  You can't say that about IDEs.  I've had jobs where my desktop systems were IRIX, Solaris, Windows, Mac and Linux.  Emacs works well on all of them.  An IDE tends to be great for coding in particular languages.  In many jobs you will be coding in multiple languages.  If you code in an IDE for some language it doesn't understand you basically have a vanilla text editor.  I generally find the uniformity of editor a win over the power of an IDE in a particular language.  That said, I have mostly programmed in C++ for the past 20 years.  The one year I programmed in Java I did use a Java IDE for compiling, debugging, and code browsing.  First thing I did, though, was add a ""open this file in Emacs"" button to it for when I actually needed to do serious editing.  For example, the IDEs formatting capabilities for code comments sucked in comparison to Emacs."
emacs,3aiji5,ForkInBrain,2,Sat Jun 20 16:27:42 2015 UTC,"Existing IDEs are often better than emacs in some ways, I've found. Code browsing, code completion and refactoring are usually at least slicker and quicker to set up, if not outright better, than they are in emacs. The text editing is usually pretty ropey (e.g., Visual Studio and Xcode won't even word wrap comments without a plugin, and there's no keyboard macro support), but overall that's never bothered me too much. On most large team projects I've worked on, easy and reliable code navigation/completion/refactoring has proven more important day to day.  For languages there's no existing IDE for, though, emacs can be turned into something perfectly tolerable with very little effort. It's pretty easy to add support to exuberant ctags for custom languages (see, e.g., http://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/2mnmhr/use_simple_regex_to_extract_imenu_items_in_js2mode/cm60d9c). Now you can generate emacs-friendly tags tables, and you've got basic code browsing. (Then squint a bit, and you could even imagine dabbrev is code completion!) Then ten minutes with elisp and you'll have a major mode with comment-dwim, basic syntax highlighting, imenu support, and (where applicable) compilation error regexps. A bit more effort, and you'll have auto indent as well.  I've done this several times, for various languages. The alternative is often stumbling along in notepad++, or Visual Studio, or whatever, pretending your custom language is C (so you at least get the right syntax highlighting for comments), and navigating code by doing repeated file searches. Even if you only think in terms of making the daily grind go a little bit more smoothly, the time spent on putting together a usable emacs setup gives a good return on investment."

IDEs are untouchable when it comes to languages like java/c#, but for dynamic languages editors are extremely capable.  also, contrary to propaganda, you don't have to live in emacs for everything.  yes, it comes with a web browser, but i'll use a real one thank you.  use the best tool for the job. if your point of comparison is java, then probably 100 man years, because that's probably how much resources have been poured into eclipse, intellij, netbeans, etc.  if it's things like javascript, html, xml, text editing type things, then all an IDE brings is bloat, so doing even simple tasks will take an extra 1 second when it should take 100ms.  it's just a different way to capture notes and organize your life.  if you're happy using office, that's fine too.  depends.  if you enjoy tinkering with stuff emacs is great, because it's never ending.  if you want to just install something and be productive immediately you're gonna have a bad time.   and the last question i'll answer longer because contrary to what others will say, i would recommend to avoid it.  sublime and atom set a very high bar for new users.  you install it, and you can be immediately productive with it.  if you need to do something special, there's a plugin you can install.  you can tackle the majority use cases for an editor very easily.  when you start hitting the limits of your editor, when you feel like it's actually slowing you down, that is when you should start looking at emacs.  until then, you're unlikely to appreciate the benefits."

Do you believe a company will act in your interests without giving you those freedoms? A proprietary ide company might do most things in your interest, but others which are deeply and strategically against your interests, and they DEFINITELY choose to not do things which are in your interest, when they have the opportunity to do something else which is slightly less in your interest but also makes them more money.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend_and_extinguish.

Eclipse, you may like it. Compared to emacs, I find it overly complicated, poorly designed, it bugs me that the core development is mainly done by a conglomerate of IBM and a few companies and is overtly against free software (http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.en.html), for example, they wrote their own gpl incompatible license, (the license used by ~95% of debian packages), they actually have a eula which restricts their software beyond their open source license (which is so rare, wikipedia claims eulas are only for proprietary software), and it's popularity in the past few years seems to be waning in comparison to vim/emacs/jetbrains."

More precisely, I usually do full stack stuff or, at least need to be able. So, I write almost at the same time go, javascript and HTML. Hence, I use only one editor, with the same set of keybindings and peculiarities. What IDE would I use for these 3 at the same time? And keep in mind I say IDE as you do. SublimeText is not an IDE, is also an editor.   What are the chances you end up using emacs at work? What if I move into management?   What's the matter? I've used emacs for 10 years. 6 of them were working for a university (nothing beats emacs for LaTeX, once you install AuCTeX). The other 4 I've been working as a freelancer, working for a main company. I used gnus, then mu4e as mail client. I wrote all my documents in Markdown.

How long will it take until I become as good as any IDE power user?    I'd say approximately the same time it took them. The thing is, once they are a power user of their IDE; they are constrained by it. A good Java IDE is a good Java IDE. Once you are proficient with emacs you are proficient with an endless amount of IDEs and use cases.   Do things like orgmode matter when there is office tools and gui for latex?

They do add up, but you do need spend time researching and actively customizing. ""Good defaults & customizability"" > ""good customizability"". As a long-time emacs user, emacs is unfortunately most definitely not in the former category.   Nowadays both computers and IDEs are powerful then why not use it?   No reason not to use IDEs if you're using a language/editing a format that is supported by said IDEs. Sometimes you won't, and when you don't, it's nice to have a good text-editor by your side. I think purely the agility of editing text is poorer in IDEs than in editors such as emacs and vim, but powerful language-specific features like ""refactor this"", ""find subclasses of this class"", ""find implementations of this virtual method"", ""find users of this type"" et cetera that just work make more than up for it. Text agility is not really that important after all, although it feels good.   What are the chances you end up using emacs at work? What if I move into management?   You typically can use whatever you want at work, some places force you to use specific IDEs, but even then you might still use emacs to edit other stuff like text documents, data fixtures etc. I don't think this would be greatly affected by moving to management? If you stop coding and doing systems-administration-stuff, you probably won't need either an IDE or a text-editor as much as a word processor such as word, depending on what your company expects you to use.   How long will it take until I become as good as any IDE power user?   That question can't really be easily answered, the two are more complementary and it depends on the use-case. Will you ever be as good at editing .ui files in emacs (editing the XML) as someone who uses QtCreator to lay the .ui files out graphically, who can never make a syntax error or forget an include? Probably not. Purely for programming? It doesn't really make much of a difference. For exploring large codebases, IDEs are routinely better than text-editors such as emacs. While you can cobble together an IDE inside emacs that allows you to navigate projects, browse C++ codebases by symbols, uses, inheritance etc, automatic background compile-error-checking, these are typically less polished or broken compared to the ones a good IDE gives you, require a huge effort to assemble, or falter when presented with a 10MLoC codebase (even though some emacs purists might try to convince you otherwise.)   Will it improve the quality of my life in a significant way?   Depends on what you do, but yes, it might.   Who should care about it and who should ignore it?   If you do a lot of programming in many different languages, systems-administration stuff (editing text-files via SSH) or editing text-documents like data fixtures, config files et cetera (in short, areas where IDEs typically fall short because you're not using their ""native language"") then having a quick, agile text-editor that can be used remotely through SSH is a boon."

I've been using Emacs for, hell, almost 30 years now. I have never customized it very much. I've also used IDE's when they're more appropriate. Even when in that environment, I still find emacs useful because there are things that stock emacs does that no other editor does that are useful to me. I've also tried other editors, they're prettier, but after awhile, I inevitably end up back in emacs because the other editor isn't cutting it for me.

emacs,3aiji5,davemee,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:44:25 2015 UTC,"Here's an overview answer: investing time in learning emacs is not wasted for a number of reasons. It's not going to go away. There are too many people who use it and improve it every day. The current version number alone (24.x) should tell you how long it's been around.   It's like this solid constant in the ever-changing world of tech. Part of the reason - perhaps the only reason - that technology is frustrating is because it changes so often. We humans are motivated by getting good at our work, our crafts and our day to day work. When stuff changes its disruptive. But get good at emacs and you have this familiar environment within which to work that won't change arbitrarily next year when the vendor goes under or gets bought or changes the interface for no reason at all. All of those things have happened to me with IDEs.   I am a writer and a programmer and a sysadmin and emacs lets me work within the same environment with emacs' view of the world and consistent concepts of navigation and editing. Time spent practicing with it, configuring it and learning more about it ten years ago is still helping me now as it will in 2025.   Let me finish by answering one of your questions specifically:   How long will it take until I become as good as any IDE power user?   The very best emacs users are at least 10x more productive than an IDE power user can ever be. Have a look at /u/tuhdo's gifs of him navigating 40Mb C source code files or zooming around the Linux kernel source tree and then ask yourself whether this is even possible in an IDE. I'm not saying they don't have their place; they do. But I find them limiting."

I also use full emacs over sshfs, but in some cases it's more of a hassle, for instance a lot of my files are on a server that I only can connect to via a VPN which is sometimes not very stable. * I write in different languages over a couple different projects. Some of them have dependencies or build systems that make it hard to manage in an IDE * the customizability is a plus, though I have to say I only use a tiny bit of it * it's fast compared to most IDEs * my opinion is, that you learn more about programming if you have to do more ""by hand"".

I love to customize my emacs and I don't like IDEs because doing so teaches me things than IDEs hide from me. So while I customize my emacs I become a better hacker amd programmer too. I learn about unix tools, a new language, and intricacies of programming languages. And then you'll start writing your own tools.  Basic example: the ""compile"" button. On an IDE it's a button you click and the action is preconfigured. To change it you have to click and click to change a setting. With emacs the default action of ""M-x compile"" is ""make"", which isn't always a good option. So for a language you change it with the name of the executable (say ""python + file name) and write it in you config file. You know what's happening and you know where it is. Seriously, as a student I didn't undestand Eclipse. Some students keep clicking on Compile and are unable to run a java program in the terminal.  Other examples: you want to improve the selection of files and you'll use git-ls or something else, to grep effectively you'll try the platinum searcher, you'll learn about semantics of a language to write completion or refactoring tools, you´ll learn how to do whatever you want with emacs til reading emails, managing files and so on."

An IDE is great for software development, but emacs can do so much more.

emacs,3aiji5,jtgd,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:35:03 2015 UTC,"I'm an emacs newbie (converted from vim a year ago). Here are my answers:   Does customizing the tool matter in the long run?   Having used it for ~1 year, I can't say much about the long run but I would say that it does. Both vim and emacs have the advantage that they can be repurposed to be editors for just about any programming language/environment/platform. They can't beat a good IDE (e.g. IntelliJ) though.   What are the chances you end up using Emacs at work?   Slim. I personally prefer to use the best tool for the job, which at the moment happens to be emacs (personal coding, not work).   Emacs or IDE?   Try to get Emacs up and running for whatever language/environment I need. If it's lackluster or too painful to set up, I'll pick the IDE.   How long will it take for new users to become really good at it?   This is one place I think emacs has a slight advantage over vim. Both are esoteric, but I found emacs a lot easier to get up to speed with. It also helps that emacs has a built-in package manager and a decent extension language (I know I know elisp is the devil-spawn but let's not forget vimscript). I'm a year in and still don't consider myself ""very good"" at it, just good enough. I'd predict that it would take at least four years to get to that level.   Org-mode/Latex or Office?   Office at the moment. I do plan to try out the former sometime soon.   Who can use it? How can it be used?   Anyone. Although I feel that non-programmers are slightly disadvantaged since getting it customized to fit your needs does require peeking under-the-hood and learning some basic elisp.  As for how it can be used, I see no limitations. If you can run emacs as your pid 1, there's nothing it can't do."

I've also generally found IDEs to be a bit frustrating in that they often demand deep directory structures for something as simple as a ""Hello World"" proof of concept.   3) I keep my work TODO list in org. Emacs is useful for heavy text-twiddling on a weekly basis.   4) I don't know, how long will it take you?  5a) Orgmode matters to me because it's a platform-agnostic file format that I can use under multiple operating systems. This is a bit harder to find, in practice, than you think. Use of cloud-based solutions has been strongly discouraged by my employer for security reasons.   5b) I don't think a GUI really matters that much in LaTeX. Granted it's been several years since I needed to use LaTeX, but the emacs modes were generally the best helpers. LaTeX is still LaTeX and gets pretty fragile if you don't do things the LaTeX way. Most of my text-based applications these days involve markdown -> html, or the creation of structured text documents that I can feed into a blackboard tool.   6) I keep finding myself pulled into back emacs because of shortcomings in looking for a plugin or macro to handle this or that standard, this or that emerging application, or this or that particular need.

Don't worry, this subreddit perhaps makes Emacs seem like a programmer's tool, but it is a universal text editor for all humans.  First, here's a commonly referenced guide The Woodnotes Guide to Emacs for Writers (pdf).  Emacs has a lot of user-friendly features, the trick is how to access them. Your first port of call should be the tutorial accessed with C-h t (which means press control-H then press T). Press C-h ? to get a list of the various ways Emacs can help you.  The first hurdle is Packages. If you're unfamiliar, these are a bit like browser extensions. Almost everything is available on MELPA-stable. Unfortunately, the instructions you'll find aren't super user-friendly. So...   Open Emacs M-x customize-variable RET package-archives RET Click the INS button to add: Archive name: melpa-stable URL or directory name: http://stable.melpa.org/packages/ Click Apply and Save M-x list-packages RET   Now you can install stable packages from MELPA.  In answer to your points:   Emacs can change the faces of a buffer text region with its Enriched Text minor mode. Quoted from the manual:     Enriched mode is typically used with Text mode (see Text Mode). It is not compatible with Font Lock mode, which is used by many major modes, including most programming language modes, for syntax highlighting (see Font Lock). Unlike Enriched mode, Font Lock mode assigns text properties automatically, based on the current buffer contents; those properties are not saved to disk.  Yes of course. The answer to ""Can Emacs do...?"" is usually always yes. You will want Markdown Mode, which will make the various emphasised text pretty. Be sure to install via list-packages. Emacs has a builtin indexing feature called Imenu, which should work with most major modes. To get a sidebar listing all the Imenu nodes, try imenu-list. To show a sidebar with a project folder tree, there is the builtin speedbar but this only works as a separate frame (separate application window) and a lot of people like to work in a single frame (application window) split into multiple Emacs windows. There is sr-speedbar, which makes Speedbar operate in a single frame, but I have found this quite buggy. I recommend neotree instead.

If you think that at a given point in time it is OK to use Spacemacs and if you cannot define the period where it is not OK then it should be also possible to use Spacemacs right from the start. Since I don't think you are able to define this transition period accurately enough for all beginner, Spacemacs can be OK to start with.  But it goes even further that this, I think the exact opposite of what you wrote, I encourage people to discover Emacs via Spacemacs to have a glimpse of how powerful it can be when you can put together the best packages around with a consistent interface, it shows the way, it shows one possible goal, result which works well. The configuration of Spacemacs is made to be highly modular and to be able to easily remove what you don't want. Ultimately you can start to build your own configuration with the light of a well organized configuration and use Spacemacs as a reference.

If you want to do TODOs, org-mode is the place for it. Scheduling, agenda views, searching, filtering, even time tracking is all right at your keyboard.   I keep one giant TODO file and one giant notes file.   For the notes file, I add timestamps and tags to each note. I can search by time period, or by tag, or by combination of tags. It's backed up with Git and   For my TODO file, I track TODOs by context (office, home, computer, errand, phone, anywhere). Under each context I put my individual TODOs, and I tag them according to project. When I work on the TODOs, I track my time. I view the day's scheduled items in the agenda view, filtering according to context. I can generate time reports on the fly at any granularity I choose. No matter where I am in Emacs I can capture TODO items without switching contexts using org-default-notes-file, which has different templates depending on what sort of TODO I want to capture.  Be warned! This is such an efficient and wonderful work environment you will not want to leave. I'm currently in the process of seeing how to move my email into Emacs, and after that my calendar.  I'm only scratching the surface! Some people have wonderful org-mode setups. This is what got me into it: http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/  Good luck and have fun!"

I shut it off...I do use folding, but I prefer everything ""exploded"" to start, and to manually contract things, rather than the reverse.)  I don't use it for much more than text notes myself, but org-tables are amazing!  I have a LOT of notes that just make more sense in table form, and org-mode is fantastic for managing that format.  And that org-tables have support for rudimentary spreadsheet-operations is icing on top of that!  Also, that org-mode is smart about URIs and has it's own internal (local) file linking syntax (i.e. you can add links in .org files to other files, .org, or otherwise) is additionally very helpful.  Anyway, the best advice is just to try it.  The worst case scenario is simply that you'll just re-name your .org files to .txt files.  There's really no risk."

Another thing I will point out is that in case you are using Markdown as input to other software and are worried about compatibility, it's easy to export from org to Markdown (and org's exporters are generally just as configurable as the rest of it, too).  At any rate, I would say that even with just the out of the box defaults, org-mode does more than Markdown and todo.txt... and that's before you start to take advantage of its customizability."

The group at the top is simple todo items, one per line. If I need more detail sometimes I simply write it below, and sometimes I break it out into another file with an org-mode link. This section is deliberately freeform.  Below that is my tickler/calendar. Each line starts with a date, coded yy.mm.ddw for compactness and so I can sort them with sort -n. They're color coded by day of the week. I use this bump date utility I wrote to operate on the dates -- ""repeat weekly"", ""add 4 days to given date"", ""give me the next Thursday"", those sorts of things. It feels very natural.

The Kinesis layout required that I jettison the Home and End keys from their position in the thumb section for an extra ""Command"" (yes, I need ""Command"" key for non-Emacs applications). So yeah, I use C-a and C-e as those are easy enough.  This modifier symmetry becomes an interesting conundrum for me if I get the Keyboardio, as it has four thumb keys for the four modifiers (including the Shift).

emacs,3a21y2,pzone,6,Wed Jun 17 01:35:25 2015 UTC,"1) Absolutely. It's the best introductory book out there.  2) It's oriented toward Emacs beginners.  Actually one of the target groups mentioned in the introduction is Vim users.  Most of the book focuses on what you need to know to do standard text editing: movement and editing, searching, macros and automation.  Other important sections include how to configure emacs, how to use the inbuilt help system take advantage of the self-documentation features to discover everything quickly.  The table of contents is probably useful.  https://www.masteringemacs.org/book/look-inside/table-of-contents-1    Although the book 280 pages the type is not extremely dense and it would be a fine cover-to-cover read. Although most of the book is about basic editing it does give a brief overview of a few useful packages such as Dired, Tramp, Shell/Eshell, and even Helm.  The author points to the official Emacs Lisp guide for an introduction to elisp, but explains all the lisp syntax necessary to copy configuration snippets from online and modify them to your needs.  The book does not discuss Evil mode and mentions only briefly the capabilities for coding and IDE, but that landscape is changing so quickly you should be searching online anyway.   I don't think the Spacemacs maintainers emphasize enough that their software is still very much in a beta state. I would absolutely recommend a clean break from Vim starting with the basics, later you can pick up Spacemacs and merge the customizations you've already made."

emacs,3a21y2,xoo-,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:19:24 2015 UTC,"It's only a subtle distinction.  Running (start-server) while you have emacs open starts the server process after it's already running with an editor window open.  Running emacs --daemon from the command line only starts the server but doesn't open any window.  The latter is designed to be automatic, like a line in your crontab, since it starts silently without a window. Either way, if you want to connect to a running server instead of opening a new one, you need to use the emacsclient executable instead of emacs.  http://wikemacs.org/wiki/Emacs_server"

You would also need to determine what the behavior should be when you aren't at the end of the buffer.

But having your own config is above and beyond anything Vanilla or Spacemacs can offer.  It does require some investment, but it's great in the end. The difference is that Vanilla is an empty cup for you to fill, while Spacemacs is already full (of some cool packages, but still full).  My suggestion for you (if you're really a die-hard Vim fan) is to use Spacemacs until you decide that you won't be switching editors for the next 20 years. Then switch to Vanilla + Evil and add your own stuff at your own pace."

There are two types of users: ""tinkerers"" and ""getting-thing-done-ers"".  For GTD-ers, it doesn't matter: they can stick to Spacemacs for years with zero personal customization.  The tinkerer will eventually drop Spacemacs, so maybe there's a bit of a waste of effort; but it could be that otherwise he wouldn't bother with Vanilla Emacs + Evil, and just continue to tinker Vim.  So if you know the person, you likely know the type of user he is:   If he's a GTD-er who used Vim - point him to Spacemacs. If he's a tinkerer who used Vim - point him to Vanilla + Evil.

Spacemacs does not override any key binding, it only adds new key bindings (except for M-m in Emacs editing mode, since that key binding is used for accessing Spacemacs command group such as Helm, file, buffer...).

If it works for majority of people, it's unlikely that things break and you should not have any problem. If there are problems, since this is a community, the bugs can be reported quickly to identify the problems and fix it. If you use other random configuration without a community, the configuration may work for that person but it's likely that it won't work for you. Since Spacemacs is community configured, it's already done many things for you. For example, one day you want to learn Python and want to have a quick development environment without even copy/paste configuration Elisp code? Easily, just add Python layer that already configured popular Python packages to create a Python development environment for you. The only thing you need to do next is to read the layer documentation. No Elisp required. When you have problems, you can go to gitter chatroom and ask for help. Many Vim users who switch to Emacs are there. If you go to #emacs, chances are you are told to use stock Emacs without your beloved Vim key bindings since it's ""the better way"". Using vanilla Emacs meaning you can use awesome packages like Helm and Projectile and more that boost your productivity ten folds.

There are a couple of other minor drawbacks I can see - since this uses custom keyswitches and custom molded keys there's really no way of customizing the look of the keyboard itself. On the ergodox you can choose from all the different cherry switches and a huge selection of custom keycaps  - I just ordered different sets to make mine look cooler. It also appears a bit less appealing to me since it includes labeled keys and kind of a ""default layout"".  But these are minor complaints. Overall this is a great project, since it's another project that shows that there's a market for custom built, premium keyboards, just like the Ergodox EZ project: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ergodox-ez-an-incredible-mechanical-keyboard#/story"

I'm less excited about the six fewer keys per hand.  They are offering blank keycaps, and will sell additional sets (see the FAQ at the bottom of the kickstarter). It's not as nice as having standard keycap sizes, but you do have options.  I do wonder if they have any sort of layers. Because I use Colemak, but often bring my ergodox to places where other people are (work, meetups, etc.), I really benefit by having a QWERTY layer I can switch on to let people try it.

It's a great tutorial for a computer system from say 1983-2000 (perhaps being generous with that last year), an OK tutorial from 2001-2007 (2007 being around when IE 7 went tabbed...more on this in a moment), and kind of a bad tutorial since.  These periods mostly correspond to the type of personal experience with computers (and the role of the internet in the average users life).  First, it was mostly professional programmers.  Then a larger non-professional, but fairly tech-savvy group.  And finally, everyone and their dog.     And the same tutorial is not appropriate for all 3 groups.  A detailed concrete example can be considered here.  Prior to the advent of tabbed browsing (around 2007) and the subsequent explosion of tabs in consumer software everywhere, non-professionals really didn't have any conceptual analog for an emacs buffer.  It was an entirely new concept, that needed some detailed explanation and treatment.  In the post-tab-era, the tutorial has the opposite problem: people already understand what a buffer is in the abstract, but are upset it doesn't present a clickable tab, like they are accustomed to.  (1970s-keyboard-driven interfaces vs 1990s-mouse-driven interfaces are another, and much larger, issue...but not as focused an example as just tabs are.)  Roughly, the 3 eras of emacs newbie fall into these caricatures:    A new and foreign system. I have a lot to learn!  Best to carefully read the manual, and then do the tutorial, before I can get to work. Hrm, this is some odd software, it doesn't look or work like the software I'm used to.  But once I figure out load, save, and undo, I should be able to get to work. I know how to computer!  WTF is this?  Where are the icons and menus?  Why can't I use this immediately, like all the other software I know?  Why is everything is harder than it should be?   There are a number of factors at play here.  But the major ones are:    emacs users are no longer almost exclusively professional software engineers, working on corporate/university unix hosts, i.e. highly technical people who read manuals before they attempt to use things. the general populace has a lot more experience with computer software today, than it did before say, 2000...but most of that experience is with an entirely different UI philosophy. along with the shift to a broader user-base/audience, people's expectations of how much their ignorance should be catered to has changed (they expect to be productive in 20 minutes, rather than 20 hours)   And now I'm sounding like a grumpy old programmer...please try not to focus on that, and instead concentrate on the ideas I'm trying to articulate.  Namely...   The new-user-base has changed, and so have their expectations.  And I don't think the tutorial has caught up with those changes.    It may be trying to...but it is lagging the new-user-base by at least one generation/era of computing.    And unfortunately, that's really hard to fix, because the folks who are best qualified to fix the tutorial lack the perspective of a modern new user.  But we really need to stop being in denial about this!    Everyone who thinks the tutorial is OK seems to be an old hand at emacs...i.e. someone who doesn't need it, and if they're bothered to revisit it, breezes through it, because the material is already super-familiar.    But I've yet to see a single new user sing its praises.  And if the tutorial isn't serving the needs of new users well, how good can it be?  I'm not even sure it's ""adequate"", let alone ""very good"" for the vast majority of new users."

I'm not kidding when I say it took me the better part of a year to really get through it and start using emacs in place of other things.  It would be nice to mention graphical emacs in the tutorial and to mention the possibility of using the arrow keys. Of course, I don't use the arrow keys anymore and I feel right at home in a text-only emacs, but the learning curve was needlessly steep for me.  The greatest learning happened when I looked through the menu system and saw each item's bindings. I would have certainly learned C-n/p/b/f eventually (the arrow keys are too clumsy) and I don't think it would have had a major impact on how I see emacs.  Without a mentor, the emacs tutorial just isn't that great. I mean, it took me months to discover MELPA.

There are two common ways that the user could have got their hands on Emacs. One is that they got it from a linux or BSD distro. In that case it will be the graphical version unless they select the terminal version. The other is that they're running Windows and they downloaded it. In that case they'll get the graphical version. The only way I can think of that a new user would get the terminal version is if they started by using someone else's computer and they'd installed the terminal version.   and to mention the possibility of using the arrow keys   It says on the second page of the tutorial ""You can use the arrow keys"".  I don't see why the learning curve is ""needlessly steep"".  It's fairly obvious from the start of the tutorial that Emacs acts like most GUI applications. It's not necessary to read beyond the first few pages to learn how to do basic editing. It's much easier to deal with that Vim, for example, which requires learning about modes and quite a lot of other stuff.

It's not necessary to read beyond the first few pages to learn how to do basic editing.   I read through the tutorial many times.

It's much easier to deal with that Vim, for example, which requires learning about modes and quite a lot of other stuff.

If I may ask, around what year? My thought is that (my memory of) the emacs tutorial isn't geared toward people who are used to the status quo of menu-driven interfaces. As far as professional interface design goes, menus suck unless you never touch a keyboard. Nevertheless, nowadays people aren't picking up emacs as professionals, they're picking it as hopefuls.  I'm sorry if I'm not being very coherent – it's a little past my bedtime ;) – but my experience was heavily impacted by the fact that I used terminal emacs on/off for well over a year before I figured out there was a graphical emacs.

Other fine editors have lots of interesting features, but in their design, it's like a mansion where the kitchen is one wing, the pantry another, the bathroom yet another... it all meets back in the lobby so it's connected but it's not a house, it's just a collection of rooms. In Emacs, everything is connected to everything else. It feels wrong and messy until the day that recursive editing, say, saves you a morning's worth of work. Or when you realize that you can use macros and registers and regexp search in the file manager Dired.   I feel like I am going to need text editing for the rest of my life. Programming languages come and go, but underneath it is all just text. Emacs works excellently with text, can change with me and will gladly be along for the ride."
emacs,39ormg,RobThorpe,5,Sat Jun 13 22:45:42 2015 UTC,"Emacs covers many use cases, that's very important.  In the late 90s when I was at University I learned to use the Borland C++ Builder IDE. In about 2000 I had to write some code in VHDL.  The Borland IDE was no use for that.  I'd heard RMS speak at my University, so I decided to try out the editor he established.  I found that I could use it for VHDL and many other things.  This flexibility is very important. If you've used many languages over many years you'll appreciate it. If you start using Java (for example) then an IDE will be much more immediately productive than Emacs is.  But, in a few years time you are likely to be writing in a different language, that often means switching IDE. Even today most IDEs aren't language agnostic, they specialize in particular languages. More obscure languages aren't well provided for (and often things like shell script are obscure in this sense).  Switching IDE means learning a whole new set of features and the keybindings for them.  There are the CUA keybindings, but they only affect a small number of keys.  A person's efficiency with a particular set of keybindings is strongly proportional to the length of time they've been using them for. Many IDEs have keybindings for particular languages that are much better thought out for those languages than Emacs' bindings are. But, the problem is that the user generally has much less time to get accustomed to them before switching IDE again.  Emacs removes these pain-inducing switches. (Have you ever had to use two IDEs at once? A colleague of mine was trying to do this yesterday, it can be extremely tricky).  Then there's text. I write a lot of text. A lot of ""Todo"" lists, a lot of email and quite a few reports. Everyone will find that the more senior they become the more of this there is to do. IDEs don't cover that case. They require using a different tool with another set of different keybindings. If you use Emacs then you use the same keybindings, so everything is practice for everything else. The time you spend navigating emails helps you later when navigating code, and vice versa.  The customizability is a big plus too.  But, what I find most useful about Elisp, isn't the ability to redefine a few keys, is the ability to write new modes to deal with entirely new situations."

This is a profound, qualitative difference from nearly all other software available. For example, Emacs can work like vi if you like. You sure as shit can't go the other way. To resort to a slightly silly analogy, other editors are like Fred Flintstone's car: stone wheels and you have to push it yourself; Emacs is like a starfighter."

emacs,39ormg,forked_tongue,8,Sun Jun 14 10:20:44 2015 UTC,"I've pretty much given up on emacs evangelism.    I started using emacs because it was what the best programmers I personally knew were using.  Some were using vi...but vi didn't inspire the same feature envy that emacs did.  After I learned some elisp, I came to fully appreciate just how powerful a portable lisp virtual machine for text editing can be.  Being able to run my elisp extensions on any OS meant I could platform-hop with ease, between Unix, Windows and Mac environments, carrying my own extensions and customizations wherever I went.  But quite frankly neither of the above are good selling points:    ""It's what the cool kids are using!""  Yeah, if your definition of ""cool"" applies to talented programmers.   Mine does.  As might yours.  But that's not really a popular view. ""It's a virtual lisp machine!"" Again, although a huge selling point, it's got a very limited target market demographic.   So, I've sort of given up on ""selling"" emacs to others.  It's a very niche editor/IDE.  If you're a programmer who is willing to learn elisp, there is nothing better.  But that's a mighty big ""if"".  And that's not knocking org-mode, or say, erc, or any number of other quality emacs libraries that qualify as applications in their own right...but for nearly all of these, there are alternative options that work just as well or better for that single need.   So, I don't think any of these are a ""gateway (drug?)"" to emacs.  I think most of the people who have (or will develop) the desire for a fully programmable text editor will find their way to emacs eventually.  And the best thing you can do to promote emacs is to just be a ""cool kid"" yourself...be a talented programmer who is secure (perhaps to the point of being smug) about the tools you use.   Don't ""sell"" emacs.  Inspire envy!  When you push emacs, you come off as desperate, needing to validate your own choices, by having others copy them.   This is the exact opposite of what a cool kid does.    They can be enthusiastic supporters of the things that they're into...but they really don't care if others follow their example or not.  It's cool, either way.  If someone is interested in emacs, it's their own interest and drive that will (or won't) push them through the learning stages.  You can be enthusiastic and helpful, but their reasons for choosing emacs (or something else) are their own, and not really something you can supply.   Well...other than just being an example of an awesome emacs user, that is.     But the key tl;dr point is:  features don't sell, aspirations do."

The main reason that I converted was (1) on a philosophical level and (2) thinking wtf I might as well try it.  (1) I'd been using VIm for a bit but way off being a ninja. Very comfortable with modal editing I'd decided to start customising things more, using mroe plugins and learning some VimScript. I was kind of down with the Unix philosophy of do one thing well and still think in many cases that makes sense. But I'm a mile off being adroit with the command line, navigation and basic stuff is alright but I can't edit files with sed use awk or much else. Linux as an IDE is more than possible if you know what you're doing but I'm not really in that club :) The idea of using more things from the editor didn't bother me (even makes sense) so and the idea of moving between OSs easily is very appealing for any future cases."

Because of my consistent hook naming scheme, I can have a function ora-goto-hook-file, which jumps to the hook function from any major-mode. So for any major mode, if I want to edit its hook function, I just call ora-goto-hook-file, no further questions asked.  Then I comment out (org-bullets-mode) and C-M-x (eval-defun).  This will take effect on all new org-mode buffers. For old-ones, revert-buffer."

I can't remember which library got confused because I defined the meta-prefix-char as nil after the library got loaded, but I sure do remember spending a lot of time figuring out that it was because the meta-prefix-char needed to be set to nil early on in the loading process.  I remember reading somewhere that using the escape key as meta is needed for things like the terminal, however, I use the graphical version of Emacs.  I like having the global esc-map for special things that are separate from the meta map.  Once they are separated, they look like this:  (define-key global-map [?\M-c] 'cfw:open-org-calendar) and (define-key esc-map ""k"" 'browse-kill-ring)."

emacs,39hd7v,intense_porpoise,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:02:47 2015 UTC,"+Evil  Using spacemacs.... Read that blog, I can't believe that he's asked advanced vim users and they haven't found anything concrete missing from evil... As a beginner I'll through iabbrev out there, that's not in there, neither is nnoremap... Perhaps these aren't classed as editing command's or something idk, it has :w though as well as r ! Whatever.   Using macros with it can't pick up the mapped ESC key, either ESC or C-[ has to be used.  Also had issues mapping ESC sequence to movement keys.  I'm very impressed with evil and I love spacemacs. But evil certainly isn't near perfect emulation even if it is the best of the emulations. Perhaps my idea of perfect is different to others though.... And maybe all the above is easy I just don't know how to do it ;)"

emacs,39k0rz,IceDane,2,Fri Jun 12 07:38:38 2015 UTC,"This may not be very idiomatic elisp since I'm still rather new at it, so I'd welcome any suggestions.  But if understand you correctly you want to translate hex-encoded raw image into a base64 encoded raw image. This should do that. It works on the current buffer. Running it, saving the buffer, then decoding it with the terminal base64 resulted in a valid image(of a hand).  (defun dostuff ()   (interactive)   (let (str result)     (setq str (buffer-string))     (setq result """")     (while (> (length str) 0)       (setq result (concat result (string (string-to-number (substring str 0 2) 16))))       (setq str (substring str 2))       )     (erase-buffer)     (insert (base64-encode-string result)))   )"

emacs,39ikk0,green-in-gold,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:32:10 2015 UTC,Not sure that it fits your criteria of entering the keyboard shortcut but I use org-drill as a space based repetition system.   http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-drill.html  Something that actually lets you enter the keyboard command would make for a nice little extension.

emacs,39e0ve,revocation,31,Thu Jun 11 02:59:39 2015 UTC,I don't use VIM bindings. I guess there are more people using emacs with emacs bindings than with VIM bindings.
emacs,39e0ve,kcin,23,Thu Jun 11 04:38:39 2015 UTC,"I don't like modal editing, so I just use the default bindings."

It was like I had stripped a layer of cognitive goop off my editor and had less stuff between my thoughts and what happened to my text.  I've noticed the same of other software systems that try to emulate another either through heavy customization or a wrapper layer. They never seem to be as nice as the thing they emulate."
emacs,39e0ve,ForkInBrain,7,Thu Jun 11 11:09:32 2015 UTC,"I switched to evil mode from vim sbout a year and a half ago. I use Emacs keybindings in insert mode (having wiped the insert mode keymap) and vim (editing) bindings in normal mode (through evil). They each are useful in different situations. Recently I have found myself using Emacs bindings more because they are available in many more applications than vi bindings. If I had to choose one, I'd choose Emacs, no question, but would mourn the loss.  In particular, the emacs kill/yank system is a lot richer."
emacs,39e0ve,catern,6,Thu Jun 11 03:39:37 2015 UTC,It seems like asking this question in /r/emacs is going to yield an obvious answer.
emacs,39e0ve,IceDane,12,Thu Jun 11 11:42:14 2015 UTC,"I definitely prefer vim editing over emacs. I just recently switched from vim to emacs + evil. I regret that I didn't do this sooner, because having an editor that is basically a lisp machine is so cool. Vim editing is, to me, simply superior to editing using sequences such as the ones you displayed above."
emacs,39e0ve,IceDane,1 point,Thu Jun 11 09:37:13 2015 UTC,Not entirely sure what you mean. You want me to elaborate on why I prefer vim bindings?
emacs,39e0ve,IceDane,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:20:05 2015 UTC,"I am not claiming that vim editing is superior -- I am merely saying that I find it to be. I believe this to be mostly dependent on what you start with and how your brain gets wired as you use one or the other the most.  A good few years ago, when I decided I should probably check out either vim or emacs, and I started out trying emacs. I was really inexperienced at the time and it was all very complicated to me, but what I remember very distinctly is that I gave up rather quick because of the way emacs editing worked. I found it really, really uncomfortable using long sequences of modified keys combined with non-modifier keys. I didn't know about switching caps lock <=> control back then, but it's still uncomfortable.  I tried vim afterwards. It took me a while to get used to modal editing, but as soon as I did I could not shake it. When using vim, you should be in insert mode as little as possible. Much like emacs users do various things to make the use of modifier keys more comfortable, vim users do stuff like bind jj or similar to exit insert mode. This means that OP's example regarding switching modes to type fn1(fn2(arg)) inside-out is very easy for me. If I start typing arg, I can hit jj really fast, hit ysiw) to surround it, which takes puts the cursor here: |(arg). Then I can either type ysab) to surround it again, then a and type fn2, or I can type fn2 and then hit ys%) and the final fn1. All of these are basically on my homerow.   Another thing is that some keybindings in emacs use M-something bindings, and in my workflow I use a tiling window manager(xmonad). Most of my bindings in xmonad use alt as a modifier key.  As I said before, I think it's mostly what you start with and use the most that decides what you like. Emacs as an editor is far superior to vim in all aspects because it is infinitely customizable and because lisp, of course. I regret not having switched sooner. I cannot live without vim editing, though, and I feel incredibly handicapped every time I have to use an editor that does not have them.  But as many people have said before: when you really start using your editor, and customizing it to fit your needs, it probably stops being vim or emacs and kind of becomes an extension of yourself. This is the case for me. Apart from the basic editing stuff, my most used vim bindings were bindings that I made myself that only really made sense to me. The same applies to my emacs config."

First, those emacs commands aren't a grammar. They are single commands, one for everything you do. I find vim much more natural. If I want to delete everything in a paragraph I know I have to press dip because di is the start of every delete in command. I also automatically can delete around the paragraph (until the start of the next one), dap or visually select it, vap. I personally don't like to visually select everything before doing a command, operators are just so much neater. And take a look at textobjects!  Anyway. What is the problem with that function wrapping? There are a bunch of ways to solve this with vim. You could go to the END of the word if there are no spaces in the function with E.  You could start typing at the end of the line with A. You can go to the other pair of the bracket with % Hell, you could use surround - either ysiWf fn1 <enter> or siWf fn1 <enter> - depending on whether you replaced substitute with it. It stands for  surround inner WORD with function fn1  Oh, and try to put escape onto capslock while trying vim out. It is how its originally keyboard was layed out and is much nicer on the pinky."

I'd agree about the Emacs bindings having their own logic, and I'd argue that Emacs bindings are even better than Vim.  Keybindings in Emacs just make so much sense.  For example, the prefix keys are very clearly separated based on their role:   C-x: Run a low-level Emacs command.  M-x: Run some LISP command/function.   Then, to move your cursor around:   C-f: Forward in the line C-b: Backward in the line C-n: Next line C-p: Previous line   As one of the people who first convinced me to use Emacs said to me,   Bigger jumping is more ""Meta""   So bigger jumps can be accomplished via:   M-f: Jump forward a ""word"" M-b: Jump backward a ""word"" M-a: Jump backward a ""sentence"" M-e: Jump forward a ""sentence""   I just like Emacs keybindings more, and I find Vim's keybindings and modal nature to be erratic and hardly useful."
emacs,39e0ve,gnzlbg,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:10:08 2015 UTC,"Keybindings in Emacs just make so much sense.   That's really a matter of perspective, though.  To me, vi keybindings just make so much sense.  The C-x somekey vs. M-x somecommand distinction, for instance, is preserved by commands run in normal mode, vs in command mode: complex commands/functions are run with :somecommand whereas simple low-level command are merely somekey.  Granted, hjkl don't have the same mnemonic potential as C-n/p/f/b, but that's four commands, which are standard across other unix programs anyway (e.g. less, nethack), and anyway aren't used that much.  As for the Meta-somekey vs. Ctrl-somekey distinction, sure, that's consistent, but ""a"" and ""e"" for forward and backward sentence is hardly particularly mnemonic...  By contrast, vim is not only usually mnemonic, it also has an easily understandable grammar. Thus, if I know that d is the delete command, I know that dw deletes a word, dd deletes a line, d) deletes a sentence, and d} deletes a paragraph.  With emacs, if I know that M-d deletes a word, I have no way of deriving from that the command to delete a line, C-k.  And with vim, learning the single command y (yank, which in vi-speak is copy) allows me to transfer all of this knowledge (yy, yw, y), y} etc.) to copying as well.  Whenever I learn a new text-object (ip for 'inside paragraph', for instance) I can apply this to all of the editing commands I use which take text-object arguments (y, c, d, and v, and possibly a few others I am forgetting...)  Sure, vi has its idiosyncracies (I have no idea why Y is a synonym for yy but D and C are synonyms for d$ and c$ respectively, for instance), but on the whole it makes a lot of sense when you get to know it.  I'm sure emacs makes sense as well, but to me at least it seems to make less sense.  I used vim (and occasionally vi/nvi) for at least 2 years solidly before I first used emacs, however, and since I started to use emacs, I've done most of that within evil.

Interactive sequences are great, because that's how people operate: ""do A, get feedback on the effect, do B, more feedback, do C"".  Compare to: ""do A, B, C, get feedback"". If you mistype any of ABC in command mode, you have to repeat all over and cancel the bad effect.  In interactive mode, there less chance for an error and less stress, and usually when you catch an error, you don't need a full restart.

If you use } alone, it moves to the end of a paragraph. If you use d, it waits for a so-called text object (like } is an example) to complete the deleting command as a whole. Similarly, c combines with any text object to change delete a text object at point and get into insert mode. Text object can be a word, a big word, a symbol, a sentence, a paragraph...

For anyone who might find it useful:  Create a configuration layer (see in docs), name it tide, and just copy the package.el, config.el above.  Add tide AND auto-completion in the dotspacemacs-configuration-layers.  Make sure to edit the 'path/to/tsc' variable, though I personally just run tsc from the shell (:!tsc) since I have a tsconfig.json   The C-c C-c command passes the current file to tsc. is there a way to make C-c C-c run from the current open dir and take into account the config file?"
emacs,39ejtn,Secretmapper,1 point,Sun Jun 14 10:42:57 2015 UTC,"I just came from Vim a few weeks ago, so I'm still pretty new to all of this myself :)   The C-c C-c command passes the current file to tsc. is there a way to make C-c C-c run from the current open dir and take into account the config file?   I would say that is definitely possible. Again, still new to all this, but this is how I would approach it myself:  The compile-command variable specifies the shell command to run when the compile function is executed (here bound to C-c C-c). According to the documentation, one can invoke tsc to use a tsconfig.json in two ways. Note that TypeScript 1.5 or higher is required.  1.) The first method is to just run tsc from a given directory and tsc will try to find tsconfig.json by walking up the current directory path. If this works, all that would be required would be to set compile-command to the tsc executable and pass in any parameters required but leave out the file name. I believe that Emacs will run the command from the directory of the file in the current buffer. So use something like this, instead of what was added in the configuration layer that I posted:  (defun tide/init-typescript-mode ()   (interactive)   (setq compilation-read-command nil)   (let ((tsc ""path/to/tsc""))     (set (make-local-variable 'compile-command)          (progn            (format ""%s --target es5""                    tsc)))     (message compile-command)))   2.) Invoke tsc with no input files and supply a -p or --project parameter with the path to tsconfig.json. This would require a bit more code and I don't have a fully tested solution, but I think you can do something like the following:  Use (locate-dominating-file FILE NAME-OR-PREDICATE) to locate the tsconfig.json file (note that there is no error checking here, so this will probably fail if the file could not be found):  (defun tide/find-tsconfig.json ()   (let ((tsconfig-file-dir         (locate-dominating-file (buffer-file-name) ""tsconfig.json"")))     (concat tsconfig-file-dir ""tsconfig.json"")))   Use this util function to construct the final compile-command value:  (defun tide/init-typescript-mode ()   (interactive)   (setq compilation-read-command nil)   (let ((tsc ""path/to/tsc"")         (tsconfig-path (tide/find-tsconfig.json)))     (set (make-local-variable 'compile-command)          (progn            (format ""%s --target es5 --project \""%s\""""                    tsc                    tsconfig-path)))     (message compile-command)))   Hope this helps!"

emacs,395u8x,RothiasVex,2,Tue Jun 9 16:39:26 2015 UTC,"It's a bit complex.  First of all, emacs lisp is an bit of an oddity among lisps in that it tends to favor procedural mutation of the buffer over functional return values. So in this case, the return values are not relevant.  interactive is a special form. In this case, what it does is prompt you for a number and binds the function parameter x to that number. The number type is specified by the ""n"" code character before the prompt.  (The other code character you might use frequently is s for string.)  The documentation for org-set-property could be clearer, but what it ultimately does is insert or modify strings in an org buffer. Strings in lisp are also sequences, so something in the process is calling sequencep (is this a sequence?) on the integer 20, and throwing an error because 20 is an integer and not a sequence.  So what you need to do is convert x to a string before passing it to org-set-property.  This works on my emacs:  (org-set-property ""APPT_WARNTIME"" (number-to-string x))   And to explain the error:  Wrong type argument: sequencep, 20   ""20 is the wrong type, I need a sequence."""

E.g. at one point you have something like (->> ....).  seq.el and map.el and of course cl-lib are good libraries.  These won't be used in org-core for a while though.

However, there were two reasons I went back to my previous configuration .    Random hangs with CPU spiking to 100% when using loads of remote buffers. I just didn't have enough time to figure out why. Evil mode.  It is superb. It has tons of features I used a lot: multi-edit of search occurrences, and many more. In addition, modal editing did feel much superior, the navigation and text manipulation was fluid and easily memorized. Having said that, evil doesn't work for all buffers that well. Sometimes (in dired, magit) you'd have to use emacs keybindings for navigation, and it breaks consistency.   I will be back to spacemacs when it's a bit more polished.

You can set the initial state (e.g. normal, emacs, etc.) for any mode. For things like dired and magit, the keybindings are already mostly just single keys, and a lot of evil commands would be useless anyway. If you still would rather have normal state as the initial state, you can add back any dired/magit commands you use pretty easily."

emacs,3948e4,aabbccaabbcc,3,Sun Jun 14 01:54:14 2015 UTC,"I made the switch (regular emacs --> emacs with evil) about a year ago! I'm quite happy with it, all in all.   I'd never really tried Vim before, but as far as I could tell, among text editors it was sort of the only other serious choice. A few coworkers had shown me their favorite features in SublimeText or NotePad++, but they were never able to show me anything that emacs didn't do a whole lot better (except for that minimap that ST has, which I'll admit looks really nice.... until I tried a version in emacs only to get rid of it half an hour later because I realized all it was doing was taking up space and slowing things down on larger files, and I never missed it at all). On the other hand, I'd looked over the shoulders of folks using Vim a couple of times in the past, and seen them do some very sophisticated things very quickly. So I thought I would just try Vim for a few weeks for day-to-day stuff, just so I could learn for myself what made it so great. So I guess it was mostly just curiosity about ""the other editor.""  I used GVim at first to make sure that I wasn't cheating by just M-x-ing everything when I couldn't remember the Vim bindings for what I wanted to do. I went though vimtutor a couple times, and pretty soon Vim started to make a lot of sense to me, so then I tried adding evil. At first it was really frustrating, since it would step on a lot of keybindings I liked, and would use evil states when they didn't really make any sense (like in comint buffers, for example). But I really didn't want to give up, so I read the evil manual a few times to learn how to make it fit in a little better with everything else. I still get really annoyed from time to time, but as I discover good ways to fix the things I'm unhappy with, these annoyances get a whole lot more rare.  At this point, I don't think I'll ever go back! I can't imagine ever leaving emacs, and pairing it with evil has been really great."

I really enjoyed it, and I imagine that you'd probably get a little more out of it than I did, since you're a vim user.

What you can do in Emacs is allow the user to choose from font lock faces, which correspond to syntax tokens and will align with the theme in use.   My strong recommendation is, if you are writing something that allows customization, to allow the user to store a font lock face name OR color. Setting actual individual colors for a specific package is usually not a sustainable approach."

emacs,38u19v,bakuretsu,3,Sat Jun 6 22:18:02 2015 UTC,"Coming to evil-mode from straight Emacs, I still have all the Emacs finger reflexes intact, so I still use plenty of C and M bindings  without even thinking about it for saving files, switching buffers, managing windows and frames and all sorts of things.  But two text editing bindings I've kept are C-a and C-e for beginning/end of line instead of Vim's ^ and $, simply because they're so clunky to type (modifier key + out-of-the-way keys).  Do you (or anyone else coming from native Vim) have any examples of that kind of key binding where you have abandoned the Vim default key mappings?"
emacs,38u19v,jplindstrom,2,Sun Jun 7 19:08:23 2015 UTC,"I personally use C-a and C-e, but mostly because it's also the default in readline."

Saves me time because I don't have to be in normal mode to execute functions."
emacs,38u19v,40Cows,2,Mon Jun 8 02:03:52 2015 UTC,I am in full emacs adoption mode after that talk. There is a lot of crow being eaten but also a lot better work flow being made.
emacs,38u19v,verdigris2014,0,Sun Jun 7 02:13:45 2015 UTC,Thanks for posting that. Very good presentation. So your saying you aren't using evil anymore?
emacs,38u19v,bakuretsu,3,Sun Jun 7 02:47:09 2015 UTC,I was a pretty hard-core vim user. I am now moving over to emacs and evil mode.
emacs,38u19v,dcorbe,2,Sun Jun 7 03:29:48 2015 UTC,"Oh no, I am. The Vim meetup group was very receptive, too. I may have changed some perspectives."
emacs,38u19v,spoofedexistence,2,Sun Jun 7 03:16:46 2015 UTC,"You mentioned that you still prefer VIM for editing files remotely; but how in depth have you really explored tramp?  Just some things to consider.  You don't ever need to leave the comfort and warm embrace of your local emacs session in order to get work done on remote hosts.  You can edit files remotely through SSH (or plink and putty on Windows), so the key management issues you briefly alluded to during your talk are rather moot.  You can edit files remotely through privilege walls such as sudo and su.  magit works great over ssh too as long as you disable vc-mode.  vc works like shit over tramp and in all honesty magit is better for git than vc is anyways.  You can even spawn remote shells over tramp for doing things like restarting services."
emacs,38u19v,bakuretsu,2,Sun Jun 7 14:35:18 2015 UTC,"What bindings, vim or emacs, do you use for interacting with the editor and not editing text? for example, when opening files, managing buffers, saving files, creating, moving, deleting windows, etc...  For this tasks what route do you recommend? to keep using the vim ones or use the emacs ones?"
emacs,38u19v,bakuretsu,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:48:36 2015 UTC,"I've definitely forged my own path. I used to use tpope's ""Vinegar"" plug-in for file browsing, so instead of that I bound helm-find-files to the - key. It is at least as powerful. You could easily bind hyphen to one of the dired commands, which would be perhaps more similar.  For file saving, I have ,w bound to save (<leader>w), and for switching buffers I have ,. bound to ""switch to previous buffer"" and ,b bound to helm-mini, which is like the buffer selector on crack (it includes recent files in addition to currently open buffers).  So I guess most of my file/buffer commands are Vim-like. I tend to use Vim-like mappings for things that I use very often."
emacs,38u19v,dcorbe,2,Sun Jun 7 22:58:52 2015 UTC,"evil-mode is still a crutch, productivity-wise, you should start gradually moving to the pure emacs way of doing things since it's a lot faster if you master it (and by that I mean using control, meta, super, hyper key modifiers instead of modal editing) and that doesn't necessarily mean C-v, M-v for page-up/page-down, as you mentioned rebinding keys is trivial and everyone should do it. So, don't focus on the existing key bindings which are there for historic reasons, but focus on the paradigm itself.  Tramp is super fast and better than remoting somewhere and running VIM, since, as you mentioned, bringing things into Emacs allows you to take full advantage of its power. While other editors are operating on text, Emacs operates on lisp datastructures (objects). This means that one can use emacs lisp to glue emacs applications together and exchange/transform data at boundaries that HE controls, not just boundaries chosen by the developers who wrote the API.  This is HUGE and tremendously empowering but again it takes some time for ppl to realize  what they have at their hands and for all of that to sink in. Certainly one needs to treat Emacs as more than an editor for that to happen.  The other thing you didn't spend a lot of time over, is the Lisp Machine aspect of Emacs. Its power comes from being written in Lisp (only some low-level bits and the redisplay engine are written in C for performance) which allows you to change pretty much EVERYTHING at runtime, interactively and mold Emacs to your ways. Also, the feedback loop from exploring/describing/understanding/changing/debugging code and seeing your changes is kept extremely short which allows you to enter a state of flow (like an artist working on a clay sculpture or a painter). No other language, besides Smalltalk, does this as good as Lisp.  So, over a period of years of using and extending Emacs, it's no longer Emacs but it becomes an extension of yourself and this is what pretty much every other editor out there is missing. 4-5-10 yrs from now, unless we get to direct neural interfaces (and even if we do odds are someone will write elisp to support them), I'm still going to be using Emacs with my 20 year old config+extensions, while Sublime,Textmate,Atom and the rest of the hipster garbage are either abandoned or on life support.  I used VIM for 10 yrs before discovering Emacs, but after I did (and learned emacs lisp) and fully grasped the implications of what it truly was, I never bothered with VIM again.  Emacs is a life skill and worth devoting time to learn."
emacs,38u19v,jplindstrom,13,Sun Jun 7 13:22:12 2015 UTC,"I fundamentally disagree that evil-mode is a crutch. Modal editing is by far the most efficient and semantically sensible interface for actual text editing.  That said, I've embraced some very Emacs-ish keys for other functions, like C-l, which toggles the position of the current line at the top, middle, and bottom of the viewport sequentially. It's convenient to be able to hit a few of these regardless of the evil state (i.e., in insert mode you can still press C-l).  The point being, everyone has their own workflow and hand flexibility and preferences, and I agree with your core point that Emacs is more capable of becoming an extension of yourself because evil-mode is layered on rather than baked in.  Also, I've used tramp, and it's really sweet."
emacs,38u19v,bakuretsu,8,Sun Jun 7 13:40:04 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree here.  evil isn't a crutch.  It's the gold standard for VIM users.  The whole point of emacs is the extent to which it can be customized and if that customization leads you to something that behaves exactly like a different editor entirely, then why is that a bad thing?"
emacs,38u19v,aport,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:45:45 2015 UTC,"I turned to evil-mode after probably 8 years of Emacs, and I also continue to use e.g. C-l for changing the viewport.   It does work very well. However, if someone else is watching your screen, hitting C-l twice for putting point at the top of the window is very ""flickery"" and the other person will get totally lost as to what they're looking at.   In that case, the vim ""zt"" is more audience friendly."
emacs,38u19v,verdigris2014,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:02:20 2015 UTC,"If I'm in normal mode, I definitely use zz more often to center the current line on the screen."
emacs,38u19v,Funnnny,6,Sun Jun 7 19:48:34 2015 UTC,Using VIM bindings for editing text has absolutely nothing to do with anything else emacs offers. I don't understand your diatribe at all.
emacs,38u19v,hrsII,0,Sun Jun 7 18:42:58 2015 UTC,"My diatribe is really my personal experience after 10 years of using VIM and therefore having been proficient at it.  After I moved to Emacs and became proficient with the Emacs way of doing things, I find that non-modal editing using Emacs modifiers is substantially faster than the VIM way.  YMMV but for me, the difference was night and day. To get maximum advantage of what I'm describing, you do need a good keyboard though (at a minimum change CAPS to Control) with good placement for whatever keys you use for Super/Hyper. If you use CAPS for C, Meta is usually conveniently placed for the thumbs to hit."
emacs,38u19v,parolang,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:42:18 2015 UTC,"""So, don't focus on the existing key bindings which are there for historic reasons, but focus on the paradigm itself.""  I'm not a power user, but have been using unix like systems for many years eventually settling on emacs rather than vim.   To your point about remapping, I tend not to for two reasons;  Portability - of course I can take my setting with me, but it's easier to have the common base if I was to tell or be reminded by another user of a key sequence.   Historical reasons - emacs is so old yet flexible, that in my experience, others have chosen keys that don't conflict and have some sort of logic. For example I see someone posted as to why c-v m-v."

Once you're happy with the basics described there you might want to then look at some of the various enhancements for window management such as windmove which adds support for directional window selection, or winner mode which provides a history mechanism for restoring previous window configurations.  It's nearly always possible to make Emacs perform exactly as you want, but if you're new to Emacs I'd suggest learning it as it is first, and then moving on to look at the many ways that it can be extended and altered to suit your personal taste."

I like the idea but find the re-sizing really jarring, though. I think in situations were I have more than two windows one is supposed to be the main one and stay larger. Maybe rotating the buffers through one window layout would be less weird?  Edit: Rotating looks pretty cool, at least for two windows. Might have to build upon this layout-mode idea and do some switching of keybindings. Like, in the two-window mode leader + h/l move between windows and j/k rotates them? And in the free mode h/j/k/l move between windows and split if there aren't any window to move to in that direction? In three window mode h/l could wrap around so that you can get to every window in one move but I am not sure what  j/k could be used for. And should modes automatically switch in a sensible way if you do something like splitting? And why do I always have to over complicate simple ideas :("

It's really nice but I haven't been able to get an exact match on the workflow.  In tmux there's a green bar that displays what windows are running what (that one can rename and script), I haven't seen anything similar in spacemacs / Emacs.  There's a package called eyebrowse that enables one to have multiple frames within a frame (probably the wrong terminology there...), but as you can't see what frame is running what it's not really the same as tmux.   So I've been using frames and splits for my workflow, spacemacs is great, but it hadn't got a workflow like tmux as it doesn't have that bar thing."

I've put together some settings, code and tips for doing that here (I called it a ""mode"" at the time but that's a bit of a lie, it doesn't actually define an emacs mode).

I do think that there may be a lack of reserved prefixes for cross-major-mode bindings, though, so that that prefix can at least be reasonable to begin.  That is important to have a ""working out of box"" behavior.  It might also be nice to have a new function that requests a keybinding, but doesn't just silently stomp any existing keybinding.  That way, any conflict can be made user-visible (either via a log message or maybe even flag the two packages/functions that are conflicting and ask the user to reassign).  Some features expect to override existing bindings (e.g. C-x b for switch-to-buffer should be overridden by ibuffer), but most do not want to conflict.  I also wish that there were a handful of ""short"" user-reserved combinations -- I use M-"" for one user-keybinding that I need to hit frequently.  That's not really correct, but nothing I use has been actively-using it...  And while I'm at it, it would be nice if there were a way to check  that a particular combination is likely to be incompatible with TTY modes -- some authors have used bindings that simply cannot be encoded via current terminal conventions (like control-shift-letter) in their packages and don't realize that this breaks TTY compatibility.  Other people use things like C-M-S-<right>, which a number of very-commonly-used terminals do not have an encoding for.  C-M-% for query-replace-regex is a problem present even in base emacs.  It'd be nice to reserve those for features that are inherently TTY-incompatible anyway, like the emacs fringe."

For instance, the ;' key-chord is the most convenient binding for me for smex. It would be a chore for me if it bound smex to M-x by default and then I had to unbind/rebind that.

Two, I prefer to just bind a hotkey in my window manager to a bash script that toggles the touchpad on/off.   Though I don't usually want it on in emacs, I occasionally do, mostly for juggling URIs between shell/emacs/browser(s), or other such cut'n'paste operations.

Minimize using pincky. That means for instance minimising the use of Shift as well. Go for big and strong thumbs instead. I have both L_Command and R_Command (Mac keyboard, should be Alt or Win key on Windows) bound to Sticky Shift when pressed alone (act as one time sticky Shift when pressed alone, so that only the next key pressed is shifted) but act as Meta (Command) when pressed with another key or keys (as modifier). In general you should be asking questions about Karabiner on its dedicated forum. It's xml config syntax is horrendous but the author is very helpful.  If you're prepared to go to the extremes you may want to create you very own custom keyboard layout. Karabiner is too slow for that, so you'd need to turn to 'native' solutions. On a Mac google for Ukelele. Idea is again to minimize Shifting, so for instance I have a separate layout for numbers activated by holding Alt (physical Shift) with all numbers typed by right hand much like on a numpad. This leaves the entire upper row for special symbols that you use way more often in programming than numbers and that normally require Shifting."

Emacs bindings remain untouched to some degree, and you can drop into Emacs state if you like with C-z, where they do remain untouched, except for C-z obviously. I consider the Vim editing model to be vastly superior.   Can I use evil-mode extensions without using vim-like editing system?   Some, but not all. Most of the Evil extensions tend to have decent basic Emacs equivalents in any case.   Not really a question but is that 2-state-text-editing really superior or just an habit of old vim users? Also in many ""vim vs emacs"" topics being able to run on console is given as a feature for vim to edit files on server/terminal. However, emacs can also be used in terminal without using X, so why would it be given as unique a feature?   As I said, I would say it's superior.

emacs,38j71d,thang1thang2,4,Thu Jun 4 19:26:58 2015 UTC,"You should probably use Emacs for a little bit and wrap your head around the core concepts before you jump into the deep-end with Elisp.  You can save yourself from some headaches by using one of the  ""Starter Kits"" until you get to know it a little better. Spacemacs is good if you're coming from a VIM background. Otherwise you might consider starting with Prelude or Emacs Starter Kit. Prelude looks like it comes pretty well configured for Python programming.  Mickey Petersen just released the book Mastering Emacs, which could be a good starting point. Worth a look.  Once you get used to Emacs you can start learning Emacs Lisp. Changing keybindings is a good starting point:  (global-set-key (kbd ""C-z"") #'undo) ; Ctrl-Z is undo   At some point you'll want to read the Emacs Lisp manual, but take things one step at a time."

emacs,38j71d,thebhgg,2,Thu Jun 4 19:28:10 2015 UTC,Spacemacs has Emacs mode as well as vim keys now.   Mapping keys didn't seem as simple as the nnoremap and whatnot that vim has.
emacs,38j71d,zck,2,Thu Jun 4 20:12:05 2015 UTC,"Because the key binding scheme in Vim is very simple. It only has global key mapping. In Emacs, you have both global key mapping and local key mapping, and that's why when you map keys, you have to specify a keymap variable, which determines the scope of such key binding."
emacs,38j71d,mitc0185,2,Fri Jun 5 03:25:35 2015 UTC,"This actually took me a while to understand. Now it makes sense and I prefer the extra power it gives, but it is more confusing at the beginning for a lot of people, I think."

emacs,38j71d,__baxx__,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:43:46 2015 UTC,"That seems like an arbitrary suggestion. I'm not even planning on using the default hotkey layout, by the way. In my current key layout on Windows, I use left and right alt as modifier keys."
emacs,38j71d,bagofries,4,Thu Jun 4 19:59:44 2015 UTC,"It is pretty common advice.  Emacs pinky is a known thing, though if you have customized your emacs setup so that control keys aren't used very much (and meta, super, or hyper is more common) then feel free to do your own thing."
emacs,38j71d,__baxx__,3,Thu Jun 4 20:32:31 2015 UTC,"That seems like an arbitrary suggestion.   It's a very commonly suggested thing. Rather than being arbitrary, the thought process is pretty simple. Emacs commands extensively use modifier keys, with the most common modifier key being Control. Control is in a relatively awkward place on the keyboard -- more awkward than Alt. Caps Lock is in an easy-to-press place on the keyboard, and most people never use it. So swapping Control with Caps Lock is a big net gain.  Here's a small discussion about switching them in Windows, if you find yourself convinced and possibly wanting to switch them when Emacs is open. The solution isn't perfect, but c'est la vie.  As someone who's recommended the built-in Emacs tutorial before, can you go into more detail about what you didn't like about it, and why the vim tutorial was better? (Also, was the vim tutorial you used ""vimtutor""? That and the Emacs tutorial seem very similar to me.) By saying it's not ""interactive"", do you mean that it doesn't have messages saying ""that's right, you pressed C-v properly""? Certainly it's interactive in that you're interacting with text, doing what it tells you to do."

I always thought there was an early lisp machine keyboard design that influenced this, but apparently there's not.   Sun keyboards had the control key positioned here: http://xahlee.info/kbd/i/kb/sun_keyboard_left.jpg  But by the time they came along Emacs was well established.  Anyway, it's advice from an emacs user. Take it or leave it. I can't stand machines that don't have the keys swapped out now. It's so hard to get my pinky down to the bottom row..."

TBH I haven't really liked much of the Emacs docs, I personally preferred the VIm ones, I know it's not official VIm documentation but I'm yet to find something for Emacs that's anywhere near Steve Loshes Learn Vim Script the Hard Way.    I'm not sure how open you are to using things that aren't strictly vanilla Emacs, but I've been using Spacemacs and think its a pretty decent starting point.   For example, it left me ignorant to how to manage files, forced to look at the duplicate save files through the file system of my OS.   Not too sure what you mean, like using the eShell or something? (what system are you on?)   What I'd like to be able to do is to use Emacs as as an editor text that contains links to other pieces of text, and which contains formatting such as bold, italics, and coloration.   I'm not sure what you mean by this either, like open multiple files at once? Manage multiple buffers and such?  The formatting that you're after will probably be handled by the Mode and the syntax highlighting. Eg I'm writing this in Markdown mode, so if I do this I can see it's italic, if I was to do that in Python mode it wouldn't make the font italic though.   I'd also like to be able to customize my own hotkeys and write my own text manipulation functions without leaving the editor.   Afaik that's one of the 'things' emacs is meant to be a champ at, I haven't learnt any eLisp yet though. If you want to do any of this kind of thing eLisp seems to be the thing to learn.    And, I'd like to be able to use it as a Python IDE.   Cool, though when you say IDE what are you actually after? I use it with Python though I tend to just have a split with the Py file in one buffer and the REPL in the other. You can run the file that you're working on into the REPL and stuff nicely. It also has error checking and all that jazz, I'm not sure that its as extensive as something like PyCharm though (I've never used that).  Every resource that I've tried seems to be more advanced than what I need at this point; I simply would like to start from the beginning.   What is Emacs, and what do I do in order to set it up to do the stuff that I want?   Using things such as Spacemacs seems to be a bit of a back and forth in the community with some advocating it and others saying one should start completely vanilla and (seemingly) design ones own editor functionality. I've been using it and feel its a really good starting point for Emacs as there's a decent (sane) set of defaults ready to go.  Although you're asking to start from the beginning, so maybe you want to go through everything from scratch idk."

For learning Emacs, http://david.rothlis.net/emacs/howtolearn.html seems pretty good. Personally, I used the built-in Emacs tutorial. I also can't emphasize enough that Emacs has by far the best on-line help system of any program I know of. What do I mean by on-line? I don't mean on the Internet, I mean that within Emacs, in any buffer in any mode, you can get help for anything you need without leaving the editor. C-h C-k will prompt for a keystroke and tell you what command, if any, is bound to it, show documentation for that command, and offer links to its definition. C-h v will prompt for a variable name (often pre-filled with the variable you're interested in, like magic) and show the documentation for it, along with links to the definition. The same goes for C-h f (function/command documentation), C-h m (modes active in the current buffer), and a whole bunch others all listed under C-h C-h.

In spacemacs there's something called the 'guide key' which i have to say is a really cool feature.

When you feel confident, if you like it, you can customize you way around the editor (I want to do THAT with THIS key(s)) and you can start using it for more creative tasks like your agenda (org-mode), your email (I like mu4e, gnus is very popular and is also used as news aggregator), add extra packages from package-list-packages, etc.  For the Python thing I can't help, I use it as it is for Python (with Yasnippet for custom snippets), and I heavily customized it for Java and web (PHP, CSS/SASS, JavaScript, HTML...).  org-mode is also the way to go (IMHO) for text formatting if you are the only one who is going to work with those files (if you are in a team you should all agree on a file format), but I don't about the links to other pieces of text part.

Don't do that. Once you starting using emacs regularly, the original bindings will start making sense.  Mistakes I made when making custom bindings:   Didn't realize that some of them will conflict with very useful bindings in modes like org-modeExample: C-c C-d Unbound important keys that I thought I'll never use (because either I didn't care if it was already bound to something else or I didn't understand the awesomeness of the original command) Eg: C-x h"
emacs,38j71d,camsaul,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:04:46 2015 UTC,"I somewhat disagree. The default simple keybindings (C-a, C-e, etc.) are okayish, mostly because they're used in bash, readline and OSX but the more complex chords are simply awful. There's bound to be some kind of command you'll (want to) use regularly hidden behind some ""C-x r b"" invocation. You want to rebind that to something simpler.  Worse, by not rebinding you'll stop using potentially useful commands because they're such a drudge to execute when hidden behind a complex chord."
emacs,38j71d,Denommus,1 point,Fri Jun 5 09:34:45 2015 UTC,"I am not against rebinding at a later stage when one knows what exactly they are doing. But I am cautioning new emacs users to not do the rebinding when they are still learning emacs and don't understand the full gravity of the rebinding they are doing.   And if they are using the inbuilt emacs tutorial (C-h t) (and I think that they should) and if they already rebound a bunch of keys, then the tutorial will be less useful. Because then you will see a note at the top of the tutorial that certain bindings have been changed from the default and such bindings will be highlighted (I think they show up in the warning face).   I don't use bookmarking a lot (related to the C-x r b binding); I believe that's something you would need to train yourself to bring into the routine workflow. And it's on my long list to start using along with abbrev, skeleton and other things.   But I do use these rectangle bindings almost daily: C-x r k, c, M-w, y, t. They, as I mentioned earlier, now just make more sense to me: killing (cutting), clearing, M-w (default binding for copying), yanking, text. The initial r in C-x r could stand for register or rectangle.   Now the guide-key package has a very useful feature which highlights these two families of keys which are living under the same prefix C-x r using different colors. So from a quick glance you can search for keys related to rectangles or registers. And once they are in your workflow, the keys will flow instinctively. So I wouldn't rebind C-x or C-x r in the early stages of learning."

Totally different byte.  When I swapped out my keys, it was a hard switch at first. I'll admit that much. Sometimes, it still gives me a 'gotcha', but it's worth it for the pain that my hands are not in.  Example of gotcha: using OS X, C-a and C-e behave as they should whichever text field you're using. This made me use C-a and C-e more and frankly, it's wonderful. But I got used to it a little too much -- for example, RES intercepts C-e to open the full-screen editor.

By remapping these keystrokes, you're removing a large chunk of the ""experience"", so it might be better to stick with another text editor. Not to mention that a lot of Emacs users won't be able to help you because they won't be able to get around.  My advice: give the vanilla keybindings a chance, I think you'll find that you grow to love them after not too long. If you still hate 'em, try Vim. If you hate Vim, then keyboard-only (primarily) text editors may not be for you.  Just my opinion. Hope it goes well for you."

Long story short - my new job leaves me with very little time to work on my OSS projects and this is the primary cause of the delay. There's nothing I can do about this. If people want for releases to happen more quickly they should contribute more to the project. I'd like to thank everyone who contributed to 0.9's development so far. A ton of people contributed a ton of awesome functionality, which kept momentum going.  Outside of this, ClojureScript has been causing us the most technical issues. A couple of changes there were really problematic for us and are the only reason 0.9 can't be released right away. This is the only showstopper issue right now https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1088  I'm hoping to release 0.9 in time for EuroClojure, but I can't make any promises."

emacs,38gd2n,tuhdo,2,Thu Jun 4 15:57:04 2015 UTC,"You don't have to remember all though. Just remember the main one. That's why tool like guide-key and helm-descbinds exists. To use helm-desbinds, if you press some keys, but forgot the remainig keys, you can press C-h or ?, and Spacemacs gives you an interactive cheatsheet. For example, if you want to list all key bindings under SPC f, type SPC f ?.  The Spacemacs key bindings are easy to remember:   SPC is the leader key, hence the name Spacemacs. SPC f is a group for file commands. SPC f f prompts you to open files. SPC b is a group for buffer commands. SPC b b prompts you to open buffers. SPC s is a group for search commands. SPC s s prompts you to search current buffer. SPC p is a group for project related commands.  ... and so on.   SPC m, or equivalently, , groups commands of current major mode. It may take 3 keys to execute, but it's not that bad."
emacs,38gd2n,Tarmen,1 point,Fri Jun 5 09:00:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about Spacemacs (I'm a long term Emacs user back from the 90s, so I have no Vim muscle memory)   I was always under the impression that evil, the vim engine used by Spacemacs, was pretty complete.  I think problems arise when you have a fairly complicated Vim setup with a lot of plugin.vim files and you have all that in your muscle memory.  There are a lot of Evil add on packages to ease this problem, so as long as you're fine to investigate, and the things you need have been converted, that's cool.  If they haven't, the best thing you can do is try to find similar Emacs packages and bind the commands into a key map.  Hydra.el makes this process much simpler than it would be with the base elisp commands.    I won't lie though, Emacs is an investment of work, but it's payoffs are well worth it.  https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra  Additional Note: use Guide-key (I think that's included with Spacemacs) anyway, just switch it on and things will be easier... You can add more prefixes to guide key too."
emacs,38gd2n,tuhdo,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:13:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think my problem is actually that guide key is included. Pretty much anything it can do is mapped to space so any action needs at least 3 keys and it feels impossible to remember what anything does, and that is only the additional layer of space macs and doesn't even touch emacs itself.  Probably just gonna try evil instead. In general I swapped between enough vim configurations that I can deal with the standard setup (minus a few horribly dumb ones like forcing you to save buffers if they are hidden). Some text objects like ia/aa for function arguments or ii/ai for indentation should be reasonably easy to do with evil features. And mapping stuff myself feels generally easier to remember.  Anyway, thanks for the hydra thing! Used something similar for vim for quite a while. At some point I mostly switched to trying for better keybindings so I didn't need as many repetitions but I guess you can never bring all emacs functionality in there without ridiculously long combinations."

I feel though, for the people that this would affect the most, a logical step is to try other things, and try to configure Emacs from scratch.  Something simpler like better-defaults is a nice way to go, get rid of some of the ugliness and then use Spacemacs as a guide for packages to install.  Hacking Emacs personally is the best way to get to grips with it.  That is after all, what Emacs was intended for."
emacs,38gd2n,__baxx__,3,Fri Jun 5 03:50:19 2015 UTC,"Spacemacs includes nicely preconfigured layers that you would waste hours configuring yourself. Recently I just add Python layer, and it just works. If I have to do this on myself for every new thing I want to add, it would waste more time than it should be.  Spacemacs does not shadow any default key binding. It only adds its own, so everything from Emacs manual still works.  Spacemacs is no longer a starter kit. It's now a shared .emacs.d."

Minor edits. If I had to go back to the org file, jumping two and fro makes things slower and once I am on org, I'll have a ton of text to sort through before I get to the required block.

This can be annoying as one gets used to using fd (or any reassignments) and has to remember that it cannot be used within a macro.  You can't use :iabbrev in a session, or :nnoremap, these ex commands seem to be off limits.     I'm using Spacemacs at the moment though, and have to say that it's very nice.

Then helm-projectile-find-file is available for you too.  - of course you can do all this without helm too, but the two together mesh well."

For scss you should make sure scss and scss-lint are installed and accessible via the Emacs exec-path (just try doing M-x async-shell-command and see what output you get.)

emacs,37xyyx,instant_sunshine,3,Sun May 31 11:07:15 2015 UTC,"Corral seems to be a emacs styled version of the surround plugin for vim. Surround solves a different problem in vim than smartparens. Surround adds ""surround"" as a text object to the vim editing ""language"". This allows me to do things like change the surrounding parenthesis to brackets, or surround a word/sentence/paragraph with {}, or delete the surrounding <, etc.  Basically, the surround plugin helps me with refactoring much more than with originally writing the code. Smartparens helps with originally writing the code by taking care of the closing delimiters; but it didn't seem to have a whole lot of refactoring actions (from what I saw), which is where corral/surround shine."
emacs,37xyyx,thang1thang2,2,Sun May 31 22:18:59 2015 UTC,"You can surround anything with smartparens by selecting a region, then enter any punctuation character like (, [, ""... to wrap around the region. You can quickly select a symbol at point with C-] to wrap around; or you can use expand-region to incrementally select things at point. To replace existing pair with new pair, you can use sp-rewrap-sexp.  Though, for wrap around a symbol without moving point, I found corral much faster than any other alternative, even vim surround. Basically I bound C-9/0 to corral-parentheses-backward/forward and only need 2 key presses, whether other solutions require 4 or more key presses."
emacs,37xyyx,tuhdo,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:55:35 2015 UTC,"Ah thanks. Nice to know you can surround text with smartparens. The ""without moving point"" is kind of important to me though, since it makes the most sense to me.   I type at over 100wpm. The speed difference between coral's c-0 and vim's ysiw is a fraction of a second, but vim's surround plug in behavior means I can type ""ysi""  and then w for word, p for paragraph, s for sentence, etc. It's a lot more flexibility in a way j find easier to memorize (personally), so the fraction of a second speed difference ends up not muttering to me.   Different strokes for different folks I guess. Thanks for the clarification on smartparens though."

Surrounding paragraphs/sentences doesn't seem that practical when writing code.

Here is how I use Semantic to convert a function to function pointer. Demo begins when you see START DEMO in the minibuffer. If Semantic does not support your language, you must first write a BNF grammar file and compile it so Semantic can recognize your language and produce language tags that you can then use to do whatever you need. Here is a short guide on adding a new language in Semantic (you may skip EDE part). Emacs is bundled with Semantic, so you may find it useful to navigate to cedet source, open the file c.by as an example of bovine parser. You can view it online here. If you view the file in Emacs, you have syntax highlighting since CEDET supports language development with it."

emacs,37p8dl,lemurnomicon,1 point,Fri May 29 14:35:23 2015 UTC,Another thing to be aware of is that org can export as markdown (among other formats) if you have something that needs actual markdown.  You can keep the original with all the org bells and whistles and then export the contents for the target.  http://orgmode.org/manual/Markdown-export.html

I use the same configuration on OSX and Windows -- with the code testing for each OS, OS version, and screen size, and taking whatever action is needed based thereon.  This makes backup and synchronization to multiple computers and cyberspace (with rsync) a breeze.  My init.el has a few basics to set initial frame defaults and such, and then require statements for all of my custom libraries.  I have a dialog that prompts me whether I want to start with -Q or not -- it's on a 3 second timer with a default to a full lineup of stuff.  When I am troubleshooting my installation, I comment out the various require statements in the init.el if I haven't been able to find the problem elsewise (e.g., grep and so forth).  Debugging is enabled full-time so I catch a meaningful output to help track down the problem; and, most of the known (error . . . code statements have been modified/replaced by me to just tell me in a message so that a detailed dialog doesn't come up by default -- e.g., (let ((debug-on-quit nil)) (signal 'quit '(""This is your quit message."")))"

Place your cursor on the org-agenda entry (not the org-mode entry) at issue and evaluate (text-properties-at (point)), or send the result to your *Messages* buffer, and see if it has the criteria needed to sort a particular type.  It's been more than a year since I did this, and I don't remember exactly which ones I modified in my custom setup.  Absent modifying the function to include the necessary text-properties (if this is one of the ones that has problems), it will never work correctly.  Here is a quote from my 2013 thread:  For anyone battling with org-tags-view and org-scan-tags and org-agenda-list and org-agenda-get-deadlines and other related functions, if you will take a look at the section relating to org-add-props txt props, you will see that the org team has not provided enough text properties to sort the todo tasks with all the various options listed in defcustom org-agenda-sorting-strategy -- so before driving yourself crazy trying to figure out why all the sorting options don't work, first take a look to see if there are even text properties assigned to deal with those sorting options -- if not, then you will need spend time modifying things if you want those options to be available."

I have reduced my example to the absolute minimum and I still couldn't get any sorting strategies to make any difference for the this type of DEADLINE/SCHEDULE selector. This makes me think that the time property is getting discarded once the tasks are retrieved and thus the order is irrelevant."
emacs,37im9d,lawlist,1 point,Thu May 28 05:23:44 2015 UTC,"Type M-x find-library RET org-agenda RET.  Then use i-search to look for org-add-props txt props.  You will see that there are eight (8) times that this text appears in the source-code.  You would need to repeat the above process with the org.el library, where org-add-props txt props is used -- i.e., within org-tags-view and org-search-view.  The entries underneath each of the sections correspond to the text properties that are added so that (among other uses) the various options of org-agenda-sorting-strategy may be used.  A few are missing depending upon which of the org-add-props txt props references you are looking at.  To fix it, the missing properties need to be added and the corresponding values need to be calculated/set higher up in the function and then added to the section where it is missing.  This is an advanced tweak/fix requiring intermediate elisp skills.  I haven't compared your example to each of the ten (10) references to org-add-props txt props and/or verified which version of org-mode you are using, and this would be a time-consuming project to fix and test the various possibilities.  I also haven't verified that this is indeed your problem; however, it looks and smells like it probably is -- since this is what I went through a couple of years ago to fix the options that I needed that were missing.  Revealing the hidden text-properties contained within each heading in the *Org Agenda* buffer is a shortcut to see what text-properties are actually there and to see if the ones you are trying to sort are present -- if the property and/or value is missing, then you will have identified the problem and can begin to work on the solution.  This may be a project that remains on your todo-list for the future when your elisp skills become more advanced.  You could, of course, submit a report to the org-mode team.  Before doing that, however, you should install the most recent public stable release of org-mode and see how it behaves."

This way the window wouldn't split and then unsplit for no reason when I have another frame open with the *compilation* buffer.  I tried changing check-buffer-window to check-buffer, but that didn't seem to have any effect."

emacs,37f7rc,lawlist,2,Wed May 27 20:52:21 2015 UTC,"Oh, sorry for not being clear.  What I did:  - installed bury-successful-compilation from melpa  - placed (bury-successful-compilation t) into init.el  - called M-x eval-buffer and made sure bury-successful-compilation mode was enabled  - called M-x compile with no current window split (my compile command is set to: ""cd ~/workspace/ogre/projects/lastditch/build && make -k install && cd dist/bin && ./OgreApp"", maybe this is the problem?)  What did I expect:  - I expected the compilation buffer to appear as normal when I built the project, and then after it succeeded, or after I closed the running application, I expected it to bury the compilation window   What happened:  - It just acted like normal. The complilation succeeded, the program ran successfully, and afterwards the compliation buffer was still visible in a split window.  The only major difference I see is that I have a bunch of extra junk in my compile command. Also, I often compile using ""recompile"". Is that supposed to work with this package?"
emacs,37f7rc,instant_sunshine,1 point,Wed May 27 21:51:05 2015 UTC,"I had a little issue using the -C flag in this case. The -C flag seems to automatically return to the previous directory when it is finished. This makes it a little more cumbersome for me to quickly change into the 'dist/bin' directory that has my executable and run the application. Using 'cd' fixes this, because it doesn't bounce back to original directory after building.  The ""extra junk"" I was talking about was just the extra calls in my compile command, not extra output in the compilation buffer.  I'm usually pretty good about avoiding warnings, but I am using the Ogre3d open source library, and it definitely has a bunch of warnings that show up in flycheck, but I don't rebuild the library with my project so I don't think that should be a problem. But for the project I'm building, there are no warnings displayed during building. I don't even suppress those pesky unsigned or logical-op-parentheses warnings ; )  Thanks for being so diligent about your package!"

The ""handlers"" just exist internally, but the application should be written with composition of events and behaviors in mind.  Nevertheless, Emacs is much older than the entire idea of FRP. It's written with mutability in mind. But an editor based on FRP might be interesting."
emacs,37c6dy,Denommus,1 point,Tue May 26 15:38:32 2015 UTC,"Give that whole (very lengthy) link about re-frame a read, it explains it much better than I have.   It is stream-based. Changes and updates to the data are streamed to components subscribed to that stream, and those components in turn emit data onto other streams, from component to component as in the above diagrams. The event handlers I am talking about are just components subscribed to the event stream. I suppose there would be another event queue internally to handle all the updates and manage the streams, but like you said, that would be an implementation thing.   Its interesting that emacs deals with mutable data, and isn't so purely functional as I had thought. The ideas I've been thinking over are very heavily inspired by my (possibly erroneous) understanding of lisp and emacs. I suppose you could describe it as a FRP version of emacs? An application based on FRP written in lisp (clojurescript, probably) which the user can extend by writing their own lisp functions and create any functionality that can be built on those FRP components."

When the Helm window is active, he interprets <left> and <right> to switch a Helm source below or upper. Much faster than with the mouse, IMHO.   And I bound the Ctrl key (which Capslock is the Ctrl key, actually) to send a signal, when there is no another key pressed. For example, when I press C-h, then C-h will be sent. But when I press Ctrl only, and release it, without pressing another key simultaneously, then he will send <f9> which is the command to open Helm up."

Besides covering modern features of Emacs (for example I notice you write about CUA Mode), what were some of the specific goals you set out to achieve with 'Mastering Emacs'?"
emacs,36zcny,__baxx__,11,Sat May 23 12:37:33 2015 UTC,"Good question.  I had to teach myself Emacs a good 12 years or so ago. I enjoyed the act of learning how to use Emacs --- but then I was a student with near-infinite amounts of time on my hands.  Emacs is hard to learn because too many people struggle to move past the tutorial. Indeed, the first ever blog article I wrote was ""Moving past the tutorial"". My view of how to learn Emacs ""the right way"" is to understand that Emacs is a search engine in its own right. If you want answers to questions you should know how to ask Emacs.   The first part of the book teaches you the fundamentals (terminology, Emacs's modifiers, etc.) but then I explain how to use Emacs's info manual, apropos, and describe system to discover more about Emacs -- or remember forgotten keys or commands.  That, more than anything, is Emacs mastery: knowing where to seek an answer to your question.  The rest of the book covers movement (why Emacs's word movement is asymmetric), editing and the practicals (Dired, a bit about Shells, TRAMP).  It is mostly a distillation of 13 years of learning to, I suppose, a book that I would've found immensely useful were I to learn Emacs again."

emacs,370k9p,reddit_uname,14,Sat May 23 19:08:47 2015 UTC,"A few tips for stock Emacs:   C-[ can be used instead of ESC.  For many keybindings it's the quickest option, e.g. M-C-f is best done by C-[ C-f. If you need to hold down ctrl you can do that with your palm. Specifically the joint just below the pinkie finger. That works on a desktop keyboard but not on a laptop one. On a laptop one the thumb is better. The M-{ and M-} paragraph movement commands are very useful, even for navigating code. 1 in the buffer menu. 1 in the buffer menu chooses a buffer and makes it the only window in the frame. 2 in the buffer menu. This chooses a buffer and presents it in one window with the previously selected buffer in the other. (and the buffer menu removed) Bookmarks work on directories in dired. Dired uses the system trashcan if you do (setq delete-by-moving-to-trash t) in your init file. If you do C-x C-f with something like ""*.c"" then Emacs will load every file with that extension. Tags are very useful. If you're a programmer or you use TeX it's definitely worth building tags files for everything you work on. For single files imenu is useful too. M-n in Info mode. This clones the buffer so you can look at several manuals at once or follow one manual in multiple paths. C-h S is a very useful command. Suppose you have installed the GNU info manuals for a language's standard library. If you type C-h S on a command it will take you to the info node for that command. Occur (bound to M-s o) is very useful. (There's also a version for many buffers called M-x multi-occur. It searches every buffer open in Emacs, it's useful with C-x C-f *.lang, but slow.) You can search for symbols in the language you're using with isearch the command is M-s _. You can query replace symbols too with C-u M-%. find-name-dired, find-dired and find-grep-dired are very useful. Skeleton.el is useful for repeated text. Yasnippet is good too, but it's an ELPA package."

emacs,370k9p,RobThorpe,1 point,Sun May 24 14:29:47 2015 UTC,"I use it for both programming and writing documents in latex. Languages I use frequently include R, python, java, c++ with the occasional c. I do lost of searching for things, sometimes among different files, sometimes not knowing what it is I'm looking for. Besides entering lots of text, I also read text (latex or programming) in it."
emacs,370k9p,instant_sunshine,2,Sun May 24 15:10:51 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I don't know that much about R, python, java, C++ or Latex.  I occasionally program in C, but not the others.  Hopefully, others can help you with that.  For programming tags are very useful. It's definitely worth building tag files and creating a makefile target for them.  As instant_sunshine mentioned, searching with grep & rgrep is very useful. For that type of searching you have two general options. There are the external programs like grep and find, and the commands that use them like rgrep. Those are fast, for large codebases they're the only way to work. Then you have the in-Emacs things like occur and multi-occur. Occur is always fastest within one particular file. Loading up lots of files into Emacs and using multi-occur is often slower and more cumbersome than using grep. It can be useful though, for example, if you want to exclude certain files from the search. In that case you load all the files except those ones then use multi-occur."
emacs,370k9p,RobThorpe,6,Sun May 24 16:29:47 2015 UTC,"rgrep (recursive grep) like Ag or Ack query-regexp-replace has great optional lisp based replacement to process your matches/groups. map-query-regexp-replace ... I recently discovered this, replace each match with a member of an adhoc list CUA rectangle mode - the copy/paste (kill/yank) handling of columns is excellent.  Can also fill a sequence of numbers, at different increments and format strings. In other words you could format as binary, octal, hex, or with padding, alignment etc. jump to Occur mode from iSearch C-s / C-r ... Use M-s o and occur will open with the search term, highlighting all matches in the file. Occur is really nice, especially if you get creative with your match/patterns (use it to show all the headings in a markdown doc for a trite example.) Dired is just great, try the % commands ...  C-h f and C-h v ... Emacs lisp Function and Variable info ... a treasure trove. did I mention Wgrep in Rgrep mode? I didn't you can edit the text in a rgrep search... (It'll work in Ag, Ack etc too.) C-s and C-r should be your mouse now btw, check? ido is stock since Emacs v22 Org (that's an obvious one right?) beef up nxml mode with some schemas, relaxNG format is recommended.

emacs,36qs41,BruceConnor,4,Thu May 21 11:29:36 2015 UTC,Excellent!  Does it use the archive or the package-alist to do the autoremove ?  It is important because users use the archive to do automatic installation. Using the archive implies having up to date dependency graph. Using package-alist does not necessarily contains up to date dependencies. This is a chicken and egg issue though.   We now use archive for both in Spacemacs. The archives are updated for new install of packages but it is not for autoremove. It is OK but not ideal.  Do you know if MELPA keeps older versions of a package ?
emacs,36qs41,syl20bnr,3,Thu May 21 12:23:11 2015 UTC,"Does it use the archive or the package-alist to do the autoremove ?   package-alist. Running the autoremove command is like saying: “Do I have anything installed that I don't need AND didnt' ask for? If so, delete it.” So it's about removing what you don't need, the archives don't come into play here.   Do you know if MELPA keeps older versions of a package ?   It does not. Gelpa and Marmalade do, I think."
emacs,36qs41,syl20bnr,1 point,Thu May 21 13:36:44 2015 UTC,"Makes sense but users may run into this kind of corner case if they autoinstall and autoremove automatically (lots of auto :-)): https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/1538  It happens when the archive contains a new dependency for a given package. The package-alist won't contain it until the given package is updated.  So it make me wonder if I should update the parent packages  when a new dependency is ""found"". Problem: it will force people to update some packages even if they don't want it. Having some kind of warning may be useful.  I guess it is the price to pay when MELPA is used as the main repo. For now MELPA is surprisingly stable given the number of packages used in Spacemacs."

I think the more important question is: why are you installing a dependency that the user doesn't locally need?"
emacs,36qs41,hirnbrot,2,Thu May 21 17:31:49 2015 UTC,"That's a very good question. It happens that Spacemacs not only relies on packages.el to install dependencies, it will also check if a dependency is really installed and if it is not the case then it will install it explicitly, it allows to be able to remove any package in Elpa directory and have them reinstalled correctly. I realize with your question that it may not be needed to do so and it may even be harmful since only the last version of a package can be retrieved in MELPA. Thank you!  I will try to rely only on top level packages (that is the packages explicitly listed in the layers) and use only package-alist to detect orphans. It should do it :-)"
emacs,36qs41,vb2014,1 point,Thu May 21 20:31:33 2015 UTC,"I think I see what you mean. So the issue was that spacemacs was using remote information to decide which dependencies needed installing, but local information to decide which ones could be removed?  That's definitely something to keep in mind. For now, I think package.el avoids that issue by only using local information (remote information is only used when a new package has been requested for isntallation)."

It supersedes both paredit and autopair/electric-pair.   Lispy has some nice features that aren't found in the other packages. It uses a novel, modal approach that reminds me of Vim. But instead of explicitly setting the states, it's context aware. Smartparens is more Emacs-like. abo-abo is also a great, active (in both code and community) developer."

I think I generally dislike packages that change my content ""automatically"".  In theory I think that's great, in practice not so much.

If you wish, you can rebind it and navigate with C-M-n and C-M-p instead.  For Clojure, there's a bunch of other cool stuff:   e not only evals, but will also auto-start CIDER if it's not on 2e evals and inserts the result as a comment E evals and inserts the result xr evals and replaces the sexp with the result xf will flatten the sexp at point, i.e. find its definition and substitute the args. This is really cool if you want to apply only part of the function at point. F navigates to definition, D navigates back e can also do a ""debugging"" eval: if you mark a symbol and a sexp (as in a let binding), it will def the symbol to the sexp.

I saw that some package implemented the ""form"" text object, which would be nice to have though. But even though I love text objects and use them all the time, I can't imagine writing Clojure code without paredit. I hardly look at closing parens anymore. Paredit does take a little getting used to. The guide tuhdo mentioned is very good. Once you get the hang of it it's much faster than doing it manually with evil commands.

Vi has a relatively elegant input language of keys, with a more concise structure.  However in my experience it doesn't matter much, since once it's in muscle memory the 'elegance' becomes irrelevant.  If you like that you can use the 'evil' package in Emacs to get vi keys editing.

Package-desc-vers was a function deprecated in 24.3 replaced by the new function package-desc-version.  When I looked through my .emacs.d folder I found several packages making trying to check for the older version package-desc-vers.   That is the error Emacs will return if some code tries to use that function without checking first.  Here's my attack plan.    First, do you use any customized packages or elisp from outside the package system?  I'd try disabling it all and see if the problem goes away.  If that fixes it, you can add it back in piece by piece.  Code from the packaging systems is generally reviewed carefully. Second, have you updated your packages recently? If this is caused by a buggy version in some package it might be fixed now.  You may be able to use the function auto-package-update-now.  (I really like Helm-M-x or Smex to discover functions like this.)  Is that the only debug output? I'd be surprised if there's not a more thorough stack trace than just what you posted before.  If this is due to a particular package (e.g. ace-window-mode...) you can go into .emacs.d/elpa/ and delete it.

The real power in these packages comes from the ast manipuation of not only slurp and barf but convolute, split, raise, join, and many more. If you want to hack lisp I highly recommend trying out lispy and smartparens for a couple of ours."

It doesn't work on strings, but works on (), [], {} and on region selections. All of this pretty well regression-tested.  And, of course, the biggest value of the commands is the ability to combine them quickly and intuitively, which you can.

It's very good for maintaining focus on the matter under review.  When at work using two monitors I don't bother with two frames, I simply extend one frame across the entire two screens and then split the frame with c-x 3 so the horizontal line runs at the split between the two monitors to avoid having to read ""across"" monitors which is always annoying."

The other difference is that it works with proportional fonts (as opposed to monospaced fonts). While there should be little difference in indenting at the beginning of the line (as each space and tab is equally wide), it stops lining up when indenting at the end of the line (for appended comments as shown in the demo) because not every character is equally wide."

You don't. Define. The problem. So you can't even understand why your proposed solution is so off base.

Want some advice?  Before you try and solve a problem, first understand and show people you've understood the problem. You have no understood the problem, nor shown people you've understood the problem.  Also, comment indentation has been a feature on a few IDEs that let you edit multi-line comments even going to the next line, auto padding the content.  So, you're so wrong in so many ways. The worst part? As soon as I saw this title I knew it was going to be complete bollocks.   The reason why we have not yet settled conclusively on either tabs or spaces is that both camps can point to problems in the others' approach. The truth is that both are right to be critical - both solutions are inadequate as neither allows different programmers to look at the same file and have their indentation and columns as wide or as thin as they'd like without text getting misaligned.

Each work-space gets a unique emacs server which is persistent across emacsclient windows/frames within that project, but keeps each project safely sandboxed.  This is really helpful because the same submodule/block may be present (and under slightly different paths of development) in each work-area, and it keeps me from editing the wrong version/instance of a file.  To do this, I set EMACS_SERVER_FILE and initialize a server (if not already active) when loading a terminal for a particular work-space.  Then, I have 'emacs' aliased to $EDITOR, and EDITOR='_editor() { TERM=xterm-256color command emacsclient -t $*; tput rmcup; }; _editor' (works in bash, YMMV in other shells).

emacs,35utw1,FredN,10,Wed May 13 18:19:22 2015 UTC,"I don't use CEDET.  I've found it to be buggy.  Well, that's not true -- I do use it, but just to display the function name that point is in at the top line of the window.  I don't use it for navigation or autocompletion.  I do use exuberant ctags (not GNU GLOBAL), projectile, and magit.  I also use vc for diffs (C-x v =) and to revert bits of changes, which I find to be preferable to magit's interface.  One of the most-time-saving features, IMHO, in projectile is its ability to open a file by name anywhere in the project.  This feature unfortunately currently becomes a bit sluggish on large projects, but it's really convenient.  I use one emacs instance per project; a number of emacs features don't understand project namespacing, and the ""use an emacs server instance for everything"" is not something that I consider to presently be a viable solution (it's fine for your TODO list or running emms or whatever, just not for working on software projects).  I typically have two full-screen-height xterms open, with GNU screen running in each, and name one ""right"" and the other ""left"".  Emacs normally runs in tty mode in the right-hand side; the left is normally reserved for working in terminals or something else that I might want to look at at the same time.  I don't advocate using emacs as a general-purpose screen manager, as some try to do so: despite its excellent feature set, it's far slower than GNU screen.  I have C-c a k bound to compile, and I use the hyperlinks to jump to errors.  I don't  normally use TRAMP; I run the emacs instance on the dev machine, not the local machine.  I don't use a snippeting system.  Despite emacs's large collection, I've been more-or-less unhappy with all of them, and just have a key bound to insert a file starting in a ""snippets"" directory, which is good enough for large static blocks of text.  I also don't use auto-expansion of abbrevs, but I do use manual expansion (though not for code snippits).  I make regular use of M-. and M-* (which work much better in C than C++, since normally a function name fully-specifies the target).  I make regular use of dired.  I use this regularly:  ;; Provide a keybinding to rapidly search through all files an entire git repo   (defun git-grep-repo (search)   ""git-grep the entire current repo""   (interactive    (progn      (require 'grep)      (list (grep-read-regexp))))   (let ((command (grep-expand-template                   (concat ""git --no-pager grep --no-color -n -e <R> ""                           ""`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`"") search)))       (grep-find command))) (global-set-key (kbd ""C-x v f"") 'git-grep-repo)   I can't remember what my beef was with projectile's similar function, but there was definitely some issue with it.  I don't use folding.  I tried a few times to incorporate it into my workflow and found that it didn't buy me much; what I really wanted was to look at useful things that were too far apart.  Instead, when that happens, I just hit C-x 2 to split the window and then browse to the first place in the first window and the second place in the other window.  I do make use of macros sometimes.  I do not use multiple cursors; these provide a subset of macro functionality.  I do make regular use of registers, but not bookmarks (I think that a lot of people that find the bookmarks feature are looking for registers, to save where they are and jump back when doing work).  I do make not-infrequent use of multiple frames, though obviously only one is visible at a time in my xterm.  I use this regularly...can't even recall where it came from, though I didn't write it:  (defun nuke-trailing-whitespace () ""Nuke all trailing whitespace in the buffer.

I've already discussed how the Emacs end of the toolchain doesn't offer all the completions that it should; it completes maybe 50% of the stuff for C++ (simple projects) and it gets worse as the projects become more complex (different language bindings, lots of reliance on OOP properties).    But saying that only those IDEs are professional   For the developers of core Eclipse and Visual studios, it is their primary job and business product to produce working and robust features in these IDEs. For Emacs IDE features, it's community and volunteer driven."

Perhaps it's just your choice of words, but 'slapping' the return and it hurting your pinkie sounds like the problem is not where the keys are or the fact that it's your pinkie, but rather that you're too tense and using too much force.  Concentrate on relaxing your whole upper body all the way to your fingertips, and using a minimal amount of force for all typing.  But... perhaps I just won some genetic lottery and am way off base.  I've never suffered any hand problems from typing and never found emacs keys awkward or difficult.  e.g. people say M-x is awkward and yet I find it trivially easy and relaxed.  The closest thing to problems I've had is sore elbows from resting on bad chair arms.  Easily solved by not resting my elbows on arms.  Haven't had that in years."

emacs,35vmd9,ignaciothayer,1 point,Thu May 14 05:09:53 2015 UTC,"This is really impossible for the internet to answer.  Even if everyone was using the exact same keyboard (same size keys, same travel, same pressure, same layout, etc.), we'd all still have different hands (size, reach, finger length, strength, joint health, etc.) and practice.  There is no universally correct set of habits.  That said, if you know you're hitting the keys much harder than you need to, to get the keypress to register, you could work on a lighter touch.  Or try to find a keyboard with a longer key travel and a ""cushioning"" resistance; you don't want too soft, or you'll ""bottom-out"", and you don't want too hard, or you'll be encouraging your habit of excessive force.  (And the latter bit there does suggest one tip:  you don't need to bottom-out to get the key to register...many keyboards' keys will register half-way...and all you care about is that trigger, it's not necessary to bottom-out on a keypress.)  But in general, the only real advice here is to try a variety of keyboards, and practice the habits you want to maintain.  ""Habit makes a good servant, but a poor master.""  Keep in mind that any new (to you) keyboard is likely to feel awkward at first, just because it is new (to you).  So, give each at least a couple of hours of of use before making conclusions.  But in the end, the only reliable guide is your own personal experience."

I've always worried that my idea of cool is actually pretty lame. I just like my mini-buffer autocomplete working well; I like the ability to see all the symbols of a particular mode by typing M-: foobar- TAB, and if foobar-next-item is a function is has a little <f> next to it, so I don't see a need for added complexity there. I like that these naming conventions make any package easier to navigate, understand, alter or contribute to.  But anyway, let's not be dead serious about these things."
emacs,35kjmc,dddbbb,4,Mon May 11 11:23:46 2015 UTC,"Using smex and ido-flx will solve your minibuffer problems, not to mention are immensely more powerful than the standard minibuffer and tab completion."
emacs,35kjmc,tuhdo,3,Mon May 11 12:28:34 2015 UTC,"Spacemacs really seems to follow its own orbit, so more power to you brother!   This is a nice wording :-)  To be honest, now with all the tooling put in place in spacemacs we can more easily (it is not perfect) distinct the functions and the macros. It was not the case when I started.... unfortunately.  If the themes faces were different it would be a huge plus too."
emacs,35kjmc,tuhdo,1 point,Mon May 11 19:02:04 2015 UTC,"As for cool tricks, I'm not sure. I've always worried that my idea of cool is actually pretty lame.

I like that these naming conventions make any package easier to navigate, understand, alter or contribute to.   And is sub-optimal to other packages out there in term of Speed. Without all the cool packages from the community, no one can be productive with Emacs as compared with other tools. You can't blame people for that.  And the completion method you mention above is complexity. I am certain that any new user would find helm-M-x or smex vastly easier to use and offer superior efficiency."
emacs,35kjmc,schmidthuber,2,Mon May 11 13:00:14 2015 UTC,"I've been using Emacs for a few years now and I still very much consider myself a beginner. (Ideally, I think one ought to always consider themselves a beginner in all things, but that's another story.) I still find heml confusing, so the notion that a fresh green recruit would resolve their prefix confusion by installing/using helm... well I'm incredulous to say the least.  I was going to attribute this to a reverse of the Dunning–Kruger effect, but Wikipedia tells me this is called the ""curse of knowledge"":   The curse of knowledge is a cognitive bias that leads better-informed parties to find it extremely difficult to think about problems from the perspective of lesser-informed parties.   I bought a friend a Rasberry Pi for his birthday once. We spent a good part of an evening just covering cd ls and pwd."
emacs,35kjmc,instant_sunshine,2,Mon May 11 13:07:06 2015 UTC,"the notion that a fresh green recruit would resolve their prefix confusion by installing/using helm... well I'm incredulous to say the least.   FWIW, I'm new to emacs and I find helm easier because I don't know all the right prefixes but I can still search. If I understand correctly, Tab completion requires you to know the correct prefix, but helm's completion does not. So if I know I want to increment a number, I can search for increment even though I didn't know the package was called numerical. (My helm setup also makes it easy to invoke help from within M-x.)  However, your point about installing/configuring a new package is valid. I used spacemacs, so that wasn't too bad (on the other hand, I have no idea how to remove helm if I wanted to stop using it aside from dropping spacemacs entirely).  I can't claim to be free of the curse of knowledge because I've used tools that provide similar behavior (in Visual Studio and vim) and found them easier than alternatives too."
emacs,35kjmc,wasamasa,2,Tue May 12 02:23:22 2015 UTC,"Cool, welcome to the world of Emacs! (Abandon all hope ye who enter...)  Spacemacs is probably going to take over the world and soon I'll sound like an old man for using regular old GNU Emacs and whining about my prefixeses. My way of learning has always been to start with the most minimal thing possible and build up, but I'm probably in the minority, so I'm really glad Spacemacs is there for people who learn from the opposite end.  Unless you know the prefix, you'd type -inc (<space>inc) or *inc. The first is if you know the increment command has a prefix but you're not sure what it is, the second is if you want anything containing increment. The nonstandard prefixes interfere with the first behaviour.  Don't quote me but I think your .spacemacs file is where you enable/disable default packages."
emacs,35kjmc,wasamasa,1 point,Fri May 15 21:01:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip! That will help when helm stops working (occurred occasionally without a clear repro case).   Don't quote me but I think your .spacemacs file is where you enable/disable default packages.   I was referring to how spacemacs seems to be largely built around integration with helm and disabling helm might be like removing lisp from emacs. However, I'm probably wrong and helm just automatically hooks in to almost everything minibuffer."
emacs,35kjmc,instant_sunshine,2,Sat May 16 00:37:58 2015 UTC,"I still find heml confusing, so the notion that a fresh green recruit would resolve their prefix confusion by installing/using helm... well I'm incredulous to say the least.   Visual Studio also has something similar to Helm for searching file/code but more limited, and I found that people are happy with it. So I guess Helm is not so difficult to use. Actually, introducing Helm to people is much easier than anything else in Emacs. All I need to tell them is that when you type things, the screen shows something for you instantly, and if you want to search for more accurate results, just add more keywords, just like how you search in Google. Perfect analogy. And it works everywhere once Helm is enabled. How do you think Spacemacs become so popular in a short time? Without Helm, I doubt it can have that much success.  Now, compared with stock completion mechanism in Emacs. You have to tell people to press TAB; you have to tell them to enter commands in the precise order in which they have no knowledge of; you have to tell them how to separate command with a dash -; and this behaviour is applied for M-x only."
emacs,35kjmc,instant_sunshine,2,Mon May 18 20:10:54 2015 UTC,"I think this is a perfect example of the curse of knowledge. The assumption here is that the beginner already understands the concepts of elisp packages, how to install them, how to change the behaviour of Emacs, and the general idea that Emacs is a self-interpreting editor unlike, say, Microsoft Word. These are not simple things.  But also *cue dramatic music* I think your response speaks a bit towards what I see as an exclusionary culture of Emacs, e.g.  me:   I still find heml confusing   you:   I found that people are happy with it. So I guess Helm is not so difficult to use.   If I were a complete newcomer and confused about something, this would just turn me off.  I'm sure that using helm is as easy as you say (I've watched YouTube videos and it looks pretty friendly) but installing and getting it to work with everything is not. I had a look in my package archives and there are 134 available helm-related packages. A user with no prior Emacs experience is just going to think WTF.  Beginners need to find their way around the basics before they install new things because the things are arguably better or easier. If the only response is ""it's better, just trust me"" then I feel that's an arrogant approach to involving others.  One reason I love Emacs is that the technology itself is both open in the software licensing sense, but also in its philosophical underpinnings. I would love the culture surrounding it to follow suit."

emacs,35eoq3,__baxx__,19,Sat May 9 16:51:44 2015 UTC,"Before trying any of these, I recommend to switch to develop branch. Although it's develop branches, many improvements and bug fixes were applied.  1.1) In Spacemacs, you can toggle line number with these two hook functions:  (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'linum-mode) (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'linum-relative-toggle)   Add it to your dotspacemacs/config like this:  (defun dotspacemacs/config ()   (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'linum-mode)   (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'linum-relative-toggle)   ;; add more settings below from now on )   You can always toggle line number with SCP t n and linum relative with SPC t r. You must toggle SPC t n first before using SPC t r.  1.2) In Emacs, you don't have to worry if you use GUI Emacs. If you work in terminal, then simply press SPC j = after pasting to reindent your pasted text, since after you paste text Spacemacs highlights the pasted region. SPC j = indents a region if one is active or whole buffer if none is active.  2.0) You can do similar thing with Spacemacs layers. SPC f e h to list all available layers and C-c C-i to insert one into the current buffer. Search for the variable dotspacemacs-configuration-layers and add it like this:  dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(auto-completion                                        (git :variables                                             git-enable-github-support t                                             git-gutter-use-fringe t)                                        markdown                                        org                                        syntax-checking                                        better-defaults                                        emacs-lisp                                        c-c++                                        ;; add more layers below this line                                    )   2.1) Now, the first exercise for you:   Move cursor insde the list of dotspacemacs-configuration-layers above SPC f e h. Type ycmd C-c C-i to insert the selected candidate into current buffer(if you want to insert more layers, simply delete the ycmd currently in the prompt and simply move the highlighter to the layer name then continue pressing C-c Ci). SPC f e R to apply new configuration (in current master branch, it's C-c C-c).   Enjoy ycmd. Note that you also need to add auto-completion layer.  NOTE: You can jump to any function/variable in .spacemacs (and in most programming buffers in general) with SPC s l. Don't search manually.  3) Spelling: You can toggle on/off with SPC t s. In Spacemacs, it's on by default for non-programming buffers.  4)   "" turn off search highlight nnoremap <silent> <Leader>hl :nohlsearch<CR>   SPC s c to clear all search highlighting or :noh.   "" view buffers easily :nnoremap <leader>b :buffers<CR>:buffer<Space>   SPC b b and see a list of all buffers along with recently opened files. You can fuzzy matching it or precise matching it with by inserting a space at the end of a search string. You can insert more search strings, separated by space character.  4.1)   I have a script that runs a simple git add / commit / push. This enables me to run that from vim.   Add your ~/bin directory to the $PATH variable inside Emacs (and only inside Emacs):  (setenv ""PATH"" (concat ""~/bin:"" (getenv ""PATH"")))   Simply :!gitPush.py or :&gitPush.py for async shell command. Note that you can press tab to see a list of completion candidates.  4.2)    Vim sessions basically save all the buffers / files that were open so that one can open the session again and it'll have all the buffers ready to go.   Simply enable desktop-mode in Emacs to automatically save and restore working buffers next time:  (desktop-mode 1)    These just enable me to cycle through buffers easily,    In Spacemacs, SPC b n to go to next buffer and SPC b p for previous buffer. Note that it ignores non-programming buffers (i.e. shell buffers, document buffers... are ignored)  by default, but you can always customize.  5)   Getting to the .vimrc makes making changes / additions easy (and more likely)   SPC f e d to enter .spacemacs file. You can define your own in .spacemacs, in dotspacemacs/config function:  (evil-leader/set-key ""ev"" 'find-dotfile)   5.1)   Reload the edited vimrc from a current session nnoremap <leader>sv :source $MYVIMRC<cr>   SPC f e R  You can define your own in .spacemacs, in dotspacemacs/config function:  (evil-leader/set-key ""sv"" 'dotspacemacs/sync-configuration-layers)   5.2 & 5.3)   You can put this in your dotspacemacs/config function:  (define-key evil-normal-state-map ""H"" ""^"") (define-key evil-normal-state-map ""L"" ""$"")   5.5)   Add to your dotspacemacs/init function:  (setq-default evil-escape-key-sequence ""jf"")   6)   You don't have to do it manually. Install aspell and simply Spacemacs enables spell checking AND correcting.   (define-key evil-normal-state-map ""s"" 'flyspell-auto-correct-word)   Feel free to replace with any key you want. If you want Ctrl-<something> or Alt-<something>, use C-<key> or M-<key> for your mappings.  You can also use SPC S c to list all possible candidates to correct.  Python  The REPL is exposed to you through Emacs buffer. It means that you can use any plugin (i.e. code completion and Vim key bindings to edit in the REPL) in Emacs to write code in your REPL, not just the primitive REPL in your terminal.  Simply add python layer Python to use. Be sure to read the layer documentation. To read it, simply SPC f e h and press RET after you narrowed to Python.  Processing  You can checkout this Processing package.  Features according to binding listing:    Key Feature    C-c C-p r Run a sketch.   C-c C-p b Compile a sketch into .class files.   C-c C-p p Run a sketch full screen.   C-c C-p e Export sketch.   C-c C-p d Find in reference.   C-c C-p f Find or create sketch.   C-c C-p s Search in Processing forum.    Of course, you can bind to anything you want. It's a good to create a layer to practice your Elisp skill, and later contribute to Spacemacs. Press M-x, then narrow to this command configuration-layer/create-layer and create a layer. Follow the instructions in the command. You can visit Spacemacs gitter chatroom for consultant.  BONUS: if you use GUI Emacs, you can toggle transparency with SPC T T and see your sketch result while editing code.  Notes  For writing notes (and more), you have the awesome Org mode. Here is a simple Org tutorial. You can try with an Org buffer by simply SPC b b, type buffer_name.org (you must include .org to let Emacs know you want to create an Org buffer; buffer_name can be whatever name). You can open your TODOs (in Emacs, it's called agenda) anywhere.   If I'm writing a long post or email or whatever, I'll just use vim   Ok. Emacs has many email client. The simplest is Ctrl-x m and it opens a buffer for editing email. After done editing, you can press C-c C-s to open in the default email client of your system (i.e. thunderbird) to format and send.  That's it for now."

The problem is that Microsoft for some insane reason has decided that uuids don't have to be static, and can suddenly change. Basically what happened was that all of the servers folder uuids changed, so all mail I moved got deleted from the server and moved locally, but not put in a new folder on the server.  If you go for mbsync/isync how ever, note that you don't get IMAP-idle support, so you will have to poll (using crontab for example).

For example M-g g 100 RET is 7 key strokes. Assume avy-goto-line is bound to M-g l, then M-g l aa is 5 key strokes. Much shorter especially when you want to move around your visible screen, especially when the current line is over the range 1000. avy has integration with isearch-mode-map: in Isearch, you can press C-' to quickly jump to far away match on the screen. It's useful when you want to jump to an indentifier which has manay occurrences on visible screen. Instead of repeating C-s 10 times, you can just C-' and type one or two characters to jump there. avy has integration with links call ace-link (previously use ace-jump-mode but now it uses avy). On the visible screen, i.e. Info buffer, instead of TAB or S-TAB to move between links, you can simply use ace-link to jump to any link far away from point and enter that link with 3 or 4 key strokes instead of pressing TAB or C-s 5 times (after typing into the prompt 3 or 5 characters or more)."

Today, I added the option to exit swiper through avy with C-', which could be pretty cool because there's no need for the leading char.

emacs,35auys,EatMoreCrisps,2,Fri May 8 18:24:10 2015 UTC,"As I said, you don't use it for searching, but quickly jumping to a determined location on the screen. For example, while reading code I want to quickly jump to the text I am looking; the text is at near the bottom of the screen and point is at the top. Using Isearch is sub-optimal because I have to type fully the text my eyes are looking at which could be long, or I type it partially and leaving lots of matches to press C-s repeatedly many times. Of course, I can jump to a line and use Isearch but then it has problem when line number is big, and costs more key strokes anyway. With avy, I can bind ivy-goto-word-0 to a key like C-' (2 key strokes), and I have to type at most two characters more to jump to where my eyes are looking at.  If you do it with Isearch, you usually end up with 7 key strokes at best: C-s (2), partial string (3 at the minimum), C-s to move to next match (2 at the minimum). This is the ideal situation which rarely occurs."

emacs,35auys,tuhdo,1 point,Fri May 8 19:05:16 2015 UTC,"Still text more key strokes. You still have to hit RET to exit Isearch.  With avy I can jump to any character visible with 4 key strokes. It means, avy can jump across window boundary, as long as the character is visible on screen. Now, if you use Isearch, you have to press C-x o (another 3 key strokes at the minimum).  You also haven't accounted the cases where point is not on the symbol you want to search but something else i.e. whitespace. In such cases, the tricks above won't work. Perform movement commands and invoking Isearch simply requires more effort."
emacs,35auys,EatMoreCrisps,2,Fri May 8 19:13:46 2015 UTC,"Of course, yes, we're talking about navigation.  I don't think ace works at all for search.  For me it's not a keystroke count thing.  It's less important that ace uses fewer keys than that I have to make decisions based on unpredicted visual changes.  Much better for me to just type something I previously decided.  I wouldn't be surprised if these different techniques work better for different people, depending on how their mind works.  For me the best techniques are the ones that divert the least of my conscious brain and isearch wins over ace for that.  Typing words pretty much happens without interrupting my thought flow."

A 24GiB system should have plenty of space to cache any emacs files. Any open buffers are already in memory, and any previous visited data, including FS metadata like dirents, will be cached, too.   Your performance problems sound like a combination of two things. First, is poor behavior by your FS likely caused by bad fsync behavior or fragmentation. Using a more advanced file system or tuning your existing one should fix this issue. Second, is suboptimal caching behavior, particularly on initial access. Emacs is scanning through a large directory with lots of files to do various things, and that information isn't in cache. That's where you use something like the Linux preload daemon. It will automatically cache often used files. Add your .emacs.d directory to the mapprefix, and over time, preload will recognize and keep these files in the page cache.

To learn what parts of the standard library are useful, just look at the code of your favorite packages.  Second pointer, and this is just my personal preference: don't over-abstract. It's OK to first dump all the code in one function, and then see which parts, if any, are re-usable. Moreover, Elisp isn't super-optimized and the function call overhead can actually have an impact (only in cases of loops, of course, which you don't have at the moment)."

emacs,3599bd,otijhuis,3,Fri May 8 15:16:44 2015 UTC,"I think your impression of emacs by way of spacemacs, is likely influenced by the editor that you are coming from.  Are you used to an everything-in-a-box IDE?  I switched to spacemacs from vim. FWIW I found it easy to grok, and refreshing.  The layers, and configuration couldn't be more straight-forward."
emacs,3599bd,tuhdo,1 point,Fri May 8 04:35:55 2015 UTC,"The expectation for immediate reward/satisfaction is simply higher when learning emacs than when learning Vim/Textmate/Sublime/IDEs,  because often time a spacemacs newbie is actually already a power users in Vim/IDEs.   I started using Vim 7 years ago, at that time I just wanted to be able to edit simple files quickly on remote servers.  The difference between initial expectations of learning other editors and learning Emacs is huge."
emacs,3599bd,otijhuis,2,Fri May 8 04:54:17 2015 UTC,"The difference between expectations of learning Vim and learning Emacs is huge.   I disagree.  Vim has a high learning curve (for high reward).  One can't just jump in, and use vim, you have to learn modes, and navigation on the home row.  Stock emacs has it's learning curve as well, but I think it does a better job of out-of-the-box approachability than vim."
emacs,3599bd,tuhdo,2,Fri May 8 05:02:25 2015 UTC,"nowadays developers (especially the ones who think about learning emacs) have to write in 5 or more programming languages/markups/template languages. Adding frameworks to the mix, their editor has to be very smart in so many situations to be counted as usable. I think this is the top reason many vim users are exploring other options.   So if most people have to set up these common features immediately after installation, why not do it for them by default, and give instructions on how to remove pieces if they choose to do so."
emacs,3599bd,syl20bnr,3,Fri May 8 06:48:29 2015 UTC,"I would argue that enabling everything by default actually hinders the learning process. You never know what other options there are because you haven't looked into them. Disabling things may seem easier but I assure you it isn't. An Emacs configuration with everything enabled would be extremely large. It would include lots of packages, each with their own configuration options. When you don't know which package or option causes certain behaviour, how can you change it? Providing documentation for all the possible options and combinations would be impossible. There are just too many. Also, why would a newcomer turn something off when they don't even know it's enabled? They wouldn't.  Configurations like spacemacs and prelude are often referred to as starter kits. This gives the impression that they are great for people new to Emacs. But try to look at them as how to's or configuration learning kits. They contain a wealth of information, even for experienced Emacs users. From how to structure your configuration to configuring and integrating certain packages. They are a great starting point and I regularly check them out to see if they contain something I want to use. The hardest parts of Emacs are learning how to configure it properly and finding out which packages fit your personal workflow. Study the kits, check melpa for packages. Find out what works for you. Yes, it's overwhelming initially. I know, I've been there. But once you've done that Emacs becomes easy. Shortcuts, preferences...everything will be configured the way you prefer.  Unlike most editors, Emacs is basically an ""build your own editor"" environment. Don't pick a ""starter"" kit because you believe it's easier. Pick it because it works the way you want and contains the packages you like. Embrace the fact that Emacs is different. Most people talk about learning Emacs when they really should be focused on telling Emacs how it should work. That's why I would never recommend Emacs to someone who hasn't used quite a few other editors and doesn't know their own preferences/workflow. It's completely different for each individual."
emacs,3599bd,otijhuis,2,Fri May 8 13:34:54 2015 UTC,"Having an Emacs with sane Elisp configuration is a great starting point to write Elisp. Build your own editor is great, but just not reinventing the wheel. Instead of spending time configuring the same thing over and over again, why not spending time write a new package that no one ever solves before? Spacemacs users are able to contribute code after a week of regular usage. evil-cleverparens is a package of a Spacemacs user who switched from Vim.  Btw, build your own editor is not that great. It's things like setq something, load code manually or install from MELPA, then paste configuration. I don't see much value in that process anymore."
emacs,3599bd,lawlist,1 point,Fri May 8 14:37:01 2015 UTC,"I'm all for a sane elisp configuration. The Emacs defaults are terrible in a lot of cases. Providing a good foundation is very important. But there's a big difference between sane defaults and installing all kinds of packages by default.  Nobody is talking about reinventing the wheel. I'm not configuring the same thing over and over. I configure it the way I prefer. Build your own editor doesn't mean reimplementing all functionalities again. It means being aware of the packages you install and the options you choose. Not blindly enabling things. Doesn't matter if you use spacemacs, prelude, or start from scratch.  All I am saying is, be aware of the fact that when you enable something in starter kits, a lot of it is based on the creator's preferences. You might love it, you might hate it. Make it your own, customise it. Dive into the configuration, learn how it works. Invest the time. It will be worth it."
emacs,3599bd,tuhdo,2,Fri May 8 18:36:53 2015 UTC,"Spacemacs is not a personal matter anymore. It's community configured and reviewed, so usually the configurations are globally optimized for most people. For example, see the pull requests created by the community. Spacemacs can be tweaked with personal layer to fit your liking. A lot of problems with the integration between packages was solved thanks to the community spotting, fixing and testing it. For example, this is my PR to solve the Helm problem with popwin. Anyone used Helm and popwin together is well aware of this issue.  The layers are fantastic. No more I have to read pages of manual to set things up. I can just add a layer and try it with all the awesome community packages without manually pasting Lisp code myself. For an Emacs newbie, there's a huge different between opening up an editor and try the awesomeness of Helm and Projectile and Magit and Company. A new user can enjoy a well-configured org-mode like this out of the box. (original image from this twitter post).  And you don't blindly enable anything. Layers in Spacemacs are modular and you add it or don't. If you don't like any built-in package, you can even exclude it with the variable dotspacemacs-excluded-packages. That's said, many built-in packages are simple productivity enhancers that stock Emacs could not provide."
emacs,3599bd,aptmnt_,1 point,Fri May 8 18:58:20 2015 UTC,"Regarding 'disabling things', please see my replay to hyperbling. In short, if a user doesn't know a particular feature and has no desire to search for it, then that feature does not exist in this user's mind, so there is no need to disable it.   Also, there are numerous built-in features in Vim, enabled by default. This never prevents users to install new and better alternatives. It's the same for the 'fat' version of Spacemacs.  I totally agree with your statements:  ""try to look at them (spacemacs) as how to's or configuration learning kits. They contain a wealth of information, even for experienced Emacs users. From how to structure your configuration to configuring and integrating certain packages. ""  So for this ""configuration learning kits"" to work well, the kits itself (not some where in the Internet to be discovered) should provide lots of easy to digest materials for people to learn, right?

I think this is compatible with what you seek, you want everything enabled and then be able to disable some feature. This is what an exhaustive dotfile fully documented gives you.  I'm a bit confused about what you really want.  If you want everything, just add 'all to the list of layers and restart Spacemacs.  If you need help to discover this, say hello on the gitter chat."
emacs,3599bd,syl20bnr,1 point,Fri May 8 14:21:51 2015 UTC,"I understand where you are coming from. I'm not against saner defaults, especially for features that are built-in. Those are easy to override and normally don't get in the way. There are a lot of 3rd party packages though that have a global effect. They can substantially change the way Emacs behaves. And because the effects are global it can be extremely hard to figure out the cause of that specific behaviour.  In the end it's extremely hard to please everyone. Personally I prefer a very basic foundation and the option to enable what I need. Some people prefer working backwards. As long as you end up with something you love to work with it doesn't matter. I'm very grateful for all the time people put in those starter kits. I've learned more from those than anything else."
emacs,3599bd,hyperbling,4,Fri May 8 17:50:29 2015 UTC,"There are a substantial number of seasoned Emacs users who would recommend that newbies start with zero configuration and add new configurations one by one (instead of using a starter package).

emacs,3599bd,__baxx__,2,Fri May 8 07:24:41 2015 UTC,"By default Spacemacs already includes a lot of general purpose packages. For speicfic features, you need to add each ""feature"" (aka layer) to dotspacemacs-configuration-layers i.e. if you want Python, open Spacemacs. SPC f e d and add it.

Reaching 30fps at this low resolution did work (higher resolution dipped below 25fps and started stuttering), however I doubt you can either add synchronous sound playback (for starters, the Emacs sound support blocks the UI while playing and is therefore not usable) or decode frames on the fly and fast enough like an actual video player would do.

emacs,350g4r,wadcann,2,Wed May 6 15:25:51 2015 UTC,"I don't know of a reasonable way to do this short of extending emacs (emacs doesn't support setting up a 3d overlay over its windows AFAIK) aside from just-to-prove-that-it's-possible approaches like running mplayer -vo aa or -vo caca to generate text output in an ansi-term.  However...could you clarify what it is that your goal is by putting the movie in the window?  emms is not, itself, a movie player/decoder; it's more of a playlist manager, and will always invoke an external program.  Generally-speaking, I don't want the movie in the window, because I usually want it fullscreen.  Is the concern that you want to use it in part of your window and you use emacs to do ""window management"", or that you're running many emacs instances with many emmses and you're having trouble tying together the media player window with the controlling emms, or what?"
emacs,350g4r,wadcann,1 point,Wed May 6 06:06:32 2015 UTC,"definitely more of a window management standpoint. I use xmonad and I like tiling  WMs but since I really only use emacs in fullscreen, I thought it would be cool to have the video playing inside an emacs window instead of an outside program. I thought perhaps there could be a hack to make the  external video player just sit on top of a window in emacs and match its sizing"
emacs,350g4r,angelic_sedition,3,Wed May 6 15:24:28 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see, that does make more sense.  No, sorry, I don't know of a great way to do that, though I do think that you might prefer to use a true window manager more, just because there's a family of windowed applications that most people use to some degree (web browser being foremost among them; emacs-based web browsers aren't terribly competitive with the Firefox/Chromium/IE/Safari/etc group).  I don't believe that anyone has tried writing a window manager for emacs itself, though theoretically that would be possible.  Also, if you're not familiar with it, you might look at stumpwm, which is Lisp-based and more emacsy than xmonad."
emacs,350g4r,Ubertekk,1 point,Wed May 6 15:41:47 2015 UTC,"hmmm, thanks for the input i might try that wm, but I like haskell alot and have spent a good amount of time configuring that already.  the main reason I wanted it inside of emacs is because with any tiling wm, you cant really have a video in the corner and have emacs take up the rest of the screen which would be an ideal set up. I suppose if I just get a bigger screen I could make it work by having enough space for emacs on one tile and the second tile can be split between the movie player as well as some other program.   And yea, web browsing and video playing are really the only things that cant be done in emacs that I do regularly."

If customization settings need to be saved, save them in ~/.emacs.d/init.el if it exists. If it doesn't exist, save in ~/.emacs   In any case, it's not really the behavior I'd expect based on what I've read, but it's not a big deal either."

emacs,34jusp,RobThorpe,1 point,Sat May 2 10:58:12 2015 UTC,"I'll explain why I think this....  The starter packages come in two types.  Firstly, there are things like ""better defaults"", which was very simple.  In that case it's probably better to just read the better-defaults.el on the internet and nick the settings you like.  Secondly, there are the bigger startup packages like Prelude which change a lot more stuff.  Those have several problems in my opinion:   The Emacs manual is written for default Emacs. Suppose you read something in the manual, then apply it, and it doesn't work as expected. That could be because the defaults package changes how it works, or it could be because of a bug in Emacs. You can't tell without checking with emacs -q. Replies on mailing lists and forums are generally written assuming vanilla Emacs. This is the same sort of problem as above, people like me often write key sequences that assume vanilla Emacs. If you don't use vanilla Emacs you've often got to translate those yourself. Using lots of 3rd-party packages introduces a maintenance problem. Some of the authors give up on their packages. Sometimes changes in Emacs make those packages no longer compatible with the current Emacs version. Then you have to stop using it or find a replacement. This problem could apply to any of the packages that the default set loads in. If you have several computers you use regularly then any changes need applying to all of them.  The big, successful packages, like Magit, Company and Yasnippet will always be be maintained, it's the little ones that are the problem. So why not just install the major ones and save yourself the hassle? What about using other people's computers? If Emacs is on them then it can be useful to use it, but you have to know how to use vanilla Emacs.  I think the OP understand this problem. Many of the big default packages make some weird decisions. Take Emacs Prelude. It binds C-x m to M-x shell. Usually C-x m is message mode for sending mail. Sending mail is a very useful feature of Emacs, there's no reason to discourage it's use. (Of course M-x shell is a very useful feature too and it or term should have a keybinding). Then there's the fact that prelude-mode binds almost everything in the C-c KEY keymap. That keymap is reserved for users. Over time most users will find things of their own that they want in that keymap. Keybindings that are created by the user for his or her own private use cases are often the most useful."

Using lots of 3rd-party packages introduces a maintenance problem. Some of the authors give up on their packages.    It's true, but I trust Emacs backward compatibility. I ran some Emacs code unmaintained from Emacs 23 (or even 22) and it worked without any problem.   Then you have to stop using it or find a replacement   Or people can just add a minor compatibility change without throwing the whole package. The fact that a user has to find a replacement which means there's a valid need that stock Emacs cannot provide.   What about using other people's computers? If Emacs is on them then it can be useful to use it, but you have to know how to use vanilla Emacs. I think the OP understand this problem.   Then, that's the case with customizing your own vanilla Emacs, especially if you write your own stuffs to handle your own use case. Of course, learning stock Emacs is useful for situation like this but it's not a valid reason to avoid external packages.   Many of the big default packages make some weird decisions.

You can think it the other way around: instead of users have to bind those C-c <key> themselves, Prelude already did it. If they don't like anything, they can just rebind. Prelude just provides a convenient way for utmost new users to try out Emacs features (both internal and external) before they know what they actually need."

I think most Emacs starter kits and external packages preserve default key bindings, except for some esoteric features that no new users would use it anyway.   No they don't.  ""Better defaults"" is the simplest starter kit, it's only a couple of pages of code.  Even it rebinds C-s and C-r, it makes them regex searches and makes C-M-s and C-M-r the regular variants (""Emacs-starter-kit"" does the same).  Prelude-mode doesn't alter much, but think about how confusing this is: it changes C-M-\ to mean ""Indent region (if selected) or the entire buffer"".   The users can still ask the author(s) of the starter kits and even join the community (i.e. Spacemacs gitter chatroom) to get support. Emacs mailing list is not the only way, and it could be worse because many people there probably don't use external (useful) packages.   Even here on Reddit replies generally use the assumption of vanilla Emacs.  If a user says ""I'm using X starter kit"" often the replies ignore that.  On Stackexchange vanilla Emacs is assumed too, 90% of the time it makes no difference of-course.  If questions are posted that are too far off the beaten track then often there are no good replies.  Neither Reddit, Stackexchange or help-gnu-emacs are big communities, I can't imagine that the starter kits have bigger communities.

Emacs mailing list is not the only way, and it could be worse because many people there probably don't use external (useful) packages.   I've had problems in the past, I have a few modes I wrote for Emacs 22 that don't work now.  Also, one of the problems that's arisen recently is dependencies.  Often packages rely on other packages, there's nothing wrong with that it can be good for modularity.  The problem comes if one package depends on version A of package X and another package depends on version B of package X.   Or people can just add a minor compatibility change without throwing the whole package.   Perhaps there's an easy way to make something work, but not always.   The fact that a user has to find a replacement which means there's a valid need that stock Emacs cannot provide.   It can still be a problem if the package that lasts works in a completely different way to the one you've chosen.  It's the nature of text editing that there are few ""needs"" and many wants.  Notepad is a text editor.  Things don't get replaced if others no longer believe that a problem is there.  There are fashions, features are considered ""essential"" for a while, a lot of code is written for them, some of which stays around.  Then people move on to the next ""essential"" thing and the process starts again.  The fashions aren't entirely arbitrary, often they come from other editors and IDEs.  For example, lots of people these days are accustomed to fixed window layouts.  Also lots of people switch tasks often, so we have lots of packages for those things that at present.  Slick demos in other editors encourage people to copy features into Emacs too.   Then, that's the case with customizing your own vanilla Emacs, especially if you write your own stuffs to handle your own use case. Of course, learning stock Emacs is useful for situation like this but it's not a valid reason to avoid external packages.   But with a starter kit how do you know where Emacs ends and where external packages begin?  Just knowing where that line is is very useful.   You can think it the other way around: instead of users have to bind those C-c <key> themselves, Prelude already did it. If they don't like anything, they can just rebind. Prelude just provides a convenient way for utmost new users to try out Emacs features (both internal and external) before they know what they actually need.   I'm sure you know how difficult it is to unlearn a keybinding after you've learned it, that's part of the problem.  I also don't think that newbies will be confident about rebinding.  We know the line between Emacs and the starter kits.  That means we know that rebinding C-c <key> is generally no problem.  We also know that rebinding things in the C-x keymap can be a bit troublesome because different modes use it for different things.  For example, C-x C-q isn't very useful in normal editing, but it's very useful in Dired.  The same could be said about the C-c C-<key> keymap.  Newbies won't necessarily get that."

emacs,34meba,kcin,4,Mon May 4 18:45:06 2015 UTC,"Part of the reason for C-x is that it's treated as one character by the keyboard. The next thing is treated as a second character. So, that second character can be anything. It can be a character by itself, like d or it can be C-d or M-d.  ""C-x"" and in-fact C-anything is treated as one character and some terminals use some of those characters for internal purposes. That's why on most terminal emulators even today you can't use C-' & C-#. So, C-something is restricted, but C-x something is not. On modern terminals Alt is sent as a separate character, so it doesn't have that problem that Ctrl has. However, on the systems the original Emacs was written on keyboard characters were 9-bits and Alt worked the same way as Ctrl and had similar limitations.  This is described in the manual for TECO Emacs if anyone is interested."

emacs,33zaq5,wasabichicken,1 point,Mon Apr 27 07:56:13 2015 UTC,"That's fair enough. :) I just find doc-view pretty adequate for moving around the output, and being able to easily windmove to it is nice. Also regarding errors, really do try auctex' compile error reporting if you haven't already. It's significantly better than plain pdflatex output for me, with coloring, suggestions, and being able to view the errors separately."
emacs,33zaq5,AnalysisSitus,2,Mon Apr 27 08:01:07 2015 UTC,Could you write a quick note about how you enable/use doc-view and the error reporting from auctex? I'm not sure how to enable it or use it.
emacs,33zaq5,great_bushybeard,1 point,Mon Apr 27 09:53:36 2015 UTC,"Sure! doc-view should be enabled in newer versions of emacs. To use it, just open a .pdf-file in a buffer. If it's not rendered after a few moments, it might not be in view mode, but in edit mode. If so, tap C-c C-c to toggle it. At times you need to toggle it back and forth. As you can tell, I'm not really an expert on why. Once it renders, however, you can navigate using arrow keys (there is probably a better way, but this is what I use), and go to next or previous page using n/p. If you want to go to a specific page, use M-g M-g (or M-g g - it's the same shortcut as ""go to line"" in plain emacs) , enter the page number and press enter.  The one thing which you probably want to configure if you use doc-view to keep track of LaTeX output is that out of the box, doc-view doesn't ""track"" changes in the document. That is, if you edit your document and recompile it, you'd need to reload it (can be done through C-c C-c twice, or by actually killing and reopening the buffer) to actually see those changes.  Of course, that's painful, so you can turn on what is called auto-revert-mode, which tells emacs to reload buffers whenever they change on disk. You can do this for all kinds of buffers, but it's perhaps most relevant here. To enable it, use M-x auto-revert-mode in your doc-view buffer. That turns it on (well, toggles it on/off) for that particular buffer, so when you recompile your file, it will reload. If you want to avoid having to type it every time, put the following in your init.el:   (add-hook 'doc-view-mode-hook 'auto-revert-mode)   This enables auto-revert-mode for all doc-view buffers.  As to auctex error reporting, I haven't used it enough to say for sure, but here is my best shot. Once you have auctex installed, typing C-c C-c you get to enter a command. Type ""LaTeX"". This compiles the document for you, and the minibuffer will tell you if that went well or not. If there are errors, it will say ""LaTeX errors in <your file>. Use C-c to display."" If so, C-c will open a new buffer with that error displayed in a readable way, as well as (sometimes) a piece of advice on what might cause it. If there are several errors, you can use the command again to go to the next error. (You do need to use the command in your LaTeX buffer every time, though.)  One thing to note is that for some people, emacs hates using the key as a shortcut. If typing C-c only leaves you with the minibuffer reading ""C-c S-dead-grave-"", hitting space will ""complete"" the `, executing the command. It was kind of a pain to keep doing this, though, so you can bind some key to the function TeX-next-error and use that binding instead if you want. If this is not a problem for you, of course, you can ignore this paragraph.  I hope this clear things up!"

This is great for a single file latex document (since it can't handle master files). It splits the emacs window and automatically updates the doc-view when you change the file. It also marks compilation errors (One can do this manually, but this mode sets it up automatically). TeX-source-correlate-mode  and TeX-evince-sync-mode. If you use those two, you can do a Ctrl click in the evince-pdf file and your pointer will jump to the point in the source file in emacs. When you compile you'll see a red frame  in the pdf around the current position of the pointer.   The best for me would be a pane mode that can deal with master files and more importantly the syncing is awesome when you review a document."

It does a surprisingly nice job at converting to docx format on those occasions when you need to share a Word file.  A couple other tips…  First, if you use biblatex for bibliographies, you'll need to use pandoc's command-line flags to makes sure your references get included in the docx file.  This example from StackExchange is a handy illustration:  pandoc -o test.docx test.tex --bibliography References.bibtex --csl apa5.csl   You'd replace References.bibtex with your bibtex/biblatex references file and 'apa5.csl' with the path to the CSL file containing the reference style you want. You can download the CSL file for just about any bibliographic style you can imagine from Zotero's style repository.  Second, if you're viewing the PDF output of your LaTeX outside of Emacs, as opposed to in an Emacs buffer, Skim is the Mac PDF program I've found that does the best job of automatically detecting each time you export changes to the PDF file and re-displaying the updated contents."

You'll pretty quickly end up with dozen or so that you use a lot and just include nearly everywhere, but you'll never really get past the point of occasionally browsing CTAN looking for some very specific thing you haven't needed before.  One other tip: use xelatex instead of latex or pdflatex.

A typewriter enforces a slower pace of moving through a sentence, which, for me at least, allows a more consistent flow of writing.

I understand people saying that starting from scratch is a good way to learn Emacs but it does not imply that it is a better way. If you want concrete material just look at how many contributions have been merged in Spacemacs and look for @spacemacs account on Twitter for testimonies of elisp beginners contributing to the project. In practice Spacemacs is an excellent and efficient way to learn Emacs and elisp. You can also join the 600+ people that have already joined the gitter chat for good support about Spacemacs.  I cannot see how starting from scratch can be more efficient than Spacemacs. There so many content united around a strong framework. It would take several man month to get there.

When it comes to emacs, there really are no right answers.  It's possible that by switching between the two you are preventing yourself from learning both, but I personally wouldn't be too concerned about it.  You can try forcing yourself to stick with one for a while. Flip a coin, do a pro/con list, or just go with what feels right. But if you're worried about spacemacs not really being emacs, you can stop worrying.  Once you learn how to learn emacs, and how to explore emacs through its help system, even if you don't like spacemacs or plain emacs in the end, you will be able to find what pieces of both that you like, and mix them together into your own configuration."

You will have to stay within a subset of packages, as all the defaults are going to follow Emacs conventions.  Personally, I generally recommend learning Emacs as it is, and then adding what you want later.  There's a lot of benefit in knowing the thing inside and out.  The analogy of ""you don't need to be a mechanic to drive a car"" really doesn't hold too much water relative to Emacs.  The major benefit of using a platform like this, is to master it."

The level of abstraction is higher, I think.    I would like to migrate from evil to straight Emacs because a lot of packages don't work well with evil, and stuff like org-mode would be better with Emacs bindings.    I've also noticed that even while using evil mode, you still have to use a lot of chords if you're interested in adding new functions (which maybe coming from Vim, you're not), because there aren't enough single keys to do everything with one key.  So there you go. Key chords aren't going away.   I'd advise against learning vim inside emacs.  Just learn emacs, it's easier."

And coming from Vim makes it even more appealing.  But I also feel intimidated by it. It sets up so many things that I don't even know where to start. If something doesn't work I don't know where to ask for help. After drooling over Spacemacs for 2 days, I decided that I'll stay with my minimal Emacs setup until I will feel comfortable enough to look into a more complex setup like Spacemacs.

There's a classic point of confusion regarding terminology here, so I want to make sure we're on the same page—Emacs uses the term ""frame"" to refer to what modern OSes call ""windows""; and in Emacs speak, ""window"" means a split inside of a frame such that multiple buffers are visible. Continuing with that terminology...  If you actually want two frame set-ups (one for LaTeX, and one for Python), then stock Emacs should have you covered: C-x 5 2 (make-frame-command) will get you a second frame, C-x 2 (split-window-below) will add the second Python window, and you can use C-x 5 o (other-frame) to switch back and forth between the LaTeX and Python frames. (Protip for OS X users who use CMD as Meta: bind M-<backtick> to other-frame and Emacs will match the system convention of using CMD-<backtick> to cycle between an app's windows).  If you actually want two window set-ups, winner-mode (as /u/OvidNaso mentioned) is pretty great as it dynamically maintains a history of window changes, but I suspect you can achieve exactly what you want with C-x r w (window-configuration-to-register); simply get things set up how you want and then run that command providing some character to name the register—let's say ""a""—and then you can restore that configuration at any time with C-x r j a (jump-to-register— a). So just save the two different window configurations to different registers. You could probably also pair that with desktop-mode and have the registers already assigned at start up time.  Hope that helps!"

That's right, I wished for the good parts of popwin and did rectify a few of its defaults (like, it always aligning windows and selecting them by default) while I was at it. shackle does not manage windows.

emacs,33ndx1,jhirn,3,Fri Apr 24 00:55:51 2015 UTC,"I had a patch accepted to Win32 emacs in late 2013 (before the move to git), and I used a git mirror for the whole thing. It didn't seem to be a problem - I used git to make a patch against what was then the git head, mentioned this was the case, and... that was that. Assuming the mirror is no more than a day or two behind, a patch against its head will likely apply cleanly to the head of the main repo.  I was sceptical then - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8603853 ;) - and I remain sceptical now. A move to git may well represent an improvement in workflow for regular maintainers, but I don't believe it will do a thing in terms of encouraging people to contribute.  Encouraging people to contribute is not a version control problem, and turning a random one-off patch into something that can be added to a long-running project is not a version control problem. I'm not sure why people think that changing version control will make a difference here.

emacs,33ndx1,RobThorpe,5,Fri Apr 24 16:02:23 2015 UTC,That makes no sense.  Surely a commonly used operation like this would have a simple command?
emacs,33ndx1,tuhdo,4,Fri Apr 24 02:36:35 2015 UTC,"git revert is for reverting changes in your commits. i.e. I had a commit but turned out it is causing trouble, I just git revert <commit_hash>. You can even revert part of a commit.  To remove an unwanted change, simply git checkout <file> to get back the original state of the file. Is it easy?"
emacs,33ndx1,RobThorpe,3,Fri Apr 24 06:16:53 2015 UTC,The point is that to remove all changes you need something like:   git reset --hard HEAD

emacs,33ndx1,xoo-,4,Fri Apr 24 10:11:43 2015 UTC,"the problem with it is that ""git reset --hard HEAD"" does what everyone sane in the world wants ""git revert"" to be.   for example, hg revert does revert.   what do you suspect ""hg revert --clean"" does?"
emacs,33ndx1,tuhdo,4,Fri Apr 24 13:06:27 2015 UTC,"It's just terminology things. If I want to reset to the whole repo to its original commit, I use git reset --hard <commit>. If I want to undo a file, I use git checkout <file>. I think reset is as a good word as revert. On the other hand, revert in git is for creating changes in files that undos your past changes i.e. in earlier commit (i.e. 5 commits away from current commit), you add a for loop and this is causing strange bug. git revert can undo that change: it creates a new change that removes that for loop in your file, and only that piece of code not the whole code in the commit.   If you use magit, this process is very easy and straight forward:   Open magit-log. Navigate to a commit and press RET to open it. In the commit buffer, find a patch you want to undo and press v. Now you have the undo and magit shows it immediately."
emacs,33ndx1,RobThorpe,2,Fri Apr 24 13:44:24 2015 UTC,It's an obscure command for a common operation.
emacs,33ndx1,IvanMalison,1 point,Fri Apr 24 10:32:34 2015 UTC,"What is obscure about it. You don't know git very well if you don't understand what reset does, or why the --hard flag is needed, and the other argument is a pointer to the commit to reset to."

Or may be it's the git workflow which is different from your usual VCS."
emacs,33ndx1,RobThorpe,1 point,Sun Apr 26 08:52:59 2015 UTC,"I generally agree.   a) losing changes shouldn't be done with a simple command; we've all heard of ""rm temp *"" fiascos.   Yes, but the tool could ask after the command.   b) Parla's suggestion, ""git stash create"", has the advantage of being reversible   Yes, but if you need to revert then you still have to do that after the stash, don't you?  Stashing doesn't do it for you. My point is about the trickiness of reverting.   c) ... I don't find this operation as common as you say.   It's not that common, and I make big mistakes.  That said, it has it's uses. Let's say you were a maintainer and you were emailed several patchs for different features. You could create a sandbox taken from origin/master (the tip of head/trunk on the central repo). Then you could apply the patch and see what happens, then revert all the changes and try another patch."
emacs,33ndx1,astrobe,1 point,Sun Apr 26 20:17:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, but if you need to revert then you still have to do that after the stash, don't you? Stashing doesn't do it for you. My point is about the trickiness of reverting.   If we're talking about changes you made on your working tree, no. stashing sort of consists in making a commit of your local changes but on a separate list, and then to come back to the state of your last ""official"" commit.  For changes that already have been committed, see git-rebase below.   It's not that common, and I make big mistakes.   Actually, I had to do that a few times, mainly during big merges with tricky conflicts. When I botch it, I just lookup the short log and do a ""git reset --hard <commit before the merge>"". Also, when I anticipate difficulties, or when I'm going to do some voodoo with unfamiliar git commands, I make a backup of the whole thing (including the hidden .git directory) just in case I mess up really badly with the commit history.  Also, I think the git-rebase command sort of supports your scenario: it lets you pick/exclude commits in a list, rearrange, reword and merge them. But I only used it for the latter operations though."
emacs,33ndx1,xoo-,1 point,Mon Apr 27 00:32:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, exactly. Why isn't this like one of the top 3 existing commands already? Does nobody besides me ever decide ""this is stupid, just undo it all""? I feel like git must want to work a different way than me."

Being familiar with Git's internals, it makes sense to me why the command is what it is.  But I think that's the crux of all the fair criticism towards Git for its interface: it assumes you know what's happening on the lower levels.  For people that don't want to learn that stuff (and I wouldn't blame anyone for that) then Git is often a pain in the ass."
emacs,33ndx1,sabof,0,Fri Apr 24 01:59:11 2015 UTC,"At work, we have a lot of ""reset hard"" directions when dealing with things.

emacs,33ndx1,ChiefEmann,2,Fri Apr 24 03:49:26 2015 UTC,"Yes. As ""to3m"" mentions, most new contributors give patches, they don't commit to the VC system directly, so it's not at all surprising that nothing has changed.  Change depends more on the number of people allowed to commit directly than anything else. (And in Emacs there are a lot of people who can do that, more than in other large projects). We'll see if anything changes in the future.  Personally I'd prefer Subversion to anything else, but that's because I'm used to it."
emacs,33ndx1,trezor2,2,Fri Apr 24 02:44:40 2015 UTC,"I've been meaning to try contributing, once my work schedule lifted.  As a general rule though, VC is not a deciding factor over what projects I contribute on."
emacs,33ndx1,bastibe,2,Fri Apr 24 18:05:27 2015 UTC,"I think one thing reducing the number of potential contributors are the ""hard"" and ""arcane"" requirements set for new contributors to get patches considered and approved.  You have to sign copyright forms, you have to send emails, you have to sign up for mailling-lists, find the right groups, then apply for group-memberships, then contact a mailing list, defend your ""bug"" left and wait for responses and maybe sometime in the future provide a patch etc etc. It lacks a certain flow.  On github, for any project, even Microsoft's, you fork, hack and submit a PR. Done. You have an audience, you have backwards traceability without need to sign up to mailing lists in advance, you can yourself decide what issues you want to pay attention to, etc etc. Being a developer is not an all or nothing sort of thing.  Microsoft has this contributor agreement you have to sign for larger patches, but it's all done online and in seconds.  It flows, is visual and feels modern and efficient.  Anyone who has looked into a controversial Emacs patch or issue from the outside can tell which workflow and system they would rather use.  I'm not saying Emacs should move to github (as I don't believe that would ever happen) but they need to make the contribution process feel smoother. Adopting git was a good start. But it's not sufficient."

So you highlight your javascript, call #'narrow-to-region, then turn on #'js2-mode. No html will mess up js2-mode while you work on the javascript section of the file.  When you're done call #'widen. Then turn #'web-mode back on.   I use helper functions to automate the process of highlighting text between <script> or <style> tags; invoking/restoring modes as you narrow and widen.  You can combine #'narrow-to-region with indirect buffers. This will allow you to narrow several regions into different buffers with different modes active in each, but all saving to the same file. The drawback is the font effects are shared by all of these buffers, so mulitple modes lose their value with regards to font effects.

Here, ~/ stands for your home directory.    [...]   There can also be a default init file, which is the library named default.el, found via the standard search path for libraries. The Emacs distribution contains no such library; your site may create one for local customizations. If this library exists, it is loaded whenever you start Emacs (except when you specify ‘-q’). But your init file, if any, is loaded first; if it sets inhibit-default-init non-nil, then default is not loaded.   [...]   Your site may also have a site startup file; this is named site-start.el, if it exists. Like default.el, Emacs finds this file via the standard search path for Lisp libraries. Emacs loads this library before it loads your init file. To inhibit loading of this library, use the option ‘--no-site-file’.   So it goes site-start.el, your config and then default.el.  However, all I care about (and you probably too) is my init file, for which I use ~/.emacs.d/init.el since I don't want ~ to be cluttered and I have emacs.d anyway.  Now you can also use init.el to load other files, which means you can also split up your initialization into different files.  I have done some of this, putting split-files into ~/.emacs.d/mystuff, with one file for utility functions (myutil.el) and a few others for what amounts to ""emacs applications"" - this includes mu4e (in ""mymail.el"") and orgmode (in ""myorg.el""). Other people opt to configure each major mode in its own file, but I don't see the use in splitting out three lines."
emacs,33kqal,hirnbrot,3,Thu Apr 23 09:11:46 2015 UTC,"Just adding on to this, addressing OP...  Organization is usually pretty idiosyncratic and the emacs philosophy encourages that.  There is no ""usual way"" to organize these files; each user organizes things in the way that makes the most sense for themselves.  And frankly, as a newbie, it's probably a bit silly to worry about organization, just starting out.  Because you are either not going to have very much to organize (initially), or you'll have likely cribbed it from a more experienced user (along with their organization).  And if you stick with emacs, re-organizing your initialization is a periodic ritual for most users anyway...and after you've been using emacs for a while, you'll have a better idea of what you want in your own organization.  If you're looking for suggestions for that, here's a thread from 3 months ago:  http://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/2qhoh0/emacsd_organization/  ...but as you can see from looking there, there is no real agreement on a ""best practice"".  And again, until your own configuration has become cluttered and unwieldy, there's really not much point in concerning yourself too much about organization.  Just remember put in a comment or two when you add something!   That will vastly ease your inevitable re-organization.  It's less about ""getting it right"" than it is about ""getting it right for yourself.""  Or put another way, as a newbie, your initial efforts are going to be ""rough draft"", ""preliminary notes"", ""early experiments"", etc. type efforts anyway.

emacs,33gsh6,eric-plutono,6,Thu Apr 23 04:54:23 2015 UTC,"…could just give me a quick run down it'd be great.   No problem.  defun defines a function.  It often looks like this:  (defun name (paramaters)     ""String explaining what the function does.""     (interactive)     ; More code here...     )   That (interactive) part makes the function available as a command, e.g. it allows me to do stuff like M-x ejmr/toggle-writing-mode.  The rest of the function is a ‘condition’, created by cond.  In this case it’s similar to if-else constructs, if you’re familiar with those from other programming languages.  The function has two conditions:  (cond ((bound-and-true-p olivetti-mode)         ; Code to run if this is true.       )       (t         ; Code to run if the above is not true.       ))   The function bound-and-true-p is a useful way to tell if a minor mode is enabled.  If the mode is enabled then bound-and-true-p will return true.  So this is how the function does two different things depending on whether or not olivetti-mode is enabled.  If Olivetti is enabled then the function turns it off:   (olivetti-mode -1) A common way to turn off a mode. (olivetti-toggle-hide-modeline) Restore my mode-line. (toggle-frame-fullscreen) A built-in Emacs function.  You can use C-h w (“whereis”) to find out which keys such commands are bound to. (menu-bar-mode 1) Re-enable the menu bar.  Like point number one, this is a common way to turn on a mode.   If Olivetti is not enabled then the function turns it on and effectively performs the inverse of all of the above.  You can see how the two use -1 and 1 as ways to enable or disable Olivetti and the menu-bar, respectively.  Then I bind a key to ejmr/toggle-writing-mode, using either define-key or global-set-key (using C-h f will help you understand these functions), and then I’m good to go.  Hope that makes sense!  Feel free to ask anything else if it doesn’t.  Edit: Formatting."

When you enable Olivetti the menu bar and the mode-line go away while the frame goes full screen. And when you disable it, everything comes back. If I understand correctly then Olivetti also always you to set the text area to a certain size, that is have it in the center and so on.

They could be very nice for other people and I would implore you all to try them if you haven't.  Powerline. I went from using powerline, to using a custom theme, to using my own current minimal mode-line. There is just so much information in default mode-lines that I don't care about or so important that I need to never not see it. Since moving away from powerline I have never once thought, ""I still wish I had (minor modes|current project|git status|time|weather|etc...) in my mode line.""  Moving from a really flashy mode-line to this has been very nice.  highlight-indentation I no longer use it for whitespace dependent languages like python, haml, and sass. I found it generally didn't make anything easier on me and only served to cause a noticeable lag which restricted my editing capabilities.   pretty-mode (and others like it) For Lisps and probably other languages, replacing 'lambda' with the symbol, will mess up indentation of arguments. I found it bothersome that I would need to turn off the mode and reindent a file before being able to commit it with proper indentation. In the end I just don't see a lot of value in it. I'm sure for other language it could be nice, but I don't like it for lisps."

Vim is great for editing code, but Emacs shortcuts expand very well to any form of text (see org-mode) many modes rebind keys like C-n or C-k to special functions, or other chords many modes will not work with evil bindings, dired until recently, and magit are two common ones for me. it breaks some special features (I'm thinking of some paredit navigation features that can't be done easily with vim bindings).   Personally, I think I rely too much on vim keys.  I get easily excited and slap away at the keyboard but I'm much more concentrated with the standard Emacs bindings. For instance, most of my straight Emacs navigation is with ace-jump-mode, while I'll often hold j to move 10 or more lines in evil.   The big one that holds me back is the fact that I often will work on my Macbook without my external Kinesis Advantage, and my pinkies can't take that kind of pounding.

Folding on indentation is a possibility, but it would require me to run json formatting tools on the document first.  Also, given the structure of my typical document, folding is less important to me than being able to jump to a parent or sibling node in the tree."
emacs,33djht,tuhdo,3,Tue Apr 21 18:40:09 2015 UTC,"You don't need to format the buffer. hs-minor-mode can fold according to parentheses level as well. And if you want to jump, simply look at the line number of the folded block and jump to line there in a cloned buffer. For example (assume you enabled linum-mode):   C-x 4 c to clone a buffer. Switch to the cloned buffer and M-x hs-hide-all. Now, look at a line number of a folded node and M-g g to jump the line in current buffer. You can press  M-<next> or M-<prior> to scroll up and down the cloned buffer (next means PgDown and prior means PgUp).    Now you have two buffer: One is the ""tree"" buffer and one is your editing buffer. This works well for modes that do not have tree support from Speedbar/ECB/Imenu."

The best way to cut your teeth is to build your own config extensions and build from them to make useful public packages.  Keeping people at a distance from their own config, and that is exactly what all starter kits do, is not such a wonderful thing.

I personally don't want to see such users being the mainstream of Emacs users, I prefer to see Lisp hackers in this space, so we actually get better quality throughout.  Of course, it's much easier to get all enthused about a starter kit, than facing tough problems, but this is the way of things."
emacs,333ywx,instant_sunshine,2,Mon Apr 20 06:46:08 2015 UTC,"The best way to cut your teeth is to build your own config extensions and build from them to make useful public packages.   This is true and I think Spacemacs allows the user to do this with the private layers. In a private layer you are at home, from this point of view Spacemacs is just a configuration loader with an architecture and some tools tailored to ease the configuration management.  For the fun I will experiment about a barebone spacemacs that boots with not layer at all. Not sure of the result though :-)"

By forcing you to put all your private configuration in a ""layer"" (~emacs package), it forces you to build a ""package"" from day zero. Splitting layers is trivial. Since spacemacs puts your whole config in a git repo, contributing them back is as easy as sending a pull request.  I've been an emacs user for 5 years and i've made my first contribution this year after using spacemacs for a while.  The emacs community advances really fast. If you are not in the loop, you miss huge advances like helm, ido, projectile, company clang, .... Spacemacs gives you by default, and automatically, the latests package for each task, already configured with sane defaults, and ways to update from one package to the next with sane defaults. In particular, its changelog is a really good way to keep up with everything that is going on.  And the spacemacs gitter chat is incredibly useful."

There is also a symmetry between / and p/ which searches globally or in project with the best search tool installed on your system.  Then we could introduce bs with the same semantic than ps and s.

When a new Spacemacs is released. you should read the change log in the under Release Notes button.   So ""community configured"" can sometimes result in your trusty tool changing every time you update. I hope they can get to a solid out-of-the-box experience soon and keep that stable.   ""Community configured"" has it up and down side, but the benefits overcome the down side. That is, instead of everyone repeating themselves, they can simply use one and read the configured layer to understand. If there's something wrong, report and issue or fix and create a PR."

Why should it then follow that extensibility inevitably leads to unstable software ?   What you are saying is that it is impossible and unreasonable for anybody to use Emacs unless they want to do lots of maintenance. That we should expect things to break often. That we all must be required to know the full codebase.  Does this mean that it is impossible for anybody to release a distribution or system on the Emacs platform that performs as well as Sublime or Atom ?  As a programmer and product developer I don't see why that should be assumed to be true.  Spacemacs is doing great with certain issues like discoverability and learnability. They added rollback for updates. These are moves in the right direction and why I got really enthusiastic.  I'm just pointing out some weaknesses, which once fixed will become strengths.  Your answer is basically: this is not for you, go away.  I don't think that's the right answer ;)"

I only said that if there's something wrong, report an issue or fix it and create a PR. It mean, if you don't have time, how difficult it is to report an issue or ask around the chatroom rather than saying ""It sucks""?  I am a regular contributor and user of Spacemacs, so I expect it to be useful out of the box for everybody with a learning curve as low as possible, otherwise Spacemacs would not exist in the first place. But it doesn't mean it automatically becomes perfect and you needn't do anything. At least if you have a problem, report or ask. Your Python issue is already solved and has been answered by other Spacemacs maintainers. If only you ask or read the documentation.  Btw, Atom has a 2MB file limit I can't imagine how someone can use that. And for Sublime, I don't think it has many great and free packages like Emacs, i.e. you have to pay 70$ for something similar to Magit and 70$ for Sublime itself."

emacs,333ywx,cocanning,2,Mon Apr 20 16:01:40 2015 UTC,I recently installed it and I'm very happy so far. I'm a noob to emacs and was a vim user so I don't mind an out-of-the-box solution. Everything seems to be working smooth and the default config was fairly easy for me to switch to. I like the idea of configuration layers so I can include what I need without too much lisp hacking. Do I think it's right for all emacs users? No. If you have a configuration you like and it works for you then it's probably not worth the switch. For someone who wants a jumpstart with some good conventions I think it's a great project.

emacs,331gqp,redguardtoo,8,Sun Apr 19 05:02:29 2015 UTC,"I did not try ivy yet. What annoys me about those ""electric"" completion modes like ido or helm is that they have a completly different paradigm  of interaction with Emacs.  And that's of course their motivation, so that's obviously my problem.  I'm using Emacs for more that twenty years. Having keys like M-b working differently and others  like M-r do not working at all in the minibuffer just makes me less productive.  I've recently discovered icomplete. It comes with Emacs and seems to be actively maintained. I've configured it so that it replaced ido for me, the only losses were the annoyances described above. It works with completion functions (ido typically only works with completion tables) and uses Emacs' completion styles, meaning that it can be setup to complete e.g. lfn to long-file-name."
emacs,331gqp,eclig,1 point,Sat Apr 18 19:52:42 2015 UTC,"Well, ivy gives you a fully functional editing area in the minibuffer. Nothing ridiculous like rebinding C-a or M-b. Or starting a timer that disallows you to exit from the minibuffer.   can be setup to complete e.g. lfn to long-file-name   ivy-mode doesn't try to be smarter than you, it puts you in charge of building the regex. In your example, lfn can translate to either l.*f.*n or l.*f.*n or \bl.*\bf.*\bn or l\b.*f\b.*n or whatever. With ivy, you decide where the wildcard points should be by putting a space there. Same with \b, ^ and $. For instance, if you know that lf should be together, just search for lf n, which will translate to lf.*n."

I'm typing in the minibuffer, but helm's response to that typing is somewhere else in the frame (worst if I have a vertical split).  I'm, I don't know, about 10 weeks into using helm and I still feel like it's very obtuse in its interface in various small ways.  It's very powerful but it feels like the classic interface-by-engineers to me - something that's been created with functionality first, usability and consistency with existing conventions second.

So there's no different.  For Projectile, I'm pretty sure I did it with 80k file list. It's easy to test. Set projectile-require-project-root to nil, then cd to filesystem root and run (helm-)projectile-find-file. Wait for the external find to retrieve your file list. Once it's done, you can start typing in without delay.  Or you can download this file list (the file contains over 220k candidates), then run this command:  (with-current-buffer (find-file-noselect ""file_list2.txt"")   (helm :sources (helm-build-in-buffer-source ""test""                    :data (save-match-data                            (split-string (buffer-string) ""\n"" t)))         :buffer ""*helm test*""))   Even with that many candidates, Helm handles with a breeze.   but it's still very fast for 25k lines   helm-swoop works fine for me on files with 50k lines or above fine.   If people actually like for their completion system to mess with their window config, it's fine. I'm going only for minibuffer completion.   You can adjust helm height and width with either pop-win or its autoresize feature. To the end user, it looks the same and Helm can save your screen space with helm-split-window-in-side-p.   I've used flx-ido for months and actually disabled it for sources with >10000 candidates. The start-up is just too slow.   But it does the correct thing for fuzzy matching and is excellent for anything < 10000.   Handle async process i.e. helm-do-grep, helm-locate, helm-gtags and such...   How is this not true? Could I see one in ivy? I'm pretty sure those commands call out to external process and as soon as there's new output, it inserts into Helm buffer immediately, not waiting for the process to finish and you can terminate the running process simply pressing C-g. In contrast, Projectile [uses shell-command-to-string](shell-command-to-string), which blocks Emacs until the process finishes. A simple example: run helm-do-grep on your home directory and enter something that gives many candidates. You can see Helm gradually fill the returned matches into its buffer, not waiting for grep to finish. If you don't believe, try making the same thing on Ivy.  helm-gtags can list over 10000 candidates in an instant, i.e. try helm-gtags-find-rtags on printk symbol in the kernel source.   This is actually a feature. Out of order matching is surprising, I want people to understand exactly how the matching is done. And not wear their lucky hats just to get a match to what they guess is a good input.   No, the current matching in Ivy is a subset of Helm matching. If you don't like out of order, you can do it the same way in Helm. I really hate having to C-a and enter additional strings to narrow to a few candidates. It gets worse when you have to insert patterns in between existing patterns. This is why I don't like Ido. With Helm I insert a space and additional patterns without having to rearrange the patterns.   This also isn't true.   Ok, I've tested again and backspace does refresh the list. At that time, probably I did not see it immediately."

But it does the correct thing for fuzzy matching and is excellent for anything < 10000.   Which describe-function and execute-extended-command isn't. And even in the <1000 case, I like ivy more than flx-ido because it's more intuitive.   Handle async process i.e. helm-do-grep, helm-locate, helm-gtags and such...   How is this not true? Could I see one in ivy? I'm pretty sure those commands call out to external process and as soon as there's new output, it inserts into Helm buffer immediately, not waiting for the process to finish and you can terminate the running process simply pressing C-g. In contrast, Projectile [uses shell-command-to-string](shell-command-to-string), which blocks Emacs until the process finishes. A simple example: run helm-do-grep on your home directory and enter something that gives many candidates. You can see Helm gradually fill the returned matches into its buffer, not waiting for grep to finish. If you don't believe, try making the same thing on Ivy.   This has nothing to do with Helm or Ivy or Ido or whatever. It an implementation feature of the commands that use completion. You seem to attribute that advantages of Helm to functions that use Helm. They can just as easily use something different. The diff to change smex from ido to ivy was 20 lines.   helm-gtags can list over 10000 candidates in an instant, i.e. try helm-gtags-find-rtags on printk symbol in the kernel source.  This is actually a feature. Out of order matching is surprising, I want people to understand exactly how the matching is done. And not wear their lucky hats just to get a match to what they guess is a good input.   No, the current matching in Ivy is a subset of Helm matching. If you don't like out of order, you can do it the same way in Helm. I really hate having to C-a and enter additional strings to narrow to a few candidates. It gets worse when you have to insert patterns in between existing patterns. This is why I don't like Ido. With Helm I insert a space and additional patterns without having to rearrange the patterns.   A matter of preference. I like it the other way around.   This also isn't true.   Ok, I've tested again and backspace does refresh the list. At that time, probably I did not see it immediately.   The list is refreshed, it probably just wasn't changed, since removing stuff from the match query doesn't remove candidates: it adds them."

Think of how much time you will spend each day entering data into your system, and how much time you will spend creating the system in the first place, and how much time you will spend maintaining the system.  What will the payoff be?  Will you actually save any time in the end by spending all this time up front?  Not to engage in Internet psychology, but this seems like a manifestation of an OCD.  Then, how will you feel if you miss something, if you forget to enter some data?  How will you feel if some of this ""sand"" ""slips through your fingers""?  That's all it really is, anyway: like sand in an hourglass, it just keeps falling through, and in the end, it's all in a big, meaningless pile.  But if you insist on carrying it all, the weight adds up.  Consider the value of the data you want to track, and make sure that the data you are tracking actually has value.  A professor of mine once said something that has stuck with me: in order to not miss out on the great things, you have to be willing to miss out on some of the good things.  I think that principle applies here.  Don't spend more time keeping track of your life than you do living it.  Make sure your tools are serving you, not vice versa.  :)"

I think there is often a tendency among those who become more ""intimate"" with computers (and especially Emacs, and especially Org) to want to make more and more powerful systems, and track more and more data.  Some sense of satisfaction comes from ""building a system"" and sort of ""entrusting"" one's life data to it.  It lends a sense of being in control of one's life, or of having a power over one's life that one wouldn't otherwise have.  But like a lust for omniscience, it is false and unattainable.  I think it's usually more of a means unto itself than a means to an end.  It's fun for a while, but it doesn't accomplish anything, and it has limited usefulness in enhancing the rest of one's life.  It is in a way a distraction from actually living life.  I think many people in this situation have a vulnerability or addictive tendency toward the idea of knowing things--the more, the better.    But humans are finite, and each person's life certainly is.  A better, more fulfilling life does not come from bringing more data into one's realm, one's sphere of understanding--it comes from letting go of more things, allowing oneself to focus on what truly matters.  Perhaps a TL;DR will help: When your life is flashing before your eyes or you're on your death bed, you won't find yourself wishing that you could look up what side dish you cooked on February 27, 2015, and what you were wearing at the time.  ;)  Or perhaps an illustration from a famous person, Einstein, who didn't even remember his own phone number.  Why?  It wasn't important enough for him to remember it.  He could look it up if he needed to.  Relevant to this subject: he obviously wouldn't have devoted time to writing down things he wouldn't need to look up in the future.  He had more important things to do.  I mean, think about this: can you imagine a famous, accomplished person like Einstein or Leonardo keeping a journal of what clothes they wore each day, or what they had to eat?  Those would have been irrelevant trivialities to them.  How about someone like Franklin?  He kept a journal of virtues for a while.

He seems to just want to record a bunch of data without any particular purpose, thinking that maybe something will emerge from it.  My point is that doing so creates a significant burden (i.e. it creates a problem), and that I have noticed this kind of tendency or pattern in people before, and that I think it can be unhealthy.  Maybe you should re-read what I wrote before."

emacs,32wkpy,gottabeme,3,Fri Apr 17 15:46:33 2015 UTC,"Exactly. You're completely right. As of today I'm only keeping track of just a few things because of the overhead that would be tracking everything. I track ""important"" events like books I read, films I see, expenses etc. I only clock when I'm working or studying as those are the parameters that I'm trying to maximize. And I only schedule important meetings, exams, events etc  What I want to do is to make it so seamless and fast that I can categorize 80% of what I do in less than 30 minutes per day.  For example, imagine that you wake up. Stop the timer. Start timer for a shower. Stop timer, start timer for dressing. It asks you what you wear. You start selecting what you wear. I want to make it so fast that it would take you 20 seconds at most. We all follow patterns. If I choose that shirt, or those shoes, the probabilities of the other pieces of the outfit will vary. Even depending on the day or month. I could even fetch the weather and take it into account. My intention is to make a data-entering system that will make use of this things so one can speed it a lot. And further usage will make it better and better. With a good enough task switching and entering system it can be almost painless.   30 minutes per day it's not that bad when you're recording what did you wear, how did you feel, what did you eat, what did you accomplish, read, listen to, watch, met, cooked, bought..  Will it be useful ? Will those metrics give me any advantage for further experimentation and self-improvement ? I don't know. But it seems a fun project to do. I will spend the whole Summer coding it. Plus I want control over my data. What I capture and what I can do with it. Thinking in the long term is mostly a one time investment. Like Emacs.   Do I have an impending sense of collecting everything ? No. Will I carry all my life doing this tracking ? I don't know, if I achieve my objective.. yes. If it's a pain, no."
emacs,32wkpy,gepardcv,2,Fri Apr 17 13:55:56 2015 UTC,"So you plan to run to your Emacs-enabled workstation every time you switch gears, even if it's moving from the shower to the kitchen to make breakfast? Sounds like a huge, huge burden. No matter how seamless you make org-mode doing this.  You need a way better data entry system. A specialized app for an Apple Watch, perhaps. It could certainly use a org-mode back end, it would help with analysis (babel, literate programming, etc.). There is likely a land grab under way for smartwatch apps — if you build a good enough system now, get to market quickly, hook it up with health monitoring, and help produce actionable data, you might have something worthwhile on your hands."
emacs,32wkpy,grabyourmotherskeys,1 point,Fri Apr 17 16:09:19 2015 UTC,"Yes. I have been thinking about it a lot. One hacky way would be to interface with Emacs through web offering an API for the phone, smartwatch. There is not market in that though, and I don't know the real feasibility of it either.  I have already played hooking a Xiaomi Mi Band with Org-Mode (there is a python library to interface with the band) so it can tell me when the timer has finished (pomodoros) by vibrating etc It's mostly one way, but I have thoughts about how to use those devices with Quantified Self.  To do a big simplification of Org-Mode and Emacs with very sensible defaults and already defined workflows, with web and mobile apps. Yes. It might be something worthwhile. I do think that there are a lot of ideas in this community that would make a hit if implemented correctly for the big-market. But I haven't played enough with this. I still don't know how I will do it in Emacs. Maybe in the future I will try to make all of this into a product. For now I'm just playing. :)"

The watch app would know nothing about Org, it would only report data: timers, activities, answering questions (""rate the meal you just had"") based on activity hooks, and health data. This data would go up to a server. The server would maintain an Org file (this will be quite a trick to do well). You then open it in Emacs whenever you want to look at your analytics."

Hopefully, regardless of how it turns out, you'll learn about elisp and Org, and that's not a waste of time (IMO ;).  But as I mentioned in this other comment, think about what you're tracking.  I can't imagine Einstein or Leonardo tracking what clothes they wore and how long it took them to get dressed.  If your objective is to optimize or enhance your life, tracking minutiae like that won't help, because that requires devoting a substantial amount of attention to it.  What will help is just doing it and forgetting about it--""putting it on autopilot.""  What will make your life better is letting go of details like that and focusing on ""big picture"" things that actually matter."

I don't know which is the optimal point for myself or most people. I haven't played enough with quantified self to have a definite opinion about what is right for me.  Tracking what one dresses might seem like a waste. It might not be. It influences how others think and act with respect to you and also how you act yourself. I will know how many times I use an item with respect to what it did cost me. I will be able to compare whether it's better to buy X or Y. That's just one example of a seemingly not useful item.  I won't have the data sitting. Maybe it will take some time to have enough data to do something meaningful with it.. But I have ideas for most of it. Even shaving. Should I use a safety-razor or not? Can I improve my shaving routine doing deliberate practice so I win 20 minutes per week for an initial investment of one hour? Does meeting that person or going to that place make me happy or not? Do I feel better with a 40 hours work week or with a 70 hours work week? In which one I get more done? There is a correlation between tasks done and the time I sleep? Which are the best foods taking into account the price, the nutrient profile and the time/hassle it takes to prepare them? There is a correlation between them and any other item? Without data you can't even start answering those questions. And I know it's not that easy to get answers to those questions. But without any data you don't have almost anything to work with.  A lot of accomplished persons did kept diaries. They might even spent more time that I'm going to spend. They did not do quantified self because it wasn't a concept and they didn't got computers. We can set a system and make it work for us for years with almost no tinkering. And Quantified Self is in itself a ""better journal"". I even think that Leonardo Davinci did kept journals about the books he read or his expenses.  In the end I may spend more time and effort developing my system and thinking about it that it will save me. And you're right. It's possible. But it's fun for me, so I don't care. I already take Emacs as a hobby and lifestyle. Quantified self is another one. I get pleasure from it."

People who gravitate toward Emacs and Org-mode and GTD and things like that (and I include myself) seem to be vulnerable to this idea.  It's not that doing any of these things is wrong or bad or useless.  Don't misunderstand me, please.  It's that doing them will not make one's life more rewarding or fulfilling.  They are not the answer to life's problems.  But the amount of effort that some people put into them strongly implies that they think otherwise.  People who do indeed think this will ultimately be disappointed, and the time they have spent will have been wasted on an illusion, a distraction.  This is what I encourage you to think about.  This is the self-examination I encourage you to undertake.    Perhaps this is not the case with you.  Great.  Use these tools in moderation as you live your life.  But perhaps this is you.

My first 3 paragraphs established a philosophical motivation for the desire to record one's life, the scientific evidence for the necessity of doing so for accurate recall, and finally addressed the errors I saw in your reply regarding OP's specific desires, respectively.  I would agree with you that there are no truly magical behaviors that will ""solve"" life.  But I markedly disagree that incremental improvements are not worth pursuing.   It's that doing them will not make one's life more rewarding or fulfilling. They are not the answer to life's problems.   Consider something as banal as flossing.  Is it the ""answer to life's problems""?  Clearly not. But I do believe it can, in fact, ""make one's life more rewarding or fulfilling"", in all sorts of subtle ways (which are hopefully obvious).  Certainly, there's a limit to that, with greatly diminished returns beyond flossing more frequently than dining, possibly even becoming harmful if actually taken to OCD levels of behavior.    But that's your argument, essentially.  Which reaches, due to that fear of taking it too far, a very poor conclusion:  that flossing is therefore harmful, and practitioners should reevaluate their life choices.  The purpose of flossing is not to fill a void in life, nor to resolve any issue, great or small.  It's simply a behavior to provide a marginal incremental benefit to life.  Now, perhaps this flossing argument is a strawman...but it certainly seems very close to the argument you are putting forward here.  There is zero evidence in OP's original post that they are being pathological with their application of QS techniques.  That QS techniques cannot give life meaning is not relevant.  Neither can many beneficial behaviors.  That QS techniques can be taken too far (as can many other beneficial behaviors), is only tangentially relevant, and your recommendations for correcting that problem far exceed the mandate of merely providing such a warning.

You assume bad faith.  Here is a list of things you've said about me:   being extremely judgmental imposing your own values upon others assume you understand their motivations know the final results of their behavior assume your own greater wisdom in those matters. issuing edicts for how others should think and behave hypocrisy adopting a condescending tone smarmy emoticon   Apparently it never occurred to you that none of those things are the case.  That I'm not being judgmental, simply offering some input to someone who publicly asked for ideas.  That I'm not imposing values (a parroting if I ever heard one), simply pointing out some potential problems that will be raised by the OP's stated ideas.  That I'm not assuming that I understand anyone's motivations, merely taking the OP's words at face value (i.e. the motivations he actually stated).  That I do not presume to know the final results of his behavior--rather, that is the issue we have been discussing.  That I am not issuing edicts--never did I say, ""You should do this,"" or, ""You shouldn't do that.""  That the condescending tone you perceive is merely your own perception.  That the emoticons I use are merely attempts to convey the invisible expressions which would be visible in face-to-face interaction--something that is a standard part of communicating on the Internet.  Yeah, I'm the one who has a communication problem...  I wish I could assume the best on your part, but since you seem determined to destroy my delusions of being a Grand Internet Communicator, I find it difficult to imagine that you're really just here to help me out.    But if I'm wrong--hey, thanks for trying.  It seems that we have very different communication styles.  That doesn't necessarily make either of us wrong or bad at communication.  Think about that.  :)"

One, that I may ignore future arguments about the argument, in any additional replies.  (It's of no value to me.  Or you.  Or any other readers.)  And two, out of a genuine desire to provide constructive criticism of your conversational style.   And given that my comments were more negative above, I'll reiterate in a more positive style of recommendations:   Highlight and correct misunderstandings, rather than simply declaring their existence. Be more concerned with the viewpoint an argument is putting forward than its construction.  If there are errors in that construction which alter that viewpoint, call them out, ideally without ascribing malevolent intent. Avoid using imperatives when you haven't established some kind of authority with your audience.  (And lest I be accused of hypocrisy here, note that this is clearly labeled as a recommendation.)

I believe that adopting those recommendations would vastly improve your communications with others.

Without that follow-through, it's a virtually content-free declaration. (This is exasperating for me.)   I don't know what to say here.  I received complaints from one person that my arguments were too verbose.  Then you complain that I wasn't specific enough--yet I was extensive in my exposition and gave multiple illustrations.  From my point of view, after being as extensive and specific as I was, in multiple comments expressing essentially the same thing, simply saying that you don't understand is sufficient--it would be fruitless for me to reiterate myself yet again.  It's basically implying that you should read my comments again and try to reinterpret them.    IOW, it's like I've put forth more effort trying to explain my POV than you have trying to understand it.  So before you can rightly criticize me for merely saying, ""You don't understand what I'm saying,"" you should put forth more effort to try to explain my POV in your own words.  After you've clarified what you think I mean, I can better correct your interpretation.  As an aside: you seem to take very personally my saying, ""You don't understand what I'm saying,"" as if it were an insult.  Then you seem to feel it necessary to defend yourself, and in return blame me for not reiterating myself.  May I suggest that this is all unnecessary?  :)  When I say, "" You don't understand,"" it's simply an observation.  It's not an insult or a criticism of your ability to understand things.  (Again, being sincere: you're assuming the worst.)   accusations of underhanded argument (e.g. ""another strawman"") Talk about bad faith! of Your first response to any disagreement is to dismiss the argument as wholly invalid by labeling it as fallacious in some way.

(This is frustrating, as it represents a far greater effort at dismissal, than understanding.)   Again, you're assuming the worst.  I'm not accusing you of underhandedness.  Observing that your argument is a strawman is simply an observation.  It's natural to use a strawman when, as I observed earlier, you don't seem to understand my argument.  Here, I'm basically saying, ""Whoa, slow down.  You're arguing past me because you don't understand my point in the first place.""   condescending imperatives (e.g. ""Think about that. :)"") There is an implied authority and deeper understanding in these imperatives, which has not been established. (I find nearly all of these both vapid and needling, due to that unwarranted implication.)   You can interpret it that way if you want.  Personally, I find it ludicrous to imply that any such authority could be established in Internet Arguments.  I'm simply offering a suggestion to consider something I said more carefully, and using a smiley face to show that I am not angry and do not intend it in a condescending manner.  But if your default mode of interpretation is negative (and this is common on the Internet, and something I'm often guilty of myself), then you may interpret it in the opposite way than it's intended.   Perhaps they are entirely subjective, and exclusive to me...but other threads in this post suggest otherwise.   I despise Internet Points Contests, but enough people seem to have understood my comments just fine that I disagree.  You and one other person have expressed disagreement and difficulty in understanding my arguments.  It's entirely possible that that is not due to a failure to adequately express myself, but rather to my expressing ideas which you are unfamiliar with.  Think about that.  :)  (Oops, there I go again!)   Highlight and correct misunderstandings, rather than simply declaring their existence.   You act as if I hadn't already extensively explained my argument.  Again, I think it would be futile to do so unless the other party is willing to put forth equal effort to understand me.  It's like, ""No, that's not correct.  Try again, and this time show your work, and then I can show you where the mistake is.""  Whereas you seem to want me to ""do the homework"" for you, trying to explain your thought process.  Hey, I don't have to be inside your head to recognize that you don't understand what I meant, but I can't read your mind as to how you got there.  :)   Be more concerned with the viewpoint an argument is putting forward than its construction. If there are errors in that construction which alter that viewpoint, call them out, ideally without ascribing malevolent intent.   Ok, this is killing me.  This is exactly what you have done to me.  You accused me of all sorts of malicious intent, while I continued to merely reiterate myself and say, ""No, you don't understand what I'm saying.""  Then, when I finally begin to reciprocate and point out how you're doing that, you complain that I'm criticizing your construction and ascribing bad faith to you.  This is rich.   Avoid using imperatives when you haven't established some kind of authority with your audience. (And lest I be accused of hypocrisy here, note that this is clearly labeled as a recommendation.) Further, if you have actually established such an authority, you will likely find a trailing emoticon unnecessary.   Sorry, I think you're being a bit ridiculous here.  This is the Internet.  I'm a Random Internet Person.  There is no question of authority--no one has any.  Any establishment of such is entirely up to the reader.

And so complaints of overly verbose replies and lack of appropriate follow-through are not mutually exclusive.  But your reply here did successfully clue me in to your core misconception:  that understanding is the responsibility of the audience, not the speaker.    But I think I'm going to be hypocritical and not follow through myself here, beyond that identification (which is still a giant leap beyond simply stating ""you don't understand"", as at least you know exactly what I think you've got a poor understanding of), and not attempt to correct that.    On the bright side, if you're not hypocritical in your application of this wildly wrong belief, I'm certain you'll do the necessary homework to revise your understanding.  Actually, I'm not wildly optimistic about that, expecting you to assume I meant the audience has no responsibility, rather than a lesser one...but eh, I've run out of patience, already...but that's my fault, not yours...which is itself a bit of a hint.)  However I will attempt to correct the notion that authority cannot be established, with a few leading examples:  ""I've been using emacs for 20 years..."", ""having attended both public and private universities..."", ""as a professional baby seal clubber..."", etc.  It's certainly possible for people to lie, and the authority claimed may be dismissed by the audience for any number of reasons, but it's still certainly possible for a Random Internet Person to establish some.  And again, its not established by the reader, but the writer!  Certainly the reader can reject it, for not being credible or relevant.   But I'm not sure how a reader would establish it independently!  You'd have to have a pretty warped view of communication to believe otherwise...oh, right.

Any idea of what else to track, how to improve the capture system, whether to use Org-Mode language or develop specific languages (like ledger format) for some of the quantified modules.. ?   Did you provide any of the requested assistance?    No.    You hijacked the thread to philosophically reject the OP's stated desires (or at least, the greater part of them).

It does seem a little odd for Pharo though. Pharo is a hackable interpreter/environment, like Emacs. Using Emacs to edit Pharo classes feels like using vim to edit elisp.  Perhaps I'm missing something? I've seen Smalltalk people propose Emacs style shortcuts several times (there's a mailing list post from 1994!) but I'm not aware of any packages that provide this today."
emacs,32sqxt,DarthToaster,1 point,Thu Apr 16 22:18:53 2015 UTC,"Actually I found about Shampoo on the HN thread about Pharo 4.0, someone said they shipped a new text editor base ""framework"" giving the Smalltalk browser nicer editing capabilities, he then linked Shampoo as a previous solution."

emacs,32sgmt,thomasfr,3,Thu Apr 16 10:19:39 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting idea. I thought of another bit of software that could benefit from that a while ago, though I haven't the time to pursue it.  In Emac's native-code core there is the elisp interpreter, redisplay and the code for dealing with GUI toolkits and terminals. Emacs also requires a lot of elisp, but no half as much as what it ships with. It would be nice to be able to re-use this for open-source projects without having to distribute all of Emacs along with it. That way Emacs could be used as a VM like the JVM.  I see no reason why this couldn't be done. It would require some scripting. I think the simplest way would be to make a script to copy out the files needed from the Emacs source tree and to build them using a new Makefile. If only one feature were needed, such as Org then lots of other stuff could be dropped. That means loading of .elc and .el probably wouldn't be needed. Everything could be dumped into the executable.  I think the trick would be to gradually drop stuff starting with the most obviously unnecessary stuff first (like the programming modes and email programs). Then move on to the more tricky things like whether or not you'd still need compile-mode or VC."
emacs,32sgmt,RobThorpe,1 point,Thu Apr 16 10:50:46 2015 UTC,To  support babel properly alot of the programming modes are required. To have a simpler process I would probably start by creating a custom init.el that begins with alot of unloading/unbinding.  I would probably want to bundle alot of extra ob-... packages as well.
emacs,32sgmt,RobThorpe,1 point,Thu Apr 16 10:56:03 2015 UTC,You're right. If you want to support Babel you're going to have to drag in most of Emacs.
emacs,32sgmt,tuhdo,1 point,Thu Apr 16 11:05:37 2015 UTC,"So you mean we should have two distribution of Emacs, one with just an executable and the regular one we are having?"
emacs,32sgmt,RobThorpe,1 point,Thu Apr 16 11:27:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, it really needs to be as simple as downloading one file and starting the application. Like it or not, multi step installation processes turns a lot of people off from trying things out.   Another positive side of bundling everything is that it needs less attention supporting  different versions of Emacs and so on.  I would also guess that the people maintaining this org mode bundle would not use it themselves (I would probably really hate working in it myself) so updating it like once a year or after every emacs point release would make sense from that point of view.  EDIT: If this project ever takes off the answer to the question if the Emacs binary should differ from stock or if it should be wrapped by another process or ... will reveal itself."
emacs,32sgmt,tuhdo,1 point,Thu Apr 16 12:35:28 2015 UTC,"What I'm thinking off is that a sort of ""Emacs Lisp VM"" is separated from the Emacs core. This could be done by a script as I described it. That way it could be kept synced with Emacs core.  Then other developers could make applications that use it as a VM in a way that's user-friendly to non-emacs users. So, Org people could make a stand-alone Org. It could start with an empty Org file or in the Org manual. As thomasfr mentioned though because of Babel that may be tricky. Similarly, the Emacs email programs, IRC clients, etc could be turned into stand-alone ones."
emacs,32sgmt,RobThorpe,1 point,Thu Apr 16 13:16:03 2015 UTC,"Generally I like that idea, so people won't think Emacs as a mere editor anymore but a platform for developing programs in it, like it currently is but disguise itself as an editor. Stuffs like Prelude or Spacemacs actually becomes valid.  But then, Emacs will become its own separate Lisp dialect and its implementation will have to be really good to match people's expectation. It should also be able to generate native code and have a better garbage collector. In general, if Emacs Lisp is focused on this direction, than majority of effort for future version of Emacs should spend on it, instead of thinking good enough for text editing is enough.  And finally people can use the Emacs VM as a single binary application or the state it currently is i.e. like Eclipse and everthing else running on JVM."
emacs,32sgmt,kcin,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:12:40 2015 UTC,"I wasn't really thinking about making something targeted at new development. I was thinking more about something to allow re-use of existing Emacs code.  As you say, the Emacs core wouldn't be competitive for new tasks because of it's slow bytecode interpreter and slow GC.  Also, it hasn't really been tested for security vulnerabilities like thing like the JVM have. That would be a big obstacle for server software. I expect there are many networking functions with hidden security problems that aren't easily exploitable while Emacs is end-user software, but would be if it were a server.  Doing what I suggest would be something of a can-of-worms."
emacs,32sgmt,RobThorpe,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:17:21 2015 UTC,I was thinking more about something to allow re-use of existing Emacs code.   If you mean elisp code then the proper solution is implementing Elisp on top of the JVM. This would allow running all existing code and also make all of the libraries available in elisp which are accessible via the JVM.
emacs,32sgmt,wasamasa,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:41:18 2015 UTC,"Why? Doing that would be very complicated. Someone would have to re-implement the bytecode interpreter, the data structures like buffers and windows and all the primitives. Emacs' display engine is very different from those of other programs, that would have to be re-implemented too. It's a much bigger job than cutting down and re-shaping the existing Emacs codebase.  Allowing access to all the JVM libraries would be useful though. But, that should be possible with the new foreign-function interface."
emacs,32sgmt,RobThorpe,1 point,Thu Apr 16 16:51:00 2015 UTC,"I don't believe this makes much sense given how many packages expect the bundled goodies to just be there.  Splitting the core into GNU ELPA might make sense for ease of maintainership, but not much if you want to have a portable runtime. Asides from that, the installed size of my Emacs installation is about 100MB which is a good size compared with Java (270MB for the JDK) or GHC (900 MB for all of it)."
emacs,32sgmt,instant_sunshine,1 point,Thu Apr 16 12:00:53 2015 UTC,"I think your focusing on programming packages. Lots of those use a huge chunk of Emacs. They couldn't easily be chopped down, like Org Babel. But, think about other packages.  What about distributing the email or new packages as separate programs?  I think you could quite easily make MU4E, MH-E or RMAIL into separate programs, they don't depend on very much.  That could be done with file managers too and perhaps VC modes.  I wouldn't really call 100MB a good size given that it doesn't do as much as the Java.  Imagine that you write a utility in elisp, say an IRC client, and use this stripped-down-emacs to distribute it. Would people be happy to download a 100MB IRC client just to try it out?"
emacs,32sgmt,RobThorpe,1 point,Thu Apr 16 13:09:00 2015 UTC,"Yes.  This isn't the 90s.  People download Gbs of files all the time, 100mb is, relatively speaking, nothing."

I definitely think about downloading 100mb. I also wouldn't download a 100mb IRC client because large file downloads often indicate that the programmers behind the app probably don't know what they're doing, or that they've filled the app with graphics to make up for a lack of features."
emacs,32sgmt,kcin,1 point,Fri Apr 17 00:56:21 2015 UTC,I would think that a download size of 100-300mb would be ok. My target audience is kind of IT professionals and I don't see complaining about such things as a couple of hundred megs download size as being professional at all. As fa as complaints goes the lack of evented/threading/...-support in emacs is potentially a more valid claim in that department.

emacs,32fqm3,agnudawn,2,Mon Apr 13 16:07:16 2015 UTC,"Just for completeness (if you wanted similar behavior to some other editors), I'll add that it can be done by ignoring emacs' indentation system and rebinding your tab key to only insert two spaces.  In your config:  (global-set-key ""\t"" (lambda () (interactive) (insert-char 32 2))) ;; [tab] inserts two spaces   Customizing the indentation system to your preferences per mode is probably a better solution for most cases though."
emacs,32fqm3,RobThorpe,2,Mon Apr 13 22:24:27 2015 UTC,These days I think you also have to prevent RET from inserting indentation. You can do that with (electric-indent-just-newline) or by disabling electric-indent with (electric-indent-mode 0).

It's not easy to do that generally without setting electric-indent-just-newline or disabling electric-indent-mode. Without doing that some modes will add different numbers of spaces when RET is pressed.  BTW as you probably know there are only two differences between your settings and the 24.4 default: * Yours never run electric-indent-functions. * Yours don't indent the line you start on. The default is to indent the first line and the inserted line."

For Javascript use (setq js-indent-level 2), you'll have to tailor that if you use one of the alternatives like js2 or web-mode. For PHP it's php-mode-coding-style, or so I gather from the internet, I've never used it.  If you customize those two variables you should be fine. You don't need to edit tab-stop-list which only affects text files anyway. You also don't need to edit tab-width if you're never going to encounter files with tabs in them.  Tab-width is the number of spaces that Emacs inserts visually per tab.  It may be better to keep tab-width at a large value so you can spot files that use tabs and disobey the coding convention."

emacs,32ekmg,maheshexp,60,Mon Apr 13 03:42:18 2015 UTC,"This is my favorite topic :) Here I post my old answer again:  My guides can help you.  Here are some nice features that Emacs and its 3rd packages provide:   Powerful automatic indentation with aggressive-indent(scroll down for demos). It does not only indent the current line, but the whole semantic context around your cursor. Live grep C/C++ refactoring with built-in parser Lisp Code reformatting. As far as I know, there's none Lisp code reformatting outside of Emacs. Access to a list of project with a few key strokes Quickly access any file in your project, as large as Linux kernel, instantly, regardless of where you are in the project, and within a few keystrokes. Jump to any file depends on context, even if the file path is in a plain ASCII text file Copy files from anywhere to anywhere. Delete files anywhere; files are always at your finger tip to do whatever with them. Switch between other files with same names but different extensions. Work not only for C/C++ but other languages, and is customizable. You don't have to configure anything, like adding include paths for the command to search. Everything is automatic. Just use it as it is. Jump to tag definition, from its own parser or external parser like GNu Global Jump up to parent. Do you like outline tree? Interactive outline tree Easily move back and forth using the interactive outline tree References retrieved from its Emacs internal parser. Beautiful compile output Frontend support for GDB Code completion. Open man page for symbol at cursor.  Emacs open 39MB C file Emac opens multi-gigabtye file   Note that in the demos you may see me type in the commands. You can think of it like the start menu in Windows, but actually those commands can be executed quickly with a shortcut. I type in the commands for demonstration purpose to Emacs users.  Those demos are just tip of the iceberg."
emacs,32ekmg,tuhdo,3,Mon Apr 13 03:48:53 2015 UTC,"How did you open the 39MB C file? I actually recently had to open a 40MB C file (it was a decompilation from IDA), and Emacs handled it horribly. I could barely navigate at all."

They've been a huge help, but I have just one suggestion: It would be great if the gifs you include as demos also showed the commands or keystrokes used for each step (either as caption text, or appearing overlaid in the gif itself as they are invoked).

Quick question: With helm-gtags, is there a way to have helm-gtags-find-file just straight to interactively display results rather than first having you type in a pattern.

Since the later is covered by other posters, I'll tell you how I use Emacs for other tasks in my day-to-day life.  First it's worth pointing out that I'm a social scientist. This entails, quite literally, tons of papers to read. PDF-tools is great for this. Having org-mode open in one frame, while reading papers in the other (tiling WMs make Emacs frames wonderful to use) is far more efficient than any other solution I have tried. Add the extensibility of Emacs, and you have a great mix (e.g., is it annoying to switch frames before you flip to the next PDF page? Bind a key in org mode to swap to the nearest PDF view, scroll down a page, and jump back.)  Org-mode is excellent for writing (the *tex formats are, unfortunately, not very popular among my peers). Fancy-narrow mode with evil and evil-leader makes focusing on certain parts of my text wonderfully simple. In normal mode I press 'vis' (visually select the whole of the current sentence), then my shortcut for narrow selection, and suddenly the sentence I'm currently working on is in focus. Add writeroom-mode into the mix, and you have a wonderful, distraction free, environment to work in.  Have experience taught you that reviewers sometimes ask you to purge your text of certain arguments, and then, two rounds of review later, want it added back again? Since org-mode files are all just text, I have all my worked tucked nice and safely in a git repository on one of my servers. Emacs with its wonderful git support makes it almost a joy to go back in time, seeing the  changes your work has gone through.  Org-mode, of course, is far more than a writers tool: I use it for quick notes (deft is fantastic for this. My tiling window manager, StumpWM, enables me to quickly create an Emacs frame, running deft. When I close deft, the frame itself is also closed) and organizing my work and private life.  I use Emacs for other tasks as well, but most of them somehow involves my previous profession--software development."

emacs,32ekmg,gottabeme,7,Fri Apr 17 20:38:52 2015 UTC,"I'm a composer and not a programmer. Though a project that I'm working has required me to learn how to program in Lua. So here's what I use emacs for:  1) Edit Lilypond files. Lilypond generates the best sheet music of any program available. It uses text files (like LaTeX).  2) Edit LaTeX files. I'm something of an amateur typesetter.  3) Lua programming.  4) Updating my website.  The project I work on (/r/platonicmusicengine ) is a large program written in Lua. There's an amazing IDE from Zerobrane Studios that was created for Lua. Why don't I use it?  1) Doesn't have git stuff built in. I love magit and it's so nice to be able to use it on the fly.  2) My software generates both Lilypond and LaTeX files and it's nice to be able to edit those directly in the same editor (emacs).  Similar to the Lua editor above there's an amazing one available for Lilypond called Frescobaldi. It is seriously really good. Why don't I use it?  1) Lack of git.  2) Again, the ability to switch easily to other files and copy and paste things across as needed.  I do have to edit my website (shameless plug) with something. It's all html and server side stuff but again, it's nice to be able to edit the site using Tramp and copy and paste things around from all the other files I'm using in my project.  So I guess the reason I use it instead of any of the single-purpose editors that are available and might even be better at dealing with those specific tasks, is that emacs allows me to handle all of them in a uniform matter (same keybindings, for example).   And then having things like a time-clock function, rpn calculator, pianobar (for listening to music from emacs), one customized dictionary that I can use across all the file types, and many other tools specific to emacs that these other editors have no reason to have, makes using emacs an obvious choice.  I don't use it for mail (gmail) though I do often use it to compose long emails. And I don't use it for browsing the web.  Also, I'm not a programmer and don't understand anything about Lisp. Any customization I do has to be copied from someone else. Fortunately there's a lot of great people who document all this stuff which makes it easy for me."

For example, org-mode is great a personal information manager and it is a fairly recent application, not something which the original creators of emacs intended. So the strength of emacs is it can have many different uses depending on the needs of its users.  That said, I don't use emacs for everything. For example, I don't use it for email or web browsing. There are better tools for that.  So my philosophy is use the best tool for the job. But that doesn't mean quitting emacs altogether if there is a better tool for a certain task, because there are always other tasks which are specific to the one's own use case and emacs is a great platform to quickly implement solutions for these uses cases.  For me the above mentioned org-mode would itself be a reason to use emacs if I didn't have other uses for it."

Here are the things that I presently find irritating in mu4e:   mu4e presently doesn't have the ability to display all header lines with the keystroke, as mutt does; this is a feature that I used regularly under mutt. mu4e's interface to mu doesn't presently appear to permit use of quoted patterns containing spaces; given the weight with which mu4e depends upon searches, this can be a significant drawback. mu4e doesn't presently permit easily toggling display of a particular message between the html and text forms; mutt does. mu4e presently relies heavily upon auto-extraction of email addresses from the mu index as an address book, but it does not presently permit reordering these (e.g. I don't want Bob's rarely-used home address to be the first one that comes up) or blacklisting old or incorrect addresses from completions (I have added my own, rather-unnecessarily-complicated implementation to address this, which I've never submitted to the project). I prefer opportunistic gpg encryption: if I have a key for someone, I prefer to encrypt my email upon send unless this is requested not to happen.  mu4e presently requires manual effort to encrypt/decrypt messages.   On the up side, as console (well, I use it in a console) clients go, if you already know emacs well, mu4e, which uses menus a fair bit and can replace a lot of moving and filtering functionality with its searches, is one of the faster mail clients to learn, and it took me much less time to pick it up than I did mutt."

This is fairly self-explanatory; I update my inbox about every hour to ensure that I'm up to date on everything that's going on. Schoolwork with LaTeX, combined with the excellent AucTeX.  I use Template to create consistent-looking documents; people have begun to recognize my documents without even seeing my name on them.

I combine both (see my other post in this thread) to great effect. The main advantage deft has over plain org-mode--with tags and capture templates--is the ludicrous speed at which you can search your notes. If desirable, you can easily point it to your other org-mode files as well (you'll have to search GitHub for a modification to deft, I don't use this feature but I remember playing with it a while back), making searching through your notes, TODOs, and other org-mode files a breeze.

Select from the matches with up/down/pgup/pgdown and press enter to go that location (you can navigate the history with M-p/M-n). If the search string contains several strings separated by spaces then these substrings can appear in any order in the results. The search handles an org heading and its text as one block, so the substrings can match in any part of an org entry. If the heading is not matching, only the body, the heading is added to the results anyway to indicated which entry is matched.   http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/org-search-goto-ml.el  There may be newer helm-based solutions too, but I haven't checked, because the above package works well for me."

I consider efficiency dependent on several characteristics of your work and personal preferences.  Focusing on the two points you brought up in separate, deft would probably be similar. An advantage to deft, however, is that both of the processes are combined. When you start typing the name of a note (in reality a new .org file), it searches and narrows your other notes if they match--on file name or content--what you have typed so far. In the match part of the buffer you see the name of the note, and a brief summary (the first few lines of the file).   This makes many scenarios easier to deal with. An example could be me remembering a point <w> made about <x>, in paper <y> and how it affects our understanding of <z>. Did I note that down before? In that case I would start typing the file name for a new entry. If I have entered my ideas into org-files--through deft or otherwise--I can easily jump into the note, read it, and possibly add to it. I often discover through the process that a few notes stick out: in this case perhaps similar arguments made by others. By having these processes combined, I'm often made aware of things I didn't know I was looking for.   I'm not sure your system would accommodate such a workflow, and indeed it might not be relevant to you, but if it sounds interesting, deft might be worth looking into."

At my current company, we use XCode (not much choice) to build an iOS app, along with a C++ ""core"" library (which is the part I primarily work on). For serious code typing and normal editing, I use emacs, but I keep xcode open in the next workspace (or whatever OS X  calls them), and occasionally switch back and forth.  I sunk some time into setting up basic build and run commands from emacs, but for anything like adding files to the project, or refactoring, or exploring a new piece of code, I use XCode because it has smart IDE features that understand syntax. I know people will point you at a million emacs plugins that try to do the same thing, but I don't mess with those much anymore. The fact is that my team mostly uses XCode, so someone else has set stuff up to work correctly, and I often don't want to sink too many hours into it. And if I make a change, I need to make sure it works in XCode anyway. Sometimes writing elisp is a great way to productively procrastinate though :).  I have etags set up for basic jump, but its pretty horrible (try finding the definition of a function called Init or Update). I use emacs because I have it set up exactly the way I like and I'm really fast and comfortable with it, but I don't try to make it an IDE when it's not. Despite that, I usually don't need those features. If I'm writing some code and unit tests, and just iterating on that, I can go days without touching XCode, but if I'm messing with the build, project settings, etc., it can be the other way around.

Yes, but it will include false positives as well. For example, if you want to search for Update() definition in class A but there are 5 other Update() definitions in other classes, it will give you all and you have to choose one like this. The good thing is, you have Helm so it's easy to narrow to one and you can also press C-z (or TAB if you rebind helm-execute-persistent-action to preview each); also as you can see in the demo, it gives me class as first result and everything else is below, as the cursor is on the class BaseDim. The advantage is that GNU Global builds index small tag database and is fast. EDIT: One thing to note is that while GNU Global gives you all matches of something, it can separate between definition matches and reference matches. So, if you are looking for definitions, it only gives you all definition matches but not reference matches and vice versa.  Here is reference gathering demo. As you see, if the tag at point is a definition, helm-gtags gives you references, all with a single command: helm-gtags-dwim.   The problem I've had with packages in the past that claim to support C++ is that they couldn't understand the project structure and weren't looking in the right place for files   GNU Global is not a full-fledged C++ parser as in the compiler, so it won't give you 100% matches. However, it does a good job at giving you all possible matches, so that's a good thing that you do not miss anything. Using it is easy: i'm install GNU Global, at the command line, type gtags and it automatically builds a tag database starting from that directory down into every directory inside the directory root.

emacs,32d2wx,jamdatadude,12,Sun Apr 12 19:53:44 2015 UTC,I use and highly recommend elpy (it supports both of your desired modules out of the box):  https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy

emacs,32d2wx,metaperl,4,Thu Apr 16 19:33:32 2015 UTC,"Hello, Here is a link to my setup:  https://github.com/huseyinyilmaz/emacs-config/blob/master/lisp/  There are different configurations you can do.  1) jedi, autocomplete, flymake, projectile : This was my old setup. But I wanted to change autocomplete with company mode for some time now. But if i remember right, jedi.el had a dependency on autocomplete so I could not change it. without changing jedi and autocomplete together.  If you decide to use this one. You probably want to add virtualenv support. I did this here: https://github.com/huseyinyilmaz/emacs-config/blob/master/lisp/user-init-jedi.el I get virtualenv info from virtualenv package. Than I get project root from projectile package. With those, I initialize jedi so goto source can work.  2) anaconda, company, flycheck, projectile: This is what I recommend. * Anaconda uses jedi (on python side) as backend. But you can use company mode instead of autocomplete with this.    If you use virtualenvwrapper with this setup, anaconda figures out the path automatically so you do not need to set virtualenv yourself. project root is also found automatically but I do not know how. it might be taking it from projectile but I am not sure. You should just use flycheck/ instead of flymake. A lot of backends comes preconfigured (flake8 included ) on flycheck. It is a very good project. Go to its source and search for flake8 jshint etc. to find other backends provided. projectile has 2 things that I use. It figures out your project root from location of your .git directory, make files ant files etc. And it has project level grep function which is really helpfull.   This is all my dependencies: https://github.com/huseyinyilmaz/emacs-config/blob/master/lisp/user-init-config.el#L9-L47  This is my initialization sequence: https://github.com/huseyinyilmaz/emacs-config/blob/master/lisp/user-init.el  I hope that helps."

emacs,329zm6,pietjesnot,19,Sat Apr 11 22:55:25 2015 UTC,"To start, there is no reason not to leave Emacs. As amazing as Emacs is, there are plenty of other great software packages out there. For many of the questions you ask, I personally use a standalone tool (Firefox, Geary, Sakura, Evince). You do not have to, but Emacs is not magic; it is a collection of tools and standards, and in some cases theses help each other. But Emacs offers few benefits for PDF-reading, and fitting web browsing into the text-oriented layout engine of Emacs is difficult. This isn't a pitch to cause you to abandon Emacs: it is my favorite tool, and it may become yours. But it is a tool, and like any tool does not deserve sanctification.  Now to answer your particular questions:   EWW is a built-in web browser (v24.4+). It's good for browsing text-based websites, but it doesn't execute Javascript and does not fully render HTML. I don't think it can view Youtube videos, but there is likely a separate mode for that. Check the packages archives. Yes. Gnus is a mail client that ships with Emacs, but I think nowadays several alternatives are more popular, including notmuch and mu4e. All of them support HTML mail, to varying levels. Yes. term and ansi-term are full terminals. You can run bash and ncurses programs in them. I would recommend multi-term if you're using them often. But I should also note that many ncurses programs have Emacs versions, and I've personally found switching to eshell (an Emacs shell, so a bash replacement) to be productive. Yes. doc-view views PDF files. I've found that increasing the resolution helps me make out the text better. Sadly, I do not know. Yes. Org-mode is a superlative personal wiki, organizer, and so many other things.   Also, know that Emacs is good not because it has a web browser, a PDF reader, and so on—it is good because it marries these with a common ecosystem. So learn not just the tools built on Emacs, but the ecosystem they live in: learn the package system, the configuration system, the scripting language, the community."

If you set a simple keybinding to launch ""mpv http://some.url"" then you will be able to easily watch YouTube videos (and more, youtube-dl supports pretty much all video sites), albeit not directly inside Emacs.  Also, you may want to, as much as possible, avoid browsing sites directly with eww and instead use an Emacs client for them. For example, you can browse Stack Exchange with sx.el.  If you are trying to do all this stuff with Emacs, I would encourage first spending some time getting familiar with the basics, going through the tutorial, learning the keybindings.

Try M-x eww and type an url or keywords. It defaults to duckduckgo for searching but you can change that with (setq-default eww-search-prefix ""https://google.nl/search?q="") in ~/.emacs to make it google for instance. you can use org mode maybe? yes, you are looking for M-x ansi-term this will let you use a 'real' terminal inside emacs. For other things 'shell' or even 'eshell' works also (but no real terminal emulation/ncurses) yes, they should display automagically when you open them, with docview. i don't know, sorry   e: epub is just a zipped collection of html files i see from this http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/epubmode.el i'm not sure if this will work out for you, it converts the html to text (with html2text external program) and makes it a .txt file.

Consistent default leader key implementations go a long way toward improving consistency: you need drastically less :ex commands. Plus a lot of the integrated packages work with each other much better than I was able to get them to work. I still use a lot of default emacs commands because I'm used to them, but I don't need to (C-x C-f instead of SPC f whatever, M-x instead of SPC : because that's annoying, half the time I use C-x b half the time SPC b s, etc)."

The Emacs devel team are working on something better, see the recent thread on antlr-mode (which is another mode that needs two-in-one behaviour).

However, I work primarily with SQLite, and sometimes MySQL and PostgreSQL.  I have never used sqlplus so I cannot say how it compares with regard to support for database engines, or its method of interaction.  EmacSQL allows me to write and execute queries using s-expressions, and to work with the results the same way I would work with Emacs Lisp values.  Auto-completion on those results is possible simply through Emacs’ dabbrev-expand.  Having said all of that, I use EmacSQL for probing databases with relatively simple queries and statements.  For more complicated work I prefer to use tools specific to the database engine I’m using, when possible.  But if you’re comfortable with Lisp s-expressions then EmacSQL provides a nice means of interaction and is worth a look."

The big win for me is yasnippet with my custom snippets. Writing SQL can be cumbersome. Guards everywhere. Redundant text everwhere. Try creating (with guarding) a junction table with 2 FKs and a doubled up 2-way indexes; it begs for a snippet.  For sql scripts, I find snippets more important than auto-completion.  But for completion I use the default dabbrev-expand M-/. It may be dumb textual completion but it's fast. It often guesses what I want better than the ""real"" completion in Microsoft-SSMS.  The lack of a good interactive mode sucks. But a quick Alt+Tab to jump between Emacs and SSMS fills the void."

I don't mean that as the usual editor wars sniping, I mean it because using emacs demonstrates the following:   understanding that it's important to use the most powerful tools a willingness to improve and customize your personal tools the ability to hang in long enough to learn something hard   Granted, I don't know that emacs should be as hard as it is, but it probably can't be helped. Personally, it took me two big attempts over a period of five years before I finally abandoned everything else.  Interestingly, the editor I abandoned was SlickEdit, which is basically a newer, less powerful, emacs based on a rather awful language (Slick-C...they should have just picked a different Lisp). I did spend years with VI -- and still use VI style navigation key bindings -- and I do like it, but it's not the same kind of tool; it's only an editor.  When I hire developers, I actually ask what editor they use. Not picking emacs isn't an immediate disqualification, but using an un-customized Visual Studio would be. I'm somewhat embarrassed that it took me as long as it did to start being concerned with my tools. Early in my career I was developing for Windows and had to learn some MFC and bought a book. The author took the time to go over VS customizations and why they're important.  The revelation was like getting struck by lightning.  Suddenly, I was asking myself ""Why the fuck aren't I making my tools work for me instead of the other way around?""  Fast-forward a few years and I was card-carrying emacs dude.  I want, no demand, that my dev folks have the sort of mindset that is always striving to make things easier and more efficient. To find the best tools and to master them. The most important tool we have is our editor/dev environment.  If a person can't be bothered to make the most of their tools, I can't be bothered to employ them."

It's one we all need to think carefully about. I use my phone almost as much as my computer, and I suspect a lot of people use their phones as much, or more often then their computer.  So then why do we trade in our ethics for convenience on this device? If it were just a phone, one could make that argument, but a smart phone today is far more than a simple telephony device- it's a full computer. In fact, I'd argue it's an even more dangerous one than the desktop in terms of needs related to security and privacy, because it keeps all your personal information, but with the added bonus of having the ability to track you and record your audio.  I'm not sure why Orgzly isn't Free Software. It doesn't make sense to me. It's gratis, so are they serving ads? Are they tracking the user?  The number of org-mode using people is quite small, so I can't think of a reason not to release the source code unless there's some ulterior motive involved that they don't want people to know about.

I wrote it for myself -- it literally grew from Hello World while playing with Android and from my own need as someone who is using Org mode for (too) many things.  But I don't see Org mode users as the only ones using Orgzly.  You don't have to know what Org mode is to use it.  At least that's the goal, together with making it powerful enough for Org mode user to get some work done.  Anyway, I do work on cleaning up the code to get it to the point I'd be happy to release it, but this is not going to be any time soon and I don't want to make any promises there.

It is too dense,  very fast paced and covers too much material (like a new function and keyboard shortcuts for that function every 2 lines - i made up the number but I'm trying to say it's so dense that it gets very easy to lose concentration)   I'm sure you are right that they are very essential to be productive but not essential to get started in the first place.   If that works for other newbies that's OK,  but it certainly hasn't worked for me.

emacs,31i3zy,tuhdo,2,Sun Apr 5 18:11:59 2015 UTC,"I disagree, vim (just like emacs) doesn't actually take that much time to learn, if you just want to be as productive as your original text editor. Maybe a week, at most. I learned it in a weekend. The thing about emacs and vim (at least in my experience) is that you first learn to use them as a regular text editor, and then you learn all the tricks and such to make you much faster than you could be in a ""normal"" text editor."
emacs,31i3zy,GBGamer117,2,Tue Apr 7 14:43:40 2015 UTC,I also disagree. To a beginners Emacs is just like Notepad except with different keys for copy and paste. Everything else can be learned gradually after that. Not so with Vi derivatives.

emacs,31755j,instant_sunshine,1 point,Thu Apr 2 18:24:10 2015 UTC,"There are already color pickers for Emacs that you could recycle.  If they don't suit your needs, it shouldn't be too hard to roll your own color picker.  For example you could display the RGB values in hex and use the + and - keys to increase the intensity of the component under the cursor (R, G, or B).  To preview the theme, you could either simply apply it, or you could have a buffer with sample text and text-overlays that use the new face definitions.  It may be a little more effort to make the latter approach work, but I suppose it would be a great learning experience.  A benefit of writing something like this in Emacs may be that you find more users and contributors."

emacs,316zp9,excitedaboutemacs,7,Thu Apr 2 14:19:29 2015 UTC,I think Evil should get very prominent placement. The vim refugee community needs representation.  Also org-mode is probably one of the best things about Emacs but has nothing pointing it out.

Enable it by setting:   (setq ido-use-virtual-buffers t)   The idea of mixing buffers and recently opened files is for convenient.

And when I'm done for the moment and want to do Something Else then I can just close all the frames so it seems like emacs is closed but its just there in the background, gnus daemon checking mail every 30 minutes, circe filling up irc buffers, my files and state waiting for me to get back to it.  You can largely get the same behavior by starting the emacs server but this requires at least one emacs frame to always be open.  If that doesn't bother you then by all means use that.  For others like me, emacs daemon is the best thing ever."

emacs,30ok3o,statmobile,5,Sun Mar 29 21:10:56 2015 UTC,"Projectile helps manage and operate on projects. Where as regular emacs (such as M-x grep) works on files, projectile provides commands that operate on entire projects at a time.   Helm is a completion system, an alternative to M-x, ido and the like.  You can use both together: you can select a project to work on using the helm interface. And then open a file in that project through helm. Or you can just use projectile to work on and manipulate a project without using helm at all. Or you can use just helm to get various file completions but no support for projects."

emacs,30ok3o,statmobile,6,Sun Mar 29 22:43:06 2015 UTC,"Projectile gives you a convenient way to perform operations on files grouped together as a project. For example, no matter what file in that project you are currently looking at in the active window, you can search for strings (using grep, ack, or ag) across the whole project without changing your context to the project's root. You can also launch the best available source control interface for that project (VC or Magit). You can switch between a source file and its unit test file with one command.  Helm — I just went through the exercise of learning it and setting it up. My motivation was the relative awkwardness of opening files in a large project. Projectile helps a lot here, but the ido-find-file interface bogs down with many matches, especially with similar-looking file names. Helm is a fast generic matcher. You can hook it deeply into Emacs, but I just hooked it into Projectile. Now, whenever Projectile wants to give me some choices — files or buffers — it uses the Helm completion system. It's quite fast and a bit more convenient than the ido interface for presenting many choices.  Time will tell if I stick with it, but persp-mode and Projectile have been life-savers for me. Helm might just be another helpful tool here."

Well, maybe it's a problem for you, but it's not an issue with TRAMP.  The ssh and su invocations both require a password (which could differ, in certain arrangements).  You could possibly reduce some of the friction here via ssh-agent configuration (removing the need for a connection password) and sudo configuration (removing the need for confirmation for root privileges for certain operations).  But both of those configurations are completely external to emacs, though some additional TRAMP configuration is probably also required to take full advantage of those changes...if they are desired (there are security considerations for both).  Anyway, I'm not sure that is the answer you were looking for (or even fully sure it's correct!)  But it does seem both plausible and likely that the two password requests are for those 2 separate, respective processes:  ssh and su.   And thus entirely correct for TRAMP to request, when needed."

emacs,30bvfv,RobThorpe,4,Thu Mar 26 17:36:47 2015 UTC,"Btw, since you are a Vim user, you may want to take a look at Spacemacs which vimified Emacs.

emacs,30bvfv,tuhdo,4,Thu Mar 26 02:52:35 2015 UTC,"What do you mean moving the cursor is slow? How are you moving it?  Once you hit C-<spc> to set the Mark you can use just about any means of navigation - in any combination - to mark the other end of your region, such as move forward or backward by words, sentences, or paragraphs (including using numerical arguments with C-<number>), or use isearch to take you right where you want to go.  For example, to select part of my text above I could do the following sequence:   C-r once backwards isearch to beginning of 'Once' C-<spc> set the mark C-s aphs move point to the end of the word 'paragraphs', highlighting the region in between.   Or to end the region at the word 'you' I could enter C-s you and then keep hitting C-s until I got the 'you' that I wanted.  Edit: and here's a couple more ways: http://emacsrocks.com/e10.html"
emacs,30bvfv,Neurorational,3,Thu Mar 26 04:40:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, navigating by I-search (C-s/C-r) is the way to fly.  Also, the default behavior of I-search is to set the mark at the search start position...and though that won't highlight the region (like setting a mark first with C-<spc> will), many operations just use point and mark (i.e. highlighting isn't necessary)...so you can often save another step (i.e. skip the C-<spc> highlighting) if speed is your chief concern.  Just wanted to point that out, and to doubly recommend navigation via I-search.  It's a lot faster to just send the cursor to the text position you want, via search, than it is to move line-by-line and character-by-character."
emacs,30bvfv,forked_tongue,1 point,Thu Mar 26 16:13:21 2015 UTC,"When I isearch without explicitly setting the mark I can C-x C-x k back to where I started from but I can't kill the text in between Mark and Point, though I don't know if that might be because of my customizations.

Expanding the region with ""s"" for sexp, ""l"" for list, ""d"" for defun for example is extremely useful for elisp editing.

For other applications, sometimes it's just convenience:   Calculations: sure I could use gnome-calculator or whatever, but C-x * * is typed quicker and I get a more powerful calculator. IRC: Circe made me become active on IRC again; before I would open a terminal with irssi and promptly forget about it and not look for days.  With a built-in IRC client in Emacs, I get notifications in my mode bar. Terminal: sometimes I'll use a regular terminal, but if I just want to run the program I'm working on, I usually type C-x M C-p RET (switch to my ansi-term, recall the previous command and execute it) so quick that it happens before I'm consciously aware of it Magit: makes day-to-day git usage easier and more pleasant. Dired-mode: sometimes I want to do some clean up in some directories, and using the mark command in dired is the best way to select a bunch of files and directories and delete them in one fell swoop. Twitter: pretty much the same reason as Circe.  Also, if I have something to say, I'm most often already inside Emacs, so I can just do C-x t to load twitter, press c to compose a new message and C-c C-c to post it.  The whole process takes about 5-10 seconds, probably faster than going to twitter.com with Firefox.   I don't use Emacs for emails or for web browser, but the point is that as you use Emacs, you find yourself integrating it more and more into your workflow.  It doesn't have to happen at once, it doesn't have to do everything, it just needs to be exactly what you want.

emacs,2zvhmu,tuhdo,5,Sun Apr 26 20:41:45 2015 UTC,"I use Emacs for pretty much everything, besides Keepass and Firefox which I use for things that it can't do. And although I use i3wm on Xubuntu, yes, Emacs is pretty much my OS, and I could do with it on top of any system. All I'd need besides would be git, rcs, Keepass and some decent web browser.  The reason for this is Elisp. With it, I do not need to know tens of configuration grammars and/or programming languages. I can create little procedures for getting things done, and I can easily integrate different parts of it. For example, I can write a little function to export my markdown to a buffer as HTML and render it using the new SHR mode[1]. To do this without Emacs one would need to use a markdown program, a script to generate HTML and a browser to view the content of this HTML file. Or, a program in itself to edit markdown. I can program it such that it is my default email client and it allows me to use mailto links[2]. I can modify its basic functionality however I want[3]. On an OS with support for an infinite number of programming languages and methods of communication among programs, there is just too much overhead for easy integration a user needs. If I wanted to use mutt, msmtp, fetchmail and maildrop, it is already four different configuration languages and files for sending and receiving email in a Unix way. With emacs, equivalent functionality can be implemented using only elisp and in a single file. This is why people replace Emacs to be the main interface for their OS's.

Well, given that markdown is not that complex for a frequent desire of previewing the resulting HTML does not emerge, so much so that I've forgotten the keybinding for that (also given that I have switched to textile markup).  But whatever, a combination of vim and tmux can be nearly equally powerful.  And in your workflow, if you're efficient and happy, then no need for change.  No need for an open mind, which bunch of programs one uses is not that big of a deal.  I used to be a more technical user, to edit OS config daily, to program daily, to live in the chain of write-compile-run, and those times it was more comfortable to live closer to system tools, make, vi, shell, man, gcc, gdb, python, whatever.  But nowadays, my interaction with a computer is more or less at the level of a normal user, I write blog posts, follow news, listen to podcasts, music, write and read emails and so forth, and use org-mode to a way way way lesser extent than most people do[1], so I cannot be bothered with looking at an xterm window and running feh or whatever to view an image while reading an RSS feed item. Also, I cannot rush through man pages to figure out what sort of configuration language had my software or what environment variables it wanted, given that of those each of a bazillion of software programmes have their own custom ones, or go around trying to figure out Haskell to figure out what's wrong with pandoc.  With Emacs there is solely elisp, and most generally I need not know nothing else, and this way of things fit me better.  TL;DR Oh, I've ranted, I'm sorry :)  I've seen your response at one of my loquacious hours of the day.

A longer more nuanced answer is:    I do use a terminal multiplexer, since I've never found an emacs terminal mode that works quite right for me (my main issue being updating curses-based applications, e.g. top, netstat, iostat; though I've got other gripes as well).    Also, I need (at least) one well-supported web-browser (supported by the internet-at-large that is, e.g. ""this site is minimally usable with browser X."")  So, I'm not ready to dispense with a WM just yet, even if I prefer to do all (or at least as much as possible) of my text handling (or mangling) within emacs.  The principle advantages of doing as much as possible within emacs are:  a consistent interface, ease of data-transfer (e.g. emailing a link from irc...with all copy/search/motion operations and window juggling done via the keyboard), and the ability to write macros between different text-based applications.  In any case, I wouldn't advise anyone to ""ditch everything for emacs.""  Just become proficient with it, and soon you'll have your own reasons for migrating your workflow more deeply into emacs.   But that's not an operation anyone needs to complete to 100%.  Not everything is text, and not every text application is better in emacs (although many, if not most, are!)

While that might sound pretty cool, imagine that you have a few hundred files which are pretty similar in naming but differs here and there, and you need to rename all of them. This happened to me while testing in the field recently, I had 1500+ files in different formats that needed to be renamed consistently.  Pop up a dired buffer, C-x C-q, use your normal editing commands to fix the file names (M-x replace-string, macros, string rectangles, multiple cursors...) and then C-c C-c and you have just renamed hundreds of files.

It has a simple programming language and thorough API; only the implementation of the language, input detection, and other REALLY low-level pieces are in C and not Emacs Lisp. Emacs users learned this language and started building their own workflows around Emacs.  Complaining about Emacs replacing userspace tools is like complaining about stacking vs. tiling window managers. They both manage windows; it's just a matter of your workflow preference.  Emacs does not have its own kernel (that I know of), so it still relies on a kernel and other operating system software like libc in order to run. It's not replacing your operating system; it's replacing some user applications that are available for people with different workflow preferences.  Linux is a kernel. Emacs is a user application. They are not in the same category, and they cannot compete with each other. That's like saying airplanes compete with lawnmowers because they both have engines; they have entirely different purposes."

It's just a factor in deciding on whether to use an emacs program or one not in emacs. Some programs are even designed to have an optional emacs interface, like mu has mu4e interface.

It also provides things like bookmarks, registers and the multiple-entry kill ring (like the clipboard) available.  There's much less duplication that people think. Most of the non-editing functionality is provided by other programs. The shell and term modes are interfaces to normal shells (except eshell). Printing uses ghostscript. Dired uses ls (though it has it's own version of ls as a fallback). Find-dired uses find (though again there's a lisp fallback). Grep and grep-find use the system grep. Image transformations use imagemagick. Of course the compile modes use the system compiler and M-x gdb uses gdb. Most of the email programs use external tools for receiving and or filing.

If you edit code in REPL, it gets editing support from Emacs and any minor mode.

Use winner-mode and press C-c <left> to go back to previous window layout. Save window configurations to register and later restore it. You have a lot of registers. Use purpose.

As for my game, it was my first ever actual programming project that wasn't just a book problem, and I've been Frankensteining features into it over the past year. Pretty much everything that went into its creation has been a learning experience. Currently, a fundamental part of gameplay (enemy sight) doesn't work correctly, so I'm not comfortable actually distributing it to be played until I finish fixing that. There is also no easy way to build it; I'm trying to learn Make at the moment so I can give it a makefile and be able to create projects that aren't a giant pain for anybody else to tinker with. This is its main site and this is its current GitHub page.  I was also mistaken - it doesn't interpret '/', '\', or 'x' as wall tiles, so artist-mode isn't quite perfect for it yet. I hope to fix that tonight.  edit: I double fucked up, it handles those characters nicely. And it is fixed, so enemies can see now.

emacs,2zr4pc,chekt,1 point,Mon Mar 23 11:19:14 2015 UTC,"Well, it could mean that, if you scope it's definition that way.  Of course, it's also consistent when scoped to a particular activity.  What it isn't is predictable, for a new activity.  So while I was really just making light, I also know that for long term users, the broader consistency becomes apparent, but it's deeply irritating when coming from a more rigid system.  You have a choice, embrace the default, or customise it.  That's always the choice you have with Emacs.  and, more and more these days, someone comes along and gives you the customisation you are looking for. Nice isn't it."

Additionally, I dislike having to work around the default behavior of most packages, which is to open a buffer in the window one position clockwise from the current window, by moving my cursor one to the right of where I want the window to open.  What I want is one default behavior that all packages share (either open a new buffer on the current window or the next window clockwise), and a command like ""choose-window"" that lets me choose where to put the buffer of the next command.

(Reading and interpreting emacslisp in JS isn't something I'm particularly into doing so and theme which uses vars to define colours will not work, sadly, that's a fair few of the more popular themes, I may make a compatibility tool in Emacs, which will export the current themed faces into a deftheme.  That'd be nice for making combined themes too!)  Github repo : https://github.com/emacsfodder/emacs-theme-editor  Overview  Use one of a small collection of starter themes, edit a font face by clicking the color blob next to it's name, change the color, watch it update live, and when you've done your best, click save.  You can keep work in progress by clicking the  +  button under the font faces list, to keep it in your browser's localStorage.  The list of starter themes is held in  https://github.com/emacsfodder/emacs-theme-editor/blob/gh-pages/js/starter-themes.coffee if you'd like to add one, you can submit a pull request adding in the same format.  To get the live theme you're editing in JSON format do: JSON.stringify(App.live_theme) in the Browser dev console.  Quick roadmap (TODO list):   Theme import (button is currently dead :( ) Undo facility Overall or by selected group, colour edits, brightness, saturation, hue, contrast, etc. Allow a description to be used. Sanitise a given theme name, remove:    junk chars and trim space spaces to dashes detect and remove ""theme"" from the name (it's auto appended only to the filename, but should not be in the theme name itself)  Add proper package header  Add more faces, I'll be happy to see issues open on github requesting different mode custom faces support. Each face should be editable as one line (with foreground/background bold, italic, underline at least) More things I haven't thought of yet...   Things I definitely won't do.   Support complex theme importing. Add support for custom theme variables that.   Also DarkTooth (the third ""starter theme"") has been made into a theme in it's own right, and is being published to MELPA.  see https://github.com/emacsfodder/emacs-theme-darktooth (I'll probably make a post for this soon!)

Of course, without traction no standard will take shape, but if the theme editor generates and imports themes based on this standard, I think it will likely take hold.  It's really down to how powerful the editing facilities are.  I can't imagine people build Sublime Text themes with anything other than the excellent online theme editor, so that's a relatively useful parallel.   I may be a little optimistic, but I like to think it's a case of when, not if a standard emerges."

emacs,2zc731,KozureOkami,3,Tue Mar 17 10:59:54 2015 UTC,"Pretty funny!  I found Evil somewhat difficult to configure, compared with Vim keybindings, than initially thought. Maybe I just need to learn how Lisp really works.   For example, when I want to bind a key to selecting a block, In Vim I could do it as following:   nmap <CR> vip  In Vim vocabulary, the nmap stands for normal mode, imap and vmap stands for insert mode and visual mode. <CR> is the input for Enter.  So in normal modus, when I press Enter, Vim will rebind this to visually inside the paragraph. That means I visually select the code block on the current line of the cursor.   When I tried to emulate this behaviour in Evil, I would like to see how vip is definied in Evil. When I press C-h k to look up the keybindings under vip, I could only get v because that's the first input that Emacs receives. I see the key v is bounded to the function (evil-visual-char &optional MARK POINT TYPE MESSAGE).   Then I look up the source code of that function in evil-states.el.   But I couldn't wrap my head around it. I have constantly this issue. So I'm looking for any template or workflow, to wrap my head around how I could look it up and configure it. It would be appreciated."
emacs,2zc731,ReneFroger,6,Tue Mar 17 11:24:14 2015 UTC,Well v does immediately run evil-visual-char but then just run that and then do your C-h k (while being in visual mode). Then you'll find out that ip runs evil-inner-paragraph. If you don't want to bother finding out the proper Emacs way to do this then you just call both of them interactively:  (defun my-vip ()   (interactive)   (call-interactively 'evil-visual-char)   (call-interactively 'evil-inner-paragraph))   Interactive command since you probably want to call it interactively.  I've also just started with Emacs (in January) and it's been super easy with a few basics that you need to learn.
emacs,2zc731,MyNameIsFuchs,1 point,Tue Mar 17 13:25:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your useful script. But I want to figure out how I could see the command that belongs to that key. I tried your way already before. When in Visual mode, I press C-h k, but that disables the visual mode, and I get in insert mode that follows with ip. So it isn't working either."
emacs,2zc731,ReneFroger,2,Tue Mar 17 14:56:52 2015 UTC,"Weird, that works just fine for me. Pressing C-h C-h stays in Visual selection mode and then gives me the function name when entering ip into the prompt."
emacs,2zc731,MyNameIsFuchs,3,Tue Mar 17 15:15:58 2015 UTC,"I think you mean C-h k after presing v to enter visual mode, and press ip to get the function."
emacs,2zc731,tuhdo,2,Tue Mar 17 15:36:03 2015 UTC,Yeah that works too. But I always use C-h C-h since I have a brain like sieve. But it seems weird that C-h k would exit visual selection mode for OP.
emacs,2zc731,MyNameIsFuchs,2,Tue Mar 17 15:52:04 2015 UTC,C-h C-hopens meta help window and wait for the final character to select a help command. Then we press k then ip to get the command. It would confuse him if he presses C-h C-h and a window just popup instead of giving command.   But C-h C-h is good introduction anyway.
emacs,2zc731,tuhdo,6,Tue Mar 17 15:58:43 2015 UTC,"in this particular example you can copy vim's way of defining:  (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd ""RET"") (kbd ""v i p""))   where it won't work is that you don't have control over recursive vs non-recursive mappings as you do in vim, but for simple use cases it's often easier to define it this way compared to defining a new function."

emacs,2zc731,ReneFroger,1 point,Tue Mar 17 20:19:59 2015 UTC,"It's not difficult once you are used to Lisp. In Emacs, you don't rebind a key to a key. Instead, you rebind a command to a key. Of course, you can create a syntactic sugar with macro that accepts two key bindings, then the macro picks the command assigned to the right binding and assigns it to the left binding, like the above example of yours. But then, it's cleaner to directly rebind a command to a key. In Emacs, configuration means programming it your way.  I guess you already have expand-region that can be used as equivalent command:  (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd ""RET"") 'er/mark-paragraph)    You should have a look at the Evil documentation. It would make it easier to program Evil your way."

emacs,2zc731,ReneFroger,5,Tue Mar 17 12:33:19 2015 UTC,"As /u/wasamasa said, using keyboard macro in your case is the easiest way:   Press <f3> to start recording. Press vip. Press <f4> to stop recording. Name it with kmacro-name-last-macro (bound to C-x C-k n). i.e. my-vip To save it to a file, M-x insert-kbd-macro and your keyboard macro is inserted in the current buffer.   That's an interactive way to create your custom command without touching Elisp. I think it's even easier than VimL, given that you have to learn no syntax. And thanks to /u/wasamasa for this trick. I didn't think of this before thinking of Elisp as the a last resort. I should practice my keyboard macro kungfu more."
emacs,2zc731,tuhdo,1 point,Tue Mar 17 13:48:42 2015 UTC,That's because v calls a command that waits for extra input. This input modifies Evil's internal state which is used to do extra stuff when discovering that you're specifying a text object or motion. A keyboard macro would be the easiest way of redoing that action.

Also (b) make it pretty easy to add support for new faces, see js/face-table.coffee as some small progress towards this goal.

On keyboards that lack a physical Meta key (or keys), its functionality may be invokable by other keys such as the Alt key, the Windows key, or user-configured keys.

Reasons:   Uses mostly Alt and rarely Alt+Shift instead of Ctrl  You press Alt with a thumb and Ctrl with a pinky. Thumb is much stronger than pinky, and using Alt constantly doesn't strain the hand that much. Introduces well-known keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl+n for new file and Ctrl+s for save  Yes, we already know that Ctrl sucks, and it's a shame that practically all GUI programs use Ctrl convention, but it lowers the barrier to entry for newbies. Groups similar commands meaningfully  i, j, k, l (similar to gaming's WASD) for movement as just one example. Throws away rarely used shortcuts  When is the last time you used zap-to-char?   Now I know that ErgoEmacs is not perfect and there are plenty of idiosyncrasies and inconsistencies too. But it's a step in a right direction. ErgoEmacs is what made me love the actual Emacs. If not for it, I would probably ditch Emacs long ago.  I don't use ErgoEmacs, but use a keybinding scheme inspired by it. I'm not satisfied with it at all, and I think the whole philosophy behind key shortcuts could be redesigned, but I don't have time nor desire to research into that.

(And I've seen the keyboard advice from /u/xah and personally consider it insane...but that's my own personal judgment.  Though there are some valid points there, there are also quite a few highly questionable conclusions.)  Further, it is my suspicion that there is some deeper learning that you've missed out on (at least initially), by starting out with ErgoEmacs.  There are some mnemonic devices and idioms that are used throughout emacs that the default binds are a primer for.  But I can't know that for certain, it's just a suspicion.  In any case, none of that discounts your thoughts and preferences.  But I think you're considerably more certain of a few points than objective evidence warrants.  Which again, is just fine for you, as an individual...but is maybe not the best guidance for universal policies.  P.S.  I use zap-to-char quite a bit!  It's very useful in macros.

This just make sense from experience. Guess what, it's all very personal and subjective too, unless you can point me to a relevant study. Any decision that Emacs developers made during these years weren't consulted with bleeding-edge science. They just did because they felt it made sense. And they argued with each other too, coming up with arguments on both sides (and there are not necessarily only 2 sides).  So I don't understand the point of the whole thread, if you knew in advance, that you gonna dismiss any argument with the fallacious “but there is no reliable science behind it”.  What's your point anyway? Should Emacs have different default keybindings? That's a meaningless question, because god knows what “should” means in this context. I just think that if Emacs used mostly Alt instead of mostly Ctrl in keybindings, then the experience would be vastly more pleasant, and there would be less people with RSI. And if Emacs supported Ctrl+n and other widespread shortcuts, then there would be more novices willing to learn Emacs. Do I have studies showing that using thumb instead of pinky reduces RSI? No, just like I don't have studies for absolutely any advice given on /r/emacs.  Just think how ridiculous it would be, if a novice, when advised by an experienced Emacs user to learn some Elisp, retorted with “But you don't provide any rigorous controlled studies with p < 0.05 that learning Elisp actually improves your Emacs experience!”"

Barring some physical injury or disability that requires it, such customization is premature and harmful.  And yes, I'm pretty committed to this opinion, and mostly just wanted to share it.  (And defend it.) Secondly, I am more open to changing defaults than it might appear.  Though I find CUA somewhat personally repulsive (and 1987's IBM's recommendations for MS-DOS ""GUI"" applications really doesn't seem anything remotely like ""progress"" to me), I am attracted to both convention and improvement.   Especially improvement of the new user experience, which I would agree is rather daunting.   And yes, there are some conflicts between the first point and the second point.  And that motivates some discussion, don't you think?  I don't consider you an idiot.  (If I did, I wouldn't bother conversing with you...no one is enriched by argument with idiots.)  However, I do find a lot of your views very presumptive (e.g. more users of emacs as unquestioned good, default emacs bindings cause RSI, CUA is the interface standard that all present (and circularly, future) applications should default to, etc.); these are all very questionable assumptions which you appear expect others to simply accept as true.  And that probably does induce a bit of condescension in my tone.   There's nothing wrong with opinions, but they shouldn't be confused with facts.   Both are beliefs, and everyone holds their own beliefs to be (at least tentatively or provisionally) true...which is the core trouble in many communications.  The dividing line between opinion and fact is compelling evidence.  The key point here is that just because you believe something to be true is not sufficient to make it factual.  And asking for advice is usually asking for opinions.  And I do take a dim view of muddling these, hence the tone."
emacs,2yp9v7,sindikat,2,Fri Mar 13 19:00:47 2015 UTC,"More users of Emacs, if not at expense of other Emacs priorities is strictly an improvement, because more users means more bug-reports, more packages, more tutorials, more improvements. Also, if you think that Emacs does actually make life better for some category of people, then it's obviously good, if these people start using it. Do we really need to discuss that?  Default Emacs bindings probably cause RSI, because various Emacs users acquired RSI during the years. And these are programmers, not typists—typists need to type an order of magnitude more than programmers, because programming is mostly looking at code and thinking, not actual typing. Ctrl-based combinations may have contributed to that. Do I have science behind that? No.  I didn't say CUA is standard everywhere, but it's standard in like 99.9% software that everyone uses. Microsoft Word userbase maybe a few orders of magnitude bigger than Emacs userbase, so obviously more people are accostumed to Ctrl+n than to C-x C-s. So obviously keybindings compatible with 99.9% of software would make it easier for newbies to use Emacs. How many newbies? I have no idea, but I can speculate that probably quite much, knowing that even a second of latency can drive away thousands of visitors from a website. Do I have any statistics for that? No I don't.  The whole paragraph about opinions and facts is just meh. Ever heard of Bayesianism? Degrees of believes? Stuff like that? You can never know that something is factual, absolutely every belief that you hold will always be an opinion. But some things are so convincing, that we assign like 99.99% of confidence to them and call them facts for simplicity. I believe that, say, ErgoEmacs significantly reduces RSI risk with like 65% or something. If I ever stumble upon high-quality study that confirms my belief, it would change my confidence to like 99% (according to Bayes theorem, but people are not perfect Bayesians, so it's always an approximation). If you provide good arguments (not necessarily rigorous studies, just something that convinces me based on what I know about the world), it would shift my confidence to 50% or 30%, or whatever.  You don't have any science behind any of your point. You don't even have compelling evidence, that you're talking about, for your first point. Then you are annoyed that nobody provides peer-reviewed papers or whatever. Then you say that people inappropriately hold you to a high standard. This doesn't make sense to me. I don't hold you to a high standard. Have any argument, no matter how compelling or not, throw it out, let's discuss. I'm happy to provide arguments for my ideas and maybe go out of the way and research stuff a little bit to strengthen my arguments. But I'm not that invested, so if you just want to be deliberately obtuse and win Internet debates, then I concede, you won every debate in this thread, whatever."

This is a space-cadet keyboard, the keyboard that was used at MIT for their Lisp Machines, upon which the initial versions of Emacs were written.

There is nothing arbitrary about the keybindings, with modern keyboards they simply feel strange because modern keyboards are different, and this is why many Emacs experts recommend using Caps as an additional Control modifier."

(Run M-x apropos with inputs: ""next"", ""previous"", ""forward"", ""backward"" for many examples!)  But the main point I was trying to make is simply:  any current set of keybinds (whether that's emacs/readline, CUA, vi(m), or something even more exotic) is likely to contain some arbitrary choices!  I don't think any large-scale, long-term, scientific studies have been done on keyboard ergonomics.  Nor does all software make the same use of the keyboard.  Combining both those previous points  (no data, different use cases), no existing interface standard is in any position to demonstrate it's superiority.

Fallacy of gray. Nothing is perfect, nothing is black and white, but some things are better than others, and some shades of gray are lighter than others. Arguing that any current set of keybindings will contain some arbitrary choices, therefore they are all equivalent, is like arguing that no person can be flawlessly good, therefore Einstein and Hitler are equivalently good.  My point is, some keybindings are superior to others, but, as you say, because we don't have any science on keyboard ergonomics, we don't know which keybinding scheme is superior. But it shouldn't stop us from making incremental improvements, if common sense, small empirical samples, anecdotes, subjective feelings, whatever, compels us to make these improvements. There's no scientific proof that transient-mark-mode, or visual-line-mode, or whatever new default that Emacs introduced since some version, is better than lack of it.

emacs,2yp9v7,a_dollar_sign_texas,3,Thu Mar 12 10:09:54 2015 UTC,"There are many different commands that are built atop the basic ones, e.g. for the case you mentioned there are the s-expression navigation commands (C-M-n, C-M-p, C-M-f, C-M-p), or for the yank/kill binds (C-y, C-k) there are the rectangle versions (C-x r y, C-x r k), etc.  That is, there is often some additional depth to the default bindings, beyond the initial surface you encounter.  And both of those additional command sets are very useful to a programmer.  (And even if you only use org-mode, the rectangle commands can be very useful for org-mode tables.)  So, are you still certain you've learned all the reasoning behind the defaults?  (Which is an unfair question...I haven't either...but I do think there's more there than you've previously noticed, as I've noted more than you, and I know my own knowledge is incomplete!)  But you don't need anyone's permission to modify anything.    My thesis is simply that you may be stunting or slowing your ability to learn and use such additional facilities, if you make modifications prematurely.  (And even more so, if you override bindings for features you may want to use in the future.)  The issue here is that the beginner is unaware of the full extent of what they're discarding, when they abandon the defaults before learning what is built atop them.  If learning to use emacs effectively is truly your goal, isn't that a bit counter-productive?  Certainly there are trade-offs, and you should make emacs work the way you want it to.  But maybe your desires could be better informed than a brief cursory contemplation of the surface details allows for."

They function completely independently (as far as I understand), and the mnemonics aren't even linked conceptually. I did have to make a quick fix to my smartparens configurations so that forward, backward, next, and previous s-expression functions were consistent with my chosen navigation keys. But it seems clear that these chords for navigating s-expressions are not any part of the reason for choosing fbnp; rather, because fbnp was already chosen, they were adopted by analogy. So I don't think this counts as evidence that there is deeper thought to the choice of fbnp, it only shows that other things have built on that choice. I've done a bit of searching on this topic, and I have found no explanation for the initial choice, except for the mnemonic and the fact that that the control key was located where the caps lock is now (on most common keyboards), which makes the operation slightly less inconvenient (I have remapped control, but I still wouldn't dream of switching back to nbfp). So, yeah, I really think it takes 2 seconds to ""learn"" the reason behind that default and that the user should then proceed to make whatever change they desire.  This I grant: one shouldn't go mucking about changing default setting unless they're also prepared to muck about changing other stuff to suite their needs. And one should expect that, if they rebind fbnp to something they like better, then they will be rebinding any analogous commands they encounter. That's not a barrier to use, that's just further customization.   The issue here is that the beginner is unaware of the full extent of what they're discarding, when they abandon the defaults before learning what is built atop them.   They're not discarding anything: all the defaults are still right there, immediately recoverable just by moving the config file. Even if they just experiment with changing defaults and end up deciding to go back to them 6-months later, they still haven't lost anything. Instead, they have felt empowered and encouraged to make the tool fit their needs, and they have also learned the value of some initial setting which they had at first overlooked. There's no harm done in this scenario, and in fact a great good, since they have tasted the flexibility of the tool instead of feeling cramped by some sense of allegiance to legacy.  I know you seem to think that their is a great wisdom to (nearly) all the default configurations, but I literally have never heard a good explanation for them. The fact that later bindings are chosen to suite the more basic defaults isn't a justification of those initial choices. Rather, if there is not a good defense available for the initial choices, this fact is a good argument for sweeping, systematic alternatives to the default settings (likely distributed as an opt-in config file, so that people who have come to mistake ""this is how it is"" for ""this is how it should be"" won't feel their legacy methods are being undervalued).  There's also the issue of antiquated tooling within the Emacs ecosystem: for instance, with multiple cursors mode at my disposal, I have found no use for rectangle selection: the latter covers all use cases of the former and more (at least, as far as I've been able to see). Ditto smarparens mode vs. the default s-expression navigation. Ditto smart-jump-mode vs. standard navigation. Given that most basic emacs functionality is improved by some package or another (in which case you'll be wanting to customize the packages) it seems to me that even the argument based on accretion of bindings over the initial defaults is irrelevant.  The nail in the coffin for this argument is the existence of key-chord-mode: even if some re-binding I chose early on conflicted with a more obscure default binding I discovered down the road, I could just bind the latter to a convenient key-chord completely independent from the rest of my bindings, and I'd immediately have the desired functionality."

But the mnemonic device is the same: next, previous, forward, backward, yank, kill.  And they're both examples of original binds that have been heavily extended...run M-x apropos on any of those first-letter-bolded words, if you don't believe me.  Also, I agree that the initial choices were arbitrary, and probably not optimal...though I do have to hedge with probably there, as aside from personal anecdotal testimony about the horrors of any set of keybindings, there are no large-scale, multiply replicated scientific studies about the ergonomics of keybinds.  Regardless, the point remains, even if the initial selection was arbitrary bathwater, there are a lot of babies (see my M-x apropos comment above) in that soup, now.

I think I've already been too repetitive in stating my views regarding the accretion of additional bindings on top of the basic defaults, and I think we probably understand each other as well as we're going to on that point. But I should perhaps reiterate that just because you rebind some small subset (e.g., C-[n|p|f|b]) doesn't mean you throw out all other bindings that use npfb. That's simply a false dichotomy: it is easy and trivial to have both your basic cursor navigation of choice and the entire suite of more complex tools which use the npfbyk letters. So you can bail out as much bathwater as you please and still eat your fill of babies (am I (mis)using that metaphor right?).  I think anyone who enters into the world of Emacs should be interested in and willing to embark upon an adventure of customization and deep tweaking. If not, stick with tools which are better suited to your particular purposes. But then, by my criteria, any Emacs newbie is ready to start mucking about straight away—as demonstrated by their desire to use Emacs at all.  I absolutely do not hold the view that ""older is always inferior and newer is always better"". Not even remotely. Why would I use emacs at all if I thought that silliness? I don't think multiple-cursors is better than rectangle selection because it's new, I think it's better because, as far as I know, it covers all the functionality of the latter but is more flexible and easier to use. I may be wrong about that, and if my error were demonstrated I'd change my position. That being said, I shouldn't have made myself out to sound utterly dismissive of the Emacs legacy: I think it is vital and essential to the power and beauty of the software. Only, to my mind, the particular key-bindings are completely inessential to the legacy. The legacy is rather about keyboard-centricism, programmability, extensibility, modularity, and collaboration. I guess what I'm really saying then is that I think the position that newbies should be discouraged from customization until they've achieved some arbitrary level of insight into the established wisdom is mistaking accidental features of the Emacs legacy for it's essential ones.   it's even more foolish to consider all prior work to be low-quality trash produced by imbeciles.    Absolutely. This is such a patently absurd position that I'm sure you didn't mean to attribute it to me: this way I can also avoid the conclusion that you meant to call me a fool.

But I tend to think a lot of new users are skipping right over that primer, and missing out on a lot, because of it.   Perhaps what is lost is not exactly essential...but it sure can be useful, and save a lot of trouble and time down the road.

Once that raft is fully inflated (the useful learning has occurred), and they're on their way, it doesn't matter so much.  But I really do believe the initial inflation stage would go a lot faster with the tools provided.  And suggesting they use the foot pump is not an attempt to get them to give up rafting!

emacs,2yp9v7,doomchild,3,Thu Mar 12 23:42:46 2015 UTC,"I generally agree with forked_tongue. I'd just like to expand on some of his points.  To begin with you'll want to change all the word movement keys, M-f, M-b, M-n & M-p.  That's not a big problem, but it's more work.  There are many Emacs modes for viewing things.  You can type things in with these modes, so they remap the normal keys themselves.  The buffer-menu, for example, has n & p. If you want to change everything to use new bindings then these need changing too. They're defined per mode though, so you need to change everything that works like this; buffer-menu, customize, dired, vc-dired, archive-mode, tar-mode, image-mode and doc-view-mode.  Then there are the modes that use similar keys. C-c C-f means ""move to the next heading on the same level"" in org-mode and outline-mode. C-c C-f means move across balanced tag group in HTML mode and SGML mode. In shell-mode it moves forward across a shell command. In *Help* buffers if you follow a link then C-c C-b goes back to the previous help buffer and C-c C-f goes forwards. In Rmail n,p and M-n & M-p move across mail messages (I understand other Emacs mailers use similar conventions).  Then what about using term-mode? Term-mode is great because in key-by-key mode you can use terminal apps that have ASCII graphics, and in line-by-line mode it's like shell-mode. In line-by-line mode cursor commands are controlled by Emacs, so if you remap C-f, M-f, C-a, etc, then it'll work. But, in key-by-key mode your in the hands of the shell, probably bash, so you'll be back to C-f, M-f, C-a and co. That means you could have to remap in the shell too.  Most people will only need a few of these modes (though I've used them all at one time or another). But, even to do a complete job of re-mapping on all of them would be time-consuming. Remember that re-mapping is the task, so new keys are used for movement and they displace existing keys. Those keys need mapping somewhere else, either to fbnp or elsewhere. This isn't trivial, especially at the outset when you haven't much experience with the more obscure modes and don't know what's important.  I'm not at all sure that Emacs' keybindings have been designed in a sensible way or even that they've evolved in a good way. But I do know that budging them takes serious work."

Linux is great because it's different than Windows, and you're going to have to accept that if you want to learn the Linux way.""  That really stuck with me.

emacs,2yp9v7,kcin,9,Thu Mar 12 00:08:53 2015 UTC,"In a word, no.  In a few more words, I think much of the perceived difficulty comes from approaching Emacs as though it is a text editor. Viewed as a programming language, say, the learning curve isn't that unusual. Emacs is an environment that computer savvy people customize to meet their needs. As a text editor that you might use once every few months, it is too complicated. As the piece of software you spend most of your time interacting with, it is as customizable as you'd hope."
emacs,2yp9v7,RobThorpe,14,Thu Mar 12 01:21:44 2015 UTC,"I was definitely in the ""emacs needs to act like other things"" camp when I first started using it (which was about five years ago now, I think), and I mostly still am.  I think emacs has an excellent process, but terrible implementation.  By which I mean that the method for interacting with emacs (readline and key chording) is fantastic, but only when considered apart from the default keys, which are confusing to a new user, hostile to hands, and, in an enormous number of cases, completely arbitrary.  Some decisions make plenty of sense.  C-s for search, for example, made plenty of sense once I stopped and realized that yes, I do search more often than I save.  Being different is fine, as long as it's defensible.  I really don't think emacs has that luxury, though.  When I started using emacs, I saw no fewer than ten blog posts from people who looked to be well-informed (some of them were developers I'd been following for years), all of which suggested swapping Caps Lock and Control.  My brain immediately questioned why this wasn't the default.  When I asked, the answer I got was ""it's always been this way, and our muscle memory is trained"".  And that's fine, if you want new users to have to configure things just to keep from being injured by the product.  History is important, but so is knowing when a better thing exists.  Emacs is great at seamlessly integrating good ideas.  Why are key bindings the one place it falls on its face?"
emacs,2yp9v7,kcin,3,Wed Mar 11 20:11:10 2015 UTC,"I actually prefer control in its standard position, since you can hit it using the base of your pinky. I use the caps lock position for backspace."
emacs,2yp9v7,RobThorpe,3,Thu Mar 12 00:40:02 2015 UTC,"True, but to use that technique easily, you need a ""real"" keyboard with big raised keys. On a paper-flat laptop keyboard the standard control location is a chore."
emacs,2yp9v7,RobThorpe,2,Thu Mar 12 02:15:10 2015 UTC,"However, on laptop keyboards the ctrl is often close to everything else. I regularly use a laptop and a desktop.

emacs,2yp9v7,excitedaboutemacs,4,Thu Mar 12 19:05:28 2015 UTC,"Well, I think most of emacs keybinds (outside of a few, early arbitrary choices) are very defensible.  And the CapsLock/Control issue is a hardware thing, not a software thing...and I personally think the current standard is stupid in contexts well outside of emacs:  CapsLock is a very marginal use-case, in a prime keyboard location!  The only key more stupid to put there would be the power button.    But that's drifting too far away from my intended topic, here."

Yeah, I'm with you.  Emacs happens to hammer the Control key unusually hard (most software doesn't use Control for basic navigation), but even outside of emacs, it really is preferable to have Control where Caps Lock is.  Caps Lock was valuable on typewriters years ago when people more-frequently used caps for emphasis, but it's rare for a typical English prose writer to use any extended for of capital usage, outside of maybe the occasional acronym (NASA, EUCOMM, etc).  Today, I'm going to italicize or maybe use a markup with asterisks, a la Markdown."

emacs,2yp9v7,sindikat,9,Thu Mar 12 01:08:45 2015 UTC,"Erk Naggum on this subject (and more):   Emacs actually comes with a builting Emacs Aptitude Test.  Do you remap your keyboard or the Emacs keybindings before the chords and sequences it comes with by default have wreaked havoc with your hands?  If you do not do anything to make Emacs more convenient for yourself, you may not have the prerequisite aptitude to use it productive.  I have a ""standard"" PC keyboard (except with tons of function keys) and have moved the digits off the normal keypad and onto the numeric keypad and moved all the shifted symbols down to unshifted, and then physically moved the column that used to read 6YHN and all columns right of it one column right.  The vacated holes in they keyboard are filled with whatever left-over keys you have, and then you tell your keyboard driver og X or whatever that you have placed the parens {} [] () and <> (unshifted and shifted) in what used to be the 6YHN colum.  This move some incredibly frequently used keys to between your index fingers instead of terrorizing your right little finger.  Also, return and backspace are now one column closer and also strain the little finger much less.  You also get a little more space between your hands, which some of those ergonomic stunts seem to argue is a good thing.  Also, with Unicode, typing becomes much more fun than remembering those TeX monstrosities, but the downside is that you need a lot more keys.  So AltGr is also one column closer to your right thumb and painless to use even with other keys on the right hand.  Then the left thumb can be used for space, too, or the Alt key that you can use to teach Emacs to use much shorter commands.  Also, remap the useless CAPS key to something useful, like window manager shortcuts.  The really good thing about this keyboard layout is that your computer is /secure/ even if someone should break in and get console access.  I have a system-wide Xmodmap file because the keyboard driver stuff under Linux is so goddamned ""i18nized"" it has become impossible to customize to get predictable results, plus even Debian nukes those files on upgrades. Let me know if you would like to see it.   (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.lang.lisp/9gytzg76CT8[76-100])  I remapped a bunch of emacs keys from day 1; the ones that have stuck are: C-M-S-o (aka C-x C-f), M-S-o (aka C-x o), M-S-b (aka C-x b), and C-M-S-s (aka C-x C-s). I had a lot more originally, but over time I became used enough to the standard emacs shortcuts and discarded my custom ones. I do subscribe to Naggum's theory that you shouldn't be afraid to change emacs if you don't like the defaults, but there is a certain amount of value in being able to use a stock emacs configuration.  (Of course, I have other keyboard shortcuts that are probably unique to me - but the above are the ones that replace the keyboard shortcuts that come with the default settings.)  The only thing I do regret getting used to from my early days is ""fixing"" backspace when you're in an isearch... I suspect if I'd stuck with the default, whereby backspace deletes what's in the buffer rather than what's in your search text, I'd use isearch for general navigation a lot more than I do."

I have shrink-window bound to H-down and  s-; runs comment region.  I just noticed uncomment-region was unbound and bound that to H-;  Back to the original poster's point:  I always use plain vanilla Emacs for a couple of weeks when I get a new computer.

emacs,2yp9v7,kcin,8,Wed Mar 11 19:21:45 2015 UTC,"The point of Emacs is that it is malleable.  Emacs is whatever you want it to be.  If someone wants Emacs to behave like Vim, fine, install Evil and done.  That's the power and true nature of Emacs."
emacs,2yp9v7,tmalsburg2,5,Thu Mar 12 01:31:40 2015 UTC,Exactly. The point of Emacs is you don't adapt to the editor. Instead the editor adapts to you.  That's why the defaults should be viewed as simply those: defaults. Not the one true way which everyone has to follow.
emacs,2yp9v7,tmalsburg2,4,Thu Mar 12 08:53:22 2015 UTC,"I think that its a bit different then what you say. Sure I can create anything I want. But there are certain more practical creations. For instance, I found some useful functions early on and mapped them over some keys. But newer packages use those same keys. Now I have to either shuffle those around and relearn muscle memory or lose some of the newer functionality.   If emacs had some nicer defaults I think it would help a lot.

emacs,2yp9v7,kcin,2,Sat Mar 14 00:59:39 2015 UTC,"I completely endorse this attitude, I think you are absolutely right. The problem I see with Emacs's current architecture, however, is that it's not always possible/practical/efficient to adapt Emacs the way you want it to adapt. Some defaults, that are supposed to be just easily customizable defaults, are so deeply interwined with Emacs, that at some point I just want to give up and don't customize anything in Emacs anymore.  The first problem that quickly comes to mind is the lack of abstraction layer for keybindings. Custom modes assign keybindings straight away. Like C-c C-f to mean ""go forward next semantic unit"" or whatever. If you customize your usual C-f command to some other keybinding, it would be sensible that C-c C-f would automatically change too, if there was smart underlying system. But it doesn't work this way, and you have to accomodate changes for every mode that comes around. It's especially painful, when there is a discrepancy between ordinary commands and minibuffer commands.  In short: Emacs keybinding metaphors are implicit in the Elisp writing conventions, instead of being an explicit abstraction, that could be used by programmers to make keybinding customization truly flexible."
emacs,2yp9v7,sindikat,2,Fri Mar 13 17:16:43 2015 UTC,"Good point.  In the case of Evil, that's not a big problem because Evil leaves the default keybindings largely intact.  Its own key-system is so different from Emacs' that there is little overlap with the defaults and that's why they can peacefully coexist.  But that is just a special case and lucky coincidence."
emacs,2yp9v7,RobThorpe,5,Fri Mar 13 19:16:27 2015 UTC,"I would be interested to see evidence that any interface, default emacs, vim, or CUA etc., is the result of hundreds of hours of user studies, building on UX/design theories etc instead of begin organically grown out of whatever the original programmer thought up.  I think the original question is moot, really. The emacs defaults aren't going to change; it's inconceivable -- and I don't even like them that much. The OP implied a further point, that packages like cua-mode aren't good for new users because the user won't learn the default bindings. I can see the potential for both harm and benefit, no evidence for which is larger, and little reason to think cua-mode will ever go away, either.  In sum, people arguing that Emacs should have different keybindings should probably direct their energy in more productive directions, but I would prefer that the reason given NOT be ""emacs keybindings are highly optimized.""    By the way, I'm not sure CUA is really a text-based interface anyway; it's more oriented toward GUI applications and doesn't have much to say about editing beyond cut,copy,paste (by the way I was surprised to learn that copy is C-Ins rather than C-c)."

However, I (and I bet you) have plenty of customization.  There are some things that people absolutely hate about emacs out-of-the-box, and it's not unreasonable for someone to think that cua or evil fall into these.  Let me list a couple of things that seem like no-brainers to me from my init.el, where few would want anything but what I use:   Timestamped entries in the Messages buffer. A list of file extensions that autoload packages with precedence if those packages are present on a given system. Ibuffer. Adding a keybinding that most terminals can send for replace-regex C-x o is awkward to cycle through buffers in reverse.  I often use three windows, but not more, and M-- C-x o just isn't as nice as C-x O Dired not showing file sizes by default (well, maybe this makes dired a tiny bit more approachable, but it makes it much harder to read).   I think that emacs's non-destructive undo is a great idea.  I think that the interface is indefensibly-awful.  It is really common that people want to move forward and backward through the undo history, and emacs's approach makes that absolutely-awful.  I think that undo-tree is pretty much a no-brainer -- it has emacs's non-destructive undo, but with a much-easier-to-navigate-common-cases approach.  So if I've got all those cases where The Right Thing To Do isn't the default, then why wouldn't someone think ""oh, yeah, CUA mode should go in there too""?   once you're familiar with emacs   I've been using emacs for getting-up-towards twenty years myself, and I'm still uncomfortable saying that I'm really familiar with the thing.

The refusal to explore an option before rejecting it.    It's basically the same feeling as trying to get a finicky toddler to try a new food.  It's 100% OK if they don't like it.  But it's damned annoying if they won't even try it.  It's not worth your effort to force the issue (which is only going to go badly for you), and you still want to be sure they're fed...so, you give them a more familiar acceptable food...and try not to be too annoyed.

Emacs is what you make of it. I'm a veteran Emacs user (>15 years) and I find vanilla emacs unbearable. This also goes for the keybindings, e.g. C-x b is horrible for such a frequent operation as buffer switching.   The default emacs settings are not for everyone and sometimes they are not better, only different.  E.g. CUA binding as defaults were just as good or even better because they would help new users to transition to emacs.   So Emacs should be different where the difference provides some value, but when the difference is arbitrary then it should follow commonly accepted UI standards instead, so new users find less unnecessary obstructions."

And for clarity, this is for new users only...once you're familiar with emacs, if you want to make well-considered changes to anything, to improve your experience, I'm all for that, and all for the community helping you out (if you need it).   For additional clarity, my basic thesis is that these two operations cannot be re-ordered without loss:   Learn the defaults. Customize to your personal satisfaction.   If you skip the first, you will remain ignorant of certain possibilities, and possibly override the settings expected by various tutorials, or more experienced users, leading to other difficulties, starting out.  And for a beginner, it's essentially a form of willful ignorance.  And I'm unlikely to ever have a positive view of that.  Now, whether the defaults are well-chosen or not is more debatable.  That is a different issue, and one I'm not nearly so settled in my opinion about.  However...  Personal arguments, e.g. that you personally ""find vanilla emacs unbearable"" (or that ""C-x b is horrible for...buffer switching""), are not particularly compelling.  I don't doubt your experience, but I do doubt how universal it is (especially when it differs from my own).  You (or I) may be a deviant freak.  Or our opposing experiences may both be within one standard deviation of a statistical norm (on opposite sides).  Without data that neither of us have, there's just no way to know.  But using yourself (or myself) as a standard, representative user is probably not the best way to reach valid conclusions.  I also do not find that (paraphrasing) ""CUA is better, because it is more widespread"" particularly compelling.  (Perhaps you should make that argument in Mandarin?  After all, it's a more popular written language!)  Though this is a more interesting argument, as I do place some value on convention.  However...  I don't consider emacs/readline to be arbitrary or unconventional (or at least, not any more so than CUA is).  Emacs/readline is a commonly accepted UI standard!  Even if it is less common than CUA, comparatively.  So, I personally need a lot more convincing that CUA would be a better default choice.  It may well be.  But I'd like to see some more convincing arguments that it is definitively better, rather than simply more popular outside of emacs."

But don't you think that when the user actually comes across them, then they should learn the emacs -Q defaults? Yeah, an Emacs user at some point may have to know C-a C-e etc, but they at some point would have to know ls, cd, man, find, grep, and Emacs doesn't force the user to learn GNU/Linux commands, or any potentially useful things.  Although I agree with you other comment completely. Emacs would probably have to stick to defaults for strictly practical, down-to-earth reasons.

That could work, but it could still be confusing. I find myself coming to a temporary stop because of minor irregularities quite often, but I'm not everyone.  I'd like to backtrack on something I wrote too. Emacs has TRAMP, which makes editing over ssh & telnet easy. If you're a programmer and you're doing something remotely then you can use that in cooperation with a remote shell (through shell-mode for example). In that case remote operation is painless and you don't have to learn emacs -Q. If you're doing something a bit more like admin things get tricky though. You have to constantly remember that you're working on a remote file (e.g. when using things like M-!)."

Though it was painful to grok at first, but there is hidden beauty in all the readline bindings. I find readline to be much faster than modality.  My biggest problem was to learn how to do things differently. At the start, I desperately tried to emulate vi commands, installing packages such as dot-mode or making complex commands replicating visual line mode. But, after a while, I decided to try harder and learnt how to use the kill ring and registers, and I'm not looking back.  I do think some features should be enabled by default, idocomes to mind.

Knowing what you can do with Elisp, the key bindings seem trivial by comparison. It's like discussing the doormat in front of the cake shop.  Or maybe the bad bindings are there to get the users to change them, so that they learn Elisp by proxy. I think Emacs should improve the bindings if each improvement is clearly beneficial.  CUA isn't clearly beneficial for sure. But adapting C-x b and C-x o to something better, and getting rid of C-z should be done in my opinion. Also maybe swap C-h and C-p."

""I know what I like, and I like what I know"" isn't an attitude very conducive to exploration and learning.  Personal decisions are better made from personal knowledge, rather than personal ignorance.  Whether the current defaults are optimal choices is another question, though also fair game for discussion here.

You can see some of it in ergoemacs comments, some of which i've collected. you don't hear these people much because, such opinion are not inline with the emacs community, are raely propagated. i think emacs should turn on cua mode by default. More urgent than ever. Tons of new editors are still cropping up every year, and seems more so in recent years. Atom, Facebook's Atom derivative, and even Microsoft Code. In the past 5 years, in emacs 23 and 24, some controversial UI issues have been fought hard, and decision made towards modernization. For example, visual line arrow key movement. transient-mark-mode. emacs default keys are scientifically Repetitive Strain Injury inducing. emacs default keys, are not just bad for newbies, but are scientifically, technically, inefficient for expert emacs users. The ~7 de facto standard keys for copy cut paste undo open new save... if emacs adopts them, then, the keys would be technically, scientifically, more efficient, for long time emacs users, not just for newbies. I personally believe, emacs should adopt the ~7 de facto standard keys. because: 1, it will increase emacs users by i estimate at least 2 fold within one year. 2, it will make emacs keys more efficient for long time emacs users.   i have over a hundred articles on keybinding issues. The point mentioned above, especially about keys, i have scientific data to backup. If anyone is interested, ask me. It's all on my site, by the way.  I love emacs. Emacs the system, i think is still unbeatable in many ways. But its keys, i think is scientifically one of the worst, and as well the number one problem for new users to swallow. There are lots packages that provides alternative, but vast majority of emacs users (i believe more than 60%), are not those we see in online blogs or forums, and don't even know how to use packages.

First up, your (emphasis on your) desire to have your colleague switch to emacs probably bears some examination.  Emacs might indeed be a better solution for their (emphasis on their) needs, but that's really their own call to make.  Why is there any need for ""blame"" if they don't end up sharing your preferred solution?  Emacs users past their beginner stage should customize to their heart's content.  And multiple set-up options are an interesting possibility.  However, they would make tutorials and guidance significantly more complicated.

Though, yes, I do imagine that is frustrating.  But that's the lot drawn by the beginner in nearly everything, and there's really no avoiding that.  Further, the main troubles with mimicry are:  where, when, and how the illusion ends.  Depending on many factors, that can be more jarring than simple honesty to begin with.  Somewhat more laterally:  for your first few visits to a foreign country, is it really best to stay in locations and exclusively mingle with others that speak your native language?

In many cases you can get back to where you were by pressing 'q'.  Another option you might like is my major-mode-dedication package: https://github.com/tom-seddon/major-mode-dedication - this lets you specify which mode(s) a given window is ""for"". Then when emacs is about to pop up a buffer of one of those modes, instead of doing something random the buffer will appear in the appropriate window for its mode.

That's two situations where you might want your new buffer to pop up in a specific window, but because there's no way to influence emacs's behaviour in these cases, you're stuck with it popping up in the current window instead.  (I never really noticed this until I got some feedback! I guess I must just have got more used to emacs's habits than I thought. But really, it's an annoying restriction. Because if you want to have a window that's dedicated to your source files, you should be able to do that! - and then when you go to find a source file when you were in the window showing your *scratch* buffer, your source file should open in its preferred window rather than, as it does, the window you were last using.)"

If you don't mind the extra work, you can also setup faces that progressively degrade nicely on displays with fewer colors.  For example, here's the default spec for org-level-1:  ((((class color) (min-colors 88) (background light)) (:foreground ""Blue1""))  (((class color) (min-colors 88) (background dark)) (:foreground ""LightSkyBlue""))  (((class color) (min-colors 16) (background light)) (:foreground ""Blue""))  (((class color) (min-colors 16) (background dark)) (:foreground ""LightSkyBlue""))  (((class color) (min-colors 8)) (:foreground ""blue"" :bold t))  (t (:bold t)))   My other bit of advice is that if you see something in a face that sticks out and you'd like to know the name of it so that you can add an entry for it, you can put the point over it and hit M-x describe-face."

emacs,2ynpzc,kcin,2,Wed Mar 11 09:41:16 2015 UTC,Agreed.  It's not like learning to tap C-w is especially onerous when you want to delete the region.

Frequently used:   apply-macro-to-region-lines comment-region/uncomment-region indent-region undo-in-region   ...and occasionally something more exotic.

Edit for example process (sorry it's so bad):  (some unquoted list)|point-here|   C-space, C-a  |point-here|(some unquoted list)|mark-here| ;; Region highlighted between point and mark   insert quote, C-x C-x  '|mark-here|(now quoted list)|point-here| ;; Region still highlighted and you can continue typing like normal   Note that the quote is inserted before the mark.

emacs,2yie8r,agumonkey,5,Tue Mar 10 03:34:33 2015 UTC,"Don't apologize, Emacs is very large, people still learn about small functions like these even after years of usage.  Took me 3-5 years to finally get used to apropos, describe-function (C-h f), describe-mode (C-h m) to the point it becomes a free and enjoyable reflex.  I have the same reflex when I write code, I start with clean ideas but reality turns it into mud. When you get it to work, you can start to optimize (syntax, performance, documentation, etc ...).  Use let as much as possible, it will avoid you some bugs, since setq allows modification of variables outside the current scope. Changing since far away is often dangerous because you can't reason about the code you're reading without reading everything else."

If you want to pass nil nil nil to 'set-window-fringes in your hook, do this:  (add-hook 'text-mode-hook (lambda () (set-window-fringes nil nil nil)))   The docs:  (add-hook HOOK FUNCTION &optional APPEND LOCAL)  Add to the value of HOOK the function FUNCTION. FUNCTION is not added if already present. FUNCTION is added (if necessary) at the beginning of the hook list unless the optional argument APPEND is non-nil, in which case FUNCTION is added at the end.  The optional fourth argument, LOCAL, if non-nil, says to modify the hook's buffer-local value rather than its global value. This makes the hook buffer-local, and it makes t a member of the buffer-local value.  That acts as a flag to run the hook functions of the global value as well as in the local value.  HOOK should be a symbol, and FUNCTION may be any valid function.  If HOOK is void, it is first set to nil.  If HOOK's value is a single function, it is changed to a list of functions."

emacs,2y469e,MonsieurBanana,12,Sat Mar 7 10:26:42 2015 UTC,"Mostly replying to your second concern...  The ""window"" system is a 1970s interface.  Created at a time when there wasn't a mouse, only a keyboard, and the monitor was a monochrome green phosphor display with 80 columns and 24 lines.  Let that sink in:  80 columns and 24 lines.  (If you weren't unlucky enough to have an even smaller display!)  And emacs interface was (originally) designed around this.  ""Window layout"" would be perfectly ridiculous in such an environment.  It wasn't a design consideration for the interface.  But that was then.  And now we do have a mouse, and much more powerful displays.  And support has been added for these things.  But that doesn't change the original design philosophy, or the core mode of interaction in the human/computer interface, even if it does allow a lot more possibilities in that space.  So many possibilities in fact, that newer users never have to learn the original core mode of interaction, and being more familiar with the things-must-be-visible-in-order-to-click-on-them interfaces of better displays and the mouse and touch-screen, see the original mode as dated and clunky.  I'll grant it is dated.  But that original mode of interaction is far from clunky.  In fact, it's a highly polished interface with over 3 decades of refinement.  But it is a different computer interaction philosophy than you are used to.  And unfortunately, I'm not sure how exactly I can describe the differences, to communicate past your prejudices (instilled by every other computer interface you've likely experienced), without sounding like some out-of-touch old-timer.  But I'll give it one go, with a terrible food metaphor...  Modern interfaces are more like a buffet table, with the food spread out across its surface.  Your attention is your plate (which is also likely your mouse-cursor), and to acquire some specific item from the table, you hover it over the item, transfer the food to your plate (click on it) and then proceed to dine (read/edit).  Emacs 1970s interface is more like a Star Trek food replicator.  Your plate (attention) is a fixed point, and you just ask the machine to provide the item you're interested in, and it is deposited directly on the plate, where you can dine (read/edit).  To not show so much prejudice myself, I will admit that the buffet-table style of interface has some advantages.  You can clearly see the most ""popular"" options.  You can group similar things together, and different things apart in different sections on the table (your ""window layout"") which can help you to better understand relationships, or enforce boundaries.  But on the other side, no table (display) is yet large enough to display all of your options.  And the larger that set grows, the harder it becomes to navigate with your plate.  Further you can only chew on (at least for the sake of this terrible metaphor) one food at a time, anyway...even if you bounce rapidly back and forth with your plate (attention).  Simply requesting what you need, when you need it, on-demand, saves you some motion, and frees up a lot of table (screen) space.  I don't want to say ""learn2emacs"" or ""you're doing it wrong"", for trying to impose the buffet table interface on emacs.  It's your computing and your interface.  The only right and wrong choices are what are right and wrong for you.  And emacs is so flexible that you can set it up to run just about any way that you'd like.  But I do want to suggest that there's another way of interacting with a machine.  A highly refined and sophisticated interface (which happens to be emacs native interface) exists, that you apparently haven't discovered or explored.  It's different than what you're used to, but it is by no means inferior.  (I personally find it superior, in most of the ways that matter to me.)  Anyway, tl;dr : a ""window layout"" is not emacs native interface, but something built over that surface.  And at least some of the problems you are experiencing with that come from your expectations about a different kind of interface, and lack of experience with the native one."
emacs,2y469e,forked_tongue,3,Fri Mar 6 17:48:21 2015 UTC,"with a terrible food metaphor   First off, this was an awesome metaphor.  Second off, can we please have more food-related explanations in the future."

Though, the point remains, that was a constraint the original interface was designed around, and it still works...if you were for some reason forced to use an old monitor today, you could still use emacs effectively, with it.  The second point about selection though is more contestable.  The amount of software you could be potentially running at once still dwarfs the available screen real estate.  Do you really have no buried tabs or windows?   Perhaps not, if you're running a high-resolution multi-monitor set-up...but even that would  probably be more distracting than helpful after a certain point. Abusing the food metaphor further:  there's not a table large  enough to hold every dish available in the world...and even if there was, it would be terrible to navigate.  The key point remains that your attention is a single point of focus.  You can rapidly shift focus, but unless you have a very unusual human neurology, you can't focus on 2 things at once.  Navigating by request is not necessarily more efficient (especially factoring in expected locations and ""muscle memory""), but it's certainly a lot more flexible (for either one-time, or changing needs) and a lot less cluttered.  Anyway, it's OK if you don't pursue learning the original mode of interaction.  I don't really expect to convince you...especially as I didn't really convert myself, until I was forced to, by travel, requiring remote access via a terminal emulator...first learning, then becoming proficient with, then coming to prefer ""the old ways.""  It's a philosophical shift in human/computer interaction, and a few words on an online forum are unlikely to have the leverage needed to convince you to reevaluate your whole perspective.  But I hope I've at least convinced you that another perspective exists...and that there might be some good reasons for certain default behaviors being what they are.  Though I also hope I've at least planted the seed of the idea that maybe there's another (possibly more powerful) way to interact with a machine, that might be worth your time to discover.

Windows in Emacs are lightweight, you open, close, transpose 'em all the time. Check out the winner mode - it helps to get back to the previous state easily. Once you accept the ""lightweightness"" of the window system - it becomes truly natural.  Otherwise you can always use dedicated windows and similar facilities to pin windows the way they are."

Let me try to explain with an example.  Suppose I have the following window layout:      +----------------------+------------------------+     |                      |                        |     |                      |       shell-mode       |     |                      |                        |     |     prog-mode        +------------------------+     |                      |                        |     |                      |       circe-mode       |     |                      |                        |     +----------------------+------------------------+   Regardless of which window is active at the moment, if I open a file that is handled by a mode deriving from prog-mode, the left window should be used to display that buffer.  Similarly, if I type C-x M (my shortcut for shell), the focus should be switched to the existing shell-mode window.  If I use C-c C-SPC (switch to an IRC buffer that has activity), the circe-mode window should switch buffer, not the buffer from which I issued the keybinding.  Of course, this would likely be a huge amout of work and would likely break the workflow of many people.  Still, that is a feature that I'd love to have, as it would allow me to setup a window layout for the work I'm doing and have it be unmodified as long as the buffers I manipulate are of modes compatible with the windows'."

Once you've got your preferred arrangement set up, using iswitchb or the buffer list will put the buffer in the current window. But when elisp code pops up a buffer automatically (e.g., when you invoke help, or inferior python mode, or shell, etc.) it'll appear in a window according to its major mode.

emacs,2y469e,kaushalmodi,2,Fri Mar 6 15:50:17 2015 UTC,"In many ways, Emacs makes me feel stuck in the 80s in a good way. ;-)  The biggest 80s drawback to me is font/graphics handling.  The assumption of fixed-width, single-size text is deeply embedded in Emacs' world, while a modern word processor or web browser handles variable-width text of all sizes and images.  Most of the time I'm editing code, so it doesn't matter, but when Info, AucTeX, or something deposits big fonts or images in a buffer, it's just ugly.  I don't think there's a better way -- it's just the price you pay.  If you want a different trade-off, use a different editor."
emacs,2y469e,forked_tongue,2,Fri Mar 6 20:11:08 2015 UTC,"What I don't like is the piss-poor discoverability.  The 20 or 30 commands you use frequently - that's fine, you memorise them. The long tail of commands you might want to use once a fortnight, month or more? You can't just find them by exploring menus quickly.  Because it isn't OOP, if you want to do some operation on a buffer or on a paragraph or whatever, you can't just ""autocomplete"" on the thing you want to operate on and then select a sensibly chosen verb that applies to the thing. Instead, the verbs are all in splendid isolation from each other and finding them requires either arcane help commands, or more likely, just google it.  This gets quite irritating after a while. You feel like the editor has all this functionality, but because there is simply no way I can actually memorise 300 keyboard shortcuts and M-x commands, my usage amounts to being not that much more advanced over bloody notepad.   So as a result I mainly use emacs only when I want to apply a macro (one of the few things I have memorised, macros are very useful). If eclipse or the like actually developed a decent macro system I'd have no reason to use emacs left."
emacs,2y469e,JetSetWilly,4,Sat Mar 7 03:58:36 2015 UTC,There are many packages that can help you discover commands.

However, that's after already being proficient with buffer navigation and emacs help and self-documentation systems...which is no small hurdle (especially for newer users!)  The emacs tutorial tries to push folks over that hurdle...but starting a rigid tutorial is not how most folks are used to getting acclimated to new software, these days.  RTFM may be appropriate for professional engineers, but it's not even an understood acronym for a newbie.  But anyway, yes M-x apropos is amazing.

For stuff that I use rarely, I at least know part of the name of the command and can filter for that in M-x. I use smex, so all the commands are in an ido minibuffer and I can filter for the command, even if I only know part of its name.  For example, if I want shell-command-on-region but can't remember the name exactly, I do M-x shell C-SPC region to filter all commands that have both shell and region in their name."
emacs,2y469e,kraml,3,Fri Mar 6 22:43:25 2015 UTC,"Sure. If I want to do something in eclipse, or any other modern gui really, that I do rarely - such as ""tell maven to fetch all dependencies for this project"" or ""find everything that mentions this token in this package"" - then in a GUI, which i guess is inherently ""object orientated"", you can generally just right click on the thing that you want to operate on, and very often find the thing you want to do after a bit of poking about.  Perhaps it is a spacial memory versus a verbal memory thing as well. In emacs it can be quite difficult to know even what to search for! You resort to - as you illustrate - searching for a flat list of all commands relating to a wide term like ""shell"" or ""buffer"" or whatever. If your verbal memory is good enough, you can further refine it as you did, if it isn't, youa re all at sea and it is off to help pages or google, breaking your flow.  It seems like the classic text editors (such as vim and emacs) really reward great knowledge of frequently used commands by making them fast to use and always immediately available and composable.  But modern IDEs and gui just seem to be better at this ""long tail"" of complex and less frequently used stuff.   Because they are more ""object orientated"" (shit term but you know what I mean) you can directly interact with the things you are using, and even use a foggy spatial memory of ""I right click here and then there and there was something like this here I think?"" - whereas emacs necessarily demands a more precise recollection of what to search for to aid discoverability.  That's fine, it is just a trade-off but in some ways emacs makes things more stark by verging on IDE-like complexity itself, without the ease of use aids."
emacs,2y469e,tuhdo,3,Fri Mar 6 23:15:30 2015 UTC,"Some kind of ffap for elisp functions.  Emacs suffers from a lack of grammarization / categorization. It's a bazaar of non namespaced functions. Nowadays people try to use clearer names (file.el, s.el, dash.el). It's still not contextual like object.verb, but it's not surprising since Emacs is built on lisp and lisp is not OO centric."
emacs,2y469e,kcin,2,Fri Mar 6 23:26:14 2015 UTC,"Good point, now I understand. Interesting though that different people run into different issues.

If you are new, most of the ""visual objects"" are just strange icon with a short label when you hover over them. In the end, you still have to read the manual that comes with the editor or google things up anyway. Say, for example, you are used to Eclipse; but would you be learning as fast when moving to Visual Studio with all (maybe) new or old ""visual objects"" presented in a different way?"

Why should you know the exact name of every command if you can easily get to the one you want with completion?  Also, you can define name aliases for the less frequently used commands if you find the default name obscure and want to give them a better name which helps you to find them easier later. E.g:  (defalias 'turn-all-first-letters-into-capitals-in-region 'capitalize-region)   (The example may not be the best, but you get the point.)"

Using your examples, C-x 0 seems a obvious binding to me for closing the current window as 0 can be associated to the opposite of presence of something or killing or closing of something. C-x 1 actually makes your current window the only ONE window in the frame, which emacs implements using the command delete-other-windows. Now, if you associate this binding with the ""ONE window"" reference, doesn't it make more sense? In other cases it is just muscle memory that helps you remember the bindings. The more bindings you start using, the more your ""muscles will memorize"".   If you say that macros are the only reason you are stuck with emacs, then I frankly believe that you need to explore more of emacs; look what new packages are out there, look what new features emacs has to offer, browse sites like emacs.stackexchange.com and this sub-reddit.

I'm new to Emacs and a lot of the time I feel like it was made by people living on a different planet.

What sort of page are you getting this error on? Are you getting this error when connected to the ""demo"" page (run-skewer)? If it's your own page, some security-related header or setting may be forcing Skewer to evaluate expressions in strict mode (not useful), which may lead to this sort of error message.

emacs,2xw0cr,Ironballs,1 point,Sun Mar 8 09:38:26 2015 UTC,"I'm getting no lag for flx-ido-mode (which is even more time-consuming than basic ido) with 20000 candidates.   Have you tried anything beyond that? i.e. something with 40k files. And the lag happens when you start editing your current matching pattern rather than inserting new character to narrow down further. For example, you are currently having ""document"" as a pattern; now, move point and delete some characters, or insert new characters in the middle of your old pattern. It starts lagging and soon hang Emacs. I've just tried Ido on Linux source tree and it locks Emacs as soon as I typed a few characters.   For 80000 candidates, the lag is the same with helm as with ido, the difference is that helm updates the entered text (while there are no candidates visible) through the lag, while ido waits for the actual candidates to show up before it updates the text.   I had no lag, even with fuzzy matching. I tested it by running setting projectile-require-project-root to nil, and then wait for Projectile to collect all the files. It took a while (around 85k files), but once it's done, I can narrow every thing just fine, even with fuzzy matching, no significant lag that can be perceived. It's possible that you did not limit the number of candidates in Helm (as you said in some other thread). I limited it to 100 for fuzzy matching. At least, I can have 100 candidates and be able to scroll up/down. With Ido, at best I have 10-20 candidates and no page scrolling, and still lagginng. I cannot even mark and open two or more files at once. I open multiple files frequently and hate to enter file paths all over again to open it."

I used fountain-mode, but probably didn't use it properly. Does it not align everything as we write? Or does it take care of the formatting once the file is exported? Could you share your screenwriting experience on emacs?"
emacs,2xw0cr,tty-tourist,5,Thu Mar 5 03:37:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, fountain-mode aligns and highlights as you write, as long as you use some basic and pretty intuitive conventions. This is it, really. The gist of it is that you just write and fountain does the formatting.  You can use fountain in any editor but fountain-mode adds some nice features besides highlighting, including folding of scenes for better overview and structure editing. See all features by hitting C-h m when you're in fountain-mode.  After installation, remember to add this to your init to use fountain-mode when editing any .fountain file:  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(""\\.fountain$"" . fountain-mode))   Also check out the minor mode Olivetti (from Melpa) to get a nice writing environment with a text body of 68 chars width (or whatever you prefer) centered in the window.  Normally I start brainstorming and outlining in org-mode and export the text that is on its way to becoming a screenplay when the advantages of using the fountain-mode features exceed the advantages of having the whole project in a single .org file. But it pains me every time an .org file is split - and I've found a way to avoid it:  Fountain can be contained within a source block in the org-file and it can be edited with fountain-mode by pressing C-c ' which will open a buffer a new buffer. C-c ' in that buffer will save the edit to the org buffer and you will return to that.  An example:  #+Title: My great shark movie * Characters * Outline * Financing * Notes from Mike * Screenplay ** 1. draft #+BEGIN_SRC fountain EXT. BEACH  SAILOR BOB (60-ish) gazes across the ocean.  SAILOR BOB (flabbergastedly) I'll be damned! Floating triangles!  #+END_SRC   To try for yourself, copy the text above to an org-mode buffer and hit C-c ' within the source block (presuming you have fountain-mode installed.)  If you decide to go ahead with this, there are a few variables to look into. Here are my:  ;;; ... settings for working with (fountain) source blocks in org. ;;; Prevent org from messing with indentation of the source text. (setq org-src-preserve-indentation t) (setq org-edit-src-content-indentation 0)  ;;; Open the buffer for editing fountain in another window. (setq org-src-window-setup (quote current-window)  ;;; Prevent a message in the edit buffer from being shown. ;;; Before using this, you should memorize these two binds: ;;; C-c '     : keep edits and return to org buffer ;;; C-c C-k   : cancel edits and return to org buffer (setq org-edit-src-persistent-message nil)  ;;; Save edits in the fountain buffer to the org buffer after x sec (setq org-edit-src-auto-save-idle-delay 200)"

emacs,2xw0cr,StudentRadical,18,Thu Mar 5 05:15:45 2015 UTC,"Hmm.  Well, you're talking about the initial learning portion and complaining that the amount of stuff you're hitting is overwhelming, but I think that most people, including me, want to give a summary of all of the overall ""wish I'd known it first"" stuff, even for more-advanced users.  Here are the bits that I'd suggest for a new user:   Try to stick with vanilla emacs where possible.  If you go to emacswiki, it's a list of every irritation that people have had, and it makes it sound like emacs is full of terrible limitations and you need to have Joe's Cool Package.  Broadly-speaking, the really-important stuff is in emacs.  If you've already tried the vanilla emacs version of a feature and decided that it's insufficient, then go off trying all the add-ons.  A lot of the add-ons are a bit difficult to appreciate and trouble-shoot if you have zero emacs familiarity.  Projectile and magit will be frequently-recommended external packages on here, and I do use them and they're nice tools for software development.  But you'll want to learn git-without-magit first anyway, and that itself is a pretty large thing to learn. Learn the help system.  This is one of the first things to do, and helps a lot in not leaving you clueless.  I waited too long to do this.  Important: C-h k (""what does this key do""), C-h m (simple mode help), C-h b (every keybinding in the current mode), C-h w (what key is bound to this command), C-h a (what is the command named this).  To a lesser degree, C-h v (what is the variable named this), and C-h f (what is the function named this).  Know that, and it makes learning everything else a lot easier. You aren't going to learn everything immediately.  I thought ""oh, it might take a year of use or two"" when I started out.  It's going to take more just take a year to ""learn emacs"".  I still don't use things that lots of people say are ""must use"", and I've been banging away on emacs for most of my day for almost twenty years.  Don't worry about it; a slowly-expanding repertoire is just part of emacs use. If you can deal with it, I'd advise against alternative keybinding schemes, like evil (keep in mind that I wasn't coming to emacs from vim-land) or cua-mode.  They might work fine with the basic environment, but other packages are going to follow standard emacs conventions.  Remember that a lot of people have been using the standard keybindings for a long time, and have smoothed out the quirks: usually, they aren't as insane as they may seem off-the-bat. I'm going to disagree with others on elisp.  Don't try to learn it right away.  I wish that I'd learned it sooner than I did, but not to the point of being able to write code during my first year or so on emacs.  There is enough of a workflow to jam into your head without learning the programming language as well.  Though being able to read the source of everything makes for a hell of a help function, when you do pick it up.   And here for the rest, including not just-starting-on-emacs bits:   Dired is useful, and it took me far too long to start using it.  I do think that it is one of the packages that deserves some changes to its defaults: its out-of-box state (e.g. expending most screen space showing file sizes instead of filenames, limited highlighting, doesn't default to using a dired in the other window as a target for renames, etc) made it a bit uncomfortable to use at first for me.  It's not something that needs to be learned to use emacs for other things, though. You are going to want to very-seriously-consider either swapping Caps Lock and Control or doing something similar.  I and many other people have picked up RSI, and we aren't particularly-fragile humans.  Control on a PC keyboard is in an absolutely-horrible place for the heavy use that emacs demands of it, and Caps Lock gets little use from most users. C-SPC to set mark and M-w to shove the region (area between point and mark) into the kill ring and C-w to kill the region into the kill ring are things that I use frequently, but took a long time to learn. Use registers.  The name was a bit off-putting, and I first glommed onto the somewhat-similar bookmarks feature.  Registers (both to save text, and to save several positions in a buffer during a session to jump back) have seen much more use from me than bookmarks. longlines mode for word wrap is dead.  I spent ages banging my face into it.  Don't use it.  Visual-line-mode is what you want. Depending upon your usage patterns, it may be valuable to be able to use emacs in a terminal.  If that is the case, avoid relying upon features that are not available in the terminal, like the fringe.  Then, when you need to use a box via ssh or similar, you aren't left unable to do work.  I kind of wish that there were a ""terminal-fringe"", where a keystroke could hide or show a one-column line of characters along the side, but I fear that the fringe has dedicated itself to be pixel-based. Org-mode gets a lot of buzz.  It really is nice, but I (and I suspect most people) use only a small subset of its functionality: I use it mostly as an outliner. I do not like gnus as a mail reader.  It is a newsreader that can be used as a mail reader, and is just IMHO infuriatingly sluggish, even after tweaking.  Lots of its functionality is designed for newsreader use, and I imagine that it's competent at that.  Probably the single biggest black hole of time I spent on emacs before throwing my hands up in disgust.  I use mu4e today, which I'm happy with (and which had a remarkably short time to come-up-to-speed)."

emacs,2xw0cr,---R,3,Thu Mar 5 03:48:54 2015 UTC,"Emacs historically ran as a program in a world where only text terminals existed -- simple, stupid computers that could only show maybe a screen of 80 characters across by 24 charaters high.  You'd hook the text terminal up to a ""real"" computer, and software would run on a real computer.  While physical text terminals have pretty much gone the way of the dodo -- a fully-blown computer is so cheap that everyone has one -- a lot of software was written in this era, and a lot of things modeled around it.  Unix in particular has a lot of ties to this sort of environment.  In this sort of structure, a server will be running software -- a webserver, like Apache, or emacs, or some other software package, often for a number of different users.  No monitor is attached: the thing stands alone.  The end user will start a ""terminal emulator"" program on his desktop which acts as if it were one of the old text terminals above -- this might be gnome-terminal on Linux, or PuTTY on Windows, or any number of other packages.  These days, there's normally no physical serial line running from the desktop -- instead, the desktop and the server will both be connected to the Internet, and a program called ""ssh"" will be used to connect the terminal emulator to the server.  The user will then use software within a window that displays simply text.  For some users, this is a very important part of their workflow.  Unix sysadmins, a number of software developers, scientific computing people, and so forth normally have software that runs on a headless server somewhere, and so being able to comfortably edit text on a machine on the other side of the world it is important.  For other users, this is not important: if they will only ever be using emacs locally, they have the ability to let emacs run on their local computer and pop up windows and dialogs and so forth.  Emacs can run in both modes: if run in a terminal, it will use text characters.  If run locally, it still shows mostly text, but it can show images embedded in the window, use a feature called the ""fringe"" that puts a thin sidebar down the side of the window, use different font sizes, and do some other graphical things that can't be done in a text terminal.  If this doesn't mean a lot to you, chances are pretty good that you're okay with using emacs in a windowed environment, and you don't need to worry about sticking to a terminal environment."

It was one of the first terminals to support ANSI escape codes for cursor control and other tasks, and added a number of extended codes for special features like controlling the LED lamps on the keyboard. This led to rapid uptake of the ANSI standard, becoming the de facto standard for terminal emulators.  The VT100s, especially the VT102, was extremely successful in the market, and made DEC the leading terminal vendor for some time. The VT100 series was replaced by the VT200 series starting in 1983, which proved just as successful. Ultimately, over six million terminals in the VT series would be sold, based largely on the success of the VT100s.

If you have added melpa as a package archive you should be able to get any of these from the built in package manager (I'm not sure if they're in any other archives too).  Point 2... what you seem to be encountering is that evil has a ""motion"" state which is distinct from ""normal"", and is used in buffers you are expected to move around in but not edit (such as help buffers).  I assume you've probably bound your key in evil-normal-state-map... you'll also have to bind it in evil-motion-state-map if you want it to work in those buffers.  Point 3... (kbd ""K"") should work, yes, and I'm not sure why it wouldn't, without seeing the code.  Sorry :(  Point 4... progn is simply a wrapper that turns a sequence of code into a single form, for use where only a single form is allowed.  For example, the true branch of an if only allows a single form, so if you want to do more than one thing you can wrap it in a progn.  Hope this helps :)"

That said, the motion basics are find once you get used to them, and it turns out they end up showing up in other useful places, most notably bash and all standard OS X text widgets (which is almost all of them, so basically everywhere if you use a mac), so I'd recommend strongly considering sticking with at least the basic motion keybindings.  The one thing that drives me crazy is ""C-x o"" for other window, so I redefine it to simply ""M-o"" (and ""M-O"" to go the previous window). Then I end up accidentally running the face selection stuff a lot when I'm on a stock emacs, which is the default binding M-o.  (That you would use such a valuable, easy-to-hit keybinding for a command you will almost never use while a command you use literally every 10 seconds is relegated to a clunkier sequence is pretty emblematic of how not-very-well-thought-out the emacs keybindings are.)"

Seriously, look no further than what is currently being developed and the default key bindings (or suggestions) that they defined.  Do they make sense?  For instance, in multiple cursors, C-> makes a new cursor on the next line?  Oh, that is because if there is an active selection it will make a new cursor at the next match.  And we use C-> for that because C-. will expand the active selection so it's only a shift away on most keyboards?  Why that?  Who knows, probably copying some other editor.  VI/Vim benefits from some better overarching design of the way you edit text.  One of the prices you pay when you allow everybody to drastically redefine their editor to their own liking is that people will actually do it and they might not make the best design decisions in the process."

There was a source-code tagging system like Etags and a mail system like Rmail (called ""Babyl""). There was a learn-by-doing tutorial, but it was a separate executable.  There was no syntax highlighting though as there were no colour terminals. Programming modes didn't have all the features they have now, they could do some indentation though. There was no shell mode because ITS didn't have a shell, but there were lisp-interaction modes.  The source code in TECO is really incomprehensible.  See this archive here: http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/mit_emacs_170_teco_1220/  The keybindings are in the file ""info:emacs.keys.1"".

In my case, q is the same as i in stock Vim: q is for entering insert mode, because i is used for move one line up. It's quite efficient, since q is above a and both are used for entering inserting mode in a slightly different fashion.

Emacs commands are too specific, and there are cases that you can group 3 or 4 functions in just one depending on the context. For example: just-one-space, delete-blank-lines, and delete-horizontal-space; or beginning-of-defun and backward-paragraph; or kmacro-start-macro and kmacro-end-macro (with one key you can switch on/off the macro recording)."

emacs,2xgzxr,RobThorpe,18,Sat Feb 28 19:42:30 2015 UTC,"Unexec is ugly, but it's necessary. Without it Emacs would have to load every .elc file when it started. That would take ages. Unexec's purpose is to compensate for a common deficiency in operating systems.  I'm not impressed by this whole ""horrors"" business. It seems that modern programmers are immune to the horrors they create because they consider them necessary. Earlier programmers considered the horrors they created to be necessary too, and they were right just as often as modern programmers are.  Take web programming, for example. It's horrible. To begin with, you have ill-thought out languages like Javascript. There are things like verification done twice once in the browser then again at the server in a different language. Then you have front-ends done two or three times in different dialects of javascript, then again for handhelds/tablets or ""web frameworks"" that do that kind of stuff internally.  All of this is justified by necessity, to a large extent that's correct. But, in a few years time it won't be. When that happens the code will still be there because the programmers involved will understand it and see no reason to dispense with it. The same is true of older hacks. The Emacs maintainers could delete most of the unexec* files that deal with OSes that are no-longer supported.  That would make unexecing a smaller wart, but it wouldn't really be helpful."
emacs,2xgzxr,hvis,3,Sat Feb 28 20:47:55 2015 UTC,"That's an isolated feature, implemented in ~1000 lines of C, that only affects the rest of how Emacs works in a positive way. If that's not elegant, I don't know what is.  It might sound peculiar, but as soon as computers are fast enough to boot Emacs fast enough without dumping it first, this part can just be dropped. Another couple of decades might do that."
emacs,2xgzxr,RobThorpe,7,Sat Feb 28 22:35:09 2015 UTC,"That's unlikely unfortunately. The problem is loading many .elc files. Each file open command takes quite a lot of time, even if the load itself could be made faster. One of the reason for that is that file open are system actions. The OS must have the information that a file is opened and must propagate it to every core. On some platforms like MS Windows a virus checker must be allowed to do it's thing in some cases too. These problems are likely to get worse not better in the future as the number of cores, threads and elc files rises. It may be possible to pack all the .elc files into one huge file though.  However, there are things that can be done. Several Common Lisp implementations and XEmacs have moved to using mmap to do dumping. This is cleaner. Once all of the systems Emacs supports have a suitable mmap command it could be done that way. Also, the use of system mallocs causes some problems. A fix for this has been found by the Cygwin Emacs maintainers. GNU Malloc is used for building Emacs and dumping and a switch is done to system Malloc after that. I understand that the other builds of Emacs are been moved to that system.  In the long run lots of other stuff could be done too. One possibility is compressing the strings in .elc files. If you look at some .elc files or at the Emacs binary you'll find that most of the space is taken up by docstrings. Using a simple dictionary compressor could save a huge amount of space. The decompression into the help-buffer could be imperceptible to the user."

At the end of the readme, I wonder about a usability improvement. We have the function discover-discover that links to the discover interface of other packages. It would nice if hitting ""q"" didn't quit everything but came back to the global discover-discover instead. Is it possible to achieve that ? With discover.el, with hydra ?

Many of us started with a semi-manual workflow if we want to amend an existing commit - commit the changes, then do a rebase with E and shuffle the commits around and set them to 'squash' or 'fixup' manually, but it can be much simpler with git autosquash and magit's commit options.  First thing, you need to enable autosquash in git:  git config --global rebase.autosquash true    When the commit log message begins with ""squash! …"" (or ""fixup! …""), and there is a commit whose title begins with the same …, automatically modify the todo list of rebase -i so that the commit marked for squashing comes right after the commit to be modified, and change the action of the moved commit from pick to squash (or fixup).   Then the fixup workflow becomes:   stage the code you want to add to an old commit c f, select the old commit  with .

Type the log message there, hit C-c C-c again, and you have committed the patch. This is not attached to magit, and works with any other vcs, and VC mode supports quite a few.  The main difference is that you can edit the patch arbitrarily. diff-mode lets you navigate hunks (M-n/M-p/M-N/M-P), delete hunks (M-k), split hunks (C-c C-s) and many other things. And you can just edit the patch like any other buffer.  When editing code, many people (myself included) end up making many unrelated changes simultaneously.

Usually for a package X, I have a setup-X.el. But I also have setup files like setup-editing.el, setup-search.el, etc which are collections of related packages and elisp snippets. I like to test out the latest emacs build from git while also using the stable version 24.4. So I have created a mechanism to have both versions running simultaneously without any conflicts.

And remember, though it's nice to be done with things, you can always re-visit and re-edit your organization if your needs or sensibilities change.  The above is the more helpful part of my reply (in my own opinion, anyway), but I will also share that I do something analogous to /u/tuhdo ...but I split things differently.  I use ""init.library.el"" files, where "".library."" varies by library, e.g. ""init.flymake.el"" and have lines in my init.el that look like this (continuing that example):  (autoload 'flymake-mode ""init.flymake"" ""Launch flymake with my tweaks."" t)   (Note that init.flymake.el is in my load path, so I don't use the "".el"" extension in that invocation.)  And init.flymake.el has all of my flymake-library-related (def)advice, supporting functions, variable adjustments, etc.  Additionally, I keep my customizations separate via:  ;; Keep the machine-generated custom initializations separate. (setq custom-file ""~/.emacs.d/customized.el"") (load custom-file)   ...because I (personally) never want to mix hand-edited code with machine-generated code, considering that a recipe for eventual despair.

When you pass the string ""\C-."", the escape sequence \C is parsed by emacs to the 0x03 byte (^C in ASCII), and since the rest of the characters are unescaped they're interpreted literally. So the actual sequence passed to global-set-key would be 0x03 (C-c) 0x45 (-) 0x56 (.).  What the kbd function does is translate a ""standard format"" emacs key sequence string like C-. into a raw string of characters, making it to copy-and-paste key sequences from the documentation and elsewhere, even when the sequences are a long chord sequence.

Having said that one of Emacs's greatest strengths is that it obviates the need for marking things explicitly if the syntactic unit(s) you want to kill -- be it a word, s-exp, paragraph or, yes, a line -- are possible with repeat calls to one or more commands. Typing C-S-backspace` three times will do what you want as would using digit arguments.  Finally I think C-w should kill the line if no region is active. I use an advised version of C-w I scrounged off, I think, Emacswiki 10+ years ago that does that. It is a perfect complement that lets you have your cake (kill lines) and eat it (kill region)"

Just pressing that three times is much more comfortable than my solution.  Digit arguments have always felt quite uncomfortable to me because I've always followed the manual's advice to use, say, C-u 3 C-n instead of C-3 C-n for compatibility with all terminals.  But maybe that's something I should stop.  I like the C-w to kill the line if the region is not active but I use C-x C-k for kill-region and C-w for backward-delete-word so it's not much of a speed improvement in my case.  And those bindings are etched very deep in my brain because I've had it since I started with Emacs.  I definitely enjoy having M-w copy the line if the region is not active though."

I tested in three different emacs, running on three different servers, two are inside of screen, one in tmux, using two different terminal emulators (because those were just the in-terminal emacs sessions I happened to have running at the moment) and C-S-backspace just did backspace in all three. Also no other combo with shift seems to work either, nor does C-backspace. Always lots of issues with keybindings in terminal emacs in my experience, but maybe I just never found the ""make emacs-keybindings work well"" option in the terminal emulator configs."

emacs,2wqgyt,ericjmr,1 point,Sun Feb 22 17:49:47 2015 UTC,"Plagiarizing earlier posts I wrote on this:  There are lots of built in facilities. I think the main thing is to become familiar with Emacs' general purpose commands. For example, M-a and M-e to move through sentences and M-{ and M-} to move backwards and forwards through paragraphs. M-/ (dabbrev) is useful to complete long words. In text-mode M-C-i completes a word using ispell mode, using the spelling program's dictionary.  Often text docs need to be divided into parts. In Emacs ""Pages"" can be used for this purpose. C-q C-l on a line by itself delimits a page. C-x ] and C-x [ move between pages, C-x C-p marks a whole page. Probably you don't want the page delimiters in the file, you can remove them at the end before publishing the file. Another useful trick if the file becomes long is to bookmark several places in it where you're working. Make each bookmark short, perhaps take the first letter of the game you're working on and the level number, e.g. ""R4"".  Emacs uses paragraphs divided by blank lines. If you use the sort of paragraphs that are divided by two spaces at the start then paragraph-indent-minor-mode will fix Emacs' behaviour to use those. Set it as a file-local variable if you need it.  Although Org and Outline-mode are ""formats"" they're often quite readable as they are. For example, using """" and ""*"" to delimit header levels is obvious, I do it in emails all the time to people who don't use Emacs. If you want a different style of header then do it in outline first then seach-and-replace at the end. This allows you to have section and sub-sections within your pages.  Another trick is to put in a specific word like ""FIXME"" near problems, then use highlight-regexp to make it very obvious. The highlight-regexp command can be put in an ""eval"" line the file-local section of the file itself. (See the manual ""specifying file variables"").  I use visual-line-mode for wrapping. There are four options.   Word-wrap, it inserts no newlines when a line wraps. When the wrap happens the last word is split across the two lines and an indicator is shown in the fringe. This splitting of words makes things hard to read. No wrapping. In this case RET and M-q are used to fill paragraphs. This is very manual and can be distracting. If you have to go back and add or remove text from a paragraph then you have to refill it with M-q. If you do M-q in the wrong place without noticing it can be disastrous, it destroys things like lists. I used to do this until there was visual-line-mode. Auto-fill-mode. This adds newlines when you get to the fill-column. It avoids the need to type RET, but suffers from the other problems of manual filling. You still often have to refill paragraphs with M-q. Visual-line-mode. This is just like word-wrap, but it doesn't split words, it always keeps them whole. It doesn't add newlines, a paragraph is just one long line like it is for word-wrap. The advantage of this is that it hardly ever needs manual intervention with M-q or anything else. If you need newlines in the final output then you can add them at the end using fill-region, that can be a bit tricky though.   Version control systems and VC mode are also useful."

I think I'd like to change the way emacs thinks about sentences and paragraphs. Could you share your knowledge about the way emacs handles text?   Yes.  By default Emacs uses a period and two spaces to end a sentence.  It uses an empty line to end a paragraph.  As I wrote above, if you use the sort of paragraphs that are divided by two spaces at the start then paragraph-indent-minor-mode will fix Emacs' behaviour to use those.  You can redefine it using a regexp if you're doing something really fancy.  Some people end sentences in a period and one space, to get Emacs to respect that set sentence-end-double-space to nil.  If you do that though then it can't tell the difference between abbreviations and sentence ends or between numbered lists (1. Like 2. This) and sentence ends.

The way to use org mode in my opinion is to set up capture templates directing notes and tasks quickly to the right files (whichever you like).  http://orgmode.org/manual/Capture-templates.html  You can then use the agenda to view, sort, filter, and search your notes and tasks.   http://orgmode.org/manual/Agenda-commands.html  Once you get used to adding things quickly and finding them quickly it all falls into place. You can even export your notes in various formats including ICS (calendar) files so you can view your appointments on your phone.  One major advantage Evernote has is of course a Mobile app. I get around this by renting a very cheap vps and ssh'ing to it to use emacs (from my phone, my Chromebook, or workstation). I use the vps for other things, too.  The other is the images. I really don't know how to handle that. Org mode has ways to link to files and other things but I haven't tried displaying them or otherwise wiring working with images.  This works for me and I love using emacs for this purpose.

Right off the bat - one mode I wish I had known when I started with org-mode is org-indent-mode. Do check that out.   Do I keep all my notes (which I have hundreds of in Evernote) in one file or in as many as I have notes?   That is up to you - I like to have seperate files for different major topics such as work/personal etc., but keep any notes that are at all related in the same file. org-narrow-to-subtree (C-x n s) and widen (C-x n w) are handy if you have large files with many headings and would like to focus on something specific.    Just opening and saving notes is quite a hassle in Emacs   If you have many files in some directory, maybe projectile and projectile-find-file (which is epic in combination with helm through helm-projectile-find-file) is worth looking into.   I cannot just drag and drop resources into a note anymore   Never tried it, but looks like others thought the same: https://github.com/abo-abo/org-download. See also http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InsertFileName for easier insertion of the name a some file.   The resources are not displayed inline   org-toggle-inline-images (C-c C-x C-v), org-toggle-pretty-entities (C-c C-x \) and org-preview-latex-fragment (C-c C-x C-l) come to mind. You can adjust the size of inline images with the variable org-image-actual-width. I use org-toggle-inline-images every now and then, but tend to hide the images while navigating or editing.   Navigating through notes   Using tags (C-c C-q), regexp, todos etc, you can use the ""sparse tree"" commands to narrow down what is visible (C-c / and C-c \). You can also ref to headlines using [[Some headline]] or set your own label <<somelabel>> and ref to it [[somelabel]]. You can also collapse to a comfortable level using S-tab a couple of times. C-c C-p and C-c C-n for navigating to previous/next headline and C-c C-u for ""up one level"" are worth mentioning.

emacs,2wh9o0,eeeickythump,8,Fri Feb 20 00:13:06 2015 UTC,"I've used orgmode a lot, Evernote only a little. Orgmode works best when your notes are stored as ""children"" within a single large outline (or a small number of outlines, e.g. one per large topic). Storing hundreds of individual files doesn't work so well.  It is possible for orgmode to display images inline by default - there is a variable that controls that (org-startup-with-inline-images) or you can put this line in your orgmode file:  #+STARTUP: inlineimages   You can apply multiple tags to items in orgmode files, although the tags are crowded onto the end of the item's headline so it can get cumbersome and ugly if an item has more than a handful of tags.  Adding notes can be done very efficiently in orgmode using the ""capture"" functionality. You can add notes based on different predefined templates by associating each template with a hotkey. You can even set up a bookmark in your web browser that will add highlighted text as a new orgmode note when you click it (see ""org-protocol"" in the manual).  The main problem with orgmode is that it is completely dependent on Emacs. Essentially no other program understands the orgmode format, beyond the fact that it is based on plain text. There is a mobile app (MobileOrg) but it seems to be seldom updated and I have not found it useful. There are also modules that attempt to integrate orgmode with Toodledo and Trello. However, if you rely on orgmode then you should be aware that it will be difficult for you to interact with your notes database when you are not sitting in front of a computer running Emacs.  For notes, I use SimpleNote (free, available for most platforms + web client, syncs your notes, plain text but also allows tagging of notes). For task management, orgmode is the most powerful piece of software available -- no contest -- but because of its mobile-unfriendliness I have ended up using OmniFocus instead (Mac/iOS only).  Another alternative to consider is Microsoft OneNote, which is free and is available on a lot of platforms. I don't think MS will be disappearing any time soon."

There is an app called MobileOrg (one for iOS, one for Android) which I've never tried, but people don't seem to like them very much. As for some of the things you mention:   I can embed as many pictures (just by pasting or drag&dropping pictures/PDFs or other resources into a note as I want, and most of them will be displayed inline)   Try using /u/abo-abo's org-download package. Here's a 90 second demo video.   I can attach tags to notes and search for notes by tags. This makes managing and finding hundreds of notes really easy.   Use Org Mode tags.   Do I keep all my notes (which I have hundreds of in Evernote) in one file or in as many as I have notes? Just opening and saving notes is quite a hassle in Emacs (C-x C-f and then navigating through the path to a specific file is just so much more work than just F6 in Everonet and typing in a tag name). I don't know if I want to keep pathes to notes in my mind constantly.   Here Org Mode forces you to decide how to organize instead of giving you a ready made choice (that you might not like). You should figure out how many files with what sort of items you want and setup capture templates to quickly send items to the right place and then view them in the agenda."

Just opening and saving notes is quite a hassle in Emacs (C-x C-f and then navigating through the path to a specific file is just so much more work than just F6 in Everonet and typing in a tag name). I don't know if I want to keep pathes to notes in my mind constantly.   I don't use Evernote or use org-mode in the fashion you're talking about, but I'd just create a bookmark (C-x r m while in the file) and then jump to it (C-x r b).   I cannot just drag and drop resources into a note anymore. I have to do something like this: ""[[C:\myResources\myResource.png][My Picture]]"" (First saving the resource in that resource folder, then specifying the path to it in emacs). Again, that's way too much work, but there may be a quicker way to do it?   I use emacs in a terminal, so I wouldn't know, but it looks like it.   The resources are not displayed inline. Though I've read that org-mode is capable of doing that (just images, I think), I have not gotten it to work yet. I haven't stop trying, however. It'd be nice if somebody could confirm that it is indeed possible though.   I use emacs in a terminal, again, but according to the manual you can toggle on inline images in org-mode with C-c C-x v, and you might want to just flip on org-startup-with-inline-images and leave it on if that's always what you want.   Navigating through notes (regardless of which method I choose to store notes (either one big file with 1 headline for each notes, or one file per note)) is something that I have yet to learn properly (I have just been using the cursor navigation shortcuts so far, haven't learned better/quicker ways yet (I know you can attach tags to headlines and then search for those, I think)   You don't want a file per note, I'm sure of that.

Alternatively look into the org mode syntax, it's slightly more complex than markdown, so that might be a problem.

For org-mode, I have the following config  (wrap-region-add-wrapper ""+"" ""+"" nil 'org-mode))) ; select region, hit + then region -> +region+ in org-mode   The problem is the even though I don't use + sign to wrap stuff in emacs-lisp-mode, the wrap-region package binds + to   (lambda (arg) (interactive ""p"") (wrap-region-trigger arg ""+""))   The wrap-region-trigger function figures out based on the major mode if the + key should wrap the text or not.  But that breaks when I try to enter + to do addition in rpn-calc.  The bigger problem is that I have most of the math-signs bound this way as org-mode uses those for formatting:  (wrap-region-add-wrapper ""="" ""="" nil 'org-mode) ; select region, hit = then region -> =region= in org-mode (wrap-region-add-wrapper ""*"" ""*"" nil 'org-mode) ; select region, hit * then region -> *region* in org-mode (wrap-region-add-wrapper ""/"" ""/"" nil 'org-mode) ; select region, hit / then region -> /region/ in org-mode (wrap-region-add-wrapper ""+"" ""+"" nil 'org-mode))) ; select region, hit + then region -> +region+ in org-mode   I'm not sure if you can fix rpn-calc to treat a + as literal + as in (insert ""+"") and not call the function + is bound to.

When I migrated from Vim to Emacs (More like experimenting with it) I used the default Emacs bindings from the start and got used to them. I didn't know at that time about Evil mode or more common, Viper mode. Which in the end was a good thing for me. I personally don't mind the Emacs bindings, though I do have some keyboard adjustments (e.g. C-q for delete backwards instead of backspace).  Though I've always missed the Normal / Insert mode that Vi(m) provides and created an incredibly sloppy elisp mode that changes all key strokes to control keystrokes (it was very early in my elisp days). However one day I came across God-mode https://github.com/chrisdone/god-mode which I still use today. God mode implements the Normal / Insert mode with your Control keys (customized as well) which is great. So now I'm still using Emacs keybindings but don't have to hold down control for everything.  At one point I tried Evil mode for a while, but found it more frustrating than helpful. Mainly because of the incompatibility between modes and I think I've come to prefer the Emacs way overall."

I've emailed the team responsible for the launchpad imports but they've been unresponsive.  I need to come up with a better solution for those imports, perhaps one that doesn't try to preserve the git history, which isn't really needed for a daily package build.

In Vim, I'm trying the minimalist approach - avoiding as many plugins as possible, and learning to write my short scripts usable for my personal workflow (c/c++, tex etc.), hooked with external tools.  In Emacs, I'm still at the stage of 'exploration' (plugins, how to set options), but I'm also reading the elisp intro and read various simple functions to get a feeling of the editor.  I think the experience of studying both editors is really great, allowing for a better picture of 'how an ideal editor should be'."
emacs,2w2bdd,VanLaser,2,Mon Feb 16 14:18:02 2015 UTC,"I get it. I decided to use Emacs as my default editor. But currently I'm still in the transition. Many things in my Emacs configuration needs to be polished yet.  So basically, you could say that I'm at the stage of set up. I like the other not-essentially features of Emacs, like Eshell (great for my taskwarrior), and ERC (chat channels inside window of Emacs).   I found Helm somewhat better than Unite, especially with Hydra for Evil keys navigation inside Helm."
emacs,2w2bdd,ReneFroger,2,Mon Feb 16 14:33:52 2015 UTC,"[sry for the slightly off-topic post]  Yes, i like the Helm & Unite ""paradigm"". Digging a little, I found out about the inspiration (when Helm was 'Anything'): the Quicksilver launcher (I don't work on Macs, so didn't know about it before).  Actually, it would be quite cool if an editor implementation with start by providing a Unite/Helm/Quicksilver interface as a core feature by default (internal, fast etc.) so that it would provide a standard interface for searching, filtering, providing sources and so on ... without plugin creators inventing a zillion ways of performing operations and greatly simplifying the key bindings. It could even be an external launcher (as quicksilver), but one which can tightly work with the editor (know how to split the atom window for example). I think neovim has its eyes on Unite, i just hope it can bring its type of functionality closer to its editor core."

Use let instead:  (defun fill-character (char)     ""Fill the line (till fill-column) with the specified character""     (interactive ""cEnter character for filling: "")     (let ((n (- fill-column (current-column))))       (insert-char char n)))   Although I must say that if a value is used only once, I usually prefer not to create a variable binding at all, I just calculate it where it’s needed:  (defun fill-character (char)   ""Fill the line (till fill-column) with the specified character""   (interactive ""cEnter character for filling: "")   (insert-char char (- fill-column (current-column))))   Second, don’t put closing parentheses on a separate line. When working with Lisp code, try to ignore the parentheses and just look at the indentation. If you do that, you’ll soon realise that a closing parenthesis on its own line is visual noise. It’s distracting rather than helpful.  The best way to deal with parentheses in Lisp is to let Emacs do it. Use autopair or smartparens or some other mode for automatically matching parentheses."

emacs,2vx5yr,RobThorpe,1 point,Sun Feb 15 21:57:33 2015 UTC,"I see.  The old-school way of doing this would be to load all the files into Emacs with something like ""C-x C-f *.el"". Then use ""multi-occur-in-matching-buffers"" to produce a list of matching lines, then press ""e"" in the occur buffer to enter occur edit mode. Then use M-% to search-and-replace.  This would undoubtedly be slower than the way the Vim user did it and probably slower than using Helm-Ag (which I've never used).  That's even if the multi-occur command were bound to a key. It would only work for the number of files you can load into Emacs. That said, this kind of simple text substitution is only really safe if the number of files is small.  I'm not convinced that it's a very realistic scenario though."

emacs,2vx5yr,CodyChan,1 point,Mon Feb 16 05:05:39 2015 UTC,"A different way to approach the same problem....  To begin with, put all your emacs config into one file.  In Emacs it's easy to navigate a large file. You can separate the logical sections with page breaks, ^L and use the page navigation commands. Or, you can use outline-minor-mode and separate things using an bullet-point structure. If you want to get really fancy you can use literate programming with Org mode.  I choose the first option and separate sections into pages.  Emacs config should not be too complex anyway. A complex config is a huge time-sink.  If you do that you can simply use ""M-s o"" to search for a string, then enter editable occur mode with ""e"".  Then use M-% to search-and-replace.

But I will do the rename refactoring after finishing the TODOs.  As said in the limitation, the plan is to use GNU Global for fast indexing and Semantic for filtering. The problem with Semantic is that it tries to parse everything and block Emacs. To solve this problem, when traverse for refactoring, we disable parsing and just parse needed regions to check if such a region is valid.  There are more to refactoring than just mass renaming. One common refactoring task that no tool in Emacs does properly is generate class/function implementation. member-functions.el can only generate implementation for rudimentary class; it cannot handle nested classes and template class and the output has spaces everywhere. These little tasks (implement class, extract functions/macro...) are more common than mass refactoring of a codebase."

This can be doable with C but for C++, it's a whole different level. Putting effort on this issue alone would be equal to efforts on every other useful features. And surely nobody wants partially worked solution.   you could prompt at every place that gets renamed   I already planned a rename interface that separate places to be renamed into 2 groups:   Safe: this group is guaranteed to change without breaking anything. Unknown: this group contains hits listed by GNU Global but Semantic cannot decide whether to rename or not. This is left to the user.

On my typing days I use a kinesis keyboard with the triple foot pedals. If you haven't used a kinesis keyboard before it's basically the ultimate emacs keyboard, and also the only one that I know of that has a study behind it showing that it helps prevent RSI. The keyboard lets you remap keys in hardware (you press a special programming key, then the key for the functionality you want, then the key that you want to have trigger that functionality), and the foot pedals that you can buy for it are integrated with the remapping functionality so you don't even have to install any software to get the foot pedals to work or to remap keys. The operating system just sees a normal USB keyboard.   I bind my 3 pedals to control shift and alt. I do this because I've noticed that key combinations that require holding down a key are the most painful, and I suspect the emacs defaults were a significant contributor to my RSI (if it were up to me something like fingers mode or viper mode would be default, the efficiency versus reduced injury risk is worth it). I say this as someone who already had capslock rebound to control to prevent ""emacs pinky."" So readers beware: rebinding capslock to control is not enough, you also need an ergonomic keyboard.  I would be wary of cheap USB foot pedals if you intend to use them for modifier keys. I bought one such cheap set only to find that it couldn't handle two pedals being pressed at once, so lots of emacs key combinations wouldn't work. The kinesis pedals don't have this problem. On the other hand the cheap pedals let you let you bind them to mouseclicks and the kinesis pedals do not.   I keep the cheap USB foot pedals around because I use one of them for the down key. It's great for web browsing to lean back and read a long page while just tapping your foot every now and then."

Something with a spring in it, shaped like a triangle, with a decent driver will probably work just as well, but I don't know for sure.

So when I pressed the pedal down, and hit ""x"" on my keyboard, emacs would receive a ""control"" and an ""x"" but not a C-x.  I installed Karabiner and that fixed the problem (on account of it replacing the keyboard driver).  Using a pedal was easier on my wrists, but it was substantially slower to use compared to the keyboard alone.  If you're experiencing pain, it will help. If you are just interested, skip it."

Using the foot pedal was slower than using the keyboard, because it's harder for me to coordinate my hands and feet (experienced piano or drum set players may fare better), and the layout of the Kinesis was sufficient to reduce the strain on my wrists.

You have to learn to use your feet, you have to learn to NOT reach for Esc and Ctl and Alt with your hands, and you have to find the right place for the pedals.

I suppose you can use multi-web-mode to write your code, and then copy it to another file when you have what you need.  Edit: there's also skewer mode, which allows you to evaluate javascript just like you would eval some lisp code. It looks pretty cool, but I'd prefer to see my changes on the fly instead of having to constantly reevaluate everything.

Apple did try to contribute patches for making GCC interoperable with tools but the community was against this design decision (this is no longer the case as GCC is dying, but now it is too late).   It turns out, that compiling C++, even tho hard, is a small part of the big picture. You need to offer code completion, documentation generation, code formatting, enforcing coding styles, static analysis, safe refactoring, run-time analysis, unit testing coverage... all these made people more productive. Compiling the code is actually a tiny fraction of what is necessary in any medium sized project.   Before Clang, other open source projects had to invest a huge amount of time and effort into crappy reimplementations of a C++ compiler front-end to try and partially solve these other problems that GCC did not address. When C++11 arrived, they couldn't keep up. GCC wasn't there to help them, but Clang was (e.g. see Doxygen, KDevelop, ...).  It turned out, that clang did not only allow people to solve all these problems, it also was a fine C++ compiler back then.  So to answer your question is Clang killing GCC? GCC made a decision, to be on purpose and by design not interoperable. This worked fine during the GCC monopoly, the fact that there was nothing else to use doesn't mean that the decision was right. Clang just proved that the decision was, in fact, wrong. GCC has realized this too late, but no, Clang did not kill GCC, GCC killed himself.  People have been writing emacs extensions for a long time and this extensions have always come into the Emacs mainline at some point. The fact that all these extensions that make emacs interoperable with almost anything are allowed in, but those that make emacs interoperable with clang, lldb, llvm... must stay out because they are the enemy is just a bad decision. It is making emacs worse, on purpose. Emacs should learn from GCC and not make the same mistake. Otherwise we will be asking ourselves the question did Y kill emacs in XX years."

See the recent debate about exporting the whole symbol table.   It is clear that RMS is blindly unware of what programmers of today need in order to do things like large scale refactoring on complex OO projects. And his decisions which seem largely driven out of fear of someone somewhere using GCC to compile code that isn't GPL3 is what is killing GCC.

And object-code emitter. And debugger.  Because hopefully it is really fucking obvious by now, these are insanely useful things to have. People are incorporating them everywhere.   GCC had two decades to make this sort of code a reality, and basically make LLVM's redundant before it existed. But they didn't, and whether they like LLVM's license or not, they've fallen on their own sword because of it. Purely pragmatically, this will always be a popularity contest - who's tool is the most useful? And GCC is purposely choosing to lose it."

The quality standards of open source projects are high (which is a good thing), that doesn't mean that code hacked over a weekend to solve a clients problem by monday is bad. It just means that someone has to put the effort of cleaning the code, going through peer review, documenting it, ensuring unit-test coverage, ... this takes time and money.   At the same time, contributing the code back means that you don't have to maintain a fork of the project anymore and keep it up to date, which also takes time and money.  Showing people that it is worth to do so is IMO enough. Some will never contribute anything back, most I believe they do.

They would sell you a pound of snow for 1000,000 if they could. The only thing stopping them from doing that is another commercial company selling for 999,999.  Free Software has no money-making agenda. They don't care if they make a product so good, that it needs no updates and there's no more money to be made. Planned obsolescence is not an issue. So theoretically, once there exists a Free Software project, there's no point in starting a new one to do the same thing, since all of us have an agenda to make the best product possible, not just to push our thing to make money.  Of course, there can be different views of the best product possible, and instead of making compromises it can be good to diverge. But only if we can afford it. Splitting a group of 10 people into 5+5 isn't great. Having 10 people out of 200 go on to try their own thing is fine. So competition among Free Software is OK, if we can afford it.  I for one, prefer that projects stay monolithic. For instance, I don't enjoy seeing or writing (featurep 'xemacs), not that I have anything against XEmacs, I just like simplicity.

Since the BSD-style license allows proprietary derivatives, the potential exists to make changes, enhancements, and improvements to the code without making the code available to the end user. Thus, from the end user perspective this is less free than GPL licensed software.  Reasonable people can disagree on this definition of freedom. Then again, no one has ever accused RMS of being reasonable."
emacs,2v23ww,kingpatzer,-2,Sat Feb 7 19:45:41 2015 UTC,"Thus, from the end user perspective this is less free than GPL licensed software.   In this day and age of boutique products and apps, the distinction between end user and developer is more than tad fuzzy. When it comes to development tools and libraries it's fuzzier still.   The reality is that the BSD style license is far and away superior to the GPL for all involved parties because it is far more equitable. And when it comes to licensing, equitable trumps all.   But beyond that, any license that limits your choices by using the software in any way limits your freedom with respect to that software. That's really not arguable. The BSD license limits your freedoms, including your freedom to do things like disagree with RMS, far less than the GPL does.  Regardless, the LLVM license is an open and free license. That it doesn't act to restrict end user freedoms in a way that the FSF/RMS like doesn't make it a non-free or non-open license. So the argument being forwarded that the LLVM/CLANG is in some way restrictive is simply false."
emacs,2v23ww,GTChessplayer,7,Sat Feb 7 20:10:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to argue which interpretation is correct. The FSF/RMS has as their foundational definition of freedom that all source code should be available and usable.

Their definition will never change, regardless of your opinions or arguments."

I find it ironic that today we need to build upon the toolchain created by a major vendor of proprietary software for their own purposes to create a high-quality free stack for C/C++ development.  If it wasn't for Apple, we wouldn't even have a good static analyzer for C/C++ under a free license—something which none ever build based on GCC because it was technically impossible.  GCC will become the new GJC, and we'll have a better free C/C++ toolchain because of it, just like the Java toolchain, which is one of the best free toolchains of all languages, probably precisely because the FSF didn't interfere."
emacs,2v23ww,kingpatzer,1 point,Sat Feb 7 14:17:23 2015 UTC,"Clang is a nice project. However today it isn't ready to fully replace GCC. Maybe for your own use it can, but you aren't the only GCC user in the world."
emacs,2v23ww,twotime,6,Sun Feb 8 23:50:27 2015 UTC,"Not really. I think there's a bad tendency to obsess over features and having more functionality. All things being equal it's good to extend functionality (at least as long as feature creep is in check), but all things aren't equal. Imagine if this were a matter of money, and a project (not necessarily GCC) was deciding whether they had the resources to implement a called-for feature, or whether spending the resources there would harm the project elsewhere. But when it's a strategic decision it's like people can't look past the features to see the ramifications for the project in the future.  So actually I'm impressed that RMS, despite all this pressure, is enforcing a slow and cautious approach to the question of what to do about these recent issues. I worry that the approach might be too slow, and the eventual decision might not actually be the best one for the project, but I don't see anything wrong with his attitude (although I know it makes things frustrating), even if in hindsight some mistakes will have been made."
emacs,2v23ww,username223,4,Sat Feb 7 17:11:33 2015 UTC,"I think RMS screwed up by locking in GCC. That completely prevented the free software community from producing good (or better) C and C++ tools. Even GDB or Emacs couldn't use the frontends. GDB has its own limited parser and Emacs has the slow CEDET mess. It would have been so much better if they could have used the GCC frontends.  That being said, I think RMS also had a point being afraid of proprietary tools stealing the GCC frontends. However proprietary vendors can also afford commercial frontends like EDG.  Now there is clang and I think he's right as seeing it as an attack. But his reaction is wrong. He should realise that locking in the AST was a mistake. His fears of proprietary tools stealing it are no longer valid because those tools will simply use clang. It seems also pointless trying to use Emacs as a weapon in this. Emacs no longer has the status it did in the early 90s.  Overall I'm afraid of how things will turn out. It seems clang is rising in popularity and this puts GCC at risk. Soon we might find ourselves with GCC being left behind and not long after that we'll see clang being left behind proprietary tools built on top of it."

Right now, I think, Emacs covers all the IDE features that were present in the old IDEs back then.  Of course, IDEs have made some progress in those 15 years.

His attitude had always been an extreme one, but he has usually been willing to consider opposing views if he can understand the logic and need behind them.  What's becoming apparent is that he has no concept of what modern programming languages are like and what needs modern programmers have. He doesn't know C++ or its style of OOP so he can't for instance see why you wouldn't rename a method using just basic search replace, but instead ask for refactoring tools.  He doesn't understand the need. So he won't consider the case as a valid thing GNU/GCC/Emacs should provide.

It's why we have things like MELPA when the GNU ELPA already exists: MELPA is full of stuff that interacts with non-GPL stuff.  I understand why direct support for LLDB would be distasteful, but it would be good for Emacs stuff to allow for non-GPL support  in a similar fashion that package.el does: create some sort of idealized interface that other packages can easily latch on to (think vc, but less sucky)."

The goal of the FSF is to promote free software.  lldb is free software, and could with no problems be included in GNU (which is not restricted to GPL'ed software).  However, it is possible that gdb does a better job promoting free software than lldb due to its license, in that case it may run against the goal of the FSF to support lldb in GNU, despite its status as free software.

When I asked him about this during one of his lectures, it seemed like a lot of hand waiving. Truly free software IMHO is only free if anything anyone wants to do with it can be done ala BSD (edit:  and MIT) licenses. Pure communist societies are anything but free; they are lead by dear leaders and one of their defining characteristics is that nobody should be able to make a profit. That's not freedom.   I am eternally grateful for everything Stallman has done and I hate to say a disparaging thing about him. His contributions to software, both in terms of getting people to think about proprietary vs free (as in Freedom) and actual code are invaluable.

It may be possible to override it in GUI Emacs but I don't know if it's possible.  EDIT: I've just checked if that's possible. Probably yes but not trivially. C-i is represented as ""TAB"" and Tab is represented as ""<tab>"". When I disable yas-mode I am able to bind two separate commands to them  (global-set-key (kbd ""TAB"") #'(lambda () (interactive) (insert ""a""))) (global-set-key (kbd ""<tab>"") #'(lambda () (interactive) (insert ""b"")))   but with modes like yas-mode or org-mode which bind some kind of dispatchers to Tab it seems to be more difficult (both keys insert ""a"" in the example above).  Like I've said before, even this is only possible in the GUI Emacs."
emacs,2uyi5g,vifon,3,Fri Feb 6 08:42:41 2015 UTC,"I've had endless problems with this. yas does some weird voodoo with the tab key to make it usable for both expansion and normal indentation.

Next recreate the bindings you want in python-mode with something like:  ;; actual tab key (define-key python-mode-map (kbd ""<tab>"") #'yas-expand)  ;; C-i key (but not affecting tab) (define-key python-mode-map (kbd ""C-i"") #'indent-for-tab-command)   (this doesn't need to go in a hook).  Finally if you want to stop yas-expand indenting when there is no snippet to expand then look at the yas-fallback-behaviour variable. You can set it temporarily for a single keypress with a let expression, something like:  (defun yas-expand-no-indent ()   (interactive)   (let ((yas-fallback-behavior nil))     (yas-expand)))   I've not tested the code in this post much so let me know if it goes wrong.  As noted by @vifon this will only work in GUI emacs, in terminals C-i is hard coded to tab at the ascii level (which really sucks if you're using the colemak layout where i is on the home row and would be useful to have for more common things)."
emacs,2uyi5g,sledgespread,2,Fri Feb 6 10:44:46 2015 UTC,"There's another way. It's a way that is long and dark and full of terror, but it's possible.  If you wish to go down the rabbit hole... I'll explain the outline of what you would do. Terminals read escape sequences in a certain way. If you're finding that the arrow keys (for example) are triggering forced escapes in vim because your terminal doesn't support arrow keys correctly, you can modify the terminfo file to correct this and then use tic to generate a new one and use that for your terminal instead. This is the lowest possible level of rewiring how your terminal interprets character codes. This is how to encode a ""backtab"" command into the terminal where none exists. I'd probably start here for modifying your ""tab"" to be a sequence other than ctrl-i.  The second solution (and perhaps the much easier one) would be to modify inputrc. It can do some pretty awesome and hacky stuff, so you may be able to make that work in a way that will fix C-i. This is the second lowest level in the system for keybinds."

emacs,2uyi5g,sledgespread,2,Fri Feb 6 15:08:12 2015 UTC,"the only suggestion then was to modify the source of my terminal   That's pretty much what terminfo does. All compliant terminals communicate all their keybinding information through it. For example, I modified my terminfo to recognize italic fonts by adding the correct escape codes for italics so that they wouldn't show up as inverted color but rather as slanted. With a nice italic capable monoline font, I was able to set up all my comments in vim to automatically be italicized. Very nice looking."

Then tuhdo suggested adding the ability to put the text on the kill-ring also (thanks! - https://github.com/bburns/clipmon/issues/2), effectively making it a clipboard manager - you can use browse-kill-ring or helm-kill-ring as a package for viewing/managing the kill-ring.   I need to rework it a bit though - I'd like to be able to leave it on as a clipboard manager and also turn the clipboard monitor on and off (ie for inserting text). I'll post those changes in the next day or two.   I'd also been looking into a way to persist the kill ring and it looks like savehist would work most easily -   (add-to-list 'savehist-additional-variables 'kill-ring) (setq savehist-autosave-interval (* 5 60)) ; autosave every 5 mins (savehist-mode 1)   though it would be nicer on the user to have a function like  (persist 'kill-ring ""5 mins"")   I guess I could make one like this though -   (clipmon-persist ""5 mins"")   or maybe there is a more canonical way of doing this?"

emacs,2uu3wc,magullo,4,Thu Feb 5 12:22:06 2015 UTC,"Well the OS has a clipboard, and Emacs has a kill-ring, and at some point relatively recently, they were able to get them working together - I remember having trouble with it when I first tried Emacs several years ago. It works great now though.   When you copy something to the system clipboard, say from Firefox, it doesn't get added to Emacs's kill-ring, but if you do the yank command, I think it checks the system clipboard to see if there's something on it, and pastes that. But I haven't delved into the inner workings very much.   So clipmon just monitors the system clipboard when you turn it on, and it can insert that text at the current location and/or add it to the kill-ring when it notices a change. Then you can browse the kill-ring with browse-kill-ring. But if you copy or cut something in Emacs, clipmon doesn't know about it.   I should probably explain this a bit more in the readme/commentary, as it is a bit confusing with the two clipboard systems."

emacs,2uu3wc,angelic_sedition,1 point,Thu Feb 5 17:10:32 2015 UTC,"No, it won't - the timeout is so if you're using clipmon, then go away from your computer, or forget what you were doing, you won't start adding text to Emacs accidentally by using the system clipboard for other things. That seems to happen to me a lot, anyway! You can always disable the timeout by setting clipmon-timeout to nil though.   If you wanted to persist the clipboard history, but you had been copying passwords, you could scan through it with browse-kill-ring and delete any passwords in it.

Another way, which I often use is to type ""Fi"" then M-/ SPC M-/ SPC M-/, M-/ SPC. That will write in ""Fix the flamuzzle, try"". This is a dabbrev feature that's not present in hippie-expand.  I find this behaviour very useful in text modes, but in programming modes the extra information present with hippie-expand is more useful.

emacs,2uo087,hvis,3,Tue Feb 3 22:44:10 2015 UTC,"So supposedly GPG signed packages are a thing:   The maintainers of package archives can increase the trust that you can have in their packages by signing them. They generate a private/public pair of cryptographic keys, and use the private key to create a signature file for each package. With the public key, you can use the signature files to verify who created the package, and that it has not been modified. A valid signature is not a cast-iron guarantee that a package is not malicious, so you should still exercise caution. Package archives should provide instructions on how you can obtain their public key. One way is to download the key from a server such as http://pgp.mit.edu/. Use M-x package-import-keyring to import the key into Emacs. Emacs stores package keys in the gnupg subdirectory of package-user-dir. The public key for the GNU package archive is distributed with Emacs, in the etc/package-keyring.gpg. Emacs uses it automatically.  If the user option package-check-signature is non-nil, Emacs attempts to verify signatures when you install packages. If the option has the value allow-unsigned, you can still install a package that is not signed. If you use some archives that do not sign their packages, you can add them to the list package-unsigned-archives.   But a quick run-through of my installed packages shows that nearly none of the are signed. Is this something we can just ask the creators to do?"
emacs,2uo087,BruceConnor,5,Tue Feb 3 21:50:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, actually.  Just use ""customize-variable"" to change ""package-check-signature"" to ""t"" instead of ""allow-unsigned"" (which is the default).  This will disallow unsigned packages from being installed unless you explicitly add them to the list ""package-unsigned-archives"".  We really should encourage people to sign packages if possible. Perhaps we could convince the moderator team to put up a sticky or something?"

The biggest pain, I guess, would be auto-generated -pkg files, but the repositories could standardize on the exact format, and create a tool that the author could run locally to create a build and its signature.  The built tar would be discarded, but the signature would be checked into the repo."

emacs,2uo087,wasamasa,1 point,Wed Feb 4 10:44:26 2015 UTC,"Right, MELPA Stable would be better for this. Otherwise, the author would have to perform the signing procedure for each commit."
emacs,2uo087,wasamasa,2,Wed Feb 4 12:00:36 2015 UTC,"It depends on who does the signing. It won't make much sense if all you're doing is having every body self-signed their own code. Unless someone who actually have some credentials are actually going over the code line by line before signing, there's still no assurances that the packages are not malicious.  The question then becomes, who would take on that task and do all that work for free and that it's someone you'd trust? I don't know of anyone who'd do that."
emacs,2uo087,wasamasa,2,Wed Feb 4 13:45:21 2015 UTC,"The problem I see with that is that I'm only aware of operating system package archives as an example of signing of packages making sense because there it's maintainers (not authors!) being responsible for every new release of a particular software they need to sign off.  So, additionally to the guarantee that the package you've received stayed the same as it was uploaded, you know that the signing step was done by a package archive maintainer who made sure it builds successfully on their machine and can be used safely. How the latter would work for an Emacs package is not really clear for me and would need more discussion.  The closest thing to that would be GNU ELPA due to its contribution requirements.  However once you're in, each author does the releases themselves, probably because of the lack of manpower involved despite the rather small size of the archive.  Marmalade has some sort of vetting process for getting an account. However, once you're in, you're responsible for doing releases of the packages you're looking over, no matter whether you're their author or just someone interested in maintaining them.  MELPA has a different sort of vetting process which applies to the quality of the code of the package.  Once it's part of MELPA, releases happen automatically. Signing would just give you the first guarantee, nothing even remotely close to the second.  In other words, I'm not convinced of signing being the solution, at least not unless the mindset behind package development and maintaining looks different than it does now.  There's more than just the technical side of things to solve."

emacs,2u5uzq,mnp,1 point,Fri Jan 30 11:52:09 2015 UTC,"Why? I see no problem in evaluating '(lisp-interaction-mode-map emacs-lisp-mode-map) and '((normal (kbd ""C-c C-a"") success) (insert (kbd ""C-c C-a"") success)).  In fact, it's almost always better to first try to implement stuff with defun. And only in the case when you say to yourself: ""This argument must not be evaluated"" - then you need a macro."
emacs,2u5uzq,abo-abo,4,Fri Jan 30 12:18:13 2015 UTC,"I must humbly disagree with these eval/macro statements.  When you see an eval in a function it often times is an indication that you were really looking for a macro.  In this case, and in the problem domain of setting up emacs in general, I'm not sure it matters.  But, as an example, consider that this will not work with your code, but would work with my macro below:  (defun evil-define-multiple (keymaps bindings)   (dolist (keymap keymaps)     (dolist (x bindings)       (destructuring-bind (mode key cmd)           x         (eval `(evil-define-key ,mode ,keymap ,key ,cmd))))))  (cl-flet ((success () (interactive) (message ""failure"")))   (evil-define-multiple    '(lisp-interaction-mode-map emacs-lisp-mode-map)    '((normal (kbd ""C-c C-a"") #'success)      (insert (kbd ""C-c C-a"") #'success))))   This doesn't work because eval (necessarily) evaluates in a null lexical environment.  Note also that I have unquoted the cmd variable as the user should really be in charge of specifying that.  To OP, macros are made to modify the interface of the language, so in makes no sense to define a macro but then wrap it in a function. It is extremely common, however, to write a lightweight macro that passes all of the heavy lifting to a regular function, but that isn't really necessary in this case.  Here is an example of how I might write this macro:  (defmacro evil-define-multiple (keymaps &rest bindings)   `(progn ,@(loop for keymap in keymaps                   appending                   (loop for (mode key cmd) in bindings                         collect `(evil-define-key ,mode ,keymap ,key ,cmd)))))   And you would use it like this:  (cl-flet ((success () (interactive) (message ""failure"")))   (evil-define-multiple    (lisp-interaction-mode-map emacs-lisp-mode-map)    ;; Use lexical functions    (insert (kbd ""C-c C-a"") #'success)    ;; Use anonymous functions    (normal (kbd ""C-c C-a"") (lambda () (interactive) (message ""Something else"")))    ;; Assuming visual is a valid mode, this calls whatever success is defined as    ;; when the keys are pressed    (visual (kbd ""C-c C-a"") 'success)))"
emacs,2u5uzq,smithzv,2,Fri Jan 30 15:34:03 2015 UTC,"I started from the assumption that evil-define-multiple should be a function.  Your way works, of course, and is better, but doesn't satisfy the assumption.  The assumption itself may be wrong, but at least it a function can be applied partially, so there's a use case for that. I wouldn't overthink it."
emacs,2u5uzq,abo-abo,5,Fri Jan 30 15:48:47 2015 UTC,I think you can use the vanilla global-set-key function to get the same result.  Edit: Or with define-key or local-set-key for mode local mappings.

If not then the OP's code isn't needed, he can just use the normal functions because he's setting the same for two modes.  That said, the two modes are ""normal"" and ""insert"". I don't know what VI people call their modes (to me they're ""beep"" and ""f**k everything up"").

emacs,2u3f67,vermiculus,2,Fri Jan 30 07:05:45 2015 UTC,"A package is a group of elisp files.  When you install a package, it is downloaded to a subdirectory in your emacs config (usually ""elpa""), compiled, and loaded.  When you start emacs all packages will be added to the load path, so that they will work when you use ""require"" in elisp or run an autoloaded function. Many packages will need some customization, or to be activated with a call like ""(foo-global-mode 1)"" or put in hooks etc, but this is all up to you, not the package manager.  It may be helpful to use something like use-package which provides a nice declaration syntax to organize your config on a per-package basis. There is a menu interface at 'M-x package-list-packages' which lets you browse, install, upgrade, delete etc.  There are other enhanced tools as well, for example Cask, paradox etc. that you might want to add as well. It's up to you.  The difference is in how much content they have and where they get it.  MELPA is very popular simply because it's the biggest, includes packages that otherwise wouldn't be in an archive at all (like ones that are originally just a page on emacswiki), and makes automated builds with no extra effort from the package maintainer.  I think if you have both MELPA and Gnu ELPA you've got pretty much everything there is, and when you find something that's not in either of those it probably isn't in any repository at all (and you should fork MELPA, add it, and submit a pull request :)."

emacs,2ttcvg,tacit7,2,Tue Jan 27 13:19:33 2015 UTC,"What do I do with the tar file?  If it has the source code for vhdl-mode, you need to add the file to the load-path list and then require it.   (add-to-list 'load-path ""path-to-vhdl-mode"")  (require 'vhdl-mode)   Youll prob need to read the install file for more instructions."
emacs,2ttcvg,enzochiau,2,Tue Jan 27 06:47:13 2015 UTC,Emacs is a powerful tool and worth to learn it.   About for FPGA design:   Use it as a editor with latest VHDL-mode or verilog-mode You can set project with simulator to compile and do simulation. But I perfer Makefile which is easy to share with people do not use emacs. Xilinx tools: they support command line mode and you can just create makefiles or tcl scripts to do the jobs. Program FPGA chip: I still can't figure out how to do it under Ubuntu. Just send the image file to windows machine to do the programming.
emacs,2ttcvg,lambdasgr,2,Wed Jan 28 10:40:32 2015 UTC,"I have been developing a quiet complex VHDL project with emacs, here's a few tips:   You can only use emacs as editor, everything else including synthesize, implementation, simulation, generate programming file, etc must be done with Xilinx IDE. So you create your files and add them to the project using Xilinx IDE, then edit them in emacs with VHDL mode. If you are smooth with emacs, you'll find it a lot better than the build in editor, especially on Linux. I use emacs for VHDL on windows too. Current emacs (24.4) ships with a broken VHDL mode. When you split your frame, with one window has VHDL code and try to use find-grep in the other, you'll find your find-grep result totally messed up. The only way I found to be able to replace the build in one with newer version is to replace the older VHDL mode file in emacs source before you compile it. Yes, this will require you to compile your emacs, so I'm not sure how to do it in windows, but then again, you won't need find-grep in windows. Just adding newer version to load path won't work, it will still use the build in one. VHDL mode is quite essential when it comes to VHDL and Xilinx Vivado. On older ISE you can create a test bench template for a desired module with a few clicks (at least for verilog it is). But with Vivado, you need to write all unnecessary crap on your own. With VHDL mode, you can just do vhdl-port-copy on desired module, then do vhd-port-paste-testbench, wah-la, a test bench template has been created. It might not sounds much, but if you've done you should know how much redundant crap you need to type for a test bench, especially for a VHDL test bench. Also, I always test my modules, so it turns out to save a lot typing. You sometimes might find the vhdl-electric-mode turned on, that's when whenever you type a keyword, VHDL mode will interactively ask you to fill the rest. If you don't like it, just toggle it off with vhdl-electric-mode command.   With all these been said, VHDL is a much much worse language than verilog, if you have option at very beginning, you should always choose verilog over VHDL."
emacs,2ttcvg,kaushalmodi,1 point,Tue Jan 27 16:23:01 2015 UTC,"I am surprised that emacs doesn't take the new vhdl mode file you add to the load path. You can try the use-package. In that you can use the :load-path ""package/path/relative/to/.emacs.d"" to specify the exact el you want to load. But you shouldn't need to do that. I use org-mode from MELPA which overrides the default org-mode that ships with emacs."

Or, more to your quote, perhaps, as a pretext for putting off facing engagement with what you really want (or need) to do, because it's easier to just keep sharpening.  In either case, though, the issue is between the ears, not with emacs. I suppose if it is difficult to address the real issue, one option is to confine yourself to using an axe you can't sharpen, but then you aren't ever going to have a very sharp axe.

emacs,2tsk6s,permafrosty,2,Tue Jan 27 02:19:42 2015 UTC,"This is correct, and I'm just expanding on it (mentioning this, so my comment here isn't misinterpreted as argument)...  Any notation system is likely to contain some arbitrary choices, about the ""proper"" expression of things.  The OP's suggested format could have been used instead, with say the canonical C-x c expressed as C-x_c or C-x 'c' or C-x (c) or any number of other variants.   The existing notation is simply a convention.    However, the current convention is a long-standing and well-understood notation, which are reasons in themselves to continue using it.    Clarity and consistency are the things that truly matter, in any notational system.    So, there's no advantage to replacing a conventional choice (even if it was originally somewhat arbitrary) with another notation (likely containing its own arbitrary choices), unless the original conventional notation is found to be somehow inadequate for expressing the concepts it is intended to denote.

Secondly, I could have a block of code that I want to comment out.  In that case I'd mark it and do M-;. I agree that if I wanted to comment out just a single line then that's not efficient.

I'll update the docs, since I will probably never use anything but ""standard package,"" which I'm assuming is what you get without an API key.  I will have to look up how to do the minibuffer thing; I thought that the ""minibuffer"" was a single-line buffer intended for user interaction.  I can provide an option for not selecting the window, if you prefer to view the forecast and then close it with C-x 1 rather than q. I always wanted to just close it, so it made sense to me to select the window so that pressing q actually kills the buffer entirely. I might also be the only OCD user who tries to keep his buffer list short."
emacs,2tmuet,kaushalmodi,1 point,Sun Jan 25 19:57:44 2015 UTC,"Minibuffer can be used for user input as well as to show anything you want using the simple message function.

emacs,2tmuet,theldoria,1 point,Sun Jan 25 20:16:33 2015 UTC,Thanks! I have felt need at different times to copy the base file name or full path or full path with parts replaced with shell env var and thus the need of that the case statement you see in that code. That code copies the path in one of the 3 ways above and displays the same in the minibuffer.  I meant to simply show an application of the minibuffer for things other than user entry.
emacs,2tmuet,rson,1 point,Sun Jan 25 20:22:02 2015 UTC,I actually like the implementation of quitting using q. I instinctively hit that key to quit the window and was happy to notice that it was already implemented :)  C-x 1 is not useful for my use case as I usually work with frames having 3 or 4 windows. I can use winner-undo but I think that the display in minibuffer might be the cleanest minimal approach.

Decades ago non-english-speaking countries invented character sets to represent their languages. Often 8-bits are used, the first 7-bits represent ASCII, then if the 8th bit is high those 7 bits represent something else. Then there's the modern approach, Unicode, which attempts to encode all languages.  You've written some text that's not in the coding system ""latin-1"" (ISO 8859-1) which is the system traditionally used by English speaking countries and most European countries. (Windows uses ""code page 1252"" which is the same as latin-1 with some extra stuff added).  The problematic character is the  "" ’ "". That's a relatively new character, in the past single and double-quotes were the same at each side. Like ""this"" not “this”, 'this' not ‘this’.

emacs,2thjhb,hyperbling,4,Sat Jan 24 15:49:41 2015 UTC,"I dwelled on a similar issue for some time about a year ago. I made the switch to Emacs after two years of Vim to try it out. This made me realize that Emacs's integration comes at a cost.   Most of the Emacs equivalents for other programs are 'quirky'. Yes you may run a shell in Emacs, but it will not be as complete as running it in your terminal emulator. You may use ERC, but I found it not to be as polished as irssi. You may manage windows, but just not as good as i3 (or any other WM). You may edit text, just not as comfortably as Vim.  Still, I found no good substitute for Emacs for developing Lisp, taking advantage of interactivity for REPL languages and easily extending your environment. Also, orgmode.  As a result, I now have a working setup in both vim and Emacs. I use vim whenever I want to do a quick edit or I want to develop in C or Python. I use Emacs for Lisp and Haskell. If I want to learn a new language, I try out both vim and Emacs modes of it and see which one I like more.  In the end, you need to try it out for a while to see what you are missing out on and to decide if that matters to you."

Magit is vastly easier to use than the stock git. Vastly more productive.  Dired and Helm are more effective ways to navigate files than cd and ls. Dired uses ls anyway, but make it better with a better interface. Similar for Helm, with its live grep, which is ultimately superior to stock grep.  Org-mode is a pretty competitive note taking and todo application.   Finally, even if an application is ""worse"", you can still combine with other applications in the Emacs ecosystem to support it. For example, when writing note with Org, you can compose programming language sources in your Org text using Emacs's own major modes for writing those. Now, if you use a two separate programs, one is code editor and one is markdown, you have to constantly switch to code editor, copy the code and paste back in your markdown editor with no highlighting. Emacs has no such problem, or if you have to do it that way, it is easy to use the same editing facility between both buffers than different editing facilities between two editors.  So, you conclusion about Emacs doing its own ways is worse than the standalone applications is inaccurate.   As a result, I now have a working setup in both vim and Emacs. I use vim whenever I want to do a quick edit or I want to develop in C or Python   What make Vim better than Emacs in C or Python? For Python, it should have similar capacity as the Lisp environment; that is, the interaction between code buffer and REPL buffer. For C, I got all of these things. If you want great clang integration, check irony-mode. I will update my guide with it soon. With Emacs and Helm Projectile, I can jump to any file from anywhere using a single command, even if a project has 30k or 50k files. It can even understand filename at cursor and jump to it in an instantly, even if the filename at point is just plain text like in a .txt file."

You can create savable workspaces across sessiosn easily. Check workgroups2.  If you want good looking tabs that works in terminal and GUI, use Elscreen. Here is how it looks like. The tabs are not limited to a buffer like Vim. It is an actual workspace that can hold many buffers.  And not forget that the advantage of having its own window manager is that you do not have to setup it across different OSes, like Windows. You can recreate the same Emacs experience easily whether you are on Linux, OS X or Windows. With Vim, not so easy, especially on Windows and you use plugins in Vim.   Until the addition of Helm, Dired is not that much more compared to cd and ls. And I did not mention in the previous post that I use ranger and z (primarily z) to navitage within the shell.   Dired leaves its buffers behind whenever you enter directories. So, with a simple buffer switch, you can easily go back to where you was. You can use i to insert a subdirectory to operate on two or more directories at once in the same buffer. You can even bookmark the Dired buffers to use across sessions, with sub-directories saved. I don't think you can do such a thing with stock Bash easily compared with what is offered with Dired in stock Emacs. I used fasd, but I do most things in Emacs so it's not relevant anymore.

Most often, when people say they're using Vim, they use it almost purely as a text editor and resort to system-level tools for other tasks - like, bash or zsh for working with file system, tmux or i3wm for windowing, git for version control, etc.  When people say, they're using Emacs, most often it means that they ""do everything inside Emacs"": use Dired (internal file manager) for working with filesystem, internal window system, magit to interface with git.  The dissection is not really strict and most people use something in between, but those are the 2 poles.  If ""Emacs way"" rings to you, you can give it a try. Note, that if you simply like the Vim keybindings, there's several ways you can get those inside Emacs (evil-mode being the most common way).

emacs,2tglsl,RobThorpe,1 point,Sat Jan 24 18:20:19 2015 UTC,"Let's say we have the code: (foo bar baz)  Lisp looks for a function named ""foo"" since it's in the first position.  It looks for variables called ""bar"" & ""baz"" because they're in the positions after.  What do we do when we want to talk about the symbol ""foo"" rather than it's value as a variable. Quote can be used for that 'foo is short for (quote foo). We can also quote a whole list: '(1 2 3). That means we can quote code too.  Code can be quoted and used for execution later. But, such code can't be compiled. It runs slowly through the interpreter, not through bytecode.  Emacs Lisp contains a special way to quote code: #'foo which is a short for (function foo). It roughly means ""this is a symbol representing a function"".  This has two benefits. Firstly, if the symbol given doesn't have an associated function then an error is raised straight away. Secondly, if a list is quoted then we can be sure the list represents code, so it can be byte-compiled. That said, it isn't really necessary these days. The byte-compiler recognizes (lambda ...) as always representing code, so #'(lambda ...) and (lambda ...) do the same thing.  In ellakk's code the #' is unnecessary because ""add-hook"" knows that it's inputs should be symbols representing functions. It checks that they are."

Kind of like evernote, where you can enter notes and tag them with relevant keywords. Orgmode  can do that. It supports tagging and tag groups. Albeit a bit cumbersome now, but doable. You can ofc also relate things by outline depth but I'd use that with care to start. Problem with relying on outline is the fact that your node has a space-dependency in the system and you'll meet resistance when moving things. You'll also realise pieces of knowledge you'd want to also be somewhere else. So, use tags as much as possible and use the outline mostly for structure ""inside"" the nodes, so to say..  In addition to tags as ways of linking information you can ofc use TODO keywords and categories. Those three ways of marking up your nodes are basically the same, only realised in different ways. Linking nodes directly to each other without keywords can be done using headline-links or custom_id's. Much like links in a wiki.  I would create a flat outline structure to realise the nodes. Let's say every piece of information is a level 2 heading under the main heading ""references"". Then apply tags to your information-pieces as you wish. Use group tags to structure your tags in a structure of its own. And there you kinda have it. Nodes are your level 2 outline items. Tags/todo/categories and links are your edges helping you organise things in a logical structure and linking related notes together.  Another thing not to forget: attachments. Not all things can be said in text. Make nodes with attached items or folders.  Make sure to have clear boundaries between things for reference and things to do though. GTD has good philosophies around that.  Sync with your favourite syncing tool - onenote, Dropbox, Bittorent sync, whatever, and enjoy your system all around. Orgmode still is lacking on mobile. But maybe there'll be a change in that in the future.."

Since I don't use ""email as chat"" I can get the emails at offlineimap's pace perfectly.

If the cursor is after the very last paren in your expression, with lispy-mode on, all you have to type is:  fe   Here,   f means: move to the same type of paren (open or close) in the appropriate direction. It will move point right after pp). e means: eval. The expression will be evaluated in CIDER and the output will be printed to the echo area.   Of course it's only vi-inspired, it has nothing to do with Evil, but at least the arrow keys h, j, k, l do what you would expect. And it's possible to adapt lispy to Evil, although no one had a large interest of doing so yet."
emacs,2t7kru,abo-abo,4,Wed Jan 21 22:47:38 2015 UTC,"I started to write a wrapper for Evil, here:  https://github.com/bcarrell/evil-lispy/blob/master/evil-lispy.el  It's implemented as a separate state on top of Evil, so when you're in normal mode, ( will jump to the left paren and enter Lispy state, ) will jump to the right and enter Lispy state, gv will mark the current symbol and enter Lispy, etc.  ESC will bring you back to Normal.  Lispy state is a straight up copy of Lispy, so you should get all of the bindings when you're in Lispy state.  In the end, though, I actually stopped using Evil mode here, so I'm not going to maintain the above script.  I actually found that I was less efficient using Evil for Lisp than using Lispy out of the box.  I hung in Normal mode too often, because that's what I was used to.  Once I became comfortable with using Lispy for editing Lisp, I was simply slower with my Vim (Evil) setup.  Your mileage may vary.  I really, really love Vim, but I just don't need it for Lisp when Lispy gives a very comfortable Vim-like experience.  Still, if you're interested in adapting Lispy for Evil, maybe it might serve as a helpful reference.  Another nice part is the safe deletions for Normal mode should work, so even when you're in Normal mode, your buffer shouldn't break when you do things like dd.  I also implemented additional text objects, so things like daf will delete your current form."
emacs,2t7kru,bcarrell,3,Thu Jan 22 01:46:00 2015 UTC,I really like the presmise of your package and been giving it a try on occasions. I meant to ask you the following:   How do you assume user is traversing buffer most of the time?    I often found myself in situations where sticking to established schema would be less convenient than per moving once per charcter?   Do you consider ACE jump to be necessary tool for the experience you envision? What guides your decisions regarding key bindings?
emacs,2t7kru,myeffort,2,Wed Jan 21 23:28:55 2015 UTC,"How do you assume user is traversing buffer most of the time?   Myself, I'm using h, j, k, l, d and f for navigation within a top-level form.  g is very important for switching between top-level forms. Of course, F also falls into that category, along with a debugging binding xj.   Do you consider ACE jump to be necessary tool for the experience you envision?   ACE jump is occasionally useful when doing small refinements to the code or during debugging. In those cases, a can select a symbol for eval, and q can quickly jump to e.g. an if branch. But when the nesting level is small, I don't use ACE, since it requires feedback. And of course, there's t - teleport: it's much faster than anything I could do without ACE jumping.   What guides your decisions regarding key bindings?   I would like to position bindings in a way that the most used ones are given the best positions. At the same time, most of the bindings were established quickly, and now it doesn't make sense to move them.  Still, I'm pretty happy with navigation stuff hjklim all being in one place, while the modification stuff wsrt is the other place. And all the new stuff can go on x prefix."

The problem is that some of you bindings (like C: convolute, s: move down) interferes with frequently used VIM bindings and I can't afford that context switch since it'll mess me up when I go back to non-LISPy buffers. If there was key bindings for EVIL that'd be interesting.  Can that be achieved with lispy?"
emacs,2t7kru,abo-abo,2,Thu Jan 22 00:04:32 2015 UTC,"It can. lispy's key binding code is only 100 lines out of 5000, establishing wrappers around plain Emacs commands (i.e. ones that have no idea about lispy state).  You could easily make an Evil state from that. Well, easily, implementation-wise.  The hard thing to do is to decide what to put where.

People are paying $$$ for 3rd party start menus. I use the emacs package helm-w32-launcher as my start menu replacement.  Emacs as the OS is a very useful thing."

He uses an Ubuntu VM with no window manager.  As long as he stays inside emacs, that's kind of like having a window manager. But when he opens a different window, it looks like there's no way for him to move or resize or hide it without closing it.  It's great that it works for him, but it's pretty hardcore. It seems like it would be a total PITA if he did front-end webdev, for example, because then he'd need a javascript-enabled browser window open basically all the time.  ...actually, it looks like he does do webdev, which surprises me. But this VM is for his personal stuff, so maybe he just doesn't do webdev in his personal time? Regardless if that's a bad example, it still seems to me like there are a lot of things that one might want to do that this setup would be annoying for."
