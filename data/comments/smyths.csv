smyths,3duq6n,Sot0,5,Sun Jul 19 17:43:33 2015 UTC,Best episode in a very long time. Neither of the myths had an obvious outcome and both were really fun to watch.
smyths,3duq6n,OruTaki,7,Mon Jul 20 00:10:17 2015 UTC,"Shame, the first half of this season it seemed like Smyths were no longer needed. Those episodes had very little filler or recaps. This new episode though was filled with repetitive clips. I lost count of how many times they replayed the Breaking Bad clip. Just looking at the runtime reduction shows that they took a wrong turn. Looks to be back to Discovery bloated programming once again."
smyths,3duq6n,LynxFX,2,Mon Jul 20 08:30:13 2015 UTC,"I watched both versions, and while they could have cut a bit of filler overall it's still a vast Improvement from the bad old days. I didn't find the unedited episode annoying to watch."

For propulsion you use 4 balls which go through the entire disc. This robot can be flipped without causing problems and is very resistent against all forms of attack.  As an offensive weapon you use retractable spikes/blades on the sides and on top. You can use those to stab enemy robots. As a main form of attack you can rotate the entire robot very fast, so the robot acts as a sawblade which can easily rip every robot apart."

smyths,3ca10a,tebla,7,Mon Jul 6 12:21:40 2015 UTC,Other than a final match they probably limit the time to limit damage  because victors still need to fight 3 or 4 more bouts and this only took place over a few days.   You had people like Ice Wave scrambling to fix their machine because they only had about a day between matches.

No idea what the exact rpm of those things is, but the edge speed of the blade is going to be the absolute max speed of the rock.  edit: after some quick googling, these have a speed limit of edge going about 200mph, that translates to about 293 fps, can you guess why that limit is in place?"

smyths,2z21dr,TheShroomHermit,7,Sat Mar 21 19:13:51 2015 UTC,"This guy speaks the truth. In order to properly melt steel, you'd need a forge with forced airflow to get it hot enough.   If OP chooses to go the aluminum route, the easiest way IMO would be sandcasting.  Carve a model of whatever you are making out of hard Styrofoam. Spray insulating foam would work just fine. Leave a column of foam going up to the top of the model. (This will be the channel for pouring the aluminum.)  Then put the model in a 5 gallon bucket and fill the bucket the rest of the way with sand, packing it down to fill in all the open spaces. Clear the sand away from the top of the model, then pour your molten aluminum in the foam spout. This will melt the foam and fill in all the space in the sand cast with aluminum  Next, it is a good idea to leave it in the cast for several hours to let it cool slowly. This will result in a stronger, less brittle aluminum than if you let it cool rapidly. However, if you want a hard (albiet more brittle) aluminum, then by feel free to dump it in water to quench it."

smyths,2z21dr,postdarwin,3,Sat Mar 14 22:19:01 2015 UTC,The melting temperature of steel is much much hotter than aluminum. You can melt aluminum with propane or map gas.  Steel is going to take acetylene and oxygen.

smyths,2z21dr,TripleFFF,2,Sun Mar 15 16:06:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, dont try this OP. you need specialist equipment and knowledge that cant be gleaned on youtube.   Part of the issue is that things you find around the home, knives etc, aren't made of steel, they have other materials mixed in with them to aid shine, give lastability etc. If you melt them down then the impurities will cause issue when trying to reform them, this will leave your item, at the very least, incredibly brittle.   also, molten steel is very, very, very, very dangerous to be near or to work with.

smyths,2wdvm6,arantius,11,Thu Feb 19 02:20:17 2015 UTC,"Wow, I haven't watched the regular episode yet, but the streamlined version was only 19 minutes?  Also - obligatory ""Thanks for editing it!!!""  EDIT: So I watched the streamlined, and then went back and skipped through the regular episode.  I liked the bit where Conrad demonstrated proper drifting in a racecar to Jamie and Adam (that was in the original), but aside from that, yep, the rest was all fluff that didn't add anything.  Cutesy intro where Jamie was in the back of a limo with tight-skirted women, a bunch of unnecessary narration, and ""Hey, we didn't need the Alameda runway anymore, so we came here to this former NASA range instead, look around"".  Props to arantius.  So far I have really liked this season, and I'd agree that the Drifting episode is the weakest, but at 19 minutes, it's worth watching.  :-)"
smyths,2wdvm6,zurkog,9,Thu Feb 19 02:47:21 2015 UTC,"I watched the whole thing... that sounds about right.  I'm actually really curious as to how it was streamlined.  It was a real let down of an episode. Some of the recent streamline edits just edited it so all the myths are consecutive, but no content is really cut."
smyths,2wdvm6,infinull,7,Thu Feb 19 03:19:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I was getting at; you can usually judge an episode by how much ""fluff"" is cut out during the streamlining process...  (""Coming up after the break...""  ""Previously on MythBusters..."", all the stuff that make up 98% of The Gift Shop Sketch).  Most streamlined Myths seem to be about 30-35 minutes long, although this season has tended to be longer (implying more content, less fluff).  But 19 minutes?  I don't think I've seen an episode trimmed that small.  I might have to watch the un-cut episode just to see what it looked like prior to the edit."
smyths,2wdvm6,zurkog,6,Thu Feb 19 03:55:22 2015 UTC,"I liked the bit where Conrad demonstrated proper drifting in a racecar to Jamie and Adam (that was in the original)   For those (like me) that are interested in proper drifting technique, /r/drifting would love to share some great vids, but this one by Chris Harris is a great start.  And if you can't get enough of that sweet sideways action, there's plenty more instruction here in The Drift Bible  Edit: Just watched the episode, and for the record, the first ""myth"" was completely idiotic. There's no drifter or drift fan in the world that thinks drifting on tarmac is faster than racing. Drifting is just about style and skill. That's why you don't see Nascar and F1 cars drifting corners (rally racing is another story and is totally awesome drift racing). Good proof of this is in this video with Keiichi Tsuchiya, ""The Drift King"" from the previous video.  At 1:38 Jeremy Clarkson says ""Speed is unimportant but style is everything."" Also 1:50 Tsuchiya says he used to be a race driver but he was so good that everyone know he was going to win every race. So one day he decided to slide the car around the corners to keep the crowd interested. He used drifting to literally handicap himself during races. He knew it would slow him down, but he still won the race. Actually, the fact that Adam managed to match Jamie's times while drifting is actually pretty damn impressive."

To me they only brought shitty acting, uninteresting myths and explosions. Don't get me wrong, I like explosions, but too much of a good thing...  So yes, they've got a fairly slow start with the new format, but it appeals a whole lot more to me than the previous bunch of seasons."
smyths,2w5dcm,grimman,13,Tue Feb 17 03:18:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah the new format's gonna need a bit of a rev up. It really depends on showing all the build process which means it needs a good build. I think that's why the SF Drift episode was sub-par (I still liked it, but it needs to be cut in half)."

It really gave the pair a dichotomy that was enjoyable to watch. Now he seems to be putting on an enjoyment act.

If anything I think the ideal scenario would be alternating episodes between teams, to keep the new format and include the others.    oh you can carry more weight if you are a big guy   That wasn't the myth. The myth was you can carry a dozen guns and hundreds of rounds for them without slowing down. It was very surprising to me that yes, you can.

No one expects humans to be able to run around at full speed and dexterity while carrying all that crap. No one holds that as common knowledge. That is not a myth.  That's not to say we expected the opposite either - what I'm saying is that no one gave a shut either way, because it's a video game mechanic that no one expects to translate to the real world."

More to the point, why of all the myths is this one such an issue? No-one is ever going to build a duct tape boat. No-one is going to use dynamite to disable a car. No-one is going to build a log cannon or a steam machine gun. None of those myths have any relevance to the real world either."
smyths,2w5dcm,PMalternativs2reddit,2,Tue Feb 17 17:38:22 2015 UTC,"I think you've missed my point.    The ""myth"" they were testing was ""can you really carry tens of guns and their ammo around"".  No one thought you could.  No one saw the Doom guy do it and say ""Yup, that's representative of reality, people can and do carry around tens of guns at a time"".  It's not common knowledge, there's no myth about that, and there was nothing to test.  It was very contrived - everyone knows it's just a game mechanic.  No one needed them to try to run around with guns strapped to their bodies, because no one cares about the outcome, because it's not a myth or common knowledge.  edit:   No-one is going to build a log cannon or a steam machine gun. None of those myths have any relevance to the real world either.   I disagree.  People have claimed to have built a steam machine gun and log cannon.  These are recorded events in history (like the sun death ray), and they seem suspicious at first glance.  There is a claim to test.  There is myth associated with the event.  Not with Doom though.  No-one sits around pondering the Doom guy and his gun carrying, because everyone recognizes that this is video game, that no human is making a claim about carrying a dozen guns around, and that your inventory in Doom is simply a game mechanic to give you progressively better weapons and weapon selection."
smyths,2w5dcm,sunshine-x,7,Tue Feb 17 23:20:15 2015 UTC,"The myth was that you couldn't. People have claimed that you couldn't. People considered this game mechanic unrealistic. Heck, even after watching the episode, you still wrote that you couldn't.   They proved that yes, you can. If you're as buff as the Doom man, you can. They're right, the games are right, you're wrong, your objection is wrong. End of."
smyths,2w5dcm,sunshine-x,-1,Wed Feb 18 09:26:38 2015 UTC,"The myth was that you couldn't. People have claimed that you couldn't.   What myth?  There's no myth about carrying multiple weapons.  Myths about cats always landing on their feet? Sure.  Myths about opening windows to escape a submerged car?  Sure.  Myths about open windows vs. air conditioning affecting fuel efficiency?  Yep.  Myths about humans being able to/not able to carry dozens of guns and their ammo?  No.  There's no such myth.    Sample the public.  Ask them if they've heard about cats always landing feet down.  Ask them if they've heard that AC is more efficient than windows down.  Ask them if they've heard that humans can run around like doom man with a dozen guns and their ammon?  No, they haven't heard that one, they haven't considered that one, and it's because it's not an established or common myth.  There's simply no mythos around that topic.  It's a game mechanic that doesn't extend into reality, and no one based any of their real-world expectations around it.   They proved that yes, you can. If you're as buff as the Doom man, you can.   I disagree here.  Their test proved the opposite, IMHO, and they poorly interpreted the results arriving at an incorrect conclusion.  The performance of Doom man is in no way affected by the number of weapons or ammo he carries.  He could move at full speed, with no impact on his endurance or dexterity.  It was obvious that this was not the case with their experiment.  He was heavily encumbered, his dexterity was greatly diminished, and while not tested, there's little to no chance he could maintain running speed or jump properly.  In Doom 3, running and jumping with a dozen guns is effortless.  The games are not representative of reality, are not intended to be, are not ""right"", and you're delusional if you think their tests proved anything other than carrying a dozen guns into combat is a stupid idea.  There's a reason no combat force in the world would ever do so, and it's certainly based on real-world performance of people as buff as Doom man."
smyths,2w5dcm,TheOneBritishGuy,5,Wed Feb 18 17:59:21 2015 UTC,"tl;dr: You disagree with the games, you disagree that there's a myth, you disagree with their testing, you disagree with the results. Okay then."
smyths,2w5dcm,Jimm607,3,Wed Feb 18 18:09:03 2015 UTC,"You disagree with the games,    The game I find perfectly agreeable; they're not making an absurd claim, they've simply implemented a game mechanic to allow for the addition of progressively more powerful weapons to your arsenal.  Good on Doom.  It's fun.  There's nothing here to disagree with.   you disagree that there's a myth   Yes - I disagree that it's a myth by conventional definition.  A claim doesn't become a myth simply because they decide to test it out on the show.   It should be a myth that they test, not some contrived scenario that they can easily test out, and label it a myth to fit the narrative of the show.   No one expects Doom to translate to real life.  I don't expect that tossing a banana peel from my car will cause the guy behind me to spin out.. it's a video game.  Why not test rocket jumping?  Because no one expects it to help you to jump (safely).   you disagree with their testing   Yes.  They failed to understand the scope and extent of the abilities of the Doom man.   He doesn't just complete one level with all that shit, he does level after level, at full speed, without losing agility, sprinting, or jumping capabilities.  They walked around for what, 5 baddies?  That's barely a portion of even a Doom 1 level.  Hardly representative of what the Doom man can do.  It's unreasonable to conflate doing it for 5 minutes with doing it for the entire game.  If you're going to infer that Doom is claiming that a human can effectively carry a dozen weapons, your test needs to do the same for a comparable duration.   you disagree with the results.    Yes, but my issue is primarily with construing Doom man's capabilities as a myth, and failing to understand and then reproduce his capabilities in their test - endurance is ignored, and is central to the claim.  Why can't a human carry all that shit into battle?  It's not because he can't do so for ten minutes.  It's because he doesn't have the endurance to do so for the entire battle.  Doom man does.  Doom man doesn't tire.  How'd they miss that? I have no issue with the conclusions they made from their poorly constructed test.    Okay then.   http://emotibot.net/pix/6040.jpg"
smyths,2w5dcm,SRAMTENNO1,1 point,Wed Feb 18 20:12:06 2015 UTC,"No one thought you could. No one saw the Doom guy do it and say ""Yup, that's representative of reality, people can and do carry around tens of guns at a time"". It's not common knowledge, there's no myth about that, and there was nothing to test.    But, that was the myth! Carrying a bunch of guns and ammo without slowing down was impossible. They proved it possible. Turns out we were all wrong and doom guy is slightly more realistic than any of us gave credit for.   As for the running speed of 54mph and ability to heal from bullet wounds by eating medpacks, we won't go into that.   As for any other unrealistic myth with no basis in real life, every single movie myth ever. They have done rather a lot of them."
smyths,2w5dcm,Scott2G,4,Wed Feb 18 07:31:20 2015 UTC,"But, that was the myth!   Except it doesn't meet anyone's definition of myth.  That's what they tested, but it's not a myth.  That's my (main) gripe with the episode.  They tested something that no one held to be a myth.  Why bother?   Carrying a bunch of guns and ammo without slowing down was impossible. They proved it possible. Turns out we were all wrong and doom guy is slightly more realistic than any of us gave credit for.   Their test was not at all representative of the claim.  Doom guy doesn't just walk through a level calmly shooting 4 or 5 baddies and calling it a day.  Doom man completes level after level, hour after hour, sprinting and jumping in Doom 3+ effortlessly regardless of the number of weapons carried.     They didn't exert hours of effort.  Had they have completed more than a few minutes of carrying those around, they would have found that Jamie is in fact human, has limited endurance, and cannot carry 150lbs of gear effortlessly while running and jumping without any impact on his dexterity.   That's not just common-sense, that's something we all empirically experience day to day.  Carry a backpack full of books to the car.  I CAN DO THAT! Carry that backpack up a mountain.  Oh, that's harder.  I have to slow down.  I am not capable of infinite endurance with hundreds of pounds on my back.  Doom man is.  They failed to reproduce that, and their conclusion was incorrect.  Doom man never tires.  They did.   As for any other unrealistic myth with no basis in real life, every single movie myth ever. They have done rather a lot of them.   My gripe with ""myths"" that aren't myths is not limited to the Doom episode, and having more ""myths"" that sucked doesn't make this one any better.  ""but the bar was always this low!""  Congrats I guess?"
smyths,2w5dcm,N3a,4,Wed Feb 18 18:07:37 2015 UTC,"It'd probably be worth going back over a few old myths from the show with the new set up.

As I've continued watching the original airings however, it's just been too unpleasant how they still jump back and forth myth-to-myth throughout the show.  Smyths are still worth it.  I still wish we could use TV-logo-free sources, however."

Some more pointed feedback though: This one has the unfortunate issue of being a bad HDTV cap.  I see this on my TV sometimes too: alternate lines are swapped around, creating tons of jaggies, look at these lines. A logo-free source would be awesome, those can be found pretty easily, if slightly delayed.  I'd also cut out lots more of the lead-in material if I were you.  This season has a lot of ""introduce both myths up front, then finally start actually doing one"".  Around a minute in, they discuss aqua bike.  Then jump to doing the car myth, then back to aqua bike.  That could be quite streamlined.  Plus I'm always happier when the credits are at the end of the show, rather than the middle."
smyths,2v7w16,The_Rob_White,2,Wed Feb 11 00:54:50 2015 UTC,"First of all thank you for the feedback.  I agree it would be nicer if i used a Web-DL as a source, but the Problem is, that these are published a day after the HDTV version and i only really have time to edit the smyths on sunday, so if i waited for the better version, my edits would be delayed a week. However, i could redo my edits once the season is finished with a better source.  The thing with the ""introduce both myths up front, then finally start actually doing one""-thing is, if i rewatch and old streamlined episode, i dont always remember exactly what the myths were and which version (for the myths that were tested multiple times) so if the presentation of both myths is at the beginning i can tell if i selected the right episode.  I thought about the credits thing and i think in some episodes the credits are at the end, but in the two newest episodes they said something like ""Okay, first we have this story and later we also test this other story"" so i edited it this way, but i think that could also be corrected  if i redo them."

Tory Grant, and Kari not renewing their contracts.  I think the first was Adam realizing that the show was growing stale and needed a kick in the pants (I believe Adam mentioned this on The Still untitled podcast from last week), and the second was the opportunity to actually change now that they essentially had more screen time to themselves that they didn't have to share anymore.  I don't think they were oblivious to the faults of the show, I think they knew and if they did notice the sub, it would have been an affirmation of it rather than discovering oh hey, people aren't really happy with the show as it stands.  To me it was more a realization that they needed to change along with the combination of the opportunity to do so.  My thoughts, of course just speculation."

Each die-hard fan is easily worth thousands of average fans because nothing will encourage more watchers like a satisfied user who tells everyone they know they should watch the show, too.  And when die-hards start hacking your product, then you should listen even harder.  Here are people who love your product so much, they're investing time and energy to make it better.  Yes, it's their opinion, but it's the opinion of the group you care most about.  That, and everyone knows narrated bumpers are fucking garbage.  They're big enough to afford real production.  They shouldn't be shot and edited like a crappy reality/home improvement show."
smyths,2t8w7r,onduty,18,Thu Jan 22 03:11:17 2015 UTC,"I see how that sounds logical and makes sense, but it sounds like you're talking more about user experience-based, web marketing.    If cable TV programs have taught us anything its that the hard core aren't really the concern for producers and execs. See; history channel leaves histroy buffs behind and programs for the mindless masses; TLC (the learning channel) becomes redneck roundup; MTV deprograms Music and aims for teen moms; etc. etc.  Ratings count, which is why channels have slowly drifted from their core beginnings and programmed mindless reality-style TV.  They don't even try to hide the fact that the talking heads are reading or repeating exactly what the producer coached them to say.  Agreed though, that occasionally, you will get someone who listens to the ""real"" fan, and we may see that start happening more and more. I mean, look at how influential comic-con fans have become in the marketing of movies?"
smyths,2t8w7r,painis,2,Thu Jan 22 04:11:54 2015 UTC,If I remember correctly the new (CEO?) was trying to swing Discovery back into some real scientific grounds rather than fantastical stuff like shark week etc.

smyths,2t8w7r,onduty,4,Thu Jan 22 13:23:25 2015 UTC,History channel left history buffs behind? I swear it was the nazi and WWII channel. I can only watch one subject so much before it becomes stales and they would literally run ww2 documentaries all day. I've never met a history buff that watched the history channel.   TLC used to have a couple really good gems. Junkyard wars was literally one of the greatest shows for me ever. But there was never much more substance beyond that. If i remember correctly they did a lot of design and home care shows.  I was too young for the MTV doesn't play music anymore crowd. But if I want music I wouldn't watch TV and i listen to a lot of music.    The problem the channels your described had were that none of them ever were completely focused on their subject or were over focused to the point that the channel literally offered no value after the first couple of weeks of watching it.
smyths,2t8w7r,painis,12,Thu Jan 22 08:55:14 2015 UTC,"You were late to the program.

smyths,2sud9z,Sot0,23,Sun Jan 18 17:10:59 2015 UTC,"Guys. That is the Mythbusers I was looking for. Slowed pace, but still entertaining. Full of making of stuff, and showing process along with commentary and occasional fun facts. First episode mediocre for me, mostly because of casting cartoon physics to real world conditions. But this, man. That was awesome. Whip making process was awesome. I think deserves separate 60 minutes long programme, with history, technology and this sort of jazz. This episode fulfilled my love to making offs. Year ago it was nothing but normal to show in making offs (for tv series, movies, etc.) process of creating, preparing special effects, sets and showing the whole ""Thats how we roll"". Now days making offs mostly looks like a drugged speaker says how extraordinary the product is, then actors give a 1 minute interview which consist of How my role is awesome and how whole project is awesome.  I haven't watch TV for a long time. I used to love Discovery channel for elevating popular science to its best. Lately I turned on TV and went to Discovery Channel. I watched whole programme about guys selling goods from garages.  Looked like scripted as hell (Lines that those guys said sounded like poem learned by 9-yrs old for school play, and repetitive motive of ""Guy who thinks that locker is wothless was mistaken because there was collectible atomic bomb from cold-war era signed by Benjamin Franklin himself). It was quite entertaining, but then I realized that I was watching Discovery Channel, and that made me sad."
smyths,2sud9z,Uwe_,10,Mon Jan 19 08:07:15 2015 UTC,"This is exactly the direction it needed to go.  I kinda miss the build team, but I think this is even better than the old episodes.  Showing the build process and how they do things was what made the show good to begin with.  The even showed their work in calculating math (speed of whip) and all the nerdy details that I always wanted to see (like details of construction).  Sure, explosions are cool, but it's pretty hard to be impressed after the cement truck."
smyths,2sud9z,cbbuntz,7,Mon Jan 19 10:56:04 2015 UTC,"Explosions and results were satisfying early, because it felt like we were p[art of the building process. Then it was all scripted stuff, the narrator thinking I've got amnesia, and the guys just seemed to have everything done instantly for them, so by the end it wasn't that good.  Now, its brilliant! They definitely did a good job with the re formatting. And I hope it stays like that."

smyths,2sai43,aManPerson,2,Tue Jan 13 20:47:04 2015 UTC,"yes, they don't add much.  i suppose they sort of reminded me as an augmented viewing, as if i had an iron man helmet on (yes, i know it sounds lame).  i suppose we'll see in a few episodes if it becomes annoying or not.  probably an attempt to still keep the ADD crowd interested in the show since overall it's a slower paced, more information deliberate entertainment."
smyths,2sai43,aManPerson,-4,Tue Jan 13 20:51:34 2015 UTC,
smyths,2sai43,aManPerson,8,Tue Jan 13 21:18:27 2015 UTC,"i'm confused by this claim:   we are that group the edits that are made remove the following:    remove the recaps done around a commercial break re-order the show so it's one myth at a time, from start to finish, instead of jumping back and forth to the different ones. jumping back and forth would capture ones attention again, if you had ADD.  keeping it together as one longer segment/story is less attention grabbing.   the show turned into ""zoom, zoom, boom, boom"".  i'm sure it helped get some ratings, but another segment of the audience, us, didnt like that.  if the show declined in popularity, i could see them altering focus once again to get the less ADD crowd interested again.  possibly, the crowd that got them popular in the first place.  i would not think the point of ""smyths"" editing is to make it MORE ADD."
smyths,2sai43,DrunkMc,0,Tue Jan 13 21:23:32 2015 UTC,Group breech copyright and DMCA  As Adam has said. The show is filmed and produced in style for TV  Obviously sitting on your computer or media centre without commercials will cause annoyance
smyths,2sai43,bubbaholy,1 point,Wed Jan 14 07:29:39 2015 UTC,"ok so yes, annoyance because media center viewing wont have the same caveats as TV, but that's no excuse for cutting all of the myths up so you have to watch the whole show just to see the resolution of the one you wanted.  that's just a shitty editing gimmick to get more people to sit through the entire thing."
smyths,2s2ymi,Sot0,46,Sun Jan 11 18:57:59 2015 UTC,"This is wonderful. I'm so happy that the show has gone this new route, and still happy that our fabulous Smythers can continue to edit the myths in order, which saves me time!  You guys rock."

smyths,2s2ymi,peanutbutterhusband,13,Mon Jan 12 04:53:08 2015 UTC,"I watched the full version, as I wanted to see what the new format is like, and it is great. I paid careful attention to see how much recapping and bullshit they were putting in the episode, and it wasn't much. It has a run time of 42 minutes and 30 seconds, so the smythed version really didn't need to cut much."
smyths,2s2ymi,Froggypwns,23,Mon Jan 12 05:25:18 2015 UTC,"What did you guys think of their results? I'm a home remodeling contractor, and have a couple thoughts. 1) All toilets that I've ever installed are bolted directly to their plumbing flange. This allows for a standardized bolt spacing and for plumbing code to control the mounting of the toilet. (They're all bolted down the same way) So their second try was more accurate in this way. 2)  Three toilets is the minimum number. Perhaps four would have distributed the force of the blast enough to avoid catastrophic failure.  3) These toilets are cheap residential models from the local Home Depot. Commercial toilets that would be used in a school are MUCH more robust, destined to handle abuse and obese.  This just feels like giving up early on a myth that they could have easily recreated with a few adjustments."
smyths,2s2ymi,_Neoshade_,12,Mon Jan 12 02:43:59 2015 UTC,"2) Three toilets is the minimum number. Perhaps four would have distributed the force of the blast enough to avoid catastrophic failure   This is the point that really got me. They were still very much in small scale - no full on ""sewer"" to dissipate the blast, only 3 toilets. I'm not saying they should have gone and bought 100 toilets and plumbed them in, but having say 20 open pipes to represent the next 20 toilets would have been interesting and easy to do.   Heck, where was the usual sliding scale of explosives? Usually they work their way up to blowing it all to pieces.   edit:  Also, Homer saved the house...how dead is Homer? WE NEED TO KNOW!!"
smyths,2s2ymi,AeroGold,2,Mon Jan 12 10:12:05 2015 UTC,"I'm very surprised they completely ignored that part, even expected the announcer saying something like ""Homer would have made a difference, but probably would be dead/severely injured from the impact"" at the end.   The show has previously used models with burst discs to check if an impact would be lethal (like in the Breaking Bad special), so I thought they'd try that here."
smyths,2s2ymi,querkmachine,2,Tue Jan 13 06:42:13 2015 UTC,"I think they didn't concentrate on that because Homer is a cartoon character, and the typical rules of physics and biology don't apply."
smyths,2s2ymi,Skyrmir,6,Sun Jan 18 09:05:45 2015 UTC,"I noticed right off that the toilets were cheap residential units.  I didn't even think of the obvious 'there would be more of them'.  I could definitely see that changing the result, but how many are in the Simpsons school bathroom?  The number might not make as much of a difference though, if they had to increase the explosive to still produce a geyser."
smyths,2s2ymi,Brillegeit,3,Mon Jan 12 04:35:27 2015 UTC,I didn't like their compromises like not using a big enough crane and using toilets that looked to have very restrictive pipes. Both these could have flipped the result of the tests.

The new format is too good to need smything.  Unfortunate that they switch back and forth between the two (in this case) myths rather than doing them consecutively, but overall I'm super happy with the new format.  If it stays this way, I personally plan to leave the show alone from season 15.  (But boy do I miss all the other hosts.)"
smyths,2s2ymi,Crysalim,5,Mon Jan 12 15:57:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah it doesnt really need much editing, but having the myths in order is so much better than switching back and forth. If you watch my smyth please let me know how you liked it :)  I actually enjoy it more now, with only adam and jamie."

smyths,2rzmjh,BubiBalboa,1 point,Sun Jan 11 10:11:11 2015 UTC,"I've just watched the episode (Simpsons Special) as well and would say there is a lot to cut out, for example the numerous snippets from the Simpsons series, which I found to be very annoying. Also the myths still aren't presented in order, so it would be nice to have them rearranged."
smyths,2rzmjh,lucasbosch,10,Sun Jan 11 17:29:21 2015 UTC,I'm thinking the only reason they had so many Simpsons clips is because it was a Simpson special.  Hoping that gets cut down in the future.

smyths,2rtnde,TempusThales,15,Tue Jan 13 22:52:10 2015 UTC,"Mega is the best host if you're downloading the file (I'm not sure about streaming). I'm always happy when the 1080p video is uploaded there. Mega's fast, encrypted, always up, relatively ad-free, and an easy one-click download (no ""wait 60 seconds"" or ""buy our premium pass"" bullshit). No other site I've used has anywhere near the same level of quality."

smyths,2rtnde,zaphodi,3,Fri Jan 9 10:30:07 2015 UTC,I started my collection with the torrent (which is very out of date) and then add the other files manually. It's time consuming so really could do with listing what's missing in the torrent file and available elsewhere (I may do a post on just this in the coming days).  For me I prefer Mega as I download and add the files to a media server so direct access to a speedy download is good for me.   I have issues with GoogleDrive in that it brings all other browsing to a standstill while the download is ongoing. Everything returns to normal after this.   That said I think choice is always the better option as it means people can opt for a service they trust.  I'd be keen to see people using the likes of multiupload! to ensure availablity elsewhere. The more links the better in my book.

smyths,2owwgw,Effinepic,5,Thu Dec 11 04:00:45 2014 UTC,"Any of the âbig threeâ (Naruto, Bleach and OnePiece) are painful in pacing for sure. I think the best shows are the ones that go for 50 or less episodes and end. You donât need to watch 600 episodes of the same show when there is more quality content out there then you would ever be able to watch. Once they start stretching out the story to keep it going itâs just not good anymore. Going off of what you listed Iâll stick to the action (shonen) shows for now.   If you havenât seen attack on titan yet you really need to get on that. There are 25 episodes out now and a second season in the works. Itâs by far the most popular of the last few years. Itâs horrific and violent just so you know. Lots of blood and death but SO good even if thatâs not your thing. Just watch the first episode and if you aren't sold then move on.  Another of the best action anime out there is Fate Zero it has some of the best animated fights I have ever seen. The best part is itâs a completed story, but if you like it the Fate series is still ongoing with spin offs, games, prequels and sequels all over the place.   Just one last one for now thatâs a bit older. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. Another one thatâs been out for a few years now but just in case you havenât seen it. itâs too good to miss.  As for things that are really from the last few seasons, most of those are still ongoing but right now Iâm watching Parasyte and its blowing my mind. Just watch the preview. The 11th episode just aired today and itâs set to run for 24 I think.   One other that aired this year that stands out is No Game No Life. Its more comedy then anything but has some really cool âgamesâ that you just have to see.  Last one for now, I donât want to rant for too long. Tokyo Ghoul. The first season is done already with 12 episodes and I think its going to pick back up this coming season or the one after that.   All of these are the most commonly loved shows that I can think of that I can guess you would like. Itâs a safe list, but there is a good chance you might have already seen most if not all of these. If you can tell me more about what you like I can get more accurate in what I recommend. You could say I watch A LOT of anime."
smyths,2owwgw,daniels0615,3,Thu Dec 11 05:19:54 2014 UTC,"See, I get where you're coming from, and I've started watching all kinds of shorter or more meta animes; or both, in the case of Kill La Kill.   But I don't want to miss the actual meat of f.i. Naruto. I really like the premise and the setup, but just wasn't able to watch more than like 20 episodes because it was already too drawn out. In the case of Bleach I barely made it to the final Aizen battle and that was as much as I could take, I really didn't want to see them reboot the whole thing.   I think there should be a Kai version for every anime, like Dragon Ball has. Why doesn't this exist yet?  PS In the mean time I've regressed to live action TV shows like Agents of Shield and Community, where there might be repetition, but not to the same degree."
smyths,2owwgw,j-frost,3,Thu Dec 11 10:07:28 2014 UTC,"I hear you. I really wanted to like all the longer shows and did at first. I guess the part I really hate is when I burn out on a show before it finishes. That leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth. If I like a shorter show then I know I can get more of the same by finding other shows from the same studio or animator.   Speaking of Kill La Kill, I wanted to recommend it too but itâs just not a safe pick to send a stranger to because itâs just so goofy and full of nudity that rubs some people the wrong way. If you like Kill La Kill then you HAVE to see Gurren Lagann. Itâs also from studio Gainax and might be one of the most epic things to come from them. But you have to be ok with a little bit of goofy."
smyths,2owwgw,daniels0615,2,Thu Dec 11 14:12:30 2014 UTC,"I think both Kill La Kill and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann are hilarious and quite insightful once you think about them.   Sadly, it's difficult to find shows I like, because sometimes people will recommend stuff I (weirdly?) don't like: I hated Sword Art Online for its pretentious-but-ultimately-pointless plot and ""meta"" plots.   Other times it'll be reverse; like I really loved Higurashi no Naku Koro ni although usually I'm ok-but-not-too-much-please with gore and I kinda hate the horror genre. Also I'm not into moe -- not that much at least (who's not at all into moe anyways?).   That soundtrack though....  PS Thanks for your recommendations overall, I'm sure you helped quite some people along -- I'm one of them."

I think it has something to do with the piece size, and old utorrent having a limit.

Some people prefer the directors cut of movies and some dont  The current format of mythbusters makes the show more accessiable for audiences that have hearing/sight disablities.
smyths,2e9f4t,perfecthashbrowns,6,Sat Aug 23 04:12:58 2014 UTC,Just because it is shorter doesn't mean it is for people with short attention spans. There's a lot of fluff and repetitive stuff on the show. There's no actual loss of content between the Smyths version and the Discovery Channel version.
smyths,2e9f4t,perfecthashbrowns,1 point,Fri Aug 22 22:44:18 2014 UTC,"Just because it is shorter doesn't mean it is for people with short attention spans.   TV is moving towards what happened to the internet/youtube and 24/7 news content. People are fragmented into niche audience groups and we (audience) are developing with shorter attention spans than normal 10 years ago  The argument is yes you could be two versions, a 30 mins version and directors cut extended version. However  the show is heavly dependant on narrator being story teller. What smyth style edits do is take 45-50 min episode and condense this into 25 mins shorter episode and forgets to include the usual banter expected from mythbusters narrators  Obviously you cut alot of that out. The show functions and feels alot different"
smyths,2e9f4t,perfecthashbrowns,1 point,Sat Aug 23 00:04:13 2014 UTC,"are developing with shorter attention spans than normal 10 years ago   Is that just a wild assertion you're making or you do you have actual evidence/data to back up that statement? /r/lewronggeneration    and forgets to include the usual banter expected from mythbusters narrators   The guy talking in the background? I am not a mind reader but I'd wager that most of the people who edit Smyths do not forget the narrator. They explicitly edit him out more often than not. Most of the content comes from Jamie, Adam, Kari, Grant, and Tory. I want to see them explain their methodology and their results. I couldn't care less about the narrator.  Third, I will quote the sidebar:   These 'Streamline' edits run shorter because they are missing teasers, cartoons, flashbacks, repetition, idents, history lessons, fun facts, ""we're experts"", and anything else that slows down the show.   It appears as if the ultimate goal of this subreddit isn't to cut down the length of the show but to cut out the fluff, which incidentally decreases the length of the show.  Finally, it really appears as if you have not actually watched any Smyths ""steamlined"" episodes. They are usually more than 25 minutes long, and not the <25 minutes that you have quoted to make your point seem more factual. I have a bunch here and the shortest one is 29 minutes long. I've got many here that are more than 30 minutes long. One is 43 minutes long."

smyths,2e1mgm,eyecorporations,2,Wed Aug 20 03:04:44 2014 UTC,"i never thought about it, but unlike the mythbusters edits, this is even easier.  you just cut a minute or two out of the show here and there.  with mythbusters you have to re-arrange it and remove repeat segments.  although i guess ninja warrior has some repeat parts too, recaps from before the commercials.  if these subs get in trouble for posting links to copyrighted tv shows, i really hope we can do something like the following:   come up with a list of the edits/timecodes of things skipped plug that file and a video of the episode into a program, and it plays back as intended.   that way we'd just be sharing around the ""playback"" file.  i dont know if any video player supports this.  i think we'd be as safe as sites that just host subtitle files.  i've never heard of a subtitle file site being sued.  that would be like suing a store that sells gun holsters."

smyths,2e1mgm,thedarkjack,1 point,Wed Aug 20 16:01:29 2014 UTC,"agreed.  i'm also trying to think, i remember some of the format of susake, the japan OG one.  on that one they also show people who failed at some point, and they also do a background for some contestants.  but the american one they're doing now seems so inflated, fluffy and fake.  i do like the streamlined one better, but i remember being ok with seeing some of the competitor profiles for susake."

I watched a few episodes of this and the premise is they acquire the owners car under false pretences then prank the owner for a week while they restore and overhaul the car.  They actually do a really good job, they completely redo the car all over and under, unlike PMR which just pimped it but never bothered to fix any mechanical problems.   OK waffle over, the format of the show is crap to be honest, the tricking and pranking of the owner is by far is lamest thing, they don't just do it at the start of the show they continue it throughout so you have to watch their cringey ""acting"" and pranks in between actually interesting and cool car building stuff.  I'd love to see this edited to remove the frankly boring and unnecessary prank crap and focus on the build team and their fabrication work. You could called the recut episodes ""Overhauled"".  In the same vein old episodes of American Chopper with the family soap opera/drama cut out would be kind of nice. I stopped watching the show years ago when they had more drama than actual bike building, their builds also became much more generic and boring, so why watch someone build the same bike every week, yawn."

The efficiency is just an added bonus.

In your sync folder (you may have to  show hidden files), look for the .SyncIgnore file and open it in notepad. From there you can add lines to the bottom.   As an example, you can have it skip the first 3 seasons by adding these lines at the bottom:  \Season 01\*  \Season 02\*  \Season 03\*  If you're on Mac or Linux, this should work, but use /Season 01/* instead of \Season 01\*.

Stop it and relocate the files and bam I'm updated.   EDIT: I tried to rename files to match, but it overwrites my files (at least it did season 10) with the new sync, checking as it goes. It would be a lot easier if I could see what I'm to be getting in the client and match it all up."

smyths,23mhk4,generic_white_male,9,Mon Apr 21 21:32:45 2014 UTC,"I had no internet for a month, and I spent it cutting one of my favourite animes by removing the theme song, recap, and repeated flashbacks of scenes you just saw 2 episodes ago.  As for why, you said it yourself. They're padding a 45 minute show into 1.5 hours, which means more commercials for the same amount of content. It's more profitable, so long as people keep watching it with all those commercials."
smyths,23mhk4,Reliant,2,Mon Apr 21 21:38:43 2014 UTC,Pissed me off when I suffered through 13 episodes of the original Robotech and the 14th episode was a recap of everything without all the boring filler. That one episode was really good and it was at that point I gave up on the show because I wasn't going to go back to having to watch everyone drag their feet with endless dialogue with no purpose.

smyths,23mhk4,sambob,5,Mon Apr 21 23:40:07 2014 UTC,A lot of reality shows in general could use some editing to reduce the sheer amount of repetition.
smyths,23mhk4,plc268,5,Tue Apr 22 00:22:04 2014 UTC,"I think the basic question is whether anyone who has the ability/interest to edit other shows will do so.

smyths,23mhk4,babada,3,Tue Apr 22 03:48:43 2014 UTC,"Reality TV as we know it only exists BECAUSE of it's editing. The editing in shows like Biggest Loser and whatnot are the product itself. If you edited out all the fluff, you'd not have an entertaining show. The entertainment value comes from the tension created by the editing.  Seriously, take just about anything on HGTV, edit out the ""reality"" aspects, and all you've got is Realty TV. (I wasn't trying to make a pun there.) Nothing anyone would want to watch.   ""Wanna watch this 15 minute video of a guy working out and weighing himself?"" Nope. You sure wouldn't.   At least with Mythbusters you start with a (sometimes) interesting question and finding the solution is (sometimes) interesting. But most reality TV is low on content, high on editing."
smyths,23mhk4,sample_material,5,Tue Apr 22 18:25:30 2014 UTC,Shows like the biggest loser and project runway are not dissimilar to watching a sporting event. You pick a favorite player and hope they do well. I think you can tell interesting stories without annoying editing and a heavy metal orchestra playing O Fortuna in the background.  The British version of anything with Gordon Ramsey is a good example. The American version of anything with Gordon Ramsey is a great example of crap.

And every episode has one segment that's just about some interpersonal drama between two of the designers that even makes my girlfriend cringe at home lame/contrived it is.  And then every episode ends with a few minutes of on the next.  It's a 1 hour show with 20 minutes of good design competition content and the rest if fluff.

smyths,2351hj,autowikibot,2,Wed Jul 30 07:18:42 2014 UTC,"Exploding trousers:       In New Zealand in the 1930s, farmers reportedly had trouble with exploding trousers as a result of attempts to control ragwort, an agricultural weed.   Farmers had been spraying sodium chlorate, a government recommended weedkiller, onto the ragwort, and some of the spray had ended up on their clothes. Sodium chlorate is a strong oxidizing agent, and reacted with the organic fibres (i.e. the wool and the cotton) of the clothes. Reports had farmers' trousers variously smoldering and bursting into flame, particularly when exposed to heat or naked flames.  One report had trousers that were hanging on a washing line starting to smoke. There were also several reports of trousers exploding while farmers were wearing them, causing severe burns.  The history was written up by James Watson of Massey University in a widely reported article, ""The Significance of Mr. Richard Buckley's Exploding Trousers"",  and which later won him an Ig Nobel Prize      Interesting: Sodium chlorate | Muse (magazine) | MythBusters (2006 season) | The Dangerous Brothers   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

smyths,228msx,PROFESIONALSPELUNKER,9,Sat Apr 5 01:19:48 2014 UTC,"Okay, if you have DVD versions of the show there will be a few technical problems you may have. This is all about how the footage is presented on DVDs.  The problem is DVD is the dependency on IFO AND VOB files. The IFO files control how the VOB files are played. A VOB file can have multiple different Video streams and audio tracks along with other sub picture files. Sub pictures are used for subtitles.  So the challenge is converting these VOB files into a workable video file for your editor.    First off you will need to get the footage off the DVD, this isn't that hard any more with anydvd and DVDFab. (if your looking for a free program try DVDFab HD Decrypter)  Always go for the full disk it makes it easier for converting the next stage.  Now the next problem is getting the VOB files into a workable solution for your editing program of choice. Now depending on the editing program is what you will export to. I personally use Cinematize to convert from DVD into workable files for editing however you may want to look out handbrake or other tools along those lines. Some programs do allow you to edit VOB files but it will not give you frame accurate editing due to the nature of MPEG encoding.  Trial and error is what you will use here depending on the editor that you're using.  Once you have your test footage into your editor, play around with how computer handles what you converted it to. Do a few test edits and do a output as well. It's better to spend a hour or two finding out what settings work best than exporting all a season and then finding out it won't work in your editing program.  So TLDR version  1 - Use a DVD ripper program to get the video out onto the computer Programs to do this   DVDFab DVD Ripper  AnyDVD  DVDFab HD Decrypter  2 - convert files into workable editing files  Cinematize  Handbreak  3 - Test,Test and Test more.  If you have any questions feel free to send me a PM. I am always happy to help."

smyths,228msx,arantius,3,Sat Apr 5 22:55:57 2014 UTC,"Assuming you can get the VOBs out, I suggest ffmpeg to deinterlace (yadif is good) and convert to a lossless codec (I like utvideo) for editing.  Assuming you can stitch the potentially multiple files together in your editor, approximately:  ffmpeg -i file.vob -filter:v yadif=1 -vcodec utvideo -acodec pcm_s16le file.avi  Should do it.  I cringe at the thought of lossy encodes for intermediate steps.  And personally, I use lossless codecs for the editing output, and then handbrake to encode.  Handbrake does a great job."

How does this compare to other fan-made edits to TV shows and movies?    The only ones I've seen are the DBZ ""unabridged"" parodies, which use entirely new scripts and voice actors.  They're clearly parodic, and therefore more protected.    Can these edits be considered educational alternatives?    I think so, but that's probably irrelevant under the law.    Is ""smything"" a critique on the current issues with reality show editing?    I think so, but that's probably irrelevant under the law.    If Discovery sends a C&D notice, would anything change?

If I don't have the license to possess and view an unaltered episode of Mythbusters, than I certainly have no right to produce and distribute a Smyth.  If you don't own the license to an unaltered episode of Mythbusters, than you have no right to download that episode, or it's Smyth.  Now lets say you and I both own the DVDs to season 5.  Could I cut a Smyth and give it to you?  Sure..  Except, how do I cut it?  Ripping a copy protected DVD is technically illegal.  The only legal means to obtain an episode in a form useful to cut would be to record the episode off a broadcast.  Even if you had recorded the same episode, it's my understanding that the very act of even sharing the Smyth would still be a violation.  If we technically wanted to be completely legal in distrbuting smyths, instead of distrbuting actual movie files, we should distrbute the information it takes to create those files.  Something like an Edit Decision List, or EDL.  It would read  00:01:12:12 - 00:01:16:23 CUT 00:01:19:29 - 00:01:45:34 CUT Etc.   Obviously that would be a huge pain, and largely pointless as many of the raw MB's we get are all different.  tl;dr The discussion over the legality of a Smyth is besides the point, it's likely your possession of the raw Mythbuster episode has already broken a law."

smyths,1z0tf5,SirCannonFodder,5,Thu Feb 27 04:05:32 2014 UTC,Clearly ripping media you own is not in itself illegal.    It is for two reasons:   You don't actually own the media. When you purchase a DVD you are purchasing a home use license to watch the media. If you actually owned it you could set up a movie theater with DVDs purchased from Amazon. Ripping a copy hits a weird law against unauthorized decryption. I used to know the name of that law but it has been ages since people brought this up and I've since forgotten it.

It doesn't matter how much time you put into editing or reorganizing; it is still their content and you are using a majority of the original work.   [...] that, I would argue, adds a new meaning/message to the original work.   What? The meaning/message is exactly the same. That's why we like smyths; the message is the same but the editing is better.   the nature of the copyrighted work   The content comes from a for-profit television show that, presumably, makes most of its money from ad revenue and DVD sales. The content is educational in nature but the Fair Use point of the educational bit is probably intended to let you clip out historical facts and notes from stuff like the old History channel or NatGeo documentaries.   the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole   Way more than the minimum necessary -- which is always a subjective ruling anyway. Especially since the parts left out are the least important parts. That's the whole point of the smyth.   the effect of the use upon the potential market for the copyrighted work   Yes. Smyths are a deliberately planned and executed alternative to the original show. One could argue that most of us stopped watching Mythbusters before we discovered smyths but that isn't really relevant.    I like smyths. I don't want to see them go. But no one here should kid themselves into thinking this is somehow okay under US law. Even watching these would technically be illegal because you'd have to download them first."
smyths,1z0tf5,absolutsyd,3,Fri Feb 28 13:29:31 2014 UTC,Probably not; hope those doing the smything are remaining semi-anonymous. This would be a stupid path to bankruptcy

In example via The Pirate Bay. C&D letters do nothing.  3) Stay anonymous.  If Discovery tries to curtail this, it will cause a backlash which is not in their best interest. Whatever trouble there may come the internet will quickly route around it."

smyths,1ytkmt,grencho,15,Tue Feb 25 01:40:45 2014 UTC,It is pretty crazy that these streamlines are 30 minutes when the show lasts an hour. There is literally as much content as fluff and commercials in a broadcast episode.

Pay attention to this.   I'd pay more to get Top Chef and Chopped edited down to the actual content.    I'd pay a lot more if a genuine quality fiction series like LOST, the Sopranos or Breaking Bad were made that contained multiple storylines, and the option to watch edits that maximized the characters and storylines you liked and minimized the others.  This sub is a great example of how to get started: by legitimizing these fan edits and producing them yourselves."

It was a breath of fresh air to see the show as I had always wanted it to be;  No extended ELI5 animations, little to no narrator, and all the other filler removed.    The streamlined episodes managed to keep my attention from beginning to end, something that the real show stopped being able to do a long time ago.  Thank you to everyone who has worked on editing an episode for this subreddit!  (If I could just make one suggestion, though:  Please find a better place to host the videos for streaming than sockshare.  Videos load slow as hell, if they finish loading at all, and the site is full of adware and virus landmines.  Mega is great, btw, I just wish they would allow streaming instead of having to download.)"

smyths,1yttz0,Bearmodule,3,Mon Feb 24 23:30:15 2014 UTC,"It was also asked in Jamie's recent ama.  Although, it seems pretty obvious if either of them were to answer, it would be Adam"

I could be wrong, willing to admit that - I remember it being pretty far down, and that could be why he didn't reply to it.  You're right about him being straightforward, that might make him more likely to answer the question if either of them do."

smyths,1yrik6,jook11,2,Mon Feb 24 06:19:51 2014 UTC,"Also, those twitter popups are super annoying. I hope they don't keep doing that from now on.   Indeed.  They stopped earlier in the season and I got hopeful.  Then they started again ... ugh.   I really hoped the fry oil at the end would ignite and there would be a huge fireball when it splashed out. Isn't that supposed to be a danger of deep-frying?   I have to assume it's because there was no water in this case; when the oil came out it was one big whoosh, which might have in fact put the flame out (no oxygen).  When water instantly boils to steam, I think it aerosolizes the oil, making it ideally flammable."
smyths,1yrik6,OruTaki,1 point,Mon Feb 24 22:52:35 2014 UTC,"Oh, is that what causes the flare-ups? Good to know. I was thinking it was something about not properly thawing your turkey, or something like that, so it makes sense that it could be the ice sublimating or whatever and spraying the oil around. That would make a very different sort of spray than the splash from this."
smyths,1yrik6,jook11,3,Mon Feb 24 23:46:20 2014 UTC,"Yeah considering water expands to 1600 times it's liquid volume when it turns to steam, even a little bit can displace a lot of water. But in regards to cooking a turkey it probably wouldn't matter too much.   The one thing that did bug me is when they're making the vacuum chamber the narrator said ""the vacuum chamber will suck every atom out"" which is kind of hilariously misleading."

smyths,1yrik6,jook11,3,Tue Feb 25 06:25:27 2014 UTC,"I wasn't expecting it to make a sound at all... (in space no one can hear you scream), but it looks like the sound was from the expanding gas cloud hitting and reverberating the sides of the chamber.  That's cool."
smyths,1yrik6,toekneebullard,1 point,Tue Feb 25 09:46:12 2014 UTC,"Well, aside from the expanding gases hitting the sides, the gun rest was also sitting on the bottom of the chamber, so it can transfer movement directly into the plexiglass from the recoil and such."
smyths,1yrik6,jook11,2,Tue Feb 25 21:39:09 2014 UTC,"What kind of rifle is that? Why does it just go ""thunk"" ?   It may just be the way they recorded it. Guns are tricky to record, because they are so loud. If you ever see a video of a pro gun recording, you'll see they use several mics, some very far away.   If you set a mic to not clip during the initial loud bang of a gunshot, then the rest of the trail goes unheard. If you then mix that sound low, then all you get is a small pop sound."

It's possibly a sockshare issue as the 480p links to sockshare are slightly louder than the 1080p to sockshare but still a bit on the quite side. It might only be worth uploading SD links to sockshare as they both get hammered by the transcode on their end, and end up the same quality (sans sound) there."

First, the easy bit: You can download the original from Sockshare, as well as stream the re-compressed version.  So it's just another easy mirror.  The hard bit: audio.  You're not the first person to say so. So there's the HD encode, with two audio tracks: AC3 5.1 and AAC stereo.  The 480p has only the AAC stereo.  Specifically which file is too quiet, and which audio track if the HD one?  Downloaded, or streamed?  With what player?  Subjectively, when I play all three tracks through VLC on the computer, I hear the same volume.

A few dBs lower: -36 rather than -32.  But that shouldn't be a ""can't hear it on max volume"" kind of difference.  The one thing I notice is that the order of the AC3/AAC tracks may have been what has changed.  This edit has AC3 then AAC, previous has the AAC first.  Which might affect some players' (or Sockshare's converter's?) default behavior.  Maybe Sockshare is now reading the 5.1 AC3 input, and has a horrible downmix strategy?  Like maybe it's not using the center channel?  I have indeed changed my encode scheme a bit.  I export the edit to a lossless intermediary, then encode that with Handbrake.  I moved the last step over to my laptop, to free up the desktop for other stuff while it runs.  And picked new, slower, in theory higher quality settings as I did so."
smyths,1wbxrj,huffmanm,3,Tue Jan 28 23:35:54 2014 UTC,"A fitting myth-quote.  ""Remember kids, the only difference between Science and screwing around is writing it down.""  The science is in the ffmpeg stats and was interesting to see. I take it that the 'Pk' levels are peaking? So by my understanding the fix won't be as simple as increasing the volume else clipping will occur.   I don't think that the centre channel is being lost in the downmixing at Sockshare's end as the balance seems fine - speech, music and effects.  My money is on something with Sockshare's transcode or player.  Interesting that you go to a lossless intermediary from the edit. Is that more to prevent generational loss, or so your CPUs don't have to work so hard to encode to it, and then decode to output to h.264?"
smyths,1wbxrj,calomile,2,Wed Jan 29 15:12:02 2014 UTC,"I take it that the 'Pk' levels are peaking?   Never used sox before, it was the best tool that a search pointed me at.  Your reading of the docs is as good as mine, but yes that's what I believe it to be.   Interesting that you go to a lossless intermediary from the edit. Is that more to prevent generational loss, or so your CPUs don't have to work so hard to encode to it, and then decode to output to h.264?   Mostly because of limitations of what kinds of outputs I can generate directly, and the fact that I want to do a 1080 and 480 encode.  So the edit is exported once (lossless intermediate), then the encode is done twice from that same file.  Generating a 1080 intermediate takes ~5 hours (and threads very poorly).  Encoding 480 from that takes ~1 and 1080 ~4 (consuming all cores).  I have to wager they'd both take ~5-6 each if I went straight from Premire->Handbrake.  Except Handbrake doesn't (apparently?) speak PCM audio for input, so I have to re-code that anyway, which is worked into my intermediate step."

I feel like KGT's punching robot was flawed (most noticeably during the first test with the coffin aboveground). One a human broke through the lid, they would have more space to punch into and extend their arm more. But the robot seemed to just punch the same height every time, leading to the wood just shifting up and down.   Took out Tory fighting the MMA guy because that really wasn't that relevant (and really not that funny, especially on repeated viewings)."

smyths,1vphzi,arantius,2,Tue Jan 21 00:04:32 2014 UTC,"I just watched this episode for the first time: as aired, then DShepard's edit.  Here's my notes.  FYI going in: First, thanks a ton for contributing, and overall great edit.  But beyond that, I find ""sugar coating"" to be exhausting.  So I don't do it.  If you read this wrong, it might seem mean/condescending.  Really I'm just trying to provide honest/constructive feedback.   480p?  Why not higher?  Personally, I feel like I put a lot of effort into a smyth.  Storage and bandwidth gets cheap quickly.  (I remember encoding 320x240 videos in the 90s that are next to worthless for watching today.)  So the extra space/time/bandwidth spent on HD now will continue to look better forever, but not feel like ""extra"" very soon. The audio is mixed too low.  I had to turn the volume up almost to the maximum to hear what was being said.  (On my HTPC.)  This is probably down to wherever the source video came from? At 0m40s in, there's a ""flash cut"" error as the blueprint room scene ends.  Big kudos for cutting out that lame VO but a tiny flash of the black tubing before the table saw was left in.  If I did this edit, I probably would have moved a slightly longer cut of the black tube unpacking video over Adam starting to explain what he was doing. At 4m11s I would have tried really hard to remove the VO guy saying ""the, hehe, pane barrier"".  Who writes his script? Another flash cut at 7m15s would ideally be avoided.  Also looks like you edited out the mention of Adam spraying the glass so it would be visible on high speed.  I would be inclined to keep that.  It was, to me, a surprising difference to the other two tests and I would have liked to see it called out. This episode had some nice myth-specific logo bumpers I would have left in between the separate myths. At about 9m09s I see the included movie clip edited over the host's discussion, removing the lame VO guy.  Very good!  Plus an apparent film flash to cover up a rough edit this would have created used very appropriately. At about 18m40s there's a stray ""whoosh"" from an existing cut.  I bet it was impossible to remove completely without also removing some dialog.  In this case I usually try to keep the whole transition whoosh, and put my own transition on top.  Can't say exactly what I'd have done here, but it probably would have been keeping the cartoon, likely sped up, over the hosts' dialog.  Then whatever the real (video) transition was would have continued to work well.  (On the other hand, you probably edited out repetitive cartoons on purpose?  Maybe a simple push/flash transition.) At 19m07s the cut feels a bit awkward.  I probably would have cut out the video of Adam altogether, for the set up video (with awful VO guy audio?) which you seemed to edit in. At 22m54s seems like you left in a sort of ""after the commercials"" teaser bit. Credits at the end, yay.   I didn't watch Ram27's edit, but yours seems to be ~5 minutes shorter and yet flow very well, which is awesome.  There were some bits in the ""outtakes"" online video that could have been edited in to great effect.  Separately, general comments on the episode:   This episode is full of awful puns and lame quips from the VO guy.  I hates them!  Plenty of lame comments to edit out. It's too bad, the tempered sheet must have been a bit smaller than the others.  But they addressed that by raising it to fit into the rig on the top.  So the car didn't hit it the same way.  I wonder what would have happened if it was resting on the ground on the bottom, like the other two. About 20m40s in DShepard's edit: Looks like Jamie is legitimately shaking from the experience of that impact.  Impressive, he's usually unflappable."
smyths,1vphzi,tekoyaki,4,Tue Jan 21 17:38:03 2014 UTC,"I have a 720p version, but the upload kept crashing, so I had to make do with a smaller res.  My goal was to get the smyth out there as fast as possible, so people who, like me, just want the episode as soon as it comes out, could watch it without all the shitty filler. That might create a few awkward cuts, but I didn't want to spend more than an hour on an HDTV version.  Thanks for the feedback though. I'll keep it all in mind, should I choose to do another edit."
smyths,1vphzi,arantius,5,Tue Jan 21 18:13:17 2014 UTC,I thought it was good enough. It's not something that has to be perfect.
smyths,1vphzi,yoreel,6,Tue Jan 21 20:05:17 2014 UTC,"I actually just was about to post mine when I saw this.   Here's the link just for the hell of it since I already had it uploaded and everything  Not your fault or anything, OP. I'm sure yours is good. It'd just be cool if there was some sort of placeholder system."
smyths,1vphzi,mynumberistwentynine,5,Tue Jan 21 02:31:47 2014 UTC,There is.  The list is on the wiki and convention is to mark an episode in progress to avoid duplication of work.
smyths,1vphzi,gnurken123,3,Tue Jan 21 03:14:33 2014 UTC,"Welp, sorry about that! I'll be sure to do that, if I do another Smyth."
smyths,1vphzi,Theoroshia,3,Tue Jan 21 05:30:42 2014 UTC,MEGA will not load for me at all.
smyths,1vphzi,realblublu,2,Tue Jan 21 07:20:05 2014 UTC,Seems like it's down. Gonna upload to sockshare later
