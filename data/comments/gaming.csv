gaming,3c7szs,2th,"He still exists, much to the confusion of fans everywhere.  There's android Human Torch, and Johnny storm.  For a while android torch was on west coast avengers, and I'm not really sure where he's gone since then.\n\nEDIT: after much research, I've discovered that I still don't really know where he went.  He was last seen on Hickman's Fantastic Four run about a year ago for like 4 issues, but they don't really explain where he was before or after that."

gaming,3c7szs,beastinr0cks,Oddly enough the Captain America movies are my favorite of the Marvel line up so far. So much so that i give that shitty musical number in the first one a pass.

gaming,3c7szs,UpTheIron,It's about a guy in a supersuit using superpowers to fight bad guys. It is a superhero movie. It draws directly from the comic book for one of its villains.

gaming,3c7szs,DroolingIguana,"If you're talking about the ""Mery Marvel Marching Society"" march, it's not that obscure. It played during the end credits of the Gantray-Lawrence Marvel cartoons, which get rerun reasonably frequently."
gaming,3c7szs,someguyinahat,"Really? The Hulk and Spider-Man were made by Gantray-Lawrence, I watched those, and I don't remember that song at all. But I'll take your word for it."
gaming,3c7szs,DroolingIguana,"Spider-Man was its own thing with its own credits. The Hulk was part of the Marvel Super Heroes Show, which consisted of a series of shorts adapted from comics starring the Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and the Sub-Mariner, and used the M.M.M.S. March as its end credits theme."
gaming,3c7szs,CRAG7,I 100%ed Lego Marvel.  You're going to never want to look at another Lego game by the time you're done with it.

gaming,3c7szs,ShadowRaikou,Don't buy any characters till the end. Save all of your studs for the cheat codes that multiply your brick income. Then getting the characters becomes much easier.
gaming,3c7szs,seat_filler,That x3000+ multiplier tho.
gaming,3c7szs,IdoNOThateNEVER,That's what he's talking about. You save up your studs to buy the multipliers first and then become uber rich.

gaming,3c7szs,FTHappy,This is too true! By thd time I did it to 100% I knew I was done with them for a while.
gaming,3c7szs,BW_Bird,I really hope the new Avengers one is like it.
gaming,3c7szs,Mithious,This was the first Lego game I ever played. I recently played Lego LotR and was surprised how different the games felt. You can really tell how much they've improved the game series since then.
gaming,3c7szs,Samoth95,"The thing about LEGO Marvel (and now Batman 3) that made me like it so much is the free roam part. In Marvel you have New York city free to explore, and flying with Iron Man feels so good! Also, you may notice that recent LEGO games feature voices, when older ones didn't."
gaming,3c7szs,seat_filler,"Featuring voices is a bit hit and miss. It worked in marvel superheroes because it's an original story but it made the hobbit a whole lot worse than LOTR. The LOTR adaption was full of fun little scenes that worked because of the expressions of the characters, that's lost when you're just lifting dialog straight out of the film.\n\nEdit: Fixed LORT, whoever he is."
gaming,3c7szs,AMathmagician,"Lego LoTR sounds alot like the Lego Star Wars games then. I think in the second one Darth Vader had to hold up pictures to explain the pivotal ""I am your father"" bit."
gaming,3c7szs,Necky_the_Beard,"Ah, there's nothing like Pictionary on family game night."
gaming,3c7szs,alrightothen,"That's one thing I don't like about the newer games, too much speaking. I loved how over the top the Star Wars games were to communicate the story without any words."

The free roam allows us to explore and interact in ways we never thought of. \n\nShe loves when I get a bus and drive her around town. She selects Aunt May and tells me to be Jonah Jameson so we can act like an old couple site seeing. Or, I'll be Peter Parker walking with her in a garden (I'm supposed to visiting Nanna in her garden). \n\nLots of fun to be had in free roam environments. My favorite is when she stumbles onto a sentinel and she starts yelling for me to help. I love her cheers when I do the Iron Man knee-drop between her and the sentinel. \n\nHer and I playing"

gaming,3c7szs,progdrummer,"My wife had never played games until she saw how much fun we were having. We invited her tons of times and she finally caved. We play Rayman Legends, Ratchet and Clank: All 4 One, and PS Allstars Battle Royale mostly. \n\nIt's a blast and we lose track of time nearly every time we play. \n\nI also get to teach my daughter about comics and about how things work. \n\nI'm working on building worlds in Disney Infinite that help her with her alphabet and counting. It's takes a while but it's fun when she wants to play in the world of ""B's"". I build a giant letter ""B"" in the world and populate it with anything I can that starts with be. \n\nAnyway, encourage your family to play. I never thought this would happen with mine. It was just about having fun. \n\nR&C I'm Nepharius, wife is Ratchet, daughter is Qwark\n\nAunt May walking with Peter Parker in the garden\n\n""Old people"" in the subway\n\nThe only way to play Batman\n\nMy badass princess"
gaming,3c7szs,BW_Bird,"I've played all the way through Lego Marvel and Toy Story 3 with my kids starting when they were probably 2 and 5 and it's been a blast. Done All 4 One and Rayman Legends too. The kids love them all. We still can't get my wife involved though. oh well, her loss."
gaming,3c7szs,barnes80,"That's what I thought too when my wife wouldn't play. Once she got into to it, it was on!  She couldn't resist the Black Betty level in Rayman Legends."
gaming,3c7szs,glglglglgl,That's super adoorbz.
gaming,3c7szs,Thorneblood,"Agreed! The free roaming made the game so much better. Even if driving around in a car was nearly pointless I'm glad they still gave that option.\n\nI just finished Lego Movie and while I love it, I feel like the game would have benefited from a larger open world. It would have been so much fun to play around in Bricksberg instead of a tiny model of Bricksberg. Er, even if the latter made more sense."
gaming,3c7szs,JediGuyB,The driving could have made more sense if they took a hint from the GTA series and put jumps and various mission types. But the street races got a little boring after a while.
gaming,3c7szs,Robinisthemother,Driving around in cars allowed those fantastic Punisher missions where he is very angry about... trucks causing pollution.
gaming,3c7szs,scubasteve1886,"While I haven't played Lego Batman 3, Batman 2 has an Open world Gotham City and some amazing characters to unlock...they also have much better vehicles than what Lego Marvel had to offer (Naturally)"
gaming,3c7szs,seat_filler,Open world Gotham City??? I'm in!
gaming,3c7szs,Darth_Banal,"Just try the first LEGO Star Wars game, where you could get almost all mini-kits and everything on story mode, and the rest you need just a high jumper or a droid at one or two parts.\n\nBy the time we got LEGO Batman and LEGO Lord of the Rings you're lucky to find one or two mini-kits on story mode."
gaming,3c7szs,Spidermini,Is lego jurassic Park any good?
gaming,3c7szs,darkjungle,I like it a lot.  Probably my second fave after Marvel.
gaming,3c7szs,Mushtingz,"It was awesome; full of nostalgia. You can play as about a dozen different dinosaurs, and you can also customize them by ""mixing genes"". I made a compy with a t-rex's roar and an ankylosaur's club tail. Mean little anklebiter took out a pack of raptors."
gaming,3c7szs,jimbobhas,The Star Wars and Harry Potter games are also fantastic.
gaming,3c7szs,RugbyAndBeer,Missed Nightcrawler and Rogue but what a great game.

gaming,3c7szs,KRajification,Pick up Lego Jurassic Park if you're into Jurassic Park. I'm playing it now and it's honestly my fav lego game to date.
gaming,3c7szs,barnes80,"100% the game recently, was a lot of fun, shame I've nothing left to do in it now"
gaming,3c7szs,Asmor,Just a heads up: You'll get stuck at 99%. You need to beat the last level again to get 100%. I was panicking that my game was glitched.
gaming,3c7szs,Unserene,"They're making another one to, it follows both avengers movies, coming out like Sep or Oct"
gaming,3c7szs,progdrummer,"I have a feeling it's not gonna be as good, considering it only follows the movies, and not its own storyline."
gaming,3c7szs,Devonic96,Plus they already packed so much into the first. I can't imagine it being particularly fun to re-earn all of the mostly same characters again. Plus New York was so much fun to play in but I don't think it'd be fun to do it again. They would have to add a whole new level hub which I don't really see happening. I'll play it for the levels but I don't know if I will be able to 100% it like I did the first.
gaming,3c7szs,progdrummer,"I dunno. Every single LEGO game I've played since LEGO Star Wars has been high-quality without exception. Some of the older ones are a bit boring these days since they've tweaked and innovated a bit, but I'd expect nothing short of a solid game.\n\nThey haven't let us down yet."

gaming,3c7szs,YetAnother_WhiteGuy,"Dude I wish they could make THIS game but not LEGO and not pg 3, open-world Marvel ultimate alliance? PLEASE."
gaming,3c7szs,ayakokiyomizu,"So does each character control uniquely from the others? I haven't played a LEGO game since the two Star Wars ones, where you had like six templates (Jedi, Sith, Astromech, Protocol, Kid, Gunner) each character would be based on and a few odd unique ones (Yoda, Darth Maul). It was a cool game, but the actual number of unique characters was pretty low, since most of the characters were palette swaps, and I couldn't imagine that working for a Marvel game."
gaming,3c7szs,CapMSFC,"Eh, there's still the use of templates, but there are many more of them and also mix-and-match powers (plus some unique characters of course) so it's not as bad."
gaming,3c7szs,TheHandyman1,"When I get high and play this game I get lost in the visuals sometimes. I mean, some of those Asgard levels are insane. I got flashbacks to the only time I used LSD and also played Geometry Wars for the first time without any instructions on how to play."
gaming,3c7szs,kurisu7885,LEGO game characters talk now? Haven't played since the Star Wars and Indiana Jones games and back then it was all kind of mumbling and nonsense words like the Sims. Do they still do that just with added subtitles or have they just learned to speak?
gaming,3c7szs,ayakokiyomizu,"They've been speaking since Batman 2 IIRC, not mumbles with subtitles, full voice acting. And it is great, ads a lot to the game. If you watched the movie, you should know that the same actors from the movie did the game, including Chris Pratt."
gaming,3c7szs,ayakokiyomizu,"Lego Marvel Super Heroes IMDb link\n\nThe only actor I recognize from the Marvel movies (/live action TV) is Clark Gregg.  And of course Stan Lee.  So I'm not really sure what you're talking about here.\n\n(Clark Gregg voiced Coulson in the animated show Ultimate Spider-Man too.  I was pretty impressed that he'd do that, since for some reason, I don't know if it's budget or otherwise, voice-acted versions of live-action characters tend to be done by sound-alikes.)"
gaming,3c7szs,kurisu7885,Clark Gregg is a pretty cool guy.
gaming,3c7szs,Kaemdar,"It translates well to Coulson on Agents of SHIELD, that's one of my favorite MCU characters now."
gaming,3c7szs,punkminkis,"Same here, of any character that's not super powered or a genius Coulson is easily a favorite, and it's awesome that Clark Gregg has voiced every iteration so far.\n\nI really want an official minifigure of him."
gaming,3c7szs,beastinr0cks,"Sorry, I meant the LEGO Movie game!"
gaming,3c7szs,BadBoyJH,"Sound-alikes there too, I'm afraid.  The cast from the movie is only credited as ""archive footage"", meaning the cutscenes that they ripped directly from the movie.  (I thought it was pretty cool that it was the first movie they could actually rip whole scenes for, as opposed to just voice clips.)"
gaming,3c7szs,ayakokiyomizu,"Oh, I thought they actually made the game too! Now I'm sad."
gaming,3c7szs,TKDbeast,"Aw, I'm sorry.  If it's any consolation I think the sound-alikes did a terrific job.  We had to look up whether it was really the movie actors or not when we played."
gaming,3c7szs,JediGuyB,"They DID do an awesome job, I actually thought it was Chris Pratt doing his voice."
gaming,3c7szs,Arbys-sword,easy mistake to make when they want you to think it is really them :)
gaming,3c7szs,JediGuyB,Stan Lee\n\n\nEXCELSIOR!
gaming,3c7szs,Arbys-sword,He also voices Coulson in Marvel Heroes but it seems no one cares for that game.
gaming,3c7szs,pacmain1,"To me, I think it removed something from the game. The lego games were amazing, telling great stories without needing to say anything.\n\nI've not played one with voice actors that I've enjoyed."
gaming,3c7szs,Masternoob411,"I thought the same way, but I reluctantly came around to it.  In a way I wish they were still doing the silly little dialogue-less cutscenes, but I did enjoy Lego Batman 2, voices and all.  Especially Clancy Brown as Lex Luthor."
gaming,3c7szs,_PM_ME_YOUR_SECRETS_,"Some are a little eh imo, like Iron Man's, but overall, they're fairly good."
gaming,3c7szs,progdrummer,"They talk now. If it is based on a specific movie (Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit) they use dialogue from the movies, while if it is more of an original story (Batman, Avengers) it uses it's own dialogue.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if we see a remade LEGO Star Wars with dialogue from the movies. Especially with Episode VII coming out."
gaming,3c7szs,_PM_ME_YOUR_SECRETS_,Lego Jurassic park used some original voice acting and movie acting.
gaming,3c7szs,prophetofgreed,"Similar to Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit when people in the free roam world talk, I take it?"
gaming,3c7szs,MLPJake,"Yes, just thought to add to your list"
gaming,3c7szs,progdrummer,LEGO games have had voice acting starting with LEGO Batman 2.
gaming,3c7szs,soylentsandwich,"There's also a reference to the incredibles as well. I can't remember the exact place, but reed Richards is carrying a few of the fantastic four off of a plane or something and is being a parachute. He says, I saw this in a movie once"
gaming,3c7szs,MineWiz,That's so awesome tempted to buy this now
gaming,3c7szs,cuddleskunk,"You definitely should. As a fan I know I will sound pretty biased but Lego Marvel really is an awesome game. Anyone who is a fan of anything Marvel should definitely play it. It's a great original story and also has TONS of Easter eggs similar to the OP. And the list of characters is insane. Obviously all the big timers are in it, but more obscure (at least to the more mainstream players who aren't necessarily comic fans) characters are as well such as H.E.R.B.I.E, Howard The Duck, and Beta Ray Bill among many more."

gaming,3c7szs,ExcavatorPi,"It's from The Avengers.  Cap's been on ice for a while and so he's slowly acclimating himself to the past 50 years or so of pop culture.  There's another neat scene where he just writes down stuff to look up in a little flip notebook, and they customized it for international releases, with the constants seeming to be Thai Food and Star Wars / Trek.\n\nIronically, The Wizard of Oz (with the flying monkeys reference he understands in the clip I linked to) came out in 1939, before he became Captain America and went out of the loop."

gaming,3c7ecp,EvrythingISayIsRight,"Back in vanilla through Lich King I was the GM of a top 5 raid guild on Lightninghoof in the Americas. Long story short, we had an officer disappear on us for a week.  His sister actually connected with me on Facebook and informed me that he had passed away. I changed his note to something similar. \n\nWhen I made the announcement at the next guild meeting we had a moment of silence, and one of the psych majors we had raiding with us provided one on one counseling. The player who had passed was with us forever, and we were all very close. \n\nWhen I quit at the end of Lich King I made the new GM promise me that he would never be kicked from the guild and his note never modified, and that she would pass that along to GMs of the future. \n\nIt's quite heartbreaking to go through when such a harsh reality enters your sub-reality that is just meant for fun.\n\nEDIT: Because it's being asked 100x, the guild I believe started out as Ascension, then was Resurgence for most of its life, then we changed names once more after absorbing some guilds that fell apart when WotLK came out, but I don't remember that final name."
gaming,3c7ecp,Sp4rt4n423,"I missed Vanilla, but I played through TBC and most of WotLK, and the community that game built will probably never be seen again. When that game had secrets and mysteries it was without equal, and even with millions of players the trolling was game play based instead of childish rants. There may have been MMO's before, but WoW was the first one to be a life in itself, and instances like yours are exactly what made it so. Getting 25 people together to overcome challenges is so much more than what you do in real life with friends for entertainment."

gaming,3c7ecp,Guyote_,"i assume you and your fellow SWG babies know about /r/swgemu, correct?"
gaming,3c7ecp,Gewehr98,"And I've never found that in an MMO since, except possibly for Eve. The rest of them that I take a stab at almost inevitably turn out to be filled with largely wankers."
gaming,3c7ecp,CoffeeAndCigars,"I think it's a stronger focus on PvP nowadays. Back in our day (imagine the old man voice if you wish), we made our own PvP. It wasn't really a major game feature."
gaming,3c7ecp,reivers,"World PvP throughout every leveling zone and ten+ hour AVs was my jam. \n\nI don't think it's so much the focus on PvP modes as it's the ridiculous ease with which you can do PvE. You don't have to form any kind of community to do it anymore. Yolo your way to level cap, grind whatever it is you like grinding and hit whatever the MMO dejour's equivalent of Raid Finder is and voila. \n\nIt's a bit different from when you had to form a good community with good people to get anywhere. Now you can just join whatever pops up on your screen as you faff about the newbie zone and faceroll yourself to whatever goal you have in mind."
gaming,3c7ecp,CoffeeAndCigars,"Less so focus on PvP and moreso a focus on making everything extremely convenient so you can just ""drop in and play"". But that's not really how MMOs functioned back in the day. If you wanted something, you might have to work on it for a few days or weeks, but now in wow and it's clones you have to be on for maybe an hour to get a piece of the best gear, and more importantly, without having to converse with other people."
gaming,3c7ecp,ThinKrisps,"Hah, you know I've never really though of it like that, but if I'm being really honest with myself I think I could point to character traits I picked up for the older dudes in my raiding guild when I was younger.\n\nI know there was an older woman in a really, really old MMO that gave me an earful over IRC and pretty much changed my life and how I treated people."
gaming,3c7ecp,JustinsWorking,"Same here. I was 11 when I started playing. At 13-14 I was raid leader, but no one except the GL and a couple officers knew my age, because we 3 way called each other and put our phones to speaker mode during raids."

gaming,3c7ecp,b0Xer,"My comment from a League thread the other day about an eerily similar topic - \n\nFor me it's the people I played with in World of Warcraft, back in 2005-06. Back before Real ID was implemented, before Facebook and Steam were everywhere.\n\nI logged on to my very first main, and there were dozens of names of friends who I haven't talked to in more than seven years, and have no way of finding. I was in my first guild with these people, spent weekends sitting online at night talking to them, getting help with my homework. One of them, Fnar, bought me my first mount, which was a huge deal back then. My guild leader and I were in-game pen pals, she helped me through my depression when I was younger.\n\nI still have a single piece of mail from her, transferred from character to character, sent to a completely new account where now it sits on my main, a simple message of ""It's nice to hear you're doing well :) "" I don't even know if she's still alive anymore, I don't know what happened to any of them.\n\nI miss them."
gaming,3c7ecp,Admiralolz,"Back when I was fourteen I joined a 10-man raiding guild in WoW and developed some very close friendships with my mates there. One of them, a 16 year old Canadian girl, was very depressed. Me, living in the U.S., would call her when she would start talking about her suicidal thoughts and talk her down from the ledge for about 2 hours. This happened a handful of occassions to the point where, on my parents' phone bill, they would wonder why I keep calling this number in Canada and immediately suspected a porn line. I eventually had to get a job to pay for those phone calls but I still have an e-mail saved I got from her almost six years later saying, ""I've just finished university and you're a main reason as to why I'm still alive today, so I wanted to drop you a line and say thank you."" \n\nThe community in MMOs like WoW were so utterly beneficial for so many people."

gaming,3c7ecp,tafsonworks,will probably never be seen again\n\n\nIt's seen again all the time. Just less likely with increasing age. You approach your first mmo by just let it happen with no expectations. And you have plenty of time to waste in your youth. And your mind is open for everything.\n\nThe second mmo you try to repeat was once was. But you have less patience as you now value your time much higher. And you have high expectations.
gaming,3c7ecp,soddi,"Yes, fully agree. The first MMO people get invested in is magical for them. It was for me with anarchy online, but when WOW came around it was ""just another MMO"". The magic wasn't there for me, even though I played through all of the expansions."
gaming,3c7ecp,648262,"I do agree. Especially with the last part. At one point in WotLk we had two 25 man's and an alt raid. The two 25 man's ran at the same time. It was quite eventful when new content came out.  Some little part of me misses leading... But I took on too many responsibilities. I was GM, plus I was the raid leader and main tank for the main 25 man group. \n\nIt was intense, it was fun, but it sucked your whole life away."
gaming,3c7ecp,Sp4rt4n423,"Generally that's the most significant role in most of the fights when raiding, followed by the primary single-target healer. I raided as MT in TBC and healed through WotLK until returning to tanking in Cata. If the tank messes up or goes down, generally the rest of his raid will die, period. If a DPS or two died, it might still be possible to finish. If the main healer couldn't keep up with the damage the MT was taking, the raid would die. Thus the MT is the most important individual member in a raid, followed by the primary healer, and then the OTs and healers, then DPS. Of course some fights were easy to tank but required significant DPS so that the boss died in a set amount of time before the damage became too much to tank or heal through, and some fights were checks on the healers too. It was a great time raiding back in the day..."

I wonder what happened but slowly forget. He logs on in about 2 years time, already in wotlk. I ask him what's up since I have so many good memories with him. He tells me basically he went on a family trip, and he tripped from a rock and stayed several weeks in hospital and then just forgot about WoW, decided to enjoy life as much as he could. But this day he bought a subscription just to try it out again. He played for several days, then never came back again, but that was my first good WoW buddy and I still miss the times very much :(.

gaming,3c7ecp,dails08,this made me sad.
gaming,3c7ecp,Bad_Internet_Name,me too. So many good times.  If any of my old friends ever signed on from Vanilla I'd lose my shit.  I'm an attorney now and I would find a way to track them and give them gifts.  I was too young to realize how good our guild relationships were compared to other video games to appreciate them.
gaming,3c7ecp,Lobstrositiesbitme,"Yeah, back in vanilla I taught a girl how to play and we ran around and did quests and killed stuff. But then she got burnt out right before BC and stopped coming on. I waited for her to come on for Burning Crusade and then Wrath of the Lich King. Then she logged on one day a level 42 warlock during the end of Wotlk and I tried messaging her. She responded in broken English and I knew her account got taken over and her characters stripped of everything :("
gaming,3c7ecp,MrKrazybones,"I had played around with end game content in Vanilla, but BC was when I started raiding seriously.  I made a guild with some really great people who were all as inexperienced as I was and we stuck together for most of the expansion.  Looking back on it we weren't very good, but the progression was what was really fun.\n\nI took some time off around the launch of Wrath and when I came back many had left except for three of them who were still on the same toons with raiding guilds of their own.  One of them was even server first KT and Malygos."

He helped me get over my then depression by being funny kind and just an all around awesome person. \n\nI told him about my depression and how he had helped me get out of it, he then told me he had depression aswell and had social anxiety but games made him open and made him able to socialize with other people. From that day forward I logged on everyday and played with him for about 1 year and then one day he just messaged me really slowly ""Thank you for being here with me, for understanding me and helping me. I am glad I have helped you but I am sad to say I have to go"" \n\nI wrote in caps and spammed his chat with ""WHY???? ANSWER ME! PLEASE!"" \nbut he never answered and he has never come online since.

gaming,3c7ecp,MLeth,If I died and my character had to be left anywhere I'd want it to be in Zangarmarsh. I remember when I first entered that zone when Burning Crusade released and it just felt like this huge mysterious zone was awaiting me. And the music was so serene. I don't play much anymore but occasionally I'll resub just to level an alt and whenever I get into Zangarmarsh I usually stick around for a while just to soak in the calm atmosphere.

I'm still surprised at how much I loved that minigame, not so much in and of itself, but because it gave my character context. I knew then what I was fighting for and where I would like to go when the fight ended (assuming I survived in the van). \n\nFunny thing is that irl I'm no farmer, far from it, but both myself and my Hunter have never felt like they had a place in the world, and that farm is one of the few places I found some semblance of home.

gaming,3c7ecp,ArgentIV,"Hardest thing I have ever had to do was to cancel my mom's Wow subscription in feburary when she passed away.. But I am left with the memories of her playing wow for 10 years.. the joy she had when she played was amazing. \n\nOk so since im sitting here crying I think I need to bring the mood up a bit.. let me regal you in a story of how my mom played wow.. Back in the days of Elemental Plateau farming my mom (Gnome Mage) who just loved to farm wanted to farm up on the plateau the problem was that it was infested with tons of horde (mostly rogues) who would kill any ally who landed, let alone farm.. So one evening over Vent she tells me to come to her she needs some help.. I see shes at the plateau so I log on my OP ret pally and fly up there to handle some hordies that are messing with my mom.. I land.. and there she is just farming her little heart away.. I walk up to her as I get close I get triple attacked, 3 rogues were using her as bait. Now I want to say I was super OP and killed them all. but alas I did die.. now comes the strange thing.. mom walks over to me and starts to /cry over my dead body. I release and run back and rez up and quickly heal.. getting ready for round 2. but like the predator movies.. the rogues unstealth and wave at me.. my mom had Befriended the horde to a point that they were protecting her. I of course ask her how she did it.. her answer was amazing. \n\nShe flew up there.. unmounted.. and began farming.. of course she was killed quickly she would run back.. rez up and hug the rogue that killed her.. then dance. they would kill her again.. she would do it again.. Eventually they grew to love my mom's little gnome mage and just let her farm without harrassing her.. ever so often a new horde would appear and attack but they would always protect her.. tell the horde to stop and they would.. Of course word gets around on the forums and people find out my mom (74 year old great grandma) plays wow.. has a Grand Master title.. and loved to raid.. alas the last 2 years have not been kind to her in WOW.. she felt alone as her old guild left and she really couldnt raid like she used to.. but she loved to fly around and play the game.. \n\nLove you mom.. (Inua the Gnome mage)"
gaming,3c7ecp,Flixsl,I loved reading your story. I would just randomly chat with people questing or farming areas. It's fun making micro-communities while doing dull things like farming. I found those players to be more fun than the ones who sat around the major cities. God Bless your mom.

gaming,3c7ecp,NFTrot,"I played vanilla with like 6 or 7 friends from elementary/high school. Every night we'd be on vent, talking about life and the game - meeting up at dungeon portals to summon each other. I remember how amazing everything was at the time. Such an immersive game, especially before the LFG feature was added."
gaming,3c7ecp,medieval_warrior,Cherish those bonds man.\n\nThose type of friends are rare.
gaming,3c7ecp,Necrotic_Moose,"Statistically speaking, anyone who ever played a MMO and been in a guild, would likely know people that are now dead. You just don't know that, because you either quit or they just never logged back in.\n\nThat's what this made me think of. How many people I talked to on the internet are now forever gone?"
gaming,3c7ecp,LiudvikasT,"I'm kind of living one of these moments right now, I'll give some story into it.\n\nMy guild I'm the GM has been going pretty strong without a real hiccup since BC. Never really had to actively recruit because everybody was friends of friends. Fast forward and our raid team finally dipped in February from 14 to 7. No drama really, just a couple close knit groups quitting at the same time, all IRL friends and such. \n\nWe still wanted to work together so with the new bnet system and LFG tool we started looking for pug players to join. One week we get this rogue who was very patient with our wipes on what is a new boss to us. No pug wants to go through any learning wipes, they're there for the kill and loot basically. \n\nShe was very patient and helped us fine tune how we approached the encounter. Immediately after raid she whispered me and said she thought our group was a lot of fun and gave me her email to add her to bnet friends. \n\nWe hit it off from there, as two friends hanging out and as an addition to our raid group. She had the same random sense of humor as the rest of us, very fun to be around when she opened up. I asked her one night what's the problem, she had been really distant and short with all her answers. She came out with it and said she's been fighting chronic myeloid luekemia. I guess before she had a chance to go into detail I went to look up more on the condition and I was hopeful I guess at some of the things I read.\n\nIt appears she had been dealing with it since she was 6. She's 18 now, and going through advanced stages of the disease. Her actual life story was even more tragic than that, but that's not a part of this story. She have very few friends, online or off. She pushed people away because she was scared to hurt them. She knew she was going to pass soon, and didn't want peopel to be close or sad over her. \n\nI basically said screw that and went on some stupid personal crusade to be the good friend I thought she needed. Somebody that was polite and respectful, could try and lift her up when she wasn't feeling well. Just be a good friend you know, it's hard to explain. \n\nI've only known her for 3 months and in that time we became best friends. The last treatment attempted was around the time we met, maybe a week after. She was trying to cope with the fact the doctors said at this point she might not see the end of the summer. \n\nShe's been living in the hospital since a month or two before we met. Yesterday on the 4th since she couldn't leave to go celebrate with the couple friends she had, or her family which she's really not that close with for reasons, the two of us decided to hang out and play games. We played wow, did a pug raid or two to get some alts some gear, shared some real laughs, played some counter strike together. Just hung out all day and night. Late night she says she's going to sleep, so I'm alright I'll log off too. \n\nI open bnet to message a friend that's still in game, and this was maybe 15-20 minutes after we logged off. I see her name pop back on, and it's from the character she rolled on my realm after we became friends she didn't like playing the monk so it's odd to be on that toon\n\nI didn't think a lot of it, so I finish my conversation and go to sleep. \n\nI wake up and there's several in game mail from her, saying she couldn't find the nerve when we were playing together or on ventrilo to say it then so she waited for me to go to bed. She thanked me for being the greatest guy she ever met and for being the best friend she could ever ask for. She told me if she has one last wish is that I go out and impact somebodys life the way I did hers. \n\nHer condition had deteriorated considerably in the last two weeks, I picked up on it a little from conversation but our interactions don't deal with the downsides of life too much, we try to focus on smiling and having fun. The most I'll do is ask her how she is feeling, or how she is doing. I won't poke and prod. So based on her condition, she was being moved to another ward in the hospital. She said she really doesn't have much time left and to top it off, the section they're moving her in doesn't have internet access so her pc is basically a paper weight now to her. So she said her goodbyes and thank you's.\n\nI know she's not gone yet, but I'll be man enough to admit I've been crying off and on the entire day. \n\nTo top it off we had a conversation one day where I saw her steam profile and said ""I don't like that your profile comment says you're your own best friend, I'm going to change your mind and have you change that to me"" We joked about it, at the end of the last letter she said PS, check my steam profile. The tears wouldn't stop, she changed it. \n\nI left a message saying if she's allowed to leave the ward at any point and has the strength to do so, find some wifi and come say hello. Somebody said if I knew the hospital I might be able to give her a call, but trying to narrow down the hospital in a city, not so easy. \n\nSo she's not gone, but those letters sure made it feel like it. I felt like I've known her my entire life and it's heartbreaking I tell you."

One guy was really cool, and we called him ""cook"". He liked cooking up food for everyone to use before we went out PKing, I thought it was pretty weird, but cool because I don't have to buy food. He was a genuine dude. I heard he passed away online one day after I asked where he was. It was a lot less nonchalant than it is for me to say now.. He was the first person I had ever really had a relationship with that ceased to exist. I had never actually met him. My friend that knew him asked if I wanted to go to his funeral a few weeks later after school, it was very random and out of no where for me. Meeting him for the first time while he was lifeless in his coffin was a very surreal experience.\nRest in peace, Justin."

In late 2012 she started letting some of the people she was close to know that she had cancer and was considered terminal and in May of 2013 we got a message on our boards from her daughter letting us know that she had passed away and that she wanted to make sure we were notified.

gaming,3c7ecp,ShadowSt,"I used to play City of Heroes, and there was a rather prominent community member who went by Ascendant. He was a big part of the role playing community and was generally just a great guy. He was rather famous for having an AFK macro set up that cycled him through a cellphone conversation with his hero's agent Sal that went on at length about the ridiculous merchandise coming out that he hadn't approved like an action figure with his non-existent raptor sidekick and laser vision, which wasn't one of his powers, or the terrible saturday morning cartoon that got it all wrong, and most famously Ascendant-O's, a cereal purported to contain a substance that was the source of his power, when it was actually his one weakness, which almost led to his death when he opened a box.\n\nSadly, Ascendant passed away mere months before the game shut down unexpectedly. The community was just devastated to lose such a fantastic guy and we all had a wonderful gathering with a candlelight vigil in the starter zone. One of the devs even mentioned that had the game not been canned suddenly, they would have tried to make his character a member of the game's premier Supergroup that had just lost two big members and he would have become a huge part of the game. As is, we have several successor projects in the works by programmers, artists and designers who were all fans of the original game, and at least one has promised that when they get their game out, it will feature a memorial plaza named after him with an in-game plaque detailing how Ascendant gave his life to save the world.\n\nWe were also surprised and delighted to find out that Mercedes Lackey herself was actually a City of Heroes player, and a month or so after the news broke, she mentioned that she was working on a collaborative publishing project with a few other authors that revolved around super heroes, and that she had obtained permission to use the Ascendant cell phone blurb in the book, probably as some kind of background happening for a good laugh, as a tribute to Ascendant so that he'll be immortalized there as well. To my knowledge this book hasn't been published yet, but I'm keeping my ear to the ground.\n\nIt really is heart-warming to know that MMO's can foster such a close community even among many hundreds or thousands of players and across any distance."

gaming,3c7hrn,LumoPlaysPC,"Hey OP, how is the moto 360? I'm dying to get one but I decided to wait for the second one to come out soon. How's the watch overall?"
gaming,3c7hrn,SentientKayak,"wait for the second. I bought mine for 150$ 2 months ago, and I absolutely love it, but at this point waiting would prolly be your best bet."
gaming,3c7hrn,Midnaspet,"I second this.. i got mine for 150.. and love everything about it.. i had to wait for it to go down, i couldnt justify buying it for 250+. But if u can spare the 150 id say go for it!"
gaming,3c7hrn,Jarrett1604,"thirded, did the same a couple months ago. So far I love it. I've got a similar theme, but I like this one a lot better. Could I get the source?"

gaming,3c7hrn,jest3rxD,"Fourthed, I got mine about a year ago and like it but can really see how the next iteration will be vastly superior."
gaming,3c7hrn,Prophage7,"Fifthed, I got mine as a gift and absolutely love it, but the next one will be way better."
gaming,3c7hrn,a_talking_face,Seventhed! Wait... Fuck!
gaming,3c7hrn,RinconDrone,New Price is $150 now might be because the release for the new one is right around the corner.
gaming,3c7hrn,Mayooonaise,"Hey OP I'm thinking about getting one and I was just wondering, whats the deal with having one on an airplane? Do they have like a ""flight mode"" or something to disable the wireless stuff ?"
gaming,3c7hrn,xilpaxim,Honestly it works off bluetooth and/or wifi.. if your cell is off it only counts steps and tells time.. it as soon as you turn your phone on it updates the watch to current  time.
gaming,3c7hrn,VFTVMV1,"Man you need to look into what your watch did more. There is a calculator you can install, calendar, you can set timers and alarms, listen to music offline with Bluetooth, all without your phone."
gaming,3c7hrn,QuerulousPanda,Really?? I do occasionally send texts and make phone calls while driving (it automatically connects via bluetooth)
gaming,3c7hrn,lhamil64,"Wait, how would you listen to music via Bluetooth without your phone? That sounds impossible."
gaming,3c7hrn,Butchering_it,internal storage. most smartwatches have it
gaming,3c7hrn,joedl1,"I've been considering getting one. I feel like spending more than $150 on a smartwatch (when I might find I don't use it often) would be a little much. Would you say its worth getting one now for $150 or waiting for the new generation to come out? Would I still be able to find the previous generation new (hopefully on Amazon, since I have gift credit) once the next generation is released?"
gaming,3c7hrn,DoctaMag,"The only thing I see the next gen having over the old 360 is a smaller profile, mabey better battery, and update support for a longer period. I would say spring for the current model, I find mine very useful, although I do depend on the GPS directions more than most due to my job."
gaming,3c7hrn,ReventonPro,I hate the flat tire design. The display is round except for that odd section that's completely black..it would look better without it.
gaming,3c7hrn,homers_lovechild,"I've literally never noticed it, and I've been wearing my moto 360 for almost a year now.\n\nIt's really not that big of a deal.  Do you own the thing, or just don't like the design?"
gaming,3c7hrn,brynm,It was unavoidable at the time of launch. MKBHD explains why in his Moto 360 video.
gaming,3c7hrn,Sixstringsmash,"If you want the battery to last all day don't play with it too much. also the screen stays on while charging. that concerns me because of the heat it generates while charging also shortening the battery and screen life. there is an option to turn the screen off but doesn't always work. there is a work around app that fakes it by displaying a black image.\n\nI've regulated it use to just excising. I'm scared my clumsiness is going to break it. \nThere is a screen protector and side wall stickers for it on amazon. it's cheap and works well.\n\nthere are apps that let you make watch faces on your phone and upload them to it, which  is really cool.

gaming,3c7hrn,IAmGortume,The battery is actually really good as long as you don't have the ambient screen on. Easily lasts me about a day and a half. Also if you don't want the screen on while charging just make sure theater modes enabled if it worries you that much. I guarantee that method will work 100% of the time.
gaming,3c7hrn,GriffinPoop,I'm waiting for gen 2 as well but these price cuts are getting to me.
gaming,3c7hrn,IAmGortume,I'm in the same boat as you... probably going to wait for the second iteration that's rumored to be released this month. I know I wouldn't be able to stand that black bar at the bottom and I hear the battery life is somewhat poor
gaming,3c7hrn,Leov2,I think there's a larger chance the second iteration will be coming in September
gaming,3c7hrn,brynm,I think the rumor is Q2 to Q3. Any reason you think it'll be in Sept?
gaming,3c7hrn,hannibalhooper14,"I'm not OP but I've owned four smartwatches (Moto 360, LG G Watch, Apple Watch and Asus Zen Watch). The first day I got my LG G, I was waiting for my SIM card for my new phone to arrive. So I had it paired up with a phone that could get no notifications and I was initially disappointed.\n\nBut afterwards (as in putting a SIM into my phone), it just became incredible. I couldn't believe how useful it was. The first text I sent my brother while driving really made me a believer in smart watches. Even using voice to text on Google or voice messages on iOS makes you reach for your phone, navigate the phone display to your messages and then do your business. On a tiny watch you press ""Reply"" on the message and speak without taking your eyes off the road. Also, with a smaller phone like an iPhone 5 or a Xperia Z3 Compact - taking it out of your pocket and putting it back in is pretty easy.\n\nBut if you have a 5.5"" - 6"" phone, pulling it out of your pocket to tell the time, check a text, change a song becomes annoying (especially in skinnier jeans) or in shorts while at the gym can be really annoying and even dangerous - as in you can easily drop your phone taking it in and out.\n\nNo more with a smartwatch. Not to mention some of them are seriously, seriously beautiful, the Moto 360 being the best looking one overall in my opinion. And they're so dirt cheap right now! Check for some on Swappa or eBay and you'll find a great deal."

gaming,3c7hrn,Redditaintblocked,Is that the first pebble or the pebble time? I just ordered my pebble and would love that.
gaming,3c7hrn,justinogo,"Pebble steel. so, basically the original pebble, but a little more professional looking."
gaming,3c7hrn,TheGameboy,"Ahh cool, are the apps and faces the same with both? Or does the Steel have its own catalog?"
gaming,3c7hrn,hybridsilence,The same I believe.
gaming,3c7hrn,TheGameboy,"steel and original are the same, apps should be cross compatible. i havent looked into the Time very much, as i just got the steel 7 months ago."

gaming,3c7hrn,tiltowaitt,urghhh. I dont think i could get over the little bit of non screen there at the bottom. It would grind my gears every time I looked at it.
gaming,3c7hrn,president2038,"You really don't notice it after a few seconds. I have a 360 and it never bothered me,  even though I though it would."
gaming,3c7hrn,tplee,"There's also some pixelation around the edge of the screen because of the chamfered glass. And it's a huge watch, so it doesn't look good on a lot of people."
gaming,3c7hrn,president2038,"I still think the Samsung Gear S Version is my favorite. Your limbs (on the watch face, obviously) become crippled as your battery percentage goes down. Pair it with a Three Dog Ringtone and a green scanline background and it's probably the closest thing to a modern day Pip Boy you'll have."
gaming,3c7hrn,tplee,Dear lord that is the most hedious looking watch I've ever seen. It looks like a digital wrist sweat band.
gaming,3c7hrn,jesterk1ng,"It's certainly not the most graceful solution out there, but definitely the most practical. I have a metal band on mine and an analog watch face, it looks very nice. I will say in general I'm more of a fan aesthetically with what Motorola did with the 360, but there's a reason the Gear S is so big. It basically is (and unfortunately, to some degree, LOOKS like) a smartphone on your wrist."

gaming,3c7hrn,_Jet,Its a bug on moto 360. It doesnt reset or count steps very well.

gaming,3c7hrn,GarciaJones,I got one for the Pebble watch. It counts your steps and it also shows the weather when you flick your wrist too.\n\nFor those with a Pebble its called PIP BOY 100 in the watch faces.
gaming,3c7hrn,Koneesha,"Man, if they can just fix the design to not require the screen space so they can have a perfect circle instead of missing the bottom 5mm, that would be one hell of an appealing watch."

gaming,3c81bm,iBleeedorange,"Why was vault tech so twisted? Instead of the vaults being a means of survival, they turned into experiments with the test subjects being forced into it."
gaming,3c81bm,Kickmekicku,"The Vaults were constructed in order to perform experiments that could provide the Enclave data for the travel to and subsequent colonization of an unmentioned planet in a separate solar system. \n\nThis also explains the purpose of Vaults 111 and 112, whose experiments both test the use of cryonics in life preservation, something which could be invaluable to surviving a long journey in space. Other Vaults such as 11 and 92 were more intended for studying human behavior and using the data in building the Enclave's new society. \n\nThis is from Van Buren, what would have been Fallout 3 if Bethesda didn't win their lawsuit. I'm taking it as canon because it is explained nowhere else what the true purpose of the Vault experiments was."
gaming,3c81bm,Revelations216,"If Bethesda didn't win their lawsuit, the Fallout series would have been just a couple of games we fondly remember playing back in the late 90s and early 2000s.  Eventually it might have Duke Nukem'ed, with some shitty release just shoved out the door."
gaming,3c81bm,Kooreth,"I'm just going to say the original Fallout 3, Van Buren, was looking to be a better game than Bethesda's official Fallout 3. The design documents are pretty indicative of that. I like Bethesda's Fallout 3, but I wouldn't call it a great Fallout game with respect to its world design."
gaming,3c81bm,Revelations216,"Van Buren was cancelled in 2003 when all of the staff were laid off by Interplay.  The Bethesda lawsuit was about Interplay trying to hold onto fallout online rights, and didn't happen until 2009.  Bethesda didn't kill Van Buren, Interplay mismanaged the shit out of the franchise, and then sold it off.  I'm hoping Disney will do as good of a job resurrecting the Star Wars Franchise as Bethesda did with Fallout."
gaming,3c81bm,Kooreth,"I don't really think the two are comparable, but that's just me. Beth took Fallout from a CRPG to a FPS with RPG aspects, making it very different. Your thought would be like Star Wars becoming a drama under Disney."
gaming,3c81bm,Tictac472,"Only if they had the money for it. And this is the biggest problem in video game development, money. As a publisher wants a game released as early as possible to earn money, they often cut out content. Fallout new Vegas could have been much bigger if Bethesda had not rushed obsidian, for example."
gaming,3c81bm,RenseBenzin,New Vegas was much better regarding that. In terms of overall richness of the world and plot I'd happily place NV above FO3.
gaming,3c81bm,Angus-Zephyrus,"I'd love to read more about this, what's your favorite source on this canon?"
gaming,3c81bm,ZackLabel,"""the Enclave's plan was originally to go to space and colonize another planet"" - Tim Cain\n\nand\n\nhttp://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Bloomfield_Space_Center_design_document\n\nI'd take Tim's quote as making the space travel concept canon, because I think Bethesda would have to be crazy to deny what a lead developer of the first Fallout states regarding the Vaults."
gaming,3c81bm,Revelations216,"Also it's generally a safe rule that if ""old canon"" is not actually contradicted by ""new canon"", it still holds."
gaming,3c81bm,Aldheim,I also think vault Tec didn't expect the war to happen. So they just wanted the human experimentation.
gaming,3c81bm,Grinddbass,I thought it was because Vault Tech didn't think nuclear war was actually going to happen and the vaults were just ways to scam people into being test subjects.
gaming,3c81bm,IAMBen_SchulzAMA,"Members of the Enclave expected the war, and contracted Vault Tec, who may have been unaware of the Enclave's purpose for the Vaults."
gaming,3c81bm,Revelations216,"These are undiscovered non-control vaults. Imagine every person in Fallout that isn't a Ghoul, they came from a vault. Thing is their vault story isn't extreme so we don't hear about it."
gaming,3c81bm,Hayden11121,"Oh i see, thank you, still fucked up that they did social experiments like these though."
gaming,3c81bm,Kickmekicku,"Fallout's world is basically one with a disproportionate amount of desperate extremists. Normality as we know it, didn't exist."
gaming,3c81bm,LukaCola,"That's not true. Some people survived without the vaults and didn't become ghouls. Take Manya Vargas and her ancestors for example. Sure, we may have a skewed view on how many weird experimental vaults there were compared to control vaults, but we still can't find any real justification for any of the experiments."
gaming,3c81bm,4CAMan,"Where did it say that her ancestors weren't in a vault? Plenty of people are born outside of vaults, but I always thought that pretty much everyone who wasn't a ghoul at least had ancestors who weathered the fallout in vaults."
gaming,3c81bm,paleoreef103,"Sorry, meant Manya Vargas. Talk to her about the town's history and it was founded by people who weren't able to get into vaults, so they took shelter in the crater where the plane carrying the megaton bomb crashed."
gaming,3c81bm,4CAMan,"Also Little Lamplight was started as a 4th grade tour group to the Lamplight Caverns, coincidentally on the day the bombs fell. Their teachers left to find food and were claimed by the wasteland. The surviving children began the settlement in the caves."
gaming,3c81bm,LeerooooyGaaaankins,"Okay but LL makes no fucking sense.\n\nSo after the 4th graders were abandoned by their teacher and chaperones, then what? They eat moss and cave bugs for 200 years, kicking out those most adept at survival -- the adults -- while battling super mutants next door? \n\nWhen the 50 kids became adults, they just left their babies and toddlers and went to Big Town?\n\nSpeaking of babies, a girl in LL would have maybe a few years to have 2+ babies in order to sustain the population before being kicked out.\n\nI liked LL, but trying to establish any base logic for it is a moot point."
gaming,3c81bm,2yrnx1lc2zkp77kp,"It doesn't make any sense, but I like to think that most adults knew about LL and would take their unwanted children there. Like Camp Wedontwantcha from the webcomic. So the kids in LL arent the descendants of the first group so much as they're orphaned or unwanted kids from all around the area who got tossed down there (and survived the trip)."
gaming,3c81bm,Deejaymil,Vault 1: 20 yuppy couples with 1.5 children are in a vault replicating life in the suburbs. All adults pass peacefully and the children marry and grow up all with one kinky as fuck fetish.
gaming,3c81bm,Seoul_Surfer,"Well I think many of the R&D parts of the government before the war went partly crazy, probably influenced by the impending conflict with China, and the lack of resources. The government obviously wanted to save lives, but Vault-Tec saw a golden opportunity for experiments that normally wouldn't have ethically been allowed.\n\nFrom the wiki:\n\n""The [Vault-Tec] experiment may be considered a success in terms of the data collected: data that was much more important to the Vault-Tec and Enclave scientists than a few hundred thousand lives. Perhaps they felt that the trade-off was mutual, as most of the vault dwellers would have died anyway if not for the vaults.""\n\nWest Tek, a research firm, were the ones to create the FEV while trying to combat potential Chinese biological warfare. So it all seems to have stemmed from intense paranoia in the lead-up to October 23rd, 2077."
gaming,3c81bm,herrbz,"I'm assuming that the ones that paid full price were sent to pretty normal vaults. I would assume that they also gave away or sold very cheap the access to these experimental vaults. Poor people were forced to either go in these vaults or die with the nukes.  \n\nThis is all speculation though, but if I was an evil company with a monopoly on every US resident's life, that's how I would do it."
gaming,3c81bm,spiritbx,"I don't think they would do that, it would mess up their experiments if they didn't have diversity in their experiments and only used poor people as a testing medium."
gaming,3c81bm,4CAMan,"The vaults weren't intended for use in an actual nuclear war, hence there being so few of them. It's all just enclave experiments."
gaming,3c81bm,SinfulSound,"Because most of those vaults were never meant to be lived in, they were experiments. They created paranoia of war to make people go in them, but they never actually thought the bombs would drop."
gaming,3c81bm,MarcsterS,Every single vault tells a different story. They pretty much are silent characters who go unappreciated mostly.
gaming,3c81bm,deviousmojave,"Vault 11 was one of my favourite vaults to explore and discover the secrets of the experiments. For those not in the know, Vault 11 told all occupants they they had to sacrifice one person every year(?) or they would all be exterminated.\n\nFinally when there were only 5 left they decided that they would defy the computer program that forces them to make the sacrifices as there'd be no point. That's when the computer tells them that by valuing their principles over their lives, they've 'passed' the vault's test and they can now freely come and go in the vault as they please with no repercussions. The 5 committed suicide 4 committed suicide after they found out. You never find out what happened to the fifth."
gaming,3c81bm,hidingfromthequeen,If I remember correct 4 killed themselves and 1 went on to live
gaming,3c81bm,Mad_V,"I may be misremembering, but wasn't that guy murdered by the others before they killed themselves? I kind of remember one guy being all hesitant and stuff in one of the audiologs before all the shots. Someone correct me?"
gaming,3c81bm,Lumpyguy,"There were 4 gunshots and a sigh at the very end, with no gunshot being recorded.  It implies that he got cold feet, didn't go through and left.  If I also remember correctly, the door was found open when you get there.\n\nThe audio log: http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/System_recording:_Vault_11_front_entrance"
gaming,3c81bm,bromeatmeco,"Thanks! I always thought Vault 11 was one of the more creepy ones, because it felt so real. Like it could have actually happened."
gaming,3c81bm,Lumpyguy,The only thing I found creepy in Fallout was that weird Lovecraftian house in Fallout 3. Fuck that place.
gaming,3c81bm,JohnnyOnslaught,Not so much creepy but straight up scary for me was Vault 34. It was like a bad game of Doom mixed with CoD Zombies and I managed to use all the ammo I had for the  riot shotgun in the process
gaming,3c81bm,I_BUILD_ARKS,"Not to mention that you're on the clock, even with a radiation suit and rad x"
gaming,3c81bm,Gyvon,I know! Vaults with constant radiation made me so anxious.
gaming,3c81bm,sidekickman,The Springfield school at the beginning of the game (FO3). There's a jail-style cell in the basement floor filled with baby / child skeletons.
gaming,3c81bm,damnationltd,Which house?
gaming,3c81bm,Butter_slut,http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Dunwich_Building Fuck that place
gaming,3c81bm,JohnnyOnslaught,"I went through it two or three weeks ago. I didn't think it was that creepy, especially since BONGO BONGO BONGO I DON'T WANNA LEAVE THE CONGO OH NO NO NO NO NOOOOO"

gaming,3c81bm,HobKing,As far as I know vault 11 was only in New Vegas.
gaming,3c81bm,selpathor,This was New Vegas
gaming,3c81bm,jemanni,"Been loads of talk lately of who the Vault 11 survivor is, and whether he'll appear in Fallout 4. Though why he'd traipse across the country, I don't know. Possibly to escape the memories of the Mojave."
gaming,3c81bm,herrbz,Maybe the survivor was the courier?
gaming,3c81bm,the_human_oreo,Oh my...
gaming,3c81bm,herrbz,Wouldn't he have a pip boy I he lived in a vault?
gaming,3c81bm,RenseBenzin,Did the skeletons have pipboys on them?
gaming,3c81bm,the_human_oreo,"I expect they'd have been taken pretty quickly by anyone wandering by. Pip boys are a pretty high demand item, and not everyone that had one was a vault dweller either.\n\nRicky from NVs Honest Hearts stole his off a dead prospector."
gaming,3c81bm,NyranK,Pip Boys are a pretty high demand item\n\n\nFuckin' right\n\n:c
gaming,3c81bm,Hello_Cup,"No, you are correct, there was one of the five who didn't want to. The other four killed him first, three of the remaining four killed themselves while the final man walked out of the vault."
gaming,3c81bm,FirstGameFreak,"Oh wow, that's much darker than I thought."
gaming,3c81bm,Lumpyguy,Gets even darker when you realize why the whole place went to hell. It was a very dark vault and I personally find that they deserved it.
gaming,3c81bm,mastersword130,He wrote an extra one on his uniform and decided to forget everything.
gaming,3c81bm,rydan,I love how fucked up this is. It really shows how much thought they put into developing this one little plot to contribute to the entire universe.
gaming,3c81bm,mastersw999,"Mine too. I both love and hate how they left what happened to the 5th person ambiguous. I'd so love for them to flesh it out, have us maybe find that person, but then of course I don't too."

gaming,3c81bm,mynumberistwentynine,"Different strokes for different folks, but IMO, Morrowind was the last Elder Scrolls game that had writing quality which came close to that of Fallout 2 / New Vegas.\nIn Oblivion and Skyrim, you are THE hero who is magically preordained to be the leader of any organization you choose to join. In Morrowind, there's some ambiguity as to whether you're actually the hero or just a pawn of a Daedric prince with a vendetta against three people..."
gaming,3c81bm,silentiumau,"I've actually heard that before. I tried my best to give Morrowind a real shot, but as I told Y_dilligaf, I just never feel compelled to continue playing or finish games of that genre. I always end up picking something else up."
gaming,3c81bm,mynumberistwentynine,"Just realized Vault 112 is great evidence as to why Vault 111 is a cryogenic chamber testing vault, since Vault 112 is basically a cryogenic chamber vault, except it has the VR Simulator.\n\nAnd since they're right next to eachother in number, they could be related, like Vault 68 and 69."
gaming,3c81bm,Codsworth,"Yeah, I think it seems pretty obvious that Fallout 4's protagonist has woken from cryo sleep. Clues are everywhere for it. \n\nI'm just worried that Fallout's focus on base building might obscure the environmental storytelling that made the prior installments fantastic."

gaming,3c81bm,Lethargicpete,"Yep, Killian Darkwater I think his name was. The devs managed to get a pretty nice cast for such a small project, along with Ron Pearlman, Keith David, and Tony Shalhoub (Monk)."
gaming,3c81bm,MadlibVillainy,"Ah, yeah. Killian Darkwater...\n\nHuh... so not only was Keith David in this and Mass Effect (I think his most recognizable game role for me), he was also in Planescape: Torment. Nice work there Keith, scored all my fav RPG's beside Baldurs Gate."
gaming,3c81bm,Lethargicpete,Wasn't he also in saints row 4?
gaming,3c81bm,1redwing1,Holy shit.
gaming,3c81bm,darkiron112,"I guess because Fallout fans know all about the Master. I love the history behind the dropping of the bombs and the evolution of the Super Mutants. Super creepy, but an amazing lore."
gaming,3c81bm,herrbz,I always took the extermination of vault 3 personally. Listening to those audio recordings was like nostalgia from vault 101. Felt genuinely guilty that I couldn't kill the raiders before the slaughtered the people there.
gaming,3c81bm,I-Survive,"Although depending on the game, it might have been a hundred years too late lol."
gaming,3c81bm,spiritbx,"Nope, it was within a human lifetime, since the leader of the raiders that killed the inhabitants remembers killing everyone inside, and he can't be over 40."
gaming,3c81bm,Squoghunter1492,"As someone who lives in Bakersfield California,  this place is already Necropolis."
gaming,3c81bm,PresidentMarston,"At least it's not Baker, California. That place is literally two gas stations, a Greek restaurant, and the place that sells alien jerky"

gaming,3c81bm,AxMeIfICare,Nice to find marble sodas there!
gaming,3c81bm,ArigatoPotato,Well there is also a creepy ass motel there with all tile floors and no phones in the room that feels like Norman Bates is gonna butcher you and just hose your blood down the drain.

gaming,3c81bm,tikifire86,"I liked sneaking around with a Stealth Boy and reverse pickpocketing grenades onto them. They'd spin around, shout ""Hahaha, GARY!!"" and then explode into various pieces. Slightly psychotic, but the timing was hilarious."

gaming,3c81bm,Nexxus213,"There really isn't much else to tell, but nothing is more hilarious than watching a teddy shooting through the air in slow motion, only to impact Gary and cause him to explode into a thousand bloody pieces."

gaming,3c81bm,Nexxus213,"The rock-it launcher, get blueprints from Moira (can't remember how) and shoot just about anything you want at people."

gaming,3c81bm,echoes122,"I know you can find them on a traveling merchant, but it does cost around a thousand caps."
gaming,3c81bm,DrDonut,"Vault 11 wasn't about personal sacrifice, it was about how brutal people could be for the ""greater good"". The vault itself it tells you this. By choosing not to sacrifice anymore people they ""pass the test"" and can leave. They're so horrified at how pointless their sacrifices have been the remaining 3 survivors kill each other."
gaming,3c81bm,OnARedditDiet,5 remain. In the audio log you hear 4 shots and a sigh so possibly one survivor.
gaming,3c81bm,Wampawacka,"Well, it's not 'possibly.' There are only four skeletons in the entrance chamber."
gaming,3c81bm,Badluck1313,And the door is open when you walk up suggesting that the 5th person got cold feet and left.
gaming,3c81bm,20thCenturyClocks,"The story is that one was hesitant to commit suicide, the four who made the pact killed him first, three killed themselves, and the last one got cold feet and left the vault."
gaming,3c81bm,beaverburgular,Doesn't sound like that in the Audio log. Voice one is hesitating. And Voice one is the last person alive. At least thats whats written in the wiki.
gaming,3c81bm,Mr_Bumper,"Well I think it was originally intended to be about personal sacrifice, but it swiftly descended into brutality, as evidenced when exploring the Vault in New Vegas. Many of the vaults are creepy, but that was the one that really screwed with my brain."
gaming,3c81bm,herrbz,"Fallout 1 was amazing. Trying to get in Fallout 2, Fallout 3 and New Vegas are also cool."
gaming,3c81bm,Tuaam,"Enjoy fallout 2. It's my favorite game of all time and considered by many to be the crown jewel of the series.  Play it however you want. Never entering combat is equally as viable a strat as killing everyone unlucky enough to meet you. Having 1 intelligence gives completely different conversations as a normal level of int.  The story isn't black and white, do what your character would do to survive and thrive in the wasteland."
gaming,3c81bm,montysaurus,My first time through I joined the slavers and would capture and sell slaves. It was pretty cool.
gaming,3c81bm,MopsyWT,The vault with plant human hybrids seriously freaked me out and made me jump. The metro in FO3 had the same effect...the fucking ghoul noises man. I both love and hate these parts of fall out. Also the part in then plant vault where you had to cause an explosion was horse shit.
gaming,3c81bm,OnlyMath,The worst was when they snuck up behind you and you get whacked out of nowhere.
gaming,3c81bm,JMCrown,Yes! Or when you went into vats and they were mid leap into your face. I avoided the damn metro so much lol
gaming,3c81bm,OnlyMath,"I had no idea the Fallout universe was this deep and didn't know you could discover other vaults. I'm currently playing New Vegas but I'm still only a few hours in, now I think I'm gonna go vault hunting. Are they kinda like dungeons in Skyrim or something with their own quests?"
gaming,3c81bm,HeadbangingLegend,"Most usually have their own ""quest"" /story that you discover as you go. They are really fantastic, some pre-given quests tell you to go to a certain vault. Find all of them and enjoy"
gaming,3c81bm,d0gfish,"The vaults don't level with you as much as other areas in New Vegas. Some can be easy for a lower level person to explore, but others can be a right pain if your not well supplied going in. They usually contain some special weapons though that are great if you can get to them early."
gaming,3c81bm,Teshub1,"Some of the vaults are connected to quests. Some vaults only have quests that get activated once you explore the vault.\n\nAlso in New Vegas some easy to find vaults are 3, 11, 19 and 34."
gaming,3c81bm,Dorantee,"Pretty much every vault has its own quest, some of them have collectables/rare items"
gaming,3c81bm,buttstuff2015,"I know you've got a lot of replies to this, but I don't think any adequately addressed your question about how they compare to dungeons in Skyrim. There are a few dungeons in Skyrim that have a lot of lore attached to them, but there are, I think, equally as many that do not and I have always felt like dungeons in Skyrim were basically a dime a dozen and the only real variation is whether or not they were Nord or Dwemer, etc (with exceptions like, say, Blackreach). Fallout vaults are comparatively rare, and the genius of them is that almost all of them have some sort of interesting story, as they all seem to have been part of this grand, fucked up human experiment. Each one is in its own way a little perverse experiment and most of them have a rich story to tell you as you discover what the vault's intended experiment was and what the outcome became.\n\nSo there are fewer of them compared to dungeons in Skyrim, but there is, I think, an overall richer experience to them."
gaming,3c81bm,Supervisor194,"Without going into heavy spoilers, each Vault that you can actually go into has multiple quests associated with it. Some of them are ""See this person"" or ""Do X"" and some are going to involve having to go through the entire thing at length."

gaming,3c81bm,Cave_Johnson_2016,"How does Fallout vault lore work? I've never played a Fallout game, and every time I hear stories about the different vaults I get intrigued.\n\nDo survivors sign up for a place in the vault, but then the vault's fate is undisclosed to them? This intrigues me most in Vault 12; Did the survivors know they would be exposed to radiation?"
gaming,3c81bm,Swerdman55,"The selection process usually asked affluent members of society, or like in the Mormon vault, asked those that fit the demographics for the experiment. The sad thing is a lot of people fought for a chance to get into a Vault. That's why you can sometimes see rejection letters from Vault-Tec or the skeletons of people trying to (impossibly) claw their way past the door.\n\nThe vaults' fates were never disclosed to the general population. Before the Great War, the vaults were just advertised as state-of-the-art facilities to comfortably live out the apocalypse in. If I remember right, sometimes the Overseer knew, but it differs on what experiment was taking place in the Vault."

gaming,3c81bm,DrDoWnVoTePhD,"I enjoyed fallout New Vegas the most. 3 was good, but I didn't find the back stories as good or detailed, and just generally didn't get into it as much. However, fallout NV was my 2nd favourite game ever, so 3 had a big successor to beat."

There's also the less stellar Tactics, and the Baldur's Gate-ish Brotherhood of Steel.\n\nIf you have any interest I highly recommend 1 and 2, and if you really get into the series Tactics is fun. The running joke with the Brotherhood of Steel one is that it doesn't exist and shouldn't be talked about. I don't think it's as bad as all that, it's just not the most Fallout-y game, but it's actually fun."

Also Vault 13 was the control vault (at least that's what the enclave president tells you in Fallout 2), they weren't suppose to ""open"" at any specific time, nor was the water chip suppose to break. They were actually suppose to receive a shipment of water chips, except Vault 8 got the water chips (which they didn't need). The occupants of vault 13 were captured by the enclave for testing a deadly FEV strain. After they were kidnapped, intelligent Deathclaws occupied the vault. \n\nAlso vault 112 virtual reality simulation wasn't programmed to only play in Tranquility lane, the overseer (If you could call him that) designed and changed the simulations at will."
gaming,3c81bm,techknowAthena,I want more about the puppet guy!
gaming,3c81bm,DalvBot12,"He went crazy and talked to the puppets as if they were real people, but he always did the speaking for them. Then one day he heard one speak, and he befriended it. Eventually that ""talking"" puppet ""killed"" another puppet, and to help the puppet, the man opened the vault, which was unlocked the entire time, and left with the ""talking"" puppet. There were stories of the crazy puppet man, while exploring the wasteland, a group of raiders captured him, he warned the raiders that the puppet is crazy and has killed before. After that, we see a scared raider talking to his leader, saying that he thinks they're being hunted by the puppet man, the sound of klanging can be heard, and the raider realizes the puppet man is here. We then see the puppet man with the puppet on his hand, he's covered in blood, and is surrounded by the corpses of the raiders.  In Fallout 3 or Fallout New Vegas, you can find the suit from his vault (77), and an audio tape in Paradise Falls. The suit gives \n+5 for melee and unarmed combat, while the audio tape has someone talking about the suit. He's is worried about keeping it, and wants to get rid of it because, ""What if the puppet man comes back for it?"" Even though it's unlikely that he's still alive, and it's become an urnan legend, people are still worried about him.\n\nEdit: Fixed and added some stuff. Also check out Thenthapple's video on it, it's where I got my info."
gaming,3c81bm,jumpingsuits,"Fallout 3 is when you find his Vault suit with the 77 on back and the audio file is the guys talking about getting ride of the suit incase the owner decides to come back for it, they were scared shitless in the audio i remember finding this and wondering what happened in the vault.."

gaming,3c81bm,spaghettiman9-11,"Probably going to get buried but here's the story of vault 34..(started playing NV and spent way to long there)\nVault 34 was purposely overstocked with both weapons and people. Originally the vault was at capacity but as the population grew to unsustainable levels, the population grew anxious. Sensing this, the overseer locked away the armory and as a result the population revolted, breaking in to the armory, with half of the population leaving to go and form the boomers at Nellis Air Force base. The remaining population stayed and revolted again in the future, where this time they managed to severely damage their reactor, producing deadly radiation. As engineers such as Chris (who left because he was balding and going nuts, later joined the ghouls at the repconn rocket factory) tried to work on the reactor, they started becoming feral ghouls and attacked the vault population. By the time you arrive, every inhabitant of the vault is now ghoulified, including the overseer and his security officers. (Except at the end of the quest somehow there are normal people alive? That ask you through a terminal to give them access to the reactor? So they can escape? I just let them all die for the NCR so idk what that was about)"

gaming,3c87ye,Lacasax,Keep speaking truth to power. I'd be mortified if someone actually thought it appropriate to celebrate their wedding with a cake shaped like a shield from a video game. Unfortunately crass is commonplace now it seems.
gaming,3c87ye,Spacewhip,"You remind me of my friend's mom. (Or any le wrong generation teen, but they'll grow out of it.) She's a lovely elderly lady but I guess comes from some kind of wealthy family and she tends to ask who ""your people are"" whenever she meets someone. Otherwise she's very sharp, educated, and a lot of fun, but she doesn't understand that the mark of high class isn't about putting on a show for others anymore. All the outward trappings were just to separate yourself from the 'lower' classes and pretend like you're somehow inherently better because you've learned to navigate complex social structures. \n\nNow, having class means being a good person: Being gracious, kind and accepting. And it's about time, too!\n\nThere's a kind of lovely poetry in the fact that this social shift means that your friends aren't going to ostracize you, even when you're showing your lack of class by fretting over the show someone else should be putting on for your benefit. Most people will just shrug, say to themselves ""Well, s/he doesn't know any better, and it's not my business to judge him/her"" and go about their day. Which is much kinder to you than you are being to others. (And definitely reinforces my thoughts that old notions of class hung on WAY too long.)\n\nP.S. I'm not personally a big fan of theme weddings myself. But I'll still go and not be a jerk about it, because the person getting married isn't doing it for me. Which is another great thing. Weddings used to be so your parents could show off how fantastically socially graceful they were. Now they're about two people wanting to share the celebration of their love with you. Don't be gauche."

In my opinion I believe that this cake would be awesome, depending on the theme that is. I'm not saying that other people's opinions are wrong, I'm just saying that because its a cartoonish cake at an ""adult"" event doesn't make it bad.

gaming,3c7okv,SoundOfDrums,"Did they make Morrowind, Oblivion, FO3, and Skyrim? :)"
gaming,3c7okv,teamkiller91,NV uses the same engine that Bethesda created.. so your point is moot
gaming,3c7okv,NigelxD,Wasn't that technically Obsidian that did that one though (using Bethesda's engine)? Maybe the problem was the engine at the time which means it could be fixed.

gaming,3c7okv,Leganost,"You try and make a decent-looking, realistic jump animation."
gaming,3c7okv,DashingQuill23,They're a huge fucking game company with tons of developers and workers with technical backgrounds. What kind of comparison is that.
gaming,3c7okv,throwawayforshortsto,"Fine, let me rephrase that; Give me one example of a good looking jump animation that isn't completely bullshit. A realistic, clean looking jump animation. I can only think of one that gets the realistic and fluent down and it's Johnny Klebitz from The Lost and Damned, and that was pussified.\n\nAnd besides, you gives a shit? Most of the time you're encouraged to play in first person anyway, and the games are good, even if they are buggy. They also have a massive scope and 9 times out of 10 they get shoved out the door prematurely (lookin' at you, Zenimax) so they have to cut corners. All in all, jump animation is pretty close to the bottom of the list of priorities."
gaming,3c7okv,DashingQuill23,I never said I gave a shit or that there were great jump animations in games. I just said that was a stupid comparison. Which it was.
gaming,3c7okv,throwawayforshortsto,True. I don't really know why I decided to be a dick about such a trivial topic.
gaming,3c7okv,DashingQuill23,No one said they were bad. Fallout 4 is ridiculously highly anticipated so obviously Bethesda is doing something right. We're just all in agreement that that something is NOT animations
gaming,3c7okv,indigo121,But it looks like combat won't be trash this time around.
gaming,3c7okv,Fliff42,"Yeah... I guess I'm just used to having to defend Bethesda, as I have a lot of friends that like to give it shit."
gaming,3c7okv,DashingQuill23,"The Prince of Persia series would like a word.\n\nBloodborne also had some nicely refined jump animations.\n\nWitcher 3 has fantastic animation all around including jumping vaulting rolling even facial expressions.\n\nIt is done well, has been done well, and can continue to be done well. Bethesda has honestly had trouble with animations in general and there really isn't any excuse to it other than possibly engine limitations. At least the games are good enough to ignore little details."
gaming,3c7okv,nerogenesis,"Prince of Persia is debately realistic, but yeah I concede your point. Especially about The Witcher 3.

gaming,3c7okv,buddy-bun-dem,Monolith Soft feels their pain
gaming,3c7okv,Fliff42,"That was a very special case. I doubt there'll be many mutes in Fallout 4. It's also from the first DLC, which I'm sure they had a deadline to release."
gaming,3c7okv,Bookworm12k,Part of me quite enjoys that description.
gaming,3c7okv,rememberphaedo,"Its like I'm playing a game of Exodus.\n\nWhich would be weird, seeing as I'm GM"
gaming,3c7okv,DashingQuill23,"Christine isn't only mute, she's mentally destroyed by year of torture like.\nFor me, this narrative approach is the better way to describe what she really is. I mean, yes she wince, but it's almost not perceptible, so much imperceptible that you should say it in your own mind for to be sure that it's what she just have done."
gaming,3c7okv,mainoumi,"I don't have an issue with some subtle things being narrated, but they could also be shown. I feel there wasn't enough time for all the subtle animations and the engine had a hard time handling them. Once the decision to use text (because animation alone did not convey it) was done, it was easy (but wrong imho) to decide you didn't even need to to the animation."
gaming,3c7okv,lookmeat,"I think it would be cool to have unique animations as well as narrative, so you can perceive it as well as feel more empathy for her by actually seeing her attempt to form words or communicate with you, only to give up in frustration. And if you miss the meaning of her momements, you have a narrative to back you up. \n\nTL;DR: Why not both?"
gaming,3c7okv,Burdboy96,"It could have been cool, yes, but do you really think that something almost imperceptible can be done here ? I mean, in real size, it's already hard to see it, so how do you made it when the head is something like 50 pixels wide ?\nLook at the screen shoot, do you really think that you'll be able to see what in real size would have been an almost imperceptible wince ? In games like in movies, every little things must be overplayed for to be visibles. And in games like in movies, it's a very difficult things to do.  Plus, it all depend of the screen resolution. Someone playing on a wide TV screen will see as obvious a thing that someone playing on a 1280x1024 computer screen would have trouble see. So, in order to keep constancy between all the possible screen resolution and screen size, the imperceptible moves must be made perceptibles and will break the meaning."
gaming,3c7okv,mainoumi,"It would be very hard to interpret what she meant just through the actions though, the description sets a clear tone which was useful for interacting with her."
gaming,3c7okv,isasquareashape,"I think that's exactly what he's saying. He says he wished that the engine was capable of portraying the described action.\nEdit: He's on the same page, guys. Good god."
gaming,3c7okv,tomba444,and he is saying that it would be harder for the player to interpret what she meant purely based on her actions.
gaming,3c7okv,DieDungeon,"If her actions were a perfect representation of the ""dialog"" it could absolutely be understood. The message is ""ow, i'm confused and everything hurts"", that's easy to mime, even easier to exaggerate. She's not giving you a password or directions to the restroom."
gaming,3c7okv,LatinGeek,"Everything can be explained in words in detail. That's not the point of a 3D, voice acted game like Fallout. How would you feel if when you blew up Megaton a text bubble just popped up vividly describing the scene?"
gaming,3c7okv,Fliff42,well an explosion is much easier to visualise and show than subtle facial details.
gaming,3c7okv,DieDungeon,"The problem lies in that some players may be less likely to pick up on social cues, so even if they animated it better, there would be a much larger room for error."
gaming,3c7okv,anon_writ,I would say players are more likely to skip a written description than not watch a scripted character action.
gaming,3c7okv,Fliff42,"While that may be true, there are some mental disabilities, for example, that hinder perception of social cues. Assuming every player will understand ends up alienating a not so small audience"
gaming,3c7okv,anon_writ,"That may be true, but then you are saying any emotional actions put into the game could ultimately end up alienating that audience. Not to mention many games now rely on facial expressions to convey feeling, so those also alienate that audience. Everyone shouldn't have to lose something because theres a particular audience who feels alienated by it, and in this case perhaps give the option of text descriptions of facial expressions.\n\nI mean by your logic adding colors could alienate the color blind, so dont have color is the solution. Rather have options to accommodate different players."
gaming,3c7okv,Fliff42,"Agreed, I just don't think he/she should have been downvoted so hard haha."
gaming,3c7okv,tomba444,Which is ridiculous because it is... It'd just be a lot of work.
gaming,3c7okv,LukaCola,but this shows the lack of hability of this engine to have specific and unique animations.\n\n\nYou literally are just making shit up.
gaming,3c7okv,BaconInMyPants,Modders had to make programs for getting advanced animations and advanced scripts in Skyrim so it doesn't seem too far fetched.
gaming,3c7okv,Aleitheo,"I haven't looked at the toolkit for Skyrim, but I imagine it's pretty similar to Fallout's. The modding tools for NV have a drop down menu where you can select an animation to play during lines of dialogue. You can play any animation for that character you want during any line of dialogue. You could go through every line of dialogue in the game and set it to play whatever animation you want. OP is talking out of his ass. The NV engine is limited for sure but that isn't one of the limitations."
gaming,3c7okv,BaconInMyPants,"The Creation Kit (Skyrim) is basically an advanced version of the GECK (Fallout 3/NV) and it was Skyrim that needs the Skyrim Script Extender (As far back as Morrowind the TES/Fallout games had a script extender) for major mods and many mods that rely on special animations require FNIS to do so.\n\nThese mods are required to play ""any"" animation you want. Without them you are limited to what animations you can play.\n\nIf I need FNIS for a fishing mod in Skyrim just so it looks like I am holding the rod and fishing with it then it's not too outrageous to expect that New Vegas needs something similar to have facial animations detailed enough to convey what the text box says. Especially with the low amount of facial bones to manipulate."
gaming,3c7okv,Aleitheo,"You need to understand that when it comes to modders vs developers working on the game - developers win. Because they have the source code of the engine, better tools, better resources, better assets, and an entire team of other game developers to help them. \n\nIf Bethesda really wanted to have everything OP was talking about, they could easily implement it. It's just their focus, at least in previous games, was not in animation.\n\nModders had to do all that backward designing while jumping through loopholes to get what they wanted out of the engine, because they don't have the source code. They can't just go in and rewrite how certain things work in the game."
gaming,3c7okv,Slemo,Okay. I don't give a shit how much you've played the game or if you think the animations are sub-par. That doesn't make your statement about it being an engine limitation any more right. Bethesda games always focus on large worlds and gameplay over pretty graphics and animation. Just because they didn't include amazing animations doesn't mean the software is incapable of doing it.
gaming,3c7okv,BaconInMyPants,"""Gameplay""\n\nlol yes, click on things all day ooooor if you want you can pause the game and kill everything so you don't have to deal with our combat."
gaming,3c7okv,Fliff42,"If they did, why didn't they implement it already?\n\n\nBecause it's obviously not their priority you dense mother fucker. \n\nJust because a game doesn't animate literally everything doesn't mean it can't. \n\nHow fucking hard is that to understand. \n\nWe all know Bethesda titles have poor animation. Again, that was never a priority. They make, first and foremost, open world RPGs and the mechanics to realize that are generally prioritized."
gaming,3c7okv,LukaCola,"Guys.... are you all saying, if you had a choice to have much more realistic and expressive facial animations, as opposed to stiff, robotic ones, you would choose the latter? Forget for this extremely specific scenario, I'm talking EVERY character, not just for this one particular moment. \n\nFacial animations are the next step and need to become a standard because games that do it right (naughty dog games) Half life, RAGE, etc. etc. really take you further to immerse yourself into what you're playing. \n\nYou guys are being a bit over sensitive and reactive to what I thought would be a completely unanimously accepted stance. Which is gee, wouldn't it be cool if facial animations were less stiff and robotic, and were able to express a more diverse set of emotional range? I think you guys took this a bit too much as a critique of a thing you love and kind of missed the point here."
gaming,3c7okv,cmdsheperd,"If she didn't blink and just stared at you with no context behind it, people would assume it's a glitch and bitch about it. The description is necessary"
gaming,3c7okv,SaneAnubis,"What...? \n\nJesus Christ, the engine wasn't a limitation. How do you think they made any animations in the first place?\n\nThe issue is that separately animating everything takes way too much time and effort for a single character in one DLC. \n\nIt makes no sense to do so.\n\nPeople put way too much importance behind a game's engine."
gaming,3c7okv,LukaCola,So what games can achieve this level of detail now?
gaming,3c7okv,joedl1,It wasn't perfect but I thought the Witcher 3 did a pretty good job on their facial expressions.
gaming,3c7okv,illy-chan,"L.A. Noire, I guess. It's pretty unique, though."
gaming,3c7okv,DRACULA_WOLFMAN,Hell WindWaker delivered more emotion in facial expressions back in 2000 whatever year.
gaming,3c7okv,Fliff42,It's less about technology capabilities and more about our perception abilities. Half the time we can't even understand what emotions human actors are trying to portray. This narrative device makes for a better experience if the plot is complex and compelling.
gaming,3c7okv,HittySkibbles,"The perfect example of ""downvoted because of hivemind""."
gaming,3c7okv,poduszkowiec,Absolutely truth.
gaming,3c7okv,Fliff42,"Seriously, people have such a hard on for Fallout 3 that if you point out the major flaws it has they get pissy. Fallout and Elder Scrolls are plagued with janky animations, downright bad combat and AI, emotionless NPCs, and a boatload of bugs and glitches. Despite all this, I actually really like Fallout 3 and Skyrim, but these games are light years away from perfect or being ""the best games of all time"" and people jump to defend them as such all the time.\n\nEdit: See?"
gaming,3c7okv,NinjaBullets,That looks like it'd be pretty difficult to animate tho
gaming,3c7okv,Gazoir,This. It'd take a decent animator a couple of weeks of solid work to do justice to the action described here. I think the developers made the right call by spending that resource elsewhere.
gaming,3c7okv,CylentShadow,I doubt that you can achieve that description with just an animation. I think it would have to be a pre-rendered cut scene that changed angles and everything.
gaming,3c7okv,KaotixStorm,They should have gave away pepper spray with the game to simulate what she was going through.
gaming,3c7okv,Scrubilicious,"Why so much time? How do other developers do to animate stuff?\nCheck this footage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P18lYfdPicY\nHer animations are priceless, and they persist during all the game. \n\nHow much time can that take? Aren't there some tracking devices that can record animations?"
gaming,3c7okv,Hayden11121,Well Bethesda doesn't use motion capture so it's just the animators (or whomever) who make characters faces and movements. That's why just walking and jumping looks poop in fallout.
gaming,3c7okv,mrNONDESCRIPT,"Why so much time? Because animation isn't a hobby, it's a full time job. Even if ""tracking suits"" it has to be refined."
gaming,3c7okv,LatinGeek,"And 99% of people wouldn't notice without a cue like,\n\n[Christine uses body language that is critical to her story arc so pay attention you rancid brahmin]"
gaming,3c7okv,Valexexe,"what is: motion capture. The eyelids could be tricky to sync, but c'mon."
gaming,3c7okv,Sybre,Tbh most would probably miss the animation.
gaming,3c7okv,Fliff42,"Exactly. Especially how clunky people tend to move in fallout, not to mention how little face expression is actually in the game."
gaming,3c7okv,Ethann115,The problems you just described are the issues OP wants to see fixed in FO 4
gaming,3c7okv,DJG0,"I live these descriptions, reminds me of older RPGs and also tabletop RPGs."
gaming,3c7okv,Ethann115,"I know what you mean, it kinda felt like how the first two fallouts described the world around you and I actually like it."
gaming,3c7okv,cob59,"Yea, I love where Bethesda took the Fallout series but it's always nice to have this type of homage to the old titles."
gaming,3c7okv,Ethann115,"OP probably does not realize those descriptions are the last remnants of the classic-RPG genre Fallout once belonged to (until F3), before it turned into a soulless skyrim-with-guns.\nNowadays, dialog lines & options are limited because voice acting is expensive. And so are character animations."
gaming,3c7okv,Fliff42,I really enjoy the recent Bethesda RPGs but I do get annoyed by the recycled voice actors in Skyrim.
gaming,3c7okv,Ethann115,"They're fun, but it's inconsistent in the game. Sometimes they do show actions, sometimes they describe them. It's just weird IMO, they should've just stuck with one method."
gaming,3c7okv,Brendan_McCoy,"Very true, although I wouldn't like these descriptions to be a part of every interaction I have, kinda ruins the atmosphere of it's not important."
gaming,3c7okv,DowncastAcorn,"Honestly, I don't mind this. It's an RPG and I don't mind rpg elements"
gaming,3c7okv,BW_Bird,"I liked Christine as a character, I felt that her ending didn't do her justice after everything she'd been through, She deserved better than to stay in a poisonous ghost city. I still have no idea why she stayed either, she had no prior motivation to do so, it just seemed like lazy writing to put her on a bus."
gaming,3c7okv,D9sinc,"Dead Money was all about letting go of what held you down. Dean Domino needed to let go his greed for Sinclair's fortune, God/Dog needs to let go their desire to dominate the other and Elijah needed to let go his obsession with pre-war technology. \n\nChristine never let go of her desire to hunt down Elijah to get her revenge. This revenge destroyed her, physically and mentally. After her time in the Circle of Steel and the torment she was subjected, She is not the same women who loved Veronica.\n\nIn the end, she received her revenge but now has nothing left but to act as warden over the Sierra Madre to help wayward travelers."
gaming,3c7okv,Griever_PL,"I liked that part where you realized she was in love with Veronica and Veronica was in love with her, but it also made me sad knowing Veronica would never see Christine again."
gaming,3c7okv,Phugu,"I honestly would not mind such a Torment-like description for ALL characters. If they can animate it - sure, but I love this stuff!"
gaming,3c7okv,CyberP1,"I think it adds flavour, keeps old RPG ascpects in the game. Sometimes reading something is way more intense than seeing sth. Maybe you overlook it or interpret it differently than they wanted.  \n\nBut if there is a text, that states that ""the act of blinking causes her pain"" than there is no question."
gaming,3c7okv,Palpadean,Glad to see some sane comments in here. Unusual for r/gaming.
gaming,3c7okv,Xendrid,"I'm not saying it wouldn't improve quality of life in game, of course it would, but I always felt the lack of animations made me feel more attached to Christine than any of the other NPCs in Sierra Madre. My own imagination added little stuff to her especially with this scene and her wincing at blinking. I could easily envision a tear. My heart felt heavy for her when she tries to talk to you about her old girlfriend and you piecing it together based on how she behaves and body language. I don't know, I feel like a lamer getting invested in stuff like that but I appreciated the writing and I think in this instance I prefer my own thoughts and imagery to in game animations.\n\nRamble much huh? :p"
gaming,3c7okv,boose22,"I like this. It's like old school RPG, and it's what your character is just noticing through perception. In fact, I really hope they add a lot of this for people who play perceptive characters so those people get more information and maybe some clue as to how to talk to someone."
gaming,3c7okv,Remain_InSaiyan,I like the narration portions. Poorly done animations take away from the experience.
gaming,3c7okv,ElagabalusRex,"If you pay attention during some of the dialogue during the Fallout 4 gameplay, you can see quite a bit more expression on the faces of the person talking. So I imagine they've worked on it."
gaming,3c7okv,thatonedudeguyman,"Mass Effect did this a bit, as well."
gaming,3c7okv,iSeven,What is she from exactly? Which DLC?
gaming,3c7okv,thatonedudeguyman,Dead Money.
gaming,3c7okv,Nyerf,Thanks hommie
gaming,3c7okv,hwarming,Dead Money I believe. She's in the Sierra Madre.
gaming,3c7okv,Saiaxs,So is Christine supposed to be Veronica's girlfriend? They kinda hint at it but never confirm it as far as I know
gaming,3c7okv,MurdochAV,yes. ex-girlfriend. You can talk to them both about the other.
gaming,3c7okv,Botchness,I thought maybe the BoS was just chock full of lesbian scribes and it just made Elijah mad as all heck
gaming,3c7okv,Thatomeglekid,It was a part of an expansion mission not something they built into the original product so i doubt they really were going to invest the time and money for a single character.
gaming,3c7okv,MusiCraz,I wish she was able to be your companion afterwards
gaming,3c7okv,CanadianSnow,I hated that dlc with a burning passion. Stupid collar.
gaming,3c7okv,UlfrTheBlind,I totally prefer the text version. It attracts the reader in me.
gaming,3c7okv,Globscho,I actually like the whole narration thing.
gaming,3c7okv,aeroz36,"I might be oldshool but I really like this flavortext thingys.\n\nYou can express so much more with them, and they don't age one of the resones you can still play planescape Torment and have a great time"
gaming,3c7okv,rleclair90,"From the scale of the game, I wouldn't be surprised if it is still the same, to little time for such a massive undertaking"
gaming,3c7okv,cpnHindsight,"To be fair, most of that character's lines are descriptions of her actions because she's a mute; describing what she's doing is the only way the game can reliably communicate the information she's trying to convey."
gaming,3c7okv,Aldheim,Allan please add expensive motion capture to every NPC.
gaming,3c7okv,RuinerGaming,"So this specific example would be time consuming expensive, and ultimately a lot of impact would be lost because it's so damn subtle that half of the players aren't going to notice.\n\nBut it seems like conversations are going to be a lot more immersive in Fallout 4 than in previous Bethesda games - what's been seen so far looks like a strong step towards Mass Effect ish pseudo cutscenes for conversations."
gaming,3c7okv,RetroPK,"Animations have never been their strong side, always been a bit stiff and lacking imo. However, it looks like it's better in Fallout 4(Or at least a bit smoother)"
gaming,3c7okv,HamiltonIsGreat,If they did that you would just think the game is just fucking up
gaming,3c7okv,skullsgate,i thought it was done on purpose? To breach the gap between animation and imagination
gaming,3c7okv,SystemThreat,"I really don't know how Bethesda gets away with anything. It's like all their games have a drug in them that makes Gamers overly accepting of: bugs, crashes, shitty animations etc. Skyrim is probably one of the buggiest games I have ever played (load times for consoles, alt+tabbing on PC) and yet it is one of my favourite games of all time."
gaming,3c7okv,SonicBoom651,The fact that everyone you came across in FO 3 were basically cardboard cutouts was easily my least favorite thing about it. Here's hoping they hired an animator this time around.
gaming,3c7okv,chazpedersen,"I just hope they get rid of how NPCs would stare deeply into your soul like they did in FO3/NV (And Oblivion too, on second thought)."
gaming,3c7okv,SoundOfDrums,Uhhhhh no thank you
gaming,3c7okv,Clockshade,"Two different companies.  Bethesda never ""emoted"" anything in their content."
gaming,3c7okv,Thebacklash,"They can't. The way dialogue is going to work is that you can walk away, or turn around while the npc's are in mid speech. Your dialogue options come onto the screen only while you are looking at any individual. In essence dialogue will work like activating an object. This is all paraphrasing what Tod Howard said in an interview."

The one I always remember is when cadet tells luke he is his father by pulling out a picture of anakin and padme while she is pregnant and point back and forth making noises that just sound like hurrurrurrur
gaming,3c8ai7,LewisKane,They still use a lot of sight gags.
gaming,3c8ai7,radewagon,They still do... Quite a bit actually
gaming,3c8ai7,LtDanUSAFX3,"I've only watched my wife and son play the LEGO Batman series (they are currently working through 3).  But from what I saw and they said, in the first one, which didn't have any voice acting, it was hard to understand the plot some times.\n\nI actually thought a bit similar when I was playing through LEGO Indiana Jones, again which lacked voice acting.\n\nBut the games still have humor!  Take LoTR, they use audio clips from the actual movie.. but they still has the original slap stick type humor.\n\nActually, in saying that, thinking more: some of the humor might have been lost or not able to be done in the games if there were voices (thinking LEGO Indy.. he goes through a bag and finds C3P0's head in it), but they have just adapted the humor.\n\nYes we love our LEGO games at home.  Over the weekend we picked up Jurassic Park & The Hobbit ones to play."
gaming,3c8ai7,thisismywww,"Oh hmm. I think it may kinda depend on the game, at least for me.\n\nI have played Lego Batman 1 and a little bit of 2. I thought the no voice acting in 1 was perfect and the humor was more in the non-dialogue sounds they made.  But I can definitely see your point on the plot now that I think about.  When starting 2, it threw me off a little with the voice acting cause I enjoyed how it was done in 1. \n\nBut LOTR, I loved the voice acting they used from the movies. Was great. But that's even different than the dialogue in newer games. \n\nSo yeah I think it'd depend on the game."
gaming,3c8ai7,alpacafarts,"Dialogue in 2 also allowed them to make a movie from the cut scenes ;)  3 might have done the same, not too sure on that one.\n\nThe LEGO Movie game again used scenes from the movie, so you can almost watch the movie (or at least it will spoil the movie) if you play it first.\n\nLoTR surprised me when they used clips from the actual movie!"
gaming,3c8ai7,thisismywww,"Love playing the Lego games with my girlfriend on my PC. These games always feel very complete and fun. The Marvel one really took me by surprise when I found out you could run around New York with virtually any Marvel character that I care about. The voices do not break the game but I agree it could go without them as well. I still believe Lego Star Wars was one of the best Star Wars games made for the franchise itself.\n\nLove any kind of Lego game, recently I've been playing Lego Worlds on early access and it is a lot of fun. I enjoy the fact that these games are always so packed with features and characters.\n\nSadly with this new Lego Dimensions crap that is coming out I have lost respect for the company a bit. Having to buy all of these toys in order to play the game to its fullest extent is just ridiculous. The game caught my attention when they revealed a level of it that featured world of Portal, with Gandalf and even Homer Simpson involved. When I first watched that video I was about to scream with excitement, until I figured out that you have to spend extra money to acquire these characters to be played in game. Total bullshit."
gaming,3c8ai7,onqqq2,It's the same thing as Disney Infinity and Skylanders. Sure it sucks to buy characters but that's the market strategy right now.
gaming,3c8ai7,DragonsBlade72,"On LEGO Star Wars, if you go into the options menu and turn the music volume right down, the musicians in the cantina will be stood next to their instruments, arms outstretched, looking pretty pissed off."

gaming,3c8ai7,qwerty-snowman,Pictured: Silent humor.
gaming,3c8ai7,Bwgmon,"I'll be honest, I really didn't like the Lego Jurrasic World game specifically because it had voice acting.  My best friend and I 100% Lego Indiana Jones a about 5 years ago.  We had such good memories of that and the new game was such a let down.  We decided it was all because they took lines directly from the movie, and some just felt really out of place."
gaming,3c8ai7,Thomaseb1,"I'm indifferent I love the Lego games in general when the added voice acting I was like ""Oh no way!"""
gaming,3c8ai7,IthinkitsaDanny,I actually mentioned this to someone the other day! I liked the silent humor and I feel like the fact that all the characters talk now kind of ruin it for me. Idk why but it just was better silent.
gaming,3c8ai7,Saucymeatballs,I feel the silent humor works best with movie adaptations because with the voices from the movie there's not much you can do it make it humorous. When it's an original work like LEGO City Undercover they can mix the voice humor with the silent humor and it works very well.\n\nBut for the most part I agree.
gaming,3c8ai7,0NinjaPirate,I do ;( RIP silent humour.

I spent hours trying to get enough money to get all the secrets, and then playing the secret mission which is the first part of the original trilogy.\nI cant belive this game is over 10 years old now!"
gaming,3c8ai7,tomhas10,yeah that is what is keeping me from buying the new ones. They need a setting for either mode silent grunts or voiceover.
gaming,3c8ai7,astronaut24,The miming is what made them appealing to all ages. Now they're just kids games.
gaming,3c8ai7,Hammertoss,"yes, I loved them a lot more when they had no dialogue! I loved all the Star Wars ones and when I saw the LOTR one that came out, I needed it! but with how expansive it was and with the dialogue, it really didnt feel like a Lego game to me. Still haven't beat it :/"
gaming,3c8ai7,SweatyPoopBaby,I miss the slapstick and hidden areas in the levels.
gaming,3c8ai7,darkjungle,I loved the silent Lego characters it was one of the main reasons why I haven't played any of the new ones the old lego games were just so well made and much funnier from what i've seen.

gaming,3c8tbd,DrDraek,I've never sniped anyone1 in Battlefield.\n\n1 on the enemy team
gaming,3c8tbd,britchesss,I don't get it.
gaming,3c8tbd,AeroRandy,I guess it's supposed to be a footnote
gaming,3c8tbd,brokentowel,I don't get it.\n\n\nThey sniped their own team members.
gaming,3c8tbd,1lIlI1lIIlIl1I,"Is that actually possible, I mean in real life?\n\nThe A10 is armoured, doesn't that extend to bulletproofing the canopy?"
gaming,3c8tbd,Heinemenusch,"I don't know much about how well the canopy could stop a large caliber round like that (I assume that's the .50 sniper rifle). The main reason this would be almost impossible in real life is that the speed of the jet is wayyyyy too low, that looks like stall speed to me. Trying to really figure out how much to lead a jet (even a relatively slow one) and then getting the aim perfect would be extremely hard."
gaming,3c8tbd,ForwardBias,".50 would probably still ricochet off the sloped canopy if I recall correctly the A-10 has pretty thick glass. As for the stall speed, they stall at around 230kph, which is definitely faster than the one in the game was going."
gaming,3c8tbd,Remigus,"Most aircraft built these days are not used for air-to-air engagements and only used to deliver ordinance to a ground target. \n\nThe A-10, however, engages heavy artillery, tanks, and AA positions directly with its 30mm cannon and will fly much lower than other planes delivering their respective ordinance. \n\nTherefore, due to the threat of heavy ground fire during runs, the ""Warthog"" is equipped with a ""bathtub"" titanium armor. \n\nThe single-seat cockpit is protected by all-round armour, with a titanium 'bathtub' structure to protect the pilot that is up to 3.8cm thick. The cockpit has a large bulletproof bubble canopy, which gives good all-round vision.\n\nThis armor can generally withstand larger rounds of ammunition that are direct hits. The canopy is a reinforced (either polycarbonate or laminated - can't find which...may be a secret) glass which would deflect most bullets due to the curvature of the reinforced canopy. \n\nA .50 or higher may fragment or penetrate the canopy if hit directly or multiple times after the glass has been weakened. \n\nThe chances of this ever happening is obviously extremely rare."
gaming,3c8tbd,THE_SOUR_KROUT,"Nope, bullet wouldn't even hit the A-10 to begin with. And the sniper would get BRRRRT to pieces."

gaming,3c8tbd,Ziaeon,"Kind of interesting, but one would hear the shells hitting the target before they would hear them being fired. It's weird until you realize that the ammo if going faster than the speed of sound."
gaming,3c8tbd,Helium_3,"Indeed, this video shows that: you hear the BRRRT of firing a second after you hear the impact."

gaming,3c7fzw,cincinnati30,I don't know why you got down voted. The one he posted and the one you made are totally different mediums.\n\nNice job man! I saw your post in bead sprites first!
gaming,3c7fzw,liaquat,"So I posted this 24hours ago on /r/beadsprites.\n\nThought I would share it here on /r/gaming\n\nI'd like to thank /u/kylemccoy for the inspiration for this piece, I saw his ""Punch Out"" piece that he had done in perler beads, made some modifications and used Pixel Hobby pixel beads instead, took 6+ months on and off, no ironing, average 5-7 hours per baseplate/board. 18 boards, that can hold 2000 pixels per board/plate. So 36k in pixels, tedious, relaxing, fun, and the end result is well worth it.\n\nmore pix\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/YLDUZo3.jpg\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/teaIxLS.jpg\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/IwyrDw5.jpg\n\nand link to /u/kylemccoy Perler Bead version, thanks Kyle\n\nhttp://www.pixelartshop.com/uploads/9/2/0/8/920811/1728133_orig.jpg\n\nThanks for looking."
gaming,3c7fzw,liaquat,I love it! I want it!
gaming,3c7fzw,JoeyButtafuocosTaint,I like this a lot. I just wish it was made with pixels.
gaming,3c7jng,Northern_Chiliad,I was in the sucks a lot group for a while. Now I'm in the High but not ultra category.
gaming,3c7jng,byzantinebobby,That feel when you finally upgrade.
gaming,3c7jng,ceeroorice,Went from not being able to play KOTOR on lowest settings to being able to play Crysis 3 on high settings. Unnnnghhhh...
gaming,3c7jng,redgroupclan,Not being able to play KOTOR on low? ouch dude.
gaming,3c7jng,Floirt,"It was that old computers RAM that really got me. Didn't even have 1 GB AFTER it had been upgraded once.\n\nFunnily enough, this new computer I have is too new to play KOTOR on. KOTOR crashes a little into the first level so I still haven't gotten to play KOTOR."
gaming,3c7jng,redgroupclan,"A lot of people are gonna disagree with this, but I don't think you're missing much.  This is just my opinion, and if you enjoy these types of games then good on you, that's cool.  I, however, thought the combat system was terrible in KOTOR - think playing Mass Effect I in the Star Wars universe.\n\nI get that some people like that whole ""pause in the middle of a fight and issue commands to everyone, then unpause"" combat mechanic thing those games use, but I find it insanely tedious and boring, and even if a game has an amazing story (such as KOTOR or Mass Effect) I can't bring myself to finish the game as I'm bored as fuck playing it.\n\nIf you're into the Mass Effect type of combat and enjoy Star Wars, then I'd say play KOTOR.  If you aren't a fan of that whole ""Bioware's gameplay mechanic"" thingy, then just watch a series on Youtube that explains the KOTOR story."
gaming,3c7jng,bayek,Mass effect and kotors combat have zero parallels apart from the pausing game mechanic. You can play mass effect without even using it. I did it for all 3 games.
gaming,3c7jng,Reddeadgamer,"People pause in kotor? I turn autopause off completely and never pause to give orders at all. You really don't need to, even on the hardest setting. Even Mass Effect, which forces it on you a bit more, is perfectly beatable on Insanity without constantly pausing. I don't mind the Bioware combat system, which is why I've beaten Kotor at least 5 times and the whole Mass Effect trilogy three times, but the pause mechanic isn't nearly as required as you seem to think."
gaming,3c7jng,soulsofjojy,"Oh, I just played through both KOTORs recently! Here's how you can make them work.\n\nTurn on V-Sync and disable Frame Buffer Effects and Soft Shadows. If that's not enough, play windowed, fullscreen often fucks with KOTOR. You can have all other options to max. If that still doesn't work, try running kotor in compatibility mode for windows XP as well. You might run into a bug where text starts being automatically skipped if you really binge into the game (like 4-6 hours of gameplay in a row). Just restart the game if that happens.\n\nEDIT: Oh, and travelling cutscenes can crash the game if you're fullscreen. Just ALT-Enter to windowed and go back to fullscreen if it happens."
gaming,3c7jng,Floirt,"I can't understand how some people have so many issues with Kotor. On my Windows 7 laptop, it worked fine with just compatibility mode. On My Windows 8.1 desktop I built, it doesn't even need that. I've got it with all settings enabled, hd texture packs, and an ENB. Is it hardware specific issues?"
gaming,3c7jng,soulsofjojy,"Hardware issues, yes. Some graphics cards can't handle the old way the Kotors do things (like grass or some specific shadowing), IIRC. \n\nAlso of note is f.lux fucking with brightness on Kotor 2."
gaming,3c7jng,Floirt,It's like leaping into the future.
gaming,3c7jng,MeteoraGB,Crysis 3 on high settings\n\n\nlooking at the ground?
gaming,3c7jng,kolekelley2,That's max settings.
gaming,3c7jng,redgroupclan,"I used to be in the medium to high category, but once this new generation rolled around, I was in the low. Maybe medium if i was cool with >30 FPS.\n\nI got an upgrade. I went from a Intel Core 2 Quad Q9450 to a AMD FX6350. I upgraded from 8GB of DDR2 to 8gb of DDR3. I didn't upgrade my GPU much, I went from a EVGA GTX 460 SE to a EVGA GTX 460 (basically, the SE is a gimped version of the base 460.)"
gaming,3c7jng,Cewkie,That's still not much of an upgrade if all you got was a slight CPU improvement :(
gaming,3c7jng,xlzqwerty1,"yeah, i was gonna say, he had a really good quad core (for it's time) that he's trading for a mediocre 6 core."
gaming,3c7jng,watchtouter,"It was a hell of a CPU improvement. It runs at half the temps my old one ran at, and double the freq, although it is an AMD.\n\nand the 460 is AMAZING compared to the SE. My 460 is a superclocked variant, and the SE wasn't superclocked.\n\nI also went from 800MHz DDR2 to 1600MHz DDR3 that I overlocked to 2100MHz, I believe. I know a lot of that is anecdotal, but it really is a massive improvement over my old, aging PC."
gaming,3c7jng,Cewkie,"Sorry, I hope this post doesn't sound like I'm trying to attack your statements, but I would just like to point out that with personal biases aside, I wouldn't call it a huuuge improvement.\n\nDDR2 to DDR3 has really little, if not negligible performance increase. The frequency is not everything for RAM as one would have to look at the timings as well.\n\nFor the 460 vs 460 SE, I'd say it's at least a 10% to 15% performance increase in terms of graphical processing power, but again, still not much when you compare the same tiered graphics cards from each generation with improvements of ~20-30%.\n\nThe CPU on the other hand is a great upgrade from your older one (which is still very competent even in today's standards). This would have given you the most performance boost for your entire system (albeit one should remember that frequency should not be compared between different CPU architectures). \n\nBut hey, wait until you completely upgrade all your other components and you'll see what massive improvement really is! :)"
gaming,3c7jng,xlzqwerty1,"I can't really say much about DDR2 vs DDR3 other than my anecdotal experience proves it to be much better, although that could be a number of things. Besides, now I have room to grow, whereas on my old mobo I was maxed out at 800mhz and 8gb.\n\nAnd the 460 was pulled out of my brother's old PC, so it was free. I'm probably going to put a GTX960 in it eventually and probably about 4gb more into my PC. or another 8 if it isn't much more."

gaming,3c7jng,Wraithguy,"/r/buildapcsales if you don't know already. Happy upgrading! \n\nAlso, unless you need more vram, might wanna go with a 290x. 390 is basically the exact same card to my understanding with very neglibable performance gains."

gaming,3c84i0,VIsForVoltz2,"Your mother jerks off pigs. She gets down on her knees and crawls through the pigpiss mud slop and snuggles up to the pig, her fingers tracing along it’s belly until she finds it’s cock. She begins tugging and stroking as her twat moistens, her breasts swelling and her nipples begin to stick out like erasers on a fresh #2 pencil. She grunts with satisfaction as the pig begins eagerly thrusting into her hand, her grip now tightening to maintain control of the pig’s greasy corkscrew cock. She lowers her head to watch the cock work in her hand, groans with satisfaction and begins working her clit with her other muddy hand, her hips gyrating with the rhythm of the pig’s thrusting.\n\n“Oh fucking jesus god yes..” she gasps. She changes positions, still maintaining control of the feverishly thrusting cock as the pig’s squealing intensifies. She leans forward and with her lips almost touching the pig’s ear, she whispers your name and begins to shudder. She turns her attention again to the pigs swollen member rocking in her hand. She presses it between her hand and her face, the pig thrusting it against her cheeks as she drools. With a massive grunt and a high pitched squeal, the pig’s balls explode, beginning a massive shower of hot, sour pig jizz. You mother cups one hand under the fountain of steaming genetic material gathering it in her hand as the thrusting comes to an end. The pig shudders and begins to walk to the trough of slop in the corner of it’s pen, but your mother tackles it to the ground. She lifts it’s tail and smears the handful of pig load into the pig’s own fetid butthole, turning flakes of crusty pig shit into a pigshit-pigjizz mud slop on the pigs ass. Now she tilts her head to the sky and screams your name, not once, not twice, but three times. She slams her face full force into the pig’s butthole and it’s wreath of shitsemen pudding, her tongue machine gun flicking the rim and then burying itself to the hilt inside the pig’s hot colon. Your mother works her tongue around the inside of the pigs ass, and then as a few incoherent syllables escaped her now brown lips, spurts of female ejaculate spurt from her pulsating cunt. Exhausted, she collapses in the mud, rolls over onto her back, and lights a cigarette. She takes one long drag, looks again to the sky, and speaks your name one last time before she drifts off to sleep. \n\nThat’s your mom. Your mom does that."

gaming,3c86h2,WretchedMonkey,"Those white lines in the pic. Those are connectors for multiple GPUs, if I'm not mistaken. Many cards are made SLI-ready. Basically, there are separate connectors that go GPU-to-GPU. From there, you can use the included GPU program to split the various graphic effects between cards or to evenly distribute the processes between them. Depending on the amount of cards, card type/specs, and the game, you can have increased performance without burning up your cards."

gaming,3c86h2,megaapple,"This doesn't belong in gaming, and I'll explain why. That motherboard is at least from 2008 or earlier, with a LGA 775 socket. The latest processor used in that are intel core 2 quads, which would require a dedicated video card to play anything but flash games. Most likely, looking at the latch on the cpu heatsink, it's even older, supported by the fact it has so many headers for ide cables, and headers for db9 ports, along with the giant pink parallel port on the back, and obvious primary placement of the ps2 mouse and keyboard connectors.\n\nTLDR: no games being played on this thing."

We're talking like some real +2 morale +2 movement level stuff (that's not actually one of them, just an idea of the strength they had).

gaming,3cagei,Tribat_1,"My math is a little off i see, its more like 15 years. Still a long time and happy reunion :)\nI'm having some trouble getting some of the games to work, they are not 64-bit compatible :/"
gaming,3cagei,Lionstrong,When I see that I want to be 16 years old again.
gaming,3cagei,titaniumhud,That delicious SWAT3 disc... some still play.
gaming,3cagei,Officer_Hotpants,Can't remember if there's a multiplayer option for it. But that was and still is a sweet game
gaming,3cagei,Hoenderboude,This looks like you hi-jacked my collection!
gaming,3cagei,Redfootie,I still play heroes 2 and 3. Let me know if you want to play. Like seriously.
gaming,3cagei,rage9000,I miss Swat 1. That game was so cool.
gaming,3cagei,masterkm,Oh shit SWAT 3! I loved the hell out of that game!
gaming,3cagei,mmherzog,Original half-life... good old sierra
gaming,3cagei,icebear518,"Well as for Baldur's Gate, you should just get the updated versions."
gaming,3cagei,mmherzog,Nice!\n\nI unpacked my closet the other day and found my old disks and game manuals as well. I Too still have my Hidden and Dangerous Manual. What an awesome game that was.\n\nEDIT: http://imgur.com/B1wuzrW
gaming,3cagei,theghostwithoutaname,Hidden and Dangerous 1 is completely free now as part of the ad campaign for the sequel. I have no idea if it works on windows 7 but you can give it a try if you want.\n\nIt can be downloaded Here
gaming,3cagei,Intrexa,try using the cd key on steam
gaming,3cagei,imanAholebutimfunny,SWAT 3!!! Stackup!! Breach and Clear!!
gaming,3cagei,AliasUndercover,As a 35 year old man looks like my old collection. Throw in a little X-Wing and Tie Fighter and i am set.
gaming,3cagei,Bleue22,also throw in some falcon gold and Trespasser
gaming,3cagei,barrygibb,Maybe a little Daggerfall as well and Fallout
gaming,3cagei,Bleue22,Diablo!
gaming,3cagei,Fleuramie,"My memory is a little foggy, but did the CD case come cracked new out of the box? I'm not really sure where/how I got them all, but I have 3 copies of D1, all the CD cases are cracked. I keep immaculate care of my games, only like 5 cases of my games in my entire collection have any damage, but it somehow happened to all 3 D1 cases. Seeing it be the only cracked one in OP's pic, I'm starting to think maybe they just come that way?"
gaming,3cagei,TheRealQwade,what sucks is that halflife cd was probably a 4 5 or 6 digit steam id. zzzzzz
gaming,3cagei,turible,I have a bunch of those I bought myself back then. Good luck getting any of them to work. I have had hell with some of mine.
gaming,3cagei,Generic123,"Pretty much all these games can be had on either steam or good old games.  The nice thing about digital delivery is that there is no need for physical media.\n\nEvery so often I run across a game that has no digital download available.  AoE (the first one) comes to mind, the mechwarrior series, no one lives forever series, I think gears of war for windows is no longer available...\n\nSo the good news is that you can replace these games with their digital editions for not all that much money, and not lose them ever again."
gaming,3cagei,FanofWhiskey,Often you can enter the cd keys from the physical copy and unlock the steam version that way.
gaming,3cagei,garlotch,"yeah, GOG doesn't do this though."
gaming,3cagei,Rurrik,"Oh the memories...  Heroes II was my dad's favorite game, he played it for hours on hours daily."
gaming,3cagei,Zerg0,We would've been good friends growing up
gaming,3cagei,jackmusick,"I had most of those games. That was the fucking golden age, man."
gaming,3cagei,connect_fist,Mom: CAUSE YOU BETTA BOOK A FLIGHT TO SEE DEES NUTS
gaming,3cagei,Belaires,I loved playing AOE2 on whatever the MSN platform was called. That and the original Rainbow 6 on MPlayer and then Gamespy
gaming,3cagei,Suttledge,"Wow, your choice in games is... fucking excellent!"
gaming,3cagei,Arctyc38,That's some good taste right there
gaming,3cagei,nemecross,Awesome stash - I wish they had Icewind Dale II on Steam...
gaming,3cagei,book_smrt,Someone needs to take the weekend off.
gaming,3cagei,beef6779,"Swat 3 = Was an amazing game, as was AoE2 and D2, havent played the others, but have heard of them before."
gaming,3cagei,TwistedXPoison,This looks like you stole these from my closet.  So odd.  \n\nBut I also have Might and Magic 7 and 8.
gaming,3cagei,babybabybabybaby1,"Dude Baldurs Gate is the shit! If someone where to play that game now, they would fully understand what my childhood was like!"
gaming,3cagei,R6dave000,"Similar story - I was digging through some old moving boxes I found in a trailer that'd been sitting for years, and among the articles was a guidebook for Everquest.  I didn't know whether to be nostalgic or ashamed."
gaming,3cagei,DebentureThyme,"Those heroes of might and magic manuals, HNNNNNNNNNG"
gaming,3cagei,Vanorei,Excellent collection. Heroes II ftw
gaming,3cagei,sdrawkcabtiyas,Heroes III ftw.\n\nFTFY ;)  (2 was awesome but 3 was undoubtedly the king)
gaming,3cagei,Callefutbol,Half Life 1 confirmed!
gaming,3cagei,MagnificentMako,I see you have age of empires... \n\nThe most fun you can have crashing your computer.
gaming,3cagei,Tyzorg,Throw in some ES and you are me
gaming,3cagei,ned356763,Half-Life key should redeem fine on Steam.
gaming,3cagei,rraadduurr,I think I see my favorite
gaming,3cagei,Koneesha,fucking Red Alert!
gaming,3cagei,uncultivated_chef,HEROES
gaming,3cagei,2litersam,I'm pleased to say that I have all of these games in their original format. Good find.
