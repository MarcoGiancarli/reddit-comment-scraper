karliekloss,1vbz4t,pfool,1 point,Thu Jan 16 03:11:28 2014 UTC,This is the first pic I've seen of her that hasn't made my jaw hit the floor. Any other pictures of her with that hair?
karliekloss,1vbz4t,wesjall,2,Thu Jan 16 15:07:50 2014 UTC,"What do you mean? Do you not like this look? This is from Fendi AW13, which was a fur fest. Fur on the heads and shoes, coats etc."
karliekloss,1vbz4t,wesjall,1 point,Sat Jan 18 14:04:33 2014 UTC,"I didn't really, I think it's just the angle though, it doesn't really look like her to me, idk. I'll have to check out other pics from it tho"
karliekloss,1vanun,kstew4eva,4,Wed Jan 15 19:19:43 2014 UTC,"I think that she was always going to be the next big thing because, well look at her. But I will say she rocks short hair well! I think she's cut it since when the VS show was recorded, but she had just about shoulder length hair then. It was so cute. http://imgur.com/IbJcgSX"
karliekloss,1vanun,pfool,2,Thu Jan 16 02:55:57 2014 UTC,I agree. I think she is one of the few people can sport that haircut.

karliekloss,1u9lzj,619rko9,1 point,Thu Jan 2 23:08:26 2014 UTC,I don't get why you're getting downvoted so much.
karliekloss,1u9lzj,619rko9,1 point,Fri Jan 3 01:59:28 2014 UTC,I always seem to be downvoted immediately; I think there might be some automatic downvote bots on me.
