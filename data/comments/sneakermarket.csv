sneakermarket,3dvg5o,SeaDooCanDo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:23:42 2015 UTC,"I'd try listing these on eBay too if you haven't already.  I almost never sell anything on here, but eBay eats it up.  I sold a pair of DS Carmines for $250 last week on eBay (after listing them on here for cheaper), and they were on eBay for like a day at most.  And I could tell they were popular because of views/watchers."
sneakermarket,3dvg5o,thedarklordxenu,2,Sun Jul 19 22:06:40 2015 UTC,"Nah I hate eBay, the fees are ridiculous and the eBay process itself is annoying as hell"
sneakermarket,3dvg5o,thedarklordxenu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:07:26 2015 UTC,"I agree about the fees.  That's why you then bumb the price up on these a little bit to account for those, then ship via FedEx Smartpost cause it's super cheap.  What else about the process don't you like?  I don't do auctions, only buy it now, and I can't imagine how it could be easier."
sneakermarket,3dvg5o,FightGar,2,Sun Jul 19 22:10:53 2015 UTC,"eBay and paypal heavily favor the buyer, and you are probably more likely to get an asshole / scammer that will file a claim against you that you wont be able to do much about."
sneakermarket,3dvg5o,thedarklordxenu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:20:37 2015 UTC,"Does eBay add something that PayPal doesn't?  Like, I would assume a buyer can file the same kind of claim via PayPal that they can with eBay, so you're at the same disadvantage as a seller regardless.  As far as having more asshole-eyeballs on your listing via eBay, I can definitely see that."

sneakermarket,3dqyct,nielish,3,Sat Jul 18 19:46:28 2015 UTC,Yea its pretty stupid a lot of people just bought to re sell when they don't even enjoy the shoes. I really wanted them. But for $300 that's ridiculous.
sneakermarket,3dqyct,nielish,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:35:52 2015 UTC,"I agree. I truly love all of the sneakers i purchase. But the secondary market has become a joke. I tried to get the Nike Lab Shock Darts, but they sold out in literally one second. I was on the Nike online-store, watching the countdown. When I was able to place the order, literally within seconds, the item was sold out. The bots are out of control. The secondary markets fuels the madness."
sneakermarket,3dqyct,Anthonybuck21,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:22:46 2015 UTC,Yea I was on the reebok website waiting for the release at 12am and when it released I added them to my cart and I clicked checkout typed in my info then it just brought me back to the page where they get added to your cart about 6-7 times. Then I tried them the next morning when they released at 7:30am same thing happened as before. Then I decided to get a bot for the final release which was on shoe palace at 10am the problem this time is they didn't end up releasing them until around 10:40 when I came back and they were gone. So I just bought them from someone else.

sneakermarket,3dkt4z,ThisGuy32,8,Fri Jul 17 02:03:25 2015 UTC,"That's alot of work, more than likely people who flake will just be put on blast. But again, that systems flawed because you can just change your username. Stick to PayPal only. Or change the rules to make sure each shoe FS has an eBay listing attached."
sneakermarket,3dkt4z,Mrcollinz,6,Fri Jul 17 02:49:37 2015 UTC,"Most subs that rely on selling have some sort of system in place. It's not flawed, if they have no rep that means its a sketchy sale. You know they are legit if they have past sales, you can deny a trade if they had none.  It's not a lot of work. I guarantee other subs will be more than willing to assist by sharing their verification CSS flairs  It's just another means of protection. No reason not to have it when it can be so easy and helpful to implement."
sneakermarket,3dkt4z,Dogexecutive,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:31:55 2015 UTC,"I honestly like the way that /r/cigars has their setup. Yeah you have to trade cigars to verify and it would be hard with sneakers, but if we get together we could figure it out.   Listen we are here to buy and sell our prize possessions, some worth a lot of money and others not so much. If im sending my kicks to someone i want to know as a seller im not completely screwed and as a buyer i want to know im not getting robbed. Itll be hard, those situations will arise.. but the verification will keep our minds as ease."
sneakermarket,3dkt4z,RichterFry,7,Fri Jul 17 19:35:26 2015 UTC,We don't even have looking for/for sale flairs for posts lol
sneakermarket,3dkt4z,michaelbrewer7,5,Fri Jul 17 03:01:56 2015 UTC,"Good idea, but there's literally no mods watching this sub. Somebody modded me to watch it but the owner (who doesn't even check here) unmodded me because he's racist so good luck matey"
sneakermarket,3dkt4z,clashofhope,3,Fri Jul 17 03:44:34 2015 UTC,It's because you're a pirate isn't it. I bet that's the reason. Pirates aren't known to be very trustworthy.

sneakermarket,3dkt4z,i_nate,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:26:28 2015 UTC,"Who are the mods of this sub? I'm sorely reminded of bboykai every time I'm here cause of that sticky, but I never think to look when I'm on my computer. There really is no moderation here and self policing works to an extent but not nearly enough. It doesn't seem like we've gotten much spam lately, or they are actually getting rid of it, but as for pictures prices and whatnot being required, that shit just gets looked over, from what I've seen anyway.   Also, didn't /r/kicksmarket have a thing where you verified a successful sale to the mods and they gave you flair? We should just overhaul both the markets together with the mods from over there and get this place to where it could be. I've sold 6 or 7 pairs through here and it's alway easy and people are cordial. I don't even try to sell on Facebook because of the lowballs, and eBay sucks with its giant commission."
sneakermarket,3dkt4z,AutomatedLieMachine,2,Fri Jul 17 05:09:32 2015 UTC,We can just have mods put notes next to peoples names i suppose.

sneakermarket,3cd7sl,plush3r,6,Tue Jul 7 00:19:32 2015 UTC,"wow. my favorite sneak of all time. i keep thinking in my mind ""just wait until they are down to 200 or 250 and then buy a pair"" when in reality they will probably get even more expensive over time :'("
sneakermarket,3cd7sl,rnitch,2,Tue Jul 7 01:26:25 2015 UTC,"I'm with you.  I kept thinking the Chicagos would drop to a reasonable price...they haven't come close.  My hope now is Nike has been hoarding a stockpile that they plan to release online at some point.  And when they finally get their crap together and figure out how they want to handle their online releases, they'll flood the marketplace.  Then I hopefully either get a pair from them, or prices just drop in general."

Didn't have size 12 anymore next day, so he asked if I wanted a size 11.5 telling me I would fit them.   I was skeptical, and didn't want to buy something from Poland I might not fit, so I asked him to switch to the silver/gray ZX Flux Xenos. He said sure, refunded me 10$ for the slight mix-up, and yesterday my silver/gray ZX Flux Xenos came in, brand new in box. Best part is is that he was right, I totally could've fit a 11.5 with how stretchy these are so he definitely knows his shit too.

sneakermarket,3brq3q,OkAutopilot,2,Wed Jul 1 16:44:30 2015 UTC,I've seen you post these about 3-4 times now all at a very similar price. I'm start by saying by no means am I an expert on this shoe but what you have is a lovely tribute to back to the future. I do feel that these are not sought after to the extent that you are charging especially without the limited edition box that some came with. I would say that you may find that person that is willing to pay the amount you are asking but I would suggest that you lower the price significantly.  Peace.
sneakermarket,3brq3q,jib11,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:39:09 2015 UTC,"Only 2nd time I've posted these I think. I've sold a pair for $375 without card/box in the past year so I'm willing to wait this price out at $300, or something around it. Appreciate the advice."

These haven't been worn many times, I would say they've been on my feet fewer than 10 times. The only cosmetic issue is a small series of little punctures on the upper left portion of the heel on the left shoe. I'm not sure what did it (or how) but overall it's fairly negligible. They'll be shipped double boxed. If you have any questions or trade offers (only Asics or Nike runners/airmaxes, I'll almost certainly say no to J's) feel free to message me.
