HuntsvilleAlabama,3dzu9f,asdlkfdjldsknlas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:52:19 2015 UTC,"But nobody wants that. It's not just Madison Square, indoor malls across America are dying left and right. They were a fad that peaked. Bridge Street may be hot right now, but that's where people want to go. Almost every single new multi-site retail development is using the ""open air mixed use"" model."
HuntsvilleAlabama,3dzu9f,mr_one_liner,3,Tue Jul 21 19:14:05 2015 UTC,"Open air mixed use is a fad too, I think. Or at least, the fake ""mixed use"" is. True mixed use (downtown, Providence) provides a lasting model, IMO."
HuntsvilleAlabama,3dzu9f,FalconHunter,2,Tue Jul 21 19:31:04 2015 UTC,"And in a few years, another fad style will come along and make Bridge Street a ghost town, just as strip malls from the 60s and 70s ended up in the 80s and 90s.   Like I said, it's all cyclical.  One more note, it's hot now and it will be cold, wet, and rainy in the fall/winter/spring. Indoor malls will likely have a resurgence in the future, possibly in a new style or format - primarily because not everywhere is California or Florida and temperature spikes and dips impact sales in a negative way (people just don't want to get out in the elements.)"
HuntsvilleAlabama,3dzu9f,J3RK,0,Tue Jul 21 20:16:21 2015 UTC,Yes.
HuntsvilleAlabama,3dzu9f,Katieinthemountains,3,Tue Jul 21 19:29:31 2015 UTC,And I think this is crazy. When do people want to go to the mall? When it is raining and when it is December and we need Christmas presents. At least the parking near Belk reduces the maximum amount of walk time if you need only stores near the middle.
HuntsvilleAlabama,3dzu9f,FalconHunter,3,Tue Jul 21 19:36:03 2015 UTC,"That's just it. The open-air model is/was just a PR stunt and a way to pitch a large shopping center in a way that the community won't say ""we've already got one of those a mile or two away.""   The open-air model is great if the weather is great or even tolerable. If the weather is unpleasant or extreme, open-air venues will see negative impacts to their sales.   And just like MSM, once the shine and novelty wear off, you'll see major retailers seeking assistance because the customers just aren't coming out in the rain/heat. The question is - will that novelty wear off before the planted trees have a chance to grow and flourish into shade or will Bridge Street have to consider covered walkways, canvas tarps, etc to help? And what about the cold winter months? Not just here, but places north of here with snow and freezing temperatures?   Is ahjsadghjfasd-whatever-his-name is going to try and tell me that ""nobody"" wants indoor shopping options? He can repeat that PR nonsense all he wants but he's a damn liar if he's claiming it to be a unanimous sentiment."

HuntsvilleAlabama,3dzu9f,FalconHunter,9,Tue Jul 21 04:07:10 2015 UTC,"What a lot of the younger crowd (those under 30) may not recall is that this is just a cycle in Huntsville.  In the late 80's, the businesses at the corner of University and Mem. Pkwy were part of a mall with Toys R Us and a chain bookstore being the only anchors. The interior of that mall was just as abandoned and desolate then as MSM is now. At that same time, MSM was flourishing, it was always active and it was positively PACKED during the holidays.   During this same time period, Parkway City Mall was in it's death throes and was just about to hit the same bottom-of-the-pit as MSM. All but the anchor stores and a few specialty retailers had bailed in favor of MSM. Then Parkway Place was conceived and realized and it slapped MSM. The management at MSM just couldn't maintain the vendors and the retail landscape as a whole was changed by online shopping and the desire to avoid hooligans in the mall (which was always a problem but had become insufferable around 2003-2005.)   Bridge Street was the new face of retail (the open-air model) and so many of the major retailers flocked there to capture that new interest and abandoned MSM. If this had been a larger city and there was more distance between locations, perhaps both locations could have remained. But Huntsville is still small in the grand scheme of things and can't support 2 locations so close together. There was no need for both locations and so they closed the old one. Other retailers followed suit and thus you had a dead mall with no way to recover and no new retailers to attract.   Bridge Street very much dealt the death blow to MSM, but it was because of how closely it was built to MSM, nothing more.   Don't even get me started on the once and former husk that was ""Heart of Huntsville Mall"" which had one of the last remaining Woolworth's in the state until the mid-90's.   I patronized MSM in it's glory days and even worked there off and on from 1994-2000 before I moved away. So many fond memories of the sights (the fountains before they were removed), the sounds (Time Out, the Muzak), the smells (the different food court vendors, the always-there aromas of Courtyard Coffee that wafted soothingly through the entire mall, Bath and Body Works on ""truck day""), and the energy. Countless trade and fashion shows would fill the center court to bursting much of the time. Outdoor shows would fill the walkways with camping gear, collector shows saw dozens and dozens of card, coin, comic, and other collectibles being sold by various vendors in the walkways. The hunger-inducing aroma of the pretzel place (which I only patronized once in all of the time it was there.) The many ours being bombarded by the latest, loudest video games amidst the smell of french fries and pizza from the nearby food court at Time Out. The other-worldly scents that would drift out of Mark's Imports, where you could dream of being a biker while surrounded by leather jackets and bandannas or a ninja while staring at the wall of replica weapons behind the counter. (Or get your favorite incense and/or blacklights and posters!)   I will always remember my time at MSM with fondness and nostalgia. I was lucky enough to spend a couple of good years watching the traffic in the mall from the full-window storefront of a small, boxed-down furniture company known as The Bombay Company. We could see, smell, hear, and feel the crowds each day as we observed from our glass-walled store and interacted with them as we met customers in the loading bay (behind Courtyard Coffee) or unloaded shipment trucks. And later, I worked with many young people at a hip place called Gadzooks (the clothing store with the music videos and the half VW-Beetle inside?) Heck, I even worked for Software Etc (later bought out by GameStop) when some of the most memorable games and consoles hit the market. I had lifelong friends that I still stay in touch with that I made simply from working in that mall (some of the girls at World Winds, a barista at Courtyard Coffee, a manager at Amercian Eagle, managers and employees at Structure and Bath & Body)  While Huntsville may be eager to tear down the eyesore that is little more than a ghost of it's former self, please remember that some of us did grow up with that venue front-and-center in our lives and we do have good memories of that place. Some of us will always see what was in place of what is. Give us that last moment to whisper goodbye before dancing on the ruins, would ya?"
HuntsvilleAlabama,3dzu9f,FalconHunter,3,Tue Jul 21 16:00:52 2015 UTC,No doubt. The mall life cycle in large cities goes exactly like this. I remember the last days of the parkway mall over by toys r us/books a million. It was empty (aside from the pet store) and pretty dead. Then it finally killed over and they tore it down and MSM was king.
HuntsvilleAlabama,3dzu9f,Capotesan,6,Tue Jul 21 16:29:35 2015 UTC,"Oh MSM was king long before that mall was torn down. I recall that it had the pet store, several wig stores, a barber shop, and I think a few urban clothing stores before they nuked it in favor of a Home Depot and extra real estate for other stand-alone businesses.   Parkway City Mall was the one that was barely holding on until they renovated into Parkway Place. The difference between the two was night and day. The renovated venue was now 2 story, had carpeting, twice as much space inside, skylights, updated decor and ventilation, parking decks outside, a real food court, and updated retailers including key anchor stores."
HuntsvilleAlabama,3dzu9f,juez,2,Tue Jul 21 17:01:11 2015 UTC,I was too young to know how long MSM had been around and I rarely went there with family. Interesting how those last few remaining stores echo what is left in MSM now. The parkway mall change was pretty massive. Although I never really went. I think the idea of malls is slowly dying out in favor of buying online.

It's not a walking-friendly community unless you want to walk to Carmax.  If they do build multi-use community, it had better be an entire tiny city in one because otherwise, it's a parking lot.  There's no nature, etc."
HuntsvilleAlabama,3dzu9f,MrDonamus,3,Tue Jul 21 13:45:54 2015 UTC,"They will have to tear up all that parking to do that. Which I hope they do honestly. I can put up with all the noise that will bring, but it will be better in the long run. I really hope they make a small little community center with shopping, restaurants, and some housing. That would be like a micro-providence."
HuntsvilleAlabama,3dzu9f,runningfrombears,3,Tue Jul 21 14:14:59 2015 UTC,"I have heard one plan that was basically an affordable version of Providence. Any new development would have to meet current City of Huntsville requirements, so even a parking lot would have more greenspace. I hope they do make a mixed use community - the proximity to grocery stores, restaurants, banks, and Research Park make it a great location. If they added a safe way for bikes to cross Research Park Blvd, it'd be perfect."

I bought my place because of the same reasons, but having more options that are a bike ride away would be great for me. I also wish there was a safer crossing. Crossing 72 by Walmart has almost gotten me hit a couple times."
HuntsvilleAlabama,3dzu9f,mcaustic,3,Tue Jul 21 19:44:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I live west of there and used to work east, so my choices for bike commuting were 72 or that overpass on Bradford. I'm not fast enough to feel safe on either route. I wish we had bike lanes separate from traffic for safety. The Greenways are cool, but they don't go the places I need to - although connecting the Indian Creek Greenway pieces would let us cross 72."

Way to be part of the solution....asshole.  Your post would have been better spent by telling people that they should follow a safe distance from the car in front and allow others to merge in. People like you, failing to yield room to merging traffic is why others feel the need to take the short cut.  FYI - I'm the guy in the big red truck that will spin you into the guardrail if you are trying to be an asshole driver. There's a reason for the big bumpers on trucks."

Yes, you can open carry all you want in AL but you make all gun owners in AL look like the stereotypical rednecks with guns.   What threat do they think exists here? There was a single isolated incident from a person suffering from mental illness, and they want to do what in case that happens here? Get into a public gunfight? Kill another person? Firearms defense rule #1 ""Get yourself out of harms way"" not ""Openly look for threats and go on the offensive"".   I get they want to be helpful, but they just come off as man-children who want to be seen as tough and patriotic with their guns."
HuntsvilleAlabama,3e2954,silentmunky,2,Tue Jul 21 15:49:01 2015 UTC,"There was a single isolated incident   Just because the links are not obvious, does not make it an isolated incident.   Was this shooter conspiring with another? Not that we know of, but then again, we never proved that the Boston bombers were linked to any group either. There have been an awful lot of ""coincidences"" in the last 15 years that all share the common thread of Islam. Sometimes you have to call a spade a spade and realize that evil exists in this world and someone needs to step up and be a defender of our freedom to live as we choose because there are those out there willing to die to end our way of life.  77 Deaths and 321 injuries have been attributed to 43 attacks by Muslims on American soil since 9/11.  Military facilities attacked by Muslims  Chattanoonga  Little Rock  Fort Hood  There may be more, but I don't have time for more research."
HuntsvilleAlabama,3e2954,ezfrag,4,Tue Jul 21 18:17:25 2015 UTC,"but this is purely associated with timing.  They are stationed there because of a specific event and for very specific publicity.    I don't doubt that you and /u/mirathi would use your weapons to protect people at a moment's notice but you're part of the public going about your lives.  You are willing to defend and don't need the public recognition or attention from it.    The day after it happened, I was eating at the thai place and walked down there to treat everyone to cookies and say that I'm sorry.  I care.  I felt for them (they were closed btw) but I don't need the biggest gun in my arsenal to show that and I don't need to make a spectacle of it.    This is an empty publicity maneuver and I don't have a lot of respect for it.  I have more eyerolls than anything else.    And it's honestly a pet peeve while I'm ranting - I hate when society doesn't prepare but reacts and reacts STRONGLY after the fact.  These guys have always been fucking vulnerable.  They're in a glass front fishbowl - the exact same setup we have here, they had in Chattanooga.  The military personnel have always been identified as an OPSEC risk.  It was stupid that they weren't armed to begin with.  Hell - the Times Square recruiting center has been attacked before.    So let's focus our energy on not only fixing THIS situation but shoring up future ones instead of standing around with our biggest guns out.    (Sorry that totally devolved by the end but whatever, a girl needs to rant sometimes.)  [Edit to add] - The first person to do this (not here but in another part of the country) was undoubtedly sincere.  However, this situation is now about people standing around showing off their guns and bullshitting.  Part of the devolution is the movement away from the message and the ""fun happy times"" of being part of a crowd.  ""HEY LOOK!  WE'RE ON TV"""

I've lived in Tehran, there is no reasoning with people who's very religion says that killing the people who disagree with your faith is not only OK, but it is a good thing. If they cannot be converted, and are unwilling to pay Jizya, then they must be killed. Remember we are dealing with a man who has already issued a Caliphate claiming to be the true leader of all Muslims and who claims that the Islamic State is the only true government for Muslims worldwide."
HuntsvilleAlabama,3e2954,ezfrag,2,Tue Jul 21 19:47:52 2015 UTC,"There are several branches of Islam practice, so I don't think it is fair to group them all together as a homogeneous group hellbent on creating death. I don't think we should profile or stereotype all Muslims based on the actions of a few (who also show signs of mental health issues). These people who commit these acts are usually preyed upon and led to believe lies, which is a common practice among all radical groups religious or not.  What threat? There is no credible threat from extremist in this country. Sure, there will be small incidents and issues (impossible to monitor or prevent all of these), but Alabama =/= Tehran, dude. There is no need to spread fear about a very large, complex religious practice over what some group has declared."
HuntsvilleAlabama,3e2954,silentmunky,2,Tue Jul 21 19:58:48 2015 UTC,"Pew Research has stated that of the estimated 1.5 Billion Muslims in the world approximately 5% are actively involved in Jihad, that's 75 Million people.  Of the 1.5 Billion Muslims in the world approximately 25% support or condone violent Jihad, that's 375 Million people.   That 25% or that 5% may not be the majority, but they are the problem, and it is not a political war we are facing, it is by definition a holy war, that we are trying to fight with politics and war.  Here is a pretty good video on the subject, the best part starts around 4:30."
HuntsvilleAlabama,3e2954,ezfrag,2,Tue Jul 21 21:21:19 2015 UTC,"The real issue at hand is this, there is no credible domestic threat from a unified group. Crazy outliers will always be there, but there is no real threat to the general population of the US. That study just confirms that there is a large group of the global Muslim population who have resorted to violence. I would guess that is solely due to having their country/regions destabilized by US intervention or is a by-product of said destabilization.   The last thing we need to do is spread fear from misleading stats/polls about a threat that has no possibility of happening on US soil. I don't think those people are the problem, I think you should look at the real root causes and not treat a VERY large group of people, across the globe, as a single entity."

The US Supreme Court has upheld the states right to forced labor in prisons and the Federal prison system requires ALL able bodied prisoners to work except those involved in education, rehab, or flight risks.

Organic, pesticide free, all-natural fruit that the caretakers were encouraging us to pick, and she is afraid of a fly.

Various game nights take place around the area, and while none may be specifically for D&D, it'd be a way to meet others who are into roleplay games. Straight to Ale has one, as well as Grounded coffee in Madison. Feel free to post on our Facebook page, too."

Each Wednesday, players met to play a single ""encounter"" (like a fight scene in a  movie with maybe a little character interaction/dialog) in an adventure. The adventure is the ""season"" for Encounters, so if you show up for them all (not required), you participate in the whole story.  Both the Deep Comics & Games and Rogue Merchant Games are actively participating. Haven Comics has organized such events in the past and may be listed on the official website, but they are not participating in the current season.  There are private groups that meet at the various shops in town. They may or may not be interested in new players. I'd recommend asking around.  Additionally, various fan conventions have game events that may include scheduled RPG games. In October, the Huntsville Library will be hosting the Rocket City NerdCon and role-playing games will be available to play."

Dungeons & Dragons is simply the most well-known. There are all kinds of settings and rules. If you enjoy a fantasy setting and feel a bit more familiar with D&D, play it by all means. It is a great game. I just wanted you to realize that you may be limiting yourself by simply asking about D&D instead of any RPG."

HuntsvilleAlabama,3dvshu,samsonevickis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:06:57 2015 UTC,"IMHO: their menu had way too much stuff on it requiring them to stock a lot of different ingredients, prices were high, and sort of weird service. I thought they'd streamline the menu after they closed the first time and try to focus on what they were good at/made them different, but they just added more stuff to the menu when they reopened.   Edit: damn autocorrect."
HuntsvilleAlabama,3dvshu,omega_ix9,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:28:29 2015 UTC,"I hadn't heard of it until now, but I think crowdfunding to keep a restaurant open is a great idea.  You could put rewards up like ""donate X amount and you get to change this aspect about the restaurant"" be it add a new dish, change the dress policy, whatever it was that made you say you loved the place, except for this one thing.

The only thing that excelled in this restaurant is how mediocre the food was. It was so mediocre it's like they defined the term. The price point was definitely not in line with the food they sold, and to be honest even if it was I probably wouldn't have come back anyway. Somebody somewhere does whatever they did better. Their closing didn't surprise me. Their re-opening did."

HuntsvilleAlabama,3debiz,xxscott05xx,6,Wed Jul 15 16:34:11 2015 UTC,"Just a reminder to anyone who wants to use this service, each mobile hotspot is assigned a X-UIDH number which can be used to single you out. This identifier can be seen by any site you visit and there are already companies using this to build a profile of users to target them with direct ads. Here are two more articles about this, propublica and Forbes  This header modification eliminates your ability to remain anonymous online and makes you a target for ads and possibly malicious users who use this unique identifier. For example, here is how Turn uses the unique header to sell your profile on an open market for advertisers.   When a user visits a website that contains Turn tracking code, the company holds an auction within milliseconds for advertisers to target that user. The highest bidder's ad instantly appears on the user's screen as the web page loads. Turn says it receives 2 million requests for online advertising placements per second.  For its auctions to work, Turn needs to identify web users by cookies, which are small text files that are stored on their computers. The cookies allow Turn to identify a user's web browsing habits, such as an interest in sports or shopping, which it uses to lure advertisers to the auction.   I sent am email to Bill Steiner, IT director for the city of Huntsville, about this last January. He was just as concerned about it and he said he would forward that to the project lead about this. I heard nothing since. User /u/HSVtoss was able to see their X-UIDH number from their mifi device.  Hope this info helps. I would not recommend using these devices. It can compromise your personal information and security. To see if your header has been modified, you can check by using checkyourinfo.com."

If that header modification is passed on to the next hop, who's to say they won't use it?  BTW, if you have aren't changing you MAC address when using the free public wi-fi in retail stores, ESPECIALLY the one's that invite you to like them on Facebook or follow them on Twitter for a discount, there is a very good probability that you are being tracked by that retailer. The partner my company uses, boasts that they have paired over 5 million different MAC addresses with social media accounts for the retailers  to which they provide managed access points. It spells it right out in the Terms & Conditions that no-one reads. The kicker is that you don't even have to connect to the wi-fi for me to see your MAC address. You merely have to have your wi-fi on. I can still see where you are in the store, how often you visit, and how long you stay, I just can't relate your device to a puchase, or person unless you opt in."

HuntsvilleAlabama,3dgqt2,tallcupofwater,12,Thu Jul 16 03:33:40 2015 UTC,"Well, to better answer this, it kinda depends on what you want. Do you have a family or are you single or a couple? Kids? Are you working and, if so, where?  As a very general guideline, I usually recommend:   Singles and couples: Downtown, Five Points and the Medical District. Lots of things to do. Reasonably easy commute to the Arsenal and Research Park. Downtown is rapidly starting to become something really neat. Families: Madison, South Huntsville, and Jones Valley. Good schools (especially in Madison) and safe, family friendly area. Lots of parks, recreation opportunities. Slightly longer commute, but if you've ever lived in a city that really does have bad traffic and commutes, you will laugh at what people here called ""bad traffic"" and a ""long commute."" If you have money: Hampton Cove and Green Mountain. Wealthy. Even ""longer"" commute.   Also, as a general rule, I recommend not going north of 72. Basically, draw a line from US-72 in northern Madison east-northeast across the top part of Huntsville.   I have absolutely no empirical data to back this up, so take it with a big ol' huge grain of salt. But my gut feeling after living here 10 years is that the areas north of that line seem to get hit by tornadoes more often. Areas like Harvest, Capshaw, Monrovia, Meridianville, New Market, and Hazel Green seem to get a disproportionate number of mentions on the weather radio."
HuntsvilleAlabama,3dgqt2,peckrob,3,Thu Jul 16 04:28:18 2015 UTC,"Yes. I live four miles north of 72, and this at least seems to be correct, based on owning a house here five years."
HuntsvilleAlabama,3dgqt2,rlwalker1,3,Thu Jul 16 12:35:26 2015 UTC,"Well, Meridanville, Hazel Green, and New Market get mentioned because they're the ""named places"" in those parts of the county. Like anything in NE Madison county (east of Moore's Mill/Butler Road and North of Ryland Pike) will be identified as ""New Market"".  As for actual empirical tornado data, there's a nice interactive map to play around with (Madison County).  I live outside of New Market, and it's rural. If you're okay with that, then it's a wonderful place to live. Dark nights, slightly cooler than the urbs and suburbs, pretty quiet, plenty of wildlife around. I take a hike with my dog, Tammy, up in the hills every weekend and take photos.  My commute into the Arsenal is about 35 minutes, though I am an early arriver, hitting the Gate about 6 a.m.  Since I moved here we've had a Publix grocery store come in less than 15 minutes from my house, along with a slew of new eateries (to go along with established ones like New Market BBQ. A new WalMart SuperCenter is being built on Winchester Rd across from the Publix (mixed feelings on that), so it's not like you're going to be totally isolated out here.  Welcome to the area!"

HuntsvilleAlabama,3dgqt2,pfp-disciple,2,Thu Jul 16 14:08:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'd recommend renting somewhere for the first 6 months or so. Then, you can get a feel for what interests you and what might be a better fit.  Land is much cheaper out of the city (in general -- at least it used to be). You can get more house and more land for the same money.   Realize that Harvest, Monrovia, and Toney are not incorporated areas, but are very large mailing routes. Avoiding all of Harvest because of tornadoes is almost like avoiding all of Chicago because of one or two dangerous neighborhoods. I'm in my 40s, grew up near Anderson Hills and live in Harvest. I've never personally experienced tornado damage any worse that having shingles blown off ('72-ish and the '01-ish). I've been within 1-2 miles of the damage, though.   If you go outside the city, consider bottlenecks getting into/out of the city:   South (Morgan County -- Arab, etc): Have to cross the river. The bridge is occasionally down to 2 lanes for inspection, or closed due to ice, etc. East and Southeast (Hampton Cove, New Hope, etc): primary route is over Monte Sano Mountain. it is rare, but not unheard of, for the road to be severely blocked due to ice or accident North East (New Market): primary route is US72 East over Chapman Mountain. I hear this mentioned too often in the traffic reports as being blocked or slow. There are a few other routes -- basically from North North (Meridianville, Hazel Green, TN): primary route is the Parkway, but there are other well-traveled 2 lane roads. More routes west than east. North West (Harvest, Toney, Monrovia): several primary routes West and South West (Madison, Southern Harvest, Athens): primary route is US 72, several secondary routes"
HuntsvilleAlabama,3dgqt2,addywoot,3,Thu Jul 16 17:39:55 2015 UTC,"If you're outside the city (or anywhere in it, but outside in particular) be familiar and comfortable with alternate routes. If your primary route is closed due to weather or accident, know exactly how else to get in to work, or get home. And know how to get to an alternate from wherever you're getting shunted off your usual route.  An inordinate number of people ""wing it"" on whatever road is nearest to the blockage, just making it all that much worse."
HuntsvilleAlabama,3dgqt2,pfp-disciple,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:27:01 2015 UTC,"I agree. It's actually pretty easy to grasp when you are familiar with:   major roads (not that many, and most are North/South or East/West), including name changes (e.g. Johnson Rd -> Airport Rd -> Carl T. Jones -> Bailey Cove). I'd guess that knowing 10 major roads can get you around most of Huntsville.  Where the major roads intersect each other, including when one causes a disconnect with another (e.g. you can't drive across Research Park Blvd on Blake Bottom) the secondary roads that cross the major ones. A general idea helps here -- pick some long, straight ones or learn that ""Boulevards go North/South, Avenues go East/West""."

HuntsvilleAlabama,3da2id,nomadpenguin,11,Tue Jul 14 17:55:21 2015 UTC,"I'm a recent graduate of Grissom High School, and I'm very concerned about what's happening not just to my school, but the entire school system. The best teachers at Grissom are leaving one after another, and honestly, who could blame them? If I were a teacher, I would probably also move to another system where teachers are treated well and paid well.  I would say my high school career has been successful, I was part of the team that won a national cybersecurity competition, and I was admitted to a moderately prestigious college. Many of my classmates this year have also had very successful high school careers. None of this would have been possible were it not for the world-class teachers we had at Grissom. Now that they're all leaving, I fear that my class may be one of the last highly successful classes to come out of the Huntsville City School system.    What's even more troubling than the old teachers leaving is the fact that schools are having trouble finding adequate replacements. I know for a fact that Grissom has several openings in the math department, and no applicants.  In time, I believe that it will be abundantly clear that Wardinsky's policies have been a failure. As a student who has been part of the Digital 1:1 initiative for three years, I think that it has not benefited my learning experience at all. I fully support moving the classroom into the 21st century, but with all the bureaucracy and red tape involved in Digital 1:1, it feels like a step backwards. And the world's best computers and software can never, ever replace a good teacher."
HuntsvilleAlabama,3da2id,Cambot72,3,Tue Jul 14 18:15:06 2015 UTC,"Ever since Wardynski came to Huntsville, I have seen such a drop in the quality of the school. I agree with you how Grissom used to be full of some of the best teachers who had such unique ways of getting the material across to the kids. Nowadays creativity is frowned upon because of the technology Wardynski is forcing in the classrooms.   He really needs to be seen for the man he is. That won't happen until the news and media start interviewing people that are not under his arm and not being paid by him. His positive ratings are all from people who he appointed, and he needs to be fired."
HuntsvilleAlabama,3da2id,ImCompletelyAverage,5,Tue Jul 14 21:19:14 2015 UTC,"I just graduated from Huntsville High, and I can tell you that won't just happen. People need to express their concerns about him.  He got us a large surplus in our budget, sure, but he just wasted it on ""beneficial"" technology. I can tell you what it's like in those classrooms. It's a bunch of kids playing games and messing around on the internet. My GPA crashed after freshman year because of these laptops.  They require all the teachers to make sure the kids are getting onto their online textbooks, which we don't do.  Cheating became so much easier with the laptops. Copy/paste. Email. Screenshot. We used all of these and probably more for things like homework assignments."
HuntsvilleAlabama,3da2id,rlwalker1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:33:02 2015 UTC,I'm curious about why you say your GPA crashed because of the laptops?
HuntsvilleAlabama,3da2id,ImCompletelyAverage,3,Wed Jul 15 01:16:48 2015 UTC,"I consider myself a good student. I had close to a 4.0 after freshman year (I believe a 3.9 but possibly even a 4.0) but sophomore year was the year we got laptops and I almost failed math and my GPA dropped to 3.6. I ended up holding that GPA through junior year with the help of four AP classes and I graduated with a 3.5.  With this in mind, when you're sitting with the entire internet at your fingertips and hundreds of classmates to find ways around the blocking system helping you, you can do anything and waste more time than you'd ever need to. There were just more fun out exciting things that we could do."
HuntsvilleAlabama,3da2id,rlwalker1,5,Wed Jul 15 01:31:28 2015 UTC,"Understandable, and maybe that's too much freedom to give 14-15 year olds without the necessary accountability measures in place. But as a former hard-ass college instructor, I can tell you that kind of discipline is needed to succeed. Sure, students can probably get by while half-assing, but it's on the individual to actually get something of value from his or her educational opportunities. That said, maybe high school students just aren't ready for the freedom."
HuntsvilleAlabama,3da2id,ezfrag,2,Wed Jul 15 02:04:39 2015 UTC,I would probably also move to another system where teachers are treated well and paid well.   Those are called private schools.
HuntsvilleAlabama,3da2id,angryguts,2,Tue Jul 14 19:58:51 2015 UTC,"Are private school teachers paid well, compared with their public school counterparts? I always had the impression that they were not."
HuntsvilleAlabama,3da2id,ezfrag,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:06:01 2015 UTC,"Well that depends on the private school. Hardly anyone in elementary education is going to get rich and that's especially true for a school that gives a lot of scholarships (free tuition) or focuses on children that may need a more structured environment than a normal school. Other private schools are a bit more financially secure through either benefactors or higher tuition. Some of these actively compete with public systems to attract qualified tenured staff and pay considerably more. When my sister in law was teaching the mentally and socially handicapped kids at Sparkman, she was barely pulling $40k with a Masters and many extra years of training to be able to handle a 200 pound senior with an IQ of 70 and a tendency to be physically abusive to adults. When she moved to a private school in Vestavia her salary went up considerably, and now whenever she has a student with a violent streak, she has a security guard in the classroom."
HuntsvilleAlabama,3da2id,Sun_Shine_Dan,3,Tue Jul 14 22:19:29 2015 UTC,I know Randolph pays lower than Huntsville city schools and has significantly less benefits.
HuntsvilleAlabama,3da2id,ezfrag,2,Tue Jul 14 23:04:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't know of any private school in this area that matches the benefits of a public school. Madison Academy pays a little more, but without the benefits, although you do get a substantial discount on your child's tuition."

HuntsvilleAlabama,3da2id,jsuzack,3,Wed Jul 15 00:28:55 2015 UTC,"My wife and I just moved to the area. She has experience teaching in a Title I school that still does things ""the old way"", and I can tell you it is much worse.  My wife's previous school notwithstanding, technology is one of the major topics discussed during the interview process in this area, and it's not just Huntsville City making it a priority. During each of my wife's interviews at three school systems, technology was the first topic discussed. It's the way kids learn these days. They use technology all day.  It's good to see schools making tech a priority, but the IT teams aren't the ones making the decisions. I see it happen every day: vendors come in, make empty promises, and hail their technology as the second coming of Steve Jobs. By the time more technical people are involved, the check is already signed.  Many experienced teachers are leaving due to ""this is the way we've always done it"" disease. Imagine how a twenty year teaching veteran feels when they're forced to use a computer to teach. It runs a lot of them the wrong way, and they have every right to leave. On the other hand, there is a boom of young teachers in the area thanks to Jacksonville State, UAH, and others ready and waiting for a shot at teaching in one of the best school systems in he state. Technology is only as good as the person using it."

HuntsvilleAlabama,3darif,mirathi,3,Tue Jul 14 22:04:06 2015 UTC,"I have to admit one of the political failures that breaks my heart over the past few years is the high speed rail. Esp. considering that B'ham was on the first tier of builds. I get very frustrated with the runaway fiscal conservatism/faux libertarianism in the state that no one wants to spend any money on anything no matter what, with ZERO regard to any foresight of future.  The country falls behind in everything, and people wait for someone to invest in it but who's going to take care of something that refuses to take care of itself? It's very un-business like which is where they pride themselves, which confuses me. Their answer? ""We need to put more money into roads."" It's frustrating to see us falling behind in the world, only because everyone else is moving up. I bring all of that up because the more I think about it, maybe things won't be hopeless for the future and maybe catching up to people who have high speed rail and building new interstates is the wrong approach. Maybe we need to leapfrog over and beyond those ideas. So..take SkyTran. To the fiscal conservatives' credit, high speed rail often doesn't pay for itself, and will still require too much subsidization. While that doesn't bother me personally, I can see it being a tough sell, so what frustrates me is not that it's deemed economically feasible, but then all progress stops and no one even bothers. Jesus Christ we made the Saturn V. So, this SkyTran, which is supposedly remarkably cheaper (according to the link), or take Elon Musks Tube of Death thing or whatever it's called which is also supposed to be much cheaper. That would rule. And yes we could fly. But flying to to places that are so close in region..I'm just someone who's not going to do it and I can't imagine I'm alone."

It still surprises me somewhat how recently Huntsville became more than a small town, and I was born here 45+ years ago. I recall trips to Birmingham or Michigan as a kid, which involved a 30 minute drive just to get to the Interstate.   You really should read up on Huntsville's history, it's quite interesting. The primary industry was textiles (hence all the Mill villages in the area) for a long time. The Arsenal and NASA, with Dr. Werner Von Braun, started changing that profile."

Many HOAs won't provide documents to non-owners due to liability as the realtor has a basis to sue if documents are provided that cause the buyer to abandon the purchase.
HuntsvilleAlabama,3d78u8,InvaderChin,2,Tue Jul 14 17:44:07 2015 UTC,My mistake. Every subdivision we looked at provided us with a copy. And we definitely ruled a few out because of the rules (we didn't even consider Hampton Cove- we'd heard stories similar to corn guy's).

This would mean I would have to get up earlier.  Ugh."
HuntsvilleAlabama,3d2q7f,peckrob,2,Tue Jul 14 13:09:29 2015 UTC,Horribly even.
HuntsvilleAlabama,3d2q7f,Diffie-Hellman,10,Mon Jul 13 17:59:06 2015 UTC,I would seriously invest in a vehicle. Public transportation here is not great.
HuntsvilleAlabama,3d2q7f,namnit,10,Mon Jul 13 02:43:17 2015 UTC,"The question of how screwed you are largely depends on what you need to do.  If you live Downtown or in Five Points and you want to stay there (like you work from home, stay-at-home parent, etc), you're probably going to be okay for most day-to-day stuff like groceries and the like. There's a Star Market in 5 points and a Publix sorta downtown. Many things are a reasonably short bike ride away if you are in shape.  But if you need to get somewhere outside those areas, prepare to bike for hours or pay out the nose for a taxi. Taxis are amazingly expensive here and generally have to be called in advance. Supposedly Uber is coming, but I would expect their fares to be not tremendously less than taxis.  Our public transit is a joke. You might wait for an hour for a bus. Or it might never show up at all.  Live outside those areas, there's just not a realistic way to live without a car. I tried biking everywhere for awhile when I was living in an apartment off Sparkman and I was spending so much time biking everywhere that I was just drained. But I was in good shape. :)"
HuntsvilleAlabama,3d2q7f,pedanticME,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:46:00 2015 UTC,I am paraplegic and biking/walking isn't an option at all for me. Does Huntsville have good community support for the disabled?
HuntsvilleAlabama,3d2q7f,pedanticME,5,Mon Jul 13 03:28:45 2015 UTC,"Well, unfortunately, I can't answer this fully, but my guess is going to be no. At least I can't think of anything beyond Handi-Ride (PDF), but it has the same M-F 6-6 hours that our ""busses"" have. There may be some other social services that I'm not aware of, but, again, my guess would be no.   You mentioned Chicago in another post; keep in mind that metro Huntsville is about 6% the population of metro Chicago. We're still a [relatively] small city. You are just not going to find the types of services you would find in a major metropolitan area here. It's getting better, but it still has a long way to go."
HuntsvilleAlabama,3d2q7f,pedanticME,2,Mon Jul 13 03:38:40 2015 UTC,"Haha, NOTHING has the type of services that Chicago has!! Where I'm living now is about 1/3 the size of Huntsville at around twice the cost. I'm hoping the tech sector down there will have more work-from-home opportunities than available here. My mobility limitations are putting a big wall between me and a lot of opportunities."
HuntsvilleAlabama,3d2q7f,Diffie-Hellman,2,Mon Jul 13 05:00:57 2015 UTC,"Take a look at the Raleigh and research triangle areas of North Carolina, Denver, and Salt Lake City.  All of these cities are good for tech work, collect taxes from people other than the workers, and have real mass transportation.  The first two times I was in Denver, I was able to get just about everywhere by train, bus, and foot."

Bloomington is a shit city full of horrible people that lie and betray you at every turn. They're so far up IU's ass here that if it's not university related, it doesn't exist. Half of the city shuts down in the summer because there's nobody here, there is little infrastructure to connect us to the rest of the state, but they cannot exist on their own (I am having to go to a city 80 miles away to see a doctor because there aren't any here DESPITE OUR TOP-RATED MEDICAL SCHOOL).

It's gravitational pull of low cost and good employment opportunities brings a lot of ex-pats back. You will probably do a lot better in HSV.

From what I've been able to figure out, there is actually pretty great care for my particular condition in Huntsville.

There's actually pretty great neurologists in Huntsville and, yes, awesome ones in Nashville.   Plus you guys have non-stop flights to DC!!

The Bloomington skaters just acted like total assholes to me, calling me a creep, etc.  I've been refereeing for over six years now.

Huntsville, as presented to me, is an incredibly polar city - either you're a tech industry geek and part of the larger community as a whole or you're a meth head looking for someone to stab for a score."
HuntsvilleAlabama,3d2q7f,Abestar,6,Mon Jul 13 16:10:24 2015 UTC,That's totally untrue! The tribes aren't nomadic! It's more of an entrenched pastoral thing. They only travel when the drugs run dry or they run out of people to murder. Very fascinating.

I think you'll be ok ;) It's more of there are a handful of areas you probably want to avoid at night but the majority of the city is perfectly nice.

When Randolph teachers and administrators heard Neri Oxman speak at the NAIS (National Association of Independent Schools) Annual Conference this winter, they were blown away.   Oxman’s work, which includes wearable technology created from bacterial strands, combines many disciplines.  In an interview with Metropolis, Oxman described her work: “My group is concerned with nature-inspired design and design-inspired nature. We conduct research at the intersection of computational design, digital fabrication, materials, and synthetic biology and apply this knowledge across all scales, from the micro-scale to buildings. Our mission is to invent, design, and implement biologically inspired fabrication technologies that enhance the relationship between the designed object and the environment. We refer to this approach as ‘material ecology,’ and it considers computation, fabrication and matter as inseparable and harmonized dimensions of design. Our early work focused on nature as a model for computation and form-generation, while our current work looks into nature as a model for digital fabrication.”  Oxman’s talk will inspire students and adults alike. We are fortunate to bring this world-renowned mind to Huntsville to speak with the community on Thursday, August 6, at 6 PM in the Thurber Arts Center."

HuntsvilleAlabama,3csk8c,tennhioland,4,Fri Jul 10 12:50:57 2015 UTC,"I love the idea of this place, but the design feels very uninspired. I feel like there's a great opportunity to do something interesting design-wise with the exterior of this place but it just looks like a high school with a cheap metal yellowhammer building attached. It's frustratingly bland."
HuntsvilleAlabama,3csk8c,frogmaskedchild,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:23:38 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree, though I do understand the monetary constraints. At least put in some solid tech though, this is Huntsville we are talking about. We need to have more LED streetlights and LEV charging stations."
HuntsvilleAlabama,3csk8c,Xenocide321,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:15:14 2015 UTC,Same. Looks bland to me. I would love to see some big beer murals on the outside of the place at least.
HuntsvilleAlabama,3csk8c,silentmunky,2,Fri Jul 10 19:06:22 2015 UTC,"Or at least more school-inspired stuff. They took down the Stone Middle sign, which I thought was odd."
HuntsvilleAlabama,3csk8c,juez,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:05:45 2015 UTC,It would have been cool to go drinking at a place with the middle school sign up. Keeps the history around too. I like that idea.

HuntsvilleAlabama,3csk8c,apollorockit,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:37:39 2015 UTC,"They called it an ""amphitheater"" when they first announced it but quickly backed off to ""event/concert venue"" in the media reports. I think if the revenue is there they'll gladly install some tiered seating and actually make it an amphitheater, but to do it now might be a huge waste of money."
HuntsvilleAlabama,3csark,nickknight,3,Fri Jul 10 10:57:48 2015 UTC,"Yea, I'd get there at least an hour early and put your chairs out.  Then you can go wander around downtown for food/beer."

HuntsvilleAlabama,3cp8lm,omega_ix9,2,Thu Jul 9 18:00:16 2015 UTC,Most recent thing on that list was 5 months ago. Maybe it's time to rekindle the discussion?
HuntsvilleAlabama,3cp8lm,Terrific_Tyler,5,Thu Jul 9 18:17:38 2015 UTC,"Hey! I started Launch Fiber (www.launchfiber.com) in January of 2014 with the exact goal you are speaking of: to bring gigabit and beyond speeds to Huntsville and the greater Madison County area.   While this goal isn't complete, we have taken huge strides. We went from a community that wasn't even focusing on this to having a definite plan of action that has already been approved by the City Council and is currently in progress. You can read more about this here (http://www.al.com/news/huntsville/index.ssf/2015/05/huntsville_takes_first_step_to.html) and follow the other stories on AL.com's website.   The current plan is something akin to what we had in the early days of the internet. With the help of our local utility company, private third party fiber installers will locate and install fiber optics throughout Huntsville. The first customers will be commercial businesses. These installers will most likely NOT provide service, aka not be an ISP. Instead, they will then lease the use of their infrastructure to companies who DO provide service (WoW, Comcast, etc). This allows for more competition to the end user and a more open market.   With the current plan, there is a lot of room for expansion of infrastructure to the residential side. It's something I'm still pushing for, but we have to make sure the idea as a whole is solvent and makes sense before we just start installing cables and call it a day.   All in all I would say not to worry, as Huntsville and the city of Madison are taking fairly decent sized strides towards a full commercial/residential fiber optic network that allows customers to pick and choose who they wish to purchase service from. The reason Huntsville is not on the list you posted is because the city is not interested in owning the infrastructure or providing service. They are facilitating the growth of the technology by easier access to poles, some funds, and access to city resources but not taking on the large burden of debt that comes with a multi million dollar infrastructure project like this.   If you have any questions I would be happy to answer them as best I can, or forward them on to Harrison Diamond, the city's business director and the frontman for this project.  (Disclaimer: I do not work for the City or County. I am just a tax paying citizen who wanted better internet here in Huntsville.)"

HuntsvilleAlabama,3cp3yb,apollorockit,3,Thu Jul 9 17:15:33 2015 UTC,I would think drinking and biking is a DUI risk?
HuntsvilleAlabama,3cp3yb,silentmunky,2,Thu Jul 9 18:45:06 2015 UTC,"Can confirm: Almost got a DUI a couple of years back while cruising downtown on my bike with friends. Granted, I attracted the unwanted attention of the police officer by being an asshole by blasting through a red light and flying down a one-way street.  It is a legit law. They will take you to jail. Most of the time they don't though."
HuntsvilleAlabama,3cp3yb,jrennat,2,Thu Jul 9 19:20:21 2015 UTC,"I had a friend get a DUI on a bicycle in Auburn, so it does happen!"
HuntsvilleAlabama,3cp3yb,silentmunky,2,Thu Jul 9 19:33:57 2015 UTC,"When I almost got mine it was quite embarrassing. It was right in front of the 'Klatch where we had all been sitting outside drinking. The cop had been right up the street watching us drink but really didn't care one way or the other about us. It was Friday night and he was looking for drunks coming out of the clubs.  But, yeah, all my friends still sitting at the table drinking and laughing while I sat on the curb and the cop called me in to see if I had any outstandings."
HuntsvilleAlabama,3cp3yb,jrennat,2,Thu Jul 9 19:39:37 2015 UTC,Happens to us all! At least you have a story about being embarrassed and not about getting a career hurting DUI.
HuntsvilleAlabama,3cp3yb,silentmunky,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:45:00 2015 UTC,I was wondering about this...
HuntsvilleAlabama,3cp3yb,juez,2,Thu Jul 9 19:12:24 2015 UTC,"It's only illegal if you're bicycling drunk, y'all. Having a couple of beers won't put most people over the legal limit. If you know your limitations and plan a little you can be sure not to put yourself in a bad situation. That said, the cops have much better things to do than bother a bunch of people bicycling around downtown."

HuntsvilleAlabama,3cp3yb,jrennat,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:54:19 2015 UTC,Have gone to this many times. Ben does a great job of coordinating everything and calls ahead to any food stops to reserve pitchers/pizza and whatnot. No cops have ever given us any trouble about DUI or anything.. I guess they assume you can only hurt yourself.
HuntsvilleAlabama,3cp3yb,HelpMeOB,2,Thu Jul 9 19:14:02 2015 UTC,No cops have ever given us any trouble about DUI or anything...   It's mainly because you guys and girls aren't riding around being dicks and dickettes.

HuntsvilleAlabama,3cp3yb,GeeEazy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:49:21 2015 UTC,"The cops know about it already, believe me. They had close to 50 people biking around downtown between various venues. It ain't exactly inconspicuous."

I've also wanted to check out the pond by the YMCA on Hughes though I'm not sure who owns it or if it is open to all. I usually head to Mooresville and fish from the old bridge on Hwy 20 (1st bridge only, second one is gay cruising spot) or head down to the Tennessee River in Mooresville via dirt roads."
