The creators did this so years down the line people would say ""Whatever happened to 'Whatever Happened to Robot Jones'."" It was planned failure to make a cheap joke. The only thing I remember from that show was the episode where the switched the stickers on the Rubix cube, rendering it unsolvable.  Also, while I'm here, I gotta say that the last episode of ""Ed, Edd, and Eddy"" made me really sad. Sure, everyone is friends now, but what about Johnny. He's still an outcast, and now everyone likes him even less. Still messes me up sometimes to think about that.  I feel too strongly about all those cartoons.

It sometimes seemed that he was just going along with what Plank wanted.  I don't know. Maybe I just really connect with Johnny because we both share a name, and neither of us were really well liked by other kids when we were little. Let's just say that Johnny's ending hit really close to home for me."

lewronggeneration,3dy7tb,WakaIsMyWaifu,13,Mon Jul 20 22:07:02 2015 UTC,Black ops 1 was my favorite cod and still is
lewronggeneration,3dy7tb,bodnast,6,Tue Jul 21 01:14:33 2015 UTC,"yep, me too  MW1 is a close second"
lewronggeneration,3dy7tb,WakaIsMyWaifu,4,Tue Jul 21 01:15:35 2015 UTC,What about World at War tho
lewronggeneration,3dy7tb,kaiser_jim,11,Tue Jul 21 01:57:27 2015 UTC,I loved the gore and the brutal campaign on veteran. Multi-player I wasn't very good at but I loved the dark atmosphere
lewronggeneration,3dy7tb,bodnast,3,Tue Jul 21 02:08:23 2015 UTC,Fuck those grenades though.
lewronggeneration,3dy7tb,DeVitoMcCool,5,Tue Jul 21 15:14:39 2015 UTC,Only the zombies and the campaign to an extent. Multiplayer is shit compared to Modern Warfare 2 in its glory days.

lewronggeneration,3dy7tb,WakaIsMyWaifu,6,Mon Jul 20 22:55:30 2015 UTC,I thought it was a lot better than Modern Warfare in most regards. More loadout customization (weapons and kill streaks). You could also upgrade perks by using them more. The maps were worse than the Modern Warfare maps in my opinion.

lewronggeneration,3dy7tb,Telust,4,Mon Jul 20 21:44:56 2015 UTC,I loved that multiplayer so much and it'd never been the same for me. Although maybe it has something to do with how much of a tweaker I was back then.

Blind Guardian is basically the same thematic style as Dragonforce (singing about knights and warriors and fantasy stuff) but a lot more talented (imo) and with a much grander feel to their music. Alestorm are guys that sing really catchy stuff about pirates, their songs are great fun to sing with your friends.   Here's my two favourite songs by each of them  Blind Guardian:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MLmdm3nKIs  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWeeV7N3vDM  Alestorm:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta-Z_psXODw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ef6i9P7y3Y  If you're looking for something a bit more mellow and calm but still in the power metal genre i'd also recommend Sonata Arctica.

Can you imagine how people would react if every Xbox One or PS4 didn't read the disks 1/3 of the time?

One of the main issues is reducing some cultural aspect to a caricature. For instance some extravagant man-buns are pretty hard to characterize that way because binding long male hair is hardly confined to one culture or time period. I might be biased though, of course, because I do it myself. Reminds me of how my girlfriend sent me this: http://plasticbag.tk/post/123326145749/why-do-you-wear-man-buns-dont-you-now-that-its  I do think that it's important to know about stuff before you execute it though, because it becomes a bit to easy to dilute something. But I'd also like to see some free expression. So it's hard for me to say, it really depends. I tend to be pretty skeptical and side eye a lot of people who are reactionary to ""political correctness,"" as they seem to commonly like to talk about ""feminazis"" and shit too, but I don't think for a second that there isn't bad thinking on the other side, too.

If ""boring"" and ""mediocre"" are the only charges you've got to level against a film, that reads to me as a failure to engage with the film on a meaningful level.  And Lucy is fucking great.

lewronggeneration,3dtnzy,Pperson25,3,Sun Jul 19 17:42:35 2015 UTC,"Well some foreign words have to be stressed so that they can be properly enunciated so it's usually appropriate not to form a contraction in this situation.  It goes the same for ordinary French words that begin with ""h"", which is also considered sometimes a vowel. You have words like ""heure"" (hour) that use a contraction, ""l'heure,"" And then there's the adjective ""haut"" (high) that doesn't use a contraction, like in ""La haute couture"" (High fashion). Another comparison would be ""le hockey"" (hockey) And ""l'hôpital"" (hospital)."
lewronggeneration,3dtnzy,arnivold86,2,Sun Jul 19 14:24:08 2015 UTC,"There's a funny story about the ""h"" in French. In French the male and female forms of ""Hero"" are ""héro"" and ""héroïne"".   With ""les"" before ""héroïne"" you accord the sounds, so you hear the ""z"" sound well.  But with ""les héros"" you have no accord, you have to leave a space between both words. This is because ""les héros"" with the accord sounds like ""les zéros"", which means ""the zeros"" or ""the losers"".   Source: Karambolage, Arte"

lewronggeneration,3ds49a,Burial4TetThomYorke,30,Sat Jul 18 22:55:22 2015 UTC,"Here's the Urban Dictionary definition of shag bands :      It is true that Shagbands or Jelly Bracelets used to be an 80’s fashion. However, they weren’t the original fuck bracelets. Originally fuck bracelets were bracelets with teeny tiny little beads and thin elastic string. The rumours about breaking them and the person has to have sex with you started floating around when I was thirteen. I’m about 17 now. They were much easier to break than jelly bracelets. Somewhere along the line Jelly bracelets began to come back into style. When this happened they became known as shagbands or fuck bracelets. What many of you are failing to realize is everyone just took it as a joke. No one actually believes that if they break someone’s black band that, that person has to have sex with them. That’s ridiculous and stupid. However there is a meaning behind each of the different colors and people do jokingly try to break them a lot. Most of the time when it happens to me (I have about 80 of these things) it’s just one of my friends kidding around.  Black- Sex  Blue- Blow job  Pink- Flash tits or penis  Yellow- Hug  Purple- Kiss  Clear- Whatever the snapper wants  Green- Hand job  Brown- Toss my salad  Glow in the dark- SEX TOYS  Any glitter- Girl chooses  Silver(Gray)- OUTDOOR SEX  Light Blue- Anal  Light pink- hug and kiss  Light green- Oral sex  Gold- All of the above  Those are the meanings of the different colors. But in reality, it’s just a fashion statement.  So, I’ve done a bit of a search on the web and found the cheapest place to buy them online. time-bomb.co.uk has got packs of 6 for 75p – colours including glitter, neon and UV.     Girl: Hey! You broke my shag bands!  Guy: oops sorry. Hey! That means we have to have sex now!  Girl: (sarcastically) Oh yea baby!  Guy: Haha  Girl: Wanna go right now?  Guy: Seriously?  Girl: No you dumbass I was joking  Guy: Uh.. yea, I.. uh… I was too.  Girl: Riiiight  ::girl walks off::    about | flag for glitch | Summon: urbanbot, what is something?"

My system isn't good enough for me to be able to tell the difference between that and lossless. If you're an audiophile and have the dopest headphones and an amp, you may notice the difference if you haven't damaged your hearing with loud music already.  2nd edit: shit this ESL CSGO stream is on break forever. I'll just write up a short explanation. Digital audio requires that the sound wave be chopped up into tiny bits that can be stored and transmitted digitally, because digital hardware cannot accommodate smooth analogue values. Lossless is the closest you can get, which is basically so good that a human could never tell the difference and you could probably perfectly reconstruct the analogue signal (the raw sound wave pattern as recorded without use of computers, because digital limitations) using a FLAC file. But basically old shit was never recorded using computers. It was done on wax, then on magnetic tape. The full wave form was preserved and reproduced during playback. If you're interested in this stuff, I would heavily encourage you to take an online class in basic audio production. If they don't go over these differences in the foundational elements of the field, the course is wack."

lewronggeneration,3dt1oh,vlad_the_redditor,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:21:22 2015 UTC,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter  ""The conversion involves quantization of the input, so it necessarily introduces a small amount of error. Instead of doing a single conversion, an ADC often performs the conversions (""samples"" the input) periodically. The result is a sequence of digital values that have been converted from a continuous-time and continuous-amplitude analog signal to a discrete-time and discrete-amplitude digital signal."" These discrete values are true of any digital file format that has a real life analogue version. This is why many movie theatres and IMAX theatres still use film reels. Sure most films are digitally manipulated and digitally printed, but there are still many film makers that would shit a brick if their film was digitized before being shown to a theatre audience."
lewronggeneration,3dt1oh,shepdozejr,2,Sun Jul 19 09:33:26 2015 UTC,"Analog music is continuous, meaning no matter how accurately you measure it there is always more detail that you can't measure. Digital music is discrete, meaning that it is only as good as the rate of which it sampled (sample rate) and how much data is stored on each sample (bit depth).    CD quality audio has a sample rate of 44100 Hz. This is generally considered the minimum amount needed for the human ear to not notice artifacts in the audio. The bit depth of CD quality audio is 16 bit. Bit Depth is less important than sample rate as increasing bit depth only lowers the noise floor of the audio.    watch this  https://www.xiph.org/video/vid2.shtml"

lewronggeneration,3dt1oh,-THE_BIG_BOSS-,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:44:23 2015 UTC,"What headphones are you using? Do you have an amp? Do you have a history of listening to loud music? Do you listen to ""overly"" produced music, with lots of amplitude compressors? These will all factor into being able to audibly tell the difference. One thing you will not consciously notice is the fatigue or lack thereof that comes from listening to higher bitrate formats. Your brain actually has to try to fill in the gaps in sound, much like it does for your vision, to create a cohesive experience."

lewronggeneration,3dmvzv,mcsuperawesome,0,Fri Jul 17 22:58:00 2015 UTC,"Anybody feel free to correct me if I'm wrong because I'm far from a historian, but didn't that wealth growth end up centralized among the wealthy elite once the 30s came around? In the 20s work was widely available so the lower to mid classes made decent wages, but as I understand it once the depression came around all those paycheck to paycheck or barely above workers were completely fucked, and the wealthy didn't really give a shit. Seems similar to the growing wealth disparity we're seeing now.  If you lived in the 20s with absolutely no idea of what was to come sure it might've seemed great, but looking back on it how you could ever feel that was a good time to live makes no sense. Also the complete lack of good labour laws to protect you in case of injury or other personal issues preventing you to work, and the ignorance of mental health issues meant you just had to grin and bear it at all times if you had any hope of supporting your family.  But no, the admittedly good looking but incredibly conformist (and for women, often very oppressive) fashion trends of the time totally make it the greatest era to live in ever.

lewronggeneration,3doewo,Burot,10,Sat Jul 18 01:49:52 2015 UTC,"This video gives the impression that its creator is nothing but a bitter old man upset that people now expect meaningful statements from their art, instead of just technical skill. The real reason modern art is the way it is? I would argue it's because the ability to be technically skilled in a medium ceaced to be exceptional. back in the days of the Renaissance, the great masters such as Micaelangelo, Raphael were noted for being more technically skilled that their contemporaries, making their paintings noteworthy simply for how well they were made. Now, with entire schools dedicated to teaching art and people who derive their entire livelihoods from it, skills on par with the old masters are no longer unheard of. There are probably many painters living in the world now who are as skilled as DaVinci or Titian. Simply having the ability to make art that is good from a technical perspective is no longer valued because it is no longer unique. People value fresh statements and emotinal reactions in/from art now, because ""Wow this guy is good at schulpting"" is no longer enough of a reaction to make an artist famous. Of course, this is mostly conjecture. I am not an Art History major, so I may have just written a paragraph of bullshit."
lewronggeneration,3doewo,Logic_Nuke,4,Sat Jul 18 04:17:30 2015 UTC,"Also the inability to mass produce art back in the day was a huge fctor, if you wanted a painting you'd have to commission someone to paint it for you, so it was your skill at delivering what your client was asking for that mattered, rather than producing something of your own creativity"
lewronggeneration,3doewo,farazormal,2,Sat Jul 18 05:21:09 2015 UTC,"I actually feel like you might be on to something with that. However, some of the examples brought up in the vid I would not consider ""fresh statements"" worthy of value. Like what's valuable about the canvas painted white, the rock, or the person pissing. It just comes off as 3deep5u which the guy proved with that example with his students. The students probably had no idea what was valuable about it so they had to just force themselves to look so deep that they ended up just making things up. IMO if nothing else art doesn't need an overtly obvious message but it should be more direct than that and not based on shock value."
lewronggeneration,3doewo,Aurorx,8,Sat Jul 18 05:12:23 2015 UTC,"Like what's valuable about the canvas painted white, the rock, or the person pissing.   We could probably answer that question for ourselves had the video's creator been slightly less intellectually dishonest and provided us with some context or even bothered to describe them fully.  For example, ""the rock"" is actually called Levitated Mass and consists of much more than just a rock.  The rock itself is the most prominent piece of a 2.5 acre installation.  It is perched on the edges of a 456-foot long, 15 foot deep trench through which visitors can walk.  Now maybe that still doesn't appeal to you, but I think we can at least admit that's considerably more interesting than ""just a rock.""  Referring to it as such is about as fair as referring to a Monet as ""just some paint.""  The same likely goes for the other works.  A white canvas isn't terribly interesting in and of itself, but it could become interesting in the right context.  That kind of contextual sensitivity tends to be a big part of modern art in general."
lewronggeneration,3doewo,BearlyBreathing,6,Sat Jul 18 06:32:52 2015 UTC,"Other people have said there is something on the white canvas, but you can't see it because it's the same shade of white as the canvas. I have no idea what's on it since I've never seen it in person.  It reminds me of stuff I made in an ancient social software called Active Worlds. It started in 1995 and still has about 20 people still using it, and the last feature they added was probably 10+ years ago. The controls are absolutely terrible in every possible way. The main world is a massive world where anybody can build anything anywhere they want, so you can teleport to random spots and just wander around looking at stuff that was made 15 years ago, you can even see their username and the exact day and time they added the object to the world.  Me and some fellow goons from Something Awful set up shop somewhere back in 2001/2002, and I just made tons of stuff. I even downloaded a bot so I could play midi songs, change lights, and change pictures in my weird ass house. My main home had tons of random angles, pictures, and windows all over simply because everybody else was just making stuff that could exist in the real world. As a bonus, the whole thing was elevated for no particular reason. Then I decided to try out different things. I had a giant glass room, a bunch of 3D triangles, a great wall of Active Worlds, and who knows what else I forgot about.  Viewed alone, it looks like some idiot spammed a bunch of objects (object spamming was very easy, select as many objects as you want and then a single key combo duplicates everything you selected), but when you see all of them you'll see I was trying a bunch of different things. Without the bot, my house is now just a weird house. My farm of 3D triangles looks like I just copy spammed them. Whenever Active Worlds eventually dies, all evidence of my stuff will be gone forever, right now there is no possible way anybody will ever find it any way. Even screenshots or video won't show how it actually was. To be fair though, I am an idiot."

lewronggeneration,3djbp9,mattwan,13,Thu Jul 16 19:18:44 2015 UTC,"I graduated high school in 1992 and so was in the prime demographic for grunge, and I think the best way to put it is that grunge was more talked about than listened to.   It's a lot like the classic rock era of the 60s, I think--when you go back and look at what actually topped the Billboard charts, it doesn't really match up well with what we think of the era. Like, 1967 contained the Summer of Love, but would you even begin to guess that by looking at the year-end top 10?  It's also worth mentioning that a lot of singles that at the time were considered ""post-grunge"" had some success through the mid-90s, mostly one- or two-hit wonders like The Toadies and bands with slightly more success like Bush."
lewronggeneration,3djbp9,Rockworm503,5,Thu Jul 16 20:04:36 2015 UTC,Alice in Chains will always have a place in my heart.  Other than that I don't much care for grunge anymore.  Especially when it spawned Nickleback.
lewronggeneration,3djbp9,sleepyslim,4,Thu Jul 16 20:54:00 2015 UTC,"Those were just the top bands. There was an infinite stream of me-too-grunge-bands that have been all but forgotten. Every label was looking for their own Nirvana.  The overly commercial pop music didn't really start taking over until the late 90's. I'd say Britney's ""One More Time"" was probably the major turning point."
lewronggeneration,3djbp9,BrewingHeavyWeather,3,Fri Jul 17 13:30:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but that is part of what killed it. Just like at any time, not everyone listened to pop music, and other scenes were and are huge, just not dominated by a small number of high-revenue acts. Its mainstream success was also what it couldn't handle (not being average commercial crap was part of what made everyone pay attention, and being from a somewhat musically isolated area is what allowed it to sound different). Once the ones who had success and didn't kill themselves changed from their success, and everyone else started fuzzing their guitars like that, what was left that was special?  If you were a rocker at the time, from the time somebody you knew made you buy Bleach, to the commercialization, to Cobain's death*, it was a big thing. How it compared to what most in the top 10 at the time were doing, who knows? Aside from assuming that Michael Jackson and Madonna had some hits at the time, I couldn't tell you who was raking in the most money and listeners. Practically everyone I knew, and at least one of their parents (IE, fathers), if not both, were in on this, and not, ""top 40.""  In general, if anything rock-related goes above 50 on the top 100, that's a big deal.  * Not that this single-handedly changed everything, but I think it was a moment that hastened what would otherwise have been a more gradual diminishing attention being paid to the follow-ons, and made the, ""butt rock,"" just that much more annoying."

I know your mind is clouded by what losers on the Internet say but there is absolutely such thing as wanting to be with someone and them not reciprocating those feelings while they stay friends. No. No one deserves to have sex cause they are nice. A lot of people aren't saying that. They are just acknowledging the relationship status.

lewronggeneration,3dfnk1,PHAT_BOOTY,10,Sun Jul 19 23:02:33 2015 UTC,"But isn't it real? I mean like, if like a guy and a girl grew up together since very early childhood, then the guy falls in love with the girl but she only sees him as a friend, isn't he in ""the friendzone?"" Because all he'll ever be is a friend, no matter how good he looks or rich he gets. Their relationship is platonic because of the circumstances of how it came to be.   Or if a guy meets a girl and they start talking and become friends, if that guy asks her out years after they've been friends, she'll probably say no because he's moved into the ""just a friend"" category. If you're friends with someone for a really long time, you can't jump into a relationship with them, ergo you're in ""the friendzone"" because you'll only ever be friends."
lewronggeneration,3dfnk1,onlyonebread,58,Sun Jul 19 23:17:43 2015 UTC,"If someone doesn't like their friend in a romantic way, they're just not attracted to them. There is no reason to suggest that the reason they are not attracted is because of a friendship. There are plenty of friends who fall in love with each other. Rejecting someone because you're friends is just nicer than saying Im not attracted to you."

lewronggeneration,3dfnk1,deHavillandDash8Q400,18,Thu Jul 16 11:47:34 2015 UTC,"What ""friendzone"" means to most is something along the lines of ""aww shit now I have to be her FRIEND"" when they just wanted sex the whole time  Because if they cared about anything other than sex they wouldn't be so le forever alone about the fact that someone actually might not want to touch their dick and just wants to be friends with them  Normal adults don't think or act that way. But people who throw around terms like ""friendzone"" are not exactly normal or mature. Most people actually do not find this sort of mopey and defeatist attitude towards relationships to be particularly attractive or desirable in the least"

There's no reason to assume that for those guys whining about the ""friendzone"" it must be about sex and that they couldn't actually romantically be in love with the girl and hate the fact that she's not in love with them, regardless of sex. When you're in love with someone you want to spend lots of time with them in general. However, the ""friendzoning"" girl isn't in love with them so isn't interested in that, which they're le forever alone about. Basic concept of unrequited love."

lewronggeneration,3df2bz,Gemuese11,60,Wed Jul 15 23:29:12 2015 UTC,"Believe it or not, the infamous ""I'm the goddamn Batman"" scene isn't even close to the worst part of All-Star Batman and Robin. Here are some of the other lovely moments:   Dick Grayson insistently being referred to as ""Dick Grayson, Age 12.""  Two straight issues of Batman and the newly-kidnapped Dick Grayson driving to the Batcave  Characters calling the Batmobile's name ""totally queer,"" which eventually leads to Batman saying ""I'm the goddamn Batman and I'll call my goddamn Batmobile whatever I want!""  Speaking of which, that famous scene isn't even close to the only time he's called the goddamn Batman. In fact, while I haven't bothered counting I'm willing to be he's called the goddamn Batman more than he is just plain Batman.  And Batgirl calls herself ""the fucking Batgirl,"" which DC helpfully censored with the flimsiest black bar in the world. On the bright side, Batgirl's not around long enough for this nickname to catch on.  Batman kidnapping Green Lantern and taking him to a building that Dick Grayson spent eight hours meticulously painting every single thing yellow.  Alfred giving the newly-kidnapped Dick Grayson a cheeseburger, causing Batman to scold Alfred and demand Dick hunt and eat rats instead like he did when he was Dick's age. Alfred reminds Batman that he chose to eat rats and Dick shouldn't be forced.  Wonder Woman turning into babby's first Anita Sarkeesian caricature.  Black Canary being a sociopath who beats people up and steals their stuff. Heroically, you see. Batman punishes her by making out with her and reminding her not to make fun of the Batmobile's name.  In fact, none of the superheroes are particularly heroic at all. They're all either lunatics or, in Superman and Green Lantern's case, fucking idiots. At least Miller had the decency not to butcher Plastic Man during his brief scene.  The Joker having sex with an attorney, showing off the huge dragon tattooed on his back.  Dick Grayson asking Batman why there's a giant T-Rex in the Batcave. Supposedly if the series continued the big payoff at the end would be finally learning where the T-Rex came from, even though WE ALREADY FUCKING KNOW THAT.   Point is, it's a terrible comic."

I only ever heard of Frank Miller when I looked up Batman stuff and only knew his name in connection to The Dark Knight Returns graphic novel, which I coincidentally have sitting  besides me right now.  But to get to the point: what has he done since he is considered insane?"
lewronggeneration,3df2bz,Dotaguythemanthegame,23,Thu Jul 16 02:07:42 2015 UTC,"Back in the 80s and 90s he was known for creating some of the greatest comics of all time, such as The Dark Knight Returns, Batman:Year One, and Sin City. These books were revolutionary at the time, sparking a new wave of grittier and darker comic books.Later, in the 2000s he made Allstar Batman and Robin, which is know as a hilariously bad version of the batman character. He also made holy terror for a different publisher which is shown in the post, know as one of the worst graphic novels of all time. Frank Miller is one of the few things you can accurately say plummeted in quality in modern times."

Sure, he was a Stull hateful asshole, but we're talking about a world where the president said as long as AIDS was limited to the gay population, the problem would solve itself, and it's a sort of presentism to go back and condemn him.   However, he's not only stayed a hateful asshole, but he's gotten more vocal about it while pretty much everything he's produced in the last 15 years has been utter dreck.   He's another one of the creative casualties of 9/11, if you ask me."
lewronggeneration,3df2bz,bushiz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:37:04 2015 UTC,Frank Miller was absolutely a creative casualty of 9/11. You can palpably see it in his work and the stuff he started to say. He was working on The Dark Knight Strikes Again in 2001 and you can actually see a massive dip in art quality where he started to go spare after the attacks. It emotionally broke him and he clearly still hasn't moved past how upset he was when it happened.
lewronggeneration,3df2bz,akkahwoop,14,Fri Jul 17 06:39:27 2015 UTC,"A lot of his work has been criticized as misogynistic and homophobic by a lot of people, Sin City was a particular target of these claims. He's also seen as kind of racist and full of a lot of hate speech, people tend to point to 300 as being guilty of this, even thought people still love it they don't agree with some of the messages he seems to bring out in some of his work. Alongside this he has just flat out gone down in terms of quality in recent years, All Star Batman and Robin was flat out atrocious, he completely butchered the character of Batman (he was a sadistic bastard who literally abused the first Robin Dick Grayson both physically and mentally and took pleasure in thinking about the injuries he causes). Ironically the other well known series from the All Star run was All Star Superman, which is considered to be among the best Superman comics of all time. He was very influential with TDKR, his work with Daredevil and Sin City as well, but he's just not a good guy really and in recent years hasn't done anything of note to justify how great some people think he is."
lewronggeneration,3df2bz,KyleRaynerGotSweg,7,Thu Jul 16 02:37:04 2015 UTC,"Tl;dr Made some great contributions to art style and ""gritty"" era of superhero comics, while peddling a lot of weird bigotry. Lots of gross comments about gay and Middle-Eastern people in particular, constantly depicting women and disabled people badly, etc. Absolutely refused to answer any questions about this stuff when he did an AMA.  Apparently has missed the memo that all the groups he hates do, in fact, read comics. Personally, I think his art contributions - especially for Sin City and Daredevil - are ahhmazing and widely influential. It's easy to trash his gritty stuff in hindsight, but all that aside... he's a garbage person who's turned into a hateful, bitter old man. Kind of telling that, anecdotally, a lot of other comics creators don't want to work with him anymore."

Lots of the time, characters follow other characters simply because thats what the story says they SHOULD do, and for no other reason but that. For instance, in Allstar Batman and Robin Batman is shown as a psychotic, immature, kidnapper who we're supposed to root for simply on the basis that everyone else is."

lewronggeneration,3df2bz,helperoni,3,Wed Jul 15 19:49:30 2015 UTC,"Ehhh, this one is both right and wrong.   See, when you use the 'Batman used guns' argument to discredit people who are uncomfortable with how sadistic he has been portrayed since TDKR, you're referencing a time when comic book writing was very different from how it is today. That was back in he fucking Golden Age where the concept of 'canon' itself was completely alien and Batman using guns is just the tip of the iceberg (In the beginning, Superman couldn't fly, he used to just be able to bounce really high). Basically, you're referring to stuff that, for all intents and purposes, has been written out of the lore and doesn't count anymore, period; there's a reason Crisis on Infinite Earths had to happen, after all.  As for Miller's influence on Bats (Something that HAS persisted since TDKR's original publication)... that I'm more inclined to agree with. I guess I can appreciate what Miller's is trying to do, but I still think that story is the most overrated comic book of all time, and that its enduring legacy is trends that should have died already, and Miller's, admittedly, excellent art.   Straight up, I think it's a joke when people say it's the best thing DC has ever published, and when people say things like: 'Batman represented everything wrong with comics before that story and Miller saved him,' I want to face-palm so hard it would make the Tsar Bomba look like a firecracker.  But, that's just my opinion, man."

All that said it's a terrible reprisintation of batman,cool concept just like red son is also one of my favorite but not a great example of how the character actually acts.

As for the Kanye Defence Force, I can't really comment, because I haven't been active on Reddit for over a year. However I've always been a fan of Kanye's music, although I thought Yeezus wasn't as top as he could have been (my order is personally MBDTF > TCD > LR > Y > G > 808s).  Personally, I would rather go for defeners who oppose his music who didn't listen to his diverse discography or attack using baseless claims and ignorance, rather than oppose everyone who doesn't like Kanye. There is a large difference between defening and criticism."

lewronggeneration,3dfp9u,Rockworm503,9,Wed Jul 15 23:55:34 2015 UTC,"According to a lot of your older comments and stuff you seem fairly anti feminist which many of the people on here are. What are your opinions on feminism?  If the average person on here rants about ""SJWs"" they will be called out and probably down voted, If you still hold those opinions do you believe that you will be called out and down voted?  Also what do you think of America?"
lewronggeneration,3dfp9u,quicksilver991,34,Wed Jul 15 23:58:07 2015 UTC,"Very good you brought that up! I'm not anti-feminist, never was. I was indeed an avid poster in /r/TumblrInAction, which is where you understandingly might have picked that up. Interestingly, a while ago /r/lewronggeneration was targeted by reactionaries, apparently we were ""cucks"" or something.  Back in 2013, the terminology of ""SJW"" was much different than now. It referred to those on the far left whose actions were very zealous. These include: TERFs, proponents of otherkin, anti-porn radicals, and others. Those who would unironically say ""I hate white men"" and stick by it. These were fringe communities that I posted on /r/TiA because I believed that they lessened or misunderstood the purpose of actual social justice, not because I was anti-social justice.  However, somewhere along the line (I personally blame GamerGate and the CancelColbert drama), almost everything feminist or social justice was considered ""SJW"". I noticed that /r/TumblrInAction was populated by more reactionary people but I didn't mind since I just sticked to the content. Eventually, nobody there seemed to understand that SJWs were a FRINGE ASPECT and didn't rule the goddamn world. So, to answer your question, no, I don't share the thoughts of TiA nowadays, and I don't call things SJW because of its now known terminology.  I was friends with the main creator of /r/TumblrInAction, /u/EvilFuckingSociopath, who deleted his account in mid-2014? and recently came back and expressed his distaste for the subreddit as it was. You can read his thoughts here, which I agree with almost 100%."
lewronggeneration,3dfp9u,mPORTZER,8,Thu Jul 16 00:12:31 2015 UTC,"Sounds a bit like my feelings on that sub. I used to be a constant poster, but I had to stop because they're just so awful at times. They treat SJWs like some horrible boogeyman now, and it seems to be a label attached to anybody who supports feminism or anything that might suggest that you believe in an uneven power balance.    I realized I was done after that woman brought her mattress onstage at graduation as a statement about her sexual assault. I could only handle so many ""the guy says she made it up, so she must be doing this for attention!"" posts."

While I rarely post now, and was never a big contributor to begin with, I am the 'founder' of r/lewronggeneration (I'm sure I created the sub a nanosecond before someone else would have) and have top-level control of the moderators, and things of that nature. It is therefore my privilege to 'own' this sub-reddit (insofar as that means anything), and I intend to keep it totally free and open, and lacking in any kind of classic moderation. As you can imagine, there has been tremendous pressure to restrict the content that can be posted here, and restrict the people who can post here; to the extent that I don't even read my inbox anymore. Some cool changes have been made to the sub - none by me. I wish I knew exactly who to give the credit to, but there are also some I may not necessarily agree with (and I won't jump the gun right now, I'll do some research). What I want to put across is that my intent is to keep this sub free and open. If at any point it is no longer that, let it be known and I will act. We have something really special here - and it's so, so very easy for it to get fucked up. The tiniest of changes could irreparably damage what this sub is meant to be. Again: free and open. Many of us know just how important those virtues are. r/lewronggeneration has been made to be the black sheep of reddit. Heck, the black sheep of the internet. People are doing a good job with that. But so long as I have my account here, we will sacrifice no freedoms. I am confident that if any are given away, they'll never be given back. I've said far too much - I'm tired. I'm trying to convey a very simple point. Goodnight!"
