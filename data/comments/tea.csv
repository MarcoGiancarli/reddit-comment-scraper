Scott was very helpful to me a few years ago when I first started getting into puer, and still is today through the monthly tea club and the occasional restocking order. :) As a fellow small business owner with an online store (not tea-related) it was also interesting to hear about his experiences in that realm as well."

tea,3e2d4n,Triweb,5,Tue Jul 21 12:40:32 2015 UTC,"Hey there, it depends on which sort of tea it is. If its Green, White, or a green oolong it should remain good for about a year. If its its anything else it will remain good for a couple of years. However, once a package is open it will only remain 'top' for a couple of weeks. Hope this helps, Valleyoftea"
tea,3e2d4n,ValleyofTea,6,Tue Jul 21 13:06:13 2015 UTC,I respectfully disagree with white teas lasting a year - I prefer to let my White Peony and Silver Needles age for 1 year before drinking them. They develop good character when stored properly.

tea,3e2d4n,GoodGoyimGreg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:40:11 2015 UTC,"Double-walled, double-lidded air-tight tins.  Consistent humidity and temperature as well."
tea,3e2d4n,Biluochun,4,Tue Jul 21 19:20:06 2015 UTC,"It really depends on your climate. I've had teas last awhile since I'm in a dry climate. If you are in say, humid Florida, your tea shelf life will be shorter. Rule of thumb is a year or two. Over time (and climate may influence) your tea will get stale. You'll know it's bad when it smells off or lost flavor.   Tin is optimal for air tight and no light damage.   As always, don't get suckered into buying more than 50g/2oz + when trying new teas, even if it's a deal. So many tea shops like pushing new people to buy a large amount than samples, and if you hate it that's a lot of tea to get through and will just go bad."

tea,3e2wmu,forgottendinosaur,2,Tue Jul 21 15:25:55 2015 UTC,"Short version: no, it's not sacred. The form isn't rigid. However, there's many different substyles to the brewing. Spilling some tea in some gongfu cha practices actually helps to spread aroma. But it depends on your teaware. If I were using a clay or fired tray for example, I may choose to be more careless in good company because that way, I can season my tray. However, if I'm using a chabu (tea mat), I wouldn't want to spill tea and ruin the cloth so I would be more careful."
tea,3e2wmu,Knjitea,2,Tue Jul 21 15:56:44 2015 UTC,"However a key thing here is ""carelessness"". You should be mindful of your practice to train the best form suited to your style of making tea. This means practicing movements over and over until they are second nature and you don't spill as much. You should pour as much as is needed to make the best possible cup given your circumstances (a little bit less leaf, humidity, etc.) You also should try draining ever last drop because any remaining liquid will affect taste. Just be mindful! :)"

It provides a fresh, slightly sweeter taste to most teas compared if you poured the brew over ice.  The way I cold brew is I just use mason jars, dump tea and water in them and throw them in the fridge from 4-18 hours, then I just strain them into the tumbler and take it with me! I usually don't do 24 hours because im impatient.  Cold-brewing tastes have always felt more refreshing to me in the summer time!"

Some teas taste better with the ""hot"" method, some with the "" cold"". You should try out both to see which works the best. I'm guessing though that these fruity flavors are mostly water soluble. If it were a spicier tea, you would need to cook it in a cream/water mix on the stove because most spicier flavors are fat soluble and need to be brewed in the presence of fat to achieve proper distillation."

The city is famous for making teapots and clay flower pots. The clays are prized for the ability to retain the tea oils and change the taste and smell of the tea that's brewed in them. These pets are made from the very same clays. The animals have meaning in Chinese traditions but I can't remember them. You often see the same animals; frog, monkey, pig, koi. They go along with the whole year of whatever animal I guess. Anyways I use them as decoration, nothing serious. I'm pretty sure the pig's has the character that means fortune, I could be wrong as it's been a long time since I looked it up.

tea,3dv2gr,Ender00110011,14,Sun Jul 19 19:27:16 2015 UTC,"Former coffee addict here. One of my favorite things about tea is how diverse it can be in terms of flavors, colors, aromas, shapes... I've been pretty serious about tea for a couple of years now, and I feel like I've barely seen the tip of the iceberg!"
tea,3dv2gr,stereosip,10,Sun Jul 19 19:43:54 2015 UTC,This is another good point. Coffee really has a very narrow window of flavor and aroma possibilities. Unless you are at the absolute bleeding edge of quality. If you're drinking in the 0.001% of the best beans in the world there is a lot going on there. In the world of tea though the flavors offer much more variety. Quality tea is much more affordable and accessible than coffee too.
tea,3dv2gr,puerh_lover,5,Sun Jul 19 20:01:48 2015 UTC,"That's right. There are nuances in coffee too but they seems less easily accessible, partly because quality beans are expensive but I also feel like coffee-making is very dependent on specific equipment and technique. Although we tea drinkers also get nerdy about clay pots, water temperature and the like... A $10 gaiwan can brew almost anything."
tea,3dv2gr,stereosip,13,Sun Jul 19 20:45:02 2015 UTC,"I was deep into coffee for the good part of a decade. I roasted my own beans at home and was getting to the point where I was thinking about getting into the coffee industry. I was on a long road trip around the US and had been stopping in every coffee shop I could find. When I was in Santa Cruz, CA my friends told me to have 'kungfu tea' called puerh at a tea shop called Hidden Peak. I knew of tea. I had drank tea in some form all my life, but it never grabbed me. Puerh grabbed me.  Puerh was immediately familiar. It was like I had always known it even though that was my first time drinking it. That day I was introduced to shou puerh and a Chinese brewing ritual called 'gongfu tea'. I was immediately hooked. I am a sucker for ritual. I like doing things methodically and ritualistically and with great attention to detail. That was how I used to make coffee. It would take me 20 minutes to make a cup of coffee; it would be amazing though.  I describe shou puerh as being emotionally similar to coffee. It brews thick and dark and has some similar earthy notes. Give it a try!"
tea,3dv2gr,puerh_lover,11,Sun Jul 19 19:59:41 2015 UTC,"I find that since I made the switch from coffee to tea, I'm a whole lot calmer."
tea,3dv2gr,thegirlwhocannotfly,5,Sun Jul 19 20:32:00 2015 UTC,"I dumped coffee for tea two years ago and haven't looked back. In addition to what others have said, the world of tea is an infinitely fascinating and complex one--and certainly is its history. Here's some good reads I enjoyed:   ""Tea: Addiction, Exploitation, and Empire,"" by Roy Moxham. About England's iron-fisted tea trade, including the dominance of the East India Company, the trading of Indian opium for Chinese tea, etc.   ""For All the Tea in China: How England Stole the World‚Äôs Favorite Drink and Changed History,"" by Sarah Rose. About the botanist Robert Fortune, who committed the world‚Äôs largest corporate espionage caper in history for the East India Company. Fascinating and well-written.  ""A Social History of Tea: Tea‚Äôs Influence on Commerce, Culture and Community,"" by Jane Pettigrew and Bruce Richardson, which focuses on Britain and the US. Delightful illustrations on almost every page. A fun read.  ""Liquid Jade: The Story of Tea from East to West,"" by Beatrice Hohenegger.

tea,3dv2gr,teapup,3,Mon Jul 20 00:18:18 2015 UTC,"Puerh is a great start for Coffee lovers, but you might also look into roasted tea like houjicha or a roasted oolong."
tea,3dv2gr,amarokstar,3,Mon Jul 20 00:43:24 2015 UTC,"When we are talking to coffee drinkers that are thinking of switching to tea, we always want to know what it is about coffee that they enjoy. For many it is the robust and rich flavor, and for some it is the caffeine rush. It sounds like you are looking to back off of caffeine a bit, but might really enjoy the robust flavor of coffee. For this type of convert, we often recommend a heavily roasted oolong such as a traditional Iron Goddess of Mercy, or maybe a cooked puer. For people that really want a good caffeine kick, we usually recommend Yunnan gold tips.  Tea culture is in its infancy here in the US. We are always looking for more and more people to get into tea, so that tea culture can have more depth. Tea people tend to be pretty interesting, so by delving into tea culture, you are likely to make a few friends."
tea,3dv2gr,jteainternational,3,Mon Jul 20 01:06:33 2015 UTC,"Others have already mentioned most of positive things I associate with tea, so I'll just add that for me, the idea that drinking tea, especially gong fu style, slows down life to allow the drinker to appreciate the moment, and the tea, is also a draw.  So much of our life is fast pace and done without much thought that using tea as an excuse to pause appeals to me.  There's certainly a parallel to the 3rd wave coffee trends such as pour over coffee, but I think drinking tea gong fu style takes it to the next level.  There's a lot of talk around here on meditation and tea as well, so if you can dig into that angle if you are interested."

tea,3dv2gr,awoyo,2,Mon Jul 20 15:14:24 2015 UTC,"Make the switch! For about 25+ years of my life I was a Coke addict (not that coke!!) I was drinking literally a case of Coke daily, first drink of the day was a Coke.   Then I quit that cold turkey and switched to coffee I wasn't as bad with coffee but It was less to enjoy it as it was for the caffeine. Then after I went through withdrawls several times from not having my coffee early enough I was done.  I drink only tea now, I'll have a Black tea in the morning with cream and sugar (Black Dragon Jasmine Pearls!) but the rest of the day and evening there are so many choices. It's kind of like getting into wine tasting. You may find one or two you like and stick with that or you can be adventurous and try out the almost endless varieties.  I find I have a different attitude about tea...it's not all about the caffiene it's more about the experience now."

Would be really special if you could bring back the tea you picked yourself :)"
tea,3dw2d5,Zyliax,2,Mon Jul 20 12:03:57 2015 UTC,"I can't tell you where to find it, but I'm sure if you go to any place that sells tea, including the supermarket, you can find all or most of these:  *Sencha (go for the dark green color!)  *Matcha-iri-sencha (amazing)  *Gyokuro-cha (high grade, possibly harder to find and more expensive)  *Genmaicha (cheap, everywhere, delicious)  *Houjicha (smells and tastes like autumn leaves, cheap, very much a fan)  *Sushi-bar style tea (just plain delicious if you can find it)  These are all excellent, though Houjicha has a distinct aroma so there's a chance she won't like it as much. It is green tea, however, just roasted. There's Bancha as well, but it's sold as a low-grade low-caffeine alternative to Sencha. Don't need to get it unless you're also getting a few others as well.  You'll find good tea in all of those cities, but I would go tea shopping in Kyoto, personally. How is your Japanese? Could you find the teas by reading the labels in the store, or reading the romanized names aloud to a shopkeeper, or do you have to hand them the list in Japanese?"

She said she wasn't going to be too picky about what I brought her back either, so I won't be looking for something that's 8,000 yen a kilo or something. She just got back from Thailand herself and brought back some tea that she needs to work through anyway, but I want to bring her back something that she might not be able to find easily. Kind of a special occasion tea. I would think that Sencha or Genmaicha would be the best bet, but I'm not 100% sure. Is there anywhere in Kyoto you've purchased from personally?"
tea,3dw2d5,AndroidWorker,3,Mon Jul 20 00:52:45 2015 UTC,"8,000 yen a kilo   That's actually a pretty cheap tea :)  Do you like tea? have you tried Japanese tea brewed in a kyusu? If you want to combine shopping with a nice Japanese culture experience I have some suggestions:   Ippodo teahouse in Kyoto. You can get a wide arrange of teas, from cheap ones to pretty expensive, there with English speaking staff that can help you. There's also a cafe part where you can order some tea and learn how to prepare it. I would probably recommend this place the most for tea shopping if you're not much into tea yourself. Cha Cha No Ma in Omotesando. Pretty convenient place if you're going to visit Harajuku. Best tea I drank in Tokyo, but also very expensive. Wide selection of teas and the owner speaks English. Uogashi-Meicha Cha Ginza - a narrow 3 story high shop, where you can drink different kinds of teas on the upper floors and buy tea on the ground floor. English speaking staff, the only place where the staff hated with me while I drank my tea.   If you have any places you know for sure you will visit I can try and see if I know any good shops in the area."
tea,3dw2d5,FreakingTea,2,Mon Jul 20 13:44:49 2015 UTC,"All right then. No need for Gyokuro. You should look for Iemon brand and just take what they've got, because it's a good brand and average price. I have only spent one day in Kyoto, and that was four years ago, I just know it's more likely to have a lot of tea places than Kobe, for example, where I lived for several months. I'd recommend continuing the search on /r/japan to find a store. To be honest, though, Japanese supermarkets really do tend to have a good selection if you're not looking for high-end stuff."

The high number is probably from a combination of some people living in extended families, many roommates etc as other posters have pointed out.  Also being in large cities metro areas like NYC or SF can inflate salary in crazy ways. For example, a junior programmer position with 2 years experience around where I live will get 60-70k a year. That same person can easily get a job at any of the NYC financial firms/banks and get 90-110k a year and work up to 150k in a few years. Of course your cost of living can skyrocket if you're not careful. So a young couple working in NYC can exceed the 200k household income and not be living a ""baller"" lifestyle. Don't get me wrong, you can live a very nice life in NYC with that money but you won't be driving a Ferrari to your mansion or penthouse any time soon."

tea,3dt05e,StephieBubbles,22,Sun Jul 19 07:05:21 2015 UTC,"Honestly, that just seems like an excessive waste of plastic considering the device has such a glaring flaw - it over brews the tea.  If one absolutely has to have loose leaf tea on the go, and they are unwilling to take a reusable device with them to prevent waste, then this type of thing should work in reverse. The plastic net/leaf catcher should be on the bottom, and it should lift out in order to remove the leaves after brewing. This way, the tea is properly brewed and it will not become bitter.  Sorry for the negative response, I just dislike these sorts of things because I find them rather wasteful and in this case it is not only wasteful but flawed.

tea,3dt05e,KingofAces,11,Sun Jul 19 16:05:31 2015 UTC,This is going to make your tea bitter... unless you pour it into another cup after its done I guess.
tea,3dt05e,lie4karma,3,Sun Jul 19 09:42:01 2015 UTC,"^ This is absolutely correct. Not only from leaving the leaf in there, but also from pressing down. When french pressing tea it is never ideal to press down because it presses the bitterness out from the leaf."

I don't worry about over brewing for things like my morning tea as I get it from the coffee shop and I use 3 bags in an Extra large cup and the bags stay in the cup with the cream and sugar.  What type of tea do you drink? Would that work if you added cream and sugar? I like my plain tea throughout the rest of the day but in the morning that's the way I have it.

tea,3dty43,Thallassa,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:16:14 2015 UTC,"I usually don't store more than a day. In my climate, I've seen large spots of grey mold form within two days so I don't trust it longer than that. I do consider if I let it sit for a day, and brew it even once with boiling water, that it's a sort of ""reset"" - that'll kill the mold so it'll stop growing and it can sit more another day.   Been reading all the archives of http://deathbytea.blogspot.com. Cwyn, bless her heart, keeps her partially-steeped teas just sitting around in teapots for days on end. Her climate almost identical to mine, so really it's a personal comfort thing. Or maybe her house is really that much dryer.   My boyfriend said ""just leave the teas in a thing of water for months on end and then you'll have mushroom tea!"""

I would have it left over in the morning but would always wonder if I could use it the next day. I would throw them out but I always felt bad about wasting it.  I always use a Gaiwan so I'll just start leaving them in there. I'll probably put them in the fridge because I'm having an ant issue, but I will have to be careful to bring the Gaiwan to temperature again."
tea,3dty43,Staticblast,4,Mon Jul 20 08:20:33 2015 UTC,"I have a hard time when tasting teas purely because I lack a lot of the references. For example, I'm drinking a white tea right now, and aside from being distinctly different, I couldn't tell you what the taste is that it has. I wouldn't even be able to tell if it was peach, since I can't recall the peach taste for the life of me.  The place I bought it from is no help, they don't provide taste notes on a consistent basis.  Question: How do you build up that set of references? How do you remember tastes you've experienced before, and how do you identify tastes you haven't?  ¬†  ¬†  PS: This white is definitely not a sipping tea. Does not like cooling down! Blech!"
tea,3dty43,mating_toe_nail,2,Sun Jul 19 22:03:38 2015 UTC,"Not having a word to describe what you are tasting is okay. Many of the flavors I found in tea I first found them there so to me, the tea IS the reference flavor. I'll try another food and think ""oh this taste like silver needle!""  Just drink more teas and you'll start to get a feel for what a ""dragonwell"" green tea taste like vs a ""maofeng"" green tea. Each tea you taste will be like lighting up a little group of pixels in a large photograph. As more pixels get turned on you'll see more of the big picture so to speak."

I think if you got Scott, Paul, Glen, James, and Cwyn in a room together, you'd get 5 different stonefruits. Just look at the descriptions on their websites, compare teas from the same region. Yunnan Sourcing says plums, White2Tea doesn't say much of anything because he doesn't believe in tasting notes, Crimson Lotus says apricots, DeathByTea says cherries.  Everyone's experience is a bit different, and perhaps more important, everyone's brewing is quite a bit different.   Go out there and experience as many things as you can (not just tea, but tea too). Tastes are instinctual memories; you can't pull them up on command all the time, but if you taste something again you will be able to recognize it as something you've tasted before. Being able to put a name to a flavor simply requires experience."

If you're talking about the unglazed cast iron kettles that are just used to heat water there are benefits. The water interacts with the iron content in the kettle to make the water taste better.  I suppose the glazed ones might do well for brewing teas that needed to be extra hot. The cast iron is great for heat retention.

And there's a particular set of bitter flavors that I can't stand that he really likes.   So apparently the Bulang Shan tribute tea that is supposed to be pretty bitter, is just right for him (I don't particularly like it).   Meanwhile I quite like the Xiaguan sheng, but he thinks it's bitter.   The weird part is I'll make it in a 200 mL gaiwan and pour it into my chahai. He'll insist the first cup I pour for him from the chahai is too bitter and the second is just right. No idea what he's tasting. Maybe he just does it to annoy me. More likely it's temperature related."
tea,3dty43,mating_toe_nail,2,Sun Jul 19 20:35:20 2015 UTC,Maybe it's bitter vs astringency? Also the first pour tends to push out he aroma so maybe he's more sensitive to aromatics?

Saffron has a kind of bitter-sweet taste and gunpowder is kind of smoky and smells like tobacco a bit. But don't let that scare you! Gunpowder is one of my favorite green teas and is really good with mint (with mint the tea is called Moroccan mint tea and is really popular in the middle east). You can get moderately priced gunpowder at adagio teas and even make your own blend with saffron added in, but this looks like a nice quality so if have the money go for it."

tea,3dty43,mating_toe_nail,3,Sun Jul 19 23:43:57 2015 UTC,"This is my personal scale:   $0.15/g($4.25/oz) - Things I would make large batches of for iced tea and serve to people who are not into tea. There are some good deals to be found in this price range! $0.25/g($7/oz) - Good daily drinkers. These would be the teas I would personally not hesitate to make everyday for myself, experiment, play with etc. I would serve this to friends whether they are into tea or not  :-p I would bring these to work to brew all day. $0.50/g($14/oz) - The sweet spot it seems for absolute quality vs price in Taiwanese oolongs. You can get good stuff at this price range. There are plenty of other teas that can be at high quality in this price range. I would put this as the very beginning of ""expensive"" teas. I would be hesitant to bring teas of this price at work. It would be a bit of a waste. $1/g ($28/oz) - These are my nice teas. I would not brew these at work. These teas are what I would brew on the weekend for myself and other people who are into tea. These teas are weighed on a scale and carefully brewed. I would consider this well into ""high end"" teas. It seems your average high quality cliff tea that was in the $14-$20/oz a few years ago has moved into this realm! $1.50/g ($40/oz) - These are the few times a year teas. I have these teas in my stash but they do only get brewed when I know I can reserve a large block of time to enjoy them. $2.00/g ($57/oz) and above - These are the tuition teas. I rarely, if ever buy these teas outright. If a vendor has something in this price range that I am curious about I don't mind paying for a small sample."

tea,3dty43,mating_toe_nail,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:17:37 2015 UTC,"I buy from all over. Even the popular vendors here on /r/Tea have their higher end offerings! For example if you were shopping on White 2 Tea for some pu'er this tea might be worth sampling. This brand is popular so you get to have a reference point. You get to sample a 100 dollar cake for 12 bucks. If you have more cash, sample this tea. This is an $800 cake so even the sample is expensive at $60 but you get to sample an $800 cake. I wouldn't buy JUST expensive samples but if you already building a largish order with a vendor, take a look at their higher end stuff.  As far as actually buying, I buy mostly oolongs. For example, the 2007 HuiYan DHP from here was one of my favorites. The price eventually went up to $56/oz and no more is available :-( However [this guy](cassia-extraordinaire.html) I find really enjoyable even though it does not have the deep roast I like.

tea,3dty43,Thallassa,2,Tue Jul 21 12:57:20 2015 UTC,"Depends a little on your budget. My hobby money is a bit split so my budget is lower than, say, /u/mating_toe_nail's or /u/EarnestWilde's.   It also depends on what kind of tea and what country of origin. An expensive TieGuanYin is in a whole different level (much cheaper) than an expensive Wuyi or gyokuro.   For me, expensive is over 25 cents per gram ($12.50 per 50 g). That's on the very low end of what you can pay for taiwanese and japanese teas, mid-ish of what you can pay for dragon well, and I don't see the point of paying more than that for a TGY (someone convince me otherwise. Or rather... please don't, my budget can't handle it).   Cheap would be less than 8 cents per g ($4 per 50 g). Below that you're likely to not get anything good, but there are certainly things available.   I mostly spend in the range of 10-15 cents per gram. You can get pretty decent daily drinkers in that range without breaking your budget. But it's unlikely to get anything really amazing for that range either, and you can't get anything taiwanese or japanese in that range at all."

tea,3dty43,cielavocyr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:15:32 2015 UTC,Oh boy are we ever similar... I shot on a d90 for years before this year beginning a transition to a Fuji system! Found a deal on an XPro1 with an 18mm lens that I couldn't refuse... couldn't be happier!
tea,3dty43,mating_toe_nail,0,Mon Jul 20 12:45:17 2015 UTC,I really love ultra wide lenses. Boy are they are to take pictures with but are so satisfying. One of the reasons I've stuck with D90 is the Tamron 11-16mm lens. However you have to apply everything you've ever learned about composition just to consistently make photos that don't all look the same. I've thought up moving up the Nikon FX with that 14-24 but the sheer size and cost of that setup is shocking to say the least.   However my phone camera and Fuji x100s cover so much of my photographic needs that having a very specialized setup like that 14-24mm doesn't seem so crazy anymore. I really like the mental process of shooting slowly and deliberately. I've also liked detailed cityscapes lately. They're hard to make interesting for more than 5 seconds!  I've thought just getting a medium format to shoot velvia slides.

tea,3doey5,song_pond,19,Fri Jul 17 22:48:20 2015 UTC,"So here's how I did it. This recipe makes enough for the larger one in the pic (which happens to also have glitter in it).   2 tbsp each of baking soda and citric acid (also called lemon salt). 1 tbsp of Epsom salts. Approximately 2 tsp of tea infused coconut oil (directions below. ONE drop of essential oil (optional. I used lavender, but more than one drop overpowered the more delicate scent of the tea). glitter to your liking (optional) edit after using a glitter one: don't use glitter. You will regret it.   Mix the dry ingredients together, then add a small amount of infused coconut oil as well as your drop of essential oil. Mix together. Add more coconut oil, little by little, until the mixture can keep its shape. I usually just spoon some up against the side of the bowl, and if it looks like it's keeping shape I don't add any more oil. Now you're ready to place it into your mould. Anything plastic will do, so that you can take bomb out fairly easily buy turning it upside down and pushing on the bottom. Leave it for an hour or two to harden before taking it out of the mould. Now you're ready for a bath! I put some tea leaves in the bottom of my mould before putting my mixture in, by way of garnish.  Tea infused coconut oil:  Put some coconut oil and some tea leaves in a crock pot together. I used a tea that I like the smell of but not the taste. Turn your crock pot on low for 8 hours (or high for 4) or until you get a nice tea scent. You can put it in a mason jar instead, if you'd rather not clean the crock afterwards. Strain out tea leaves. Use for bath bombs! :-)  Edit: please note that if you use glitter, it will get everywhere. It's the herpes of crafts."

Edit: phone thinks that tea is early, not earl"
tea,3doey5,throw_the_soap,12,Sat Jul 18 00:23:33 2015 UTC,"Basically, essential oils should never be ingested. While they are sometimes okay to use like in oral hygiene products, they must be very diluted. Same with essential oils when using them topically, though some people can stand to use certain essential oils neat on their skin, namely lavender, tea tree, and a few others but that's not everybody.  Companies like DoTerra that suggest ingesting essential oils drive me nuts with making claims that their essential oils are such a high grade that they can be used internally. When in reality, they are setting themselves up for a huge lawsuit when their customers start having irreversible damage to their internal body due to ingesting their products.  Sorry for going off on a tangent but whenever I see something about ingesting essential oils, I feel it is my duty as an a fellow human being to help inform others so that they can make informed decisions. Plants are powerful things and they can help us tremendously but can also hurt us greatly. We have to respect nature! For the record. I am not an expert or a doctor.

I did know that at least some essential oils should never be ingested, but I didn't realize it was all of them.

Thank you for posting!!"

I've been a lurker here for a while and this has been a wonderful welcome :)  Lucky you that you can use peppermint undiluted. I, on the other hand, cannot. Whoof! I was making some peppermint soap one time and there was a hole in my glove. I didn't realize it up I was done but my finger was so angry because the peppermint essential oil got to it.  To sum up: Basically, if you want to ingest herbs, a strong infusion or decoction (teas), or a tincture (an extract using alcohol) are the safest and best ways to reap the benefits of them. I understand that I am probably preaching to the choir but it's always good to read the same information more than once."

Oh, and to reply to another comment of yours about using glitter. If you want glitter in your bath bombs, try using micas. I personally don't use them because I try to stay away from lab created ingredients but they have been tested for skin safety. They add a really nice shimmer to your water. Unfortunately, most bath bombs that use an oil will leave some sort of ring around your tub. Maybe try using an oil free liquid for bath bombs. It may get frustrating using water-based ingredients but a few spritz of witch hazel is a good liquid to use. Have fun!"
tea,3doey5,She2Beautiful,2,Sat Jul 18 03:18:25 2015 UTC,"Does witch hazel make the citric acid and baking soda react? The only reason I've been sticking to oil is because anything water based will cause a reaction. If witch hazel doesn't do that, maybe I will switch to that!"
tea,3doey5,thelastoutloud,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:29:24 2015 UTC,"It can cause a reaction. Not all witch hazel on the market is the same. Some have ingredients added to it to make it more skin nourishing (like Thayer's), some come as an extract (contains alcohol), and some are hydrosols (distilled and may contain small amounts of water based ingredients and miniscule amounts of plant parts). I have used the extract with some success, I've also used grain alcohol with some success.  But like I said, when you start using anything other than an oil based liquid for your bath bombs, it becomes even more tricky. The reason I switched was because I sell my products and I was afraid of the slippery factor and didn't really feel like getting sued :) That and a few people complained about the ring around the tub. Now I just make them for myself lol! It's much easier that way.  If you're content with your recipe, don't change it up! Just be careful :)"

tea,3dqecj,Thallassa,2,Sat Jul 18 14:44:16 2015 UTC,"According to my beloved southern relatives, you did it entirely in the wrong order.   You MUST add the sugar BEFORE adding the water and ice, because it ""somehow reacts with the hot tea"" and tastes different. (Well, besides of which you can't get it to dissolve sufficiently quickly in cold/lukewarm water).    I cannot tell any difference myself, but they insist they can taste it.   Keep in mind for them, the undiluted hot tea should basically be syrup before it gets diluted to something drinkable (and for me, I consider the diluted version to still be very syrupy)."

tea,3dqecj,saltyteabag,2,Sun Jul 19 07:43:03 2015 UTC,"In general, the smaller pieces that the leaves are in, the faster they infuse, and the less worthwhile they would be for resteeping.  Like some of the assam teas that are shredded in to the little pieces like these don't resteep well.  Flavored teas are pretty worthless to try to resteep as well, because most of the flavoring comes off in the first steep."

tea,3doxwu,bodhicha_tea,8,Sat Jul 18 01:39:24 2015 UTC,"Done!  The survey got a little weird when it asks to submit a video expressing the love for your favorite tea with interpretive dance.  I hope I did enough arm circles to express raw puerh.....  I mean, it got a little sketchy about 45 min in, but I think I nailed it.  Juggling the yixings went exactly as I feared but I'll save up to get another one.  One must make sacrifices for art."

Also on the brewing methods, you forgot grandpa style , i.e. leaves and water in your cup with no filter. I have switched mostly to that out of laziness with occasional use of my Tetsubin (another missing option, but I marked Western Style Teapot since the process is very similar).  Besides those two, or three, missing options, I am curious to see the answers."

Of course I lost the name, but I believe they're the only place that does this kind of high-end ceramics repair in the city. If you arrive at a tiny place stacked with very expensive pottery, you're probably there.   In Maokong, hit up the cafes near the gondola exit (final ridge). There are two right off the station; the one farther away from the gondola does excellent flavors of tea soft serve."

I thought some pu-erh cake since every body here raves about it.   He suggested I try some first stateside before he brings that home. I'm glad he did cause it is literally not my cup of tea. What is the appeal of that tea?
tea,3dmpht,LadiesWhoPunch,3,Fri Jul 17 16:51:07 2015 UTC,"It depends on the pu'erh. A ""fresh"" shou ( the dark kind) can have a strong fishy odor. They need to air out 2-3 years before drinking. Sheng ""green/raw"" pu'erh can start off astringent but they mellow out over the years.   What did you get? If you got it from adagio or something there's a good chance it is not good quality. Please don't judge all pu'erh based on one bad experience."
tea,3dmpht,Redcat1991,2,Fri Jul 17 18:54:21 2015 UTC,I wanna say it was good quality tea. It wasn't from adagio. I shop at a pretty wonderful store and they have teas in bulk and I grab a bit from them. I know they carry Silk Road Teas in bulk if that gives you an indication of what the quality might be.   I think I just like mike my teas black and fruity. The earthiest I get is like a genmaicha.
tea,3dmpht,LadiesWhoPunch,3,Fri Jul 17 19:33:57 2015 UTC,Loose pu'erh is almost never a good indicator of how pu'erh should taste. Same goes for the majority of mini tuochas. Try some samples from crimson lotus tea or white 2 tea. They have quality stuff.
