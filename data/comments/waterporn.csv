waterporn,3e3y9d,escgallery,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:43:57 2015 UTC,"My last day in Oahu I jumped into the Magnum PI helicopter to take some aerial shots around the island. From taking off out of the Honolulu airport, Waikiki beach was the first spot we flew over when circling the island. Thankfully the harness in the helicopter was sturdy enough to support my weight as I was dangling out the side of it to get my photos!  When most people think Hawaii, they think Waikiki beach. This is probably one of the most iconic beaches and most sought after vacations spots in the world. I just new that I had to score one photo of this great place! This is my version of a Waikiki beach photograph.

So you don't really need to do much hiking at all.  I did not even know it was there until you mentioned it.

Also to be honest, many surfers surf waves next to rocks in shallow water.  One of my favourite breaks growing up was right next to rocks, you could easily get smashed but for the most part you know what you're able to get away with.  Edit: Just to clarify, I definitely wouldn't surf this, you need a heap of talent and confidence to surf this break, its fucking gnarly, a whole other level to the break at my hometown.

waterporn,39axbq,yoweigh,2,Wed Jun 10 21:45:02 2015 UTC,"I am standing on a trail looking up a series of waterfalls that were flooding from a recent rainstorm.  I used a technique called 'panning' where the camera shutter is open for a little bit longer, and you track your subject with the lens.  What this usually does is keep your subject in focus, while streaking/blurring the surroundings (due to camera movement with the slow shutter).  Here, I panned vertically to follow my subject, which was the water as it fell.  I was trying to match the vertical movement of my lens with the perceived speed of the falling water.  Had I kept the camera still at this shutter speed, all of the water would appear smooth and blurred, instead I have only that small portion in detail, focused, while the rest is blurred and chaotic.    Here's a shot I took of the same falls from a slight position change at normal flow: https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3897/14756105254_02222f0637_k.jpg"

If you're still in Baja, or plan to go back, I highly suggest spending time in Ecomundo down in Bahia Concepcion. The warm waters there are so saturated with bioluminescence that a flick of the wrist while night-snorkeling is like creating your own universe of stars.   Baja is a truly magical place.

Have been missing it quite a bit and hope to return soon, have stopped by Bahia Concepcion but never spent enough time there, will have to next time!

waterporn,396eai,mirite,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:53:31 2015 UTC,"Hey there, beautiful picture. I traveled to Bahia de Los Angeles about a dozen times up until i was about 12 years old. At 25, I'm feeling the call again and would like to plan another trip. Do you know anything about traveling to the bay via car from the san diego border? I keep hearing the ""safety"" word and am curious whether it's just a stereotype being pushed."
waterporn,396eai,mirite,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:51:59 2015 UTC,"Hi, thanks for the compliment! I've driven down twice from Oregon, in 2010 and 2011 and have mates that have continued to do so every year.  We've never had any issues and I certainly do agree on the stereotype thing.  I think a big thing is that not only is most mainstream american media super fear-mongering and sensational, but people just hear about violence in mexico and assume all of mexico is dangerous.  If you actually look at the news stories more critically you can begin to see most of the drug related and cartel violence is localized in certain places, border towns certainly being among them, and that it's usually somewhat targeted violence.  It seems to me from my understanding of the situation that even the cartels want to do with, and do their best to avoid messing with tourists.    The first year we went into Tiajuana on the way down to get the tourist visa (we were staying more than 2 weeks or a month or whatever it was) and it definitely seemed really shady.  Since then we've been driving a bit more to the interior and crossing through Tecate which has been way more pleasurable.  Another important aspect of the situation to remember is that the baja peninsula is relatively sparsely populated, especially aside from the Cabos at the tip and the border towns in the north, and therefor I definitely didn't get the feeling there was very many people waiting to jack other people (or that there were many people around at all for that matter!) and furthermore pretty much all the mexicans I interacted with during my voyages in mex were suuuper friendly and more than hospitable.  I also have a good mate who hitch-hiked around mex by himself and made it through without too much trouble, which is encouraging.  Of course, like anywhere, be smart and do your research, and know where not to be!  Hope this helps and that you make it back soon!  I'm missin baja somethin fierce myself!"

Every 6 months you get a 2-3 day window to capture the sun as it sets and moves between the last two pillars of this pier. Unfortunately the winter sets are almost always cloud covered and it makes this almost a once a year event. We were there the night before and the cloud cover was to heavy to get the shot I wanted so we headed back down last night. The weather Gods found favor in our small group of photographers and kept the horizon clear with a nice layered cloud deck just above the pier. Right as the event started a wave came in and sunk the one side of my tripod. I frantically readjusted it and was able to get the shot. You only have about 15 seconds to get the sun right in the middle as it moves very quickly across the window. This is a combination of 2 shots. a 6 minute long exposure just before the sun creeped in and a 30 second exposure when the sun was dead in the middle. I was using a Formatt-Hitech 10 stop filter for both shots.

waterporn,343n4j,TK82,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:46:54 2015 UTC,my solution was to not use HDR anymore. A landscape like this you can throw on a graduated filter and get a much better result in one exposure.
waterporn,343n4j,draqza,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:00:36 2015 UTC,"I always found Photomatix to be a huge pain to use to get anything looking sort of ""natural""...once I got past the intentionally overblown phase, I moved on from it. For a while I was using Oloneo HDREngine to merge the images and just get a good histogram, and then edit the resulting TIFF in Lightroom. (Here's an example of something I did with that workflow several years ago...of course, it has other problems, like that it's a little off-kilter and there are some alignment issues.)  Now that I have Photoshop, my preferred approach is just to merge to 32bit HDR and edit in Camera Raw, although maybe LR6's merge to HDR will simplify that when I get a chance to try it."

waterporn,3409hb,hdr4thewin,1 point,Mon Apr 27 07:26:29 2015 UTC,This is my first time shooting San Clemente Pier. My original plan was to shoot under the pier. But as the sun was getting low the clouds were just to good to hide under the pier and I decided on a more traditional side profile. I had been doing 7 min exposures but some rogue waves came in and hit me with some seaweed and moved the tripod. At that point I switched to shorter exposures so I didn't miss this amazing sunset. The reflections and saturation of color in the sand was spectacular and the sky was so beautiful. I hope you enjoy seeing this capture as much as I did taking it.

(more importantly probably) the rock ledge on the right (limestone I'm pretty sure, it's a bit east of Poipu) has been eroded over millions of the year so that now it juts out over the ocean and kind of ""floats"" there in a disembodied fashion from this perspective"

According to the weather and tides it looked like it was going to have the possibility of a great sunset. I met a few friends there and we headed out to the shoreline. The skies did not disappoint. The sun creeped between the pillars of the pier and lit up the sky. The layers of clouds looking like they were on fire set on a background of deep blue skies. I took a series of long exposures, the longest being this image at 6 minutes. It was a beautiful evening with amazing skies, warm water, and good friends.

waterporn,31t352,puffinkat,3,Tue Apr 7 23:13:53 2015 UTC,"Fun fact: You can drink fresh water that spills out of the Amazon & into the sea for up to about 250 miles from where it discharges from land:   The river pushes a vast plume of fresh water into the ocean. The plume is about 400 kilometres (250 mi) long and between 100 and 200 kilometres (62 and 124 mi) wide. The fresh water, being lighter, flows on top of the seawater, diluting the salinity and altering the color of the ocean surface over an area up to 1,000,000 square miles (2,600,000 km2) in extent. For centuries ships have reported fresh water near the Amazon's mouth yet well out of sight of land in what otherwise seemed to be the open ocean."

waterporn,30rb23,bryckbreaker,1 point,Mon Mar 30 12:56:43 2015 UTC,Glad you're here. How is it possible for concrete to rust?
waterporn,30rb23,bryckbreaker,2,Mon Mar 30 13:12:17 2015 UTC,Concrete doesn't exactly rust but the steel reinforcement rebar inside it will. When the rebar rusts it expands and will fracture the concrete.   Concrete naturally has a basic pH around 13.5 which allows steel to form a protective layer on it but high salt or acidic environments will break down that film.  What you're seeing on the concrete piles is just rust staining. Higher up the piles is constantly being misted with salt water which is just enough to rust the rebar and leach out the iron oxide from the cracks but not enough to wash it away so it stains the concrete surface. A little lower down looks like a build up of organic matter which has also been stained with rust as it dried out from changing tides.

waterporn,2xszyj,Fishtails,2,Tue Mar 3 23:45:19 2015 UTC,"So is it a hike to get there? or just drive up and look? I'm planning my next hike and was thinking that, Mt. Rainer, Mt. St. Helens, maybe Banff."
waterporn,2xszyj,notgod,2,Wed Mar 4 04:53:34 2015 UTC,"We camped at the Annie Creek campground, 5 miles to the south.  Drove up and parked and hiked along the edge of the crater for a couple of miles.  There are lots of trails around the area to park and go on day hikes. We didn't do anything strenuous, but I believe there are some more challenging trails around.  The whole area, the Umpqua, Deschutes, Willamette Natl Forests are full of good hiking from what it looked like.  Unfortunately we weren't there long enough to do more than a few short hikes."
waterporn,2xszyj,Fishtails,1 point,Wed Mar 4 18:19:04 2015 UTC,"You can drive around the outside of the crater and they have a number of lookout points. You have to hike to get down in the crater at all and down to the water, as far as I'm aware.  I'm guessing this picture was taken on one of the hikes down. I forget the name of the one i took but it was maybe 30 or so minutes to get to the water. Pretty steep at points but basically a dirt path."
waterporn,2xszyj,pitch2johnny,1 point,Wed Mar 4 07:12:18 2015 UTC,It's maybe closer to 15 or 20 on your way back up. It's a 1 mile hike from parking to where you can jump in.

I have heard glassy smooth water is tough to land on because it becomes nearly invisible as it reflects the sky. On a lake you know the level of the water add you can see the shore, but it is still tricky to know when to flare. No visible shore on the ocean, so you have to guess when to flare,and wait till you connect with the water."

Think watering lawns 3x daily, power-washing sidewalks (nightly in some parts of Beverly Hills, weekly in other affluent or popular areas), and epic infrastructure leakages due to age.  Add to that a lack of enforcement for the leading waste offenders, like Uncle Joe Bob who wants his tarmac shiny at 3pm on July the 15th, and I can't help but think of different numbers than 80/20.

waterporn,2te98x,kluntlah,2,Fri Jan 23 12:28:26 2015 UTC,I felt lucky to make it my home for a night :-)
waterporn,2tap1i,BurgerBuoy,10,Thu Jan 22 15:47:24 2015 UTC,any geologists able to explain?  This looks insane!
waterporn,2tap1i,erythro,3,Thu Jan 22 18:42:09 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see a geological explanation. The peninsula forms a perfectly symmetrical bend on both sides before forming a hammerhead at the end. Totally natural too. Weirdest part is, there's a town a hundred or so kilometers east of Gwadar (Ormara) with the exact same geological features."

waterporn,2tap1i,Epicshark,3,Fri Jan 23 07:21:57 2015 UTC,"It looks like there was an island that was close to the mainland, and the currents moved sand in such a way that it formed a tombolo."
waterporn,2tap1i,Squirrella,2,Fri Jan 23 04:59:12 2015 UTC,Why are there no hotels or such?
waterporn,2tap1i,Squirrella,5,Thu Jan 22 19:02:28 2015 UTC,There is. Google Pearl Continental Gwadar. It's right in the middle of the peninsula.
waterporn,2tap1i,bobdolebobdole,3,Thu Jan 22 19:30:17 2015 UTC,Thanks!  :)

waterporn,2t6vbo,firestarsoundsystem,2,Wed Jan 21 17:40:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if it's that island, but one of the little micro islands there (near Lighthouse Point and Horseshoe Bay) was recently selling for $10million, with a massive mansion, elevator, yacht dock, and helicopter landing pad."
waterporn,2t6vbo,ether_reddit,1 point,Wed Jan 21 19:52:19 2015 UTC,Great pic - where is this? We're going nuts at work trying to figure it out on Google maps. Thanks.
waterporn,2t6vbo,nickjourno,1 point,Wed Jan 21 17:55:19 2015 UTC,Taken from one of the BC Ferries. About 10 minutes from the Horseshoe Bay ferry terminal.
waterporn,2t6vbo,nickjourno,2,Wed Jan 21 18:04:48 2015 UTC,I'm just trying to find it on google maps for you

waterporn,2t75r0,bb453,1 point,Wed Jan 21 18:55:29 2015 UTC,Just past storey arms is it? That's my favourite route up to Pen-y-fan.
waterporn,2t75r0,ryanllw,2,Thu Jan 22 16:08:13 2015 UTC,Yeah that's it! I just passed through it as I was on my way up to Bala! The area was too nice to miss having a quick photography session!
waterporn,2t46ll,onlysame1,8,Wed Jan 21 00:48:33 2015 UTC,Is this a place people can come for the day and go swimming?  Edit: yes. yes it is.
waterporn,2t46ll,black_rose_,10,Wed Jan 21 07:01:58 2015 UTC,"Local here: yes, you can go swimming! The beach costs ten a car to park near. It's best not to go on weekends or holidays because it gets very crowded. The main beach has some amazing rocks to jump off and the water is very cold even in the summer (because it's all from snow run off). Though, the winter is a whole different sort of beautiful. The beaches are sandy (hence the name) And the rocks are all granite. The main beaches to the left and right of parking are most crowded, but there's some nice hidden alcoves between the two main beaches for a more private feel."
waterporn,2t46ll,absentmindful,0,Wed Jan 21 07:33:52 2015 UTC,That place is pretty beautiful but the white balance on this shot isn't doing  it much justice
waterporn,2t46ll,Iggz831,2,Wed Jan 21 02:43:22 2015 UTC,It's too green. It doesn't do the water justice.
waterporn,2t46ll,absentmindful,1 point,Wed Jan 21 07:37:02 2015 UTC,"That's the actual color of the water this time of year. Source: i was there on new years weekend, and i visit regularly."
waterporn,2t46ll,IANALAMA,1 point,Wed Jan 21 15:44:02 2015 UTC,I live here and it's not that green.
waterporn,2t46ll,Iggz831,1 point,Wed Jan 21 16:21:18 2015 UTC,"google images search shows they are all sorta ""emerald"" color, i think it depends on the depth, i know the lake is really low right now (walked way out onto rocks that are usually under water when i visited), so maybe that is causing different colors, more concentrated algae, time of day/angle of sun, etc?   i don't think it looks ""off"", but i know that it can look different."
waterporn,2t46ll,IANALAMA,1 point,Wed Jan 21 17:23:13 2015 UTC,Ha! I suppose so. I'm too used to the summer look.
waterporn,2t46ll,absentmindful,1 point,Wed Jan 21 16:22:58 2015 UTC,I think it looks stunning.
