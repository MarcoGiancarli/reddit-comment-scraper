Green developers take a good year or two to really learn how to do ""actual development"".    Are you on all the major job boards, I don't mean applying to jobs, but simply leaving your resume up and publicly accessible?  It is odd, but recruiters who watch those sites are often respected far more than direct applies.  By directly applying to roles, you might be hampering your chances of success.  Additionally, you might look around for local 8A companies run by disabled vets.  They tend to have more work than they can handle, are small and the person making the hire decision will often be a vet, maybe even a Marine."

I started out doing customer support at a small software company and was promoted to full developer after a few months once I proved I knew what I was doing. Another place to start might be in QA.   Companies just don't want to hire people with no professional experience at full developer salaries to fuck up their codebase. Developing production software is a lot different than what they teach in school. Once you're in the front door it should be much easier.

They are military placement companies founded by vets, they both have regional offices here, and Austin is a burgeoning growth center for tech jobs. My guess is they can most likely help you find something entry level/internship-based.  It sounds like all you're missing is actual work experience -- unfortunately it would have been more ideal to network for internships while you were still in school, but all is not lost. Choose a target of where you want to land in 5, 10, 20 years, look for people who have done that, read articles and bio's about them, and do the same things with an awareness of changes in the industry. As you slowly check off the required boxes, you'll become more and more attractive as a candidate for the next role."

I didn't do an internship because I was older and wanted to finish as quickly as I could and get started on my career before I was in my mid 30's. Now I'm realizing what a mistake that was. If you don't have an internship, or stellar grades, most companies won't even bother with you. My 3.1 GPA and no internships but 12 years of full time work experience in all kinds of jobs won't even get me to a second interview because I didn't spend six months doing bullshit busy work. And I know people who had internships, they all said they had no serious duties at all.

This sounds like it's been going on for quite a while now, so they either went another direction, aren't serious about hiring right now, etc. It sounds unprofessional on his part, and that should be kind of a red flag.

I don't think he will say ""No, because ExagEngi said not to tell you."" He will most likely say that he cannot disclose that and leave it there.  Just play it by ear. If they say they need this info, give it to them and explain that you were offered $22/hr but turned it down in favor of their $27/hr offer. Worst case, they rethink their offer.

Explain that you're not being thin skinned, but their persistent disrespect has had an impact on your satisfaction in the work place and is one of the reasons that you're moving on.  Unless the company is entirely shit they will appreciate the input from someone who no longer has a direct stake in it.  If the bully is as bad as you say, then you can count on him looking for a new target when you are gone.  That person will certainly appreciate having a history of this abuse when they file their complaint.  Now some advice for dealing with bullies.  Even if you share an office with someone, don't be afraid to use email as your primary channel of communication.  The advantage is that you'll have a record of what they say and also you can take time with your own communication to make sure that you remain professional even when they aren't.    Don't EVER forget that you're valuable to the company.  You do your work well and have skills that are worth a lot of money.  If some douche wants to make your height an issue it's because he can't hit you where it counts.  When someone gives you some shit, the first time you draw them aside and tell them you thought that was unprofessional, and even though you enjoy working with them you will not tolerate being treated disrespectfully.

The interesting thing is, outside of work, in a one on one setting you wouldn't identify these people as bullies. It is purely in a group setting when I am harassed. It's increased over the past two weeks as the other boss that would defend me seems to not care since I'm leaving the business and is letting things get out of hand.   Really appreciate your last paragraph, it's amazing how detrimental bullying can be to how you perceive your abilities and your confidence. I've never felt so worthless as I do with this organisation, I was only at the job search for a month, but it felt like an eternity having to survive this environment.

jobs,3e1m7a,SeekersWorkAccount,6,Tue Jul 21 11:29:39 2015 UTC,"It actually sounds a lot like a place that a buddy of mine used to work at.  Two guys started up the company about ten years ago and kind of struck it rich.  All of the sudden they had about 30 people working for them and contracts with some pretty significant customers with some very significant expectations.  A lot of the time, especially in tech firms, the guys at the top are pretty solid technically but not as good at the business side as they think they are.  Managing a company requires a certain kind of genius and a lot of guys wind up in over their heads.  But the last thing that you can afford is for people to catch on how thoroughly you are winging it.  So you let your alpha hang out.  Find a whipping boy and demonstrate to everyone else how much you are in charge by abusing them.  Guys like that, even if they weren't driving away good talent like yourself, are going to run their company into the ground anyway.  Take care of yourself and close that chapter of your life.  Everyone has one or two shitty work experiences.  The point is that you see the new place as a fresh start.  Who gives a fuck what your linked in picture looks like?  I'll tell you who.  People who are really digging for excuses to belittle someone else."

They're not a tech firm that struck it rich and lacked the business skills, their business is centric to developing people and organisations in the working lives. The whipping boy comment resonates, I very much am the scape goat and have been for quite some time. I'm a simple outlet for alpha dominance for them. It's funny how people you consider your friends in one on one situations can turn around and exploit you in the most derogatory ways in front of an entire group to assert themselves. There's been a few of these personalities at this organisation; and no one seems to stand up to them."

But also try to look within yourself and figure out why you so easily became a target so as to avoid bullying in future jobs. In my opinion, it's not just that you are short or young.

Alpha male type dominance picking on the weakest link - it doesn't help that his harassment falls on deaf ears. I understand my course of action in tolerating this behaviour was wrong, in hindsight I shouldn't have nervously laughed in the corner and taken their abuse but rather responded to it in a manner which was evident that I was aware of their wrongdoing. Regardless, I think their are shit people. I have met people I cannot understand how they have made it so far, particularly as managers. My two direct managers promised a lot and delivered on very little, I'm sure they'll develop a name eventually for being the exact opposite of what they preach. I've never been a victim of bullying before, I've been regarded as brilliant for my age (without tooting my own trumpet), people are taken aback by my age and how much I know for how young I am. This job has no doubt made a significant impact on my confidence levels, but I'm looking forward to my new job and a fresh start. Unfortunately keeping to myself and trying to stay away from them hasn't done much to help, we're in an open plan environment and I am made fun of at random intervals during the day without provoking an attack.

You are the type of co-worker or employee that I like to have on my team. You seem to have gone through this with grace and high professionalism which is rarely seen. Some comments have suggested that you are some how ""less"" for allowing this behavior to happen. First, you are not responsible for others actions. Secondly, it takes a lot more effort, willpower, and guts to stick up for your self and still maintain professionalism under conditions like this. People like to think others will change or stop after confrontation but this does not happen as often as people think in an environment where the bystanders are complicit with the offending behavior.  Good for you. I wish you the best at your new job. Also, if it helps YOU to write the letters do it.

jobs,3e1xd9,roofunf,19,Tue Jul 21 09:24:43 2015 UTC,"I actually just did this, and was offered a position at the respective startup. They told me they were impressed by the questions I asked during the interview process, so here are some things you might want to bring up:  First, if the company has or will raise money, you absolutely need to know the runway and burn rate. In other words, assuming they have next to zero revenue, how long can they stay in business based on what's in the bank? You should be getting an answer in years, not months. If they're hesitant to tell you, call it quits. Then ask who they raised the money from. Get names. Don't underestimate this question - it can reveal a lot.   Second, ask them about their clients, even if the position that you want isn't sales or client side. They should be able to talk at length about this if their business model has potential or is at all legit. Average length of a sales cycle, how are they generating sales leads, how much of their monthly revenue comes from their 3 largest contracts, ect. Don't be shy when asking, they should want and be able to share this with you.  Ask about growth. Month over month, year over year. Be very, very skeptical if they aren't giving you numbers. This should be a bragging point for the company if things are going well.   Equity is total bullshit if you're not a founder or investor. Join this company to learn, not to earn. Because the chances of you ever making anything off the 0.1% stake given to you (this was offered to me as employee number 6) is remote. Not to mention that with a one year cliff and a four year vesting period, it could take as much as five years before you're even legally entitled to all of your shares.   Basically, just do your homework, and don't be shy about asking pointed (but polite) questions during the interview. Small companies should want to sell you on the job, just as much as you want to sell yourself to them."
jobs,3e1xd9,eighthedition,2,Tue Jul 21 14:06:07 2015 UTC,"This is incredibly good advice, especially about runway and burn rate.   I'd recommend you also look at trends (competitor growth, impending legislation, seasonality) that may impact revenue and ask about existing plans to deal with them."
jobs,3e1xd9,QueenofSavages,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:13:51 2015 UTC,"Very nice tips. To add onto the equity bit, you should also clarify what kind of shares. Are they preferred or common stock? Preferred means you get priority in actually exercising an action on them when the time comes, whereas with common, you have to wait an extended period longer.   This is less important because it's so rare, but also if it's straight up shares (actual stake in the company). The more common scenario is that they're options (stake that you can purchase later on at a fraction of the cost of the actual share price).  Also, more generally, if you have ANY concerns, make sure to address it. Working for a startup is really tough, especially in the early stages. Founders need to earn your trust, and you need to be sold on their vision (how they're going to disrupt a certain niche and ""better"" the world), not the dream (how you'll end up being a millionaire by working 100 hour weeks)."

Also, are there equity options? Always ask for equity in start ups like this. If they plan on going public as soon as possible then you may be able to make a lot of money fast.

The former is more focused on sustainability & cash-flow vs. the latter focuses more on growth. Which categories does this software company fall into?  If it's the latter, then other posters already covered it. One thing I would add is to ask about the grand vision of the company. Start-ups can be challenging and there will be rough patches to get through. Believing in the team and the vision will help you through those times.   If it's a small company, then you should focus on career progression and cultural fit. Career progression is important, because smaller companies often do not have a standard ""track"" for promotions and new opportunities. Be clear with your expectations, and make sure to tie the company to this.   Cultural fit - well, it's gonna be a tight-knit environment, so knowing what the team atmosphere is like helps to get a sense for how well you'll get along, not only professionally, but also personally.

If you are in a situation like a wedding, sports event, dancing, live event then it can quite tough. A lot of those events have moments where you literally only get one shot to nail it. You can't ask people to re-exchange rings or re-do their first kiss. You have to be good at thinking on your feet and know how to change from light to dark / inside to outside in an instant. People will grab you for group shots and they don't care that you just set up to do a full room shot with a wide angle lens. You just have to know how to adapt & how best to take the shot.  Things like corporate head-shots, school photos, architecture & property images are very formulaic and you can get good results every time once you know the setup. There is time to take multiple shots, try experimental angles & do interesting work.  It also depends on what type of photographer you are - are you the type to take lots of photos in order to get those 'happy accident' style one-offs for your portfolio, or do you put attention into the set up, tweak lighting and settings and agonize over getting it right in camera. There's no right or wrong so long as you enjoy it - it's just important to go into the right area that will help you to turn it into a happy career.   Good luck!"

There's nothing wrong with playing video games or watching TV, but if you do it for 8 hours a day, it can become an escape rather than a relief.   (Weekly/biweekly/monthly) Do a job-search review: Give yourself some numbers: # of jobs applied for, # of interviews, # of call-backs, hours spent searching, applying, researching, pre-interview, post-interview. Then, observations & next steps: new interview questions to practice, new possible contacts, leads to follow-up on, skills worth learning or brushing up on. This can be depressing, but it's meant to show you how much work you've done/time you've spent, and also to allow you to brainstorm possible next actions for your search.    Good luck!  Remember that getting a job is like dating -- if he/she doesn't call you back that doesn't necessarily mean there's something wrong with you."

I took a look through your post history, and it seems like you're trying to break into the mj industry in CO.  Have you talked to anyone that's doing the job that you want to do? Did you ask them how they got their job?  I'm going to guess it's a industry that relies heavily on trust and relationships versus having super polished resumes and smart suits. If I were you, I'd really put the brunt of my efforts into building up my network in the field."
jobs,3e2dd7,pface,4,Tue Jul 21 21:35:31 2015 UTC,"I was once unemployed for over a year, so I understand what you're dealing with. Try to set goals that you have more control over; in my case I learned to run a 10k marathon. You can also take free courses online, volunteer or take part in free community events. I found that just having things to look forward to helped out a lot."

jobs,3e2dd7,madship,3,Tue Jul 21 13:12:11 2015 UTC,"I volunteered with a local startup event - it kept me moving day-to-day while gaining experience and skill, and had the added side benefit of letting me meet local business owners and see what was going on in my city. The startup scene is an interesting place that way, really open to any sort of background, and despite getting an unrelated job during that time I've kept my interest and still follow what's going on."

You can always keep searching and applying if you want to find better opportunities while working. Don't just quit the new job if you don't have anything lined up. Once you find a job with better pay etc, then give your two weeks notice."
