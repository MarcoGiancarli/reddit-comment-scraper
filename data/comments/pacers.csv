pacers,3e2geu,eckrueger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:53:16 2015 UTC,"This is tying it to a movie, not a team necessarily. There have been many great high school championship teams they didn't make movies about, they are somehow less important? Crispus Atticks was the first all-black school to win a state championship and then the first school to go undefeated in Indiana. Was Milan even that big of an underdog? They went to the semi-finals like a year before. I get the idea, I just think it's tying to the 30th anniversary of a movie is kind of silly."
pacers,3e2geu,MC_Carty,2,Tue Jul 21 19:18:28 2015 UTC,Was Milan even that big of an underdog?    Its like a town of 10 people.  Yes they were an underdog both years.  I am sorry they made a movie that is internationally recognized and revered about this particular team and not about Crispus Atticks.  My point still stands... this is Indiana History and it gives Indiana fans pride.  You can have pride in a movie based in your state.  Its a thing.

Having both him and Stuckey come off the bench will allow the starters to rest without sacrificing offense. If the Pacers got rid of him then Joe Young would have to play 15-20 minutes a game and he's not good enough for that yet.  I would rather wait and see what Lavoy Allen can do this year with his expanded role.
pacers,3dfqjn,Heeble-Fleeble,6,Wed Jul 15 22:45:26 2015 UTC,"I would definitely take this without even thinking.  People underrate Taj like crazy, but he can fill that David West hole we have and allow for PG to actually play the 3 instead of the 4 with Myles at center.  That being said, I can't see the Bulls ever agreeing to it"
pacers,3dfqjn,youngjabberwocker,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:18:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I doubt the Bulls would accept this trade. We would probably have to throw something else in to get Taj."
pacers,3dfqjn,LastedPants,8,Fri Jul 17 03:49:13 2015 UTC,Yes. In a cocaine heartbeat.

pacers,3dfqjn,LXKX,3,Wed Jul 15 23:16:01 2015 UTC,No
pacers,3dfqjn,XC_Stallion92,4,Wed Jul 15 23:29:25 2015 UTC,"No.  Miles is on a good contract and we have shed 3 longrange shooters already this off season.  picked up 2 potential long-range, but one is an untested rookie and the other is an average 3pt shooter.  we have 2 guards with iffy range.  Need to keep 2 3pt shooters on the floor at all times if at all possible to keep the paint clear.  Until I see a bigger sample I am going to assume Stuckey will decline in 3pt shooting this year.  add to that gibson is rather injured.  Chicago's depth at SF is worse then our front line."
pacers,3dfqjn,Drak_is_Right,4,Wed Jul 15 23:39:26 2015 UTC,I don't want to trade CJ.  His contract is great and he can defend and hit 3s.  Take him out and we lose one of our few good shooters.
pacers,3dfqjn,DonnieNarco,2,Thu Jul 16 04:22:23 2015 UTC,"How many guards do you all want? Currently we have George Hill, Monta Ellis, Rodney Stuckey, CJ Miles, and Joe Young, w/ PG having the ability to play the 2 as well. We currently have no starting PF and Taj is plenty capable of doing so, as well fit into whatever offense we'd like to run. This is a no brainer."
pacers,3dfqjn,ChrisBenRoy,3,Thu Jul 16 12:17:06 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I'd make the trade, especially since we just got Budinger. We have enough bodies at the 2/3 and no one special at the 4"
pacers,3dfqjn,honzoman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:34:13 2015 UTC,oh pg isn't special? good to know.
pacers,3dfqjn,burneezy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:20:10 2015 UTC,"He is special at the 3. He will be mismatched at the 4 position. He could do well, but he's not big enough to play starting minutes at the 4."
pacers,3dfqjn,anscmc,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:12:42 2015 UTC,"6' 10"" 240 is plenty big for 15-20 per at the 4"
pacers,3dfqjn,burneezy,2,Fri Jul 17 14:47:24 2015 UTC,"15-20 is not starting minutes. I do think they should split his minutes between the 3 and 4 however. Offensively, he should do great. It's  the defense that worries me. Bird will make it work. I have a lot of confidence in his decisions."
pacers,3dfqjn,anscmc,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:55:21 2015 UTC,"Floor spacing will become an issue if the Pacers only have 1 3pt threat on the floor.  Miles is that and is the only guard the Pacers have that can also play SF.  We have a total of 3 players I'd trust to shoot a 3 pt shot (G.Hill, P.George, C.Miles).  2 others who can maybe be trusted (C.Bundinger.  Stuckey shot 39% last year, but is a career 30.5%.  a 8.5% leap makes me wonder)"
pacers,3dfqjn,Drak_is_Right,2,Thu Jul 16 18:42:23 2015 UTC,I cant believe you would say no to this? Gibson is so underrated and you have a glaring hole at pf.
pacers,3dfqjn,Gettingbuckets,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:33:16 2015 UTC,I'd go for it. It just seems not worth it because we need his 3 point to shooting still and he had a great finish to the season.
pacers,3dfqjn,Gettingbuckets,2,Thu Jul 16 00:52:33 2015 UTC,Cool man i get the need for shooting but id love to see you guys with Gibson.

pacers,3dfqjn,scottw5150,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:59:11 2015 UTC,"No, and that's not anything against Taj. Miles makes half of what Taj makes. Miles at 4 mil per the next 3 seasons is so much more valuable than Taj at 8 mil for 2 season.  I'm pretty sure also that the Bulls and Pacers wouldn't trade with eachother.  Plus, I really would like to see Allen/Turner and even Shayne get some minutes."

pacers,3ddog6,Potomato,8,Wed Jul 15 15:10:49 2015 UTC,"I honestly feel Larry might have ruined this guys career lol. Now don't kill me, hear me out. He was never a good fit for the Pacers. He played great AGAINST us with the Knicks but his game never made sense for Vogel.. I knew he'd get buried on the bench. He is a valuable asset in the right situation, honestly he'd be better off in the west with a team like the Kings because George Karl don't give a fuck about defense lol. He was a hot commodity relatively speaking after his stint with the Knicks and I just think going to the Pacers completely fucked his career earnings when it's all said and done. Sorry Cope:/"

He's talking about some nonexistant feud between Larry and PG, and he's the same guy who did nothing but antagonize PG about not coming back sooner.

pacers,3ddgla,XC_Stallion92,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:37:30 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. He's far from alone. Jim Souhan in Minneapolis is worse.

pacers,3d9ye8,burneezy,11,Fri Jul 17 14:48:18 2015 UTC,Probably a slow start and a strong finish. I think hes going to average a bit over 20 ppg and maybe even less with Ellis. I think we have enough scorers this year to give him time to adjust early in the season.
pacers,3d9ye8,scottw5150,7,Tue Jul 14 17:30:42 2015 UTC,God like defense.  20ppg  4 rebounds  2 steals  98% from the line  45% from beyond the arc.
pacers,3d9ye8,materhern,11,Tue Jul 14 19:05:02 2015 UTC,"Slow down there, killer. If he play the 4 as much as has been implied I'd expect 6+ rebounds. Temper that FT% down to like 90 and a more realistic 40% from 3pt range. God like defense is a given."

pacers,3d9ye8,materhern,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:11:52 2015 UTC,agreed if he's gonna play PF we'll need him to get more than 4 boards a game. Plus he has a career average of 6 even with 7.6 and 6.8 in 12-13 and 13-14 respectively
pacers,3d9ye8,indytiger,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:52:57 2015 UTC,He averaged 7 rebounds in 13/14 at the SF. Why would he average 4 at the PF?

pacers,3d9ye8,OyarsaRPM,4,Tue Jul 14 19:18:32 2015 UTC,I expect 24 and 8. Is it a lot? Yes. Can he do it? Yes.
pacers,3d9ye8,pfc_bgd,4,Tue Jul 14 19:33:36 2015 UTC,Average 20ppg seems like a high but realistic goal. I would like to see him shoot a high % behind the arc and continue to be a lock down defender.
pacers,3d9ye8,aidsfarts,7,Tue Jul 14 18:13:42 2015 UTC,I don't think 20ppf is high...He was at ~22ppg when we played a much slower pace than what we're expected to play next year.
pacers,3d9ye8,pfc_bgd,3,Tue Jul 14 19:34:22 2015 UTC,"I expect he'll spend more time in the post. He's likely going to move around between positions as his game returns, changes, improves, et al.

pacers,3d9ye8,purduefan4,2,Wed Jul 15 00:14:50 2015 UTC,"I honestly hope he starts with a minutes restriction, like 25-30 mins a night.

pacers,3d9ye8,TonofSoil,6,Tue Jul 14 18:08:52 2015 UTC,"He shouldn't need a minute restriction at this point.  He will have had the same off season as everyone else, same work outs, and same stamina build up."
pacers,3d9ye8,materhern,3,Tue Jul 14 19:03:59 2015 UTC,"minutes restriction? I don't think there's any need for that what so ever. By the time the season starts, he should have more than 6 months of regular practice/training in his legs + pre season games. He should be fine.   Also, we have no clue why he hurt his other leg. It's easy to blame it on extra minutes, but there's no proof...not like we rode him for 40+ mins for multiple games."
pacers,3d9ye8,pfc_bgd,2,Tue Jul 14 19:31:59 2015 UTC,"We don't know for sure, no, but I'm pretty sure the injury was a result of overcompensating for the weakness in his right leg. It's extremely common for new injuries to occur during recovery from another injury--you're trying to reduce the amount of stress on the existing injury, so you end up stressing other parts of your body more than usual.  I don't think playing too many minutes was to blame. Just a weak right leg."
pacers,3d9ye8,Einsteiniac,2,Tue Jul 14 23:55:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think there was any risk of major injury. It was a risk taken to see if we could make the playoffs tho, which would have had the fans all hyped. Let's be honest!   I do agree it was stupid"

pacers,3d95pq,LastedPants,7,Tue Jul 14 13:57:40 2015 UTC,I'm kind of worried that they are serious about starting PG at the 4. I thought it would be spot minutes. Are they trying to ruin his career?
pacers,3d95pq,Pacers31Colts18,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:07:04 2015 UTC,"How exactly will it ruin his career? The average NBA PF is around PG's size IIRC. 6'9 230     We're going to play a positionless Spread 4 & Spread 5 offense. We will routinely have 3-4 ball handlers on the court with hopes that all 5 guys can shoot from distance as well. This is the way the NBA is headed and honestly, PG is the perfect guy to center it around. He's worlds better offensively than Draymond Greene & was arguably on the same tier defensively before the injury."
pacers,3d95pq,trilliam_clinton,0,Tue Jul 14 14:13:01 2015 UTC,"You are only looking at one side of the ball.  Lets say for example the Pacers are playing the Spurs.  Paul George will be dead tired by the second quarter if he has to defend Tim Duncan, LMA, and David West.  His numbers will plummet anytime he has to spend all his energy guarding some of the big front court guys in this game."
pacers,3d95pq,DayGrr,3,Tue Jul 14 14:17:30 2015 UTC,The Spurs are more of the exception than the rule. Only have to play them twice a year
pacers,3d95pq,MacDizzle,-1,Tue Jul 14 14:26:01 2015 UTC,There are some big Power Forwards in this league in the East as well.  PG isnt a 4.
pacers,3d95pq,DayGrr,3,Tue Jul 14 14:32:54 2015 UTC,"I doubt they'd put him up against a Zach Randolph or Lamarcus Aldridge, but against most other teams he matches up well."
pacers,3d95pq,Frostler,2,Tue Jul 14 21:34:09 2015 UTC,"He's  6'10"".  Thats enough to be a 4, if you want to put it that way.  I don't know if PG got some post game but it sounds like he has some new moves to put in play for this season.  If Larry says PG can, then he can.  Larry is not a mindless zombie."
pacers,3d95pq,ISUCKATKARMA,3,Tue Jul 14 15:13:49 2015 UTC,"Or....Tim Duncan, LMA & David West will be dog tired from chasing PG around screens, baseline cuts and PnRs. What's more laboring? A 30 year old 6'11 240 guy trying to chase one of the most athletic players in the league through a 20 screens a quarter, or a 24 year old 6'10 230Lb player defending 10 post ups a quarter?    How many teams left in the league have a PF comparable to any of those guys? Blake Griffin, Derrick Favors, Zach Randolph, Pau Gasol. That's it. The rest of the league starts a stretch 4 or starts a PF that lacks the offense/defense to match PG's output.  LB said it himself: ""We believe the positives we will gain offensively will far offset the negatives defensively. He can handle it."""
pacers,3d95pq,trilliam_clinton,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:44:29 2015 UTC,"David West, Chris Bosh, Dirk, Duncan, Anthony Davis, LMA, Blake Griffin, Kevin Love  Some of those guys may be considered stretch 4s....but they all are bigger than PG. Not to mention if your guarding the 4, you get switched on the 5 often."
pacers,3d95pq,DayGrr,2,Tue Jul 14 14:50:49 2015 UTC,"The best defensive player in the league this year was a 6'7 230 pound forward. The best defensive player of the modern era was a 6'7 210Lb forward.  I'm having a hard time seeing how our 6'10 230Lb forward ( a guy who 2 years ago was guarding the best player in the world better than anyone ever has) will struggle with ""size"" at a position where he's the catalyst for the league average size."
pacers,3d95pq,trilliam_clinton,0,Tue Jul 14 15:03:01 2015 UTC,"I have no clue what you're saying man...  You want to make Draymond Green out of PG? You want PG to spend so much energy on defense to only be able to play 30 mins per game? We NEED PG on offense and not to wrestle with PF who will constantly try to post him if for no other reason than to tire him out. Also, the best defensive player of the modern era is that guy in cleveland, but whatever.   You're also irrationally adding at least an inch to PG's height. And you somehow envision PG as being this power forward who runs off the screens and shit (that actually goes even beyond ""positionless basketball"")...Basically, you're keeping him as a SF on offense and somehow calling him a PF.   And finally...If PG is really developing some post moves (which he would have to do to even think about playing PF), why not utilize them against SFs first? You know, the way LeBrons has been doing it..."
pacers,3d95pq,pfc_bgd,2,Tue Jul 14 16:57:09 2015 UTC,"How much NBA have you watched recently?   Just because PG would be the ""4"" doesn't mean his offensive play style would change. He's not going to suddenly turn into LMA because he's the second tallest player on the court for us. Yes, I want PG playing like a SF on offense because that's what a small ball 4 is supposed to do!   LeBron or James Jones were frequently the 4 in Miami's spread 5 offense, and they were both still coming off screens or pin downs for open shots or open lanes.  Dirk, Kevin Love, Carmelo, Illyasova, Morris...they must not be 4s either since they come off screens to receive the ball Huh?  PG Grew 2 inches"
pacers,3d95pq,trilliam_clinton,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:43:39 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, the article is from 2011...and he's currently listed at 6-9 on nba.com and espn.com. So, where is that 6-10 you speak of?  Coming off A screen is one thing, but running off multiple screens like PG did up until the injury is completely different. It seems to me that's what you implied would be problematic for other PFs when it comes to guarding PG. But if you, for some reason, think that one screen for PG would be insolvable problems for elite power forwards, then I don't know what to tell you.   And no, small ball 4 still isn't playing like a SF."
pacers,3d95pq,pfc_bgd,-1,Tue Jul 14 20:54:34 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what your argument is. Best defensive player and best defensive power forward are two different things. Also LBJ is the best defensive player in the modern era and he is 6'8 about 250.
pacers,3d95pq,DayGrr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:14:31 2015 UTC,Dennis Rodman is the best defensive player of the modern era.   The argument is that size isn't the most important factor in defensive prowess. Intangibles and BBIQ are.
pacers,3d95pq,trilliam_clinton,0,Tue Jul 14 15:59:06 2015 UTC,Size may not be the most important factor but it has lead LBJ to 3 championships and helped him become this best player of this era.
pacers,3d95pq,DayGrr,-1,Tue Jul 14 16:12:10 2015 UTC,"I think your view of modern era is the whole lifespan of the NBA. In the last 15 years, he is the best defensive player. It's not even disputable. He could be in the argument as best of all time. I absolutely hate him but I don't deny stats. Nobody has dominated the league like he has except maybe Wilt lol"
pacers,3d95pq,DayGrr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:50:11 2015 UTC,Will PG be on a minutes restriction?
pacers,3d95pq,TonofSoil,0,Tue Jul 14 17:27:13 2015 UTC,It's especially weird if you consider the defensive assignment he will have and that the Pacers D has formerly not used double-teaming. Not sure this team will be strong enough defensively to stick with that principle.
pacers,3d95pq,TonofSoil,3,Tue Jul 14 14:42:45 2015 UTC,That is assuming PG actually starts at the 4. I don't expect him to start there. I could see maybe 10 minutes a game.
pacers,3d95pq,THE_BIG_SITT,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:14:41 2015 UTC,"I'm very interested to see what Vogel does with the starting lineup, I didn't expect PG to start at the 4 either."
pacers,3d95pq,THE_BIG_SITT,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:05:36 2015 UTC,Maybe start him at the 4 and hope we get off to a fast pace? Theoretically he would be better suited to defend 4s at the beginning of the game when he is fresh then when he is fatigued and the bigger guy can just back him down.
pacers,3d95pq,trilliam_clinton,3,Tue Jul 14 14:19:12 2015 UTC,"I imagine the starting lineup at the beginning of the season to be Hill/Ellis/Miles/PG/Hill. If Turner blossoms quickly, he could supplant Hill.     Bench mob of Stuckey, Budinger, Solo, Turner & Allen will give the flexibility to make drastic play style changes by subbing out GHill, Ellis or Miles for a big or another wing.     Ellis & PG are more than capable of handling the ball so GHill could be subbed out for a perimeter player or a big. Same goes for Ellis.    If Frank is willing to take chances, we could get real interesting with Hill, Ellis, Stuckey all on the court together on some bizarro Suns shit.     I'm really liking the versatility of this roster & hope that Frank takes full advantage."

Cannot imagine how frustrating it must have been for somebody as clutch and as competitive as Bird to watch Hibbs get all soft and scared and beaten puppy like in the playoffs.   I don't think Bird would have tolerated him as a teammate, and he definitely didn't want to tolerate him as the team president (or whatever his title is these days)."
pacers,3d7icb,pfc_bgd,9,Tue Jul 14 19:46:27 2015 UTC,"The Hibbert era Pacers were built around one goal: beat the Heat. Hibbert was the nearly perfect opposition for LeBron and Wade's driving to the basket so much. Hibbert originally got that mammoth contract because he averaged something like 22 and 10 against the Heat the first time they met and frustrated LeBron and Wade so much. Heck, The league created a rule based on Hubert's rim protection against the Heat.   However, those gaudy numbers soon turned to 10 points and 4 rebounds against teams like the Hawks and Wizard. Those teams exploited him by putting 5 shooters on the floor and making Hibbert guard the 3 point line while taking him away from the paint. More and more teams are going to that style now, making Hibbert's contract a hard pill to swallow when he is only playing 15 minutes and struggles getting 5 rebounds. Imagine how lost he would look in a 7 game series against the Warriors.  To add to all of that, he can't shoot outside of 10 feet. He clogs the lane when his teammates are driving to the basket. That isn't the worst thing in the world if you are super athletic like DeAndre Jordan or Dwight Howard. But Hibbert has no leaping ability and rarely pulls down offensive rebounds. So he is pretty much just taking up space on offense. Don't get me wrong, I love Hibbert and wish him the best. He brought some amazing excitement to the Pacers playoff run. But he the Pacers want to model their style after teams like the Warriors, Hawks and Spurs. Lots of movement and lots of shooting.  I personally think they should have kept him for the final year of his contract to have him help Turner into his role. But if they did that then they probably couldn't have signed Stuckey and Jordan Hill. So it's tough no matter what they did. Losing West will hurt more though."

pacers,3d7icb,ASAP-Cody,8,Tue Jul 14 15:14:16 2015 UTC,He played bad. Didn't try. Cost too much. It's pretty simple really.
pacers,3d7icb,hoseaa13,3,Tue Jul 14 03:21:12 2015 UTC,"He's one dimensional.  He can protect the rim.  But he can't score, can't pass, can't catch, can't rebound, and can't run the floor.  If you are getting paid 15M, you cannot be one dimensional.  Hibs had plenty of time to develop some other skills, but never did.  He's just too soft and too moody.  Which is why we'd see him simply disappear (including his rim protecting) at times.  Your play cannot depend on your mood."
pacers,3d7icb,materhern,3,Tue Jul 14 11:51:13 2015 UTC,"His offensive game never improved. Really the only thing he became good at was jumping straight up. He couldn't defend pick and rolls or one on one in space. He couldn't rebound. He couldn't score. He was slow and held back the offense. At times it looked like he didn't give a shit, which is unacceptable for someone making $15 mil a year.  With that said, yes it might set them back in the short term, but it will be better in the long term."

That is only 5 guards.   Depending on how you look at who is a 1 and who is a 2 (maybe irrelevant) they could either pickup another point guard type or go for more of a wing player, but I expect they will sign one more guard. They will also certainly add a power forward or tweener forward."
pacers,3d5am3,TonofSoil,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:25:37 2015 UTC,"I see no pure 1's in that list. I would like them to sign one, but I don't know who is left and Larry doesn't seem to like them anyway."

Obviously, his 3 point shooting needs improvement, but he'll get better looks with Monta, PG13, GH, CJ, and possibly Joe Young on the floor next year. I do not think he can share the floor with Stuckey unless one of them develops into a credible 3 point shooter.  He impressed me early in the 2014-15 season when he was playing PG because our injury situation. I think he's a smart player and smart players find a way to contribute in some way.  I suspect that even though LB is talking about playing PG at the PF, we'll see Solo guarding some 4s next year. But I have no evidence whatsoever to back that up."
pacers,3d4crv,Quickben33,6,Mon Jul 13 14:28:57 2015 UTC,I think this season is make or break for him. We need more consistency from him.
pacers,3d4crv,MoeAverage,3,Mon Jul 13 13:53:21 2015 UTC,"At worst case he is a solid defender off the bench. After dealing with the likes of Sam Young, Gerald Green, and Rasual Butler off the bench. I am happy to have Solo especially when we have so many offensive pieces on the wings right now."
pacers,3d4crv,scottw5150,3,Mon Jul 13 18:01:27 2015 UTC,"I think he's a very valuable piece honestly. Doesn't need the ball, doesn't have to score, defends, and is tough. Does the little things. I love him as a back up. His role was way too large last year. I think he could look good with a lot fewer minutes."
pacers,3d4crv,eckrueger,2,Tue Jul 14 03:50:37 2015 UTC,The only thing he needs now is consistency with his jump shot and finishing at the rim. I love his tenacity attacking the rim but he can't blow so many easy finishes there. I'm predicting a solid year of improvement from Solo.
pacers,3d4crv,Frostler,2,Mon Jul 13 21:37:14 2015 UTC,"He was dealing with an injury to his wrist during the summer league. His reasons for going there were the same as his reasons for playing for the Fort Wayne Mad Ants, just an opportunity to stay in shape and learn. He practically played for the first time last year and it wasn't so bad. Coming into his second year as an actual player and with this fast tempo the Pacers want to play i expect him to thrive. He works very hard and if it wasn't for his injured wrist he would have shot much better. There is a lot of pressure on him this year as it is a contract year for him but that's what the man lives for."
pacers,3d4crv,CiprianBuci,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:19:40 2015 UTC,He could be an all-star if he can keep improving.
pacers,3d4d5g,Pacers31Colts18,3,Mon Jul 13 12:41:08 2015 UTC,Crazy that PG is now the longest tenured Pacer
pacers,3d4d5g,Fosmoney,2,Mon Jul 13 17:30:18 2015 UTC,Looked in the slideshow and noticed paul is almost as tall as myles turner. Should be interesting seeing them in the frontcourt together.
pacers,3d0ui3,btirumala,9,Sun Jul 12 16:03:46 2015 UTC,"This narrative has to stop.  First off, West and Hibbert's play last year was evident that something needed to change. Do you know who led the team in shooting percentage? Ian Mahinmi with .552. Next was George Hill(.477), Lavoy Allen(.472) and finally West was 4th at .471. If you change that to 2P% rather than total, West moves down to 6th and Hibbert's 2P% was 13th on the team... THIRTEENTH for shooting percentage.  So let's try rebounds. Going by per 36 minutes to try to eliminate people skewing the stats based on playing time, the top rebounder for the team was Scola at 11.4 per 36 minutes. Then Mahinmi(11.2), Allen(10.9) and then Roy at 10.1 West is 7th.  The only thing that Hibbert/West have ANY high marks in is Hibbert's blocking percentage where he led the team in blocks per 36 minutes. But as far as Drtg goes... Mahinmi actually had a better Drtg than Hibbert last year.    Bottom line, I know that stats don't tell everything, but when you look at the big picture you realize that while we will miss Roy's adjustment of shots, he wasn't even remotely the player we had 2 years ago. Last year in the playoffs we won in spite of Roy going 0/0/0 in a game and not showing up at all in two playoff series.  Meanwhile West chose to go somewhere else. We didn't choose to lose him but he decided he didn't want to stay. It hurts a little, but looking at the pickup of Ellis and Young/Turner's shots, I think our offense will be ok.  I see us getting 5th/6th in the playoffs this year."
pacers,3d0ui3,NateThomas1979,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:31:48 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more. If they were that dominant they could have carried the team last season without PG. But their production, instead of increasing, actually got worse!  I would have been OK with Roy sticking around for one more year in a decreased capacity, but everything that's happened with those two has been for the best."
pacers,3d0ui3,TonofSoil,7,Mon Jul 13 15:06:57 2015 UTC,"The minute I see Myles Turner rise up and dunk over some dude holding two arms up and not jumping, I'm gonna say, ""hey, remember when hook shots were effective?"""

pacers,3d0ui3,Mr_Geniusman,27,Sun Jul 12 18:25:34 2015 UTC,A game away from the finals?
pacers,3d0ui3,theconmeister,-7,Sun Jul 12 18:28:05 2015 UTC,So almost is good enough for you? Are you fine with 2 straight years of being one or two games away? Then a season not even making the playoffs in the east? Having a big and bad frontcourt doesn't work in this league.
pacers,3d0ui3,Mr_Geniusman,10,Sun Jul 12 19:52:00 2015 UTC,"I am fine with being one or two games away, we were in serious contention for a title and it was and is a great time to be a Pacers fan. We could have competed last year with a healthy PG. Obviously the ultimate goal is a championship and it sucks that we couldn't get past Lebron but we gave it a damn good shot. Our defense was at a championship level and Roy was arguably the most responsible."
pacers,3d0ui3,theconmeister,2,Sun Jul 12 21:42:34 2015 UTC,This is so extremely ignorant!
pacers,3d0ui3,johnnyu19,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:44:54 2015 UTC,"How? We had the best front court duo in the league, David and Roy, at the time and we got stopped 3 times in a row by the smaller and faster heat...I'm not saying it wasn't fun and exciting, I'm saying smash mouth doesn't work anymore. Not with the officiating in the league now. It worked back in the 80's when we didn't have soft flagrant fouls"
pacers,3d0ui3,Mr_Geniusman,2,Mon Jul 13 00:30:51 2015 UTC,"Yes those two were probably in the Top 5 best front court duos at the time, but you cant say that it doesn't work in our league. The only way to beat a smaller and faster team is with a bigger more physical one. The problem was that Hibbert and West had terrible contracts, and we had no money to pay for a bench. We could have saved AT LEAST a few million with just two better contracts, and would have spent that on one true 6th man ex.(CJ Miles or Stuckey) or two solid backups. Instead of paying Rasual Butler and Chris Copeland to play 10min/ a game in the '14 ECF, or even fucking Evan Turner to ride the bench. In summary we had BY FAR the best Starting 5 in the NBA in '14 but you gotta have a bench to win in the playoffs."
pacers,3d0ui3,johnnyu19,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:05:34 2015 UTC,I agree with everything except the beating a smaller team with being bigger. It only works with bigs that can stretch the floor and guard the three. Those are few and far between.
pacers,3d0ui3,Mr_Geniusman,2,Mon Jul 13 01:34:23 2015 UTC,"Okay, maybe I shouldn't have said that was the ONLY way. Yes that works in beating smaller teams. , but if you have a C that keeps players from scoring in the paint as consistently as Hibbert does it makes up for not having those stretch players. I guess it comes down to which style of ball you prefer, I feel like one is not better than the other. The Spurs have won countless championships playing without any stretch bigs"
pacers,3d0ui3,johnnyu19,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:56:30 2015 UTC,"If roy could have returned to his 2012 self, then yes. He was an absolute monster. The spurs negated their lack of a stretch big by being balls deep.."
pacers,3d0ui3,Mr_Geniusman,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:47:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah they are definitely balls deep every year, its amazing they are still playing at the level they are."
pacers,3d0ui3,johnnyu19,2,Mon Jul 13 14:00:09 2015 UTC,"teams rarely went ""small"" at the 4 against West.  The problem was centers who could drag Hibbert out.  No, the problem was mentally the Pacers killed themselves. in 2013-2014.  They stopped playing like a team and the offense went into the crapper.  West was an unusual PF - and a counter - to smallball.  Very few 4s who are that strong, have a post game, but can also hit the mid-range shot."
pacers,3d0ui3,Drak_is_Right,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:00:00 2015 UTC,"Smash mouth from what I have seen does counter small ball, but only if the PF has both excellent strength, a post game, and a mid-range shot while having enough quickness to not be a complete liability on defense.  Half dozen to dozen possessions and the SF will be worn down trying to defend a brute PF in the post.  Trying to wrestle for position against a guy far stronger then you is about the quickest way in the NBA to tire yourself out."
pacers,3d0ui3,Drak_is_Right,0,Mon Jul 13 08:07:57 2015 UTC,Wow it's like almost is same thing as never giving ourselves a shot at all!
pacers,3d0ui3,ISUCKATKARMA,3,Sun Jul 12 20:49:27 2015 UTC,"like we will get bullied by the frontcourt in the east    By who exactly? The east has pretty weak frontcourts across the board, theres only 3-4 teams in the east that have big men that can score and dominate the post."
pacers,3d0ui3,Airegus,2,Sun Jul 12 18:31:50 2015 UTC,"I don't get the thought that we won't make the playoffs.  It will be a low seed, but I can't believe some of the predictions saying we'll only win 20 some games.  Our front court is a weakness, but our backcourt is great and has awesome depth.  Mahinmi can guard, Hill and Budinger can rebound, Lavoy is good on the offensive glass, and Turner looks like he can score pretty well.  No one really stands out, or frankly should be on a contender's starting lineup, but there's a lot of balance and versatility there."
pacers,3d0ui3,yobramine,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:46:02 2015 UTC,The eastern conference will be more competitive I think that's why there is maybe a 30% chance we don't make the playoffs.  We will definitely win more than 20 games though lol.
pacers,3d0ui3,aidsfarts,2,Tue Jul 14 01:23:27 2015 UTC,We can't do anything right now. It will be front court by committee this season to see how this new team gels and how PG handles the four. Turner will grow and hopefully we will show a big FA next season we are one piece away from being serious contenders.

pacers,3cy0jk,worldrace,10,Sat Jul 11 20:17:27 2015 UTC,"I don't know what the situation is with your team's salary cap, especially with Hibbert gone, but I think Chase is worth the risk on an expiring contract.   He really struggled recovering from tearing his meniscus in 2012 and finally started to look 100% the last ~25 games this past season. His post-ASB numbers compare pretty well to what he was putting up pre-injury.    Season Games MPG FG% 3PT% TS% RPG PTS    2011-12 (Houston) 58 22.4 44.2 40.2 55.6 3.7 9.6   2015 Post-ASB 23 27.4 49.2 38.6 60.3 3.9 11.3    With another off-season to recover I was expecting him to keep this up. Everything I've heard is that he's a good locker room guy too. He had been pretty bad for us since getting injured, but I think he turned the corner and I'm kind of disappointed we didn't wait until the deadline to pull the trigger. Hope he plays well for you guys!"
pacers,3cy0jk,MarryMeFrisbee,5,Sat Jul 11 20:35:53 2015 UTC,"Good stuff, you've sold me. Rudez is one dimensional, but his one dimension is really solid. He can flat-out shoot the 3."

pacers,3cy0jk,TonofSoil,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:18:50 2015 UTC,I doubt Rudez would have gotten any PT anyways.  It seems like a low level player swap that probably won't have any significant impact.
pacers,3cy0jk,materhern,2,Sat Jul 11 20:20:42 2015 UTC,"I don't know. Budinger may get PT over Solo. Also, Budinger is making 5 million a year, considerably more than Rudez."

pacers,3cy0jk,Frostler,2,Sat Jul 11 22:06:06 2015 UTC,"Damjan is at ~$1.1mil and Budinger is ~$5mil.  Not sure about this either, but I think he could do well if he doesn't have any injury issues here.  He is also on an expiring contract."
pacers,3cy0jk,Smart_Dumb,5,Sat Jul 11 22:28:11 2015 UTC,"I don't mind this trade, his shooting is worse but I think Budinger is a more well-rounded player. Our bench is going to be pretty deep which will be nice: Stuckey/Miles/Budinger/Allen/Mahinmi and a starting 5 of Ellis/Hill/Hill/George/Turner isn't too bad depending on how good Myles Turner is.  Hopefully Joe Young is good enough to find some minutes too."
pacers,3cy0jk,tpcrb,5,Sat Jul 11 20:59:43 2015 UTC,I would start Miles over Solo.

pacers,3cx178,eckrueger,2,Sat Jul 11 16:06:09 2015 UTC,"my thoughts exactly.  Both Hill and Mahimi are good ""reserve centers"".  Turner is probably your 4th best front court player right now, after Hill, Mahimi, and Allen.  Allen again is a second string player.  I don't see our reserves suffering, but barring a huge season from one of those 4 (or maybe Shane, who knows - but that is more doubtful) - we will get killed on the front line this year when our starters are out there.  I sure hope the Pacers manage to kill it at the mismatches this year, because a traditional front line as the starting unit will get us to the lottery unless Turner is ROY."

pacers,3cx178,ISUCKATKARMA,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:10:29 2015 UTC,"We have to fill out the roster so we'll  probably do a couple smaller signings in FA; but, I bet we make a big move/signing early to mid season using that trade exception."
pacers,3cx178,yobramine,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:06:02 2015 UTC,"Pacers don't like the luxury tax, I don't see that trade exception being very valuable."
pacers,3cx178,Drak_is_Right,3,Sat Jul 11 18:33:37 2015 UTC,"Trade exceptions count against the cap, but they do not count against the luxury tax.  So if I understand correctly, we will not be pushed into the luxury tax if we use our trade exception."
pacers,3cx178,jumpshot22,3,Sat Jul 11 20:23:42 2015 UTC,you are 100% correct.  Especially given the cap jump next year we are going to use this to get a guy imo
pacers,3cvrf9,AlienDeg,3,Sat Jul 11 04:34:27 2015 UTC,I REALLY hope they give him the backup point guard spot.
pacers,3cvrf9,THE_BIG_SITT,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:15:36 2015 UTC,"He and Turner have gelled nicely already.  They're both sending nice passes to each other and reading each other's movements, creating lots of good shots.  Young's gonna have a hard time getting minutes with how deep the Pacers' bench is, but I hope he gets a shot."
pacers,3cui1e,bballfan65,6,Fri Jul 10 21:51:43 2015 UTC,I frickin love this guy! I was extremely happy when we drafted him and this has just reaffirmed my joy. I can really see him turning into something special
pacers,3cui1e,PeetaChip,3,Fri Jul 10 22:29:46 2015 UTC,"I watched him in just about every game he played in at Oregon. He has exceptional play making ability and leadership skills. He can take over games, and he excels in big time situations. With that said, he needs to clean up some of his sloppy passing/ball handling. I think he has what it takes, though!"
pacers,3cui1e,Woahbrono,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:33:13 2015 UTC,Good
pacers,3cui1e,h3isenburg,0,Sat Jul 11 03:35:58 2015 UTC,"I think there is a good chance he is our starting PG in a couple years.  As a scorer, I think he's already there.  But he needs to work on his perimeter defense, and his passing.  He seems like he's seeing the court well.  He sees the great passes to be made, just doesn't make them quick and crisp and ends up turning it over.    Those things can be fixed.  His natural court vision and ability to find the crease are impressive even this early on just in SL.  He could end up being another PG type pick up.  Not one of the top picks in the draft but ending up a star player."
pacers,3cui1e,materhern,2,Mon Jul 13 12:43:35 2015 UTC,PG was drafted 10th. He wasn't a late pickup he was a lottery player. Hope that he breaks out like lance tho but better
pacers,3ctf85,Imthefatmann,5,Fri Jul 10 17:05:02 2015 UTC,"I am definitely interested in picking him up. I think if you could land Faried, it makes the front court a lot more appealing than in it's current state. Plus, his athleticism fits the bill of what the Pacers are attempting to do moving forward.   Also, his name doesn't overlap a Hill or a George or a Miles/Myles, so bonus points."
pacers,3ctf85,TheRyanExpress86,8,Fri Jul 10 17:26:32 2015 UTC,"Also, his name doesn't overlap a Hill or a George or a Miles/Myles, so bonus points.   Yeah? Well, you know, that's just like your opinion, man."
pacers,3ctf85,XC_Stallion92,2,Fri Jul 10 19:20:12 2015 UTC,I personally think Faried should change his first name to Hill.
pacers,3ctf85,MagiClipPaceRaps,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:49:52 2015 UTC,So then it would be 'Kenneth Hill' --> 'Kenny Hill' --> 'Kenny Trill'
pacers,3ctf85,Heynong-Man,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:25:46 2015 UTC,Hill Myles George Faried III....I just threw the III in there to make it sound regal. Or somethin'.
pacers,3ctf85,TheRyanExpress86,6,Mon Jul 13 16:56:39 2015 UTC,"Nuggets arent giving him up for nothing.   Also, he is a negative defensive player."
pacers,3ctf85,Sheffield178,5,Fri Jul 10 17:55:52 2015 UTC,"Lineups with Faried/JHill would mean insane rebounding, but a wide open door on defense.  His contract is also ~$11mil and is locked in until 18/19, so if he flops with us, then we've got another overpay hurting us in the long run."
pacers,3ctf85,yobramine,2,Fri Jul 10 18:01:40 2015 UTC,"a wide open door on defense   You don't think Frank and the staff can work on JHill and Faried's D? If we're going to be playing faster, and taking quicker shots, having these guys pound the glass would be awesome."
pacers,3ctf85,Quickben33,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:02:32 2015 UTC,I think 11/per is great for 4 years given the current salary cap situation that is only going up.
pacers,3ctf85,at2wells,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:10:22 2015 UTC,"And I have just learned we have a $15.5 mil trade exception that we got in the Hibbert trade.  I say we wait and see what hole in our roster needs the most fixing and then use it (though it clearly looks like it will be PF), but I will not be mad if we use it to get Faried."
pacers,3ctf85,yobramine,2,Fri Jul 10 18:16:06 2015 UTC,"Well, we have that 15.4M trade exception now.  Wonder what the chance of a sign and trade for him is."
pacers,3ctf85,materhern,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:43:58 2015 UTC,"Who's being signed in the S&T?  Faried is starting the first year of the 4 year, $50m extension he signed before last year."
pacers,3ctf85,herrkaizer87,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:10:18 2015 UTC,"Oh, well then maybe a straight up trade would work.  Either way was wondering if we could fit him in with the trade exception."
pacers,3ctf85,materhern,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:11:34 2015 UTC,"You can break a trade exception up over the course of a season, so even if he was still on his old contract, the Pacers could have traded for him and had a chunk of the exception left.  As it is, if we could trade for him, we would still have ~$4m left of the exception, assuming we don't send any players back."
pacers,3ctf85,herrkaizer87,2,Fri Jul 10 18:17:34 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I think we need a more offensive minded big. I get going small and playing Hill, Ellis, George, Hill, Faried, and that defense would be okayish, but I think we need to score more than we currently look to be able to."
pacers,3ctf85,CatzonVinyl,4,Fri Jul 10 19:15:05 2015 UTC,that'd be about as perfect of a pick up as I can think of...not sure if it's realistic at all tho. What's his contract situation?
pacers,3ctf85,pfc_bgd,2,Fri Jul 10 17:14:08 2015 UTC,"Completely agree, I've been thinking about that all week. We would have to give up A TON to get him though. And I don't think picks would cut it like most people have been suggesting. I just don't see who we'd be willing to give up to snag him."
pacers,3ctf85,Chuck_Wilson,3,Fri Jul 10 17:18:18 2015 UTC,"Remember though, his situation isn't good in Denver. Similar to Roy being here. They are ready to get rid of him and Lawson"
pacers,3ctf85,Anicole2196,2,Fri Jul 10 17:23:32 2015 UTC,"Who would we realistically give up to get both Lawson and Faried?? I would love to have both, but I can't imagine we can make it happen without losing a lot..."
pacers,3ctf85,MagiClipPaceRaps,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:57:39 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. I just know Denver doesn't want them anymore, etc"
pacers,3ctf85,Anicole2196,-3,Fri Jul 10 18:35:34 2015 UTC,I suggested g hill/j hill but no one seemed to like that so what about ellis/j hill plus draft pick?
pacers,3ctf85,caucasiansensation,5,Fri Jul 10 18:23:47 2015 UTC,lol Ellis isn't going anywhere.
pacers,3ctf85,XC_Stallion92,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:18:10 2015 UTC,Obviously none of this is going happen
pacers,3ctf85,caucasiansensation,2,Fri Jul 10 22:21:06 2015 UTC,"I think G. Hill, Turner, Ellis, PG13 and Stuckey are hands-off for this."
pacers,3ctf85,ISUCKATKARMA,2,Fri Jul 10 18:48:29 2015 UTC,"Except for Bird has said multiple times that he is interested in putting PG into the 4 position. Why are we trying to go back to the same scheme that we have done the past 3-4 years when the counter to that scheme, i.e. small ball, is the way that the league is going?  I get that we need a few more solid big men if we can get them, but I'm not sure why we're trying to put our new center as a 4 and picking up another guy to fill a position that is counter to where the Pacers are headed."
pacers,3ctf85,NateThomas1979,4,Fri Jul 10 18:02:31 2015 UTC,"PG isn't playing the 4 all game.  It'll be probably only be 10-15 minutes of small ball lineups to improve scoring with bench-heavy units, where we've struggled in the past.  If PG gets back to playing 35 minutes per game, there's plenty of time remaining where he will be his normal perimeter 3 with Ellis and Hill, and Faried can be a rebounding machine inside."
pacers,3ctf85,herrkaizer87,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:15:44 2015 UTC,I'm thinking that's why we just picked up Jordan Hill?
pacers,3ctf85,NateThomas1979,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:16:46 2015 UTC,"Jordan Hill will probably be our small ball 5 for those 15-20 minute stretches, or when Mahinmi isn't on the court.  I don't particularly see any frontcourt players on the Pacers I'd want seeing play more than 20-25 minutes per game right now, and I don't know that Faried would be an exception to that, but it never hurts to add energy and rebounding."
pacers,3ctf85,herrkaizer87,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:21:48 2015 UTC,And that's fair.  I like him I just would want to see what the terms would be
pacers,3ctf85,NateThomas1979,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:39:34 2015 UTC,"Young, Stuckey, Miles, George, and J.Hill...that would be an interesting small-ball lineup.  Still, PG lacks the weight to serve too much time in the 4 if they are playing a PF with much strength.  Stretch 4s though I think can really be exposed by small-ball lineups as the SFs can close out on their 4s but they often lack the foot speed to keep up while not having the strength to take advantage of the smaller size of the SF in the post.  One thing I do miss about West is his ability to shut down the small-ball by demolishing the opposing small forward in the post with his strength.  Not even the Heat would go for very long against us in small-ball as they didn't want to tire Lebron with trying to guard D.West, one of the few PFs in the league that had a strength advantage against him."
pacers,3ctf85,Drak_is_Right,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:53:10 2015 UTC,"I would assume Bird is basing PG playing the 4 on watching players like Harrison Barnes serve that role for Golden State, and not asking him to play off of the likes of Blake Griffin and Zach Randolph.  I would also assume that Bird's plan includes a lot of switching, which will help in PnR defense since PG can definitely defend against most guards in the league."
pacers,3ctf85,herrkaizer87,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:39:41 2015 UTC,Randolph is not a fun matchup for most PFs
pacers,3ctf85,Drak_is_Right,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:52:48 2015 UTC,"Faried can get out and run. He's not a classic back to the basket big, as his post moves are somewhat limited. Im not sure how I feel about him, but I dont think bringing him in runs counter to what Larry is currently tying to do."
pacers,3ctf85,at2wells,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:11:41 2015 UTC,"Oh no I meant more of putting faired at the 4 and pg at the 3.  It sounds as if the OP is stuck thinking we are going to play the same slow it down,  defensive stopping team that we've been for a while rather than an uptempo team that has been indicated we are moving towards."
pacers,3ctf85,NateThomas1979,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:13:45 2015 UTC,"I love the manimal, but could we land him in terms of cap room, etc?"
pacers,3ctf85,busche916,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:33:40 2015 UTC,Yeah. The issue would be what we'd have to give up.
pacers,3ctf85,XC_Stallion92,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:21:12 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't want Lawson we'd have to give up to much and George Hill is on the rise. Faried would be perfect for small ball lineups he's basically the same position as dramon green he can play the 3,4,& 5 (most likely wouldn't ever play 3 tho but he could)"
pacers,3ctf85,Swagboi9,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:30:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly I am not excited about either S.Hill or Rudez getting more then role minutes.  Would prefer to see PG at the 3 unless CJ Miles or Ellis slid over to cover it in small ball.  G. Hill, Miles, Ellis/Stuckey, George....."
pacers,3ctf85,Drak_is_Right,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:00:53 2015 UTC,I say we trade mahimi and solo for faried
pacers,3ctf85,gavingru,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:55:23 2015 UTC,"even though his offensive game sucks, kenneth faried is a perfect fit for right now. I still think we need a pass-first point guard. I hope we can sign mannimal."
pacers,3ctcbk,H4pl0,3,Fri Jul 10 16:43:08 2015 UTC,"I like the Joe Young pick, but he's still got a ways to go to contribute. Hope people aren't expecting him to come in on fire this year. He needs some more PG skills. Too small for SG. Love the scoring though."
pacers,3ctcbk,eckrueger,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:58:25 2015 UTC,"TBF, he's not that small. I mean Kyrie is only 6 ft 3 (Young is 6 ft 2). There are a lot of shoot first PGs in the NBA that did pretty well for themselves."
pacers,3ctcbk,eckrueger,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:25:37 2015 UTC,No he isn't tiny but he's pretty thin. Kyrie has 15 pounds on joe. He'll learn. It'll just be a little while.
pacers,3ctcbk,GrandBasterd,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:10:54 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I watched his first SL game. He was shooting the lights out at first, but his decision making wasn't great, he got trapped a bunch and seemed to only pass as his last option."
pacers,3ctcbk,paradocs,2,Fri Jul 10 19:28:15 2015 UTC,Dan Burke said in an interview that he just got to the team and didn't have time to learn any plays before the first game.  So he just went out and shot it.
pacers,3ctcbk,eckrueger,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:18:34 2015 UTC,"He was always a two guard I believe so it'll take some time to learn point. He had been sick though, right up until the first game."
pacers,3ctcbk,WTF_RANDY,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:08:13 2015 UTC,I think there is are a lot of reasons to be optimistic about this kid. He is shooting better than 50% from 3 has 4 assists per game and is 2nd in scoring in Orlando. He does have a long way to go no doubt but I find his efficiency to be the most important and impressive thing about his game so far.

pacers,3ctphr,yobramine,4,Fri Jul 10 18:19:04 2015 UTC,Trade exception=pure gold in this situation considering our cheap-ass owner.  Not a terrible trade in the end.
pacers,3ctphr,MC_Reagan,2,Fri Jul 10 18:19:46 2015 UTC,Herb Simon is the cheapest owner in sports.
pacers,3ctphr,TonofSoil,13,Fri Jul 10 19:15:09 2015 UTC,"Dude that comment is absurd. He isn't that cheap. Pacers are one of the least valuable franchises (21st) I posted this months ago regarding Simon:   ""Everyone talks about how cheap he is, but the tax is there and at its current level to dissuade owners from paying it. It's efficacy is the point of its existence. Sorry if owners running a business interest don't want to lose money.The Simons didn't get rich wasting their money. I would also point out that the Pacers are not one of the most valuable or profitable franchises, to say the least.  BUT it's worth noting that the Pacers have the 14th highest payroll in the league this year and last year they ranked even higher. The Pacers are currently over 10 million dollars over the salary cap and are just under the luxury tax level. Simon isn't that cheap!"""

pacers,3ctphr,ISUCKATKARMA,3,Fri Jul 10 18:20:39 2015 UTC,They raise the cap for us.  So say we get someone for $10 mil in a trade.  That'll put us over the cap but we won't have to pay luxury tax because it'll go into the trade exception.  Gives us a lot more flexibility this year when we can get the chance.  Larry is really pulling out all the stops.
pacers,3ctphr,ISUCKATKARMA,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:47:05 2015 UTC,"Yep.  I'm surprised Bird managed to pull this off.  If this is rebuilding mode, then Bird has been accelerating it like crazy.  Great pieces all around from FA and draft, and now we've secured flexibility during the season.  We may not act on it all, but it's a good feeling to have that exception."

pacers,3cstj8,gugargioni,3,Fri Jul 10 15:02:42 2015 UTC,"If they do go for a backup PG, I thought of Ridnour too. Always kind of liked him, but looking at his stats he hasn't been a regular backup in years. Still like him and maybe he could show Joe Young the ropes.  It would be cool if they could snag Kendall Marshall."
pacers,3cstj8,MrGoodness,4,Fri Jul 10 15:18:39 2015 UTC,What about Donald Sloan as backup pg? I thought he was decent last year in that role.
pacers,3cstj8,deadprezrepresentme,2,Fri Jul 10 15:38:33 2015 UTC,Would love KJ but he's kind of redundant.  They either need shooting or help in the post.  Teletovic wouldv'e been great.  I wouldn't mind Jimmer myself.
pacers,3cstj8,Drak_is_Right,5,Fri Jul 10 15:54:24 2015 UTC,Need a true second string point guard to handle the ball.  Preferably one with 3-pt range.  As seen last year - Stuckey works best with a second point guard.  Last spot can be left open for a vet min if we have injury problems.
pacers,3cstj8,Imthefatmann,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:52:20 2015 UTC,I think Donald Sloan would fit the bill here.  I see the Pacers more than likely resigning him after we find another power forward.
pacers,3cstj8,paradocs,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:08:44 2015 UTC,So what do you think the starting roster will be now?  Starting 5:   G. Hill Ellis P. George J. Hill Mahinmi   2nd 5:   Stucky Miles (? start over J. Hill to go small) Rudez Turner Allen J. Young - could play up if they really need PG ball handling Cope Whittington

pacers,3csppw,Victory33,0,Fri Jul 10 13:59:17 2015 UTC,"I still have worries, he was pretty garbage on offense last year and didn't show signs of improvement as the season went on. The Summer league doesn't change my mind one way or another, I just don't see him ever becoming an offensive threat. He's not a great shooter or slasher."
pacers,3csppw,NOTtrentRICHARDSON,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:41:21 2015 UTC,I think he can be a good pro. It takes a few years for these guys to find their NBA game. Solo has a good head on his shoulders and seems to have the potential. I just hope he starts he takes another step this year offensively.

pacers,3cqnav,ReggieTime,4,Fri Jul 10 02:08:09 2015 UTC,"I think its more than fair for us.  Some people were talking about the Pacers possibly giving up a draft pick to dump him.  Its all about the contract for Roy...His massive salary limited the number of teams that could take him on this season.  Also depends on how you look at it, we get a 2nd round pick + a player or players equivalent to $15m salary cap hit for this season, which gives us more flexibility and the possibility of trading for an asset at some point before the deadline.  I think to justify keeping Roy, we would have to expect him to have a major breakout season on a contract year.  Let's be honest with ourselves and admit that we have seen just about all that Roy is capable of...his numbers will probably improve this season, but in no way is he the player that turns us from a competitor to a champion."

pacers,3cqnav,swampking,0,Fri Jul 10 04:34:52 2015 UTC,"He will provide great D for the Lakers and he's worth a little more than a 2nd round pick TO THE LAKERS... imo. To us, the Pacers, his D is good because of system and his value, IMO, is none to the Pacers. Why do you think Bird is giving him away for nothing. Absolutly nothing. 5 picks in the history of the NBA had a good pick in the 2nd round. Larry knows that he's giving hibbert away for free and he obviously doesn't care. I'm so glad he is doing that. It sends a message to Roy that he's garbage and he shouldn't have opted in. (obviously anyone including me would've taken that money; however, business decision wise, Larry made the best move possible by dumping him.)"
pacers,3cqnav,h3isenburg,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:46:57 2015 UTC,No team was going to offer a 1st rounder for Roy. And you're not getting another player to trade straight up for his contract as we don't want to keep that kind of money off of the table.   The best we could get for Roy is 2 2nd rounders and even then odds are no one was going to do that. Otherwise we simply keep Roy to the end of the year and completely lose him without gaining anything back.

pacers,3cqnav,TweetPoster,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:13:13 2015 UTC,Yeah it's not necessarily a bad move along as they do something beneficial with the extra cap room.

He doesn't have a long range game, and his mid range is streaky. But he was a rebound machine. So-so defense from what I can remember. I want Allen to get some minutes to see what he can actually do.

pacers,3cqyh8,sayheykid24,15,Fri Jul 10 01:48:27 2015 UTC,His passing is fine it's his catching you should be worried about.
pacers,3cqyh8,irollbrokenfingers,3,Fri Jul 10 01:52:34 2015 UTC,He can pass the ball back out to the perimeter from the post decently and hand the ball off to the guards and thats about it. Every other pass to make is nonexistent for Roy. He has a hard time finding cutters to the basket and keeping his head up while backing down in the post. I definitely agree with the catching part.

pacers,3cscqn,caucasiansensation,10,Fri Jul 10 11:22:56 2015 UTC,"Well... I mean, we'd screw ourselves over instead for the future.  I'm not against bringing Lawson here but I mean... we have George Hill already.  He knows our system inside out and he's starting to hit his peak.  Why would we want to give him up for Lawson, who's been running into trouble lately and is passing his peak soon (as unfortunate it is)?  I'm not opposed to Faried either, but I don't see the benefits of adding yet another mystery cog to our massive roster overhaul.  We have to figure out the new team identity with West and Hibbert gone now... might as well just take this year to see what the roster can do, and then see if Faried will fit or not.  I think we're done for the FA other than the bench-warmers, so I'd rather just roll with what we have right now and just wait until FA next year to see what this team really is first."
pacers,3cscqn,ISUCKATKARMA,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:16:53 2015 UTC,"I agree George hill had a great year last year and i really like him as a player, but i feel like that was mainly because of the absence of pg. With pg back g hill will be forced to go back to being a pure point guard, which isnt his natual position.  As for lawson passing his prime, he is actually younger than g hill and is about as pure a point guard as there is in the league.  And we all saw at fifa what an absolute force a inspired faried can be. These guys are top 5 caliber players at their respective positions, they are just in a bad system and playing uninspired ball right now.  Gaining chemistery would a challenge, but 82 games is plenty of time to get it figured out (especially in a weak easter conference)"
pacers,3cscqn,ISUCKATKARMA,5,Fri Jul 10 12:54:32 2015 UTC,I think calling them top 5 for their positions is a bit of a reach but I can see hour reasoning.  I think the deal is a bit too much especially how everyone is lowballing the Nuggets right now.  I'm sure they'd already take a deal if there was one already.
pacers,3cscqn,poorchris,3,Fri Jul 10 13:57:13 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one who thinks George Hill is better or equal to Ty Lawson anyway?  He really came into his own last year when the team was struggling and dealing with tons of injuries (he even dealt with a series of injuries).  In limited minutes GH was still scoring and shooting efficiently, running offense well.  He's a familiar piece of Indiana's team and he's also an above average defender (which Lawson is not).  Plus Lawson's undersized so with him and Monta together you'd have two pretty redundant guards in the backcourt and both would be easily exploited on D.    Think of the size mismatch that would pose on Eastern Conference backcourts, Rose/Butler, Dragic/Wade, MCW/Middleton etc.  Even a young, pedestrian Point Guard like MCW has enough size to isolate and bully a guard who's significantly smaller than him.  It's hard to hide defensively when your backcourt is 6' tall.  Especially when the trade off on offense isn't worth it IMO.  Faried would obviously be a great get, with Indy's current need for a 4 or 5, but I don't see Denver dealing two people (Gallo or Faried).  They're the two youngest and best players they have.  Why not keep them for a rebuild with Mudiay at the guard spot?"
pacers,3cscqn,Smart_Dumb,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:31:31 2015 UTC,"I agree. We need to let this group gel and see what they can do. We have G Hill, Ellis, Stuckey, Miles, Solo, Damo, PG, Allen, and Turner all under contract through at least 2016/2017. If we have a decent season this year and make the playoffs (which I think we will), I hope that we can show a great player that we are one piece away from being a serious title contender."
pacers,3cscqn,OyarsaRPM,-2,Fri Jul 10 14:03:00 2015 UTC,Don't you think we'd be significantly better if we had a legit starting point guard on the roster?
pacers,3cscqn,OyarsaRPM,3,Fri Jul 10 14:20:05 2015 UTC,So he's not CP3 or John Wall but he was still top 25 in the league in assists per game. He IS a legit starting point guard; you don't have to make the all-star team to be legit.
pacers,3cscqn,herrrr-me-nerrrr,-2,Fri Jul 10 15:24:12 2015 UTC,"Im not saying hes not a really good player, but his natural and much better position is the 2 guard.  Hes a below average point guard."
pacers,3cscqn,herrrr-me-nerrrr,2,Fri Jul 10 15:29:47 2015 UTC,"Better at the 2, for sure. ""average point guard"", maybe. ""Below average point guard"", no."
pacers,3cscqn,poorchris,5,Fri Jul 10 16:19:54 2015 UTC,"I honestly prefer G Hill over Lawson. It's fairly close to a wash on offense and nowhere close on defense.  Would love to land Faried though. Wouldn't offer a first as he has a big contract and Denver has no leverage - perhaps our second rounder, plus the Lakers one we got from Roy?"
pacers,3cscqn,yobramine,0,Fri Jul 10 13:36:53 2015 UTC,"Hills definitely a superior defender no doubt, but lawsons an elite distrubuter (almost 10 assist per game last season).  We have the firepower now with ellis and pg, just need someone to set them up"
pacers,3cscqn,Quickben33,3,Fri Jul 10 14:00:15 2015 UTC,Ellis IS that dude to set people up in my mind. That's what he was in Dallas before Rondo and was damn good at it.  Also a Lawson/Ellis backcourt is suicide defensively.
pacers,3cscqn,masterofthe5count,0,Fri Jul 10 15:17:16 2015 UTC,Thats a good point about the defensive liability. A lawson/hill backcourt would be ideal
pacers,3cscqn,SE_FortyFive,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:32:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think Lawson is that much better as a distributor than what Indiana already has.  Monta Ellis is a really underrated playmaker to me, and I think he can already add that spark the Pacers are looking for on the wing."
pacers,3cscqn,iAMtHESushighost,6,Fri Jul 10 16:33:26 2015 UTC,"I think George Hill is too much of an off-court asset to trade him away at this point.  He's a home-town hero type of guy since he went to high school in Broad Ripple and college at IUPUI.  While that might not mean as much to fans wanting to field a contender, it means a lot to casual fans that go to games just to see the team.  Plus we acquired Monta with the idea that he would complement Hill well and create a good backcourt duo.  I hope we at least see how well the chemistry works out there before we try to reset with a new point guard."
pacers,3cscqn,zzellers,2,Fri Jul 10 14:29:03 2015 UTC,"If Denver will take two 2nd round picks for Lawson and Faried, I say so it. I am even willing to throw in Wittington, Mahinmi, or Solo."
pacers,3cscqn,h3isenburg,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:12:36 2015 UTC,No for the Lawson / G. Hill swap.  Monta needs a big defensive minded guard by him.  Our backcourt defense would be atrocious.  Not to mention we don't need an assist first guard.  Look how well that worked for Dallas with Rondo/Ellis.  Ellis will do better with the ball and having G. Hill playing off the ball.

pacers,3cpcno,typs,9,Thu Jul 9 18:18:19 2015 UTC,"""I am the one who thinks he can play the 4 position""   I'd like to hear Vogel's rebuttal.  Does he agree, or is he think he's going to be forced to play a wing at 4 because he won't have any other options?"
pacers,3cpcno,MrGoodness,6,Thu Jul 9 18:41:21 2015 UTC,I don't understand the point of putting PG at Power Forward coming back from almost a career ending injury. I guess I feel like playing and defending the 4 will be more strenuous on a guy his size and injury history. Let him comeback to his natural position at first.
pacers,3cpcno,Smart_Dumb,14,Thu Jul 9 20:01:01 2015 UTC,Injury history? His leg broke because he hit it perpendicular to a solid object while moving very quickly. We need to stop acting like PG is made of glass.
pacers,3cpcno,MrGoodness,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:22:13 2015 UTC,Yeah I guess my point was not that PG has been riddle with injuries in his career. Just that he will be coming back from an extreme injury along with the calf strain that happened shortly after the he came back and that's something the Pacers should consider by playing him at a different position against larger guys. Bad wording on my part.
pacers,3cpcno,GritznGravy23,-4,Fri Jul 10 13:14:08 2015 UTC,"It doesn't really matter what the circumstances were, he now has a history of injuries whether you want to admit it or not. I agree with MrGoodness."
pacers,3cpcno,The_Capulet,9,Thu Jul 9 22:06:45 2015 UTC,"I think the circumstances do matter.  He doesn't have a history, he broke a leg in a way that would have shattered literally everyone else outside of the fucking terminator or robocop.  It isn't going to just break again.  It's not like worn out knees or weak ankles.  It was a freak accident that in all reality, won't ever happen again."
pacers,3cpcno,GritznGravy23,0,Thu Jul 9 23:11:31 2015 UTC,"What do you mean ""he doesn't have a history""? He most definitely does have a history of injuries now despite the fact it was a freak accident. History is a term to describe past events. He broke his leg at some point in the past. Therefore he now has an INJURY HISTORY. How is this so fucking hard for you people to grasp? The catastrophic injury he suffered can, and will carry over to other aspects of his game/life, as seen in the last game of the season vs. Memphis. You act like there are no residual effects of a horrific injury."
pacers,3cpcno,Smart_Dumb,2,Fri Jul 10 03:30:36 2015 UTC,"history of injuries    No he doesn't. He has had one injury. One. If you are going to get all technical on the term ""injury history"", which is being used in the same context here as injury prone (which we know PG is not), then I am going to go all technical on ""history of injuries""."
pacers,3cpcno,GritznGravy23,2,Fri Jul 10 03:45:43 2015 UTC,"You're the first person to bring up the term ""injury prone"", which I will agree up until this point Paul George is not. I was not using the term ""injury history"" to imply he was ""injury prone"". But to say he doesn't have an injury history is disingenuous. And by the way he's had two injuries. The leg break, and the calf strain he suffered against Memphis."
pacers,3cpcno,CSLouisHighEdition,2,Fri Jul 10 04:01:30 2015 UTC,"By your logic every single player on the Pacers roster has an ""injury history""."

pacers,3coz18,bobeo,15,Thu Jul 9 22:02:11 2015 UTC,"This is uncharted waters for not only the Pacers, but also Kravitz and really anyone who has followed the Pacers for the last 20+ years.  This team is really in the process of completely changing its identity from a half court, defensive grind house of a team, to an uptempo, offensive-minded team that doesn't necessarily need the prototypical bigs we're all used to seeing on the court wearing Blue and Gold.  We're most definitely modeling our team after the Golden State Warriors, a team that played 6'7"" Draymond Green at the PF/C position for stretches last season as well as in the postseason (and with obviously great success).  And they were one of the best defensive teams in the NBA last year, w/out a true rim protector (unless you want to call Andrew Bogut a rim protector, but I'd wager that even with fewer minutes, rookie Myles Turner will block more shots than Bogut next year).  Kravitz just doesn't like seeing change like this because he can't get a comfortable or accurate bead on how this team on paper will translate to the court.  It's definitely going to be a transition for everyone, but I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing at all."
pacers,3coz18,tergiversation,2,Thu Jul 9 18:47:32 2015 UTC,"Bogut had similar rim protecting stats to Hibbert last season. He was second in the league, so if we are mimicking the Warriors then we just got rid of our Bogut."
pacers,3coz18,Victory33,5,Thu Jul 9 23:11:54 2015 UTC,"Bogut also barely played in most of the finals games. Having a big plodding rim protector is still valuable, they've just become much more situational players. You can't keep someone like bogut or hibbert on the court when your opponent is playing small."

pacers,3coz18,iRussell21,2,Fri Jul 10 00:23:44 2015 UTC,"The real problem is that we don't know how good he's going to be. When the season starts, if PG is back to being one of the best players in the league, then I think a lot of us will calm down."
pacers,3coz18,Z-Tay,20,Fri Jul 10 01:02:26 2015 UTC,Kravitz is a blow hard.
pacers,3coz18,Vitapak,2,Thu Jul 9 16:50:00 2015 UTC,so you don't think he made any good points here?
pacers,3coz18,pacerpower,10,Thu Jul 9 16:51:07 2015 UTC,"This guy just has a history of writing out his ass. He's an alarmist and a blow hard.  I can completely recognize that doing a rebuild this quickly seems rash, but here are the points I consider:   The league is going to change drastically next year because of the cap increase from the TV deal.  Being in a good position with players this year will help you next year when things go bonkers.   The situation with Hibbert's mental drive and the unfair pressure/blame the organization was putting on Hibbert may have made the situation untenable. The obvious sea change in NBA basketball towards small ball, but more importantly shooting and spacing truly makes the case for needing to make changes. It doesn't matter that Hibbert and West are huge so much as its important that we get bigs who can consistently shoot 3s.  Both Hibbert and West could nail the 15-18 footer, but the NBA is demanding even better spacing to keep up. This might be the most important piece. From all reports on the relationship with Hibbert and the team and considering age. We were going to lose West and Hibbert next year no matter what.... what should we have done then?  Making the moves now gives us the best control over a situation that would have been forced on us next year.   Those considerations make a rebuild more understandable."
pacers,3coz18,Vitapak,2,Thu Jul 9 18:17:16 2015 UTC,"Only one I'd agree with would be Scola.  We should have kept him.  Hibbert needed a changed of scenery in a very bad was and West looked old last season.  The ""outrage"" and the lottery prediction is a joke though."
pacers,3coz18,supashurume,2,Thu Jul 9 16:58:36 2015 UTC,"I agree on all points.  Sure, Scola wasn't worth $11m, but we probably could have kept him for 4 or 5."
pacers,3coz18,Smart_Dumb,15,Thu Jul 9 20:25:29 2015 UTC,We were one win away from a playoff berth last year. PG missed most of the season and G Hill missed half.   We lost the most inconsistent player on the planet and two 35 year old dudes. We gain Monta Ellis. And he thinks we are going to be worse? What a joke. Free agency isn't done. We will get at least another big somewhere. Is this big going to be a show stopper? No. But there is NO WAY you can convince me we will be worse than last year.    Who is supposed to rebound    Did he not watch Lavoy Allen play at all last year? That dude was a rebound machine. He would out rebound Roy playing 1/2 the minutes Roy did!
pacers,3coz18,poorchris,3,Thu Jul 9 18:26:49 2015 UTC,"Who is supposed to rebound    Did he not watch Lavoy Allen play at all last year?    Yeah, most guys who write reactionary, over-the-top stuff like this don't watch anything.    Barring a season that is even more injury plagued than last year (let's hope not), the Pacers will almost be a lock to at least make the playoffs."
pacers,3coz18,unabiker,4,Fri Jul 10 03:29:13 2015 UTC,Kravitz doesn't even watch the Pacers outside of ESPN highlights. Why anyone pays attention to any of the drivel he writes is beyond me.

That is the part I cannot understand about the changes. Your star was injured all year and your key role players were constantly in and out of the lineup. As soon as you have a chance to make one more go with a contending lineup you just quit? I am excited to see the new team I really am, but I will remember that we had one more year before we had to make this decision if we start losing."
pacers,3coz18,shadowmist007,2,Thu Jul 9 17:24:44 2015 UTC,"It seem like everybody hear sometimes forgot about born ready, he was the x factor being as a contender. He was our backup plan as well if this didn't work, we had at least 2 guys to build around.   Well he is gone now. It was just a time to change. Plus all the championship winners have been playing an up tempo type game spurs, heat, and warriors."
pacers,3coz18,WTF_RANDY,4,Thu Jul 9 18:25:11 2015 UTC,"I thought the biggest problem that season was having the second worst bench in the league. Last season we had one of the best for a while. Now we will never know how that team could play with a bench at their back. I certainly haven't forgotten Stephenson but Remember when we lost Granger? Who would have thought that team could continue to compete at that level.   I just think with such tectonic shifts cautious optimism is the best way to approach it. We haven't seen G Hill or PG run small ball, and we are counting on rookies and a career bench player to fill the hole in the front court. We basically went from a proven formula to get us to title contention to a completely unknown quantity."
pacers,3coz18,shadowmist007,3,Thu Jul 9 18:30:58 2015 UTC,Well the guy that was leading our bench was stuckey and i don't think we had enough cap space to keep him anyway if west and Hilbert had stayed.
pacers,3coz18,WTF_RANDY,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:39:30 2015 UTC,It's possible that that is true our bench could have not been what it was last year. But I think there are reasons to question the decisions made to move on.

He assumes no one will step up, that we are lost an our bigs will all suck.  Seriously, ""not in my lifetime""? How the fuck do you know anything about how Turner is going to turn out? And news flash, getting 30 points out of 2 starters and a backup, combined, is not a great number.  Its not something you look at and say ""wow that can't be replicated"".  Especially not when you brought someone in that averages 20 points by himself.    Kravitz has a habit of putting up complete doom and gloom shit like this.  So fucking tired of his nonsense.

Let it go people, that was a fun run, but it's in the past.   There was very little choice but to do what the front office did. Fuck off Kravitz. Keep Hibbs and then do what?

I'm not saying I agree with Kravitz, but I do disagree with Bird blowing up the team so close to the level of success we were having. This team wasn't missing many pieces. To blow it up to try and play run and gun ball? When we'd have a nice cap increase and a lot of open money regardless? Seems like bad management. Like someone else mentioned, why not trade Hibbert and West last season before the deadline? Get some future pieces or open up cap space for this off-season. Instead, West opts out and we make a trade for some junk for Hibbert now, when we could have wrangled a more established piece to put next to PG."

We finished 10-13... it was the most frustrating basketball I have ever seen. The amazing start we had added salt to the wound.   Yeah, we were missing only a few pieces, but we couldn't afford any more. That is probably Larry's fault. But at the time, Roy and David looked essential.   We traded Roy for what his market value was, a 2nd rounder. And that came from a desperate team.   I believe we got that established piece to put next to PG. Monta Ellis. Who we could sign because West opted out.   It was obvious two years ago that the group featuring Hibbert and West wasn't going to work. The pinnacle of that was three years ago.

pacers,3coz18,Camus145,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:05:34 2015 UTC,"I think people are underestimating how truly bad our defense will be. Its not jist that other bigs will be able to score on our bigs, its that it will be easy to score in the lane."

pacers,3coz18,Camus145,6,Thu Jul 9 18:37:59 2015 UTC,Dragic is a very unique player. Roy's stats back it up that he has been one of the hardest to score on for the entire league.
pacers,3coz18,gugargioni,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:12:29 2015 UTC,Unless you are a smaller player which is the way the league is going.
pacers,3coz18,MC_Reagan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:53:45 2015 UTC,We should have tanked last year and at least gotten a better draft pick.
pacers,3coz18,h3isenburg,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:53:06 2015 UTC,"This has been my opinion the entire time. If we wanted to change styles, why not ship off Roy & DWest before the deadline last year & get into the Top 7 draft pick area?     Some guy on /r/NBA was arguing that he didn't want to see the Pacers turn into the Sixers but that's a laughable comparison. It'd be more like when Robinson went out for the Spurs in 97 and they tanked for Duncan. I know I'd certainly be happier as a Pacer fan right now if we had KAT, Porzingis or Okafor than having Turner. And guess what? We still dong have West or Hibbert!"
pacers,3comam,Sheffield178,2,Thu Jul 9 15:06:50 2015 UTC,"Good interview, I really like the guy.  And let's face we need to cherish him, because he's the last CJ we have left."
pacers,3comam,typs,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:55:09 2015 UTC,"CJ would be great starting or coming off the bench, but he does need to pass the ball a little more."
pacers,3comam,CiprianBuci,2,Thu Jul 9 15:39:08 2015 UTC,I thought he did a much better job of that in the second half of the season. At the beginning of the season he looked a lot like Evan Turner to me.
pacers,3comam,WTF_RANDY,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:39:32 2015 UTC,who should he have passed to last year? I'm pretty sure he had the green light with our roster.
pacers,3comam,scottw5150,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:08:44 2015 UTC,Yeah there was a point where he was the number one or two option. Now he goes to fifth or 6th and should excel
pacers,3cofnk,MarryMeFrisbee,4,Thu Jul 9 14:15:26 2015 UTC,I don't understand how we didn't get brandon bass.
pacers,3cofnk,VinhFinn,3,Thu Jul 9 14:28:18 2015 UTC,"Amare is available right? Although I don't want him.  Larry has to have another move up his sleeve, because assembling the rest of the team via free agency and the summer league would leave us pretty weak."
pacers,3cofnk,TonofSoil,6,Thu Jul 9 14:23:53 2015 UTC,"Trade options: Markieff Morris, K. Faried, T. Jones, Taj Gibson, J. Sulinger.  FA options: Stoudemire, Bargnani, Josh Smith, K. Seraphin.  We need trade"
pacers,3cofnk,gugargioni,2,Thu Jul 9 14:43:04 2015 UTC,"I would push for Faried, Jones, or Gibson. Amar'e on a vet min would be good."
pacers,3cofnk,exWarlock,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:56:32 2015 UTC,To think how cheap we could probably get Smith.  Used to be a near-max player a few years ago.
pacers,3cofnk,Drak_is_Right,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:55:06 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see Faried, but we don't have much to give for him."
pacers,3cofnk,Baldeagleactivist,2,Thu Jul 9 21:49:59 2015 UTC,I would love to see josh smith he used to have great games against us when he was on the Hawks but it scares me how the Pistons hated him so much they straight up released him and then the Pistons went on like a huge win streak after he was gone lmao EDIT: I would love to see faried though he seems like a perfect fit and is only improving...we would have to give up a lot to get him though
pacers,3cofnk,Swagboi9,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:17:30 2015 UTC,I'd hate to have him personally. Something to be said about a guy who looks like a good player that when removed from a team makes that team better. Probably a cancerous personality to have in the locker room
pacers,3cofnk,dirtydan1114,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:53:17 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity how would you guys feel about Al Jefferson? I think we (the Hornets) have got one more move up our sleeves as well, and thought you guys might be a decent fit as a landing spot for him in a trade."
pacers,3cofnk,skadoosh0019,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:19:32 2015 UTC,No chance. Bird wants to play fast and small. I love Big Al but he's neither of those.
pacers,3cofnk,materhern,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:30:41 2015 UTC,"With PG spending time at the 4, I'd be okay with Faried and Taj, I just don't know what we have to trade at this point.  Stoudemire on a vet min would be perfect.  His minutes would be limited due to age and durability.  But PG will be at the 4 much of the time, so it would be easy to limit Stoudemires minutes."

pacers,3cn2kc,yobramine,4,Thu Jul 9 04:36:28 2015 UTC,"Ouch. Well I guess we still need a starting PF. I get that there are technically some FA's out there, but there's a reason they're still out there."
pacers,3cn2kc,XC_Stallion92,2,Thu Jul 9 11:48:22 2015 UTC,"We could still pull off some sort of trade to get more front court depth.  Would be nice if we had trade assets, though."
pacers,3cn2kc,XC_Stallion92,2,Thu Jul 9 12:00:11 2015 UTC,Maybe we'll get assets from the Mavs.
pacers,3cn2kc,25Tab,3,Thu Jul 9 12:01:56 2015 UTC,I'm not sure why Bird let him go. He wouldn't have cost much and the Pacers have the dough. Disappointing move for the team imo.

pacers,3cn2kc,Duzaman,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:41:32 2015 UTC,"Good for Scola.  I honestly like the approach the team is taking.  We have a good young squad will talented players.  I think the Pacers will find a trade to get another big man.  We may not be an immediate threat but we have so much young talent and the way the cap is going, we will be able to offer big money to anybody we want in the coming years."
pacers,3cn2kc,Shepherdsfavestore,0,Thu Jul 9 14:52:54 2015 UTC,This makes me happy. I know a lot of people here wanted Scola back but I just don't see how he fits into the style of ball we are wanting to play.
pacers,3cn2kc,Duzaman,0,Thu Jul 9 04:49:24 2015 UTC,"Sad to see him go, but not all hope is lost. I hate how everyone is saying we have no bigs when we have 4 that can play. I still think we should pick up a PF though. Psycho T is a UFA.. just letting you guys know.   EDIT: Also Josh Smith but he might be too expensive."

pacers,3cmjxf,olddoy,13,Thu Jul 9 02:04:06 2015 UTC,Pretty sure Larry Bird would not risk his and the franchise's reputation over a salary dump (if you guys are ok with me using that term). Mitch and Larry are both classy dudes and I'm 100% sure the deal will follow through. Best of luck next season!
pacers,3cmjxf,TheAsianMamba,12,Thu Jul 9 02:08:19 2015 UTC,"I am pretty sure Larry Bird would drink PBR with his shirt off at games if his wife wasn't sitting next to him.

I also hope that Cuban is planning to go full tank and will want to keep any assets he has."
pacers,3cmjxf,SHP614,3,Thu Jul 9 03:04:05 2015 UTC,a reporter tweeted that the pacers approached the mavs about the hibbert trade not long ago
pacers,3cmjxf,olddoy,3,Thu Jul 9 02:01:43 2015 UTC,"If the Mavs can offer something better, then yeah. Last I heard they were still discussing assets so the laker trade is still open."
pacers,3cmjxf,Saxophonekid,4,Thu Jul 9 02:37:28 2015 UTC,"Its a business.  Larry's job is to win titles, not do the right thing by the Lakers.  Whatever the best deal available is, take it."
pacers,3cmjxf,melon117,2,Thu Jul 9 10:57:30 2015 UTC,I think we should stick to the trade we agreed on. I already don't like DJ's game now I don't like him.
pacers,3cmjxf,Wolgarr,2,Thu Jul 9 09:54:15 2015 UTC,"I think what people are missing is that if Bird doesn't go through with the trade, other GMs would start thinking twice dealing with him because he wouldn't always honor agreements. It was different with DJ because he doesn't have to regularly deal with other front offices. There's more at stake for a front office when backing out"
pacers,3cmjxf,aveaou,2,Thu Jul 9 15:48:07 2015 UTC,Depends on what we get from either team. I would take the better deal. Word was the deal with the Lakers was never finalized. We still have no idea what year the 2nd round pick would be.
pacers,3cmjxf,Duzaman,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:18:49 2015 UTC,Who do they have to offer that would make a deal so much better than the lakers?
pacers,3cmjxf,crakerjax69,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:21:47 2015 UTC,"nobody, that's what makes it so great. They would only give us ellis to kind of match salary's i guess and a couple of picks.  The lakers on the other hand would give us unwanted players on top of us signing ellis. That would decrease our cap space."
pacers,3cmjxf,Slygekkie,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:12:25 2015 UTC,"The Lakers wouldn't have to give us any players back; they're not over the cap to have to do any salary matching.  Giving us Ellis back in a S&T with Dallas doesn't do much for us at this point, since we will already have $13-14m in cap room available after the Hibbert trade and Stuckey re-signing sign to spend."
pacers,3cmjxf,herrkaizer87,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:02:28 2015 UTC,"I really hope the Pacers don't back out of the Lakers trade for the Mavs. It wouldn't look good as a FO to do that to another team, and if the Pacers want to trade and deal with other organizations, keeping a good image is important (look at the reported backlash towards the Kings for supposedly wanting to back out of their trade with the Sixers). However, if the Mavs offer some crazy better deal clearly go with that, but I doubt they do."
pacers,3cmjxf,pezasied,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:19:43 2015 UTC,Personally I would rather have Roy in Dallas if we have to get rid of him but at the same time it would feel wrong screwing over the Lakers.

pacers,3clasy,WTF_RANDY,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:30:14 2015 UTC,did not know they could foul that many times but I guess player development is more important then fairness in the game in summer league.

pacers,3clasy,NOTtrentRICHARDSON,5,Thu Jul 9 04:37:30 2015 UTC,"Man, that's why I was so high on him way before we drafted him. He has an awareness on defense that just isn't matched."
pacers,3clasy,scottw5150,3,Wed Jul 8 21:47:32 2015 UTC,"Dude traces the ball like a true great shot blocker, that's a skill. Even with WCS and Towns in college I always thought Turner was the best shot blocker of them all.. And his offensive moves keep getting more refined - his step backs.. And the 3pt range. i think he's likely to be a 17+ ppg, great shot blocker. And his ceiling is for sure higher than that. Great pick for u guys. Once his running gate started to get better, I knew he'd be a steal"
pacers,3clasy,newgenduder,6,Thu Jul 9 07:24:34 2015 UTC,"I know it's only summer league, but usually guys who stayed in college for 4 years dominate. He came out as a frosh and is making everyone look stupid out there. I wasn't a fan of the pick, but Larry looks pretty smart at the moment."
pacers,3clasy,XC_Stallion92,3,Thu Jul 9 04:01:31 2015 UTC,He's like Mahimni only more athletic and actually has an offensive game.
pacers,3clasy,CSLouisHighEdition,2,Thu Jul 9 02:54:49 2015 UTC,"I know it's only summer league...but I say start him on game 1. Throw him to the wolves and let him learn. I see us as a playoff team and not a contender, it's not like we have any other options anyway.   Then again if I knew what I was talking about I'd have a job in the NBA."
pacers,3clasy,ghostin_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:51:27 2015 UTC,Love that kid! Hoping for great things from him!
pacers,3clasy,winothirtynino,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:30:55 2015 UTC,"Turner is proving to be a fucking steal, damn. His strides appear to be longer now, than in college. And he could def develop that '2x pound dribble, jumper off the post' like LMA, etc.  All that and his elite shot blocking instincts."
pacers,3clasy,dissphemism,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:53:45 2015 UTC,"Solomon Hill, on the other hand...  Why is Solomon Hill doing so BAD!!! He should be better. This is his 3rd year, yet he's stinking it up against players who mostly have less experience."
pacers,3clasy,MC_Reagan,2,Thu Jul 9 04:41:41 2015 UTC,"I'll regurgitate what someone said the other day on here. Solo is best when he's a 3rd or 4th option, not the first."
pacers,3clasy,THE_BIG_SITT,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:48:24 2015 UTC,I know man. He better pick it up because people expect things from this year.
pacers,3clasy,VinhFinn,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:48:41 2015 UTC,Local guy on the radio was saying he's taking it slow because he doesn't want to get injured. I don't understand the logic behind that because he could've just not participated.
pacers,3cm82b,LinuxF4n,6,Thu Jul 9 00:19:33 2015 UTC,I'm liking the Young - Turner synergy in a lot of those plays.
pacers,3cm82b,Airegus,3,Thu Jul 9 04:18:49 2015 UTC,"I could see him replacing Stuckey down the road as a guy who can come off the bench and give you immediate offense. I know it's only summer league, but he's looked great so far."
pacers,3cm82b,Ub3rpwnag3,3,Thu Jul 9 00:40:23 2015 UTC,not really very surprised by this.  he spent 4 years in college and is farther along in his development then most of these players.  probably as old if not older then many.  if we got a quality bench player out of this guy I'd be happy.  A starter would be an absolute steal.
pacers,3cm82b,Drak_is_Right,3,Thu Jul 9 02:33:08 2015 UTC,Lance was a 2nd rounder too. I like Joe's potential.

pacers,3cn4mn,melon117,-1,Thu Jul 9 22:25:25 2015 UTC,I swear to god if Tyler Hansborough is playing for the Pacers next year I'm renouncing my fandom of the organization.
pacers,3cjkg5,Sheffield178,9,Wed Jul 8 12:21:34 2015 UTC,"I'll set aside my excitement over turner because we've seen fantastic summer camp performances before and been let down.  But I'd like him to be the exception.   Anyone else really really disappointed in Solo so far? As they said, they are playing against D leaguers and rookies right now.  Turner is dominating, but Hill looks just as bad as last year.  His defense is still pretty good, but he still is a brick machine.  He can penetrate but he can't finish.  He can get open, but can't hit the open shots.  I really had hoped to see him dominate in summer league.  Something to tell me he took a step forward in the off season.  I'm a Solo fan, but he's not giving me anything right now."
pacers,3cjkg5,materhern,5,Wed Jul 8 13:38:29 2015 UTC,"I am also a Solo fan, think he can be a great glue guy. I think you should give him a break. Summer League is a mess. Guys running around, shooting every time they can, etc. Solo is a guy I think operates best in a structured environment. He's a team player, SL is playground ball. I definitely admit he should be shooting better though."
pacers,3cjkg5,eckrueger,3,Wed Jul 8 15:23:49 2015 UTC,"a great glue guy...Solo... operates best in a structured environment. He's a team player,   Completely agree and that's why I'm not overly worried about this week's performance.  He's a little bit like Hibbert in the sense of his defensive consistency with ony bursts of offense.  I think he's going to be great fitting into the a role alongside our other perimeter options.  You can also see him going up and slappin hands/butts after a lot of plays to encourage the young guys in SL.  He said before that he sees himself moving into a leadership role, and that's exactly the kind of glue guy he'll be.  I can see him with a David West demeanor in a few years, but with less scowling ""and 1"" shouts."
pacers,3cjkg5,typs,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:43:23 2015 UTC,"Yup. I can't stand how guys who always try on defense but are off and on with offense are looked down on, but the opposite is praised.   I've never heard anything bad about him and think he'll be a good leader for them. Needs to work on his shooting, but I like him a lot as a back up."
pacers,3cjkg5,eckrueger,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:50:55 2015 UTC,"I think he even works as a started, considering Ellis and PG13 should have the ball most of the time anyways. But yeah, Stuckey-Miles is a good second unit from a putting up shots standpoint, so either way Solo just needs to be a classic 3&D glue guy."
pacers,3cjkg5,typs,5,Wed Jul 8 23:59:30 2015 UTC,"Quick release and a nice touch away from the basket. I'm also surprised just how big he looks. Of course he's big, but he has that monstrous look to him like DeAndre. He's not going to get pushed around much."
pacers,3cjkg5,Pseudonova,2,Wed Jul 8 17:31:24 2015 UTC,"I refuse to get too excited. It's good that he's playing well, but doesn't mean jack. Summer League is just glorified pick up. That said, he has looked pretty damn good. Hope it carries over to regular season games."
pacers,3cjkg5,eckrueger,2,Wed Jul 8 15:21:31 2015 UTC,"I know no one wants to get excited, but we really should.  This guy is 19 and the shooting touch is insane.  Shooting in SL vs the NBA is not that big of a difference for a 7 footer IMO... shooting is shooting and if defenders are better in the NBA it will simply take coaching to get him in the right spots.  Where a smaller guy might get his shot disrupted by all the size and talent in the NBA a guy of his size will be able to get his looks and not worry about being blocked. Sure he might shy away from the big stage, but the motion and touch are already there.    I am also so impressed with his foot work and ability to turn over both shoulders.  He shows great intelligence in picking his spots, reading the play, and I won't even start on his effort.  Even if this guy doesn't develop any further I could see him being a rotation big on any team in the NBA.  If he develops any further ...well sky is the limit.  Its ok to not be excited, but this guy is scoring from ALL OVER the court and making lots of great plays.  My only concern is Frank will struggle utilizing him properly as we have never really had a 3pt shooting big.  So glad his most developed talent is shooting.  The blocks in summer league I don't count for much, but he is showing effort getting there and that is all you need to alter a shot in the NBA when you have his size."
pacers,3cjkg5,pacerpower,3,Thu Jul 9 04:06:27 2015 UTC,"I'm a devout follower of Texas basketball, and there are a few reasons why I think you guys may have gotten the steal of the draft in Myles. First, he was the number 2 HS player on the board when Rick got him to come to UT. Second, our pg Isaiah Taylor broke his arm in November last year at the beginning of the season. This derailed our entire team because they had been building confidence with Isaiah at the helm, and his injury led to our first team regression in over a year. Loss of team confidence followed. Rick had no offensive game plan and our entire team played confused. Furthermore, Rick limited Myles minutes, sometimes to under 10 per game. Rick just is not a coach that gets the best out of his guys or maximizes his roster. Our team was a disaster. This led to Myles getting no hype throughout the entire cbb season, no espn top 10 plays. He basically stayed unknown all year. Had he played the way he is now playing, he surely would've been better showcased by the media and had a lot more hype. People were scared to pick him!   Now I see Myles playing with more consistency in the summer league than he was able to at UT. It's a bittersweet sight as it shows me what I had expected we could have seen from him at Texas under a better coach. He's got great touch and a skillset I haven't seen out of many other bigs. His turnaround jumper is already polished. He's a great free throw shooter. His shot blocking instincts are exceptional. I do think he needs to build some strength. Finally, Myles is a great kid with a great work ethic, and I believe he will develop well."
pacers,3cjkg5,ToTheBongGuy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:14:04 2015 UTC,"God I am so excited I want to reply to my own comment.  Watching him play I don't get the same feeling watching Okafor or Frank the Tank or any of the other bigs... he is just so damn controlled.  It really is refreshing to watch his game and then see Okafor put up a lot of shots or struggle initially.  I know that Okafor may have a higher ceiling, but given that we just lost all our front court starters I am really happy to see a guy playing well and under control."

Not because he sucks and some how got worse, but because the league is changing and his abilities are quickly becoming a minor part of the game.  When their 5 can pop out for a 3, and your 5 isn't athletic enough to keep up with him, all the rim protection in the world doesn't save you.    Glad we finally moved on.  I wish the very best for both of them, I really do."
pacers,3cje1u,materhern,2,Wed Jul 8 12:20:40 2015 UTC,Well said...totally agree
pacers,3cje1u,btirumala,2,Wed Jul 8 11:48:25 2015 UTC,"It's not just losing West/Hibbert, I just don't get why we are turning our back on a system that made us relevant again, and that was only missing offense last season as a top 5 defense and rebounding team. A system that got us one game from the finals and made us near equals with Lebron, Wade, Bosh and Ray Allen on the floor even though we were bested at almost every position. I don't think up-tempo, offense first, mentality is the answer for us.   I hear the league is changing because of the Warriors, but the Warriors were the #1 defensive ranked team last year and they have two great shooters. We aren't going to be a top 5 defense without Hibbert and we have no real shooters on this team so we can't compete with that style of play. Don't we remember when we fired Carlise (who was the best defensive coach) and went uptempo for O'Brien's system? This feels like the same mistake all over again.   As a basketball fan, I don't mind seeing how this experiment works as our offense was boring and this should be fun to watch...but I doubt it translates to making us as good as we were. We were becoming a threat in a small market and that is no easy task in the NBA. We also have no veterans now with West gone, Hill (who never speaks up) is now our ""veteran"". Paul George is going to have to grow up real fast and command this team."
pacers,3cje1u,Victory33,2,Wed Jul 8 12:42:09 2015 UTC,"we have no real shooters on this team   I disagree here. PG, Ellis, Miles, G Hill... all great shooters."
pacers,3cje1u,Smart_Dumb,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:50:36 2015 UTC,"PG - decent from outside, streaky, mediocre to poor mid-range.   Ellis - Horrible from deep, 28% last year. Better slasher than a shooter.   Miles - shot under 40% last year, that is very bad. I mean really bad. It was the 7th lowest FG% for anyone over 800 attempts.   Hill - Really stepped it up last year. Not a historically ""great"" shooter but solid enough from deep and mid-range."
pacers,3cje1u,Victory33,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:03:53 2015 UTC,Give miles a bit of a break. He's a role player that was asked to be a top scoring option on the team. I think he will be fine back as a role player
pacers,3cje1u,scottw5150,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:49:04 2015 UTC,"Miles shot decent from 3, especially later in the season.  At the start of the season where sometimes every starter was missing....the offense stunk and Miles is not an isolation playmaker.  We actually have pretty good long-range.  Hill, Rudez, Miles, George.  Stuckey last year shot good from 3, seems if you play him with a second point guard he is getting open looks.  Young is another good shooter that we added.  Turner might be another option in this next year.  Miles shooting percentage was bad, but true shooting% was much better."
pacers,3cje1u,Drak_is_Right,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:53:33 2015 UTC,"Our offense seems like it's going to be determined a lot by Monta, Hill, stuckey, And George driving and kicking. I expect that with hopefully Scola back and Turner a whole lot more pick and rolls since we saw very few with West and Hibbert. Turner looks to be a pick and roll/pop stud if he can develop right. I'm excited to see our new offense. It got old watching last seasons."
pacers,3cje1u,scottw5150,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:57:22 2015 UTC,"parts of the second half it was exciting.  If we can continue like that...well, as long as the defense isn't horrid we will get a playoff spot."
pacers,3cje1u,Drak_is_Right,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:59:17 2015 UTC,"I think its reasonable for people to have some concern about losing two guys that have been rocks on the team the last 4-5 years. Hibbert kept our defense competitive for most of the season in 14-15 and West has been consistently good IMO. The pieces we have left from the ECF run's both missed significant time last year and Myles is completely unproven in the NBA. I am personally very excited about 2015-16 season and am especially excited to see how Myles develops if he shows even half of what he has in SL in his rookie season the kid will be a tremendous player. I think you are right on every count there are a ton of reasons to be optimistic. But I do have my reservations about losing those guys, since we don't yet know how well this new team will look without them. On top of all of that it is sad to see guys who have been such huge parts of the community and Pacer's organization be let go after such a down year without Hill and PG for most of it."
pacers,3cje1u,WTF_RANDY,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:10:36 2015 UTC,"I agree about the excitement and the opportunities to come.  However, I wouldn't call Turner a ""lights out"" shooter just yet"
pacers,3cje1u,Anicole2196,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:29:55 2015 UTC,"The team had to change.  They went as far as that combination of players could go and were in decline.  They played their core 5 guys too many minutes due to poor bench play and never gave them nights off.  The real tragedy here is that LB didn't pull the plug last season after PG's injury.  He could have gotten good assets in return for both players and we also could have had a top 8 pick in the draft.  I'm sure he was following the owner's mandate, but man, that was a major mistake.  I cancelled my season ticket package after last season because I hated that decision and the direction of the team.  I am now considering getting my tickets again, because I think this team will be scrappy and fun to watch.  I would rather watch a scrappy team that's overmatched than an entitled team with a pouty power forward who cries after every call and a 7 foot center who literally gets zero rebounds some nights."

pacers,3cje1u,royhibbertnicekisser,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:56:45 2015 UTC,"It's because a lot of people in Indy don't like change...  And because many would prefer being a decent team but not a contender over risking to create something special (or fall on our faces). With Cavs being the way they are, with Heat and Bulls having very tough squads and then a number of up-and-coming teams, we absolutely had to shake things if we want something above ""mediocrity"". But you know, it's the midwest, mediocrity is a comfortable place."
pacers,3cje1u,pfc_bgd,0,Wed Jul 8 16:57:55 2015 UTC,"Heat rarely played smallball against the Pacers.  Cavs wouldn't of either as long as we had West AND Hibbert.  A bruiser at PF counters small ball by exposing the lack of strength from the SF/stretch PF.  Our problem against the Hawks was 1) our team was playing like shit from mental breakdowns and 2) Hibbert can't guard a mobile center.  Quickest way to tire out your Small forward is force them to wrestle in the paint on defense with a very strong PF like West.  Grizzlies were beatup and at maybe 60% strength in the playoffs.  As long as both PF/C have a mid-range game (or a very explosive mid/close game like the Clippers front court last season), you don't need a 3-pt shooter there.  Hibbert I will admit was broken offensively, but as long as 1 of the PF/C has a mid-range game it can still be effective if the PF has the strength to knock the small ball 4 out of post position.  Granted that bruising lineup doesnt work as good against a 4 like Ibaka that has strength and a long-range game - but those fortunately are hard to find.  We sacrificed a possible deep playoff run (ECF was not out of the question if we avoided the Cavs till the ECF) for an uncertain playoff experience but better rebuilding by adding on players at decent salaries the year before the cap jumps.  If we can solidify at PF/C by 2016-2017, we will be a fringe contender to get to the finals."

I will say this though, the Heat had a TON of injuries last year and there are still people who point to Lebron not being there and them missing the playoffs and that shows how great he really is. Ok, well the pacers went from the conference finals and #1 seed to out of the playoffs and it sure as hell wasn't because of Lance Stephenson. Pacers will be players this year!"

But in those 4 years, looked at as a whole. I don't think you can act like calling David West our most important player is insane. The guy was the boulder that held us together. He was so clutch. He was a team leader. He never seemed to let down. So yeah, Paul is our future no doubt, but West came in as a seasoned veteran and played like it."
pacers,3ch6bo,mizzourifan1,3,Wed Jul 8 17:40:47 2015 UTC,"Thats all fine and dandy but the pacers had no real shot until PG exploded in 2012-13 and basically out dueled Carmelo Anthony and that totally forgotten but awesome Knicks team. He then carried that forward against the Heat. You need guys like David west, but you can't have a chance at rings without a guy like Paul George unless you're the 2004 Pistons. PG gave us hope for rings. It's like Green and even Iggy in Golden State, theyre incredible players, but players like that don't get to have an effect on the game in a big way unless they have a guy like Steph Curry. That's why David west was an all star when he had Chris Paul."

pacers,3cgvul,zobee,4,Wed Jul 8 21:58:23 2015 UTC,"I think there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about next season and I am so pumped to see G Hill Monta and PG on the floor together, but to me there is a lot of uncertainty now. We basically just ripped the emotional heart of the team out by losing Hibbert and West. Neither West nor Hibbert have missed any extended time in the last few years that I can remember, and they set the tone for the team. IMO were the largest factors in the teams Chemistry while we made our playoff runs. G Hill was out most of the year last year and Paul pretty much all of it. The fact of the matter is this team still has a lot of question marks and is kind of an unknown quantity. I think it's appropriate for people to be questioning what this team can do now that those guys are gone. I personally think we will be good but the impact of those guys being gone is kind of hard to gauge ."
pacers,3cgvul,WTF_RANDY,4,Tue Jul 7 21:03:07 2015 UTC,"Of course, PG was arguably top 5 player in the league before the injury. But, even if he gets back to that level of play, we need a solid front court to compete. PG is not Lebron.  It's just frustrating to me that we have to go back into rebuilding mode."
pacers,3cgvul,Z-Tay,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:05:47 2015 UTC,"The thing is, were not in a complete rebuild, we just had to retool our front court. Turner is an excellent start as well."
pacers,3cgvul,zobee,2,Wed Jul 8 22:01:13 2015 UTC,If we'd make it to the playoffs last year with a healthy PG (on his comeback) I believed we would beat atlanta.
pacers,3cgvul,HATEUSCUZANUS,3,Tue Jul 7 21:15:18 2015 UTC,"Lebron has kyrie and Love -- Rose has butler, pau & noah -- Wade has Bosh and Dragic. --  Pg on the other hand has Monta Ellis and George Hill. Unless pg gets another star to help us, we are obviously not contenders. Far from it."
pacers,3cgvul,h3isenburg,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:28:02 2015 UTC,Who did the Hawks have? They were contenders last year.
pacers,3cgvul,iAMtHESushighost,3,Wed Jul 8 03:56:57 2015 UTC,"Well they had al horford, millsap, teague, korver, and carrol. Every single one of them is underrated. Imo horford and millsap are borderline stars. They also had budenholzer, a great coach from the spurs system."
pacers,3cgvul,danbryant244,2,Wed Jul 8 04:49:52 2015 UTC,"So we don't need stars to be contenders and if we do, PG and Ellis should be enough because PG + Ellis> Horford and Millsap."
pacers,3cgvul,iAMtHESushighost,4,Wed Jul 8 04:59:37 2015 UTC,"i agree, but one of the Hawk's main strengths was their depth. Sefolosha was injured, and carrol and korver were injured too. imo thats the only reason they couldn't make it further in the playoffs."

pacers,3cgvul,PaulGeorgeDaRealMVP,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:37:30 2015 UTC,"Paul George is very good, but it takes five to tango. Our frontcourt is gone and our chemistry is unproven. This team should be fun to watch, but I think expecting more than a four seed is optimistic. Ellis is a ball hog and if he doesn't accept P-Jesus as his lord and savior he could end up being banished to purgatory (the bench)."
pacers,3cgvul,onelapcatperchild,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:13:19 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is too many unknowns.  The default position when you have an unknown is to not get your hopes up.  Thats what everyone is doing.    Unknowns:   How quickly can PG13 return to form? Can George Hill be as effective as he was last year with the new team composition? How well will Monta Ellis gel with this team, if at all? What kind of performance can we get out of the 4 and 5 spots this year? Will Myles Turner be a factor this year at all?   Thats a lot of unknowns.  The combination of Hill, PG, and Ellis has the possibility of being lethal.  Turner could have an exceptional year and really expand our offense.  Who knows what we will do with the 4 when PG isn't sliding into that role.  All in all we could have a tough year, or we could be much better than people expect.  I think people are just taking a track that won't let them down.  If we are a 4-6 seed, people won't be too disappointed.  But if we do better, then we will be pleasantly surprised."
pacers,3cfcea,ericoxide86,9,Tue Jul 7 13:57:20 2015 UTC,Pumped to watch him run and gun!  Loved watching Dallas next year.  I think Monta and Larry's new look Pacers will really test the limits of Frank's offensive coaching capability.

Other notable occurrences have been the drafting of Robo Shaq and the removal of the net as it was considered redundant with the audio swoosh pumped in all the arenas."

pacers,3cfcea,PrimeTime17,3,Tue Jul 7 21:34:45 2015 UTC,True statement. I'm excited to see what he can do offensively as a coach. We already know he can get his team to play smash mouth d
pacers,3cfcea,Anicole2196,2,Tue Jul 7 17:53:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, watching the summer league games it looks like the early stages are going to be PnR heavy.  I have no idea how he's going to get PG13 open when he's playing the 4."
pacers,3cfcea,typs,2,Tue Jul 7 18:20:45 2015 UTC,"I do hope our drastically thinned front line can account for this.  Still, Ellis can be hidden on the worst wing or backcourt player."
pacers,3cfcea,Drak_is_Right,2,Tue Jul 7 17:11:08 2015 UTC,Helps that PG and GH are elite defenders for their position
pacers,3cfcea,herrrr-me-nerrrr,3,Tue Jul 7 17:21:26 2015 UTC,"PG is, GH above average but can struggle against some speedy point guards or big shooting guards."
pacers,3cfcea,Drak_is_Right,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:53:35 2015 UTC,I think his lack of defensive ability is a little overstated. He plays the passing lanes well and I wanna say he was one of the top SG's in steals last year.
pacers,3cfcea,eckrueger,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:35:15 2015 UTC,"Interested in him, but still have some reservations. Has to keep his attitude in check and fit in on defense. I know he won't be a lock-down defender, but he's gotta at least stay in front of his man for a while. Hopefully he can fit in with the offense too, be a team player."
pacers,3cfcea,eckrueger,2,Tue Jul 7 16:26:32 2015 UTC,"Again, I would say that his attitude is a little overstated. If anything, he's usually a really quiet  dude and seemed to be a great teamate during his tenure in Dallas. I know Dirk was upset to see him go, if that tells you anything."
pacers,3cfcea,Drak_is_Right,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:36:56 2015 UTC,Hope so. Just seemed like the Mavs were in a hurry to get him out of there and I've read several stories about his attitude.

pacers,3cg362,Drak_is_Right,6,Tue Jul 7 17:14:33 2015 UTC,Cool.  Listen to /r/nba and we will be lucky to make the playoffs.  You'd think Hibbert and West led the way to the playoffs instead of PG
pacers,3cg362,materhern,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:53:35 2015 UTC,/r/nba watches the Pacers play their team every year and that's it.  We somehow always surprise them and then the next year they sleep on us again.
pacers,3cg362,yobramine,-1,Tue Jul 7 19:03:13 2015 UTC,"Well, we've also lost Stephenson since we were any good. So we basically only have Hill and PG from our starting 5 that went to two ECFs. Not that Stephenson was the key, but he was flirting with being an all-star, it's an entirely different roster with many question marks and now without it's defensive anchor and veteran leader. The East is getting better with Washington, Milwaukee, Atlanta and others stepping up. I can understand why fans would dismiss us....we were 1 game away from losing in the first round to the Hawks with our entire roster intact."
pacers,3cg362,Victory33,0,Tue Jul 7 20:02:08 2015 UTC,honestly that was a complete collapse.  First half of the season we would of won the NBA finals.  Second half we were an 8th seed.
pacers,3cg362,Einsteiniac,3,Tue Jul 7 21:48:00 2015 UTC,That puts us at about the middle of the pack across the entire NBA. That's probably accurate.
pacers,3cgi5i,Sheffield178,2,Tue Jul 7 18:57:09 2015 UTC,Sullinger would be cool but his stress fracture and time missed because of that makes me a little nervous.  Olynyk we can do without.

pacers,3cewzz,wjbc,7,Tue Jul 7 11:18:41 2015 UTC,"They have to deal with it by changing the defense I think. That's just because of Hibbert though. I don't think losing West changes a thing. He was a good player, but didn't definite the system in any way I don't think. A large portion of the defense was having the guards and wings lock up the three point line, force them to drive and take a inefficient midrange jumper or go to the rack and challenge Hibbert.  I'll defend Mahinmi all day, but he isn't near the defender Hibbert is. He can replicate what Roy brought to a degree, but needs to cut down on fouls to stay on the court. If they don't sign any more big guys, the wings will have to trap, double, etc. more often. Kind of like Miami did to us."
pacers,3cewzz,eckrueger,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:57:59 2015 UTC,"I suppose PG can play the role of LeBron in the defense, but who will play Bosh's role?"
pacers,3cewzz,ISUCKATKARMA,3,Tue Jul 7 13:12:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think attributing to other teams in this case will be conducive here.  There really is no Bosh in this lineup, but Vogel will figure something out that will allow us to at least play without having a strong candidate for PF this year.  Will we get one next year? I hope so."
pacers,3cewzz,Z-Tay,2,Tue Jul 7 13:32:34 2015 UTC,"I guess PG can just play every position as needed, according to this sub."
pacers,3cewzz,eckrueger,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:39:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying we should copy them exactly necessarily. But you remember how much they trapped and doubled us in the playoffs. Back in the dark days of DJ Augustine (shudder). We'll have to do more trapping, doubling, pressing, and switching I think.  Also, Allen could be a poor, poor man's Bosh and maybe Turner some day."
pacers,3cewzz,yobramine,2,Tue Jul 7 16:17:12 2015 UTC,Develop the shit out of our young bigs and hope someone pans out.

I am going to miss the fuck out of David WEst. He was our main guy behind pg-13. Spurs got lucky and they will win next years ring. No doubt in my mind. Lakers on the other hand, will not make the playoffs."
pacers,3cewzz,materhern,4,Tue Jul 7 22:38:03 2015 UTC,"Play a style of basketball that they are not conducive too, just like they were planning to.  We should stop this idea that we ""lost them"", like maybe we tried to keep them and couldn't do it.  Bird had a plan and they weren't included.  The better question was what would we have done if we had kept them.  Because Birds plans involved doing something they were not going to physically be able to do."

pacers,3cewzz,Sheffield178,2,Tue Jul 7 16:36:42 2015 UTC,"PG will be playing the 4 at least some of the time.  Mixes of Turner, Mahinmi, and Scola at the 5 and 4 depending  on the situation is my guess.  But free agency isn't over yet, so we may see them bring someone else in as well."

pacers,3cewzz,Z-Tay,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:21:55 2015 UTC,"Make up for it with the addition of Paul George and Monta Ellis into the mix.  West and Hibbert both were shown last year to have weak points defensively that wasn't there two years ago. West especially. I've talked about it on the forums before but West has lost almost all lateral quickness. Which means a mobile PF(which is half the league) is going to take him out of the game. Hibbert, well... it's Roy who I hope has a resurgence now that he is off of the team. He mentally signed out two years ago.  I wish them both the best, but the only reason we won games last year was due to George Hill and Rodney Stuckey. Hibbert and West were contributors but that's about it."
pacers,3cewzz,theconmeister,0,Tue Jul 7 17:24:52 2015 UTC,"They will deal with it by winning only 25 games next season.  Watch out Cavs, we got Ian Mahimni and Luis Scola on the frontcourt (can't forget about Shanye Whiteman). But hey, at least we got rid of our two-time allstar so we could possibly sign Scola."

pacers,3cdgbs,MajicMarker13,25,Tue Jul 7 01:30:54 2015 UTC,"West is straight money shooting 15-18 feet out uncontested. Bruiser down low and a vet that will stick up for teammates. He WILL play his ass off.  Downside: lateral quickness...athletic big men like Blake Griffin, Dwight Howard (from what I've seen) can get him in foul trouble by getting beat off the dribble or overpowered down low by his ever-growing age.  At a veteran minimum, I think this is the value signing of the offseason so far. Take good care of him."
pacers,3cdgbs,xxx_neo_xxx7,5,Tue Jul 7 01:40:33 2015 UTC,His midrange stats are insane! A solid 15% better than Duncan and 10% better than Aldridge. And that is exactly what the Spurs need.. and in between game.  The shot be open for him consistently.  Thanks Pacer Bros.
pacers,3cdgbs,TonofSoil,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:32:50 2015 UTC,"A lot of people are saying he's old and he's in decline. Which looked to be the case last season, but a lot of that was motivation I think. The team was doomed.   I expect him to look fresher and energized next year."
pacers,3cdgbs,yobramine,8,Tue Jul 7 14:55:02 2015 UTC,"His age is catching up with him really quickly.  His shot is still good but isn't going down as much as it used to.  Average defender but he's been in decline a bit there as well,  will probably do well in a unit with Kawhi though.  People are talking about the massive paycut he took but it was getting to be a ridiculous overpay at this point.  Hope he does well, might be his last year so it'd be nice if he could get a ring with the spurs."

Literally NO ONE in the league wants any part of David West if things get a little chippy. I believe he was a Golden Gloves Boxer in college or something like that. He's fearless, doesn't take shit from anyone. With all this, his game is pure and beautiful. You'll fall in love with his jump shot from 15 feet or off of a pick and roll."
pacers,3cdgbs,Swagboi9,3,Tue Jul 7 11:25:18 2015 UTC,He's aging but still a nice defender and can still post up defenders and hit jumpers from the ebows. Probably not at the rate he used to but still consistant enough. Also he's a locker room god he took a team with Lance Stephenson on it 1 game away from the finals lol he a vet
pacers,3cdgbs,herrrr-me-nerrrr,3,Tue Jul 7 01:41:54 2015 UTC,"David Fucking West is a motherfucking boss  Midrange assassin Tough as fuck Offseason boxer Vocal leader Veteran  Plus, I've always looked at him as the security blanket - if your offense is cold, get it to West at 15 feet and he'll get you back on track.  I love David West, sincerely hope he wins a couple 'chips with y'all"
pacers,3cdgbs,iAMtHESushighost,2,Tue Jul 7 13:25:20 2015 UTC,"I think he will be much better with the spurs because of the reduced role leaving him much more efficient than he was with us (and he was still pretty efficient) has one of those midrange shots that surprises you when it doesn't go down, has great character, great in the pick and roll. Now even though he has great midrange (I'd say top 10 in consistent midrange today even when we were relying heavily on him), don't expect him to stretch it out to the corner 3 even. Played a little bit at Center, but I think he can play more but just didn't because Hibbert/Mahinmi."
pacers,3cdgbs,Camus145,2,Tue Jul 7 02:45:59 2015 UTC,"Tough as hell. He's a boxer in his free time. A smart guy as well, and he seems to have a serious, no nonsense personality."
pacers,3cdgbs,Drak_is_Right,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:02:50 2015 UTC,"Bit sub-par of a rebounder as he is a little short for a PF (and getting older now) so lacks a bit of quickness.  However, he can both outmuscle stretch 4s in the paint or hit a mid-range jumper.  Also pretty good at passing out when he lacks an open shot.  Can't really create his own shot these days unless going against a size or weight mismatch.  Still, can log some pretty decent minutes as a starter if Duncan or Aldridge is sitting and definitely should provide good scoring as a bench player.  Not sure if this still holds true, but the Miami Heat rarely ran small-ball against the Pacers.  Lebron tired far faster trying to wrestle for position with West then going against Paul George.  Put a SF or stretch 4 on West and while they might be able to cut by him, he will push them around in the paint and either deprive the other team of rebounding angles or set up easy post-ups.  Lacks the height though for a good post game against true PFs that he can't bully out of position.  he is one of the premier bruisers at the PF position."
pacers,3cdgbs,TheBeastCrew,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:52:08 2015 UTC,"Has lost a step or two defensively. Can't guard anyone quick or athletic, but he's strong as hell.   Offensively, his post game seems to have declined as well. But he's a great pick and pop player and is money from midrange. Good passer out of the high post.   Pretty clutch too. Won us plently of games over the past few seasons off his own bat, and almost without fail when we were in dire need of a bucket, we'd look to West."
pacers,3cdgbs,eckrueger,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:13:36 2015 UTC,"I think he will fit in well there. He has a great mid-range jumper. Great in pick and rolls. Strong. Great guy, and his character is awesome.  However, I was very disappointed with his effort last year after he found out Paul was hurt. Definitely not quick or athletic. He was hurt for a while, but he never really got into the game too much. Very disappointing. I don't think that will be a problem with fewer minutes and a strong contender."
pacers,3cdgbs,materhern,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:50:33 2015 UTC,"He'll fit in very good.  He needs to be on a team that can limit his minutes instead of needing him to play the lions share of minutes.  Half way through the season he started losing some of his shooting efficiency and not getting up and down the court.  Pop will limit his minutes and he'll be much more efficient down the stretch.   He's lost a lot of lateral movement and defensive quickness.  But his mid range is still money when he's not worn down completely.  He's tough as nails.  No one is going to push him around, not even at this age.  He'll go toe to toe with anyone standing up for his team.  He'll lead by example and play his ass off.    He also has the most epic stink face in the entire NBA which you'll see a lot because David West never believes he fouls someone :D"

pacers,3cdgbs,Drak_is_Right,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:43:42 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine he will get ~15-25 minutes a game, varying on injuries for the Spurs.  With Diaw at 33, Duncan at 39, Aldridge at 30, and Splitter at 30 - there won't really be big minute hogs. Maybe the most important is getting West will allow the Spurs to rest 1 big man for the entire game anytime they have a cluster of games."

His contract is $8m for this season, and after the Stuckey contract, we will be at ~$5.9m in cap space, so we would have to trade somebody making more than $2.1m to keep from going over the cap.    Edit: this is assuming the cap stays close to $67m.  If it jumps to $69m, the Pacers could be very close depending on where exactly the cap ends up at.    Edit 2: I am bad at math.  Cap room is closer to $11.1m, after Stuckey's signing."

pacers,3ccfaz,XC_Stallion92,-1,Mon Jul 6 21:34:36 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna rant here cause I know I'll get shit on in /r/NBA. The current model of free agency is completely ruining the spirit of competition and parity in the league. There are two options. All the best players team up to form these super teams, or good players take the league minimum (way below their pay grade) to form super teams.  I get that players want to chase rings, but it just feels like it's undercutting the point of the salary cap (which in itself should probably be fixed to a hard cap). I also don't know what an alternative system would be, but I'm just a little disappointed in how the system works I guess. The one good thing about recent free agency cycles is that people don't seem to be all that interested in only going to big media markets, which helps us out. We might be able to benefit from the broken system next year if PG is able to convince other big names they can win a ring here.  That's why I was so glad to see the Warriors win this last year. I know everyone loves the Spurs, and I like their players, but I don't like their team building model, and fuck everything if the goddamn Lebron super team ever wins another title.  Edit: ok, so does anyone want to explain to me why collusion is a good thing?"
pacers,3ccfaz,Victory33,12,Mon Jul 6 21:01:55 2015 UTC,"The Spurs team building model has been almost exclusively through drafting...Duncan, Parker, Ginobili, Leonard, Green, etc. they don't form super teams, they have always just been one through great drafting. So they signed like two solid players as their older guys are fading out, it's hardly on par with the Celtics/Cavs/Heat."
pacers,3ccfaz,poorchris,2,Mon Jul 6 21:51:38 2015 UTC,"No one would argue the Spurs haven't drafted well, but they've signed and/or retained high quality players for well below their market value.    The way player acquisitions have been going lately, specifically since the most recent lockout, is playing right into the owner's hands.  The cap rules are in place to spread the wealth and not allow big market dominance with teams like LAL or NYK signing every major FA to a super deal.  Instead, good players are signing for the minimum to ring chase.  Great players are turning down the max.    I completely agree with /u/XC_Stallion92, I don't exactly know what solves the problem but there's a flaw with the competitive balance of the league when everyone's flocking to the same teams each year.  San Antonio grabs valuable role players for under market value, every veteran who wants a ring flocks to Lebron's jock strap to win one.    Last year Tim Duncan was payed like a veteran role player but he was an All Star, an All NBA & All Defense selection as well as a DPOY candidate.  I'm not even voicing dislike about San Antonio or Tim Duncan.  I just don't understand the double standard for other guys teaming up and forming super teams as opposed to San Antonio's way of collecting tons of talent.  I'm not gonna lose sleep over the whole thing, this seems to be what the modern NBA is about.  It's just frustrating to me personally."
pacers,3ccfaz,XC_Stallion92,3,Tue Jul 7 07:45:46 2015 UTC,"But their players take well under their pay grade to stay there. I get that a lot of people think that's fine, I just disagree. Don't get me wrong, they have drafted great. I just feel that superstars taking role player salaries also undermines parity. But I agree it's the lesser of two evils by a long shot. It's only a slight irritation compared to the bullshit that Lebron's teams pull."
pacers,3ccfaz,Victory33,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:51:25 2015 UTC,"But they don't really have superstars. They have a bunch of guys that play very well as a team, Leonard wasn't even an All-star last year.

The same things we loved in Reggie for sticking around."

pacers,3ccfaz,Drak_is_Right,0,Mon Jul 6 20:57:41 2015 UTC,"West's decision I think hurts us this year (our gains will be nullified by our front court until Turner develops), but helps us in the 2 following years (by allowing us to sign multi-year deals that will be significantly cheaper then they will be next year).  We don't have the best lineup at the 1 through 3, but we might just have the deepest.  Edit:  Ellis, Paul George, and George Hill is a pretty decent starting 3.  Add in Godney, Miles, Rudez/S.Hill backing them up and that is a pretty deep 7 man rotation we can have for the 1 through 3 positions.  If Young is a steal, that will probably give us the deepest lineup at the 1 through 3 positions (Young could be out of the league in a year or two, could be a 6th man candidate).  Right now though our front court is Turner, Mahimi, Wittington, Allen.  Ouch.  We will have a bottom 10 if not bottom 5 front court this next season in all likelihood until Turner develops (typically some of the biggest gains in player development are between years 1 and 2, 2 and 3).  Will need to sign a quality starter, marginal all-star at PF next season to open up a possible eastern conference finals contender."

Would be nice if we could maybe get second round playoffs - but that won't happen unless we get halfway decent play out of the front line.  Allen....who else do we have at PF?  No...unless we get a starting caliber PF (which isn't likely given the salary cap remaining) Scola will be about our best option for either starter or reserve given he knows our team and is a good vet presence.
pacers,3cchov,Z-Tay,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:06:47 2015 UTC,"We wouldn't in an ideal situation. But Bird decided to trade our allstar center for some cap space in a year when there are NO FREE AGENTS AT ALL. Now Luis Scola has become the savior of this Pacer's sub, I don't share the enthusiasm one bit.  Great move, Bird. Time to go back into rebuild mode... AGAIN. We might be back in the playoffs in about 3-4 years if Bird doesn't completely fuck everything up again... and PG doesn't peace out to the Lakers."

Sure, we should experiment some and see how it works with him playing a four, but I still think PG is a small forward.

pacers,3c9blg,irollbrokenfingers,4,Mon Jul 6 03:20:45 2015 UTC,Can he shoot? I genuinely thought he was a one trick pony
pacers,3c9blg,Airegus,4,Mon Jul 6 06:43:24 2015 UTC,I don't think so. But do we need him to tbh? He seems like a smalled DeAndre Jordan.
pacers,3c9blg,irollbrokenfingers,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:12:37 2015 UTC,Idk I just think it's a slippery slope letting players that can't do something that important on the floor
pacers,3c9blg,burneezy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:17:06 2015 UTC,that is exactly what he is. you guys know Brian Shaw had a lot of problems with Faried right? and Shaw is the type of guy the Pacers want coaching....probably wouldn't mesh with the locker room tbh.
pacers,3c9blg,zoomapollo,5,Mon Jul 6 19:30:41 2015 UTC,You guys should watch his Team USA highlights from last summer. Overall i think he'd help the pacers
pacers,3c9blg,kneeonball,2,Mon Jul 6 03:34:22 2015 UTC,"It's better to watch his actual NBA games. He did well with Team USA, but he's playing with some of the best players in the world who draw more attention than him, plus the competition is less athletic on average.   I like him, but I don't know that we really get that much better by having him over our other options."
pacers,3c9blg,chiefmooseknuckle,2,Mon Jul 6 07:02:09 2015 UTC,"Besides like rebounding, points in the paint, rim and perimeter defense, and athleticism. But none of that junk matters in basketball its all about who has the newest shoes out and which guys get mentioned the most in rap songs."
pacers,3c9r7m,danbryant244,15,Mon Jul 6 05:14:31 2015 UTC,It's not a tank move when you can sign Stuckey and Scola directly because of the move.  Give a few months.  We still have Turner too you know.
pacers,3c9r7m,ISUCKATKARMA,3,Mon Jul 6 06:40:39 2015 UTC,And Shayne Whittington!
pacers,3c9r7m,Smart_Dumb,2,Mon Jul 6 13:25:58 2015 UTC,All hail his Whittingtoness
pacers,3c9r7m,ISUCKATKARMA,2,Mon Jul 6 14:35:57 2015 UTC,"You mean Shayne ""Lead the team in points today"" Whittington?"
pacers,3c9r7m,OyarsaRPM,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:08:47 2015 UTC,"Stuckey was a great sign, but can is there anybody better than Scola out there. I can't find a list of current free agents.  People are actually excited about signing Scola. Other people are excited about Whittington and Mahimni. I can't say that I share their enthusiasm.  These guys aren't going to help us get anywhere. Let's be honest here."
pacers,3c9r7m,Z-Tay,8,Tue Jul 7 06:30:11 2015 UTC,"Uhh.. Mahimi can start. Hes a rim defender as well. We drafted a center with our 11th pick. We got Lavoy ""Tristian Thompson"" Allen back. Scola and the Pacers have mutual interest. I reject the idea that our front court is going to be shitty. Also we could have Paul George play the 4 spot in certain situations."
pacers,3c9r7m,Duzaman,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:39:35 2015 UTC,thats true. And I think PG at the 4 in certain matchups is gonna be beastly
pacers,3c9r7m,Z-Tay,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:52:28 2015 UTC,"Uhh.. Mahimi can start.  We got Lavoy ""Tristian Thompson"" Allen back. Scola and the Pacers have mutual interest.   Oh boy, you're really a glass half-full kind of guy."
pacers,3c9r7m,Duzaman,3,Tue Jul 7 06:27:32 2015 UTC,I think that's the first time someone has told me that. lol Usually I'm as depressing as /u/DonnieNarco
pacers,3c9r7m,pfc_bgd,4,Tue Jul 7 19:13:18 2015 UTC,"First, I have no idea why you would even mention tanking...That's just a silly thing to say.  I think there'll be a lot of question marks because this will be a very different Pacer team that plays a very different type of basketball. Hopefully, we'll learn what works and what doesn't this season and figure out what pieces we'll need in the future while making the playoffs."
pacers,3c9r7m,materhern,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:02:46 2015 UTC,"i agree. I thought losing Hibbert for basically nothing would obviously be a step backwards. But with the FA signings and Mahinmi filling in, I don't think the frontcourt took as big of a hit as it first seemed to me, and the backcourt is 100% improved."
pacers,3c9r7m,Victory33,6,Mon Jul 6 20:27:17 2015 UTC,"Why on earth is it a tank move? Lets review some Roy facts.    Shot under 45% 3 years in a row.  Averages only 7 rebounds a game as a 7 footer.  Averaged less than 2 blocks a game last year, his lowest since his rookie season.  Averaged his lowest points per game last year since his rookie season, in a year without Lance or PG, which should have been the year he has more opportunities to score.    Its time to put to rest the idea that Hibbert is elite at anything at this point.  He's only an elite rim protector when they aren't calling fouls as much in the post season.  Less than 2 blocks a game is not elite.  His blocks are evened out by his turnovers which average nearly the same.  Less than 10 rebounds a game, less than 10 points a game, with as many turnovers as blocks, means he's not really giving us that much on the court.    Lets fact is guys, he had a year and a half that made us think he could be great, then he regressed to the mean.  Him leaving isn't going to be missed nearly as much as people believe it will be."
pacers,3c9r7m,materhern,2,Mon Jul 6 12:10:36 2015 UTC,"We were 4th in the league at opponents FG%, tied for 4th in the league in rebounds per game and the 6th best rebounding rate, #2 team at defending the rim. Who do you think was the cause of these stats with PG and Hill out most of the year and West playing like ass? Roy boxes out for teammates to get rebounds, Roy keeps guys like Lebron and Wade from coming into the lane and settling for jump shots...even if the stats don't show that having him there is a mental thing for most opponents. Blocks aren't as important as altering a shot, which the stats show Roy was doing well at like 3rd in the league (of qualifying starters) with 42.5% at the rim. I think we will see a lot more teams having success getting to the basket against us and PG won't be thought of as such a great defender when there is no one to stop guys that blow by him. Roy wasn't a stat sheet guy, he didn't rebound or score with the best of them, but he did a lot of things to help make us better by just being inside and boxing out."
pacers,3c9r7m,Victory33,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:29:45 2015 UTC,"Guess we'll find out this year.  Roy was out of position a lot.  I personally think we'll find out that Roy wasn't nearly as ""instrumental"" in our defense as the defensive scheme of Vogels."
pacers,3c9r7m,materhern,2,Mon Jul 6 13:35:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was as frustrated with him on offense as any Pacers fan. I wished he would just play pissed and assert some dominance, but I saw whenever he left a playoff series for foul trouble we would be screwed and the other team would just dominate us. I'd love to be wrong and he's replaceable, I really hope that's the case. But it's hard to find elite rim defenders, guys like Ben Wallace couldn't score a lick but was vital to his team's success."
pacers,3c9r7m,Victory33,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:39:51 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, we've always had problems scoring.  When you rely so completely on being defensively dominant, then any piece of that defense leaving kills you.  If we play faster paced and score more, losing Hibbert shouldn't matter as much."
pacers,3c9r7m,pfc_bgd,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:45:40 2015 UTC,I still think playing faster and scoring more is what O'Brien wanted to implement and it was awful for us. Defense first at least got us competing against the best teams and a #1 seed in the East. It's going to be hard to try to replicate what Golden State (who were ranked #1 defensively) does without any legit shooters on this team.
pacers,3c9r7m,Victory33,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:53:10 2015 UTC,"Roy boxes out for teammates to get rebounds   Who in the world can think that this is satisfactory from a 7 footer? If you're a center and a 7 footer, you get the effin' rebounds, you don't just box out...My goodness...  PG won't be thought of as such a great defender? What? Sure, having somebody protect his back is a plus, but he earned the reputation of an elite defender not because players just blow by him but because he can keep them in front of him, he's long, he's fast, he plays hard on D...  I really don't like it when people go over the top with coming up with excuses...seriously, ""Hibbs boxes out""...that's just ridiculously lame."
pacers,3c9r7m,Wafflecone416,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:48:43 2015 UTC,"He doesn't just ""box"" out...look at the fact the Pacers didn't lose any rebounding this year while losing Stephenson, PG, Hill and West for all or some of the season. He creates rebounds for everyone around him apparently. If our team is getting the 4th best amount of rebounds, then who the hell cares who actually grabs it? A PG or SG grabbing it is better for transition anyway. Rebounding obviously wasn't our problem last year...it was offense, and we added that back, Roy would have been a great piece with offense around him.   PG earned his reputation, in part, by being part of one of the best defenses in the league. If that falls apart so will his defensive notoriety. For example when Carmelo blew by him and Roy was there for the famous block, it made PG look a lot better than Carmelo hitting a possible game winning shot past him."
pacers,3c9r7m,pfc_bgd,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:06:39 2015 UTC,Individual rebounding means absolutely squat when the team is rebounding at a high level. Who gives a shit if Roy only averages seven rebounds if we are excelling every year in team rebounds.
pacers,3c9r7m,h3isenburg,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:42:34 2015 UTC,"who gives a shit? well, if the guards have significant defensive rebounding duties and cannot run out for easy buckets, that impacts the game some, doesn't it?   To say that individual rebounding means squat is silly."
pacers,3c9r7m,burneezy,2,Mon Jul 6 22:27:10 2015 UTC,"Keeping Hibbert would've been the tank move. It's better to get rid of him now and re-sign stucky and scola (eh) compared to riding it out and letting him go next year. Yeah, Lakers 2nd round pick is worth nothing but freeing up cap space to re-sign those two seems to be the better plan. Next year, we should have more space to sign a legit all-star if one is available.  I really, really hope that good players are available next year and we can get a few, if not, just one ""super"" star to play alongside PG.  another edit, p.s. we should've tanked last year."
pacers,3c9kbs,PeetaChip,13,Mon Jul 6 04:00:54 2015 UTC,I just want him to get decent minutes. I almost don't want us to sign a backup PG just so he can get 15-20 minutes off the bench as our backup point.
pacers,3c9kbs,Duzaman,3,Mon Jul 6 05:28:14 2015 UTC,"I agree, although I still think we need another backup PG, but let Young be the #2 PG so he can develop. Either Donald Sloan or bring back AJ Price again..."
pacers,3c9kbs,Smart_Dumb,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:06:57 2015 UTC,Stuckey will be the back up point guard.
pacers,3c9kbs,Duzaman,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:57:44 2015 UTC,That's not his natural position though. But it could work.
pacers,3c9kbs,materhern,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:15:32 2015 UTC,He's going to be the primary ball handler regardless of if they add another guard so why waste the cap?  CJ off ball and Solo at the 3 makes the most sense with the talent they have.  The money they'd spend on another guard would be better spent on the front court.
pacers,3c9kbs,rick5000,3,Mon Jul 6 23:23:36 2015 UTC,"I'm starting to come around to our draft picks.  I'm still uncertain about Turner, but I'm liking Young more and more. I hope he's able to get some minutes this year."
pacers,3c9kbs,Imthefatmann,3,Mon Jul 6 12:14:28 2015 UTC,"I lived in downtown Houston right next to the 3rd ward where his High school is (Yates). In like 2010 that was the greatest High School team ever. They beat teams by 50, 60, 70 ,80 90 and 100 points. He was their leader and can shoot. His father is Michael Young who was on Phi Slama Jama and played in the NBA. He was raised to play basketball.  He was the Pac 12 player of the year.  I think he is the steal of the draft. I might be bias. He can score, now can he learn to play PG in the NBA?"
pacers,3c9kbs,spidersilva09,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:39:02 2015 UTC,"I love his style of play, and his quickness and ability to stop and shoot after running full speed, will translate well into what the Pacers are trying to do in the upcoming season, fast-paced, three ball."
pacers,3c9kbs,70sixers,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:27:47 2015 UTC,Excellent pick. Especially for where he was drafted. I think he can come in and replace what CJ Watson did for us. Seems like an instant offense kind of player. Or at least that's what he provided Oregon. I worry about his PG abilities of running an offense. But if we don't need him to do much of that then Monta could potentially be a great mentor for him.
pacers,3c9q1j,MagiClipPaceRaps,7,Mon Jul 6 05:00:57 2015 UTC,Lakers fan here. I was wondering something similar. But your breakdown makes no sense. You have the Pacers getting Lin instead of the Mavs.
pacers,3c9q1j,Lightning14,2,Mon Jul 6 05:52:50 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer to pickup Lin, but I guess it is more likely that Cuban picks him up."
pacers,3c9q1j,materhern,3,Mon Jul 6 06:00:45 2015 UTC,"I really hope they aren't getting rid of Solo.  His dramatic improvement on the defense, combined with his clear push to get even better this offseason, make him a young asset on this team for building."
pacers,3c9q1j,OyarsaRPM,2,Mon Jul 6 12:13:22 2015 UTC,"He's not looking too hot in the summer league. Don't get me wrong I don't want to see him leave, but I wouldn't cry over it."
pacers,3c9q1j,materhern,2,Mon Jul 6 19:21:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah was watching today and was really disappointed in his play.  On the brighter side, I like what I see so far in Turner and Young."
pacers,3c9q1j,OyarsaRPM,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:24:13 2015 UTC,"Turner continues to impress but Young didn't exactly impress me in any particular way. TBH 4 assists, 4 turnovers, 0-3 from 3pt sounds like CJ Watson 2.0 to me. That being said, it was his first game so I'm not passing any real judgement yet."

pacers,3c7qz2,herrrr-me-nerrrr,8,Sun Jul 5 20:06:32 2015 UTC,"I was thinking this too, but really we already have four guys who could arguably run the point: Hill, Ellis, Stuckey and Joe Young. It may be a waste of money to pay a FA good money. maybe we would pick up that lithuanian summer league PG. Not sure.    We also have four guys who can play center: Ian, Whittington, Turner, and Lavoy. I think we will sign a couple forwards. Maybe Scola. Even Scola can play center, he does so internationally. I think they will look for mobile power forwards."
pacers,3c7qz2,TonofSoil,3,Sun Jul 5 20:20:35 2015 UTC,"Stuckey is our backup PG, he essentially was last season. All Watson was for us really was a spot up shooter"

I also tend to love the players, which is against u/redthrowsdropthelbow 's advice, but I definitely love the TEAM more.    Right now, Hibbert is leaving and on my wall I have the framed picture of his block on Melo that ran on the cover of the Indy Star.  I will always remember Hibbert for what he did for the Blue and Gold.    Now that League Pass exists I like being able to follow the players on their other teams.  Like I watched a lot of the Hornets last year because Lance was on the roster.  The worst is when the guy is essentially washed up or near the end of his career like Granger, because I can't just go watch him hoist a three for another team and remember all the amazing moments he had for the Pacers.      I was at the Heat game before Granger was traded to Pheonix and we gave him a standing ovation.  Moments like that are nice even though the players don't wear your squads colors you can cherish what they gave to you."
pacers,3c84so,pacerpower,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:45:43 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean to imply that you shouldn't follow former players or root for them when they're on other teams.  It's just that you have to accept the business element and the fact that loyalty isn't a thing in pro sports.  An easy way to do that is to root for the team over individual players.    Also, that block was a great, great moment.  I've been a Hibbert defender for years now, despite his incredible shortcomings offensively, and I think the Lakers robbed Indy by not sending any respectable assets in return.  But, it's definitely time to move on from Roy."

pacers,3c88dn,Camdenfalcon,6,Sun Jul 5 20:40:54 2015 UTC,"It'd be great, but I don't see Miami moving him and his contract is pretty big"
pacers,3c88dn,pacerpower,5,Sun Jul 5 21:02:28 2015 UTC,IT would be awesome.  I hope that happens as I think he would be a great pick up to fill in for our bigs and provide some veteran leadership.  I even think Turner could learn a lot from him on passing and shooting as the skill set Turner already has is similar to some the things McBob does.
pacers,3c88dn,herrkaizer87,5,Sun Jul 5 23:48:14 2015 UTC,"I would love having a passing big man like what McBob turned into, to help in a more up-tempo offense.  I'm not sure that a 2nd is enough to get him, though, unless Miami is more unwilling to pay the luxury tax than expected.  They can always move him next offseason if they really want the cap space."
pacers,3c88dn,Swagboi9,3,Mon Jul 6 01:18:37 2015 UTC,he'd be a lot better fit for us now than when he was earlier in this career
pacers,3c88dn,DrMayhemPhD,2,Sun Jul 5 20:43:19 2015 UTC,Yeah that's what I was thinking too.
pacers,3c7lxn,evanw96,4,Sun Jul 5 17:22:45 2015 UTC,I think its going to be Stuckey if we can get him. Our backup PG has really been either Lance or Stuckey the past couple of seasons.
pacers,3c7lxn,scottw5150,6,Sun Jul 5 18:04:24 2015 UTC,Sloan. He was basically just as good as CJ except his 3 pt shooting is slightly worse and he's way more athletic
pacers,3c7lxn,Shepherdsfavestore,2,Sun Jul 5 17:54:14 2015 UTC,But when he is on the court the offense stagnated last year. Hopefully with a new gameplan we can run a more uptempo offense that might be more suited to his style.
pacers,3c7lxn,NateThomas1979,3,Sun Jul 5 19:02:49 2015 UTC,Let's not forget Sloan had some great games for us last year.  I think he is serviceable.

pacers,3c70gf,Shepherdsfavestore,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:56:52 2015 UTC,"George Hill, Monta Ellis, Solomon Hill, Paul George, Ian Mahinmi. That's who I think will start, as of now. Obviously this can change easily depending on who we may snag. I'm also on the fence of Solo sitting and Lavoy Allen starting at 4.   The reason I don't have CJ Miles starting is because the Pacers need something from the bench and he's really all we have right now. Solo would be good to start because his defense is very good and would help with the lack of defense Ellis brings.  Mahinmi is good enough to start for now. I would assume Turner would take over in the middle of the season, but he would play a good amount of minutes either way since Mahinmi can't stay out of foul trouble."
pacers,3c70gf,Boom_Baby31,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:00:44 2015 UTC,"Right now with the roster as it is the lineup would be Hill,monta,pg...   Damn, that's a hell of back court   ... lavoy, and Ian/myles.   Oh boy, we got some work to do."

pacers,3c6gfm,NateThomas1979,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:38:52 2015 UTC,"I said this in another post, but the Pacers tried everything to help him to succeed and in the end he didn't produce. What did the Pacers get by trading him? More than they would have gotten at the end of the year had they kept him.  Trading him now gave them room to re-sign Stuckey and Scola solidifying their PG AND PF positions much more than what is left out in the FA market.   Hibbert gave them 11 ppg? 10.6 isn't bad, but his VORP was a .5! To put this in perspective stat-wise he was barely better than Ian Mahinmi was last year offensively.  So we had a choice of taking a hit defensively in losing Roy, but making sure that our PG position was still strong and we weren't relying on having zero backup for Hill/Ellis and as well we will now be able to re-sign Scola who we need to have this year since West made it clear he wasn't coming back BEFORE we traded Hibbert."

pacers,3c547d,Sheffield178,5,Sat Jul 4 22:00:19 2015 UTC,It's time to move on. Change can be a good thing. As far as I'm concerned dropping West and adding Monta was the best thing that could've happened this off season. We'll miss Roy on defense at first but will learn how to live without.

pacers,3c547d,schnebly5,10,Sat Jul 4 21:57:56 2015 UTC,Nobody. This is a poor trade if it goes through. We got Monta because we want to win now. Starting Ian Mahimni doesn't exactly go along with that.
pacers,3c547d,h3isenburg,6,Sat Jul 4 21:53:45 2015 UTC,If we can get some sort of asset then I am fine with it.  That would be better than him being dead weight this season and then losing him for nothing in FA next year.
pacers,3c547d,MC_Reagan,2,Sat Jul 4 21:58:43 2015 UTC,"What do you mean, like a draft pick? Why didn't we just not sign Monta then and get rid of Hibbs?   Then, next year, we would've had a good draft pick, another good one from the lakers, tons of money to sign people, a potentially starting caliber 4 or 5 in Myles Turner and a one more year of experienced version of Solo Hill."
pacers,3c547d,Wafflecone416,6,Sat Jul 4 22:02:48 2015 UTC,"There is so much up in the air right now I can't say anything for sure, but some positives from this situation would be getting a pick or a player from the Lakers, adding some players with the cap space (which we desperately need) and then getting the team a whole season of development under the new fast-paced system.  With Hibbert on the roster, we couldn't have made the full transition to small ball and would be just dipping our toes into our play style for the upcoming years.  This way we can jump into this system and work on it for a full year, then see what kind of holes in the roster we need to fill throughout the year and then in free agency the next summer.  We can also play with the starting lineup the whole year and see who fits where as far as our current roster goes.  I'm really just pulling things out of my ass right now, but I don't think we're completely fucked losing Roy right now."
pacers,3c547d,Faal,3,Sat Jul 4 22:09:19 2015 UTC,Those are some good points. We should definitely use the Hibbert money this week on some solid guys though. That's a necessity.

pacers,3c547d,schnebly5,3,Sat Jul 4 22:03:19 2015 UTC,We are not worse at all.   Bird and Vogel know  this. It's for the better in the long run.

Getting Stuckey back would be another great move although slightly less of a priority with the signing of Ellis. I'm comfortable with Miles as our scorer off the bench if we can't get it done.

pacers,3c5l3s,herrrr-me-nerrrr,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:59:47 2015 UTC,I like how you think and another option is that we could also trade for Terrence Jones if the Rockets are still looking to trade him.
pacers,3c5l3s,PotassiumAlum,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:35:50 2015 UTC,How much can you offer him? Keep in mind the Cavs can match.
pacers,3c5l3s,DemonicDimples,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:43:36 2015 UTC,Not enough after getting Stuckey back
pacers,3c5l3s,herrrr-me-nerrrr,3,Mon Jul 6 23:07:26 2015 UTC,"It'd be great if we could bring back Stuckey, what do you think about signing Brandon Bass? Kinda sad to see Roy go but I understand we need to move on with the way the league is trending and it's unfortunate that David took the comments personal and decided to leave for a contender, unless he ends up with the Spurs or Cavs I don't see how he gets a ring."
pacers,3c5l3s,Jsun2k15,5,Sun Jul 5 02:04:38 2015 UTC,I would be happy with Bass. He could be a solid starter at the 4. Any idea what kind of money he wants? He made 6.9 mil last year but he also had a down year. Almost all of his stats were worse than the year previous. I think anything less than 8 a year is definitely worth it.
pacers,3c5l3s,Airegus,2,Sun Jul 5 02:14:36 2015 UTC,Probably will just get Stuckey back and maybe Scola to fill out our roster.
pacers,3c5l3s,Frostler,2,Sun Jul 5 02:48:51 2015 UTC,SCOLA first.  Then....we bring back Psycho T.
pacers,3c5l3s,Imthefatmann,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:40:56 2015 UTC,"Scola and Bass are great options. But which would be the better option? I think Bass can play faster, but Scola adds more of a presence in the locker room being here for a couple seasons   Edit: I'd love for Stuckey to be back after we sign one of those, but do we even have money for him after signing a PF?"
pacers,3c5l3s,Anicole2196,2,Sun Jul 5 04:24:46 2015 UTC,Depends on the PF we sign...
pacers,3c5l3s,MC_Carty,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:10:00 2015 UTC,What the pay difference between Bass and Scola?
pacers,3c5l3s,Anicole2196,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:30:09 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't know much about him but what about Jordan Hill? Could add another Hill to the roster, I guess..."
pacers,3c5l3s,Skippy1813,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:26:21 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind stuckey and scola coming back also I think we should sign another big or 2 just to fill the roster
pacers,3c5l3s,Swagboi9,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:34:42 2015 UTC,"I think Pacers should go after Bargnani now that Hibbert and West have sailed the ship.  You wouldn't even need to pay him that much, probably something like 11million$ for 2 years with the second being a team option."
pacers,3c5xu1,notorious_kjk,4,Sun Jul 5 03:21:37 2015 UTC,Stuckey to a 3 year deal. I think he's turned it around and I love him on this team.
pacers,3c5xu1,XC_Stallion92,3,Sun Jul 5 04:53:17 2015 UTC,Called it
pacers,3c5xu1,kinglyryan,2,Sun Jul 5 18:32:55 2015 UTC,"While resigning Stuckey and Scola would be ideal. In addition to that, I would like to see us make a play for Thomas Robinson. I feel that would be a low risk/high reward scenario and that he would fit into our system that we're creating."
pacers,3c5xu1,Spartyyy,3,Sun Jul 5 05:17:34 2015 UTC,Thomas Robinson signed with the Nets two days ago on a two year deal.  I had similar thoughts before then.
pacers,3c5xu1,herrkaizer87,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:43:51 2015 UTC,Man! I completely missed on hearing about that. Thanks for filling me in!
pacers,3c5xu1,Spartyyy,2,Sun Jul 5 14:43:54 2015 UTC,"Has Tristan Thompson signed that deal with Cleveland yet? Our biggest hole is PF and there's almost nobody left out there, god help our ""fast pace"" if Scola is our starter...."
pacers,3c5xu1,Frostler,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:13:25 2015 UTC,"Lol that's not gonna happen, he's gonna stay in Cleveland. With that said, if somebody did get him to leave, I bet Lebron would leave again and that would be an even bigger shitshow than last time."

pacers,3c5xu1,PrimeTime317,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:26:37 2015 UTC,Brandon Bass?
pacers,3c5xu1,gugargioni,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:48:37 2015 UTC,I will probably get shit all over for saying this... But I have a hunch Gerald Green would fair much better in the Pacers new offense.
pacers,3c5u31,supermaor23,7,Sun Jul 5 02:36:17 2015 UTC,"Depends on the night, some nights you'll be pleasantly surprised and other nights he'll disappear completely. Overall I wouldn't count on him to put up consistent numbers just consistent defense. Really good deal for you guys imo. Pacers as a team are just going a different direction."
pacers,3c5u31,Jollyman,5,Sun Jul 5 03:10:46 2015 UTC,So hes basically the defensive version of Nick Young? haha
pacers,3c5u31,MrMoonManBand,2,Sun Jul 5 03:21:21 2015 UTC,If you have a good defensive scheme and don't ask anything of him on the offensive end he will be great man.  He protects the rim and can't be hacked.
pacers,3c5u31,mrtrollmaster,2,Sun Jul 5 16:17:51 2015 UTC,The difference is Nick Young doesn't physically limit your style of basketball to one option. You have to play slow tempo and run deep into the shot clock with Roy.
pacers,3c5u31,Airegus,5,Sun Jul 5 20:23:43 2015 UTC,"He's not going to average that much. I could see him averaging 12 points a game but hes not going to get 10 rebounds a game. That's what the majority of us pacers fans don't like about him. He should easily bring down 10 rebounds a game but he doesn't. His rebounding fundamentals are not good, he struggles to get position on much smaller players. He'll get you about 11/7/1. Last year he averaged 10.6/7.1/1.1"
pacers,3c5u31,iLikeUreddit,4,Sun Jul 5 03:11:14 2015 UTC,Your buddies at /r/lakers said it the best....  http://imgur.com/gallery/fUpVouf/
pacers,3c5u31,XC_Stallion92,2,Sun Jul 5 12:27:48 2015 UTC,Lol I forgot about 8.
pacers,3c5u31,Frostler,2,Sun Jul 5 18:00:58 2015 UTC,"He's built for playoff basketball where they let most body contact slide, in the regular season his defensive effectiveness depends on whether the refs are calling his vertical jumps a foul or not. Offensively he's good for a couple mid range jumps shots a night, maybe one of two hook shots too. I'd expect a 10/6/1 type year from him. He struggles mightily against teams with speed or teams that run a stretch 5. He'll win you a couple games, but he also won't even affect a lot of others."
pacers,3c5u31,moviescriptlife,2,Sun Jul 5 08:08:29 2015 UTC,"The only advantage he has with LA that he didn't have in Indiana is that big men are more of a role player on offense. He will mostly shut down scoring big men. He won't score much against them and will record even fewer rebounds, but he will be a defensive force. You'll be lucky to get 25 min a game from him. He wears out quickly."
pacers,3c5u31,h3isenburg,2,Sun Jul 5 16:34:53 2015 UTC,"You're getting nothing. Absolutely nothing. I can name 15 + centers that are currently better than HIbbert. No particular order: D. Howard, D. Jordan, A. Davis, Horford, Noah, Mozgov, Bogut, Nikola, Gasol, Book Lopez, Gortat, Chandler, Drummond, Asik, Monroe, Ibaka, Al Jefferson, Bosh (maybe PF) & Cousins. I can name more but It's too early. He will come close to double digit scoring but will never average 10 rebounds per game. Not even 9. 3 blocks is too much. 2.1 is reasonable.   You are getting a slow, non-rebounding, non-offensive center who's only good attribute to the game is free throws. He's so soft that he won't even get to the FT line. I think you guys are still a player or two away from making the playoffs. A healthy Kobe cannot make up for Hibberts garbage game.   I hope you guys do well but now that you got Hibbert, it's going to be hard to do that. Good luck. I like Kobe but, he's going to need real help in order to compete if you make the playoffs."
pacers,3c5u31,Lightning_Boi,0,Sun Jul 5 12:00:39 2015 UTC,"That comment gave me cancer. ""his only attribute to the game is free throws""? Gimme a fucking break."
pacers,3c5u31,h3isenburg,2,Sun Jul 5 15:56:54 2015 UTC,"What else can he do? Please tell me... There were 3 seasons where he shot below 45% for the entire year. 3 seasons. No center in the league history has shot less than 45% for more than 2 seasons. Majority of his shots are less than 10 feet from the basket and he's over 7 feet, yet, he shot less than 45% from the floor for 3 seasons already. Your attributing boy did that 3 times. The only player worse was Michael Olawokandi. It doesn't matter. He will be gone soon. He's the Lakers problem now. Sorry OP. p.s. He can jump straight in the air to disturb opponents from getting easy shots. 25% of the time it works, 25% it's a foul and the other 50% they lay it up."
pacers,3c5u31,Grangier,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:26:19 2015 UTC,"If anything, he's really going to solidify the interior defense"
pacers,3c5u31,DrMayhemPhD,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:26:46 2015 UTC,There is 0 chance of him averaging a double double.
pacers,3c5u31,NOTtrentRICHARDSON,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:10:32 2015 UTC,"Hibbert has the potential to be a game changer on the defensive side of the ball. Offensively he is serviceable most nights and pretty good other nights. Against the Miami Heat Roy Hibbert was GOD MODE. That tells me Roy Hibbert actually has the potential to be a game changer on both sides of the ball and a dominant rebounder.... the trick is motivating him to do so. He was motivated against the Heat almost every game so if the Lakers can find a way to get a Heat like performance out of him he will be fucking fantastic. If Kobe disrespects him, belittles him or hides his favorite shower luffa, it could be rough going. But if he is made to feel like a valued member of one of the most iconic NBA franchises, the sky is the limit."

pacers,3c3trv,mrpooh31,3,Sat Jul 4 14:56:31 2015 UTC,"Lavoy will need to be near the basket like Hibbert, he'd handcuff a potentially dynamic offensive group. No room to drive."
pacers,3c3trv,scottw5150,5,Sat Jul 4 15:09:56 2015 UTC,I think you're underselling lavory a bit. He has a decent midrange game.
pacers,3c3trv,scottw5150,5,Sat Jul 4 15:12:37 2015 UTC,He hits enough shots to convince him to shoot more midrange shots. He's not actually efficient.  Like saying Josh Smith is a decent three point shooter. You don't want him taking those shots.
pacers,3c3trv,scottw5150,2,Sat Jul 4 15:29:32 2015 UTC,"I mean it more in the sense of he got very limited minutes last year, so he didn't really get a chance to get comfortable taking midrange. I think if he gets more consistent minutes his midrange will look pretty good"
pacers,3c3trv,TonofSoil,4,Sat Jul 4 15:40:12 2015 UTC,"I think we end up re-signing scola and starting him, at least for the first half of the season."
pacers,3c3trv,scottw5150,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:13:26 2015 UTC,"I agree. Somehow we have to re-sign Scola. He was just as productive as West last year.   Right now it looks like The Pacers are at about the salary cap and need to sign three more players, not sure what they do. I expect Ian or Roy will be traded. As of right now Pacers need a backup point guard, a wing and a starting PF."
pacers,3c3trv,TonofSoil,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:04:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know if they would go for this, but I would love a Mahinmi for Patty Mills trade. After losing Baynes and Splitter, the Spurs need a backup big and it would keep LMA from having to ever play center."
pacers,3c3trv,scottw5150,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:42:47 2015 UTC,Interesting you say that. Ian and Roy used to go down to San Antonio and work out with Tim Duncan I think.   I was wondering if the Bulls would trade Hinrich for Ian. I wouldn't mind Hinrich being our backup PG.
pacers,3c3trv,TonofSoil,3,Sat Jul 4 18:11:31 2015 UTC,I would. Hinrich has been horrible of late. I would rather us keep a guy off of summer league and hope he develops
pacers,3c3trv,dirtydan1114,0,Sat Jul 4 18:14:47 2015 UTC,"Eh, I would have to disagree with you there. Hinrich has injury problems, but if he's healthy he's a good defender and an experienced vet for cheap (2.7 million or something). But it doesn't really matter 'cause it probably won't happen!  Those summer league guys are all just filler. If we want that we can just re-sign Donald Sloan."
pacers,3c3trv,makeyoucry,2,Sat Jul 4 18:55:01 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that Paul would be starting at the ""4"" on defense and we'd be essentially playing two small forwards.

pacers,3c3wcp,exWarlock,11,Sat Jul 4 15:01:14 2015 UTC,"Solo shot 1-10. Turner shot 8-11. Starting SL with nearly a double-double, and 3 blocks, is still great for a big man.

pacers,3c3eer,wocks,9,Sat Jul 4 11:14:33 2015 UTC,We were top 5 defense and rebounding last year and #2 in defending the rim with PG and Hill out for most of the year...that is wild to think about. Roy does the things that don't show up in the basic stats. If we lose him this year we drop at least 2-3 playoff spots. All we need is offense around him and he will be effective for us again.
pacers,3c3eer,Victory33,6,Sat Jul 4 11:37:36 2015 UTC,We can't afford both him and a bench.
pacers,3c3eer,GritznGravy23,3,Sat Jul 4 12:18:45 2015 UTC,"So you understand, we keep him and he walks for nothing.  He does not have to sign with us at the end of the year. He won't be an RFA but a UFA next year.   So the things that LMA is doing the the Trailblazers is what will happen with us next year as Hibbert simply looks to who gives him the most money and best opportunity to play.  I understand that you don't believe he has much value, BUT what makes anyone think that after this year he will suddenly have more? Instead he likely will stay plateaued and that's it.   We should take a look at the offers, try to make him a tasty trade bait to a team who wants his expiring contract and take whatever we can get for him."
pacers,3c3eer,NateThomas1979,2,Sat Jul 4 18:13:19 2015 UTC,"This is the best point. Long story short, it comes down to: get something for him, or just let him walk and screw us over next year? Yes, we will have that cap to work with other free agents, but most free agents don't find Indy appealing"

pacers,3c3eer,burneezy,3,Sun Jul 5 22:33:37 2015 UTC,"The problem is that if we keep him, we'll probably lose Scola and Stuckey. Stuckey is a fire off the bench and Scola was roughly as effective as D West for most of the season. Hibbert while strong defensively, doesn't warrant losing both of those players."
pacers,3c3eer,Siggycakes,2,Sat Jul 4 21:54:37 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. I really want to see what this lineup can do. Although I think our problem now is that we do not really have much money to sign anyone else without going over the tax, but we will see july 9th."

Pure joke. Yeah, we're losing him for nothing. With all that said, Roy Hibbert is still garbage and I don't want a player with 0 points 0 rebounds playing on my team. That's my two cents. Once again, Roy Hibbert is pure garbage. It's better that we run 4v5."
pacers,3c2t1u,mjridiculouz,9,Sat Jul 4 05:51:00 2015 UTC,"He wasn't able to stay healthy which is why Bird didn't really sign him. From my perspective he can do what you want from a backup PG - run the offense, score a little, spot up, decent defender. Nothing spectacular but generally solid. Probably 40-50 best PG in the league, puts him right as an average backup."
pacers,3c2t1u,herrrr-me-nerrrr,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:40:26 2015 UTC,"I was going to say the same thing.  I think he plays well as a backup option. He has instances of terrific shooting, but mostly he's a reliable backup.  I think he has better-than-average handling skills...but no idea how that matches with his statistics."
pacers,3c2t1u,slitt_vicious,6,Sat Jul 4 12:11:26 2015 UTC,"Longrange shooter, though sometimes streaky.  Biggest issue was health.  Solid signing if he is healthy for 65+ games."
pacers,3c2t1u,Drak_is_Right,4,Sat Jul 4 13:27:26 2015 UTC,When he first came to the pacers I asked my bulls/nets fan friend about him. He described him as a player who finds himself on winning teams. I like that description. Seems like a good locker room vet who can handle any situation capably. When he was healthy I loved watching him play. Good guy who does things the right way.
pacers,3c2t1u,GrandBasterd,2,Sat Jul 4 14:45:42 2015 UTC,He's a decent defender. I don't think we can give you a fair assessment of his playmaking ability though. We had Lance and Stuckey run the bench offense and create. So CJ ended up being a spot up shooter most of the time.

pacers,3c306w,CiprianBuci,3,Sat Jul 4 07:23:12 2015 UTC,He seems very close to a breakthrough. He doesn't seem to miss by much. I think he will surprise this season
pacers,3c306w,scottw5150,2,Sat Jul 4 15:14:25 2015 UTC,He's my 2nd fav Pacer right now. I hope he can continue to develop and become our starting SG/SF.
pacers,3c306w,h3isenburg,2,Sat Jul 4 12:52:28 2015 UTC,I like him as a dude off the bench for 15-20 min a night
pacers,3c306w,herrrr-me-nerrrr,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:31:09 2015 UTC,I think the summer league games will be very telling whether he can be an effective nba player. Didn't get off to a hot start last night with almost 30 minutes 1-10 shooting and 4 points with 6 fouls...
pacers,3c306w,schnebly5,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:36:05 2015 UTC,"I think he's a decent 4th wing, which he is now. We are set at wing for the next 2 or 3 years."
pacers,3c306w,DonnieNarco,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:17:07 2015 UTC,"Agreed. We will surprise some people this year as a team. I feel we have a lot of guys that are underrated. Solo Hill is a pretty good all around player, and boy does he hustle..."
pacers,3c47yj,PrimeTime317,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:51:54 2015 UTC,I think they're front runners for Stuckey too. How is that even possible? Must be nice to have an owner willing to breach the cap.
pacers,3c47yj,XC_Stallion92,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:20:43 2015 UTC,"True, sad thing is if Pacers fans boycotted malls in protest then he would probably just sell/move the team."
pacers,3c47yj,XC_Stallion92,3,Sat Jul 4 21:40:44 2015 UTC,Having an owner who cares more about profit margins than if the team is any good or not should make us feel lucky about the Colts having Irsay. He's the Mark Cuban of the NFL.
pacers,3c15jk,ISUCKATKARMA,15,Fri Jul 3 20:29:47 2015 UTC,"Lmfao @ the prospects of Lance and Hibbert together again, and of Hibbert playing on a team formerly called ""Lob City."" I'm cool with it; sign-and-trade Crawford to us with, Idk who else, and hell yeh."
pacers,3c15jk,MagiClipPaceRaps,11,Fri Jul 3 20:58:51 2015 UTC,"Roy would be better learning how to hit that fast-break-trailing 3, than he would be trying to catch alley-oops."
pacers,3c15jk,ThankYouPacedGod,10,Fri Jul 3 21:02:12 2015 UTC,"The implication I get out of this is there are definite candidates for Hibbert removal, and Hibbert may be gone for sure once all the marquee agents are gone also."
pacers,3c15jk,Frostler,11,Fri Jul 3 20:31:33 2015 UTC,"I just don't want us to trade him for nothing, we need to get a starting caliber player back for him at least."
pacers,3c15jk,swampking,5,Fri Jul 3 21:06:51 2015 UTC,"Which we aren't getting.  There's nobody available that is an upgrade over Hibbert.  He's overpriced for his production, but that's excusable when it's an expiring contact."
pacers,3c15jk,Frostler,9,Fri Jul 3 23:09:27 2015 UTC,That's why I'd rather keep him this year and take the cap room next year instead.
pacers,3c15jk,pacerpower,5,Fri Jul 3 23:19:52 2015 UTC,Hibbert and LANCE reunited!
pacers,3c15jk,Galt2112,2,Fri Jul 3 20:58:24 2015 UTC,I don't want to like the Clippers.
pacers,3c15jk,NateThomas1979,3,Sat Jul 4 14:02:49 2015 UTC,Does anyone know if Hibbert has a trade-clause agreement or not? I just wondered due to the Clippers being a HORRIBLE fit for someone of his skillset. Seriously? A fast-paced lob-city team and you want to plug in a guy who lumbers down the court and gets pushed around by SG/SF type players?  Just interesting if the Clippers were to consider signing him.
pacers,3c15jk,NateThomas1979,4,Sat Jul 4 02:07:27 2015 UTC,"They had rim protection too.  DJ went bye-bye, so they at least have to be thinking about that.  Hibbert will probably just end up being a temp for them while Clips try to figure out what to do for the year without DJ.  Of course, this is all hypothetical and I really can't see Clips biting on it especially with Lance at LA now."
pacers,3c15jk,MagiClipPaceRaps,4,Sat Jul 4 02:30:38 2015 UTC,"The only way I can see the Clipper's playing with Roy is if they play 4 on 5 on offense and leave Roy on the defensive end to stop them.  Come to think about it, I wonder if anyone has ever done something like this as an offense either in the NBA or in college?"
pacers,3c2c1i,Pacers31Colts18,4,Sat Jul 4 02:48:36 2015 UTC,"Be smart Indiana, sign Mantas Kalnietis asap, before someone steals him.  Mantas Kalnietis"
pacers,3c2c1i,Houston_sucks,2,Sat Jul 4 11:37:42 2015 UTC,This game is not his game.  He is sucking right now.  Hopefully we see something the second half.  But right now he is hurting the team with his effort and turnovers
pacers,3c2c1i,pacerpower,2,Sat Jul 4 14:04:54 2015 UTC,"Yup, second half was totally different story."
pacers,3c2c1i,Houston_sucks,4,Sat Jul 4 14:58:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah well he haven't played seriously like a year or so due to injury.Second half was much better.He is a team player, as you can tell from the assit number.Honestly I believe the next game will be much better for him."
pacers,3c2c1i,Labasaskrabas,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:48:35 2015 UTC,He even got better in the second half when he started working with Turner in the pick and roll.  I liked what I saw from him then.
pacers,3c2c1i,pacerpower,5,Sun Jul 5 23:31:22 2015 UTC,Can't believe the shooting touch on Myles!  I like what I am seeing.  He is also altering a ton of drives.
pacers,3c2c1i,pacerpower,5,Sat Jul 4 13:46:44 2015 UTC,"20 points, 8 rebounds and 3 blocks for Turner in his first official Summer League game. Should be a fun week."
pacers,3c2c1i,kinglyryan,3,Sat Jul 4 14:53:42 2015 UTC,Anyone hear anything about Jarrell Eddie? Im a huge Hokie fan and would love to see him stick on a roster.
pacers,3c2c1i,jsmooth4hawks,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:54:15 2015 UTC,"I like the guy, he played really well."
pacers,3c2c1i,ThankYouPacedGod,2,Sun Jul 5 00:33:47 2015 UTC,Excited to see Trent Lockett on the roster. I met him briefly through the athletic department when I was at Marquette and he's a really nice guy.
pacers,3c2c1i,XC_Stallion92,2,Sat Jul 4 04:17:56 2015 UTC,"Myles Turner has looked really good this half. I haven't seen that much Joe Young though, anyone know why?"
pacers,3c2c1i,kinglyryan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:46:58 2015 UTC,Not sure why he hasn't made it in.  Would rather see him in than Dorrel Eddie.  Hopefully he gets some min soon.
pacers,3c2c1i,pacerpower,2,Sat Jul 4 13:54:19 2015 UTC,I think he was sick
pacers,3c2c1i,McGinge,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:10:01 2015 UTC,At the time I had said this Eddie hadn't done much... by the end of that game I wanted to see more Eddie :)

pacers,3c2c1i,paul24george,2,Sat Jul 4 18:26:24 2015 UTC,Turner turning over his right shoulder for the baseline jay was beautiful!
pacers,3c2c1i,pacerpower,2,Sat Jul 4 13:53:14 2015 UTC,"11 points, 6 rebounds, 2 blocks from Turner in the first half."
pacers,3c2c1i,kinglyryan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:01:54 2015 UTC,The shots he has made has really blown me away!
pacers,3c2c1i,pacerpower,2,Sat Jul 4 14:07:38 2015 UTC,Turner looks freaking good.
pacers,3c2c1i,PacersBoi,2,Sat Jul 4 14:29:44 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I checked out last season after PG went down and we didn't resign Lance. My question is how bad or good is Solomon Hill? Because he looked absolutely awful today."
pacers,3c2c1i,NSmith22,4,Sat Jul 4 15:02:34 2015 UTC,"By my assessment, he's a plus defender but a poor shooter. Not a broken shot though. He just seems to not be able to hit shot. He has a drive or two a game where he violently attacks the rim and just barely missed a poster. He also has some decent offensive games here and there. I personally think he hits a breakthrough one year"
pacers,3c2c1i,scottw5150,2,Sat Jul 4 15:09:48 2015 UTC,I hope Turner shuts the fan base that doesn't like him up. This is a pretty solid start to say the least. I'm super happy we drafted him

pacers,3c2c1i,Yebreham,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:57:30 2015 UTC,Solomon Hill has played like absolute ass so far
pacers,3c15k3,AlamAbaAb,3,Fri Jul 3 20:29:53 2015 UTC,"Much as I disagree with the choices for this list (should be more G-Hill, especially with his circus shots, amongst other issues), what it does illustrate for me is that even though we weren't contenders this was a genuinely enjoyable season - admittedly frustrating at times - to watch. The run at the end which brought us within one game of a playoff spot was captivating as was the return of PG, and even our run in early Jan/Feb (?) was pretty exciting to watch. Disappointing a season as this might have been in terms of the outcome, our Pacers showed some real spirit and it was a joy to watch."
pacers,3c15k3,Lightning_Boi,2,Fri Jul 3 20:32:22 2015 UTC,I agree with all of this. It was really nice to have a season where their wasn't as much pressure from the playoffs and drama form lance or anyone. Everyone played hard and we're this close to the playoffs. I'm proud of this team.
pacers,3c0v1r,Pacers31Colts18,0,Fri Jul 3 19:08:05 2015 UTC,Right now that role is trade piece. Don't hurt yourself Hibbert. You're going to Cali.
pacers,3c157k,Indiana_Pacers,5,Fri Jul 3 20:27:18 2015 UTC,"They can't offer anything of value to us though, I'd still rather keep Hibbert this year because we kind of need a rim protector too especially with Monta Ellis on the perimeter."
pacers,3c157k,Frostler,4,Fri Jul 3 20:48:02 2015 UTC,Is this confirmed - pls Deandre don't do it
pacers,3c157k,AlamAbaAb,3,Fri Jul 3 20:33:39 2015 UTC,The people who support this idea are ridiculous. How would this make us better? Are we trying to go as far as we can or not?
pacers,3c157k,Lightning_Boi,3,Fri Jul 3 20:50:43 2015 UTC,"Hey, uh, can we have our Lance back?  Jk, give us a PF and cap space"
pacers,3c157k,JASjack,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:36:20 2015 UTC,I think lance knows he fucked up. Especially now since mj did not even keep him. Now he will be shifting through teams until his 4 year deal is done.
pacers,3c157k,Potomato,2,Fri Jul 3 22:32:50 2015 UTC,"He'll be done with his contract after this year. It was a three year contract with a team option, so the Clips don't even have to keep him for 16-17 if he has another bad season."
pacers,3c157k,TonofSoil,2,Fri Jul 3 23:18:15 2015 UTC,I'll take Blake or CP3.
pacers,3c157k,MC_Reagan,2,Fri Jul 3 21:23:00 2015 UTC,Yall want Crawford?  Them 3s though

pacers,3c0ume,Pacers31Colts18,2,Fri Jul 3 19:04:58 2015 UTC,Plot twist. Larry isn't getting a PF because he is gonna play Whittington this year
pacers,3c0ume,Anicole2196,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:27:54 2015 UTC,You know I saw some good court vision from him when he was playing. I think he might blossom into something big. Larry sees something in him.
pacers,3c0ume,Potomato,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:30:52 2015 UTC,"He looked to have decent range to, but had little confidence in his game. I hope he gets a decent chance"

pacers,3c18z4,USTS2011,4,Fri Jul 3 22:16:04 2015 UTC,I don't get why we would do this when we're already signing Ellis. Why would we also take Felton? That sounds awful.
pacers,3c18z4,makeyoucry,2,Sat Jul 4 00:06:23 2015 UTC,Just to get rid of Hibbert
pacers,3c18z4,USTS2011,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:14:32 2015 UTC,Who would be our centers then? I don't think Larry will get rid of Hibbert without a plan for another center in place. I'd rather have his big body in the paint than losing him and gaining Felton like someone suggested. Makes no sense.
pacers,3c18z4,irollbrokenfingers,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:52:00 2015 UTC,This.  Im hoping it plays out this way. Monta s&t with you guys for Hibbert. The 15 mill you would be paying Hibbert isnow used on Monta/Felton. Fair enough Felton is meh but you get Monta without it affecting your salaries really.  We trade to Clippers for Deandre s&t. Not sure what else we would offload for salary.  Then hopefully Suns get LA and we do a s&t with them for Morris + someone. (they need to for cap space)  Mavs might get some cap space through all this  Every1 wins : D  (sorry for spamming your forum im just excited and was seeing how u guys are feeling)
pacers,3c18z4,oz82,2,Sat Jul 4 03:30:32 2015 UTC,"Lakers, but you probably should keep him since there aren't that many replacements left."
pacers,3c18z4,rejectx,-13,Fri Jul 3 21:28:08 2015 UTC,"Since the 90S era, you found Hibbert to be your favorite Pacers player? My friend, we need to have a talk about Pacers basketball.  I think the Clippers (I doubt it since they got lance the dumb a**) can get him but not sure if they want a turtle playing with rabbits."
pacers,3c18z4,h3isenburg,5,Fri Jul 3 21:29:24 2015 UTC,Like we're not entitled to opinions
pacers,3c18z4,ISUCKATKARMA,-5,Fri Jul 3 21:52:46 2015 UTC,"It's great that he/she and others have opinions. I just think that liking Hibbert out of all the players we've had in the past, especially going back to the 90s, is odd. It's the same as liking a player that has a big contract and is even a bigger disappointment. It's like Clippers fans liking Michael Olawocandi. The cavs must love Anthony Bennette. Don't want to talk about #1 picks? Amare had a big contract and sucked; however, at least he gave a few years of good performances and not a few games. Gilbert had a bad contract; however, the Wizards fans still love him. Alan Houston, a knick favorite. I don't see any Rashard Lewis or Elton Brand fans out there. Man, liking Hibberts game (I almost forgot, the user mentioned that he had an awesome 20 some point game, HAH, stomach hurts or I would laugh my ass off) is the same as liking the WNBA. Soft, slow and can't dunk unless you're open."
pacers,3c18z4,h3isenburg,4,Fri Jul 3 22:27:26 2015 UTC,"So? Let them fucking like them.  I am going to call you out on your shit.  I am so sick and tired of reading your posts here, where they are much more public compared to some of the more popular subreddits where you'd be hidden.  In most of them, you make your hate of Hibbert very public.  I saw this comment before you edited it.  You literally edited your comment to argue why no one should like Hibbert.  Let me tell you something- YOU ARE ARGUING WITH YOURSELF ONLY.  No one cares if you like Hibbert or not.  I'm not completely partial to having Hibbert here anymore, but I don't tell other fans to dislike him as much as I do.  Imagine you are saying this exact comment to OP.  I can guarantee you that most of the commenters will laugh at you as soon as you open your mouth, and leave you in the middle of your rant.  You are now bringing sexism into this argument.  I don't watch WNBA and probably never will but does it justify me calling it slow and soft?  Think about what you said, and how other people would react to this.  I am tired of reading your shit.  Period.  Stop slinging your hate and shit at everyone else.  We are human beings, deciding consciously to shit in our toilets, while you go wild and ape yourself out, shitting and throwing them at us.  You know, you're like /u/rabsho over at the Warriors subreddit.  You know what he did?  He was exactly like you and slung his hate of Barnes all over the place, saying he has to be traded and everything.  Guess where he is now?  Barely comments and won't respond to call-outs from the subreddit, and now is the laughingstock.  This is a fucking warning.  Don't become the laughingstock of this subreddit."

Liking him as a Pacers fan tells me one of two things. You're either really, really dumb or you don't watch basketball. I think that guy was probably both. With that said, this is the internet. You think I give a shit about whether people read my comments or not? You could be a 4 year old girl behind that computer. I alwasy edit my comments to make sure I try to use proper grammar. I don't regret saying anything bad about Hibbert, nor will I ever. Dude is pure garbage and doesn't belong in a Pacers uniform. I'll keep writing a lot of stuff. I hope you read it!! woot woot. P.S. JK, I didn't read your comment LMAOOOO. peace."

pacers,3c18z4,h3isenburg,2,Sat Jul 4 01:59:45 2015 UTC,"We can talk a lot about Pacers Basketball.  I like bigs and I watched Hibbert go from a scrawny guy to 26 points on Miami like its no big deal. I also watched his fall, but I love the guy for all he did for our team and how he worked his ass off to go from nothing to All-star. Sure I cried when Danny left, but for the most part from the Reggie era to today there have been few players to love.  I mean think about our rosters post Malice...Reggie leaves 04 ...05 Jeff Foster 06 ???? 07-11 Jim O'Brian years with the likes of McBob/Dunleavy and every white guy in the NBA hoisting 3s..."

pacers,3c0c8u,Duzaman,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:50:25 2015 UTC,I think Bismack would be a great pick up if we shed Hibbert.  He is athletic enough to keep the pace Larry wants and would still give us some rim defense and rebounding.  Given we would have 4 other offensive studs on the court we can afford his insufferable offense.

pacers,3bzf2u,scottw5150,2,Fri Jul 3 14:03:58 2015 UTC,"From what I heard, the (apparently) well-known /r/AMA Community Representative, Victoria, was fired suddenly and without warning, and the whole of reddit went up in arms, privatizing subreddits in protest of her termination. Why she was terminated, I believe, has yet to be released.   I'm seriously just on reddit these days for Pacers, nba, shower thoughts, fan theories, and ""trees"" culture. I browse other shit occasionally, but I couldn't care less about protesting. I got fired recently, too, and it was for doing something stupid. So the way I see it, since I don't know what happened, maybe she just messed up. Slept with an AMA guest, idk. I wouldn't blame her. We're all human. But this is the internet, so fuckit."

pacers,3bzf2u,My5Pennies,10,Fri Jul 3 12:18:00 2015 UTC,"I say no mainly because it's the prime of the free agency and as great as /r/pacers is, it's not like a sub with 2,320 readers going private is gonna be a huge game changer for reddit.   Plus /r/nba isn't even going private and our decorum is very much the same as theirs in many ways."

pacers,3bzf2u,pickle_man_4,2,Fri Jul 3 16:06:24 2015 UTC,Sorry man I didn't mean it like that. The work you put into this sub is impressive.
pacers,3bzf2u,AlamAbaAb,2,Fri Jul 3 16:43:21 2015 UTC,I do!
pacers,3bzf2u,coda19,2,Fri Jul 3 17:40:41 2015 UTC,Why/how is reddit burning to the ground? I haven't been here the last couple days and everything went to hell.
pacers,3bzf2u,MisterCheaps,5,Fri Jul 3 14:01:14 2015 UTC,idek apparently someone on the reddit team called Victoria has quit and apparently that has thrown everything into chaos - I'm still far too new to this reddit thing to understand why that is so significant
pacers,3bzf2u,coda19,7,Fri Jul 3 14:30:56 2015 UTC,She didn't quit. She was unexpectedly fired. She was integral to a very popular subreddit (iama) that drove insane traffic to the site. Without her that subreddit literally cannot function. They had to go private to figure out a way to function without her. Many other popular subreddits think it's bullshit that she was fired so they went private as well. Basically a big fuck you to corporate reddit.
pacers,3bzf2u,exWarlock,3,Fri Jul 3 14:42:18 2015 UTC,Don't forget that it sounds like she was fired for objecting to monetizing AMAs so Reddit could profit and the celebs could just use it as paid advertising.
pacers,3bzf2u,Indiana_Pacers,2,Fri Jul 3 20:52:52 2015 UTC,Yes. This. Fuck that shit.
pacers,3bzf2u,bearcatfan2639,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:51:49 2015 UTC,I didn't know this is what happened. So I guess that's cool that she stood for something.

pacers,3bzf2u,h3isenburg,3,Fri Jul 3 16:29:19 2015 UTC,Ah college. Enjoy it! Seriously I know the nevous feeling but it's much better than real life. Minus the whole money thing ;)
pacers,3bzf2u,ThankYouPacedGod,3,Fri Jul 3 20:32:34 2015 UTC,"Parents are paying for it, does that mean straight profit :)?"
pacers,3bzf2u,h3isenburg,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:35:52 2015 UTC,"congrats and good luck on the new domicile holmes.   If we dump Hibbert in a s&t with Dallas, how much $ do we have to spend on other FAs? Is dumping Hibbert this year (If Dallas wants him) worth it or should we wait until next year?  Like I said before, not a caps guy, don't know much about it. I just watch the game."
pacers,3bxktv,Pacers31Colts18,6,Fri Jul 3 00:00:37 2015 UTC,At worst I think he becomes a solid bench piece for us. After being on the team for a year and lack of PFs I think he could get some nice play time this year
pacers,3bxktv,scottw5150,3,Fri Jul 3 00:35:28 2015 UTC,"When he got minutes last year he was pretty good, I'd kind of like to see what he could do w/ starters minutes out of curiosity."
pacers,3bxktv,Frostler,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:43:56 2015 UTC,I think we ended up trying that and he got fatigued and didn't get as many offensive rebounds and started to lose his shot because he wasn't ready for it.
pacers,3bxktv,iAMtHESushighost,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:27:42 2015 UTC,"That's why I'm excited to see what he can do when he is ready for it.  If he can keep the same rebounding per minute numbers close, playing 20-22mpg, he's be one of the most underrated players in the NBA."
pacers,3bxktv,typs,5,Fri Jul 3 17:44:32 2015 UTC,Looks like the deal is 3 years/12 Mil. The front office is doing a great job with these contracts.
pacers,3bxktv,mcs3144,3,Fri Jul 3 02:53:35 2015 UTC,"We need a solid PF to start, and we'll be set for a while."
pacers,3bxktv,Lightning_Boi,4,Fri Jul 3 00:03:16 2015 UTC,hell yeah! I was worried he would get pried away from us.
pacers,3bxktv,mrpooh31,2,Fri Jul 3 00:13:16 2015 UTC,Details? Awesome news
pacers,3bxktv,theconmeister,2,Fri Jul 3 00:11:19 2015 UTC,"Awesome news, what kind of minutes you guus think he'll get?"
pacers,3bxktv,yobramine,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:09:38 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on his conditioning. He's a quality player, but he isn't very quick up and down the court. If the Pacers want to play at a higher tempo, that may limit his utility. He seemed to tire pretty quickly in a number of games last season."
pacers,3bw422,Pacers31Colts18,30,Thu Jul 2 17:08:57 2015 UTC,Bring it in guys! Hugs for everybody!

pacers,3bw422,rps215,28,Thu Jul 2 17:17:01 2015 UTC,"Enjoy him. Don't expect a lot of good on ball defense, but he will rack up steals, and is excellent at running the fastbreak. I really hope he does well with you guys."
pacers,3bw422,rps215,16,Thu Jul 2 17:10:55 2015 UTC,Thank you. Hoping we can send you guys Hibbert in return as a sign of good will. I feel like he's been a guy that Bird has wanted. The rumor back in the day was always Granger for Ellis.
pacers,3bw422,KyleRaynerGotSweg,9,Thu Jul 2 17:15:22 2015 UTC,"Is it possible we could do a S&T for Hibbert and Ellis?  Yeah, I wish I could've seen that. Granger was a personal favorite of mine back in the day."
pacers,3bw422,Smart_Dumb,8,Thu Jul 2 17:17:13 2015 UTC,"That's what I keep wondering. We have roughly 12 mil in cap space, a lot of free agents, and just signed Ellis to 11 mil. I think it almost has to happen, or something has to happen with Hibbert."
pacers,3bw422,Bran_TheBroken,3,Thu Jul 2 17:30:29 2015 UTC,"We have to do something with him or we don't have any cap room left to fill a lot of holes, especially in the bench. I'm guessing that Larry has something else in place to make cap room, there's no way he would leave us with such little cap space having so many holes left."
pacers,3bw422,DPLaVay,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:46:45 2015 UTC,"Is it possible for this to turn into a sign and trade with Dallas? If so, when is it too late for this to become a S & T for Hibbert? Obviously, we need to see what DJ does first, but what is the hard ""too late"" date?"
pacers,3bw422,tergiversation,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:07:01 2015 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken no one can officially sign anything until the ""moratorium"" ends, which is I think the 10th. So we have some time."

pacers,3bw422,sportsguy3,17,Thu Jul 2 18:38:49 2015 UTC,"In light of all the money that's being thrown around in free agency this year, that's a helluva deal for us."

pacers,3bw422,typs,7,Thu Jul 2 18:04:11 2015 UTC,Finally getting some offensive fire power!!
pacers,3bw422,OhTheStatic,5,Thu Jul 2 17:19:43 2015 UTC,Enjoy some Monta highlights
pacers,3bw422,mooney2j,2,Thu Jul 2 17:28:56 2015 UTC,"Number 8 is against us, lol.   EDIT: Number 7 was the best, IMO"
pacers,3bw422,trackbaby,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:59:18 2015 UTC,Number 3 was straight out of NBA 2k. Where you're just trying to move the stick in the right direction and smashing the shoot button. Great highlights.
pacers,3bw422,ILikePizzaRolls,5,Thu Jul 2 18:24:53 2015 UTC,"Great contract.  I now wonder what's our cap space look like, and what exemptions will be available to fill out the roster.  If we still have the $5mil MLE that's good enough for Stuckey, or a PF.  Here's hoping DeAndre Jordan doesn't sign with Dallas and they're forced to trade for Hibbert.  That opens up a lot of money to hopefully bring back guys we need."
pacers,3bw422,poorchris,2,Thu Jul 2 20:02:59 2015 UTC,"Such a great pick-up for you guys. I knew the Bulls had no shot at getting him (and realistically we have no reason to go after him), but mannnn he's a dangerous guy. I'm really hyped to see this team compete with Chicago, Cleveland, and Milwaukee."
pacers,3bw422,jkopecky,12,Thu Jul 2 17:36:27 2015 UTC,"UPVOTE PARTY, ANYONE?!?? /s  But seriously though. This is one of the best things that could've happened to us this offseason outside of Hibs opting out. Super excited for our future. 3+ years of Monta, baby!  Monta Ellis have it all  http://youtu.be/7G9yS2-x5sA"
pacers,3bw422,poorchris,3,Thu Jul 2 18:42:45 2015 UTC,Awwww yis.
pacers,3bw422,daymanxx,3,Thu Jul 2 17:20:44 2015 UTC,Great for us to add more scoring to the backcourt. If we can re-sign Stuckey too we'd have some good firepower off the bench too. I'm excited for next year!
pacers,3bw422,mcs3144,3,Thu Jul 2 17:13:11 2015 UTC,"Damn, watch out for Indy next season.  Regardless of who the Pacers roll out in the frontcourt, Hill, Ellis and George are going to be great compliments to one another on the wing.  Monta is a tremendous PnR ball handler, truly doesn't get enough credit for what he's been doing lately in Dallas.  Those talents are going to allow Paul to be at his best working off ball, getting out on the break early and moving as a screener/shooter.  PG can have some success as a ball handler but his ability to get high percentage shots and be a playmaker for others is limited in comparison to Monta.  With Ellis/George feeding him the ball he'll be more efficient and more dangerous.  Defensively Ellis is another good compliment.  He doesn't play staunch man defense but he is very quick and can get out to force turnovers.  With two great wing defenders flanking him, Hill/George, Monta will be free to play off their matchup's mistakes and capitalize."
pacers,3bw422,inlarrywetrust,2,Thu Jul 2 17:29:16 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling that Ellis is one of those guys whose defense looks terrible in bad defensive systems and great in good ones... he just hasn't really been in a good defensive system. He gets lots of steals and capitalizes on opponent mistakes, he just needs to have people around him who can minimize the damage from when he gambles and misses.  He's always going to be matched up on the worst guard/wing on the other team so it's not like he'll get exploited man-to-man. If you have to ""hide"" somebody defensively this is pretty much the perfect scenario."
pacers,3bw422,aidsfarts,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:40:58 2015 UTC,"Totally agree.  That's why he'll be such a benefit to this squad and will make the more obvious impact adding offensive punch.    Hill, George and Ellis all have different strengths and weaknesses so they can cover up and compliment one anothwr effectively."
pacers,3bw422,Gettingbuckets,2,Thu Jul 2 20:24:25 2015 UTC,I hope he teaches everyone his sick handshake
pacers,3bw422,Pseudonova,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:24:36 2015 UTC,Great signing. Will be interesting to see how our roster ends up filling out from here.

pacers,3bw597,lordb916,5,Thu Jul 2 20:03:48 2015 UTC,Awesome! I went to college in the Bay Area back when Ellis was with the Warriors. Can't wait for him to bring some spark into the Pacers' offense.
pacers,3bw597,Pacers31Colts18,7,Thu Jul 2 23:53:45 2015 UTC,Can I use this for the sidebar?
pacers,3bw597,typs,6,Thu Jul 2 17:19:51 2015 UTC,Sure!
pacers,3bw597,h3isenburg,3,Thu Jul 2 17:22:33 2015 UTC,"Is there any way to get PG in focus, and Hill over his other shoulder?  Sorry if I'm asking too much, this pic is still awesome."
pacers,3bw597,Shepherdsfavestore,8,Thu Jul 2 17:59:45 2015 UTC,Our offense just significantly improved.
pacers,3bw597,Pdanna1030,10,Thu Jul 2 18:00:55 2015 UTC,its gonna be weird scoring over 70 points a game
pacers,3bxo5o,samisamer123,9,Fri Jul 3 00:29:34 2015 UTC,"I think that's a huge plus. You know we're gonna give PG every opportunity - but when defenders make that hard/impossible, Ellis and to a lesser extent, G Hill, are both viable shot takers."
pacers,3bxo5o,IM_A_WAIL,3,Fri Jul 3 00:38:50 2015 UTC,"I think you have PG13, Hill, and Ellis who can reliably take the last shot.  Its sure nice knowing you have some instant offense.  Whats really great is that Ellis is much more of a penetrating guard while Hill is more of a shooter.  They should compliment each other wonderfully.  Along with George, I think we have some really good pieces in place.  Turner, I think, is going to end up being better than people think in a year or two, and I am hoping Lavoy can build on last years success."
pacers,3bxo5o,materhern,3,Fri Jul 3 02:00:50 2015 UTC,CJ Miles as a 4th option clutch shot taker is such a beautiful thing to me
pacers,3bxo5o,herrrr-me-nerrrr,5,Fri Jul 3 05:08:27 2015 UTC,"Ummm...give the ball to PG and get out of the way. Don't care if Monta hit some big shots before, this is PG we're talking about."
pacers,3bxo5o,pfc_bgd,2,Fri Jul 3 04:38:30 2015 UTC,tru but the defense ain't gettin out the way
pacers,3bxo5o,kickit,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:26:33 2015 UTC,"Just another reliable clutch shot option, more of those never hurt anybody :)"

pacers,3bw5xv,materhern,3,Thu Jul 2 17:25:44 2015 UTC,I am so ready for Monta. Who was our last pure scorer?
pacers,3bw5xv,Sheffield178,3,Thu Jul 2 17:29:03 2015 UTC,Great deal! Very similar to the one we gave D West. We may be wondering why we have him in 3 years considering he relies on speed but for 11mill a year this is awesome. I was getting nervous when I saw all those dizzying numbers some guys were signing to.
pacers,3bw5xv,mrpooh31,2,Thu Jul 2 18:04:36 2015 UTC,I feel good about this
pacers,3bw5xv,lordb916,2,Thu Jul 2 17:23:42 2015 UTC,"Shooting inside, outside? Fast break? Transition? $44 million dollars? Monta Elli have it all."
pacers,3bw9zt,UXAndrew,2,Thu Jul 2 17:54:04 2015 UTC,Can Monta be a good veteran presence?
pacers,3bw9zt,Smart_Dumb,2,Thu Jul 2 19:00:48 2015 UTC,"My instinct is to say no but I think that probably isnt a fair assessment. He is quiet with media and fans and behind the scenes who knows...they call him ""moody"". I always liked that about him and sometimes I think the Pacers need more emotion so maybe it is a good fit in that regard."
pacers,3bw9zt,h3isenburg,2,Fri Jul 3 00:21:48 2015 UTC,I've never heard anything bad about Montas attitude. I don't see why not.
pacers,3bw9zt,pacerpower,2,Thu Jul 2 19:05:28 2015 UTC,He didn't want to play with steph Curry and hated the bucks/Jennings.  He opted out of the Mavs(so I assume bad blood) all that being said.... I fucking love this signing
pacers,3bw9zt,busche916,2,Fri Jul 3 02:54:33 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about his attitude off the court, but in regards to some of those points my guess would be that not wanting to play with Curry is due to both needing to be the primary ball handler, and Curry is going to win out in that battle. The mavs towards the end of this season were a bit of a train wreck with the Rondo situation, and that team isn't getting any younger. Ellis knows that he is in his prime and signing with us is an indication that he believes we are a team moving in the right direction.  Then again I could just be way too optimistic"
pacers,3bw9zt,scottw5150,2,Fri Jul 3 14:52:22 2015 UTC,I don't think he will hurt. He won't be a David west though.
pacers,3bwkpd,pburgh36,3,Thu Jul 2 19:12:54 2015 UTC,"What do we want with that money this year though? It will definetly help us re-sign Lavoy, Scola and Stuckey which would be great. Who else is out there right now?   This is really exciting though haha because TBH i thought we werent going to do anything at all."
pacers,3bwkpd,mrpooh31,3,Thu Jul 2 19:28:32 2015 UTC,Tobias Harris
pacers,3bwkpd,DonnieNarco,2,Thu Jul 2 20:48:19 2015 UTC,I was having the same thought. Not sure if he would want to come here or how much he is looking to make. I could see him being a great 4 for small ball.
pacers,3bwkpd,LaysHer,3,Thu Jul 2 22:12:10 2015 UTC,Sign DeAndre Jordan :)
pacers,3bwkpd,tiger32kw,3,Thu Jul 2 21:08:56 2015 UTC,"How hilarious would it be if he told the Mavs a definite no, sign and trade Hibbert, then he signs with us.  I don't think thats even possible with our Cap, but thats still hilarious to think about."
pacers,3bwkpd,materhern,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:02:25 2015 UTC,I was trying to figure out what we were going to do with it too. I assumed we would try and bring Stuckey back but I was looking for a big man to fill Roys shoes that could run better. I know everyone is looking for a PF but I though Robin Lopez would be interesting. I don't really know how expensive he is though.
pacers,3bwkpd,WTF_RANDY,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:38:57 2015 UTC,RoLo would be interesting for sure but I dont think we stand a chance against the Knick's pocket book. That would be a great fit but a little far fetched unfrotunetly.   Bird's eyeing something I guess.
pacers,3bwkpd,mrpooh31,2,Thu Jul 2 19:47:31 2015 UTC,Depends on if anyone actually wants to go to NY.  I have a feeling neither the Lakers nor the Knicks are going to end up with any big time free agents this year.
pacers,3bwkpd,materhern,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:29:40 2015 UTC,"Thomas Robinson, Robin Lopez, Tobias Harris, Teletovic, Biyombo, Amare, KJ McDaniels, Jordan Hill, Jeremy Lin, Koufos, Jimmer, Bargs, Bonner, Psycho T.  I mean the list goes on and on.  LOTS of depth and talent that could be added with that $15.5mil."
pacers,3bwkpd,busche916,2,Fri Jul 3 04:46:21 2015 UTC,If we signed the likes of Jimmer or Lin I would simultaneously laugh and cry
pacers,3bwkpd,Frostler,3,Fri Jul 3 15:01:49 2015 UTC,I'd rather save the Hibbert cap room for next year
pacers,3bwkpd,h3isenburg,2,Fri Jul 3 02:35:57 2015 UTC,"First Monta and now Hibbert? Pinch me, I must be fucking dreaming. Even if this doesn't happen, the fact that it's being considered makes me happy."
pacers,3bwkpd,materhern,2,Thu Jul 2 20:27:24 2015 UTC,"Dude, this would literally be a best case scenario.  We'd have Monta AND hella cap room THIS year, not next."
pacers,3bwkpd,therhymerr,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:28:29 2015 UTC,Mavs fan here. Always have kept an eye on the pacers until yalls dude went down last year. Last time I checked Hibbert was a huge focal point. What happened recently that made him so devalued and also do you think the mavs could turn him around at all?
pacers,3bxrqr,JarradLakers,2,Fri Jul 3 01:03:04 2015 UTC,"Normally the prices are reasonable, but Lakers games have one of the more expensive ticket prices"

pacers,3bvdc6,pfc_bgd,5,Thu Jul 2 15:22:30 2015 UTC,Disrespectful...
pacers,3bvdc6,Lightning_Boi,6,Thu Jul 2 15:36:36 2015 UTC,You shut your mouth about David west
pacers,3bvdc6,h3isenburg,6,Thu Jul 2 16:06:14 2015 UTC,"After hearing his comments yesterday with Kravitz I'm really disappointed in him even more than before.   He doesn't accept his part in all of this but instead just says he wants to chase a ring. So does everyone.  Let's be honest here David, you know you're not going to be able to contribute in a highly positive way, so you'd like to sit on the bench and have a few minutes while you get carried to a ring.   Just sad :-("
pacers,3bvdc6,NateThomas1979,2,Thu Jul 2 16:28:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah Im not sure what he expects with Golden State, if he was on that squad I feel like he would play 60 games and average 12 minutes...Is that what he's after? Kinda perplexing."
pacers,3bvdc6,TonofSoil,5,Thu Jul 2 18:31:12 2015 UTC,"This guy turned our franchise around and made us a winning team again. He gave it all he had IMO. If he doesn't think we're contenders, that's his opinion. Bird called out Hibbert's garbage game so why can't West publicly say that we're not contenders. Let him go after a ring, he's given us all he could and I think we should all be happy about that."
pacers,3bvdc6,h3isenburg,2,Thu Jul 2 19:04:12 2015 UTC,"I don't have a problem with that, I have a problem with West's inability to assess his game as well as the teams.   Last year WAS West's year. PG hurt, who's our #2 offensive threat? It's West with his midrange jumper. But he was down in every category except for assists. Every category.  So I'm completely fine with him chasing a ring. I think he SHOULD if that is the way he felt. I just am suprised that he said """"I'm not going to be one of those guys that's just out here chasing that. I'm not going to be one those guys out here sacrificing who I am, the things that make me me, to go out and get a material goal. That's just not the way I'm wired"" (link )just last year and then this year things suddenly change.    Again I think that West is one of the most intelligent players on our team. It's just disappointing that West would not be introspective enough to see that the team as a whole was bad last year, and that he was a part of that too. I have said multiple times that West would watch as Hibbert would try to slide off his man to help defend a driving opponent and West would simply watch as Hibbert's man gets the easy layup.  It's not on him alone, I just think that West is tired of trying and wants to see if he can just coast to a ring ala Leandro Barbosa style. Play a few minutes, get some needed points for your team in a game, but mainly be a backup for another younger player.  And it's simply disappointing."
pacers,3bvdc6,NateThomas1979,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:22:38 2015 UTC,Could we be considered a contender now with Monta signed? Maybe he will come back...
pacers,3bvdc6,Anicole2196,2,Thu Jul 2 20:46:07 2015 UTC,"Not this year.  I gotta imagine next year for sure though, after hibbert is gone we'll have room for big max FA.  Ellis will have had a year to gel and PG will be approaching his prime.  This season is a 'hype' season for that.  Oh and hopefully Turner will be playing well by that point."

I love Roy and love having him with us, but if you are getting paid huge money and not holding up your end of the deal with how you carry yourself through a rough season, I don't see how you can expect anything different.  Sure we could have used more tact, but this is what you have to expect.  David has to have known this as well."
pacers,3btmrv,yobramine,11,Thu Jul 2 01:56:55 2015 UTC,"Handle it internally?   I love this team, I love the players, and am extremely hopeful moving forward. All that said though, Bird could have easily kept the shit in the locker room and out of the media.   You can have tough love without shitting on your players publicly."
pacers,3btmrv,pirate_doug,2,Thu Jul 2 02:16:29 2015 UTC,"I probably would have done that myself, but I also have no idea how to run a basketball team.  Again, maybe this was taking things too far, but you can't not do your job and then not expect to get some shit for it."
pacers,3btmrv,yobramine,2,Thu Jul 2 02:27:21 2015 UTC,That's not how Bird works. He has and will publicly call out players who aren't carrying their weight. Hibbert is getting paid 15 million because Bird agreed pay him that amount and Hibbert's a big boy(literally) and should be able to take some criticism from Bird. I'm a Hibbert fan in that I think he's a good guy and I don't doubt his work ethic or that he cares about his game. Unfortunately there is some other mental hurdle that has been there the whole time for him. Maybe a fresh start somewhere else either this year or next will help him get over that. I hope so. I'd like to see him enjoy being Roy Hibbert again even if he's not in a Pacers jersey.
pacers,3btmrv,25Tab,4,Thu Jul 2 22:45:02 2015 UTC,"Fuck Roy, and I'm starting to feel the same way about West. He's over the hill and him leaving will be the best thing that happens for the Pacers this summer. Frees up so much money. And fuck /r/NBA. It's like nobody remembers that PG is coming back. And suddenly Hill is shit too apparently."
pacers,3btmrv,XC_Stallion92,7,Thu Jul 2 02:46:16 2015 UTC,Lol don't even try to make sense of r/NBA is saying right now.  Apparently getting our best player back is taking us from 1 game out of the playoffs to an eastern conference bottomfeeder.
pacers,3btmrv,yobramine,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:52:01 2015 UTC,I find the best posts in r/nba are the controversial ones.

pacers,3btmrv,olddoy,8,Thu Jul 2 03:26:08 2015 UTC,I don't get the West hate in here. Bird was unprofessional in his comments and West has every right to want to get a ring. Tbh I am a little salty with the way Bird has gone about shitting on Roy. That is never a good move.   Doesn't matter anyway. We're not contending until we get an owner who gives a shit about winning and will pay the damn tax.

pacers,3btmrv,XC_Stallion92,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:38:27 2015 UTC,Just curious. Who would buy the Pacers that wouldn't be a threat to take them to another city? Not saying I agree with Herb's stance but at least we know where the team is staying.
pacers,3btmrv,hatrick06,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:26:21 2015 UTC,I don't have anyone in mind. And I'm not saying Herb is the worst owner we could have. Maybe he is the best option. But none of that changes the fact that until we pay the luxury tax we will never compete.
pacers,3btmrv,Galt2112,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:33:28 2015 UTC,I agree. It's just something I have found myself thinking about before. We could use a young billionaire that's competitively driven but billionaires are hard to come by in Indiana anyways.

pacers,3btmrv,busche916,2,Fri Jul 3 14:58:29 2015 UTC,"Was there more that Bird said that I'm missing?

""And I can't guarantee him anything. He's going to have to earn it.""  Personally, I think West's decision is more about HIS reduced role with PG taking over at the 4 spot."
pacers,3btmrv,indyclone,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:19:05 2015 UTC,"Gross. Basically, ""I'm ring chasing and people aren't behaving how I think they should.""  Enjoy whatever contender you go to.

pacers,3btmrv,Derek2k3,8,Thu Jul 2 01:40:11 2015 UTC,"I've loved West since he came here, with that said, I was disappointed by both him and Hibbert last year. Both had shitty years, when I expected them to carry us. I expected more from West. Really the guy I expected the least from was Hill, and he was the only guy from the core to seem to give a shit most nights. Maybe if the both of them didn't mope up the court most nights, we wouldn't be in this position."
pacers,3btmrv,TonofSoil,3,Thu Jul 2 01:44:17 2015 UTC,"Totally true, Hill was definitely the only one who seemed to give a shit.

pacers,3bu8rn,MagiClipPaceRaps,4,Thu Jul 2 04:58:47 2015 UTC,Gallinari/Hickson would be great if we could land it.

pacers,3bu8rn,herrrr-me-nerrrr,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:25:35 2015 UTC,"I'll assume Gallinari can shoot at a better clip than Rudez did last year. If we utilize him in the same way (spot-up, catch-and-shooter), we're bound to have our 3P% increase."
pacers,3bu8rn,exWarlock,2,Thu Jul 2 13:57:30 2015 UTC,"Of these, I would most prefer Eric Gordon, or Gallinari/Hickson. Nene also intrigues me, but I feel like he'd be getting a slightly more athletic West, and a defensive downgrade from Hibbert. Also, he moves faster."
pacers,3bu8rn,exWarlock,4,Thu Jul 2 05:04:36 2015 UTC,"Lots of fans here, and at PacersDigest, have been enamored with Gordon since he played for IU. I don't have a problem with EJ, but he would be redundant with Monta. I'd say we'll only need one or the other. Hickson and Gallinari do sound the most promising, as long as Gallo isn't getting starter minutes."
pacers,3bu8rn,herrrr-me-nerrrr,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:59:49 2015 UTC,"EJ and Monta do totally different things, I don't think they're redundant at all. Plus if we're going to be small and fast, adding them to Hill, Miles, and PG gives us great versatility"
pacers,3bu8rn,makeyoucry,2,Thu Jul 2 15:27:30 2015 UTC,"I love the Bayless/Pachulia trade. We hypothetically don't have to give up any picks and they both only have 1-year left on their deals.   Gallinari/Hickson is nice too, but I would hate to give up a 1st rounder (even though protected) when we probably won't be a true contender this season."
pacers,3bu8rn,Pacers31Colts18,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:27:31 2015 UTC,"I've never been one to want Gordon, but I think that's the best trade of these 5."

pacers,3bru68,burneezy,5,Wed Jul 1 17:43:33 2015 UTC,He doesn't have to shoot fast to be effective stretching the floor. Being able to hit the 3 is good enough. Antic Doesn't have a quick release and he was capable of causing a lot of spacing issues.
pacers,3bru68,WTF_RANDY,-7,Wed Jul 1 18:32:25 2015 UTC,"Bah, I don't really want my centers shooting 3 pointers. I'd make him do push ups every time he shoots a three pointer."

pacers,3bru68,THE_BIG_SITT,5,Wed Jul 1 17:52:46 2015 UTC,I love stretch bigs. I think it really helps to have one more guy to be a threat outside

pacers,3bru68,ISUCKATKARMA,2,Wed Jul 1 18:22:23 2015 UTC,So you wouldn't like having a center that when he gets the ball out there is a real threat to drop a 3 on you so you have to bring your big away from the basket to guard him?
pacers,3bru68,materhern,-1,Wed Jul 1 19:54:30 2015 UTC,"No not really. I guess I don't mind the PF being out there, but I'd rather have the center inside or on the elbow/wing."
pacers,3bru68,Pacers31Colts18,2,Wed Jul 1 19:55:43 2015 UTC,"Not me.  Every threat to shoot outside opens the lane up.  Imagine a dish and go with Ellis and Turner.  Turner pops out and if they don't jump out to guard him, he drops a three.  If they do, Ellis heads down the lane after the pass and takes it right back from Turner in for the easy layup.   Those plays are not possible with someone like Roy because there is zero threat of him scoring, so they don't have to honor him jumping to the outside."
pacers,3bru68,materhern,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:00:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with you to an extent, and we aren't planning to sit him in the corner and just play spot up ball or anything. But his range does allow possibilities for spacing and providing lanes for PG/G.Hill/Ellis(hopefully)."

pacers,3bqpl6,burneezy,2,Wed Jul 1 14:17:21 2015 UTC,Anyway they could work this deal so that we can pay him less this season so we have more to play with this off season? He would still get the 32 mil just a little less this year especially with hibbert not having that big ass contract and us having more money next off season.
pacers,3bqpl6,rotinaj31,2,Wed Jul 1 15:51:21 2015 UTC,"How does Ellis fit?  I'd imagined bringing in a Point Guard, moving Hill over to Shooting guard, starting Miles at Small Forward, Paul George at Power Forward and either Hibbert or Turner at the Center.  Now, if they get Ellis, he's the Shooting Guard... Does Hill stay at point guard and they both play together?  I guess if the tempo is greatly increased a true point guard doesn't matter as much.  He's not what I imagined, but if he's signed I look forward to seeing him in the lineup."
pacers,3bqpl6,indyclone,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:13:16 2015 UTC,"Ellis is much more of a shooting guard, but he commands the ball so much on offense that, if he passes to the rest of our scorers, he could be considered a ball-dominant guard. Would relieve some of the pressure off Hill's shoulders."
pacers,3bqpl6,MagiClipPaceRaps,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:51:35 2015 UTC,"""If he passes"" kind of scares me... Is he a ball hog and not a team player?"
pacers,3bqpl6,indyclone,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:58:30 2015 UTC,"He shoots a lot, but is bad at 3's and is not good on defense. People say he fits well on the Pacers because he fits so poorly on other teams and we need scoring have a good defense. He is an exciting player with an almost cult following. He even has his own catch phrase. This will make games more fun to watch and make us a decent seed in the East, but not contender status."
pacers,3bqpl6,onelapcatperchild,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:17:36 2015 UTC,"This is huge, I really want this deal to work out. We would be getting him for a bit cheaper than I thought it would take. A little over 10 a year is a steal. I thought it would take 13+ to get him here. It may be a tough salary hit this year but that contract is going to seem like chump change come next year when the salary cap is increased."

pacers,3bq040,duptygupty,4,Wed Jul 1 07:49:15 2015 UTC,"My guess is they will bring back Lavoy Allen and Whittington at the minimum for depth.

pacers,3bq040,danimalplanimal,3,Wed Jul 1 06:25:19 2015 UTC,I think he will be great around Hill. Will be so nice to have 2 ball handlers.   Do you think he will be a 6th man who runa thw offense for the 2nd unit and finishes games? Or does cj become 6th man now?
pacers,3bq040,Sheffield178,2,Wed Jul 1 11:33:35 2015 UTC,LOVE THIS!
pacers,3bq040,pacerpower,3,Wed Jul 1 06:34:09 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly not seeing what everyone is getting excited about, this dude isn't a winner (only made playoffs 3 times in his career) and doesn't seem to do the little things that help teams win games. He shot like 28% from 3 last year and this team desperately needs shooters. He has less than a 2-1 assist/turnover ratio while being used as a possible PG for us. He's not known for his defense and just doesn't seem like a great fit. I realize we are limited on who we can get but this is a contract that will keep someone else solid away once Roy frees up."
pacers,3bq040,Victory33,2,Wed Jul 1 12:03:19 2015 UTC,"Saying he isn't a winner because he hasn't made it to the playoffs is silly.  Playoffs are a team sport.  He's not expected to come in and take us to the playoffs.  By that measure, George Hill didn't take us to the playoffs last year, so he isn't a winner.    Fact is Ellis averages more per game than any of our guards have in years.  His field goal percent is close to Hills and better than Miles.  He can create off the dribble very effectively and in post season play, his numbers have gone UP.  Not down.  Hill is a more efficient shooter, and Ellis is a more dynamic guard.  They would make a great team together.  And where he fits is that he is a legitimate threat to score and get to the rim, which speeds up our offense and gives us a real threat to score with someone besides PG13.    He's not known for his defense, but we aren't getting him for his defense.  We would be getting him because if he plays average for him, it doubles the amount of offensive potential we have in the front court."
pacers,3bq040,materhern,0,Wed Jul 1 12:32:45 2015 UTC,"Saying he isn't a winner because he hasn't made it to the playoffs is silly. Playoffs are a team sport.   I disagree, the best players continually make their team better and get to the playoffs. There is a reason I don't think guys like Carmelo or Love are great players, they don't play defense and they don't make their team's better. One year isn't a good indicator but over a career a great player should win more than they lose. Jason Kidd damn near always made the playoffs, Reggie always made the playoffs, Lebron always makes the playoffs...etc. I know Ellis isn't in their categories and we aren't paying him as such but I've just never considered him to be a guy that is making a team better and I don't see him working out great here. Speeding up our offense is what O'Brien did and we were garbage at it, we found success slowing it down and uglying up the game like Memphis does."
pacers,3bq040,Victory33,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:58:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get that. But Monta Ellis isn't being brought in to be Lebron.  He's coming in to be a piece to a team that already is a playoff team.  If you are comparing him to Kidd, Reggie, and Lebron, you are doing it wrong.  He's not that guy.  He's not the key that is going to come in an instantly make your team a playoff team.  But neither are Hibbert, Hill, or West."
pacers,3bq040,materhern,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:05:42 2015 UTC,"He's actually made it 4 times, and if it wasn't for the fact that the West was insanely loaded in his 3rd year(the Nuggets were 50-32 and were the freaking 8th seed) he would have made it 5 times. Let's not forget that when he was drafted by the Warriors they were constant bottom feeders at the time. Also, yeah his 3pt FG% was bad last year, but he was 9th best in FG% among shooting guards. We need another scorer to compliment PG13 and that's exactly what Ellis brings to the table."
pacers,3bq040,captain-dingleberry,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:28:00 2015 UTC,"I thought Hill was our compliment based on how well he played last year, what we really need is a point guard who can pass the ball and handle it as well. Hill could be our SG/PG if we could just find a solid PG that can generate assists."
pacers,3bq040,Victory33,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:02:18 2015 UTC,Do you consider Kyrie to be a PG can generate assist?     Because George Hill had a comparable season to him last year.
pacers,3bq040,trilliam_clinton,2,Wed Jul 1 13:05:10 2015 UTC,"Nah, hes a score first PG. Hill has played more like a SG since we signed him, poor assist numbers and better as a scorer than a distributor. He also doesn't really generate a lot of offense or create plays with his passing...I can't remember a alley-oop this team has had in a long time. Chris Paul, Ty Lawson, Rondo, Wall are assist guys. They are becoming less prominent in the NBA when only 4 guys have over 8 APG last year."
pacers,3bq040,Victory33,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:10:32 2015 UTC,George hill consistently has a top 10 assist to turnover ratio. It's not his fault he has low assist numbers. We don't run an offense that generates enough opportunities for him
pacers,3bq040,scottw5150,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:57:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think that is entirely true, Stephenson was able to generate assists for us last year due to his ability to penetrate and kick out and such. I agree our offense takes some of the blame, but 5 assists/game shouldn't be a career high for any starting point guard should it? He's only had six 10+ assist games as a Pacer. Now, these numbers could go up if we had any shooters or centers that could shoot under the rim."
pacers,3bq040,Victory33,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:07:43 2015 UTC,"Some of it is Hill, but we still don't run a shooter friendly offense. Lance did have high assist numbers, but when he played with the offense he had 3 other spot up shooters (west, hill, George). Lance was a poor spot up shooter which hurt when When Lance played with the backups, he had Scola to hit on pick and rolls. Not that those are great reasons, but it didn't help. I think if we have good spot up shooting and a PnR guy this year we will see Hill get 7 assists per game or close to it"
pacers,3bq040,scottw5150,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:25:20 2015 UTC,"Ellis is basically George Hill with a worse shot, better driving ability, and at a higher volume.  They would work nicely together, can both be interchangable at either guard position."

pacers,3bqyfq,Dude4445,2,Wed Jul 1 16:26:30 2015 UTC,Why would we be interested in Brandon Wright? This pick up would make zero sense unless they were looking to convert him to a power forward.
pacers,3bqyfq,materhern,2,Wed Jul 1 13:18:11 2015 UTC,"That would likely be the position they'd play him in, which would be unwise to me considering that we're looking for a solid starter. Brandan has shown flashes of being an offensive stud, but he doesn't have the defensive capacity to be a consistent rebounder."
pacers,3bqyfq,tuzlyfe,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:05:37 2015 UTC,That was my thought.  Unless they plan on swapping him in and out with PG at the 4 when they need a boost in offense.  Not sure how well that would work but just trying to figure out what they are thinking.
pacers,3bqyfq,materhern,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:27:03 2015 UTC,"his rebounding does leave much to be desired, but he really would fit the faster offensive style they want to play next year, similar to the Mavs last year (with Monta) before he got traded to the celtics. Agree he is only a backup, but PG is going to be filling the 4 spot for the most part, and even though Wright is listed as a C he is a little undersized and could fill the 4 nicely, imo."
pacers,3bqyfq,burneezy,2,Wed Jul 1 15:05:53 2015 UTC,"He's a versitile big, who cares if the mavs/celts/suns listed him as a C? He'd fit well at the 4 for us and can shift to the 5 in small ball lineups. Great fit in my mind"
pacers,3bqyfq,herrrr-me-nerrrr,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:26:58 2015 UTC,"Okay, I don't know much about him.  If he can play the 4 spot reasonably well and add to the offense then I'm all for it."

pacers,3bpcr2,TonofSoil,3,Wed Jul 1 17:31:01 2015 UTC,"Couple notes/thoughts here:  We NEED Scola back, especially if West is gone. It's a must with his production and older age as far as leadership. I think a key 6th man needs to be signed bad, or another SG that would move Miles to 6th man--Solo might be a good option for 6th man after what i saw from him last year too. I wouldn't mind seeing what Joey Buckets can do at back up PG, but having a safety net would be nice. Roy should have his minutes reduced to minutes we need his defensive presence or role in the offense, similar to what Mozgov did in the finals. I like having Ian in there nearly any other time."
pacers,3bpcr2,Anicole2196,3,Wed Jul 1 05:00:58 2015 UTC,"I think Mahinmi got more minutes last year than Hibbert, Roy just started, no way he only gets garbage minutes, I think Turner is supposed to be more of a Power Forward."
pacers,3bpcr2,iAMtHESushighost,2,Wed Jul 1 02:03:36 2015 UTC,"Ahh, ok. I thought they drafted Myles as a C rather than PF. I guess he will probably play PF until minutes open up at center though? I'll go ahead and slot him in there.  Hibbert played 1926 min (25.3/game) while Mahinmi played 1146 min (18.8/game) according to basketball-reference. Hibbert will still play quite a bit. He is good, but he is just not worth $15 mil.  Edit: I also think Mahinmi is a good backup C. I just figured the Pacers would slot Turner ahead of him, because he will be a bigger part of their future. That's another reason why I think Mahinmi is a good trade piece. He's about our only asset besides draft picks. Otherwise, I see him leaving once his contract is up."
pacers,3bpcr2,iAMtHESushighost,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:00:57 2015 UTC,"Did you factor in the games he was injured? I thought they showed something saying Mahinmi was playing more (maybe it was just for a certain stretch of games?)

If it weren't for character issues, I'd say Rondo but his attitude isn't something I want on the Pacers."
pacers,3bne0h,mrpooh31,6,Tue Jun 30 23:09:20 2015 UTC,I think we really need to resign Lavoy Allen with West leaving. Stuckey I would love to have back as well but I think he played well enough to get some attention from a team that will pay him more or be competing for a title. At the very least we need Lavoy and then after that I wouldnt mind staying put and signing some cheap talent.  With Hibbert expiring+cap jump next year I think we will be able to make some more moves next offseason.
pacers,3bne0h,scottw5150,4,Tue Jun 30 23:04:38 2015 UTC,"So from what I gathered, we have 14 million without cap holds. That doesn't include our rookies which will be about 3 million. So we have 9 players under contract with 11 mill to spend. yikes."
pacers,3bne0h,MagiClipPaceRaps,4,Tue Jun 30 17:03:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we aren't in a very good position. We need to create some cap space, or we are going to be sitting with a bench full of Marcus Haislip's and Britton Johnson's."
pacers,3bne0h,youngjabberwocker,3,Tue Jun 30 17:08:30 2015 UTC,"Or more accurately, a bunch of Christian Watford's, Jon Octeus's, and Shayne Whittington's."
pacers,3bne0h,orrrderup,2,Tue Jun 30 21:40:17 2015 UTC,Just need Watford for the three-pointers against Kentucky
pacers,3bne0h,orrrderup,2,Tue Jun 30 23:07:52 2015 UTC,"I might have messed up somewhere, but my understanding is that the 15/16 cap is around $67 mil. If West is in fact gone, the Pacers will have eight players under contract for about $51.3. Add the rookies and you've got 10 players on the roster, with a little under $13 million to play with. Not a huge difference I guess, but at least it's a LITTLE more flexibility, especially with all of the space they have opening up next summer."
pacers,3bne0h,yobramine,4,Tue Jun 30 17:45:55 2015 UTC,"http://8points9seconds.com/2015/06/24/west-declines-option-the-cap-ramifications/  This breaks it down pretty good.  By jumping through all those hoops and performing all of those gyrations, the best case scenario – payroll wise – is for the Pacers to be about $10.0 million below the cap. Had both West and Hibbert picked up their options, the Pacers would have been above the cap, but still had their Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Exception ($5.5 million) and their Bi-Annual Exception ($2.1 million). Those two exceptions are lost, once you drop below the cap, and potentially replaced with the $2.8 million Room Exception."

pacers,3bne0h,burneezy,2,Thu Jul 2 18:36:08 2015 UTC,IMO this is still a transition year and we should just power through it without a big FA signing and use the money next year. Hopefully by then we'll have a better idea of what Myles Turner is and the Roy Hibbert situation will be resolved. Plus I don't like any FAs this year anyways.
pacers,3bne0h,XC_Stallion92,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:50:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was looking at a list of other team's FA's and it was a who's who of players I don't want on our team.  We need to bring back at least two of our own FAs.  The reality is that we're going to have to sign a guard, and he's probably not going to be an exciting signing because Simon's not going over the cap."

I know it must be frustrating to be coming to the end of your career, but he's not be the most emotionally-stoic individual out there either.   In fact, I would describe his attitude the past 2 years as 'brooding'.   I'm not saying it's all his fault, because it isn't, but to say that we suddenly are out a 'grown up' is to ignore how many complaints he's had in the past couple years, jawing at the refs after every foul and getting upset with other players unnecessarily.  In fact, I think that maturity as a whole is part of the major struggles that we have had as a team."
pacers,3bnuo2,NateThomas1979,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:21:31 2015 UTC,Only complaint I had about his attitude was he complained about every single call. I'm all for complaining about a few but if you complain about everything you give the vibe that the game isn't in your hands
pacers,3bnuo2,Shepherdsfavestore,2,Wed Jul 1 02:43:08 2015 UTC,"To me it was happening a lot more frequently the past couple of years. West has always been a guy who complains about every call, I don't mind it because it affects the refs I think. But lately it's taken him much more out of his game.   I still would love to see him in a Pacer uniform. His heart and work ethic are great. Even if he doesn't play as many minutes least he can get some mid range jumpers for us."

pacers,3bn2ja,bingbonggonghongkong,3,Tue Jun 30 15:23:48 2015 UTC,"No. Not at all. We have plenty of wings right now. He doesn't offer much more (and probably less) than what Miles offers. Turner has a much higher upside than Booker and a chance to be a game changer on either end of the court. Booker probably has a higher floor than Turner. But after going after safe players before in the draft, I am really glad we took a guy who has a chance to be special."
pacers,3bn2ja,scottw5150,3,Tue Jun 30 16:30:04 2015 UTC,I wanted Booker as well. He can shoot and seems to make the right plays. It will be interesting to see what he can do when he earns a bigger role in the league.

But there aren't any free agents I wanna spend $27 million on. Next year there will be a ton of free agents. I'd rather have that cap space to spend next year in free agency.
pacers,3bkrdf,PaulGeorgeDaRealMVP,2,Tue Jun 30 01:38:19 2015 UTC,"The argument for Roy not opting in is that lots of teams are going to have lots of cap room next season, and if we'd had 27m to work with we could've gotten a bit of a head start. Not that there are any major FAs at the 4-5 that we would've really targeted."

I think it's important we ship him out soon, but being so public and attacking him for the sake of him opting out is pissing on him while saying you're not. (y'all know who I'm talking about)  And if you thought Hibbert was going to opt out, well.  I have no fucking idea why you choose to watch basketball then.  It was so obvious that Hibbert was going to opt in.  I think it's much more important for this sub to take Bird's comments less seriously.  Bird is not going to come out with the full plans for the future at a drop of a penny or your opinions.  We're lucky enough to have transparency and to be able to gain a small look into the franchise.  Bird may be a legend and blunt, but he's no Jesus and quit treating words like it's the Bible.

pacers,3bif49,Shepherdsfavestore,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:36:10 2015 UTC,I thought we should be able to now that west is gone?
pacers,3bif49,pfc_bgd,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:05:53 2015 UTC,"If we choose not to replace West with a decent PF, we probably have a shot at it... but for some reason I assumed we'll need somebody to replace West. I cannot see us relying heavily on Scola and getting away with it."
pacers,3bif49,DonnieNarco,0,Mon Jun 29 20:10:46 2015 UTC,It's not a given with teams like Milwaukee and Boston getting even better and Miami presumably being healthier and better adjusted to life without LeBron.
pacers,3bif49,h3isenburg,2,Mon Jun 29 16:50:20 2015 UTC,We will be the 4th best team in the east. Pg-13 equals playoffs whether we rebuild or try to go all in.
pacers,3bif49,NOTtrentRICHARDSON,4,Mon Jun 29 18:23:06 2015 UTC,Honestly... I would love it if we could find a way to move on from Hibbert and Scola. We may suffer for another year but in the long run I think we would faster develop our young talent. Free up cap space and hopefully draw in a nice FA looking for more minutes.
pacers,3bif49,Hank_Scorpio74,2,Mon Jun 29 16:27:55 2015 UTC,"Scola seems to be necessary at this point. Losing D West leaves him and lavoy allen at the 4. Allen is solid...a tough player who knows how to bang inside...but he's still relatively young and apparently still developing which more or less leaves him as a backup making Scola necessary unless we find a replacement which is hard in a small market like indy. Moving on from Hibbert on the other hand....if he stays he has more incentive than most players this year to really play well for a new contract.  He also fits horribly into the system they want to implement offensively this year. That could either be really good, or really bad. All depends on him tbh."
pacers,3bif49,Hank_Scorpio74,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:42:21 2015 UTC,"Scola is getting up there (relatively) but put up serviceable numbers in his one year in Phoenix.  I agree, you have a 4 who can play an up tempo style, you want to keep him."
pacers,3bif49,Hank_Scorpio74,3,Mon Jun 29 17:04:23 2015 UTC,"especially after losing west. He may be one of the few viable options out there, even though that sounds kind of scary.  Also, i keep forgetting that PG will be playing a lot of 4 next year as well so maybe they just let lavoy backup the 4 while paul starts. who knows. should be interesting."
pacers,3bif49,materhern,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:08:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed, you don't need Scola or Lavoy to start at the 4 (in theory) but you're going to need minutes.  And looking at the power forward free agent list you don't see a lot of names we'll be in play for."
pacers,3bif49,Drak_is_Right,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:16:33 2015 UTC,i saw someone mention brandan wright (who would be perfect) but idk if he is a free agent or on the last year of his deal. could be a nice trade target if not a free agent
pacers,3bif49,Drak_is_Right,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:23:18 2015 UTC,I think Grantland mentioned him in their article on the Pacers on Friday.  Hoopshype doesn't have him listed as a free agent.  It looks like the last time he signed a contract was 2013.  So I'm not sure what his status is.
pacers,3bif49,materhern,2,Mon Jun 29 17:27:13 2015 UTC,word up. he moves well and dunks everything. basically the complete opposite of hibbert. was integral in the mavs incredible offensive start the first half of last season
pacers,3bif49,ISUCKATKARMA,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:04:59 2015 UTC,Don't forget PG13 will be spending some time at the 4 this year supposedly too.
pacers,3bif49,materhern,2,Mon Jun 29 18:58:37 2015 UTC,"right right. i mentioned that in a previous comment, but yes that should alleviate many of the PF problems we will have this year (and allow them to play MUCH faster/smaller, which is the goal). if free agency doesn't pan out the way they want. even with him at the 4 we still need another bigger guy for just in case games. (memphis, chicago, etc. big defensive teams basically.)"
pacers,3bif49,materhern,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:07:55 2015 UTC,"finding a replacement starter isn't hard as long as you dont want a top tier all-star.  The rest go where the money and wins is at.  Doubt there is more then a dozen players in the league who feel ""too big"" to go to a small market.  The rest will follow the contracts and good teams, no matter how much talk they make."
pacers,3bif49,materhern,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:43:52 2015 UTC,"Even the solid but not great players historically don't come to indy. Remember how big of a deal it was when Dwest spurred the celtics to join the pacers? people thought he was nuts, and that was dwest a year removed from acl surgery.  I see what your saying overall though."
pacers,3bif49,Shepherdsfavestore,2,Mon Jun 29 20:19:50 2015 UTC,"Unless there is a starting caliber PF/C we can trade Hibbert for (and who is on a reasonable deal), I'd prefer to keep him.  Already will it be hard to get a PF replacement for West.  getting two front line starters = dead season"
pacers,3bi5cx,Pacers31Colts18,4,Mon Jun 29 12:30:44 2015 UTC,Too soon for me. :-(
pacers,3bi5cx,h3isenburg,2,Mon Jun 29 14:01:03 2015 UTC,Hope he gets ta a ring aomewhere... But please dont go to the knicks. Wonder if the Thunder could use him/afford him?
pacers,3bi5cx,Sheffield178,2,Mon Jun 29 13:42:19 2015 UTC,"Doubt the Thunder would go after him, they already have Ibaka who is far better than West currently is. Although, he could fill in as a cheaper backup role for Vet leadership. I don't know, it would just hurt to see him go anywhere now..."
pacers,3bi5cx,churrobro,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:02:16 2015 UTC,"I hope he gets a ring somewhere too, as long as he doesn't go play with Cleveland."
pacers,3bi5cx,T-Thugs,2,Mon Jun 29 19:11:56 2015 UTC,"I will fondly remember his time here.  He played poorly last year, but he still contributed big time to 3 good playoff teams.  It was time for both parties to move on."
pacers,3bi5cx,DonnieNarco,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:01:57 2015 UTC,"ILY David, please re-sign."
pacers,3bgsft,pickle_man_4,6,Mon Jun 29 02:22:45 2015 UTC,Expectation for Joe Young just increased.

pacers,3bi0if,Victory33,3,Mon Jun 29 11:35:41 2015 UTC,Bird said this in the press conference aftwr the draft.
pacers,3bi0if,Sheffield178,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:01:03 2015 UTC,So is it still accurate or has the he officially opted out?
pacers,3bi0if,ISUCKATKARMA,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:02:33 2015 UTC,It's official when he signs a new contract with a new team.
pacers,3bi0if,ISUCKATKARMA,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:27:39 2015 UTC,"My question is are we still on the hook for his contract, if he can't find another team?"
pacers,3bi0if,ghostin_,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:07:36 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I thought I responded to this but guess not....  Anyway it just seems out of character for West to opt out only to sign with NY.  I think there is a small chance he will return on a smaller contract for next year.  He's done this before to help keep PG13 in Indiana when Bird was negotiating the contract terms with PG13."
pacers,3bfx6k,schnebly5,10,Sun Jun 28 21:40:55 2015 UTC,"After the Pacers throw a party because Roy is gone, they will start Myles Turner."
pacers,3bfx6k,MC_Reagan,3,Sun Jun 28 22:18:29 2015 UTC,Turner and mahimni would trade off at the 5. We could also just not have a true 5 in at some times like most teams in the NBA.
pacers,3bfx6k,aidsfarts,5,Mon Jun 29 01:06:31 2015 UTC,Mahinmi will start.  Turner is not ready yet.
pacers,3bfx6k,DonnieNarco,2,Mon Jun 29 01:50:10 2015 UTC,I want to keep Roy for this exact reason. People are too busy trashing Roy to notice we don't have another viable option.
pacers,3bfx6k,bdorocke,3,Mon Jun 29 02:15:38 2015 UTC,air is a better option. 4v5 is even better.
pacers,3bfx6k,h3isenburg,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:30:04 2015 UTC,"Do you even watch games? I swear all you do is trash players. Hibbert has averaged has averaged 11 pts 8 boards and is consistently a top 3 defensive center and last year he was also fixing his fouling issue. Yes, I understand he is overpaid but he has been a crucial player since he got here and was especially the last three years. I like how people are still stuck in the past with the 0/0 game to realize that he had a 30/10 game the next one out.  Also didn't you say you would only want Stuckey back if it was minimum because he is a ""Shot chuker"" with no other attributes."
pacers,3bfx6k,bdorocke,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:54:45 2015 UTC,"I agree w/ everything I said. Wait what? yes. Also, I like to say that pg-13 is good. D West was awesome; howver, he will be gone and def. missed!!. I like Ian as our back up. I like Solomon HIll and wish he would get more minutes. I like CJ Miles. The rest of our squad is pure garbage IMO. Including shot chucker Stucky that is only good for making baskets every 6 games. Scola is all hustle but takes these ill advised jump shots that just are not part of his game. Hibbert? Let's not talk about Hibbert. You must be 2 years behind. George Hill is the most overrated player we have on our squad. This one is the one where most Pacers fans give me shit. It's okay, maybe I'm wrong. Hopefully I'm wrong. Time will tell. cj watson is injury prone. Donald Sloan is a 3rd string point guard. Scola is getting old and shows up 1 out of 5 games. Copeland is good for 3s but can he do anything else? pass? rebound? defend? be a mentor? HAH. no. He's probably in NYC clubbing. Rudez is a carbon copy of Copeland except he sucks even more at passing and defending. I do like his attitude though. I don't think you want to hear my opinion on Shayne Whittington. And yes, I do watch games. p.s. Out of the 7 years Hibbert gave us, he played one good series vs. the Heat. The rest of his career has been below average."
pacers,3bfx6k,h3isenburg,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:56:13 2015 UTC,"I've watched him since we drafted him.  He's gotten progressively worse on the consistency end.  Last year, when he had the chance to shine, he was middle of the pack or lower in rebounds and blocks.  He was anything but consistent.  He started his career slow.  Then started getting better and peaked about 3/4 seasons ago.  Since then he's progressively become more and more of a liability.  Can't catch, can't pass, can't spread the floor, can't run the floor, and is not a premier rebounder or shot blocker any more.  He's just not very good no matter which angle you look at it from.  At one point last year they put a stat on the board that showed the Pacers were a much better team offensively with him not on the floor, and only slightly worse defensively.  Its time to move on from Roy."
pacers,3bfx6k,materhern,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:37:47 2015 UTC,"We're not going to be good with or without Roy next year, and getting rid of Roy could mean signing someone like Thad Young or Paul Millsap."
pacers,3bfx6k,DonnieNarco,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:29:19 2015 UTC,"will be better with roy, more probable to be in playoffs. without, then hello rebuild."
pacers,3bfx6k,burneezy,3,Mon Jun 29 04:10:19 2015 UTC,We should rebuild. What's barely being in the playoffs going to do for us?
pacers,3bfx6k,DonnieNarco,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:18:29 2015 UTC,"We are rebuilding. We don't want Roy, West is gone. Obviously if George Hill is our 2nd best player then we are rebuilding."
pacers,3bfx6k,h3isenburg,-1,Mon Jun 29 11:29:33 2015 UTC,We have a shot to be in the playoffs again with Roy I feel like.
pacers,3bfx6k,bdorocke,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:33:23 2015 UTC,"I think Miles would start of Solo, and if we land Monta (mutual interest from him and Pacers), then he'll start over Stuckey."
pacers,3bfx6k,Indiana_Pacers,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:47:52 2015 UTC,"Definitely not Ian. I feel like some people are thinking Ian is an OK replacement for Roy. Ian Mahinmi is not a good basketball player. Remember that. He is big and a pretty good athlete. BUT HE IS NOT A GOOD BASKETBALL PLAYER, AT ALL."
pacers,3bfx6k,TonofSoil,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:38:26 2015 UTC,"Hopefully Myles Turner would get his minutes, also hopefully we can get a decent player in return for him that will juice our starting 5 a little."
pacers,3bfx6k,Frostler,4,Sun Jun 28 22:26:03 2015 UTC,"There's no way he'd be ready for that, he didn't even do well at Texas. Watch the video of his workouts all you want, but we have to accept that the guy is still a project.  Ian or scola would definitely take his minutes if Paul is going to be playing the 4."
pacers,3bfx6k,dirtydan1114,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:07:20 2015 UTC,"well the other choices being a guy who plays no defense and a career backup I feel like he's easily the best option we have. I don't think Larry would put us into that position though, I'd rather keep Roy than have to start fucking Scola at center. PG was a project and he only got better once he was given responsibility"
pacers,3bfx6k,Frostler,2,Mon Jun 29 01:36:34 2015 UTC,"Right now Ian is 10x the option that Turner is. Turner only started 7 games for Texas this past year. I'd take an NBA backup over a college backup all day. Not to mention that Paul didn't fit the term ""project"" whatsoever.   Yes, it took him a couple of years to become a great NBA player, but he averaged 17 and 7 as a starter his sophomore year at Fresno St and has always been a freak of an athlete with a big frame to go with it. One of the knocks on Turner is that he can't even run correctly. He's pretty much what Roy was coming out of college.   source on Turner stats: http://stats.washingtonpost.com/cbk/players.asp?id=126216  source on Paul stats: http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/paul-george-1.html"
pacers,3bfx6k,dirtydan1114,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:41:39 2015 UTC,"The one thing that people said about Paul is that in 5 years or whatever he could be the best player of his draft class which basically means he's a project. Turner is the same thing, Paul had better stats but they both had ridiculous physical tools that just need developing. You can't get better sitting on the bench, I'd rather have Turner get minutes now then waste a year with mahinmi as a starter."
pacers,3bfx6k,Frostler,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:46:46 2015 UTC,"I see us rolling with Roy and Ian in the meantime, I predict Turner spends a good portion of this season in the D-League as Solo Hill did before him"
pacers,3bfx6k,dirtydan1114,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:50:28 2015 UTC,"Unless we can get something good for him I'd rather us keep Roy also, he's still a good player and a key to how our defense works and imo we don't need a center to run the floor on fast breaks if PG is at the 4 and doing it. I think Turner will get most of his time at backup PF if West really leaves this season."
pacers,3bfx6k,Frostler,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:03:24 2015 UTC,"If our first round draft pick at number 11 spends the year in D league, then it was a bad pick.  Its one thing to have someone in D league from the bottom third of the draft.  Its another thing entirely when the 11th pick is a D league prospect.  If they drafted him expecting that, then someone needs to be fired."
pacers,3bfx6k,materhern,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:40:24 2015 UTC,"After the trade deadline, I would guess it'll be Hill, Monta, PG, Whoever we trade for Hibbert, and Mahinmi. I'm just hoping that somehow this whole Hibbert thing works out and we realize that we shouldn't get rid of him."
pacers,3bfx6k,zzellers,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:01:37 2015 UTC,You must really enjoy 0 point 0 rebound games. What would the Pacers do without Hibbert????
pacers,3bfx6k,h3isenburg,2,Mon Jun 29 11:30:55 2015 UTC,Win.
pacers,3bfx6k,exWarlock,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:42:28 2015 UTC,"That only happened during that huge slump. Besides, he is busy putting his hands up guarding the people driving in the lane so his teammates can get the boards. We have always been an elite rebounding team. Who cares if our center doesn't get them. He should be a perennial pick to consider for DPOY"
pacers,3bfx6k,zzellers,2,Tue Jun 30 06:25:29 2015 UTC,"As much as I hate Hibberts game, I give him that (his D). He's a top 10 defender at his position; however, his speed, passing & offensive game needs  a lot of work and quite frankly, I think it's too late for that."
pacers,3bewam,btirumala,8,Sun Jun 28 16:26:16 2015 UTC,We won't pick up any big name. We never go into luxury tax and we're currently paying big to Roy and PG. We'll get no one. Our front office will never go after another big name if it puts us anywhere near salary cap unfortunately.
pacers,3bewam,skaige,3,Mon Jun 29 01:04:19 2015 UTC,West leaving free's up a shit ton of money.  We won't need to go into luxery tax to get someone like Monta Ellis.
pacers,3bewam,materhern,6,Mon Jun 29 12:41:39 2015 UTC,We should trade for Brandon Wright
pacers,3bewam,gavingru,5,Sun Jun 28 17:03:05 2015 UTC,"he would literally fit perfectly into what the pacers are trying to accomplish offensively next year. Not a starter, but one of the best backups you can get in the league."
pacers,3bewam,burneezy,6,Mon Jun 29 04:14:11 2015 UTC,Monta. He got it all.
pacers,3bewam,XC_Stallion92,2,Sun Jun 28 17:43:50 2015 UTC,please please please please. He is so much better than what he used to be.  So much more efficient as a scorer and passer compared to earlier in his career. Would be a nice boost for that awful offense last year.
pacers,3bewam,burneezy,2,Mon Jun 29 04:15:59 2015 UTC,Everything but keyboard skills
pacers,3bewam,yoloswagtacos,5,Mon Jun 29 12:00:27 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see a Danny Green, Demare Carroll, Khris Middleton, Jae Crowder, etc.  Wes Matthews - big risk with the injury but he's super good."

pacers,3bewam,DonnieNarco,2,Sun Jun 28 19:28:28 2015 UTC,It'll depend on if/what we get for Roy. He could open up the cap even more.
pacers,3bewam,Lightning_Boi,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:38:19 2015 UTC,"If we get someone valuable for Roy, do you think we will go out and get another valuable player tho?"
pacers,3bewam,Anicole2196,2,Sun Jun 28 16:49:09 2015 UTC,I don't really know who would want to come. We would probably re-sign Stuckey and hopefully Aldridge I guess.
pacers,3bewam,Lightning_Boi,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:55:55 2015 UTC,What big men do you think we could straight up trade for Roy?? I can't think of anyone off the top of my head.
pacers,3bewam,ls215,2,Sun Jun 28 21:40:24 2015 UTC,Monta.
pacers,3bewam,MFLBlunts,2,Sun Jun 28 17:11:22 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind throwing a bid for Reggie Jackson, worst case scenario Detroit matches. IMO there aren't many great fits for us this year, I'd go big and go hard at LMA, possibly involving a Roy sign and trade w/ Portland or something. Honestly I don't like any other FAs this year."
pacers,3bewam,Frostler,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:19:30 2015 UTC,I was hoping the pacers would of done a Reggie Jackson for hibbert trade when he was on okc and when they had Perkins eating shit. If we could somehow get LMA free agents would likely have a lot more interest in the pacers than usual.

pacers,3bewam,chewyjackson,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:16:24 2015 UTC,Honestly I don't think we will have the cap room to sign more then a single starting PF for 6m a season (1-3 year deal).  Rest will be min contracts/resigning free agents/maybe pay a bit more for a backup PG
pacers,3bewam,Drak_is_Right,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:12:39 2015 UTC,"yep, unless we somehow trade Hibbs, this will be fairly quiet summer for us."
pacers,3bewam,pfc_bgd,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:47:21 2015 UTC,We aren't going to get anyone worth much until February when we dump Hibbert to a team that desperately needs some size for someone who is going to fit our new whole small ball thing now.
pacers,3bewam,zzellers,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:43:31 2015 UTC,"We should try to pick up Cody zeller from the Hornets! He's underpriced and the hornets signed Marvin Williams to a new contract. smh Cody is younger and has talent that people overlook cuz he's not a talker. If we had a starting line up of turner zeller pg cj and gh we'd be like the friggen monstars with mad length, perimeter d and the up tempo speed we're going for"
pacers,3bewam,TheGslack,0,Tue Jun 30 12:38:31 2015 UTC,But I would like to see Monta on the Pacers even if we have to severely overpay him just his presents on the court would create much needed offense
pacers,3bewam,Swagboi9,0,Sun Jun 28 17:51:26 2015 UTC,"My list would be Aldridge, Dragic, Millsap, Tristan Thompson, and Monta Ellis. I'm hoping we get Stuckey back."

pacers,3bewam,h3isenburg,2,Sun Jun 28 22:18:33 2015 UTC,Apparently there is a good chance he signs with us.
pacers,3bewam,aidsfarts,2,Mon Jun 29 01:32:46 2015 UTC,"Not really sure why everyone's hating on him. It's not like he's a terrible player, he just got pushed into two systems that he had no business playing in."
pacers,3bewam,exWarlock,-1,Mon Jun 29 13:40:55 2015 UTC,"I hope not. He will get burnt by every single point guard in the league. No D and very inconsistent. His 3 point shooting isn't good, imo, and he will turn the ball over too much.  Rather keep g.hill there even though i wanna see him as our 6th"

pacers,3b9at5,Dax_Webster,2,Sat Jun 27 17:30:11 2015 UTC,"Purdue student and of course Pacers fan here. Loved the way he played and how hard he works, but I don't think he has a jumper or some key assets to being a professional basketball player at the NBA level."
pacers,3ba25t,MC_Reagan,3,Sat Jun 27 05:41:48 2015 UTC,"20-25 minutes is my guess. Some at center, and if west does leave,  quite a few at PF."
pacers,3ba25t,scottw5150,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:27:05 2015 UTC,I could see him as our starting PF if we still have Hibbert at the beginning of the year unless PG gets those starts.
pacers,3ba25t,Frostler,5,Sun Jun 28 22:27:20 2015 UTC,It depends on if Hibbert's status really.
pacers,3ba25t,DonnieNarco,2,Sat Jun 27 14:58:28 2015 UTC,TBH I'd be very scared of Turner/Mahimi being our centers for the whole season.  Mahimi is limited offensively/foul prone while rookies need a bit of adapting.
pacers,3ba25t,Drak_is_Right,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:16:41 2015 UTC,"We're not going to win a lot next year regardless.  I think throwing Turner to the wolves may help him adjust.  Mahinmi was pretty solid last year, and hopefully he's worked to lower his foul troubles."
pacers,3ba25t,DonnieNarco,2,Sun Jun 28 20:24:15 2015 UTC,"dont bet against it.  the east is still weak.  I could see a 45-55 win year and ECF if things fall right (Hibbert playing ok, but not great.  Turner being a quality 2nd string player.  Us getting a halfway decent starting PF in free agency).  unless we have injury troubles we will be a better team then last year.  hell, if Lebron leaves the cavs NBA finals and losing in 5 games to the west could be an option"
pacers,3ba25t,Drak_is_Right,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:29:29 2015 UTC,"This is what I was thinking. The worse Hibbert performs in spots, the more likely we are to play Turner. I think their minutes will sort of balance out as the season goes on though."
pacers,3ba25t,imkunu,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:08:13 2015 UTC,"If Hibbert is traded I think Turner will play about 24 minutes. If he isn't, maybe 10."
pacers,3ba25t,DonnieNarco,2,Sun Jun 28 03:19:40 2015 UTC,if we trade hibbert...we should start him
pacers,3ba25t,aj3388,3,Sun Jun 28 20:11:20 2015 UTC,"I think for the first 1/3 of the season he will receive 8-12 minutes with a lot of DNP - coach's decision, but if we have a dearth of big men it could be more"
pacers,3ba25t,Drak_is_Right,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:50:22 2015 UTC,"The rest of the teams in be East are getting better, and there are a lot of teams changing their strategies after last season/Finals. I think we will learn after a month into 2015-16 that Myles will be getting lots of minutes."
pacers,3ba25t,exWarlock,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:59:58 2015 UTC,"If we make the playoffs, I will be surprised if Turner receives more than 16 minutes a game.  Only way he plays more then that is injuries or other issues cause us to have a very thin front line."
pacers,3b9kvx,ISUCKATKARMA,29,Sat Jun 27 02:33:29 2015 UTC,"People are not looking at the big picture with Roy, it seems like everyone has turned on him. He hasn't played up to his contract, but the facts are that Roy has been the Pacers starting center for 7 years and never had a major injury or missed significant time. That's nothing to scoff at. And this is a guy who gets after loose balls on the floor. He has generally averaged about 11 points and seven or 8 rebounds. Not that bad. He is an excellent free throw shooter and is 7'2'', rare. He is a two time all star.   Beyond that he has been an extremely positive figure in the community for a franchise that desperately needed a positive figure. There was even a show about Indiana (parks and rec) and Roy appeared on it and was even funny, for Indiana, that's rare as hen's tooth as far as a national media and sports collaboration. Unheard of for our hick state actually, and good for the Pacers. Roy and Area 55 seem to have brought a semblance of passion to the placid Pacers fanbase. I think y'all motherfuckers got short memories.   When the Pacers drafted Roy they weren't shit and they quickly overachieved and advanced beyond that what was expected with their talent level. Roy was a huge part of that.  And finally, like everyone says he is a good defender, a very good shot blocker and an excellent rim defender. The sum of all this, is that he was inconsistent at times and overpaid, and everyone took a big shit right in his face. I'd be pissed too. Fucking haters."
pacers,3b9kvx,TonofSoil,6,Sat Jun 27 06:25:25 2015 UTC,"I agree, but his inconsistency appears to be the result of a lack of effort. Zero rebounds in playoff games? How the fuck does that happen?"
pacers,3b9kvx,teamretard_,3,Sat Jun 27 18:11:29 2015 UTC,He's a great player. It is his attitude people have a problem with.
pacers,3b9kvx,aidsfarts,2,Sun Jun 28 05:28:27 2015 UTC,I don't think him being on the floor is him getting after loose balls... I'm fairly certain that's just a gravity issue
pacers,3b9kvx,crazytrain2009,1 point,Sat Jun 27 07:21:04 2015 UTC,Haha this is true. He falls over a ton. It IS frustrating to see how awkward he can be and be pushed around by smaller guys because his balance is so bad. I am definitely not saying he's perfect.  But I have seen him get on the floor intentionally after loose balls.
pacers,3b9kvx,TonofSoil,-6,Sat Jun 27 15:58:07 2015 UTC,fuck roy hibbert.
pacers,3b9kvx,h3isenburg,5,Sun Jun 28 22:28:34 2015 UTC,"Making coordinated statements basically equating to ""opt out or you're getting benched"" at the end of last season probably sealed the deal. Hibbert has not lived up to his end of the contract though, but the way that it was handled was pretty unprofessional."
pacers,3b9kvx,TheRevCharlieWaffles,2,Sat Jun 27 03:28:27 2015 UTC,"I honestly think its just how the fans turned on him.  Look at how rattled he got on the court from bad games and shooting - things fans, media, coaches, and execs said rattled him the same way."
pacers,3b9kvx,Drak_is_Right,14,Sat Jun 27 03:35:21 2015 UTC,"Didn't Roy have a couple games late last season with like 0 points and 2 rebounds? When you're 7'2"" that's not a bad game, that's playing shitty on purpose. That rightfully pissed people off. Did that hurt his feelings? Who cares? He's 28 years old and being paid 15 million dollars, suck it up. I hate to say it but, Hibbert really enforces the ""NBA players are spoiled children"" stereotype."
pacers,3b9kvx,aidsfarts,2,Sat Jun 27 03:54:33 2015 UTC,"Seeing a lot of people citing the rebounding stat here, but I don't think that tells the whole story.   Challenging shots leave you out of position to grab rebounds as you're facing the shooter not the rim Roy is great at boxing out to let teammates grab rebounds. Part if the reason our wings have high rebound numbers - they can grab it and get out and run.   Do I think Roy lived up to his contract? No. Do I think he played as poorly as fans think? No. Do I think he phoned it in as we chased the playoffs? No."
pacers,3b9kvx,herrrr-me-nerrrr,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:38:11 2015 UTC,"Mentally, Roy seems to be one of the softest athletes in today's NBA.  He takes a lot of things extremely personally, like any criticism he received for his play falling off a cliff.  When a guy like Larry Bird challenged him to step up and was looking for him to opt out, he seemed to take offense to that instead of use it as motivation."
pacers,3b9kvx,poorchris,0,Sat Jun 27 17:45:24 2015 UTC,"About the time he was on record saying ""We have some selfish dudes up in here"".  It'll never be proven, but supposedly either Lance/PG slept with Roy's fiance. From my understanding of the rumor mill, Roy had a good time on his honeymoon in Vegas with an Asian woman and this was her way of getting back at him. Even if it wasn't true, it was about this time that Roy and his Fiance took some extra time before the wedding.  This of course is all conjecture, but it coincides with when he took a nose-dive.  The other thing that I DO know is that Roy did start playing MMOs, specifically WoW. I'm not sure if that matters that much, but as a former player myself, it takes up a lot of time that could be spent in the gym."

pacers,3b8m17,h3isenburg,-1,Sat Jun 27 12:53:17 2015 UTC,"He's done mentally. I don't think he'll ever recover from that.

Hopefully not w/ us..... :-/"

Very important  how we deal with Hibbert this season. Do you guys think he'll resent the team if he doesn't get traded but know the team wanted to ship him?

pacers,3b8m17,Lightning_Boi,4,Sat Jun 27 02:04:57 2015 UTC,I feel that we could have been fine with hibbert as C And myles as a PF. He could have taught myles how to lock down the post. Too bad the FO and Roy as basically through with each other already.
pacers,3b8m17,aidsfarts,3,Sat Jun 27 02:38:55 2015 UTC,I still don't know who would want Hibbert and if it would even be worth what we got for him.
pacers,3b8m17,Einsteiniac,3,Sat Jun 27 03:57:14 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter how he feels about the team. He's in the last year of his contract and he's a huge question mark. This is a good thing for the Pacers. If he wants to sign another fat contract somewhere else next season, he's going to have to play his ass off this season to quiet the doubters. That only helps us. If Hibbert is engaged and playing hard, he's probably worth that $15.5 million for his defense alone.  On the other hand, if he wants to pout and take the season off, there's a spot on the bench for him. But that's going to be really bad for his future in the league and he knows it."

pacers,3b6iii,THE_BIG_SITT,4,Mon Jun 29 00:11:11 2015 UTC,Yeah he looks good. I wouldn't rely to heavily on him stretching the court. He has a bit of a hitch between him catching the ball and when he begins the shooting motion. That's how NBA guys get one step closer and swat the shot away.
pacers,3b6iii,THE_BIG_SITT,6,Fri Jun 26 11:33:49 2015 UTC,"Even just one dribble, jumping, and dunking looks so much more coordinated and mobile than Roy does."
pacers,3b6iii,Frostler,3,Fri Jun 26 11:41:56 2015 UTC,Absolutely. Roy is too soft. He would rather drop step and shoot a hook then dunk it on someone.
pacers,3b6iii,THE_BIG_SITT,4,Fri Jun 26 11:46:25 2015 UTC,"jump shots are one thing that can be fixed though, just look at MKG's jumper from when he started in the NBA to now. I wouldn't be too worried about it."
pacers,3b6iii,Wafflecone416,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:59:41 2015 UTC,"Good point. His form is good, he just needs to get to his motion quicker."
pacers,3b6iii,materhern,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:50:40 2015 UTC,Most of the time when centers shoot jump shots they're pretty wide open because other fives aren't used to guarding on the perimeter. His hitch in his shot won't hurt him as much as it would as it would if he played other positions.  He does need to get rid of it though.
pacers,3b6iii,bigbassdaddy,3,Sun Jun 28 22:58:08 2015 UTC,I think he's actually an upgrade from Roy and won't be stunned if Roy is on the bench half way through the season.

pacers,3b6iii,bigbassdaddy,3,Fri Jun 26 17:13:05 2015 UTC,"Just from this video he looks like he's right between Hibbert and Mahimni, be he adds the shooting we've seen from West/Scola.  Right now, I don't think he brings anything transformative to the position, he just checks a lot of the boxes of aspects we have and want.  I think it's important to note that he's incredibly young, and in Bird's short presser last night he spoke about how much Turner as already improved over the last few months.  A lot of guys hit a huge development stride their second year at school, we're just going to see that jump as he becomes a pro.  My favorite moment of that video was the baseline jumpers.  Udonis Haslem won two playoff games against us hitting only that shot.  If we can utilize that early on, we might be able to make another team feel about Turner the way we feel about Haslem and Mike Scott."

pacers,3b702u,CanadaRULEZ1765,5,Fri Jun 26 15:02:01 2015 UTC,I absolutely hated it at first. I wanted WCS so bad and after he was taken off the board I expected us to get Trey Lyles. I still think Lyles would have been the better pick but I'm not going to put off Turner without seeing him play. I will say he has a great personality and work ethic. He seems like the type of player to really work day in and day out to get better. He's working on fixing his running form which is already a lot more effort than some players are willing put in. In one of his pre draft workout videos he said his shot has gotten much better and he's moving more fluid on defense compared to college. Those are two great signs. I have high hopes for this kid.
pacers,3b702u,Airegus,2,Fri Jun 26 14:48:07 2015 UTC,"Character comes into draft picks for sure, and Turner seems like a really grounded level headed kid. But there was, IMO, so much more talent there we could have taken. Talent that fits with how we are trying to play. lyles would have slotted in perfectly and he's a great character dude as well. We have needed a playmaking PG forever and we had the opportunity to grab one. And I think booker is going to be a STUD, and cj and stuckey aren't long term solutions there.  Sure enough, those three went all in a row right after turner cause they were the best talent on the board. We reached with this pick. I hope it works out, but we passed up more talented safer picks for him :("
pacers,3b702u,GrandBasterd,3,Fri Jun 26 15:13:19 2015 UTC,"I was unsure of the pick at first, but after sleeping on it, I like it. We aren't gonna be real contenders this coming up season (maybe not even the season after that) so he'll have time to develop without having a ton of pressure on him. He said he wanted to be a part of the team, so that tells me that he'll put in a ton of work to become better. Plus, he seems like an nice educated guy. I think I saw on Twitter than he apologized for using too many umm's in an interview."
pacers,3b702u,pickle_man_4,2,Fri Jun 26 14:20:08 2015 UTC,"I also had to sleep on it, last night I wasn't happy at all with the pick at first. Hearing that he needs to work on running was a big WTF moment, I cant recall the last time I heard something like that spoken of a lottery pick but since I've heard it was something he's contusion about and has already began to work on it Im ok with it some what. Hopefully he can develop into something special. Im a true Pacer fan so I'll talk myself into thinking he's the best thing since sliced bread by Monday. Hopefully he can show some signs in Summer League in the next few weeks."
pacers,3b702u,Jsun2k15,2,Fri Jun 26 15:44:13 2015 UTC,"I really don't see much of a different choice.  With Kaminsky and WCS gone, anyone else would of been a reach.  Payne to me was even higher risk, though high reward if he looks like Lilliard in 2 years.  Still, while a PG would of been nice - it would of displaced Hill without cap room to solve multiple holes at big man positions.  Easier to draft a guard in the second round then a non-project big man.  To me it looks like we got third string guard (and will be second string in a year or two) and the 4th or 5th man in our big man rotation (and a starter in 1-2 years).  Here is hoping Turner becomes a 10 year younger version of Aldridge."
pacers,3b702u,Drak_is_Right,2,Fri Jun 26 19:38:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly I am ok with this.  I think there was probably 4 different big men who were all close to equal overall (different skillsets) and this was one of them.  While not the fastest, the center will be out of position most often due to the need to rebound and shot block in transition.    I think if his shot is similar to that of Aldridge, he will find a spot even if he can't cut to the basket like WCS/Aldridge.  Probably will be a Center, though I realize there is a chance he is a PF.  Now if Miami had let someone fall just a bit further, I think we would of had a different pick (or even more likely - 2 picks and a trade)."
pacers,3b702u,Drak_is_Right,2,Fri Jun 26 16:30:11 2015 UTC,"Well, since Kaminsky was gone, yes."
pacers,3b702u,bigbassdaddy,2,Fri Jun 26 17:16:18 2015 UTC,"I'm ""okay"" with it. He has a lot of upside potential. The Pacers obviously are wanting to move on from Roy, and he was really the last center available. I'd be lying if I said that I'm not disappointed that a couple of other guys didn't fall to us (WCS, Kaminsky), but I never really thought they would if we didn't trade up. Also, I'm a little concerned about Turners awkward running style and if it will cause him other problems down the road, but I like the combination of jump shooting/interior defense that he could bring to the table.  Edit to add that he seems like he has a great attitude and is reported to be an exceptionally hard worker, and those are always great things to add to your team."
pacers,3b702u,2600forlife,2,Fri Jun 26 17:27:04 2015 UTC,"I think turner was a great pick, I would have taken him over kaminsky any day especially since we're trying to move to a more up tempo offense. I love turners ability to explosively jam the basketball, none of this slow ass double clutching Roy hibbert crap. Everyone talks about his awkward running style but it doesn't appear to slow him down so I don't see a problem. Hell we could look back and say I'm glad the dude runs funny or else he wouldn't have slipped to us in the draft. I'm a huge proponent of getting local talent considering Indiana is the Mecca of young talent but lyles is undersized and once wcs went off the board and especially since west opted out it was a no brainier. scrappy point guards can be found via the d league and in terms of number of players at the position in the NBA right now vs the number of capable big guys we would have made a mistake going for Payne. Basically Larry is king go pacers"

pacers,3b6ltd,Anicole2196,4,Fri Jun 26 11:44:34 2015 UTC,I dont see ua trading roy. Myles is not ready to start. Unless people are comfortable with Ian starting.
pacers,3b6ltd,Sheffield178,2,Fri Jun 26 13:00:03 2015 UTC,"Ya I agree. I don't understand people's eagerness to get rid of HIbbert. Sure we are paying him a couple of million more than he is worth, but I really don't see us getting any other center close to his defensive skill. It's not like there are a ton of centers out there who can play on a similar level on the defensive end and who have a better offensive game than Hibbert, and if they're are they would probably cost just as much as Hibbert."
pacers,3b6ltd,stushow,4,Fri Jun 26 13:33:36 2015 UTC,"Two reasons why I'd get rid of Hibbert:  1) He has proven in the last season and a half that he is capable of being absolutely worthless. Worthless on the glass, worthless offensively, and worthless defensively against any center with decent mobility. Sure, he can defend the rim if the opposing team plays in a way which allows Hibbert to camp out around the paint, but that's rarely the case.   2) This is much less important, but I'd love to get rid of him out of principle. Such uselessness and a lack of heart needs to come with some sort of a ""punishment""."
pacers,3b6ltd,pfc_bgd,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:11:05 2015 UTC,Ya I can see your points. I guess I just really like him and would be a bit sad to see him go:(

I think I would go down to probably Horford, who is making $12 million a year which is only $3 million less than Hibbert. After him I think it's quite a large drop off in talent. I really don't understand how we are going to get a better center for much cheaper."
pacers,3b6ltd,stushow,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:04:02 2015 UTC,"Depending on how we are wanting to change the offense, I would much rather have:   Noah Jefferson Horford Gortat Splitter"

pacers,3b6ltd,stushow,2,Fri Jun 26 14:15:44 2015 UTC,"I'm OK with Ian starting. He's a high energy big that fits the mold of a team that wants to run. He's athletic and can just be asked to hunt rebounds/put backs. Bottom line is I think the team would be more fun to watch without hibbert. After watching this awful offense for years, I want to enjoy these games more."
pacers,3b6ltd,GrandBasterd,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:07:44 2015 UTC,"But with Hibbert as inconsistent as he is, I might want someone a little less talented, a little faster, and with better effort to start anyway"

pacers,3b6oz9,Pacers31Colts18,13,Fri Jun 26 12:18:57 2015 UTC,"Stop freaking about Turner, guys.   Turner is not a nutcase.  He's a hardworking, proud guy.  He'll love it here, and what reason is there to not love him? He has a running problem, due to undeveloped muscles apparently.  He went and saw a doctor about it, and he hasn't grown into his body 100% yet. Who else are we going to take to replace Hibbert once WCS was off the board? He was the best available, simple as that. We took Lance, Paul, and Solomon.  Look at the time it took them to develop.  The fact that the FO took this guy means he's well worth the time.  Patience pays off. It sucks about WCS.  That's fine.  It happens. It sucks about Winslow.  That's fine. It happens. Take a moment to cool your head off, and think about the situation in our context.  Was it possible we moved up? maybe. Did we? No. Are we surprised? I would have been more surprised about moving up."

pacers,3b6oz9,Smart_Dumb,7,Fri Jun 26 17:52:09 2015 UTC,Im not convinced that we should move Hibbert or that we are going to be making any major moves this offseason.  Hibbert is more valuable to us now than later. People say a big one year expiring contract is attractive so people will trade for it...but why dont we want to hold on to that? At the very least maybe we can do something with him at the deadline but I wouldnt mind just having him run out. Either we resign him for way less or use our new cap space on something next summer. edit: He is a valuable player for us and is crucial to our identity as a defensive team. Hibbert is a good player I dont want to bail on him  IMO I dont see Monta Ellis being the answer to our problems. Aldridge and Gasol are pipe dreams. The only players I think can help our team we are not in play for. Losing D West sucks and I think its gonna mess us up a little because thats 12mil this year I dont think we should spend. We do really need a 4 though even if PG is gonna be playing that.   We picked Turner who is going to take some time. We will not be legit competitors this season. Lets just focus on at least getting to the playoffs and using a lot of cap space next summer. Lets wait instead of forcing things now.
pacers,3b6oz9,mrpooh31,4,Fri Jun 26 13:15:20 2015 UTC,"I just have a scary feeling that our defense will decline rapidly if we trade away Hibbert. I mean sure his offense sucks, but I would rather have a defensive anchor than have a center who has 3 more rebounds and a few more points a game. I think fans are taking what he brings to our team for granite and it will show if we trade him."
pacers,3b6oz9,stushow,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:36:58 2015 UTC,"The only players I think can help our team we are not in play for.   This is the reality of small market, even with the pull of PG13.  West was an exception to the rule, and that happened mostly because of concerns about his knee.  There's no point in clearing gobs of cap space if the best we can use it on if 4 year contracts for role players (even though I do like the Miles and Mahimni signings in years past).  Also, something unexpected happens (sometimes) during contract years.  We don't know what will happen with Roy on the court.  Maybe he realizes his best course of action is to play to his potential early this year and use it as an audition for his next team.  More likely though, he is who we saw last year and he's just going to play solid D until Miles can contribute more on the back end of the season.  I still just want to see us bring Stuckey and either Scola or Allen back before any other dominoes fall this offseason."

pacers,3b6oz9,yobramine,3,Fri Jun 26 15:44:12 2015 UTC,"I think we got two players this draft that will both make the regular season roster.  Joseph Young I think will start the season as a 3rd string guard.  Myles Turner will be late in the big man rotation to start the season, but could crack the second string at either PF or C later this season.  As many analysts described Turner:  a medium risk high reward player.  Higher risk of a complete bust then nearly all of the players ahead of him which is the only reason he fell to 11.  Good chance he is a quality starter, maybe even a couple of All-star seasons.  I think we could very well be getting a 15-8-2 kind of player."
pacers,3b6oz9,Drak_is_Right,2,Fri Jun 26 16:38:49 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't understand why people are upset. I love Turner in Vogel's defensive system and I think he'll be a great pick in a year or two. Before the possibility of WCS arose a few weeks back and before Winslow nearly fell to us at #11, I thought Turner was the best fit and would be the best available. I am a Butler grad and I was terrified every time Turner was on the floor in the tournament.  Mighty Joe Young is a great fit in the second round. He can come in right away and play next to George Hill or CJ Miles. If we resign Stuckey he'll work there as well. Great shooter and a confident offensive player.  I love both picks and whether or not we keep Hibbert I expect the Pacers will be in the 4-8 spots in the East this season with heeps of cap room coming."

pacers,3b4zxw,scottw5150,3,Fri Jun 26 01:18:02 2015 UTC,"Speaking as an exercise professional, you don't 'fix' that issue. It's a part of your body that you can adjust, but not in 1-2 years time. For 19 years this is how he has run, it's going to take 5-10 years to fix IF that and it's not going to take him that long to injure himself.   Athletes that are extremely tall have so much pressure put on their joints. To add to that someone who runs funny? It's a recipe for disaster. I hope to God I am wrong, but I will tell you as I continue to say over and over, he's going to have an ACL/MCL sprain in less than 3 years and will have back issues quicker than that.   The way the body works when you run is like a spring, take a coiled spring and twist it over and over in a way other than directly compressed. You will see 'stress marks' start appearing. This is what will happen or has happened already to him. I know they will give him all the opportunity in the world, but the NBA game is a stressful game on the body and he's about to experience it.   I'm not on the bust athletically wise, but as a phsyical specimen? He's Greg Oden 2.0."
pacers,3b4zxw,NateThomas1979,6,Fri Jun 26 02:19:40 2015 UTC,"Greg Oden didn't run funny. Greg Oden had a faster 3/4 court sprint (the NBA's version of the 40 yard dash) than Kevin Durant.  Also, I don't question that you are an exercise professional, but I do know the Pacers have an award winning training staff. I feel like if it were that black and white they would've been the first to point it out, especially after watching him and getting the chance to work him out in person (Turner came in for an in-person workout in front of the staff)."

Hibbert's going to opt-in for this last season, but the organization is done with him and I'm sure the feeling is mutual. So, one year from now, unless something bizarre happens, Hibbert's gone and we're left with what? Mahinmi?

pacers,3b4zxw,wocks,3,Fri Jun 26 01:11:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not ecstatic with the pick, but I think in a year or two we'll be considering him a huge upgrade from Hibbert considering he can also stretch the floor and shoot.  He can also run.  He's not going to be as good a rim protector as Hib, but I think he'll more than make up for it."

pacers,3b4zxw,seemoreglass83,4,Fri Jun 26 01:00:00 2015 UTC,"Dont get your panties in a bunch.  I wanted Payne, but this is not a terrible/useless player.  I will be interested to see what we do with him once we figure out where Hibbert is going."
pacers,3b4zxw,pacerpower,5,Fri Jun 26 01:02:54 2015 UTC,I bet us not getting Payne means we're going after a PG in free agency.  Cross your fingers and toes for Monta.
pacers,3b4zxw,yobramine,6,Fri Jun 26 01:06:49 2015 UTC,Monta is a point guard in the same sense that George Hill is a point guard. It would be great if we could get a real point guard.
pacers,3b4zxw,XC_Stallion92,3,Fri Jun 26 01:14:01 2015 UTC,Lin?  Rondo?  What other true PG's are out there that we can afford?
pacers,3b4zxw,yobramine,12,Fri Jun 26 01:17:01 2015 UTC,"Never Rondo, please never Rondo!"
pacers,3b4zxw,materhern,3,Fri Jun 26 01:21:56 2015 UTC,"Lol my point exactly.  Unless we pull off a blockbuster trade, there isn't a great true PG on the market except for Dragic, who we can't afford at all.  What to do??  Larry halp."
pacers,3b4zxw,yobramine,2,Fri Jun 26 01:28:08 2015 UTC,"Well, we've gone without a true point guard for a long time.  I think we'd be just fine with a pg similar to George Hill.  He doesn't seem upset not getting the ball all the time, so him and Ellis could be a good mix.  Though honestly I think they'll end up going with Hill and Miles in the front court.  Ellis averages near 20 points a game.  He and George would be a credible threat teams would have to guard against, which should free PG up.  And Turner doesn't have a bad outside shot, which helps as well."
pacers,3b4zxw,materhern,3,Fri Jun 26 01:45:57 2015 UTC,No idea. That's why we should have drafted Payne.
pacers,3b4zxw,XC_Stallion92,2,Fri Jun 26 01:27:05 2015 UTC,Ty Lawson?

pacers,3b4zxw,GrandBasterd,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:25:54 2015 UTC,So what if he turns into a Hibbert  reincarnation? He'll be a reincarnation that's 13 million dollars cheaper. That's the KEY.
pacers,3b4zxw,-thomasjefferson-1,0,Fri Jun 26 04:51:57 2015 UTC,"Hibbert is a 7 footer who never averaged over 50% from the field. Pathetic. Him and turner just get pushed around down there, can't finish and can't rebound. Even WCS who has 'no offensive game at all' averages around 60% from the field. If turner can't average 50% in college, how's he gunna do it in the pros? Neither of these guys rebound either....they are just big and frail. We coulda had an elite shooter, a possible elite passer/playmaker, or a versatile PF instead of this project with tons of down side that goes 100% against the way the organization supposedly wants to play. Also, any player they draft is gunna not have Hibberts crazy contract, that doesn't mean they have to repeat the same mistakes."
pacers,3b4zxw,GrandBasterd,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:38:19 2015 UTC,He can't be any slower than Hibbert and with PG going to the power forward spot we'll be plenty fast on the break

pacers,3b4zxw,tergiversation,-5,Fri Jun 26 01:30:02 2015 UTC,He's Hibbert v1.b. I don't even give him version 2.0 because he's going to be injured in less than 3 years. ACL/MCL tear and back issues both. Calling it right now.
pacers,3b4zxw,NateThomas1979,2,Fri Jun 26 02:14:55 2015 UTC,why would you WANT to call something like that?
pacers,3b4zxw,burneezy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:15:30 2015 UTC,"I don't. I really don't. I'm telling you from a physical standpoint, in my studies, the quickest turn around is 3-4 years. Meanwhile he's dealing with the stresses of a season for 82 games.   I'm calling it because I can't even begin to fathom why we would take a risk like this when the desire was to go to an 'uptempo' game. He's not suited for uptempo, and putting him into that type of environment is only going to further exacerbate the issues he's facing already.  He's a good kid. I like him as a person, and I feel horrible that the Pacers would select him because of the amount of pressure that he is going to endure on his knees and back. Even bigs that don't have the ugly gait get these issues, imagine how bad it is going to be for someone who puts extra stress on his joints?"
pacers,3b4zxw,NateThomas1979,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:36:10 2015 UTC,well the medical staff didn't see a problem with it so whats the big deal? they wouldnt have taken him if it would be a problem. simple as that.

pacers,3b5jo2,Frostler,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:17:41 2015 UTC,"he is a mid second round pick.  I think Larry is hoping he stays on the roster as a 3rd string shooting guard or point guard.  Miles/Hill first string (unless a free agent steal is made), Stuckey/X - second string, Young (third string)  What I really wonder is what is going to become of our front court.  Besides signing a backup point guard and Stuckey, I think the rest will have to go towards a PF to start.  If we let Hibbert go, our front court would be Wittington, Myles Turner, and Mahimi.  That is it.  Resign Scola and you are still looking for at least 1 starting quality PF if not PF and C both.  Hack a Mahimi is a brutal strategy that will work if he is given to many minutes."
pacers,3b5jo2,Drak_is_Right,2,Fri Jun 26 08:29:35 2015 UTC,"Lavoy Allen may have a future there if we get him back and he keeps developing. I'd guess that our future front court will be Turner/Mahinmi/Wittington at C and George/Allen at PF. Solo Hill probably gets the 3 spot, but our point guard and shooting guard spots are the ones where I think we should look to use the money. GHill can play both so we just need the best guard available to us. I'm hoping that we can grab a starting quality guard in a Hibbert trade to solve that issue though."
pacers,3b5jo2,Frostler,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:58:01 2015 UTC,"Everybody including PG seems to be indicating they want to try him at PF.  I think the idea is find a center who can run, play PG at PF, Miles at SF, and Hill and fill in the blank (Stuckey, Monta Ellis, ?)in the backcourt.    But we heard that a few years back, Hibbert dropped a bunch of weight because they were going to run and they didn't stick with it because they didn't really have the right players.  I wonder if this group is any better suited to small ball?"

pacers,3b454r,Pacers31Colts18,3,Thu Jun 25 20:34:07 2015 UTC,If we get the 18th with him I would be ok with that. Then trade back up a couple of spots and get somebody who starts falling.
pacers,3b454r,PaulGeorgeDaRealMVP,3,Thu Jun 25 22:19:15 2015 UTC,ffs. If we trade out pick to boston i'll be furious. There's no one on that lineup that I think is worth the 11th.
pacers,3b454r,Airegus,2,Thu Jun 25 21:12:56 2015 UTC,"I like Smart, personally. Great defensively, and the kid hustles his ass off. His offensive skills aren't quite there, but Paul George wasn't the elite offensive weapon he is now when he came into the league. My biggest issue would be giving up a first round pick this year. If Indiana can trade the 11th pick to Boston for Smart and the 18th pick or a first rounder next year. I say go for it"

pacers,3b454r,Swagboi9,5,Thu Jun 25 21:25:46 2015 UTC,I would rather just deal with 1 more year of hibbert

pacers,3b29rb,Packattack622,4,Thu Jun 25 20:29:25 2015 UTC,"I love that this draft is so deep, but at the same time, it terrifies me. I feel like there could be a ton of All-Star candidates - so naturally, if we miss on our pick, I will torture myself with ""what-ifs"" for many years to come."
pacers,3b29rb,Packattack622,3,Thu Jun 25 14:05:50 2015 UTC,Jazz fan here. With West opting out I'm guessing that means y'all are set on drafting a big man? I've heard rumblings of Cauley-Stein but if he doesn't fall to you then who? A lot of Jazz fans are really hyped on Myles Turner and I was just wondering the likelihood of him going to you guys at #11.
pacers,3b29rb,-thomasjefferson-1,6,Thu Jun 25 12:10:49 2015 UTC,"Right now, our targets seem to be WCS, Lyles, Turner, Payne, and Kaminsky.  I think it's in that order of wants and needs but the last three can swapped around."
pacers,3b29rb,Packattack622,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:29:23 2015 UTC,Hmm I didn't really do a lot of research on Lyles. Since it seems we're both looking for big men what do you guys know about him? Can he shoot with any sort of range? I think that's our top priority. Gobert has 0 range and Favors is still working to improve his jumper although it's miles better than it used to be.
pacers,3b29rb,yobramine,3,Thu Jun 25 12:34:49 2015 UTC,"He's got a beautiful midrange game, but struggles from the 3... But he's got the touch and skills to improve imo. Great scorer inside and difficult to defend. Simply put, if you put this man close to the basket, he will find a way score and he will... Either through post moves, face up shooting, or beating the defender off the dribble. At UK he was one of their best offensive weapons, and he would quietly have 10+ point games playing only half the time he would on another college team (due to kentucky's platoon/depth). I think on any other college team, his ability wouldn't even be a question. He's 6'10 and 250 pounds but he can defend any position with guard like agility. Good passer with a great basketball IQ. Athleticism and ball handling both impressive.  This guy is really just a piece of clay that can be molded into what the pacers need."
pacers,3b29rb,Packattack622,2,Thu Jun 25 13:12:37 2015 UTC,"You've convinced me haha. I wouldn't be upset if the Jazz took him. He sounds similar to Turner except that Turner is more of an interior defender, is slightly larger, and his shooting and post moves seem to be behind Lyles at this point. Both seem like solid players. Lyles probably is better suited to a team with a need for offense now rather than Turner."
pacers,3b29rb,Duzaman,2,Thu Jun 25 13:17:44 2015 UTC,Check out the sbnation article I posted in here.  Lyles is probably my favorite prospect we're looking at other than WCS.
pacers,3b29rb,Mind_Killer,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:48:12 2015 UTC,Strange. For some reason the page keeps 404'ing. I'll try and read up on him before the draft today if there's a legitimate chance he goes in the 10-15 range.

pacers,3b2ckv,exWarlock,3,Thu Jun 25 19:07:41 2015 UTC,Well that sucks. I think the T'Wolves are having a draft party on their jumbotron and they expect ~10k people tonight. I think that would be cool. To appease the season ticket holders they could keep them in a suite to chill with the players. Oh well. Hopefully a season ticket holder for this upcoming season.
pacers,3b2ckv,Indiana_Pacers,4,Thu Jun 25 19:23:04 2015 UTC,"They used to have it all at the Fieldhouse. STH could roam the floor and had free food and beer with the players.

pacers,3b2ckv,Indiana_Pacers,3,Thu Jun 25 19:52:20 2015 UTC,"The last time that I know they did it was the year after PG was selected. I met him there along with some other players.  Once they started making the playoffs it stopped. I asked them about it one time, the reasoning I got was that it was too big of a liability with the later picks, cause everyone would be drinking for free for a while before they picked. Typically everyone would leave after the Pacers selected."

That was very interesting.   I really like the idea of taking Payne. Dude seems like he scraps and plays with a lot of heart, to me, that goes a long way. But, I can't help to think that guys like this really stand out because of the level of competition these smaller schools go up against. It concerns me.   If WCS and Lyles aren't there at 11 then I have no clue who we should take between Turner or Payne. Hell if WCS, Lyles, Turner are gone at 11, do we trade down and hope to still land Payne?"

Only thing that hurt was him literally being hurt for a bunch of the year, but he definitely proved he can be a secondary ball handler to PG without Stephenson in the way."

pacers,3b1tih,PotassiumAlum,3,Thu Jun 25 07:44:19 2015 UTC,I think the rationale behind this is that we need a replacement for West and that our medical staff didn't clear WCS. But I don't really buy it. If WCS falls to us then I'd bet my ass we'd draft him.
pacers,3b1tih,-thomasjefferson-1,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:46:34 2015 UTC,"Same, although I'd be satisfied with either"
pacers,3b1tih,materhern,2,Thu Jun 25 13:34:09 2015 UTC,"If Hibbert doesn't Opt Out, this is a smart move.  I like Lyles, and while I love Solomon Hill, I don't think he has the offensive ability yet that Lyles does.  I could see Lyles actually starting and making an impact this year."
pacers,3b1tih,scottw5150,4,Thu Jun 25 11:53:35 2015 UTC,You realize Hill and Lyles play different positions right?
pacers,3b1tih,materhern,3,Thu Jun 25 12:17:50 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Sorry I wasn't clear, I'm thinking but not putting all my thoughts down. My thought was that if we don't take a power forward to replace West, that George would slide into the 4 and Solo would move into Georges spot.  Defensively he's solid.  But his offense is severely lacking right now.  Lyles could provide offensive power at the power forward, while keeping George at small forward."
pacers,3b1tih,scottw5150,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:44:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of lyles, but that might be because he was so out of place at Kentucky that it is hard to gauge his talent. I hope we don't give up on solo yet. He has shown some nice flashes of being really good. I don't think anyone really thought he'd even show flashes"
pacers,3b1tih,Pacers31Colts18,2,Thu Jun 25 15:51:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I am fine with us taking:  WCS  Lyles  Kaminsky  Payne  Portis  If we take any of those I will be happy. If we take Turner I won't be."

pacers,3b1gag,btirumala,5,Thu Jun 25 05:02:06 2015 UTC,I doubt anyone would actually want him for the outrageous cap hit that he'll be.
pacers,3b1gag,churrobro,2,Thu Jun 25 05:15:16 2015 UTC,He may be appealing to a team that has a player with a longer contract that they want to have off the books at the end of the upcoming season. But I don't know that that's an attractive option for the Pacers... I guess it would depend on who it is.

pacers,3b1q4b,irollbrokenfingers,2,Thu Jun 25 07:08:01 2015 UTC,I think Hill is slated to be the starting shooting guard next season.

pacers,3b1q4b,Anicole2196,2,Thu Jun 25 17:48:52 2015 UTC,I see no way the Pacers trade Hill unless they get some deal they can't turn down. No way they part with West and Hill in one season.
pacers,3b1q4b,Pacers31Colts18,3,Thu Jun 25 13:36:03 2015 UTC,Gotta remember George Hill is more than just a basketball asset for us.  He's our hometown hero (went to HS and college in Indy).  It'll probably take a lot to convince Larry that it's worth it.
pacers,3b1q4b,yobramine,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:39:27 2015 UTC,"I just hope that Hill will be willing, next year, to take a pay cut to stay with a winning team. I have a feeling, coming off this year, he's going to look a lot more worth that $$$ we reluctantly paid him."

You're in our division, so why are we going to help you get what you want?  It's in our better interest to simply not have anything to do with Cavs.  And what's the point of us giving up Hill?  We lose him and now we have another hole to fix.  The only time we would give up Hill is to get someone like Love or Boogie, and well, we have no shot of getting any of those guys.  Us getting Haywood isn't helpful either.  We don't have the FA power that you see everywhere else even with PG.  We have no chance of getting Alridge or anyone significant at all.  We've gotten by with the draft and bench player signings.  And West is not done for the count yet.  We may see him back."
pacers,3b1q4b,ISUCKATKARMA,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:49:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I figured it wouldn't be beneficial enough for the Pacers. The only way I could see it is if we have a valuable first rounder to attach to Haywood's contract, which we don't."

pacers,3azgi6,gugargioni,3,Wed Jun 24 21:46:02 2015 UTC,And outside of Ellis (and Kaminsky hypothetically) it's a damn good defensive lineup
pacers,3azgi6,theconmeister,8,Wed Jun 24 20:57:53 2015 UTC,"This is for the best especially for the amount we would've been paying him, he's half the player he was when he first got here and apparently we're going to be playing faster so he may not have liked that. I'm still hoping that he comes back for cheaper because he wants us to go get a FA with the money."

pacers,3azgi6,MrGoodness,5,Wed Jun 24 19:30:15 2015 UTC,The time has come for PG to take the reins.
pacers,3azgi6,aidsfarts,4,Wed Jun 24 22:37:52 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what to make of this to be honest.  West seems to be that kind of guy to opt out and restructure his contract so we have a shot at a big signing at the very least.  I'm not going to say he's down for the count until he actually signs with another team.
pacers,3azgi6,ISUCKATKARMA,4,Wed Jun 24 20:03:00 2015 UTC,"Hibbert, just follow his lead! But really I'll be sad to see West go.

pacers,3azgi6,ILikePizzaRolls,7,Wed Jun 24 21:43:55 2015 UTC,"Sorry to see him go, but financially and team building wise, this is best for us.  Clears up money to upgrade a different position or replace him with someone younger.  I like him but he's slowed down a lot, especially on defense."

pacers,3azgi6,TweetPoster,3,Wed Jun 24 19:11:43 2015 UTC,Sad to see him go. I'm shocked honestly.
pacers,3azgi6,Pacers31Colts18,2,Wed Jun 24 19:26:27 2015 UTC,I'd be very surprised if he can get a deal worth more than what he's opting out of.
pacers,3azgi6,indyclone,3,Wed Jun 24 19:46:21 2015 UTC,"That's why I think he'll come back for less, maybe on a longer term deal like 2 years or something. He's obviously coming to the end of his career and maybe he prioritizing winning. at least we can dream that that's the case"
pacers,3azgi6,Frostler,3,Wed Jun 24 19:52:29 2015 UTC,"From the sounds of it, PG is moving to power forward and we're getting a new center.. which doesn't leave much room for West. IMO, the only way he'd be returning is if he exercised his option."
pacers,3azgi6,indyclone,2,Wed Jun 24 19:58:38 2015 UTC,"Bird already said he wants West back, could easily come off the bench or  just play Center like he has for us in the past a couple times."
pacers,3azgi6,Frostler,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:35:30 2015 UTC,I don't doubt Bird wants him back. It seems to me that West doesn't want to be back in a diminished role.

pacers,3azgi6,irollbrokenfingers,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:17:12 2015 UTC,I really doubt that.  He was checked out most of the year last year.  I complained over and over that he looked like he didn't want to be out there.  I think he's gone.
pacers,3azgi6,materhern,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:23:30 2015 UTC,"Uh, i dont know what to say. Im kinda sad."
pacers,3azgi6,h3isenburg,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:54:53 2015 UTC,"West did fantastic work for us, but this is probably the best decision for both parties. We're clearly trying to move on and, in a way, reinvent ourselves. It's hard to imagine doing that with (aging) West and his style of play.   As for West, maybe he's looking for a place where he can maximize his chances of winning a ring. I certainly hope that place isn't Cleveland, but yea.."
pacers,3azks7,Pacers31Colts18,11,Wed Jun 24 19:43:55 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's just me, but David doesn't seem like the type of guy to just leave a team high and dry. He was a fan favorite here and seemed to enjoy his place. I have a feeling West made this decision knowing it's for the betterment of not just himself, but of the Pacers too. What that entails, is impossible to to tell, but there are several possibilities to ponder.   It seemed at the end of the season that, when talking about making the transition to small ball and the subsequent phasing out of Hibbert, Bird seemed to hint at D West starting at center with George at the 4. I don't believe that West would just leave us, knowing full well he was in our immediate future plans. With the draft boards currently calling for us to grab WCS, it must be even more of a certainty now with West opting out. At the very least it seems certain that we're drafting a big forward/center and Payne is off our radar, as I just don't see Lavoy Allen (assuming we re-sign him) as a starting center.   I've been reading a lot lately about the ideas of Monta Ellis or Jeremy Lin coming to Indiana next year. If we acquired one (or both) of these players, we would have no immediate need to draft a guard (Payne) and our focus would be forced to turn on the big gaping hole that is the big man position on our roster.   I don't know about you guys, but I'm really excited about what the offseason holds for us."
pacers,3azks7,mooney2j,5,Wed Jun 24 20:02:08 2015 UTC,I would not be a fan of Jeremy Lin coming to Indiana.
pacers,3azks7,Mudkipz4D,2,Wed Jun 24 20:08:32 2015 UTC,All the Chinese students from IU would pack the house at least a few times.  I don't know if that would be good or bad. I guess more fans isn't a bad things...

pacers,3azks7,iAMtHESushighost,2,Wed Jun 24 20:22:35 2015 UTC,"From what I heard West and Paul sat down together and decided it was for the best for them to leave New Orleans.  The city was wrecked by Katrina and they weren't going anywhere at all, so they asked for trades.  It was back then but no one in the fan base was particularly angry at them for asking trades simply because they felt sorry for their stars.  The oldies would be really happy to have him back if he decides to go back to New Orleans, and I'm perfectly fine with it too."

He even offered to take pay cuts to resign Lance back then and restructured his contract during the 2013 season to let PG take the max.

pacers,3azks7,pacerpower,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:50:44 2015 UTC,"Scola and West had virtually identical numbers this year, so you could imagine Scola taking the starting PF slot, while having a small ball lineup as a backup. That's not terrible, and is more cost effective.  With that, you'd likely want to upgrade the SG spot in our lineup, which would lead to someone like Ellis.  PG: Hill SG: Ellis SF: George PF: Scola C: Hibbert 6th: Stuckey   Does that team make the playoffs? I think so. Does that team defend worse, probably. Scola and Ellis are not elite defenders.  Our 1st round pick likely doesn't contribute much year 1. Looking at our draft picks, I can't find a guy contributing average value in their first year.  I don't love Ellis, but we certainly need scoring, and he can provide that. His 3% is surprisingly bad, which doesn't stretch the floor.. something we absolutely need with 2 big men.   I don't know... I trust Bird will figure it out, but I don't quite see the strategy here."

pacers,3azsts,TweetPoster,2,Wed Jun 24 20:44:08 2015 UTC,I feel like Bird has been blowing a lot of smoke to try and make sure WCS falls to us.  I think that is the guy Bird wants and I personally would love to have him on the team.  Lyles is another option that I wouldn't mind though. He's a good sized player with a lot of potential.  Plus the hometown hero thing could be big. My personal leanings have been towards getting a forward or center in the draft as opposed to a guard.  So if we aren't going to try and get WCS then I'd say Lyles over Payne
pacers,3azsts,MischiefMayhamSoap,2,Thu Jun 25 00:17:03 2015 UTC,"Man so much of this depends on what Hibbert is going to do.  I hate that free agency is after the draft.  Though I think if we get WCS, Hibbert definitely opts out.  I think the writing will be on the wall and he'll get cranky and sad and opt out.    But if Hibbert is staying, then Lyles makes a lot of sense.  We seemlessly replace West with someone who can score and compliment PG13."
pacers,3azsts,materhern,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:00:45 2015 UTC,"I really wish they would change that. I guess I understand a little bit, cause free agency takes up nearly the whole summer, but the majority of players sign right away."

Realistically, I'd love Monta, sign back Stuckey, and draft WCS though for now. Monta gives us the offense we've desperately needed. Although PG will hopefully help next year.   Edit: On a side note, if PG is any good banging down low as a PF, then he'll also probably be the best stretch 4 in the league."
pacers,3b056t,kmikhailov,3,Wed Jun 24 22:25:54 2015 UTC,"I'd be happy with just getting LaMarcus Aldridge. He by himself would make the Pacers an instant contender for the title.   IF we were able to pick him up, I'd be pretty happy. His defense is not amazing, but I really don't care when you pick up a guy that averaged 23.4 ppg last year.  The Trailblazers were interested in Hibbert before this, perhaps they will consider a sign-and-trade?"

pacers,3b056t,Swagboi9,3,Thu Jun 25 01:19:08 2015 UTC,"I'd like us to resign Stuckey, Allen, Sloan, and Whittington. Assuming Larry was serious about Paul playing the 4 next year, we could pick up Ellis, and have the staring five of Hill, Ellis, Hill, George, and WCS/Kaminsky/Turner/FA. We would need to sign a good, traditional 4 that could play off the bench if need be. Someone like David Lee may work. If not him, I'm not sure who else is available.   This would leave us with big money left for 2016 FA, where we could make a big splash."
pacers,3b056t,MischiefMayhamSoap,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:21:56 2015 UTC,"Draft WCS.  I think he is a great fit and I think he has a really high ceiling.  Larry Legend says he could be a max player someday.  Larry doesn't seem like the kind of guy to just throw that out and not mean it.  If not WCS then I'd say Trey Lyles.  Goddammit if I don't love a hometown hero story.  Resign Stuckey, Sloan, and Allen.  If we could also resign Scola that would be nice too.  He has a pretty good veteran presence and now that West is gone that could be useful.  As far as potential free agents go Ellis is the way to go I think.  Guy is a scorer that we could really use.  If not Ellis then maybe if we could get Ty Lawson and maybe move GHill to 2."
pacers,3b056t,Airegus,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:32:10 2015 UTC,First draft WCS. He solidifies our 5 and works playing both big and small because of his athleticism. Resign Stuckey. Sign Monta Ellis for around 10-11mil. Throw big money at Draymond Green. Somewhere around 15mil. I think if the warriors can't get rid of David Lee they aren't going to be able to keep Green. There's a good chance he could be in a new jersey next year imo. With the rest of the cap try to bring in some quality bench players. Veteran leadership would be nice.   In this crazy probably not even close to possible world the starting lineup would be  1: Geroge Hill  2: Monta Ellis  3: Paul George  4: Draymond Green  5: Willie Cauley-Stein  6: Stuckey coming of the bench. (6th man of the year inc!)
pacers,3b056t,aidsfarts,2,Thu Jun 25 03:14:46 2015 UTC,That starting 5 gets me erect
pacers,3b056t,Airegus,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:37:36 2015 UTC,Right? Our defense would be fantastic. 3-4 players that can guard multiple positions. We could completely shut down the pick and role just by switching every pick. The only down side would be 3 point shooting.
pacers,3b056t,MagiClipPaceRaps,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:58:37 2015 UTC,"I strongly desire slipping into an OKC-??? trade that lands us Perry Jones without losing the #11. I don't care what anyone says, he would be perfect alongside PG13 as a 3/4, combo-forward, one-two punch.   Then, with #11, we hopefully draft Willie Cauley-Stein, or trade up easily to get him. Otherwise, we pick Myles Turner (or also likely, Frank Kaminsky). I wouldn't have a problem seeing Trey Lyles picked here, either, as I feel he has similarities to PJ3.   At #43, pending we still have it, I would have us select one of Dakari Johnson, Andrew Harrison, Christian Wood, Rakeem Christmas, Mam Jaiteth, or local favorite Pat Connaughton, if he's still there.  I would also be very interested in trading for Jerian Grant after he's drafted, but I find that this kind of dismantling of the team chemistry to add a group of rookies is kind of bassackwards.    So let's say we pick a big man at #11 (WCS, Turner, Kaminsky), and manage a trade to pick up Perry Jones (for CJ Miles perhaps). Then, we pick up (random) Christian Wood at #43. That's two ""big men"", and a stretch-4 added.   After that, we sign Monta Ellis, signifying him as our new leading scorer/creator. So we've got:  PG. G. Hill  SG. M. Ellis  SF. P. George, S. Hill  PF. P. Jones III, C. Wood  C. W. Cauley-Stein/M. Turner/F. Kaminsky, I. Mahinmi  From there, we still need a reserve combo guard, and one last back-up big man, which is where I would hope Rodney Stuckey and Lavoy Wonder would return. That puts us at:  PG. G. Hill, R. Stuckey  SG. M. Ellis  SF. P. George, S. Hill  PF. P. Jones III, C. Wood  C. #11 Bigman, Lavoy Allen, I. Mahinmi  We would still need a more dependable reserve wing, but I think between Ellis/Stuckey/PG13/Solo/PJ3, they could run the 2-3-4 solidly. Shit, that same lineup (ordered Stuckey/Ellis/Solo/PG13/PJ3) could be a solid shooting squad on the court at the same time."
pacers,3b056t,materhern,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:08:05 2015 UTC,"I really would like to pick up Monta Ellis.  Vogel has shown he can manage volatile personalities in the locker room.  Hibbert is really the moody guy that under performs when he's cranky.  Him being gone would make Ellis a good pickup.  CJ Miles is a role player, he's not a starter.  I'd be more comfortable with CJ and Stuckey coming off the bench.  Hill and Ellis in the front court with PG13 and Lyles at the Forward positions would be sweet. Scola/Mahinmi at Center would allow us to stretch the floor on offense and really create a very good offensive unit.  It would be a complete turn around for us.    If we pick up a WCS instead of Lyles, then you have a defender that was as good at protecting the rim as Hibbert, but can run the floor."
pacers,3ays85,ISUCKATKARMA,2,Wed Jun 24 16:14:26 2015 UTC,"I say rework West's contract to make room now and extend two years after the new salary boom. Backload the contract so he gets a few more years paid maybe a tad more than he's worth to offset the paycut he's taking now.

I believe he was the top scorer on the Western conference play off team last year.   And isn't getting rid of Hibbert a plus by itself? Getting Ellis on top of that would be a huge plus.   Finally, I don't see what's wrong with having both Ellis and Stuckey. It can actually end up being pretty amazing. It doesn't have to be one or the other...Basically, there's no way we can get a better 2 guard than Ellis. We can't afford them or they simply won't come to Indy.   Too many people here LOVE the effing status quo and not changing shit...what are you people so worried about? How about some exciting Pacer basketball?"

They have different options, laptop, mobile & tv what are you looking for?"

There were cheaper options where you could pick a certain number of teams and only have access to those games, but I don't remember whether or not there was a cheaper option for doing something like PC only.  One thing about league pass though is that I love basketball, but I didn't really use it. It was nice looking in at games throughout the season, but I didn't use it that much. The Bulls and the nationally broadcasted games were enough for me. I was hoping that league pass would show games being played on NBA TV because WOW doesn't have that channel, but they don't."

pacers,3auh9x,-thomasjefferson-1,14,Tue Jun 23 16:39:53 2015 UTC,"The Spurs asked us to select Leonard as part of the deal.  We were trading that pick for Hill. An argument could be made that Kawhi wouldn't be the same player in Indiana that he is in San Antonio.  He is allowed to focus on defense and gets buckets based on that system.  That's not to say he's a system player, just that the system and players around him have allowed him to grow into the player that he has become.  One that is perfect for the way Pop and RC want to play."
pacers,3auh9x,SoCarolina,6,Tue Jun 23 17:03:06 2015 UTC,"It's easy to look back now and say Kawhi is better than George Hill. If I could go back in time and take Kawhi instead, I definitely would. Like you said though, at the time we were loaded with swing guys and we really needed a point guard. We built a team that had a shot at a championship with George Hill on it, so I think the trade originally worked out well for both teams.  Also, didn't San Antonio tell us to pick Leonard for that trade? Would the Pacers still have picked him if it weren't for the Spurs trade offer? I don't know."
pacers,3auh9x,T-Thugs,5,Tue Jun 23 16:47:18 2015 UTC,"Ive read an article with bird saying they would have drafted kawhi, wish i fould find it now."
pacers,3auh9x,Sheffield178,6,Tue Jun 23 16:59:58 2015 UTC,"I've never heard Bird say this before, so I did some digging and found it in a Grantland article.    The Pacers swallowed hard and agreed. There was still one problem left: Indiana loved Kawhi Leonard. The Pacers had him about no. 5 or no. 6 on their draft board, and they thought very hard about scrapping the Hill deal and just taking a guy they never expected to be alive at no. 15. “When Kawhi ended up being there, we had to think about taking him,” Morway says. “But we already had Danny Granger and Paul George. That’s what made it a little easier for us.”   There goes the theory that we wouldn't have selected Kawhi anyways, but it doesn't look like that was a high chance considering we had Granger/PG"
pacers,3auh9x,DeepFreezeDisease,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:22:58 2015 UTC,"They would have taken him, but they were so loaded they would've traded either him or Granger who at the time was a different player as well.  He was too valuable at the 15 spot to give up, because even if you didn't particularly need him he was a great trade."
pacers,3auh9x,Herculix,3,Fri Jun 26 03:32:07 2015 UTC,Leonard's PER last year was 22. Hill's was 21.5.  It was a good trade for both teams and still is. The only issue with Hill has always been his massive contract that he got and wasn't being utilized enough to support.  Leonard would have been the THIRD option on our team. You do not draft a guy that high to be your third string player. We simply would not have been able to utilize him properly.
pacers,3auh9x,NateThomas1979,0,Tue Jun 23 18:42:51 2015 UTC,oh come on...Are you really suggesting that Kawhi and Hill are roughly the same quality players because of the PER last year?
pacers,3auh9x,pfc_bgd,3,Tue Jun 23 18:49:19 2015 UTC,No I'm saying last year they performed equally.  Hill's stat line was insane last year.   I am not making a comment on long term success but discussing that they both performed equally last year
pacers,3auh9x,NateThomas1979,-1,Tue Jun 23 18:52:08 2015 UTC,"but you're saying that not only that this was a good trade, but it still is. It was a reasonable trade that definitely didn't work out for the Pacers.   I bet there are exactly 0 GMs in the league who would pick Hill over Kawhi- which basically means that this can no longer be considered a good trade for us."
pacers,3auh9x,pfc_bgd,2,Tue Jun 23 19:04:33 2015 UTC,"You're not picking Leonard over hill.  You're picking Leonard over Paul George.  Those two play the same position.   People suffer from exactly what you are discussing, the lack of perspective that the trade improved both teams in areas that they needed.    At the time of the trade,  granger was starting and George was coming off the bench.  As of now, I still would choose PG over Leonard.  So the idea that the trade is a bad trade is ridiculous because Leonard would be getting CJ Miles type minutes, not the minutes he's getting on the spurs.  As a team,  Hill improves our value drastically.  Just look at the win/loss record of him playing vs.  Injured last year. Would Leonard playing second string benefit us as much with Darren Collison running the point?  That is the real question."
pacers,3auh9x,NateThomas1979,-1,Tue Jun 23 19:12:59 2015 UTC,"oh wow, you seem to be stuck in the ""this guy plays this position"" basketball...Yes, you don't want your center playing a point guard, but you can easily see Kwahi guarding and playing positions 2 and 3 (and 4). Same goes for PG.   Imagine if Kerr was thinking: Oh shit, Iguodala and Barnes play the same position.    Bottom line, a coach that cannot figure out how to play PG and Kwahi effectively together has no business coaching in the NBA."
pacers,3auh9x,pfc_bgd,2,Tue Jun 23 19:31:51 2015 UTC,"But it wasn't PG and Kawhi, it's PG, Danny Granger, AND Kawhi at the time."
pacers,3auh9x,iAMtHESushighost,-1,Tue Jun 23 20:12:50 2015 UTC,"but...as I said in the other post, I am not blaming anyone for making the trade when they made it. I understand why it happened, and it makes sense.   But I am looking at the present...Kawhi or Hill on our current roster. Any doubt?"
pacers,3auh9x,pfc_bgd,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:18:30 2015 UTC,I would rather have one less superstar that probably wouldn't work out than a gaping hole at point guard because Kawhi isn't a sure thing at all with us but George Hill is.
pacers,3auh9x,iAMtHESushighost,-1,Tue Jun 23 20:33:08 2015 UTC,"yes, finals MVP isn't a proven thing but Hill is. That doesn't make any sense.   As for ""not a sure thing at all with us"", emphasis on us...I cannot think of a more selfless player than Kawhi who does everything for a team. He can fit anywhere, us included. He by no means acts like or demands the ball like a superstar."
pacers,3auh9x,pfc_bgd,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:36:20 2015 UTC,"Again,  adding Hill fixed our issues with ball handling as well as gave us a stronger defensive minded team.   It's simply revisionist history to say the trade was horrible then and it's ignorant for people to call it bad now when the difference between Hill and Watson/Augustin/Sloan/Hansbrough/Collison/etc has been night and day.   Yes it would be nice to have both,  but adding Hill fixed a major problem in our roster.  The issue with Hill has always been contractual,  not benefit to the team.  His value to the team again is shown in the w/l percentage of him on the court and off of it. I will have to look it up again but it's somewhere in the +20% range.  From 34% to 50 something."
pacers,3auh9x,NateThomas1979,-1,Tue Jun 23 19:55:16 2015 UTC,"Hill gave us a stronger defensive minded team? As in, Hill is a good defender? Pfff...But if you do think that, imagine what Kwahi would have done.   Hill didn't fix our issues with ball handling up until this year...let's hope he continues to play this way. But, why would you think that we wouldn't be looking for a starting point guard if Hill wasn't around? This league is LOADED on good point guards, I doubt we would have struggled too long to find a good PG (especially if we were to pay him as much as we pay Hill)."
pacers,3auh9x,pfc_bgd,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:04:54 2015 UTC,"Now we're getting somewhere.  I realize our difference.   I don't believe the league has too many quality guards.  I think there is a lot of serviceable guys,  but the point is such a weak position for me.  I think that the difference stems from my belief that not having Hill creates a void that is filled by a top 20-30 pg in the league.   I just think that any truly valuable pg is locked into their team and not having Hill would mean we'd be stuck with Ben Hansbrough and DJ Augustin level players."
pacers,3auh9x,NateThomas1979,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:11:41 2015 UTC,"point guard position is currently weak? where to start? in no particular order: kyrie, dragic, wall, lowry, teague, curry, westbrook, cp3, lillard, conley, parker, rose..I honestly don't think the NBA ever had such an explosive group of point guards at the same time (while admitting the position has changed quite a bit).   As for point guards being locked into their current teams...I dunno, that sounds fair, but there are example of good point guards changing teams (most recently dragic and thomas)."
pacers,3auh9x,pfc_bgd,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:28:50 2015 UTC,"It happened. Can't take it back. Hill suffered through a rough patch when he had to share the floor with Lance but when he was allowed to be the ball handler of the team he played with much more enthusiasm and heart.   Kawhi wouldn't be the same player here as he was in San Antonio, it's a different system. However I have no doubt he would have impressed everyone here. Now if he goes on to be a Hall of Fame player I may have a different outlook but as for right now I'm ok with the trade."
pacers,3auh9x,DPLaVay,2,Tue Jun 23 19:11:17 2015 UTC,"Lance killed Hills confidence. If you look at his stats the years before and after lance's borderline all star season, he has been a pretty good player."
pacers,3auh9x,scottw5150,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:50:29 2015 UTC,"Man it's not we drafted Kawhi for ourselves and made that trade. We drafted him because the Spurs wanted him.   I'll take Kevin Durant's words after last yr's NBA finals (doesn't mean I agree with everything he says, but just as a reference point): the Spurs were a better team and they won the championship, Kawhi played great in their system offensively and did a good job guarding LeBron, but if you put Paul George out there in the Spurs, he'd do better than Kawhi."
pacers,3auh9x,RoddickAndy,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:57:28 2015 UTC,"We had Paul George and Danny Granger at the time, no way Kawhi does anything for us, it worked out on both ends and honestly, had we played Kawhi more, it might've even affected Paul George making him not the same player also, or one getting frustrated and leaving."
pacers,3auh9x,iAMtHESushighost,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:10:45 2015 UTC,"Seeing where Leonard is now, it seems like a stupid trade. But, the way the Pacers were built, they really needed some players who have won to come in and set a tone. Hill and West both did that for the Pacers, and we went to the ECF 2 times because of them.  Without the George Hill trade, we would have been stuck with Darren Collison long term. I'll continue to say it was a win-win trade for both teams. Nobody could have predicted what happened to Granger. We thought we were set at the 2 and 3 spot for a while with Granger and PG. Didn't happen."
pacers,3auh9x,Pacers31Colts18,-1,Tue Jun 23 21:04:38 2015 UTC,"More than satisfied with what? With having Hill over Kawhi? That's just silly.   That being said, hindsight is 20/20, so I don't blame our front office."
pacers,3aveil,Airegus,6,Tue Jun 23 20:31:58 2015 UTC,"I really don't know why he hasn't made his decision (public?) yet. I guess the main reason is that he doesn't have to...he can sit and wait and see if some unlikely option opens up.   He may also be waiting to see who the Pacers get in the draft...If we somehow land WCS, that'll be a strong signal to Hibbs that his minutes will go down drastically (and therefore his chance to improve his status in the NBA and land a decent contract after next year).   I also don't think he's holding us hostage...I believe that our front office has already given up on Hibbert and is planning our future without him. It would be a plus if we were to leave this year because of money, but there's nothing they can do about that."
pacers,3aveil,pfc_bgd,4,Tue Jun 23 20:57:22 2015 UTC,"I hope I'm wrong about this, but given the way the front office trashed him in the media after the season ended (perhaps justifiably), then I wouldn't be surprised if this isn't just a big ""fuck you"" from Hibbert.  That being said, I would be astonished if Hibbert, a guy with a very uncertain future in the NBA, walks away from $15 million. Not happening."
pacers,3aveil,Einsteiniac,2,Wed Jun 24 00:57:09 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, I think theres very slim chance he opts out, and theres no chance he gets resigned with the team when his contract is up (barring a miraculous turnaround season.)

pacers,3aveil,allaboutbennys,2,Wed Jun 24 03:02:10 2015 UTC,Do you really think Boston would take Hibbert? LOL Boston wants Noel an athletic big man the complete opposite of Hibbert.
pacers,3aveil,MC_Carty,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:45:34 2015 UTC,"No I don't think Boston would take him but if they offered a deal to let's say Denver for example, we could offer Denver Hibbert instead. Ideally they would take Hibbert over whoever the Celtics offered and we can move up effectly blocking the Celtics trade."
pacers,3ar2s4,btirumala,18,Mon Jun 22 20:41:31 2015 UTC,"Lol, he's 5x more athletic than Hibbert. WCS was a track star in high school and can run up and down the court faster than nearly any other player at his position. In addition to his good vertical and relatively good ball handling, I think he has a higher ceiling than most players in the draft.   IMO, he's one of the best centers in the fast break  While Hibbert and WCS are comparable in their superb defensive play, WCS still has some work to do on the offensive end. He's got a pretty reliable midrange game, and his post game could use some work but they say defense is harder to teach than offense.   So I think WCS is more like DeAndre Jordan than Hibbert."
pacers,3ar2s4,-thomasjefferson-1,6,Mon Jun 22 21:21:01 2015 UTC,He was also a 7' wide receiver with a college scholarship to Kansas and even played some cornerback as well - arguably 2 of the most athletic positions in football
pacers,3ar2s4,Airgelo,2,Tue Jun 23 05:01:39 2015 UTC,Yeah his wide receiver skills definitely show He's exactly what we need. Pacers fans need to realize that without Paul George we were one of the most unathletic Indiana teams I've ever seen. For example That's embarrassing. WCS could help change that... Along with the return of PG :)
pacers,3ar2s4,-thomasjefferson-1,2,Tue Jun 23 17:03:59 2015 UTC,"this was an interesting, well-written article by him saying that he is more than just a one-dimensional, defensive player but he is labeled as one because he had to accept his role playing along side a lot of McDonald's all-Americans and potential NBA draftees and that he grew up admiring guys like melo, KD, CP3, etc and their play styles as opposed to big men like Shaq"
pacers,3ar2s4,Airgelo,2,Tue Jun 23 17:14:32 2015 UTC,"4.6 40, and I heard he's run even faster than that. Fuck. He'd be a GOAT WR with his size and athletic ability."
pacers,3ar2s4,playalisticadillac,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:27:47 2015 UTC,He also put on 20 lbs of muscle and 5 inches to his already freakish-for-7-footer 37-inch vertical...he wouldn't even need to be fast he would just catch over defenders like Calvin Johnson but 7-inches taller...according to his article that he posted on player tribune (see previous post).   He went with basketball though because of a potentially longer career and less stress on the body. Smart move.
pacers,3ar2s4,Airgelo,5,Wed Jun 24 16:09:46 2015 UTC,"Recently (and while I hate to admit it because I'm a die-hard IU fan) Kentucky Centers have had a knack for starting and contributing right away on NBA rosters. DeMarcus Cousins, Anthony Davis, and Nerlens Noel are 3 guys that played at the 5 spot at that school in the past 5 years and I think with Cauley-Stein, I wholeheartedly believe that trend will continue in Pacers yellow!"
pacers,3ar2s4,ls215,8,Tue Jun 23 01:14:24 2015 UTC,Hibbert is an oaf whereas WCS is super quick for a 5.
pacers,3ar2s4,impossiber,4,Mon Jun 22 21:14:46 2015 UTC,Yeah the two players really aren't comparable
pacers,3ar2s4,-thomasjefferson-1,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:23:31 2015 UTC,I do not use the word oaf enough. That is for sure.
pacers,3ar2s4,teamretard_,3,Tue Jun 23 06:33:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not even sure the league has ever seen a defensive player quite like WCS. A 5 who can smother 1 and 2's after switching on a p&r. But that said, I'd still have reservations about the Pacers drafting him because his offensive game is a work in progress to say the least. I think best case scenario, you're looking at a guy who like Deandre or Chandler is only capable of scoring while catching lobs or throwing down putbacks. I don't see any sort of face-up jumpers in his future. But still, a lineup of WCS(5), PG (4), Miles (3), Stuckey (2), and G. Hill (1), is an amazing defensive team. I think I just changed my mind lol. No reservations!"
pacers,3ar2s4,writebrite,3,Mon Jun 22 21:36:51 2015 UTC,PG wouldn't start at the 4 tho
pacers,3ar2s4,Shepherdsfavestore,2,Mon Jun 22 22:07:49 2015 UTC,Yeah we still have David West to start at PF and I don't see him going anywhere.

pacers,3ar2s4,pfc_bgd,2,Tue Jun 23 00:07:08 2015 UTC,"WCS is a DeAndre Jordan that can hit free throws. He's super quick and agile for his size. That is what does it for me, he fits perfectly for the more up tempo style Bird and Vogel want to play next year. I'll admit he could gain a bit of muscle mass. As it is I could see him getting pushed around by bigger centers. Honestly we don't need a scoring machine at the 5. We just need someone who is a solid defender, actually goes hard for rebounds, and can finish around the rim off of a quick pass or lob. He does all of those, and he does them well."
pacers,3ar2s4,Airegus,2,Mon Jun 22 23:05:06 2015 UTC,He can still fall to us without needing to trade...
pacers,3ar2s4,MC_Carty,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:53:08 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, there's a lot of reports talking about his recent foot problem and that could scare some early lottery teams in the other direction."
pacers,3ar2s4,-thomasjefferson-1,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:42:22 2015 UTC,Hibbert developed into a talent.  He couldn't even do a push up at one point.  WCS was born an athletic talent.  He will be our athletic big that allows to play fast without losing all of our rim protection. That is the source of the hype.  I hope we get this dude.

Lol he played off the bench last season and after starting a few games, he asked Vogel to have him come off the bench because that's what he preferred. In fact I'm pretty sure he had that crazy 30 point game stretch when he returned to the bench. He really is a great addition to this team. Not many guys want to come off the bench"

pacers,3anznc,Pacers31Colts18,5,Mon Jun 22 02:06:36 2015 UTC,Wouldn't mind Myles Turner. I think he could be a real difference maker in a year or two
pacers,3anznc,blackxhawk69,4,Mon Jun 22 20:09:05 2015 UTC,"My ideal draft would be WCS. I have this weird feeling that he will actually drop to us. I haven't heard much talk of him recently, I hope that means his stock is dropping a bit. Though I could see it being a few teams trying to hype other players to get WCS to drop to them.   If not WCS I think we will end up with Payne. I'm completely fine with Payne. I think he has the potential to be an elite point guard."
pacers,3anznc,Airegus,3,Mon Jun 22 04:00:38 2015 UTC,"Agreed. As a fan, I want to see us take one of these two. My 3rd choice would be Frank, solely because he could contribute now and later with consistency.   As Frank says, he may not have the potential others do, but he starts higher than many players in his position over skill wise."
pacers,3anznc,Anicole2196,3,Mon Jun 22 04:28:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not so high on him. I honestly think his potential is higher than a few others slated go around him, notably Turner. I think frank COULD be really good. It's rare to find a big man with a stroke as good as his. I just really don't like his defensive and other than being a spot up shooter is offensive is weak. He's medium reward high risk imo."
pacers,3anznc,Airegus,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:26:20 2015 UTC,Draft express has us taking him.  I'm calling BS because I can't see it happening but apparently other teams are concerned about his injuries.

They have a lot of holes to fill so I could see them not taking a big. I doubt the heat would, they seem to be fine at the 4 and 5 especially with a healthy Bosh coming back. I was worried about the Hornets taking him but with the lance trade I think they will opt to draft a wing player."

Personally (if WCS isn't available at 11), I'd like to see a trade-down (e.g. Celtics 16 + 28 for the 11), so they could get someone like Trey Lyles and some wing depth.  Pacers need youth and depth, and there's still some potential talent that will be around at the end of the 1st."

pacers,3anznc,herrkaizer87,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:33:57 2015 UTC,"To...what?  Trading down/drafting Lyles/something else?  Believe me, I'd love Cauley-Stein as a future star prospect and an immediate lock-down pick-and-roll defender (which Hibbert is pretty bad at), but I just don't see why the Kings, Hornets, and Heat would all pass on him, since he would compliment all of their big men (and because Hassan Whiteside is probably still a ticking time bomb).    If its not drafting Turner, I don't love his future compared to being able to draft down and still get a top PF prospect plus some wing depth that can develop, preferably if its shooting depth to compliment the Pacers overall lack of 3-point shooting (17th in makes, 18th in attempts).  Big men who run awkwardly don't usually have long futures in the league, and I'm not sure if you can ever really train a running gait out of you, even though Turner has been trying this offseason."

I understand making a few to send to him to prove a point, but 200 makes no sense.   Why would they do this so far in advance?

pacers,3ae7qn,yobramine,4,Fri Jun 19 14:36:19 2015 UTC,Sure.
pacers,3ae7qn,Anicole2196,3,Fri Jun 19 15:58:08 2015 UTC,We need to have something other than boomerbot be our top post this year.  Also is anyone else excited to see Lance in LA?  I really liked him despite all the shenanigans and I am happy he's playing somewhere he has a chance to thrive.
pacers,3ae7qn,exWarlock,4,Fri Jun 19 12:41:55 2015 UTC,I think LA will be a much better fit for Lance. This is the best thing for his career.
pacers,3ae7qn,_disguised_toast_,4,Fri Jun 19 13:04:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think Lance is gonna thrive there. It's a city that never sleeps, and he is a crazy dude off the court. Similar to the J.R. Smith constant shenanigans off the court. Lance needed to stay in a small market to focus solely on the game and a better lifestyle"
pacers,3ae7qn,IMightBeMistaken,6,Fri Jun 19 16:43:57 2015 UTC,"Lance is from Coney Island/Brooklyn, the dude could find shenanigans in an empty cardboard box. I think Doc Rivers is going to be a huge influence on him, and I agree that his career is about to flourish into something magical."
pacers,3ae7qn,IMightBeMistaken,5,Fri Jun 19 16:51:19 2015 UTC,Agreed. He has a coach that will get the best out of him. I just want to know of the Born Ready wall mural will be done in his new place too.

I really, really, really hope this kid is what he seems to be. Having a superstar type player play for our team will be watching Reggie all over again.    LET'S GO BABY, LET'S GET THAT FUCKING RING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
pacers,3ae7qn,exWarlock,2,Fri Jun 19 20:14:01 2015 UTC,"I'm excited for the draft for the whole NBA! The field is very vague outside of the top two picks and there are even rumors of the Lakers not selecting Okafor.   Also, I've seen about 5-8 different prospects on the board for the Pacers in different mock drafts. That's crazy! I'm honestly hoping for Devin Booker, even as a Kentucky hater. Although, I think Charlotte takes him after trading Stephenson."
pacers,3ae7qn,ThadAllen18,2,Fri Jun 19 12:52:10 2015 UTC,"Also, I think we should take the best player available at #11, which I think would be Payne, Booker, WCS (probably won't slide). We need backups at pretty much every position and West and Hibbert will opt in. We still have another year until we can transition into a smaller, faster team. I think would be easier grabbing a few proven free agents next offseason that fit what we're trying to do, rather than grab a big like Kaminsky or Miles and HOPE they become what we want.  TL;DR Take the best player available, Bird!"
pacers,3ae7qn,exWarlock,2,Fri Jun 19 12:58:00 2015 UTC,"What are your guys thoughts on Lavoy? I liked him as a Pacer, even though he had very limited minutes."
pacers,3ae7qn,ThadAllen18,3,Fri Jun 19 15:34:23 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of Lavoy Wonder. He moves up and down the court, he's defensively-minded, he just needs a bit more freedom to mesh with the chemistry more.   I say we draft a big man, and continue to give Lavoy big minutes off the bench. Especially if we trade Hibbert for someone."
pacers,3ae7qn,exWarlock,2,Fri Jun 19 16:54:28 2015 UTC,"Love that nickname! I agree with everything you said. I think that if he gets more minutes, our already awesome rebounding will get much better with his multiple offensive boards."

pacers,3ae7qn,greenstreetchipotle,2,Sun Jun 21 05:43:49 2015 UTC,I liked how he played in spurts for sure.  Only real problem was the logjam in front of him on the depth chart with Hibbert/Mahinmi at C and West/Scola at PF.  Tough to argue with giving those guys less minutes but it seems like Frank does like what he sees with Allen and I think we could see him continuing to make contributions.
pacers,3ab0b7,Saxophonekid,7,Thu Jun 18 17:15:42 2015 UTC,"Get PG back. Boom done.  In all seriousness, we really need to keep contending in the future whether it be Finals or ECF.  Fans started coming in when we started winning games and getting attention before PG went down.  I imagine that the fans will come back once we start the 2016 season with our brand new, shiny sidekick star besides PG.  And don't wish that evil on the colts."
pacers,3ab0b7,ISUCKATKARMA,2,Thu Jun 18 17:36:24 2015 UTC,"2016 season with our brand new, shiny sidekick star besides PG.   This is the part I like the most."
pacers,3ab0b7,exWarlock,12,Sat Jun 20 17:00:39 2015 UTC,"Well, what fills up the arenas faster than anything else is having a superstar on the team. So, the quickest way is for PG to become a true superstar.   Also, I feel like the Pacers games are more about family friendly entertainment than basketball to the point that everything happening at the games is super vanilla. I really have no clue what I'd do differently, but there's something off if it's much easier to get really into the game when watching it at home than at the arena.    And finally, we're not really playing the most exciting basketball out there. Let's face it, if you weren't a Pacer fan and PG wasn't on the floor, there isn't much to watch. We don't move the ball, we don't have any snipers, we don't run, and so on...  Edit. Oh yeah, as somebody who isn't originally from Indiana, I noticed the the people from around here aren't exactly the most excitable or crazy bunch."
pacers,3ab0b7,pfc_bgd,12,Thu Jun 18 19:13:16 2015 UTC,"Indiana fans in general I found to be very fair weather when it came to professional teams when I lived there. For evidence, look when the pacers started doing well in the playoffs. Bankers life was repeatedly sold out. Also, remember that one season the Colts were bad after they got rid of Peyton? Lucas oil was a ghost town. They just need to start winning and the fans will come back."
pacers,3ab0b7,dirtydan1114,13,Thu Jun 18 17:51:57 2015 UTC,Spot on...although I justify nobody wanting to watch Curtis Painter try to be a quarterback.

pacers,3ab0b7,DPLaVay,2,Thu Jun 18 19:18:15 2015 UTC,"On the one hand, I love that it happened that way, because I was able to get season tickets straight put of school. But on the other, I hate that it's clear evidence of our fair weather nature."
pacers,3ab0b7,Jinno,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:01:30 2015 UTC,"Lucas Oil sold out every game that season, I went to the first game they won. It was quiet but, full so idk what you're talking about. Any pro sports team that isn't the Packers, maple leafs, or Lakers is going to have an empty stadium if they are shitty. Hell, I went to a clippers game when they led the western conference and on a winning streak and it was like 70% full and dead quiet. If Paul George becomes a superstar or even just a star along with some new, consistent talent I think the Pacers attendance would rise dramatically."
pacers,3ab0b7,aidsfarts,3,Sat Jun 20 06:12:39 2015 UTC,"In my opinion? The crowd is watered down because people buy season tickets just to let their spoiled teenagers run around at the games.   Down vote me if you want but I've witnessed it firsthand. I grew up feeling privileged to catch some of the great playoff games against the Knicks and other ""unimportant"" games at MSA up in the nosebleeds. Atmosphere was great, one of the best. Yeah, it was a different era, sure.   Now that im and adult and have sat close to the floor on several occasions it just seems like a substitute for a daycare. Shit tons of teenagers just kinda roaming around socializing. I know this isn't the main reason but it has not gone unnoticed by me.   TL:DWR - seems like we don't have passionate season ticket holders."

pacers,3ab0b7,exWarlock,5,Sat Jun 20 17:03:11 2015 UTC,"Outside of this season, ticket prices went up each year Paul is in the league (ie, when they weren't sucking). This year was rough, I think the bad start did a lot of people in from not coming. Usually after the Colts season, attendance rises a bit. I think we were in the middle of a horrible run right after the season. We picked up towards the end of the season, but then trailed back off.  TL;DR: Have a good team."

pacers,3ab0b7,Pacers31Colts18,2,Thu Jun 18 20:19:00 2015 UTC,"I have noticed a few things... I go to games often, being a fan from the Indy area.   I see a lot of younger fans. 18-30's. But past that, there aren't many. I feel the older fans were drawn away by the brawl. This being said, I think as time goes on, we will get more younger fans as the current fan base grows up because of the PG era. Kids love PG since he is a top 10 player. We all know kids are often fair weather fans too, so if we make a few good playoff runs out fan base in general will grow. Yes a championship would be a quick fix, but I think the colts will always have their consistent fan base."
pacers,3ab0b7,Anicole2196,2,Thu Jun 18 17:43:33 2015 UTC,"I'm an old(er) fan, and this certainly isn't true for me. I've never jumped off the band wagon, but I've certainly gotten tired of certain players (ahem...Roy) mailing it in when it counts. The Pacers need more competitiveness in MHO. PG will help OBV, and George Hill looked much better when he was healthy last season, but most of the rest of the team just looked like they were putting in their minutes (excluding Scola here, and David West played hard, but looked used up by the end of the season). Larry Legend was a great player, and a fair coach, but I still have my doubts about him as a judge of talent."
pacers,3ab0b7,2600forlife,3,Fri Jun 19 08:03:39 2015 UTC,"we really need to stop using the brawl as an excuse...Whoever is still holding the brawl against these current Pacers has a serious problem in his/her head.

Don't get me wrong, I'm a Cubs fan, but there's a culture there that has been built since the early 1900's and late 1800's. The ""Lovable Losers"" and the classic feel of Wrigley. Plus, there's the enchantment of a possible first title in 100+ years. Last time we won was 4 year before the Titanic sank. Pacers have been relevant WAY more recently than that, so fans are turned off right now. Especially since Indiana is considered the birthplace of basketball and is considered a basketball state. Not saying that SHOULD BE the case, just why I think that IS the case."

I really feel like most teams that have a better following are teams in large markets or with serious championship history.  I currently live near Charlotte and I go to their games and Bankers Life is basically the Mecca of Basketball compared to a home game for the hornets.    We have a sweet history, a winning culture, and great players.  We make a profit for our owner and are in no danger financially. I could give a shit if people don't want to come see that team."

pacers,3a7xi9,MC_Carty,3,Thu Jun 18 04:36:03 2015 UTC,"Kelly Oubre, G/F, Kansas   The Celtics, as we said, are trying to move up in the draft. But if they stay at 16 and both Oubre and Lyles are on the board, they're in very good shape. Both players could fit a need and I'm not sure which player the Celtics would take. Oubre is here because, in many ways, his upside is the highest, both as a defender and as an offensive player. He's shown more maturity of late and if Boston believe he'll work, he's worth the risk. Two dark horses to watch - Hollis-Jefferson and Rashad Vaughn.   Trey Lyles, PF, Kentucky   Lyles is getting looks from teams as high as the Pistons at 8. No one is sure quite what to make of him after he played out of position all year at Kentucky. Everyone likes him. I'm just not sure anyone is in love with him. With Ilyasova now out of the mix, the Bucks will have a little more playing time for a player like Lyles. While the Bucks bigger needs are at center and shooting guard, Lyles's talent will make him tough to pass at this spot. Sometimes you just have to take the best prospect left on the board.   (via New Orleans) Tyus Jones, PG, Duke   Jones hurt his back in a workout with the Rockets and hasn't worked out since. While the injury may be legitimate, rival GMs have whispered that the Rockets may have shut him down. He's an analytics darling, fits a major need, and has a lot of momentum after winning a National Championship. Jerian Grant, Delon Wright and Terry Rozier are other players the Rockets like.   Kevon Looney, F, UCLA   As I wrote two weeks ago, the Wizards are hoping that one of the three young power forwards - Portis, Lyles or Looney - falls to them at 19. That's their major area of need going forward and all three players are young and still have upside. Of the three, Looney has the most. He's incredibly long, a terrific offensive rebounder and very skilled. He's also the furthest away of the three and questions about a hip he injured before his freshman season at UCLA and a form of sports asthma have caused his stock to slip from the mid-lottery to here. He's worked out well recently, however, and if teams can get comfortable with the hip (the asthma thing doesn't seem to worry anyone), he could end up going as high as the Heat at No. 10.   Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, G/F, Arizona   Hollis-Jefferson is rising. A number of teams in the teens have told me he's now in the mix after terrific workouts. Yes, his shot is broken, but many teams see him as an elite defender and slasher and feel he'll find a niche in the league. And if his shot starts falling, he could be a star. Grant and Vaughn are two other guards that could fill a similar role in Toronto.   Jerian Grant, G, Notre Dame   Just about everyone in the league is penciling in a point guard for the Mavs. Rajon Rondo is likely leaving and J.J. Barea is a free agent. They need help. Grant is one of the most NBA ready point guards in the draft, is terrific in the pick-and-roll, can swing to the two when you need him and plays with incredible fire. He could go as high as 14 to the Thunder, but if he's here, he'll be tough to pass on. Vaughn, Hunter and Wright are other options for Dallas.   Rashad Vaughn, SG, UNLV   The Bulls are always looking for shooting and Vaughn can really fill it up. Some teams also feel he can play some back-up point guard in a pinch. He's received interest from the Celtics, Bucks, Raptors and Mavericks, but could end up being here at 22. Very few players his age can score the way he can. Hunter, Wright and Justin Anderson could also hear their name called by Chicago.   R.J. Hunter, SG, Georgia State   Hunter is one of those love him or hate him type prospects. Teams that love him point to his terrific shooting and passing ability. Teams that hate him think he's soft and will get killed on defense. He has teams as high as the Hornets at nine who really like him. But I could also see him sliding to around here. It would be tough for the Blazers to pass on him, however, with Wesley Matthews heading into free agency.   Delon Wright, PG, Utah   With Kyrie Irving out, Matthew Dellavadova has played admirably (and sometimes great) in his absence. But the Cavs could always use depth at the point position and Wright has the chops to provide it right away. He's an excellent, pass-first point guard who, if he can continue to improve his jumper, could be a terrific NBA back-up. Anderson and Rozier are other good candidates at No. 24.   Justin Anderson, G/F, Virginia   Anderson is another guy that's been tough to peg. Teams in the teens like the Bucks and teams in the early 20s like the Raptors and Bulls are interested. At this point, he's a steal, especially if you believe his 3-point shooting wasn't a fluke this year. And the truth is, the depth of the draft really starts to fall off here. The Grizzlies could use more shooting and Anderson is probably the best shooter left on the board.   Montrezl Harrell, PF, Louisville   Harrell has explosive athleticism and is tough, but his lack of focus has scared some teams off. The Spurs are the right sort of culture to nurture his strengths and minimize his weaknesses. They definitely could use some back-up help at the four.   (via Houston) Joseph Young, G, Oregon   If the Lakers take Okafor or Towns with their first pick, I expect they'll look at guard with their second one. The Lakers had great success with Jordan Clarkson last year and I think they could have similar success taking a chance on Young here. I believe both guards could play together in the backcourt because of Clarkson's size at the one. Young brings something to the table that the Lakers desperately need: shooting. And the fact that he hasn't worked out since the Combine is suspicious. Multiple sources believe that a team in the late first round made him a promise in exchange for not working out for other teams. While I have no idea if that's LA or not, he is a good get at 27.   (via L.A. Clippers) Jarell Martin, F, LSU   One of the reasons Danny Ainge can roll the dice on a wing like Oubre is that there are several interesting forwards who will be available later in the draft. Martin is especially intriguing. He's skilled, a very good athlete, and he has an NBA body. He's just a bit of a tweener. But if he focuses on rebounding and toughness, he'd give the Celtics so much needed athleticism to their front court.   (via Atlanta) Chris McCullough, F, Syracuse   McCullough tore his ACL and will likely miss most of the NBA season. But there is lottery talent there and given the Nets's atrocious draft pick situation in the coming years, they need to take a half court heave here and hope, when healthy, McCullough can live up to his raw potential.   Anthony Brown, G/F, Stanford   The Warriors, believe it or not, are looking for more shooting in their backcourt. When Steph Curry or Klay Thompson sit, they'd like someone who could come in and make open shots. Brown shot 45 percent from three as a junior and 44 percent this season, and has very good size for his position."

pacers,39xxtz,NateThomas1979,4,Mon Jun 15 19:36:20 2015 UTC,"The idea that we need a point over a big is ridiculous. Hill may not be worth his contract year-by-year but he's still very serviceable which means that we're looking for a back up PG in comparison to the current tragedy that is Hibbert and the aging David West.  When you have multiple issues, you play triage. Looking at our team our biggest flaw is mobility/range of our bigs. Watson/Hill are not the best, but are decent enough to be able to bring in a 2nd round draft pick and try to develop him into a backup PG. But we cannot have another year of not being effective in the 4/5 position.  I honestly don't care who it is we pick up, as long as it is a big man that can make an immediate impact with PG. West is gone after this year, so probably is Hibbert. Do we really want to chase a championship with Allen/Mahinmi/Whittington as our bigs?"
pacers,39xxtz,MagiClipPaceRaps,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:10:34 2015 UTC,"From Bird's recent comments, it sounds like he isn't really seeing Watson return next year, so we are looking at Hill, Sloan, and Stuckey.    Do we really want to chase a championship with Allen/Mahinmi/Whittington as our bigs?   Fuck no. I'm ok* with Kaminsky, but I'd much prefer Myles Turner."
pacers,39xxtz,NateThomas1979,3,Tue Jun 16 00:38:47 2015 UTC,"I'd rather not take Turner only because he's so high risk/high reward but I'd take him over Payne in a heartbeat.  Even losing Watson, our offense is not predicated upon our pg. I do want a 'floor general' and I want to see us have someone to help Hill out with creating movement in the offense, but the idea that it is our biggest issue when our starting pg was 21.5 PER (which puts him in the top 25 players had he played an extra 3 more games) is just ridiculous.   Roy is mentally somewhere and we don't know what Roy we get each night. West is old and can't play the minutes necessary. Allen is serviceable but I don't see him ever becoming more than a 10-15 min/night player. Ian? Not a starting center. Love his hustle, but skills wise he's a bit lacking.  We need a 4/5. It'd be awesome to have a stretch 4/5 as well. If we can pull the other team's big outside the lane, our offense would improve dramatically."
pacers,39xxtz,NateThomas1979,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:10:59 2015 UTC,"Well Watson is a free agent who Bird has said won't be back.  Yes, West/Hibbert are free agents after next year, but we can also get some guys via free agency.  All I am saying is keep your options open and take whoever is best. We could easily take Payne and either have him backup Hill for 1-2 years and then replace him, or they could play together if Payne develops."
pacers,39xxtz,Aleph_Alpha_001,2,Tue Jun 16 12:15:48 2015 UTC,"You're right, I just worry that we take a PG and end up being the Heat of last year who had a great guard lineup but without a quality big man they just got run over."
pacers,39xxtz,NateThomas1979,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:57:21 2015 UTC,"I think that your post has some merit, but I've been watching the Pacers a long time, and we have never had a really good point guard in my opinion. You could argue that Mark Jackson was as good point guard, but he lacked speed.  That fact had left a lot of possessions on the floor, and it's sometimes made the Pacers hard to watch.  I would like to see a good pass-first point in an Indiana uniform."
pacers,39xxtz,hectorzeroni69,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:49:55 2015 UTC,"We've never had a top5(?) PG during their play here sure. I think that we've had solid play from Travis Best, Jackson, Collison, even as much as I hate to admit it Jamaal ""Pothead"" Tinsley has played well here. Fred Hoiberg played here too! (just mentioning that as I liked him as a player, he was definitely not top tier)  We've also had players that have gone on to do good things too. Byron Scott, Jarrett Jack, and I believe AJ Price will do great things for another team out there someplace.  I too would like to see a good pass-first point, but to me it doesn't matter if you have that if you don't solidify the 5 first. We aren't the Warriors who all can shoot lights out all over the court. But this is the way the game is progressing into a stretch the opponent and create opportunities through double teams/picks&rolls.  I get that a good PG would be great, but if the PG is tossing the ball to Hibbert in the center, it really doesn't matter if we have CP3/Jeff Teague/etc. The guy receiving the ball still has to hit the shot.  I just think we solidify the point in the 2nd round. I think that Hill showed this last year his ability to score and create offense, but when he was out and it was Sloan running the offense, we suddenly stagnated hard. Getting a PG would be great to help mobilize our players, but we still have to make our shots."
pacers,39xxtz,materhern,3,Wed Jun 17 16:27:45 2015 UTC,I would be okay with Payne or Kaminsky.  Dont really want Turner.

pacers,39s958,Ub3rpwnag3,3,Sun Jun 14 11:56:31 2015 UTC,"You're not the only one, as I'm sure you'll soon discover.   Kaminsky looks like he has ""bust"" written all over him. He also might not; but I'm just worried about the risk involved, as it is with any mid-lottery pick.   I have faith that the Pacers will pick the right person in this draft, and that person will contribute 100% into next year's plans. There really isn't a position we couldn't use a player at (seeing as how Paul could play SG-PF in certain rotations)."
pacers,39s958,exWarlock,2,Sun Jun 14 07:32:08 2015 UTC,"The reason I still like Kaminksky is because of his BB IQ.  Even if he doesn't improve significantly on either end of the floor, he'll still be able to help facilitate the offense from a position that we haven't seen since Brad Miller.  Mahinmi and Allen are solid passers, but when on the floor with a backup PG they provide little to keep the offense flowing.  I'm not saying he's my first choice, but getting a guy with a high floor in terms of offensive cohesion at #11 would still be a very good pick."
pacers,39s958,typs,2,Sun Jun 14 15:28:10 2015 UTC,"He reminds me of a great utility player, someone like Nick Collison on the Thunder or Battier when he was on the Heat. The Pacers could use a hustle guy like that."

But there's no way ALL of the players, who any of us want to see in the blueandgold, are gone by the #11. So all I can say is that, there will still be chances to fuck up this pick; even if we pick Kaminsky, Bird & Co. had to see something impressive enough. The only way I'll be supremely disappointed is if we honest-to-God select Hezonja or some other foreign no-name as high as #11.

pacers,39rnqh,Pacers31Colts18,2,Sun Jun 14 02:22:01 2015 UTC,"The issue is putting West at Center. I love David West. I like his heart, I like his competitive nature, but the dude will get DESTROYED against most of the bigs in the league. He doesn't have the lateral quickness which means in a spin move he's going to get a lot of fouls or let people get a lot of layups.  If you want to put someone in the 5 position, in our current setup if you put PG at the 4, you put Lavoy Allen or Mahinmi at the 5. Both are younger and quicker than West is and there might be a better chance of them being able to deal with a mobile big, which is the trend in the NBA anymore."
pacers,39rnqh,NateThomas1979,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:03:38 2015 UTC,I would be shocked if we ever see PG at the 4 for extended minutes. Especially with West at Center.

pacers,39qn9h,exWarlock,4,Mon Jun 15 01:34:01 2015 UTC,"I'm more and more sold on the idea of adding him as opposed to either Turner or Lyles, etc.  To me the thought is that having an offensive center to switch with Roy might be a very interesting 1-2 punch. Are we up by 10/15? Put in Roy and our defensive team and slow the pace down a bit to give people time to rest. Are they making a run anyway? Put in Stuckey/Kaminsky/etc. and stretch the floor wide for people to be able to get the opposing team's big man out of the middle.  Two other things that are selling me more on him. He's shooting FT's at .780 which is extremely good for a center. Oh and did I mention that after shooting 101 3pt attempts last year, he shot .416 which is better than anyone on the Pacers roster currently. That's insane."
pacers,39qn9h,NateThomas1979,2,Sun Jun 14 00:56:36 2015 UTC,How many of those 101 3s were toe on the college 3 point line 3s though? Plenty of guys were dead eye college 3 point shooters then couldn't hack it once they had to shoot from 3 feet further back.
pacers,39qn9h,trilliam_clinton,3,Sun Jun 14 01:03:02 2015 UTC,"Sure but even if he loses SOME of that by having to shoot farther back, that's still great range for a center.   One of my big concerns is losing West after next year. One of the most consistent parts of our offense was driving and dishing off to West for a 20 footer. With most of our big players not being able to consistently hit the midrange/outside shot, getting someone who IS consistent would be a great pickup."

pacers,39n1nb,DaBear405,5,Fri Jun 12 22:20:36 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would like to see us get a forward/Center. David West is getting old and Roy Hibbert has been inconsistent."
pacers,39n1nb,bobdammit,2,Fri Jun 12 22:48:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd like to draft a center. If not a center, then a guard since PG13 is going to start playing some PF"
pacers,39n1nb,MitchelS12,3,Fri Jun 12 22:57:44 2015 UTC,Whoever the best player is...we got enough problems outside of PG.
pacers,39n1nb,Pacers31Colts18,2,Fri Jun 12 23:00:57 2015 UTC,"Imo, point guards, sg and small forwards are hard to find while  Pf and center positions  are tough to get.... bare w/ me...  High picks should be spent on big men; while scouting is essential for the pg, sg and sf position.  (Example: Nash,  Stockton, tony Allen,  ginobilllli, kobe, paul george, etc....)"
pacers,39n1nb,h3isenburg,2,Sat Jun 13 04:35:17 2015 UTC,This is true. I feel it's more likely to find a diamond in the rough through a scouted back court player than a scouted front court player
pacers,39n1nb,Anicole2196,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:51:41 2015 UTC,Neither? I'd rather fix our big offensive issue in the middle and draft a center.  At this point I'm leaning towards Frank Kaminsky due to his agility and ability to hit the outside shot. I think that he's the opposite of Hibbert and that could be interesting to have those two counter each other depending on what you are looking for in a game.
pacers,39mdvf,Pacers31Colts18,3,Fri Jun 12 19:29:07 2015 UTC,"What's going on with our pick? I saw were one of franks 3 teams, but is there someone better?"
pacers,39mdvf,Anicole2196,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:15:08 2015 UTC,"Kaminsky's three teams? Who are the other two?  I have a feeling that FO is leaning towards Payne given all the talks that's been going on recently.  I think everyone is dropping Kaminsky into our laps because simply seeing him as a replacement for West, and that's all they seem to be focused on.  If Hibbert was doing fine with his role and everything then yeah Kaminsky would fine because that would turn us into contenders for sure.  We all know that we really need to get some youth now..."
pacers,39mdvf,ISUCKATKARMA,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:33:17 2015 UTC,I would imagine the Heat have to be one of Kaminsky's three teams. Right? They need a stretch-4 big man... to work with Bosh... right?

pacers,39mdvf,Anicole2196,2,Sat Jun 13 14:46:54 2015 UTC,sup cool cats. GO PACERS!!!!
pacers,39mdvf,h3isenburg,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:23:47 2015 UTC,I've been thinking about this for a while. How come Bogut hasn't been getting as much shit as Hibbert got with his bad games. All over r/nba was how bad Hibbert was the last couple of years. And there doesn't seem like much talk about Bogut. Is that a fair comparison?
pacers,39mdvf,StamperOilPR,5,Sat Jun 13 02:03:16 2015 UTC,For what's worth Bogut has Klay and Steph.  That really just means he has to hang out near the rim on the opponent's side and throw dunks when he gets lobbed to.  Not like our Hibbs when he's a vital part of our defense and offense sadly....  Bogut's still one of the top centers in the league by far.  You fit him anywhere and he's going to produce somehow despite his injury history.  He's very lucky to have Klay and Steph to handle being the key players so that he doesn't have to play a big role and likely hurt himself in the process.
pacers,39mdvf,ISUCKATKARMA,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:29:35 2015 UTC,"Good point. So basically Bogut gets cut bit of slack cause he doesn't hurt their offence (100+ points a game) and has solid defence. Whereas we rely on Hibbert to produce on offence as well, that's where it hurts us."
pacers,39mdvf,StamperOilPR,2,Sat Jun 13 03:16:35 2015 UTC,I guess I didn't realize Bogut still had such a big contract. His contract is actually longer than Hibbert's.
pacers,39mdvf,h3isenburg,2,Sat Jun 13 02:22:02 2015 UTC,"Hibbert became popular because he was the key to beating the heat at that time. He (an above avg rhim defender) was Miami's weakness. Yay big contract. Now ,  when he started sucking, lbj was still playing for the heat; therefore, lots of dicks sucking bandwagon fans must have escalated the hating. Imo, leading to hate. Lots of hate. I hate him and im a mother fucking pacers fan."
pacers,39mdvf,h3isenburg,2,Sat Jun 13 04:20:56 2015 UTC,Oh ps btw...etc. ....id still take bogut over hibbert any day.

pacers,39lhpg,ISUCKATKARMA,3,Fri Jun 12 18:18:36 2015 UTC,Seems like the Pacers are really ramping up their workouts with this last one and now having in Frank and Turner.
pacers,39hnez,Pacers31Colts18,20,Thu Jun 11 19:51:54 2015 UTC,"I'm willing to ride out Wests contract without any regrets. IMO, he's the main reason why we were even considered contenders. Yeah PG is our best player and Hibbert/Lance had a nice short run; however, our entire franchise turned around the day West came to our team. We finally started winning games and his leadership is one of the main reason why. You'll hear me curse out HIbbert and George Hill's contract all day; however, this one I will never regret. Thank You David West for turning our team around."
pacers,39hnez,h3isenburg,4,Thu Jun 11 22:19:44 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on David West completely. I can't believe how quick most Pacers fans would drop him in a heartbeat. He does so much for the team outside of the box score. You can always count on him to knock down big shots and make important plays.  Also, we're most likely going to be paying Hibbert. That is the contract that is really holding the Pacers back. I like him, but not for that much money."
pacers,39hnez,makeyoucry,4,Thu Jun 11 23:55:00 2015 UTC,I remember last year his jump shot saved us from losing to Atlanta in game 7.
pacers,39hnez,h3isenburg,3,Fri Jun 12 00:07:59 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, D West is older now, but was very under rated when he first joined us"
pacers,39hnez,BKD2674,2,Fri Jun 12 03:50:59 2015 UTC,David's leadership skills are worth the money alone...
pacers,39hnez,agentfelix,5,Fri Jun 12 01:51:38 2015 UTC,"I agree with u/h3isenburg for once in this matter. Play out West's contract as he's been a solid stand up guy for us and even though he's declined year after year, you really don't have anyone better to put into that spot anyways.  My biggest issue is the same one you see me pointing to last year and the year before that. West has lost a solid step and almost half of his lateral quickness. It's not just him defending his man either but it is also in how he is slow to transition to help out Roy when Hibbert has to move over to contest a driving player.   I think West knows he's done after this year. I think he has been such a positive influence not only on the court but in the lives of some of our more needy individuals in the state, that you can't help but root for him to go out as a Pacer."
pacers,39hnez,NateThomas1979,6,Fri Jun 12 00:54:05 2015 UTC,I really hope he's with us until he retires.
pacers,39hnez,h3isenburg,3,Fri Jun 12 01:09:25 2015 UTC,"I agree with h3isenburg (shockingly). I see no reason to get rid of David West. Honestly, I think if we were to get rid of BOTH Hibbert and West, it would do more harm than good. Get rid of Hibbert and we'll be fine."

If we can get someone good in the draft, and George Hill can stay at that level of intensity, I like this squads chances.  I like Solo if he can keep improving.  Stuckey needs to stick around, but definitely be a bench player.  He's shown he's much more productive that way, and really gives the bench a boost."

pacers,38nvb4,trilliam_clinton,1 point,Sat Jun 6 07:30:32 2015 UTC,"I think this should be pretty exciting. We need PG for a lot more than running off screens or settling for jump shots.   I hate to say this, but we need him to be a bit more like LeBron."
pacers,38nvb4,pfc_bgd,-2,Mon Jun 8 20:13:02 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting game plan. I hope he can improve his post game by doing this.  Sorry to be a downer but I already know what to expect from our team next year. Without a descent point guard and two soft players such as Hibbert and George Hill, we're pretty much going to be the 3rd-5th best team in the east and will lose in the 1st or the 2nd round. The best thing next year will be that Hibbert will be a FA and we can get rid of West/Hills contract and finally start to rebuild. Unless PG-13 is the next mj/kobe/lbj (Which I'm hoping to God he will be) we're not doing anything important next year besides letting time pass by."
pacers,38nvb4,h3isenburg,5,Fri Jun 5 23:41:19 2015 UTC,"Say what you want about George Hill, but he was still tied for 4th (I think he was slightly ahead) with Kyrie Irving in PER for Point Guards this season.

pacers,38nvb4,kneeonball,-1,Sat Jun 6 06:45:07 2015 UTC,He got outplayed by a 3rd string point guard in the biggest game of the year for us. If hes one of our best players than we might as well throw in the flag.

pacers,38nvb4,kneeonball,-1,Sat Jun 6 16:59:18 2015 UTC,"agreed; however, this was crunch time. Guys get outplayed all the time but to do that on a must win game isn't good. Happened 2 years in a row before that when we lost to the Heat also. Most of our players (Hibbert & Hill especially) did not show up those games. I can understand sucking and losing but I hate not trying. I don't think Hibbert and George Hill are tough enough for these types of games."

And I'm pretty sure Lillard, in the most important games of the season, completely shit the bed against a Grizzlies team who played these same PGs who gave George Hill fits.

His 8 MIL contract can be used to get 2 legit players probably twice as better than him.  boo hoo, back to back game. No excuses. You're playing a 3rd string player and you got outplayed by him IN A MUST WIN GAME. MUST WIN GAME. MUST WIN. No, hey George Hill is the reason we almost made the playoffs . WOOOO so proud of him!! Taking Lillard over Hill is like taking Chauncy Billups over chucky atkins. It's a no brainer. He's a bench player at best. He doesn't belong on a starting championship team unless he's the 4th-5th best player on that squad.    This dude is beyond soft. He can't guard anyone from the opposite team and can't pass at all. He's a bad pick and roll player and a defender. He can occasionally get hot from the 3 point line but so can Copeland.

They drafted duds and traded them and then lebron shows up and they trade for everything, because lebron. they might have 2 years to run for a championship after that the ship will go down so quick and the cavs will be the second-rate team they are."
pacers,38ivu2,pfc_bgd,3,Fri Jun 5 11:22:41 2015 UTC,"They really only fucked up one draft...Kyrie and Wiggins are about as far from duds as they can get. Thompson is also starting to look like less of a dud.   Then LeBron showed up, which meant that they needed to create a win now roster, which is why they traded Wiggins and got Love. And then the front office did really well mid season to pick up Mozgov, JR, and Shumpert.   I actually think their front office did quite well.   You're giving cavs 2 years to run for a championship? I'd say they have at least 5. They will absolutely dominate the East unless something crazy happens."
pacers,38ivu2,iAMtHESushighost,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:47:17 2015 UTC,"With us healthy, the Bucks and Sixers on the rise, and possibly conferences realigned with Pelicans, Timberwolves, or Grizzlies possibly added or maybe the top 16 seeding rather than 8 and 8, not to mention that LeBron is 30 I'd say 2-4 years before he's not going to get anything."
pacers,38ivu2,pfc_bgd,3,Sat Jun 6 18:07:17 2015 UTC,Sixers on the rise? What rise? the Bucks? We'll see but they're not even close to the Cavs.   Conference realignment? There are 0 reliable sources that even suggest that this is coming any time soon.
pacers,38ivu2,iAMtHESushighost,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:21:54 2015 UTC,"The Sixer's most certainly aren't on the decline, and I think they will be able to do something with their prospects, draft picks and look at their cap space, so 4-5 years and I think they are in a deep playoff run. The bucks are already elite defensively (#2 in defensive efficiency) and are only getting better. OK there's nothing saying that there's going to be a realignment but the top 16 still might happen. Point is, anything can happen."
pacers,38ivu2,MC_Reagan,-2,Sat Jun 6 20:00:17 2015 UTC,"I wish both teams could lose and they give the championship to the Hawks or Rockets. The only reason Golden State wins or loses is the absurdly insane amount of 3s they take. There's more to basketball than 3s. Cleveland is just 3 ""super""stars Lebron put on one team. Their bench sucked until they made deals with teams that gave up to get bench at an NBA quality."
pacers,38ivu2,asay42,2,Sat Jun 6 01:17:14 2015 UTC,I think Golden State is more than just an insane amount of threes. The Pacers shot a ton of 3s under Obrien and sucked ass.
pacers,38mi3o,typs,2,Fri Jun 5 04:20:24 2015 UTC,"wtf are you talking about? The ""glaring"" weakness is that a power forwards struggles to guard a point guard with amazing ball skills and who is also the best shooter in the history of the game?   Also, how is WCS a potential future Pacer?"
pacers,38mi3o,pfc_bgd,1 point,Fri Jun 5 11:54:36 2015 UTC,"The weakness is not that he struggles to do it, it's that he thinks he can and tries to.  Even when Roy is in that position he takes away any drive and does what he can to force a long jumper, manning up like TT and WCS is a defensive trait.  WCS is a potential Pacer because he's the draft, I don't know why that needs to be explained."
pacers,38mi3o,pfc_bgd,0,Fri Jun 5 15:05:14 2015 UTC,"is Okafor a potential Pacer too? Towns?  when Thompson ended up guarding Curry, Curry did for most part end up shooting a long jumper. So I have no clue what point you're trying to make. Also, what does Roy have to do with this? And what do you mean by ""even when Roy"", as if Roy is some measuring stick when it comes to guarding point guards at the perimeter. Thompson is way better at that than Roy."
pacers,38mi3o,pfc_bgd,2,Fri Jun 5 15:11:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, they are, even if that potential is extremely low.  WCS could either fall to us, or we could trade up, so the potential is realistic.  The point I'm trying to make is that when switched onto a guard a big has two options; sit back, clog the lane, allow only an outside shot, or try to man up and get caught out of position.  Roy, and our defensive system is inherently clog the lane, TT and WCS have a natural tendency to man up."
pacers,38mi3o,ISUCKATKARMA,2,Fri Jun 5 15:17:41 2015 UTC,"yea dude, leave curry or thompson room for an open three point shot.   Also, you're saying that something is glaring weakness...and that something may very well be instructed by the coach. I sure as hell would ask Tristan to try and contest three point shots by Curry and Thompson. It'd be much easier for Tristan to just sit back and clog the lane...I'm pretty sure he can do that. And so can WCS."
pacers,38mi3o,ISUCKATKARMA,2,Fri Jun 5 15:22:46 2015 UTC,"The thing is every big struggles with this except for Anthony Davis.  So you're pointing out the elephant in the room, when there's thousands."
pacers,38mi3o,gptwebb,0,Fri Jun 5 19:53:42 2015 UTC,"The reason I pointed it out, is because we have bigs that do it the right way.

Our lack of willingness to ever go into luxury tax will prevent us from winning championships that route. And our poor drafting and scouting doesn't show signs of winning via draft.

pacers,38imek,skaige,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:36:50 2015 UTC,"man I agree with 90% of what you said. I also believe that our owner is cheap as hell and he's one of the main reason why we can't sign a big named player. Our Drafting; however, isn't as bad as you think IMO. I've said it multiple times since last year (after we saw how Hibbert and George Hill really play) that we won't be contenders until we get rid of or significantly lower their salary."
pacers,38imek,h3isenburg,2,Fri Jun 5 23:34:27 2015 UTC,"The owner isn't cheap. They're actually really terrific real estate minds who understand business. They smartly build the team under the luxury tax. They've given long-term max contracts to Hibbert and George recently. The Pacers have remained very competitive, save for a few years, during the last 20 seasons and made the playoffs 15 of those seasons.   Big name players aren't itching to sign in Indiana either. There are a lot of factors why the Pacers have never won an NBA ring (luck, Jordan, Kobe/Shaq, LeBron), but the owners being cheap isn't one of them. That's just a really stupid assumption to make when there's so much evidence to the contrary."
pacers,38imek,CaptAwesomepants,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:12:59 2015 UTC,"He builds his team to get to the playoffs and that's it. We were contenders once (thanks to Ron Artest and David STern, that was done) I don't think he's trying to build a championship roster. I truely believe he's only in it for the business aspect. He's been known to be cheap and there have been plenty of times where we could've signed a player worth of value if we went over the cap and he did not choose to do that. I understand that he has a ""terrific real estate mind""; however, as a fan I want to see our team win rings, not ""sell seats & make money."""

pacers,382lj4,h3isenburg,3,Mon Jun 1 16:00:09 2015 UTC,"Donald Sloan is one of the guys that I really don't see the point is keeping him.  In his first season in 2011/12 he shot .399 from the field with a PER of 8.9, You would expect someone to get better as they play more, but in 2014/15 he shot .408 and a PER of 13.1, still under the average player in the NBA.  I know that we don't expect our third string PG to be capable of more than this, but the more glaring issue to me is when Sloan is on the floor the offense just stagnated horribly. I actually would have kept AJ Price over Sloan due to his ability to energize the team.  He has good offensive capabilities but his defense is not the best and his ability to run the offense is even more suspect. One of the  biggest issues with the Pacers 2 years ago was Lance holding onto the ball until 8 seconds to go and trying to force something. Sloan this year had similar problems where it would take him forever to set up a play. This is horrendous to have in a PG who needs to be able to be that floor general. Even as a third string, if he has to go into the game, we can't afford to have the offense go to hell and try to save ourselves on defense. Not when he is also never had a DRtg of less than 102 ppg in a year.  I like him, I do as a person, but I feel he needs a year or two overseas or in the D-league to really develop."
pacers,382lj4,NateThomas1979,2,Mon Jun 1 16:56:53 2015 UTC,Anything other than the min and we're reaching.  I honestly don't see us signing him again though; he had some solid games early in the season but he didn't seem to be in the mix much once we got some chemistry later on.
pacers,382lj4,yobramine,2,Mon Jun 1 15:59:11 2015 UTC,"He would really have to come back near minimum otherwise its not really worth it. It will be interesting since we dont plan on bringing Watson back. George Hill is our only PG right now, so Bird has to have a plan of some sort here. Sloan is a great third PG, but I wouldn't want him as the main backup. That said, I could see the minutes being something like:  Hill/Stuckey Miles/Solo PG/Solo/Miles West/Scola Hibbert, Mahinmi and/or our draft pick.  Vogel really only runs 8-9 each game, so I could see Stuckey being the bench PG. We will see as time comes, but that is my premature guess."

pacers,37ztxj,ynksjts,2,Tue Jun 2 01:41:00 2015 UTC,They all think we are going to get a defensive big way cheaper than they're going to go for.  Robin Lopez or Omar Asik are fine at 8 but not so much at 10-12.  Hibberts per 36 numbers are fine and he's durable.  Also never underestimate a guy in his contract year.  Many guys put it together for that one year to score that big contract.  Even JR Smith put down the pipe long enough to have a good season during his contract year. I'm just not sold on whoever we get at four being a star and I'd rather have a competent defensive big at 15.5 mil for one year than a useless point guard at 7.5 for 2 years.

But without that I think it's Kaminsky even though I think he's reached his ceiling.  The positive is that we get a stretch 5 so maybe that opens things up for PG/Hill to do some damage?

But I have a friend who's really high on him, as is my father, so it'll be good for Xmas.   I just really hope we can pull two first round picks from this draft. For example, if we get Kaminsky and, say, Jerian Grant, I'll deal. If we get Kaminsky and Looney, I'll be happy.   I really think Minnesota will pull a shocker on Draft Day 2015.

pacers,37dcbc,exWarlock,3,Wed May 27 03:42:34 2015 UTC,"I want to make a second reply to make note of this article that I read earlier:   This is also the problem that Aaron Gordon of the Orlando Magic is currently struggling with. When you make the leap from college to the NBA, you quickly find that everybody at every position is suddenly 2-3 inches taller than they were in college. Guys like Thomas, Swift, and now Gordon, all struggled mightily with this new dimension. Instead of being on equal footing physically and then overpowering the competition with athleticism, they were now undermanned physically and trying to make up for it with athleticism. It's a dangerous predicament, and few players in the NBA are able to adjust to the point where they are able to survive.   Kaminsky can stretch the floor. His equivalent of ""overpowering...with athleticism"" is shooting consistently from NBA range, a feat I'm sure he can accomplish. Our pick could seriously be used worse."

He didn't exactly pan-out like he was supposed to but he's a six-foot eight guy with a seven-foot three wingspan and a rock solid frame. We need frontcourt depth and there isn't much else that looks good in the second round.   But I see your point in that he'd be a project and not an immediate impact kind of guy.

He's a mediocre player who had trouble signing with anyone in Europe for the first half of last season until one of the better teams in the ABA league (league of teams from former Yugoslavia) finally picked him up. He couldn't find a team partially because of injuries (red flag?) and then partially because he's really no good."

If we're talking about the players who'll primarily serve the purpose of filling up the roster, both Rudez and Barac are fine. Otherwise- nope.   Also, Rudez at least had somewhat of a career before coming to the NBA, Barac has been a dissapointment.   Edit. Just for completeness, Rudez had the second lowest player efficiency rating last year out of all our players...Slightly better than Copeland. So, I think I was right about Rudez."

He might be a bit tall but I'd like to think that he has the potential to also switch off at the PF position.

pacers,37a2cd,materhern,-1,Tue May 26 11:42:39 2015 UTC,"WAS best defensive center in the league. I'd have to give that to a few other people, Anthony Davis being first and foremost.  What happens is that people get tape on you. They find out your weaknesses. With the new rules about 'verticality' (Thanks Miami :-)) what we have now is a guy who has a lateral speed deficiency and a guy who cannot guard mobile big men out high.  This has exposed Roy on the defensive side against his man and allowed people to exploit the weakness between him and West who also has lateral issues.  IF the Pacers truly are going to a more uptempo offense, then getting Roy 2.0 is a horrible choice. Picking up a guy who runs awkwardly (i.e. poor muscle structure) is not going to be something you can develop. Roy is a case in point. He's a solid defender, but the issues he does have, getting into position, exerting his strength, etc. are all still the same problems that they were when he got into the league."
pacers,37a2cd,NateThomas1979,1 point,Tue May 26 16:53:19 2015 UTC,"Anthony Davis isn't a center. He also doesn't sit in the paint like a rim protector would, he's good at affecting passing lanes and going out and defending people away from the rim as well because of his length and speed."
pacers,37a2cd,kneeonball,1 point,Tue May 26 20:07:44 2015 UTC,"You can defend Roy all you want, his defense has gone down this past year, not up. I like him as a defender but saying he's the best defensive center in the game is ultimately biased even as Pacer fans.  Anthony Davis is listed as a PF/Center according to both Basketball Reference and the Pelican's own roster.  Also, to note as to what metric you are using to define Roy as the best defensive Center... We can look at this through stats. Here is some measurable defensive stats with leaders listed who are listed as a center or PF/C by their team:   Blocks per game - AD #1 at 2.9, Rudy Gobert at #3, Deandre Jordan at #4, John Henson #5, Tim Duncan #6, Pau Gasol #8, Andre Drummond #9, Brook Lopez #10, DeMarcus Cousins #11, Gorgui Dieng #12, Andrew Bogut #13, Roy Hibbert #15.  Block Pct - Gobert #1, Davis #2, Deandre Jordan #4, Alex Len #5, Bogut #6, Duncan #7, Hibbert #8 Defensive Rating - Bogut #2, Duncan #3, Gobert #5, Jordan #7, Marc Gasol #10, Anthony Davis #12, Gortat #13,  Al Jefferson #14, Zaza Pachulia #15, Hibbert #17   In fact, when you look at an interesting metric that compares the value of the player over their replacement Roy is not only down the list... he's 34th."

pacers,37a2cd,kneeonball,1 point,Tue May 26 21:31:43 2015 UTC,"He for sure dropped in effectiveness this year but not having an elite wing defender on the court didn't help, all year long guys were getting into the paint at will and made it impossible for Hibbert to do his job because nobody could stay in front of their man."
pacers,37a2cd,Frostler,1 point,Wed May 27 02:41:11 2015 UTC,"If you look at my post history, I think that West/Scola is one of the biggest issues of our defense last year. I'm not sure what happened but if you look at these two defensive efficiency you see that they correlated with horrible D.eff.  What the eye test tells me is that someone would get beat, Hibbert would go over to help and his man would get a bucket.  But regardless of all of that, I was focusing on your words that he is arguably the best defending center in the game. He's good at defense, but with the rule changes and his complete and utter removal of confidence, he's not even close the best. Top 10 maybe and that's pushing it."

My degree is in kinesiology so I'm interested to look at the discussion and consider it from a biomechanics standpoint.  It will be even more interesting to note IF he is capable of fixing this. It'd be one of the first cases I've seen where someone has changed their gait in a short time. Usually this is a multiple year process that is fixed over time and I'm not sure if you want to waste such a high draft pick on 'potential' with other picks that might be able to be effective right now.  I'll look closely at the link and let you know. Sports science isn't a good term in my field, but it doesn't mean that their measurements and tests are off. People just don't like how they try to jazz everything up to be a big deal instead of focusing on those few things that make such a big difference between the athlete and the normal person."

He might only be 6'9"" but has a 7'3"" wingspan (same as Lyles, Turner). He also has such a natural shot. I think he has a much higher ceiling than some of the other guys in our range. I personally believe we will regret taking Lyles if we do."

But a little confused on his position, and still feel that we need a more 4/5 player than a 3/4.   But if we're doing the whole stretch forward thing, maybe Frank wants someone like that at the 4, in order to keep Paul at the 3."
pacers,36p6b9,ISUCKATKARMA,3,Thu May 21 23:29:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's as much of a 3/4 tweener as you think. I think he's a stretch 4 with the potential skill set of a Lamar Odom. He rebounds so strongly that I don't think that will be an issue. Look at Draymond Green's success. I think Looney can have that kind of success but more offensive than defensive. When I watched Turner, Lyles, and Looneys draft analysis videos, Looney has some natural instincts that the others don't have. I see so much David West lite in him. I'll try to link the video later."
pacers,36p6b9,MC_Reagan,1 point,Fri May 22 00:06:53 2015 UTC,"As far as Turner vs. Lyles vs. Looney, I would definitely pick Looney first.  But he's not particularly the first player I'd pick at #11."

We trade Roy Hibbert and our #11 pick to the Knicks and get Willie Cauley-Stein with the pick.

pacers,36kebq,Brumplestiltskins,2,Wed May 20 14:12:23 2015 UTC,I'd like to think it's the cap space they will save by using him for a year an letting him go as a free agent.

I don't think injuries are as problematic as you make it sound.   As for defense: 1) Hibbs and his D have been exposed, so there that goes 2) we're probably not going to be as defensive minded of a team as we have been in the last few years.   I think I'd be willing to take a gamble on Brook Lopez if our goal is to try to win it all it next few years...If not, we can try to develop that #11 pick into a good player, but that's at least as big of a gamble as betting on Lopez."

pacers,36kgdj,h3isenburg,0,Wed May 20 11:01:40 2015 UTC,I don't think either deserve to have their jersey retired.
pacers,36kgdj,Pacers31Colts18,1 point,Thu May 21 16:20:34 2015 UTC,"def agreed. I would rather have JO's than Smits imo. I think for the little time he was here, he brought a lot more."
pacers,36kgdj,h3isenburg,1 point,Sat May 23 00:17:44 2015 UTC,"How do his per game stats rate though? Being 2nd in everything including games and minutes tells us nothing compared to other Pacers.   He was fun to watch, but how did he compare to his main rivals; which included Ewing and Mourning?   If you would retire him would you also retire Mark Jackson?"
pacers,36kgdj,SiRyEm,3,Wed May 20 01:44:15 2015 UTC,"His stats per game is: 14.8 ppg, 6.1 rpg, and 1.3 ppg.   Maintaining that throughout his 12 year career is quite a feat.   To answer your second question I would not retire Mark Jackson's jersey. He spent only 5 years as a Pacer and didn't do anything that merits such an honor. Was an excellent player don't get me wrong."
pacers,36kgdj,Pacers31Colts18,1 point,Wed May 20 03:46:31 2015 UTC,If Rik were to get in they would need to put Freddie Lewis and Jermaine in. Our banners are for the absolute elite in the franchise
pacers,36if4k,Pacers31Colts18,2,Tue May 19 16:54:08 2015 UTC,What's a point guard? I don't think I've ever seen this position.
pacers,36if4k,Jinno,1 point,Tue May 19 16:56:09 2015 UTC,I'd love to pick up Payne.  But what would that mean for Hill?
pacers,36if4k,materhern,5,Tue May 19 17:00:18 2015 UTC,probably moving to the 2 position which some would argue is his best position.
pacers,36if4k,Frostler,1 point,Tue May 19 20:06:35 2015 UTC,"Is this similar to Elfrid Payton?  Would be nice to grab him but as the article mentioned,  his stock has been rising. Don't think he'll be available in the second round at all."
pacers,36if4k,ISUCKATKARMA,2,Tue May 19 19:54:39 2015 UTC,He'd be the 11th pick. A bit of a reach imo.
pacers,36if4k,DonnieNarco,2,Tue May 19 21:48:16 2015 UTC,trade back maybe? He's probably available at #16. We could send you the Dallas 2015 1st to move up. That pick is probably going to be late lottery with Rondo and Chandler probably leaving.
pacers,36if4k,idontcarefuckit,1 point,Wed May 20 13:18:09 2015 UTC,He's being ranked Top 15 in some Mock Drafts.
pacers,36if4k,Boom_Baby31,1 point,Wed May 20 01:06:50 2015 UTC,Yeah but not 11th. A slight reach but still a reach.
pacers,36fog0,Pacers31Colts18,8,Tue May 19 00:49:38 2015 UTC,"I too like the idea of Jerian Grant playing with George Hill, Pacers. I guess that settles it!"
pacers,36ea63,mrbultman,9,Mon May 18 18:36:11 2015 UTC,"Well, Larry also thought Hibbs was a ""a lot of tens of millions of dollars player"".  On a bit more serious note, is this another shot at Hibbs by Larry?"
pacers,36ea63,pfc_bgd,6,Mon May 18 18:55:09 2015 UTC,Maybe bird is just trying to light a fire under hibberts ass to get him to play better
pacers,36ea63,sascottie11,6,Mon May 18 19:09:08 2015 UTC,"If he opts in, its a contract year.  If he wants a contract thats not shrinking, he better play his ass off.  That should be motivation enough."
pacers,36ea63,materhern,4,Mon May 18 19:38:56 2015 UTC,I actually think Hibbert was signed to that max deal that year when Bird was on hiatus for health reasons.
pacers,36ea63,tergiversation,1 point,Mon May 18 21:21:37 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think it could be a combination of seriousness as well as a subtle shot to Roy. I think it's very possible WCS could develop into a max contract player. He kind of reminds me of DeAndre Jordan, actually, who is due for a huge payday himself. Long, athletic, and defensive, but can actually hit free throws."
pacers,36ea63,pacerpower,1 point,Mon May 18 19:14:00 2015 UTC,Absolutely a shot at Roy and CONSISTENT with his whole playing faster thing.
pacers,36ea63,pacerpower,1 point,Mon May 18 22:57:43 2015 UTC,"I mean I get we are moving on from Hibbert, but he was already worth the money we paid him even if we don't play him at all next year.  We made it to the ECF two straight years.  That block on Melo.... amazing.  Who cares if he mental-ed out, he still protected the rim to justify his pay.  This season he probably won't see the court, but I still see it as money well spent."
pacers,36ea63,pfc_bgd,1 point,Mon May 18 22:57:12 2015 UTC,"no he didn't protect the rim to justify his pay! Because just protecting the rim is NOT worth $15M. And, as I said million times, teams have figured him out...they pull him away from the rim, and he's useless.   Anyway, if he was worth $15M, we would be able to trade him or he would opt out and get that money (or more) elsewhere. But he's not worth it, so he'll opt in and get the money no one from the Pacers believes he's worth.  Also, as a reminder, we made it to the finals last year despite Hibbs...not because of Hibbs. Remember those 0 and 0 games he had?"
pacers,36ea63,pacerpower,1 point,Tue May 19 00:56:15 2015 UTC,"I know man, I was there.  I also remember his 26 point eruption after the 0/0 game.  We don't get to ECF without Hibbert last year, but I also know that we lost the ECF because of Hibbert.  His defense at the rim has not suffered and 15 million is chump change under the new TV deal.  I am just asking for historical perspective.  The guy delivered on 75% of his contract years.  I think that's worth the money we paid the big man even though this year will be a total loss.  To your point about trading him.  I guarantee we will be able to trade a player of his defensive impact with 15M a year in the last year of his contract to a number of teams in the league.  I imagine if he picks up his option (would be crazy not to) we might just see that this year."
pacers,36ea63,h3isenburg,2,Tue May 19 21:55:09 2015 UTC,No one really knows how good these kids will be besides the people who actually scout and have the talent to scout. Larry is closer than 99% of other people in the world so he may be. Who knows.
pacers,36ea63,exWarlock,5,Mon May 18 23:16:03 2015 UTC,"Larry takes pride in his scouting and drafting. He goes to the combines, he goes to summer league games, I bet he's keeping an eye on college stats during Pacers games."
pacers,36ea63,h3isenburg,1 point,Tue May 19 04:31:23 2015 UTC,Agreed
pacers,36ea63,exWarlock,1 point,Tue May 19 21:46:46 2015 UTC,I really hope this isn't Larry trying to media-hype Cauley-Stein so that Frank Kaminsky falls to 11. 😰
pacers,36c8jd,AmadeusCrumb,1 point,Mon May 18 05:36:44 2015 UTC,Scola is the main problem. It's hard to find sidebar pictures that fit the weird size requirement for the sidebar. Just not much out there so I just resize to see fit.   The boomer avatar? You mean on the self posts?   I'm also working on the espn which is another weird logo.
pacers,36c8jd,Pacers31Colts18,1 point,Mon May 18 15:21:23 2015 UTC,what are the dimensions? i can help out with cropping/resizing so it doesn't look weird
pacers,36c8jd,DREWHOUSER,1 point,Mon May 18 15:47:53 2015 UTC,325(width)x360(height)
pacers,36c8jd,Pacers31Colts18,1 point,Mon May 18 16:01:00 2015 UTC,"Ok, you have a couple of options with this pic. Here's two different images with the correct dimensions: http://imgur.com/a/QC2v3   The one with the blue background gets you the full view of scola with little bars on the top and bottom, while the other one is a little more zoomed in so you don't have the bars. Personally I like the one without the bars."
pacers,36c8jd,DREWHOUSER,1 point,Mon May 18 16:19:05 2015 UTC,Can I ask how you are able to adjust it like so? Do you crop and then resize?
pacers,36c8jd,Pacers31Colts18,1 point,Mon May 18 16:20:21 2015 UTC,"I made a new blank image in Photoshop with the correct dimensions, then pasted in the full Scola picture and resized it within those dimensions. Hopefully that makes sense!"
pacers,36c8jd,DREWHOUSER,2,Mon May 18 16:24:16 2015 UTC,It does... Don't know why I didn't do it that way honestly
pacers,36avy8,_disguised_toast_,12,Sun May 17 21:46:01 2015 UTC,I will sacrifice my dick if we get a top three pick.  I will keep it on as of right now.

pacers,36avy8,blvcklisted,4,Sun May 17 23:43:17 2015 UTC,"I'd love to have the first pick in the draft, but I'm reasonable and know that it won't happen.  The NBA doesn't make any money giving us the first pick in the draft."
pacers,36avy8,yoloswagtacos,6,Mon May 18 06:43:09 2015 UTC,"Wait... are you implying the Draft Lottery may be rigged?!?  (because yeah, if it came out that was true, I wouldn't be surprised)"
pacers,36avy8,pfc_bgd,3,Mon May 18 13:49:30 2015 UTC,"I'd be shocked! NBA's reputation is on the rise, it has been very nice and clean lately...other than Donald Sterling crap, but NBA dealt with that super fast, and probably came out on top."
pacers,36avy8,exWarlock,1 point,Mon May 18 14:08:33 2015 UTC,You mean...  All that distracting stuff didn't take away from the conspiracy on how rigged the draft is...? Or the refs bias?
pacers,36avy8,materhern,5,Tue May 19 04:35:20 2015 UTC,We aren't getting number 1.  We're getting the second pick.  I'm practicing to be a prophet.  So far so good.  I'm 50/50 with predictions so far that have a 50/50 chance of being correct
pacers,36avy8,exWarlock,2,Mon May 18 16:23:22 2015 UTC,"I believe in you, saint materhern."
pacers,36avy8,PrimeTime317,3,Tue May 19 04:35:46 2015 UTC,What's the furthest a team has jumped up from?
pacers,36avy8,Airegus,5,Sun May 17 23:23:52 2015 UTC,LINK  Scroll down and you'll see a chart. Looks like the furthest was 11th worst team.   THERES A CHANCE BOYS!
pacers,36avy8,PrimeTime17,5,Mon May 18 00:42:26 2015 UTC,"only because Derrick Rose was expected to be #1, and Chicago was  the 11th worst that year."
pacers,36avy8,Pacers31Colts18,3,Mon May 18 03:13:41 2015 UTC,I'm gonna go ahead and make this the sticky post for the Draft Lottery.

pacers,36avy8,exWarlock,1 point,Tue May 19 23:26:00 2015 UTC,"We can still get a star at #11, but we can also get a bust. I'd rather have an undeniable win at #3."
pacers,36avy8,exWarlock,1 point,Wed May 20 00:34:31 2015 UTC,"Of course, I'm referring to Frank Kaminsky."
pacers,36avy8,Anicole2196,2,Wed May 20 01:41:42 2015 UTC,Kwame Brown was a stud. He was in the top 3... I'm cool with 11 haha
pacers,36avy8,lordb916,3,Fri May 22 00:35:33 2015 UTC,"Well, fuck."
pacers,36avy8,Dude4445,1 point,Wed May 20 00:47:36 2015 UTC,Would have loved to move up but I think we'll make a strong pick at 11. There is definitely a lot of PF talent that could cone in and play behind West for a year and hopefully grow into a starter by 2016-17 season.
pacers,36avy8,AlishaC31,3,Wed May 20 00:53:43 2015 UTC,"Don't forget, the 11th pick worked out for us pretty well in '87"

pacers,36b3e7,h3isenburg,14,Sun May 17 22:50:59 2015 UTC,Cap wont be the problem. Almost no one goes from playing in LA to playing in Indiana we just don't draw  big name free agents
pacers,36b3e7,wocks,1 point,Sun May 17 22:58:15 2015 UTC,"I mean, we've gotten a point guard from the clippers before"
pacers,36b3e7,McGinge,1 point,Mon May 18 03:51:36 2015 UTC,"DANG IT!! One of my good friends (hardcore sporst fan) said the same thing. No one wants to come to Indiana. I get that I guess; however, playing with PG-13 can be exciting too right? I think if he's our chosen one then we will attract a lot of FAs."
pacers,36b3e7,wocks,4,Sun May 17 22:59:33 2015 UTC,He can draw  good bench guys and  like 5th man starters. But not guys  like Blake and CP3 those are star players.
pacers,36b3e7,pfc_bgd,1 point,Sun May 17 23:06:57 2015 UTC,makes sense. I'd imagine some all-stars or super stars would want to play along side him since he's one of the emerging super stars. Hopefully someone good will want to come in. Time will tell.
pacers,36b3e7,ikebenson,2,Sun May 17 23:11:19 2015 UTC,"for PG to attract star players, his presence alone would have to mean that we're immediately serious title contenders...kind of like LeBron's presence- and only LeBron's. No one else in the league can currently do that, and I don't see anyone being able to do that any time soon. AD will probably be close to that, but I doubt he'd reach LeBron's level. The fact that LeBron is one of the best point guards when he plays that position is frightening, he can literally do everything.   As for Indiana, eh...it's just not a cool place."
pacers,36b3e7,jwquigley,1 point,Mon May 18 14:03:49 2015 UTC,I honestly believe pg-13 can become one of the best 2 way players the league has ever seen. I really hope he does.
pacers,36b3e7,pfc_bgd,9,Mon May 18 20:26:20 2015 UTC,Not gonna happen - but it would be sweet to have Chris Paul George Hill
pacers,36b3e7,Pacers31Colts18,0,Mon May 18 02:46:40 2015 UTC,ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I just got it. I think. George Hill would benefit a lot if he doesn' thave to handle the ball all the time from a good point g.
pacers,36b3e7,ISUCKATKARMA,4,Mon May 18 20:23:39 2015 UTC,No
pacers,36b3e7,Wilhelm_Amenbreak,4,Mon May 18 03:02:35 2015 UTC,"we do, we just need to move Indianapolis into LA or Chicago or NYC."
pacers,36b3e7,THE_BIG_SITT,3,Mon May 18 13:58:15 2015 UTC,I hate them both... I don't want either to be a Pacer
pacers,36b3e7,THE_BIG_SITT,1 point,Mon May 18 15:22:26 2015 UTC,damn really? I can see not liking Blake (he's just athletic) but no cp3 either?
pacers,36b3e7,thedarce,7,Mon May 18 20:24:42 2015 UTC,The only way we'll entice Chris Paul is Chris Paul George Hill.
pacers,36b3e7,gptwebb,3,Mon May 18 03:55:11 2015 UTC,"And then we just have to find Chris Hill.  There has to be one of those in the league,  right?"
pacers,364vxp,DeepFreezeDisease,10,Sat May 16 04:07:50 2015 UTC,"It's not as if 7 footers grow on trees. I'm highly skeptical that if we let Hibbert go his replacement will be any better, so we might as well keep him and hope he rediscovers his 2013 form."
pacers,364vxp,lordb916,3,Sat May 16 10:42:13 2015 UTC,"He's good at what he does but he dictates the style of play the whole team must run. When it's him and a real good west, we can play like the Memphis of the east. But west is no Randolph, and his time is closing. Getting rid of Hibbert, we should have the roster to run a very fast, fun, competitive style of basketball that will make games enjoyable to watch and make the most out of our athleticism. It will be good for the team making money (as it will be fun basketball and add fans, and good for fans as it will be fun basketball to watch) pacers have been one of the worst league pass teams cause it's slow plodding offense. #hibbertstyle"
pacers,364vxp,GrandBasterd,2,Sun May 17 03:55:39 2015 UTC,If hibbert accepted 7m a year i'd be fine with keeping him around unless we draft a center.  3 good centers in this draft i'd love to have as potential starters and a few more who could be starter quality (but unlikey to be all-star).
pacers,364vxp,Drak_is_Right,13,Sun May 17 16:37:19 2015 UTC,I think he'll turn it around.
pacers,364vxp,Lightning_Boi,2,Sat May 16 05:37:25 2015 UTC,"I don't see it. You can't just unsuck out of no-where. If we paid him 4-6 mil a year, I wouldn't mind but he deserves all the hate with that contract."
pacers,364vxp,h3isenburg,4,Sun May 17 00:04:17 2015 UTC,"I get the hate but I still think he can be good again next year. George Hill did it, it just requires hard work."
pacers,364vxp,Lightning_Boi,0,Sun May 17 00:27:20 2015 UTC,"There are two things that I disagree with a few Pacers fans: Hibbert & Hill are both overrated IMO. By a lot. Hibbert has countless 0 pts and 0 reb games and has been notoriously known to disappear in many, many games. George Hill, though improved offensively, has consistently been outplayed by the opponents point guard and is an overrated defender. Hibbert is a lost cause, even Bird and Vogel realize that. George Hill, if he can learn to play D and get tougher (both can take years) he could be worth 4-5 mil (def. not the 8 mil we're paying him right now)"
pacers,364vxp,h3isenburg,1 point,Sun May 17 13:43:09 2015 UTC,"I think if he plays like last year, Hill is worth around $8M per year...You cannot really compare his salary with current salaries of, for example, Wall, Lillard, Kyrie, Curry...Some of the players I mentioned currently make less than Hill or slightly above, but the thing is, they will cash in and will all probably end up in 15-20M range. Let's see what happens to Dragic, he's currently at $7M, which is a bargain, but I think he's looking to get $18M or so next year.   I'm OK with Hill being outplayed by a lot of point guards in the league, as long as it's not too bad because top guys at that position in the NBA are ridiculous these days."
pacers,364vxp,pfc_bgd,1 point,Mon May 18 14:20:52 2015 UTC,I'd like to point out that it seems like the last few times Hill has gone head to head with Wall he's played him to a draw (at least). He plays Wall really well.   Westbrook and Teague destroy him.
pacers,364vxp,TonofSoil,0,Mon May 18 16:28:30 2015 UTC,"At the beginning of this season, Hibbert was the only starter from the previous year still starting and it was his time to shine... but he just never showed up.  I don't know if he's gonna get a bigger chance than that."
pacers,364vxp,Trabitz,1 point,Sun May 17 00:56:12 2015 UTC,exactly. He had his shot and everyone knew he wasn't going to do anything with it. This dude is the biggest disappointment in Pacers history yet our fans think he's going to get good out of no where.
pacers,364vxp,h3isenburg,12,Sun May 17 21:43:39 2015 UTC,I don't think he is nearly as bad as people will probably say he is. He did not even have that bad a year and i think  most of that was from lacking Hill and PG13 for the whole year. with 2 of our best wing defenders gone we still mantianed  a top defense  but everyone will just point out a single game where someone scored and say that sums him up so i give up trying to argue.  The guy  is almost impossible to replace and we are going to be worse off if he opts out. I'm not sure why everyone wants to wreak the teams chemistry. Its almost like they don't remember making the confrnece finals 2 years in a row
pacers,364vxp,wocks,4,Sat May 16 14:01:22 2015 UTC,It's like you don't remember the post all star break collapse a couple years ago. It's like you don't remember all of roys 0 and 0 nights or 0 and 2 nights in the play offs. Like he didn't get out rebounded by Ray Allen of all people. Roy is the biggest softest player I may have every watched in my life. He's big and strong enough that he could dominate in this league. It's not like there are loads of great centers justl chilling in the wings. But instead he dribbles a couple seconds and goes away from basket to throw up another hook of his. Roy is just soft man. Of course that's just one guys opinion.
pacers,364vxp,fear_the_kraken,-1,Sat May 16 16:04:15 2015 UTC,I second this; however you still complimented him too much.
pacers,364vxp,h3isenburg,1 point,Sat May 16 23:52:05 2015 UTC,"Dude come on.  Stop flinging around this stupid hate.  Whether you like it or not, we're going to be stuck with Hibbs another year and one of the things I don't like forward to is this.  Deal with it!  Hibbs can still improve you know, and don't tell me otherwise until we've seen the results in person!"
pacers,364vxp,ISUCKATKARMA,-1,Sun May 17 17:13:55 2015 UTC,"bro, I agree that we are stuck with him for one more year. It hurts but we are stuck with him because he's not opting out of that 609 trillion dollar contract and no one is stupid enough, not even the Knicks, to take him off our hands next year. but... BUT...... BUUUUUUTTTTTT... to think that he can improve is delusional. If you think that he's going to improve you're in for a surprise. The dude is pure garbage and there's nothing else to it. Like I said, unless he's getting paid 5-7ish mill a year, he's overpaid. Oh yeah, Larry Bird and Vogel already gave up on him so are we?"
pacers,364vxp,h3isenburg,3,Sun May 17 21:31:21 2015 UTC,No.
pacers,364vxp,ISUCKATKARMA,-1,Sun May 17 23:07:16 2015 UTC,"come onnnnnnnnnnnnnnn. K'MONNNNNNN. You know deeeeeep down inside that Hibbert isn't good and that we are going to waste next year because he's on our team taking up 40% of our cap space. You knooooooow this man. Sorry for the hate and I'm not trying to be smart but this is just what I believe from what I've seen. I really hope he turns it around like you hope, I really do but I guess next year will tell."
pacers,364vxp,h3isenburg,6,Sun May 17 23:13:17 2015 UTC,"Solid defense, hope he can turn it around. Would love a power forward/center in the draft that could back him up so his diminished role won't kill us. With Scola(permitting we keep him) and West we have good passing and scoring bigs. Would love a young, athletic shot blocker like Cauley-Stein so the bench fall off ain't so drastic."
pacers,364vxp,spookydischarge,3,Sat May 16 15:40:55 2015 UTC,I like the idea of playing smaller and quicker from time to time
pacers,364vxp,spookydischarge,5,Sat May 16 15:41:40 2015 UTC,"Hibbert is an offensive liability. He can't post up like he used to and doesn't rebound well for his size. The 'Cers rarely feed him the ball, but they don't want or need to because he's usually just unable to make buckets. All that said, Roy is a defensive presence. He doesn't have to be quick or smart because he's big and he stands straight up under the hoop. Other teams don't attack the rim solely because Roy's down there and with our perimeter defense up to its regular caliber, that will be great. What I think Roy needs is a little motivation which I think is exactly what the Pacers are trying to give him. If you want to play while you collect your $15M, you better play like you mean it. Bird and Vogel I think have put the Pacers in a great spot with Roy. I'd like to keep him around, especially if he starts playing better, but if we lose him and he's not playing well, doesn't matter."
pacers,364vxp,ribull,14,Sat May 16 20:05:02 2015 UTC,"he's a horrendous offensive players and, at best, average defender of mobile and skilled big men. terrible rebounder for his size as well. He is great at blocking shots when smaller players attack the rim...but teams these days just pull him out away from the rim, and as soon as that happens, he's no good on D either.   Hibbert will obviously opt-in because even he knows that no one in the right mind would pay him what the Pacers will pay him next year. He's overvalued and will be gone next summer."
pacers,364vxp,pfc_bgd,2,Sat May 16 10:53:29 2015 UTC,"Agree.   People talk about him getting drug out of the post and struggling, or not putting up the points, or being a bad rebounder, but honestly, with exception to rebounding, it's all crap.   First of all, he'll never be a 20 point a night guy. It'd be nice if he would, but he's not aggressive enough on offense, and doesn't have the post moves to finish strong. And that's okay. He's not suppose to be an offensive weapon. He's the last option on our offense. His job is defense.   Which brings us to our second point, why rail on a guy for being bad when he's playing out of position? That'd be like trashing on PG for not blocking shots in the post or getting pissed at Steph Curry for getting blocked on a lay-up. Most teams aren't able to draw him out enough to open up the lane consistently. Just by being on the floor, in the post, he ends teams reliance on their slashing and post game.   Rebounding is kind of a toss up. Partially, because he plays so close to the rim, it's tough to grab boards bouncing out away from longer shots (which he created by closing down the entire post area). It's hard to box out and grab a board when the ball bounces 5' off the rim. At the same time, he should be getting more boards off the jump when they bounce out closer. Then again, his job is to close the lane down, which he continues to do. If he wasn't still keeping the lane closed, we'd give up more second chance points off put backs. Instead, if a team gets the rebound, they rarely try for the put back and push the ball out to reset the offense. This is beneficial to the team because it slows the game down, which let's the Pacers play their slower paced game.   Moving forward, if the team starts pushing for a smaller, faster style, Hibbert will find himself without a place on the roster. But so long as they play the grind it out, slower style, dependent on stifling defense, we'd be stupid to get rid of him.   Yes, he has shortcomings. But you build around his strengths and shore up those weaknesses with other players. His job isn't to score, that's what PG and Hill are for. His job is to close the lane. And he does it very well."
pacers,364vxp,pirate_doug,2,Sun May 17 03:42:25 2015 UTC,"Solid on defense.  He's a poor rebounder.  Poor on offense.  Moody, and has at times finished games with no stats, defensively or otherwise.  It seems he lets his mood dictate his performance.  If we had someone who was more offensively, more of a rebounder, more stable, and less productive defensively, I'd take him.  I think keeping Hibbert only works if he takes less when his contract is up."
pacers,364vxp,materhern,4,Mon May 18 16:28:28 2015 UTC,He pushes our defence to the next level.
pacers,364vxp,MeechOrMandingo,1 point,Sat May 16 04:12:00 2015 UTC,"Hibbert is way overpaid, but still a serviceable starting center unless we get lucky in the draft.    Even though he is streaky, his stats still would warrant a 7-9m/year contract from someone.  15m a year....overpaid by a lot.    Some mention Hill.  Is he worth 8m a year?  Probably not but its rare that every player lives up to their contract.  If he is overpaid, it isn't by much and replacing every player when such holes will soon exist at center and PF isn't worth it.  Winning a free agent bidding war would take overpaying a point guard by as much if not more then Hill is being overpaid.  Hill is outplayed by guards that tend to make far more then him.  Little surprise when Westbrook (who as a free agent would likely earn 20m+ or Wall) outplay him.  He still posted some really good PER numbers in limited time this season.  I say keep him around and work on the front court.  We WILL need a new PF in 2 years and MIGHT need a new center unless Hibbert comes back for half the money."
pacers,364vxp,Drak_is_Right,1 point,Sun May 17 16:34:07 2015 UTC,He'll have a contract year and we'll give him 3 years/36 million unless another team offers him max money.
pacers,364vxp,Duzaman,6,Sat May 16 17:11:29 2015 UTC,could happen it just take a solid year of play. Its not like he has a shitty attitude or anything. His relationship with the team his not completely in shambles like some think.
pacers,364vxp,wocks,-1,Sat May 16 20:25:04 2015 UTC,"If we give him 3 years/36 mil, I will punch Larry and Co. in the face. I'm kidding. I'll probably punch myself in the face. I'm punching someone. Giving 12 mil a year to Roy Hibbert would be like asking Tiger Woods to coach baseball. It's beyond stupid. IMO that is."

pacers,35qnzf,wocks,6,Wed May 13 00:00:06 2015 UTC,"Seriously, everyone likes to point at Roy's stat sheets and say he doesn't do anything. Most of his impact is off the sheet. Even when he isn't scoring and rebounding, he's defending the basket and boxing out making it easier for others to get boards. Is he a super star center? No. He's a big man that makes a difference though, and he gets more hate than he deserves."
pacers,35qnzf,collegiateballer,-2,Wed May 13 00:34:32 2015 UTC,"Seriously, defenders of Roy always point out him protecting the rim, as if others don't know about it. It's just NOT worth the money he's making considering his lack of production elsewhere...as for ""boxing out making it easier for others to get boards""- oh give me a break. He boxes out his man, isn't that the bare minimum expected from a center?  Also, his defense is exposed. Pull him out away from the rim, and he's lost. And many big men today can do that no problem. For example, career high for Marc Gasol in win or go home game for us."

pacers,35qnzf,collegiateballer,1 point,Wed May 13 02:46:21 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing he'll have a decent year because of, as you said, PG and hopefully George Hill building on where he left off last year.

pacers,35qnzf,collegiateballer,5,Wed May 13 02:58:08 2015 UTC,I'm so over Roy. He's turning into this black cloud hanging over the team. The sooner he is gone the better for both the Pacers and himself. I think he could use a fresh start elsewhere.
pacers,35qnzf,wocks,2,Wed May 13 13:44:05 2015 UTC,In what way is he a black cloud ?  the media are the ones making a lot of nothing out of a guy going to LA for the Summer a guy not hosting a celberty softball game like he is literally killing kittens
pacers,35qnzf,Yebreham,3,Wed May 13 22:24:11 2015 UTC,"Roy is a good guy but I hope he opts out cause this team really needs to move to a more athletic front court.   We need some bigs who can run the fast break and can shoot midrange/3 pointers effectively which will open up the paint and make it a lot easier for PG and our guards to score at the hoop   I know Roy is a great defender but he's so ineffective on offense it negates his defensive impact. his hook shot is still bad and he clogs up the paint cause teams will let him shoot midrange at will, and this makes things so much harder for our backcourt, knowing if they drive to the hoop they'll be met by an extra defender the majority of the time  I really hope Willie Caulie-stein falls to us because he would be the perfect big man to help transition to an athletic frontcourt. he's still very raw offensively but it shouldn't take him long to develop a decent midrange jumpshot. But he can run the fast break, can be effective in P&R which will give us a big man who our guards can lob the ball up for a dunk, and he can switch onto guards on defense and play them much better than your average big in this league"

pacers,35od25,herrrr-me-nerrrr,3,Wed May 13 21:00:44 2015 UTC,"With a full healthy squad, I think it would be us and Cleveland in the ECF."
pacers,35od25,Pacers31Colts18,3,Tue May 12 12:11:08 2015 UTC,"I really don't see it...Are we forgetting how much trouble Atlanta and Washington gave us last year, and they're miles ahead of where they were last year (assuming they're healthy, just like we're assuming healthy Pacers).   Also, I do not see us being competitive with the Bulls. They even match up nicely with us where we're supposed to be strongest, with PG...Butler has been pretty outstanding."
pacers,35od25,pfc_bgd,2,Tue May 12 16:34:23 2015 UTC,This is a joke right? Even with PG on the floor we'd only be competitive. We don't have any where near the fire power of a lot of the squads in the East. Could we have made it to the ECF? Sure. But to say that we'd steamroll everyone is just delusional.
pacers,35od25,collegiateballer,1 point,Tue May 12 23:12:40 2015 UTC,"Steamroll? That would never happen. Our squad this year was way too streaky. We go on a 7 game winning streak for February, then lose to the Celtics and Nets with 2 weeks in the regular season. If we had just won that Nets game, we would've been in the playoffs. Granted PG wasn't back for that game, but he was hardly in top form when he went off against Memphis. Letting our squad heal and seeing what we can get in the draft is better than flailing around in the playoffs. And you can bet that our guys will be hungry next year."
pacers,35od25,Siggycakes,1 point,Thu May 14 13:53:47 2015 UTC,"Even with a healthy pg-13, we're the 4th best team in the East, let alone the entire league. We're nowhere near contenders. Next year, we'll be lucky if we make the ECF, which I can bet anyone here we won't. Not with the current squad. We can either wait until Hibbert/West/Hills contract expires and re-sign them for cheap or start rebuilding right now. Either ways, next year is a wasted year. Bank on that."

pacers,35lzkz,Pacers31Colts18,1 point,Mon May 11 16:31:03 2015 UTC,"I'll admit I've never seen him play and know very little about him.  What stands out for me:   Payne sometimes struggled to stay in front of quicker, high quality guards. He would be caught slouching and not staying in a good defensive position, leaving him vulnerable to getting blown by, which many defenders took advantage of. Payne sometimes was caught ball watching leading to late, weak, contests on jumpers. On the pick and roll he sometimes was slow, or did not at all, fight over screens leading to easy looks for the opposing teams from deep or in close.   I think any guard we bring in NEEDS to excel at PnR defense.  This was one of Watson's strengths and will leave a void, since we know Sloan doesn't have the D to play extended minutes."

pacers,35j38w,h3isenburg,3,Mon May 11 04:10:29 2015 UTC,Noah had 15 rebounds last night. End of discussion.
pacers,35j38w,pfc_bgd,1 point,Mon May 11 08:37:35 2015 UTC,"IMO Noah is a better passer and gets down the court quicker. Here's another thing, he's simply incompatible with Rose, Hibbert clogs up the lane, Rose shoots more jump shots, Bulls lose."
pacers,35j38w,iAMtHESushighost,-2,Mon May 11 11:26:33 2015 UTC,"A serious post: Noah is on another level compared to Hibbert IMO. As good as Hibbert is defensively, Noah is a lot better. He's a better shot blocker and a way, way, way better rebounder. He's also a better passer. He plays the game with heart, something Hibbert does not do. I hate it but Noah gets an orgasm everytime he rebounds the ball like Alonzo MOurning did his last few years. I hate that part; however, I love what it represents. It says that they care, that they're happy that they got the rebound. emotions. Something Hibbert lacks. As bad as Noah is on offense, he's way better than every other aspect of the game cmpared to Hibbert. HIs FT% and shooting might suck but he makes up for it by everything else. Also, Hibbert has proved that he can make a jump shot consistantly and that he can shoot FT%. But he dissapears after the 1st qt and gets paid 4x more than Noah so I think Hibbert deserves all the crap he gets and more."

pacers,35j38w,yobramine,0,Mon May 11 00:27:52 2015 UTC,"As a Bulls fan I honestly have been worried that Jo is going through a Hibbert-esque collapse. I can't say it's the same yet though, because for 1, Jo has never been good at scoring. He's a good facilitator but has never been seen as a good scorer. So when Hibbert's offense went from good to awful, it's not as bad as Jo going from bad to awful. Second, it's only been 10 games. This wasn't a thing until the playoffs started, and we're only through 4 games of the second round.   Lastly, Jo is only struggling on offense. When I say only I don't mean it's excusable, but it's different from Hibbert. Didn't he have a playoff game with 0 rebounds? He's 7'2 that shouldn't physically happen. Jo has been a monster in terms of rebounding, especially getting offensive rebounds.   From what I remember, Hibbert had an absolute total breakdown, while Jo has just had a complete breakdown in terms of scoring."

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genitalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.  Words per subscriber were obviously obtained by dividing the number of words used by the number of subscribers to the sub and the subscriber counts were taken at the time my scan took place.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying this year's word clouds."

pacers,34uw78,Pseudonova,3,Tue May 5 00:07:24 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I think he would thrive as a combo guard with full license to run the offense if he's really feeling it. The nights when he is running the floor and creating offense for teammates as well, he looks ridiculously good. I have huge bias though. Love me some George Hill."
pacers,34uw78,harmfulcow,1 point,Tue May 5 02:08:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, this exactly. I feel when he's faced up against a good on-ball defender he can really struggle to keep offensive possessions fluid and on time, if that makes any sense. When he's pressured by a good defender, the offensive timing breaks down and possessions just turn into contested jumpers and pressured drives. In those situations, I think he's better served at the 2. But the average defender has a tough time stopping him."
pacers,34uw78,Pseudonova,1 point,Tue May 5 23:08:45 2015 UTC,Paul george can take a lot of that load off him now.
pacers,34uw78,Drak_is_Right,1 point,Thu May 7 06:48:26 2015 UTC,"GHill was definitely the MVP of the team the whole season. We were like 36-17 with him. Every time he would have a good game we'd win. That being said, his more natural position is a two man and I wouldn't mind having a better backup. Our need is definitely at center and power forward at this point though, not necessarily at PG"
pacers,34uw78,ribull,-1,Tue May 5 02:13:14 2015 UTC,"I thought Hill had an awesome seaosn, but I still think he plays more like a SG than a PG. Wouldn't be a horrible idea to bring him in off the bench to sub both positions as needed. He is still not generating a lot of offense or getting 10+ assists all that often. He only had 3 games with 10+ assists this year and only 1 last year. I know our offense isn't assist heavy but for a starting point guard, those are pretty low numbers."
pacers,34uw78,Victory33,-1,Tue May 5 13:54:11 2015 UTC,"I think George Hill is the main reason why we need to upgrade at Point. We don't have anyone that can handle the ball. This is why we turn the ball over so many times. Without a mediocre or a gret point guard, how can we compete against d. rose/ kyrie & Wall in the east? I'm not asking for cp3 but an out of position George Hill or Donald Sloan won't do the trick."

pacers,34tdwl,Pacers31Colts18,4,Mon May 4 12:13:21 2015 UTC,"Yea, he'll be gone. His time spent with the Pacers didn't help him or the team. Maybe it's his fault, maybe it was just a poor fit from the get go, but it's most likely a mix of the two.   His days in the NBA are definitely numbered unless he improves or finds an ideal team for him...I think there's a chance somebody will offer him a one year contract (or some 10 day contracts), but since I simply cannot think of a team that would want him, those chances are slim in my mind."

There are times when he is god like, reigning down three's from the heavens.  But then he can go cold and be completely crap from the floor.  No one needs a shooter that goes cold.  I seriously wonder if he'll find a team home next year."
pacers,34tdwl,materhern,0,Mon May 4 17:10:17 2015 UTC,"IMO, the only thing he's good for is 3s. He does shoot them well if he's hot, I'll give him that. Other than that, he's terrible at everything else. D- defender, D- passer, can't drive it in. I'll take Rudez over him anyday of the week. Why would you go out clubbing (even if you weren't drinking) at 3AM the night before we were fighting for the playoffs? It took an incident like stabbing for us to realize that he's not the player we want in our locker room. I got a lot of heat for saying this but I don't care, he's not a good person to have in the locker room. He isn't serious enough. He wants to have fun first, win second. f that. adios amigo, hope you don't return. My grade for him this season? D-."

I watched all but three games of theirs this season and I can tell you he does not have a killer instinct. He doesn't flip a switch and start dominating, despite the lack of quality big men in the Big 12 this year. He lacks explosiveness physically and competitively.  I'd love to be wrong though."

There is a reason that you don't draft a guy who is immobile. Roy Hibbert is a constant reminder of what you get when you draft a guy who has foundation/stability issues. Hakeem Olajuwon is what happens when you get a guy who is on the other end of the spectrum.  Everything you describe of him is pretty much Roy 2.0  If we have to draft a center and WCS isn't available (Towns is gone for sure), I'd rather have Kaminsky over Turner. Hell, I'd even take Kelly Oubre over Turner."

pacers,34jxs5,h3isenburg,2,Fri May 1 22:23:00 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you. Thinking about the potential lineup of Hill, Miles, Evans, George, and West ( if he opts in, or insert potential draft pick here) would be great for better offense... Potentially. I love Roy and have been a big fan of his, even though last years abysmal last half and playoffs, plus this year.   I do think that as valuable as he is as a rim defender he is not going to get better offensively. I am just hesitant to give up a valuable defensive piece when that's what we have predicated on. I hope that Roy and the Pacers can part ways amicably. But I love this franchise and hope that we can develop into a perennial championship contender though the decisions made these next few years."
pacers,34jxs5,zayers35,3,Sat May 2 00:57:27 2015 UTC,that line up is awful 3 SFs and   no center. good luck playing defense and  we will have 1/10 possessions where Evans never passes the ball

pacers,34etfo,MarryMeFrisbee,5,Thu Apr 30 15:58:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to be negative or anything. But realistically, are we a championship contender next season with the roster we have?"
pacers,34etfo,Boom_Baby31,6,Thu Apr 30 16:08:13 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't see why not. I think our roster will look pretty different, but we could still pull anywhere from 1-4 when it comes to seeding in the East, while the Knicks will be struggling to crack the 7-8 seeds.   Paul George back is going to make a world of difference. IF George Hill plays like he did this season, then it's a new ball game. Plus we have Miles to dominate from behind the arc, Stuckey (if he returns) to add that scoring off the bench that we've never had and West will still be the team leader. I think Hibbert is out, so that might be our only issue, but they played well with Mahinmi, Scola or Allen in with West, so I don't think it's going to be some massive issue that most do."
pacers,34etfo,MarryMeFrisbee,2,Thu Apr 30 16:27:38 2015 UTC,That's a fair assessment. Thanks for that. Any opinion on who to draft?
pacers,34etfo,Boom_Baby31,3,Thu Apr 30 16:35:53 2015 UTC,"A lot is going to depend on where we end up. Would like to get a Center like Cauley-Stein, someone who can play defense and isn't so worried about his offensive numbers. I'm not big on Kaminsky, but after watching Meyers Leonard play these last couple games, maybe Kaminsky could be good. I'm a big fan of Montrezl Harrell, but think it's a reach for him in the Top 13. And then there is Trey Lyles, whom I don't know much about other than he is from Indy and played at Kentucky."
pacers,34etfo,Wafflecone416,2,Thu Apr 30 16:49:11 2015 UTC,"Cauley-Stein is basically another Hibbert with better pick and roll defense and worse rim protection. I for one am tired of the center spot being an offensive liability. During the tournament he was being guarded by Connaughton and Hayes, who are the size of NBA small forwards, and he still couldn't finish over them. The guy cannot finish to save his life, and thankfully he will be gone by the time we pick."

While I like the idea of getting a perimeter shooting big man, and think this offense could really be bolstered by it, I think he has a huge bust potential.  Defensively I can see him being a non-factor.  Thats a huge problem for a defensively minded team like the Pacers.  I also see his shooting ability being severely challenged at the NBA level.  If he's defensively inept, and cannot produce on offense, then he's of no use."
pacers,34a5ak,materhern,6,Wed Apr 29 15:15:36 2015 UTC,Please no
pacers,34a5ak,GingerLegs,7,Thu Apr 30 01:18:05 2015 UTC,"Kaminsky will be a bust in the NBA.   This isn't to say he won't be an effective player. But I don't see him being the same as he was in college or even close. To me he just doesn't have that 'it' factor that you talk about in your piece. The eye test just makes me think that he's peaked a little early in his career.  That being said, I REALLY think that the dark horse in the draft is WCS. He is overshadowed by Towns but I think that his particular skillset would be huge on the Pacers and I don't know how we would trade to get him but I think that his addition to the team could be the piece needed to get us over the top.   I have no real reason to say this other than a gut feeling, but I really truly believe he is the steal of the draft."
pacers,34a5ak,NateThomas1979,2,Wed Apr 29 18:26:06 2015 UTC,"""It"" factor...What does that mean? Sounds like something Skip Bayless would say. If ""it"" factor means does he show up in big moments, he certainly does. I also don't think he has peaked, he can improve in many different aspects of his game (defense included), and he can definitely get more athletic.   Personally, I think that Kaminsky isn't necessarily that poor of a choice ...he can stretch the defense and create room for PG to attack the rim. Sure, he'd be a gamble, but very few aren't outside of top 5 picks.   As for WCS, I really don't see what skillset you are talking about? His offense is beyond suspect, didn't show any improvement year after year...I think at the very best, he'd be a bit more mobile version of Hibbs."
pacers,34a5ak,pfc_bgd,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:00:15 2015 UTC,"He does show up in big moments in college. I give you that. I just am reminded of Christian Laettner who did make it to the NBA, but never really made the impact of the type of player I want to get.  I know we're not in the top 5, but I figure I trust Bird enough to follow his lead. Kaminsky can at least make his free throws and shoot the 3 ball, but how many centers/PF do you want to be shooting the 3 ball on a consistent basis?  And as far as my thoughts about WCS, Here's an interesting highlight reel, but the reason I link for it is that if you watch, you see him move down the court with the point guards. You also see that he has more than just a lob to the rim but a good shot mechanic and a couple of different post up moves. On top of all of that his FT% has gone up from .372 to .482 to now .617 this past year. It gives me encouragement in the one area that I always enjoy that Roy provides.  I think bottom line is that it comes down to if you want a stretch-4 or a 5. I'd really still like to keep a 5, I just want a more mobile one that can hit a 5-10 footer as well. The real issue with the Pacers offense IS that they can't trust Roy inside and so they keep on having to try to make something happen outside. He and Towns are essentially the same build but I think that watching them play he has more of a raw talent that can be molded.  Either way odds are that we won't have him available."
pacers,34a5ak,NateThomas1979,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:59:40 2015 UTC,"Your on point about WCS. He is 22 already and has close to zero touch around the basket. If he can't dunk it then he isn't finishing over people 90% of the time. This is a guy who was guarded by players the size of NBA small forwards a lot of the time in college and he still struggled to finish around the basket. He'd be a good pick in the middle of the first round, but whoever takes him in the top 10 is going to be really disappointed when he doesn't develop his offense."

I should adjust my above statement to say 'around' the league minimum as I don't think he is worth more than that. If you can sign him for 4-5mil, that would be where I see him and his next 2-3 years at.  For him I think that he recognizes that he has one more chance at a ring and if we can convince him of that, I don't think the money is going to be an issue."

He's not horrible though so he deserves to be in the NBA but I honestly don't think he will fit in what the Pacers want to do next season in a running, transition type game.   It'd be interesting to see what type of shot clock was the average for the Pacers while Sloan was on the court. It was not a fluke that they went from around a 30% win/loss record to a 50%+ w/l as soon as Hill came back from his injuries."

I think it will largely depend on who we get in the draft.  If we are able to pickup someone like Cauley-Stein or Turner, I think Mahinmi is probably expendable with the idea that our new draft pick take over Roys spot and Roy would be gone after next year."

So anyways, I see a Reggie Miller documentary from the ""Beyond the Glory"" series that Fox used to do(I think) and I found his career/story fascinating.

pacers,33l6gf,wocks,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:33:49 2015 UTC,"Honest questions. Is it possible that he doesn't take his option, either get traded or sign a one year deal somewhere. And then look to get a bigger contract with the new cba or whatever it is? Isn't that why LeBron signed a short deal? The opportunity for make more off a max contract? Not saying he's gonna bring max money. But if he goes somewhere and has a good year he could make good money. You can't teach seven foot. If you could sort out his head he might be a good investment for a team. And what's his other option? Plays out the rest of this year, has another year of decreased production, and makes less money. Take a risk big Roy. Obviously something isn't working here."
pacers,33l6gf,fear_the_kraken,3,Thu Apr 23 19:23:03 2015 UTC,"Pacers are actually in a fairly advantageous position regarding Roy, I think. At this point, it seems like the consensus is that he needs to go. The fans are saying it, and more importantly, the front office made it clear that they'd rather not have Roy back next season. But there's 15 million dollars just sitting on the table for him. Even if he's not feeling welcome, it would be hard for anybody to walk away from that.  I don't think he opts-out for a one-year deal because he'd be walking away from a ton of cash and, if he lays another egg next season, he'll have missed out on a ton of future money (both from the Pacers next season and in the future).  So if Roy decides to stay and collect his 15-mil, he'll be in the last season of his contract with a lot of doubt about his future in the NBA. If he wants any chance of signing another fat contract anywhere in the league, he's going to have to play his ass of this season and quiet the doubters. That's good for the Pacers. If Roy is engaged and playing hard, he's probably worth that money for his defensive presence alone.  On the other hand, if he's truly ready for a change of scenery--enough so that he's willing to walk away from all of that money--then it still benefits the Pacers because that's 15 million dollars they don't have to pay him. We can use it on somebody else.  All things considered, it's potentially a win-win for the Pacers, whatever Roy decides to do."
pacers,33l6gf,Einsteiniac,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:51:04 2015 UTC,You make some really good points. But what has caused the decline in his performance?  And has there been any teams linked to trade talks? The article mentioned Crash but if he's still under that contract from Brooklyn I really don't see how that helps us any.
pacers,33l6gf,fear_the_kraken,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:26:38 2015 UTC,"I've not heard of any teams that are interested. It came out recently that, prior to last season, arrangement were being made to send Roy to Portland but it didn't pan out.  As for what's causing his decline--it's anybody's guess. It's been documented that Roy has some issues with his mental game. I don't know if it's lack of concentration, lack of confidence, or something else. I hope he figures it out because I actually like the guy. I'm one of the people who stayed in his corner even after his dismal performance at the end of last season."
pacers,33l6gf,Einsteiniac,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:30:53 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, if he's truly ready for a change of scenery--enough so that he's willing to walk away from all of that money--then it still benefits the Pacers because that's 15 million dollars they don't have to pay him. We can use it on somebody else.   And he could sign a long term (4 year) deal somewhere if he opts out. His value has dropped from his last contract and he won't get anything close to that, but someone will offer him a nice contract. He is still an elite defender. It may be in his best interests to look for a long term deal this summer, instead of risking his value dropping even further or having an injury (which would definitely cost him more than $15M long term).   It's not crazy for him to leave it on the table and sign a 4 year deal somewhere this summer."
pacers,33l6gf,abowsh,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:16:19 2015 UTC,"Good point.  The two most likely situations, getting an inspired Roy for $15 million or Roy leaving for a new team, both benefit Indiana.   The least likely scenario is that he just opts in because he can't turn down the money and continues to suck/decline.  That's terrible for Hibbert's next contract and not good for Indy, even though they'd be rid of him soon enough after the season."
pacers,33l6gf,poorchris,1 point,Sun Apr 26 22:19:21 2015 UTC,Or he could take the option and demand a trade

If that is how it went down, his value would plummet even worse than it has, and he would be lucky to get a decent deal in FA. All this is assuming he is vocal about this and doesn't keep his trade demands in house.   If he is professional and does this behind closed doors, than I see us trading him at a reduced value, and having another year of mediocrity."
pacers,33l6gf,usmcmax,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:57:08 2015 UTC,He's going to be a 15 mil expiring. Either trade him at the deadline or keep him and sign someone next season with 15 mil coming off the books. You guys must stink at Association mode in 2K.

Their offense was all about ball movement and Ellis and Dirk in the pick and roll, and when Rondo got there those two two mainstays of their offense went away. Also, previously to Rondo being there they had a point guard who was able to space the floor which they needed for their offense to run when the point didn't have the ball. That also went away.   Put Rondo on the Pacers and you will see a much different player. He could assume the role he had on the Celtics and facilitate the offense. Hill and George are both better off the ball than with and with their spacing Rondo could have the room he needs in order to be effective. I think our offense would be better than it's ever been with Rondo running it.  I also think we could get him for fairly cheap since a lot of teams won't want to take a chance on him."

pacers,33jvg9,XC_Stallion92,2,Fri Apr 24 01:57:52 2015 UTC,"Although most people don't agree I think he would be a good fit. He obviously wasn't good in Dallas at all, but that doesn't mean he can't be good with us. Hill and PG play pretty good off the ball and since Rondo fits into our defensive scheme too. People forget fast that Rondo led top offenses not too long ago.  But still it is a risk and I would only take it, if he isn't too expensive."
pacers,33jvg9,TheAkimasu,2,Fri Apr 24 17:19:04 2015 UTC,"Hell no. He's an awful shooter, can't hit FTs, and isn't that great on D anymore. He's also a fucking awful teammate and has clashed with every coach he's ever had."

pacers,338sud,MoeAverage,8,Mon Apr 20 15:51:25 2015 UTC,"I feel like he did a lot better than Ian and Roy in a few areas, much younger, and has a little more spring in his bounce. Long-term backup PF/C spot down the road."
pacers,338sud,exWarlock,7,Mon Apr 20 16:00:19 2015 UTC,"As you mentioned, LaVoy is more likely to be a solid backup than he is to blossom into a starting big but I've heard talk about Hibbert's uncertain future.  Is it looking more likely that Roy will be gone soon, or that he'll transition to a bench role?  I ask because with LaVoy Allen sitting there, would he even be a useful rotation big that could take center minutes if needed?  How much more effective is he as a 4 versus a 5?"
pacers,338sud,poorchris,3,Mon Apr 20 16:46:59 2015 UTC,I think playing the 4 or 5 is match up based i didn't really understand why he didnt get more minutes against the sttetch 4's and 5's but I also didn't see every game
pacers,338sud,MoeAverage,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:34:03 2015 UTC,Roy will probably sign with Portland

pacers,338sud,scottw5150,4,Mon Apr 20 16:41:41 2015 UTC,"I think we should resign him. I think his best case scenario is being a rotation backup. He's  26 so that doesn't leave a whole lot of room to grow, but I think he can be a solid backup piece. Can't imagine he will be too expensive either."
pacers,338sud,scottw5150,4,Mon Apr 20 16:43:33 2015 UTC,"Definitely should resign him. He's a better FT shooter than Ian, and he doesn't stop offense nearly as much as Hibbs. While he probably won't ever produce the defense Roy does, he doesn't grind offense to a halt either. He's a solid backup C/PF, and there's no reason we should let him slip away."
pacers,338sud,Siggycakes,2,Mon Apr 20 20:22:36 2015 UTC,"Really good court vision. That would be my .02.   He's not the best at any of the metrics usually determined as measures of a PF, but at the same time he doesn't really have too many serious flaws either. I see him as a solid backup for whoever does play the starting role and if he can get a decent jumper, then he could probably even splash into starting minutes."

pacers,338sud,mrwow91,1 point,Wed Apr 22 02:10:26 2015 UTC,"We honestly don't need him to score more than nine. Rebounding and defense is crucial for our big man and I think he would be great, for the right price. As far as other free agents of like if affordable is Stuckey, and Luis Scola(for moral reasons rather than stat line)."
pacers,335z9m,h3isenburg,5,Sun Apr 19 21:36:39 2015 UTC,"Next year? Nobody...following year? Not saying this is who we should go after...and I realize it's full of Indiana guys, which I hate about people in Indiana, wanting to sign only Indiana guys.  PG  Conley  Lillard  SG  Oladipo  LaVine  Gary Harris  PF  Vonleh  C  Olynyk  Gobert"
pacers,335z9m,Pacers31Colts18,3,Sun Apr 19 23:04:07 2015 UTC,"I've been in love with the idea of throwing money at Oladipo since Lance left. We learned two big things this year:  1.) Hibbert, while still a defensive beast, isn't worth his contract and most certainly won't be worth a renewal of a cost even close to what we pay him now. Losing him would free up big money.  2.) G. Hill proved he can really turn it up a notch and lead a team in clutch moments. However, he cannot do it alone, and he certainly can't carry an offense entirely by himself either. He needs another top tier backcourt counterpart. Enter Oladipo.  'Dipo's good enough (and has a high enough ceiling imo) that he could relieve George of his PG duties and move him to the 2. With Vic as a rising star and G. Hill and Paul all starting players, I think this team could really be an offensive threat to any team."
pacers,335z9m,mooney2j,4,Mon Apr 20 01:53:17 2015 UTC,"Hibbert lost all his ""Defensive Beast"" credibility when he let Marc Gasol reach a career high in a must-win scenario."

pacers,335z9m,NateThomas1979,2,Mon Apr 20 04:47:50 2015 UTC,"I think that SG is a position that while not at the bottom of the chart, is not something that needs to be 'fixed' with the additions of Miles and Stuckey on our team. Both have shown to be able to score 20-30 points in a game and with PG back that is enough imo to add to the Pacers, especially if we're playing a more uptempo game which I think suits both of them very well.  I'd love to see us pick up a running big man. Olynyk is available, but I'd rather see us pick up a dark horse in Tyson Chandler.   Reasoning being that Chandler still gives us the defensive presence and rebounding abilities. I also would trade straight up for Brook Lopez who I think would fit really well with the Pacers."
pacers,335z9m,exWarlock,1 point,Mon Apr 20 19:34:07 2015 UTC,I also would trade straight up for Brook Lopez who I think would fit really well with the Pacers.   Seeing this move made me want Brook Lopez really bad.
pacers,335z9m,SiRyEm,3,Tue Apr 21 02:43:17 2015 UTC,"Depends mostly on the offensive style chosen. The Pacers have always been about smash mouth defense. Putting our offense a distant second in the past. It seems though, that now they are realizing keeping today's teams under 100 points is tougher than it was 5 years ago.   Of our normal starters only Hibbert is a true liability. And that stems entirely on his inconsistency. West has been a great leader, but his time to be in a run and gun offense are long past. And I don't know if we can keep counting on him to bang down low on both ends.   We don't have a reliable pure 3 point shooter like a Korver and could definitely use someone to spread the floor for George and Hill. I think Hill showed he could handle the point while George was away, but I think having someone to pass to outside will bring great relief.   Is Mark Jackson still available to run point?"
pacers,335z9m,scottw5150,2,Mon Apr 20 19:29:18 2015 UTC,Nice list man. I think Lillard/Oladipo would be a dream come true. I have watched the majority of these players and I like them. You think our best chance is a trade or waiting for a FA? (Draft prospects take years to develop unless you have a top 5 pick)
pacers,335z9m,scottw5150,3,Mon Apr 20 01:53:29 2015 UTC,"Just wondering, you constantly complain about George Hill being a liability on defense, a turnover machine, and a poor offensive player. Do you realize that Lillard is one of the worst defensive PGs, averages nearly double the turnovers and shoots a worse percentage on four more shots a game?  I get that he has more of the ""it"" factor, but still."
pacers,335z9m,ISUCKATKARMA,1 point,Mon Apr 20 16:58:00 2015 UTC,"Lillard is the main option on the Blazers (sometimes switching with Aldrich) on offense. He holds the ball a lot more. He's a better passer;therefore, will pass more creating more turnovers. He's shooting worse because the Balzers play more teams in the West and not 4 games per year against the Pistons/Knicks/Magic etc. I'm watching replays of every Pacers games day by day and if Hill is our best player (after PG-13) then we have absolutely no chance for the next decade. I'M not saying I would grade him as a F but he's a C (average) player and 8 mil a year for that isn't good."
pacers,335z9m,SpittaRansghetti,1 point,Mon Apr 20 20:44:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to make a case that Hill should be our number two guy, but I still think he can be a starter as the Pacers contend. In my opinion, you are arguing against Lillard. Aldridge is the number one option on the Blazers, not Lillard (although it sounds like that might change next year). The Blazers-Grizzlies game is a good example of why Aldridge is number one. The argument that he holds the ball more REALLY discredits him. When you have Matthews, Affalo, Aldridge why would you hold onto the ball more? is one more assist per game really worth the extra one and a half turnovers? You can argue that Lillard played better teams, but you can also argue that Hill was more successful with having less. Lillard isn't going to win a title as the first or second option. Higher end role players get 8 million. And Hill has earned every bit of that. I know we won't agree on this, but I think you are severely discrediting Hill."
pacers,335z9m,MoeAverage,0,Tue Apr 21 03:16:06 2015 UTC,"What?  We nearly beat the Heat in ECF with Lance as our second best.  I think it's been shown that PG13 can carry the team perfectly fine, he just needs some supporting pieces and Hill is a great one at that.  And cmon now, do you really think we have a shot at getting Dipo or Lilliard?  Let's not get completely delusional here..."
pacers,335z9m,MoeAverage,2,Mon Apr 20 21:39:32 2015 UTC,"vonleh? Hell no. Now Gobert, that would b awesome. Picking him up and another person to help score we would be set."

pacers,335z9m,Pacers31Colts18,2,Mon Apr 20 01:07:10 2015 UTC,Interesting thing about Ersan: Great jump shooter and a above average 3 pt shooter but he's really bad at FTs. How is that even possible?
pacers,335z9m,Pacers31Colts18,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:54:09 2015 UTC,Yeah that's my number one pet peeve is missed free throws but if we were going to do small ball i think he'd be a great fit
pacers,335z9m,ls215,4,Mon Apr 20 09:43:28 2015 UTC,I think we are contenders next year  with minimal change we draft a solid rookie and sigh a solid bench piece and bring back stucky
pacers,335z9m,ls215,1 point,Mon Apr 20 04:13:31 2015 UTC,"We will be the 4th or maybe 5th best team in the East next year, let alone the league. We will not be anywhere near close to contending for the NBA Championship with our current squad. I def agree on bringing back stucky so what player are you thinking of signing? I have to look at the FAs coming up but I don't see us having any $ to sign a nice bench piece."
pacers,335z9m,Drak_is_Right,3,Mon Apr 20 04:42:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that I agree with this. Getting back PG at 100% will make up for a lot of short falls we had this year. Cleveland is the only sure fire team to me cause of LeBron. Chicago has injury issues, Toronto/Washington/Atlanta are the other consistent playoff teams right now and I'm assuming Washington will be getting a new coach. Horford has had injury issues, Milsap, Carroll, Antic are all free agents. Toronto has some free agents but not any of their top guys...so basically I find Cleveland, Toronto, and a bunch of unkowns after that, us included."
pacers,335z9m,Drak_is_Right,1 point,Mon Apr 20 15:41:05 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking Cleveland, Chicago & Atlanta will have a better record than us assuming the teams are the same and healthy. Cleveland is all up to Lebron. Chicago plays tough even without Rose and that's scary. I don't see those guys going anywhere next year in Atlanta but I could be wrong. I think George Hill is our 2nd best player after PG-13 and IMO, george hill is no where near the 2nd best player from Cle/Chi/Atl. If Beal improves a level or Wizards get another legit player, I think Wizards will be hard to beat too. I'm not too worried about Toronoto because they only have Derozen and Lowery isn't the type of player that will win you games in the playoffs. I think time will tell but IMO, the current squad we have won't be top 3 in the East next year."
pacers,335z9m,iAMtHESushighost,2,Mon Apr 20 20:49:50 2015 UTC,Those are three big free agents for Atlanta. I can't imagine them being able to lock up all three. I would also say that the Pacers with PG is a better team than the Bulls without Rose.

pacers,334e17,Pacers31Colts18,2,Sun Apr 19 12:47:44 2015 UTC,"Come on Roy, you know you want to opt out! Do it!   And honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if he does well elsewhere, but we have seen more of the same year after year after year here...if he does turn into a decent center, it will not be here."
pacers,334e17,pfc_bgd,2,Sun Apr 19 13:38:12 2015 UTC,"I cringed when we matched Portland's offer sheet. I was disappointed at the time and thought it was waaaayyy to costly to keep him. Then it looked like he was genuinely putting in the time and effort to get better and thought we could be on the way to having a dominant center. But the last 2 years have been disheartening. Its going to hurt on defense if he leaves, but I think after a period of adjustment we will be better off in the long run.   I hate to speak ill of him since I think he's legitimately given us what he's capable of, but unfortunately its doesnt seem to be enough. He just disappears for long stretches, were talking multiple games at a time.   Im not sure how we will replace him, even if we go smaller. But I feel like its time to find out. I suspect thats where Larry and Frank are at as well."
pacers,334e17,at2wells,8,Sun Apr 19 13:32:07 2015 UTC,"Even if he doesn't do anything this year, that was a good deal. He led the Pacers defense and they were championship contenders for two years."
pacers,334e17,PaulGeorgeHill,3,Sun Apr 19 15:45:19 2015 UTC,"Thats why I hesitate to criticize him. We were contenders. Though its entirely possible that we would have been anyway's, considering we have no way to know what the roster makeup would have been. All things considered it was an OK deal. We certainly didnt get value on the deal, and Id say we didnt get anywhere near the production that contracts of that magnitude would be expected to produce.   Im not mad about it because we were contenders. But at the end of the day I feel like its best if both sides part ways. Roy is just way to helter skelter to be depended upon in the scoring and rebounding departments. To his credit, his rim protection is beyond reproach."
pacers,334e17,at2wells,1 point,Sun Apr 19 17:21:32 2015 UTC,If he opts in for the Pacers won't he be a great trade asset because of his big expiring contract?

pacers,333jqn,ChronicBubonic,3,Sun Apr 19 09:59:37 2015 UTC,idk. i hate every1 but the Pacers. Bucks because they classic? Mavericks would be fine too. i live in San Antonio so its great when Mavs when. all the spurs fans so pissed
pacers,333jqn,bamahoosier,5,Sun Apr 19 12:13:24 2015 UTC,"I'm pulling for the Warriors.  Right now, though, I'm just laughing my ass off at Washington vs. Raptors.  Let's face it we could probably win the series against either of them with a broken PG and your typical basketball court whiteboard."

Also, he is pretty much at his ceiling as far as potential goes, (4-year player, senior). Translation: FK may be the best ready now option, but if you hope not to draft in the lottery for a while, why not swing for the fences? That's what happened with Paul George at pick 10."
pacers,3323rl,mrpooh31,2,Sun Apr 19 04:49:27 2015 UTC,Pretty good assessment I think your right on. Stuckey has said he wants to stay next year and I dont think scola is gonna fetch much in free agency. Bird says he wants Allen to have a bigger role next year so he will stay too.   We aren't going to so much this year but next off season will be very interesting

Next year: We will win 44 games. 6th or 7th seed. Depending on off season moves, we will maybe lose in the 2nd round or maybe 1st.   Unless PG has another all-star to play with, we will be a 6th-8th seed for the next decade because D. Rose and LBJ are going to rule the East. Plain and simple.   Please cut and paste this and put it on your desktop so maybe you can also spread the word.   EDIT: 4th-6th seed in the East."
pacers,3323rl,wocks,-11,Sun Apr 19 21:20:29 2015 UTC,"Hibbert and West will eat up a combined 27.5 Million next year. We can't do anything next year until Hibbert/West and George Hills contracts are up which basically means that we will be a 7th or 8th seed next year. I would like to resign Scola and Stucky but it can't exceed 4MIL/year. West is aging, Hibbert is done & George Hill is inconsistent. PG will be recovering all year next year because he thinks he's super man and wants to play 8 months after his leg snapped like a twig.   So... the team next year? It will be a sad year as we will lose in the first round and rebuild again next year.   Don't kid yourselves and don't hate or be upset. This is the truth and it is what it is.   Until we get a true point guard and another all/super star to play with PG, we're not going anywhere. Chicago and Cleveland will rule the east for the next decade unless we make changes.   Thank you HIbbert and George Hill for taking this franchise to the ground. Pure garbage."
pacers,3323rl,iLikeUreddit,5,Sat Apr 18 21:49:08 2015 UTC,im convinced you have never watched this team play if you hate G Hill that guy was balling so fucking hard for the last half of the year when he was healthy. He  hit several clutch shots vs the wizards and the thunder
pacers,3323rl,wocks,-3,Sun Apr 19 00:48:04 2015 UTC,"hah. Dude! Hill has messed up more games (like the most important game of the season) than he has helped us win. This guy is as soft as they come. Yeah he can score points here and there but paying 8 mil for a guy that can't play D & turns the ball over at crucial positions isn't a good move. If Bird and Co. regret this contract then who are we? LMAOOOOOO This guy never balled ""hard."" hwhahaha"

pacers,3323rl,ChronicBubonic,0,Mon Apr 20 20:32:24 2015 UTC,"maybe. Doesn't change the fact that he gets outplayed by a 3rd string player in the biggest game of the year. He's slightly above average on scoring but overall he's a C maybe C- player. Meaning, we can do better for 8 mil for a SG/6th man."

pacers,3323rl,ChronicBubonic,-3,Sun Apr 19 21:12:25 2015 UTC,"lol. Yes I did sir/mam. The conclusion that I came up with is that Hibbert is so garbage and that his contract is so big that delusional fans like you were so happy to have him on the team. Now.... NOW... people like Larry Bird and Vogel are starting to realize that they had made a mistake. It looks like you were happy with us losing in the ECF in a row, specially getting blown out in clutch games when Hibbert would have 0 points and 0 rebounds. Lol were you watching? You know that D. Rose didn't play 3 years right? You know that if he wold'v played, it would've been Chicago Vs. Heat the last 3 years in a row? ddi you? no. lol twat. Start with the WNBA kid.... then come to the big  boys table."
pacers,3323rl,h3isenburg,2,Sun Apr 19 21:16:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not defending Hibbert. His offense and body language makes my balls itch, and he's mentally weak. I'm all for getting him out. Like it or not though, he and Hill both played a major role in getting our team that far in the playoffs. Also cut the misogyny. It makes you sound even more like an asshole."
pacers,3323rl,IM_A_WAIL,-1,Sun Apr 19 21:47:29 2015 UTC,"facts are facts man. NBA > WNBA. I don't think I'm sexist in saying that. I agree that they have taken us ""far"" in the playoffs but that's my point: The East is weak and we are supposed to reach there. That was the bare minimum and yes, they did that. They did not; however, exceed that. If Rose played, we wouldn't even be discussing this right now. My whole point is that Hibbert (specially) and Hill are not only killing our cap space but aren't worth keeping around due to their inconsistent and soft plays. George Hill can't keep up with a 3rd string point guard. I can't imagine what will happen next year when he goest against Rose/Kyrie/Wall.  EDIT:  someone made a good point in saying that it was a back to back 2OT game, etc. Not an excuse. You won't see good/great players getting outplayed by 3rd string players. It just doesn't happen. At the end of the game, when we had a SMAAAAAALLLLLLLLLL chance at a come back, George Hill turned the ball over and the other team got an And1 thanks to George Hills terrific defense."

I think he just needs his confidence back and with PG coming back it'll only help him. He may not be as good as he once was, but that's okay. A full strength pacers team is fantastic with him playing competitive basketball.  And when he's surrounded by strong players than the focus is less on his offense. I think he'll be much better next season. Hibbert island can include me on the population census, I'm not ready to give up on him yet."

pacers,32yooy,imkunu,3,Fri Apr 17 23:33:07 2015 UTC,"His blocks, steals, and assists are all down from previous years. His shooting percentage is the 2nd worst it has ever been along with his free throw percentage (Putting his overall shooting at his 2nd worst this year. His only year shooting that was worse was last year).  The press conference is 100% absolutely correct, this is statistically his worst year since his rookie year. By a decent margin to. I have faith in him, but he severely under performed this season. I mean he had 60 less blocks in only 5 less games from last season, almost 1 less every game.   Really the only big improvement he has seemed to make is turning the ball over less. What stats are you looking at?"
pacers,32yooy,Galt2112,0,Sat Apr 18 01:52:16 2015 UTC,what stats  are you reading ? becuse he is at carrear average or above  for almost everything  that is down is by less than 1 we talking fucking decimals here holy fuck   oh and he shot a  cerrear high free throw percentage    so again WTF are you reading
pacers,32yooy,JWarrenM,2,Sat Apr 18 02:40:43 2015 UTC,"The stats you linked.   Look at them. I will put the difference from this year to his career average: This year (career avg) Improvement/Difference  FG%: .446 (.464) -1.8%, FT%: .824 (.748) +7.6%, ORB: 156 (192) -36, DRB: 384 (326) +58, TRB: 540 (518) -22, AST: 84 (110) -26, STL: 18 (29) -11, BLK 125 (141) -16, TOV: 107 (133) +26, PF: 216 (245) +29, PTS: 802 (844) -42.  Literally the only areas he has improved are in free throw percentage, defensive rebounds, turnovers, and personal fouls. Every single other stat has taken a decent step back. These numbers also account for his rookie year before he was a started, take those low numbers out and even his improving numbers won't looks so great for 7 years in.  He is not a bust, he just is absolutely nothing special at all. At least not the way he is playing now. 26 less assists, 16 less blocks, 36 less offensive rebounds. This shit matters so much more than a center improving their free throw game or getting less fouls.    down is by less than 1 we talking fucking decimals here holy fuck   Most of his stats are down by double that, if we are talking percentage wise. That matters, a fuck ton."

I don't envision any major market FA trying to come to Indiana, it doesn't create that kind of interest in free agency that other cities do (LA, NYC, MIA, etc.). I think Hibbert is at least for the next 2-3 years important to the Pacers. We won't get anything for him in a trade that's worthwhile (as has been said) and giving him a raise CANNOT be on the table, he simply doesn't impact the game enough to warrant more money than he's currently making. I'd like to see us draft a big man in the draft, and see what we can do with that."

pacers,32yooy,poorchris,1 point,Sat Apr 18 19:43:29 2015 UTC,"it comes down to this. He gets paid way too much for how he plays. If we keep on playing him, we're wasting our time. We're not going anywhere. If we don't pplay him or trade him, we can, oh i don't know, start with a new center? Maybe try out a few? Chances are, the first C we bring is going to be worse than Hibbert but not by that much. Let's face it, we fucked up by giving this guy a max contract and it ruined our chances for championship 2-3 years in a row. Plain and simple. You must like failure."

pacers,32yooy,h3isenburg,1 point,Sat Apr 18 19:42:50 2015 UTC,it is though because only 2 teams do it and its one step from the finals  we have been one step from the finals twice.  We where stopped by the best player in a generation possibly ever and  ROY was a big part of why we where even there  the east is weaker with the heat gone  the cavs are no where near as good as that team was
pacers,32yooy,TonofSoil,0,Sat Apr 18 19:44:42 2015 UTC,"Like I said, ECF is nothing to be proud of. The teams that we beat those years were garbage. If Chicago had D. Rose, we wouldn't have made those ECF and it would've been Heat Vs. the Bulls. I hope you know that. Our squad isn't tough and Roy is as soft as they come. As slow as they come. As heartless as they come. All he can do is shoot free throws (which doesn't mean shit becuase he attemtps like 3 per game) and he jumps up to protect the rhim. This deal with Hibbert will arguably go down as one of the worst deals in the history of the Pacers.   If anything, it's the complete opposite of what you think. HIBBERT is the reason why we haven't gotten past the ECF & he's def. not the reason why we made the ECF."

The best quality of Hibbert besides rim protection and culture is the fact that he's a bigman who actually hits free throws. That changes the entire dynamic for teams at the end of games. If Hibbert rebounds a desperate chuck, seeing that he's the 2nd best free throw shooter on the team teams will be even more hesitant to immediately foul him."

That changes the entire dynamic for teams at the end of games. If Hibbert rebounds a desperate chuck, seeing that he's the 2nd best free throw shooter on the team teams will be even more hesitant to immediately foul him.   Hibbert hits FT's when he rarely ends up at the line (only 2.7 FTA's this season, lowest since his rookie season where he played 14 MPG).  But how does that help a team when he can't get to the line for easy opportunities anyway?    It's a pretty desperate stretch to say, ""another good quality of Roy's is that he can't get hacked by other teams to shoot FT's.""  Only embarrassingly bad FT shooters get that treatment, DeAndre Jordan, Dwight Howard, and they get that treatment because they shoot 70% & 60% from the field respectively.  Roy has 46 FG% for his career, and in the last three seasons he's actually been below that mark (44% average).  That'd be acceptable for a guard.  The most troubling thing about Hibbert's game isn't even his efficiency though, it's how soft he is.  DeAndre and Dwight shoot high percentage shots because they're aggressive attacking the rim.  They're not settling for even 10 footers or jump shots.  91.8% of DeAndre Jordan's FGA's come within 3 ft of the basket.  62.4% for Dwight Howard.  Hibbert only takes 21% of his FGA's from 3 ft and in.  That's astounding for a guy who's 7'2""."
pacers,32yooy,h3isenburg,1 point,Sat Apr 18 18:58:38 2015 UTC,"I understand that Hibbert doesn't attack the rim enough but the reason why guys like Deandre, Dwight and Tyson Chandler only shoot directly under the rim is because they have no moves and no range. In fact the whole gameplan for them is to clean up the garbage down under and get the team an easy 2 points.   However Indiana doesn't have that luxury. It's not even a secret that you guys struggle to generate offence for extended stretches during games. I've seen some games where the shot clock is winding down and Hibbert needs to take a contested midrange J...that's not ideal, you would almost never see that in Houston or LAC."
pacers,32yooy,h3isenburg,2,Sun Apr 19 15:41:51 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong i like Hibbert , love his defense, but we can all agree he's not a $15 mill a year guy (thanks Portland). He has the option this off season to stay for another $15 mill or leave and test free angency, i think this whole ""small ball"" talk is just a ploy to make him think about opting out since he'll think he wont be getting any playing time. Genius move if it works, if it doesn't work you now have a disgruntled guy who will be eating $15 mill a year and will demand a trade thus lowering his trade value even more. Either way, next year ought to be interesting."
pacers,32yooy,h3isenburg,0,Fri Apr 17 21:17:18 2015 UTC,I hope for him to have a redemption year  next year i am ok with us playing some small ball but i think we will still play big most of the time  and they are just trying to motivate him.

Honestly, I won't judge the Pacers management for the pick till years later.  They afterall will have spent a LOT more time researching the guys then me and their individual fit.  I always find the mock-draft raters to be laughable.  They spend a hundredth of the total time the scouts and execs do who make the picks.  One guy cannot replicate the work done by the staff at 30 different NBA franchises."
pacers,3321rc,h3isenburg,3,Sat Apr 18 19:37:17 2015 UTC,Man did you even watch the season? We had one of the most injured teams in the league with our star player our and our arguably second best player leaving in the offseason. We put up a hell of a fight this year and it was evident almost every night by how hard we played. I for one am damn proud of this years team
pacers,3321rc,ntvtaylor33,0,Sat Apr 18 19:55:03 2015 UTC,I did watch it. Every. Single. GAme. It was one disappointment after next. I'm not mad. Did they try? Oh yes. They played hard. Was PG injured all year? Yes. Lance is out? yup. It doesn't matter. The Utah Jazz shouldn't have a better record than us. Proud? hah. Ok. Hibbert and Hill are the reason why we lose year in and year out. It can't be more obvious than that.
pacers,3321rc,Deschain80,1 point,Sat Apr 18 20:30:53 2015 UTC,Lance isn't even on the roster..
pacers,3321rc,bshongboy,0,Sun Apr 19 00:31:31 2015 UTC,"by me saying Lance is out? I mean that he's out of our squad, he went to another team. sorry, bad grammar."
pacers,3321rc,bshongboy,2,Sun Apr 19 00:37:41 2015 UTC,"Well, Utah led the league in defensive points per game, a little better than our Pacers, and their offensive points per game is pretty similar to ours. Utah isn't as bad as you would like to think they are. Hayward and Gobert are turning into monsters, and Burke and Exum were decent (though inconsistent). This season was not as big of a disappointment as you're making it out to be. What did you expect, another number one seed?"
pacers,3321rc,bshongboy,-1,Sat Apr 18 21:22:27 2015 UTC,"I expected us to be out of the playoffs. Instead, PG came back, we gained some ""fake"" confidence and made a run only to get blown out by the biggest game of our season. Just like last year. Blow outs, 2 years in a row, on games that meant do or die. This team is a dissapointment. Hibbert and George Hill are two of the most overpaid players in recent Pacers history. They're the reason why we lose in the playoffs. Hibbert gets outplayed every time and George Hill is ridiculously soft. He can't defend a WNBA player on his best day. BTW, that garbage stat (I hate it when people bring stats, it's a scapegoat) you brought up about Utah allowing the least PPG in the league. You're right; however, the next 9 teams had a better FG%. That's why your stat doesn't mean anything. What it really means is that UTAH on offense, hold the ball for a long time; therefore, the opponents do not shoot as many shots as they normally would. If you look at the opponents FG%, Utah is in the middle of the pack at 14. Is their offensive PPG similar or better than us? Yeah, that's my point. That garbage team shouldn't mimic us on anything besides Roy Hibberts skill set."
pacers,3321rc,Pacers31Colts18,1 point,Sat Apr 18 21:33:28 2015 UTC,"I won't disagree with you about Hibbert, but George Hill isn't really overpaid seeing as he's pretty much the 3rd best player on the team. He's just kind of inconsistent.  As for the game against Memphis, PG got hurt again, which most likely caused a bit of discouragement, and the Grizz are a really good team that were playing for a higher playoff seed. In the Nets game, they were down until the Magic just decided to stop playing. Everything kind of lined up against us going into the last game.  And last year, they were limping the whole way through the playoffs. That that series even got to six games is a minor miracle."
pacers,3321rc,bshongboy,-1,Sat Apr 18 21:42:57 2015 UTC,"If George HIll was ocnsistant, he'd be worth every penny but he's not. On top of that, he's a terrible defender. The season was on the line and he got outplayed by a 3rd, not 2nd string point guard from Memphis. I refuse to believe that George Hill is any good when the games are on the line. Maybe he's a good regular season player when players don't play that hard but when it's crunch time, the opponents eat him alive.   The Memphis game was done when David West was pulled out of the game early. We had a nice lead and when he went out, the two bigs (gasol/randolph) played extremely well. This game should've been way closer than it was. They were missing two starters and we just got our super star back. Even the Vegas boys (which are usually right) had the Pacers winning that game by 2.5. This team just didn't perform. They got blown out, 2 years in a row when it mattered the most. Last year, only Lance the idiot showed up. Everyone else just gave up and it was pathetic to watch. Our team has no heart and it hurts. I would never abandon our team; however, players are another story.   write it down or take a picture: As long as Roy Hibbert and George Hill start for our team, we will not win a ring."

Not because of their game performance, but because of their off court conduct.  West has a much better attitude about all of this.  He is a team leader no matter how he plays.  Hibbert only leads the team in rim protection and bitching. (At least now that lance gtfo).   Hibbert has a place on this team, but it isn't the role he's contracted into atm.  And in all honesty, I'm not sure he's prepared or matured enough to take on the role we need from him."

Yeah, his numbers weren't spectacular this year, but I feel his presence in the locker room is just as important as anything he does on the court.  Especially if the Pacers were to pick up a PF/C in the lottery this year (Trey Lyles, anyone?), West could do wonders in helping the young gun adjust to NBA life over the course of a year.    As Far as Roy goes, good riddance.  Don't get me wrong, I love Roy as a human, but aside from his defense at the rim, he was nothing short of a disappointment this year.  No PG to control the offense and demand shots and no Lance to swoop in and steal rebounds and Roy still puts up the same averages as last year.  I'd be all for him declining his option to resign with the team for, say $6 or $7m, but that sounds more like a fantasy. Sadly, I predict Roy to accept ridiculous option and get paid stupid money to be nothing but a role player off the bench next year.."

pacers,32xkz0,exWarlock,5,Fri Apr 17 15:32:00 2015 UTC,"1.) I don't see why Roy doesn't pick up his option. He isn't getting that much money somewhere else at this point.  2.) We'll probably be hearing a lot of trade rumors for him since he'll be an expiring contract when he does pick up his option.  3.)

Focusing on competing with the Hawks and Cavs, which play small, so Roy's out of the picture. If he picks up his option, he'll be a $15 mil. liability.   I like this direction. As much as I love that the Pacers have been a defensive powerhouse for the last few seasons, it's not going to get them to the ship."

You cannot easily find a big who can defend as well as him and score at a high level, those type of players are one of the most coveted in the league for a reason.  That said, I do agree that we need to find some more mobile bigs who can stretch the floor and play at a higher tempo. Whether this means parting with Roy/West this offseason, I don't know"

pacers,32xt9r,Sheffield178,6,Fri Apr 17 16:34:49 2015 UTC,I'm not sure I want to give anyone the max honestly.
pacers,32xt9r,NateThomas1979,0,Fri Apr 17 16:39:23 2015 UTC,why? This would be the best season to do it if a player is close to deserving.
pacers,32xt9r,NateThomas1979,3,Fri Apr 17 16:58:14 2015 UTC,"Well my point is that giving players high end contracts really hasn't helped us at all. I think that giving them quality contracts is a good thing since we are a small market team, but when we traded for G.Hill we gave him a strong contract that hurt us a bit with picking up other talents. We gave Roy a max deal and since then we were screwed at chasing after immediate impact players or All-stars.  I'm open to the idea of getting Green, but I don't think after these past years that I'm comfortable giving anyone immediately a max contract is all."
pacers,32xt9r,daymanxx,3,Fri Apr 17 17:04:25 2015 UTC,max contracts this year will be considered very quality contracts in just a few years.
pacers,32xt9r,solowb32,1 point,Sat Apr 18 02:33:15 2015 UTC,The blazers gave hibbert the max. Indy was forced to match.

pacers,32xt9r,Gr8WallofChinatown,3,Wed Apr 29 21:19:41 2015 UTC,"Absolutely would love it.  They want to play small and he complements George and Hill incredibly well.  I'm just pissed because I was furious when Legend picked Plumlee over Green back in 2012.  I loved the kid when he was at MSU and I think he'd be a perfect fit for the culture and the team in Indy.  Plus, with the cap going up, Indy can afford to throw this cap's max contract at him because it'll be more like a 70% max going forward."

pacers,32xt9r,DayGrr,2,Fri Apr 17 17:29:06 2015 UTC,He is a dpoy candidate and will almost surely get a max this summer.
pacers,32xt9r,scottw5150,6,Fri Apr 17 17:34:42 2015 UTC,Not from us
pacers,32xt9r,MC_Reagan,1 point,Fri Apr 17 17:38:31 2015 UTC,Roy Hibbert is a better rim protector and averages 11 and 7 yet the Pacers want to get rid of them.  Why would they give a max to a guy who plays SF (a loaded position for Indy) and only averages 11 and 8.  That would be like throwing money out the window.
pacers,32xt9r,herrrr-me-nerrrr,4,Fri Apr 17 17:39:32 2015 UTC,Because they want to play small.  Green can easily play both 3 and 4.

We really shouldn't look at anything else but the games vs Boston and Brooklyn that happened between March 14th and April 1st. 4 games, 2 at home and 2 away against direct competitors for the last two spots. And we went 0-4. 1-3 would have done it, 2-2 would have be enough for the 7th seed potentially.   And after all that, with the help of some good fortune, we were given a 2nd shot at it. And failed again.   Simply didn't deserve it. Oh well."
pacers,32vefn,cgaff,13,Fri Apr 17 01:00:41 2015 UTC,"Pacers started in the ABA. They won 3 championships. One of only four teams to be accepted into the NBA during the 1976 merger. They've also been a professional basketball team since 1967.  The Pacers basically sucked from 1976 until 1987. The biggest travesty was making a trade with the Trail Blazers in 1984, giving away their first round pick for a center. That center didn't work out and the pick became the #2 overall pick. The same one the Trail Blazers used on Sam Bowie. WE COULD HAVE HAD JORDAN!!!! Wasn't even alive and it's still soul crushing to me.  1987 we got Reggie Miller. #BOOMBABY. 1988 we got Rik Smits. From there the team took off. Became of formidable foe to the Chicago Bulls and New York Knicks in the 90s. Finally made the NBA Finals in 2000, but went up against the Kobe/Shaq juggernaut Lakers.   The Brawl took place in 2004. Miller retired at the end of the season. Everyone was basically traded over the next couple years. Danny Granger became our only good player for five years.  Then came the current era. We stole Hibbert in the draft in a trade, somehow convinced David West to take less money to play for us instead of Boston, drafted Paul George who no one even knew at the time and traded the eventual Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard for George Hill on draft night. (That one stings too, but not as much as Jordan since we wouldn't have likely draft Kawhi anyways.)  And that basically gives you a small scope overview of the Pacers 48 year history.   Edit: Words and spelling"
pacers,32vefn,Boom_Baby31,2,Fri Apr 17 02:31:28 2015 UTC,The ABA was our bitch.
pacers,32vefn,HowDo_I_TurnThisOn,2,Fri Apr 17 13:23:53 2015 UTC,5 champion games in 9 years. Won 3. Plus Slick Leonard. If only I had been alive to witness it.
pacers,32vefn,Boom_Baby31,2,Fri Apr 17 13:31:48 2015 UTC,"Its so crazy to think about some of those 90's and early 2000 teams.  Hell that 99-2000 team is insane.  Miller, Smits, Mark Jackson, Dale Davis, Jalen Rose, Travis Best, Chris Mullin.....damn they were stacked."
pacers,32vefn,isubird33,1 point,Fri Apr 17 13:35:33 2015 UTC,"It's hard to top any of the mid-90s to 2000 teams. Just a different era of basketball. The 2004 team probably would have won it all if not for the fight. Horrible drafting did us in as well until about 2008. Having Paul George turn into a Superstar was honestly just the basketball gods helping us out, because NO ONE saw that coming."
pacers,32vefn,Boom_Baby31,1 point,Fri Apr 17 13:39:26 2015 UTC,"The 2004 team was awesome, but it didn't have the same feel as the late 90's teams.  Maybe I just have some rose colored glasses though. PG being a superstar was a huge boost.  If we can get a good draft pick and pick up one solid free agent we are going to be looking great going forward."
pacers,32vefn,isubird33,1 point,Fri Apr 17 13:43:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think growing up in the ""Attitude"" era of basketball shaped my mind, and I'm guessing yours as well. That's why David West is my favorite player. He embodies everything about 90s Pacers basketball.   We have our ""Miller"", now we need to draft our ""Smits"".   That's the one thing I miss about Lance. He had that edge to him. Sucks he was just too immature, but if this year humbled his ass I think he'd be worth taking back.   God, I miss Pacers basketball already."

If you look at the Top 50 PER for centers, there are 3-4 white American players on the list and a couple are only there because they play for crap teams like the Knicks. Plus Kaminski doesn't have great defensive skills. We need that over another tall guy who can shoot threes."

He is good, and will likely be a solid shooter in the NBA, but that's not how this team is built. I highly doubt the Pacers move away from having two big bodies down low. If we were talking Frank in the 20s, then I may be on board, but not in the Lottery."

pacers,32utwv,Quadly,4,Fri Apr 17 17:42:08 2015 UTC,"Myles Turner or Kevon Looney. If we have David West still next season, he would be a perfect role model for either. Myles Turners ability to stretch the floor with his size with a knack for defense excited me. Looney strikes me as a guy who could be very versatile.   I don't believe that Lyles or the guy from Louisville will be very good pros. I could be wrong though. I think PF is by far the position we need youth at the most. But that also depends on Hibbert and West's contract  situation. I really think Hibbert and Hill are fine at their positions and no one will there won't be any doubt about it once PG is back and healthy."
pacers,32utwv,scottw5150,2,Fri Apr 17 03:22:37 2015 UTC,"Myles Turner stays in school and he is a top 3 pick in 2016. I live in Austin and have seen a lot of him play. Like Durant, bad coach, body needs work. He'll be a star."
pacers,32utwv,abacus78,2,Fri Apr 17 05:56:01 2015 UTC,He already declared. He's top on my draft board for the Pacers pick. I think he's a perfect fit
pacers,32utwv,scottw5150,5,Fri Apr 17 11:56:24 2015 UTC,I think Cauley Stein would be a good fit but he'll probably be gone by the time we pick. If he's gone we really need someone who can put the ball in the hoop. Our offense needs an overhaul.   Edit; I've been thinking about it and I'd almost rather have Kaminsky. Not nearly as good on D but he can shoot and spread the floor which is something we desperately need.
pacers,32utwv,GritznGravy23,2,Fri Apr 17 00:04:34 2015 UTC,"I'd like this pick a lot because he's an incredible defensive PF which is something we need. Hopefully if we get him, we'd be able to build his offense a bit more."

Honestly this year feels like once you get to about pick 8-9, then it all becomes a crap shoot.   Just because ""experts"" think someone is valued at a specific pick, doesn't mean a team won't take them higher, especially one lead by Larry Bird. Remember when we took Miles Plumlee? Yeah, we all remember that random draft pick."

Watching them gut out so many close losses early in the season, only to turn it around and surge into the playoff race was nothing short of inspiring as a fan. This year's team just made me feel such pride as a fan, because they didn't lay down.    Next year is looking up."

pacers,32s8x3,teamretard_,3,Thu Apr 16 19:15:03 2015 UTC,I was extremely impressed with how Hill took off this year. That was what I was most hoping to see with PG being out.

pacers,32s8x3,_disguised_toast_,2,Thu Apr 16 13:07:16 2015 UTC,I can't wait for next year.
pacers,32s8x3,Lightning_Boi,2,Thu Apr 16 13:30:43 2015 UTC,"A roller coaster year that has me proud for different reasons than last year. Your summary was great. To see a full strength team of PG, Hill, West, and Roy working with Stuckey and Miles? I'm salivating at just the thought of next year.  I would also add the development of Solomon Hill to your list, I always imagined he'd be a good contributor but man he really impressed me this year. His future on this team looks especially bright to me."
pacers,32s8x3,DrMintIcecream_PI,2,Thu Apr 16 17:36:44 2015 UTC,"We seemingly fell ass first into a decent bench setup, with a healthy PG our bench could be Watson, Solo Hill, Stuckey, Damo/Lavoy Allen and Mahinmi. Also it'll be interesting to see if Miles can continue to play this well because he could be our starting 2guard next year. Overall I'm really excited that our team has grown significantly and we get a decent pick coming up too."
pacers,32s8x3,Frostler,1 point,Fri Apr 17 00:22:40 2015 UTC,I'm really excited to see where we are heading next season. Hopefully we can make some good acquisitions to round out some rough spots and return to the Eastern Conference Finals and beyond!

pacers,32smt5,MrHack139,4,Thu Apr 16 11:44:05 2015 UTC,Are being serious about Lawson for Roy? That is possibly the most insane idea I've ever heard. The sub severely undervalues Hibbert.
pacers,32smt5,irollbrokenfingers,0,Thu Apr 16 18:10:41 2015 UTC,He's offensive garbage. We need someone who can score.
pacers,32smt5,mybeardisbetter,3,Thu Apr 16 21:01:46 2015 UTC,Good thing there's Anthony Davis' falling from the sky!
pacers,32smt5,irollbrokenfingers,3,Thu Apr 16 21:06:55 2015 UTC,"Good center's are increasingly rare, we gotta keep the one we have because he's the reason our defense is always so good."
pacers,32smt5,Frostler,3,Fri Apr 17 00:23:52 2015 UTC,"I don't know why people want to lose Roy. Sure, he is unproductive on the offensive side but I'm not aware of an adequate replacement.   I kind of like CJ Watson, and I wouldn't mind keeping him for cheap.  Would like to re-sign Stuckey, he's definitely earned it, and Scola. Don't care about Sloan."
pacers,32smt5,Galt2112,2,Thu Apr 16 18:58:49 2015 UTC,"I think Pacers try to move Roy, let Copeland, Watson, and Sloan walk."
pacers,32smt5,mybeardisbetter,2,Thu Apr 16 14:05:57 2015 UTC,"If we do trade Roy, and that's a veeeery big if, we should be getting much more than a Lawson.   Watson's season was very injury riddled and, while that sucks, I'm convinced we will have the cap room to upgrade at the PG position.  Copeland should be gone as well.  Stuckey saved our bacon many times and should definitely be back next season. Scola is a good veteran presence and, assuming we can draft a good PF, he and David West can be both assets as well as mentors to the rookie. Sloan is cheap enough that I'd like to see him back for another year or so."
pacers,32smt5,busche916,2,Thu Apr 16 21:29:55 2015 UTC,"I heard from somewhere that the Pacers have 8 players under contract for next year all ready totaling 64 million, that is not a lot of room.   I keep going back and forth with Roy. On one hand, he is very inconsistent, but when he is good, he is goooood. Plus I keep thinking about the 2012 playoffs. BEAST. But I think it will be too hard to move him anyway.   West is tricky as well. He showed some decline this year, and he always seems to complain when things aren't working out. But I love his toughness. Might be easier to move trade wise. I don't know what his value us.  I love Scola, but I don't know if we can keep him. I think he is a great bench energy guy.   I don't care for Sloan, Watson, or Copeland.   Ian...I don't know. FT shooting is an issue. He fouls a TON, but it seems like a lot of them are bad calls. Probably my bias showing...  I love that we have Miles for 3 more years. The dude has no fear with shooting 3s or driving to the rim.  Re-signing Stukey should be a priority.   I like Allen as well. If he was taller, I think he could have been our starting center. Could be a good backup PF if Scola leaves if the analytic teams don't grab him.   Solo showed improvement. I think he will contribute well for a guy on a rookie contract. Same with Rudez.   Props to G Hill. What a great season for him.   Pacers will most likely pick 11 or 12. (I keep dreaming of a top 3 though!!). I think getting a true PG, so we can move G Hill to the 2, or a Big like Kaminsky would be good."
pacers,32smt5,Smart_Dumb,2,Thu Apr 16 22:17:24 2015 UTC,"I'm a fan of Big Roy.  I know his stat line rarely looks great and I don't imagine it ever will...though of course he has the occasional semi-BEAST night.  It seems like his +/- is always one of the best few of the team (yes, I understand the ""problem"" with +/- stat).  I think he has a huge impact outside of the traditional stat line that is evidenced by his +/-.  He's the question mark that I hope we don't lose.  We don't have the offense to not have Big Roy.  He anchors the defense even though the stats don't reflect it.  The David West situation saddens me.  Easily one of my favorite Pacers of all time...if not the favorite.  Obviously he's past his prime.  I hope we can have him for one more season just because I always like to think there's more than a business side to sports.  I could see him just as an emotional leader of the team that's more of 2nd team player.  That being said...he probably commands more than I think we should pay him."
pacers,32smt5,slitt_vicious,1 point,Thu Apr 16 22:58:47 2015 UTC,"I feel like West retires, Hibbert either walks or is traded, Scola walks, Watson walks, Sloan walks, Stuckey re-signs, Copeland walks, Allen re-signs (he will be our starter next year).  In FA we need to look for a starting center and then draft a PF. Hibbert is an ok player, but there are plenty of centers who play defense and can actually score while standing right next to basket."
pacers,32smt5,Boom_Baby31,1 point,Fri Apr 17 12:17:49 2015 UTC,I don't see West retiring. He's got another year in him.
pacers,32smt5,anscmc,1 point,Fri Apr 17 13:48:04 2015 UTC,"He just didn't have the same passion this year. I can understand why, but he talked about retiring last summer so calling it quits wouldn't be too surprising. Especially if the Pacers decide to semi-blow up the team."
pacers,32smt5,Boom_Baby31,1 point,Fri Apr 17 13:51:04 2015 UTC,I guess it wouldn't be too crazy. We definitely need to pick up a new point guard and power forward. I think Bird will get things done this offseason.   Edit: I take that back. We need a good backup PG to Hill. A PF in the draft. And a couple other nice bench pieces in FA/trades. Let Cope and Allen go.
pacers,32smt5,anscmc,1 point,Fri Apr 17 14:06:21 2015 UTC,"I disagree with Allen. He's going to be a solid player. He has shown that when he plays solid minutes continually. Plus he will be cheap. I believe the Pacers only signed him to a one-year deal to keep their Cap low, but I could be completely wrong.   And a new backup PG is definitely needed. I like Watson, but something just tells me he won't be back and I'm not crazy about Sloan. He's good, but really shows at times why he's the third PG. After the Copeland fiasco from last year to this year (I thought he was better than he was) I stand firmly behind this Pacers coaching staff and how they dictate minutes."
pacers,32smt5,Boom_Baby31,1 point,Fri Apr 17 14:12:06 2015 UTC,The problem with that is they will need to let Scola or West go. We can't really afford to have 4 PF's on the team. Who would you rather have: Scola or West?
pacers,32smt5,anscmc,1 point,Fri Apr 17 14:27:00 2015 UTC,Well to me I think West retires and Scola leaves. This is going to be a semi-rebuilding year unless they decide as an organization to give it one more go with the squad they have and then start over.
pacers,32smt5,Boom_Baby31,0,Fri Apr 17 15:21:19 2015 UTC,I would have no quarrels with losing Hibbert. He just hasn't been consistantly productive for how much we pay him/how freaking large he is.
pacers,32smt5,ImBad1101,0,Thu Apr 16 18:52:22 2015 UTC,"This is my perfect offseason:   Hibbert and West come back Bring back Watson and Stuckey, possibly Scola if he's cheap Draft the best player available, we really don't have any gaping holes. Hopefully a nice PG or big man is available, I trust Larry Bird when picking ~10 so I'm excited. The single most important thing that needs to happen is that Paul George gets healthy and comfortable on the floor again, nothing we do will matter if he's not good to go."
pacers,32sh73,btirumala,2,Thu Apr 16 10:28:30 2015 UTC,As well as draft status. Being on that tredmill for years did us no favors. If can't reasonably contend for a championship there's no reason to limp into the playoffs like we'd have done.

pacers,32rnxx,duptygupty,3,Thu Apr 16 04:26:25 2015 UTC,Hibbert's D is what can make this team have a year like we did last year. He's important to what we do in Indy.
pacers,32rnxx,THE_BIG_SITT,1 point,Thu Apr 16 06:47:54 2015 UTC,"""What we do in Indy"" isn't winning a championship anymore. The league has changed. Back-to-the-basket big men aren't as effective as they used to be. We need to dump Roy, and look to become more athletic."

pacers,32rnxx,exWarlock,0,Thu Apr 16 16:46:57 2015 UTC,"You're delusional, and I hope I'm wrong.   Roy doesn't work on stuff like losing weight and trying to become more agile. That's the kind of Roy we need. He works all summer on his bulk and his muscle, but we need a Roy that works on his vertical and his diet and his attitude.   I'd rather have Lance's weirdo attitude, and a new, energetic PF/C, than a sluggish center. I love the guy, but he's not worth $15.5m next year, even if he DOES come back in DPOTY condition."
pacers,32rnxx,ChrisBenRoy,2,Thu Apr 16 16:38:34 2015 UTC,That's another question I have because I'm really unsure on who would be willing to take Hibbert.

pacers,32rnxx,PancakesandMaggots,5,Thu Apr 16 16:42:36 2015 UTC,What do we do? We stick with the core (if we can afford it) and draft a guy like Miles Turner to develop under David West. We saw much growth with Hill and Miles this season at the end and saw Stuckey do some amazing things. This team will be fine without injuries but we need some youth at the PF position.
pacers,32rnxx,THE_BIG_SITT,5,Thu Apr 16 04:14:33 2015 UTC,"We need some new big men hopefully through some trade, and some young and upcoming guys to start filling in for the aging West and Scola, although I really hope we keep them."
pacers,32rnxx,Galt2112,0,Thu Apr 16 04:15:25 2015 UTC,"I hope one of those two go, if not both. We aren't winning with this core anytime soon. Time to get younger and build for the future."
pacers,32rnxx,THE_BIG_SITT,1 point,Thu Apr 16 16:38:44 2015 UTC,"So we're going to enter a rebuild, which is an extremely difficult process that can stick teams in limbo for years, while we're only a year removed from a conference finals appearance, and about to get a top 10 NBA player back, with improved options around him?  Fuck that."
pacers,32rnxx,basketballrene,1 point,Thu Apr 16 19:04:32 2015 UTC,"We BARELY made the conference finals in an extremely weak conference.

Our conference is doing nothing but getting better, while you what to stick with what we have? All while getting older and less athletic?  Fuck that."
pacers,32rnxx,zayers35,3,Thu Apr 16 19:40:50 2015 UTC,We need bigs specifically PF.
pacers,32rnxx,THE_BIG_SITT,3,Thu Apr 16 05:23:43 2015 UTC,"I really think we need to get a young PF, I love West and Scola but they aren't getting any younger. I would think we need to keep west and look to the draft or trade for a PF. I know this would be a big stretch but if we could somehow manage to create a trade package for Greg Monroe that would be a great scenario. Assuming we have enough salary off of the books for him. In that scenario I am assuming Roy (he's my favorite Pacer, so I'm sad to say this) would opt out or we figure out how to incorporate him into the trade package.  I also think that we need to get another scorer to take pressure off of Paul, I would think a player like Wesley Matthews or Danny Green comes to mind. Also I don't think it would happen but Goran Dragic at point and move George Hill to shooting guard would be awesome too.   These are scenarios that came to mind when I thought about the off season. However if the team is able to keep West, Hibbert, Stuckey, and a healthy PG returns we will be fine in my opinion. I love the core of this team and have (biased and optimistic) faith in them."
pacers,32rnxx,exWarlock,1 point,Thu Apr 16 11:25:55 2015 UTC,I honestly can't see Roy opting out. No way he walks away from $15m(?).

pacers,32rnxx,stushow,2,Thu Apr 16 16:41:01 2015 UTC,I think we need to do something about our back up center position. I think I've lost faith in Ian. He just doesn't seem to be able to guard offensive skilled big men.
pacers,32rnxx,pfc_bgd,4,Thu Apr 16 04:07:19 2015 UTC,Really? I honestly like him way more than Hibbert. He is just more mobile and not so damn top-heavy
pacers,32rnxx,imkunu,2,Thu Apr 16 04:08:43 2015 UTC,I just think he's a liability on defense when Hibbert goes out and I don't think that his inconsistent offense makes up for it.
pacers,32rnxx,MoeAverage,2,Thu Apr 16 04:12:14 2015 UTC,I feel like Hibbert has just gotten worse year after year. I like Mahinmi as our back up but we need a rebounding defensive starter.
pacers,32rnxx,pfc_bgd,-5,Thu Apr 16 04:26:16 2015 UTC,Hibbert is a liability on defense as well.
pacers,32rnxx,duptygupty,2,Thu Apr 16 11:47:50 2015 UTC,"Re-sign Stuckey. Gotta think West and Hibbert pick up their player options.  Get rid of Mahinmi. Maybe a big in the draft comes to us?  What kind of deal is Cope on? He might be gone, too.  My unpopular opinion is I reaaalllly don't like Donald Sloan. I wouldn't mind seeing if we can work him in some sort of package."
pacers,32rnxx,duptygupty,1 point,Thu Apr 16 04:18:57 2015 UTC,I like where your head is... i wouldn't mind seeing scola and Ian go and replace them with some people to develop for the future
pacers,32rnxx,duptygupty,2,Thu Apr 16 04:56:53 2015 UTC,"We need to figure out what we do at PF and C positions.    Hibbert. Don't ask me who we can get instead, I don't get paid a ton of money to make those decisions, but I think we need to move him somehow. We all know Hibbert does well jumping straight up and protecting the rim when guards/small forwards attack, but that's all he's good for defensively. We saw what Gortat did to him, and we saw Gasol absolutely destroy us in the win or go home game. That is NOT what elite defenders do. Pick'n'roll? He gets smoked. He's useless offensively, and the way he throws the ball towards the rim makes him look more like an uncoordinated college player than a pro. Fuck it, if we have to play small ball- play small ball.   West. Father time.  Scola. Father time.  Mahinmi. I dunno, not the worst back up, but doesn't bring much other than size. I like the effort tho.    Get Kaminsky is possible?  I'd also like us to get a decent point guard, but I don't see that happening. Resign Stuckey tho."
pacers,32rnxx,ChrisBenRoy,4,Thu Apr 16 11:45:43 2015 UTC,We need a damn point guard. Move George to SG and let's get someone to set everyone else up. This offense is like a clogged toilet

The Pacers lacked shooting last season and then lacked a superstar this season. Next season we should have both together and I think skies the limit."
pacers,32s0b3,Boom_Baby31,2,Fri Apr 17 12:27:13 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think the highlight of the season was George Hill. The guy grew to a level I didn't know he was capable of. He plays more aggressive, his awareness has grown, and his D has always been strong. He's far and away a better player than last year, and I can't wait to see where that takes us next season."

Yes we haven't lost with the Flo-jo's but still, we are using them too often imo. A 'rally hat' or 'lucky charm' isn't really as effective mentally when it's used every time instead of at key points....  But if any game we needed the Flo-Jos it would be this one."

Seeing how much better the ball moves on the offensive end this year makes me realize how much of a ball stopper he really was when he was on the floor. I also think he had a major part in our meltdown second half of last year not only on the court (poor ball movement habits rubbing off on other players) but off (locker room issues, appeared to divide the locker room). He is an iso centric scorer and I think the league is moving away from that as we are seeing ""spurs like"" teams starting to succeed more and more. I really don't think lance has a place on a team like that unless he drastically changes his game. Also his pitiful three point shooting is a very big liability for a shooting guard in todays NBA. I love Lance and hope he finds a team where he can succeed, I just think bringing him back would cause more problems then good for our young team."

pacers,32kly8,_disguised_toast_,2,Tue Apr 14 20:22:05 2015 UTC,Will Memphis be playing for something no matter what?
pacers,32kly8,Sheffield178,5,Tue Apr 14 16:03:04 2015 UTC,Memphis scenario is pretty simple. Win and have either the Rockets or Spurs to lose to move to 5th in the West.   A loss or both the Rockets and Spurs winning leaves the Grizzlies in 6th.  Where their motivations get tricky is the fact that the #5 in the West will get home-court advantage over #4 Portland.   To further complicate matters the 9:30 EST tip time could actually make a scenario where Grizzlies play all of their guys in the first half  but rest in the second half. Both San Antonio and Houston tip off at 8:00 EST. Meaning the Grizzlies will know if the Pacers game matters by ~10:40 EST which is about the same time that halftime will be happening in Memphis.  I think the Pacers are going to need to go 2-0. I get the outside feeling that we will narrowly pull it off as the Grizzlies opt to rest Gasol in the 2nd half after Spurs beat Pelicans and Rockets beat the Jazz earlier in the night.
pacers,32kly8,Dude4445,1 point,Tue Apr 14 22:09:10 2015 UTC,"Looks like it. They're only 1 game behind the Spurs and the Rockets. If both of them drop, they have a lot to gain."
pacers,32kly8,Jinno,1 point,Tue Apr 14 16:10:03 2015 UTC,"If the link below is accurate, the Grizzlies are out of contention for home-field advantage in Round 1. Best case for them is a 5 seed and a matchup with the Blazers, which probably isn't worth risking anybody who isn't 100%."
pacers,32kly8,kl64,1 point,Tue Apr 14 16:30:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, but Memphis has 2 starters out with injury right now and Gasol is playing injured.  Not exactly the best case for them."

I don't think the Nets winning against Orlando is as definite as everyone thinks it is. PG13's minutes will increase if we make the playoffs and he has been solid.

I really didn't think we were going to be in this position a week or so ago. As much as we got unlucky with the Cavs playing like assholes, we got lucky that Rose is back and the Bulls have to play good basketball to get themselves going.   That being said, even though tonight's game will be a bit weird since we have no clue what Wizards team will show up, we should win this one. And while the players don't have the luxury of looking beyond Wizards at this point, the fans do. And it blows that we have back-to-back games with the season on the line, and we have to travel to Memphis to play one of the most hard-nosed teams in the league in their arena. I guess all I hope for is that tomorrow morning we'll still have a shot at the playoffs, and then let's go all out."

Still passed but not the grade I wanted. Emailed the teacher hoping he changes it.  Glad the Pacers have been playing well. I think the Stuckey/Miles combo will be better than Lance ever was. Stuckey is the perfect 6th man. A role he is more than willing to accept and Lance wouldn't. Miles also is the perfect floor spacer for the starters.  It is pretty crazy the positive impact that PG13 has had since his return considering how rusty he looks.   And, as a George Hill fan, I hope he continues to shut up the fan base that wants a ""pass first PG"". There are no PGs that fit that narrative anymore. What you need, especially in the Pacers offense is a low turnover player at that position. And that is exactly what Hill does."

George hill lives on Geist lake in Indy along with many other athletes/famous people in Indy. Anyway, one day my cousin gets a call from George saying he needs a boat. a few days later we had one ordered him. Problem is, he had no idea how to take care of it, store it, and use it properly. So he asks us to deliver it directly to him, and spend a day showing him the ropes on how to do those things. Nonetheless it was a great day, and George is an all around great and nice guy. Now George and my cousin are good friends, they even went on a deep sea fishing trip in Texas last summer. Love having this dude as a PG."

pacers,322sxw,irollbrokenfingers,3,Fri Apr 10 03:35:01 2015 UTC,basic summary of this all:  Being tied with Heat = GOOD for most tiebreakers.  Not being tied with Heat = pray we have a better record then Nets/Celtics.

I hope Wizards/Grizzlies both tank, but that might not happen.  Wizards still might have a shot at catching Chicago and I'd wager Grizzlies go down to the last game of the season for their division."
pacers,322g5e,Pacers31Colts18,2,Fri Apr 10 01:09:14 2015 UTC,"I vote Kaminsky or Stein. Both are very flawed but to me it's about potential.   Kaminsky could develop into a Marc Gasol / early Dirk Nowitzki type, capable of shooting away from the basket and facilitating offense through him. He'll need to put on some muscle.  Stein is not as good offensively as the other big men in the draft, but he's extremely athletic, defensive minded, and already instinctively moves to good help-side defensive positions. He'd need to develop his offensive game, but the same was once said about DeAndre Jordan and Joakim Noah.   I don't like Towns for us because he reminds me of David Harrison. I also don't see anything in Okafor that separates him from the slew of other ""good in college but not the pros"" big men (Sean May, Emeka Okafor). I don't like any of the point guards for the Pacers, and Justise Winslow (looks like the next Jimmy Butler) will be drafted too early to wind up as a shooting guard for us."

Having fun and being serious can be concurrent.  Being out at 4am for someone who works evenings isn't really a big deal. You don't know if he was even drinking.  By all accounts he's a responsible guy and a good teammate. You don't know that he's a bad ""example"".  Who yells ""COCKLAND""? That's seems rather childish..."

You think some joe shmo just said hey, let me stab him? There must have been an altercation. He must have said something. No one just goes around stabbing people (some do yea yeah..) Drinks do not matter (even though I'm sure he was drinking) but the environment he was in at 4:00AM does. Why doesn't Manning or Kobe get stabbed? Hell, David West or Rudez?

pacers,31y8bs,irollbrokenfingers,3,Thu Apr 9 02:42:39 2015 UTC,"Man he looks way better than so many players who have come back from nasty injuries.  He's rusty, but not nearly as rusty as I would have expected.  He seems to still have his shooting touch.  Defense is probably the largest deficit I see right now.  He's still over playing and making plays, but he's not as quick to react and recover from it so sometimes he gets burned.  But I think that will come as he gets more acclimated to the game and I would rather he stay aggressive because he's much better that way."

pacers,31xuu7,RoddickAndy,6,Thu Apr 9 01:34:37 2015 UTC,"That's such a dumb draft mockup. Really... we'd pick up ANOTHER SF? Especially when we have Hill, and PG as well as other pressing issues?

pacers,31xuu7,dirtydan1114,1 point,Thu Apr 9 14:08:13 2015 UTC,I'd really like to see us target an offensive center whether in the draft or through a trade.  It would be a nice switch to go from all defense Hibbert to an offensive threat.
pacers,31xuu7,NateThomas1979,2,Thu Apr 9 14:21:04 2015 UTC,"That seems to be a complex subject. If we have an offensive center on the floor, we'd have to shift the focus of our offense to capitalize on that rather than primarily drive and kick like we do now. Idk if a second team player is worth that.  There's a reason we have Ian, he fits our team goals for a center: defense and rebounding focused, doesn't need the ball on offense. Sure wish he could make a damn free throw though"
pacers,31xuu7,dirtydan1114,1 point,Thu Apr 9 14:27:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly I have to disagree slightly here. If we truly are worried about losing West and with Hibbert being only good on defense we are quickly losing any offensive threats we have short of PG and the streaky Stuckey/Miles. Getting an offensive minded center causes the opposing team to have to defend the middle allowing for us to have more opportunities for guys like Hill, Rudez and others to get open 3s and midrange jumpers.  As well we can pick up a rebounding 4 or just use Allen at the 4 and give us defense that way.  But it's all just conjecture at this point right?"
pacers,31xuu7,NateThomas1979,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:09:31 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but conjecture seems to be what we're all looking for in a draft thread, one of my favorite parts of the year.  I will say if David leaves that definitely changes things, as the reason lavoy doesn't get minutes at the 4 is he can't regularly hit that mid range jumper that is so key to the offense. So a purely post/ rebounding style big might not be the best fit.  I'm definitely cautiously optimistic about our offensive potential with Paul back though. With how well George hill has been playing and when stuckey is at full health we shouldn't have a ""dead group"" on the floor relying on the two CJs to be hot"
pacers,31xuu7,dirtydan1114,6,Thu Apr 9 17:21:34 2015 UTC,"As great a college player as Kaminsky is, I'm not sure how well he will translate to the NBA. That said, I would love to see him succeed whether we take him or not."

I really just want us to draft a PF. I think that long term is the most pressing issue and whoever we draft to fill that can learn nicely under West/Scola assuming they are back. Does anyone know if Frank could be a successful PF?"
pacers,31xuu7,scottw5150,2,Thu Apr 9 01:54:18 2015 UTC,"Well, considering he is a power forward for Wisconsin, and he has many accolades, I think he would pan out quite well."
pacers,31xuu7,AquaPuddles,2,Thu Apr 9 02:31:23 2015 UTC,"Oh really? I was under the assumption he was more of a center as opposed to PF. For example, this site lists him at center: http://www.nbadraft.net/players/frank-kaminsky  I'm not against Kaminsky, but the many accolades is a weak argument IMO. Hansbrough had many as well, but he didn't really pan out. Obviously different players, different skill sets. But anyway, I was basing my question off him being listed as a center. I didn't know if he had the abilities to play PF as well. I watched him some in the tourney and he is pretty impressive, but some of it  worries me as well. I'll try to comment again later with some more of my reasoning after some homework."
pacers,31xuu7,scottw5150,6,Thu Apr 9 02:45:10 2015 UTC,Nah. Would be Tyler Hansbrough 2.0. Being a good college player doesn't make you a good NBA player.
pacers,31xuu7,XC_Stallion92,3,Thu Apr 9 02:39:36 2015 UTC,"Think Frank has a bit more offensive utility can make shots and has a bit of a post game, whereas T's offense was to get fouled basically. Not saying he's going to be awesome more like a rich man's Kelly Olynyk or like a stretch 5 without the consistency of say Channing Frye. A tall Scola is not a bad comparison I think"
pacers,31xuu7,cuteguy1,2,Thu Apr 9 07:52:43 2015 UTC,"Frank isn't as intense as Hansbrough, and has a utility of offensive weapons at his disposal. He can slide out to shoot, stretching the defense a lot more than T ever could. I think he's a bit on the 'soft' side but in Indiana that could easily change working with West..."

Sloan, 2. or 3. Rudez/Cope, 4. or 5. Allen/Wittington.  Most unsure about CJ miles and Solo Hill.

pacers,31w1di,WTF_RANDY,3,Wed Apr 8 16:59:54 2015 UTC,I personally would rather Miles start. He provides floor spacing (which Solo doesn't consistently) and passable defense. A floor spacer is really what the starting 5 needs to open up the paint for Hibbert and west.

But seeing him out there I was once again reminded the George has built his super stardom on his defense.  Is he a good Forward on offense? Well, yes, 13 points in 15 minutes showed that even not in game shape, PG is a beaut in this offense.    But defensively, he was heads and shoulders above everyone on the court, Pacers and Heat.  Its not his energy, its not his technique, though he has both of those.  Its his instincts.  He smells where the ball is going.  He feels where the person he is guarding is going.  He's moving with the opposing player almost before the move is made.  He's simply the one of the best perimeter defenders in the game today.  Not even a question."

pacers,31kw9o,busche916,3,Mon Apr 6 02:06:12 2015 UTC,He is automatic from mid range. I don't even think he needs to try and get a three point shot really. He honestly might be the best shooter in the draft besides Booker. Every time I watched this kid play he knocked down mid range shots whether they were contested or not.  I hope we end up getting him if we are in the mid lottery. If we are in late lottery I hope we take Montrezl Harrell.

I think that's just how us people from Indiana are for sports, if you take a step back you will notice that.

Seriously though I think we are pretty justified in being down on this team.  It's not just this year - it has been building since the collapse started last February.  This team is just frustratingly inconsistent, and we SHOULD have gotten what value we could have from players like west and hibbert while we still had a chance.  Roy Hibbert has to be the most inconsistent player on the face of the earth.  He just has HUGE mental issues that make him a liability during the playoffs.  Now look at the team PG will come back to next year - we have almost NO young talent on our team to surround him with.  No good draft picks in the last few years hasn't helped either.  And let me tell you something about Solomon Hill - he isn't anything special.  I know that hurts to admit, but he simply isn't.  You may feel different because you, like me, are a fan and therefore absorb every tweet, stat line, article about Solomon and feel like he's different, but here's the bad news - EVERY SINGLE TEAM has a handful of players like Solomon, and their fanbase feels exactly the same about those players.  ""Just wait until he fully develops - he'll shock everyone!  So now not only is this a lost year, but I am having a really hard time to see how we improve next year with the leaving FA's and lack of young talent."

The worst part was the past couple weeks where they did very well for a stretch and then fell off hard.  Last year was actually miserable. One of the worst seasons I've been through, second only to the Palace in my 20 years as a Pacers fan. Nothing hurts worse than to fall off from a title contender to a solid team, only to lose one of your rising stars and then watch your best player go through a horrific injury in a fucking national-team warm-up."

pacers,311oy7,THE_BIG_SITT,2,Thu Apr 2 01:51:41 2015 UTC,Good point. It seems hard to decide who to draft. We don't know if Stuckey/West/Hibbert will stay.

pacers,311ty4,Pacers31Colts18,9,Wed Apr 1 12:53:26 2015 UTC,"To be fair, it was basically the only option after that horrendous offensive possession. George Hill handed him the ball out past the 3 pt line with like, 2 seconds on the clock."
pacers,311ty4,kinako-,7,Wed Apr 1 14:20:25 2015 UTC,"It was either take that shot or turn it over. Roy has made threes before, he really didn't have another option.   This is a foolish topic."
pacers,311ty4,Derek2k3,5,Wed Apr 1 18:38:58 2015 UTC,"I mean the shot clock was expiring. Maybe he shouldn't have been out there in the first place, but he had to shoot at that point in time."
pacers,311ty4,Sheffield178,-9,Wed Apr 1 12:54:15 2015 UTC,True...I'd rather have him just throw the ball out of bounds.
pacers,30xwh2,Pacers31Colts18,3,Tue Mar 31 16:30:13 2015 UTC,I don't understand why he isn't currently playing if he's been cleared by the medical staff already.  Bring him off the bench or something.
pacers,30xwh2,materhern,2,Tue Mar 31 16:56:27 2015 UTC,"Part of his recovery is conditioning and recovery of strength, and the playoff push is irrelevant to George's recovery. Yes, his bone is healed completely, but I'm sure he is building up all of the musculature in his leg still. The last thing we want is for him to come back and tear something or develop some kind of overuse injury due to muscle atrophy.  I'd rather not make the playoffs then have that happen."
pacers,30xwh2,Wafflecone416,2,Tue Mar 31 20:00:08 2015 UTC,"The medical staff wouldn't clear him if they didn't think he was well enough to play...and this includes bones, muscles, and so on...  But if PG is not mentally ready to be back, then he shouldn't come back."
pacers,30xwh2,pfc_bgd,2,Tue Mar 31 20:02:13 2015 UTC,"That's not necessarily true. Medically cleared to play usually means he was cleared by his surgeon, and their expertise isn't conditioning and strength training. That's the job of the Pacers strength coaches and physical therapists. They're the ones who are in charge of making sure Paul stays healthy and avoids reinjury."
pacers,30xwh2,Wafflecone416,1 point,Tue Mar 31 20:05:13 2015 UTC,"Well, he did say he wanted to make sure everyone is on the same page and okay with it.  Maybe he's hearing hesitation from the strength and conditioning staff.  And of course he should first and foremost be listening to those who have the knowledge."
pacers,30xwh2,materhern,1 point,Tue Mar 31 20:07:57 2015 UTC,"I think that has to be what it is because Paul has to be chomping at the bit to play, so I doubt it's mental. Strength and conditioning would be the last stage of his recovery so it would make sense that's what's holding him back right now.  In the end I would rather him and the staff be as careful as possible. Just look at how many players around the league are being hampered consistently by injury. We need Paul to stay healthy or our franchise is in serious trouble."

pacers,30x1by,valteamxblades,1 point,Wed Apr 1 12:09:43 2015 UTC,"There were 2-3 possessions down the stretch that were just freaking puzzling...One that comes to mind is obviously when Hibbs ended up shooting a three. I'm not sure what Hill was thinking passing it back to him there, and I have no clue what Hibbs was doing behind the three point line to begin with. Another one is when Hill and West were handing the ball of to each other with some 3-4 seconds left on the shot clock which lead to Hill shooting a forced three.   We had a horrible start, but then we caught on fairly fast...so it's not one of those games when all this extra energy gets used to catch up, we were back in the game late in the 2nd. Just poor execution down the stretch.   And Hibbs is once again lost in space time. Time for me to accept him for what he is- extreme offensive liability and great defender but only when the match up is just right."

pacers,30q6cg,Einsteiniac,3,Sun Mar 29 20:43:56 2015 UTC,umm i can deal with losing on purpose if it's only for one year and if it means we have a chance of drafting a potential future nba all star caliber player to pair with PG
pacers,30q6cg,exWarlock,1 point,Sun Mar 29 22:15:42 2015 UTC,"Yeh, I can DEFINITELY deal with losing on purpose if it's for a draft like this. Hell, if we're losing at all, it better be on purpose. Better than facing the fact that our team sucks."
pacers,30q6cg,mizzourifan1,1 point,Sun Mar 29 23:05:19 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Sports are great because it's all about watching your squad bring everything they have every night. I don't care if we could have a better draft position, or even a better team next year. It's all about the competitive spirit of the game, not tactically giving up. I don't need the Pacers to win to love them, I just need to be proud of my team. I am."
pacers,30q6cg,Frostler,3,Mon Mar 30 13:08:56 2015 UTC,"I'd rather continue a winning culture, we're still bad enough to grab a top 10 pick if we don't make the playoffs. IMO w/ a healthy Paul George we're still a good team, possibly even better than the last few years because we won't have Lance's stupidity to deal with."
pacers,30q6cg,basketballrene,2,Sun Mar 29 21:21:55 2015 UTC,I cant imagine playing basketball for a team to lose on purpose.....

pacers,30q6cg,exWarlock,1 point,Mon Mar 30 12:07:58 2015 UTC,"The potential to draft at their position for one year is better than relying on that as a culture. People hear ""tank"" and think multiple years of epic failure to build a perfect team.   No. It doesn't have to be that way. How has it helped those other teams? It hasn't. How has Larry's back-to-back ""three year plans"" worked? Mediocrely, but we got PG."
pacers,30q6cg,Pacers31Colts18,2,Mon Mar 30 14:29:59 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say mediocre. We went to two straight conference finals, improved every year. Mediocre I would consider being bounced in the first round. We lost our star player for the season. Not many teams can recover from that."
pacers,30q6cg,johnnyu19,0,Mon Mar 30 16:37:22 2015 UTC,"Our situation does not compare to theirs in the slightest.  Like i said in the op, this would've been a one year tank compared to a multi-year tank like Philly. We all know when PG comes back next year this team will most likely be a top 4 or 5 seed in the East, but with him being out for this whole year we missed out on a golden opportunity of tanking to draft a top 5 talent. I get some fans never want to tank because of ""integrity"" or whatever but that mentality can be detrimental to the future of the franchise. now we're most likely going to miss the playoffs and have a mid round draft pick which is just stupid on the FO's part"
pacers,30q6cg,theconmeister,1 point,Sun Mar 29 22:11:52 2015 UTC,"We wouldnt be able to pay him after his rookie contract is expired, they already have max money tied up in Hibbert and PG, so basically we would have to blow up pretty much our entire roster for a player like Okafor or Towns."
pacers,30q6cg,materhern,1 point,Mon Mar 30 00:36:04 2015 UTC,"Not really, top 5 rookies get 4 year contracts if I understand correctly, only guy we have inked that far is Paul. Also we could potentially use them as a trade chip if nothing else since we are more in win now mode. Either way I think we're just fine."
pacers,30q6cg,exWarlock,1 point,Mon Mar 30 05:28:11 2015 UTC,"It was impossible for us to ever suck that bad.  We were never going to be bottom three. Not only could we not be that bad, Bird was never going to do the asshat Sixers Bullshit of forcing Vogel to sit players to get to that amount of losing."
pacers,30q6cg,DBirk94,1 point,Mon Mar 30 00:51:07 2015 UTC,"As evidenced in a dozen of the last 16 games, we didn't have to bench players to lose. We could have been semi-tanking since PG broke his leg, and we wouldn't know. The fact of the matter is, nobody knows what the team is doing, ever, unless they talk about it; and even then, lying/misleading is still a possibility.   Larry may have his eyes on someone in the draft who will fall 13-15, and/or we still have that lottery that we could win. Regardless, at the end of the season, I'll be proud of the work we put in, whatever the result. Next year, I'll be prouder by default."
pacers,30q6cg,XC_Stallion92,1 point,Mon Mar 30 14:46:41 2015 UTC,Even if we did tank the front office would pull some bullshit move like they always do a la take a player like Yogi Ferrell really high up

pacers,30q6cg,theconmeister,1 point,Mon Mar 30 03:46:43 2015 UTC,oh god no. if he goes this year then he'll be lucky to go early in the second. but i agree that the pacers always reach. I remember not knowing who the fuck pg was. i guess its hit and miss tho
pacers,30q6cg,Drak_is_Right,1 point,Mon Mar 30 03:49:14 2015 UTC,"My problem with your reasoning is that you act like it's a complete waste of a season. I will admit before we made the playoff push I was pretty excited at the potential having a really high pick (and we could still easily end up around 10) but this team played their ass off and I thoroughly enjoy watching them compete every night regardless of where we end up. Saying we ""screwed"" ourselves over was a poor choice of words. We will still be towards the top of the East next year regardless of where we end up and I'm excited to see how good this team can be with Paul on it whether that's this season or next. No matter where we end up you should be excited right now, not mad at our FO or coaching staff. Also this draft is pretty deep, we can still get a solid player at 15."
pacers,30q6cg,XC_Stallion92,1 point,Mon Mar 30 05:20:46 2015 UTC,"CHANCE and this isn't the strongest draft either.  Anyways, if the Pacers decided to tank, I'd give up following them for the year."
pacers,30q6cg,valteamxblades,1 point,Mon Mar 30 10:37:14 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, but there was absolutely no chance that Larry Legend would do anything like that. It would not surprise me if, on the last day of the season, we are the 10 seed and a win gets us the 9 seed, and Larry wants to go all in. Wouldn't put it past him to bring PG back for that game if there's a chance we would move up. I don't always agree with how he goes about things, but you can't really fault his desire to keep integrity in the game.  Edit: Also, I'm sure there is a lot of pressure from Herb to get a playoff series. Playoff home games make a lot of money. Whether or not Herb would put that money back into the team is another matter, but it is certainly in the financial interest of the ownership to have as many home games as possible."

pacers,30mw43,Frostler,1 point,Sun Mar 29 21:23:04 2015 UTC,It's obviously on Paul now. Image how it would be if you sat out a whole season. You watched your teammates scrap their way through the season and then had to decide when to come back. Knowing your rusty and will be taking minutes away other guys that have worked so hard to get where they're at.   Tough call for a player to make but I honestly think he'll be back one of these next few games once he feels better with his stamina on the court at practice.

pacers,30mbcj,schnebly5,19,Sat Mar 28 18:09:09 2015 UTC,"I honestly think he will. Breaking a bone is much different from muscle tears like DRose has had. After a bone is healed, it's actually stronger than it was before. The real problem is he's going to be really hesitant coming back. For example, someone made a montage for PG'a return, and there was a clip of the exact same block attempt that he broke his leg on in August. He'll eventually get there, but we'll probably have to wait until next season to see how comfortable he is playing again."
pacers,30mbcj,jkran,13,Sat Mar 28 18:19:20 2015 UTC,"I think he'll be better. Not because I'm a Pacers fan but I've read a lot of articles on his injury and a lot of ""experts/doctors"" claim that he will turn out just fine because his injury doesn't have anything to do with muscles/ligaments like JKRAN said.   It's all up to him b/c we don't know how he will feel. That's why I keep telling everyone that he needs to slowly crawl, walk, jog, run, sprint and then BOLT.   I saw what PFM did (i know it's a whole diff type of injury) He started from basic fundamentals and we all know how many TDs he threw in Denver.   Let the kid get his head and body str8 in the summer and make 2015-2016 a year to remember.  LET'S FUCKING GO PACERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! STOP THE FUCKING TURNOVERS AND PLAY THAT D!!!"

I don't remember a single report saying anything about that type of damage.  Honestly, for a basketball player this is about the best type of weight bearing bone to break and have a full recovery from (compared to a break at a joint, foot, or vertebrae).  Durant and Rose had/have far more worrisome injuries.  If complications somehow did arise from this though, it would probably be a career ending injury as that would mean he had limited use of his leg.  If there was any good to come from the way he was injured, it was that the break occurred from hitting an object with force rather then a natural weakness in his bone strength.  Most people would break a bone in a collision like that."

If we were able to get the Chicago/Cleveland/Nawlins/whoever lottery treatment, and somehow magically make it into the top 5, I would be happy, and only slightly surprised. We deserve it, though, more than anyone else right now."

pacers,30jefs,h3isenburg,3,Sat Mar 28 17:16:17 2015 UTC,Why would we want a guy who has trouble moving laterally and only an adequate rim protector?  I get that getting the #1 pick is good but why not Russell or Towns instead?
pacers,30jefs,NateThomas1979,3,Sat Mar 28 02:31:18 2015 UTC,"It varies the risk you want.  Towns is a higher risk pick and while he might have a higher upside, he also has a far lower potential too.  With Okafor you are getting a player that will have a long productive NBA career barring injury.  With Russel, you would be getting a combo guard who its unknown if he can play the point well in the pros."
pacers,30jefs,Drak_is_Right,1 point,Sat Mar 28 04:12:29 2015 UTC,To me there are two glaring issues with the Pacers. We need more points in the paint and we need a more effective point guard that will get us into our offensive sets quicker.  The pacers are very slow in their starts. We need to fix that however we can.
pacers,30jefs,NateThomas1979,1 point,Sat Mar 28 16:47:37 2015 UTC,"I have a lot of doubts that Russel is the right guy to fix this.  Honestly, not excited over a top 3 pick this year.  A true PG and a PF are the two biggest needs.  Those 3 players don't fit either of those needs in all likelihood."

I wanna know what West had an allergic reaction to before the game??  I've been saying this about Hibbert, too. Hibbert slacks on defense at the end of the game, as much as on offense, except as a huge wall to stand in players' ways. Look at the evidence: instead of reaching up to block a shot last night, he elbow-bumped the guy, and got called for the foul. Instead of playing that incredible defense he's sainted for."

pacers,30hg28,Boom_Baby31,3,Fri Mar 27 14:29:48 2015 UTC,"It seems like this year the refs just base flagrant fouls on the reaction of the player fouled and the reaction of the bench.

The game 3 home win against Miami in the Eastern semi's three years ago was pretty great, too. Miami jumped out early, but the Pacers dominated the second half.  Dark horse moment - the Cavs game last year when the Pacers came back from 20 down with less than 9 minutes left. The way the crowd energy built after every basket or defensive stop was amazing. When Indy cut it to around 5, it felt like the entire building just KNEW the Pacers were winning that game, and it didn't matter what the Cavs did, it just wouldn't be enough."

pacers,30esqv,ls215,9,Sat Mar 28 18:47:25 2015 UTC,"Larry Brown's standing ovation for Reggie on his final 27-point effort. Very classy move on Larry's part. I had been a Pacers fan all my life, and Reggie had been a Pacer all my life. It was a monumental end to an era for me as a fan fan of the franchise, and it was a point too that I knew everything would change. While I adore these new Pacers and their tenacity, I can't help but think their's something missing. With Reggie Miller on the court, being down 2 with 5 seconds left in regulation was almost as sure a thing as a 25-point blowout (I know we didn't win ALL those games, but with Reggie, you knew it was a shot), and it's still something I hope we can get back to with the guys we got now."
pacers,30esqv,ls215,3,Fri Mar 27 02:07:51 2015 UTC,In that scenario we are missing a coach who can draw up a game winning play. He has one for George Hill but nothing else and we've see that play maybe three times now despite numerous close loses over the last 4-5 years.
pacers,30esqv,h3isenburg,2,Fri Mar 27 02:13:21 2015 UTC,"I love Vogel, but one of the things I've always scratched my head at was why PG would be the one inbounding the ball every time instead of David West (Referring to the two previous years of course). West is a good passer, and PG is our most versatile offensive weapon, sooooo what gives? Why is there not a play where PG gets the ball with 5 seconds left to do his thing? He's proven he can deliver clutch plays, but he's always stuck inbounding. I dunno..."
pacers,30esqv,Pacers31Colts18,6,Fri Mar 27 02:36:27 2015 UTC,"It may sound crazy but when Paul George was guarding Derek Rose in one of the 1st playoff series we've had after that. No one could guard him and then Frank brings this young, lanky kid to do it. Yea, he still couldn't guard Rose but I saw our future in that kid. Our franchise changed after that series. That and when we brought in David West. A lot of people don't realize that without West, we wouldn't have been contenders the past 2 years."

pacers,30esqv,siomi,6,Fri Mar 27 00:01:18 2015 UTC,"Paul George going for 43 against Portland last year. If anybody remembers, at the time, the Pacers and Trailblazers were the two best teams in the NBA. It was still early in the season, but both teams looked like juggernauts and this game had a good amount of hype behind it.  Anyway, Paul George looked like the lovechild of Kobe Bryant and Tracy McGrady in this game. It looked effortless. His mid-range jumpshot was a thing of beauty. And his fourth-quarter heroics were Reggie-like. At one point, he nearly replicated the clutch-three-steal-clutch-three Reggie pulled against the Knicks. I remember thinking as it was unfolding, ""Okay, PG is a superstar. End of discussion.""  We ended up losing the game, but it convinced me that PG is the best player we've had since Reggie in his prime."
pacers,30esqv,jwquigley,3,Thu Mar 26 23:03:21 2015 UTC,That game was amazing. And then the George Hill-Portland game was not too long after that IIRC.

pacers,30esqv,charlos72,6,Fri Mar 27 04:24:30 2015 UTC,"It's definitely not up there with the historic moments, but that was just amazing seeing the Pacers come back from like a 20-point deficit to nearly win the game against the Bulls a little after Christmas.  Half of the stadium were Bulls fans, and it was so gratifying to hear the Pacers fans out-cheer the Bulls during that ridiculous run.  Watson missing the three didn't help, but the comeback was worth it for me."

First, this season is not over, we still have some fight left in us, and we're still right there...I'd say our chances for making the playoffs are somewhere around 25-30%, but it's worth one hell of a fight.   Honestly, as much as I used to say this before, I don't think Hill is overpaid by all that much...Basically, that's about how much veteran players get paid, and it's not really fair to compare his salary to some of the younger point guards (who will no doubt sign much bigger contracts than $8M when their turn to renew comes around).  Hibbert though...Damn, that one hurts. He's scheduled to make $15.5M next year, jesus christ. Also, and this one isn't too popular to say because the dude is just awesome, West is no longer worth the money he's getting paid. $13M for a 12 and 7 player is too much.   All that being said, Hibbert's and West's contract will run out after the next season...In all likelihood, next year will be the least chance for this group to do something big, and then we'll see some fresh faces around."

pacers,30bs5q,DamnCroissants,1 point,Thu Mar 26 02:01:45 2015 UTC,"1) We need to keep Stuckey. He's a phenomenal 6 man. That needs to be our main bench concern.  2) It would be great to have both West and Hibbert back. They are integral to our defense. However, West is getting older and Hibbert's an enigma. If we lost both of them, I think it would be time to really start rebuilding around PG. If they do both opt in, I like our chances next year. One last go of it before the group breaks up.  3) George Hill has really improved this year with PG being out. Some people don't like him because in the past he hasn't been great always, and he can be a turnover machine at times (he's relatively new to being a point guard, the general thought is that the 2 is his natural position. Larry Bird's disdain for true point guards is an entirely different conversation though). I think we should draft a true point guard wherever we fall in the draft, and keep Hill at the 2. If we can trade someone else to move up, that would be fine with me too. But I wouldn't be surprised if we draft a PF and continue to not really have a starting point guard.  4) Re-signing Hibs would be great, but it wouldn't surprise me if they didn't. He's the centerpiece of our defense, and has skills that aren't easy to find in the NBA, even if he can't shoot. If West leaves I would hope they would try to get another veteran PF."
pacers,30bs5q,XC_Stallion92,1 point,Thu Mar 26 04:28:15 2015 UTC,"Just to touch on the West/Hibbert deals, here is my two cents.   West won't opt-out. He pondered retiring right after the PG injury, but stuck it out. I think he comes back for one last shot, especially with how this team has played this year. A healthy PG is going to turn this team completely around. The only way he opts-out in my mind is if he retires, which wouldn't be super surprising given the fact that he's talked about it before. When it comes to Hibbert I think he will opt-in. No one is paying him $15-$16 mil so he might as well take it. My hopes are that the Pacers can possibly get him to re-sign for another 3-4 years but at a drastically reduced pay rate. Somewhere in th $8-$10 mil a year range is perfect. He is not great, and most nights isn't even good, so paying him more than $10 mil a year for his defense and 5 double-doubles a year makes zero sense. He's also a player that I doubt many fans would be too unhappy to see part ways at this point because he's so frustrating to watch."
pacers,30bs5q,Boom_Baby31,1 point,Thu Mar 26 12:47:05 2015 UTC,"I think they definitely resign Stuckey. Scola I think is gone but Stuckey is a must sign.  West will not opt out, he loves it here for not only him but his family too. It's not just about Basketball here, I think West is or has become an Indy native and likes the community. Hibbert is a question mark and has been since last year. I think that long term Hibbert stays simply due to the contract, but after its up I'm not sure if he will be a Pacer due to someone wanting to give him more money than we will. George Hill is playing where he should be playing and that is why you're seeing him improve. He's always had this capability but letting him play more of a 2 rather than a 1 is allowing him to do more things. Giving him the green light to go is really changing his game back to what he was at San Antonio. FA you look to sign a true PG if you don't get one in this draft. Watson is a solid backup and Sloan is a bust(imo) so you need to see if you can get something so that Hill can continue to play more of a SG. Other than that, I'd love to see the Pacers pick up a stretch 4 or another 5 that is more offensive minded."

Love the guy. As long as he's wearing a pacer uniform I will not stop supporting him. Hope you guys feel the same way
pacers,2zv319,irollbrokenfingers,-4,Sun Mar 22 05:22:51 2015 UTC,"I love every player on this team, except Whittington, and even he, I have lots of hope for. I just can't stand to see how shitty their collective attitude is; it's disheartening as a fan to watch Roy get visibly upset running up the court, just to have to pivot at the free throw and run back like he's doing suicides. I love everyone, but I feel like there is poor judgment going around in and outside the locker room that is causing issues on the court."
pacers,2zv319,scottw5150,-2,Sun Mar 22 13:35:01 2015 UTC,"I'm done crying. It seems like I need one overreaction/rant per season, for the way our team always goes through a mid-to-late season crisis. I'm so excited for PG's return, and I will never give up on my Pacers. But I hate feeling helpless in this situation. Why can't I treat Bankers Life like a mosque, and have that actually contribute something?   I demand the kind of control I get in NBA2K, and the closest I've actually came is using the internet and social media to route to get Gerald Green signed. And now, when everyone says he failed here, I feel like I failed. I had a lot of faith in him, and he just didn't pan out. Now, if we didn't have him on the team, we could have had that treasured 2014 draft pick; regardless of how low, there were great players available. It's just how you look at shit."

pacers,2zv319,Wafflecone416,5,Sun Mar 22 21:12:43 2015 UTC,"I just hoped that if we were going to tank, we'd tank the whole season instead of playing ok mid level ball into a 9 game win streak into a shit lose streak  Like now's just not a great time to tank"
pacers,2zv319,iAMtHESushighost,3,Sun Mar 22 02:58:21 2015 UTC,"It's especially frustrating for those of us who have been saying we should have tanked since the beginning of the season, and saw this coming, and nobody on here listened.  It's too bad we will most likely miss out on the playoffs and getting another franchise player. That is unless we hit the jackpot like we did with landing Paul George late in the lottery. Getting Mudiay, Russell, Okafor, or Towns is pretty much out the window."
pacers,2zv319,Frostler,1 point,Sun Mar 22 07:05:18 2015 UTC,"We picked PG at 10th, which is just short of ""mid lottery,"" but still high of ""late lottery."" Even if we ended up with the 9th seed in the East, I don't see us getting the ""benefit of the doubt"" conspiracy and winning the lottery by any means. However, there are a lot more available key players than Mudiay, Russell, Okafor, or Towns. This draft could end up looking better than last year's, and there is a lot of room for someone great to fall to our pick. There's no doubt we'll miss on a couple stars, but I will be so disappointed if we draft someone completely useless."
pacers,2zv319,Frostler,1 point,Sun Mar 22 14:06:16 2015 UTC,"Perhaps a guy like Kevon Looney? 6'9"" pf with 7'1"" wingspan who plays hard, defensive player, good rebounder, plays hard and he's within our range. I'd be surprised if we pass on him if we have a chance, he seems like the kind of guys that bird goes after."
pacers,2zv319,ElJefeDelCine,6,Sun Mar 22 18:26:21 2015 UTC,"You need to calm down brother, if we keep losing (and there is no sign of it stopping) we'll get back into a decent lottery spot and we're guaranteed to get an all-pro superstar back this offseason. Hibbert is probably the most valuable player on the team besides PG and is the key to how we like to play basketball."
pacers,2zv319,Pacers31Colts18,1 point,Sun Mar 22 03:16:26 2015 UTC,"I've calmed. [4]  I'm well aware of a lot of this year's draft stock, but I can't stand the way this team plays. And I'm borderline terrified that whatever all-pro superstar we pick will be the least talented in the roster, and for some reason, I bet it won't be a Kentucky player with ""WINNING / CHAMPIONSHIP EXPERIENCE"" (like Tyler Hansbrough had/has).   Bird's judgement the last few drafts has been far from perfect (NOT HAVING A DRAFT PICK AT ALL LAST YEAR WAS A MISTAKE THAT CANNOT BE FORGIVEN).   Can we take a look at the 2013 Draft? Solomon Hill at #23, who has done well this year, but whose future is far from decided. But let's look at some names drafted after him:   Tim Hardaway Jr. Reggie Bullock RUDY GOBERT (we could use him now) Isaiah Canaan Ray McCallum   Among others who I am sure will be notable in 2-3 years.   And it's still quite unbelievable that we traded away our pick for the last draft. Do you believe that Scola's impact has been better than what Green, Plumlee, and any player picked after #17 in 2014?  Tyler Ennis, Gary Harris, Bruno Caboclo (okay maybe not), Mitch McGary, Jordan Adams, Rodney Hood (wow he'll be a steal), Shabazz Napier (pass-first PG?), PJ Hairston (Really??), Bojan Bogdonavic (the guy that kicked our ass tonight 😒), KJ McDaniels, Joe Harris, Cleanthony Early, Jerami Grant,  Glenn Robinson III, Nick Johnson, Markel Brown, Jordan Clarkson, Russ Smith, Jordan McRae, Cory Jefferson (going 60th is a travesty, but he wanted to play for SAS).  Okay, anyway, I'm just saying, Larry particularly fucked up just to get Scola (who is great, I love the guy), when we should be exploiting every ounce of effort Lavoy Allen has inside him instead."
pacers,2zv319,Frostler,4,Sun Mar 22 04:00:30 2015 UTC,"The Scola trade was excellent at the time, in hindsight we would've rather had the pick but hindsight is 20/20, when we made the trade we were a title contender who just picked up a borderline starting caliber PF to come off our bench for Plumlee (a bench warmer)and Green (completely useless for us)."
pacers,2zv319,Frostler,-3,Sun Mar 22 04:05:30 2015 UTC,"Green is like play-doh, he could be anything we make him into, if we believed in him, which we didn't. I like Scola, and what he has brought has been good. BUT, there is no hindsight about it, the 2014 draft was hyped up two years in advance, Larry should have known that we were going to need that pick.   I think he was both cocky and lazy, in thinking we'd get our championship and need no draft pick, and he didn't want to have to go draft scouting last summer. BLAH"
pacers,2zv319,Pacers31Colts18,4,Sun Mar 22 04:15:01 2015 UTC,"If you think that Gerald Green wasn't given opportunity to succeed here, you clearly were not paying attention. Like Evan Turner after him, he couldn't play defense and it cost the team games, (thinking Minnesota in Minnesota last year as an example). The move for Scola was the right one because the team was pushing for a championship. They didn't get there, but that doesn't make it a bad call."
pacers,2zv319,Duzaman,3,Sun Mar 22 08:12:42 2015 UTC,The problem was Bird left for a year and Donnie Walsh fucked everything up and signed Green and Augustin. We had to find a way to get rid of Green who didn't fit here at all.

Problem was he was so fucking terrible Frank couldn't put him on the floor anymore. I still think the Scola move was fine, I'd rather make a contending team better one year than have the 29th overall pick imo it's a risk worth taking. Both the players from that trade ended up being shit anyways."
pacers,2zv319,pacerpower,1 point,Sun Mar 22 07:33:56 2015 UTC,"Okay, anyway, I'm just saying, Larry particularly fucked up just to get Scola (who is great, I love the guy), when we should be exploiting every ounce of effort Lavoy Allen has inside him instead.   So...the Pacers should have not traded for Scola 2 summers ago and instead went with LaVoy Allen, who was with Philadelphia up until March last year....gotcha."
pacers,2zv319,valteamxblades,2,Sun Mar 22 14:39:10 2015 UTC,"Both Hibberts and George Hill's contracts will be expiring next year. If we're going to make a trade, it will be next year. If our team still stinks even when Paul George is healthy, then I will go into ""blow it up, build around PG"" mode."
pacers,2zv319,h3isenburg,3,Sun Mar 22 04:12:29 2015 UTC,"If that's the case, I think a Hibbert (expiring) trade* might benefit us, if we can find a great center in the draft. He could reel in a star pass-first point guard, as per /u/h3isenburg's consistent advice, and we could re-sign George Hill for a more affordable contract.   * I have no problem keeping Hibbert, if he will re-sign for much less. A real TEAM can take collect pay cuts, even with an increased salary cap, to make moves that make the whole team better. And I really just want us to keep David West until we can make him an assistant coach."
