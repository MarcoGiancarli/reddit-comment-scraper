Some stops on the way up could be Mérida, Salamanca, León (very slightly out of the way).  Back down through Portugal, Oporto and Coimbra would be good candidates.

You will find somewhat easy classes incredibly difficult if you have not mastered the language, or cannot get up to speed very quickly.  That being said, people who study abroad in Spain have life-changing experiences in the country. Different areas of the country differ greatly in people, language, temperature, and more, so it is worth looking up some of this information yourself at least a little bit.  What time would you be going? It can be cold in the Winter/Fall in Cantabria from my knowledge considering its northerly location."

I don't mind the cold and Im used to the heat, so it's not really a huge issue for me.  What do you mean by festive? Like a party atmosphere all the time?"
spain,3dzisg,Joshru,2,Tue Jul 21 14:14:56 2015 UTC,"If you want to party, you will find party. Spanish students, and people in general, love to enjoy life.  Santander and Jaen are both really awesome, epic places. Think about what other areas you will want to visit. If you favor the North, Galicia, and Basque country, then Santander may be the best. Though, as other have noted, people from the north can be a bit 'colder' to new folks (foreigners especially).  People in the South are a lot warmer, as is the weather generally. Think about where you come from, what kind of places you like, what you like to do.  Also, Spring vs. Fall is a big difference for both places! Going from fall to the Winter in Santander will be quite cold. Spring to Summer in Jaen will be quite warm. Take a quick look at the Wiki pages for each city, and maybe even look around in googlemaps at what other sites are close that you'd like."

spain,3dtfb0,mgrx,4,Sun Jul 19 08:34:22 2015 UTC,"In my case, and also in my group of friends, when you want to celebrate your birthday (or anything else worth celebrating) it goes something like ""hey, let's do a bbq at wherever this saturday; I'll bring chuletas, chorizo, panceta and some veggies; you'll bring the drinks."" Same goes if you go to a bar, or to a restaurant or a party...  So yes, you'll spend some money on it but nothing big.  Nobody expects you to full pay for everyone, and if they do it's because they might not be friends but scroungers (had to search for the word, maybe it is not the most appropiate). And if your economic situation is not as good, people will understand an account split or anything according to your possibilities."

It's your birthday, it's your shout. As if it's not bad enough chalking up another year, you have to treat your colleagues and friends to boot. If it's your child's birthday, make sure he /she takes a big bag of sweets to school to share with his / her classmates.   I read this here If that's not the case that'd be good to know, haha.  In regards to casual racism, working to live, and political hot topics I feel that there is some of that everywhere. At least, Canada and the US have those same issues."
spain,3dtfb0,rav44me,7,Sun Jul 19 08:26:41 2015 UTC,"Not sure how it is in other parts of Spain, but here in Madrid, it's very common to throw a birthday party where you invite your friends to a bar (or restaurant, tapas place, movie or music venue) and the birthday person pays for everyone. But it's not generally an all-night thing. When/if you keep the party going by moving to another spot, everyone starts to pay for their own fun, unless specified.   Te invito/Os invito= I'm inviting you to do something and I'm paying  Quedamos/Una quedada=Let's meet and go out together. Everyone pays for his/herself."

spain,3dtfb0,Muerthogar,10,Sun Jul 19 08:35:38 2015 UTC,"The article is a bit of satire mixed with thinly disguised snobbery, but there are truths on it:   Tip 1 - Exaggerated, but sadly it does happen sometimes. Tip 2 - Not everyone tips, but it is not a bad idea to show some appreciation. You might never have to, though, since a lot of people have switched to natural gas. Tip 3 - True. In a typical birthday party you have to prepare the food and drinks, and then ask your friends/family to attend, all by yourself. If you say nothing people will not arrange the party for you. Tip 4 - Duh, it's August, there's a ton of people on holiday, and you will find any Mediterranean beach packed to the rafters. I have no idea why they're talking about kitchen sinks, though. And, needless to say, restaurants are busy but not to that point. Tip 5 - It is true banks are busier in the first hours of the morning, for one reason the article does not explain: those times are usually allotted to the payment of invoices. It depends on the branch, though. And, by the way, even though it is true some people have a coffee and/or a snack at midday (since many people don't have lunch until 3PM), it is not called 'second breakfast' but 'almuerzo'. Tip 6 - While it is true kids are usually allowed to stay much later than usual on holidays, not every parent let their kids run wild. Tip 7 - Please, don't. Whatever these people say, it is not polite to yell at a waiter. Tip 8 - Yes, for different reasons (cultural, geographical) we divide the day differently than other countries, which might take some adjustment. Morning (mañana) is the period between sunrise until lunch time (2-3PM); the afternoon (tarde) is the one until sundown (which in summer can be as late as 10PM); and the evening (noche) is the night time, but as the article say we use the word 'madrugada' to talk about the late hours of the night. Tip 9 - Many businesses and official desks do close in August, but not everything. There are many places that switch from the widely used all-day opening hours to a ""morning"" 8 to 3 shift. Tip 10 - Very true, nothing to add here."
spain,3dtfb0,Four_beastlings,6,Sun Jul 19 09:27:51 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to expand on what /u/inadaptado said       Tip 1, Happens in every country too, tbh, it's just burocrazy.       Tip 2, I haven't seen a butanero in years, still, it pays to be nice to the postman, delivery dudes and everyone who makes your life easier, even if its only because they can make it way harder.        Tip 3, Everyone does it so it evens out, in theory.       Tip 4, Article forgets to mention the hordes of crab people thousands of sunburned drunk foreigners stumbling everywhere. Also, avoid tourist traps, try to find the places the locals go to, they're better and cheaper.        Tip 5, Considering that breakfast in spain means a cup of coffee and a couple cookies, the almuerzo is not a surprise, it's also a very welcome break.      Tip 6, Yes, you can pick up kids and do ""monerias"", help them if they're lost, etc. We don't think everyone is paedophile.       Tip 7, You'll be kicked out, it's illegal to have animals in the bar. Seriously, I worked as waiter for years, you'll get kicked or worst, have some manners.           Tip 8, I always called that period tardenoche, not sure how extended that is."
spain,3dtfb0,blitzzerg,6,Sun Jul 19 15:53:35 2015 UTC,"I'm from Spain and yes, I invite all my friends to watch a movie and eat, but is more courtesy than actuall tradition. If you're planning on doing a birthday and don't want/can't pay their expenses just tell them to bring money and you can all pay equally and they won't probably care. Never seen anyone inviting the birthday guy though."
spain,3dtfb0,LupineChemist,4,Sun Jul 19 08:53:11 2015 UTC,"1.- Look up the required documents on the internet beforehand and you won't have a problem. Being polite to the funcionarios also helps a lot. I always look them in the eyes, smile, and say good morning first thing and they go out of their way to help me.  2.- Butaneros are rare nowadays. Tipping is mostly a restaurant thing anyway.   3.- This has been explained by others in this thread, but the gist of it is if it's your birthday party (not just your birthday) you're are expected to pay for the first round, or feed your friends at home, or treat them in some way. They're expected to buy you presents in return.  4.- Well, d'oh! Yes, beaches are busy in the summer.   5.- 9:00-11:00 is only a bad time for banks, as some old people pay their utility bills physically at the bank every month and said bills can only get paid in that couple hours (I have no idea why). And what the article calls ""segundo desayuno"" is a rare commodity nowadays, and it's more like a (necessary) actual breakfast, as most people just have some coffee and no solid food before they get to work and lunchtime is around 14:00.  6.- Mmmmkay? Yeah, no. Spaniards judge shitty parents just as hard as everyone else. The only true part here is the one about staying up late.  7.- For the love of Om don't EVER do this. You (probably) won't get kicked out of the place, but the server will make a point of ignoring you and everyone else at the bar or restaurant will think you're a rude asshole. Get to the bar, smile at the bartender and say ""Perdona, ¿me podrías poner un café/cerveza/loquesea, por favor?"". Or don't smile and just say ""Un café/cerveza/loquesea, por favor."". I use the first one and i can't remember the last time I received bad service. Just don't go around yelling ""¡Oye!"", as this has rude and belligerent overtones.  8.- Other people explained this one already.  9.- Meh, depends on where you are. August is my fave month to do stuff in Madrid, because half the city has fled and businesses have allll the time in the world to fawn over the rare August clients.  10.- This one is good. Just forget the word ""dialecto"" exists; it will save you a world of trouble. Whatever language people tell you is their regional language, it is a full-on legit language."
spain,3dtfb0,Rc72,3,Sun Jul 19 21:51:33 2015 UTC,"Tip 1: for example, if you want to renew you DNI/passport (your ID Document), you just head to [here],(http://www.interior.gob.es/web/servicios-al-ciudadano/dni/documentacion-necesaria-para-su-tramitacion)  read all the necessary documents that you need to take and that's all  Tip 2: I don't know, I don't use use gas.  Tip 3: if you want to to invite to a round of shots for example is fine, but nobody is going to expect you to do it.  Tip 4: true, but almost the same for July, so you have to find a good place, far away from Benidorm and places like that.  Tip 5: well it depends of the bank office I guess.  Tip 7: I always call the barman saying: ""Perdona"", shouting but polite.  Tip 8: Mañana: 7 - 12  Mediodia 1 - 3   Tarde  4 - 8  Noche 9 - 24 Madrugada 24+++  Tip 9: True but not because they are all closed, but because you don't want to renew your license in a hot summer morning"
spain,3dtfb0,LupineChemist,5,Sun Jul 19 08:57:22 2015 UTC,"Look, if you want to learn the nuances of culture, you're not going to learn it from a crazy blog post. You just kind of have to experience it and nobody can go and tell you what you will get out of it. There's jut far too much to accurately convey how it is universally.  As a response to the article.  Tip 1: I have yet to find a bureaucratic organization that isn't that way. Spain is actually pretty good about putting requirements online. The only real thing I have found that is at all confusing is when dealing with immigration ""passport copy"" means every single page of the passport, not just the ID page. So keep that in mind and follow the rules and you probably won't get burned.  Tip 2: I have only ever had a direct gas line and that is by far the most common in Madrid. I suppose it still exists, but it's increasingly like asking for etiquette about the milkman  Tip 3: Yeah, nobody is going to go out of their way to do anything for your birthday. It is your birthday and just another day for them after all. It's customary to bring some sweets or pastries to work or something, but it balances out by everyone else's birthday throughout the year where you get it on their dime.  If you go out with some close friends, you might buy a round to celebrate but that's about it, really.  It's been mentioned elsewhere but be careful about the meaning of the word invitar, in Spanish there is an explicit expectation of paying for whatever when using that word. Quedar is the word for just meeting up.  Tip 4: It's kind of rich having a Brit complain about the number of Spaniards on the Mediterranean beaches. Yeah, it's crowded in vacation season, a lot of that is due to foreigners as well.  Tip 5: This sounds like a small town thing. I couldn't imagine a banker just straight-up fucking off for a huge amount of time in working hours in Madrid. They already have some of the best working hours around. The thing you really want to watch out for are the señoras that have nothing to do so will just try to use the time to get extra conversation in. (This is exceptionally bad at the public doctor)  Tip 6: Is the tip kids are annoying? I don't understand at all, or why it's specific to Spain. I mean, in places where families go, kids play. Poorly behaved kids exist in every country and are annoying in every country. Places where family congregate also happen to like children, this just sounds like a miser who goes to places that they find miserable.  Tip 7: I would find it really weird and kind of rude if someone just straight up shouted ""oye"" at a bartender. Depends entirely on the situation, just like everywhere else. If it's a quiet place with plenty of space, the raised finger and a ""perdona"" will work just fine. If it's a bit more hectic, I would lift up my hand and a bit more forceful of a ""perdón"". It's using context based on the situation, not some cultural minefield.  Tip 8: Yeah, morning is before lunch, that's the same as the English world. Just that lunch is later. We also work later and I would say ""tarde"" is just fine as a word for evening and you will hear ""tarde noche"" for late evening. That said, it's just how vocabulary is used, don't say ""esta noche"" to meet after work because night generally means after dinner so like 10pm onward.  Tip 9: This depends, I often love do do things in August because there are fewer people around. Generally it makes it so the supply matches the demand since everyone using the services is also gone. That said, be mindful of early closings in August.  Tip 10: This is pretty regional and starts to get WAY more complicated than it would be reasonable to go into here. So for now, in Madrid it's fine to refer to the Spanish language as español. When talking about other languages in Spain or in a place where there is a minority language generally go with castellano as it's true that they may feel very Spanish but don't want that to be the sole association with the language.  Basically this list is from someone who spent a few months and has just enough knowledge to be dangerous."

Pay in the private sector probably won´t be too much, unless you have some sort of supplemental income or plan on rooming with some one it might be difficult to make ends meet.

If you're a guest keep your shoes on, if you're staying in  someones house, usually they offer you slippers or flip flops. It's considered rude to take your shoes off Eating dinner after 9-10. Most kitchens don't even open until after 8. Lunch is eaten at around 3/4. Spaniards tend to have a a coffee break or breakfast at around 12. Siesta time is usually from 2-5, especially in the summer. You won't have so much of a problem in bigger cities and with chain stores. But most small stores and local businesses close at this time to beat the heat On that note, everything closes on sundays, even the big stores...usually only the chinos are open (chinos are corner stores run by chinese people) related! I know you dismissed casual racism as something that occurs everywhere, but it is a special kind of beast here, so just be aware. I'm half chinese and my mother-in-law calls me 'mi chinita' which means 'my little chinese girl'. I've seen people wearing black face and fifties asian costumes on national tv. And don't even start arguing with a  spanish person about why something is racist...they are stubborn and won;t believe you Customer service is generally at a lower level here than in canada, and you are not required to tip, but you can if you want.

spain,3dtfb0,ArticLabs,9,Sun Jul 19 14:49:25 2015 UTC,"And don't even start arguing with a spanish person about why something is racist...they are stubborn and won;t believe you   Spaniard here,  Im my opinion, most people in Spain arent racist, except some old, conservative people are against muslims.  We make fun of people, that's all. At least on my environment, people don't look you down/insult you if you are Asian, they will make fun of you, the same way they make fun of someone for being fat/tall/short/whatever. And they make fun not to hurt you, but as a way to be more casual/friendly.   In spain we don't have the politically correctness phobia you guys have in the US, so we just talk without fear of society judging us."
spain,3dtfb0,manueslapera,-7,Sun Jul 19 15:10:56 2015 UTC,"I don;t think Spanish people are racist, I just don't think that they understand why I consider the Spanish basketball team pulling asian eyes to be insulting. Or why watching a game on los hormigueros about trying to figure out what spanish song chinese people are singing is insulting.   I am half chinese and have never experienced outright racism in Spain. No one looks down on me, is mean to me or treats me differently. But lack of outright racism does not mean that it is okay for people to dress up as a 'stereotypical' asian for halloween. I'm sorry, but silk kimonos, tricorn hats and a long black wig in a ponytail is insulting, no matter which way you slice it. Maybe it's funny for fellow spaniards, but it is not funny for me.   Your last sentence is exactly what I experience in Spain all the time whenever I say something is ""racist"". Everyone here is very defensive about it and constantly tries to justify it.   I am from CANADA by the way (you proved my point above that everyone will think canadians are american). Specifically, I am from Vancouver. In my opinion, vancouver proudly embraces the fact that we are a country of immigrants. We are a huge mix of asians, caucasians, brown people, south americans etc. I make jokes with my friends about asians not being able to drive, about brown people being mooches etc. I do not care so much about being overly politically correct. But there is a line, and I know it. Black face? Crossing the line. Native american dress? Crossing the line. Dressing up as 'asian' for halloween? Crossing the line.   The jokes I make with my friends? Casual, friendly, said in a joking way and not meant to be insulting. No one actually believes the stereotypes, we're just teasing. Imitating another race in a stereotypical fashion or making jokes at their expense is not casual nor friendly. These are not jokes made between friends, about friends. these are jokes meant for other spanish people, exclusive of the race they are making fun of.   Sorry for the essay, but this is something that really bothers me about Spain. As much as I love the country, it has a long way to go."
spain,3dtfb0,Kikekakako,11,Sun Jul 19 17:24:32 2015 UTC,"Your perspective is really interesting. I'm Spanish, and I learned just the other day that we Spaniards have a reputation to be huge ""casual racists"". It does make sense now that I think about it, because of all the things that you've mentioned, but as u/manueslapera says, that's a result of our attitude towards political correctness, which in general is that we don't like it and Americans (and other countries) are way too sensitive and annoying.  I know that in other countries dressing up as an ""stereotypical Asia"" for Carnival would be considered racist, but it had never occurred to me to think about it that way. Dressing up as another nationalities' typical dress is very common in Carnival, and the intention is not to make fun of anyone, I swear: I wore disguises like those at 8 years old, when I obviously didn't mean to make fun of Asians. It's a disguise because it's not a thing I would usually wear.  I ask you to consider this: it's not unusual to dress up with the typical dress of another region in Spain. I'm from Galicia, and as a child, I once went as a ""chulapona"" for Carnival (Madrid's typical dress). My mom thought it was a beautiful dress. I also see people disguised as ""sevillanas"" here. We're really not trying to make fun of people from Madrid or Andalucía.  We dress up as other professions, as well. We dress up as nuns and priests, and even ""sexy nun"" and ""sexy priest""!   I'm not saying you don't have a right to be offended, but I think it's correct that the reason behind this ""casual racism"" is that we don't take political correctness so seriously, and this is true in every aspect, not only in the race thing."
spain,3dtfb0,manueslapera,-2,Sun Jul 19 18:58:34 2015 UTC,"Well in Canada we definitely dress up as professions to and ""sexify"" them, so thats not really a problem. For me it's a different than dressing up as a stereotypical race. For example, dressing up as a sushi chef wouldn't be a problem for me.  When people dress up as ""asian"" here, they aren;t doing it as a respect for the culture or because it's a beautiful dress (dress up as a geisha then or a samurai, I have no problem with that). They are doing it because to them, it's funny and ridiculous. The joke is meant for other spaniards. They dress up as a 'race' and use traditionally derogative stereotypes to achieve that.   You can tease and make jokes and have fun without using insulting stereotypes, and that's my problem. I would also like to point out that I don't mind jokes about other countries, people tease me about canada al the time. My problem is with derogative stereotypes.  Anyways, thank you for being respectful. I haven't been to galicia yet, but I would love to go one day."
spain,3dtfb0,VamosXeneizes,4,Mon Jul 20 11:33:44 2015 UTC,"Not offended Still not offended I might buy this Foreigners dressed as matadores or folkloricas? Not offended.

Have you seen Fawlty Towers' Manuel in action? That's hilarious. 8 apellidos maños sketch? Jose Mota is less funnier every year, but still not offended despite that I can't find a stereotype more derogative [for me personally] than that. We make fun of everyone and everything?

Should i get offended because of US/Canada's citizens ignorance? I live in NYC (and work with US folks and canadians mind you), and i have been asked a lot of questions that would make some people go mad.   Questions like:   Oh you are from spain, your currency is pesos, right? Oh you are from spain, you must like spicy food Oh you are from spain, do you guys have zoos there?   The fact is, i don't get offended. Why? because i know that the purpose of the person asking is curiosity, not making fun of my country.  Should i get offended when someone makes such an offensive question? Of course not, they are just curious.   Something similar happens in Spain. For us, wearing a costume of a japanese samurai is the same as wearing a women dress when you are a guy. Nothing else.  One of my favorite jokes when im with americans is just telling them 'that's racist!' to whatever they say. Its funny/sad to see them defending themselves like if they had actually said something wrong."

I roll my eyes  and see it as a chance to explain what Canada is like. Another example is that Spanish people often seem surprised that Canada has a different currency than american. It doesn't insult me. Before I met my boyfriend, I knew nothing about Spain, he is the one who taught me and showed me Spanish culture. Just like I hope you do with the Americans over there.  Can I please point out that there is a difference between America and Canada? It's similar to the difference between Spain and France. Both Mediterranean countries but not exactly the same because of it... I say this because the joke you do with americans would not make me feel like I needed to defend myself. I would probably just be confused. Canadians are more relaxed than americans about this kind of thing (i.e. constantly needing to explain that they are not racist)  Anyways, My point is is that, although those kinds of ignorant questions can be annoying, I am not talking about that in terms of casual racism. I am talking about mocking a race via derogative stereotypes. Dress up as a japanese samurai, that wouldn't bother me, but please do not do squinty eyes. Please do not talk in a ridiculous accent. That is what is insulting for me."
spain,3dtfb0,Kikekakako,3,Mon Jul 20 11:52:22 2015 UTC,"That is what is insulting for me.   That is my main point, that what is considered as insulting for one person from one culture is not considered as such for another person from another culture. So that person is not racist, he/she is not making squinting eyes to offend you, he/she is just from a different culture."

spain,3dqh5d,waltzintomordor,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:33:52 2015 UTC,It's bullshit. They didn't buy the airport. They got the exploitation rights.
spain,3dqh5d,Tigrezno,6,Sun Jul 19 08:53:53 2015 UTC,"One thing to consider is that buyers must pay all the unpaid taxes and fees that have been accumulated over the years by the ghost airport. This cost can be very expensive, surely more than 10000€."
spain,3dqh5d,jogeid,7,Sat Jul 18 18:39:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, chiming in from an empresario point of view.  Those are just the rights to use the airport. As you mentioned, it's all the liabilities as well. On top the facilities are pretty much unusable at the moment and there will have to be a lot of investment just to get it usable. It actually seems like a really good idea to use it as a pure cargo port as a way to just get Chinese stuff into the Customs Union and distributed from there. Honestly, if they can keep costs down, they might rob Barajas from a bunch of cargo traffic. IAG (Iberia) is probably happy about it as it will free up even more take off and landing slots at Madrid to allow even more passenger traffic and their plans to make it into a much bigger hub.  But yeah, the point is there is still a lot of investment to go into this before it starts generating cash flow. I would guess 70-100 million euros. Most of that will depend exactly to what level the runway needs to be rebuilt."

They are not mandatory because up until recently, there was no need, everyone vaccinated their children  I would totally support a law that requires people to be vaccinated if they want a visa"

It's just nobody can challenge the law until it's actually used. You can't just challenge because you don't like it, you have to have actual damages either criminal or civil.  (Spanish civil law is different from common law, but you still need standing)  Even more importantly, it's increasingly clear there won't be a clear majority after the elections this year and every single party except for the party in charge is against the law so it will be unlikely to survive the formation of a new parliament.

spain,3dekxa,alexgmcm,8,Thu Jul 16 19:30:36 2015 UTC,"I'm a dual citizen of the US and Spain with a question. US law says if you go to work for a foreign government or enlist in a foreign military you will be automatically resigning your US citizenship and will have to pay the ""exit tax"" all ex-pats do. Is this still true between the US and Spain considering the dual citizenship agreement?  Enlistment was mandatory until around 15 years ago, so all of my male relatives have been through the military. And based on what I have heard, I can't imagine why anyone would leave California to join the military in Spain. Your economic and social mobility is severely limited in Spain.  I love my country (ok, countries) and if you want to join las fuerzas armadas españolas that is fine with me. But I think you are making a rash decision. You are in your early 20s, right? I think everyone at some point has that ""exodus"" moment. For me, it was after my gf of 10 years broke up with me at age 24. I started to pine for California, even applied to jobs out there and started looking for apartments. I live in NY so this would be a major, life-altering move for me.  Until a friend told me something that stuck with me to this day: ""Wherever you go, there you are."" I was running away from my problems and running away from my identity which I hated... It would have been the wrong decision to move to California at that time and I'm glad I didn't. With time, and some effort, I managed to get my life back on track. I know things must seem really ""up in the air"" right now what with not being able to finish college. But I promise it always looks worse when you're in the thick of it. Think about everything carefully before you decide, because this decision in particular could have some severe consequences if you lose your citizenship.  I also promise the USA looks a lot more appealing as soon as you move somewhere else. The grass is always greener on the other side.  Best of luck to you."

What you need to understand is that a botellón is normally not a ""party"" in the sense that somebody designates a place and time and anybody can attend. A botellón initially just meant a group of friends drinking on the street. What usually happens (even more now that they are restricted and regulated) is that different groups gather in the same place because it is the most convenient one, but it doesn't necessarily mean they expect interacting with others as you would in a party. So if you approach one of these groups they might be open to others or not."
spain,3dcrbw,inadaptado,10,Wed Jul 15 10:42:04 2015 UTC,"I guess botellóns differ from place to place, in Catalunya (not BCN) no one will just let you join and drink for free, it's a friends-only type of event, and there are no ""designated"" places that I ever heard of, you just talk to your friends and decide ""on the go"" where do you want to stop and have a drink, usually in a park or a parking lot, because the car's trunk can serve as a makeshift ""table"" haha  I'd never think about wondering alone and invite myself to a botellón that has nothing to do with me."
spain,3dcrbw,ylcard,7,Wed Jul 15 11:39:03 2015 UTC,"First of all you have to know it is illegal. There was a time that even selling alcohol after 8pm was illegal in Madrid (it is not anymore, though). Most of the times if police sees you walking by with bags with ice, rum and coke you will be stopped and warned.   Now this being said, there are some places where you can still drink outdoors at night, let's say the City Hall and police are botellón-friendly. Zones with no neighbors and such.   If you are in a beach town, more likely some zones by the sea shore, off the promenade, with some street lamps but not 'in the middle of everything'.   If you are in an inland city usually parks or Industrial Parks near party zones, but it works the same way, not in busy streets.   Also it never (or almost never) happens in the middle of a street. You have to know beforehand where to go. Oh, and it is only on Friday and Saturday nights.  During my teens and a bit deep in my twenties I have done botellón all over Spain and never got caught.   In Madrid the botellón zone is Parque Del Oeste, between Paseo de Ruperto Chapi street and Avenida Arco de la Victoria or Paseo de Moret. Metro: Moncloa, but it depends on where you want to go after. Check /r/Madrid wiki for party zones. Also maybe Ciudad Universitaria metro, but since it is summer University is closed. I have never done botellón in other place than that in Madrid! And please remember always to pick up the trash!!! It is a shame to see the parks next morning...   Long time ago it was also 'Jumbo Park' next to Alfonso XII metro stop but I'm not sure kids go there anymore.   Unfortunately I will be in Valencia this weekend!"
spain,3dcrbw,enodium,9,Wed Jul 15 08:35:02 2015 UTC,"Not correcting but complementing that info... botellón is usually regulated locally, so each city might have different policies about it.  E.G.: In my hometown, Granada, it is illegal all over the city except for a specific square which is actually called ""botellódromo""; and it usually happens thursday to saturday (now in summer is much less crowded, as most of students / young people are not in the city). Apart from that there are some squares/places where you might find people not doing botellón but maybe having some beers in small groups, knowing there is always the risk of getting caught. But if you aren't noisy and you avoid bothering people nearby and it usually isn't such a problem."

I wouldn't do a botellon out of a designated area unless it is really crowded, just being ""off the radar"" might not be enough, after all, fines are money and the Ayuntamiento can always find something to do wit hthe money."

Nah, in all seriousness, you will be able to fully get deep into the Spanish language, unlike other big cities where they speak two languages like Bilbao (basque), Barcelona (catalan), Valencia (Valencian) or even Sevilla (really hard accent in the south of Spain, like in the US Texas, for example).   Aside from the language, you will be able to speak both English or French all over the city with almost everybody if you need it, and you will find lots of schools, academies, language courses, theatres, cinemas, tablao flamenco...   On the other hand, you will learn the most authentic Spanish in Salamanca, Valladolid or Talavera de la Reina, for example. Smaller cities. Your experience will be more authentic, you will find also Spanish academies but the smaller the city the less opportunities (for everything, from cinemas to culture in general)"

I'd say if you want to be immersed in the culture and language then head to a small city/town, because even though Madrid is an amazing city, you will easily be able to find expats everywhere. No matter where you end up, you will have a fantastic experience!"
spain,3da990,cait8,3,Tue Jul 14 20:37:15 2015 UTC,I would head to Valladolid first. Next choices would be Salamanca/Burgos/León All of those places have a generally neutral accent. I say Valladolid first because fewer people there will speak English in the first place so it will force your immersion even more. Salamanca is a big student destination so it's easier to slip into English and León/Burgos are both on the Camino de Santiago so there is relatively more English (though still very low)
spain,3da990,LupineChemist,2,Tue Jul 14 21:11:19 2015 UTC,"people have made some pretty good points here. I studied abroad in madrid and learned more spanish in the first 3 weeks than in the previous 4 years of schooling. The experience is what you make it... I failed my required grammar course while there but would say I am fluent and have test advanced mid for the actfl.   it doesn't matter where you go, if you want to speak english you will and if you want to speak spanish you will. my advice is watch at least 1 spanish movie a week before you go. listen to spanish music and watch the news in spanish while you are over there. immersion will teach you far more than any class can.   also download Spanishdict (ios and android) and spanish verbtrainer. spanish dict will work offline and give you the translation for every word. spanish verb trainer will give you every tense of almost everyverb with the translation. both apps helped me a lot. finally,  write everything down. i kept a little notebook (pocketsized) and wrote every word and expression i learned. It really helped me to retain the information.  all the best"

I have a degree in Spanish Literature and  studied abroad (American here) at the University of Leon, I'm also of Spanish descent and my family lives in Madrid who I visit fairly often. School is great. Butttt IMHO you will learn more and faster simply through immersion than worrying about school to learn. I learned more Spanish in Spain from the Spanish friends I made there hanging out in bars than I ever did in equivalent time studying, so 1st let me put forward Leon as an awesome place because there are not than many english speakers there and it is still a mid sized city with easy access to the rest of Spain, and second figure out somewhere you want to go and where you can get to other places on day/weekend trips to use as a base of operations.

Employment figures are recovering but still very high (more than 20%) and new contracts are usually short term and low wages.  And as Areshian says, corruption is still and unresolved issue that most people feel only can be tackled kicking out traditional parties.  Not only left wing parties are rising, some right-centrists too, people from all angles demands a regeneration of politics."
spain,3d2kgi,compluto,7,Mon Jul 13 04:59:59 2015 UTC,"Spain has been traditionally a leftish country, and has a leftist goverment whenver the left wind people actually goes to vote (Right wingers are more likely to vote always while left wingers not always do).  The true success of Aznar and why he's so loved among the rigth wing is that he managed to unify the right wing in a time in which it seemed it'd be impossible to kick PSOE out of the goverment. The left has always been fragmented, while there was only PP at the right, there were two major left parties, PSOE and IU comepting for the left vote. This is all leaving aside regional parties such as CIU or PNV and so that only get votes in their home provinces.  Anyway, now the right is starting to fracture while podemos is somehow managing to unify the left, leaving aside the PSOE. Right wing parties have popped out of nowhere and are taking voters away from PP aswell, so its going to be an interesting november.  And, unlike the Greeks, most of spanish think that our problems come from the corruption of our political ""elite"" rather than from europe, there is a sudden urge to kick the current major parties out of the game hoping that it help curb corruption.  As for the employment rate, while it might be going down it doesn't necesarily mean there are more jobs avaliable. Migration and people stopping signing up for unemployment is what get those numbers down, when you actually check the number of the new Seguridad Social affiliates (bassically, the number of people who's actually working and paying taxes), the numbers are far from impressive."
spain,3d2kgi,Nerlian,2,Mon Jul 13 10:40:59 2015 UTC,What do you think about Ahora en Comun? Will it split Podemos? Will the left after the things that happened in Greece do worse than anticipated?
spain,3d2kgi,Nortasungabe,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:05:20 2015 UTC,"Podemos doesn't have a platform big enough to compete on a national level. Ahora en comun is a melting pot of the minor left parties that have been spreading regionally so, together, they can face the bigger stablished parties without really being one.  In some regions Podemos already runs within Ahora en comun. In my rather humble opinion, Ahora en Comun is another step fordward to unify the left (leaving aside PSOE) and trying for a better result that Podemos had in the last regional elections.  It is more likely to me that Ahora en comun helps podemos gain more votes in places where they don't have that much representation beacuse some other minor party is getting the results rather than taking votes away from them.  But thats my opinion, I'm not that expert."

spain,3d2kgi,Nortasungabe,21,Tue Jul 14 14:22:14 2015 UTC,"Those figures are maked up and everyone knows it. They changed the way they calculate GDP this year to maximize the figure, including such bizarre things as income from drugs and prostitution. Unenployment can simply not drop by that much with the current state of things. Traditionally, Spain has been very inefficient at converting GDP increase into unemployment descend; we have never created jobs with a GDP below 3%, and that's by the old methods of accounting. Thus, the unemployment predictions are rigged by the new GDP too.  Meanwhile, Spain misses its payments to international science funds and is about to be kicked off of the most important radiotelescopes, ESA, CERN, the international chemistry organization and most other major european research councils. I am more familiar with these topics, but I can only assume that in other major sectors driving growth in the long term are in similar situations.  The parties are incredibly corrupt and they are not repairing the economy by any measure. This would require reforms that would cut out certain groups of insiders that make great profit through the system. The parties are not committed to the economy at large, they are just in a ""damage containing"" mode to help the country hold it together while their buddies cash in the rest of their investments.  And then there is the populists at Ciudadanos, Podemos, and the local parties; with lots of wishful-thinking and little solid program. But seeing that the traditional parties do not give a fuck about doing their job properly, the populists are our best chance at sacking those leechers. Then we would need to rationalize those governments and get rid of the most radical nutjobs, but it's better to worry about that after we get our only chance at removing the rotten extractive elite."

In 2004-2011 did a terrible job with economy. Nowadays PSOE seems to be corrupted and need to be heavily renovated. It completely lacks credibility, they seem to vote for personal interests.  His current leader ""Pedro Sánchez"" is not very charismatic, but he is slowly growing in popularity. Some people say he is Ken Carson (Barbie's boyfriend). The PSOE has many unconditional voters.  -Podemos ""We can""  Left-wing. A new party who vividly attack and is attacked by other parties, specially PP.  This strong criticism attract votes from young people.  The biggest problem had been that ""Juan Carlos Monedero"" worn more than 400.000€ from some work related to Venezuela. Since then, Podemos and his leader ""Pablo Iglesias"" who is a skilled spokesman is falling in popularity.  Related parties got the Mayor of some important cities like Madrid and Barcelona. They seem to be doing a credible job.  The Greek debacle is strongly related with Podemos since Europe is forzing some authoritarian right-wing politics in every euro country, and Podemos was founded explicitly to fight against these politics.  -IU ""United Left""  Left-wing. A dying party with low charisma.  -Ahora en común ""Now in common""  A new initiative which doesn't agree the way ""Pablo Iglesias"" is handling primaries in ""Podemos"".  -EQUO  Five year old green and left-wing party which probably did a better job than IU but lacks a charismatic leader. Dying party.    Center/right:  -C's ""Citizens""  Right-wing anti-separationist party which claim to be in the center. His leader ""Albert Rivera"" is a very skilled spokesman. This party does have a program, but it's a right-wing one. Nobody reads it, anyway.  -UPyD ""Union, Progress and Democracy""  Center,  anti-separationist. Dying party. Good job attacking corruption, but her previous leader and cofounder ""Rosa Díez"" seemed too prepotent.  -PP ""People's Party""  Right-wing. Chatolic, anti-separationist, Monarchist party. Heavily corrupted and related to Franco's dictatorship. They will always get unconditionally 25% or more votes."

There are many reasons why VAT is generally a very regressive tax. Even with reduced brackets, rich people pay a very little percentage more than poor ones. Here you can find some info about it.  Your second point could be right in isolation, but you are leaving out how they would collect taxes in other ways (including very un-right wing methods like estate taxes). I mean, here's a verbatim quote from their website: ""Necesitamos un sistema fiscal que permita recaudar más sin subir los impuestos, sino haciendo que quienes tienen más, paguen más, persiguiendo el fraude y eliminando deducciones y exenciones.""  Even if you somehow don't agree, those are two things against a plethora of very progressive social policies (abortion, secularism, public education, cannabis, prostitution), a hard stance against labour market dualism, wage complements for lower incomes, etc."
spain,3d2kgi,Bigardo,0,Mon Jul 13 19:12:13 2015 UTC,"Ok, VAT is a very regressive tax, but in your link it shows that poorest pays 12.3% in average and richests pays 13.7%. That's something. An raising VAT to 18% will damage more the poorest than the rich, because it's not a progressive TAX. Therefore, if we are to raise and make a single VAT for everyone, poorest should be compensated.  The second point is just Albert Rivera playing with words. We all agree in pursue tax fraud, but one thing is what Albert Rivera says on tv, in a very ambiguous way, and another is what is on his program.  About very progressive social policies, I agree with that. On some themes C's is left-winged, if that means anything."
spain,3d2kgi,autowikibot,2,Mon Jul 13 22:42:04 2015 UTC,"How is a tax in which rich people pay 1.5% more than poor people something? Again, you can't look at that in isolation. Raising VAT to 18% all across the board won't damage the poorest more when there are other measures that would greatly benefit them (including wage supplements, how can you miss that?) while making higher incomes take the hit with other taxes. That's also without taking a look at their stance against the dual labour market, which is probably the single most important thing they have to help lower incomes.  In the second point you seemed to miss the part about higher incomes paying more.  If anything, you just proved why Ciudadanos won't have a chance. It's the only party proposing a complete overhaul of fiscal policies and people from any part of the spectrum are going to nitpick single measures without looking at the big picture."

Spain is ruled by friends, so if you aren't friends with someone you probably won't get treated like a friend, and if you see someone who was treated better than you for no apparent reason, you will probably think it's due to racism, when in reality it's due to you not being friends with that guy.  This happens in smaller places, like small bars where you have regular clients, or small towns where everyone knows each other. So if you go to a common touristical destination I wouldn't worry.   There are assholes, but like /u/metropolitano said, there is more or less  the same asshole density here than in every other place."

We swear quite a lot, stare shamelessly if something catches our attention and describe people by their most characteristic features.   There is casual racism, again depends on your sensibility. But things like stereotypes for each nationality are used, this also has to do with the fact that immigration is fairly recent here and you still have a lot of niche jobs. For example in Madrid Chinese people have dollar stores and clothing stores, Pakistanis have electronics shops, Senegal people sell counterfeits in the street... We don't find things like this offensive.   You absolutely don't need to worry about your physical safety (or at least not more than anywhere else). The only thing you might have problems is with police, they can be assholes and are used to racially profile to fill quotas for immigration offenses.

For example, hosts of programs on national television dressing up as a stereotypical chinese from the fifties, i.e. shiny silk fabric, long, thin mustache and the triangle pointed hat (i saw this on two-three different shows). Celebrity guests on talk shows pulling back the skin around their eyes to make 'chinese eyes' Even the language! Spanish people say ""work like a chinese"" if you work very hard and ""work like a black (person)"" if you are ""working like a slave""  It definitely bothers me, and my spanish friends can't seem to understand why.

It is not just Spain that exhibits this, it is just that it is more apparent to me here than elsewhere.

Ethnocentricism means that I judge other ethnicities thinking that mine is better, for clarification. Well, that's untrue. Here, people are judged  according to common stereotypes that happen. (Maybe because of confirmation bias, but that's another topic) So, British people in Spain are either old retired ones that want sun, or young crazy ones that come here to get wasted. That's stereotypical, yes. Untrue, probably, 50% are like the stereotype, 50% aren't, so those get misjudged. But ethnocentric, no.

It is like ""my village is superior, all others are bad and the ones outside the province is not worthy talking to"".  I can go on and stereotype about other stuff I don't like with spaniards but it is somewhat irrelevant to the topic and given that every post I have posted here has been downvoted I doubt it will do any good.

Brits are far less etnocentric than spaniards in this regard and their global superpower reign ended less than a hundred years ago.

spain,3cxf9e,VamosXeneizes,10,Sat Jul 11 17:58:51 2015 UTC,but they exist in Spain?
spain,3cxf9e,CripstopherWalken,-13,Sat Jul 11 18:14:21 2015 UTC,"yes but they're not ""Spanish"""
spain,3cxf9e,VamosXeneizes,10,Sat Jul 11 18:19:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for contributing to the conversation, what would we do without you."
spain,3cxf9e,gnark,3,Sun Jul 12 14:48:01 2015 UTC,"in terms of price, AhorraMas is the closest resembling a Walmart but it is mostly for food.  Dia is also a grocery/food supermarket, slightly more expensive than AhorraMas but you get the cheap feeling as soon as you step in.  Carrefour is more like target - Walmart for the middle class.   ElCorte Ingles is a proper mall, you can find pretty much anything and happens to be very popular with the older generation.   Moving higher in the price scale you find Sanchez Romero, which is mostly expensive and gourmet food. Closest to the WholeFoods concept without the hipsters and catering to the elder/posh market.  Anyway the variety of products of your average american supermarket is unparallaled in Spain so you'll find yourself hopping from place to place to buy everything else besides food."
spain,3cxf9e,suicide_monday,4,Sun Jul 12 00:32:02 2015 UTC,"I agree with Carrefour; while it is as pointed out a French multinational, it is likely the most widely used multi-purpose shopping mall in Spain, even though it may not have the variety of Wal-Mart (never been to the US, so I'm not familiar with it).  For just groceries and weekly shopping, the most usual choices are Mercadona and Consum in my region, although those may vary in different parts of Spain."
spain,3cxf9e,HappyReaper,3,Sat Jul 11 18:20:34 2015 UTC,"The closest thing is probably Carrefour. In my opinion many Carrefour stores are not that different from Wal-Mart if you take into account certain cultural differences. The biggest difference is that they don't sell prescription drugs. El Corte Inglés is a department store like Macy's. I personally never found Wal-Mart that amazing, but I understand its appeal."
spain,3cxf9e,MistShinobi,2,Sat Jul 11 18:34:08 2015 UTC,"Carrefour is right, but on a much smaller scale. Alcampo is very similar too"
spain,3cxf9e,hematocritico,2,Sat Jul 11 21:46:48 2015 UTC,The only real aternative to WalMart/Costco in Spain is Makro
spain,3cxf9e,manueslapera,4,Sun Jul 12 01:05:02 2015 UTC,But you have to have a business license to shop at Makro.
spain,3cxf9e,gnark,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:48:43 2015 UTC,"Costco is in Spain now. One is open in Sevilla and another 2 are opening in Madrid this year and some more in BCN. So far, only the Getafe location has been announced."

spain,3cxf9e,manueslapera,2,Sun Jul 12 17:58:43 2015 UTC,"You can tell half the people in this thread have never had a car. These things definitely exists (generally referred to as hipermercado) but nearly 95% of them are most easily accessed by cars. Though in Madrid there are Carrefours accessible by Metro in Hortaleza, Aluche, and La Gavia. Alcampos with transport access in Pío XII, Moratalatz (just bus) and Alcorcón (though that one is MUCH easier by car)"
spain,3cxf9e,LupineChemist,2,Sun Jul 12 06:30:37 2015 UTC,"Hi, the most similar thing to a Wall Mart would be a Carrefour or Alcampo, Hipercor would be too but it's not as cheaper as those. If you're looking for near and in the middle of the city shops you should look for Mercadona that is mainly focused on groceries. You will find too: Dia, Condis, Lidl, Supersol, Ahorramas, Carrefour Express, Caprabo, Eroski...  Oh... i forgot...MAKRO but it's hard to go inside cause is mainly bussiness oriented. Maybe you have a friend that could let you his pass..."
spain,3cxf9e,pasamelo,3,Sun Jul 12 18:30:59 2015 UTC,"not the same as wal-mart, but 'el corte ingles' is definitely spanish."
spain,3cxf9e,jt32470,3,Sat Jul 11 18:29:15 2015 UTC,Seems like el corte is more of an analog to shopping malls generally.
spain,3cxf9e,waltzintomordor,11,Sat Jul 11 18:39:44 2015 UTC,I would say it's a Spanish version of Macy's. It's still a department store.
spain,3cxf9e,amberes,2,Sat Jul 11 19:13:16 2015 UTC,Fair enough.
spain,3cxf9e,waltzintomordor,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:43:13 2015 UTC,"El corte inglés is like a do-all shopping place. From uber expensive pata negra, to stylysh clothes.

They didn't accept any help from the family which are swimming in money"
spain,3cxf9e,jt32470,4,Sat Jul 11 19:45:57 2015 UTC,What's special about Wal-Mart? Maybe it's similar to Gros Mercat?

spain,3cxf9e,VamosXeneizes,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:58:20 2015 UTC,"There are some really big Hipercors that almost match the scale and selection of a huge American Walmart, but they aren't nearly as widespread. A big city might have one or two that big. A smaller province might not have any at all. I've never seen a Carrefour or an Alcampo as big as the massive Walmarts that have sprouted up in the past decade in the US, but maybe a few exist in the far reaches of the suburbs. The thing is, in Madrid, my small neighborhood stores offer more or less the same prices (and better quality and selection), so it just doesn't make sense to go through that hassle."
spain,3cxf9e,ultimomono,0,Mon Jul 13 10:41:30 2015 UTC,Honestly if you find out let me know. I don't think there is any store in Spain (or Europe for that matter) that quite matches Wally Werl's ubiquity of sales. I'm now in the Walmart capital of the world (Arkansas) and it's a godsend being able to go there for literally anything I can think of whenever I want.
spain,3cxf9e,secaedelcielo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:43:35 2015 UTC,"I lived in a few different countries in Europe, never found a store I could go to and pick up everything I needed like Walmart. Auchan (Al Campo) is probably closest, but the selection is a bit lacking compared to Wal-mart, not to mention it's more expensive. I don't know why you're getting downvoted. It's a convenience that once you have, is hard to leave. It's difficult to get used to going all over town to pick up different stuff."

My favourite are salmonetes, either grilled or deep fried they're the best. In Emilio in the Mina street or in El Zopón in the park at Virgen del Mar,  they usually have great food.  I also think that a trip to Cádiz is a must. You can make one day trips taking the ship from the Harbor.   For drinks, there are several pubs near the lighthouse packed with Americans. If you want to meet locals, you can try La Calabaza Mecánica. It has a very laid back atmosphere and it's good for a beer. Or hou can go to Portobello, which is more like a disco and people dress up.   I don't know this year, but there are usually free concerts in the chiringuito Las Dunas. Chiringuito stands for beach bar,  so you have sand, cocktails and music at the same time.  It's usually pretty cool. Also, there's going to be a music festival soon nearby, just google ""alrumbo festival"" for details.   Have fun!"

spain,3cswi1,DonCipote,4,Fri Jul 10 16:13:57 2015 UTC,"The closest town that can be reached by train from Seville seems to be Lora del Rio, taking the C1 line from Santa Justa. However that's still 50 mins away from Gemasolar, so the taxi drive will be expensive. If I were in your situation I'd just rent a car in Seville. That place is pretty much in the middle of nowhere so it really can't be accessed by public transport as far as I know."
spain,3cswi1,LupineChemist,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:07:42 2015 UTC,"Also, the airport is already right on the motorway on the correct side of the city. If you are going to take a taxi, it's best direct from the airport."

spain,3cswi1,LupineChemist,3,Fri Jul 10 17:49:41 2015 UTC,"If you really want, you have to take transport into the city then probably a bus to fuentes and then a taxi.  The schedule may not be regular. Do you not have a driving license? By far the cheapest option will be to just rent a car for the day. There is no urban driving on the route at all so it's not a challenging drive.  Contact the fashion show and they may have some kind of shuttle set up."

Those are your main option, the others are beautiful specially Leon, and a great place to live, but only if you like very tiny cities or big towns. As I said if you don't mind commuting, Mostoles, it's 18km away from madrid and most of it's population do that, but if you want to live in an actual city, Zaragoza.

Zaragoza could be a nice second chance since it is well comunicated halfway between Madrid and Barcelona.  The rest, to my taste, are too small/rural.

Zaragoza is alright, but it would probably be out for me. If you want an urban environment, go to Madrid, else go for a smaller city.  For as envious as I am of the Galician weather with the heat the entire year, I don't know that I could live with it for an entire year. Basically it's more a classic N. European cloudy and rainy climate. If that's what you want, Galicia can be quite nice.   EDIT: My brain always mixes Ponferrada and Pontevedra. Seasons in León can be rather extreme with fair amounts of snow in the winter and quite hot in summer.  Professionally, if you are looking to advance, Móstoles is almost certainly the best."

If you want a smaller city go to one of the other choices. It's kind of not big enough to be a huge city but not small enough to really have the smaller city/town lifestyle.

If you are going to Benicassim with no reservations you are going to have to camp, expect everything to be full. Decathlon has good camping gear for that. You should arrive early to get a semi decent place, but expect heat, noise and an idiot with a megaphone (there is always one)  The majority of people in FIB will be English, FIB is famous for it.

You can get a small pack the size of a third of a cup for like 0.5-1 USD at the cheapest.

On one hand, it's terrible people are forced out of their homes. On the other hand, the people that own the house have to pay bills and mortgages. Something similar happened to my family. We had someone renting a house owned by my mother and decided to stop paying. She left the house the day before the Juzgado decided she was to be evicted. We lost a lot of money because of her (rent, water, electricity, lawyer).  -Botellón: Set up areas where people can drink. Banning something will make people do it even more. -Smoking weed: The state has no business dictating individuals what they can or can not put into their own bodies. They can not say ""here, these drugs are fine (alcohol, medication, nicotine), and these drugs are bad (weed)"" -Leaving furniture in the street: Where I live, the parque ecológico is open mon-fri during regular office hours. Most people clear out old junk during the weekends. Most people simply put it next to the green bins, I wonder if that also falls under this law? -Disrespecting a police officer: ""Disrespect"" is not actually defined in this law. Are we talking about hitting officers? Telling them to fuck off? Or simply telling them that they are armed enforcers for an increasingly oppressive government, and are wilfully punishing civilians for exercising their civil rights?"

I get it's an important event, but at this point, attending may disrupt your life much more than passing.   The reason for the entry requirement of 6 months validity is so that they will be able to see your entry stamp when you leave. If they see a clean passport, they will ask for your residency card. They have gotten MUCH more strict on this in the last couple years.  If it's been 3 years, you are eligible for arraigo social to get legal residency. Talk to a lawyer because that can be a bit complicated as I understand. You can also go for pareja de hecho or get married and get residency that way.

Instead, I got an apostilled criminal report from the state where I lived. This wasn't a big deal at all.  It was later, when I was applying for arraigo and residency at the comisaria in Spain that I had to get the apostilled FBI report. When it's a state document, the state does the apostille. When it's a national/federal document, the State Department in DC does the apostille. The worst part, however was getting fingerprints done in Spain that satisfied the FBI requirements. I ended up having to go to the Policía Científica in Madrid to do that part--I then sent the fingerprints to the FBI and asked the FBI to send the clearance to a friend in DC who handled the apostille for me. There are companies in DC that will also do this.  The US consulate in Spain is zero help in taking care of criminal record reports (or almost anything else, for that matter).

Regional or even individual accents might make them sound different, thought, but don't worry it's not an issue.

It's a problem every Spanish-speaking kid has to overcome: to know when to use B and when to use V when writing. Both are pronounced more or less like the English B. The English V might sound like a Spanish F, depending on your pronunciation, so stick with the B sound.  In any case, people will understand you if you differentiate them, although it's not correct. There's even a Family Guy episode when Stewie and Brian talk about the fact that Stewie pronounces the B as a V in the Spanish version.

In some places in Spain, where people (supposedly) speak a purer variety of Spanish (Salamanca, Valladolid...), they DO differentiate between the double l and y.

By the way, the Family Guy episode is this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lich59xsjik  Stewie does that in other episodes (like that hWhoopi Goldberg one).

They had a deal going where the installation was free and they gave me an installation appointment for the day after I signed up, so it was pretty convenient.   Your luck will depend entirely on what is available in the area where your apartment is, because some buildings/neighborhoods don't have the infrastructure for decent internet yet. You should be able to see what's available by searching for your address on the internet providers' websites. The companies I know of are Ono and Jazztel, though I imagine there are others as well.

spain,3bmll8,billdietrich1,11,Tue Jun 30 15:39:11 2015 UTC,"I'd say we share more than what separates us. I think socioeconomic factors are much more determinant than just geographical ones. I mean that 2 college students from Seville and Barcelona have more in common than a college student and a farm laborer from the same region.   Catalonia has been the industrialized zone of Spain with Basque Country and Madrid. It is one of the richest (maybe the richest, can't remember right now) parts of Spain.   That said there are differences and you can tell were some people are just by looking at them. If I am at Berlin for example I can tell who's Spanish and even tell the autonomous region just by looking, of course this is not 100% and has some selection bias but still. Spain's dictatorship tried to homogenize Spanish culture, but we have very different cultures and languages. Someone from canary islands is very different than someone from Extremadura that is very different from someone from Santander. We share a lot but you can definitely tell the differences.   For example and being a bit exaggerated, woman in her 40's with short hair dyed in a strange color and color glasses is Catalan 80% of the time. Young guy with a mad max hair cut, mountain boots and those trousers with a different fabric color on the knees is basque or maybe navarre or la rioja. A 20 year old with chinos, moccasins,polo and ""raya al lado"" haircut is from sevilla/madrid.  You also have to take into consideration that Catalonia is a region that took a lot of immigrants from other parts of Spain, specially Extremadura and Andalucia, you have a very mixed population. Madrid is the same and Basque country also had a lot of emigration.   At least in my experience I haven't experienced great differences in character, maybe there is a trend in nationalistic people, they are a bit assholish, but that is my experience with every nationalism, not just Catalan, think of it as vegans. I don't know if they resemble the french, it's not like the frontier is a white and black line, I'm sure they share a lot more with southern France that southern France shares with northern France.

People from Basque Country, from Galicia, from Madrid, from Andalucia, from Canary Islands, are all very different from each other. Probably there are more simmilarities between Catalans and French people than there are between people from Catalonia and Canary Islands, yes.  I'd say there is no such thing as ""Spanish culture"", it's a mixture of the number of different lifestyles from the different regions of Spain.   Is Catalonia for Spain somewhat like Slovenia was for Yugoslavia? (Where most industry was, where people had a different mindset, being more reserved, and where there were the highest standards of living)   Yeah, Catalonia, Euskadi (a.k.a.

It doesnt make much sense because when the constitution was written (late 70's) there was a lot of brinkmanship to do and also there was fears of a fascist military coup, so they couldn't fully develop spain into a full multinational country as in the UK.   Region is a politically charged term in the ""nationalities"" autonomous communities, and is usually used by people from other parts of spain to attack the identity of those coming from Catalonia and the Basque country that want independence.   I would end saying that spain is not the UK or Canada, there is a lot of animosity, especially between independence minded catalans and nationalist spaniards.

Three times I bought and registered a car in Germany (getting license plates etc.), and bought German car insurance and a U.S. license was all I needed.   Edit: I speak German and Spanish, so I was always able to help them muddle through my address.  U.S. addresses can be challenging because the order in which street and house number are written are reversed, house numbers almost never have more than three digits in Europe, and streets names seldom use numbers or letters.  So an address like ""13485 14 Mile Road"" or ""12000 U.S. 51 W"" confuses people."

spain,3bfodc,TheRealVanWilder,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:27:04 2015 UTC,I've been living in Madrid for only a year (Lived in Andalusia before) and the traffic and highways are horrible.  Whoever thought putting an almost 90 degree exit on the LEFT lane of a highway was a good idea should burn in hell.
spain,3bfodc,thatmeanitguy,2,Mon Jun 29 19:35:58 2015 UTC,A lot of times it's about where there is space to build the infrastructure. I know one example of this is leaving the M40 to the A4 going to the city coming from Leganés/Islazul. If you look around there there is already so much built that putting in a flyover would just be insane and not worth the extra money at all.

spain,3bfodc,redekker,3,Mon Jun 29 19:52:51 2015 UTC,"What part of Spain? If you're going to the big cities, ditch the car and use public transport. Madrid and Barcelona have great subway systems (although they are becoming more and more expensive to use each day... when I left for the US, you could ride throught 80% of Madrid's subway network for 1.2€... I think it is now fared by number of stops."
spain,3bfodc,JayFv,5,Sun Jun 28 20:33:36 2015 UTC,"I'm a Brit and live in Spain so I know driving here well.  Even with its faults I do love this country the people wherever I've been are friendly.  Where are you going to visit?  I've never driven in the US so I can't compare but I can give you some advice.  I'm going to generalise but of course there are good drivers over here.  About 15 years ago the EU started funding roundabouts so they built thousands of them, but nobody knows how to use them.  Using the righthand lane to go all the way around the outside is perfectly acceptable.  If you are changing the other person has priority.  The safest way to use them, when you're not used to driving here, is to try not to find yourself next to someone, let them go first, indicate to exit and CHECK YOUR BLIND SPOTS.  If you only drive automatic and are renting then be sure to ask specifically for one.  Most people in Europe drive manual.  They don't always use indicators (turn signals I think you call them?), be aware of this. Speed cameras can be hidden behind bushes and often aren't well signposted. City's are not built in grids and some roads in city and town centres are the width of a horse and cart so be prepared to get lost, with or without GPS. I hear that on your freeways it's normal to overtake on either side.  Here, you can only pass on the left and people don't check their blind spots so do not pass on the right, ever, even though they're driving in the wrong lane. The drink drive limit is very low and police checkpoints are common. Scooter riders are crazy. People drive too close at high speed so keep your distance."
spain,3bfodc,spambot419,6,Sun Jun 28 20:59:24 2015 UTC,"About 15 years ago the EU started funding roundabouts so they built thousands of them, but nobody knows how to use them.   This explains a lot. All rules of the road seem to dissolve into thin air when Spaniards get to roundabouts. Just today I was with two Spanish friends. They started to have a heated discussion about how you're supposed to use roundabouts. I sat and listened to them for a while, and then it dawned on me; I had never had an argument with somebody in Ireland about this, because we don't have opinions on the matter...we know the fucking rules."
spain,3bfodc,JayFv,5,Sun Jun 28 22:25:35 2015 UTC,"https://goo.gl/maps/IIAXQ https://goo.gl/maps/AwUZ4  -  EU funded roundabouts.  I very briefly considered passing my test in Spain so I got a theory textbook (in fairness, it was from before the roundabout boom).  In the whole book there was only three paragraphs at the bottom of one page on roundabouts.  It amounted to ""If you're turning right use the right hand lane.  Otherwise, choose whichever lane best suits your destination.""    In the UK theory books there will be a whole chapter with diagrams of various different types of roundabouts and how to use them safely and to best optimize traffic flow, which was why the things were invested in the first place.   To confuse things even, more until about 20 years ago the person joining the roundabout had right of way."
spain,3bfodc,SDGrave,3,Sun Jun 28 22:45:17 2015 UTC,"The way I was taught in driving school was: If you have to go right, take the outside lane and signal right. If you have to go straight, take either outside lane. Signal before taking the exit. If you have to go left, take the inside lane and signal left. Then signal right before using the exit. If you have to turn around, inside lane, signal right all the way, then signal left befor taking the exit."

spain,3bfodc,JayFv,3,Mon Jun 29 17:55:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this, it's interesting.  Nothing like this existed in the Spanish equivalent from 2000 of the UK's Highway Code, when roundabouts became common and before which 60+% of people on Spanish roads learned to drive, at a guestimation.  It looks largely about right, but there are two points missing.    It doesn't say that going all the way around the outside is wrong.  In fact it implies that you can.  Coche B ha optado por utilizar uno de los carriles interiores para circular...  Car B has chosen to use one of the inside lanes.  If the outside lane was only used for the next exit then car C would be fine to exit from the middle lane.  In this graphic there are no circumstances in which it is OK to exit to the righthand lane of the road.    Slightly off the point, but I can't think of any three lane roundabouts that don't also have a traffic light system of some kind.  Off topic, but don't you love how they always choose to put nice 1.5m bins at junctions so you can see where you're going and if they don't need bins there then they'll put a nice big shrub to give you a pretty view of cars that are coming.  While you're trying to see around these objects on your left you're not concentrating on the pedestrian crossing on your right that's 1m from the junction so people don't have to walk 10m up the road to cross."
spain,3bfodc,spambot419,2,Mon Jun 29 19:42:40 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much it. If you're taking the next exit, you should be in the right hand lane signaling right, if not you should be in the inside lane signaling left. If everybody does this then there will never be anybody on your right just after an exit, so you'll be free to indicate and move across to the outside lane to exit at the next. Roundabouts work beautifully when everybody uses them correctly.  I live in a town that has no traffic lights, just roundabouts, speed bumps and zebra crossings. It's also quite middle class so the average car is a 4x4 driven by a self-centered shitcunt. The fucking shenanigans that go on in this town on roundabouts beggars belief. Any day of the week, any time of day, just walking past a roundabout you'll see somebody enter the roundabout on the outside lane, continue there past two exits, cutting somebody off, then moving to the inside lane, again cutting somebody off, and then finally exiting from the inside lane. All without indicators, absolutely amazing."

spain,3bfodc,JayFv,2,Tue Jun 30 18:07:28 2015 UTC,"Well my experience with Spanish drivers is mixed, as a Norwegian the driving ethos is totally different from what I used to in Norway, that been said, here is what I learned.  For the most, Spanish drivers show an astonishing level of patience on some situations and none on others. Where you can practically park wherever you want, but god forbid if you forget your emergency lights. I saw a dispute between two drivers, where the car in front just stopped in the road, pulled a little bit to the right and the car behind him went bananas because, wait for it, he didn’t signal with the emergency lights. And double parking is something everyone does apparently and nobody gets annoyed by it, unless you forget your emergency lights that is. Parking your car in handicaps parking lots seems to be  ok, if it is just for a minute or two.  And when it comes to the roundabouts, well is nightmarish as they don’t know how to use it properly.  Most roundabouts have two lanes, if you should dare to drive into the outmost lane while a car is driving in the innermost lane, the amount obscene words and hand signals you will get from the driver will make the devil turn white. And don’t expect them to signal with the blinking lights what their intentions are in the roundabout, it is a guest work at best that takes time to get used to.  But when it comes to all, I must say is pretty ok when you get used to it, most drivers keep their distance while driving in the highways, although from time to time you will meet a crazy fuck driver, tail gating or speeding by you."
spain,3bfodc,mentelucida,2,Mon Jun 29 13:46:55 2015 UTC,"Good insights but, in fairness to the car on the inside lane, it's best not to be next to anybody at all on a roundabout.

This has kept me out of trouble so far."

Not so much for specialists, although of course some professions are doing better than others.   wages   Average salary in Spain is around 26000€/year. For a beginner mechanical engineer it might be 16000€-18000€/year, maybe less, but you could earn double that or more over the years as you gain experience.   price of housing (rent)   Depends on the place. In a small town it can be as low as 200€/month or even less. In Madrid anything less than 400€/month will probably be either very small, very far, very old, or all at the same time.   living expenses   Highly depends on your lifestyle. Groceries are at least 200€/person. Utilities maybe 30€ to 50€/month. Gas is around 1.3€/Litre. A packet of cigarettes cost about 4€. Cinema tickets are around 7€/person (although there are lots of discounts and offers). A good but not too fancy dinner can cost you 20€/person. A greasy, unhealthy and utterly delicious kebap is just 3€. Public transportation is around 1€ to 2€ per ride, or you can buy monthly passes for 20€ to 30€. You get the idea.   what's the best place to live   Really depends on your taste. There's a bit of everything here. But if you want to find a job more or less quickly you will probably want to live in one of the three biggest cities (Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia) or maybe the north of the country (where the heavy industry used to be; the crisis killed many factories, but salaries are so low now that they are bringing them back).   I know the unemployment rate is high right now and assume it's hard to find a job, even more for a foreign national, but is it impossible?

There are some significant differences between those countries:   Salary for a normal IT position in Spain is shit compared to Germany and UK Working hours in a lot of companies are only theoretically (or not at all) restricted to 40 hours, but a lot of times will you will find yourself doing unpaid overtime by default As other people have commented in this thread - IT is often seen as an expense, not as an investment. Strategic planning that would make your life as an IT person more enjoyable is rather rare, which can be frustrating. Spain is very centralistic. For a decent amount of jobs to choose from, there is Madrid, Barcelona, but not much else. Sure there are some jobs in Andalucia, but a lot of them are shit. Malaga and similar places are often chosen by IT companies due to the low salaries that they can get away with in the South of Spain   What works for me:  Don't get hired, do freelancing. If you have foreign clients, or IT agencies you can work for in other countries telematically , that should get you started. This way you can mix the low living costs and good weather in Spain with decent IT work and ""normal"" salaries."

We call big consultancy firms ""cárnicas"" or meathouses (slaughterhouses, butcherhouses, the like) because (most) spanish companies treat their staff like meat, not like persons. They simply use people up until they're tired and quit, and don't give two fucks about them. There is always someone else willing to do your job, what with 25% unemployment and all that.

The market has changed and there are more opportunities now, especially if you know a second or third language as English.   The only big inconvenience I see besides the low salary is the, what they call, jornadas partidas,  which is like a one to two hours lunch break midt day, which in effect extends your working day for one or two hours more.

Right now is above 40 degrees Celsius in Madrid.   Spain is awesome in many ways,  I didn't expect staying for so long and it seems I am for a long time. It takes awhile to get use to but you get use to it after a while.   When it comes to job opportunities, you have better chances now than four or three years ago.  Having a English speaker in a company seems to be in so you will probably have more jobs to choose from. If you are lucky you will get a job offer where the company will nurture you rather than squeeze you out,  as most employers do here. So be aware of that and stay clear from those companies that only look for themselves. My impression is if the company only offers double shifts jobs,  as most do,  they will probably be a typical old fashion company that doesn't take in to account the employees well being.  And yes, the two or one hour break extending your work day from 8 hours to 10 hours work day is unpaid."

I believe its 180cm all around (adding length,width,height). Usually taking the front wheel off and twist the handle bar does the deal.   Check Renfe's website for luggage measurements. Once at the station you have to go beforehand to the supervisor so he knows because they will travel inside the package wagon and not with you.   Its doable, i know because i work in quality control for AVE. But you have to have everything well taken care off beforehand, dont show up with the bike to try taking it apart in that moment.

spain,3bae34,TotesMessenger,1 point,Sat Jun 27 10:31:57 2015 UTC,"You can take your bike on the AVE to Barcelona. It's one of the AVEs with the most space for luggage. Here's a page in Spanish that explains the rules:  http://www.renfe.com/viajeros/info/bicicletas.html  Basically you have to buy a bag (funda) that's 120 x 90 x 40 cm  or less and fit your bike in it (removing the wheel and pedals and maybe more depending on your bike size). You need to get there very early and be one of the first people on the platform and get to your car to scope out a space for your bike where the luggage racks are. As I remember, the big racks are at the far end of the car as you walk down the platform. If you get there later, they might not let you on if there's no space for your bike. The ""package wagon"" that Kinkozes mentioned is supposed to exist, but I don't know anyone who has had any success accessing it. The ""interventores"" seem to always direct folks to put their stuff in the luggage racks of their train car. You might be able to get away with a slightly longer bag, but the 90cms wide is already pushing it, so be careful not to go any bigger or it will stick out in the aisle too much.  The bus company ALSA also sells a cheap bag that allows you to transport a bike by bus."
spain,3bae34,ultimomono,0,Sat Jun 27 12:51:54 2015 UTC,"I haven't looked into it, and I have quite a few brothers working for RENFE. I can ask them if you want but from what I know, your best bet would be picking cercanias (local trains) which can go quite far from madrid and then take another regional train until the barcelona area.  In cercanias you can bring the bike with you, I'm 100% sure of this. It's going to take longer, and you will probably have to switch trains trice, but at least you will have your bike with you."

spain,3asafu,shabablife,8,Tue Jun 23 02:42:24 2015 UTC,"If you have public insurance, it won't cost you anything, but it will certainly take time to get the procedure done. Starting with the first visit, I wouldn't be surprised if it were 6 months to a year as the public system likes to avoid surgery if possible. It seems knees are the biggest weakness of  public system wait times in general because they just aren't as high priority as other procedures.  If you have private insurance, it may not even be covered since it's a pre-existing condition. But if it is you will have to look it up for your specific coverage in your documentation.  If you are from the US, you might even look into the option of just paying cash. I have no idea, but my gut feeling would be on the order of 3,000 - 5,000€ for the surgery and any recovery. If you have local insurance at home see if they will negotiate to pay a part of it as it will be way cheaper for them (may or may not have results, but worth a shot)."
spain,3asafu,LupineChemist,3,Tue Jun 23 06:57:28 2015 UTC,"In the hospital I work, I think it would be expected to be around  10,000€ give or take around 1500€.

spain,3amaw1,fanfare_mp3,9,Sun Jun 21 16:57:59 2015 UTC,"If you order just a ""tinto"" or the ""house wine"" you will probably have a young wine (cosecha) with no aging in casks. A ""crianza"" has a minimum of two years aging, one of them in oak casks and another in bottle. It's the minimum regulated but you can find some other wines with 3 or 6 months in casks (semicrianza).  By ordering ""crianza"" you can have a wine with a certain quality at a very affordable price, since most of them are below $12 or $15, and lots not even $8."
spain,3amaw1,alvarop,5,Sun Jun 21 19:52:07 2015 UTC,"Here in the US, where nobody knows a lick about Spanish wine, I find that I get a lot more mileage if I'm careful to buy bottle with a familiar DO, and choose crianzas where available.  Even in the export market, the difference in price is usually pretty moderate.  Also, although Rioja is generally considered the ""best,"" if you ever find a ribera de duero in the US it is usually outstanding, since apparently Rioja has the best export reputation and can easily peddle anything with the DO, whereas riberas usually only export more solid representatives."

spain,3amaw1,chemmkl,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:56:57 2015 UTC,"I think it's good advice.  Most people that drink wine will order directly a ""rioja"" or a ""ribera"" at any Spanish bar. The former is guaranteed to be available at every single bar. That should be a 15-20cl glass and will cost around 2.5€. For ~1€ more you can add the word ""crianza"" to your order and you will get a better wine."
spain,3amaw1,chemmkl,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:48:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks! So, I would order a ""Rioja crianza""?  About how much more expensive is a ""ribera"" (compared to ""Rioja"")?"
spain,3amaw1,vardecos,2,Mon Jun 22 04:24:10 2015 UTC,"Similar price, just not as widely available at tapas' bars. However both will be available at every restaurant. And yes, ""rioja crianza"" is my usual wine order at bars.  What is incredibly cheap is buying wine at supermarkets. I like ""El Coto"" crianza (~6€ 75cl) from Rioja and you should try ""Protos"" from ribera (crianza ~15€ or reserva ~30€, based on your budget) if you can.  Having said that, there are many reasonably good wines for less than 2 or 3 euros for the entire bottle, even Rioja."

spain,3ai1ya,Karlog24,7,Sat Jun 20 16:06:38 2015 UTC,"They aren't pro Monarchy, they are pro Constitution.   Semantics.   Spain is a parliamentary monarchy as defined by the very first article of that constitution, if they're pro-constitution in its current state they're pro-monarchy.   Spaniards did get their choice many years ago and opted to rid from them.   Are you going all the way back to the disastrous Second Republic now? Don't make me laugh...  The last time we got asked we gave PP (and therefore, monarchy) an absolute majority, this is how representative democracy works.   The main reason Juan Carlos abdicated was due to their unpopularity.   Indeed, but I don't see how that changes what I pointed out.  81% approves of Felipe, right now.   There are othe issues at hand when fvoters choose aside from keeping the Monarchy.   Or maybe people is just aware that we're not exactly swimming in money and they're not interested in moving to a more expensive presidential system, not to mention the cost of the transition itself.  Political ideals are nice and all, but as our beloved guiris say: Money talks, bullshit walks.   Anti-monarchy parties are listed as radical, this can cause hesitation.   That's because they are, all the currently well known pro-republic parties are situated to the far left of the classic Spanish centre."

spain,3ai1ya,LupineChemist,5,Sun Jun 21 07:36:55 2015 UTC,"But why it can't be like Germany?   In the pragmatic sense it already is:  Prime minister: Rajoy / Merkel  Head of State: Felipe VI / Joachim Gauck  The only big difference being that our ""federal president"" (which would be elected by the Senado in this case) is a ""king"" instead, but their role and powers are pretty much the same.  Quoting Wikipedia:  Under Article 59 (1) of the Basic Law (German Constitution), the Federal President represents the Federal Republic of Germany in matters of international law, concludes treaties with foreign states on its behalf and accredits diplomats.[4] Furthermore, all federal laws must be signed by the President before they can come into effect; however, he can only veto a law that he believes to violate the constitution.  The Federal President, by his actions and public appearances, represents the state itself, its existence, its legitimacy, and unity.   Isn't Merkel handling this representative thing?   No, she does some of the stuff like Rajoy but the bulk of it is done by Foreign Office and the German President just like Ministerio de Exteriores and Casa Real here.   And she is also not a useless money eater?   Do you think that the German president and his team work for free?   In 2015 the entire family (Felipe, Leticia, Juancar and Sofía) got paid only 655 764€, which is penauts in the grand scheme of things as most high profile politicians and representatives could be earning a lot more in the private sector, not only in Spain but everywhere.   Or like U.S?   Do you want Rajoy to be head of state in addition to prime minister? I certainly don't."

It depends on the place, but if Madrid and Barcelona are your main destinations then you will find plenty of hostels there. If you want something dirt cheap or free you could try CouchSurfing or some other kind of hospitality exchange. In any case make sure to book you room/couch/whatever in advance because July is high tourist season. Since the crisis started there have been a lot of people working off-the-books, so it's not impossible, but without a good grasp of the language it really will not be easy. Since you are interested in clubs maybe you could get a menial job like picking up glasses or, if you have the right looks or personality, maybe you could be a ""Public Relations"" person, which means handling flyers and buying shots to promote the club. You should ask in /r/madrid and /r/barcelona. Check their wikis first. No offence but I'm a bit too old for you, and I don't live near Madrid or Barcelona anyway. Glad to help answering questions if I can, though."

It's 26€ to get to Barcelona by bus. It's 11€ per night in Barcelona. If you spend 4 nights in each this is already 111€ without food. You won't be able to travel to France or Portugal, stay the rest of the month and eat on this."

If you are not proficient in Spanish it will be hard to get a job for such a little span of time. Maybe some RRPP job off the books as someone said earlier.  As for hotspots, the whole city seems as one, and plenty of clubs around the Vila Olímpica, or Marina will probably be packed with foreigners too.

These places tend to be extremely low key as they're still on the fringe of legality, so use your head and be careful."

My physical therapist happens to be a member and he said that he would have to recommend me and that they would interview me before allowing me to join. So I doubt you'll just be able to walk through the front door.  The issue is that  use and purchase of hash/marijuana is still a grey area in Spain, so there is apparently some risk involved and the people who run such establishments are wary of who they let join. It's also somewhat of a risk for members, especially if you want to buy to smoke at home, rather than in the club."

As big cities everything here goes quicker and you must plan things. As I usually tell my friends if they come to Madrid, the problem here is that whatever you decide to do another 10,000 idiots have made the same choice.   I think your plan goes much better in something like, sevilla-cordoba- granada or bilbao-san sebastian-santander-oviedo or toledo-salamanca-segovia. But this all depends on your preferences. These are much smaller cities much more relaxed, with ""less"" things to see and an incredible food selection all thought more local.

For shopping it's nice, but it's such a bustling metropolitan area it doesn't make a great vacation.   Barcelona and Toledo are both gorgeous cities.   Toledo has history and sites and little shops on side streets that are fun to go into and restaurants that you're less likely to find in an urban area. While in Toledo, I also got a gorgeous handmade sword. I don't recommend a sword because customs was an absolute pain, but there's also jewelry and smaller blades that are easier to transport. The views in and of Toledo are breathtaking and great photo spots.   Barcelona gives the best of both worlds  with metro shopping areas in the same city as amazing sites to see such as the Sagrada Familia (pictures don't do the inside of it justice! Definitely go on a sunny day) and the Parque Güell. The architecture throughout the city is also just amazing.   I don't entirely hate Madrid. The museums there are amazing, but I would only make Madrid a day trip. The museums don't take too long to tour and there's only so much time you can spend in Parque Retiro.   Honestly, if you're going to be in Spain for a while, don't limit yourself to a couple cities. Get around for some day trips! The aqueducts in Segovia, the university in Salamanca, and the bull fighting museum in Seville were some of my absolute favorite spots outside of Barcelona and Toledo.

spain,3a55wx,FergiesWhiskyNose,6,Wed Jun 17 16:48:02 2015 UTC,Well you don't know whether a significant amount will move to Spain or elsewhere in the EU. If they happen to do son then that will be their rights as Spanish citizens.
spain,3a55wx,La_Vibora,-10,Wed Jun 17 17:09:25 2015 UTC,You will be stuck with them when the EU collapses. Lashing citizenship out to people when you have such high youth unemployment and high emigration is utterly absurd. No wonder Spain is fucked with your politicians making ridiculous laws such as this.

It seems like the Spanish government disagrees with you. I'll make sure and let them know of your disapproval. They're doing this in the hopes that Jews will bring in money to the economy, not for humanitarian reasons.   Anyway, it's none of your concern. You're not European but some American mestizo.   First off I don't think you know what mestizo means, and the fact that you try to use it as an insult is hilarious. Secondly I'm a Spanish citizen which correct me if I'm wrong is a member of the EU, meaning I could pack my bags after I graduate and move to your country.   Edit: Oh you edited your racist bullshit, to try and hide your colours. What a brave lad you are."

The Spanish government are running at a huge deficit, high unemployment and are running the country into the ground. There are tens of thousands of recent grads in London alone working as baristas, waiters and cleaners. They cannot even look after their own people. Nevermind non Europeans such as yourself. If they want to lash out citizenship to non Europeans, that is fine. But when the EU falls, they will be stuck with them. Rich Jews can get visas easily in Europe. They won't want to give up their original citizenship. Poor ones will."

They've been saying that for a while, and while racist ducks like you might despise immigrants I don't think they make up the majority of Britain's population judging by how poorly UKIP faired in the election.    We won't be in the EU for much longer and people here despise immigrants, but you're welcome to try.   They cannot even look after their own people. Nevermind non Europeans such as yourself.   Well I don't think you know what non European means either, but I wouldn't move anywhere without a job offer first.

Dont talk shit about things you have no clue of, mestizo. We will have a referendum on remaining in the EU by the end of 2017. Immigration will be what clinches it. People here are sick of it. As are most Europeans.  Not wanting to be unundated with non Europeans because another EU member state is lashing out citizenship like confetti is not racist.

I pay the same damn taxes and get to vote for the same crap politicians they do here in Spain. And if you think race has any correlation to the quality of a person, you have shit for brains. Culture is a whole different bag of worms, but I can count on one hand the number of countries in the world that haven't been fucked over by the British.

'European American'. No such thing. Your ancestors were trash that were forced to fled. 'Italian royality' - give me strength. Of course the obligatory American claim to be of native blood is thrown into the mix. You were busy genociding them. Not riding them.  If America is superior then fuck off home. You seppos destroyed the natives of that land. You wont get away with trying to do the same here. Non Europeans have no business being in any White European nation and as nationalism spreads through the continent like wildfire, this pertinent fact will be made abundantly clear to them."

My family designed and flew planes with Howard Hughes and were decorated heroic Marines who fought both Germans and Japanese in WWII, Americans who made the world proud of America, even if America still considered them immigrants. But none of that negates nor overshadows that I am a citizen of both places by right, by blood, by the sweat of my brow and the the taxes I pay. You seem to see yourself as superior and entitled due to that superiority, but all I see is fear of losing the privilege of that was given to you and which deep down you know that you have squandered."
spain,3a55wx,gnark,-5,Wed Jun 17 23:12:39 2015 UTC,"They could apply for a visa like everyone else before this. Now that Spain is giving them citizenship they can bypass our stringent immigration laws. Very few people want an EU passport so they can move to Spain. They want it to move to the UK, the Netherlands, Sweden and Germany.  The EU15 countries with the highest unemployment rates also have the most lax citizenship policies(PIIGS). It's absurd."

Up front its ""compensation"" for the jewish expulsion from spain in the 15th century but in reality   Jews have money and were in a bad economic moment, maybe this will bring economic growth and investment One of the reasons jews think they need israel is becuase all the european countries expelled them and where they werent they are still persecuted and ofended, if we take them back and provide a save envirenment for them, we are helping solve the middle east conflic by showing them that israel isnt necesary.    What will actually happen   The Spharadic jews that come will actually be the poorest of the poor, their expulsion from arab countris after the creation of israel  left them with nothing and their lower social position will make them more of a burden then a benefit for Spain.

spain,3a5qqi,Dr_Gage,8,Fri Jun 19 07:28:14 2015 UTC,"From Madrid, I think it's a sentimental issue more than a political one at this point. I think they can and should decide by themselves, but the conditions of secession must be negotiated. Things like national debt have to be negotiated and they should be responsible for a portion. We also have to negotiate if this is a one in a generation referendum, one each 4 years... The assumption that the rest of Spain has no say in the matter and should unconditionally accept whatever Cataluña decides is just surreal to me. For example Artur Mas said the future nation of cataluña would have no army and they'd hire Spain's for their protection, that should be negotiated (all thought I find it ridiculous)  Also I abhor nationalism, I find it idiotic, and very 19th century. I'd much rather have pan-European movements than nationalistic ones. And I'd rather have a strong central European government than 50 mini senates discussing. Catalan politics, as mostly the other nationalistic movements in Spain, have a one line script ""Madrid oppresses us"". This has been magnified because politicians in Spain suck.   Another part of it is that all nationalism have a racist undertone that I hate. You start with cultural purity and things can go sour quick. It's imposing an artificial goal to all the population, not allowing for people to do what they want in the name of the greater good, in this case Cataluña. When half your politics are about preserving your national identity (which you deem superior and worth preserving over other cultural expressions) you end up using a ton of resources to chase a dream that is imposed on others.   I'd rather much have the Madrid style, if you live here 6 months you are a madrileño, no questions asked.  And from personal experience nationalists are but hurt assholes, I studied in pamplona 5 years and it was a common occurrence with Catalan and basque nationalists to stop talking to me or make a face when told I'm madrileño.   In conclusion, nationalisms are in my opinion idiotic, but the right to decide your own future is above my opinion. They should have the right to do a referendum and we should accept the result. But some things have to be negotiated.  EDIT: I forgot to add that It's also worth discussing if cataluña is going to grant the same right to it's own nationalisms that want to go on their way. Are they going to give the Val D'Aran the same referendum. And another question is at what administrative level are we giving the right to decide, does gerona or lerida have the right to stay with Spain if they choose? or is cataluña indivisible?"

Right now Catalonia is not independent. They still share tax recollection and expenditure with the rest of Spain. Also the competences granted by the central government can be taken away. And the central government has representatives there (delegaciones de gobierno).   Do you mean the level they will get if the referendum turns out to be a yes or the level they have now?

And you think that Catalans don't find it surreal that some Extremaduran decide their freedom?  Your concerns are valid, they will obviously be negotiated, Catalunya can't just pack and leave, they are legally bound to Spain with everything that is implied (debt for example).  I also find nationalism to perhaps be too much, but the choice is either be Spain's subject or be independent, your pan-European movements is nothing more than a pipe-dream, so why invest in it? You have to choose between two realistic scenarios, not some sci-fi one.  Regarding your question of Val d'Aran, yes they will.  The referendum is on a national level, so cities can't decide to stay in Spain, just like people can't decide that they are in Spain just because they'd vote ""NO"", since Girona has no special status like Val d'Aran, they have no legal authority to secede from Catalunya."

I'd rather we promote simple things like erasmus programs, that in my opinion unite Europe more than anything.    And you think that Catalans don't find it surreal that some Extremaduran decide their freedom?   As they should, that is why I say the decision is theirs, but they have to take into account the rest of Spain for the negotiations. You can't just leave and take what you wish. We have to get to agreements on a bunch of topics. What I find surreal is that a lot of people think Catalonia can just pack and leave with the rest of Spain having no say in how.   they have no legal authority to secede from Catalunya.   As has Catalonia to do a referendum, or secede from Spain. I do think we should change that, but right now it's ilegal. If the indivisibility of Spain can be revoked why not Catalonia's?"

Actually, they don't, that's how referendums work in regards to secession.   As has Catalonia to do a referendum, or secede from Spain.   Wrong. Self determination is applied to a people or a country, not to individuals or a city, since Val d'Aran is a distinct entity that is actually recognized by Catalunya, they would be able to have their own referendum, Girona as a city is not recognized as being part of a different cultural group nor is it a country or anything of the sort.   If the indivisibility of Spain can be revoked why not Catalonia's?   Spain's constitution does not apply here, because it undermines the principle of self determination, if Spain wants to live by rules it itself creates, then it should get the fuck off every international body and be isolated from those pesky rights people are so desperate for.  I already said this, it applies to a people or a nation, you can't decide that you wish to join France and hold your referendum in your living room, there are requirements that need to be met.  If you can't understand that concept then there's little point in explaining it further.  For the 3275843345th time, Catalan politicians already said that Val d'Aran could leave if they wanted to. So it does apply to Catalunya."
spain,3a5qqi,Dr_Gage,3,Thu Jun 18 10:43:05 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't make it happen. I think it's just going to happen little by little by natural means. I'd love for the EU to set policies that help and programs that allow for as much mobility inside the union as possible. But even if they don't we've started something that is going to end in a united Europe. The more I travel and the more Europeans my age I meet the more I'm convinced we share a lot more than divides us.   As people travel, study abroad, work, go to seminars... we met, we know each other, we share, we fall in love, we end up having kids... this ""mixing"" little by little is going to produce a less dependent on national identity europe. As traveling and spending time here and there we get to know places and people, make them ours not by force but by joy/love and that is just wonderful. I'm absolutely convinced that if we maintain the conditions of today it may take 50 years but we will end having a generation whose identity is closer to Europe than of it's countries.   We can say it's similar to what happen in Catalonia with Andalusians, nobody forced them to be Catalan after years, life just happened and their national identities morphed by no imposition, just by living. Take for example Muchachito bombo infierno, he says he's cataluz. That's what I think is going to happen to Europe on a larger scale, we are going to loose our national identities little by little into a huge melting pot of awesomeness.    Actually, they don't, that's how referendums work in regards to secession.   I've never said that the rest of Spain has a saying in the yes or no. What I say is we have a saying in the how, once Catalonia decides if it wants to stay or go. We must negotiate the nooks and crannies of the secession. Again things like what happens to shared administrations, polices, programs,... can't be decided unilaterally.    Wrong. Self determination is applied to a people or a country, not to individuals or a city, since Val d'Aran is a distinct entity that is actually recognized by Catalunya, they would be able to have their own referendum, Girona as a city is not recognized as being part of a different cultural group nor is it a country or anything of the sort.   As of today both the referendum and the independence are illegal under Spanish law, which is also Catalonian law. In my opinion you don't need to be a different cultural group to want independence, I'd be happy to give Salamanca the same right.. I do think we should change the law as I also think that going against it is just going to force both judges and police to enforce it. In this aspect I'm very critical of the different governments (if only it was just in this aspect) and how they have ignored this issue for too long."

I've never said that the rest of Spain has a saying in the yes or no.   Then I misunderstood you, sorry about that. And I completely agree, I said that all of these matters will be negotiated, Catalunya has to abide the law and they can't just run away from it.   As of today both the referendum and the independence are illegal under Spanish law   The Spanish Law is not above international law. According to Spanish Law, it was forbidden to speak Catalan, laws that prohibit a fundamental right are null and void.  Your opinion is just that, an opinion, while it may serve as a hypothetical argument, it's not supported by current international policies, a city can't magically decide to hold a referendum because they feel like it, there needs to be a strong case to support the need of such a referendum, Girona doesn't have that."
spain,3a5qqi,Dr_Gage,3,Thu Jun 18 11:56:52 2015 UTC,"Happy to see we understand each other. But a few things I'm not 100% with you.    The Spanish Law is not above international law. According to Spanish Law, it was forbidden to speak Catalan, laws that prohibit a fundamental right are null and void. Your opinion is just that, an opinion, while it may serve as a hypothetical argument, it's not supported by current international policies   I'm no expert in law (think Charlie from it's always sunny in Philadelphia), but even international law is debatable, some argue that it does not apply in this case or that it doesn't say Catalonia can proclaim independence. Example. Specially this paragraph:  ""Estas son las dos caras de la moneda: el Derecho internacional no ha creado un ""derecho a la secesión"" que corresponda a los pueblos culturales -étnicos, raciales, culturales, lingüísticos o religiosos-; pero también cabe afirmar que el Derecho internacional no ha prohibido que los pueblos culturales aspiren a crear un nuevo Estado mediante su secesión de un Estado matriz. Si una parte del territorio de un Estado se separa, tanto si es de forma pactada como violenta y por la causa política que sea, el Derecho internacional sólo establece que, si al final de ese proceso el territorio segregado ostenta de hecho los elementos de la estatalidad, esto es, es un territorio definido, con una población estable, y un gobierno que logra ejercer de forma sostenida en el tiempo las funciones públicas básicas de modo soberano e independiente, se le debe tratar como a cualquier otro Estado del orbe. Aplica lo que se denomina el “principio de efectividad”. Sin embargo, no hay que perder de vista que, en general, la Comunidad Internacional mira estos fenómenos con recelo. La misma Resolución 1514 (XV), por ejemplo, señala de modo categórico que ""todo intento encaminado a quebrantar total o parcialmente la unidad nacional y la integridad territorial de un país es incompatible con los propósitos y principios de la Carta de las Naciones Unidas"", en alusión a procesos de escisión fuera del marco de la descolonización.

Spain is going to loose and Cataluña is going to loose. As I said I find it to be a sentimental issue that is going to bring about no benefit in political or economical terms.  But again you're in your rights to decide your future and you should by no means forced to stay in Spain. But we have to negotiate things like if a 51% 49% yes to no is good enough, if people can move freely to each new country, if there is any colaboration between states, what happens to the people that are enrolled in nation wide formation programs (like the MIR or selectividad)... it's going to be a huge mess just for the sake of feelings."

Every nook and cranny of the separation process (why, when, how, with who, etc) has been publicly analysed, debated etc, and now towards this 27 september elections the option will be openly independence yes or no, and the yes has a great possibility of winning. It amazes me how simplistic the analysis of the average spaniard is, how little they understand what is happening and why.   Seriously, do you think literally milions of people demonstrate every year for four years just because ""they are being manipulated""?? What about the 9N ""trial"" referendum?? Two milion and a half people participated in an act openly deemed as illegal by the spanish government and faced arrest (the spanish govenrment did shown a rare moderation and common sense and didnt send the police). Several of the highest figures of the catalan government have charges of treason being investigated, etc... The economy world, the business owners, the associations, the social sectors all are also part of the independence process. Right now, though, its too late to negotiate the ""how"". There will be a vote 27S, and unless the spanish government advances its own elections or suspend the catalan autonomy, there is nothing to do to stop it.... I really reccomend you to watch the interview iñaki gavilondo did to the catalan president two days ago, its in youtube and may make things really clear for most spaniards interested in such things."

What did you thought i was talking about? The police shooting people or something? Dont be ridiculous.  And cmon, while catalonia is not scotland, more so spain is not the uk, you know im in hostile territory here in r/spain talking positively of catalan independence, there is no need to try to shame me or anything like that, im not trying to convince you of anything, just explaining you the vision of a part of catalan society, not everyone off course. But denyial will not make this go away. The election of 27S will be decisive for both catalonia and spain, of that can be no doubt. If the results of the municipal elections are mirrored in the autonomic elections, independentist parties will again obtain absolute majority, while the openly unionist ones will have horrible results (psc/psoe, pp, ciutadans).   Remember that podemos with ada colau (who is openly independentist and not herself part of podemos) got 175k votes, and nobody in catalonia believes they will agree to a ""front"" with ciutadans, pp, psc, etc. and if they do it will be the end of the party for them. There are many factions between full indepdnence and full union (federalists, clnfederalists, etc)"

I didn't start a dialog, but you don't care about anything but your own voice, so... About the Ñ melodrama, I'm just going to ask him directly, let's see what happens. I do am going to answer something, tho. About the legality of the referendum: It's illegal, period, the judges had no option than to apply the constitution. Same with the ""sedition, treason et al"" from the article you just posted and clearly didn't read        desde la asociación de jueces afirman que si en el intento de llevar a cabo la consulta ""se organiza una algarada o el propio Gobierno de Cataluña intenta utilizar a los Mossos de Esquadra para proteger la realización del referéndum podríamos estar incluso ante un delito de sedición"".         IF such and such conditions were met, then it's a crime as determined by our current laws, laws that neither lawyers nor judges can change and have to apply no matter what their personal opinion is. That's one of the basic principle of democracy, btw, the separation of powers. You don't like the [crappy] constitution or the laws? Neither do I, but the power to change them is in our hands, so stop whining about what the judges decided, they don't have much choice in the matter. And btw, the thing about circlejerks is that there's always space for one more, they're not limited by numbers. CiU has no intention to actually work for the independence, it's just something they pull from time to time to gain some advantage in the negotiation table, if you want independence kick them out and start voting ERC and the like.           Can you tell me about any catalan independentist you have had a conversation you liked?           Yep, pretty much all I have ever meet, same with nationalists of any other region. As I said, the problem is not that you're a nationalist, or catalonian, it's because you're a jerk.

First of all, there are almost no occitan separatist in vall daran, you can see it yourself by the results of all the eldctions since 1978. And it is because they know that the government that does more to protect their language and culture is the catalan one. The Aran is the only place in the world were the language is official and thaught in schools and in the public administration, just as catalan. But the spaniards arguments are even more stupid because even if they wanted independence, noone im catalonia would opose it. The main independnetist parties in catalonia (erc, ciu, cup) have gone as far as saying that in any case catalonia will help the vall daran to get international recognition if they want full independence, and most of the population agrees."

spain,3a5qqi,ylcard,3,Thu Jun 18 06:50:18 2015 UTC,"I'm from the US, but I live in Madrid and I am in the process of naturalizing in Spain.  Ideally I like the idea of having a referendum once and for all on the issue. That said, it has to be done within the legal framework that exists and was voted on by an overwhelming majority. Democracy is not simply ""referendum passes, I get what I want"". Democracy means that the laws that are the foundation of a society are able to be changed by people who receive a mandate. The constitution is the constitution because it's meant to be hard to change and that it shouldn't be changed with a 51% vote. Yes it can be frustrating if you don't agree with the status quo, but it is great if you do agree with it. It avoids the whole ""tyranny of the majority"" problem.  If you look at the turnout data and the election data for the constitutional referendum the only place where secessionist tendencies even really had an impact was in the Basque Country (not going to go into that right now) with much lower turnout and much lower approval rates than the rest of Spain because of these exact implication. The VAST majority of Catalonia voted in favor knowing full well what was at stake. Well now a bunch of people don't like the constitution, well you have to work to change it now.  From a practical perspective, it's the Catalan politicians that are really screwing it up by doing things like saying if they get more favors they'll dial it back and completely antagonizing the people they need support from to change the constitution. They prefer to use the social discord in order to get favors to the Generalitat and personally.  Personally I am for a full federal Spain. I don't like that some places have more or fewer rights than others and if some regions would like to work together for efficiency, that's perfectly within their rights but all should start from a same basic place."
spain,3a5qqi,thebadrash,-3,Thu Jun 18 08:35:53 2015 UTC,"I'm English and have lived in Catalonia for about 13 years. I support Catalan independence for a variety of reasons. Firstly, I'm a republican (small 'r'). I don't believe there's any serious political will to fundamentally change the constitutional arrangement in Spain and abolish the monarchy. Podemos at first looked like it offered a chance of change but recently they've started to look a lot like the other parties. A Catalan republic would abolish the monarchy.  Secondly, I believe that small countries work better. Contrary to some other posters who seem to think that the bigger your country is, the better, I'd argue that to better serve the people of a territory, that territory shouldn't be too big. Spain's a big country with huge differences between its lands. The autonomous communities system was supposed to correct this problem but the PP is now trying to roll back rights granted to the communities. Catalonia should be able to manage its own finances. I agree with solidarity with other parts of Spain and Europe but the current system is abusive. I feel like the choice we're looking at is independence or a re-centralized Spanish state.  Thirdly, there is culture. I believe that independence is a political goal and I reject nationalism. I also believe that the Spanish right wing is trying to eradicate Catalan/Valencian from any territories it controls/controlled. Over the last few years, the PP has: changed the name of the Catalan language in Aragon, renamed cities in the Balearic islands, massively reduced Catalan language education in the islands, claimed that Valencian is an ancient language with only minor links to Catalan, blackmailed the Valencian academy by threatening to withdraw funds unless they accept this politicized definition of the language, made Catalan optional for civil servants, banned schools from hanging traditional banners on feast days, talked about the need to 'hispanicize' Catalan schoolkids. From Catalonia, this all feels like a major threat to a culture that Spain has tried to eradicate in the past. People go on and on about nationalism but to me it feels like by far the most overbearing and dominant form of nationalism here is Spanish, not Catalan.  Politics. In Spain, amazingly, after 5 disastrous years of PP rule, there is still a chance that they could win the next elections. In Catalonia, they poll at around 7%. Catalonia and the rest of Spain are really out of step with each other. This situation allows the PP to politicize its treatment of Catalonia because it knows it won't lose many votes here and stands to gain from the anti-Catalan vote in other parts of the country. Convergència, the ruling party in Catalonia, is also conservative. And corrupt. I can't stand them. But they're also much more socially liberal than the PP: they recently voted in favor of an anti-homophobia bill here (the PP voted against). And they rejected the PP's ultra-conservative abortion law reform.  Finally, the intangible: there is no question in my mind that the independence movement is a grass-roots movement putting pressure on the political parties to get on board. Not the other way around, as it is often painted. I've been observing, studying and writing about this for about a decade and this is, in the vast majority of cases, a positive, aspirational, political process. The vast majority of pro-independence Catalans I've met or read online have no hatred whatsoever for Spain. And it's not an ethnic movement. People from all backgrounds get involved. The leaders of the CUP have traditionally Spanish surnames.... My experience of the pro-independence movement is that it is inclusive and absolutely opposed to social tensions or fracture. Unlike large parts of the unionist movement here, led by the Catalan PP which campaigns on xenophobic and racist platforms. When we went to last year's big V in Barcelona, the woman sat across from us on the train was in her 70s, born in Extremadura, didn't speak Catalan, and was 100% behind independence. There are a lot of people like this who are getting involved. The movement is a lot more transversal than you might think if you watch/consume Spanish mass media.  OK that's far too much, I'm sure. PM me if you'd like to talk more."

spain,39uc3m,phlogh,5,Tue Jun 16 05:05:55 2015 UTC,"You've already gotten good answers. A summary:  -You WILL get tapas with all kinds of alcoholic drinks. Also, you will get them if your order almost any kind of soda: a Coke, Fanta, Nestea, Sprite/7 Up and that kind of stuff. In most places you will probably get a tapa if you order a gaseosa. Google translates gaseosa as soda, but if you order a gaseosa the waiter will assume you want a glass of carbonated water.  -You WON'T get tapas if you order a hot drink. This includes all kinds of brews (coffee, tea, poleo menta, tila -like in ¡tómate una tila!-, manzanilla and so on). Also, you won't get a tapa with a milk-containing beverage, like a chocolate milk or a milkshake. And definitely won't get a tapa if you order a glass of tap water. Anyway, you won't even be charged in most places for the tap water, especially if the waiter notices you ordered it to take medication or because you are thirsty.  Also, I'd like to point out, tapas are also served in Jaén (which is a province north of Granada). Although this is not a particularly interesting city (you can see the Arab baths, the Santa Catalina castle and a bunch of minor monuments), the tapa culture here is pretty strong in local bars.

It is relatively small so you can visit everything relevant in a about a day.  If possible use the other days of you trip to visit, of course, Barcelona but to the north there's also the volcanic area of the Garrotxa with other beautiful cities such as Olot, Besalú and Castellfollit de la roca and extinct volcanoes that you can hike up to the crater!  If the sea is something you fancy more, to the north you'll find the beautiful coastal town of ""Cadaqués"". The whole northen cliff features spectacular cliffs, small beaches ""calas"" and often long paths to walk along the coastline as long as you want. Check out the GR-92 route if you like walking.   Furthermore, only half an hour away from Girona there's Figueres which is famous for its Dali museum, the most important museum of the surrealist artist ""Salvador Dali"" who lived in that city.  Finally, make sure to check beforehand which restaurants you'd like to visit. Although expensive, some of the world's best restaurants are in the province of Girona.

spain,39ojj5,Cauca,3,Sat Jun 13 19:46:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure this is a correct interpretation, honestly.  To jerk oneself off, menearsela, is not really something you say to another person with that exact verb in the imperative form for some reason. And I don't think it applies to the website either. However that's a pretty good slang level in my view."

spain,39l1gs,volundeit,7,Fri Jun 12 13:54:23 2015 UTC,"I think it could be related to the spanish transition. On the late 70's, early 80's, we went from a strict dictatorship to having a communist party in the ballots. The 80's message of peace, tolerance and modern life was intensified by having been living on the 30's for 40 years.   That's only a theory but maybe you can search around that :)"
spain,39l1gs,ellohir,5,Fri Jun 12 16:35:14 2015 UTC,"As /u/ellohir said, the post-civil war era and the dictatorship reshaped 99% of Spanish culture, including that Christian aspect you mentioned. So if you want to study the rise in tolerance of homosexuality, look no further than the Transition era (post-1975), specially the 1990s, which is, in my opinion, when homosexuality and the overall broader freedom of expression began to take place in Spain. Good Luck!"
spain,39l1gs,spanisharmada,4,Fri Jun 12 17:23:56 2015 UTC,"I thinnk it would be better for your friend to contact people from LGBT rights groups in Spain, they probably can point her/him to some studies. This wikipedia page seems quite a good introduction though: https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexualidad_en_Espa%C3%B1a  My feeling is that after the repression during the Franco regime the spanish society was really seeking to ""liberate"" themselves, specially sexually after all the repression. In the 80s ""la movida madrileña"" and other countercultures  play an important part on the acceptance of LGBT people, a lot of famous artists started 'coming out' as gay in the following years, specially in the 90s, and being on the media."

I was under the same assumption - in terms of it being a counter to the values of Franco's dictatorship.  I found a few books that look very promising, particularly 'De Sodoma a Chueca - Una historia cultural de la homosexualidad En España en el siglo xx' by Alberto Mira (if anyone is interested).  'Los invisibles. Una historia de la homosexualidad masculina en España, 1850-1939' by Francisco Vázquez García and Richard Cleminson also looks interesting, but perhaps is a bit too early for her research."

spain,39l1gs,ultimomono,10,Fri Jun 12 19:01:11 2015 UTC,"Yes - I could be wrong, but statistically I think it's the most tolerant nation in Europe - towards homosexuality. I live in Barcelona, and seeing men (of all sorts of cultural backgrounds) walking hand in hand, for example is completely normal. Kissing too.  And Madrid has Chueca - a thriving gay barrio."
spain,39l1gs,faraox,7,Fri Jun 12 19:12:20 2015 UTC,"Over the past 10-15 years ago, the gay community has really spread its wings and expanded all over the city. There are gay bars and businesses in lots of different neighborhoods now. You see couples holding hands and smooching far outside of Chueca. Kids feel comfortable coming out in high school. I'm from DC, which is another very gay-friendly city, but I'd say the level of acceptance here in Madrid is even higher. It's just not a big deal anymore."

From there you can hook up to another route (on a lesser-traveled mountain road) that goes over the Pyrenees to France from Sant Joan de les Abadesses. It crosses into France near Prats de Molle La Preste. http://www.pirinexus.cat/index.php?id=1&idioma=EN  I was around this area last summer in the height of August vacations and there was virtually zero traffic on the old, small, squiggly mountain roads.

spain,39k1on,lasmolinascolmenar,3,Fri Jun 12 07:21:41 2015 UTC,"Well, it said in the article it is only where demand has exceeded supply.  Besides in Barcelona, Madrid etc. it is more expensive and they might be building specific luxury-style homes or something."
spain,39k1on,alexgmcm,-1,Fri Jun 12 07:46:01 2015 UTC,It would have to be specific something: the Guardian reckons there are many thousands of empty properties in Madrid alone!  http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/feb/23/spain-property-black-market-housing-madrid

spain,39k1on,alexgmcm,3,Fri Jun 12 09:38:03 2015 UTC,How is it greedy - more supply means the prices are lower.  My rent in Barcelona is a fraction of what it would be in London and for a better property.  Go and look at the property market in London if you want to see the fucking nightmare that happens when you block supply from meeting demand (or New York etc.)
spain,39k1on,alexgmcm,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:20:12 2015 UTC,Doesn't that maybe mean the supply is already good? Rents and indeed price per square metre for property in many places in Spain compare favourably with other capital cities such as London - are these Spanish cities short of property? I don't think so from my time spent scouring property ads.  But I'm just one person!

spain,39fj1d,LupineChemist,2,Thu Jun 11 11:27:03 2015 UTC,"No. When you send mail from Spain, it goes through the Spanish mail system, Correos, so you have to get postage from them. US stamps are only for mail sent within the US. You should be able to get stamps at the Spanish post office (again, the sign will say Correos) or at Tabacos shops. Tell them you're mailing something to the US and they should know what stamps you need."

The rest of the things are very easy once you have the nie, social security, the catsalut and the enpadron, getting your digital certificate early helps with lots of things."

spain,39ahiw,blankexpressions,3,Wed Jun 10 12:38:45 2015 UTC,"Is it hugely important that you hire directly from the airport? It can be a lot cheaper if you get the car from an office in the city.  Transport to the city is fast and cheap and if there are a few of you, a taxi is a fixed 30€ so it could be worth it."
spain,39ahiw,LupineChemist,2,Wed Jun 10 13:40:59 2015 UTC,Hi thanks for your good advice. One of our group will already be in Madrid so if it is cheaper to get one from the city we will definitely do that. Thanks!
spain,39ahiw,Luiyo,2,Wed Jun 10 13:47:04 2015 UTC,"apart from that good advise, you should check pepecar http://www.pepecar.com/, I usually rent their cars and vans"
spain,39ahiw,Minidooper,2,Thu Jun 11 07:40:59 2015 UTC,Read the fine print very carefully for each car hire company you look at.  Spanish rental firms have been fighting a big price war and one way they have been clawing back profit is by charging people a flat refuelling fee of around 70 euros.  Regardless of how full you return the car.  Late last year the only car hire company I found that didn't charge the fee was europcar.
spain,39ahiw,GraveRobbingBastard,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:46:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I thought there must be a catch with some of the companies I have looked at, they were very cheap - but that explains it. I think we will go with europcar."
spain,39b7gv,drieszz,3,Wed Jun 10 16:02:35 2015 UTC,"Salou is very touristy and a bit tacky, I would recommend going on the bus to Tarragona for a day or two, I live there so can tell you a little  Tarragona has: - Roman Ruins, Medieval Ruins, Interesting galleries etc - excellent restaurants. I recommend 'Da Nicola' on 'Compte de Rius' - the pizzas there are so big they don't fit on the plates - really nice natural beachers 'Larrabassada' is really nice, as is 'platga llarga'  or, if you want a different scene, you can try Reus, another city a bus ride away, which is quite modern.  Also Cambrils and to a lesser extent, LA Pineda are nice little towns.  The best place in my opinion is Tarragona, you can just wonder around and enjoy the ambiance of a small city quite nicely"
spain,39b7gv,adartis87,2,Wed Jun 10 21:17:11 2015 UTC,Tarragona is so often missed but it's so awesome. Lived there for a year in Plaça de la font and now looking to buy property in the area.

spain,3927vc,Csusmatt,3,Tue Jun 9 05:55:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's weird. It feels like an entirely arbitrary list to me: the UN definitely wouldn't put them in order of importance like this. Like /u/provenquality says, there's no Alhambra which is insane, also no Tarraco (most extensive Roman remains in Spain), just to name two."
spain,3927vc,thebadrash,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:21:11 2015 UTC,I would add somewhere like Belchite to it too but apart from Alhambra not being on it this is a pretty good list - if arbitrary/standardised - it shows how gorgeous Spain is pretty well

If they start speaking English you can continue in English, because somehow they're showing that they prefer it. But I'd always try to start in Spanish.

Madrid is really big and nice city and has some interesting and beautiful places. But the city I like most in Spain is Granada. Granada is a must see.  The north is really nice too, the north coast has some awesome places and cities (like San Sebastian) and Barcelona is really nice too.  It depends a lot of what do you enjoy most or what do you want to do (partying, seeing nature,  meeting with historic places... ) but wherever you go, try to enjoy the different traditions and foods, we have plenty of different cultures in our country.  The «turismo rural» is also really booming now and there is a lot of very small towns, natural parks or mid-nowhere places that are incredibly awesome.  If I where you, I'd specify a bit more about what do you want to see/do or what do you enjoy the most."

spain,38qibb,mastegas,5,Sat Jun 6 19:38:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, football is big deal in all regions of Spain. Obviously in Madrid and Barcelona stadiums are bigger, but that's probably because those are the biggest cities in Spain."
spain,38qibb,pier25,2,Fri Jun 5 23:53:49 2015 UTC,Do you know of any really dedicated fanbases outside of madrid and barcelona come to mind? Or other stadiums notable for a great atmosphere?
spain,38qibb,VamosXeneizes,4,Sat Jun 6 00:13:38 2015 UTC,"There is great passion and amazing futbol throughout the country. There are amazing derbies in Sevilla, Valencia, and the Basque Country. Don't think about it too much, just go to a game, wherever you might find yourself."
spain,38qibb,TheGuyBehindMeInLine,7,Sat Jun 6 00:41:36 2015 UTC,"Athletic Bilbao have a very passionate fan base.  The team is comprised only of people of Basque heritage which they pride themselves on greatly since they have never been relegated since La Liga started (only 3 have never been relegated.  FC Barcelona, Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao and no other teams right now have a policy like that).  Real Sociedad in San Sebastian and Osasuna in Pamplona used to have that policy but Athletic Bilbao had more money so after some time of them buying all the best Basque players Real Sociedad and Osasuna had to recruit players from outside the Basque Country to survive.  A part of history no one ever seems to remember.  The Basque Country has it's own national team (just like the Catalan National Team) but since they cannot compete in international competitions it seems to me they pour their emotions into Athletic, at least here in the province of Bizkaia. The fans of the Galician teams Deportivo la Coruña and Celta Vigo have strong socios that travel to all the away matches.  When they visited Bilbao there were tons of them in the streets singing."
spain,38qibb,metroxed,4,Sat Jun 6 08:08:14 2015 UTC,"The Basque Country, certainly, and especially the Athletic Club Bilbao has a very good atmosphere and perhaps one of the biggest fanbases outside Madrid and Barcelona."
spain,38qibb,virica,2,Sat Jun 6 08:13:17 2015 UTC,"Madrid has two big teams: Real and Atletico. It also has a smaller team in primera called getafe  Barcelona has two teams in primera:barça and espanyol  Valencia has a huge team: Benitez (the one at liverpool) came from here and won the liga with them.  Sevilla has two big teams: The only 4 time winner of the europa league, or whatever its named now and Real Betis(used to be a decent team but a bad owner almost destroyed it)  Bilbao is extremely proud of Athletic. It supposedly only employs basque players(they go to great lengths to sign non basque players but prove that a great great great uncle of them was basque and offered to do so for Higuain for example)  The list is endless as its a huge deal in every city that appears on a map  Entering most stadiums is 30€+ in average matches, 20 on easy matches and 60 on big matches.    All basic shirts are 70€ excluding  Madrid and Barcelona which are 85 because all of them have supporters that will pay that much(Madrid will sell more shirts but all of them have no issues selling them). Madrid will also sell third shirt from Champions League(or the rarest combination you can come up with) with its official logo, the symbol of the competition and whatnot for 100€+, which smaller clubs dont do, but they dont sell as much as the 70 ones  They are doing fine"

spain,38qibb,GlobalHero,5,Sat Jun 6 00:17:03 2015 UTC,Estadio Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan in Sevilla is apparently one of the best to see a game.
spain,38qibb,mastegas,7,Fri Jun 5 23:59:01 2015 UTC,"I would definitely add San Mamés (Athletic de Bilbao) and Vicente Calderón (Atlético de Madrid) to that list, in case someone wants to feel some special atmosphere.  I've also had much fun at Ramón de Carranza (Cádiz FC).  It is a shame that many other stadiums just bring that kind of special feeling only on very important matches (regional duels/derbies or when playing against top teams).  As for OP's question, yes: football is a big issue in Spain, though people tend to be fans of one club but also to support either Real Madrid/FC Barcelona.  To put things in perspective about Spain in general and football in particular, I have always liked this quote:   Spain: Where Politics is Football, Football is Religion, and Religion is Politics."

spain,38qibb,CrimsonShrike,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:46:55 2015 UTC,Its a team that has gone through a lot and their supporters have stuck with it over the years supposedly.  It was quite funny however in the one before last derby(3-0 losing that ended as 3-3) when they were going to go 3-0 to the break people were just about to leave(cameras showed people leaving because its unusual at betis stadium...).  Luckily someone scored 3-1 in the 45 and they almost won the game.
spain,38qibb,daaniloviici,4,Sat Jun 6 17:34:32 2015 UTC,If you saw Barcelona during the game with the Athletic of Bilbao you'd be surprised.  The athletic may not win often (specially with that self-handicap of using only basqe players) but the fanbase is dedicated. I read somewhere that 60000 people went there to support the team when they played against the Barca.
spain,38qibb,phraynk,3,Sat Jun 6 10:25:38 2015 UTC,"Practically any La Liga match is nice to go and watch. Except Getafe, with ridiculous timetables. Once there were more people on the pitch than on the stands.  Jokes aside, there's a huge overall football culture, be where you would"
spain,38qibb,VamosXeneizes,5,Sat Jun 6 00:22:07 2015 UTC,"AUPA ATHLETIC BILBAO Go to a game in San Mames and you will see the one thing basques share with the rest of spain, a diehard love for football. Don't expect to them to play Spain's national anthem."
spain,38qibb,thesearmsshootlasers,2,Sat Jun 6 09:24:50 2015 UTC,"The atmosphere at Madrid or Barca can be a bit boring, especially if it's not a big game. I saw Messi score a hat trick against Mallorca a few years ago and there was almost no crowd reaction. To be fair, I'm pretty sure that game fell on a puente and many socis had sold their tickets to foreign fans like me.  Futbol is big throughout Spain. My personal favorite gameday experience so far has been at the old San Mames in Bilbao (I haven't been to their new stadium yet). Although, Mestalla (Valencia), Sanchez Pizjuan (Sevilla), and the Vicente Calderon (Atletico Madrid) all seem like they would be exciting places to catch a game.  I'll be moving to Galicia in the next few months and am looking forward to taking in the scenes at Celta Vigo and Deportivo la Coruña. As long as the passion is palpable the on-field product will be enjoyable, even if the quality is less than in other places."
spain,38qibb,metroxed,-5,Sat Jun 6 00:38:25 2015 UTC,"It seems to me almost everyone supports Madrid or Barcelona and then has a ""second team "" (usually their local team). It's bullshit tbh."
spain,38qibb,thesearmsshootlasers,2,Sat Jun 6 06:46:07 2015 UTC,Not everywhere. In the Basque Country for example that is certainly not the case.
spain,38qibb,ylcard,3,Sat Jun 6 08:13:54 2015 UTC,Yeah bit of an oversimplification. Sevillans also like their home team. I'm just bitter about the locals where I live I guess.

Beautiful view on a lookout, just don't eat at the mcdonalds in the toledo square or the spanish restaurant next door, they are highway thieves. When i say the toledo square i mean the old city, toledo extends out. I mean inside the medieval walled city.  I remember a group of 4 of us ate at the spanish place there once, and the tab was $200 euro. We didn't even have liquor.  There are a TON of souvernir shops in toledo, too. It is known for forging medieval armature, as well as medieval swords, tons of awesome picture opportunities... Before you leave toledo there is a small park by the city gates, go there, and there is the best churro spot in the park, great benches, awesome place to relax."

spain,38n9hi,DrCaptainFantastic,5,Fri Jun 5 08:58:39 2015 UTC,"Check out idealista for apartments, you might find a short stay place there. Otherwise, you could you use an agency for short term apartment rental like Sevillatiptop.  You'll probably want to live in the center since it's more 'romantic', 'historic', etc.  good neighborhoods include the center, triana, Nervion and Los remedios but again, outside the center you'll find mostly big apartment blocks like in any other city.   You can park on the street, if you can find a spot, which is more difficult in the center but possible in the surrounding neighborhoods.   Seville has good bike paths and traffic isn't too bad in the center. Keep out of the streets where bikes are prohibited (mostly the shopping streets Sierpes, Cuna and Tetuan) to avoid a ticket. You can reach any point of the city from the center by bike in 30 minutes so don't worry about the commute. You can even make it to parts of the Aljarafe by bike and there's a metro from there to the center as well that you can take bikes on. Good neighborhoods in the center include San Jeronimo, Alfalfa, Feria and San Vicente. Alfalfa, Alameda, Arenal and Santa Cruz are nice too but the first three have quite a nightlife and apartments aren't very well soundproofed and Santa Cruz is more touristy so fewer supermarkets, cheap bars a and restaurants.   Culturally there is a lot to do and see, museums a plenty and playscapes are scattered around the city.  For events, check out the Giraldillo.  Have fun in Seville!"

spain,38n9hi,Wingereni,3,Fri Jun 5 09:59:20 2015 UTC,"To piggy-back, the Sevici system in Seville is very well laid out, there are a lot of stations. Bike theft is extremely common, so unless your bikes are real beaters, I'd be wary using them around town if you're thinking of locking them on the street. Obviously overnight, they have to come in with you. So Sevici might make that easier.  Bargain on prices, there's lots of accommodation around, especially apartments, so don't hesitate to counter-offer (within reason!), I did when my parents came to visit and it worked out well. I second everything above too, some solid advice."

The reason so many young spaniards are moving away from it is that it belongs to a culture of animal torture for human pleasure like the toro del vega where a whole town tortures a bull for hours http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toro_de_la_Vega_tournament
spain,38cl66,agirlcalledba,0,Thu Jun 4 05:59:55 2015 UTC,"Toro de la Vega tournament:       The ""Toro de la Vega"" Tournament is a medieval bull festival only celebrated in the town of Tordesillas (province of Valladolid, Spain). The tournament consists on –depending on the sources– the fight, hunt or chase of a bull by hundreds of lancers, in which some of these will try to lance the bull until death, after it has been released through the streets of the town and lead to open field by the runners and participants. If the bull surpasses the limits of the tournament, or the lancers are not capable to kill it, it will be pardoned. The festival is celebrated yearly depending on the date of the Virgen de la Peña festivity (September 8). In recent years, this festival has acquired increasing fame as a result of the protests against it, which denounce the cruelty and suffering to which the bull is punished, as well as the negative picture of the town and the whole country created by the survival of this tradition in the 21st century.

I belive it is very hypocritical to criticize it and demand to stop it while being a carnivor. The animals we eat every day have a shitty life and a shitty death but people don't see it so they look the other way. Bulls have a peaceful life and fight for it the last 10 minutes of theirs. They're sold to be eaten as well. In my opinion, If you don't like it just don't go and see it."

It is very ignorant to asume that people are rooting for the bullfighter to torture the bull. You should at least read about it first before blabing misjudgements. On the other hand, I think this day in age meat production is no longer about survival. Its not at all sustainable to provide meat to an entire planet. At least in a bullfight is an honest thing, you see the bull die fighting beautifully for his life and you eat it the next day in the market.

Why the hell should the bull be forced to fight for it's already doomed life? The process is pointless, are you seriously suggesting that the bulls somehow BENEFIT from it?  To summarize, I think if you like that so much, and you support the bulls so much, you should be put inside the ring with the bull, and if you die - then you fought beautifully for your life, and even though no one will enjoy eating you, someone will DEFINITELY enjoy an organ donation from you!

It's in the middle of Barcelona/Madrid/Bilbao/Valencia, so you have the most important cities in Spain really close. There are also low cost flights to some cities in Europe. Very close to the Pyrenees if snow, adventure sports, hiking or awesome food are your thing. The most expensive out of the three by far, but rental prices have gone down a lot since I last lived there. Good Spanish. Kind of dull. It's one of the nicest places to live in Spain in my opinion, but there's not much to do if you want tons of cultural offerings, foreign cuisine, etc.   Alicante   Good weather (humid though) Beaches Kind of dull. Cheap. Decent connections by plane if you want to travel outside Spain. It's also pretty easy to travel along the coast if you want to do a road trip.   Jaen   Good weather. Andalusian life, which you'll probably enjoy a lot as a student. Very close to Granada and Córdoba for awesome nightlife and tapas. Very cheap. Awful Spanish."

You might look at the temperatures and say ""oh, around 0º in the Winter, not that bad"", that's until you get there and meet the most annoying wind ever, called cierzo. When there's no cierzo, there's dense fog, although I kind of liked that.  Andalusian life is closer to the typical Spanish stereotype: outgoing people who love to be outdoors, laid back lifestyle, cheap food and drinks everywhere, etc. It's a broad generalisation, but it's definitely very different from the North of Spain."

A few Lebanese places around Plaza San Francisco. Kebabs, lol. The awesome Mexican place near Plaza Roma. A few South American ones. Not that specialised and nothing to write home about though.

And that's leaving out a few ones that I like but I reckon are a bit obscure, like Cambodian, Burmese or Georgian.  There are cultural offerings, but nothing compared to other similar sized cities. Also I forgot to mention the lack of good clubs if that's your thing, which I guess it is because you go out a lot!

I won't call el sabor de la india a good restaurant, it's meh at best, very weak on the spicy side.  There're some good small Chinese restaurants around camino las torres, avoid tao, tho.       You have lots of Moroccan and ""Arabic"" restaurants and smoking bars in the madalena, and there's one excellent Turkish one somewhere, sorry, I forgot. sadly the darvish closed a long time ago, but it was a great dervish restaurant. The Asiatic community in zaragoza is quite small, so don't expect to find anything else than Chinese, don't even bother with local ""sushi"" no matter where it's made.        Most of the cuisines you mention are hard to find outside of barcelona and madrid, cities 3 and 5 times bigger than zaragoza, not to mention that regional cooking here is excellent and most people prefer tapeo.       I don't event know if there's any club left in the city, at all, you can find some in the surrounding towns, on the other hand bars and music halls are everywhere, it's just local culture, nothing wrong with that.         I have been living in bilbao and barcelona and find the cultural offer of zaragoza adequate for it's size, but unfortunately hard to find, don't ask me why, it's actually quite sad.        Check the postcards and posters at small bars around plaza san francisco and the caso viejo to get an idea of what's going on, you might want to check the boards at some faculties like letras, inter  or the CTA, also check the university twitter if you're into cinema, there's stuff going on at the pedro cerbuna all the time.

If there was demand for foreign cuisine, there would be Asian resturants, but the few I remember (like Wok in Asia, which was almost decent despite its name) just failed miserably and the ones still standing aren't exactly blooming.  El Sabor de la India is weak on the spicy side because nobody eats spicy here, but they have no problem making your dishes fiery and they even have a spicy menu.

It takes place when there is an anticyclone in the Bay of Biscay and an low-pressure area in the Mediterranean Sea.  It is known since ancient times, and its name stems from the Latin word circius, which probably came from an Iberian word. Cato the Elder described it in the 2nd century BC as ""a wind that fills your mouth and tumbles waggons and armed men.""  It reaches a speed of more than 100 km/h several times each year. Its maximum recorded speed has been 160 km/h in July 1956.  It is more usual in autumn and winter, when larger pressure gradients take place, but a small pressure difference along the Ebro valley is sufficient to initiate a cierzo wind in any season.   The cierzo wind is similar to the mistral of the Rhone valley in France or the bora in the Balcans.

I have hardly heard of Zaragoza and Aragon more generally being full of tourists, especially Americans. So, if you're looking to really get out of your comfort zone and experience the daily life of a local, I think Zaragoza would be your best bet.

I'm sorry if this question makes you uncomfortable, but did you get a look at your attackers? Would you say they looked Spanish or foreign?  There are a lot of violent criminals coming from the Eastern European new accession countries, although they tend to be organized mafias, and there has been some serious problems with gang members from Latin American countries in Madrid. In fact recently a number of gang leaders were deported. So I'm wondering if this is leading to more violent street crime. It would be a bit surprising because the gangs tend to operate in other areas of the city.  Of course with the economy so poor I wouldn't be surprised if desperate Spanish are resorting to violent crime as well :(  Anyway, I hope you are getting about ok and that your research is fruitful.

I was walking down a small street, not entirely lost, and got pretty much hockey-style checked into a wall and hit the ground pretty hard. Took a few kicks to the back, and my ankle was stomped.  Now that I've had time to do some research, I realize I made so many stupid mistakes it's ridiculous. A lot of people are saying it's not my fault but I was incredibly irresponsible and naive. First and foremost I did absolutely NO research about this country before I left home. Second, I didn't read anything about traveling abroad, and this is my first time leaving my home country. I made numerous mistakes, here are some of the big ones:   I was carrying WAY too many Euros on me, and I did not do a good job of concealing that. I was carrying them in my backpack in a bank envelope, I can't think of a worse storage technique. A lot of people saw me reaching into my bag to grab cash everywhere I went. I was wearing a bag with a somewhat large american flag on it. I don't think anyone acted aggressively towards me for that, I know other countries are not the most fond of Americans, but I didn't consider that this flag very clearly marked me as an oblivious tourist. I ventured out into a strange place late at night with no working phone, no contacts, very little knowledge of the language, and all of my valuables stored on me in the most irresponsible way possible. I did all of these things slightly drunk and jetlagged.   I made a lot of really stupid choices. I don't believe anyone deserves to be the victim of crime, but I really need to take responsibility on this one. I really didn't want to travel abroad and be the stupid American, but here I am. The embarressment really stings, man."

spain,37rure,Cauca,2,Sat May 30 20:40:52 2015 UTC,"Rents must last at least 6 months. Worst case scenario, you may have to pay those extra months. Rent is not too expensive in Oviedo compared to larger capitals. You can probably get to a better agreement if you speak directly to the owner though; do not try that with the agency.  About the cash: supermarkets, mid-high class restaurants, clothing, specialised shops will accept plastic. But certain local grocery stores, bars (as in chigres or sidrerias), small workshops, some contractors and certain taxis will mostly only use cash. That being said, carrying more than 100€ in Oviedo should be more than enough and you shouldn't be retrieving more than once a week. And that's probably a stretch.  Also, there's no cashback. On the other hand there's plenty ATMs available on every corner. Places accepting plastic usually have a sticker on the door with the types of cards accepted. If they don't have that, just ask it up front.  If you ever can't pay cash at a given moment for a service you already had, they'll ask you to leave an id or passport behind. Do so unasked and there will be no problem for you to quickly retrieve the needed amount, before the situation gets out of hand (given both parties will eventually struggle with the language, the gesture of leaving an id and making it clear you're off to an atm is pretty self-explaining). If it's about some products they'll just keep them at the register until you come back, no id needed."

spain,37rure,realblade,1 point,Sat May 30 03:21:03 2015 UTC,"Re: the cash/card issue what country are you moving from and are you getting an NIE and Spanish bank account whilst you're there? If you're from UK and not getting account there are great prepay credit cards for travelling which give you a very competitive up to date rate and you can use them at ATMs or as a normal credit card. Look up Caxton card and fair fx   Also rents do not have to be 6 months. It is easy to find short/mid term rentals - for this period you will probably need to pay a bit more and get something with all bills included as it is madness to try and set up utilities for such a short stay. Some air bnb renters will do pretty competitive rental deals for a month or two at a time which actually work out similarly to you paying normal rent and bills yourself. For example my rent and bills in Spain is €500 a month for a long term rental but I have friends who rent smaller flats out in our town via air bnb for the whole summer for about €450 a month... However generally you will need to pay more than a long term renter for a short term rental. Google realtors in ovieda, email them. Ask if this would be an option on any of their properties"

spain,37qucc,Nomad_Girl,2,Sun May 31 00:46:45 2015 UTC,"Lived in Alicante and completely fell in love with it. I don't know Segovia, but I did my fair share of traveling so here are a few things to consider:   -Do your research on where you will be living. Closest to the university is not always a good thing, as a lot of the entertainment (restaurants, bar, museums, etc) are often downtown while universities are on the out skirts. Better to have to take the bus every morning to class, than having to figure out to you are going to get home at 2 am when the buses are no longer running.  -Always take public transport on your trips in country rather than renting a car, much easier.   -If you are planning to visit a big attraction (alhambra, sagrada, etc) try to buy tickets online in advance, You'll save yourself hours in line in some cases.  -Watch your drinking/partying. If you are under 21, I saw a lot of people go crazy and have bad things happen to them. Spain is very safe, and you'll be fine staying out all night, but make sure you have your wits about you when you are outside. If you are a girl, I recommend you always have a buddy with you after dark.   -For traveling abroad, always check RyanAir. It's normally cheaper and quicker than Renfe (train). However, be advised that it is a terrible airline. They charge you per bag so most people just bring a big carry on.  Feel free to PM me if you have any questions. Been to Spain many time and to many different cities. Good luck! and have an awesome time."

The Spanish right wing can't get its head around the fact that one of the net results of backing an illegal and unpopular war in Iraq was inspiring Al-Qaeda to attack Madrid. At the time, the ruling PP (same ones in power now) tried to blame ETA for the bombings, even when it was obvious that they weren't involved. Since then, a tiny group of bloggers led by Luís del Pino have continually claimed that the bombings were carried out by people working with the Spanish Socialist party (PSOE) with the intention of ""destroying Spain"".

IIRC the city buses do not go any farther then the Puente de Pasaje (as this is no longer Coruña proper). So this bus most likely goes directly to the main bus station. Don´t see why you need a map, just go to the stop and wait for the bus. There is probably a timetable printed there, as well as the bus number.  Also, what a shame they have you staying out there instead of in the city. La Coruña is a very nice, pretty place, with a lot going on. (My wife is from there, we go 4 or 5 times a year).

The main bus station is where I need to go so that I can transfer to bus 4 which goes to/nearby the building I have to go to.

Javea is VERY quiet but does have some ultra cool beach tiki bars and restuarants on their main beach (Arensal beach).

If you want ""local"" cuisine, don't bother with recommendations, and I'd advise ditching BCN altogether, go to a town nearby and look for tables on the sidewalk, sit down, and order as much of your local cuisine as you can take (financially or otherwise).

spain,376wzq,DiskPidge,12,Mon May 25 11:08:37 2015 UTC,"Lugo is a beautiful small city with lots of history. It calls itself the bimillenial city, as it was founded before 0BC. Its historic center is circled by one of the last standing complete roman walls (pics 1 2 3). Inside the wall, there is a historic centre with pedestrian stone streets, an impressive cathedral, and lots of shopping, eating and nightlife places.   There are also some more modern buildings in other areas inside the wall. Outside the wall, modern streets and buildings (about 4 store) are the norm. Since it's a small town, even the modern area is not so big, you can walk around comfortably and traffic is not dense (mostly 2 lane streets).  About half of the city is circled by the Miño river, which already meanders into a wide and abundant current despite being closer to its sources and many many kilometers away from its end at the sea. Most of the river course is an extensive park that is well tended and is the the other pride of the city (Pics 1 2 3)  All the areas above are great for running/trekking. The area surrounding the city can be good too, but if you are going to travel you may find even better landscapes just half an hour away in the nearby mountains. With regard to team sports, they have a second division football team that is well loved and has experimented a kind of renaissance recently. They also have a basketball team called CB Breogan with great support, currently in second division. I think there are rowing clubs in the river too, but I am not sure about this.  The weather in Lugo is a mix of galician rainy weather and extreme temperatures more typical of interior regions. Hot days on summer will reach 30ºC and feel even warmer due to the humidity, winter will be freezing cold (down to the -2ºC-ish) but not as humid, and autumn and spring will be very rainy. But, above all, the climate will be very variant so don't expect neither long snow storms, nor many consecutive sunny days without rain. Compared to the British weather, I have only been to Ireland so in my experience I believe that although both are very changing, there is a critical difference in that Galician mountains slow clouds down, so that you can go from beach weather to pouring cats and dogs in a question of two days, not two hours as I saw in the emerald island.  Gallego is mostly spoken in rural Galicia, while the large cities speak Spanish. Lugo-province is the most rural of Galicia and even in the capital city you will get a little bit of both flavors. You will find plenty of opportunities to learn and practice Gallego if you are interested, but you will also be able to speak Spanish if Gallego is a limitation to you.  If you stay for the summer, be sure to come visit the seaside region of A Mariña de Lugo. We have the best parties."

spain,36z8ae,daverod74,5,Sat May 23 19:38:02 2015 UTC,The easiest way for a student to extend their time here legally is by applying for a prórroga. The requirements for the prórroga are a lot simpler and easier to satisfy than the requirements for the initial student visa that you apply for at the consulate.
spain,36z8ae,ultimomono,1 point,Sat May 23 21:09:19 2015 UTC,Could you elaborate if the extension is due to the bureaucratic process? Or perhaps it's a quick procedure with a high rate of approval?
spain,36z8ae,ylcard,2,Sun May 31 21:02:56 2015 UTC,"To apply for a prórroga, you have to provide certain documentation (grades from your previous year of studies, proof of funds in a bank, proof of health insurance, a ""reserva de plaza"" or matrícula for the next year, etc.). If they accept your documentation, then your solicitud is en trámite. You have the right to be in the country while your request for an extension is en trámite, which gives you three more months (the amount of time it generally takes to approve an extension), right off the bat.   You don't necessarily have to be a full-time student to get the prórroga if you are studying at a university as a regular student. Sometimes the timing is such that you can't provide the matrícula, because it's not possible to register for classes until later."
spain,36z8ae,ultimomono,1 point,Sun May 31 22:57:42 2015 UTC,"So the extension is due to the long process it takes to be completed, not the actual prórroga being granted. The wonders of España..."
spain,36z8ae,ylcard,1 point,Mon Jun 1 07:29:43 2015 UTC,"Well, not exactly. Anytime your papers have been accepted for processing (making your request en trámite), you have the right to stay in the country. In most cases, they won't accept your papers unless you have everything you would need to get the request approved. There's always a set plaza for approving requests--usually three months. So you are supposed to request an extension of your student residency well before it runs out, but I believe you also get a 30-day window after it expires to renew it. You can use this to stretch out your time a bit. But this only works if you have the longer-term type of student residency with the TIE, not for shorter types of student visas.  People complain a lot about the residency process here, but I don't really get it. It's really pretty simple if you follow the rules and policies like arraigo social are quite forgiving--much more so than most other countries. Maybe the language barrier makes it seem harder than it is. Also, back when the economy was good, the wait lines to process papers were insane. Now you pretty much walk in and out in 20 minutes. It's like night and day.  Getting the visa from the consulate, on the other hand, is however a colossal pain in the ass. As is dealing with the American consulate in Spain, which doesn't even provide a fraction of the services that other consulates do."
spain,36z8ae,ultimomono,1 point,Mon Jun 1 11:00:28 2015 UTC,"I was in your situation and wasn't allowed to get a prorroga. Apparently whether you're eligible or not depends on which Spanish consulate you got it at in the U.S. and which type of visa they give you. I had a six month visa.  Anyway, I stayed til August with my visa expiry around the end of June. No problems. Not even gonna tell you the customary ""But they might just catch you..."" because it's not gonna happen that as you're leaving Spain the ONE time you've overstayed your visa, they check your passport and give you the old ""...and stay out!""  Hope you get your extension. My friends did because they went to the DC consulate. If not, you'll be fine. Spain's got problems, and you're not one of them."
spain,36z8ae,alamedeandera,1 point,Tue May 26 20:01:11 2015 UTC,"Ok, thanks! I'm asking around, finding out anything and everything about any possibility of getting a prorroga.

Only thing is, I'd love to come back to Spain and work (somehow) after I graduate from college (which is in a year), so if in worst case scenario I get banned from returning, put on some kind of list, or something for overstaying my visa, that'd kinda really suck.  Also, I got my visa from the Miami consulate if that means anything."

In January of 2013 I moved back here to be with my now husband and started working the next month. No regrets.   Yeah, that doubt will be floating around in your head if you stay without a prórroga. But really, I ran through all the scenarios in my head while I was here. If they were to catch ya in the airport leaving, you just say you went around traveling with friends (of course not by plane) and came back to fly out of Spain. ""I thought I'm on a tourist visa now."" You're a normal student, like hundreds who do the same thing you're doing.   I don't know anyone who went to Miami.

This is in the town my father's from, Verín! But closeby towns have their own thing; Really fun parties!  The best polvo a feira (after a road trip to many cities in Galicia ordering pulpos and us 3 official judges judging on various criteria) is the one we had a O Carballiño, 10 mins away of Orense  ; the olive oil used ultimately made the difference.

Those horses live in mountains owned by the villages (a form of property derived from the Suevi, around 8th century) and have several owners (private owners, the parish or the village), each year the foal are marked and the adults shaved and deloused, and then freed again to the mountains.

Rain is a possibility but chances are you will be able to do a lot of things without mayor issues.   I really think that going to tangier is a bad idea.  You may think it's cool to have an ""african""  experience,  but IMO tangier is just a big tourist trap and not much more. I have been there twice over the last years and have no intention of going back in my life.   There are loads of things to do in Andalusia and if you like skying there is a fantastic resort called ""Sierra nevada""  30 minutes away from Granada....  And if you are lucky you can see Africa from the top of the mountain ;)"
spain,36rnbv,epitomizer_,1 point,Thu May 21 18:10:12 2015 UTC,So you wouldn't go to Tangier? Even for Day? I am from such a small town in the US and feel that it would be such a unique experience.
spain,36rnbv,epitomizer_,3,Fri May 22 03:26:42 2015 UTC,"Well,  it certainly is a different experience, but the city is not particularly nice and you will be seen as a walking wallet. Everybody will try to sell you something or take you to a shop where they can get a commission.  You are an American and people will notice and try to charge you extra. I just have the feeling that you can have a disappointing visit because you will not be used to that kind of ""pressure""  but please get more opinions.   There are much nicer places in Morocco but you will need at least 3 days to do a proper trip. Fez is amazing but you will probably need a local guide.  Marrakech is full of tourists,  but it truly is a fantastic experience. There are also other interesting places around and you can always book a tour.   Anyway,  if you have 9 days and that budget you can have a blast in Andalusia.  There is little tourism in March and luxury hotels will be pretty cheap."
spain,36rnbv,fleetingeyes,1 point,Fri May 22 07:03:18 2015 UTC,"As someone who has been to Tangier... No. Fun fact: My mom and I went to Tangier (my mom wanted to go to Morocco, really) all by ourselves - this is not the issue. The issue is that being two women, we were constantly hustled by men trying to ""guide"" us every which way. This also happened to a couple in their mid-40's while we were there.   We walked a lot, saw the ""new"" part of town... and there's nothing great about it. If you go to Tangier in the end make note that outside of the Medina only Arabic and French is spoken.  I feel that since you have only 9 days that won't be sufficient to get to nicer places in Morocco. Granada to Tarifa will take about 2-2.5 hours by car, a boat to Tarifa 1 more hour, and a car/bus ride to, say, Assilah another hour - so a total of 4 hours of travel just to get somewhere.  If you do go to Assilah, I'm not sure how you can go about this, but try assigning a tour guide group of some sort to bus you there. You don't want to take a taxi.  Best of luck and enjoy!"

But there are things like subterraneo shop for example which is a shop that is owned entirely by SFDK, the main Rap duo in Seville.  They sell the same things as most hip hop stores but you should be able to find Brand lealty clothing which is the bands own brand and difficult to find elsewhere(neat if hip hop is your thing I guess)  Cheap drinks are what you see on the streets.  La sureña and La provenzal own this area but you may want to go to http://sevilla.salir.com/los_botellines which is what used to be popular before sureña and provenzal took over.  You need to go to bodeguita  Romero and order a pringa, at least one of them, and while you are at it go to bodeguita Antonio Romero and order a piripi(both are cheap food that locals enjoy, expect the places to be packed).  As for places to go to:  Go through La Juderia if you havent and get lost in barrio santa ana(it literally happens to the best of us) appear on most tourist guides but its something that you need to do.  See las setas de la Encarnacion  at least once. Go for a  walk at their roof even if the structure looks unnapealing, its got one of the best views in the city even if its annoying to look at for most people and you can spend hours just looking at all the structures in the city.  Go to casa pilato/Italica if you are into archaolegical things. Italica is  an old roman city which remains are still standing and the main thing to see but casa pilato is filled with items that were literally stolen from there.  Go for a walk in the gardens of the Alcazar or go inside without a group if you think that you may like the place , the full visit is way too longwinded IMO, they are breath taking  Get a ticket to Territorios(I would go for a 1 day but you can get both if you wish) if you want to see how young people/alternatives from all over Spain that follow music festivals party  Thats probably it.  Thinking back on it some sort of acquaintance was surprised to see I didnt know what the Good Burger was and apparently Thursdays are the day to go there(buy 1 get 2 of whatever food you want to have) and Peggy sue is an old fashioned fast food place 60s themed with a record player.  I have been meaning to go to both places for a bit but I would have to go there by myself(mentioned it to friends for a while no one was that excited about either) which is somewhat deppressing so I keep putting it off"

In front of Plaza Ponce de León there's a bar called La Fresqui. Good everything, owned and run by a couple and their son. Back in nearby Plaza ¿San Leandro? (we call it pila del pato because there's a fountain with a duck on it) go to La Jama for 50 cent Cruzcampo bottles and cheap delicious sandwiches. It's the new plaza de los botellines, even though the original still is totally popular. Go to both, like alternate days. ""El cateto"" will fill you up. Casa Manuel right next door has delish homemade food. Perfect for lunch or dinner.   hah MUST go to Carlochi bar, near the well-known Alfalfa. It's like, semana santa-themed. Like what it would be like to drink while riding on a paso from holy week.   I love Matakas bar, too, on Calle Matahacas.  GREAT BREAKFAST at Café D'arthe, on ¿Gonzalo Bilbao? BEST CHURROS AROUND at bar El Pilar on the corner of José Laguillo and María Auxiliadora. AND OMG Calle Regina La Cacharrería has wonderful breakfast. Make their own bread. There's a cookie shop across the street. La Mercería next door has iced teas in the hot weather.   LA BICICLETERÍA on Calle Feria is the artsy bar you have in mind, and LOS CORRALONES are like tiny industrial workshops on Calle Castellar where there are sometimes concerts at night.

Near there you have an ice-cream shop/gelateria called Los Italianos where you can try the the house special ""Cassata""  Things to do: obviously go to the Alhambra (don't forget to get your tickets at least one week in advance) and the Generalife, in the city centre you can find the ""alcaiceria"" (Souq), the cathedral, La Madraza, you can go  to Carrera del Darro (also called Paseo de los tristes) in where you can find El Bañuelo and come to the Albayzín (a World Heritage Site): Mirador de San Nicolás,  you can continue to the Sacromonte a neighbourhood know by the home-caves.

You might want to buy a lock before you go though since some places will offer a locker but not provide locks/keys. Train stations in many cities have luggage storage for the days that usually aren't too expensive, or airports as well if you are taking suitcases around and won't need them until you fly out again. Just make sure you can pay them in exact cash because they don't take cards (both trains stations and airports)."

During summer you will most likely find winter clothes that are cheap.  I do not know any brands as its just not something I am that interested in but you can find items made with piel de ubrique(the good leather) in most stores(from corte ingles to small clothing stores).  Zara  for example has its own sales as well (I got my jacket on Zara on a sale at the end of winter 4 years ago and it still holding strong) where items are discounted but they will only fit leather jackets for customers as they are scared of people returning items(its common to buy way too many items during sales periods /find other items you like more elsewhere and try to return the others for some people).   The catch is that you literally need to go from store to store because sales bring a lot of people and the items you are searching for may be long gone if you have a somewhat common size

spain,36palj,GnarlyBear,2,Thu May 21 08:25:15 2015 UTC,"January, July and August are the sale months.   Depends on what you call quality really. I find middle of the range brands - Massimo Dutti, Adolfo Dominguez etc to be massively over priced for the quality of the clothes. However, you can go into towns and get no name tailoring at good prices (still lots of crud so know what you are doing), the sports stores will have sales on and the department stores will have better brands on sale."

spain,36kdc7,LupineChemist,0,Wed May 20 08:13:30 2015 UTC,"We are US citizens and we do not speak spanish. That's why I'm interested in teaching there. We're really at a point in our lives where we won't have this opportunity again (no kids) and I really feel like now is the time to try to move overseas. My husband would feel a lot more comfortable with at least one of us having a job there (he's more organized and ritualistic) while I wouldn't mind just selling everything and going. Thanks for all your advice. Like I said, we're at the beginning stages and really have no idea where to start."
spain,36kdc7,parasiempre,1 point,Fri May 22 02:13:48 2015 UTC,"If you're under 30(? I think) you can do the Auxiliares de Conversación program through the Spanish government. Downsides to that are limited freedom to decide where to live/teach. You could also look into BEDA/UCETAM. A lot of places won't contract/hire you for a teaching position before you even get to the country though, so the negatives of these types of programs might be worth it if you're set on having something in place before you leave.   Do you have any idea about where in Spain you'd like to live? I'd definitely recommend looking at major cities because a) it's easier to find work there and b) more people will speak English.   As far as finding somewhere to live, assuming you're renting and not buying, I'd use airbnb for the first week or two while you look for an apartment. (I know some people who have actually used airbnb for extended periods of time, but it's not the most economical option.) It's not hard to find apartments here unless you're looking for a place months in advance- most rooms/apartments are available almost immediately from the moment people post them online.   Another thing I'd recommend is signing up for Spanish classes at an academy; do this before you leave and you can use the enrollment letter to apply for a student visa. You'll definitely want to learn at least basic Spanish anyway. Can you survive/function without it? Yes. Can you truly experience and appreciate the city when you can't communicate with the majority of the people who live in it? In my opinion, no. I live in Madrid and can't even imagine being comfortable here not being able to speak Spanish. Then again, I have roommates who do it, so it's possible.   This is really long and rambly so I'm just going to backtrack here and say that I think your next steps should be:    Find the Spanish Consulate closest to you and look at their requirements for the different types of visas. Decide which would make the most sense for you and your husband to apply for. Do some research and narrow down the list of cities you'd be interested in living in.  Decide what you'll be using to apply for your visa (ex. through what program/employer/etc.) Start getting together the papers for your visa and make an appointment.    Also feel free to PM me if you have specific questions. I'm from the US, I've lived in Murcia (southern Spain) and I'm currently living in Madrid teaching English. I've also been to lots of other cities in Spain and know a few Spaniards from other cities so if I can't help I can try to find someone else who can!"

I actually got moved to one of the privatized specialist systems and hospitals and like it more (they basically contracted it out to a non-profit).

The beach and bay is also known as Playa de Bolonia (""Bolonia Beach""), Ensenada de Bolonia (""Bolonia Cove""), or Bolonia Bay. The ruins of the Roman town of Baelo Claudia are located near the beach, considered to be the most complete Roman town ruins yet uncovered in Spain.

It's like I don't have further goals in life... well I guess this whole thing will change at some point.

I was stuck on a big company (on bad times), learning nothing, with no progression and no future and definitely that's not what I'm looking for at this point of my career.

Regardless of where they were born and raised, the duties they had to do were the same. Instead of mandatory conscription ('la mili'), they had to do the Social Service (Servicio Social) as they were women. They learned how to sow and clean and all that, making them 'women' for those standards.  My mom's mom had to work at her family's tailoring business after school to help bring in the income. She was pretty much deprived of a childhood, and she blamed it all on the war. She was the stereotypical ""Catalan working class."" Once she met my grandfather she started to get a hold of her life but she still had to work like men did, for less pay. This grandma only had one child (my mom) because she couldnt afford having another one. Leisure for them was going to their summer home on the tram (street car) and spend summers and weekends there.  My dad's mom lived a much more confortable life. She was born in La Rioja and lived in Madrid with her husband (my grandpa), who's family had an extremely important role in the Spanish War (my great grandpa was Field Marshall, Capitan General in Spanish, and almost Minister of War). Even though she wasn't allowed to go to university, she never worked in her life. She lived the steretypical high class life. Her husband and his family took care of everything and she just had to take care of the five children she gave birth to. For leisure, they went to their summer home, skiing trips, flights abroad....

Urban planning is the instrument through which towns write down the preferred use for landscape and traditional farming lands, agreed upon by neighbors.   When a developer follows irregular planning, it is often in areas where new developments would harm aquifers needed by farmers, landscapes needed by outdoors activity planners, and iconic architecture in the villages.

The Mediterranean coast (Barcelona included) get very hot during the summer (and very crowded besides). Donostia is a great choice because you'll have fine weather (occasionally rain), a lovely beach and lots of activities of every kind: the good thing about the Basque region is that the four cities (Donostia, Bilbao, Pamplona and Vitoria) are all within 1-2h drive from one another, so you'll have plenty  of things to do.  Music festivals in Bilbao (BBK Live and many others), Donostia and Vitoria (famous jazz festival), big parties (the Big Week of Bilbao, San Fermin in Pamplona, the Festivities of Donostia and Vitoria), many places to explore (the Basque countryside, hiking in the Basque mountains), amazing food, great beaches and world-famous surfing spots (Mundaka, Zarautz, Saint-Jean-de-Luz).

spain,35leuo,fodtp,3,Tue May 12 08:24:55 2015 UTC,"Oh boy. Please stop, you're just embarrasing yourself.  Euskal Herria is not a political entity, and as such does not exist juridically. It is just a cultural territory, a place where the Basque language is spoken and the Basque culture and traditions are practiced. We have common landscapes, architecture, expressions and languages. There are many regions like this all across Europe (Occitania, Carinthia, Laponia, Pomerania, etc.).    It is a well-recognized territory, not an ""invention"" by nationalists, as the term and idea of ""Euskal Herria"" predate the emergence of Basque nationalism by three centuries. The idea that it is just a recently-invented lie, that is contemporary, and fueled by Spanish nationalism (""there can be no other nation than the Spanish nation"", right?)  If people from Euskadi, people from Higher Navarre and people from Iparralde (the French Basque Country) identify as Basque and agree they're living in a cultural territory called Basque Country, you, coming from God-knows-where, are no one to tell US otherwise."
spain,35leuo,iagovar,0,Tue May 12 09:13:15 2015 UTC,"It's a shame you don't know your own history. I don't blame you, it's hard to liberate yourself for such a huge nationalist propaganda machine.  Maybe someday you'll grow up intellectually and learn from well proven sources the real history of the place where you've been born.  Tip: a single Wikipedia article is not a well proven historical source. You should know by now how some articles are rigged by powerful lobbies.  You said ""Euskal Herria is not a political entity, and as such does not exist juridically [...] It is a well-recognized territory"". Recognized by whom?  You said ""there can be no other nation than the Spanish nation"", right?  Of course could be another nations but to this day there's only one legal nation (Spain). And yes, that's the difference between fantasy and reality.  Who's embarrassing himself? Maybe you and your condescending* rant.  One could just laugh to that fantasy, or feel pity for the people swallowing the hand-crafted history by racist lunatics like Sabino Arana, but too many people has been assassinated by bastards believing that fantasy, and too many basques have leaved their home running away from all that craziness.  Are no-nationalist basques less basques? If a Basque, or a Navarre, feels also Spanish is less Basque or Navarre for that?  Someday you'll have to explain me why Navarre was a Kingdom, the now called Basque Country always was Basque Provinces, but now the Basque nationalists say they are the center of a great country and Navarre is just an appendix."
spain,35leuo,iagovar,3,Tue May 12 10:03:45 2015 UTC,"It amuses me that you go all the way to say that I'm condescending, when that is in fact what you are doing.   well proven sources the real history of the place where you've been born.   I know the history of place I'm from. Some people, like you presumably, seem to believe that we Basques are raised in an alternate reality, where we are told that a political state called Euskal Herria existed, that it had seven provinces and that we were independent until the cruel Castilians take our freedom away from us. Let me tell you, we are not that stupid. No one with half a brain is saying any of those things. We know that Euskal Herria never existed as a political, independent entity. It is a cultural concept, of the Basque-speaking lands. We see it as our nation, different from our political state, which is Spain (or France). Because ""nation"" and ""state"" do not mean the same thing. Our state is Spain, our nation is Euskal Herria. That much is clear.  The idea for an independent Basque Country is not based on historical justifications. Euskal Herria never existed in the past as such (although the Duchy of Vasconia was pretty close), but that is irrelevant for what we want now.   Tip: a single Wikipedia article is not a well proven historical source.   You can look wherever you want in all the languages you want, Spanish and French included. Everywhere Euskal Herria / País Vasco / Vasconia is recognized as a cultural region, land where the Basque people live. No one is saying nothing about history, past or present. It is just the land, divided between two states, where we live.    You should know by now how some articles are rigged by powerful lobbies.   Please. Leave your conspiracies behind.   Of course could be another nations but to this day there's only one legal nation (Spain)   Nations are not defined by legality, states are. Juridically, by law, Spain and France are the only political states of the Basque people. Nation refers to our condition as a people, joined together by common history, culture, language and traditions.    One could just laugh to that fantasy, or feel pity for the people swallowing the hand-crafted history by racist lunatics like Sabino Arana   You Spanish nationalists give far too much credit to Sabino Arana. The only two things that actually come from him are the Basque flag and the PNV. Euskal Herria as a cultural entity already existed before him. The idea of a Basque nation was not invented by Arana.    Are no-nationalist basques less basques? If a Basque, or a Navarre, feels also Spanish is less Basque or Navarre for that?   No one is saying that. Actually, many Basques relate to their political state and at the same time to the idea of Euskal Herria. French Basques are a good example. They all feel French. Still, they recognize our cultural homeland (ever been to the French Basque Country? Everything is packed with Basque symbols, flags, shields and drawings of the whole Euskal Herria). Because both things happen to be compatible. Why? Because France and Spain are political states and Euskal Herria is a cultural nation.   but now the Basque nationalists say they are the center of a great country and Navarre is just an appendix.   No one is saying that. Besides, many Navarrese feel Basque. In France the Lower Navarre IS part of the French Basque Country (let me remind you that Lower Navarre was an independent kingdom for much longer than the Higher Navarre in Spain) and no one bats an eye."
spain,35leuo,thebadrash,-1,Tue May 12 10:48:26 2015 UTC,"It sadden me it's impossible to have a well documented discussion with a nationalist.  It's such blindness to reality, such knee-jerk reaction when someone talk about the topic. That need to classify the person before hand in order to establish that his/her opinions are worthless...  You said:   you, coming from God-knows-where  You Spanish nationalists  ever been to the French Basque Country?   What a way to set your arguments.  By the way: God knows where I'm from, I'm not a Spanish nationalist (I'm only trying to explain the real History of a part of Spain), and yes I've been in the south of France many times.  The only point you make to establish a presume Euskal Herria reality is that's ""a cultural thing"", but you don't explain how is possible the existence of other ""cultural things"" in the same place and why one must prevail over the other.  You also talk about nationalist paraphernalia, but that's only another piece of the well greased nationalist propaganda machine. And if you dig deeper you'll find all those ""Basque symbols, flags, shields and drawings"" have little to none historical backing.  Another question for you: Don't you find strange that Sabino Arana invented the PNV flag copying the British one (Union Jack) changing colors and then the PNV flag was imposed as the Basque Country flag? Yep, a lot of historic basis for that, don't you think?   Euskal Herria as a cultural entity already existed before him   I suggest you learn about Carlism, that the real source of all Basque nationalist nonsense."
spain,35leuo,Weckhurst1,3,Tue May 12 11:32:42 2015 UTC,"You're just pulling a straw man now and completely disregarding and ignoring what I've said. You have not addressed the topic about Euskal Herria being a cultural region and not a political entity, either because you've run out of arguments (choosing to attack me instead, categorizing me as someone ""impossible to have an argument with"") or because you do realize that the concept of Euskal Herria is not incompatible with having Spain and/or France as a political state.  Also, it is curious how you avoided to refer to the French Basque Country as such, calling it ""the south of France"" instead. The French Basques do not want independence and feel French, and yet they have no problem identifying as Basque, calling their territory the Pays basque and setting up bilingual signs and Basque flags in the town halls, despite having no legal obligation to do so. Maybe because that place also is the Basque Country and they are also Basques.    and why one must prevail over the other.   I never said that. If anything, I said the opposite. You can relate to your political state and at the same time recognize Euskal Herria as your cultural nation. The French Basques already do it.   And if you dig deeper you'll find all those ""Basque symbols, flags, shields and drawings"" have little to none historical backing.   Even if they were all invented yesterday, why does it matter? We have chosen to relate to them and feel identified by them. They are real now. Who cares if they have 5 years or 500? No one is claiming they are as old as fire. We just say they are our symbols.   Another question for you: Don't you find strange that Sabino Arana invented the PNV flag copying the British one (Union Jack) changing colors and then the PNV flag was imposed as the Basque Country flag? Yep, a lot of historic basis for that, don't you think?   Sorry mate, but this only shows your how your own knowledge is lacking on the issue, despite all your claims of me being the ignorant one. Arana never copied the Union Jack. He inspired himself in the coat of arms of the Lordship of Biscay, whence he got the symbolism: white cross representing Christianity and the green saltire representing the oak of Gernika, and in the royal standard of the Kingdom of Navarre, from where he got the general design, plus red which traditionally has been the colour of the Navarrese monarchs. This flag, by the way, is older than the Union Jack.   But even if he had invented it all, again, who cares? We have adopted it as our own. Even the French Basques have, even though the PNV has little support there and Arana is probably completely unknown.    I suggest you learn about Carlism, that the real source of all Basque nationalist nonsense   I already know about Carlism. The Carlists wanted to keep the fueros so they supported Carlos instead of Isabel after Fernando VII died, as Carlos was much more conservative, religious and anti-liberal. They wanted to keep the Basque laws and fueros, while the Isabelinos wanted to create a more centralised, liberal country, a la France. By the way, Sabino Arana came from a Carlist family.   If you believe that Carlists were ""true Spanish patriots"" or whatever (some people seem to believe that), no, they just wanted to keep the Basque and Navarrese autonomy, that is all."

Meal timings are quite different. It may be worthwhile to have snacks with you for a few days.    Handy tips for jet lag:  It's really really important that you do not nap, or go to bed really early when you arrive. You have to stay up until a reasonable bed time, and also force yourself out of bed in the morning at the correct time. It is way easier and quicker to adjust, it should take about 2 days.

I am also an American was actually just hired to go back to Spain to teach through the BEDA program which is through the ministry of catholic/private schools (I believe). They pay a lot more money than the auxiliaries program and they set up your bank accounts and health insurance too. Only downfall to this program is that I interviewed in December and literally just found out this past Tuesday. You get to have a say in where you're placed which is nice too.

Check this site: (http://www.mundojuridico.info/devuelven-la-fianza-del-alquiler/) Let me make a resume:   First of all, contact directly your landlord and explain to him the situation, trying to come to terms. Sometimes the landlord doesn't know anything about how the agency is managing his apartment.  If he plays dumb, you have to send him (and to the agency) a burofax (a kind of certified fax) from the post office making a formal request of the deposit. If you do this, look for templates on the internet and be as precise as possible (including your ID, agency and landlord data, referencia catrastal of the apartment, the lease data too, etc.). Save this paper because it can be really important if you have to go to court. If after a week they don't give your money back, you can place an order for payment procedure, procedimiento monitorio, at the Court of First Instance (Juzgado de Primera Instancia). This kind of trial is fast and cheap (you don't need a lawyer, but those who you are demanding do). It's important to know if you have any witnesses ofr pictures taken of the house before and after you moved out, so you can defend yourself against those accusations.  Very important: try to contact your Community Atención al Ciudadano service, and ask for help. According to the LAU, Ley de Arrendamientos Urbanos, it's mandatory that the landlord credits the deposit money on your Autonomous Community Ministerio de Vivienda. You can go with the deposit's receipt and your lease to an Atención al ciudadano office, and ask for an inspection of that credit. Depending on each Community' laws, he will have to pay a expensive penalty fee for that.    If there is anything I could help, just let me know. Good luck!"

Ponferrada has a sick Templars Castle in it, and like mostlygrumpy mentioned, there's a lot of outdoorsy stuff around that area. Las Médulas is a cool area where the Roman's used hydraulic mining to mine gold.

Maybe is a depressed region, because it was a miner region, and this industry is near to be extinct. However it's a very comfortable city, no need of a car, just a bike could be enough. What makes me love it is the mountains, the big amount of forests, lakes and pure nature.   Our weather it's not so cold in winter, but the high humidity in this valley causes a winter and spring of thick fog. Summer here is about 30ºC/35ºC.  Nightlife is not great, but León and Lugo are almost an hour from here. Anyway there are enough pubs and nightclubs for a small city. But what you will love are the restaurants. Plenty of them, has the perfect mix of mountain and seafood (octopus!) to gain some kg of fat soon, so will make you realize another fact of Ponferrada, we like sports, trail running and BTT are the kings.

That said, if I had to guess nightlife will shut down fairly early for the most part.

spain,34xb5j,realblade,11,Tue May 5 11:13:42 2015 UTC,"Ok, so legally you are entitled to a NIE card. You have to go to one of these offices: http://www.seap.minhap.gob.es/es/ministerio/delegaciones_gobierno/delegaciones/madrid/extranjeria.html  You have to take with you, both originals and copy: passport or national ID, ~20 euros and certificado de empadronamiento (registration of residency). For the last one you have to go to the town hall and register if you haven't done that already (house contract + ID/passport). It's valid for 3 months, and mention that it's for tarjeta de residencia, in case they have a special one in Madrid. This is done in place, so it shouldn't take you more than an hour.  With all those documents prepared, go to one of the offices found in the link above. They'll give you a form that you have to fill in and a payment order that you have to take to a bank and pay (~15 euros if I remember correctly). Then you take the filled form and the payment proof and you wait in line until they call you, and they'll print the NIE for you.  This is how it's done in Mallorca, but I'm not sure if you need an appointment in Madrid.  All things aside, keep in mind that the Police only deals with Spanish documents, which the NIE is not."

Also, keep in mind that the NIE is not a valid proof of identity, just residency. You have to keep an official document with a photo on you at all times (your Irish national ID, passport or driving license).  Good luck!"
spain,34xb5j,willworth,1 point,Tue May 5 14:42:52 2015 UTC,"A NIE does not prove legal residency in any way. It is merely an identifying number.  You can have a residency permit associated with a NIE (the NIE is required for it), but the NIE can also stand alone."

spain,34xb5j,chainedchaos31,6,Tue May 5 11:05:51 2015 UTC,"First of all, do you have any proof of your Spanish nationality? Have your parents asked for it?  If you're a Spanish citizen (and have the documents to prove it) you don't need a NIE, as that is for people who are not Spanish (extranjeros/foreigners).  In your case, you should make an appointment to nearest Policia Nacional office near your, with the following documents: * national ID original and copy OR birth certificate (Spanish) * around 15 euros (not sure on the exact amount) * recent color photo (either photo booth or find a photographer near you and tell them it's for the DNI) * your/an index finger for the fingerprint :) * recent certificado de empadronamiento (proof of residency, valability: 3 months)  Keep in mind that you can call the information lines for all this info, don't bother with a lawyer or a gestoria, you can do all this in a day."

spain,34vd3p,SavannahisaGeek,4,Mon May 4 21:38:47 2015 UTC,"I'm sure you'll have a great time.  A note on your Spanish (which is great for a 16 year old!):  you're using pronouns a lot more than you need to.  YO estoy, YO tengo... This isn't exactly wrong, but it's redundant as the info is transmitted in the verb endings (tengo, tienes etc).  Including them all the time makes you seem a rookie.  Please take this in the spirit of helpful advice intended, not as criticism... As I said, a great level for 16.  Valencia is a great city.  Get yourself one of the ten trip metro/tram passes and get out there and explore.  Benimaclet is a young person/student district.  You're going to have an amazing time."
spain,34vd3p,willworth,3,Wed May 6 08:28:19 2015 UTC,"Just remember not to do reckless things just to fit in, Valencia has nice polite teenagers but also meanie jerks. Mind that ""farm"" here means a really little thing with a few chickens and maybe a cow so there could be some misunderstanding here and there.  Manners and dressing is mostly the same as casual style in USA, but you won't have any trouble dressing punk, heavy or even ""vuiton-style"" if that's what you usually wear so don't over think it to much, but avoid sandals with socks there are lots of puns about foreigners and those, dreads are perfectly fine specially around the center of the city (where the medieval part is and the bullfighting plaza) its also the hangout/shopping area.  Make sure to have your ""i want sun cream"" sentence  of choice prepared beforehand.   Also be ready to be taught the ""bad words"" first, making a foreigner say ""butt"" is a local...entertainment i guess, we do that a lot for some stupid reason.  Bring a gift to your host family from the USA, food or something that is obvious from there, is not mandatory but is a nice gesture that is apreciated anywhere.  There is a dialect in this area, you will find that some sings are in spanish and a spanish-ishthing-close-to-catalan but isn't really used when speaking around here won't be a problem, but if you don't find an specific word in  a spanish-english dictionary ask if it is valenciano.  And the subway here is a safe, clean, cheap public transportation so get a ""bonometro"" and ask for a map of the lines ( metrovalencia.es ).  PD.You will love our river that is actually a big garden! :D"

spain,34vd3p,SuperTararot,1 point,Mon May 4 23:33:24 2015 UTC,"No specifics, but how to act and cultural taboos. I want to give a good impression to my host family. I know the basics but I'm worried about the tiny stuff, like how to dress or any specific phrases to use or avoid. In the States I don't necessarily fit in (off the bat I have dreads that give off some negative stereotypes). I just want to put my best foot forward and not be looked at poorly, with little shot of redemption due to the language barrier."
spain,34vd3p,SuperTararot,3,Tue May 5 01:49:01 2015 UTC,"Well, I think you are worried in excess. In valencia you can find all kind of people, we are not a conservative city (maybe with the exception of the rich neighbourhoods, but there are only a few). Definitely with the young people you should have no problem. I know a lot of people with dreads, or me, for instance, I'm also young and I shave my head and I wear beard, so for the ""non stereotypical looks"" you shouldn't be worried, because are not strange at all. You just need to be polite with the people and the people will be polite with you.   The only think that can be weird for you is that in Spain we tend to get closer to the people and to speak louder than in other countries, what can look weird for them. For example, is normal to give two kisses on the cheeks for greeting people. Spain is a very emotional country.  And about taboos, well, Valencia is a big city, I don't think you will find any difference with any touristic city in United States, we have a lot of tourists, so there is a quite intercultural atmosphere. If you go to a host family they will be very open minded people as they must be used to deal with foreigners. :)"

spain,34uneh,CrimsonBrit,6,Mon May 4 18:27:55 2015 UTC,"So here's my take. Lived here for about four years now. Married a Granada girl (I'm American) and have gone very very deep into the culture. As per your question it's almost impossible to respond. Can you get me some more specific questions? My father-in-law is a genius and talks to me very frequently about the pride of his identity. Most notably is that the Andalusian person is deep in history. Really, if you think about it, Spain is ancient!!! Malaga, one of the oldest settlements of the Phoenicians has seen an incredible amount of change in cultures. Phoenician to the Carthaginians to celts to Romans to Visigoths to Byzantium to Muslims to the warring states that one could argue came from all over Europe and now the modern Andalusian. Granted you need to do your research because this shit I'm giving you is broad.   But throughout medieval history after the re conquest you get a feel for the people. They are poor, uneducated, and agricultural. In comparison to the rest of Spain it was not as industrialized. Today is say they are a proud people of their heritage. Hard working (contrary to common belief) and a bit uneducated. The warm climate definitely calls fourth a unique breed of people from all over Spain. But again, without some more specifics I can't go into details.   I can help with much more specific questions."
spain,34uneh,Kierkagaurd,2,Mon May 4 19:22:11 2015 UTC,"They are poor, uneducated, and agricultural. In comparison to the rest of Spain it was not as industrialized.   Uh... not really. Galicia, Extremadura and parts of Castilla la Mancha and Castilla y Leon have historically been poor and mainly agricultural, and the whole of Spain has had a rather poorly record regarding literacy rates and education. Spain was considered a developing country until the 80's and had the same rent per capita as our neighbour Morocco when we entered the EU in 1985...  There is however a feature that is pretty specific to Andalucia, the cortijo culture:  http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortijo of which the Duquesa de Alba is the most egregious example. It permeates Andalucian society to this day, and although I don't think it's the only reason, I suspect it has a lot of weight on the fact that Andaluces are by far the most classicist people in Spain - most Spaniards are classicist and worry a lot about el que diran but the level of this in Andalucia is surprising even for us fellow Spaniards."
spain,34uneh,InsertFancyName,1 point,Mon May 4 21:18:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response! In all honesty, I don't currently have any specific questions, purely because I know I've picked a very vague and broad subject (sort of helps with the 6-7 page requirement). I'm currently studying in Granada, and have traveled all around the region (the cities I've mentioned), and sort of want to identify a collective identity which the Andalucian culture can say is theirs.   Currently, I have my essay structured as follows:   The history of Andalucia/Al-Andaluz. So I'll do a history of the relgions and influences in the area, as you mentioned.  Then I'll discuss the customs, lifestyle, food, music from the area. That's when I'll talk about the local governement and show the rich culture by mentioning famous artists (painters, writers, filmmakers, etc.) And I'll wrap it up with my own observations and experiences over the last six months or so.    I'll be honest, I'm not so sure what sort of answer I was expecting, however, I'm really glad with your response.   I guess my question is: what makes Andalucia, Andalucia?"
spain,34uneh,Kierkagaurd,3,Mon May 4 19:52:19 2015 UTC,"After watching that again it made me realize that andalucia, and arguably Spain, is a land of paradox. Deeply catholic but few practices.

spain,34uneh,sweetleef,2,Mon May 4 22:11:16 2015 UTC,"You could go on for hours on this subject and I think all viewpoints would be valid especially about so much pride in a culture that no one else really cares too much about. Religion being the other aspect already mentioned here that so much belief in something that now one practices, of course that can be said about many cultures and religions. My main observation is the amount of corruption that is currently going on in Spain and seems to me has been going on since time began. This idea of ""I'm in charge I can take what I want"" or the ""as long as I get mine then screw the rest"" attitude is what I think defines the Andalusian and Spanish culture in general. Spaniards and Andalusian in general are very generous people, organ donation surpass almost all other countries in the world, the ones that have the least tend to be the ones that give the most in charitable concerns, the ones that have the most don't seem to mind sharing it with their peers either, rich keep getting richer and the poor, poorer.

And it extends to many aspects of society, from taxes and corruption to education to parking to construction - take whatever you can, with as little work as possible, and let the pringado pick up the tab.  The Teutonic/Scandanavian concept of doing something well for the sake of doing it well, or acting a certain way simply because it is the right thing to do, doesn't quite resonate.    Sure, you may do the right thing because the boss threatens you, or because the teacher is grading you, or because people are watching - but sacrificing and going the extra mile simply out of a sense of obligation to do the best you can is an idea more likely to be met with mockery and derision than praise."

spain,34t585,davidpardo,2,Mon May 4 12:08:01 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, Ive tried that already. They were unable to help because of ""security protocol""."
spain,34t585,elrohir_ancalin,7,Mon May 4 14:11:39 2015 UTC,"If the flight was purchased jointly with the same company or a partner with presenence in Barajas, she can get a boarding pass printed on a quiosk without leaving the layover area. Air Europa and Iberia also have check-in desks inside the area of international  arrivals, so she may not need to go out and in again to check in her baggage again. I can't help with the warning in Madrid, but I live in Vigo so if everything else goes sour and she arrives here without her stuff let me know if I can help."
spain,34t585,elrohir_ancalin,2,Mon May 4 13:51:14 2015 UTC,"My moms flight supposedly just landed a few minutes ago. Her hotel is about 15 minutes away. If I don't hear from her within the next hour, would you be able to drive by and see if she's just waiting at the hotel please? I'd hate to think she's just sitting there because she doesn't know where to go."
spain,34t585,elrohir_ancalin,2,Mon May 4 14:14:33 2015 UTC,"I'm currently at work, but I can drive by in about 2 hours.  You may want to consider Skype calling the hotel too. Let me know if she doesn't reach out and I'll try to give a hand."
spain,34t585,ax0ne,3,Mon May 4 14:19:32 2015 UTC,I managed to get a super helpful employee at the hotel she's staying at! They went to find her and pick her up even though the hotel doesn't usually offer that service. Thank you!
spain,34t585,realblade,1 point,Mon May 4 17:57:31 2015 UTC,I'm glad everything was resolved. Tell her I'm sorry for our weather today :)
spain,34t585,elrohir_ancalin,2,Mon May 4 19:13:25 2015 UTC,"The luggage does not travel on without the passenger. Not since 2001, I think. So if she didn't get the connection it is still in Madrid with her.   Also, if she is checked in already they will call for her. Because for the company she is on the flight. Doesn't matter if she has a ticket or not. Maybe she hears it and goes to the boarding gate in time.   If you give us more information about the flight I can tell you more. About luggage and such.   Source : Work for airline"
spain,34t585,peluzza,1 point,Mon May 4 16:02:12 2015 UTC,"Were the flights bought separately or is it a layover? If they were separate, the luggage will not leave Madrid as it's supposed to be checked in again. If it's just a layover, the baggage will be waiting for her in Vigo, no matter if she checked in or not in Madrid.  Also do what davidpardo recommended and tell her what happened. They will call for her on the interphone and will guide her throught the process.  Good luck and please let us know if everything went fine."

It's also pretty touristy and developed but less busy. Plus beautiful beaches. If you can manage to take a trip out to Mallorca there are some good spots there, specifically around Soller.  Edit: I forgot Olot/La Garrotxa. It's kind of hard to find the right spots around there but there's definitely good stuff up there and it's not too far out of BCN"

spain,34k8fs,BerbFatmann,3,Fri May 1 21:40:50 2015 UTC,"I've checked for you and it seems that's correct, simply there isn't any train doing that route on Saturdays. I suspect the logic behind this being that the government wants to boots the high-speed trains (AVE) and eventually tear down the Tren Hotel network, of which there are already less and less.  I'd recommend you to try and do the trip the day before or after if you can. You see, there're several AVE trains connecting Valencia to Madrid in about an hour and a half and from Madrid is about 4 hours to Granada. But they're working on the line so you'll have to transfer to a bus for part of your trip -while paying full AVE fare, of course."
spain,34k8fs,InsertFancyName,1 point,Sat May 2 08:51:32 2015 UTC,"It's actually faster to go yo granada by Bus than by train. I went by train during christmas and It took easily around 5 hours (since the train goes all the way to Antequera before changing tracka towards Granada), and the trains were still reaching the station. I'd suppose it's even slower now.  And alsa premium buses are almost the same fare as a train ticket."
spain,34k8fs,thatmeanitguy,1 point,Sat May 2 10:56:10 2015 UTC,granada - antequera is closed due to works for the next ¿two? months.

spain,34k8fs,thatmeanitguy,1 point,Sat May 2 11:11:57 2015 UTC,you take a bus in the train station and drop you off in the train station of your destination.
spain,34k8fs,alex_pg,1 point,Sat May 2 11:38:42 2015 UTC,So you go by bus from antequera to granada? That must take ages.  Thanks for the info.

spain,34j12v,fancyHODOR,1 point,Fri May 1 15:50:19 2015 UTC,"I would recommend that you  look into Yoigo. They provide good service in Metro areas with prepaid SIM cards. I doubt that you can get data only, but Yoigo only charges for what you use, so if you don't use text messages, you don't pay."
spain,34j12v,Random_burst,1 point,Fri May 1 16:09:03 2015 UTC,"Do you need a credit card to do that?  I was hoping to get something I could just load up on in euros on hand, but if that's not an option, the pay-as-you-go option may be good.  Does Yoigo provide LTE?"
spain,34j12v,anarchos,3,Fri May 1 17:06:15 2015 UTC,I'm in Spain at the moment and use Yoigo.  No credit card required.  It costs €6 (€7.26 with tax) for 600mb of data and then €2 per 200mb after that.  You can call people too for like €0.03 plus €0.20 connection fee or something like that (I never call anyone).  SIM card was free too.  I bought €25 in credit and they give you €30 worth.  Not sure if that was the minimum credit you had to buy or not...my Spanish no es bueno! My phone doesn't support yoigos LTE frequency but I am constantly on HSDPA (3.5g) and its very quick.
spain,34j12v,Random_burst,1 point,Sat May 2 08:26:51 2015 UTC,"You can pay in cash but will need your passport for Identification. Every town of size has at least one Yoigo store. You will have what ever the speed that is the norm in that area. Also, WiFi is common and most public places have (restaurants, bars, cafeterias, etc.)"
spain,34j12v,virica,1 point,Fri May 1 18:07:38 2015 UTC,Just here to confirm that every phone needs to be registered as soon as you sign up now and you will be required for your passport.  Its a security measure to try to reduce the amount of scammers(there are some telephone based scams in Spain and keeping track of them helps finding out who is to blame whenever possible(hidden under faceless companies most of the times))/terrorist attacks that use cellphones
spain,34j12v,Uinta,1 point,Fri May 1 21:19:35 2015 UTC,"There is a wiki dedicated to this: http://prepaid-data-sim-card.wikia.com/wiki/Spain. It looks like you can go to an Orange store, get a ""Mundo"" sim for 10 euros, you will then get another 5 euros on the card for free from a promotion. Then you can purchase a data feature pack at .5, 1, or 2 GB. I will be in Spain shortly. My plan is to do this and get (2X) the 2GB plan. Total cost is 30 euro but you get 10 euro in promotion so 20 euro for 4GB....at least that how I read it."
