It's been a while since I picked out all my graphical mods, so I don't remember everything, but here'r (at least some of) the relevant ones:    Skyrim Shaders 2015 ELFX + Enhancer Rustic Clutter Collection Rugnarok   I just switched to Vividian ENB. I hadn't tried it before because of its needlessly complicated install process, and I regret that. It does an amazing job at lighting different weathers, much better than other weather-focused ENBs like NLA or PureVision (both of which I've tried) and its subsurface scattering is perfect (I've been struggling mightily with that in other ENBs - people tended to be too red and glow too much, or too pale and glow too much. In Vividian they all look pretty good).   My framing's a bit off in the screenshot because Al'Hassan kept bumping me.   Depth of field is turned off. I have one with it turned on, but due to Al'Hassan being an idiot it's all out of focus."

SkyrimPorn,3da86w,Grunt-MK2,2,Wed Jul 15 07:55:31 2015 UTC,"You're welcome. Also, I've been experimenting with the letterbox resolution, (2.35:1), and I'm liking it so far. I've kind of been going for your style of screenshots and I would like to know what you think of my recent screenshots: https://www.flickr.com/photos/129974068@N03/  I can't really get character shots to look as good as I'd like them to. Do you have any tips on screenshotting characters? Including mods for characters. I'm using CBBE right now, should I switch to UNP?"
SkyrimPorn,3da86w,Zook024,2,Wed Jul 15 08:17:14 2015 UTC,"I like 'em! You've nailing the FOV on your latest shots.   I can only tell you my own cheat sheet for character portrait shots (not that I am any good at it).  For portraits,  Low FOV. try 25-35. The idea is to minimise the edge distortion caused by higher FOVs. Most of the time it is always about what I want to 'hide' rather than what I want to show. Edge distortion is A BIG distraction for me personally.   Positioning of your object can change the feel of the shots. I use dead centre character position to convey stillness. It helps viewes o focus more on the figure and its' detail.   While an off centre positioning was meant to convey movement, as though it is part of a moving scene/a movie.  Expressions and subtle posing. The whole idea is to avoid mannequin like appearance. start a conversation with an NPC and quit the conversation straight away, most of the time the NPC will still be yapping away. That is your moment.   Even if the character is expressionless, a subtle body tilting can help to make them look a lot less stiff. Same trick, talk to them and they will usually start fidgeting around.   Try out different things, I was surprised with how easy it was to do character shots in monochrome or go mental with your DOF to really highlight a detail (if you have high res textures installed).   1 Thing I love to mimic is mass effect's cutscene. They pan the camera soo close to the NPC, you feel that they are in front of you (1st person) and talking to you or doing things in front of you directly.   sample  sample  sample  sample  Don't be hesitant to get right in front of them.  A few of my shots turned out okay using this principle.  like this  and this"

SkyrimPorn,3d7hpb,AnoK760,3,Tue Jul 14 12:26:27 2015 UTC,Yeah it's not so bad. You can always reduce the grass density in the Ini settings but I do think it looks best at 50 as recommended. I think the physics of grass in skyrim relies on CPU a lot though because my CPU fan starts going crazy with grass mods installed.

SkyrimPorn,3d4mea,kontankarite,5,Mon Jul 13 14:11:07 2015 UTC,"I've got this mod.  Running at grasssize 75 and 512 textures.  I'll make the argument that visually, one shouldn't even bother going much higher than that unless you just want to take hi res up close screenshots of grass.  I haven't entirely made my mind up as to weather I like it or not."
SkyrimPorn,3d4mea,kontankarite,2,Mon Jul 13 19:29:45 2015 UTC,I'm using the ultra version (2048? I'm not sure the res) at iMinGrassSize=20. I think it looks great and I prefer it over Verdant. I really like the flowers it adds. Also in forests and such I think the diversity of grass types is much greater than in Verdant which in my opinion is a good thing.

SkyrimPorn,3d4mea,redditsuckmyballs,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:12:46 2015 UTC,Yeah I was never one for verdant. This mod seems like a good middle ground between Grass Field (extreme density) and Verdant (variety). I definitely think it beats both of those way out of the park.
SkyrimPorn,3d4mea,redditsuckmyballs,2,Tue Jul 14 00:42:52 2015 UTC,"Verdant was my favorite one for a bit, but I never really tried out many more grass mods, I just thought it was good enough for me at the time"
SkyrimPorn,3d4mea,ThQmas,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:46:41 2015 UTC,I've only used Grass Field and Verdant. I settled with Verdant until this mod was uploaded (I had never heard of the original Unbelievable Grass). Grass Field I think looks really good in some places and I love how dense it is but Verdant has tons of variety and diversity and changes grass types depending on location so I felt it was a much better option. It was my favorite grass mod for a while.

The low res version actually looks really good and I was using it for a while. I decided I should try to test my limits so I installed the ultra version and it runs great!  Edit: Forgot to mention, there are 3 versions. Low, high, and ultra. I believe ultra just increases density. Low is 512x512 and high and ultra are combos of 1k and 2k. If you're looking for a good middle ground try out the high version. I personally haven't used it myself but I'm assuming it just looks like ultra but with lower density."

I went for this type of ENB but in the end all the other weather types just don't fit and night time is hard to achieve. Anyone who still wants to experience something like this try Tamu's enb or maybe Dahakas. It's as close as you can get to this type of ENB that people replicate. I think most people who go through all the hard work of remaking unr3als work just want to keep that kind of work to themselves, sharing it wouldn't make it ""theirs"" anymore and most of the community isn't that literate with ENB anyway.

SkyrimPorn,3cx7cy,fadingsignal,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:46:06 2015 UTC,The guy with the glass sword? That's Orcish Armor.
SkyrimPorn,3cx7cy,electric_eclectic,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:58:29 2015 UTC,"Oh nice, been a while since I've seen it, I think the mask goes so well that it made the whole armor look different!"
SkyrimPorn,3czdgb,-SUSHi-,2,Sun Jul 12 04:03:41 2015 UTC,Now that this is out I don't have to go outside anymore.
SkyrimPorn,3cwiu3,Nxcromancer,2,Sat Jul 11 11:13:34 2015 UTC,"I love the second screenshot, reminds me of Farcry 4"
SkyrimPorn,3cwiu3,Syline,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:19:11 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean, the colours on my monitor are quite washed out as its old, looks a lot less vivid to me, viewed on my phone I understand what you meant though!"
SkyrimPorn,3cwiu3,step47,2,Sat Jul 11 17:08:00 2015 UTC,Nice meme friend

SkyrimPorn,3cwiu3,Cilogy,2,Sat Jul 11 15:17:39 2015 UTC,"no, thank you for the info"
SkyrimPorn,3cv0uw,AlphaPot,3,Sat Jul 11 00:24:05 2015 UTC,"Also got a version in colour, for anyone interested."

SkyrimPorn,3cvhn0,taprosoft,2,Sat Jul 11 02:58:00 2015 UTC,Which mod did you use for the grass ? It looks awesome !
SkyrimPorn,3cvhn0,SirOttington,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:04:49 2015 UTC,What enb is this??
SkyrimPorn,3cuztc,seneschall-,4,Sat Jul 11 00:14:48 2015 UTC,"Oh dear. Now you've started modding, you won't be able to stop!"
SkyrimPorn,3cuztc,skrilly01,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:21:49 2015 UTC,Looking good man!  Now slap an ENB and a few textures her and there on and you'll be a pro in no time
SkyrimPorn,3ctxnp,-SUSHi-,2,Fri Jul 10 19:18:25 2015 UTC,"Very nice looking, reminds me of AOST (unreal guy) enb that he wont release.  Can you upload your modlist? I really want to know some of that grass + texture."
SkyrimPorn,3ctxnp,battler624,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:04:09 2015 UTC,I think ENB author based it off of Unreal.
SkyrimPorn,3ctxnp,TheDrDocter,3,Sat Jul 11 00:37:36 2015 UTC,"Uhhh, at least compare apples with apples  fuji apple, meet fuji apple  Red Delicious, meet Red Delicious  Pink Lady, meet Pink Lady  Machok (author of the DN enb) openly stated that this enb is inspired by unreal's enb. He was INSPIRED by unreal's work. He likes unreal's works.   This is not a negative thing. It allows people to try mimicking unreal's shots if they want to, BUT It's not gonna create another unreal or cheapen his works.  I know you are capable of artistically breaking down a scene. I told you I like your screens, I can see that they are well thought out. I know that you know your shit. You are kidding yourself if you say that the elements between those 2 are not remotely similar. The fanboyism needs to be tuned down %1 (or %0.1)"
SkyrimPorn,3ctxnp,Grunt-MK2,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:14:00 2015 UTC,"haha , did you try Unreal ENB ? I think no, so how to really know how Unreal ENB is ? You just saw some screenshots, IG that's different :)"
SkyrimPorn,3ctxnp,Laughingoutloud38i,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:41:30 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. If that is your conclusion after trying out the enb, I can't and won't challenge that.   I know my brother had tried the enb and did not like it as well, because he prefers Machok's original Vanilla Ice cream.  To quote him directly, ""Why did he(machok) bother copying THAT(unreal)? His stuff(VIC enb) looks way better.""  Well there you go. same side -but different ends- of the coin. lol.  It's all subjective.  *I am neutral about unreal's enb and Dovah nakiin. I personally prefer full fantasy(Gio's/Fever/TV) or gritty/realism enbs (VIC/whatever this enb is )"
SkyrimPorn,3ctxnp,Grunt-MK2,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:55:29 2015 UTC,"For me ENB is just a relative, there's no such a good or bad ENB so it's depending on how the individual taste. your words are very true, you and your brother likes VIC and not Dovah. Not saying don't like it because this ENB is bad, i appreciate that."
SkyrimPorn,3ctxnp,Machok-Skyrim,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:11:54 2015 UTC,"I didn't say similar, I said it reminds me of it. :/ Also i'm not the one who downvoted you."
SkyrimPorn,3ctxnp,battler624,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:21:05 2015 UTC,"Perhaps not exacty, but definitely something related, the lighting and bloom seem to remind me of Unreal's screens. Although he has been lacking on his ENB progress and been quite dead lateley.  /u/unr3al2004 we ask that you just release whatever ENB you have right now because you don't seem to work on it much."
SkyrimPorn,3ctxnp,TheDrDocter,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:03:36 2015 UTC,"OP, how is performance and your specs?"
SkyrimPorn,3ctxnp,TheDrDocter,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:53:13 2015 UTC,If you use Ultimate Lush Overhaul with high fshadowdistance it will be bad
