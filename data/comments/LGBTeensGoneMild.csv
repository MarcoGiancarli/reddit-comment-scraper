LGBTeensGoneMild,3cwux4,theycallhimlaser,2,Sat Jul 11 13:55:42 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love Orwell! Animal farm was indeed great, but have you read nineteen eighty-four? If you have, I suggest that you also try Aldous Huxley's Brave new world. Both of the dystopian future fictions were masterpieces, but I must say that Huxley predicted nowdays society better than Orwell, seeing that people aren't controlled by this 'big brother' -figure, they are kept happy and obedient by providing them countless new goods and services toforget their misery with.  And also you're cute <3"
LGBTeensGoneMild,3cwux4,The_Amazing_Otaku,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:01:48 2015 UTC,"If you think about it, there is kind of a Bog Brother factor in today's world. With rumors that may or may not be true about government agencies such as the NSA watching us through the cameras on our laptops/phones...etc. I find that Orwell was right with his predictions, but he just had them a little more extreme than they've turned out so far."
LGBTeensGoneMild,3cwux4,FierceFlyFuckMe,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:57:45 2015 UTC,"That's a very good point actually, but let's not forget that there was also a neverending war, chronic lack of goods and strong state-enforced class society in 1984. I believe that Huxleys idea of keeping citizens happy (by giving them more and more goods and luxuries, so they wouldn't notice how empty their lives are), rather than opressing them is a closer call to modern society than Orwell's Big Brother watching over you, monitoring you whatever you do, ready to erase you.  And also Illuminati doesn't exist, if that's what you're saying"
LGBTeensGoneMild,3cwux4,The_Amazing_Otaku,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:10:09 2015 UTC,"I am not an American, I live in Europe so to me it's pretty sad that in USA the society is even close to that in Orwell's 1984. In my country (Finland) there isn't a neverending war, the western 'propaganda' about how terrorism can be stopped with blowing some countries up isn't widely believed in here. There isn't a culture of hating foreign countries. If the government makes mistakes, we focus our hate on them, not foreign countries.  Education is free here so even people with poor backrounds can get a good quality education, so social mobility is a no-brainer. Also Finland has very high taxes and a wide welfare and social pension system, so the state actually prevents class-society.  There isn't a NSA-type Big Brother here, no one collects information of what citizens do on the internet or on their phones. If I'll ever send a dickpic, it won't be stored on a NSA hard drive.  So what's the conclusion? I myself believe that Huxley was right about the state controlling people by numbing them by providing loads of entertainment, so they wouldn't focuse on the real problems. That is happening in pretty much all of the western countries.  But I think you are right too. The society in USA resembles the one in 1984, and I think that the government in USA has the necessary components to create Orwell's dystopia.  I'm not trying to spread hate about the USA. But I find it shocking that Americans themselves think that they are close to an orwellian dystopia. That's why it makes me glad that I'm not an American.  And if you haven't read brave new world, here's a neat little comic that explains my argument http://www.highexistence.com/amusing-ourselves-to-death-huxley-vs-orwell/"

I was incredibly nervous and because I'm socially awkward I was scared to ask him for one. He heard my friends trying to convince me to go get a picture and noticed that I had a rather obvious crush on him, so he came up behind me and asked if I would take a picture with him. At that point I was freaking out and unsure if he was comfortable with me like putting my arm around him for a picture, but he put his around my shoulders and pulled me in close for the picture. He was a really awesome guy and it made my night!"

LGBTeensGoneMild,39u0bf,eversoslightly767,2,Sun Jun 14 20:38:15 2015 UTC,"My unpopularity stems from not talking to people from anxiety huzzah! And other things. But shh.  I've been told I'm a very cuddly person~  I need to straighten it maybe. That should be done at some point. Possibly.  I feel like talking to me is an elaborate ruse to just use me to cuddle. Which I'm not against, it's just unexpected."
LGBTeensGoneMild,39u0bf,sunwriter,2,Sun Jun 14 20:56:50 2015 UTC,"Overwhelmed with text  I um this is a lot to respond to plus I'm on mobile now so this should be fun.   Firstly, being sentient but without emotion is somewhat like depressive mood disorder which I can tell you is less than ideal, so I think you should skip out on that, Kira.   Secondly, straightening it takes out the aspect of luck in regards to ""will it foof nicely, or no? ;-;""  Cuddle rape is more commonly referred to as harassment. But it would be okay. You can do whatever to me, I don't mind. I'll be fine. Plus, the blushing thing would be reciprocated; I'd be scared to talk to you anyway.   It's not like I have anything interesting to say. Do computers interest you? Robotics? Occasional German speaking?"
