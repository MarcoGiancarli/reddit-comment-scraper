LadyBoners,3e0xg6,natlovespie,128,Tue Jul 21 02:46:10 2015 UTC,A fun fact is that Tom Hardy'd body double and Charlize Theron's body double met on set and got together.
LadyBoners,3e0xg6,jumbosnake,35,Tue Jul 21 06:06:58 2015 UTC,Aw that fact IS fun :)
LadyBoners,3e0xg6,KoaliaBear,23,Tue Jul 21 06:12:02 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah I read about that, but I think it's another one of his stunt doubles."
LadyBoners,3e0xg6,myrrar,12,Tue Jul 21 06:46:27 2015 UTC,It is. It's his rehearsal stunt double and looks nothing like him. Still a cute story though.  https://twitter.com/Daynastunts/status/600985850323738624/photo/1

LadyBoners,3e0xg6,lindsaychild,48,Tue Jul 21 05:38:47 2015 UTC,"Is that Tom Hardy on the left? Shit, I didn't think they came any hotter than him... and then his body double came along."
LadyBoners,3e0xg6,SunPanda11,7,Tue Jul 21 05:11:36 2015 UTC,"I couldn't tell either, had to ask the husband, I picked the guy on the right because he had a nicer nose!"

LadyBoners,3e0xg6,PolarBearIcePop,3,Tue Jul 21 10:32:52 2015 UTC,His body double could also easily stand in for Juventus footballer Claudio Marchisio.

LadyBoners,3e0xg6,dangerous_beans,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:38:54 2015 UTC,Thud.
LadyBoners,3e0xg6,andrejevas,-12,Tue Jul 21 16:41:23 2015 UTC,Tom Hardy is my number one but the fact the he doesn't do all his own stunts kinda subtracts from his man points.
LadyBoners,3e0xg6,ihearthorses,17,Tue Jul 21 18:01:29 2015 UTC,"Studios, and most directors and producers, would never permit a (lead) actor to perform their own stunts, even if they are physically fit, or like to brag about it on TV shows.  It would be a financial and logistical nightmare if you had to stop production for 2 months because your lead actor broke his leg 'for man points'. Insurance companies would never agree either, in fact, before production even starts, they take a very, very close look at every shot, every scene, and make mandatory requirements to ensure the safety of those actors.   Not to mention the PR disaster, not to mention that being an actor and being a stunt man are two very different professions for a reason."
LadyBoners,3e0xg6,clairvoyantpsychic,5,Tue Jul 21 08:54:30 2015 UTC,"Jackie Chan insists on doing his own stunts, and his films are basically uninsurable because of it. I think he ends up paying out of pocket for the crew's medical bills for that reason."

LadyBoners,3e277s,_Panela_,2,Tue Jul 21 11:38:29 2015 UTC,Oh yes!! Loved him in Mr. Nobody! <3
LadyBoners,3dy4o7,AnnaBare,100,Mon Jul 20 14:14:42 2015 UTC,Love that chewing gum face. But honestly it's his raw confidence and brutal honesty that do it for me.
LadyBoners,3dy4o7,Slobula,26,Mon Jul 20 15:45:27 2015 UTC,"""THIS IS RAW!"" I honestly love it with he starts yelling. It's pretty funny, to me."
LadyBoners,3dy4o7,oliviapwns,77,Mon Jul 20 21:17:15 2015 UTC,He's handsome and funny and kind of a prick. One of my favorite combos :)
LadyBoners,3dy4o7,honored_angel,36,Mon Jul 20 15:52:23 2015 UTC,And the accent!
LadyBoners,3dy4o7,starbunnie,10,Mon Jul 20 16:25:15 2015 UTC,Of course!
LadyBoners,3dy4o7,honored_angel,16,Mon Jul 20 19:19:02 2015 UTC,But he's generally a prick for the right reasons which makes it the best.
LadyBoners,3dy4o7,Facenoms,8,Tue Jul 21 00:44:53 2015 UTC,Exactly! His brutal honesty is refreshing. So many people don't say what they think on the off chance they might offend someone.
LadyBoners,3dy4o7,honored_angel,6,Tue Jul 21 02:28:59 2015 UTC,Kinda like House.. But cooking instead of doctoring
LadyBoners,3dy4o7,the_honest_liar,4,Tue Jul 21 03:44:56 2015 UTC,"You ever see that vid of him cooking with kids? He's SO sweet when he needs to be. He's really only a prick on kitchen nightmares when he thinks the cooking staff are scamming their employers, or when people are a prick to him. Idk about his other shows, but I'd smash."
LadyBoners,3dy4o7,gurgleface,3,Tue Jul 21 03:58:45 2015 UTC,I've seen some video with him and his kids. He seems like a really good dad :)
LadyBoners,3dy4o7,honored_angel,50,Tue Jul 21 06:01:13 2015 UTC,I mean you just know he would whisper incredibly filthy things to you during .... /sigh/
LadyBoners,3dy4o7,Isle_Girl,41,Mon Jul 20 19:02:47 2015 UTC,You kind of reminded me of this. Possibly the closest we'll ever get to hearing him talk dirty.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwnrWzgUP2w

LadyBoners,3dy4o7,mpt6872,7,Mon Jul 20 16:31:04 2015 UTC,I'd imagine he'd be an amazing Dom. 😇
LadyBoners,3dy4o7,trollocs_and_daleks,6,Mon Jul 20 21:53:08 2015 UTC,He'd fuck you and then make you a stunning beef wellington after.

LadyBoners,3dy4o7,Levin1983,2,Tue Jul 21 00:39:26 2015 UTC,Same. Now I'm just wondering if anyone has any fanfiction of this on tumblr.
LadyBoners,3dy4o7,ChestyLarue_6,4,Tue Jul 21 00:47:22 2015 UTC,I haven't seen any of his shows where he's a dick to people. I did see that famous Kitchen Nightmares episode though and after seeing how hard he tried to help those people and how polite but honest he was with them I really gained a lot of respect for him. I also saw his AMA here on Reddit and he went out of the way to answer questions with more effort than a ton of other people doing AMAs have. He even offered a job to a down on his luck and in hard times cook who needed a job. Overall he seems like a great guy!
LadyBoners,3dy4o7,ungreatful81,4,Mon Jul 20 20:49:39 2015 UTC,I didn't until I saw him filet a fish.

LadyBoners,3dnehi,violettheory,46,Fri Jul 17 20:14:19 2015 UTC,"He got it in a barfight, apparently. I love how no director wants to cover it up when he's acting, it just adds to how badass his characters are."
LadyBoners,3dnehi,GlobindobinButler,30,Fri Jul 17 20:18:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he'll never play a character where the eyebrow scar wouldn't be believable. I mean with Drogo that just made it so they had one less fake scar to put on him."

LadyBoners,3dnehi,bunsnroses,10,Fri Jul 17 22:16:03 2015 UTC,He kept wearing a terrible Johnny Dep hat at the con I was at. It made me sad. I'm bet he's tired of being solicited and he's ACTIVELY trying to look less hot.

LadyBoners,3d8flt,danimalxX,7,Tue Jul 14 15:19:17 2015 UTC,"Damn it, I have a job to go! Showers to take! Cats to feed!"
LadyBoners,3d8flt,cheeses_greist,14,Tue Jul 14 18:05:13 2015 UTC,His lips are scrumptious.
LadyBoners,3d8flt,moistpantyhose,13,Tue Jul 14 15:26:40 2015 UTC,Yep.  Him and Idris Elba are top Lady Boners in cocainelady's mind.
LadyBoners,3d8flt,cocainelady,8,Tue Jul 14 14:28:08 2015 UTC,I second that.
LadyBoners,3d8flt,Passionix,12,Tue Jul 14 15:11:02 2015 UTC,The puppy is doing his best Tom Hardy face.
LadyBoners,3d8flt,Luna_C,13,Tue Jul 14 15:25:05 2015 UTC,He has an obsession with dogs. If I wasn't on mobile I'd post the video of an interview he was doing for Inception and he had a dog with him and the interviewer told him to please pay attention and Tom went OFF. He is an angel.
LadyBoners,3d8flt,princessnubz,8,Tue Jul 14 17:30:53 2015 UTC,"My friend works in a no-kill Shelter in London, and he came in last week! He told her he's obsessed with dogs. She said he was super nice and wished her luck on her job interview that day (at the same place - she got the job)."
LadyBoners,3d8flt,hailingburningbones,6,Tue Jul 14 20:54:08 2015 UTC,He claims he wants to open a shelter of his own. Id volunteer there...often.
LadyBoners,3d8flt,princessnubz,6,Tue Jul 14 21:11:44 2015 UTC,Omg. Tom Hardy and a puppy. So effing cute.
LadyBoners,3d8flt,dazlr,5,Tue Jul 14 14:43:57 2015 UTC,Every time I see this man he's finding a new way to make me fall in love with him. It's not fair; I have no hope.
LadyBoners,3d8flt,dorothy_zbornak_esq,3,Tue Jul 14 16:06:39 2015 UTC,"I fell in love with him when he played Shinzon, Picards clone in Star Trek: Nemesis"
LadyBoners,3d8flt,MAXMEEKO,3,Wed Jul 15 01:10:03 2015 UTC,"Never been a fan of Tom Hardy, but this... this I upvoted... Maybe it's the puppy?..."
LadyBoners,3d8flt,FallingFly,3,Tue Jul 14 20:00:53 2015 UTC,"So I've been noticing this more and more, but has he changed his name to Tom Friggin (Freakin, Fuckin, etc.) Hardy? Cause lately this is how everyone refers to him...and it's damn fun to say. He should really think about making it official."
LadyBoners,3d8flt,Goobernacula,2,Tue Jul 14 22:34:38 2015 UTC,"mine too, good taste sis"
LadyBoners,3d8flt,mama-cass,-10,Fri Jul 17 16:00:58 2015 UTC,Alright alright alright ladies how about some variety on LB /whine
LadyBoners,3d8flt,crescendolls,-4,Tue Jul 14 15:06:16 2015 UTC,too womanly
LadyBoners,3dcbmf,daintydoe,11,Wed Jul 15 03:56:38 2015 UTC,"Thank goodness, I am not the only one. All I could think when he said ""I'm just gonna hurt you really really bad."" was ""please?"""
LadyBoners,3dcbmf,fitmama_meg,2,Wed Jul 15 12:52:15 2015 UTC,Same haha
LadyBoners,3dcbmf,Semiramis42,5,Wed Jul 15 16:18:23 2015 UTC,"Same here. I really thought I was alone in this .... and the fact that there's still so few of us is really unsettling. :( I never really had a big crush on Leto and I have no clown fetishes whatsoever, but this Joker is just ... not particularly attractive, but ladyboner material nonetheless O.o"
LadyBoners,3dcbmf,Semiramis42,3,Thu Jul 16 15:47:28 2015 UTC,"I don't get it! Guys can get a boner for Harley Quinn and nobody bats an eye. But yeah, absolutely no clown fetishes here. I sorta have a crush on Leto, but it's more of whenever he pops up I'm like ""Damn, he's still hot."" haha. There's just something.. exciting about this Joker? It's hard to put a finger on."
LadyBoners,3dcbmf,Semiramis42,3,Thu Jul 16 16:04:44 2015 UTC,"Although I do have to admit, no matter how ugly they try to make him with make up, Jared's good looks do bleed in at least a little bit."
LadyBoners,3dcbmf,crescendolls,3,Thu Jul 16 16:18:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, though they did manage to make Heath ugly. They made his skin look bad, which they didn't do with Leto. That helps."
LadyBoners,3dcbmf,MsCitizenKane,5,Thu Jul 16 16:22:24 2015 UTC,They took a different approach with Ledger. He had a little bit of a hunch and the suit he was wearing was ill-fitting and did nothing to accentuate Ledger's physique.
LadyBoners,3dcbmf,Mowgliinflares,5,Thu Jul 16 16:30:33 2015 UTC,Lol fuck no
LadyBoners,3d8y2g,onebrokegurl,13,Tue Jul 14 12:48:10 2015 UTC,This man can make me do anything. So sexy
LadyBoners,3d8y2g,Marriedtohiccup,11,Tue Jul 14 15:54:52 2015 UTC,I must say he is very handsome and his voice alone sends shivers down my spine
LadyBoners,3d8y2g,ooaalex01,8,Wed Jul 15 01:32:56 2015 UTC,"Da Dinkles is my jam, my jelly, my peanut butter, and my peanuts."
LadyBoners,3d8y2g,ladydece,2,Tue Jul 14 19:28:58 2015 UTC,Dinkles is MY SHIIIIITTT!!
LadyBoners,3d8y2g,NoCommentsYaDingus,6,Tue Jul 14 23:32:35 2015 UTC,You should watch him in Death at a Funeral (either the British or American versions). He is hilarious and positively delightful in both movies. He's the only character that essentially reprised his role.
LadyBoners,3d8y2g,ChickenChic,5,Tue Jul 14 23:48:01 2015 UTC,such a handsome dude
LadyBoners,3d8y2g,yogabagaba03,5,Tue Jul 14 23:44:33 2015 UTC,I started crushing after In Bruges and then again when he was briefly on 30 Rock. God he was sexy as Liz Lemon's date.
LadyBoners,3d8y2g,TrixieSweetwood,12,Tue Jul 14 19:03:15 2015 UTC,"Peter Dinklage wasn't in In Bruges. The actor's name in that is Jordan Prentice. Great movie, though."
LadyBoners,3d8y2g,night_cheese123,3,Tue Jul 14 20:01:22 2015 UTC,You are totally right. I wonder why I thought it was Peter Dinklage.
LadyBoners,3d8y2g,TrixieSweetwood,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:04:33 2015 UTC,"Oh, that was back when I didn't know him yet, need to watch that again!"
LadyBoners,3d8y2g,crescendolls,2,Tue Jul 14 19:15:55 2015 UTC,"So you've seen his appearances on nip/tuck then, right? I'm sure you'd like it"
LadyBoners,3d8y2g,CaitlinSarah87,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:06:02 2015 UTC,I haven't! :O  I'm going back and forth if I want to start watching that show..
LadyBoners,3d8y2g,pimpernelle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:22:09 2015 UTC,That's where I first got my little crush on him :3
LadyBoners,3d8y2g,Hyrrokin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:52:12 2015 UTC,"Fantastic voice and pretty fantastic presence, in general. Love him as Tyrion in GoT."
LadyBoners,3d8sci,PolarBearIcePop,32,Tue Jul 14 11:50:37 2015 UTC,That's a pretty good PhotoShop. The body is Neil Patrick Harris.  It confused me at first!
LadyBoners,3d8sci,MrsSaffronReynolds,10,Tue Jul 14 15:39:04 2015 UTC,"Damn, ive been hoodwinked"
LadyBoners,3d8sci,MrsSaffronReynolds,2,Tue Jul 14 15:43:01 2015 UTC,"It is clever, though.  :)"
LadyBoners,3d8sci,cosmicberryfairypie,3,Tue Jul 14 16:28:51 2015 UTC,Whew thank you for clearing this up.  I thought it was the other way around and was going to be sad.
LadyBoners,3d8sci,giulynia,5,Wed Jul 15 00:04:55 2015 UTC,there's a GIANT snake coming out of his pants.
LadyBoners,3d8sci,allygatorroxsox,3,Tue Jul 14 14:45:31 2015 UTC,ProudSlytherin
LadyBoners,3d8sci,sobromantic,3,Tue Jul 14 14:35:43 2015 UTC,Now that's what I call a trouser snake.
LadyBoners,3d8sci,keylimepie311,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:00:01 2015 UTC,"Wow, this is beautiful"
LadyBoners,3da6a2,swimfan86,10,Tue Jul 14 18:20:31 2015 UTC,He's got the Johnny Depp look executed.
