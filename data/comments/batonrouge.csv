batonrouge,3e4t35,GarethBrendan,2,Wed Jul 22 02:39:45 2015 UTC,"I know the proprietors of Baton Rouge Air through a friend, and my day job. I like them as a customer, they are regularly easy to deal with and understanding of real life.  I called them out to service two 40-year old exchangers. Their technician was honest and hard-working. Part of the service was to remove and clean the inside blower, drip pan, coils, etc.   The unit was built into the walls. Kid spent hours trying to get it out. On the phone with his peers, asking for advice. I told him to take a break and go service the unit next door. Had that one done in half an hour.  I like to think that I also understand real life, so I told him that it's okay if he just cleans as much as he can reach - I wasn't in the mood for completely disassembling the exchanger. It's old, who knows what would break while taking it apart.  Anyway, their yearly service schedule, which is $186/unit, covers two inside/outside cleanings, drain clearing, and 10% discount on repairs (whatever that part is worth, meh to me really). And this tech was pretty committed to getting all this done at that flat rate, and would have done it over the course of another few hours if I hadn't told him to just do a ""good enough"" job.  A little background in that a decade ago, I worked a summer and fall for Rebel Heating and Air doing new construction and residential repairs. But, by now they probably have had enough turnover (and aging) that I can't really comment on their service, positive or negative. As you can imagine from the name of the company (and logo), the owning family is/was comprised mainly of good old boys."

I played there for two years and took many-a-girls into a Tiger Stadium at night and MAN did they love it. If you're interested here is what you do. First it can't be TOO late anytime before midnight is good. You park and walk to where the old dorms under the stadium were, they are occupied by art students and professors mostly now. You continue around, looking for an open door wherever you can find one, or flagging down an art student and they will open the door for you no questions asked. Once you are in, walk all the way to the end of the dorms and you will see a door, get something to prop the door and you're golden! The entire stadium is yours, if you get approached by anyone just say the doors were opened and you thought it was fine to look around.

Bundled cable television is a dying medium and the cable companies know this. If I want one channel, I shouldn't have to pay $13 a month for a bundle of other channels I'll never watch. Not to mention, after you include taxes, fees, leasing and service, a DVR is near 50 a month. Far from the 19 a month they used to advertise. And then you have to pay for a digital package which is near another 40 a month.  Caps are crap and you know it, or work for them. I can't tell which.

If they can manage to bust up a few of the big name contracts (ESPN requiring a huge payout AND inclusion in expanded), they could begin offer tiers of 'Pick 10, Pick 20' etc. So you'd still have to get 10 or 20 channels, but you'd be able to pick them, even if it's from a pool.  Thus I could pick the Sci-Fi & Movies pool, and you could use the Sports & News pools.  I did work for them, and I have a better working knowledge of what goes on.  It's a crap industry from top to bottom, and you won't get change from the cable co's w/o getting change all across the board.

Where you have multiple connections (smart TVs, multiple (3+) computers, tablets, smartphones, consoles, etc.) all on and being used at the same time is where it is beneficial.

They have an ookla speed test.net server set up and they would use that to tell me that everything is ok with my connection. Of course running a speed test hitting their server is going to register full speed because it's technically local.

The issue is normally the size of the pipe on the server you are hitting.  A lot of hosted servers have heavily restricted bandwidth.    ISPs cache a lot of popular content to make it accessible ""locally"" and to minimize congestion on their outbound pipe - I believe you have to use the ISPs DNS servers to take advantage of the caching."

Contracts can state things and you must fulfill you side, unless it's specifically illegal.

Is there a way your can pay a portion to get out of the lease, one of the property management companies that ran an old apartment I lived in would allow that. I never needed to do it, so I am not sure what it would be. But maybe that's an option...  I saved up money on our last apartment and just paid two months of rent on two places, to give me time to move my crap, and to make sure I got the other apart.   Anyway, good luck.."

For a big, juicy and expensive steak dinner that is totaly worth it go to ruths chris' off college drive. For a good true new orleans style poboy on real French bread and the best roast roast beef poboy in the city go to roccos. If you do get the roast beef order it with extra brown graby and gravy ladeled over the top. For a good poboy or sandwich in a local atmospher with a good beer to wash down with it go to Georges under the overpass in Perkins. For great bar good with some local flare and a huge beer selection then try the chimes on coursey. For a nice lunch of jambalaya or gumbo rice and Roux on oniel lane is good.

Chelsea's is a cool spot and the grilled cheese and fried calamari parmesan po boy are always solid options. Street Breads has cool sandwiches if you're just trying to grab a quick/cheap lunch; Po Boy Express is also good for a quick/cheap option. Bistro Byronz has some good stuff as well. Burgersmith or Fat Cow if you want a burger (there are other options but those are my favorites).

Parrains is second choice, also on Perkins, but way on the other end from LL Beer, oysters, good food, loud, good time? Chimes. I prefer Chimes East, on Coursey, but I'm older.  The one on campus is a younger crowd. Great lunch, City Pork.  The Deli on Perkins (closer to Parrains end of perkins) is mostly just the sandwiches.   The Restaurant on Jefferson near Corporate has the same sandwiches, but also a larger menu, of great/eclectic food.  Quieter lunch or dinner, Beausoleil.  Corporate and Jefferson.

(Except the ping pongers.. they'll definitely chat you up!) I'd say if you're looking for friendly people who will definitely talk to you regardless if you're a stranger or not go downtown.  The best place is the Bald Eagle in my opinion.  They'll hook you up with the drinks down there too! And if you can throw some darts.. You're as good as a local.  If you need more excitement though, stop by Lucys or Happys."

Radio Bar and Spanish moon are the hipstery bars but Radio is pretty good for talking to people just because it isnt unbearably loud.  Roux house and Boudreaux and Thibodeauxs are alright too.  Barcadia is pretty cool too. Great burgers and arcade games.  Cove is also really chill. That and Lock and Key are some of the best whiskey bars in town.  Bulldog and Pelican House are some of the better beer bars in the area.  If you like cigars check out Churchills.   If youre close to the Sherwood area check out Londoner.

It's not Chicago, but it's a nice change of pace. You will have no problem making friends because everyone is super nice. I have made quite a few friends from random bar nights.  I would suggest The Cove and Corporate Brew and Draft. They are more chill places to drink and have a more personal experience. Pelican House nearby is fun too, a bit more uptempo.  Bulldog also gets my vote and Roux House downtown."

Also be aware that they just changed their line-up: two members are brand new (ex Corpse Blockade and Legions of Hoar Frost), the drummer is newish (replaced Terry, also used to be in a great band: Hymengaard) but for Barghest specifically the guy you want to talk to is Dallas.  Easiest would be for you to leave contact address, I can forward it to members of these other bands, they'll get in touch if they want to/can. Like /u/chuckscumfuc."

I know it was probably for bankruptcy but I'd love to see an actual report."
batonrouge,3cpwgc,Vonauda,6,Thu Jul 9 23:02:52 2015 UTC,The Tinseltown brand is owned by Cinemark who decided to shut down that theater when they opened a Cinemark branded theater in Perkins Rowe.

The two side entrances and the back entrance are blocked but I was able to just hop the curb around back and drive around.  There are no signs of any kind.  I found that strange.  Usually there are construction company signs and stuff but i found none.   I don't believe there are currently any plans to build anything there yet from reading a few other news articles.  I just hope whatever goes there is something fun and not another car dealership or the like.

batonrouge,3cpwgc,yellowsnow,2,Fri Jul 10 02:12:02 2015 UTC,"It had been. The inside was completely destroyed.  Had squatters and severe water damage. I believe people had actually built fires inside to stay warm. About two years ago an inspection basically said that it was an entire loss and the land was more valuable than the land and building because of the disrepair.  The theatre moved when Perkins Rowe opened, the developer gave the owner a sweet deal. Someone could have easily salvaged the building, possibly even the theatre concept there, there was plenty of life left in it."

batonrouge,3cmx3m,so_CRATES91,2,Thu Jul 9 15:04:28 2015 UTC,"Check out the USS Kidd and the educational movies at the Louisiana Arts and Science museum. The old state capitol is quite beautiful with its stained glass. Plus you can learn some history. The new capitol building is ok. Best just to go to the top to get a view of all Baton Rouge. There is a laser tag arena on Sherwood forest. A trampoline park near the mall. Btw if you plan on doing any shopping Thats probably your best bet. But make sure you go to the mall of La not cortana. Go down to LSU campus to see some nice sites, the football stadium plus some ok places to eat near Highland rd. If you are looking to try some local food then hit up Parrains. They have a great selection of seafood. Rice and Roux on oniel lane is a good place to get some jambalaya to try. Roccos poboys is good for traditional New Orleans style poboys. Best roast beef poboy in town. There are a wealth of places that sell boiled crawfish of you wanted to try your hand at that. For breakfast try Frank's on Airline hwy. I don't know how long you will be here but if you have any inclanation to go see New Orleans, don't. Not only is New Orleans dangerous but you will get ripped off at every street corner by people attempting to trick you. Saying things like ""I bet you I know where you got your shoes."" and of course they say you got them on your feet and ask for 5 dollars. If you do however make your way down to N.O. then just go see the aquarium then eat at a local restaurant then leave the city. Its just one big tourist trap. If you are travelling alone then stay away from downtown after dark. Anyway just have fun and remember to ask if you have any questions. The /r/batonrouge community is pretty helpful and nice. I know for sure because we recently had a meet up and not one person was a douche from what I could tell. There is usually always something to do. We just say it's boring because we live here and have experianced it all before. Now its definately no NYC but can be fun. Usually if you can't find something to do then you're not looking very hard.

batonrouge,3cmx3m,KGB_ate_my_bread,3,Thu Jul 9 17:19:35 2015 UTC,"As far as a place to eat & get a really good bloody mary- Stop by Masons. They're really popular for brunch (9-3 saturday and sundays i think) So if you go for brunch- go on a saturday. It's a little less overwhelming. Get an award winning bloody mason(you drink them out of a beef jerky stick) For brunch try the chicken and waffles. For just a regular stop in- The BBQ shrimp and fried grit cake is pretty awesome. The cove and the rum house are also super cool places to visit.   Avoid all of Tigerland, and if you're going downtown I would recommend only one drink but more so I'd recommend going with a friend. It can get pretty dangerous down there and according to the church near convention, there was a string of reported date rapes last year.  In certain areas, you should be good. Seriously though- avoid tigerland and getting drunk by yourself downtown.  Baton Rouge is incredibly boring. We're literally stuck in the 70's. It's awful. On fridays, there is live after 5 downtown.   If you can make it to Ethel, Louisiana- There is Barn Hill Preserve. It's like a zoo but you get to get up close and personal with the animals. It's $10 to enter and an extra $10 to hold the animals. There's much more to do in New Orleans, too. There's the highland observatory, the farmers market, trivia nights at the londoner, bluebonnet swamp tour, the botantical gardens, sky 51 or whatever that trampoline place is called, visiting the houmas house or the myrtles, tickfaw state park, tunica hills, global wildlife center, get the best donuts of your life at tiger doughnuts, avoid the baton rouge zoo and go to audubon in new orleans, and pretty much everything else can be found on 225, batonrougemoms, or nola's websites.

We in the know like to think of them as cozy places where your worst personality traits can come out to play.  As for themes, most places have abandoned the whole ""BDSM"" cliche, and now go with more seaonal or festive vibe, like Fourth of July Bash and Smash or Ramadan Sexathon. You know, stuff like that.

It is the best place I have lived in and the community is awesome as everyone is very friendly.    My biggest complaint?  I'm going to have to think about this and I'll comment later tonight with one.  I don't really have any big complaints as everything is fairly well maintained.  There have been minor complaints which is mostly due to design such as:   the dishwasher barely clears the window sill when opening a cabinet door in the kitchen doesn't close flush with the cabinet There's not a ton of extra storage beyond the walk in closet and another closet in the bedroom and the patio washroom. Slugs on the courtyard patios at night  A few weeks ago when it rained and tornadoed like Jesus was coming back, I discovered that rain water can come through the windows where the sliding pane meets the stationary pane if it rains on it directly at a gallon per second with 90 mph wind.

batonrouge,3cjoyw,TheFarlol,3,Wed Jul 8 13:06:18 2015 UTC,"It seems like you're set on private schools, but I would like to recommend another option. Baton Rouge has some very good magnet programs. Namely Baton Rouge High. It is one of the top schools in the state.  It produces the highest ACT and Sat scores and puts out an insane number of national merit scholars.   I know high-school is a long ways away,  but I mention this because it is very difficult to send your child there with out going to the feeder middle school and consequently the feeder elementary school.   I strongly recommend looking into it,  it's free and the best education you can get.   Also the new Lee High is run by the same principle,  should be a very good school too."

My daughter goes to Runnels, and I really can't recommend it highly enough! We (and she) love it!  If you are catholic, consider those schools.   If you are politically connected, consider the lab school.   The international school makes absolutely no sense to me. Math is hard enough for some kids, why make it harder by teaching it in mandarin? It seems to attract hipster parents, if that is your thing.   St luke / episcopal is reasonably priced in the lower levels, but I think senior year runs something like 20k. That's just ridiculous.   That's my opinion on local schools.

St. Lukes is a great school, that is where my son will probably go to Kindergarten next year.

Tight community, and lots of options for extra curriculars. Drama, for instance, is compulsory 1-3. Teach speech and reading. All sorts of programs like that.  That being said, the magnet/gifted program is pretty great in EBR. Don't count it out. Baton Rouge F.L.A.M.E., might be magnet, it's a foreign language immersion school.

The majority of students are not bright and the school could have a much better education system. That said, there ARE a few good teachers here and there, plenty of AP classes offered with these good teachers, and an okay community. However one of the hardest things was to see my friends turn away from Christianity due to the sheer number of asshole hypocrites leading the school. Some teachers do a good job of living what they preach but a lot don't and do the typical ""don't question authority, respect me or else"" when you call them out on it.  I've probably made it sound terrible but I thoroughly enjoyed it and had plenty of opportunities, graduated toward the top of my class with extreme ease, and learned a lot, not just from the text books, but about people and how things work. But unless you expect your child to be relatively smart without having to work toward it, I wouldn't suggest PBS  Hope this helps your decision, and feel free to message me"

I am a transit geek myself and with recently moving from NYC to BR, I see insane traffic problems that could be mitigated with better planning.   I was just thinking about this stuff today while I was stuck in traffic on airline and siegen.   Maybe with some outreach, such as getting Jarrett from human transit to work out some issues like he did with Houston, we could see some real work done.   I posted not too long ago about the bike situation. Look, I know BR is like, really hot and humid.

Was working fine, started it up and plugged it in, had low battery and wasn't charging fast enough to stay booted.  Checked some dell forums and found a person who said it was a motherboard issue that they had Dell fix.  Since I'm out of warranty, they want to charge me almost $300 without even telling me what they will fix."
batonrouge,3cc3j1,gsweathers,2,Tue Jul 7 14:15:16 2015 UTC,"normally when it won't hold a charge it's one of the two things.  The hole the charger plugs into is bad, or one of the connections that hold it to the mother board is broken.  Either way you have to take it apart remove the old and solder a new one to the board or buy a new motherboard.  Option one is the cheaper, but the problem is that it is very easy to fk it up in which case you are buying a new motherboard anyway.   Most places won't do it because of that risk and for what they would have to charge, it's usually cheaper to get a new tablet."

batonrouge,3c95ym,QueefOnMyBeard,3,Mon Jul 6 20:22:36 2015 UTC,"Highly unlikely to happen. A cat5 Ethernet cable doesn't transmit power, it transmits signal which is likely less than 5 volts. If you had a surge powerful enough to damage your electronics, it would have fried the cable before ever making it that far due to excess amperage pull."
batonrouge,3c95ym,ThatDerpingGuy,0,Mon Jul 6 12:14:41 2015 UTC,"Not at all true. I've had it happen. Granted, a direct strike to ethernet will fry the cable - but some surge will get thru.  Also, you  can get a strike at point A, causeing issues to arc over to point B w/o direct connection and it will carry current & do ugly things."
batonrouge,3c95ym,TheSharkFromJaws,2,Mon Jul 6 13:04:35 2015 UTC,"Category 5 cable uses 24 AWG conductors, which can safely carry 360 mA at 50 V according to the latest TIA ruling.[citation needed] The cable has eight conductors (only half of which are used for power) and therefore the absolute maximum power transmitted using direct current is 50 V × 0.360 A × 2 = 36 W. Considering the voltage drop after 100 m, a PD would be able to receive 31.6 W. The additional heat generated in the wires by PoE at this current level (4.4 watts per 100 meter cable) limits the total number of cables in a bundle to be 100 cables at 45 °C, according to the TIA. This can be somewhat alleviated by the use of Category 6 cable which uses 23 AWG conductors."

batonrouge,3c95ym,_Kaiser,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:41:36 2015 UTC,"This happened to me 2 weeks ago when we had the bad storms roll through. I came home to my house smelling like melted plastic, along with a dead cable box & modem/router combo (plugged into cable jacks in different rooms). The other things plugged into the same power outlets (TVs) were fine. When Cox came to fix it, the dude said the ""booster"" in the attic was fried. I know nothing about how cable is run, so I'm not sure what that even is.   Not fun."
batonrouge,3c95ym,Tymanthius,0,Mon Jul 6 18:04:43 2015 UTC,"Former Cox guy, and while it could have come thru the cable line, just to be clear, it would have been a lightening strike, not something Cox can control. And it's more common to come thru a power line.  And a surge protector wouldn't have done much. They aren't rated for lightening usually (although the insurance is nice if you can get them to pay out). Also, the ones w/ cable ports are more likely to cause interference with your modem/tv than not.  What you need is a lightening arrestor like ham radio operators use on their cables.  Or possibly DEMCO's service. I've seen those little boxes take a direct hit (lightening hit tree, jumped to cable & melted it, hit little box, box died. Replaced box & cable line, house was fine).  Something to keep in mind with surge protectors is that they take many small hits over time, and lose their ability to protect. What I do at home for my home entertainment center is a UPS rated for the wattage I have. It'll keep my 52"" plasma, Sony 7.1 Rcvr, modem, wireless ap, cox modem and 400w PSU on my home server running for about 10 mins on power out. If I kill the rcv'r & tv, the rest stays up much longer.  What this also does is keep the power level when there are brown outs & minor surges. Which are one of the major causes of dead electronics, even tho it happens over time.  TL;DR: Most likely lightening, more common to come thru power than cable; don't use surge protectors, use UPS's. Get Strike Safe from Demco."

Personally, I feel like rent is throwing money away when you can pay a mortgage for the same price, but I realize not everyone feels that way.  In any case, it is my personal opinion that the affordable housing out that way is more likely to not be in an area of those in poorer socioeconomical status, but perhaps he can find a house to rent in an older neighborhood in br city limits."
batonrouge,3bxcna,jmeiske,2,Fri Jul 3 01:49:43 2015 UTC,"Rent is the most that you will ever pay for housing. A mortgage is the least you will ever pay for housing.  Plus, OP is a student moving here, so we can assume that he's got family elsewhere and/or might not be here past four years. In which case, a mortgage could be throwing money away too.  That said, there are also plenty of condos around that are cheaper to buy than to rent, and a lot of the cost associated with exterior maintenance should be covered by the HOA fee. That's never a sure thing, as HOA fees can go up, but still, I think it would be a good compromise between homeownership and rent for a student. I know some people buy their kids condos near LSU so that they can tailgate once the kids graduate and move on."

St. Jean apartments off Soth Harrels Ferry Rd were really nice when I moved here. In less than 5 years that complex was total ghetto.

I definitely suggest asking a native or someone who has been here a while before deciding. There are definite general ghetto areas then there are weird little pockets situated in the middle of generally good areas. Also traffic issues. Some people mentioned Essen as a good area. It is a generally safe area, but traffic can be a nightmare at certain times. Also if anything happens on the interstates (hurricane evacuation, carpocolypse, wreck on the bridge) you can get really stuck. There are a few places like that. Be wary of anywhere affected by Game traffic too. Basically just ask. People here are really friendly for the most part and will be glad to give their opinions."

But TMo in the city is excellent, the only issue is capacity/speed (ironic given that's usually our strong suit) but there's an upgrade coming this month to help with that.  T-Mobile's going through a major rural buildout in Louisiana this year, so areas (particularly along the northshore, north of Baton Rouge, and north Louisiana) where they've traditionally been weak will be getting much better service.   West Baton Rouge, Pointe Coupee, and Iberville is fairly weak, don't know about any plans for there.  Can't comment on Sprint."

When you leave EBR and head anywhere else in any direction it gets spotty. Even in a populated area like prairieville or Gonzales is hit or miss. Sprint sucks shit randomly all over town.

Nice chill bistro / restaurant vibe in the bar area. Sunday ONLY  Mason's - $5 bottomless champagne; order a large orange juice and you've got bottomless mimosas. Breakfast burger is awesome. Sweet potato pancakes are good also. Busy restaurant vibe. You will be waiting to get a table if you aren't there early. Saturday and Sunday  Duvic's - They either do 2 for 1 mimosas or bottomless; seems the special changes from time to time. Good burgers and breakfast food. Duck fat fries with cheese and stuff on it are nice. Dim / dark / hole in the wall bar atmosphere but pleasant bartenders and patrons. Sunday ONLY  Chimes - Lot of selection for drinks- the large mimosa isn't a bad deal. Food is fine. I'd suggest Chime's East and get a table on the patio if it's before noon.

It's super quite and most neighbors and nice. There are some older people but they don't really do anything but tend to their gardens and check the mail.  The younger crowd is bringing kids back in the subdivision so there's a good bit of kids playing and hanging out.   Really aren't troubles in the area, but like how some said, it is kinda out of the way from major BR things. But it is like 10 min from Highland and Interstate 10 going the back way. Also, grocery store, some gas stations and a movie theater are like 2 miles from the subdivision."

batonrouge,3bp0d3,mechiah,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:48:29 2015 UTC,"Lived there a fairly long time. Pros are that it is pretty quiet overall and a generally nice/safe area. Cons are it is far from most of the frequented areas of BR (downtown, campus, midcity, etc.) and it's all strip mall/suburbia type places. Few quality restaurants and not much to do.  Also the area has been under constant construction for so.. many.. years. It will continue as Jones Creek will be 4-laned and this will impact the area significantly during construction."

batonrouge,3bp0d3,noodlebloom,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:35:04 2015 UTC,"I figured as much. Rent is same, but it's 200 more sq ft in a townhome versus a 2nd story apartment (with the two places I've kinda settled on). Also, newer, less likely to have a mild funk odor. Don't need amenities as much like a pool or tennis court.   Only thing I care about is having access to streets I can run on really. I cook mostly, so restaurants aren't a deal breaker.   I wouldn't mind a shorter commute from say, an apartment complex off College near I10, but I'm paying for less space in an older place.   We'll see, I have to move pretty quick as I need to get the ball rolling this week!"
batonrouge,3bp0d3,Madrassa,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:45:08 2015 UTC,"well definitely exhaust all your resources when searching. I HIGHLY recommend finding a place near the LSU lakes if you are a runner, like Southdowns, Garden District, or somewhere near the Perkins overpass. There can be decent rental options and being able to run the lakes is SO much better than running through that boring neighborhood (I went through the same years ago)."

I can't be the only person who's been avoiding the meetups just because bars have such a horrible atmosphere.  Why not something outdoors? An organized bike ride up and down the levee trail could be great. Or a hike, if someone would actually organize it at a place intended for hiking this time. Even cooler would be a canoe/kayak trip.

My hearing borders on hypersensitive, so a whole bunch of people loudly talking in a small space tends to range anywhere between moderately uncomfortable and physically painful.  I'll keep that in mind about setting up a meetup. I actually just PMed another person from this sub about about a bike camping trip, so I'll make a post and see if anyone else wants to come along should we end up doing it."

All I'm suggesting is that we choose a different place next time. The last few meetups have all been at bars. There's plenty more to do in this city, so why not take advantage of that? Having all the meetups at the same type of location just means that it's going to always exclude those who don't enjoy (or can't partake in) that one specific activity.   If this subreddit were something like /r/batonrougebarscene, it'd make perfect sense. But we're not. It's /r/batonrouge. We surely have members here who are under 21, recovering from alcoholism, don't like to drink, don't like bars, etc. They're automatically excluded from going to any of the meetups because of this.  Someone else suggested that I form one myself. I really like this idea, so I'll try to do that sometime soon."
batonrouge,3b13zd,KGB_ate_my_bread,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:28:47 2015 UTC,Yes but you are making automatic asumptions that all bars are loud and being all weird. None of the bars meetup have been at have been loud or overly loud. You have some kind of preconceived misconception of bars and it's making you exclude yourself tbqh. I mean hell I've been in nature situations that have been louder than some br bars.   you don't have to drink alcohol just because you're at a bar. if you can't control yourself at a bar and not drink then that problem is on you.
batonrouge,3b13zd,Lady_Bernkastel,2,Thu Jun 25 21:18:47 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm wrong then. I'll try coming to the next one and see. All the bars I've been to in the past have been very loud, so I sort of learned to avoid them as a whole. Having a couple of panic attacks will do that to you..."

batonrouge,3b13zd,KGB_ate_my_bread,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:45:47 2015 UTC,"Best hiking place (in my opinion) in the Baton Rouge area would be about an hour to an hour and a half north of BR in Fort Adams, MS at the Clark Creek Natural Area.   You have to pay a nominal fee to park, but the trail is pretty cool. There's a trail that basically follows the creek and hits a few waterfalls and another 'primitive' trail that takes a fair bit longer but goes to a few other waterfalls away from the main creek.  I saw someone with a sharpie out there had actually tagged a structure out there with /r/batonrouge or /r/nola , can't remember which, so I'm sure it's been done before.  I enjoy the trip and usually find a place in St. Francisville to stop and eat/get coffee afterwards. I'd say the hike would be no more than a 3 hour investment and that the drive would be 2.5 hours.   I also have a book on other hikes in Louisiana if you wanted me to dig around and see what else is available. Some of those are on more level ground and far easier to do, usually loops around lakes and things like at various state parks"
batonrouge,3b13zd,Lady_Bernkastel,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:51:09 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. It's definitely the best hike in the area. Second place would be Chicot State Park, but it's farther away and was completely overrun by wild hogs last time I was out there.

batonrouge,3azyus,MeanBrad,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:58:42 2015 UTC,because your comment was sooooo much more helpful... :P
batonrouge,3b18nz,Jnevels,3,Thu Jun 25 03:47:44 2015 UTC,Super interested! /u/whatfourthwall and I have been looking for a group to play with!
batonrouge,3b18nz,noodlebloom,2,Thu Jun 25 13:57:20 2015 UTC,She speaks truth.
batonrouge,3b18nz,whatfourthwall,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:27:50 2015 UTC,Awesome! I'll be setting up a meet and greet in the next few weeks to see who actually shows! Will give out details in a few days!
batonrouge,3b18nz,jeanzleezy,2,Fri Jun 26 07:42:53 2015 UTC,I have a friend that has a group that plays. I can ask him if they'd like an extra player!
batonrouge,3b18nz,gwydion1992,3,Thu Jun 25 03:51:40 2015 UTC,I'm also interested in joing a group
batonrouge,3b18nz,2Cubed,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:27:32 2015 UTC,That would be awesome! Id like to get a group to start but would love to see it in action first hand! Thanks :)
batonrouge,3b18nz,2Cubed,2,Thu Jun 25 03:53:59 2015 UTC,I'm moving down the BR late July and would definitely like to join a relatively casual group.
batonrouge,3b18nz,Springs83,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:55:19 2015 UTC,"You are for sure welcome to join! Just looking to have some fun, meet new people and have a few beverages of course."
batonrouge,3b18nz,Tymanthius,2,Fri Jun 26 07:47:37 2015 UTC,For sure. When I get down there I'll message you. It'll be good to getting to know people quickly.
batonrouge,3b18nz,BayouLife,2,Fri Jun 26 22:41:43 2015 UTC,What day are you thinking of playing?
batonrouge,3b18nz,Tymanthius,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:14:32 2015 UTC,Possibly like a weekday thing? I work in the Restaurant Industry so I for sure wont be off every weekend... But i can be flexible with my shifts as long as i have notice. When would be good for you?
batonrouge,3b18nz,Tymanthius,2,Fri Jun 26 07:46:44 2015 UTC,"I'm up for it.  :)    Over 30 years of RP exp, various games, but I suck as a GM.  ;)  Available most evenings.  PM if you'd like more. :)"
batonrouge,3b18nz,onlykatank,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:14:15 2015 UTC,For sure! About to PM you right now!
batonrouge,3b18nz,Yfael,2,Fri Jun 26 07:43:13 2015 UTC,Me and my room mate have never played before but have been talking about trying it for years. Please let me know of yalls next game night
batonrouge,3b18nz,Yfael,2,Thu Jun 25 14:19:43 2015 UTC,Check Roll20.net for games that cater to newbies too.  :)
batonrouge,3b18nz,Yfael,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:01:23 2015 UTC,We haven't picked out a date quite yet but will be soon! Just gotta find a place to do so and see how it goes :) I live in Central so it would be best to find a place in BTR. Maybe Highland Coffee outside?
batonrouge,3b18nz,alf_pog,2,Fri Jun 26 07:41:43 2015 UTC,"Something I forgot to mention - Roll20.net  Can be used for remote players to be part of the game, or if you have a projector, can project a map onto a wall or table so you can have quick & easy access to lots of maps you're pre-made.  :)"
batonrouge,3b18nz,ahebe62,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:59:50 2015 UTC,Awesome!!!! Thanks for sharing :)
batonrouge,3b18nz,cajuncuban,2,Fri Jun 26 07:39:33 2015 UTC,"I would love to join! And I know a few people who would be interested, too :)"
batonrouge,3b18nz,frostmccloud,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:27:43 2015 UTC,Know of anywhere good to play at? I live in Central which is towards Zachary so its kind of out of the way to leave BTR. How many people are down?
batonrouge,3b18nz,paperMichael,2,Fri Jun 26 07:39:11 2015 UTC,My bf and I have been looking for a group :) Just say when!
batonrouge,3b18nz,sirbissel,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:20:12 2015 UTC,Awesome! Know of anybody else? We don't have any experience of actually playing yet.
batonrouge,3b18nz,sirbissel,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:38:02 2015 UTC,"I might have a few friends who'd want to play too, I've got house space to host, but lack a large enough table lol"
batonrouge,3b18nz,chrispiiiii,2,Fri Jun 26 19:30:20 2015 UTC,I can totally find a table if you're down.

batonrouge,3b0xls,motherfuckinwoofie,10,Thu Jun 25 02:11:33 2015 UTC,It's really trashy. I hate going there.
batonrouge,3b0xls,Asshairbrush,7,Thu Jun 25 13:52:06 2015 UTC,Yeah if you like waiting an hour to ride a single slide.
batonrouge,3b0xls,loki7714,3,Thu Jun 25 03:59:46 2015 UTC,I love all of the animals (primarily cats) they store in the buildings behind the place.  Especially the room of dead cats stored in PVC pipes.
batonrouge,3b0xls,melance,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:45:05 2015 UTC,For true?
batonrouge,3b0xls,scubachris,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:48:39 2015 UTC,Yep.  For true.  The owner rescues cats and such.  When they die he seals them in pvc tubes and keeps them in a closet.
batonrouge,3b0xls,melance,2,Thu Jun 25 22:54:39 2015 UTC,I guess it is better than customers
batonrouge,3b0xls,scubachris,2,Thu Jun 25 23:02:01 2015 UTC,You must be driving by when it's closed.  Place is packed when it is open.
batonrouge,3b0xls,ThingsIveSeenandDone,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:22:44 2015 UTC,Maybe.  I usually pass by between 530 and 6.
batonrouge,3b0xls,jack_mccrackin,3,Thu Jun 25 11:05:22 2015 UTC,"yeah it's closed at 6 and lots of people make their way out after 4:30ish due to being tired. It is also OFTEN closed down for periods of time due to storms so people will be off the rides/out of the pools until the all-clear is made (which is typically late afternoon given our weather patterns). If you go, go when it opens.  Just be sure to load up on vitamins the day before and after. You'll definitely get to test your immune system there."
batonrouge,3b0xls,jeanzleezy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:13:14 2015 UTC,"I've always loved it (27yo/f) The big black and red slide is my favorite. The racing one with the foam sled that you can see from the interstate is great, too. Be prepared to huff and puff up all those stairs, though."
batonrouge,3b0xls,trollaweigh,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:12:53 2015 UTC,Ya'll like any of these bands?
batonrouge,3b0xls,sloth_jones,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:01:41 2015 UTC,I've heard of two of them
batonrouge,3b0xls,awarmlight,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:18:54 2015 UTC,Mondays.  Never waited in line more than 15 minutes.
batonrouge,3b0xls,j021,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:27:29 2015 UTC,Yes we got season passes and have been going every weekend.  Pretty much go in at 10 a.m. Saturday or Sunday and ride the slides until the lines get to long and leave.  It's been fun.  The amusement park side doesn't open til 12 or 2 on weekends not sure when.  Haven't utilized that side yet.
batonrouge,3b0xls,macbookproearly2011,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:20:25 2015 UTC,"I wish they still had a regular pool, the wave pool doesn't cut it. I use to just float as a kid. When I worked there as a minor I never went, the place is so boring."
batonrouge,3b0xls,mechiah,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:13:59 2015 UTC,"Last went about five years ago, had a grand time. Trying to find a time to bring my nephews up for an excuse to go again soon."
batonrouge,3b0xls,LazyCassiusCat,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:33:54 2015 UTC,"It's literally my favorite place in Baton Rouge. Caution, weekends are packed.  Weekdays are better if you can make it.  Summer holidays are pretty packed too.  Try to go as early as you can.  If you even think that you might go twice in the summer, just get a season pass. It comes with lots of useful coupons.  If you don't get a season pass at least bring a coke can which gets you $5 off."
batonrouge,3b0xls,MapsThePlanet,8,Thu Jun 25 06:55:34 2015 UTC,"If BB is literally your FAVORITE place in the entire city of Baton Rouge, I feel sorta bad for you."

batonrouge,3b0xls,sacklunch,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:43:08 2015 UTC,Louie's has been my favorite place for the fifteen years I've been going to it.
batonrouge,3b0xls,DrinkMoreCodeMore,3,Fri Jun 26 03:02:36 2015 UTC,"The slides at BB are fun, but you can grease up the floor at Louie's and slide around ALL DAY rain or shine!"

I get a kick every time AT&T comes by and tries to sell me their slow service. I show them the speedtest and they shuffle away and move on to the next sucker. I know Cox has its detractors here, but as an IT professional I can't recommend them enough. I have always had excellent service in my area and never an outage outside of a hurricane. I do feel bad for those that live in areas with less than stellar service but I can only speak for myself and my own experiences."
batonrouge,3azm5h,jay1333,3,Wed Jun 24 20:18:11 2015 UTC,"You can get ""up to"" 150 Mb service. Without dedicated lines, your speeds are going to radically depend on how much the people around you use their connections, and how active Cox is with their node management."

batonrouge,3awtkn,whatfourthwall,3,Wed Jun 24 15:07:10 2015 UTC,"Yea, you're absolutely correct.  I guess I should rephrase myself. I fit in with this group of people, therefore they're all relatively normal to me. (Which means I guess I think everyone is weird because I am pretty weird...)"

batonrouge,3awh95,wilfred81,4,Wed Jun 24 01:39:15 2015 UTC,If you're in a bar you're doing it wrong.  Stay as close as possible to campus. Park a mile or so away where you can amongst the thousands of other cars.  Walk where everyone else is going. Get drunk. Get invited to eat good food and tailgate with your newfound best friends.
batonrouge,3awh95,ThingsIveSeenandDone,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:59:49 2015 UTC,What about after the game? Do people just hang around and tailgate again or do they head off to nearby or downtown bars?
batonrouge,3awh95,ThingsIveSeenandDone,4,Wed Jun 24 02:47:47 2015 UTC,I guess it depends on how drunk they are.  A lot of people's post game is passing out. There are tons of bars though. It's the main activity in Baton Rouge.
batonrouge,3awh95,Lelide,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:39:16 2015 UTC,"Haha sounds like we'll fit in, that's the main activity in the Twin Cities too."
batonrouge,3awh95,Lelide,2,Wed Jun 24 21:09:57 2015 UTC,"Varsity and Walkons are both walking distance from campus, but one is north and one is south. Depending on where you park and if you make friends, those are popular places to go after the game."
batonrouge,3awh95,ThingsIveSeenandDone,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:56:41 2015 UTC,"Nice, thanks for the suggestions. We'll obviously just walk around and check out the scene before the game, but it's hard to plan on banking we'll make friends and get invited to tailgate afterwards also, which is why knowing what bars to go to would be useful. We're thinking of checking out Varsity and Chimes since I've read good things about Chimes. I'm surprised nobody has tried to mess with me so far by suggesting Splash...I already saw it's a gay bar haha..."
batonrouge,3awh95,carnedv,3,Wed Jun 24 21:15:16 2015 UTC,"You should try to stay on campus at Lod Cook Hotel. You won't want to do anything but tailgate/game/more tailgating or nearby party. Traffic on/off campus is terrible, so if you can walk it, do."
batonrouge,3awh95,Lelide,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:31:34 2015 UTC,Yeah I already looked at that one and the Staybridge Suites just south of campus and they're already booked that weekend unfortunately. Closest hotels are either downtown or around highway 10 about 5 miles from campus. So we're planning to park somewhere as close as we can get and just walk around everywhere. Is there an area that seems to fill up parking-wise later than others?
batonrouge,3awh95,Lelide,3,Wed Jun 24 02:53:36 2015 UTC,You're basically gonna be parking on the side of a road somewhere. The earlier you get out there the closer you'll be.  Also if you want to get back to your hotel after the game leave the game early. It can take a few hours to go 2 miles.
batonrouge,3awh95,SuperRusso,2,Wed Jun 24 05:43:04 2015 UTC,"In that past there have been shuttles that will take you from downtown to campus and back on game days for $10. It's called The Touchdown Express and it's run by CATS (Capital Area Transit System). It was discontinued for a few years but was back last year. No word yet on if it will be running this year but I'd say it's likely that it will be back. If it is running, staying downtown and getting down to campus that way would be a solid option."
batonrouge,3awh95,FriedBananas96,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:56:49 2015 UTC,"That could be prime...thank you, I'll keep my eyes out for if it's available."
batonrouge,3awh95,AgoraAddict,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:17:18 2015 UTC,The problem is that you have to pay to park on campus ($40!!!) so nearly everyone parks just right off campus. Drop a pin at your car so you can get back to it.   Highway 10?? What's the street name?

batonrouge,3ap4qu,mdlost1,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:23:35 2015 UTC,"I usually average about 50-60 miles per day while touring. The most I've done with a full touring load is about 80, but that makes things more stressful than relaxing. My normal pace is pretty much whatever is comfortable, which usually works out as 12-14mph, but it totally depends on conditions. Here's an album from last year of a short overnight trip to Lake Verret, as an example.  Hopefully I didn't scare you off by actually giving numbers (that's what normally happens...) It's nowhere near as difficult as it seems. If you're reasonably fit, you'd be able to do it with maybe a month of occasional training beforehand, so long as your bike actually fits and isn't single speed."

I just recently started really working out hard the past two weeks and I'm slowly seeing the change. But I am totally up to try it and see if I like it but I wouldn't know if my bike fits?"
batonrouge,3ap4qu,txstCamOps,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:48:46 2015 UTC,"The pace I take is pretty relaxed (with lots of food breaks), so it doesn't require peak physical condition or anything. I've done tours ""cold"" before, where I did absolutely no training beforehand and still managed just fine. It just requires that you're used to riding a bike for hours at a time. I'd liken the actual level of exertion to hiking.  ""Fit"" refers to whether the bike is properly adjusted and sized to fit your body. Having this done improperly can cause all manner of soreness. Here's a basic (almost too basic) article about it. The saddle height is definitely most important. I get significant knee pain if mine is even slightly too low.  What type of bike do you have? Have a picture?"
batonrouge,3ap4qu,txstCamOps,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:56:31 2015 UTC,My bike is a schwinn tourist. I believe it is a hybrid bike. The only thing I have really done to it is change the seat and have puncture proof inner tubes I don't have any picture of it
batonrouge,3ap4qu,txstCamOps,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:22:56 2015 UTC,"That looks very much workable (almost ideal, in fact,) though the one concern I'd have is breaking spokes. The low spoke count wheels on newer Schwinns are somewhat notorious for that. It'd probably be worthwhile to take it to a bike shop and get a couple spares made before going on any actual tours with it. If you come with me, I'm familiar with wheelbuilding and carry the tools to change them should this happen.   As far as fit goes, on that bike I'd just worry about getting the saddle position correct. There are numerous articles about this if you search online. If you're like me and start getting hand numbness after riding for a while, fitting a trekking bar (available for $20 or so online, bar tape can be had for $5 or less) would be a wise modification. This allows you to change both hand and riding position, making for much improved comfort.   Let me know if you want to just meet up and ride sometime (preferably early morning, since it's summer.) It doesn't necessarily have to be anything long-distance at first. I presume you're located in the LSU area?"

I have extensive camping experience both deep woods and on-site, but no real touring experience. I'm not opposed to buying a set of racks or backpacking it my first go."
batonrouge,3ap4qu,Slanderpanic,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:34:31 2015 UTC,"Oh, well awesome. Based on your reply, I was thinking you might not have realized what I meant by bike touring. I'm glad that's not the case.  I'm a student, so I've got the whole summer off if you'd like to set something up. Touring in summer can be a bit weird though. The most comfortable way to do it is to ride for a few hours starting right around dawn, have a long nap or find a city to explore, then ride a few more hours in the evening. This avoids the extreme heat above the road surfaces.  Awesome bike, by the way. Are you going to tour on that, or have something else? My personal suggestion for managing gear would be to get a cheap rack (The cannondale one is cheap and strong), then use some random bags you have as panniers. I don't even want to think about the last time I rode 60 miles with a backpack."
batonrouge,3ap4qu,Slanderpanic,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:14:25 2015 UTC,This is my only geared roadie.  I have a mountain bike and two velodrome track bikes as well.  I'm looking into a cross bike soon so that may be a bit better for racks and such.  I'm willing to make a go of it on this though.  If my friend can tour on a venge I can tour on a lightspeed right?
batonrouge,3ap4qu,Slanderpanic,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:38:35 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, you should be able to do light touring just fine on it. It won't be ideal, but who cares? You'll still do way better than my first tour, which involved a super old rack disintegrating halfway through the first day. I would worry about clamping things to a carbon fork. Another option could be a ""bikepacking"" style bar or frame bag instead of front panniers. It looks like your frame has plenty of space for it. Going rear rack only creates very strange handling, especially on sporty bikes.  If your mountain bike is a hardtail, that could also work. It's really awkward to rig gear to a dual suspension bike, but still technically doable."

You've taken that right away from them.  This pisses me off.  Everyone on reddit is so willing to scream about privacy and net neutrality and civil rights until they want some upvotes.

And, I disagree about having the picture taken. If you go in public, people see you, you might end up in the background of a photo, you might be the center of it.  We aren't digging up any dirty details she hasn't put out there themselves. Your argument is a straw man. Not valid.

The conquences of having information go public on a national are potentially high, however small the chances are.  Being in public is not the same as retaining control of what you put out there.  This is why if you're in the background of a movie for example you must sign a release, legally allowing said film to use that image.  Same if you include a picture of someones home or car."

In this case if the teacher saw this thread and got butt-hurt about it I wouldn't really want them teaching my kids how to be over-reactive  and sensitve. Humor makes things better. Also embarrassment is part of life I'm sure this teacher has learned it plenty and a little more doesn't and shouldn't mean jack.

batonrouge,3ajpgm,Geaux,6,Sat Jun 20 23:25:07 2015 UTC,"I ride the bus sometimes, but it usually winds up being faster to just ride a bike all the way to the destination. The problem is the one hour route intervals. They work out fine if you can get to the destination on a single ride, but it becomes really awful if you have to make a transfer (or god help you if you need multiple transfers.)  If they could change them to thirty minute intervals, it would result in a MUCH more usable bus system, on par with most other cities of this size. (well, apart from walking access to the bus stops. I have to walk through a ditch to get to the one by my house...) The current routes they have are actually remarkably well-planned. It just gets really old when you have to wait 40 minutes for that next bus to come along.   By the way, anyone who rides the bus and has a smartphone should install routeshout. It has GPS trackers on the entire bus fleet, and usually predicts their arrival time quite accurately. It's very helpful when there's high traffic and the buses are delayed."

You mentioned the MBTA - I lived in Boston as well - and you're right, CATS rates are pretty good - better than some cities, worse than others.  Anyway, to answer your question, car ownership has become a cultural status symbol, and utilizing semi-public services such as buses is synonymous with welfare in the cultural shame it brings.  Like many cities, as middle class folks get in better positions in life, move to better areas, the former denizens of those areas migrate out and build new burbs for themselves, which lasts a couple years, until the plebs start filtering in again (there is also a cycle of revitalization/gentrification, but how that will affect Baton Rouge's public transportation is a few years away from being known).  Unlike Boston and NYC, there isn't any sort of commuter rail, so the suburbanites have to drive into town. There is a cute park-and-ride initiative for those coming in from Denham, but by that point they've already braved the worst of I-12, so busing from there would actually be worse for them."

Nothing in BR can compete w/ LUS fiber.  :/  Cox is actually really good, and reasonably priced if compared to other offerings across the nation that are not fiber.

If you want to watch all your tv thru inet, bump up one to the 100mb line (also, I can help you out w/ TV via inet if you want to pm me).  When ATT rolled out Uverse a lot of ppl jumped ship from Cox.  A few months later MANY of them jumped back, and have stayed.  DSL simply can't compare. Actually had a conversation w/ an ATT tech while we both worked 'up the ladder' at the same pole.

There's not enough space around many of them, especially the ones near the eating area. Also, the open front allowed for breathing in every cigarette smoked by the people waiting outside the Varsity for a show, which was god awful."
batonrouge,3aby77,TheFarlol,5,Thu Jun 18 23:20:08 2015 UTC,"I must be the only one disappointed by their bar staff short-pouring drinks. Quick story: I was there with some friends and ordered a double bombay sapphire on rocks. Bartender needed me to point out the bottle for her and tell her what kind of spirit it was, so I did. She then asks what I'm assuming is her manager how to pour a double and the boy tells her to do a 3-count pour with an extra splash. I asked if they had jiggers behind the bar and was told ""they don't have any"". >_>  (For the uninformed, a 3-count is anywhere from half to less than half of what a double pour should be)  Now, if you've got experienced bartenders behind your bar then I can understand letting them free-pour but if I have to explain what Bombay Sapphire is and they need help with pouring a double, they belong in a daiquiri shop.  Sorry, /rant.  Positive side: That deep fried PB&J was awesome."
batonrouge,3aby77,iScott_BR,3,Fri Jun 19 13:50:57 2015 UTC,"Had a burger here because I enjoyed Curbside. The burger was terrible. It was unevenly cooked throughout from raw to done. So I decided to take out some foot soldiers to vent, but Leonardo's attack button was broken. I jumped and jumped, but I failed to score any points - much like Barcadia failed to score any points with me."
batonrouge,3aby77,seidule,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:37:07 2015 UTC,I went there yesterday and got a pint and pumped about 3 bucks into TMNT. Donatello (what I played) worked flawlessly and my friend on Leonardo didn't have any complaints. I guess they fixed the glitch.
batonrouge,3aby77,Burgerkingsucks,6,Sun Jun 21 03:08:14 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I don't mind the marketing.  I just don't go because it's full of douche bags and the food is overpriced."
batonrouge,3aby77,SuperRusso,2,Thu Jun 18 23:54:26 2015 UTC,The ads aren't great but what gets me is that the food isn't better and the games aren't maintained.  The last time I are there the burger and fries were blobs of grease and made me feel awful. My boyfriend got a poboy and the bread was so hard he could barely eat it. The games broke down while we were playing and we were told to shake the air hockey table to get it to work.
batonrouge,3aby77,tinyninjababies,-2,Fri Jun 19 17:30:10 2015 UTC,"Fat Cow is a similar business model and does just fine. The Chimes has been a flagship institution for years and does just fine. Canes does just fine. Even dirty and grimey Raul's does has been there for years now. You can have a successful business in that area without stooping to this. Admittedly they're the newcomer to a rather saturated market, but if they kept the quality up that they had before as Curbside, I'd be willing to bet they'd do just fine too. Sadly, my experiences there have been similar to those had be /u/seidule."

It was a key initiative that Taylor brought into his tenure but couldn't get support from a few key board members.  I've been told that they thought it would look bad on some of their principals.   BRAC and a few other groups in BR had a similar solution that I think would work.  They proposed it to the state leg last session and it didn't pass....a few key leg members killed it.  It divided the parish into 4 quadrants.  If you're in that zone, you can choose between those schools.  I think each one had only 1 high school, but the key was improving school for the younger kids.  Also, magnet schools were for the entire parish not just the individual zones.   It would also end this idiotic busing that we do across the entire parish and shuffle kids within their zone."

It would also end this idiotic busing that we do across the entire parish and shuffle kids within their zone.   80% of the reason for the 'idiotic busing' across the parish is because of parish-wide magnet schools.   The remainder is for the 800 or so 'choice' kids who can opt out of their current school and attend a higher-performing one. And, that's due to state law, not EBR policy.   BRAC and a few other groups in BR had a similar solution that I think would work. They proposed it to the state leg last session and it didn't pass....a few key leg members killed it.   BRAC's plan (Senate Bill 636) was mainly about about stripping spending power from the EBR school system and investing it in principals. It was more about restructuring who receives foodservice, transportation, and maintenance dollars from individual schools than it was about education. It also included provisions to build an enrollment system that automatically routed students to charter schools in EBR parish (many of which are owned by BRAC affiliates).  The 'school zone' business mainly came out of BRAC's affiliated group - the 'Baton Rouge Achievement Zone', which sought to control/direct all school funding for North BR."

Hopefully there is some reform of this process so that greedy men like Lionel Rainey and his possey that get rich off of no bid government contracts cannot threaten to destroy this parish in the future.  First of all, there needs to be some kind of time limit on movements like this. Sure they apparently got very close to the total needed, but it's utterly ridiculous that they were claiming to be close to their goal and practically done collecting signatures back in 2013. Obviously, they were greatly overestimating their ability to collect signatures back then, but this type of action has serious consequences. If there really are a large enough group of people that have thoroughly considered forming a new city, then it shouldn't be a problem for them to all sign the petition within 6 months, or hell, even a year. The fact that this process is so open ended is completely unreasonable.  Secondly, it should not only be the people within the proposed city limits that get to vote on whether or not to incorporate. This decisions affects the entire parish and, truly, the entire state. People that supported the new city kept making bogus claims that their tax dollars were being stolen, but those claims were really unsupported. We're talking about sales tax, not income tax. Just because the Siegen Walmart, for example, is in the unincorporated area, does not mean that only people from the unincorporated area shop there. The city-parish paid for all the roads and infrastructure that allowed all those shopping centers to thrive, and the city-parish owns all the debt associated with that infrastructure. The fact that no one outside of the proposed city limits would have any say in the vote that would essentially leave the city-parish holding the debt for all of that while taking away all of that revenue is the worst part of all this. The supporters of this movement keep making ignorant and overly simplistic statements about how this petition is all about the right to vote, but if they really care about the right to vote so much, then surely they will agree that everyone that would be affected by a movement like this should have some say in the matter.  Overall, I'm glad this is finally over. The whole ordeal has been a huge embarrassment for this region on a national scale. But the embarrassment would have been the least of our worries had this movement actually succeeded. It would have bankrupted the city parish and the citizens of the new city would have found out quickly that their leaders had lied to them and they would have seen their new city struggle with terrible budget issues as it tried to pay for new schools government services and other costs that Lionel Rainey and friends swept under the rug. This region will either prosper together or flounder together, and even though a common line from supporters of the beakaway was, ""things can't get any worse"", they most certainly could get much worse and they would have.  EDIT: Forgot a word. Meant to say that it should not only be the people within the proposed city limits that have a say in incorporation."

I mean we could vote to throw more tax dollars at our failing public transportation system so they can bleed that out?  I guess at least we're not Funroe.  Honestly (and more seriously), I am not really for or against the whole St. George incorporation thing.  I live in the unincorporated area, but I really don't care, as long as I'm not incorporated into BR.  What I do have an issue with is people that don't live in the area that want to tell the unincorporated area what to do with their property.     The city-parish paid for all the roads and infrastructure that allowed all those shopping centers to thrive, and the city-parish owns all the debt associated with that infrastructure.    I've had this debate here before - who decided to spend that money?  Was it voted on by anyone?  If so, was it just the people in the unincorporated area, or was it the entire parish?  How about this - I go over to some random neighborhood, find someone with a lawn that hasn't been mowed in a few weeks, and ask their neighbors if I should mow that person's grass.  If the neighbors say I should, then I go mow that person's lawn.  Maybe I even skip asking the neighbors and just mow the lawn.  Then I demand $30 for my services from that homeowner.  That's ridiculous, right?  Whether there was a vote or not, EBR went into debt for the unincorporated area. If there was no contract for the unincorporated area to pay that money back, it's childish to wrong the unincorporated area for the blunder, blame the local government for making the decision to go into debt over something they NEVER had any guarantee would get paid back."
batonrouge,39rgmg,Prog,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:38:26 2015 UTC,"but to imply that EBR Parish is capable of being much shittier is a stretch.   It's not. Saying, ""things can't get any worse"" are famous last words from people that just don't want to consider the consequences of their actions. I believe that, if it had been successful, this incorporation movement would have made things worse for all residents of EBR Parish, and I feel like the economic impact studies done support that claim, but even though there are obviously people that will disagree with me on that, I really think it's indefensible to say that things cannot get any worse. Whether or not someone thinks that the St. George movement would lead to bankruptcy, it should be obvious that bankruptcy would make things worse.   I've had this debate here before - who decided to spend that money? Was it voted on by anyone?   It was voted on by the metro council. The unincorporated areas of the parish have plenty of representation on the metro council. We live in a representative democracy, not every single issue is put to full public vote, but people in the proposed St. George area have do vote for their representatives, and those representatives are involved in decided how money city-parish money gets spent. So, if you're claiming that they had no say in the matter, that's not true. They had as much say as anyone else who lives in this parish and has the right to vote.   it's childish to wrong the unincorporated area for the blunder   I'm not at all advocating ""wronging"" anyone, and I'm not blaming St. George supporters for the city-parish's decision to invest in the infrastructure of the unincorporated area. I'm just saying that it's ridiculous for them to claim that their tax dollars are being stolen, as if that sales tax belongs exclusively to them. I'm saying that the incorporation movement relies on sales tax revenues that are possible because of city-parish investments, and they should be honest about that instead of making this dishonest argument that they are victims that are somehow being stolen from."
batonrouge,39rgmg,MeanBrad,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:47:55 2015 UTC,"Saying, ""things can't get any worse""   I'm not saying they can't get worse.  I'm saying that they can't get much worse.  Especially realistically.   So, if you're claiming that they had no say in the matter, that's not true.    Not necessarily my entire point, though I was questioning that.  What I was getting at was that it doesn't matter if you the unincorporated area was represented (well) or not, or even if there was an actual vote that involved citizens.  In the end, for someone else to vote on what happens with my property and then get mad when citizens are petitioning to vote on what happens with our property is utterly absurd.  If the Metro Council can vote to take away my property (money) to spend on things I don't agree with (amongst things I might agree with), then I certainly have the right to vote and do the same.  In my example, what if you'd have petitioned the neighbors and the owner of the house, and the vote was 4-1 that I should cut the person's grass.  The homeowner got outvoted.  Should I really expect him to pay me for mowing his lawn, something he didn't want and voted against?  There are many pitfalls to democracy.  This is one of them.   I'm just saying that it's ridiculous for them to claim that their tax dollars are being stolen, as if that sales tax belongs exclusively to them. I'm saying that the incorporation movement relies on sales tax revenues that are possible because of city-parish investments, and they should be honest about that instead of making this dishonest argument that they are victims that are somehow being stolen from.   I honestly don't pay much attention to the pro-St. George movement, except for the handful of times I've visited their Facebook page and website just to see what was going on, since I do technically live in the area.  Most of what I know about it comes from this subreddit, which is very vehemently opposed to the incorporation of that area into a new city.  What I'm getting at is that I don't really know what those people say, and if what you are saying is correct, I can't fault you for wanting them to be honest, for sure.  However, would you really be any more satisfied if they did admit that, and still wanted to incorporate?    The fact of the matter is, if I leaned strongly toward St. George's incorporation, and truly felt that EBR parish government didn't have my best interests at heart - nor the interests of my neighbors - my property is mine and I would sign the petition and vote accordingly, should it come to a vote, or move (people being educated here and then moving being a problem that is plaguing the city, as I've mentioned).  Could you really blame me?  I'm sure there are many people in the St. George area that are in that exact situation, that aren't being dishonest or racist or whatever."

batonrouge,39rgmg,prewfrock,7,Sun Jun 14 14:21:01 2015 UTC,"Before Zachary's departure from the EBR school system, their public-school-going population was 70% white, and 70% middle-class (defined as not being on free or reduced lunch). Zachary had some of the highest-performing general admissions schools in the state of Louisiana. It is/was no surprise to anybody that if you picked those schools out and made them their own district, it'd be also quite high-performing.  Similarly, Central's public-school-going population was about 80% white, and 60% middle-class when it departed, and it got even whiter and more middle-class because they no longer had to accept kids from Glen Oaks, which touched the southeast corner of the Central school district.   Meanwhile, St. George's public-school-going-population is about 30% white and about 30% middle-class - all of the rest of the school age kids in St. George attend private schools.    There's an assumption that once St. George gets its own city and school district, that private school parents would take their kids out of private schools and enroll them in majority-minority, majority-poor St. George schools. There is precisely no reason to believe that would be the case.  Moreover, roughly half of those middle-class kids in St. George attend magnet schools inside the city of Baton Rouge. Without them, the white and middle-class population of the St. George school system drops to around 15-18%. I cannot imagine many of those parents sticking through the transition to neighborhood St. George schools.  And, they're still on the hook for several hundred million in new school construction.  In other words, they:   create a new city create a new school district end up with a school system nearly as poor and black as the one they left and  now have no magnet schools,  and a ton of new taxes to pay off school construction costs   Trainwreck."
batonrouge,39rgmg,SoyBotones,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:50:34 2015 UTC,"and a ton of new taxes to pay off school construction costs   The St.George FB page disputed this point, but I never understood their argument. It seemed like they thought that the money for this would come from some overarching budget -- excuse my ignorance I'm not sure how these things work -- such as perhaps a Parish or state budget."
batonrouge,39rgmg,spmlsu,3,Sun Jun 14 17:11:25 2015 UTC,"St. George said they might be able to pull off no additional cost for regular city services (police, fire, road maintenance, etc) - and they'd likely be able to do it with level - or only slightly raised taxes.  However, there are only 7 extant schools in the proposed city - with a capacity of about 6,000 (IIRC), which would mean they'd need to build out enough schools to house an additional 5,000 students. (right now this doesn't matter because most of the students go to schools within 2-3 miles of their homes anyway, and many of those are schools right inside the city limits, like Wedgwood or Parkview Elementary).  So, they'd need to come up with construction bonds to handle the construction of new schools.  What they said was that they'd (somehow) use some mechanism of the law to say that they had a new school district which:   Got all 7 schools in the St. George city limits (Jefferson Terrace, River Oaks, Westminster, Shenandoah, and the 3 Woodlawns) But also collected every single school between I-10 and I-12 (Parkview Elementary, Cedarcrest Elementary, Wedgewood Elementary, and Southeast Middle) - Even though those schools are inside the City of Baton Rouge    They would say that the Southeast School District (passed in 2013 - but never funded) and the City of St. George School District (never came to vote) would be one and the same thing.  They'd have no legal precedent for it... but it didn't stop them from saying it. More on that here."
batonrouge,39rgmg,SoyBotones,0,Sun Jun 14 19:47:36 2015 UTC,"While it's true that a lot of that area is poor, a larger area is not.  And I never heard any of my friends that send their kids to St. George or St Jude talk about pulling their kids out.  I did hear people talk about out moving into that area which is what I think would have happened.    And just because your poor and black doesn't mean you can't have a good school system.  The key is getting those schools out of the hands of the school board and giving principals a chance to improve....the EBRPSS is broken.  You don't need special magnet schools at that size.  Zachary and Central don't have individual schools, they have programs within the schools.  I never looked at their budget so I don't know how they're paying for the schools."
batonrouge,39rgmg,spmlsu,2,Sun Jun 14 15:27:29 2015 UTC,"While it's true that a lot of that area is poor, a larger area is not.    Public school quality is not a function of total population, it's a function of the total school-age population that is presently attending public schools. The majority of the growth in the St. George area has come from low-income black and Hispanic families who are replacing middle-aged, middle-class white families.   And I never heard any of my friends that send their kids to St. George or St Jude talk about pulling their kids out. I did hear people talk about out moving into that area which is what I think would have happened.   It's all just talk. To achieve Zachary or Central style results, you'll need Zachary or Central-style demographics, which means that at least four thousand families will have to pull their kids out of private schools and send them to public schools.  That is never going to happen.  Moreover, the entire area is getting poorer, very quickly, this is due to aging and declining and undesirable housing stock and the rapid proliferation of federally subsidized housing throughout the area.   And just because your poor and black doesn't mean you can't have a good school system.   Please provide me an example of a school system that is at least 70% poor and 70% black and is highly rated.   The key is getting those schools out of the hands of the school board and giving principals a chance to improve....the EBRPSS is broken.   Principals have negligible impact on student performance.Teachers, principals, and school boards combined have a minimal impact compared to student demographics. You can safely predict 75% of district score by free/reduced lunch status alone.    I never looked at their budget so I don't know how they're paying for the schools.   It will require between 5 and 7 new schools, which run $15-30 million a piece."

batonrouge,39rgmg,SoyBotones,3,Sun Jun 14 17:56:18 2015 UTC,"First sentence:    Public school quality is not a function of total population, it's a function of the total school-age population that is presently attending public schools.   Even if SG voters are 70% white, most of the white kids go to private school. And it seems reallllly unlikely that thousands of families would suddenly pull their kids out of private school, especially when the new public schools wouldn't be built for several more years."

The largest single predictor in school quality is median household income (it predicts at least 75% of performance), the second largest is admissions selectivity - there's effectively nothing teachers, principals, and school systems can do after the age of 5 to improve test scores."

The Warwick on Jefferson Hwy has housing in your budget, but otherwise it may be tough to get that price with utilities.

I haven't heard a single person from the public or the council, aside from maybe a couple of Facebook commenters, say the officers shouldn't have cameras. It's just a matter of timing and funding - Marcelle, who proposed the ordinance, thinks it's such a high priority that we need to do it ASAP, while the others want to wait and see how the pilot program plays out.  FWIW, the vote was split pretty much along racial lines -- the four who voted in favor of requiring the cameras are black (out of five black council members)"

It's dumb questions like ""I have never lied to my parents"" or ""I have never stolen anything from my place of employment"" etc etc. If you go in to fill out an app, dress nice, you don't need a suit and tie, but look presentable and if you turn in your app to a manager, shake their hand, thank them, and make eye contact. It can go a long way.   If I can think of anywhere else in particular, I'll update. In the meantime, check with restaurants, they usually could use the help with busing tables or dishwasher.

You're 18, so employers aren't expecting you to actually be worth a shit, just enthusiastic, energetic and punctual."

You have a much better shot if you're availability is open. I'd recommend filling out an application and asking the manager directly if they are hiring/telling them you're interested in a job. Dress nice, be polite, and act intelligent, no matter where you apply. Good luck."

The company I work for is currently looking for helpers of any kind. Green helpers with no experience make about 18 an hour, but you do get plenty of OT. That's where I would go if I needed to make decent money really fast, and possibly pick up a trade.   I know there is a huge construction project going on at CF Industries that is being orchestrated by Excel Group. Go to excels office on Airline and apply.  Source: I work there"

The office is in the back of the building and its a room with a little window you have to talk to the people on the other side.  ALSO, it wouldn't hurt to try your luck at MMR which is another electrical company and its right across the street. Just pass by and leave them your name.   Good luck."
batonrouge,398iyf,Vince_Taylor,6,Wed Jun 10 00:53:35 2015 UTC,"Lake After Hours some are open until 11. If she does end up needing to go to the ER, go to Baton Rouge General on Bluebonnet, IMO they're usually faster than OLOL.  I asked a friend who works in a pharmacy and we double checked with a pharmacist - and if she needs it tonight: if the pharmacy where she has her RX is 24 hours, call the pharmacy when she lands and have them transfer the RX to a 24 hour pharmacy here in Baton Rouge (I would call the local pharmacies here first to make sure they have it in stock- see short list below). Her pharmacy will transfer the RX here for her.  It has to be the pharmacy where she currently has the rx in VA. If the pharmacy is not 24 hours, and she needs it tonight, and you missed the after hours, go to the ER.  Also, if her insurance doesn't cover down here, most After Hours will treat it like non-insurance visit and she'll have to pay the whole visit out of pocket, where as the ER may ask for a copay, then bill you.   If it is not an emergency and she does not need it tonight, first thing in the morning she can call her pharmacy and have them transfer the RX to whichever pharmacy here she asks.   Heads up, if her insurance will only allow the rx to be filled every X amount of days, she may have to pay the entire cost upfront, but she may be able to call the insurance company and explain the situation, and ask if there is anything she can submit to get reimbursement or a discount.   Walgreens stores that are open 24 hours in Baton Rouge, there are only 2, but the one on Essen by the Lake is actually open 6am-12am every day, it used to be 24 hours.   There is one CVS with a 24 hour pharmacy  good luck"

batonrouge,398iyf,bgwhtdg,3,Wed Jun 10 21:21:07 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't venture in any direction outside of the airport. Have her wait until she gets into Baton Rouge proper, most Walgreens are open 24 hours."
batonrouge,398iyf,DBTFan,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:21:42 2015 UTC,She mentioned she needs a doc appointment and something about copayment - do you know if they can they provide these services at Walgreens?
batonrouge,398iyf,KlfJoat,4,Wed Jun 10 01:48:54 2015 UTC,No. She should go to any Lake after Hours clinic. Can get seen and new Rx.
batonrouge,398iyf,____G____,3,Wed Jun 10 01:58:26 2015 UTC,"Nurse friend told me there's no after hours clinic open past 10pm in BR. She's screwed until morning, except for the ER.   Depending on the inhaler, she might be able to get something similar but less effective at the drug store.   Rumor is that some pharmacists can issue certain medications on their own.   I'm pretty sure that if she uses Walgreens or CVS in her hometown, she may be able to go there and get it based on her existing prescription.   Good luck!"
batonrouge,398iyf,____G____,2,Wed Jun 10 02:24:21 2015 UTC,"Dude Baton Rouge isn't that backwards, just have her doctor call in a prescription to any one of a number of rite-aids, walgreens, and CVSs all of which take yes... insurance and know how copays work.  Tell her to be extra careful that she doesnt step on a crocodile tails on the way in, and tell her that if she is in a hurry she can always take the air boat through the drive through.    But seriously dude it's Louisiana, USA not Louisiana, Tunisia just follow the standard rules and procedures for an American who needs another inhaler just like you would at home and for GOD SAKES don't try it in Mississippi.  If she has a current inhaler she must have a prescription/doctor so call that guy, I'm sure he won't decide to consign her to a slow chocking death because she couldn't make it in for an appointment, but who knows you might be from Delaware."

batonrouge,398iyf,ThrowGoToGo,2,Wed Jun 10 21:27:16 2015 UTC,No idea if this helps but there is a VA clinic off Essen Lane. Pretty postive I've seen people fill RX's while at the clin as well.  Otherwise there a billion urgent care clinics through out the city.
