wallpapers,3dueio,ryhann,16,Mon Jul 20 04:17:58 2015 UTC,"The local Pitjantjatjara people call the landmark Uluṟu (Aboriginal pronunciation: [uluɻu]). This word has no further particular meaning in the Pitjantjatjara language, although it is used as a local family name by the senior Traditional Owners of Uluru.[2]  On 19 July 1873, the surveyor William Gosse sighted the landmark and named it Ayers Rock in honour of the then Chief Secretary of South Australia, Sir Henry Ayers.[3] Since then, both names have been used.  In 1993, a dual naming policy was adopted that allowed official names that consist of both the traditional Aboriginal name and the English name. On 15 December 1993, it was renamed ""Ayers Rock / Uluru"" and became the first official dual-named feature in the Northern Territory. The order of the dual names was officially reversed to ""Uluru / Ayers Rock"" on 6 November 2002 following a request from the Regional Tourism Association in Alice Springs.[4]   I remember when I was in primary school in the late 80s and early 90s it was commonly referred to as Ayers Rock, but since then it is more commonly just called Uluru. So technically both names are correct but if you want what it is ""mostly"" called it'd be Uluru."

However I think it's bull shit. If you name something and you make it world famous and everybody knows what it's called, you don't suddenly change the name. We aren't going to change the Grand Canyon because some people call it the Kind Of Impressive Canyon."

It's just that Australia has basically decided that it's only right to call it by the name it was given by Australia's Indigenous population, seeing as it holds significant importance and value to them. It's not that we suddenly decided to change it because we thought it would be fun to fuck with people so that they wouldn't know what to refer to it as."

wallpapers,3dueio,mcdrunkin,17,Mon Jul 20 04:46:07 2015 UTC,Because its an incredibly important place to indigenous Australians and we don't want to offend them by calling it the incorrect name.
wallpapers,3dueio,vforbatman,14,Mon Jul 20 04:51:03 2015 UTC,"More importantly I think is that it costs nothing to be respectful in this case.   Anyway which name would you prefer, the one it has had since the first human associated a sound with it, repeated by generations of their people for hundreds of years before anybody else even laid eyes upon it, or the one given to it by an English land surveyor in 1873 who was kissing the arse of some chief state secretary of a state the landmark isn't even in?  On a simple scale of which of two options is more deserving of a little respect that costs nothing to give; Australian history is littered with such occurrences. I'm of English decent and not overly fond of being too politically correct for it's own sake, but holy shit did a lot of very white people do some very stupid shit in this country."

wallpapers,3dueio,loulan,24,Sun Jul 19 21:43:48 2015 UTC,I guess it has to do with the fact that it's considered a sacred place by the native tribes.

It's a natural landmark (and quite a significant one) so why do they get to claim it? What if local Nepalese, who had been living in Nepal for 1000s if years, said that Mt.

wallpapers,3dujqy,FreemanDave,3,Mon Jul 20 00:19:35 2015 UTC,"This is almost certainly Agnes from Bravely Default. This is her default clothing, which she wears when her job is Freelancer. When you change jobs for a character, they wear different clothing, presumably so the player knows what jobs they have in a battle at a glance, rather than looking into each individual character's sheet.  After a second look, and a comparison, I'm no longer sure, though. Anges doesn't have a hat as a Freelancer, and her cape goes over her shoulders, rather than stopping at them. So, might be OC.  Just checked Google (as Tineye and iqdb were unusually unhelpful). This appears to be the original artist. They have the original there, and a similar picture, and the art style looks the same. It's also been posted to their Facebook profile, with the title ""Magician."""

I also notice that you can purchase FB likes, and which means to me that information can be easily bought and manipulated.   The fact that the people who are wearing masks think they are hidden, are not, makes me think that the majority of people think they are safe.   The cameras I guess could mean the people have a false sense of security.  Finally the guy half way in the sewer actually wants to be hidden and his online activity to be hard to find, or rather at least hard to find him. The spot light fixated on him tells me that is the person they want to find, they want everyone out in the open, with no privacy or secrets at all.   I could single out minor details but this is a general gist of what I think."

Late August our early September will give you beautiful colors and crisp air. And no fucking mosquitoes and the like. I guess October is fine as well but it might be a but on the cold side and perhaps a risk for blizzards  I'd say Sweden is a nice place to visit, especially if you're in to nature, hiking and the like. The water is fresh and pure in virtually all the little lashes, streams and rivers, especially in the mountains.

Smog is always an issue in Tokyo, especially in the summer time.

wallpapers,3d4o1u,protitht,8,Mon Jul 13 17:11:04 2015 UTC,"I've been reading a lot about eating wild foods for survival and came across an article by Samuel Thayer, who wrote foragers harvest. He argues that Jonathan Krakauer made up the potato seed bit for his own narrative purposes.   It goes on to say that if that kid had been supposedly eating wild carrots and then suddenly started eating the seeds instead or ate something that had a similar leaf but no carrot at all that would be akin to Krakauer assertion. There would be no reason this kid who had been eating the same plant for months would mistakenly eat an entirely different and poisonous plant. He concluded that the idea was preposterous and that very few people die from eating wild foods. I believe he suggested what caused the boys death was simple starvation.   Edit: aforementioned article"

wallpapers,3d4o1u,MrCompletely,2,Mon Jul 13 18:33:52 2015 UTC,"Merry Pranksters:       The Merry Pranksters were a group of people who formed around American author Ken Kesey in 1964. The group promoted the use of psychedelic drugs, then still legal.  Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters lived communally at Kesey's homes in California and Oregon, and are noted for the sociological significance of a lengthy road trip they took in the summer of 1964, traveling across the United States in a psychedelic painted school bus called ""Furthur"" or ""Further"". During this time they met many of the guiding lights of the mid 60's cultural movement and presaged what is commonly thought of as ""hippies"" with odd behavior, long hair on men, bizarre clothing, and a renunciation of the normal society, which they dubbed, ""The Establishment"". Tom Wolfe chronicled their early escapades in The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test; Wolfe also documents a notorious 1966 trip on Further from Mexico through Houston, stopping to visit Kesey's friend, novelist Larry McMurtry. Kesey was in flight from a drug charge at the time.   Notable members of the group include Kesey's best friend Ken Babbs, Carolyn ""Mountain Girl"" Garcia, and Neal Cassady. Stewart Brand, Paul Foster, the Warlocks (now known as the Grateful Dead), Del Close (then a lighting designer for the Grateful Dead), Wavy Gravy, Paul Krassner, and ""Kentucky Fab Five"" writers Ed McClanahan and Gurney Norman (who overlapped with Kesey and Babbs as creative writing graduate students at Stanford University) were associated with the group to varying degrees. [citation needed]  These events are also documented by one of the original pranksters, Lee Quarnstrom, in his memoir titled When I Was a Dynamiter.

This is pretty obvious, but I do know that even in the summer the desert can get pretty cold at night, much colder than during the day, because of all the open sky.

It's that simple.  The realism of the design in relation to a mockingjay had no bearing on their decision as she is already associated with the mockingjay and can therefore don a more striking look to be more impactful. They wanted her to look impressive and intimidating so the rest was built around that idea. I think it is well done!"
