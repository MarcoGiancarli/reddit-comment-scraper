ExNoContact,3e2wzc,WATisISO,2,Tue Jul 21 15:28:13 2015 UTC,This is a great article! I had no idea that love is really equatable to nicotine and cocaine in the brain! That's actually really cool and explains why breakups hurt so much
ExNoContact,3e2wzc,Gutsyisland,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:31:44 2015 UTC,"I know right?! For the longest time I thought I was ""addicted"" to my ex, but no one else seemed to understand.   Fortunately, science came to my rescue!"
ExNoContact,3e2wzc,Needtotrythis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:37:25 2015 UTC,"the painful feelings usually fade away over the course of about six months to two years   Does anyone have experience in this area with a long-term relationship?  It's been 2 1/2 months since the end of a six year relationship, and I am in the same amount of pain today as I was in during the first few days after the break up.  In your case how long did it take for the pain to lessen?"
ExNoContact,3e2wzc,Needtotrythis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:43:53 2015 UTC,"In my experience it started whenever I let it.   My ex and I were on again, off again starting in 2010. We finally officially ended things in 2012. I was constantly letting myself get sucked back into thinking about her in a romantic way. I would let myself get totally caught up in the chemical/addictive side of things.   That continued until about 2-3 months ago. I decided that I was sick of feeling sad/sorry for myself and that I had no choice but to move on.   I can't speak for everyone, but I know that she's happy with someone else and made all of the decisions to make that happen. There's no reason to sit and constantly hope someone will return, when they've already moved on.   Also, to answer your question directly - less than 3 months after a 6 year relationship is a perfectly normal mourning period."

ExNoContact,3e2wzc,Needtotrythis,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:21:43 2015 UTC,"I'm saying this as much for me as for you. (9 year relationship) I'm 9 months after breakup, 6 months after I found out it was because of another woman. I did various versions of desperation, no contact, desperation/begging/pleading, no contact, emailing to no-reply, no contact. Its been about 2 months of real no contact. It will take a while.   Â   My friend died in high school from meningitis. I mourned him for a year. My ex meant the world to me. I never stopped loving him even when things were rough between us. Its going to take me a while. My only advice to you is to not let other people's journeys make you feel badly about yours. Everyone is different. I fully believe that certain people are capable of greater depth of emotion (and I believe a lot of them are here in exnocontact). Take your time."
ExNoContact,3e2wzc,Suckerforpain,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:45:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you, and geez, 9 years, I thought that 6 years was long. I've gone through several stages of desperation (like trying to play games to get him to want to get back together and begging), but that was before complete NC and I'm hoping to avoid other desperate acts. The article stated 6 months - 2 years, and I was was wondering if I could possibly be better in 2 years (I'm not expecting 6 months or less). This is my second 6 year relationship breakup, but the first was obviously different, as is every relationship. This time I know that it will take much longer to feel better. I'm just hoping that I will feel better in two years. Do you mind if I ask how you feel after two months of complete NC - is it better than the first 6-7 months? (My ex doesn't seem to understand why we can't be friends.)"
ExNoContact,3e4dp8,frowayacc,12,Tue Jul 21 21:31:51 2015 UTC,"Here's the interesting thing about going NC... It helps everything. Literally. Let's say hypothetically that she wants to get back with you. You think sending one goodbye text to her would deter her from that? Let's say hypothetically that she doesn't want to get back together. Do you think you're helping her more by being her friend? Do you think you're helping yourself by being her friend when you want more? Tough decisions have to be made in love. My ex and I have always been friends over like 6-7 years. We've dated, broke up. Hooked up. Dated for a year, traveled the world, and broke up again. I won't be her friend. She doesn't deserve my friendship. These people in our lives that have seemingly given up on our relationship with them should not be able to have the best part of you, the thing that makes you, you. Think about this. Why does she not want to be in a relationship with you? Why does she not want to have that physical connection with you? Because she wants something else, right? Here's where it gets tricky, and also hilarious. Physical connections can be made between anyone. What can't be made between two people is the connection you forged over the course of years. So the people who want to ""try to be friends"" are literally wanting to have that connection of friendship without the commitment of a relationship. Why would you give that to her? My last meeting with my ex I sat there and explained this, and I refuse to give her the thing that makes me unique. The thing I've spent my life becoming - the person I am. She threw that away when she gave up on us. Now I'm giving up on her, and I'm glad."
ExNoContact,3e4dp8,Acquittal,2,Tue Jul 21 21:43:26 2015 UTC,I guess I haven't thought about it this way. Thanks it really helps to get someone elses perspective! Im happy for you that you are moving on! 100 days tomorrow :)

Now all that is left is the process.  And it sucks.  I am there with you brother.  Your story is similar to mine except I did try after the initial break up to bring her around.  It did not work.  All you can do is walk.  And if you harbor feelings for her you can not be friends.  I am at 30 days and have my doubts still today with posts of wonder.  In the end all I can tell myself is that if it was worth it to her, she would try.  I will not be only one to put in the effort.  Relationships need to be two way, not one."
ExNoContact,3e4dp8,lightning_crashes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:46:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah it felt good to have one last say. I tried to be honest and I really meant it when I told her that I wish her all the best in the future.  If she in the end wants it, nothing is stopping her from reaching out. That is true.

And the feelings will be msgnified because your life is changing in a big way. It's not just him you miss, it's who you were back then. What'll help, is loving who you are now, too.

I'll never get closure.   The way I see it is that I dealt her the best cards and she played the shittiest hand.
ExNoContact,3e3edn,Eesybakeoven21,2,Tue Jul 21 17:29:09 2015 UTC,"The sad truth is that you're never gonna get those answers. Her actions spoke the truth, and ultimately it's up to you to create your own closure. I'm sorry. Try not to compare yourself to your replacement, because it doesn't matter what he has or doesn't have, because from the sounds of it, she settled, and there's nothing to envy there. She's gone now, and she's on her own. If she's only got one pic of him up, she's probably not planning on keeping him very long, and that's so crappy of her.  She lost someone terrific, and that's her loss."

The more strenuous the exercise, the bigger release. But, saying that, even a brisk walk will get your blood pumping and get you on the path to being a fitter, happier and healthier version of yourself.

The BU happened nearly 2 months ago, NC 24 days ago.   Time and distance is certainly helping. Since the BU, I've been on 2 holidays and slept with other women which has raised my self esteem. But I know I can't get in another relationship right now because I'll just end up hurting someone innocent.  Part of me knows I'm a fucking idiot for even toying with the idea of getting back with my emotionally manipulative miserable depressed ex. I'm struggling with detaching."

ExNoContact,3e2r5i,hulksmashheartsmash,2,Tue Jul 21 15:41:51 2015 UTC,"This here is the main issue; not knowing how to feel. There is no set way to feel, at a set time.   Try to move away from the mental goals of being in a certain place by a certain time. Of feeling a certain way.   You're setting yourself up for further disappointment by trying to be 'over her' in 3/6/9/12 months.   The moment you stop tethering yourself to a timeline, the easier things become. You will move past this, stronger and more resilient, when you're ready to. Don't force it. Live for the moment and enjoy the small things in life; sunsets, staring at the sky on a cloydless night, the feel of a cool breeze on your face.   There will be constant reminders of your ex (hell, making a cup if tea reminds me if mine), but don't think about what's been lost.

You sound very strong right now and I think that comes from the pride you have gained from turning your back on someone who disrespected you and took you for granted. I did exactly the same thing as you have, and it will be four months tomorrow since I begun to pretend he doesn't exist. It has gone so fast, but I am a different person now because of it.  I completely understand where you are coming from as my dad was diagnosed with cancer one week after my break up. What it has shown me is that no matter what life throws at me, you get through it and become stronger on the other side.  You will get through this patch too. Perhaps try talking this through with your brother, it seems as if he is blocking it out, which isn't healthy.   I'm from the UK too! Glad to know there's someone from my home turf on here.

The dream seems to mean you're ready for a relationship, but are picking up some natural hesitancy from your new love interest.

Did he reply to your message staying you knew her information?   IMO, realizing you may be going overboard means you're probably NOT the crazy ex. If you were, you'd think you were totally justified and nothing was wrong. So, start no contact and if he tries getting in touch with you tell the new girl. It's not fair to her that he's stringing you on and she deserves to know."

She may think that all men are like this and take a ""don't ask, don't tell"" approach because she thinks it's better than being alone.

I'm at roughly 4 and a half months of being broken up from a bit over two year relationship. And I'm still trying to work through my own issues stemming from the breakup. But I promise you it does get easier with more time. Just don't be so hard on yourself.   However long it takes you to feel even slightly better is however long it takes you. There's nothing wrong with that. Breakups are one of the most stressful events a human can go through. Don't be hard on yourself for feeling the way you feel."

ExNoContact,3dz3vx,rosemarily,4,Mon Jul 20 18:27:51 2015 UTC,Doesn't seem unhealthy. If looking at his social media helps you move on without too much pain then go with that. To each his own! In the end you know yourself the best. As long as it's not an urge or a craving or a way to keep him in your life somehow.  Don't waste your energy planning what you're gonna do in 30 or 60 days though. I went through this too but you'll see when you get there. Maybe it won't matter anymore. It shouldn't matter now.
ExNoContact,3dz3vx,marine_ago,4,Mon Jul 20 19:19:42 2015 UTC,"And just come to terms with the fact that his world exists without me, and mine exists without him, and that's okay   This is key. Ultimately I think this is the goal of NC: to accept and move on. It's very easy to get fixated on the specifics of ""mustn't break NC!"", and while that is important, it's equally important to keep perspective of why.   ""And that's okay"" is something I've found myself appending to a lot of things, and it's been really helpful. No birthday text...and that's okay. No <old habit>...and that's okay. Seeing someone else...and that's okay. It becomes more than just a phrase, but an attitude for dealing with things you can't control. Obviously it varies from person to person (and situation to situation), but I think your attitude is a good one OP."
ExNoContact,3dz3vx,GravityGilly,3,Mon Jul 20 19:31:41 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, the relationship is done.  Your ex has their own life, they can post, talk to anyone, go anywhere they want.  I know it is VERY tempting to look at social media and keep up to date with them, but you are forcing yourself to be apart of the Viscous Loop.  Ex Social Media Account --> Feeling down --> Remembering Good times --> Wanting those times back --> Upset, crying, begging for another shot --> What if, What if's --> Repeat.  I do not agree with your scheduling of unblocking, and not re-adding etc, etc.  It is exhausting, you need to cut all ties, and focus on yourself.  I suggest blocking your ex on instagram, so he cant see your photos, and just make your fb private, no need to block, just unfriend them thats what I did.  My ex sent me a fb message, I ignored it, then she blocked me,.....then recently unblocked me... lol.  Let them do some work.  Everything takes TIME: Looking at social media will go from every hour of the day, to 5 times a day, to once/twice a day, to once in a while.  You broke up how long ago and he is already on Okcupid?  Don't sweat it, OkCupid is lame, one woman will get 100000s of emails, so he better look like Brad Pitt or be a multi-millionaire.    But enough about him, focus on you, do things that YOU want to do.  Dont sit at home and mope because you are single.  Dont focus on ""Oh I made it 2 weeks NC!"" You should be looking forward and thinking where am I going to be in 2 weeks, what will I be doing in 2 weeks?  Are there any fun events?  Get of social media!!  Social Media is full of people seeking attention and posting HAPPY HAPPY fun times.  The more photos, the bigger the psychological problems I have seen in my opinion.  Go work, go workout, go find some cool local patios/coffee shops, meet up with friends.  You do NOT need to go and start looking for your next fling, bf/gf etc, this is NOT a race of who will get over who first.  Forget what he is doing, its done.  If you talk to him, you wont get answers, exes will not tell you the real reason why they did what they did, etc.  Hope this helps.   PS: Read my recent post https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/3dwsqb/there_actually_is_hope_progress_and_healing_long/  This will give you a good idea what 114 days looks like when you GET OFF YOUR BUTT :D :D :D and focus on you!"
ExNoContact,3dz3vx,Ola_Kala,2,Mon Jul 20 20:52:09 2015 UTC,"I thought the same... I thought it was healing.  What it was though, for me, was comforting.  In retrospect, it enabled me to have a window into his life and helped to keep me stuck for a year.  I blocked a ""friend"" once, after they turned toxic (long story).  Still blocked, two years later, but until this convo, I hadn't even remembered that wall was there. It only feels restricting if it's stopping you from doing what you want, I think <hugs>"
ExNoContact,3dz3vx,BTMask,2,Mon Jul 20 19:25:10 2015 UTC,"I was actually thinking about this same exact thing this morning. After 5 months of NC, I went to look up her Tumblr, only to see that she'd deactivated it at some point this month. I, too, question whether or not it would ""free"" me to not live with the blockades that I've created. I feel like I would have benefitted from the ridiculous bullshit that I would have seen on her social media. Who knows? I wish I knew how to advise you. And myself."

You're never gonna find the answers you're looking for, and it doesn't matter what's going on in his life these days. There's no point in keeping yourself updated on someone who cared so little about you to the point you found us.   Stop keeping yourself updated on him. You're not putting up walls around your entire life. It only feels that way because he meant the world to you, and creating an identity without him is probably unfamiliar to you right now. What you're doing is putting up a wall around him instead of around yourself."
ExNoContact,3dz3vx,lightning_crashes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:05:58 2015 UTC,"I feel a similar way. Although I've had zero contact, including social media, for 3 weeks now, I honestly think I would feel better if I checked her facebook at least. I still care about her. I'd like to see her happy, even without me. I honestly don't think I'd be upset if I saw her relationship status changed... or maybe it would devastate me, who knows.  All I know is a miss her, and I feel like looking at her on facebook would at least let me keep in touch with her life. I, too, am worried that it will ultimately end up unhealthy and ruin my progress."
ExNoContact,3dz3vx,testing84123,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:46:47 2015 UTC,"I found it necessary for me to block my ex on all fronts, and not long into starting NC, found that I had to purge my social media of all of our mutual friends as well, as they were doing things, posting about it, and I'd still be seeing her.  I'm two weeks in and, though I miss her, I'm the better for it. I'm glad I took those measures. And as those two weeks have passed, I've felt less and less tempted to reverse course and go take a peek.  I'm hoping down the road, I can remove all these blocks, and maybe we can be friends again - but I'm not going to get ahead of myself."

She calls the cops and they have to talk to me about harassment even though I am not harassing her or even illegally, as I could see from their rolled eyes and annoyed they have to be there. They have to follow through though, I mean wow. Just wow!    I now take myself bike riding, read more and know to stay away from someone so manipulative, vindictive and scary."

ExNoContact,3dzyzv,Acquittal,2,Mon Jul 20 22:09:13 2015 UTC,"Go NC for awhile. I dated a guy,  similar situation, for two years. We went nc for about a year. We always got along great but broke up because we were at different places (corny I know but he was a bit older). Since we were able to both heal from the breakup we now have a good relationship. We don't go out of our way to hang out or talk but we kind of run in the same group of friends and can now be at the same place without it being weird anymore. We are back to being friends. I think if we hadn't gone no contact until we each got over it this wouldn't be at all possible. Best of luck, it's never easy"
ExNoContact,3dzyzv,DVOL13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:26:47 2015 UTC,"You are doing exactly the right thing in deciding to not see her again and block her and cease communications.  It is not selfish.  You do not want to be 'on call' for her, you don't want to be around her, and rightly so, and you should not feel bad or guilty in the slightest for feeling this way or acting on those feelings by dropping her from your life.    You know that if you stay in contact by messaging or meeting up, she will cross boundaries that will make you feel hurt and upset, and this will stop you from doing what you need to do - putting it in the past and moving on.  You do not need to apologise for standing up for yourself, so I advise against texting her that, or indeed ever again (at least for a good while).    You've broken up, you have zero responsibility for her and her emotions and feelings.  She's going to be upset because it's a breakup. Leave her alone to feel that and don't come running if she texts you all upset - that's her new boy's job.  You have zero obligation to do anything for her ever again, there's nothing in this situation left for you.  She can't have her cake and eat it too.  You're gone, and she needs to cope with that by herself.   Think about what you've learnt about her from meeting up post break up (she's disrespectful of both your and her new boy's boundaries, for example) and realise that her behaviour will not change.  The only way to get out of this mess is to literally get out and have nothing more to do with it.    So basically this was a long winded way of saying that cutting her off is the right thing to do, putting yourself first is the right thing to do, and keep going.  and congrats on the job!! :D :D"

Yes you are absolutely right, and I don't want to be in that position where I have to be responsible for her feelings. I was ""nice"" after the break up NC, and just letting her do her thing while I did mine. She contacted me because she wanted this amazing connection we have without the work or commitment to keeping it. I will not dog down, and I will not give in. She's well aware of the 4 year NC I had with my previous ex, and I'm not just going to sit by, and watch her push my boundaries because it makes her feel good. I wish she knew how bad she fucked up, and I wish I could spew the venom to call her out on it. But I said my peace last time we met up. Told her she was selfish, that she only lasts 8 months because that's all she's good for, and to go be friends with your other ex's because I am not here to comfort your life. My fucking life now!"

Time for reality to smack her in the face a bit and NC is the perfect way to achieve this.  Heck even if she doesn't wake up from dreamland, who cares - its 100% not your problem cos she isn't in your life anymore!  We all dream of telling our ex exactly what we think of them, but its always best to drop it and move on.

I said to him, how did I feel then, don't you think I was sad?  He said I'm.sure you were but I never saw it, all I ever saw was you acting."

ExNoContact,3dxqt0,Shin280891,2,Mon Jul 20 12:07:40 2015 UTC,Good for you!  I have healed more in the last 9 days of NC than I did during the first two months after the breakup.  You can do it!  Congrats on the great decision!
ExNoContact,3dxqt0,Needtotrythis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:40:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks! It IS a great decision... If it wasn't for her text stating she was actually ""glad to see me today, but it made her sad seeing me so cold to her and that she expected a kiss, but I didn't kiss her, and so we're probably not meant to be together indeed, good luck""... And I am almost buying this! Because she WAS happy or appeared to be genuinely happy, anyway! Or was she just pretending? If so, I can't believe she is such a hypocrite...I just don't know anymore, but she can manipulate me so easily... All she has to say in response to my ""I guess we're not meant to be, good luck"" is ""OK then... it's a shame though, I thought we could finally reconcile, but it's too late now... Good luck"", or basically anything to make it look like I am the one who did something wrong and was cold, whereas she was the one to dump me to start with! And when we were still together she would be cold to me and I wouldn't blame her for anything. But it was almost a month ago now, so I am forgetting the bad stuff, I guess... Look at how easily she can trigger me, I have already written a comment longer than my original post lol."
ExNoContact,3dxqt0,Needtotrythis,2,Mon Jul 20 18:16:09 2015 UTC,"It's tough.  It seems like her actions have a strong effect on you, which for me would make it difficult to focus on myself.  Keep reminding yourself that you are doing NC for you, and not to get a reaction from her (no matter what types of games she's trying to play by saying that you're cold and good luck)."
ExNoContact,3dxqt0,flebag,2,Mon Jul 20 20:49:27 2015 UTC,"I feel you so much. It is so hard knowing your ex's actions still have power over you. I know mine effects me like that. Keep NC, it really is the key it will save you a lot of pain."
ExNoContact,3dxqt0,PeaceAndPingPong,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:01:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah! And I read here somewhere, that it is easier when you think of NC as a temporary thing, because when you think of it as forever it is unbearable, whereas when you think of it as a temporary matter, you tend not to think about it so much."

ExNoContact,3dx8q7,mombartsswearing,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:56:54 2015 UTC,"You seem to have improved your life so much during NC. This is amazing. It's such a slow and painful process but it can also be filled with teachings and life changing realizations. We're shaping our lives, understanding who we are, what we want to be, what matters. You seem to be on that path as well.   I'm horrified of actually being happy and trusting something to remain positive.   I believe it is very very dangerous to let your happiness depend on something. Something could be the love of a boyfriend, the happiness of an ex, the attention of a friend, an activity, a job. Something might be gone tomorrow. Something might change. You will never be able to control something. Ever. Do you realize just how dangerous that is? Don't spend all your energy trying to predict, prepare, control, justify, identify that something. It's pointless. We cannot be happy that way. This is so so important.  You shouldn't depend on someone else's happiness, you can't control it, it's not your responsibility. But that doesn't mean you can't control YOUR happiness, quite the opposite in fact. And that's where all your energy should be focused on. I believe there is only one thing you have a true power over: yourself. You cannot control what happens to you or around you but you have this ability to choose the way you want to react and interpret.  Are you scared to be happy because you're afraid to loose that happiness? Would you say this is the root of your depression? Then think about this. What if your happiness didn't come from something or someone but from deep within you? What if you could feel a profound sense of joy on your own? Something that nothing could take away from you. How empowering would that be! Endless happiness. And spending your life sharing it. This is a true challenge though. It's like changing the wiring of your brain. Not an overnight change! But I believe it can be done, day by day with love (most importantly for yourself) and patience.  -EDIT-   But part of me still feels like this is my fault, that I've done something wrong and unforgivable, and that I deserve it. I still find myself wondering if he will ever reach out to me again, or if he just stopped caring. I have to assume he stopped caring, but that's really hard to admit to myself, especially when I still care so much about him.   This breaks my heart. Don't be so hard on yourself. You're in pain because the love and care you felt and feel are real. That love is the most beautiful gift you can ever give to someone. But don't forget to give it to yourself too. You went through so much, there is no wrong or right, whatever was done there is nothing to forgive. Being kind to yourself, that's what you deserve.  Also, your making plans and will to distract yourself from the temptation is a good sign but have you talked with your therapist or someone close about your suicidal ideation getting worse?  Stay strong!"
ExNoContact,3dxh72,ownmedaddy,2,Mon Jul 20 10:02:30 2015 UTC,"He said she's more emotionally mature than me and more laidback. He sees a future with her but says he wanted one with me but I was too much trouble.   That, right there, is asshole-speak for ""she lets me get away with stuff that you wouldn't"".    As for your feelings... <hugs> ... there's nothing wrong with them.  He sounds a little twisted in that regard.  He probably didn't have the maturity to deal with the complex feelings you had around the abortion - it sounds as though he only thinks feelings are okay when they are 1/ very straightforward and 2/ nothing to do with him.  Think back to when you first started out in the relationship - was it different then? Did he give the appearance of empathising and adoring you?"
ExNoContact,3dxh72,BTMask,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:17:12 2015 UTC,"He was very, yes. I haven't thought back to the start in awhile but yes he came riding in on his white horse everytime I was upset about another guy (we started as friends) or once when my bestfriend was in hospital.   He was lovely also when I broke my ribs in that he brought me lots of food shopping and spent time with me.   He tried the food shopping and hAnging out after the abortion but I needed someone to cry on and talk to as well and that's where things got bad although when I cried he used to hold me tight and say sorry for everything harsh he'd ever said to hurt me.  Now he says he thought the tears were me being self loathing and talking about it was pushing him away and trying to hurt him.  He now says I got pregnant on purpose and that I used it to hurt him. But I didn't on both counts.   I dunno if she let's him get away with stuff... He did say I was less demanding and easier to keep happy because all I wanted was his time and attention but she wants more than that."
ExNoContact,3dxh72,BTMask,2,Mon Jul 20 10:37:34 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. Doesn't sound so much like he cares about her, as much as it sounds like he likes the way that comforting people makes him feel about himself.     He now says I got pregnant on purpose and that I used it to hurt him   That's a really shitty thing to say. <hugs> Says a lot about him that he thinks people are capable of that. :( Are you still in contact?"
ExNoContact,3dxh72,alizey,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:40:04 2015 UTC,"No I initiated No Contact 10 days ago but in an argument. I sent a more peaceful no contact email 8 days which he replied to.   Here's what I said;   Look... I was really harsh.  I do think it's for the best because things easily get so ugly with us, but I don't blame you and I don't think you're a cunt and it was nasty of me to save you as that on my phone.  We have just been through way, way too much and it's too difficult to put it away for good if we keep seeing each other.  I don't want to be nasty to you and rake up the past, I miss you and want to be around you and having fun together but when you're there the pain of everything we've been through is too enormous.  I do wanna be happy and confident and thanks for the advice about doing weights, I know you don't make me feel bad about myself on purpose at all, your a good person and not a bully, you wouldn't deliberately make anyone feel insecure.  It makes me unbearably jealous to know anything about you with someone else and that's the real reason I got so upset.  I know it's normal and healthy and good for you to get interested in new people, I shouldn't have made such a scene.  I'm attached to you and jealous and therefore unable to give you the casual sex you want whilst your dating others more seriously.  I'm also actually too comfortable and trusting around you that I can cry that much - I dunno the last time I had my guard down that far.Â  In some ways it was cathartic to cry with you but I know how much it pushes you away.  Anyway that's what I wanted to say, I feel like I was harsh on Friday. I don't expect you to reply but if you do don't forget to wish me luck for my interview! ;)  P.s. You've given me whiplash....?!  And here's what he replied:  I appreciate all this. I could write a similar length of response but it'd only be stuff I've said already and we both know. And we both know you're right in what you've said anyway.  Â   I'm trying not to be curt in this message or sound angry but it just seems to read that way whatever I write.

Every post I seem to find seems like they have a pretty justifiable reason that the breakup happen (cheating, arguing, abuse, etc.). My relationship didn't end on terms like that. I honestly thought everything was pretty amicable.   Now that I'm feeling ignored and resented by her, though, I keep looking back and how I acted and blaming myself. I know how I acted wasn't just one terrible thing, but in taking her for granted and having a negative attitude, over time, it ended up destroying our relationship.  For everyone else, it seems like their partner was to blame. For me, it feels like I was the one in the relationship to blame."
ExNoContact,3dvvdi,CamCalderon21,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:01:45 2015 UTC,"Dude, i lost my self at the end of my relationship. I wasnt taking care of my lady, I wasnt treating her the way i needed to, and i wasnt being a the guy she fell in love with. She left me, and rightfully so. I know now that I needed that because it changed me for the better. and im a better man now. I miss her a lot, but she gave me something."
ExNoContact,3dvvdi,testing84123,2,Mon Jul 20 00:24:52 2015 UTC,"This is literally exactly what happened with us. We both got comfortable. I got comfortable. We didn't go out on dates like we did in the beginning of our relationship. I didn't put her forward like I did in the past. I took her for granted. We fell into a rut. We talked about taking a break. I thought about break up with her. But in the midst of losing her, I reignited my love for her. It was too little, too late, though. The damage was done. We were together for maybe a month after that, but looking back, she wasn't truly in that relationship, it was only me.  Part of all this pain is that I rekindled the fire that I felt for her. It hurt so much more after I loved her again. And part of all this guilt is that I let it get to a point where she couldn't return. I've certainly learned a lesson from this, but it doesn't make me blame myself any less. I wish I could express how truly sorry I feel. I wish I could have her forgiveness. That is what I feel like I need to move on.  Edit: Wanted to add this:  And I know it hurts so much more that I refuse to blame her for anything. She wasnâ€™t perfect either. She took me for granted too. She was selfish at times. She used me at times. But I find it so hard to blame her. I donâ€™t want to look back at our time together and be angry or regretful. I donâ€™t want to resent her or hate her. That attitude was one of the reasons that Iâ€™m in this position."
ExNoContact,3dvvdi,fuckcacti,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:35:16 2015 UTC,Did she say why she broke up with you?.
ExNoContact,3dvvdi,testing84123,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:45:11 2015 UTC,"She just simply wasn't in love with me anymore. She told me she still loved me, but she wasn't in love. She didn't want to be in a relationship with me anymore. She said we'd still remain friends. We haven't really been friends now. I can attribute that to myself. I was hurt after the breakup and, while talking with her afterwards, I don't think I treated her as the friend that I should have. But I was hurting, and I was holding back so she wouldn't continue to blame herself for my pain. It has hurt to have lost her twice now, though. I really feel like I've fucked up."
ExNoContact,3dvvdi,fuckcacti,2,Mon Jul 20 01:00:51 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't blame yourself completely. It just something that wasnt working out. When relationships end like that the person who got dumped will try and think of every reason why it happened, but they forget that it also may just be the other person going through something. It's themselves that have changed, and the only thing you can do is how you deal with the change.  Dont beat yourself up, you will learn a lot from this loss and you will be a much stronger person because of this. Take your time and mourn the loss, but dont stay down too long. Go out of the house, even if you feel like its the worst thing in the world. Just do it, if you feel uncomfortable at least your pushing yourself to do something. It will get easier and easier.   Take a few deep breaths and everything will be fine. Dont stress about it to much, and dont blame yourself. That is not going to help at all, so why do it?"

Don't reopen old wounds because she'll just resent you more and if she doesn't want to hear it then saying sorry is more for yourself than her.
ExNoContact,3dvvdi,testing84123,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:55:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not even sure that she resents me at all. It was a feeling I got when she started ignoring my texts and later told me she'd rather be alone than friends. She may not resent me or feel the feelings that I think she feels.  The issue is that I'm in limbo about it. She has basically refused to talk about it so I'm left in the dark, with no idea how she feels or whats going on. Maybe she hates my guts, or maybe she is just struggling to get over everything as well. But I'm only left to think the worst, so I do. And I can only blame myself for making her hate me. I've had no contact with her for nearly 3 weeks, but it gets harder every day not to try to talk to her to get closure or understanding about everything.  I think I wouldn't feel as heartbroken if we'd talk and she'd tell me that she doesn't blame me or hate me. I doubt that will ever happen though."
ExNoContact,3dvvdi,JewJutsu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:17:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my ex didn't really give me any closure either. The last text I got from her in response to a drunk text I sent her, she just told me she moved on. It hurt a lot and it was a confusing time for me. My advice to you is it gets better. Don't try to push for a response. If you guys get back together one day, deal with it then. It's all really out of your hands now as hard as that may be to accept at this time."

ExNoContact,3dvvdi,JewJutsu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:11:30 2015 UTC,"I felt like this for a while after my breakup. I still feel like it a little some days and it's been a year. I mostly just try to ignore the feeling though. I tried as hard as I could in the relationship. I have my flaws and I just went through a lot in the time before the breakup on my end. I accepted that I didn't handle things the way I thought I was handling them.   Basically, what I'm saying is, it takes time. I still miss her and would love to talk to her again/date her again, but for my own benefit I'm avoiding it for a while. I guess a part of me wants to remember her as she was just in case she became someone I consider a terrible person."
ExNoContact,3dvvdi,testing84123,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:11:34 2015 UTC,"I really did try hard in our relationship. Often times it felt like I was the only one who really cared. Sometimes she put the expectation on me to be the better person, or to do the things she wanted to do. Often, I felt that I was the only one who ever tried to work through our problems, she was more than happy being passive aggressive and angry at me, rather than talking about it. I really was a good guy, I just got to a point where I let myself slip. We both slipped, and it ended bad.   But for some goddamn reason, I can't find myself blaming her. Like I've said in previous posts, I don't want to look back negatively at anything. Not at her, not at us. We had tons of good times and fun together. That's what I want to remember. Maybe I can find solace in understanding and accepting it as a terrible thing that just happened. No one is really to blame, we both just let it get to a point of no return.  With all that said, I still miss her terribly. Each day I find myself thinking of her. I think of something we did together. I eat food that reminds me of dinner we had together. I hear a song that reminds me of her. I dream of her every night. Every time I unlock my phone, I hope that I have a text from her. I want to hear from her. I want to talk to her. I want her to want to talk to me."
ExNoContact,3dvvdi,JewJutsu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:40:50 2015 UTC,"How long have you been broken up now? a month?  I was there before too. It lasted for about 4 months for me give or take because I'm the type of person that takes a while to get over something. Hell, it's a year later and I still have moments like that. Eventually, you'll hopefully get to a point where you no longer feel the way you do. It'll eventually happen where you accept it for what it is, and I mean truly accept it, and move on. Whether move on means you forget about her or just move on in the sense where you accept that it's out of your hands now and you'll deal with whatever happens as it happens, it's up to you. I'm in the latter category given the breakup I went through.   From your posts, you sound like you did your best, take solace in that. It's not like you cheated on her, beat her, or did anything absolutely terrible. It's on both of you to figure out what went wrong. It seems like you realized it already. Just take it day by day man. Ironically, I had my last ex (it was a casual relationship) text me last night after a month NC saying she missed me. So it's possible you'll hear from your ex at some point, just don't think about it as much. Of course, I still wish it was the ex I actually care about that texted me, but oh well."
ExNoContact,3dvvdi,testing84123,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:38:57 2015 UTC,"It's been over two months now I guess. I actually don't even remember the exact date it happened. We talked occasionally after the breakup, and while I was hurting then, I became busy with my studies and it didn't hurt as much because we were promising each other to remain friends.   It wasn't till a few weeks after that we stopped talking. Any attempt by me resulted in me just being ignored. It started to hurt more. Three weeks ago today I sent her a long message about how I thought we wanted to remain friends and a lot of how I was feeling. and finally got a response that stated she wanted to be alone. That's when the breakup really hit me. That's when I felt I really lost her. I haven't talked to her since that text and I've ignored social media.   I do certainly feel better now than I did that first week. I know it takes time. It just hurts all the while. I'm looking forward to the day when the pain isn't always there, and every post like yours gives me hope that that day will come. I would like to remain friends, but as you said, it's out of my hands at this point. The only thing I can do is focus on myself."
ExNoContact,3dvvdi,pure_insanity7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:08:35 2015 UTC,"My ex has a lot of guilt as well. The relationship ended similarly as well. We didn't end on cheating, or arguing, or anything like that. He just told me one day he felt like he wasn't growing anymore, but insisted on saying ""I love you"" still, even as he was breaking my heart. His guilt really showed when a month after NC, he called me twice and texted me twice. He said he was depressed and would really like to hear from me. I don't know what's going on inside his head. I didn't respond. It has been 2 months since that text. I know he feels guilty, and I guess he thought it was best to break up and to let me heal. I miss him, and love him. His regret is not light though. He did fuck up, and he fucked up a lot. I am getting over it till this day.. wondering all the time why I was treated a certain way.. and wondering why I wasn't good enough. I just wanted to give you some perspective from the other side. I am not over my ex. In fact, some days I fantasize about getting a text or phone call from him. But the reality is, I am doing NC to protect myself, and that is more important than contacting him to see how he feels. Afterall, he didn't care about my feelings when he broke my heart."
ExNoContact,3dvvdi,testing84123,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:46:30 2015 UTC,"Hearing about this from the other perspective is really eye-opening. My experience has been very similar to yours, but me being in your ex's position, of course. I tried to reach out to her in a very similar way. I feel pretty bad to think that I made the one special person in my life feel like they weren't good enough. In looking at how everything transpired, I think that she did the same thing that you did. In order for her to heal, she started no contact with me. Each day I hope she heals enough to be able to contact me again. It's hard to think that I mean nothing to her now, especially after how important she used to tell me I was, even after we broke up. You've given me a little hope that maybe I still mean something. Maybe she still misses me. Lord knows I miss her.  I'd really like to apologize to her. Today marks exactly 3 weeks of no contact though. I don't want to destroy the progress that I've made. And more importantly, I don't think that I'm ready to make the apology. I think I need to learn to love myself and get my life back on track before I try to contact her again. It will do no good to offer an apology coming from the same depressed, sad person that she broke up with. I need to make some progress for the sake of both of us.  Edit: Do you think you'd ever find it in your heart to forgive your ex? I know that's something I am looking for right now, is for her to forgive me."

I recognise that people make mistakes, and that people change, and that I hope that she forgives me for the errors in thought that I had. I hope that she remembers me for who I was, who we were, not who we became. Don't worry, friend, we will be okay... :("
ExNoContact,3dvvdi,pure_insanity7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:06:27 2015 UTC,"I definitely will be able to forgive my ex one day. I still love him, and I miss him -- despite everything. This is the second time he has broken my heart. The first breakup lasted about 2 months. He broke it off, almost out of nowhere, said he needed to find himself, and that he didn't see a future with me. A couple months later he begged for me back. This break up, same thing, except he is not begging for anything. My ex has a lot of demons. He is very depressed at times. I lifted him up. After awhile though, I wasn't enough to keep him elevated. I started NC for myself. I needed to heal. It was the second time he had done this to me. I don't know if I will ever contact him to be honest with you -- even though I hope he contacts me. I don't know why I feel this way. Maybe because I am waiting for him to apologize, or to say the right things. He once told me I was the most important person in his life. If I am so important, why couldn't he fight for me, or try to fix things and make them right? Maybe he's not ready for an apology. I will forgive him one day. The love was real. It has been three months and I still catch myself thinking about him and the good times. but then I remind myself of the bad to justify not replying to his contact attempts. Me and my ex were not only in a relationship, we were best friends. The thought of him throwing that all away.. it hurts me so badly. I think it is something I will never understand. It is one of the saddest thoughts in my mind lately. Let me ask you something. He broke up with me, but still insisted on saying he loves me. The day after, he texts me. Three days later, he calls me. Just being friendly. That phone call, 4 days after the break up, ended with ""we'll talk soon"". 1 month later, i get 2 missed phone calls, and 2 texts within 2 days. The first text was about him wanting to work out with me at the gym, and the second was about him being depressed. Where do you think he was getting at? I didn't reply to anything. This was 2 months ago now. It makes me feel so guilty I didn't respond... but I couldn't. He can't just act like nothing ever happened. He can't just act like he didn't break my heart."
ExNoContact,3dvvdi,testing84123,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:41:51 2015 UTC,"I know that after she broke up with me I was feeling very down and it was hard to talk to her just as friends. We ended up not talking for a bit. It's probably my fault, I stopped messaging her first because she didn't seem interested in talking, but I also know I may have been making those conversations weird or awkward by trying not to make her feel guilty.   The first time I tried to contact her after a week of us talking was similar to your ex. My anxiety was acting up and I needed someone to talk to. She did as you did, she didn't respond. And I don't blame her for that. I don't blame you for that, and you shouldn't feel guilty. I think in her eyes, I'm coming back to her looking for a shoulder to cry on. It seems like I'm just using her as my therapist -- something I did during our relationship that I know she wasn't fond of. All I'm doing is bring that poor attitude that I know she hated back into her life. It's hard though, I'm not sure how your ex is, but I don't really open up to people. She is probably the only person I have been completely open and honest about in my entire life. Not my family, none of my friends that I've known since kindergarten probably know me as well as she did. I didn't feel comfortable with anyone like I did with her. Just like you, we were best friends. That's why I'd end up venting or crying to her. I know now that wasn't healthy or good for us.  It looks like I just used her for myself, but I do really care. I want to hear about her day. I wonder how she's doing in her summer class and I wish I could offer her support and encouragement through her homework and exams. I want to hear about the things that happen to her a work and through her day. I want to hear her opinions again, those opinions that challenged me and made me think differently. I value those opinions. I value her.  But at the same time I understand she needs to heal. It's understandable that you need to heal, too. I am very sorry for how I treated her: for being part of the problem and letting our love fall apart. I know that people change, and that we can never be a couple again, but it hurts so much more in losing your best friend. I also feel guilty for that, and I am truly sorry for putting her through that as well. But I don't think it will do any good to apologize from the same place of depression, anxiety, and negativity that negatively affected her so much. I need to heal and love myself before I can tell her that I'm sorry and really mean it. Before I can apologize with the hope that she truly forgives me.  For now, any apology doesn't mean as much. I, and your ex, need to focus on ourselves and heal so I can relieve her of her guilt, and he can relieve you of yours. Do not feel guilty for what you've done, and continue to ignore him. It is the only way that he will be able to move on and the only way you will as well."
ExNoContact,3dvvdi,pure_insanity7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:33:07 2015 UTC,"When my ex broke up with me, he said he would like to ""re open communication soon"". To this day, i still have no idea what that meant. I dont know if he thought we could be friends, or if he meant getting back together once he worked on himself. I know for a fact that being friends would not have worked.. and this is why I first entertained his contact attempts, and then ignored them. He wanted to act like nothing ever happened. I am far too prideful for that. Now, if he were to actually ask me, face to face, if we could be friends, I'd maybe consider it. But he said ""re open communication soon"", which is another one of his manipulative mind tricks.  My ex definitely used me... not as a therapist though. He used me as his emotional punching bag. When he was angry, sad, depressed.. I am the one who suffered. I took the blame for all the negativity in his life. My ex also confided in me, while he did not open up to many people. We were best friends.  While I say all this, and while it may sound spiteful or bad, I loved the guy. I really did. I wanted to do everything for him -- give him everything.   Your ex is going to take this as a learning experience, as am I. I still have thoughts in the back of my mind about us getting back together... and it's been 3 months. I have no idea how he feels as well. You need to forgive yourself. There is no point in dwelling over guilt, you must forgive and heal so you can grow. A relationship takes two people, and although you may carry most of the baggage, you do not carry it alone. I bet you are a very sweet and caring guy, underneath the ugly you showed her. I know this because my ex is the same way.. he just happens to have stronger demons than myself. Moving on is so scary.. I was terrified at the beginning. It's happening though. If the world was going to end tomorrow, I would want to see my ex before it ended. That is what makes moving on so difficult for me."
ExNoContact,3dvvdi,testing84123,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:35:04 2015 UTC,"The last contact I had from my ex she told me she'd ""rather just be alone."" Like you, I don't know what this means. Does she just need time and space right now while she tries to heal? Or does she never want to hear from me ever again? I asked for clarification but I never got a response back.  I hope that she is in a similar position that you are. I hope that she does miss me sometimes and doesn't resent me. I hope she would be willing to accept an apology. I hope that one day I'll be able to contact her and get a response and we can be friends again. Her ignoring me has left me feeling very alone and very remorseful. We were able to forgive each other during our relationship, I don't see why she wouldn't be forgiving now."
ExNoContact,3dvvdi,switcheroodoo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:38:53 2015 UTC,"Things happen and sometimes we hurt people. Sometimes they hurt us.  We have to trust that others will be able to deal with their emotions, because they are their own responsibility.  As for you, you must do the same. There will come a point where you will have to accept what you did and, I promise, it will be okay.  There is no closure for many events in our lives and that is okay too. It's not always a clean break.  Sometimes the best we can do is learn from it and carry on.  Guilt won't help anyone. I am sure that she would not want you to wallow in misery to prove your guilt...and if she did, that's another problem altogether."

ExNoContact,3dvtu8,WATisISO,6,Sun Jul 19 23:19:42 2015 UTC,"Keep going strong. In my situation, I basically said to her that I wasn't interested in being friends and politely asked her not to contact me unless she was interested in a relationship. I haven't heard anything from her for over a month. I threw out every gift, deleted every picture, and blocked her on social media.  I'm living life and moving on. She can contact me on my terms or not at all."
ExNoContact,3dvtu8,goldenkola,5,Mon Jul 20 00:34:24 2015 UTC,This. If your ex wants to contact you they will. But until then you cannot get hung up on them any longer. At 30 days I made the realization that she's not a good person anymore and hasn't been for some time. I realized that she had no compassion and that she's going to do this again and again because she's not happy inside. It's sad but I'm moving on

ExNoContact,3dvtu8,Hauxuu,2,Sun Jul 19 23:29:09 2015 UTC,"Just keep going. It's good to have an initial goal (like 30 days), but unless there is some reason to stop at 30, nothing good can come from breaking NC at 30 days. You now know that you can go 30 days, so try for 60.   For me, the goal isn't to make it a certain number of days without the person; the goal is to live without the person infinitely."
ExNoContact,3dvtu8,Needtotrythis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:22:50 2015 UTC,"In normal circumstances, you'd be totally right.   However, my ex and I have two children together. Our partners are facilitating all contact/visitation, but at a certain point I need to talk to her again. The goal of this whole ordeal was to make sure that I was able to emotionally distance myself without falling apart.   I guess I just want to feel ready. It's weird, no one else really has an effect on me like this. It's just like my brain goes to shit whenever she's around."
ExNoContact,3dvtu8,Needtotrythis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:35:38 2015 UTC,"It must be so hard when contact is a necessity. Maybe in this case, the purpose of NC is to separate the ex from the new person. The ex no longer exists. This person that you'll eventually have contact with may have the same name as your ex, look like your ex, etc., but it's a different person. I don't know when it's ""safe"" to break NC; 30 days is so arbitrary. Maybe every x days you can reevaluate, and it's ""safe"" when you know that your ex no longer exists, and you're ready to have contact with this new (random) person."
ExNoContact,3dwk5t,Ncthrowaway12345,2,Mon Jul 20 03:14:39 2015 UTC,"I would hold on to your own NC for now. If in the future, you still want to be friends, and she does as well, feel free to breach that promise. As of now, like you said, there is too much hurt, and you may be making promises to yourself that you cannot keep.  Worst comes to worst, sleep on it for a few nights. You'll find clarity in yourself."

ExNoContact,3dv44n,Phorella,10,Sun Jul 19 19:41:16 2015 UTC,"Block her, move on. Just don't tolerate her shit.   Honestly she doesn't give a shit about you if she's doing this; even an ""ex-now-friend"" who had even a pinch of compassion and kindness in them would understand how shitty it would be for you to see this and would AT LEAST block you from seeing their stories on snapchat if they did care about you (You'd have no idea you're blocked).  Probably also calling and so on while drunk etc because you are a convenience to her when she's lonely / not getting attention from her fling.  She sounds horrible dude."
ExNoContact,3dv44n,d0gfish,3,Sun Jul 19 23:06:28 2015 UTC,"I had the same trouble. She would always snap me with her hook ups to make me feel like shit. Deleting her from all my social network channels was probably one of the hardest, yet best things I done. Of course I'm hurt, but I can tolerate the pain now rather than always  guessing what she maybe up to  She begged me to remain friends but I took the highroad and walked away. It's not worth the emotional pain. Delete her from everything. Sure, it hurts, but cut ties"
ExNoContact,3duqe8,ElectricEndeavors,4,Sun Jul 19 17:45:26 2015 UTC,"<hugs> If he moved out without telling you, that speaks volumes about his lack of emotional availability.

The sad truth is that this is who and what he is. He was like this all along. It's unlikely this was a new development for him. He was too cowardly for an adult relationship, so he chose to run off and hide. He can stay disappeared.   You gave him your best, and he gave you this shit in return. He lost someone so wonderful, and that's his fault. His loss."
ExNoContact,3duwza,BTMask,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:41:30 2015 UTC,"I would take you wanting to hurt him that you're finally done being sad and now you're just mad about the whole idea. It's not like you would actually do any of that. I know during my last relationship end when I finally got mad for everything he did I wanted to do a lot of things to mess with him. I never did but I had things like make sure things got delivered to him during the cruise we were supposed to be on to remind him of what he dumped all over, telling all his friends what he really says about them and various other things in my head.   Stay strong! He doesn't deserve another second of your thoughts."

ExNoContact,3duwza,NoContactNoob,2,Sun Jul 19 23:51:45 2015 UTC,"Maybe this is a bit of closure and confirmation that some of your gut feelings / suspicions were indeed spot on (though unfortunate nonetheless).    I tend to be that way, ""prove me wrong then"".....but sooner or later I am proven to be right as far as nagging suspicions etc go. so while on one hand I am relieved that I was not making things up or going mad, but on the other, it also confirms  the very things that really hurt.    Good for you for using this experience to get mad - even for a bit.  It cleansed a bunch of the sad hopeless feelings away didn't it? Now for the anger to quiet down enough for things to start anew.  Think of how the forest always grows back after a bad forest fire, the vegetation is usually thicker and more verdant than before.   You are on your way to renewal :)"
ExNoContact,3duwza,Needtotrythis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:13:14 2015 UTC,"therefore every time I was ""mean"", ""jealous"" and ""hyper-suspicious""... I was most likely right.    I don't think that it matters whether you were wrong or right.  It only matters that he made you feel ""mean,"" ""jealous,"" and  ""hyper-suspicious"" - someone who loves you shouldn't make you feel like that.   I'm so happy for you in that you seem to be over the sadness, but anger doesn't help things either. Also, the feelings don't seem to be mutually exclusive. I am absolutely furious with my ex, but I'm still so sad and I want to be in his arms. Getting over the sadness is good, but in order to heal we need to let everything go, all of the feelings and emotions. I don't know when that will happen, but I don't think that any action will help, no matter what the motive. In this situation (weeks or months after the breakup) I don't think that anyone regrets inaction - it's better to do nothing (unless something is absolutely necessary).   When you feel like contacting him, or doing anything concerning him (like contacting her), post on this sub instead. Aside from all of the helpful ""don't do it"" replies, you'll probably feel better and get some perspective from simply writing out your thoughts."

ExNoContact,3dsk2p,BTMask,2,Sun Jul 19 01:20:03 2015 UTC,It really is isn't it? Luckily for me I don't have Facebook or Instagram... But sometimes I have the urge to look at her new bf's twitter... You just gotta fight it!   I hope you didn't see anything too bad :(. Stay strong BT
ExNoContact,3dsk2p,Gutsyisland,2,Sun Jul 19 01:21:39 2015 UTC,"Didn't see anything, happily, cos we're not linked. Worse than that - I sent a message. D'oh......  Nothing mushy thank god.  I don't feel mushy towards him.  Asked for clarity on a vague hopeful statement he gave me when I asked for NC, though. It was a damn stupid thing to do.  I even knew it as I was doing it.  Kinda looking forward to the pain though.  I wonder if I've replaced physical self-harm with emotional self-harm?"
ExNoContact,3dsk2p,Gutsyisland,2,Sun Jul 19 01:30:33 2015 UTC,Nah you just wanna hear from someone you used to love... You miss the pain because you miss loving someone... I know the feeling :(

ExNoContact,3dsk2p,NoContactNoob,2,Sun Jul 19 02:21:58 2015 UTC,"It's ok. We are here right alongside you.  Social media is really one of the worst things we have these days in the long run, especially when it comes to breakups.  I personally cannot stand it.  I am of the age where we had NONE of this stuff.  You actually used a rotary then push-button telephone - then brick sized cellphone to call someone if you didn't already keep touch with them face to face. :)  Thankfully it was not 24/7/365 either.  We never got exposed to the insane level of unnecessary details of others lives that we are all subjected to now.  Not to mention so much of it being hyped up for public consumption.  That all said, I am relieved that you saw nothing damaging - at least there is not that new shock to absorb. Ok, you messaged for some clarity.  He will either respond or not.  We can wait here with you regardless of that outcome.  Their silence is deafening when we want so much to hear something from them.   hang in there...."
ExNoContact,3dsk2p,lightning_crashes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:33:56 2015 UTC,"Then you get back on that wagon. No more contact. What's done is done. You're never gonna get the closure you deserve out of him, and you're never gonna get the honest answers you deserved from him either.   The sidebar is right, these lingering feelings won't go away for awhile, but they will. NC is the only way to make that happen."
