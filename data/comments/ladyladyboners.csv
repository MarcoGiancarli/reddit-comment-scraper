Of course, as one of the main writers and creators of the show, Lana obviously had a huge role in writing the character.  I don't think she's anywhere near a Mary Sue type of character.

Like what high school was she going to that no one notice a 6' blonde Valkyrie?"
ladyladyboners,36l3w7,milesunderground,3,Wed May 20 15:29:52 2015 UTC,I don't think those songs were about her. I believe those songs were her connecting with her fans. Teenagers in high school.
ladyladyboners,36l3w7,milesunderground,3,Wed May 20 16:28:27 2015 UTC,"I think her later albums are like that, but her early stuff was about the awkwardness of being a teenager because she was an awkward teenager.

Try seeing her other movies that aren't as well known like The Cake Eaters, or The Yellow Handkerchief. Much different."

ladyladyboners,35s0tt,partialinsanity,1 point,Wed May 13 21:10:13 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard of either of those. I'll try to check them out! I remember she gave a surprisingly good child performance in Panic Room, but I kinda chalked that one up to how amazing David Fincher is as a director. However, I heard her performance in Clouds of Sils-Maria was god awful. So, I think her performances have gone down in quality as of late, since both of the films you mentioned were around 7 or 8 years ago. But I'll check those out! :)"
ladyladyboners,35s0tt,TransCinephile,5,Thu May 14 21:52:37 2015 UTC,Definitely do! Welcome to the Rileys is pretty good too!

ladyladyboners,35s0tt,Swoove,3,Fri May 15 13:31:00 2015 UTC,Her acting in Clouds of Sils Maria was actually very good. Which is why she won a award for it. Good film all round and nothing that you would expect from a K-stew film. Camp X-Ray was pretty good too. Transcinephile I think you may need to watch some of her better projects. I also agree on Welcome To The Riley. Really enjoyed that one.
ladyladyboners,35s0tt,gemaliasthe1st,2,Sun May 17 19:49:11 2015 UTC,"I'm basing that off of YMS' review, but I now see he was reeeeally in the minority. I saw the overall score was around a ""60"" and figured the reviews were split, but I guess the film was praised really highly by a lot of critics. When it comes on HBO or Netflix, I'll try to check it out and see for myself, but with the way he described it I cannot imagine her getting such a prestigious award for such a performance. But then again, I rarely agree with award shows anyway (this year was one of the few times I agreed with the Oscars' Best Picture winner)."

ladyladyboners,34oz2b,CarryYourWorld,6,Sun May 3 14:38:34 2015 UTC,"Brought you above the 0 point. I work with and around a lot of Russian immigrants, and you are right. And some when coming to the new culture do change/become more tolerant/etc. They never had the chance before. It's a very different culture than what we have in the western world, and often it takes personal experience to realize something you believe is wrong. But when the majority of people around you believe it to be wrong, people hide for their own safety and it's harder to get that personal experience.  I get the anger of other people (not you, obviously), but how do we convince people to come over to their side if we just yell ""horrible"" things back? It is really hard to admit you might be wrong and should re-evaluate things. Especially if one side is yelling that is horrible and sinful and you'd be one too if you change your mind, and the other side is calling you shit as well."

ladyladyboners,3377w6,autowikibot,2,Mon Apr 20 17:12:34 2015 UTC,"Teddy Boy:       Teddy Boy (also known as Ted) is a British subculture typified by young men wearing clothes that were partly inspired by the styles worn by dandies in the Edwardian period, styles which Savile Row tailors had attempted to re-introduce in Britain after World War II.  The subculture started in London in the 1950s, and rapidly spread across the UK, soon becoming strongly associated with rock and roll. Originally known as Cosh Boys, the name Teddy Boy was coined when a 1953 Daily Express newspaper headline shortened Edwardian to Teddy.

ladyladyboners,331y05,fueledbyburd,2,Sun Apr 19 18:06:34 2015 UTC,"Well, here's hoping that the show runners will see that chemistry and not jettison it for the sake of remaining true to 60 year old canon, because I totally agree Rosario and Charlie were smokin' hot together."

The piece featured characters named after Stephenie Meyer's characters in Twilight, Edward Cullen and Bella Swan. After comments concerning the sexual nature of the material, James removed the story from the fan-fiction websites and published it on her own website, FiftyShades.com. Later she rewrote Master of the Universe as an original piece, with the principal characters renamed Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele and removed it from her website before publication"

My bf isn't a fan of that one, so wanted to cut it off- Part of it, he said, was that he can't stand Winona. Meanwhile, I love her. I have a pixie cut and always feel a sense of confidence when I see how awesome she looks with one. Anyone rockin' a pixie, actually. Does he not like her hair? Her acting skills, eyes, lips, skin, voice.. All so wonderful. So I inquired further, and he didn't have an answer other than that his mother doesn't like her and maybe her vocalization of that is why? Gotta get to the bottom of this!   TL;DR- Winona rocks"

ladyladyboners,2xrlny,dawsomeofthat,3,Tue Mar 3 16:10:02 2015 UTC,"Jennifer started out doing only indie films and was cautious about taking the part of Katniss because she didn't want to do something so famous. Kaya's been in several really big things, like Skins and the Maze Runner, and she's handled herself well. I agree she wouldn't be as loveable or hilarious as Jen is, but her physical appearance is so much more on point and from what I've seen of her acting she could have nailed the part. Oh well..."
ladyladyboners,2xrlny,dawsomeofthat,2,Tue Mar 3 16:42:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah she blew me away in Skins, I never saw maze runner but that came out after THG anyway. I know Jen did indie but she's got an oscar now and I wonder is that would have happened to Kaya."

She took a photo with me and signed my film ticket. I was really too starstruck to do more than giggle and ask her a couple of banal questions. The cinema crew were obviously waiting around to get her and the director out, as they had other films to screen, but she insisted on saying hello to everyone. Brilliant.  In the list of people I've met, she was only just surpassed for sheer loveliness by Courtenay Taylor (the voice of Jack in Mass Effect, among other things)."

ladyladyboners,2qbgsc,UseAccountWhenWet,5,Wed Dec 24 22:50:43 2014 UTC,I'm having a really rough time with the concept of name causality
ladyladyboners,2qbgsc,femmeslash,-1,Thu Dec 25 00:34:10 2014 UTC,"Allow me to explain.  It's not the causality of the name itself, nor does it refer to the causal relationship between the events that preceded its creation and the form its creation took. Rather, the name causality referenced in the title refers to the causal relationship between the events described and the events implied by my reddit username itself: /u/UseAccountWhenWet.  The name is admittedly ambiguous in literal translation, although I believe that its context ultimately makes the intended meaning clear. I will however offer a brief explanation for the sake of clarity.  The name can be trivially broken down into a four word phrase: ""Use account when wet."" That phrase, on the surface, appears to be an instruction to the reader. That is not however its intended meaning. Rather the name is intended to invoke the idea of a typical public safety notice, which often take the form ""Do X when Y."" An example of this would be ""Break glass in case of emergency."" as often seen on various pieces of fire safety equipment. The phrase actually refers to my own actions as the account operator and the reader is not intended to follow the instructions, although they are very much invited to do so.  Now let's look at the components of the message. We'll start with ""Use account"". This is ultimately a self referential reference made by the account to the account itself, in much the same way this comment is. This is basically recursion within recursion right here. The implication of this part of the name, when held in a more complete geopolitical and socio-economic context, is that the following condition conditional condition typically leads to, or causes, the use of the account.  Now let's get on to that conditional itself, shall we?  ""When wet"" - This refers, as I believe can again be inferred from the geopolitical and socio-economic context, to my vulva - mainly my vagina. Vulvae typically, mine included, oft find themselves covered in varying quantities of various liquids such as water, urine, delicious lubricating juices, blood, milk and other forms of discharge. In this case I am primarily referring to delicious lubricating juices, mainly those produced by my own body.  These juices are primarily externally evident during periods of significant sexual arousal. The implication of the name, therefore, is that this account is primarily used by me during periods in which I am significantly sexually aroused, and that it is the sexual arousal that leads to the use of the account and not the other way around. This implication is accurate.   However, the manner in which I was using the account at the time of posting was atypical - a fact that could have very easily been gleaned from the combination of the wording of the title, the wording of my name and spending less that 15 minutes analysing my account history. In this particular instance I was only mildly sexually aroused when I initiated my use of the account.   Through my use of the account I discovered the posted gif of Eliza Taylor, originally posted as a reaction gif on /r/TrollXChromosomes under the title MRW I'm buying an 11 inch black dildo as a gag gift and the cashier looks at the dildo, then back to me and asks if I'll need lube with that. This was, as far as I know, the first time I had ever seen Eliza Taylor.  I personally find Eliza Taylor to be very attractive, particularly in the posted gif. As a result of my staring at this gif for an unknown but significant period of time, I transitioned from my state of only mild arousal to a more significant state in which the term ""wet"" could reasonably be applied to my vulva and vagina in particular. It's important to note at this point that the sequence of events that had taken place was as follows:  Use account -> Be wet   This is the opposite, or reverse, of the typical sequence of events described earlier which can be summarised as follows:  Be wet -> Use account   One can very easily prove this reversal by simply taking either one of the sequences shown above, moving the item on the left to the right and the item on the right to the left, and observing that they have produced the other sequence.  This ultimately is the reversal of the meaning embedded within my name and I believe an accurate and succinct summary by way of case-study of the concept of name causality.  TL;DR: Fuck her right in the pussy"

ladyladyboners,2pd7ts,AustNerevar,2,Mon Dec 15 22:03:08 2014 UTC,okay then I'll be waiting for part II.  I guess it would make more sense if you watch part I and II together... then if one is slow it won't be noticeable..
ladyladyboners,2pd7ts,dimovelijah,2,Mon Dec 15 22:27:51 2014 UTC,It's really only slow if your concept of moderate pace is a Michael Bay movie :)

ladyladyboners,2o4zhf,deposer,8,Wed Dec 3 16:13:46 2014 UTC,"She doesn't identify as lesbian.    From Wikipedia:  ”In a November 2010 interview for Willamette Week, she laid to rest questions about her sexual identity, saying: ""It's weird, because no one's actually ever asked me. People just always assume, like, you're this or that. It's like, 'OK. I'm bisexual'."" In 2012, Brownstein told interviewer Marc Maron that no one in Sleater-Kinney was gay, and that she and Tucker had only dated for ""a second"".  Since working together on ThunderAnt, Brownstein and Fred Armisen developed what Brownstein has called ""one of the most intimate, functional, romantic, but nonsexual relationships [they have] ever had"". According to Armisen, their relationship is ""all of the things that I've ever wanted, you know, aside from like the physical stuff, but the intimacy that I have with her is like no other""."
ladyladyboners,2o4zhf,courtney10,5,Wed Dec 3 23:33:28 2014 UTC,She's definitely queer.  Pretty sure she's a lesbian.

ladyladyboners,2lxogv,awesomesauce00,6,Tue Nov 11 20:30:34 2014 UTC,I think my favorite one  of her is the carrot onesie.
ladyladyboners,2lxogv,joliedame,2,Tue Nov 11 17:27:38 2014 UTC,Isn't she the drunk kitchen chick?
ladyladyboners,2lxogv,Lucktar,2,Tue Nov 11 18:24:53 2014 UTC,The very same.
ladyladyboners,2lxav9,Pallas-Athena,3,Tue Nov 11 02:30:03 2014 UTC,"God, I've had a thing for her since before I hit puberty."
ladyladyboners,2lxav9,kabukistar,2,Tue Nov 11 07:49:12 2014 UTC,You and me both.

ladyladyboners,2lw39f,pa_one,9,Mon Nov 10 20:14:04 2014 UTC,Don't know why but this picture kinda looks like Amy wants to kiss Zoey.
ladyladyboners,2lw39f,Caitautomatica,3,Mon Nov 10 20:14:47 2014 UTC,"I agree, it's definitely because Amy is looking at Zooey's lips. And I'm not ashamed to admit that I've got a thought bubble of ""those lips tho..."" above Amy in my head cannon now."
ladyladyboners,2lw39f,dickdarkstar,8,Tue Nov 11 13:13:06 2014 UTC,"I keep staring at this, hoping they'll lean in for a sensual kiss, and it just doesnt happen... :("
ladyladyboners,2lw39f,keeksmonster,3,Mon Nov 10 21:37:46 2014 UTC,It looks like it's going to happen though... It's making me crazy.
ladyladyboners,2lw39f,VanillaMint,3,Tue Nov 11 03:56:23 2014 UTC,"Ugh, I can only wish!"
ladyladyboners,2lw39f,IAm_ThePumpkinKing,6,Tue Nov 11 05:39:08 2014 UTC,I ship it.
ladyladyboners,2luyit,brokenhyoid,11,Mon Nov 10 14:15:19 2014 UTC,wow I have never seen that pic before and I used to scour the internet for pics of her for my wallpaper back in the day.
ladyladyboners,2luyit,drocks27,5,Mon Nov 10 16:29:06 2014 UTC,I've never seen it either and I was obsessed with her for the longest time!
ladyladyboners,2luyit,laladyhope,3,Mon Nov 10 18:20:41 2014 UTC,"Have never seen this pic, still obsessed with her. I don't watch many Disney movies nowadays but she drew me to Maleficent."
ladyladyboners,2luyit,LonestarPSD,3,Tue Nov 11 00:27:29 2014 UTC,I admit weakness for the Maleficent Angelina too...
ladyladyboners,2luyit,crazykhajiitlady,3,Mon Nov 10 18:44:54 2014 UTC,"""I like it when you kneel....do it again.""  That whole scene was amazing."
ladyladyboners,2luyit,LonestarPSD,2,Tue Nov 11 01:55:14 2014 UTC,"Oh yes. Those were her golden years, to me. Used to have such a crush on this version of her."
ladyladyboners,2lwdm5,creepgirl,1 point,Mon Nov 10 21:37:23 2014 UTC,I always really enjoyed her on whatever show she used to be on. Always smokin.
ladyladyboners,2lsbs0,thatcambridgebird,6,Sun Nov 9 19:34:08 2014 UTC,Oh god yes
ladyladyboners,2lu51r,PM_me_a_compliment,2,Mon Nov 10 06:19:43 2014 UTC,"She has so much gravitas, I feel like she should play Wonder Woman's mother.  I know this is super random, but her voice work in Mass Effect was also great!"
ladyladyboners,2lu51r,femmeslash,2,Thu Nov 13 12:20:11 2014 UTC,I love her voice!!
