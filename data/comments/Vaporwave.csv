Vaporwave,3e480y,EmbiggensCromulent,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:51:36 2015 UTC,"Ambient isn't really a genre as much as a wide category of music. I mean, Brian Eno's Music for airports sounds absolutely nothing like Biosphere's Substrata. It's always difficult to describe exactly what makes something fit into a genre and something similar not fit it. So what makes it vapor-ambient is that it retains the core elements of vaporwave, just like ambient black metal retains the core elements of black metal. You wont find any samples of smooth jazz in ambient black metal, but it's quite common in vapor-ambient."
Vaporwave,3e480y,elaiosome,2,Tue Jul 21 22:01:24 2015 UTC,"because the artist says so. i know that might sound strange, but is there really a technical difference between rock and roll and punk? not really - it's just the context of the music, the point in time it was released, and the artist's vision.  personally i feel there are a few objective things that make a difference, like the focus on internet-based imagery, futurism, track titles, cassette releases, and real life samples such as malls, streets, subways, etc. an album like Music for Airports or Ambient Works Vol. 2 is purely about the music, not setting itself in a specific context.   i definitely agree that the line is blurry, but i think it's there."
Vaporwave,3e480y,palmettooo,0,Tue Jul 21 21:35:57 2015 UTC,"yea i agree with a lot of what you are saying.  thinking on it harder, comparing the mallsoft genre to ""music for airports"" is a pretty interesting thing.  because is the latter purely about the music?  i think eno is trying to evoke feeling too (something very common in mallsoft and vaporambient).  i do however feel like some people are labeling certain ambient as vapor when it really isnt.  just like how i wouldnt call zeppelin and hendrix punk.  could one exist without the other?  no way.  but there is an objective difference. there is nothing wrong with labeling ambient as vaporwave or vaporwave as ambient whatsoever, so whoever decides to come out of the wordwork for this please don't assume i think one is better.  also pretty hilarious this thread gets downvoted just because i asked a question and people's opinions.  this isn't to judge anything.  it's a discourse.  like it or not music and art operates on an aesthetic and chronological spectrum.  to those downvoting:  offer an opinion, not just some bitter and cowardly click of a button.  it is this type of conversation which only strengthens the genre we all love."

Vaporwave,3e1c3r,uncleyam,6,Tue Jul 21 07:06:05 2015 UTC,"I don't even know how to begin consuming a release like this, fifteen hours of half-hour long ambient pieces?  No offense to Telepath intended, I'm sure it's as phenomenal as the rest of his output, but approaching a release like this feels like the musical equivalent of trying to eat a one pound chocolate bar by yourself"
Vaporwave,3e1c3r,anguirus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:34:48 2015 UTC,"It reminds me of when I first found out you could download a band's entire discography in a torrent. Or build up several months of music in a folder. Or carry the collection with you at all times. It's overwhelming and there's a tendency to get ADD and not complete albums or songs, and leave lots of music just sitting there, never played.  New project: a program that simulates the music ADD effect by skipping to random parts of any given track. But how to determine the range on the probability of skipping. Tap into Alvin Lucier's Music for a Solo Performer"
Vaporwave,3e1c3r,pmiller17,7,Tue Jul 21 21:03:15 2015 UTC,"The ambient piece closest in length I've listened to in one sitting is William Basinski's The Disintegration Loops, which is about 5 hours total between the 4 albums. I listened to that back in college when I was working on a project and needed to stay focused. At first it put me in a daze, but after a while it just became part of the background, which I suppose is what ambient music should do. Honestly the listening experience as a whole is a blur that didn't feel like 5 hours. What I remember most was the end. When it finally was over, it was the craziest feeling. Like I had walked outside for the first time in forever. Too bright. The silence was like an endless chasm in my bedroom.   This Telepath release is quite a bit longer. I'm up for it, though."

Vaporwave,3e1c3r,ABridge27,3,Tue Jul 21 06:22:54 2015 UTC,"would've preferred that he finished the project on the 仮想夢プラザ bandcamp. that bandcamp page is a work of art in itself. each 31 minute dream is complimented by a woman existing only in fantasy, labeled under titles that are meant to be gazed upon rather than read, and are all accessible on a single page; a unique and masterful display of unity that one could ponder on forever. but whether on his main bandcamp appearing as a single album or on the Virtual Dream Plaza as many, I think this project is the greatest vaporwave has ever had the privilege to experience, and now there is no doubt in my mind that Telepath is one of the greatest artists living today  despite lasting half an hour, 水中夢 is creeping up to the top of my most played tracks list"

Vaporwave,3e1c3r,Scumsberg,9,Tue Jul 21 05:15:40 2015 UTC,"It's a project he's been working on for ages, he was releasing one track at a time (or 3 at a time in trilogies) until he had completed the full set of 31, with 31 31-minute tracks in total, hence the reason he used a new artist name for this, each one representing different dreams."
Vaporwave,3e1c3r,dreamcatalogue,2,Tue Jul 21 05:21:21 2015 UTC,So does this mean this is the end of 仮想夢プラザ?

Denzel Curry is the only other rapper I know of who's done that.  His mixtape PaidProgramming has a really nostalgic/mallsoft type of atmosphere, I think a lot of the more adventurous listeners on this sub could enjoy it."
Vaporwave,3dwkt3,anguirus,7,Tue Jul 21 06:44:50 2015 UTC,"I didn't know who Bones was until he sampled a few of my edits, actually. RotatingBed sampled Fantasy from New Classics, and I want to say he used Lost in Translation and one more song, I forget which one. He likes vaporwave a lot."

You can usually find the producers in the album descriptions on SoundCloud. Drip-133 is one of them who is mostly doing trap based productions now, but had a split (Lilac '97) w/ Architecture in Tokyo in 2013. In my personal opinion, he's probably the most socially intelligent cloud rapper out there. Created and perpetuated and completely capitalizing on the consumerism of internet culture, which certainly Vaporwave falls under. Incredibly loyal following.  I mean, look at some of the shirts TeamSesh has put out...  aaaand this one...  A few of my favorites:  30DayFreeTrial  TheGreatSnowfallOf82  HeartBreakKid  SeshRadio: Volume 1  High  Dead Pixel  I think there's a lot of gems to find scattered throughout his body of work both relevant and not."

Vaporwave,3dwkt3,everydaycali,7,Mon Jul 20 05:08:07 2015 UTC,Bones is who originally got me into vaporwave. RotatingBed off PaidProgramming is pretty much pure vapors.
Vaporwave,3dwkt3,ITD3PT,6,Mon Jul 20 04:21:17 2015 UTC,"Everything Bones released between Saturn and PaidProgramming is strongly influenced by vaporwave.   Creep and Cracker are two of my fave albums of his. Lots of sampling of vaporwave classics from Vektroid, Contact Lens, etc. He's heading away from the genre these days, and more towards original vaportrap compositions, probably in an effort to avoid paying major licensing fees for all the samples vwave uses."
Vaporwave,3dwkt3,no_gods_no_hamsters,4,Mon Jul 20 03:41:59 2015 UTC,"to avoid paying major licensing fees for all the samples vwave uses.   Nah, all of his music is free, he doesn't have to pay any fees"
Vaporwave,3dwkt3,NinjaWhaleOfDoom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:09:43 2015 UTC,"Right. But if, for instance, he decided to start making money off his music, he would have to distance himself from his back catalogue of sample-heavy vaporwave, and work with producers like Cat Soup, Greaf, and Drip who make original tracks."
Vaporwave,3dwkt3,no_gods_no_hamsters,2,Mon Jul 20 22:14:47 2015 UTC,"Of course! But he's said in an interview that he doesn't want to make any money of his music, and doesn't want to sign with a record label, for the fear of rebranding."
Vaporwave,3dwkt3,NinjaWhaleOfDoom,4,Tue Jul 21 08:54:28 2015 UTC,Lol do you think every vaporwave artist actually pays for the songs they sample?
Vaporwave,3dwkt3,wiccaphaze,2,Mon Jul 20 13:21:45 2015 UTC,Not unless you sell it. I believe it's why Saint Pepsi stopped using samples after he changed to Skylar.

Vaporwave,3dyrv3,fugged_up_shib,2,Mon Jul 20 17:04:30 2015 UTC,"vaporwave was hyped in 2013  parody? analogy? pun? You're forming grammatically correct sentences, but you're making category mistakes (on purpose?)  There are certain anti-hype, anti-death aspects to vaporwave that make it different from everything else.  If you want to understand vaporwave, you have to understand how the vaporwave library is a central fixture of the vaporwave scene. This is very different from the past. In the past, the rock concert / rave part was the center of the scene. Now there are all of these...librarians?  Now, in the past, young people would go around trying to prove to each other how they were ""into the hip new thing"" before it became popular &c. but with vaporwave, it isn't hip, it isn't cool, it's pleb and filled with shit and intellectuals and librarians, so what happens is people help each other navigate to find the stuff they like.  I actually see vaporwave as a kind of celebration of Capitalism, its pathologies and its beauties. Which makes sense, really. If Capitalism is going to die, the librarians are going to want to preserve as much of it as possible so future generations can learn about their history.  To be honest, it's just extraordinarily complex. A proper understanding of vaporwave would include the history of the music industry, music marketing, the sociology of music, and in particular one must understand the difference between the ambient / experimental ""aesthetic music"" that strips out the social character and the mainstream genres of ""identity music"" that split along socioeconomic and racial lines.  So there is at least one Ph. D in there, probably a whole bunch. I haven't even touched on the intersection of aesthetics and Capitalism, the way Capitalism injects ideas of ownership into music and how this contributed to the current intellectual property laws...  The vaporwave scene is a bunch of apes getting excited about a monolith. First there was eccojams, then there was floral shoppe, and the current monolith we're grunting about is I'll Try Living Like This."
Vaporwave,3dyrv3,newkleuz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:52:44 2015 UTC,"by librarians are you talking about the people who make like ""/mu/ essentials"" types of images and flow charts and stuff? and like that youtube ""documentary"" on vaporwave, and that type of stuff? or something else? just trying to get this point a little better.   and in particular one must understand the difference between the ambient / experimental ""aesthetic music"" that strips out the social character and the mainstream genres of ""identity music"" that split along socioeconomic and racial lines.   completely agree, i've only really began to understand ambient music in the last year on a deeper level than ""it's really chill"". ambient music is meant to be immersive, so that you feel like you're in it - surrounded by it, or soundtrack-eqsue, so that it feels like the natural music to whatever setting you're in - hence the word ambient which means ""of or relating to immediate surroundings"".   in vaporwave, the reverb, phasers, delays, and other effects along with the often lo-fi characteristic really evoke a trippy dream state. the use of 80s and 90s samples and imagery certainly evokes nostalgia for people who were young at that time, like the producers who started the movement. the use of soulless corporate muzak appears to be a cheeky poke at capitalism - which is what makes me think the message is anti-capitalist - that's just my take. all together, the music kinda sounds like walking through a mall in the 90s while tripping on DMT."

Vaporwave,3dw9ft,Strugglesquad420,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:54:19 2015 UTC,I like some of your songs a lot. But I pretty much agree with the other posters that it would be awesome if it were presented in a different way. I mean vaporwave tends to rip of music that's all (or just mostly) packaging so it's nice to keep that same feel.
Vaporwave,3dw9ft,gwtkof,5,Mon Jul 20 19:04:33 2015 UTC,"this is probably the hardest thing about vaporwave to explain, and i've only gotten good at it (well, better at least) because of the advice of other artists like Hong Kong Express. you don't really have a unified aesthetic or ""brand"" per se, and because of that your music doesn't look worth checking into. when i went on your soundcloud, it isn't like there's this mysterious/anonymous entity from the depths of obscurity, giving off an eerie vibe. It's someone very sociable who likes vaporwave and has fun producing it. Nice, but not the same effect. I think that what you have to do is create some anonymous ""entity"" that isn't sociable, that is fascinating for the fact that the music has that ""found in the dumpster"" feel to it. Recreate the wonder we have when a piece of muzak plays in a waiting room, and our mind tries to imagine where it came from and its implied significance as a piece of art (does it have a song title? a hidden meaning?). otherwise, the music isn't bad at all"
Vaporwave,3dw9ft,BlueGnomeShrub,2,Mon Jul 20 03:36:46 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean (thanks btw for liking my music :D). But that's the problem with me, I think, I dunno really how to have that sort of ""anonymous"" vibe to my aesthetic, yknow?"
Vaporwave,3dw9ft,BlueGnomeShrub,2,Mon Jul 20 03:47:52 2015 UTC,"this is what i do now: i only publish to labels, nowhere else. if the label owner doesn't like it, i may just settle for an anonymous bandcamp. also, i really hate listening to vaporwave on soundcloud, because the way it automatically plays other peoples songs ruins the whole sporadic feeling of finding or stumbling on the music. the most amateur thing i've seen above all is when people try to reference names and titles that people know about, like characters from anime (Naming an album Naruto2001). The key is to be generic, non-specific. If you're going to reference something, make sure that nobody ever knows or finds out what the reference was. There are exceptions, but the point is basically that the album has to feel real, like it's part of its own little world -- not something fabricated by a Redditor.  Also, if you want to see some releases that achieve this effect better than anyone else, check out https://dreamcatalogue.bandcamp.com/ You will see exceptions all over the place, but pay attention to how they create their own little stories and snippets of otherworldly realities. Good luck!"

I'm pretty sure no one is ever expecting you to get them done at this point, so the only person you have disappointed is yourself. I know you had good intentions, but you also need to back them up by actions. Sending out several ""updates"" that didn't actually say anything wasn't really helpful, either.   I was supposed to be on this compilation so no hard feelings from me, but please be more serious about this kind of ventures in the future. Be reliable and stick to your word, but also be able to admit your fault and know when to quit."

Vaporwave,3dw5h5,elaiosome,2,Mon Jul 20 07:32:15 2015 UTC,"I'm new to vaporwave, but I use  Dexed (Basically a copy of the Yamaha DX7)  and TAL Noisemaker (Really simple triple oscillator synth) in combination with some VST instruments.   I can't handle FM synthesis at all basically, so for Dexed I only use presets (thousands available since it can load DX7 presets). But presets were commonly used in actual 80s music, so I don't feel bad about it. TAL Noisemaker is easier to understand, so there I use presets less often (though I still use them).   I get my desired tone by running the finished thing through a usb cassette recorder and then slowing it down a bit."
Vaporwave,3dw5h5,chadgarage,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:37:35 2015 UTC,I also highly recommend Dexed! There's so much to it that I'm in the same boat and use a lot of presets. The DX7 bass tone is ubiquitous across mid-late 80s funk/boogie/disco etc.

Vaporwave,3dw5h5,BuhDan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:15:10 2015 UTC,"I've recently started producing Vaporwave. After being a non-genre bound producer for 8 years now, I think I'm finally settling on this style. It's a combination of my abilities and sound.  Is the classic style, like Macintosh Plus, being moved away from? Or is it still desirable to hear this style?  I really enjoy both 2814 and Espirit  I'd like to find my own footing within the various sub-genres maybe leaning more towards 2814.  I have a concept for my first Vaporwave album, and have started on a track or two.  What do you guys want to see from new music, instead of kids just slowing down songs?"
Vaporwave,3dw5h5,stu_balls,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:52:09 2015 UTC,Yeah i'd say it's less desirable at this point and the genre has definitely moved in a lot of different directions since then. There are artists like death's dynamic shroud that have perfected that classic style and have made something unique with it though.

Vaporwave,3dt1uu,ArchdukeThe,5,Mon Jul 20 08:58:56 2015 UTC,Weird that hippies of all people wouldn't be interested. I guess it depends what kind of hippies. If this was the blues n roots folksy kind of affair with grandpas guitars then that's somewhat consistent. Like if this was more like a doof (or whatever you call illegal forest raves in your country) I think people would be plenty down for some Vaporwave on the chill stage. Like it's a bit different from say psytrance and even psybient but I think it'd play just fine there. It would be right at home at a glitchy electronic kind of show.  I guess what I'm trying to say is a chilled out electronic music loving crowd would appreciate it much more than one who's out for folky kind of music.
Vaporwave,3dt1uu,PLEASE_KICK_MY_ASS,4,Sun Jul 19 10:25:30 2015 UTC,If this was a bush doof I would definitely be down for some 3am vaporwave to go with the mushie tea.

I understand totally, they shouldn't have fucked your live but it's something you'll have to deal almost everytime. As an artist, I also went through pretty fucked up shows (I even did a set and there was only 2 people there and there weren't interested by the music) but in the end, the better is to be professionnal and do your thing until the end. You're there because some PA trusted you and your musical skills so in a way you have something to give back to this/these people. And even sometimes the show seems fucked, at least try to enjoy your time doing your things. It's always a chance. :) And never forget that PA know other PA, so if you leave during a live you can get a bad reputation quickly and lost opportunities to play your music. :)"

Vaporwave,3dt742,SpiritDrug,2,Sun Jul 19 11:12:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think vaporwave is more difficult to get than any other electronic music. It's generally harmonically pleasing and without any harsh frequencies, so it would fit well on any chillout scene. Electronic music is sadly a bit more difficult to find an audience for than for example rock, metal or folk, because of the weird attitudes people have towards electronic musicians.    I can only speak for my area, but there are plenty of festivals and underground scenes where basically anyone can play a show if they want to, and I've seen ambient, chiptune and even witch house artists live. There's even one place focused on ambient, harsh noise and experimental music."

Vaporwave,3drkir,theyremovingit,3,Sun Jul 19 13:49:13 2015 UTC,"Try looking at samples in a different light. In the place your are in now, the sample is the feature of the track. The center force. This isn't wrong but a lot more can come out of changing how you treat samples. Look at samples like they are instruments. Just another instrument in the ensemble of original synths and drums you have added on to it. This way, the sample is still effective but doesn't have to do all the work. This also will allow you to get more creative with your original additions to tracks.    I often avoid using multiple samples together at once. That being said, I have done it. In order to make such a thing work, you need to coordinate three things with your samples: Key, tempo, and time signature(and chord progressions). You can make your samples match keys and tempo using pitch and bpm shifting tools found in DAWs; Audacity has these tools and come in handy a lot. Time signature and chord progression is not an easy thing to change at all so it's best to coordinate this when looking for the sample to begin with. Once you coordinate things like this, multiple samples per track will work rather smoothly."
Vaporwave,3drkir,BlueGnomeShrub,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:00:12 2015 UTC,"We've all been through it -- my biggest piece of advice is to try and expand the genre -- do something that hasn't been tried yet. Get weird. Choose odd topics, too. It'll come to you if you get lucky and find something you can work with. Too often, I find myself with tracks that don't get up and move, so I just move on. Also, don't worry about making a bad release -- make something that resonates with you. Don't even follow everyone's preconceptions that vaporwave is supposed to be nostalgic, or that you have to slow down the music."

The ever popular midnight shopping mall.  One thing I personally cannot stand is people trying a bit too hard to fit the bill & bringing in stuff that just isn't vaporwave. The cover of DELTA金TOPCO's History Magic XYZ is an example of what I'm talking about. Using a 2007 Gundam series instead of any of the true 80's or 90's ones. Using Far Cry Blood Dragon-ish grid lines like it's synthwave/retrowave. Maybe I am too picky, but some people I feel just don't get it."

I received laser disc players last year and purchased a few laser discs.  I was recently browsing laserdisc videos on youtube and came across this laserdisc.  As soon as I heard that intro sound, I was like ""THAT'S WHAT'S IN THE NMESH ALBUM!!!!"".  THAT is what makes Vapor Wave so awesome to me.  It takes either popular or obscure media and presents it in a new and fresh way which in some cases is more fun than the original.  It has the warmth and rawness of homemade VHS movies and all other manners of nostalgia."

Vaporwave,3dp1s2,maruthegreat,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:13:35 2015 UTC,The reason they are often grouped together is because future funk formed as a subgenre of vaporwave. Artists like Saint Pepsi started out more vaporwavey but eventually developed the future funk sound. They also share some common aesthetic similarities like Japanese influences and an emphasis on nostalgia.
Vaporwave,3dp1s2,stu_balls,4,Sat Jul 18 05:12:07 2015 UTC,"future funk and vaporwave fall into the same type of genre, the thing is that while future funk takes a more upbeat and disco feel, vaporwave takes the more atmospheric and sometimes ambient approach. it's like comparing ""the field"" to ""deadmau5"", they are both house music producers, just catering to a different sound or even emotion. thats how i see it."
Vaporwave,3dp1s2,mhf93,3,Sat Jul 18 04:08:37 2015 UTC,"if it reminds you of french house or disco and makes you want to ""boogie"", it's probably future funk. if there's sailor moon or some other 90s anime on the cover it's probably future funk."

Vaporwave,3dk5sd,SebastienMS,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:43:10 2015 UTC,"Hey! Regarding whether you need to sample: there have been a few great albums that don't sample much or at all. For example Atmospheres by Eco Virtual or ESPRIT 空想's  Virtua.zip . But I guess the idea that you're delving into and reimagining and subverting aesthetics from the past is pretty crucial to the genre, so sampling is a big part of it."
Vaporwave,3dk5sd,FrobisherGo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:04:13 2015 UTC,atmospheres 1 is almost entirely sampled
Vaporwave,3dk5sd,StressCrimes,8,Sat Jul 18 02:34:25 2015 UTC,"The anti-consumerism / marxism commentary is very overblown. It's a neat part of the genre, but ""future past"" aesthetics and mining of disposable and commercially produced/influenced music from the late 80s / early 90s is more essential overall. It's about addressing the nostalgia and emotional appeal of music, art, and visual media that was never meant to be true or serious art, but  rather corporate styling, waiting room muzak, product design, etc. That distinguishes it from chillwave, synthpop, etc. Those are stepped in the novelty and straightforward appeal of retro sounds people always liked, not the re-appropriation and/or creation of more vague and hazy sounds of the recent past.  Also, regarding sampling, Eccojams influenced loops and sample flips are another major component, as well as chopped and screwed music to a lesser degree."
Vaporwave,3dk5sd,joshuatx,3,Fri Jul 17 04:26:39 2015 UTC,"Most producers use samples. but there is some really great stuff coming out that is all original recordings, first album that comes to mind for me is  コンシャスTHOUGHTS - Virtualization.

Vaporwave,3dk5sd,kawaikunakatta,3,Fri Jul 17 16:04:04 2015 UTC,"My question is, does one have to sample to invoke the sample feeling?   in theory not at all, bc you can recreate literally any audible sound with synthesis if you put the time in. however sampling has a kind of raw, inexact feel. its hard to describe what i mean (plus i'm super tired) but the ""sampled feel"" comes from imperfections in the audio imo. those slight imperfections would be really hard to create - and besides, if you're going for the ""sample feeling"" then it makes the most sense to sample.  what youve got there doesnt sound like what i typically think of as vaporwave, but if you wanna call it that then i say go for it. i'm a firm believer in ""the artist can call it whatever they want and it's that""  tl;dr technically yes but not really"
Vaporwave,3dk5sd,stu_balls,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:45:45 2015 UTC,"What you described are all aspects of vaporwave, and I would add that vaporwave usually sounds really dreamy as well (this can be accomplished in a number of ways though). A big part of vaporwave is how it is presented as well. Like I've heard that although 2814 seems like straight ambient music when taken at face value, the album cover and song titles reinforce the overall vaporwave ""feel""."
Vaporwave,3dk5sd,stu_balls,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:03:45 2015 UTC,"So is it possible for instead of being dreamy, it could be darker? Minor keys?"
Vaporwave,3dk5sd,StressCrimes,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:16:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think there's multiple ways of making a track seem dreamy besides just using hazy ambient synths or something. I'm no expert but the desired effect could also be achieved by making the track seem sort of unsettling or darker. Either way, vaporwave is a surprisingly broad genre and you shouldn't worry too much about following conventions."

Vaporwave,3dkxdz,BlueGnomeShrub,5,Fri Jul 17 02:40:53 2015 UTC,"This person wrote three paragraphs and the only thing people are discussing is that they're a Republican. So, I'll actually try and add to the discussion.   Iacon actually is a really, really good artist and people constantly hate on him for his behavior (which is totally understandable) but the fact that he's this person that the entire vaporwave community NEEDS to boycott and that they NEED to hate is a little ridiculous. This subreddit honestly isn't very grown up either, and I've seen better behavior from the younger people on this subreddit then from the supposed ""adults"" which is really a shame.    inb4 you're not grown up blehhh"

Vaporwave,3dkxdz,theflannelbeard,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:24:17 2015 UTC,"No, irony has a specific definition and what you're describing actually isn't irony. The word you're probably looking for is 'hypocrisy', but you think using the word irony somehow makes you come off as more perceptive. Generally when people put forward politics of any kind, it tends to be unpopular. I personally don't have anything against you being honest about your conservative politics at all. I think that's much more respectable than hiding it like the OP is doing. But when you do choose to push a belief or political ideology, you should expect to be judged by it and criticized for it. It can't be helped. No idea or belief is immune from criticism."

I've not pushed it on anyone nor will I ever but the fact that my politics is the source of tension and harassment towards me is pathetic and sad. not one have I ever forced it down anyone's throat and yet people are straight up abusing me tonight for it out of nowhere. :/ really you're misunderstanding me and what caused me to go ""hey, I'm getting harassed on down votes, what's going on"""

Vaporwave,3dh1vf,Treegrounder,29,Thu Jul 16 08:51:32 2015 UTC,"Vaporwave doesn't really make me feel sad, but I think I kind of see where you're coming from. I definitely feel somewhat melancholy while listening to a lot of vaporwave, and for me I think it has a lot to do with the idea of a sort of ""cultural detritus"" so to speak. It's hard for me to explain fully as I'm still forming the idea in my mind but I'll try.   A lot of vaporwave samples or is inspired by 80's muzak or music from commercials or video games and so on, music that once served a very specific commercial purpose and which now lies forgotten and disused by most of the population. It's almost as if vaporwave consists of the scattered pieces from the underbelly of this big cultural machine that constantly discards parts of itself to make room for new ones. To me, it brings to mind the commodification of music as well as the idea that there is so much culture constantly being created and then left behind, or tucked away into the dark recesses of cultural memory. Those thoughts definitely inspire some sadness in me.   Fredric Jameson and Jean-François Lyotard were both literary theorists that talked about the relationship that post-modern (particularly American) society has with its history. Basically, they argued that post-modern societies tend to view the past “through stylistic connotation, conveying ‘pastness’ by the glossy qualities of the image,” therefore creating a sense of historicity where “the history of aesthetic styles displaces the ‘real’ history” (Jameson, Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism, 19-20). This obsession with surface is a key trait of post-modern society according to Jameson.   I think this is relevant because in a way, vaporwave takes pieces of music that are all aesthetic and puts them together in a new context, reinforcing how ultimately hollow they are. Sorry for this rambling post, by the way. I ended up writing way more than I expected to, lol."

Vaporwave,3dh874,BlueGnomeShrub,-1,Fri Jul 17 02:56:01 2015 UTC,"So basically, be kind of secretive, stay underground, and don't be too public with releases? Although I'm confused about the alias part, do you I mean just don't make it publicized that I'm Percentage, or do you just mean never change my Reddit username to Percentage? If it's the first one I guess I should change it (my alias)."
Vaporwave,3dh874,SebastienMS,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:44:01 2015 UTC,"I've really wanted to start making Vaporwave (I think I have using 80s style synths, however no sampling.) but I'm not sure if I'm making Vaporwave or simply ambient. I'm trying to refrain from doing some sampling as I find getting the timing correct is tedious and gets me frustrated. I probably will create another soundcloud for my vaporwave projects."
Vaporwave,3dh874,pogemon,-1,Thu Jul 16 22:29:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah It's the same for me. I have another soundcloud where I make music (no Vaporwave), but I'm thinking of making another seperate one for Vaporwave, just to keep everything anonymous and underground. Although the difference with me is that I'm planning on doing quite a bit of sampling since I've gotten pretty good at it, and I suck at synth. As for the part about whether to go with Vaporwave or ambient, all I can say is, just go with your heart. Put something out that you are proud of and don't worry about what genre it is. Music is music. If you spend all your time trying to stick to a specific genre, it won't come out as well cause it'll seem like you just tries to go by a formula."
Vaporwave,3dh874,CRUMBLING_HOUSES,5,Fri Jul 17 04:46:30 2015 UTC,The anonymity is one of my favorite parts too. I think if it was a less anonymous genre we'd have a lot less releases because part of anonymity is that it is a shield to protect your ego.

Vaporwave,3dg5b3,larry-cripples,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:39:10 2015 UTC,"Always impressed with your work, guys. I understand you use Reason to produce, so do you only use effects native to the DAW or do you use external software?"
Vaporwave,3dg5b3,nickxenol,2,Thu Jul 16 05:34:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks, glad you like.  We both have a few things external to the DAW, but I think I can answer for Telepath on this and say we generally use Reason for everything 98% of the time. I also have Ableton, but I rarely use it - only for some specific things to do with samping that Reason can't do (but then I import into Reason for usage/mastering when done)  With Reason you can't use VST''s, but instead you have something called 'Rack Extensions', which is Propellerhead's version of VST's you can buy through their store - so you can stock up on various instruments/synths/effects/utilities and such. Due to the way Reason works, as it attempts to replicate hardware devices, they can all work in sync with each other rather than acting as individual elements, so you can create really unique stuff by wiring everything together.  Here's an example of some crazy CV wiring: http://rackextensionreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/CV-RackBackWiring.png  I've been using Reason for about 10 years now, and Telepath has for about 4 I think and we both swear by it haha.  You might know all this already as I assume you're well versed in music production due to your comments in the mastering thread the other day, but thought I'd post this for others reading who might be interested"
Vaporwave,3dg5b3,okjl,0,Thu Jul 16 06:39:47 2015 UTC,Thanks for the response. Reason 7 was my first DAW and I used it for a year before switching to Ableton. Now I can't imagine using anything else for my production haha.

Vaporwave,3daawq,Professor_Stupid,5,Tue Jul 14 19:35:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think a VST is really necessary.  Some DAWs have a feature to slice up a waveform and load them into a sampler really easily (beat/wave slicer). If yours doesn't, it probably still has a sampler. So all you have to do is cut up the audio where you want it to glitch/stutter and load those bits of audio into the sampler, and then sequence them where you want. You should also set the sampler to ""cut"" the note it is currently playing when the next note is reached, so it does not continue to play over the next sequenced stutter.  I know that sounds a lot like what you described you do live, but it will probably be a lot more accurate than using a VST. *Unless the VST is a sampler."

Vaporwave,3d9qtj,joshuatx,2,Tue Jul 14 16:35:33 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about Mastering or Mixing? Or both?  Mastering and Mixing are two entirely separate processes.  You should definitely be Mixing, and you should consider Mastering for sure.  An artist can simply compose a track (writing a tune or song with their musical talent) or they can also take on any or all of the following three roles...  Engineering - Basically controlling the equipment but with the experience and knowledge to take it beyond that and into a creative process of it's own, such as sound design or competently sampling and editing a loop, or whatever.  Production - Combining the composition and engineering skills with the ears to hear what is working in a track, what isn't working and the knowledge and inspiration to fix the problems.  Mixing - Taking the finished track and making sure that you've got space around the sounds, that they are at the right levels and so on. This really shouldn't involve any EQ, compression or limiting on the master output of the DAW, but a lot of artists like to think that they are Mastering engineers whilst they are mixing, and so you will find artists that do this.  Other people can also take on any of the preceding three roles, and in most pop music somebody else composes the track too - the 'artist' is simply used as a musical instrument (read 'puppet').  -------Drawing a line under all that and moving on------  Mastering is what is done when all tracks for a release are complete and mixed down. It is the process that the vinyl cutting engineer goes through to prepare an album for cutting the lacquer, or the process that a digital mastering engineer goes through to prepare an album for creation of a CD master. These engineers should have lots of expensive equipment in their studios and the ears of gods. They should be able to identify problems in your mix and help you to solve those problems. They shouldn't be drinking during their working day as a tiny bit of alcohol in your system affects your hearing. They should know the capabilities and limitations of the medium they are mastering for. Unfortunately nowadays they are often forced by the record companies to simply distort the music (Google 'Loudness wars' for an explanation).  If the artist so chooses, they can pretend to master their tracks. They can even be a bit clever and make sure the album flows from track to track with no huge differences in track volume or EQ that would be jarring to the listener. But, at best they are just doing a bit of post-mix adjustment and limiting, which for Vaporwave is probably fine, but it's not mastering. This is what I did for my album, but it wasn't mastering."
Vaporwave,3d9qtj,sikaflex252,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:16:44 2015 UTC,"Very helpful thanks! And yes, I was talking about post-mixing pre-release mastering, especially with multiple artists and tracks on the same compilation, and how to fine tune beyond simply adjusting the peak volume."
Vaporwave,3d9qtj,sikaflex252,2,Fri Jul 17 17:33:11 2015 UTC,"Well, unless you want to put a lot of money into the album, then just do what I did and pretend to master it. I've tried to write down some of the things I took into consideration when I did it. Hope this helps....  You are using Ableton (so do I!), so I would start there.  I just treated it like an Ableton DJ mix, especially as I had tracks fading into one another at points. Each track is eq'd and level'd so that there is little jarring from one track to the next (well, that's the idea - whether I managed that in practice I don't really know!). Remember - it's the perceived volume of tracks that matters, not what the level meter is saying. It could say the track is hitting 0db but it seems really quiet in comparison to other tracks because the other tracks may be less dynamic, so they seem louder when they are also hitting 0db and not clipping. Turn the loud tracks down, not the quiet tracks up.  Try to make sure the overall volume and EQ doesn't change greatly from one end of the album to the other. That's the tricky bit. I just dropped the cursor in on the loudest parts of each track in sequence and then randomly in quick succession so that I got a flavor of the levels across the whole sequence. You might find that light compression on some tracks helps to bring them up a bit without clipping, but remember you will be compressing and limiting the whole lot anyway so don't go mad with it.  Tracks with similar styles will need to sound close in EQ, but you don't need to boost up the tops in a droney intro track that is supposed to be lots of low frequency rumble to make it as bright as a Future Funk track that comes later in the album. So, make your EQ choices appropriate to the material and balance between that with the EQ flow from track to track. Try and sequence the tracks in a way that makes them easy flow into one another as well as making sense as to what should come next.  Use subtractive EQ rather than boosting if possible, i.e cut unwanted stuff and then turn the volume up if you need to, don't just boost wanted stuff.  Don't use any kind of warping, turn the Warp off on every track to keep the sound quality up. Add all the wavs on separate tracks in the sequencer. Move them about until they are where you want them. Then just get to work with the EQ and levels until the album seems reasonably close to how it should be. Remember that the EQs in Ableton have a HQ setting which you access via right-clicking the EQ and ticking the menu item. Use a spectrum plugin after the EQs to guide you.  Add your light compression and limiter on the master, then dump it all out as one Wav and chop up in whatever wave editor you have - or keep it all together for recording to tape. For tapes, you could master both sides in one go, just leave a gap from side a to side b and split into two wavs later on."
Vaporwave,3d9qtj,theflannelbeard,7,Fri Jul 17 18:26:14 2015 UTC,"Basic stuff:  Use whatever EQ device you want, take out the frequencies you're not using, boost the ones you are (not too much). You could also do a surgical EQ (very sharp dropping of specific frequencies) to take out the annoying/ringing frequencies to make it easier on the ear.  You could do some slight sidechain compression to bring out your kick if you're into that sort of thing (there are videos about this technique everywhere).   Then just boost/adjust the volume levels on everything until you get it sounding sweet and loud without clipping."
Vaporwave,3d9qtj,dreamcatalogue,3,Tue Jul 14 17:44:10 2015 UTC,"Spot on. If I may add ... set your master volume at -6db. Set each sample track at -7db. Once you are done chopping / editing / adding your own stuff then throw a limiter and softly raise the limiter gain to +2.4db. Then slowly, slowly slide that master level up until you nearly clip. You'll notice that instead of flattening the signal you will have increased your volume proportionally with little to no compression. Multiband Dynamics, if tuned right, will allow your sounds to ""fill"" the corners of a room on good speakers of headphones (so to speak)."
Vaporwave,3d9qtj,dreamcatalogue,3,Tue Jul 14 17:52:13 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say there is a specific level you need to raise you limiter gain to. I would put it up as much as you want, as long as you are getting no more than 6dB of gain reduction (any more would result in noticeable distortion)."
Vaporwave,3d9qtj,theflannelbeard,5,Tue Jul 14 17:57:31 2015 UTC,"If you push your limiter up too much you're going to ruin the dynamic range as Iacon said - unless that's the effect you desire I wouldn't recommend it.  On top of Iacon's advice which was pretty sound I'd also recommend using a soft clipping tool, if only a touch. I don't know how you would do that in Ableton or FL as I'm not so familiar with those programs, but you can do it on the in-built limiter device in Reason.  Really though with mastering, there's no one way to do it. It all depends track to track. I argue against needing to constantly reach 0.0db on all your tracks too, or normalising them post-render. I think a lot of that belief comes from the fact mastering tutorials online are usually based around EDM music, which probably does require your track to be consistently hitting 0.0db due to its style. It all depends on what you're making really. With Iacon's stuff, I can see why he wants his tracks hitting 0db, but if you're doing ambient or other forms of experimental music it's not entirely necessary. Basically, play it by ear.  I think my overall advice to someone looking to learn how to master is to just learn what all the different devices do exactly, rather than trying to tailor fit your mastering to one specific style, and then you can build from there."
Vaporwave,3d9qtj,theflannelbeard,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:45:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's my concern. I'm putting together some tracks of different vibes, some with crisp production and hi-fi compression on the beats, some purely ambient, some purposely low bit - like lofi 8bit, etc. Simply putting them all to 0db or -1db seems like it would be inadequate in terms of making them seem cohesive on one album."
Vaporwave,3d9qtj,theflannelbeard,2,Wed Jul 15 00:22:54 2015 UTC,"I come from an EDM background so my mastering usually ends up something like you said (hitting 0db). As far as vaporwave goes, I don't see it as something that has to be 'radio quality', and I don't look at mastering as a major part of production for this particular style of music. Some of the best tunes in the genre sound terrible from a mastering standpoint.   I look at vaporwave more conceptually rather than something that has to sound clean and professional, even if it does sound a bit better in the end if you take the extra steps."
Vaporwave,3d9qtj,nickxenol,5,Tue Jul 14 22:34:18 2015 UTC,"I still think mastering is important in vaporwave. Even if you want to get a lo-fi sound for example, it will sound better if you know how to master it to that style. Treating it as a shit genre only makes it shit. I master all my stuff with as much attention as I would if I was making EDM etc."

Vaporwave,3d9qtj,nickxenol,2,Wed Jul 15 03:12:11 2015 UTC,"True, but that is a good start point to raise to. I used to limit the hell out of it and nothing else, flattened my dynamic range :o"
Vaporwave,3d9qtj,nickxenol,2,Tue Jul 14 19:21:48 2015 UTC,"I do. I'll be doing a video of it soon, hopefully by Friday. I usually get into the full spectrum of analyzing frequencies, EQing in Stereo / Mono, being mindful of each instruments frequency range, expanding dynamic multiband frequencies, bus compression, sound synthesis and lots of routing to save CPU and make things easier.  EDIT: once you are proficient at this you can program a master_template that you can load in for ease."
Vaporwave,3d9qtj,nickxenol,2,Tue Jul 14 17:30:24 2015 UTC,"Nice, I look forward to it!"
Vaporwave,3d9qtj,sikaflex252,0,Tue Jul 14 17:38:44 2015 UTC,Most vaporwave musicians go for a lo-fi sound so they don't really care about how good the quality is.
Vaporwave,3d9qtj,theflannelbeard,2,Tue Jul 14 16:58:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not a vaporwave producer myself, but from what I understand, even if you're going for a degraded lo-fi sound, there are still good and bad ways of going about doing that. Too many people equate lo-fi with laziness. Mastering can still be used to fine-tune the mood you're trying to convey, even if it's not a 'clean' sounding one and I imagine there is still a lot of decision making involved. Some artists go through a painstaking process of running their tunes through tape-decks and VHS tapes."

But despite all that man creates, in the end nature ends up swallowing it all back up into paradise once again.   Also there's the whole thing with the female vocals occurring at the beginning and the end of the album which also occurs in Wagner's Ring Cycle through singing sirens who only appear and sing at the beginning and end of the work.  A very very good album that I really enjoyed. I have to say that I enjoyed the first half more but the second half does have some really great tracks.

Much to your astonishment, she is sitting, fast asleep, where you were just a few moments earlier. You walk over quietly, not wanting to wake her.  The elevator gives a dull ding and the doors open. She is standing in the elevator, waving. You look back at the chair. They are identical in every way, save that one is asleep while the other awake. She walks over and sits down where she is sitting, the bodies merging like ghosts.  Now a single being, she awakes, rises, and begins to dance. But it isn't really dancing, like a kid pretending to dance, a satirical parody of semi-coordinated movement.  You join in, attempting to mimic the movements, but she ignores you. This carries on for a few minutes before she breaks down in hysterical laughter, clearly amused.  A few moments later she disintegrates into a wave of vapor leaving only a fine mist."
Vaporwave,3d53jm,newkleuz,3,Mon Jul 13 22:32:03 2015 UTC,"You breathe deeply, inhaling the purple droplets suspended in the air in a shape vaguely reminiscent of her human body.   Immediately, your heart rate nearly doubles. Your field of vision shifts so that another plane of existence comes into semi-focus, overlaid on top of the one that the monolithic office lobby occupies.  You can faintly make out shifting patterns of light. They begin to move toward you, immediately. As they close in, they begin to come into focus and appear to you as many small children. The children surround you and you begin to become nervous. They are watching you; seemingly analyzing your actions and plotting their next course of action.  Small ovoid openings appear where each of the childrens' mouths should be. As this happens you start to experience a vibrating sensation that begins behind your eyes. The sensation intensifies and you feel a rush of endorphins splash through your brain. The children are singing to you!"

I had noticed several post of ""Vaporwave for X?"" (fucking, data entry, driving). The concept of ""Vaporwave for waving"" just seemed like a funny idea to me, but then I started thinking that there's actually quite a bit of emotion in a wave. I thought maybe people would post tunes that gave that fleeting sense of a human connection in a modern world. Certainly I did not use my full effort at writing this, just hammered out something really quick."

It's a bit cliche-sounding to mention it at this point, due to its status as being the most popular vaporwave track to date, but still considered classic.  James Ferraro - Live at Primavera Sound 2012 (over 20 minutes). Honestly takes a while to fully pick up on the vibes of this one, but once you do it's incredible.  Lastly, any telepath album is guaranteed to be great, and since most of them are long anyway they'd be perfect for what you're looking for. This thread's top comment is a great introduction to the extensive and masterful discography of telepath:  https://www.reddit.com/r/Vaporwave/comments/2sydim/a_guide_to_the_t_e_l_e_p_a_t_h_%E3%83%86%E3%83%AC%E3%83%91%E3%82%B7%E3%83%BC%E8%83%BD%E5%8A%9B%E8%80%85_opus/cnu3f0u  The other comments have good suggestions as well, but hope that helped and good luck in your searching!"

The thing is, I became interested in vaporwave because of the concept and aesthetics and community more than the music itself. The aesthetics drew me into being interested in the music. Because I know the deepness and complexity of the enigma that is vaporwave, I have started to like the music itself. For example, when I first heard vaporwave and had no idea what it was, I was very indifferent to it and uninterested. It wasn't until I learned about Vaporwave itself that I saw it's interestingness as an incentive to look more into this genre and actually listen to it. After listening more I've started to really like it. But vaporwave itself is much, much more than a simple music genre."

I just like the music.  I'm primarily a hip hop dude and I listen to sample based music all the time, this is just an extension of that for me.  The more the genre has grown the more it has devolved into memelord dipshits jerking their dicks around at each other on one extreme and a small number of talented artists doing their own thing and pushing ""vaporwave"" out into different musical landscapes on the other.  There is tons of bullshit to sort through but that's sort of part of the appeal, it's like crate digging records"

Vaporwave,3d3274,angrypotato1,2,Mon Jul 13 09:38:19 2015 UTC,"Just as a consumer of all this stuff, I would say the aesthetic definitely plays a big part into what I download. I tend to always pick out releases where the covers and the presentation of the whole body of work have some sense of consistency. Case in point being this project.  I mean I'm sure there's definitely something to experimenting/combining different aesthetics in a single work but it isn't personally for me. Like I personally don't get anything out of death's dynamic shroud.wmv's work (No offense, like it's good stuff and I recognize it but it does nothing for me after repeated listens) but I'm all over telepath's stuff.   But that's what's amazing about this genre just the sheer diversity of it all. But personally, I tend to notice when an artist puts an effort into how they present their material.   The whole DMT Tapes/Keats/Fortune/Dream/BC/Stratford CT. record label aesthetic is great for organzing similar releases with similar aesthetics. But I really tend to pay attention to artists who can generate qulity presentations without relying on memes and focusing on creating original experiences.   Best way to explain what I mean is by referencing Shima33 - Museum. Basically I like my vaporwave laid back with a side of existenialism."

Vaporwave,3d3274,limegreen_genesis,13,Mon Jul 13 08:09:08 2015 UTC,"plenty of upvotes while most of the actual great tracks that people post either hardly have any upvotes and are often downvoted a lot, and usually only the ones by more popular artists on more popular vaporwave labels are noticed at all.   I am a lurker here, but I wanted to comment on this from my view. The daily amount new music posted on here is staggering. When opening random songs, I am either faced with audio ""hyjinx"" of sorts (just really bad low-effort stuff), someone who has a small idea what they are doing and wanted to join the club (we've all been there when starting out), or really good stuff. The good stuff is completely lost in the ocean of new releases, and it doesn't help that some of the better producers have multiple pseudonyms which makes it harder to find repeat quality by the same artist.   There was that thread a few days ago https://www.reddit.com/r/Vaporwave/comments/3cv0re/list_of_vaporwave_labels_that_have_cropped_up/  5 labels in a few days? Saturation levels have to be reaching a climax at some point.   I just think it's very confusing. Not to mention that Vaporwave is becoming more and more popular with certain crowds (and a lot of teenagers) and there's tons of new people jumping on the Vaportrain. If the huge influx of new people, new producers (many seem to have just downloaded their first DAW), and readers all have a vague or specific idea of what Vaporwave sounds or looks like, then of course they will parrot it back to each other because that's all they know.  In /r/makinghiphop they have a daily feedback thread where people can post songs with the requirement that they have to respond to someone else's song before the day is up. I think something like this might help separate and contain the newer producers or people who just want to post one song from people who are releasing EPs and LPs and ones who are already established. That does require moderation, though."
Vaporwave,3d3274,puddlebutt,4,Mon Jul 13 08:06:25 2015 UTC,"I might be alone here, but one of my vapor-beliefs is that the genre will go wherever it will go, and it will still be vaporwave. I think with Vaporwave being so dynamic of a genre (""is this song supposed to be ironically terrible? -- You decide!!!""), the definition of the genre itself should be the same way.  If it goes to shit, it goes to shit. But at least it will still be vaporwave. I feel like we're going to be punishing the people who might be enjoying their own ""version"" of vaporwave by demeaning them in ways like this. Their appreciation of Vaporwave isn't wrong, it's just different, less mature and less educated. And that's okay!!! I'd rather someone that is interested in vaporwave and not educated, as opposed to a smart person not interested in it, but still partaking in community efforts to shit on people.   I dunno man just let the kids do their thing, and observe the way the genre changes. It's been a fun ride the last two years for me personally, I'm really curious to see how things change as time moves forward.  Maybe this mentality will kill the genre, and if it does,  it still makes for wonderful, positive memories of the genre that once was. But I don't think this genre will die anytime soon. I believe it might stay in some sort of vague shadow of a subgenre for a long time.  I love discussion of this shit, it's so neat!!!"
Vaporwave,3d3274,Ooobles,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:11:05 2015 UTC,"i mean... the thing is....  vaporwave is still super young. even hiphopheads, a place which takes the music (in the more establish genre/culture) relatively seriously, consistently shows moments of memes and immaturity. its the internet, this is where that stuff lives and breeds. and when something starts to gain recognition or attention, as vaporwave evidently has, the negative side of things will come with it. not to mention a certain that a percentage of people exist who will have a strong skepticism about vaporwave regardless.   the real world will happen, its how you react to it and what you give attention that matters. not to say you're part of the problem, but a post like yours equally gives attention to the stuff you consider shit-posting. I suppose my biggest point is to try and keep a realistic expectation for a sub-reddit of a small cyber-genre... especially on a website like reddit lol  To reply to the actual OP I don't separate the music and the aesthetic because they exist together... One would not survive or be nearly as engaging/interesting without the other."

It's because a song takes a minute or two to get the full feel while a picture or a short text post like the one you mention above takes a second to fully take in. This is why they made the vaporart, vapormemes and vaporaesthetics sub-reddits. Post about art, meme, or just aesthetics go there, while the this sub-reddit is for music and discussion."
Vaporwave,3d3274,Iamfivebears,7,Mon Jul 13 04:13:57 2015 UTC,"This is the correct answer. Because of how reddit functions, easy to consume content like memes are easier to absorb and vote on, so people are more likely to mindlessly upvote them and move on. This is a common phenomenon all over reddit, it's not unique to vaporwave."
Vaporwave,3d3274,dreamcatalogue,44,Mon Jul 13 12:31:27 2015 UTC,"Agreed, it's very dispiriting and makes me want to abandon the whole word ""vaporwave"" at times. I truly love the concept of vaporwave and what it could be, but it's constantly being dragged down into shit by memes and useless crap and dumb threads like that one you linked which is at the top of this sub, a sub that's supposed to be dedicated to music and art. I guess ultimately the scene itself dictates where the movement goes, but in my opinion the stronger it leans towards memes and tumblr art, the less I want to be associated with it.  It's a weird thing, in where this new surrealist cyberpunk dream art and music movement, perhaps the most inspiring thing I've ever come across in my life, has sadly been conflated with memes and bad net art for some reason.  I know I'm not the only person who feels like this, there are many prominent producers in this genre who have grown to resent this aspect of the genre and I feel like a lot of them are going to abandon ship eventually. This sub is really the hotbed of vaporwave on the internet, but it just gets drowned in crap posts constantly and the whole presentation of the sub doesn't help with its pastel shades and roman statues that are so akin to Tumblrwave, so to me it's a massive disappointment."
Vaporwave,3d3274,VHS_SPACE_CREATURE,2,Mon Jul 13 04:09:48 2015 UTC,"I think the issue is that most people do things in a mediocre fashion. Which is not to say that they're wrong or bad, but just that they're human. I do believe though that the majority of producers on here really do care about vaporwave and have a lot of respect for the bigger artists, whether or not they like Yung Lean.  Other than that, I think the example you've made with Dream Catalogue has completely revolutionized the genre and set a great example for new producers. I always recommend DC before any other label (sorry guys)."
Vaporwave,3d3274,Manila-Automat,2,Mon Jul 13 15:19:15 2015 UTC,"It’s been hard trying to conjure up original content with the sudden boom of net art/ vaporwave hashtags on tumblr (which I also am guilty of using). There have been many pieces that are aesthetically pleasing and does evoke a particular emotion or environment. Yet it seems they use the same bits and pieces thus producing more material than substance. In the long run, it could either lose steam or evolve to appeal a wider audience (case in point MTV’s redesign).  This recalls to the sudden boom of Memphis-inspired design through out the 80’s. What was meant as a movement that countered the ""form vs function” ideology in the field of design eventually became a seasoned style. Rendering the original intention of the movement meaningless. And yet today, people tend to appreciate the style liking both the original and the knockoffs. Maybe because it built an environment in its own space and time. Vaporwave could go to that direction, on one end you have an immersive world-building side of the genre and an aesthetically-pleasing-memeish corner on the other."
Vaporwave,3d3274,newkleuz,-6,Mon Jul 13 13:01:58 2015 UTC,"surrealist cyberpunk dream   OK, I think I understand. You want to make video game and movie music. I have just the subreddit for you: https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunk_music  Derelict is an excellent soundtrack, but it is not vaporwave. I hear neither ""surrealist"" nor ""cyberpunk"" nor ""dream"" in either eccojams or floral shoppe."
Vaporwave,3d3274,flesjewater,2,Mon Jul 13 05:27:25 2015 UTC,I can't believe you just said that to dreamcatalogue.
Vaporwave,3d3274,newkleuz,0,Mon Jul 13 18:40:22 2015 UTC,I can't believe you're taking vaporwave seriously.
Vaporwave,3d3274,dreamcatalogue,13,Mon Jul 13 20:51:52 2015 UTC,"Eccojams isn't vaporwave, it inspired vaporwave and became so commonly talked about amongst vaporwave that it sort of became part of the genre  If you don't think Floral Shoppe has surrealist or dreamy attributes and doesn't display aspects of cyberpunk in its thematic presentation, then we're going to have to disagree 100%. The terms surrealist and dreamy can also be applied to Eccojams, too as a matter of fact.  All you have to do is read the opening line of this article by Adam Harper, the writer who popularised the theme of vaporwave   Global capitalism is nearly there. At the end of the world there will only be liquid advertisement and gaseous desire. Sublimated from our bodies, our untethered senses will endlessly ride escalators through pristine artificial environments, more and less than human, drugged-up and drugged down, catalysed, consuming and consumed by a relentlessly rich economy of sensory information, valued by the pixel. The Virtual Plaza welcomes you, and you will welcome it too.   While I disagree with some further elements of his article, this passage is ultimately what vaporwave is to me, and extensions of that are what the real genre is.  What I don't view as vaporwave is memes and seapunk-inspired net art such as statues & fiji water bottle stuff. A lot of stuff also considered vaporwave, such as future funk, isn't vaporwave either in my opinion. That's not a criticism of future funk either, it's just trying to point at how many different ideas have been brought together under this one term to the point where the genre makes no sense anymore and why you get so much different stuff all brought together.  That's just my take anyway.  I agree though, /r/cyberpunk_music is a great sub, maybe I'll just post there from now on instead. At least they have good content control and memes and dumb threads don't end up at the top of the page"
Vaporwave,3d3274,newkleuz,2,Mon Jul 13 05:37:47 2015 UTC,"The ""dream"" in ""dreamcatalogue"" implies full on dream mode, an evolution of vaporwave's hypnagogic roots. If you're dreaming, then you've passed to the other shore...the hypnagogic transition has completed. And it's an awesome shore.  But, ah, how should I put this. Vaperror for example is something I could listen to at a pub or club. It is awfully coherent for vapor. More like ""liquidwave"" if you ask me. Very sexy."
Vaporwave,3d3274,dreamcatalogue,3,Mon Jul 13 06:13:33 2015 UTC,"I think Vaperror definitely has some vapor-ish qualities to his music, much more so than future funk for example, even though fact Mana Pool could easily be seen as a collection of hard hitting tracks as much as Saint Pepsi could be too. But he uses a lot of dreamy jazz chord synths in his music that creates the same kind of effect, and the visual presentation of his music in general is quite similar to a lot of vaporwave, or at least in a similar spirit of it.  I would say on Dream Catalogue though, he's one of the least vaporwave artists for sure, but I think he still fits the bill alongside other trap-influenced vapor artists like Blank Banshee or Saiba 98.  That said, I've never actually explicitly stated Dream Catalogue is a solely vaporwave label. From day one, I've always called it ""dream music"", which I suppose is just my own personal tag to publish these collection of artists I dig and that I feel sort of have some kind of vague unified theme.. sounds similar to my definition vaporwave in a way, but it can differ slightly at times, e.g. Vaperror or Fluence"
Vaporwave,3d3274,dreamcatalogue,4,Mon Jul 13 06:17:03 2015 UTC,What do you consider Eccojams to be if it's not vaporwave then? Plunderphonics? Chopped and screwed? Personally it's probably still my favorite Vaporwave-ish album in any case.
Vaporwave,3d3274,Badlands_Syd,9,Mon Jul 13 05:57:33 2015 UTC,"I think it's fair enough to call it vaporwave to some extent, or ""proto vaporwave"" as people have dubbed it, but it lacks any kind of visual component which is what vaporwave is really about in my opinion - the expression of a certain theme to coincide with the music.  Cause if you think about it, all this music we make, including Eccojams, isn't entirely original or specific enough to be credited as its own genre. Lots of it could be classified as ambient, lots would have just been called experimental or avant-garde music in the past. V/VM (aka The Caretaker) was fucking around with kitsch pop music a decade before Daniel Lopatin was, and I bet there was more before him too.  I guess that was the initial point of the whole 2814 project, when me and Telepath first started it - to try and display how vaporwave isn't a specific style of music but rather a vague artistic abstraction that you can pull from various styles of music - like ambient, experimental, chopped & screwed and such, and how it's really the overall presentation and package that makes it vaporwave, which is why we specifically made the entire 2814 project original music from the start. It sort of took on a life of its own after that and became much grander than we originally had envisaged, but hope you get what I mean there  I liken it to progressive rock of the 60's-70's, which was heavily reliant on concept and theme in its presentation - except vaporwave generally goes one step further a lot of the time to the point where the entire Artist/Album/Art package is one overall concept (Eco Virtual or Telepath for example) - hence the reason anonymity is key.  But yeah, a lot of Eccojams would certainly go down well in a vaporwave mix of course. Chopped & screwed techniques, and use of reverb, delay, phaser and other basic effects are quite prevalent in the genre as it emphasises the dreaminess.. vaporwave as a music genre can be quite vague and hard to explain, as it encompasses various different styles, but I think the overall quality of the music is that there has to be some element of dreaminess to it. In this regard, it would be easy to drop a Boards of Canada song in a vaporwave mix too, but of course they're not vaporwave.  As an aside and to clarify a previous point I brought up: this is all why I think future funk shouldn't be conflated with vaporwave - as there really isn't any dreaminess to it, they're just straight up bangers for the most part. The reason future funk does get conflated with vaporwave is due to Saint Pepsi's past association with the genre, and then the popularisation of Macross and Yung Bae after him who were following in his footsteps and also previously referred to themselves as vaporwave.  Again, this isn't a criticism of future funk as I actually enjoy some of it, but I just view it as a separate entity. I think it's cool that it's like a ""cousin"" genre, and there is many artists who crossover into both territories which is great, but it's still not vaporwave to me."
Vaporwave,3d3274,dreamcatalogue,7,Mon Jul 13 06:11:27 2015 UTC,"I think I finally understand the point of Dream Catalogue and 2814 now. It makes perfect sense and I applaud you. So maybe you should completely disregard my earlier reply to you and stick with the vaporwave term. I'll come clean, for a long time I associated your label with a certain arrogance and elitism about what vaporwave should be, although I always liked the music. That was my own close-mindedness. But after actually seeing your posts and opinions, not just this post but posts in several other threads, I think I get it - you don't think you own the term, this is just your version of what vaporwave can be as a movement, and I suspect you're actually open to other people's versions as well.  So I'd like to apologize. While I've never caused you any trouble or made negative remarks like it seems some have, I've had a certain opinion of you and your label that was close minded and frankly just incorrect. So I'm sorry for that, and I wish you much success."
Vaporwave,3d3274,xxzxcuzx__me,2,Mon Jul 13 14:25:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, I appreciate it and glad you can see what I'm getting at. I'm definitely open to other people's versions of vaporwave and I think the strength in the genre will lay in its continued evolution into new territories - sounds and styles, whether that's by DC artists or by others. I still follow all the other labels in this scene and check out as much stuff by self-releasing producers as I can too (which is how I find a lot of artists I release from) and I'm always open to releasing stuff on DC that pushes the concept in new directions"
Vaporwave,3d3274,xxzxcuzx__me,-1,Tue Jul 14 21:14:00 2015 UTC,"usually only the ones by more popular artists on more popular vaporwave labels are noticed at all   that's because everything else either sucks or doesn't give anyone without an immediate interest any reason not to assume they do. if you see good posts you like, upvote and comment on it or whatever. but right now almost every post on the front is music, excuse us for wanting to have a giggle now and then"

Then stop being so lazy and check out some of the other releases? It doesn't take that long to preview a track or album to see if it's any decent.

Vaporwave,3d2et5,NoBruh,3,Thu Jul 16 05:39:00 2015 UTC,"The intellectual property rights of the original artists featured in eccojams and floral shoppe (such as Diana Ross and Jojo) could have been cited in a copyright infringement case. No such case has been filed (yet). Nevertheless, these rights are how the means of production for works of art become privatized in a Capitalist economy.  This gets back to how a physical copy of a CD is created: if you already own a CD burner, then all you need are the bits, the digital information. So the ""means of production"" is contained in the bits, and the bits are privatized by the laws.  Floral shoppe and eccojams simply decline to respect the privatization laws in two ways: (1) treating the means of production for those original recordings not as property but as raw material for a new artistic process (2) largely ignoring the opportunity to privatize their own work.  This critique boils down to conflicting with the pre-existing idea of treating art as private property. This particular trajectory for vaporwave was never fully developed. It was as if the community said, ""no, let's not go down this path"" for whatever reason.  tl;dr Do you see how http://i.imgur.com/s3PV6jA.jpg represents the violation of private property / intellectual property rights? Do you see how vaporwave makes similar appropriations of the works of others? Do you understand how Capitalism is based on privatizing the means of production? If you start questioning the privatization of the means of production, then you start questioning Capitalism."

Vaporwave,3d2et5,superblurryanimals,0,Mon Jul 13 13:57:28 2015 UTC,"the reason you don't understand it very well is probably because it is just a projection by people with an anticapitalist agenda. very little releases have to do with critiquing consumerist society. but I guess it still is important to understand what those projections actually are  http://www.dummymag.com/Features/adam-harper-vaporwave   this infamous article by adam harper sums up pretty well what people who don't entirely understand vaporwave think about it. keep in mind it was written in 2012 and represents only a certain time in the history of vaporwave, which is telling of anyone who still keeps this interpretation of vaporwave made in 2015.  http://www.dummymag.com/features/essay-invest-in-vaporwave-futures  be sure to read the follow up though. still remember that this article was written even before Dream Catalogue existed, whose artists spearhead what the genre generally means today"
Vaporwave,3d2et5,flamewarist,-3,Mon Jul 13 02:59:14 2015 UTC,"Basically, a bunch of pretentious people on the internet tried to be edgy and make vaporwave into half meme, half enlightened socialist thought-food.

It wasn't until some clever people revolutionized the genre (Blank Banshee, Hong Kong Express, blablabla) that vaporwave become basically apolitical -- as it rightfully should be. But fyi, on this sub don't talk about Marxism -- people get very annoyed that vaporwave is still associated with seapunk and all that tumblr crap.

Vaporwave,3d2et5,VHS_SPACE_CREATURE,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:07:22 2015 UTC,"Vaporwave in that sense is a reflection of the absurdity of capitalism. Since the genre often relies on heightening the mediocrity of the sample material (elevator muzak, commercial muzak), the listener sees how ridiculous it is. The reason why vaporwave is based on nostalgia is usually because of our hindsight being 20/20, allowing us to see the material in its cheesiest. It's no wonder why people aren't slowing down verizon commercial music; to us it's ""futuristic"". Of course, not all vaporwave is about the capitalism aspect (or really most of it isn't) -- the nostalgia factor simply makes us feel weird. Whether or not we've heard the particular song, the vibe it gives off reflects something special, whether it is loneliness, sadness, alienation, blind happiness, oppressive evil, or naivete.  Also: producers like to joke about the rise of Global Capitalism, an economic situation we find mundane today -- but represented as this dark, evil future. It flies in the face of Orwellian ideas about the dystopian."

And they were pioneers of music, and ""science fiction"".... Computers in 1981? They made a whole album about it in that year"
Vaporwave,3cylui,MetatronLived,2,Sun Jul 12 03:09:09 2015 UTC,"You should look into Yellow Magic Orchestra. While Kraftwerk got the ball rolling, YMO did some pretty cool stuff around the same time. Or at the very least, check out this song."

Vaporwave,3cz9cc,haeshdem0n,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:20:43 2015 UTC,"for what it's worth, i have still never listened to lopatin's eccojams in my entire life (although i've long been a fan of 0PN). originally i just liked slowing down music and adding reverb because it was fun and easy lol. and i wanted to hear more of that in vaporwave so i just did it. i think the biggest influence on me was probably マイケル·ジョーダンLINCKOLN's ""Now That's What I Call Music! Vol. 2"" and floral shoppe of course. that said, i was /aware/ of lopatin's eccojams when i started making music as dds.wmv. after i started eccojamming, i got into the idea of making eccojammed mashups, particularly with pop songs and video game music, so tbh that's what most of my work under dds.wmv has been up to this point. eccojamming is probably my favorite common vaporwave trope."
Vaporwave,3cz9cc,dinosauronfire,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:01:48 2015 UTC,"I love the skipping and pitching on that album, and i wish it was taken even further. It's not random at all, it's like a cubist painting where you can see multiple angles at the same time. It dissolves traditional concepts of linearity and time in music, and i think that was well overdue (i know that there have been avant garde artists doing this for decades, but still.. ;))  I've been working on a collab album with my gf (yes.) which focusses on that whole skipping-part. It will probably not be as nice to listen to as eccojams, but i think this is a very interesting field and i wish more vaporwave producers would do that."
Vaporwave,3cz9cc,curbcobain,2,Sun Jul 12 22:38:49 2015 UTC,"It's more an exploration of loops and how you can loop something to make it sound different in some way - mostly by slowing the loop down and adding delay, but also by cutting it up a bit, or looping off-bar so that a different chord change is created from the chord changes of the original, or modulating the speed with an LFO or whatever. That's what makes Eccojams special, because it's not just taking a huge chunk of a song, it's taking one, two, or three little bits. That seems to be something that a lot of artists who came afterwards have completely failed to understand. Not dissing, just pointing that out."
Vaporwave,3cz9cc,sikaflex252,2,Sun Jul 12 13:35:41 2015 UTC,"A2 is my jam.  My version has titles instead of letter/number schemes...should I change it?  It's the first vaporwave album I downloaded, also because of similar Ecco the Dolphin memories.  Some of it I really don't enjoy...tracks with a lot of skipping and hooks I don't care for. But the tracks I like, I love.  My favorite track is ""Lightning Strikes."" I don't know the letter/number title. I really dig the fact that what was the buildup to the hook originally ""you see your gypsy"" is completely cut off. Lightning strikes BECOMES the hook. And there's still a tiny bit of the g in ""gypsy"" that isn't cut off. I love it. Musical blue balls turns into an orgasm of its own, especially with repeated listens."
Vaporwave,3cz9cc,amajorseventh,2,Sun Jul 12 06:29:14 2015 UTC,"Stick with the titles, the versions with letter/ number schemes do stupid stuff like put 3 jams in one track. OPN posted his own videos and soundcloud tracks with proper titles and also released some of the jams on other albums.  Nobody Here - https://soundcloud.com/oneohtrix-point-never/nobody-here  Lightning Strikes was on his Soundcloud a while back but it's gone now.  Angel - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN0czUMRMU8  Demerol - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-ZnSTglHn4"
Vaporwave,3cz9cc,sikaflex252,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:42:22 2015 UTC,"Is there a 1:1 match up between the titles and the tracks? Even if 1 track has 3 songs, I'd rather remember ""Nobody Here / Angel / Demerol"" than A/B#.  Discogs list both sides of the tape as untitled and they are usually pretty accurate. It seems like some songs were rereleased or given a title later.  Still, I wouldn't mind being able to keep track of the songs better. I'll probably add the title in parenthesis after the ""A/B#"" just to make future reference easier."
Vaporwave,3cz9cc,sikaflex252,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:20:20 2015 UTC,"Discogs goes by what is written on the media and it's packaging - which is very little in the case of Eccojams. They put 'untitled' cause there isn't anything on the tape to say what it is.  If you are using the rips with 'A1, A2' etc... then IMHO they've misinterpreted where tracks start and stop, so it's kind of wrong. It's just how the ripper has interpreted the fades from one track to another.  Stick with using whatever actual titles Lopatin has provided and whatever you call it yourself, so as you say 'Nobody Here / Angel / Demerol' and maybe 'I Know That Door.... / Where'd You Get That Information From? / Castles In The Sky' or whatever you want to call those tracks. In my interpretation it's a track per song sampled."

Vaporwave,3cxnfu,jonp93,5,Sat Jul 11 19:13:35 2015 UTC,"I feel like ""synthwave"" is similar to the ideas behind retro future, new retro wave, there's alot of words. Maybe nu-disco applies too.. It's emulating and expounding on the synth and electro fueled dance music of the 80s and early 90s, often coupling it with very specific imagery, I'm thinking Lazerhawk, Miami Nights 1984, etc. This music tends to be more driving and dancy, more produced, alot of the times more aggressive (see Dance With the Dead). Those are just some observations. In contrast vaporwave is less specific sonically, and uses both original and sample based methods coupled with imagery (titling too) that evokes a certain theme. Most musical genres happen to function this way aswell, think about the imagery that is so strongly associated with all genres of metal. Vaporwave sort of depends on the context it's put in, usually creating experiences for the listener. It feels dumb to say but the experiences can evoke futuristic, lonely, unsettling, sterile, and calming feelings. It's tough to explain without sounding like an idiot but there are differences, just spend some time with the music and you understand a bit more."
Vaporwave,3cxnfu,tradesandcopys,-1,Sat Jul 11 18:52:11 2015 UTC,"The basic thing with synthwave is recreate the sound of the 80's with original music... And vaporwave ist basically sampled music. There are some ""original music"" vaporwave artists but that's the major difference"

Vaporwave,3cv03l,retrotechsounds,3,Sat Jul 11 06:10:05 2015 UTC,"That's great and all but as far as I know a ""public"" Bandcamp label is impossible for a lot of reasons, and really defeats the purpose of a label to begin with. If you want something like that really the best course of action is to make a Mediafire/MEGA account and a SoundCloud account, upload your shit to both, and put a link to the Mediafire/MEGA account in the description on SC, and then tag it as Vaporwave.  Plus, what's really the point of a public email when you can just make a subreddit exclusively for songs and not discussion? That seems like it'd be much less of a headache."
Vaporwave,3cv03l,Lets_All_Rage,2,Sat Jul 11 05:01:59 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what 'Floatsoft' is doing, which is why it will be successful."
Vaporwave,3cv03l,_html_,3,Sat Jul 11 05:48:26 2015 UTC,"I think vaporwave.me it's the perfect website for that... it's in hiatus right now but from what I know, It will be ""open"" again between this month and august. Just like domotobin said, self-releasing is nice this days, I released 2 albums in the last week and I had an awesome feedback, so I think it's good time to producers to release albums by itself."
Vaporwave,3cv03l,tradesandcopys,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:49:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know. I was thinking the same thing with this idea being something that randomly popped into my head while also thinking about vaporwave.me's hiatus. I didn't really mean for it to be taken into real consideration, just a thought."
Vaporwave,3cv03l,domotobin,3,Sat Jul 11 00:54:20 2015 UTC,"I think the public email idea is interesting, but strange and possibly problematic (people could possibly abuse the email address for other things, no?). I think the vaporwave.me database would be a better approach, if it were maintained. In the meantime, I think self-releasing is perfectly fine in many cases, but I also think there's room for just one of the new netlables to get some traction and fill in DMT's niche, if you will.  Btw, here's a list I just compiled of the new netlabels that I've seen since Wednesday, just to offer some perspective."
Vaporwave,3cv03l,SockMice,3,Sat Jul 11 00:31:38 2015 UTC,"This would be cool, but I think Vaporwave.me (while currently on hiatus) basically serves that purpose. As someone who falls into the ""label right after the DMT incident"" though, I want to point out that it was never my intention to replace the label, in fact, a Vaporwave label is an idea I've had for awhile now, I just ended up starting it right after the collapse, not knowing how many new labels would start out from this event."
Vaporwave,3cv03l,_html_,7,Sat Jul 11 00:30:08 2015 UTC,I feel like 'Floatsoft' should stick around.
Vaporwave,3cv03l,ezzysux,2,Sat Jul 11 02:52:02 2015 UTC,gem tones seems pretty legit
Vaporwave,3cv03l,_html_,3,Sat Jul 11 03:58:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of Gem Tones' stance on money and that it is Bandcamp based.  I feel that 'Floatsoft' will be very successful, because all of its releases are completely free (as vaporwave should be) and relies on Mega to host downloads, eliminating the need for free download credits, which are required by Bandcamp."
Vaporwave,3cv03l,retrotechsounds,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:35:56 2015 UTC,"What's your opinion on MEGA vs MediaFire. We don't know who to host mirrors with yet, which is why we haven't mentioned it yet."
Vaporwave,3cv03l,_html_,2,Sat Jul 11 06:11:30 2015 UTC,"I personally have always used MediaFire to host my downloads, but to my knowledge they are very similar and it comes down to preference.  A major con to MediaFire however, is that you will occasionally be taken to an 'AdFly' page before you can download a package, which is obviously inconvenient for the downloader.  I'm starting to see a lot more people turn to Mega for their download hosting and I would personally recommend it over MediaFire, at least from a consumer's standpoint, as I myself have only ever used it to download music from other people rather than host my own content."
Vaporwave,3cv03l,pega1,2,Sat Jul 11 06:45:41 2015 UTC,"The money isn't particularly a huge interest for me, and I'm currently working on setting up MediaFire links for future releases. I completely agree with you and am working to improve on what I've established."
Vaporwave,3cv03l,_html_,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:51:05 2015 UTC,"Sounds good. I'm just going by what I saw on your post. I'm sure the label is going to deviate from its initial strategy and evolve into something great, which I'm looking forward to. :)"
Vaporwave,3cv03l,chitejin,2,Sat Jul 11 04:59:11 2015 UTC,"Sorry if I missed a link, but what was the DMT incident?"
Vaporwave,3cv03l,domotobin,3,Sat Jul 11 02:49:29 2015 UTC,"There were disagreements between the head of DMT (Vito) and a couple artists on his roster, which eventually caused Vito so much stress that he decided to ""end"" the label. There a few more releases in the pipeline AFAIK, but once they're done it will no longer be an active label. The bandcamp will remain up though."

Because filming in vhs isn't vaporwave.   I recommend you to leave the judgment behind actually enjoy music for more than 10 seconds,   I don't enjoy this type of music you have made, perhaps in some way without lyrics i may like it or elements of it, I just know that most music like this has terrible lyrics."
Vaporwave,3cvnuw,dsprox,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:51:21 2015 UTC,"Well i'm not going to quote everything you replied because i'm writing from the android app, but i will tell you this: You don't really need to understand the lyrics, as with a lot of vaporwave releases. Just try to listen to notes and melodies and flows and everything in between, that's the whole point. The lyrics, if you are interested, talk about a certain way of living that we all try to find. Peace and quietness, at least for me. It also talks about a dark place i been during my short lifetime, due to shitty thing happening in my childhood, that i don't even want to think about again.  Now i know you say ""i know that most music like this has terrible lyrics"", but let me tell you that with that actitude you are not going to find music that makes you actually feel different. You will be stuck in a genre or in a set of instruments, and trust me you don't want that.   If you want, i could give you the instrumental of the song, produced by Aszilations. That way you would hear, that even though it doesnt have the ""elemental"" parts of vaporwave, i like to think it still is. It still has that abandoned feeling, that distant emotion and that new age instrumentation. If you think just because i didnt sample a fucking song from the 1980s, that i didnt do 'vaporwave' then you are whats making all those dumb people go ""vaporwave is dead""."

Vaporwave,3cqi8v,KontrolGold,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:32:26 2015 UTC,"it's interesting to read some of the replies. i suppose there is a divide between the ones that use the 'genre' mainly for political/social purposes vs. solely for relaxation chill etc.   the former look for tension, and pushing the listener into an uncomfortable conceptual corner which requires confrontation; the latter buy much more into the good/bad producer industry rules thus indulging in what can easily be considered pop music with a spice. either way, because of the nostalgia factor it can sometimes function as both quite successfully.   Zizek has some good points about something functioning in society despite the fact that no one believes in it, e.g. Santa Claus. with VW, similarly, one can become a victim of the ""chillness"" forgetting that in a lot of cases that was the starting of a critique, not a hedonistic conclusion ;)"

Vaporwave,3crgt3,nickxenol,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:50:00 2015 UTC,"I really enjoy it! It reminds me heavily of Oneohtrix Point Never, but it still feels original if that makes sense. The artwork that accompanies it compliments your sound really well too."
Vaporwave,3crgt3,nickxenol,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:54:21 2015 UTC,Thank you. That album definitely takes inspiration from OPN and some of James Ferraro's 2008/2009 stuff but I wanted to create my own sound with it. Does Floatsoft have a Twitter? I'm going to send it there right now.
Vaporwave,3crgt3,nickxenol,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:03:03 2015 UTC,It doesn't at this point. I was planning on setting up both a Facebook and Twitter page for it though.

Vaporwave,3cquj8,goobergrape199X,3,Fri Jul 10 13:55:34 2015 UTC,I enjoy how your music is very light-hearted and silly. It almost seems parodic to how seriously some take the nostalgia element of vaporwave. You turned the theme of reading rainbow into an eccojam and it worked great for some reason. Keep it up
Vaporwave,3cquj8,Inovox,3,Fri Jul 10 02:02:26 2015 UTC,Thank you! That's what I was going for. When I first was listening to vaporwave I thought it was the most comedic and brilliant genre out there. I just like to preserve that type of vaporwave. I am currently working on more material that is funny and treads lightly into the serious vaporwave in a good way that doesn't get snobby.
Vaporwave,3cquj8,Inovox,2,Fri Jul 10 02:11:29 2015 UTC,SCHOLASTIC BOOK FAIR 199X マジックアイ [DELUXE] is the most vaporwave album title I've ever heard haha

He has a very unique style.  It's not overly complicated or flashy, but you can always tell a Rashad track from other producers which I think is interesting."

Not only that, but I feel that this movie fits pretty well with the entire ""critique on capitalism"" thing that Vaporwave was built upon.  I think some of y'all would really like this movie, and I would love to maybe see this segment considered for a Hyperbattle some day!

Vaporwave,3com8f,intedjekt,5,Fri Jul 10 01:31:05 2015 UTC,"I agree with the review mostly. I found the album to be kind of dull. Not bad, just not great or anything close to the duo's previous efforts. Though I have to give them credit for changing up their formula a bit."
Vaporwave,3com8f,goobergrape199X,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:59:50 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with you! But tastes are tastes; there's a lot of people enjoying the record, so that's what matters in the end for the artist (even if I don't agree with the people saying it's the best vaporwave record of this year.)"
Vaporwave,3com8f,Lindsheaven,5,Thu Jul 9 21:21:28 2015 UTC,"Guys it's cool it's just C monster that's his style. he probably could've have given it a 3.5 ;p but he had to keep himself in check due to some personal connections to Keith who was also once a TMT writer/artist. He wasn't even sure if they would let him publish it but i'm glad they did. Keith, c monster and I are actually all from the same midwestern city and I know exactly the Chinese buffet he's talking about haha.  EDIT: He's not panning it btw - the first three paragraphs he's basically using a narrative to abstract the emotional context of the album, I really liked his interpretation."
Vaporwave,3com8f,HCMJ,2,Thu Jul 9 17:55:40 2015 UTC,"That was...interesting. There's the seed of a good review in here, I think. I just don't think the reviewer took any time to polish it. It almost feels like they were so wowed by their own ingenuity they just hit the 'submit' button as soon as they finished the first pass spell check on the rough draft."

Vaporwave,3com8f,wannabgm,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:43:50 2015 UTC,"Same. I hope more artists of the less ""ambient"" variety take inspiration in the future. In fact if it weren't for my rabid Death Grips fanboy-ism, this would probably be album of the year for me so far."
Vaporwave,3cqaob,ChiptuneGhosts,2,Thu Jul 9 22:31:20 2015 UTC,"Reverb, lots of reverb. Also being able to work with each individual drum sample's independent reverb settings and volume can help a ton."

Vaporwave,3cqaob,nickxenol,3,Fri Jul 10 03:38:27 2015 UTC,Those drums you listed as an example don't sound natural at all. That is clearly a synth snare...
Vaporwave,3cqaob,IAmBecomeGay,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:21:39 2015 UTC,"Sorry I miss worded that, I meant how can I make my drums not sound as isolated?"
Vaporwave,3cqaob,palmettooo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:43:58 2015 UTC,"i'm not sure i really understand - do you mean how to make them sound less sterile and ""apart"" from each other? i hope i'm getting you right.   i think what makes the drums work in this song is how downshifted and saturated they are. i love the sound a snare makes when it's down 5 or 6 steps, where it's almost like a low tom with a blast of white noise. i think with a combination of pitching down, light reverb, and saturation, you'd get this effect fairly easily."
Vaporwave,3cqaob,palmettooo,2,Fri Jul 10 05:54:39 2015 UTC,"yup, sounds like a pitch shifted 909 beat to me."

Vaporwave,3cl62x,SMEGMA_CHEESE,2,Thu Jul 9 06:22:38 2015 UTC,"Hey man, saw you at TT The Bears last year in Cambridge, MA and I was really impressed with how quickly you got the crowd motivated and dancing like crazy!  Looking forward to seeing you at Great Scott later this month and bringing more friends with me this time!  I apologize as you must be getting this question a lot at this point, but when did you make your decision do transition your project to a full live band?  I would love to see other producers in the vaporwave  / future funk genre follow in your footsteps.  Did you find the switch difficult?"
Vaporwave,3cl62x,barrollroll,2,Thu Jul 9 05:42:32 2015 UTC,Hit Vibes was really fun too but I was kinda messed up when I made it.   Messed up how? It's cool if you don't want to answer because it's too personal... I'm super curious though. You can PM me if you're shy lol

Maybe you've answered this before, but what's the disco/soul sample on ""Hit Vibes""? And do you think you'll send out those tapes/discography downloads from your old kickstarter?  Also, if you're ever in Nova Scotia, Canada you have a shitty apartment to crash at. You seem like a legitimately cool guy."
Vaporwave,3cl62x,Rainbow-,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:23:57 2015 UTC,"Hey man! SSX is my favorite game! :) The song from ""HIT VIBES"" is ""I wouldn't change a thing"" by Johnny Bristol.   And yes, yes, definitely yes! When I started that kickstarter I was going through a pretty bad time at college and ended up dropping out due to the depression. I've worked my way through most of it and part of the benefits of working with Carpark involves being able to print physical goods at a higher quality, so I've been waiting but the package I'm gonna send is way beyond what I was offering :) if you donated, you helped me buy the first piece of equipment I ever had to make SP stuff with, so you're kinda the reason I'm doing this right now and I can't thank you enough."

Vaporwave,3cl62x,PhilosophicalToilet,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:02:07 2015 UTC,"Well holy crap Saint Pepsi is on here.  I guess my immediate question if you're still answering is: Do you also find vaporwave to be very nostalgic to those who grow up in the 80s/90s?  Do you also listen to vaporwave and find it to be similar to an opium-drenched fantasy to explore lost or hidden aesthetic experiences creeping from the past?  btw thanks for everything you've done, it's pretty great."

You are a big part as to why I'm immersed in this genre now, always lifts the spirit.

Here's my very first edit that you inspired ~ video , 9 months later I'm still learning and making new vids when I find music that gives me that special spark of motivation.

I loooove VentureX and Wasted Nights/Vector Graphics, LOVE Solitaire and pretty much anyone you'd pick off the KEATS roster, and as far as vapor goes I've been hella into the death's dynamic shroud.wmv and t e l e p a t h records these days :)"

With gaining more and more exposure, what is the hardest aspect of balancing your personal life and being in the public eye? What is your personally favorite album, top to bottom, that you have produced?"
Vaporwave,3cl62x,mitchFTFuture,14,Wed Jul 8 20:52:56 2015 UTC,"The hardest part is learning to not get upset by the really fucked up shit you read on the internet, and remembering that some people forget that I'm just some 22 year old on the internet who makes music. some people say some really offensive things but you have to learn not to be offended by it. growing a thick skin. I love Empire Building because there's a complete story behind it, I pieced it together like a movie and it came out the way I wanted it to. On Hit Vibes I just tried to prove myself as a producer. it was sort of my gateway out of a really bad depression, and it opened a lot of doors for me and so those two are the most important."

Vaporwave,3cl62x,Jillzean,5,Thu Jul 9 00:00:11 2015 UTC,"Oh, rad! How's it going?  I was actually thinking about this the other day: I feel like in your transition from Saint Pepsi to Skylar Spence you really upped your production game, and it sounds as though you've abandoned sampling in exchange for original recording. I guess my question is, are your new tracks all original recordings or have you just gotten really good at sourcing unheard/obscure stuff for samples?  Also, any chance of a vinyl release of Prom King?"
Vaporwave,3cl62x,DJzap152,12,Wed Jul 8 20:41:02 2015 UTC,"It's mostly original recordings, but I do flip the occasional sample every now and then :) I'm working on a new project that will be more sample based and I'll probably ""officially"" launch it later this year, but keep an eye out on soundcloud because I can't keep secrets!"

Vaporwave,3cl62x,shikatozi,5,Wed Jul 8 20:33:12 2015 UTC,Producing.
Vaporwave,3cl62x,Strugglesquad420,3,Wed Jul 8 20:35:29 2015 UTC,"Oh shit what's up!   Like most people here, I am a pretty big fan. Honestly, I am curious about the future direction of your music. With Prom King sounding like a natural progress of the future funk/pop from your earlier releases, what's next?   Major congrats on making it man, really awesome seeing how far everything has come since the F500 days"
Vaporwave,3cl62x,gtipwnz,5,Wed Jul 8 20:23:38 2015 UTC,"Hey, I was definitely excited to see you live at Firefly and you didn't disappoint! How was the rest of the festival for you? Did you stick around? Also just a broad kind of question here: what direction do you see yourself going in musically as Skylar Spence? Any recent influences you can point to?"
Vaporwave,3cl62x,Strugglesquad420,4,Wed Jul 8 20:19:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for supporting us at Firefly! :) We left pretty soon after we played because of the impending storm, but everyone we met and talked to that day was fantastic! As far as Skylar goes, i definitely want to hit a unique sound, I want to do something different every album and I'm always influenced by something else. as of late, I've been listening to a producer named Jack J a lot, and the new Jam City record, and Air France! So maybe something on the subdued side as opposed to Prom King, which is pretty maximal overall."
Vaporwave,3cl62x,Strugglesquad420,5,Wed Jul 8 22:32:28 2015 UTC,"Do you still play your Saint Pepsi stuff live? Also, I noticed you're playing Beach Goth. Are you looking forward to any of the other bands playing?"
Vaporwave,3cl62x,VirtualSquid,14,Wed Jul 8 20:11:56 2015 UTC,"So far, we have worked out live renditions of ""Mr. Wonderful"" and ""Private Caller"". We'll be working out some more old material for when we hit the road in September, too, but these upcoming dates in July (DC, Philly, NY, Boston, Toronto) we mostly preview new material from Prom King. I swear it's good though!  And yeah, just saw the Beach Goth lineup today. I'm really excited to see Mr. Twin Sister; they put out one of my favorite albums last year and are coincidentally a Long Island-based band as well! I'm also a pretty big fan of Camera Obscura, and I'd like to see DIIV as well."

Vaporwave,3cl62x,frenchy612,3,Thu Jul 9 09:25:33 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Private Caller is a sweet ass track (probably my favorite of yours). I just saw you at Electric Forest in Michigan and I fucking loved your set. I only got to see your first set and not your late night set and I didn't get to rock out as much as I would've liked to because I was babysitting a random dude that was on acid, but I loved it. It was criminal that your crowd wasn't bigger (everyone there was all about the godawful jam bands -__- ). I was surprised you didn't sing live (you played one or two new tracks but with recorded vocals)- I was looking forward to seeing some of your new stuff with you singing. I'll just have to catch you in the future ;)  Did you stick around for any other sets at EF? My favorite besides you would have to be Phantogram for sure. Even though Josh wasn't playing that show, they fucking slayed."

Vaporwave,3cl62x,ValetGirls,8,Wed Jul 8 20:01:24 2015 UTC,"""Saint Gatsby"" was one that was being thrown around. I wanted to move as far away from ""SAINT PEPSI"" as possible, because if i wasn't going to be able to use that name, I wanted something completely different to just start over. ""Skylar Spence"" was really the only one I could consider...I couldn't picture using my real name to make the music I make either"

Vaporwave,3cl62x,nevik23,19,Wed Jul 8 20:01:13 2015 UTC,"I'm really glad to have made music that people like enough to share with their friends and ask me to play shows. I've had this dream of being a musician since I was a little kid, and I don't know what will come of it but I'll never look back. I'm really nervous about how my new album will be received, and I'm already looking towards writing the next one...i never really feel like i'm ""in the moment"" if that makes any sense. it doesn't feel like anything, except for when it hits."

Vaporwave,3cnxe7,theflannelbeard,6,Thu Jul 9 14:37:46 2015 UTC,"Listen, Iacon, I know you and Vito are good friends but we really can't avoid the truth of the matter that he has done some pretty unprofessional things. I completely agree with his points about not paying artists. With the way he has the label set up, it makes total sense that all the money goes back towards free downloads and it is inconsiderate for artists to ask for a cut when Vito is paying for free downloads out of his own pocket.   But denying an artist's right to their own music is completely unacceptable. If an artist wants their album down, it better be taken down. When artists come to Vito to submit music, they hope and trust that the respect they give him and his interests are given back in return for their own interests. Vito broke that trust by denying several artists' requests that their albums be taken down.   And it only gets worse when Vito attempts to defend this poor treatment of artistic interests by claiming that an artist's music is not ""valid"" because it uses samples. You especially should know that this is completely untrue since you have put out great albums using heavy sample content. It's also absurd that Vito expects to effectively run a VAPORWAVE label when he has this ""eye for and eye"" belief about samples in relation to artistic merit. He isn't helping anyone by believing that musicians on his own label don't deserve artistic credit just because they sample someone else's work; not the vaporwave community or the original artists that get sampled.   Vito did a lot of good for the community by creating a label that makes it easier for newer artists to get attention and recognition, but the fact that he quietly undermines and ignores those artists' creative rights to their own music as creators is unacceptable. He basically held artists' music hostage. That is what separates him from labels like Dream Catalogue and Business Casual. When John from BC and I were working out stuff before releasing my album on his label I asked him about my rights to my music to make sure I can still do what I want with my music. John kindly and enthusiastically assured that the rights of the music released through his label are held by the respective artists and that the only license he ever takes with the music as the label owner is using it in occasional compilation albums(like Digital Office), of which he still asks artists' permission for.  Vito is a great guy who holds a very special enthusiasm for what he does but he has definitely made many mistakes along the way that just do not appeal to artists who wish to retain rights and control over our own music and artistic creations."

Not that it pertains to the issue at hand, but you slandering me on Neon Nights was a little uncalled for as well, considering I have yet to say one negative thing about you or Vito.   -EDIT-  Would like to reiterate one more time I have no ill feelings towards you or Vito, and if you would accept my skype I sent you in a private message I would still love to hash this out like adults so we don't have to keep on having these little run ins."

Recently, the owner of DMT Tapes has had falling outs with artists, and a lot of confusion has been created surrounding this event. This press statement will hopefully clear up a lot of the confusion surrounding the event.  What happens now?  The previous owner has left the label and cut off all communications to me and the public. I will ask you all to not try and find him again, he has requested his leave, we should be respectful enough to allow him to leave in peace. Let sleeping dogs lie. As for the label, he did not leave me with access to the Bandcamp, so I am sorry to say that DMT Tapes FL is no longer an operating label. All artists who are signed to DMT will now, upon request, be signed to Commercial Dreams Ltd. The previous owner has agreed to leave DMT Bandcamp up on the internet.   What happened?  Quote from OSCOB: ""How this is started is my friend, Twitter user modernsqueeze (aka GALAXIAN aka Bonus Fruit) made an innocuous tweet wondering why his album (that was set to release on DMT today) was not getting the kind of promotion that all the other albums on DMT had gotten (aka a multitude of updates on r/vaporwave. Well after Vito saw this, he was promptly dropped from the label and denied his release. I took issue with this and said his behavior was unprofessional, which he tweeted back to me ""This is my hobby, not my profession.” From there things began to spiral out of control. Vito mades some awful statements to me and modernsqueeze, and even sent me a nasty message on Skype. Before I knew it Luke made the original post on the DMT Facebook.""  In regards to the money debate  This is my public statement to Shima33. I apologise on DMT's behalf and my behalf that your money was not given to you, but as of now we need to move on. If it's all the same to you, I'd like to drop the money incident, forget it and move on. I know it isn't my money that isn't being given, but I would still like to end this conflict here and move on.  To the public  This is my personal 1 on 1 with you guys. On behalf of DMT and CDL, I am sorry for what has happened. I know some people have grieviances, but if it's all the same to you guys I would like to leave this behind. Leave it as a cautionary tale of what not to do. Now some might be wondering why I am leaving some info out, that's because what I left out I feel like it doesn't need more attention than it already has.   As for the DMT Tapes x Commercial Dreams partnership, that is 100% over. CDL is no longer associated with DMT Tapes in any way shape or form.   Conclusion  Hopefully now we can stop the fighting after all this has happened. This is important to me because I started out CDL as a thing to make people happy, and this transfers onto the way I live. I see people fighting and upset at each other, and it honestly hurts. I legitimately feel sick looking at so many people opposing eachother. I really hope we can all leave this incident behind and move onto vaporwave's bright future. My apologies if this isn't especially professional, I'm tired and stressed out the ass about this. But in conclusion. DMT made some extremely poor decisions that cause mass amounts of infighting, and this incident should be looked back on as a cautionary tale of what not to do.  Thank you for reading this far, Luke""  THE STATEMENT FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO DOWNLOAD IT OR ARE ON MOBILE"

I feel like the whole community's had a wedge driven through it because of this whole thing.   Just so we're clear, though - me and Vito are no longer on good terms, and I want nothing to do with him, or whatever he's got his hands on."

Vaporwave,3cm8ez,StormGaza,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:30:48 2015 UTC,"No worries. Question is, will the community let it go? Somehow, I think not."
Vaporwave,3cm8ez,CLSosa,4,Thu Jul 9 02:52:01 2015 UTC,I hope it will.
Vaporwave,3cm8ez,StormGaza,3,Thu Jul 9 02:52:37 2015 UTC,Thank you very much!

Vaporwave,3cm8ez,theflannelbeard,-1,Thu Jul 9 02:52:38 2015 UTC,"So, now that DMT is defunct what will happen to any money made off albums on the label? I have a sort of ""support the artist & label"" mentality when I purchase albums so I want to make sure the artist gets my money. I saw this money policy annoucement today but since that is from the founder I am assuming it is null now. I just want to make sure my money will go to the right person.  Edit: Alright, It seems apparent that money does not really matter when it comes to these artists, it is the music first money second (or not at all in some cases). Was just curious on the monetary situation on the label but it seems very clear that it doesn't matter as much I previously thought."
Vaporwave,3cm8ez,StormGaza,3,Thu Jul 9 01:35:22 2015 UTC,You mean all $5 dollars of support MAYBE per artist? lol. I'll paypal you 5 right now if you want it. Give me a break.
Vaporwave,3cm8ez,theflannelbeard,-2,Thu Jul 9 01:58:25 2015 UTC,"I don't have that much money to spend on albums. I just want to be sure it goes to the right place. A little money can go a long way. If the dude wants to buy however many Arizona's I don't care, I just want to know where the money goes."
Vaporwave,3cm8ez,nickxenol,5,Thu Jul 9 02:02:55 2015 UTC,As an artist I say fuck $5. Wake me up when it's 5k
Vaporwave,3cm8ez,StormGaza,2,Thu Jul 9 02:28:31 2015 UTC,"Heheh, I guess you have a point. I don't intent to spend my life savings on a single album. I guess money is just less important in this case than I previously thought."
Vaporwave,3cm8ez,nickxenol,2,Thu Jul 9 02:37:59 2015 UTC,amen lol
Vaporwave,3cm8ez,Strugglesquad420,2,Thu Jul 9 02:37:05 2015 UTC,"Vito explained that it goes to keep the albums cheap. If he doesn't pay the credit bill each album goes to $7 automatically via bandcamp until credits are paid. He didn't get to the point where he could pay out artists.   I'd love to point out that he would have paid artists if he had more downloads and could afford it + payouts. But he clearly explained he never got to that point. So.  Also, when you buy an album your rank seemingly increases on the Vaporwave (or other) Bandcamp tags.   He's been a best bro to me for a long time. I wish people would stop getting mad over the wrong thing. There are those in this community who have literally tried to tear him apart for many bogus reasons and it saddens me when people are overly concerned with money in a genre that can do without money."
Vaporwave,3cm8ez,StormGaza,2,Thu Jul 9 02:07:22 2015 UTC,"Alright, that makes sense when put that way. I just have this mentality to always support the artist, especially with the current state of the music industry. I'll probably gonna just buy the album on the label as is. As someone who has only found DMT Tapes recently it sucks that it has gone defunct and all this drama has happened. I do hope everyone can move on.  Thanks."
Vaporwave,3cm8ez,Strugglesquad420,4,Thu Jul 9 02:13:27 2015 UTC,"Like I said ... certain individuals are to blame here for letting their head get too big. Too thirsty for their Arizona tea ... lol.   Seriously, if you want to support an artist pay $1 buck for their album on Bandcamp to help their ratings / listens and give them views on Soundcloud / or a follow.   This is not a genre to make money in and people have forgotten that. Regardless of your views I'm sure you can agree with that."
Vaporwave,3cm8ez,Incarta95,3,Thu Jul 9 02:32:02 2015 UTC,Very little money was actually made from the label. Vito payed to keep the albums free.
Vaporwave,3cm8ez,StormGaza,3,Thu Jul 9 01:53:16 2015 UTC,"I understand, many many thanks to him for that. I just want to be sure where the money goes since I doubt Vito is still paying for free albums.  [On a side note: How are the albums free? Whenever I go to the page there are just a bunch of ""buy now"" buttons, not really any free download buttons like I've seen on other bandcamps. Just curious.]"
Vaporwave,3cm8ez,Strugglesquad420,2,Thu Jul 9 02:06:29 2015 UTC,"""Name your price"" gives you the option to pay. However, you can still pay nothing, just type in ""$0.00"""
Vaporwave,3cm8ez,stu_balls,3,Thu Jul 9 02:26:13 2015 UTC,you ever type in 3.33 then worry you're paying 300$?

Vaporwave,3cmddi,theyremovingit,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:02:14 2015 UTC,Should I try out this new subscription service Bandcamp is offering for artists? I think it would be really cool to be able to be able give my biggest fans access to exclusive material and discounts on physical releases(if I ever do that on my own) while also making a little money from it. My only problem is: Would anyone actually buy a subscription to Cobalt Road??
Vaporwave,3cmddi,theflannelbeard,2,Fri Jul 10 01:53:13 2015 UTC,"Hey all! Hit 600 followers yesterday. Thank you so much!   I want to discuss sampleless vaporwave for a moment. Had an idea about creating pure 70s funk tracks without samples, cheesy, funky, groovy, sounds high pitched ... then export and downpitch it, THEN chop it up, throw better drums, bass, etc on it.   Has anyone tried this? I imagine it's pretty difficult to ""fill all the gaps"" in sound. I haven't even tried using a white noise (or pink noise) to fill space on my tracks now, but none the less I wonder what would go into it and how the results would be. Haven't tried it due to work schedule yet.  Thoughts?"
Vaporwave,3cmddi,theyremovingit,2,Thu Jul 9 15:16:08 2015 UTC,"I have tried this. Listen here. It definitely helps to learn a little about funk production and composition so you really get that authentic sound. White or pink noise would also definitely add to authenticity, especially if added before downpitching and chopping. Give it go, I'm interested to see the result!"

Vaporwave,3cmddi,CLSosa,2,Thu Jul 9 05:53:31 2015 UTC,"As a producer, and as a listener, I've heard dope shit and I've heard whack shit from this sub, but after this whole DMT Tapes thing I've come to see how tight everyone really is and how much this not just genre of music but borderline lifestyle means to people, tight."
Vaporwave,3cmddi,theflannelbeard,-1,Thu Jul 9 02:22:32 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a lifestyle. Unfortunately we have a scene where greedy artists don't listen to reason and decide to witch hunt an innocent label. If we saw the greedy artists for who they are then we'd all be much, much tighter. Even I myself feel distanced from this community as a whole because of a few pricks who take people, and me, down."

I'm still very new to producing and I'm not very good/experienced but I appreciate you guys giving my music a chance. My first EP came out today and I'm kind of bummed that it was drowned out by all the infighting that went on but I would appreciate it if you guys gave me some criticism!"

I love you all! <3  Also, keep tuned to early 2016 ;)"
Vaporwave,3cmddi,tradesandcopys,3,Thu Jul 9 01:42:22 2015 UTC,"First of all I'm so excited at this. I released my debut album last week and I had some good feedback and I want to thank y'all. It's been a hard week for everybody, all drama between producers and labels. That made me think about something: We all part of a community. Everyday, we all post things about this amazing genre. And I think that is the point: make music and spread the love. That's why I got into this. And everyone has to help. Buying albums, comment on posts, helping the new artists, advise each other, etc... I want to say thank you and I hope this whole thing we'll be forgotten. LET'S KEEP MAKING AESTHETIC!"
Vaporwave,3cmddi,Dreamcaster95,2,Thu Jul 9 01:34:57 2015 UTC,"First off, I'm glad to have joined this community!  Out of curiosity, how would the artists here feel if, for example (and this isn't something I will do), I released an album of your songs but chopped and screwed, or slowed down, or side chained with a kick drum? Would you be offended if I didn't credit you at all and released it under my own name?  This isn't to criticize the structure of vaporwave, as I've literally done all of those things when making music. I'm just curious. I would imagine if the tables were turned, artists wouldn't feel too hot.  Thoughts?"
Vaporwave,3cmddi,Lindsheaven,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:10:02 2015 UTC,"Not really. I'm stealing stuff from smooth jazz player on YT all the time to release it as Lindsheaven, so I honestly I think that there's no reason to get mad of it :)"
Vaporwave,3cmddi,wannabgm,2,Thu Jul 9 01:36:04 2015 UTC,"This is subtly off-topic, but I noticed you went slightly away from a hip-hop/beat-oriented influence of vaporwave on your first album into something more sample-based. Would you say that's sort of a subconscious trend for you artistically at the moment?"
Vaporwave,3cmddi,Lindsheaven,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:18:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly? I never know, hahaha. All my records are sort of a musical progression I made on vaporwave. ""In Construction"" was made when I didn't know anything about vaporwave and how to sample/find some stuff properly but, since I started to know how to make stuff that sounds closer to it, I just followed it. I never let my hip-hop influences aside though, thinking something like ""oh, I'll be moving away from hip-hop now"" or something like that. To me, its following records, ""NTSC Memories"" and ""Nordwrong"", still pretty hip-hop-ish at some points, even if I'm sampling/doing something pretty different, if you ask me.  I just do what it sounds cool on Ableton, never with a preconceived idea. The only exception was with ""Watch Their Loneliness"" EP, which I preconceived the idea of making a nocturnal record by only sampling Italo Disco, inspired by some bad things it happened with my life at the moment.  But, for my new album, some of the new songs will come back to hip-hop beats, but not too amateur-ish as IC was. It's just... you know, I just love breaks and chillwave-y hard hitting drums, hahaha!"
Vaporwave,3cmddi,wannabgm,3,Thu Jul 9 14:12:34 2015 UTC,"Dude, don't keep putting down that first release of yours (In Construction). Seriously, it's like an outsider masterpiece that helped vastly break up the monotony that was vaporwave at the time. My friends and I still throw it on and let it and all of its ubiquitous glory hit us, very similar to when we first heard it. It seriously pushed the genre in a really important way."
Vaporwave,3cmddi,Lindsheaven,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:01:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks man. I plan to go back to it soon, but in a better produced way. I also recommend .CASTING / VECTOR GRAPHICS for some slightly similar stuff."
Vaporwave,3cmddi,trancedotbiz,2,Thu Jul 9 17:07:38 2015 UTC,i'd actually be interested in vaporwave artists doing more Acknowledged and Credited remixes of other/newer artists music tbh.
Vaporwave,3cmddi,stevebates14,2,Thu Jul 9 01:33:46 2015 UTC,I discovered this today. Is this similar to what you are talking about? It's a fairly newer song that was sampled. https://retrotechsounds.bandcamp.com/track/alchemy-of-love

Vaporwave,3cl0hx,domotobin,3,Wed Jul 8 21:44:54 2015 UTC,"Interesting proposal, definitely something I'll be keeping my eye on. Could you possibly give a bit of info on the various people within the RTS team? At least a count of the people involved and what their roles are?"
Vaporwave,3cl0hx,Cacola,3,Wed Jul 8 21:33:51 2015 UTC,"Sure! Currently we've got two people onboard as main contributors, myself who runs most of the aspects of the endeavor (marketing, maintaining Bandcamp and the website and design), and a good friend of mine who will help me scout artists and curate the artist roster.  There are also others if you count those who contribute content to our website including articles and such, but as far as the label goes, just the two of us (building castles in the sky...)  I hope that answers your questions! Let me know if you have others!"
Vaporwave,3cl0hx,Strugglesquad420,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:44:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! I do have another question about artist payment and how it interacts with Bandcamp's revenue share system. If a sale goes to Bandcamp for revenue share purposes, do you compensate the artist for that sale, or does it only go to Bandcamp?"
Vaporwave,3cl0hx,pmiller17,3,Wed Jul 8 22:06:46 2015 UTC,"As we choose to sign artists to our label, we will deal with this on a case by case basis as to whether or not the artist wants that percentage or not.  Assuming an artist is serious about payment (and not all are, which is why we will allow them to make those decisions themselves) we will compensate them for that if they want.   If you read our payment policy again, we will take 25% for every $20 in sale for that artist per calendar month. So if they want the revenue share compensated, we will cut our percentage of earnings down to 10% (Until we reach $5000 in sales, in which case rev. share drops to 10% and we will take 15%)  Regarding what happens if an artist doesn't meet the $20 mark in any month, they will receive 100% of the profits after the revenue share. However, at the time being we cannot compensate artists who meet this criteria until our profit allows us to do so, because we aren't making any money from these sales.  It is for these reasons that we have decided to offer extra perks to RTS artists including free merch design and hosting, as well as our hardest efforts to promote our artists through avenues other than our own.  All of the above criteria will apply to merchandise sales if artists wish to host through our shop.  Hopefully, aspiring artists can understand at this time, and we will do all we can to accommodate them."

DIY ethic stuff is easy to search and learn about. you can make your own tapes and cd's and sell them and try your best. but for a genre like vaporwave to be taken seriously you guys need to fix this dumb-shit and have low expectations. and depend dearly on a community. and at least be thankful you keep getting followers because soundcloud now is a followers contest.   in 2013-(14 exactly) HKE sent me a message for a spot for release on DC's infancy days and i'm forever thankful. he mentioned a percentage and i said no thank you. i just love the style of the label and would be honored to give something. and i'm proud to see the labels growth.  the genre and community keeps growing. it's not easy to manage i'm sure. and sometimes you can't come off as an asshole when you reject newcomers.   fix this shit between you guys."

Shima33 you aren't helping the movement by being so aggressive about something that in essence is an opinion.  also, stop crying about your money.  if you cared enough about ""art"" you would understand that money is secondary to expression.  i believe artists should get paid, but they shouldn't demand it or expect it or feel entitled to it.  the best part of art is knowing that your creation is appreciated by someone.  it's not all monetary.  likewise, vaporwave is relatively new in regards to the history of auditory art.  these crazy expectations of yours need to be curbed for a bit.  good luck with your endeavors, please don't kick the dog, and rest easy knowing people enjoy your art.  that's the most important part."
Vaporwave,3cjfus,EmbiggensCromulent,2,Wed Jul 8 16:01:25 2015 UTC,"That's actually nothing, you should agree on... Imagine, you're tutoring after school and people tell you ""sorry, no payment for you, after all it was social, and that's what it's about!"" If a label tells you, you will get paid for it, they have to pay it... And about the art thing... You know, artist are no transcendent beings, either... They also have to pay their bills, have to buy equipment and software to make the music... And when you don't get any money out of it, how should you every pay your stuff...  It is a pretty common mistake that people make. Of course, art is about the message and expression, but being an artist is, after all, also a job! They put work in it, they have to pay their flats, their food, everything... When you buy a picture, you pay a few hundred bucks for it... not because the material is worth a few hundred bucks, but rather, because they have to pay their whole living expenses from it!  So, it's kinda nonsense to say ""it's okay to rob the people's money, since it's art, after all!"""

I would be irked too, especially right after finding out about it's unannounced implosion. It's NOT just the money, in fact most of the complaints are about the ethics involved surrounding the way this music was treated. Artists are entitled to how they want their music distributed and shared by OTHER people beyond remixing and free sharing, even if it's out of their control to some degree. Otherwise it's shameless leeching.   Keep in mind this stuff happens all the time with indie and underground labels but is usually not talked about in public. Just ask anyone signed to a major indie label or any label that is tied with distro beyond bandcamp.  I don't even know too many people who are but the few I do all have at least one story about similar bullshit about money or rights being abused, ignored or manipulated on the end of a label. It might very well be the first such case for vaporwave.  And yes, there are multiple sides to this story and it's too early to tell. And we should try to learn from them, not just be ok with the ironic fact that a label with 175 releases just imploded is pretty vaporwave-y. It's still not cool."

What was the point in me getting you all of that traction, and getting you a foot in the door in the first place?  Since DMT is folding, here's a fun fact - when the fuck am I getting payed? When the fuck is ANYONE getting payed? NO is the most downloaded album on DMT by a fucking country mile, and yet I never recieved a damn penny. Same for Turn Off Existance, and I sure as hell know that if I ain't getting payed, nobody else is.  Also, who the fuck is gonna fill the gap? What else is there for newcomers in the Vaporwave scene, hmm?  Overall, I'm pissed off and disapointed. You had a great thing with DMT, and folding it before it's time is a letdown to everybody hoping to make it in the vaporwave scene. I'm sorry, but after people have put months of hard effort and work into a release for your label, closing up shop is the most selfish, not-giving-a-damn thing you can do.  You don't even have the excuse of ""Running a label is hard"", either! OSCOB and, hell, the owner of Dream Catalogue HIMSELF both offered to help you out, and to teach you the ropes on how to run a label succesfully. What did you do? You BLANKED OSCOB's ADVICE. You IGNORED Dream Catalogue's help, and even when JOHN ZOBELE came down off his high fucking throne, you still acted like you could manage it yourself.  In conclusion, you had every chance given to you, and you still managed to fuck it. Hopefully somewhere inbetween you realizing that 35 of the 175 releases were yours, and the fact that for 4 months your label's aesthetic was made in MS PAINT, SOMEWHERE inbetween there you'll learn how to run a fucking label decently."

The project is complete. Like actually complete. Look at it. It's music that wasn't there 8 months ago. All of it. And it's not going anywhere, we're just ending the phase of new releases. I don't want to keep adding and adding and adding to it. I want to maintain what's there and just take it easy.  earnest question: if you had gotten onto Fortune 500 in 2013, and then they closed their doors (which they did), would you still be tantruming? because as I last recall, that roster gets steady attention to this day. and it isn't even maintained with downloads anymore.

Go into IT or something equally expresionless. I'm nothing if not an artist - I'm not an artist without expression."
Vaporwave,3cjfus,heresiologist,4,Wed Jul 8 14:37:09 2015 UTC,"Just because you say ""music is all about expression"" doesn't make it so. Saying ""art is all about expression"" doesn't make it so. In fact, it doesn't hold up to the least bit of scrutiny. If you want to make bold statements about art, you really should spend some time studying aesthetics. Because not only are you factually incorrect, but you're possibly doing a disservice to your ""art"" in persisting in your factual incorrectness.   EDIT: I'll take the downvotes as a cry for clarity. If music were actually about ""expression"", we'd need to know what's being expressed. Emotions? Feelings? Facts? These words have no actual meaning in the context of musical ""expression"" because what the composer wanted to express does not in any way necessarily correlate with what is being ""felt"" by the listener. The highest art, if you'll reflect upon it, challenges the viewer/listener in some way and does not provide an ""answer"". The idea that music is simply an ""expression"" cuts out entirely the importance that art places on the viewer. So, yes, bad music destroys the dialogue by ""expressing"" something, but to then say that you're an artist precisely because you try to destroy what makes art powerful is a tremendously bad idea."
Vaporwave,3cjfus,dreamcatalogue,3,Wed Jul 8 15:23:22 2015 UTC,"I don't want to get involved in all the arguing anove, but to counter your point I would actually argue all music and art is a form of expression myself, even if that expression is unintentional and subconsciously applied, it's still technically an expression of something from within the artist or artists' mind and soul. If even just stemming from a really basic human desire to create in some capacity, i.e. experimentation, it's still an expression that is reflective of that desire in some way, expressed through the artist's capacity to create that art.  Sorry if this is all just a pointless point to make, I haven't slept  EDIT: By the way I didn't downvote you, I only downvote memes and shitty posts usually, just thought your comment provoked an interesting discussion"
Vaporwave,3cjfus,palmettooo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:40:14 2015 UTC,"i agree entirely. i don't have any predetermined notion in mind when i sit down to create a track, but i find that after it forms, it takes on some meaning that i didn't even mean to put into it. sometimes just fulfilling the innate human desire to create is enough. is that not just as valid as making something to communicate your innermost emotions, thoughts, etc.?   i dunno, i just never expected the vaporwave community, of all places, to get dogmatic about art. 90% of this stuff is just snipped from shit we didn't even create ourselves. honestly, making music that is completely NOT about expressing yourself is a beautiful artistic endeavor too, IMO."
Vaporwave,3cjfus,heresiologist,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:24:07 2015 UTC,"I totally agree that art is an expression, but to limit it to saying that it's ""all about expression"" is just factually wrong. Art should be about the dialogue between artist and viewer/listener and the unfolding of understanding of the human condition which arises out of that dialogue. When it becomes ""all about expression"" it loses all of its potency, because then we have an artist who is supplying answers when they should be supplying questions."

Vaporwave,3cjfus,trancedotbiz,12,Wed Jul 8 15:36:33 2015 UTC,"what makes experimentation and expression mutually exclusive. why are u the arbiter of who is ""expressive"" or not. r u missing the point of vaporwave by trying to judge a release by how much perceived work went into it?"
Vaporwave,3cjfus,Shima33,-8,Wed Jul 8 14:40:30 2015 UTC,"I never claimed to be the arbiter of that, but it's pretty obvious to tell when and when not a project has effort put into it, or whether or not it's done for the sake of it. I can safely say that 80% of what's on DMT Tapes has effort behind it, and to refer to the whole thing as an experiment is rather rude to the people who invested time in their music."
Vaporwave,3cjfus,trancedotbiz,8,Wed Jul 8 14:43:02 2015 UTC,what's wrong w music for the sake of it though. just bc even if it's a dumb idea it's a neat/unexplored one and experimentation in music is harmless and actually important. eccojams is full of dumb ideas that just click.
Vaporwave,3cjfus,Shima33,-8,Wed Jul 8 14:45:06 2015 UTC,"There's nothing -wrong- with it, it's just not as good with music plus effort. Experimentation in music is fine, so long as effort and passion follows with it. Even eccojams has effort put into it."

New people enter this genre daily. They now have this list, amongst all the others like Dream Catalogue and Business Casual, to go to. FOR FREE. for YOUR music. I succeeded at doing exactly that. just because we're stopping new additions to a roster that was getting too big in the first place, that means nothing about your growth as an artist and your releases henceforth."

I started this project poor, I did it all poor, I'm ending it poor. it was never about money. money I collected was put back into the project. Most of our artists made $3, $4, $5 tops. I wasn't going to pass out chump change and treat the vaporwave community to Arizona Tea. I put it back into Bandcamp download credits so that we can keep this shit free. We've had 9,000 downloads in 8 months. That's $140, most of it my own money, as we didn't start collecting until the end of May.  so in all honesty, I've done my job. I've done it well, hard, and I'm so proud of myself and all of you. This has been really really fun and I'm not even leaving this thing on any sullen note.

Vaporwave,3cjfus,oscob,0,Wed Jul 8 18:59:14 2015 UTC,Yeah I once told him he is gonna ruin his own label after he blanked out the ideas I brought to the label (at HKE's insistance) I later felt bad about it and apologized.  Looks like I wasn't wrong tho

I'm very close with Vito. What you are doing is wrong, shameful, and I condone your actions vehemently. It's disgraceful what you've done to someone over something like this. Perhaps if you didn't publicly humiliate and shame him over something so minor and inconsequential he would be more obliged to do you a service, OSCOB. No respect for you from me and several others here today."
Vaporwave,3cjfus,haeshdem0n,-2,Wed Jul 8 18:45:30 2015 UTC,"I could care less about how much respect you have for me.

If you want full conext of the situation and the pictures I just posted you can read them here. https://www.reddit.com/r/Vaporwave/comments/3ckceu/some_things_you_need_to_know_about_dmt_tapes/cswgz7t  Bottom line, the man caused the downfall of his own label. I did not ""shut down DMT Tapes."" I pointed out that he was treating his artists like shit and he made his own decision to shut the label down.  And as a side note, out of the dozen or so people that have thanked me today for shedding light on this situation, you are the first to actually attack me for it.  I have no ill feeling or intent towards you Iacon."
Vaporwave,3cjfus,dicktarded,-1,Wed Jul 8 18:51:28 2015 UTC,"You have never been supportive of him. Why constantly criticize him, behind his back and to his face, if you cared? There's a right and wrong way to do things. You and several others chose the wrong way.   I already know full context of the situation.  Your pride is trying to tear his label apart, along with several others. That is not a smear, it is a fact. Several of you are making this a bigger issue than it truly is and it's 1. embarrassing for you all and 2. a tragedy for poor Vito.   I do have ill feeling towards you, OSCOB. Vito is my best bro. He does this for a hobby. It's not a job, it's not for cash. He does it to help others, and he is also a collector.   Why should he have to pull something submitted to him when the person submitting has caused a TON of issues for him?? Why would he do you the favor? If you didn't start any of this (or criticize him relentlessly over and over) then why WOULD he have a problem taking the album down?  If I wanted DEIXUS (my new album) down he would be very sad but would comply with my request.   He is not doing that with you. That should tell you something.   I encourage you, whether you hate me now or not, to be an adult and consider what I just told you. He HAS removed artists before on request. The fact he hasn't for you should say something about how you've treated him.   I'm sorry, but that reflects on you, man. And you basically helped destroy my friends hobby. I can't respect someone who willingly seeks out to harm the reputation of others.   Will you care about this? No. But it needs to be said."
Vaporwave,3cjfus,Strugglesquad420,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:57:17 2015 UTC,"Again, I'd like some sort of proof of my ""constant criticizing"" of him? I mean other than what he has told you?   Go back through my twitter, I have almost ALWAYS retweeted the new albums being released through DMT. Or even vaporwavebot who I filled up with albums myself, which tweets probably around a dozen DMT albums a day.  I have no idea why you think I had it out so bad for this kid. I feel sorry for him. But bottom line here is that he was not capable in anyway to be running a label.   And for the record, if Vito was so passionate about his ""hobby"" then me pointing out some shitty things he said today should not have been enough to destroy the entire dream for him. For fucks sake, I have been called a ""fat ginger faggot"" on a weekly basis since 2013 for being so passionate about vaporwave and that has never stopped me from pursuing it.  No one is to blame for the ceasing of DMT Tapes other than Vito himself"
Vaporwave,3cjfus,jetlife_throwaway,-2,Wed Jul 8 19:04:14 2015 UTC,Would you like me to request all the emails and dms from you and vito since all this began?

Vaporwave,3cjfus,Strugglesquad420,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:08:23 2015 UTC,"Feel free, I mean I'm not interested in continuing this conversation with you. I can understand that you are obviously upset because your friend it upset and you are looking for someone to blame. Prolong this if you want, but I don't really care about this back and forth anymore.  I don't hate Vito, I don't hate DMT, and I am not excited or happy to see them fall. DMT was a great platform for the new and unknown producers in the scene to have a voice and a platform for their music.  I know Vito has probably told you alot, but has he told you I have still been sending and recommending artist's submit their albums to him?   For fucks sake, You can ask him to check his email, I told REZ (MY BEST FRIEND) to submit his unreleased short EP to DMT, which he did today before he knew this massive clusterfuck when down."

Nothing that hasn't happened a billion times before in every other genre, probably including classical music - before recorded music was even a thing. Even in a so-called anti-capitalist situation, somebody is going to get upset about something and it's usually about money and rights to the music, unless you are experienced enough to work out what is going to happen in a certain situation beforehand. The inexperience and / or deviousness of both sides may come into play in these situations. Here's hoping Vito learns something from this as well as his artists."

Vaporwave,3ckceu,heresiologist,7,Wed Jul 8 19:00:03 2015 UTC,"Vaporwave is not about making money. I submitted my record to him, without contract, and don't care about the money.

I've maybe made $80-100 since January for my own released bandcamp page. Whoop-de-doo. I make close to $125 a day full time as a wordpress dev and $175 an hour if I freelance with an agency on my own. I mean seriously this is really sad and it's tearing all of us apart.

Vaporwave labels should exist simply for exposure and support.  If they pay you, more power to you. If not, you shouldn't get worked up about it. Exposure is just as good.   Also vaporwave as a genre is genuinely using samples. By the logic of this post, shouldn't the original artist get a share too?   Being angry about not getting paid is ridiculous."

Vaporwave,3ckceu,Newtype420,4,Wed Jul 8 18:19:19 2015 UTC,"Ok to be fair, the DMT twitter is now locked as a private account, but I will give the full the context of each one. I am not trying to slander and I have no reason to lie. So it's all on you if you want to belive me or not. My goal here is to have everyone stop freaking about about the money and focus on why this label failed, it's owner  Picture 1: The was actually meant to be the 3rd picture in this series. This was after I saw his other horrible statements about treating his artists like ""a person I do not care about"" and that running the label was his ""hobby and not a profession."" After seeing the true colors of the man behind the label, I did not want my album associated with DMT anymore. He had stopped following me on twitter so I had no way to DM him (to be fair, I totally forgot at this point that I still had him on skype, so in retrospect I could have asked there first)  Picture 2 and 4: This is what started this whole debacle. My friend modernsqueeze (aka GALAXIAN aka Bonus Fruit) made an innocuous tweet wondering why his album (that was set to release on DMT today) was not getting the kind of promotion that all the other albums on DMT had gotten (aka a multitude of updates on r/vaporwave, and even if you look on the sub you can see the post he had to make HIMSELF to tell people about the album that was supposed to release today). Well after Vito saw this, he was promptly dropped from the label and denied his release. I took issue with this and said his behavior was unprofessional, which he tweeted back to me ""This is my hobby, not my profession"" (not pictured, but you can see him saying the same thing to modernsqueeze in pic 4)  Picture 3: Full disclosure? That message I erased is from a fucking month ago and is totally irrelevant to the situation at hand. If you look it is dated as ""07/06/2015"". It was just me mentioning that me and Boocanan (another DMT artist) had put out a single. If you are still not convinced I'll post the un erased picture."

I just had my first EP released on DMT today and i never expected to see any monetary rewards from this, just a little extra exposure for a fun hobby of mine.

Vaporwave,3clnka,Shima33,2,Wed Jul 8 21:39:28 2015 UTC,"Jesus, this whole situation just makes me sad.  While I do think your rant was uncalled for, the way everyone's responding is also pretty uncalled for. Explain to me how it makes to respond to Shima mercilessly trashing DMT, by mercilessly trashing Shima? That seems pretty freaking hypocritical to me.  And seeing all these people making huge judgments about you as a person is absurd. You can't just see someone at their worst and act like you know their whole fucking life story and are ready to make harsh sweeping judgments about them.  Overall, for someone just trying to get into the community and make a name for myself, this whole situation was fucking rotten, and seems everyone involved is at fault. I hope this whole thing clears up soon."
Vaporwave,3clnka,Cacola,4,Thu Jul 9 00:20:51 2015 UTC,"The fact that you made that stupid ""remix"" of that money statement this proves you aren't. Granted, Vito shouldn't said what he said about you so publicly, but you responded like a child, and in doing so, you're ruining your reputation within this sub. Now everytime your name pops up, people are going to look at you like you are this child who didn't get to go to the toy store and then threw a tantrum. The best course of action is just to stop responding, or if you so choose to, do it privately.   I mean, you and a few others pumped so much negativity into this sub today it is unreal, and what sucks is that Ryan had to come into the sub today and see all of that nonsense. Now I can't say whether or not he actually read anything that happened today, or even care, but that's a possibility, and it sucks that this is the image this sub is projecting onto outsiders."

I sat down and listened to NO today for the first time. Putting you as a person aside, its a pretty good album I must say.

I was implying that the vaporwave community has given you the most relevancy and exposure you will probably ever get with your music. Unless of course you were big in some other scene previous to having moderate success as a vaporwave producer and I doubt that.

Try Eco Virtual's Atmospheres series (or any of his works) if you want something sounding classically ""vapour."" His weather forecast-influenced graphical styles and ""aesthetics"" also matched the whole genre best (imo), putting the vapor in vaporwave.  At the same time, Eco Virtual is also the same person behind Blank Banshee, creating few of the catchiest vaporwave tracks out there."

Vaporwave,3cecmq,Swisst,5,Tue Jul 7 07:51:05 2015 UTC,"I actually stumbled upon Vaporwave this morning with /r/random.  My guess is that you won't find very much on spotify. After viewing a video on the history of vaporwave ( https://youtu.be/PdpP0mXOlWM )my understanding is that part of the appeal of the genre is that the artists choose to remain anonymous to build upon the ""lost in time"" aesthetic.  Another reason I think it would be difficult to find is the anti capitalism motif of the music. It seems to be a parody of the consumer culture that the sounds originally stem from. So in this regard it would be ironic or even hypocritical for it to be made with the intention of profit.  This is kind of off topic from your original question, but this got me thinking about the appeal of vaporwave. It seems the main inspiration of the genre is elevator/mall music or muzak. I wonder if the underlying ominous feeling I get from listening comes from it being a corporate prescription of musical xanax to calm it's consumers into spending more and the vaporwave style just helps bring some transparency to a feeling that was always there?   I know I'm rambling and I'm too tired to revise, but maybe some fun discussion will await me in the morning."

For those who see their work as anti-capitalist and/or as part of the long interplay of the avant garde and pop culture, those who are opposed to intellectual property laws either wholly or in specific circumstances, for people who believe that popular culture is (or becomes) part of the commons, etc... non-attribution (of both the samples as well as the artist herself, as we see in the aliases and sometimes multiple aliases of vaporwave creators) can be as much of a statement as the work itself."

Most people involved in the creation of sample based music end up either dead or in jail, and that's the side of the game nobody talks about. Then when you get signed to a label, a black SUV will show up at your place, and they'll take you on a private jet to Hong Kong, one of the only places in the world with both crazy aesthetics and very few copyright laws. This will be your new home, where you can spend the rest of your life slowing down Diana Ross songs in peace."

Vaporwave,3cd29j,infinite-leisureee,7,Tue Jul 7 02:27:24 2015 UTC,"Saint Pepsi and I go back, his music having been there for some of the biggest apexes of my life, but the biggest reason I love him is simply that I enjoy his choice of source material for samples more than anything. he has the same taste in soul that I do, therefore I hear a lot of music I would have already adored without the vape/future funk aesthetic. ""Magazine"", for instance.  Aside from this, I think he's one of the best around at reinventing a new song out of an old song. His disco sensibilities have driven themselves to a good deal of the future funk repertoire. I'd say we can even hear his influence in a few of his colleagues."
Vaporwave,3cd29j,Cinctulus,0,Tue Jul 7 01:44:17 2015 UTC,"I agree that he was huge for the development of future funk. IMO his sound is more at home there, than vaporwave proper."
Vaporwave,3cd29j,RotatorX,5,Tue Jul 7 01:48:12 2015 UTC,"Future funk is a proper subgenre of vaporwave I would say, though. Definitely a narrower criteria, but in the truest sense, I feel contributing to FF is just as potential to contributing to vaporwave. But also, let's not forget how big Saint Pepsi's discography is. He was the opening act, FORTUNE_01, for the Fortune 500 label. A lot of people know Gin and Vibes and Artzie singles (love Artzie), but his back catalogue was pretty in line with traditional vaporwave too.  edit: World Tour is my favorite of his vaporwave 2012/2013 digitals. https://saintpepsi.bandcamp.com/album/world-tour"

Everything that's been released so far under the ESPRIT 空想 name is extremely chill. Also, as SacrimoniusSausages pointed out, I can't ever get enough of DEEP FANTASY by S U R F I N G.

Vaporwave,3c8cpi,Cacola,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:42:07 2015 UTC,These are the best entries so far. Good luck everyone!
Vaporwave,3c8cpi,CRUMBLING_HOUSES,6,Mon Jul 6 06:44:24 2015 UTC,"hfm's I think is the one that best captures a dark atmosphere.  nano's trascends darkness, and it becomes kind of creepy (in a good way), I feel that the music totally fits the scenario he/she describes.  Cinctulan's is really nice but I think it falls short and that it lacks a finishing feel.  DMA's I think we can all agree is great all around, but I feel like it didn't capture the image as well as other entries, which was kind of the point of this battle. He/she absolutely killed that shit though.  JNRY's is one of my favourites, but it felt too short and I wish there was some climax to it.  I think I'm not voting for this one, I can't decide."
Vaporwave,3c8cpi,Steamtide,2,Mon Jul 6 03:23:38 2015 UTC,"Was a close tie between Chaoscontroluigi and THOUGHTS, but I went with THOUGHTS in the end, both great entries. Fortune 600's was really good too, and a number of others, definitely the best week of entries so far"

If I were to make any sort of critique to it, I'd say it could've been more. Expanded. Perhaps some different sounds and/or melodies added that fit the theme you already have. A 5-6 minutes track of this stuff would've been perfect. Keep on keepin' on."

AMIGA BREAKS - JOURNEY'S END  I ask because this new Amiga Breaks album has an amazing nineties sound to it. The breaks float along like fast-forwarded clouds in a Windows 95 introduction video and the laid-back rave piano and strings sell you on a brand new sound chip. The sound of this album should appeal to any fetishist of the golden age of graphic interfaces. Recommended tracks: Oldschool Daze and Scratch This. The whole thing's great, really."
Vaporwave,3c91i5,stu_balls,3,Sat Jul 11 09:19:02 2015 UTC,"I really like how open and welcoming this community is, and it's been a lot of fun doing the hyperbattles each week. I still don't really think of myself as much of a producer but I have my first EP coming out on DMT Tapes this week and I hope you guys enjoy it! It's called Corporate Retreat and this is a song off of it."

Vaporwave,3c91i5,stu_balls,2,Mon Jul 6 13:58:09 2015 UTC,I also prefer upbeat vapor but I still really enjoy the Dream Catalogue sound. I see it as different sides of an expanding genre.
Vaporwave,3c91i5,Cacola,2,Mon Jul 6 21:03:15 2015 UTC,"I've been curious, has anyone sampled some late 60s psychedelic rock for vaporwave? That'd be very interesting to hear."

Vaporwave,3c91i5,DanteMarsAjeto,3,Mon Jul 6 17:30:43 2015 UTC,Actually I did! I took a song by a Japanese shoegaze band called Honeydip and made a short track from it.   https://dmttapes.bandcamp.com/track/das-mariagespiel  works decently well i guess
Vaporwave,3c91i5,gzintu,2,Mon Jul 6 13:18:34 2015 UTC,"It actually worked surprisingly well. I loved it! I wish that song could have been longer, but it's really good."

Vaporwave,3c8mhj,newkleuz,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:42:51 2015 UTC,"I'm going to respond to specific sentences rather than the whole, here I go:   If you look at VEVO music videos, they make you miserable because they're designed to show you how much more awesome your life could be than it actually is.   I have never in my life seen a VEVO video and thought that my life was incomplete because the people in it were doing better. I just know that what is appealing to most people is that imagery and the fact that there's a face behind it, validated by it's material posessions, fame, bitches/studs, which if you are liable to feel you need to get accepted then you're going to be influenced by the video, of course, but in the end it depends on the type of person who is watching the video the effect it has on such individual. Plus, this is a VEVO video, but that doesn't mean it endorses in any way VEVO's politics.   If people enjoy music, they get used to enjoying life   I'm just going short on this one and say I disagree.   If people get used to enjoying things directly for what they are, the gears of Capitalism begin to seize up, the machine becomes brittle, and what were once minor contradictions barely noticeable outside rarefied intellectual circles become major threats to its continued operation.   If something is going to make capitalism look as stupid as it truly is I doubt it is what you describe, I honestly don't get how ""enjoying things for what they are"" would make people realize the absurdity of our system.   In large quantities, delivered in quick succession, we can see how absurd and stupid all of this advertising is, how hollow its promises are, how deceitful its supposedly aspirational message.   I think you're addressing your audience like talking down to us, honestly, how dense does someone have to be to not be able to see that the only thing advertising is trying to do is sell us something? We're just numbers.   Once we see through the cheap tricks capital employs, we can laugh at them instead of getting sucked in and drooling like dogs over the pretty pictures or chasing fantasy thought worlds like a cat chasing a piece of string.   If I relied on people to realize that we need to move beyond capitalism and I held my breath, I would have died decades ago. I think if something is going to teach us to let this bullshit go is the moment when the whole system collapses and we're left to start from zero. Capitalism relies on growth, and growth is supported by resources, in a world where the number of people keeps augmenting and the resources that are used to satisfy the basic needs of those people diminishes constantly, how much do we exactly have left? I can't wait for the moment when the biosphere turns into the cancer that humanity is and we start eating green paper. Mhmh, yummy!.   By the way, I'm not trying to predict the future or anything, I just honestly think that this is where we're going.  PS: English not be me 1 language, apologies the mistakes."
Vaporwave,3c8mhj,Steamtide,-2,Mon Jul 6 13:42:26 2015 UTC,lol thats a lot of text and I didnt read any of it
Vaporwave,3c8mhj,Strugglesquad420,4,Mon Jul 6 02:18:48 2015 UTC,"Corporate shit has infested ""indie"" music as well. Pitchfork.com is not just making music videos for artists, they're infusing them with fucking car commercials for companies like FORD. Just watch this video for Classixx as an example. I find this a lot more alarming than anything VEVO puts out because   They are a tastemaker entity and gatekeepers of much of what ""breaks out"" versus what stays underground They still do ""reviews"" They and other sites (like Spin and the other sites owned by Buzzmedia) act like they are an alternate platform to VEVO and major label PR, including occasional lite social-political puff pieces in their editorials, but are pushing the same PR lead, money driven content, with many sincere writers and artists caught in the middle with no alternative."
Vaporwave,3c8mhj,joshuatx,9,Mon Jul 6 00:07:39 2015 UTC,"what the heck   Vaporwave directly short circuits the engineering of mass culture.  Vaporwave stands in opposition to the mass-marketing of music.  Vaporwave provides excitement and sensuality directly through the music itself   here, you are making your own definition for vaporwave. while there is no problem with defining things on your own, it is not inclusive of many other things people call vaporwave. I've read a lot of your posts on this sub, and you say many albums considered to be vaporwave by a lot of people to not be vaporwave. for example, you mentioned 新しい日の誕生 as strictly ambient music, and not vaporwave. while Hong Kong Express' and Telepath's collaboration is not vaporwave in the way you defined it, you are using a definition of vaporwave that is very different than what most people think of the genre. the problem with that is that when you're talking about vaporwave, you're talking about something different than what I and many other people think of as vaporwave.   https://www.reddit.com/r/Vaporwave/comments/3akhwo/what_is_your_definition_of_vaporwave/  check this thread out, you'll see what I mean.  additionally, remember the intentions of the artists. yes, their intention does matter. sure, it may be fun to throw out the intended meaning (or lack of meaning) behind a work for some wacky, philosophical analysis, but generally no source is more credible about a work of art than the artist who created it. most vaporwave artists are more interested in making something that is aesthetically beautiful and pulling off a truly enjoyable mood rather than short circuiting the engineering of mass culture or whatever. it's not like not aligning with the desires of mass marketing is something independent to vaporwave anyway; it's true of basically any underground scene.  additionally, you are making quite a few assumptions about the so called music of capitalism and its listeners.   If you look at VEVO music videos, they make you miserable because they're designed to show you how much more awesome your life could be than it actually is.   after watching the Summer music video I did not feel miserable because it showed me how much more awesome my life could be than it actually is. does it actually make you feel that way? have you ever heard anyone actually say it makes them feel that way? maybe they do, but I doubt that is what is happening most of the time. the glorification of sex and wealth in the video really does not strike me as manipulative in the way you portrayed it. it may make people think that they need those things in their lives, but it's not like the desire for wealth and power only just suddenly popped up in the era of late capitalism. at worst, the hi-fi, rich people glow of the video is only silly, because it looks so unrealistically perfect.   People don't respond to, ""here is a product that solves a problem you might have :)"". They respond to, ""if you don't buy this, you're a loser (⌐■_■)"".   yeah, fuck capitalism. what a shame it is that people are buying Beats just because they're cool instead of usable headphones... it is a shame on the consumer, not the producer if you buy something you don't need because you don't want to look like a loser, I do not have any sympathy for you. it is not hard to ignore the alleged capitalist manipulation and cool factor we are subjected to  anyway I think you are chopping away from what is most people consider to be vaporwave with a strict definition that only barely makes the rest of your analysis make sense. people buying things just because it's cool is more of a shame on the mindless consumer than the seller, and even then that's a subject that has little to do with most vaporwave"

Vaporwave,3c8mhj,blumf7,2,Mon Jul 6 10:42:37 2015 UTC,"I never said that advertising is ineffective at selling a product. obviously it is very effective, still I doubt it is because it tries to make your life look lame in comparison to car commercials and insurance ads. okay well progressive ads do make me hate life but that's for a completely different reason  buying or not buying product is a personal choice. 166 billion dollars in a year does not negate the fact that you are free to not buy useless shit that you don't need"
Vaporwave,3c8mhj,flamewarist,0,Mon Jul 6 18:49:35 2015 UTC,"And yet, there's a huge industry based around doing just that.

Vaporwave,3c5bds,zdarlight,9,Sun Jul 5 02:28:44 2015 UTC,So people were searching for Future Funk as early as 2005? What does OG future funk sound like?
Vaporwave,3c5bds,haeshdem0n,2,Sat Jul 4 23:59:58 2015 UTC,"Two terms - Future Funk and Liquid Funk - have been around in Drum & Bass since the late 90s. Liquid Funk as a term and style stuck around and is now often shortened to just Liquid, or Liquid DnB. I think Future Funk was just another name for what became Neuro (Funk) later on, I was never quite sure, it could've been another name for Liquid."
Vaporwave,3c5bds,sikaflex252,4,Sun Jul 5 06:54:38 2015 UTC,Also kind of strange that the peak for Future Funk looks like it's before 2011 which is like a year before Future Funk as we know it became a thing.

They had T-shirts printed and everything. I'm willing to bet that essentially all of the search volume for the terms ""future funk"" prior to the rise beginning in late 2014 are due to people searching for information about this group.

Vaporwave,3c6ro9,dreamcatalogue,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:13:23 2015 UTC,"I have to be honest here, this is just my opinion of course, but I don't know if I like this direction, the track certainly has a dark aura to it and it is hard hitting, but I feel like the dream-like vibe usual of your music is gone and the use of percussion and bass is not as effective as in other tracks of yours, plus I think that 6 minutes was not really necessary. I'm not trying to be an asshole, just spilling some thoughts.  Also, congrats for getting some much deserved recognition on that TND interview, I hope you continue on making great music."
Vaporwave,3c6ro9,Steamtide,2,Mon Jul 6 02:49:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's a fair comment, I'm definitely trying out something new here so it's cool you caught onto that at least. Maybe it doesn't fit as vaporwave, but I've got some new overall concepts in mind that I'm going to be trying out in future, which I'm just toying with at the moment  What do you reckon was wrong the the percussion and bass so I can work on the mastering a bit? Too tight sounding?"
Vaporwave,3c6ro9,Steamtide,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:52:48 2015 UTC,"I'm having a hard time trying to explain exactly why I feel like I do, so I'm sorry if this sounds a little abstract, but it has nothing to do with the mastering, it's more related to the specific sounds of the drum and bass and the use of them, for example I hear the hihat a little too metallic sounding, the snare sounds too sharp and I feel that the sequencing of the percussion is a little robotic as well as the bass. I guess this is all just tied to the holistic sound of the track, and I'm pretty sure that what I'm describing as things that I'm not liking that much might have been your intentions, so in the end this is all just highly subjective.  Definitely keep on experimenting though, I'd like to hear what you've got."
Vaporwave,3c6ro9,Steamtide,2,Mon Jul 6 03:54:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get what you mean now, cheers for the feedback. For this track I was really aiming for a dark cyberpunk-ish type of theme, with an overall goal of presenting something like Tool.. also kind of an abstract comparison from me here too, as musically it isn't Tool at all, but thematically they are a band who's presentation and lyrics are an inspiration to me, so it's kind of my take on that theme if you get what I mean."

I was around when vaporwave made its debut and have been interested in it ever since, but somehow never actually listened to it that much. I'm now trying to catch up on everything I've missed, and with this release I was at first a bit skeptical that this was even vaporwave. It sounded more ambient than anything. But, I think I'm just still stuck in the ""vaporwave = slowed down 80s pop/muzak"" narrative, so this album has really opened my eyes to how much the genre has grown since ~2011. the production was amazing, I'll def. be giving it another listen"

The worst they can say is no.   May I ask what artist you're looking to use a song from? Perhaps I can direct you to a way to contact them.   Edit: I misread your post. I think you won't face any issues with the songs you sample. The only issue you may face is a video being taken down and a cease and desist from the artist or label, which basically means not to use their music as a sample without approval and in a video without approval again. You should be fine!"

There's probably no need to say something like ""a project surrounding the theme of drone, isolation, and data corruption"".  With context, less is often more to the listener/observer.  Try using context sparingly only for the immediate purpose of putting the observer in a specific state of mind."

It was only years later, thanks to the internet, that I was able to track down all of the information.  It's on mixcloud here  In the years since, I learned that a large chunk of the music on the album is the product of two people: http://www.discogs.com/artist/77844-Tarrentella-vs-Redanka  Here is a bunch of their music"

Vaporwave,3bua13,Drankacupoftea,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:11:45 2015 UTC,I mean actual silver pressed glass mastered discs not cdrs   What is the difference? I always thought they were all the same.
Vaporwave,3bua13,Steamtide,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:40:05 2015 UTC,"Cdrs you can buy at home and burn them yourself on your own computer. Glass mastered cds you have to have made at a cd manufacturing plant which is much more expensive. Cdrs are much cheaper than cds and usually have a short lifespan as they often degrade and stop working even when stored properly. An actual cd's lifespan should last a lifetime at least assuming its taken well care of. Cdrs also look much cheaper in person, even the ones with ink printing on top, they scratch far more easily than cds and overall are just a much cheaper looking and far more fragile product. I like to use cdrs to make playlists for my car, but I usually don't buy cdr releases from bands since I don't like buying something that usually looks cheap and often will degrade.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_disc#Recordable_CD"

Vaporwave,3bua13,autowikibot,3,Fri Jul 3 15:11:39 2015 UTC,"Cdrs do degrade often but normal glass mastered cds only do if they are manufactured incorrectly for the most part. I have over 6000 cds in my collection and out of those I have less than 10 that suffer from disc rot. If you have normal cds you shouldn't worry about them degrading from disc rot, but you should take good care of them anyway so they don't get scratched."
Vaporwave,3bua13,ABridge27,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:35:34 2015 UTC,"Section 24. Recordable CD of article  Compact disc:       Recordable Compact Discs, CD-Rs, are injection-molded with a ""blank"" data spiral. A photosensitive dye is then applied, after which the discs are metalized and lacquer-coated. The write laser of the CD recorder changes the color of the dye to allow the read laser of a standard CD player to see the data, just as it would with a standard stamped disc. The resulting discs can be read by most CD-ROM drives and played in most audio CD players. CD-Rs follow the Orange Book standard.  CD-R recordings are designed to be permanent. Over time, the dye's physical characteristics may change, however, causing read errors and data loss until the reading device cannot recover with error correction methods. The design life is from 20 to 100 years, depending on the quality of the discs, the quality of the writing drive, and storage conditions. However, testing has demonstrated such degradation of some discs in as little as 18 months under normal storage conditions.   This failure is known as disc rot, for which there are several, mostly environmental, reasons.   The recordable audio CD is designed to be used in a consumer audio CD recorder. These consumer audio CD recorders use SCMS (Serial Copy Management System), an early form of digital rights management (DRM), to conform to the AHRA (Audio Home Recording Act). The Recordable Audio CD is typically somewhat more expensive than CD-R due to lower production volume and a 3% AHRA royalty used to compensate the music industry for the making of a copy.

Even looking at the labels, there's a few, showcasing everybody who wants to release some music (or at least it looks that way), while other labels are kind of picky about what they release and do even have their specific kinds of vaporwave, they release!

That's what it's about to me, it's undefined, a bit of a mess. I like that there's no absolute agreement that Future Funk is or isn't Vaporwave, or that the differences in style are so far apart you can't tell they are the same genre except by the visual aspect and the name that tie them together. In fact, you can just mistake the different styles for the genres which inspire them. The anonymity is really attractive too."

Vaporwave,3br1bk,Lostism,2,Wed Jul 1 14:16:41 2015 UTC,"i'd say the main difference is that ambient seems less complex, more pure. there are less sampled sounds, less notes, tracks are longer and slower and less beats but vapor is really getting closer to ambient, for the better, ambient is awesome!"
Vaporwave,3br1bk,Lostism,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:55:52 2015 UTC,"It depends what ambient you are referring to, ambient is also often quite complex with plenty of notes etc."

Vaporwave,3br1bk,iambingalls,6,Wed Jul 1 22:14:28 2015 UTC,"I still don't believe, Vaporwave was ever really about criticism... They sampled unusual stuff and had some retro/nostalgic thing going on, but criticism? I'd say it was rather about recontextualization (looking at mallsoft for example)... Which is definitely not criticism! Like Marcel Duchamp's ""Fountain"" was not about criticising the audience of his art for being dumb, but more about shocking them by recontextualizing the already made products! ;)  But yea, a lot of stuff becomes very ambient-ish and the music is more about transporting a certain vibe, than reusing old samples!"
Vaporwave,3br1bk,iambingalls,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:50:32 2015 UTC,"It doesn't really matter what vaporwave began as or what the artists intended when making the albums. The music itself acts as a critique of capitalism, corporate culture, nostalgia, etc. In recontextualizing things through ready made art, Duchamp was providing commentary on contemporary society. Criticism doesn't mean calling an audience dumb, it simply serves to elaborate on the deeper thematic threads and meanings in art, and vaporwave is definitely worthy of discussion in that regard."

Vaporwave,3bkwt2,ABridge27,2,Tue Jun 30 15:19:52 2015 UTC,I'm giving these a listen. So far everything sounds amazing!  I really enjoy how your music runs the line between being very ambient and being very rhythmic. It's a fantastic combination.  I'm definitely downloading all three of these albums and putting them in my collection.
Vaporwave,3bk6y6,_ASE,2,Mon Jun 29 22:02:31 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty good start! However, there's plenty you can do to improve.   Here's a few suggestions:  Look for a sleeker and clearer sounding set of drum samples. Especially for the hi-hat which sounded really muddy and too low. Look for hi-hat samples that are crisp, and hi-pitched.   The kick is good, but I feel like you didn't get as much punch out of it because the track seems like it does not use a compressor. Play around with a compressor on the master track to get a nice kick punch.   The snare is alright but stands a little off from the other drums used in sound. I suspect this is because you didn't add any additional affects like revert and EQ. Adding these things the your drums will help them mesh together and sound cohesive, like a full set.  As for the background sample, it sounds really great!"

Step one: Get a song, for instance I used  リサフランク420 / 現代のコンピュー Step two: Download it from wherever, I used http://www.youtube-mp3.org/ Step three: Drag the song file into Audacity Step four: Set the project rate to 22050 Hz (it's at the bottom right) Step five: Export the finished product as a WAV file, and name it ""CUSTOM1"" (no quotes) Step six: Locate the RCT 1/2 install folder Step seven: There should be a folder called ""Data"". Drag your CUSTOM1 file into this folder. It should now appear in-game as ""Custom music 1""  You can do this with one other song and that's it but it's pretty simple.

Vaporwave,3blst8,mc-lunar,2,Tue Jun 30 07:50:03 2015 UTC,"I think I know what the OP is getting at, but he would have to include Replica in his 'true Vaporwave' list too. Eccojams and Replica both explore loops and the melodies and rhythms of loops. The Internet Club album he mentions is a combination of Eccojams and Replica (it's Replica done in an Eccojams way and with Anime instead of TV adverts).  Eccojams also can be seen to be trying to say something by the way Lopatin has chosen to loop certain lyrics. Eccojams is the root of the whole slowed down and chopped up samples side of things for Vaporwave (although originally the inspiration is from Screw), also the reverb, the glitching and the looping. Throw it out and you've thrown the baby out with the bathwater.  Eccojams as a style evolved though, it became less about one or two loops as people followed what Vektroid did instead and just stole whole songs - basically it became about chopped and screwed re-edits which are less creative and less about making music than Eccojams was. I think that's where true Vaporwave stops for the OP. For others it's where proto-Vaporwave turns into Vaporwave."
Vaporwave,3blst8,sikaflex252,10,Thu Jul 2 18:23:02 2015 UTC,"I think the point is being missed completely if you're giving vaporwave standards of what it's ""supposed"" to be like."

Or that Dre's ""The Chronic"" & Pac's ""All Eyez On Me"" are the only 2 real hip hop albums that exist.  I won't deny that Internet Club and similar pioneers are hugely the flagship of vaporwave, but the mindset of your post seems kinda limiting, no? I think what you mean to say is that those two releases you mentioned are what you consider the most vaporwave albums in the genre. Can't argue with that, but id probably add like 15 or so more to my list of the most vapory vapor releases...  Oh and 2814 may be ambient, but id classify it as vaporwave in its context, themes, imagery, sound fx selections, cyberpunk feel, and atmosphere. But really, cant it be both ambient and vaporwave?

Nostalgia is actually something I've only felt once or twice since I didn't do much but play outside as a kid and grew up in the country with no real connection to the culture at the time. I didn't really know how to use the internet until like 2004.   So I honestly just like it for the sound and the 'sthetics.
Vaporwave,3befbk,CokeHeadRob,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:20:06 2015 UTC,I am 27. It has been quite a trip how I found vaporwave. I got sick of mainstream pop/hip-hop music played on the radio for along time especially when having swag with a nice pair of kicks and ect. is counted as being cool.  I started with retrowave/synthwave about a year ago and the youtube channels had vaporwave songs in them too. That soon lead me to love vaporwave and future funk too.

I don't have a nostalgia for the '90s, per se, but I think my liking of vaporwave aesthetic comes from the influences of the '80s and '90s that were prevalent in my very earliest memories."
Vaporwave,3befbk,IndigoTheFennec,6,Sun Jun 28 21:42:52 2015 UTC,"I'm 27 next month. I'm with you on the age group, OP. Started Kindergarten a bit early for my age in 1993, graduated elementary 2000, so forth.   I played The Oregon Trail on a Macintosh in elementary school. My father had a Motorola mobile phone, once they started to get pretty compact, that had a gaudy green backlit single line display LCD screen. He was a real estate agent that wore a suit and had a briefcase every day. I would love visiting his office with tiled floors and bunch of necessary potted plants we now lust after in our graphics. My cousin had a pc long before I, but we would record made-up football games on Sound Recorder and add echo, and slow them down just for funsies. My first personal computer was in '97 with the Windows 95 operating system and I loved every single second of the sound and visuals that came out of that thing straight from the factory. I would slow down and echo every sound I could get ahold of. I remember visiting Geocities, Tripod, and AngelFire websites for anything that interested me; my first searches were for Dragonball Z artwork. I've used Napster, Audio Galaxy, WinMX, Kazaa, Aimster, Soulseek at their primes. I used a 56k internet connection up to 2002   There's a lot more, lol. Not that it really matters, but it's fun to look back on for me.  I think a large majority of the young-in's is simply because this is a very small and relatively underground thing. The values also are ringing truer than ever with the denouncement of capitalism and the ""vapor"" qualities of everyday life, how disposable we treat everything. Secondly, people are always looking for ways to separate themselves and base their uniqueness on how much they can appreciate something that is undervalued. I believe this is true because I, too, have been prone to do such as it's a human nature. Not to say that's a bad thing, but that desire is a real thing. Vaporwave and it's followers are the fashion punks of the digital age. Denouncing the virtual worlds evolution into hyper-realism and adoring the age where it began to do so at an acceptably recognizable point."

Not also that, but I hear fragment of my early childhood. I used to love watching the Weather Channel at night, when all it did was loop the weather over and over with maybe a few commercial breaks. I loved that smooth jazz, with calming pictures of suns and clouds and blue skies. I am always surprised to see such young people into it, since a lot of them were born after the mid 90s and by then, the pop culture landscape had changed.

Vaporwave,3befbk,kueis,2,Sun Jun 28 16:06:28 2015 UTC,I dont get the nostalgia part of it. For me it's about the future more so than the past. Mostly I just like the sound. edit: 19
Vaporwave,3befbk,Suicidal_2003,9,Mon Jun 29 05:32:09 2015 UTC,That's what I expected and why I am interested. I think it would be really interesting to hear Vaporwave as a person within that age group without having attachments to the sounds and aesthetics from my early life.
Vaporwave,3befbk,FOR_SClENCE,6,Sun Jun 28 16:46:18 2015 UTC,"I think it's more the fact that Vaporwave is a complete aesthetic, which is joked about a lot, but is actually a large part of it. It's the fact that the music evokes a certain image, and has certain cultural undertones. Then you add the art and all that to it, and you've got a more coherent genre than many people are used to that's very accessible."
Vaporwave,3befbk,rock100010000,9,Sun Jun 28 19:05:05 2015 UTC,"16 here, for me, I just really like the sound. I enjoy all kinds of experimental types of music or just finding strange genres. (some of my favorites include folk metal and IDM.) Vaporwave has a really unique sound that drew me to it."

Vaporwave,3befbk,jayhawkfilm,19,Sun Jun 28 20:44:20 2015 UTC,"While I do suspect that at age 22 I am younger than the average vaporwave listener, a great deal of it comes from my influences as a child. My older brother played a lot of mid-early nineties video games and those soundtracks stuck with me. I'd post a video if I wasn't on mobile, but the soundtrack to Lego Island in particular is probably the most ""proto-vapor"" shit that I'm aware of, and I played that game when I was 5."
Vaporwave,3befbk,theyremovingit,2,Sun Jun 28 14:50:21 2015 UTC,"That's cool man, I can see how having older siblings would immerse yourself within the same nostalgia that a lot of vaporwave is derived from. However, I'm not saying that nostalgia is all there is to vaporwave, it goes far beyond that. For myself, the initial interest was the nostalgia but what really captured me was that Vaporwave was exploring this fundamental 'feeling' that I have always experienced but I have only ever caught glimpses of it in other music."
Vaporwave,3befbk,likeTheArk,6,Sun Jun 28 14:14:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I totally getcha. For me, a huge part of vaporwave isn't the nostalgia so much as a weird familiarity with an era that I only sort of remember. I'm also a big nerd for some of vaporwave's more sort of dreamy, ironic visualizations of how the people of the 80s and 90s envisioned a capitalist utopia full of unbridled commercialism. I love the empty malls, escalators, neon lights aesthetic that so much of vaporwave - especially by people like the brilliant t e l e p a t h テレパシー能力者 - embodies. It's nerdy, yeah, but it's a pretty damn cool idea for the main thrust behind a genre of music."

Vaporwave,3bc5uq,haeshdem0n,3,Sun Jun 28 07:12:50 2015 UTC,"Interesting documentary, it holds true to what Ad agencies and graphic design studios do today. They have evolved into selling ideas whilst subliminally integrating the product. Often they would tie-in a value, thought or concept that would bring a certain emotion to the viewer. In this gimmick-based campaign, they have provided a platform for the viewer to engage in (hence the Tumblr/MTV gif barrage). It’s a way for them to say “hey we’re cool and hip too by making your means of expression into a marketing tool"". Personally having spent 4 years of college being taught to make campaigns this way, the idea is repulsively clever. Vaporwave is no exception to this case and to add insult to injury they’ve used a mangled misinterpretation of the genre."

And this is where the genre’s holy boundary is crossed. This is where the cynical impulse that animated vaporwave and its associated Tumblr-based aesthetics is co-opted and erased on both sides—where its source material originates, and where it lives.   That's powerful shit. I don't think vaporwave is over, but seeing the machine of capital in action like this is... it's like the rending of a veil. All these things I've known and discussed in the context of theory suddenly become concrete.  In this moment of bliss, the hyperreal becomes real. Just for a moment, before it is again compressed and compartmentalized, into perception and memory.  Vaporwave's not dead. It can run with sensations like this."

Vaporwave,3b9vzo,DavidGjam,24,Sat Jun 27 20:58:56 2015 UTC,"Why is people still obssesed with vaporwave being Anti-consumerist anymore? That was the style of vaporwave of 2011, but now it has evolved into dream travelling and cybernet experiences. Its true that the corporative style is still up, but that doesnt mean it is the staple of the genre."

People can call a style or genre dead all they want, but no matter what, there will always still be a following for it. There are ragtime festivals all over America every year and Gregorian Chant is still quite popular among people.   Vaporwave isn't going anywhere for a while."

Vaporwave,3b9vzo,angrypotato1,3,Sat Jun 27 06:35:48 2015 UTC,"I really like the interpretation that it's hyperconsumerist. That in accelerating the rate of consumption, individual commodities are devalued, and traditional avenues of market research are disrupted. MTV is really grasping if they're re-adopting an aesthetic they abandoned, because their market research leads them to believe it has value.    How much vaporwave do you see ""for sale""   This is the principle that ensures the downward spiral of consumerism. MTV is trying to sell whay we're giving away, further accelerating the rate at which they become irrelevant."

Vaporwave,3b9vzo,uncleyam,-1,Sat Jun 27 21:33:32 2015 UTC,"Sounds like an argument.   No, it's not, do you know the definition of the word argument?  Argument - Noun - In logic and philosophy, an argument is a series of statements typically used to persuade someone of something or to present reasons for accepting a conclusion.  I literally have not been arguing, I have only literally asked FOR an argument, statements used to support the point attempting to be made ( excellent business model and flawless execution ).   Nah, I'm not having it.   Neither am I, we're not arguing, I'm asking for an explanation of a statement.   If you were experienced in marketing   How is that in any way shape or form relevant?  You said ""Buzzfeed is fucking genius at what they do."".  Are you capable of explaining that or not?  All I asked was for you to provide reasons for that statement.  Pretend I know nothing about marketing at all.  Are you capable of explaining to me how your statement is true, or not?  If so, please just explain, that's all I'm looking for.  You're only being an ass in refusing to explain yourself because ""I don't know anything about marketing"".  So maybe I don't, how about you explain your statements then so I can learn instead of you just being a jackass and refusing to support your claim like any other mature adult would do.  I really hate having to chide people, but you are capable of explaining your point, and you're not just bullshitting and ignoring supporting it because you're actually incapable, right?  You're not just ignoring giving an explanation because you're incapable of doing so, right?  So please, support your claim that ""Buzzfeed is fucking genius at what they do."".  That is all I have asked for, one supporting statement which explains how they are genuis at what they do.  If you truly know, then you should be able to explain to me."

Vaporwave,3ba089,metalman777,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:16:39 2015 UTC,I've just read up about QRATES. I'd be interested to know what people make of the mastering and the pressing quality. Vinyl production isn't something I'd be 100% happy with putting in somebody else's hands.
Vaporwave,3ba089,sikaflex252,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:52:23 2015 UTC,"From QRATES:  ""Currently, QRATES has a partnership with ""WOLFPACK"" and ""GZ Media"" both based in Europe. For those people who have researched world's vinyl industry, it must be a well known fact that two companies are one of the most long-running and renowned brands in Europe.""  GZ Media is one of the top pressing companies out there today, so that's a relief. Impressed they were able to score a business partnership, really."
Vaporwave,3ba089,sikaflex252,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:24:14 2015 UTC,"GZ apparently do Direct Metal Master cuts if they cut the record themselves, which isn't all bad, and they can even do all-analog, but I've heard that the actual pressing isn't so great. In fact I've seen some photos of records pressed there that have very nasty looking defects, and these had been cleaned to get rid of a layer of dirt and grit that was present first apparently. I haven't dug up any info on Wolfpack as yet.  Now, if they can do a deal with Optimal or MPO, that would be cool! Both of those companies produce fairly good pressings still (check out Optimal's Mono Beatles pressings - they are excellent).  The problem is that there aren't enough pressing plants in the world any more, and as vinyl becomes more popular and the pressing plants are running 24/7, they cut corners to get the products out asap, which means some defects don't appear until the records have left the plan and quality control misses them. The quality of vinyl today is awful compared to what it was 10 years ago."
Vaporwave,3ba089,sikaflex252,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:51:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Sadly, the moral of this story is ""beggars can't be choosers"". Still, I've got a lot of GZ pressings in my collection and haven't had a bad experience with any of them, but I have also heard the complaints people have. I think it must be hit-or-miss (though mostly hit in my experience)."
Vaporwave,3ba089,Ciaoty,2,Sat Jun 27 16:03:26 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah I'm sure they manage to produce plenty of decent pressings and I hope that all goes well for this release. At least they aren't using a Jamaican plant - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIFDCdGopNg"

I had a long email conversation with Bandcamp for about two weeks regarding it, but they don't want to change the system at all it seems.  I do have a Bandcamp pro account, however the only thing I use it for is being able to queue uploads because my internet upload speed is terrible  As much as I love their service, Bandcamp in general needs a massive website re-design and more priveleges afforded to pro and labels account users. They could do a lot more to help promote music on their own site too."

Vaporwave,3b9q3g,domotobin,2,Sat Jun 27 16:23:05 2015 UTC,"It would be beneficial both to them and to the artists I think. The only way to currently explore music on there right now is via tags, of which the charts are usually completely messed up.  The front page doesn't really emphasise the music enough either, whereas it should act as more of a portal.  Whenever DC has had album releases listed on the front page in the past, there is barely any bump in traffic from that source.  If they re-developed the front page to be more of a ""hub"" kind of thing with much more focus on music and exploration of whats on there, it could act as people's number 1 port for new music."

Vaporwave,3b9q3g,xxzxcuzx__me,2,Sat Jun 27 22:24:03 2015 UTC,"50 a month? no way. I have a normal, free artist account that I pay download credits for. Usually in increments of $20 = 1000 free downloads. they have different increments though. i don't even have the 10 a month pro account. the things it offers don't really help me much. it definitely adds up quickly in months of popularity. I'd say it's been a couple hundred bucks within the past several months to keep it up."

Vaporwave,3b732h,matresslilac,10,Fri Jun 26 20:57:29 2015 UTC,Lets unpack this... what could be the flow on effects of this rebranding?   It takes the aesthetic mainstream?   It alienates a lot of potential viewers?  What does MTV do nowadays? I assume they are still a reality tv network.. might this signal more self awareness of the absurdity and surreality of the reality tv format?  Given that there doesn't seem to be much awareness of an agenda underlying vapourwave amongst the vapourwave community (the focus seems to be on irony and superficiality) it's hard to see how this could be harmful... if anything it kind of feels like it makes the critique more pointed.
Vaporwave,3b732h,ChildOfComplexity,4,Fri Jun 26 23:14:59 2015 UTC,"The thing about the art scheme they're using is that there's also a large part that style's community that isn't connected to Vaporwave at all. So while the visual style may go mainstream, the music will hardly break the surface."

You can use synth VSTs and drum machines to emulate that 80's/90's style like the LM-1, Yamaha DX7, Roland D-50, and the E-MU Drumulator. Mixing wise artists like Vektroid usually have compression, reverb, and delay on most tracks. Lo-fi sounds can be achieved by compressing your audio, you can do it digitally with some VSTs (or using lossy audio files like MP3 or AAC) or through analog if you want to put your music on tape."

Vaporwave,3b1r4x,Hkpat77,2,Thu Jun 25 14:11:38 2015 UTC,Great idea. Nowadays music only makes money with gigs.
Vaporwave,3b2wwf,CRUMBLING_HOUSES,2,Thu Jun 25 15:12:16 2015 UTC,"A label will get your music attention and a following, and releasing independently with that attention your music gets will get you more donations for your albums."
Vaporwave,3b2wwf,theyremovingit,5,Thu Jun 25 23:03:44 2015 UTC,"I reckon it's still worth getting onto a well established label if you can because a well established label is going to get your music more publicity by default. e.g. I download most DMT or Dream Catalog releases on sight. Self releases or smaller, I'm a bit more picky about. The extra promotion would shift way more than a self promoted release with no label behind it."
Vaporwave,3b2wwf,sikaflex252,3,Thu Jun 25 16:44:17 2015 UTC,"The approach I use with DMT Tapes FL allows all of our artists to self-release in tandem, their own mirrors and all of that. I try to make it so that there's genuinely very little that can get in the way if, say, the artist decides a label isn't for them. Really the only thing we retain is our own stream, the 4% of all downloads with NYOP contribution (to keep the label free), and of course, their placement on the roster. Labels are here for the artists and fans equally I feel, to let the music reach as many ears as possible. :D"

The full and complete version of the software is available for trial purposes from www.reaper.fm.  My only constructive input on the track would be to tweak the delay time to take out the flams. But then maybe the flamd were what you were looking for!

So you're the living proof one can make a name for themselves by releasing lots of crap anonymously and faking it until you make it. slow claps I'm happy there's lots of talented people revolving around your label now, and I know that you don't think much about your own music and you certainly did it out of love for vaporwave and music in general rather than for the ""fame"", but... gah, this is offputting and depressing in a way. Congratulations for the work ethic, I guess?... I don't know what to think anymore. For sure I won't consider stuff like a paulstretched S.S. Anne theme good music. Kudos for having the balls to release that though, I never release anything because it's never good enough for me... ._. maybe I'm not cut at all for this music thing and should just give up on it.

Vaporwave,3ay3tw,Strugglesquad420,2,Fri Jun 26 15:33:53 2015 UTC,"I understand it and I don't see anything wrong with it. Heck, that's a genius promotional strategy if you ask me! I'm just a little too much of an idealist and coming to know this was kind of a bummer. Like, with those first releases it looked like you were giving inexperienced producers a way to express themselves through your label when they would have been mocked elsewhere, it kinda gave what was objectively unremarkable music a nice dress and some credibility and helped perpetuate vaporwave as an art movement where the entry level was low but it wasn't necessarily a bad thing you know? Now knowing that early stuff was all your doing changes the perspective a little... as if that was all filler/padding to make DMT Tapes look relevant and busy so that it could gain traction until actual people would start contributing to your vision. And to a pure mind like mine it came off a little ""unclean""... but that's my problem, not yours. Your contributions and dedication to this community totally make up for all the spamming you did in the early days of DMT to get your name out there :P your success story is actually very inspiring for me... just not the one I would have liked to hear."

(even though i unfortunetly don't have so much time..)  i once read somewhere something out of an interview.. there was written a part which nailed into may head.. interviewer: ""how do you keep making good music?"", answer: ""i make 10 tracks, one is good, and then i discard all the rest 9 tracks."" - i think i go with that flow.

I've found people who greatly enjoy releases I've done where they enjoy it far, far beyond the sort of low-key, ""this was pretty good, this is release-worthy"" that I might put out in a night. Most releases were made to combat stress and kill time, and the resulting experiments that seemed the most... curatable, I guess? ended up making the cuts.   I've never identified as an artist, though. I prefer to be the accessory to the artist. and let whatever else I do that others enjoy be labeled as such from whoever might be beholding :) thanks for the words. your videos are boss"

Each work doesn't have to be a masterpiece, in fact i think some of the charm gets tarnished when a vapor track is too produced.  This includes whammin the compressors hard as hell on the mix...anyway, just my thoughts. I like that crusty, slightly off tempo, shitty elevator/commercial music."

There's a lot I love, a lot that intrigues me, and a lot I really don't understand.  Either way, I'm hoping I can get more into the genre as it really gives me such a weird feeling when I watch it, so any suggestions would be great!"
Vaporwave,3b05l2,theyremovingit,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:22:27 2015 UTC,I recommend you start with some basics.  Many would recommend Mac Plus or EccoJams here but I think it's better to start with Eco Virtual. Basic stuff but also very accessible.   Also listen to New World by Nouveau Life. Basic material but great listening.  Now explore. Here's a visual guide to some great vaporwave releases   I highly recommend 猫 シ Corp.'s HIRAETH.   There's so many different style of vaporwave so just explore and find things that you like!

Vaporwave,3aylj4,MasterGeekMX,2,Wed Jun 24 16:57:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as it stands this is literally just the song slowed down."
Vaporwave,3b0pc6,0548,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:02:16 2015 UTC,The slowed down versions of songs seem normal to me after listening to them so many times.
Vaporwave,3b0pc6,vx1,2,Fri Jun 26 22:09:32 2015 UTC,"How many of you make songs without using samples predominantly? I feel like vaporwave is focused on samples, but I really like some of the stuff that is sample-less or not mainly a slowed down sample."
Vaporwave,3b0pc6,theyremovingit,3,Thu Jun 25 16:37:57 2015 UTC,It takes a much tougher kind of creative effort. Often what works best is attempting to recreate or emulate a sample with synths and instruments.   I've also developed a way in my own music to treat a sample more like part of the instrumental ensemble rather than the feature. I use this technique well in my track Clouded Vision where the sample is treated with some effects like low-pass and some chorus to make it sound like a synth tone within the whole group of instruments rather than a loop that the rest of the ensemble revolves around.   I also do something similar in an upcoming track(on my next album) where I add effects to the sample to give it less of a musical quality but more of a sound texture quality instead. I added specific effects to the sample to make it sound more like a series of rumbling sounds(almost thunder-like) to act as an atmosphere in the background while my own original percussion additions take center stage.  Just some things to think about. Use samples as just another instrument in the ensemble with no greater importance than another instrument like your kick drum or your pad synth.

Vaporwave,3b0pc6,ReasonSausage,3,Fri Jun 26 03:06:02 2015 UTC,Both of my Lamitina albums on the DC were about 90% original music. I like the Boards of Canada approach to using your own sounds but making them sound like samples you found.
Vaporwave,3b0pc6,vx1,2,Thu Jun 25 21:50:25 2015 UTC,"Can't agree more with that, especially your Boards of Canada example.  Those guys were making vaporesque stuff waaaay before we all ever probably thought about making music."
Vaporwave,3b0pc6,Kidneybot,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:54:35 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this counts but I sample short computer sounds rather than segments or entire songs. I try to make synth melodies, effects, and beats more of a focus than the samples used, if that makes any sense."
Vaporwave,3b0pc6,vx1,2,Thu Jun 25 19:54:34 2015 UTC,"thats exactly what I'm talking about, using sounds as samples is a cool technique to incorporate musically. I'm looking for more artists that don't sample entire songs.  This isn't to say that I don't like  artists that make that stuff, I just want to see what other ideas people are coming up with!"

Vaporwave,3b0pc6,theyremovingit,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:43:49 2015 UTC,Listen! One of the most important parts of music production is listening to the work of others and listening closely to how they make their tracks sound good and unique.  What DAW are you using?
Vaporwave,3b0pc6,venvs,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:56:00 2015 UTC,As I've only started I've been using Audacity as that's all I have access to. It's not great but it's a start and allows me to experiment.
Vaporwave,3b0pc6,theyremovingit,3,Thu Jun 25 13:30:56 2015 UTC,"If you can, use Garageband if it's compatible with your computer. Familiarizing yourself with Garageband will help you immensely in the future.   If not Garageband, try to get your hands on something like FL Studio, or Ableton (Pirate if you must). Those will help you a lot in terms of production."

Vaporwave,3at8yq,Nerd_Destroyer,5,Tue Jun 23 09:24:59 2015 UTC,I originally got into it because I liked making the artwork. I had so many potential covers I mad a soundcloud and started making half-ass songs to match the covers. After a while I got more involved in mixing the tracks and it kinda got reversed. Now I feel I spend more time making things cohesive as a whole then anything else. I constantly pull songs and save them for later because they wont match the vibe of the project or the cover. but yeah i agree OP
Vaporwave,3at8yq,Newtype420,16,Tue Jun 23 17:18:14 2015 UTC,"i think this is a good thing though. unlike in most genres, EVERYTHING has to align to a cohesive idea in vaporwave or you totally lose your message. without lots of lyrics or a prescribed beat or style, you have to find a way to make the other elements speak for you. in the rock world, you can have a shit album title and one-word track titles like ""Anger"" or something, but not here.  not that i think everyone needs to follow the Japanese-characters-and-wide-text paradigm, but one of the reasons i like vaporwave so much is that it forces people to be cohesive and create their own universe for their music. plenty of non-vaporwave acts do this as well, but requiring this is pretty exclusive here i think.   another thing is now that everyone can have photoshop, modeling software, etc., there is no excuse to not have good album art. since most people will interact with your music in a non-physical way this is essential. you might think it's shallow to base your opinion on music off of visual things like art/titles, but those really are sometimes the only clues people have to understanding an album and can make or break it.."

I don't know, not too recreational or music-enhancing.  Marijuana and vaporwave are a pretty sweet couple, especially with their historical tandem-ness of legal weed in America / the 2010s, so it's not like vaporwave has anything inherent to do with pot, but they were brought up together. THC/CBD/HKE is pretty much a guaranteed good time.  DMT, obvs. But attained through natural means is a solution not many consider. Everybody's mammalian bodies can make the stuff.1    1 - Biosynthesis of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) in a melanoma cell line and its metabolization by peroxidases. - PubMed - NCBI"
Vaporwave,3auurn,vx1,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:32:15 2015 UTC,"See, I'd argue psychedelics don't really fit with the vaporwave aesthetic. Vaporwave isn't intense, it's not as trippy as what's currently referred to as psychedelic music, and it doesn't make me feel particularly ""connected."" I always thought the name DMT Tapes was extra weird because when one does good DMT, music is generally the last thing on one's mind. I mean, I tried to listen to music and I straight up could not. I was at some alien party in another dimension. It's a far more visual and body drug, not aural, compared to most psys. The only aural hallucination/distortions you really get are that buzzing then that weird tearing sound when you break through.  Weed of course goes with everything, but again, it doesn't quite fit with vaporwave like it does with say, reggae or jam bands. Your point about weed being made legal at the same time vaporwave came into being is kind of grasping at straws. Laws have never really stopped people from smoking pot and despite it being in the media more after legalization, there wasn't a dramatic increase in use.  DXM (and dissociatives in general) fit specifically with vaporwave because it's really easy to get the same kind of ""washed out"" and ""slowed down"" distortions that are so prevalent in this genre just by taking it. I mention DXM instead of K or MXE partially because of the nostalgia factor, ie most people who ended up getting in to drugs robotripped in high school. DXM also requires you to go to a store to acquire it, rather than some hiphop or hippie drug dealer. The music you hear while buying the drug DXM is generally going to be muzak and hits from the 80s/90s.  If you're feeling adventurous, I implore you to give a dissociative drug a try and then give vaporwave a listen. Honestly I would not recommend DXM for a first-timer as the trip can get pretty intense. Try to find some K or better yet, MXE. I'm telling you man, it's like peanut butter and jelly."
Vaporwave,3auurn,vx1,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:48:35 2015 UTC,"Watch and DMT-FL video or any cocainejesus video on LSD... then try to tell me its not psychadelic. When I found vaporwave shit my first thought was ""this is acid music""  Music doesn't have to be intense to be psychadelic. Ambient music and jazz is some of the best shit for LSD. You hear the notes and rhythm of whatever music you're listening to with extreme clarity.  Everyone is different though, man. I found the ""you'd hear 80's and 90's music while buying DXM"" thing to be pretty funny. You'd hear the pop top 40 or some jazz stuff at all my local CVS'."
Vaporwave,3auurn,vx1,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:48:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not arguing that psys make all music fun to listen too, I just don't think the headspace has similar aesthetics to vaporwave. Psychedelics are generally not very ethereal or detached. Yes there are exceptions to every rule, but look at every song on the front page of this board right now. None of them have overlaid geometric patterns, things morphing into other things, or other traditional psychedelic imagery.   LSD makes listening to country music more pleasant too, but you wouldn't say LSD ""goes with"" country, right? Alcohol is country's drug match. I'm saying the same is true for dissociatives and vaporwave. Look, most people who like drugs have never even heard the term dissociative, DXM has a negative stigma, and all other dissociatives are tricky to find. I'm telling you though, just try it if you haven't yet. I bet you'll see what I mean. If you have, can you describe your experience on dissociatives and listening to vaporwave?"
Vaporwave,3auurn,vx1,2,Wed Jun 24 15:01:44 2015 UTC,"I guess when I trip on LSD I'm in a different mindset or something. I've never done DXM but trust me, I'm not going to put it down or say you're wrong until I've tried it. You're description sounds pretty spot on that it would match with vaporwave.   I know of a really funny video on YouTube called ""this is how we trip"" I would link it if I could but I'm on mobile. It's whole video but they do DXM. I suggest you check it"

He's really not afraid to play whatever the hell he wants, and as a result he's been dropping lots of vaporwave into his recent sets on NTS Radio  He's a really great guy - he was instrumental in helping put together the Virtualife event with me in Manchester earlier this year, and now he has a monthly slot on NTS Radio, which is a really big and well respected radio station in London, which means vaporwave is going to be getting big airplay every month amongst all the other chilled out, jazzy, wacky and crazy stuff like Ruf Dug loves to play  Definitely show him support and try and follow his show (which you should just check out for the great music he plays, and top banter in between tracks anyway)  He's been a big force ""behind the scenes"" of vaporwave this year, so to speak, and has been pushing it all over the place to people without anyone really any of you guys knowing, so I feel its time he gets some respect!  He's also got an album coming out soon on vinyl which is really vapor-inspired, which I urge you guys to check out (I'll be posting it here when it drops anyway).

It was at this time that I finally took the time to start listening to dance music and I was briefly infatuated with that scene, including some more ""underground"" genres (UK garage, hardcore, ambient), but grew sick of it quickly and drifted back towards experimental, which is when I discovered breakcore. After a long and fruitless attempt to integrate into the breakcore scene, I gave up on that and returned to the (home) studio with One Month Free, where our style expanded to become and amalgam of lots of different indie-minded genres. Then, I started producing more bedroom pop on my own, and adopted a singer-songwriter kind of style and kept that up for about two years, and recently, after becoming more experimental with my music, I started wandering Bandcamp pages, looking for something new, and I stumbled upon a vaporwave label, having never heard of this genre before. The music was otherworldly to me, like, this stuff makes me feel a way I haven't since my early experimental days, and I did some research and found this community and it seems like the avid supporters of the music are as great as the music itself, so I think I'm gonna stay here for a while :)  tl;dr my former scene was mostly experimental bedroom pop"
Vaporwave,3aqezg,Vleetonk,2,Tue Jun 23 01:36:33 2015 UTC,Midwest emo. really hardcore throughout late 2012 to about mid-2014. kind of a funny switcheroo.
Vaporwave,3aqezg,memorium,2,Tue Jun 23 01:18:35 2015 UTC,"My tastes are fairly broad, but I'm more actively involved in the Punk/Hardcore and Math Rock/Post-Rock scenes, and I produce music that falls into either of those two groups (as well as occasional lo-fi Twee Pop), but I'm giving Vaporwave a try as it's always fun trying to do something different (actually editing stuff as we speak). I think I got into Vaporwave because to me it felt like an extension of the Chillwave genre and seemed to evoke the same atmosphere, but approached it in a different way."
Vaporwave,3aqezg,Kidneybot,2,Mon Jun 22 23:28:15 2015 UTC,"Between 2010 and 2013 I made house music on and off as Kidneybot on SoundCloud. I was pretty much just another forgettable Kaskade wannabe, but I was really fond of (still kinda am) of progressive house, deep house, and trance music. As much as I liked the music though, I grew somewhat bored of the scene and making that kind of music. I like how much room for experimentation there is in vaporwave."
Vaporwave,3aqezg,ValetGirls,3,Mon Jun 22 20:33:46 2015 UTC,"probably wayyyyy left of field from most of y'all. was background vox and producer for pretty unproductive synthpop group a few years back when I was in Seattle. After that side project fizzled out, began fiddlin with FL making mashups and curating/remastering old Britney demos (I've always been a HUGE Brit fan, even more so in this increasingly-basic post-2008 pop world), and that really taught me the ropes of how to DAW. My background's definitely poptimistic, and took a definitive turn towards indie/baroque/chamber pop and experimental electronica circa my move to Seattle. I'm not sure how I stumbled upon vaporwave, but when I realized how expansive the genre is and how amicable it is towards sweeping concept records, I couldn't resist. The rest is (pre)history :)"
Vaporwave,3aqezg,vx1,2,Mon Jun 22 20:10:52 2015 UTC,"I listened to trance and chill step type stuff when I first started producing, and my tracks were more trancey.   I then started listening to more trippy rock type stuff and chill wave like radio head and washed out and neon Indian.  Then I started a band and got into more synthy chill wave stuff like starfucker and toro y moi. Around that same time I found vaporwave and future funk and those old school hip hop vaporey beats and that's where I am now  So it's been pretty cool slowly adding up all these influences and seeing what I can make. There's nothing better than finishing up a tack that sounds like your sound but at the same time different than anything you've made before."
Vaporwave,3aqezg,sikaflex252,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:11:51 2015 UTC,"Production wise - Oldskool Hardcore, Jungle, DnB. Grew up listening to late 80s Hip Hop, House, Acid, Techno. Prior to that lots of 80s pop I guess."
Vaporwave,3aqezg,_animalcontrol,4,Mon Jun 22 18:23:30 2015 UTC,"cool question. i originally started producing breakcore/noise/industrial/experimental influenced stuff around 2008 back in the myspace era. i have a lot of weird old stuff sitting on an old hard drive that i would like to release one day- some of it is tangentially related to vaporwave, some of it is just really funny or stupid. i produced a little bit of hip-hop instrumentals (nothing too great) and made some joke rap songs. i was in a band for a year or two that fused house/dancy electronic genres with post-hardcore/screamy metal. my buddy screamed and i produced all the beats and would basically press play on my ipod and dance like an ass onstage and shoot foam bubbles at the crowd and sing. we only wrote 6 songs and played around 8 shows and then stopped. we were pretty terrible. then i discovered the W A V E invasion and started producing that witch house shit/ trap stuff and then became interested in the vaporwave and now here we are."
Vaporwave,3aqezg,CRUMBLING_HOUSES,2,Mon Jun 22 18:21:24 2015 UTC,"Black metal, dark ambient and drone."
Vaporwave,3aqezg,theyremovingit,2,Mon Jun 22 18:19:59 2015 UTC,"I came from filter house and nu-disco, two genres that have many similarities to Future Funk. In fact, I have several unreleased filter house tracks and a Nu-Disco EP that I have since removed from the internet(it kinda sucked). Filter house got me into the whole plunderphonics thing and helped me work up the basics of sampling music. Until I got better software, I couldn't really do much. I also felt like filter house was a fairly uncreative genre that limited exactly what I could do creatively in my music.   I gave up music production until I discovered Synthwave and I began producing music under that style. I also began to get into vaporwave. Eventually I released a synth wave EP with two vaporwave tracks on it. Soon enough, I realized that vaporwave was the perfect genre for me to work creatively with sampling in. So now here we are!"
Vaporwave,3aqezg,pega1,2,Mon Jun 22 18:05:49 2015 UTC,"yeah man, i originally started producing industrial stuff like how to destroy angels and then eventually transitioned to other experimental electronic projects. noise and glitch music are def some of my fav experimental genres for sure ♡"
Vaporwave,3appwb,angelhair0,2,Mon Jun 22 14:30:52 2015 UTC,kinda reminds me of the Lavender town theme from Pokemon red/blue
