LongDistance,3e4497,rungiraffe9,4,Tue Jul 21 20:24:50 2015 UTC,"First of all, welcome to the sub! It's a really great community here, and it has helped me so much, particularly during the first few months. My tips are: - Keep yourself busy, with school, with work, with friends, with a hobby, with whatever. You can't just let your life hinge on waiting for a text or call, despite the temptation to do so! When my SO left for the first time I treated myself to a pile of new books and tried to get through at least one a week. - Maintain contact (obvs) and try and schedule a video chat or phone-call at least once a week. Some people Skype every day, some people don't, do what suits you both. - Send each other gifts and handwritten letters, its incredibly romantic and it's so nice to have something to look forward to in the mail. - If there is a visit in the foreseeable future set a countdown app on your phone - watching the number of days til you see him again decrease is a nice feeling!   Finally, and I can't stress this enough - fuck the haters. Somebody will always have something to say about your decision to enter into an LDR, but remember, your relationship is between you and your SO and nobody else is qualified to comment. LDRs are hard, and there will be times when you'll be in pain, but you'll get through it, I promise. LDRs can be fulfilling and wonderful, just remember that it's not forever and for the best for both of you.  Best of luck xx"
LongDistance,3e4497,biggerthanthesound,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:44:17 2015 UTC,Wow thanks this is so thoughtful! I'll definitely keep all of these tips in mind. It's the perfect storm right now as I'm taking summer classes and half of the town is back home for the summer! But the book thing is an excellent idea. I'm a compulsive used book purchaser and haven't touched like half of them yet so this is a perfect time to get crackin!   thanks for the encouragement. I do find myself compulsively checking viber every ten seconds to see when he's last logged on so I think that's going to be the toughest habit to break.
LongDistance,3e4497,durand101,2,Tue Jul 21 21:07:43 2015 UTC,I had a problem with checking whatsapp constantly to see when my girlfriend was last on and that didn't feel good. Best thing to do is to get an app that doesn't let you see that. (I use Kakaotalk.)
LongDistance,3e4497,biggerthanthesound,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:17:24 2015 UTC,"No worries, happy to help.  Don't worry about the constant messaging-app-checking! I think most people do that without noticing, irrespective of distance. Prepare for your phone to become the third member of your relationship, just don't let the world pass you by as you stare at the little screen waiting for a message! Throw yourself headlong into your summer classes and enjoy yourself. You'll be together again before you know it :)"
LongDistance,3e3r21,foggiestofideas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:55:21 2015 UTC,"Try out a new hobby! Something like cross-stitching or crochet means you can also make something awesome with your time (bonus- you can also listen/watch whole seasons of shows on Netflix while doing them). Or, if you have the work space/tools/can buy tools, try some woodworking. And there's always cooking! Work on something new that you can surprise him with when he gets home with a delicious meal.  There's also.... video games. Access to a computer or console can open up a whole new world of fantastic adventures and beautiful stories to keep you entertained for hours on end even if you aren't normally a gaming type person."

Especially if it's something you could potentially do as a job, like building apps or graphic design; then you could try to get some freelance work and make extra money while you're visiting. But even if it's just a new hobby like learning a language or how to knit, you'll feel productive and get something useful out of it as well!"

I've had a couple of ideas, though, which revolve around feeding him when he returns home from work, mostly :P I'm a teacher by profession, so I've also been messing around with the idea of asking if he'd take me to buy a color printer on my first couple of days there, so I can work on resources and things.  Failing that, I think he's gonna try to palm me off to his mum, who's extremely sweet and will be more than happy to keep me company."
LongDistance,3e3r21,clover3k,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:39:54 2015 UTC,"What kind of suggestions are you looking for? If you're introverted and you aren't going to get out and meet people then we cant help because all we'd be doing is suggesting new (sedentary) hobbies that you've probably thought of.  I've been in America for about 3 weeks now and my boyfriend works 10 hours a day, sometimes weekends.  Things I do:   clean and organize  join meet up groups.  I went on meetup.con and joined a group for English language learners.  I take the bus to hang out with them.  It takes about an hour one way, but I've got plenty of time.  Sometimes we just sit around talking, sometimes there are activities like picking blueberries. read, color, Internet (although I limit myself to less than an hour of Internet unless I'm on the bus) visit museums (again, at least an hour by bus one way) cook and meal plan.  I walk to the grocery store and only get what I need for that meal so I'll have an excuse to get out of the house the next day write letters or talk with family and friends on the phone  spend time with his mom or aunts or cousins  (yes this can be awkward, but it won't get easier if I don't try) meet up with online friends who live in the state (again, 1 hr bus ride minimum) take the bus somewhere new and read there instead of at his place, or window shop exercise with small weights while watching tv   Most of the things I do are free."

LongDistance,3e3epd,Minonovo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:38:46 2015 UTC,"If you can boot camp windows on your computer your options will open up way more. My gf and I play league of legends, phantasy star online 2, and some other games depending on the mood. It also depends on how you two game. We are competitive people so mobas suit us both well. With more info on gaming habits I can give a better recommendation."
LongDistance,3e3epd,Minonovo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:43:02 2015 UTC,"I have considered this possiblity (boot camp) strongly. Unfortunately, my mac isn't exactly great on disc space, and with work files and such, I can't afford the necessary 30 Gb to try it.  I guess we are not that competitive. We've tried League of legends in the past and we felt it didn't suit as well.   We'd like something with a bit more investment. In the sense that we could see our characters develop as we grow more accustomed to the game. As opposed to match-making'ish games."
LongDistance,3e3epd,ladypallas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:55:45 2015 UTC,I'd recommend coop rpgs then. Phantasy star online 2 is one that we have fun with but I'm not sure if it has a mac client.
