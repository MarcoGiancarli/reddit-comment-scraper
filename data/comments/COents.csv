The way he described judging, it sounded like it was pretty much just like whatever shop networked the best won.  They were smoking strain after strain, by the 5th one no one had any real idea what the effects were of a strain they'd just smoked cuz they were already plenty high from five other strains.  And until these competitions come up with some method of judging that isn't such bullshit, I'd be highly skeptical of the supposed winners."

As long as the final product is presented as best it can be, meets certain criteria, and offers a highly enjoyable taste and experience, I won't say ""they're all winners,"" but many, many entries that the judges declined awards for whatever reason are in that same caliber of award-worthy product."

COents,3e5e2v,secretne,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:07:58 2015 UTC,"Unless you've acquired a job paying $35k or more a year reconsider your decision. Cheap rent is $600 if you don't wanna live in a rough part of town, rough parts are still $500 a month. Many people are moving here for the exact reasons you are with the exact plan. It's not a great idea. It takes deep pockets to live here. $1000 gets you a tiny one bedroom if your goal is to live alone.   FYI uber doesn't pay as good as they claim, and discount insurance companies like gieco will drop you for working for uber. There are companies that will cover you but it will cost extra, I should know I'm a courier with a commercial insurance endorsement.   The pot industry. A MMED badge (if you don't know what that is you're already over your head) requires you to be a resident of Colorado. And costs around $150. It takes a few weeks at most but likely you'll invest $150 into a badge/ID/Drivers Licence and spend a few months possibly looking for a job. It's not gonna be over night.

I know when I was that age about 20 years ago, and was meeting up with my dealer in an empty parking lot at midnight, I definitely wasn't getting asked if I wanted to try out an indica, sativa, or hybrid, and people sure weren't giving me a choice of 10 different strains to chose from.  There was no oil, there was no shatter, there was no earwax hash, there were no pre-made edibles...  I sure wish I had dispensary to go to then, instead of just getting stuck with a QP of pre-weighed shitty brick weed, because that's all that was available.  Colorado is nice and chill with weed laws, but the laws that we do have in place are there for a reason.  I can sympathize with homeboy, but with surrounding states like Kansas and Oklahoma trying to sue us, local politicians and certain municipalities attempting to repeal the law and our state being kind of a testing ground for the entire country, all it takes is a few people to mess things up and ruin it for everyone.  The majority of people here voted yes on Amendment 64, but that doesn't mean we're free and clear yet.

Let's say we all form a circle. The 18yo medical patient sits down with us, rolls a joint with his own medical marijuana, and passes the dutchie to the left... welp, round and round it goes until it's finally passed back to the 18yo medical patient... the adult sitting to his right just committed a level 4 felony: illegal transfer or dispensation of marijuana to a minor.

Prosecutorial discretion is certainly a thing but it's not kosher for the DA to just not charge ANYONE for a specific offense.

COents,3dprau,mesostoney,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:00:03 2015 UTC,"Not totally different than a DUI. Both crimes, both crimes for intoxicated driving. What I meant here was that the law exists, the cops arrest people for it and charge them, the DA doesn't get to just decide at the prosecutorial level that the crime shouldn't exist. The legislature passed the law, which in theory was designed with help from stakeholders in the community.   I'm sure that there are cases where they choose not to charge people, and many more where they give people the option of pleading out. IDK what happened in this case but now I'm really interested in talking to this woman's lawyer.  I know someone who was defending a weed DUI last month maybe I'll shoot him an email today and ask him wtf. I'm sure this was big news for him and many other people. I wish fox was giving us a little more detail.    I think they essentially charged her with a DUI vs. a DUI per se. The latter is way harder to overcome.   Statute is here if you want to take a look. There are some other materials online that will make the DUI/DUI per se distinction a little clearer.  http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/colorado/?app=00075&view=full&interface=1&docinfo=off&searchtype=get&search=C.R.S.+42-4-1301  As to the nullification thing, I'll keep looking for more info on whether the jury's verdict was clearly against the weight of the evidence. I'm 99.99% sure that what happened here is they legitimately had the option to acquit her because it wasn't a per se charge, not because they decided not to apply the law. I.e. it was not   if you find that the D operated a motor vehicle with greater than 5ng delta-9 thc you must return X verdict   And then they said, 'fuck you', and returned Y verdict."

COents,3dprau,Major_Turdcutter,5,Tue Jul 21 22:21:50 2015 UTC,I hope more people use this precedent and fight their DUI's in court.  It will drive prosecutors batshit crazy to waste taxpayer money in court only to be bitch slapped by a jury at trial.  If they keep losing these cases they won't want to even bring them to court.  Don't take the plea deal and fight the charges in court.  They will now have to get large jury pools just to find a prohibitionist jury to get a DUI conviction.  Prosecutors will have to question potential jurors for hours to find  people who hate marijuana and are willing to convict.  This one case has a HUGE impact on the criminal justice system.

COents,3dprau,green_euphoria,9,Sat Jul 18 15:17:15 2015 UTC,Sounds like her attorney argued successfully that the legal limit isn't really representative of any sort of actual impairment. So a jury decided that just because she was over the ridiculously low limit doesn't mean she was impaired or a danger to the roadway. Hopefully there's a precedent here.
COents,3dprau,mesostoney,4,Sat Jul 18 16:18:46 2015 UTC,That's tremendous news. It's fucking ridiculous that these limits are set by polititions who have absolutely no legitimate authority on the matter

COents,3dprau,FistulaeBro,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:40:24 2015 UTC,Basically came down to the jury not being idiots and understanding that cannabis does not impair you in the same way as alcohol.

COents,3dr5ne,Dextuel,3,Sat Jul 18 17:40:11 2015 UTC,"My friend got an enail and had the exact same problems. flipping the coil around didn't help because the other side is just as uneven. what we ended up doing was removing a spacer and screwing the bottom part on until the coil was tight against the nail.  This made it look like the pic where you're holding it up, which improved it marginally. still had pooling issues though.  The problem is the coil isn't made for that nail (or vise versa) so at best they only have a small contact point between each other. my friend solved the issue by buying a new nail, a quartz banger with a support for the coil handle. This: http://g01.s.alicdn.com/kf/HLB10tv1GVXXXXcJXXXXq6xXFXXXn/202579431/HLB10tv1GVXXXXcJXXXXq6xXFXXXn.jpg  or a single coil would prob do the trick (assuming you could tighten it fully):http://g03.s.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1jJ7XHVXXXXbnXFXXq6xXFXXXZ/coil-heater-for-enail-diy-Titanium-Nail.jpg"

COents,3dr5ne,CannabisExtractsCO,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:42:02 2015 UTC,All I have is a flat coil so my options are fairly limited but I just picked up a ceramic nail from domeless.com and I'm loving it.

COents,3dr5ne,scottCO9,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:17:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! I just took a dab after flipping my coil and the heat dispersion seemed a little bit better, but that may just be me really wanting the problem solved. I was also making an effort to hold my rig at a slight angle so the coil would make more contact with the dish, so that may have helped. The funny thing is I bought this nail because the website I purchased the e nail from sold the coil and PID controller with the nail sold separately; they said it was the nail to buy to use with their coil. I'm not sure what spacers you removed, could you elaborate?  I'm also going to invest in a Quartz banger e nail, since I loved my other one so much and I don't like titanium. I also just placed my pre-order for this sweet ceramic banger that's compatible with 16mm coils. It should be shipping out in the next few weeks. Ceramic is by far my favorite medium to use for dabbing. https://www.enhalenail.com/product/enhale-enail-ceramic-banger-female/"

COents,3dr5ne,izzytoots,2,Sun Jul 19 15:28:01 2015 UTC,"Flipping your coil would probably help. Honestly though, as long as you can find a temp that keeps your dabs at a good vaping range, I don't see why it matters. If the temp isn't  fluctuating, I wouldn't worry about it.  If you get a laser thermometer, you can change the enail set temp to what the dish is actually heated up to."
COents,3dr5ne,Matchstix,2,Sat Jul 18 18:17:35 2015 UTC,"I'm going to try flipping the coil- the only issue is that my carb cap sits on the rod on the coil and gets really hot in a short amount of time. An infrared thermometer is my first purchase after my next paycheck. I'm totally fine with using that to find the ""true"" temperature of the coil (if it isn't accurate according to my heating unit) and adjusting accordingly. It isn't a super expensive e nail, so I wouldn't be surprised if the heating unit wasn't 100% accurate on temps, but it absolutely does the job.  I'll sacrifice some accuracy to save a few hundred bucks."
COents,3dr5ne,izzytoots,2,Sat Jul 18 18:57:47 2015 UTC,"There is a temp sensor on the tip of the heating coil, and that's where your enail screen gets its reading. So what your screen is outputting is definitely not the temp your cup is at. However, you can set an offset on your PID controller that better represents the temperature of your cup."
COents,3dr5ne,TotesMessenger,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:07:48 2015 UTC,"Awesome info here, thank you so much. Where on the coil is the temp sensor located? I assumed that there was a way to ""tune"" the e nail since the directions that came with my e nail said to only use the up and down arrows and to never press the ""set"" or right arrows. My only issue is I don't know all the parameters they use in their closed loop feedback (I'm guessing temp, resistance, wattage?) or how to even go about doing it on my unit. Might give the company a call on Monday."
COents,3dr5ne,mesostoney,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:26:54 2015 UTC,"The temp sensor is located at the very end of the coil, where the slight dimple is.   Check out this article about how PIDs (the controller that enails use) work. Not the one I usually link, but I can't find my go-to."
COents,3dr5ne,mesostoney,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:09:58 2015 UTC,"Just changing the offset is really easy, you can just follow a couple steps and set it up. You don't need to worry about the other settings, they are just constants that input into the algorithm to make the nail heat up at different rates, how much it fluctuates, how much it overshoots and various other things."

I am very skeptical about the ability to verify need online, which I would then apply to getting painkillers/add drugs/anxiety drugs/etc, so not just MMJ.  That said, the reason I included the OTC comment is that, if we think the science agrees that weed can be safe to sell over the counter, than lets cut the shit with the dosage limits and separation of Rec/Med. Maybe save MMJ for exceptions to the age limit or something.  And honestly, I'd love the site for renewals, especially anyone with a persistent condition. Its new evals I'm skeptical of, and a fear that this will tarnish the medical value of MMJ, which is already in a grey area and often treated skeptically.   Hope that clears up my point of view, and I'd love to be reassured on some of my hesitations, so feel free to argue if you feel its warranted."
COents,3dk495,allthenamesaretaken4,9,Fri Jul 17 02:28:52 2015 UTC,"You make some salient points and I understand and share some of your concerns. However, it's worth considering that telemedicine is popping up in all kinds of places for lots of legitimate medical purposes. I have been prescribed medications based on an email to my doctor on numerous occasions, and lots of doctors offer video and phone consultations.  Think about homebound patients. They are, arguably, in the greatest need of medication and medical care and have the least ability to go to an in-person appointment. This service seems perfectly suited for the people I think we can all agree are in the greatest need of MMJ. If anything, that adds legitimacy.  With that said, I get your point and I agree that some people will look at this and see confirmation of their belief that cards are ""too easy"" to obtain or that MMJ is just a cover for recreational users."

Flavor on each of these strains is on point. I think the Alien Rock Candy has been better but it's still a fav. of mine.   I vacillate between not paying for flower and always having an ounce of shop flower around. I have probably a lb or two left of my own from my last harvest and oil that I make so it's nice to have 8 other strains here.  300 is steep but it's the same as top quality black market elsewhere and it lasts me a month or more.

If you take the average 4 year enlistment and start it at 18 you're discharged at age 22. Sooner if you're medically separated.

Though I'm not certain of this, I'm not a doctor or psychologist, and there isn't much evidence (because studies like this are hard to get approved), which the board of health use to determine if MMJ can be used to treat PTSD.

Some leases will say no smoking but don't specify, and if you're vaping that is a good loophole.   I would get something like the Pax for vaping bud, and a blackoutx or 710pen for concentrates. Get a smokebuddy to exhale into and you should have little to no smell.  Stay away from Edipure and Dr. J's edibles. There are also patches but I don't feel they work well."
COents,3deuv2,Bodie217,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:01:17 2015 UTC,"Can you explain more about concentrates? Like I said, total newbie!!  And yeah it explicitly says no cannabis. So I need to be super careful."
COents,3deuv2,DDiggler321,2,Wed Jul 15 19:44:31 2015 UTC,"So other then traditional buds you have several vape options, edibles, tinctures. The least smell options are edibles and tincture, though it's not the same as smoking or vaping, the high can be different specifically more body focused.   There are a few Vape options. You can get a vape designed for buds, but the smell here while better then traditional smoking the tell tale smell is still there. Concentrate vapes are better smell wise and now come in several options. You can find concentrate vapes you load yourself with Wax, Shatter or CO2 oil, or there are options like the O-pen and Neos that produce pre-filled vape pen cartridges that simply screw on to any vape battery, no loading required.   There are lots of options for you here in CO, but the best one will involve saving up cash for your own single family house allowing you to consume any way you like."
COents,3deuv2,lemon467,2,Thu Jul 16 03:55:55 2015 UTC,Living in my second apartment in Colorado with strict no cannabis/no smoking rules. I've dabbed and vaped in both places with no complaint.   What you use really depends on your smoking habits/style. I'm a somewhat heavy consumer so I dab as well as using a tabletop vape (Silver Surfer) in the evening. If you don't consume as much you could get by with a concentrate pen and/or portable herb vape.   I think any of those methods would probably work with a roommate as long as you kept the door closed. If you're really worried about smell you could get a Smoke Buddy.
COents,3deuv2,Sublime1996,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:57:22 2015 UTC,"One thing I've done in college dorms and apartments is a cheap version of the Smoke Buddy I see others are recommending.  I'm guessing it may work better than this but if you're on a budget and need to get by, this hasn't failed me.  Get a cardboard tube (toilet paper or paper towel roll) and stuff with dryer sheets.  Inhale, breathe out through the tube and the dryer sheets help filter out the smell.  Change sheets as needed.  Vape is going to smell less than if you straight burn the cannabis (smoke a bowl, joint, etc.) so go with that if you can.  Edibles may smell the least but can be unpredictable.  It can be weak one time, leading you to try a little more the next time.  This can lead to getting TOO high and make for an unenjoyable experience.  More so if your roommate happens to see you baked out of your mind."

DEFINITELY recommend Denver and the surrounding areas for living if you want to obtain good jobs. The Tech Industry is booming there. Some of the more affordable areas that I've found to live are Aurora and Cherry Creek which are both about a 10-15 minute drive to Downtown and great areas. If you want to live right in downtown (which I don't recommend because parking is terrible and traffic gets bad) Capital Hill or LoDo (Lower Downtown) are decently affordable.  The cost of living is definitely going up too - just to give you an example I'm moving into a 760sq ft 1 bedroom (newly renovated in Aurora) for 970/month.

Unless you plan on walking most everywhere I'd think you'd have a time beating the rental car with Uber unless you're only going to be taking a single one way trip a day, or a very short roundtrip.

COents,3d9h92,ParadoxPenis,3,Tue Jul 14 16:00:47 2015 UTC,"Hey dude!  Uber is big here, Lyft drivers are all over (they're even advertising on city buses), and they're a bit cheaper and just as good IMO.  RTD buses are hit or miss, depending on where you're going and what time of day it is.  The Light Rail is a bit more expensive, but it'll take  you'll to more major destinations more quickly than the buses.  You can also get a week-long pass, I think.  A rental car is an option if you know the city fairly well, but all of the streets downtown run diagonally and has a lot of areas that are One-Way only, whereas the streets outside of downtown run North/South and East/West.  It can get confusing, and Colfax is busy and slow most of the time.  Parking is fucked everywhere you go, and if there's a game downtown, you'll be SOL.  Besides, Coloradans just despise out of state drivers, and you'll get the finger once every block or so if you're a look-loo.

Maybe OP would benefit from like a low THC high CBD strain more than smoking overpriced shake. Seems like it'd cost about the same. Do they at least do a deal for bulk?

With many growers harvesting multiple times a year at different times I would imagine it would be impossible to trade futures on cannabis simply because you have no true picture of the entire market at any given time.

Ejmix is $30 for 50 ml  Elegant aware sells vape carts just like o.pen for about $2 each  I use about 1.5 ml per gram of concentrate and get about 3 500mg carts per batch. My total cost per cart works out to around $15 each so it is WAY cheaper and you can use your choice of concentrate (I prefer the CO2 oil syringes).   This isn't my primary vaping method but it is my favorite when I am on the go.
COents,3ctnd4,ugdave,2,Fri Jul 10 20:33:25 2015 UTC,I've done this. So let's talk about the downfalls. I used a kranger tank. Ejmix makes the atomizers burn up in days. Followed by the pen leaking lots of ejmix hash juice. Its a waste buy a globe and wax
COents,3ctnd4,secretne,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:15:38 2015 UTC,Amazon has it or you can get direct from them. Just google it you'll find it. You mix in shot glass in hot water bath- that's how I do it. Has really clear instructions on the label. Get a blunt tip syringe from your local pharmacy for easy filling and never have to buy pre filled carts again.

COents,3ctnd4,green_euphoria,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:42:28 2015 UTC,That's what I do but you will get a feel for it. The instructions tell you to start with 1ml then dilute additionally as needed. I get oil that's like 80% thc so if I use 1.5 - 2ml I end up with a cart that is like 30% thc. So my carts are even stronger than o.pen ones. Another advantage! I have also used shatter and budder and ejmix works with them all.

Answer - Yes. Adult residents can grow up to 6 marijuana plants per person. No more than 12 total plants are allowed per residence regardless of the number of adults living there.  Marijuana plants must be kept in an enclosed, locked area, and growers should take extra precautions to ensure that only authorized adults have access to the marijuana plants.

COents,3clu7f,Colorado222,2,Thu Jul 9 16:32:30 2015 UTC,"I really like the idea of becoming so proficient at growing your own at home that you'd prefer it to anything I you could purchase from dispensaries. Unfortunately finances/time/skill forbid that for me at this point in time from realizing that, but that's a really exciting concept."
COents,3clu7f,Colorado222,4,Thu Jul 9 17:29:25 2015 UTC,"I definitely had that thought when I started. Though as I started to measure how much I was spending on rec (~$100-$200/mo) it became clear that growing my own would be cheaper. Initial investment was the most expensive. However, with some research and planning I was able to find some discounts on growing supplies and lower my costs. If you can get some started now you could possibly grow at little to no cost if you can grow outside. We have perfect weather to do so. Get that started now so that come ~October you will have your first harvest and can start saving for lights and what not. Woot.com has great sales on MH/HPS lighting kits every now and again and you can either build or buy a grow tent easily for under $100. Seeds or clones should be easy to come by as well. Check out /r/microgrowery for lots of great resources for small grows.   I personally have one 3x3x6 tent with a 500watt LED for my vegging plants and a 4x4x8 with a 400watt MH/HPS and 300watt LED for my flowering plants. With electricity, nutrients, and soil I am exceeding my expectations that I would pay big for at stores.   EDIT: Colorado Fuck yeah"
COents,3clu7f,mesostoney,3,Thu Jul 9 18:25:13 2015 UTC,"I hope so, but I won't know any time soon I guess.  I've been self-sufficient since about April, and usually have a surplus to give away to friends. Always have people asking if I sell, but I insist on staying 100% legit, so I just give friends some free bud whenever I see them. It's nice to be able to spread around a healing plant like that.  One thing that disappointed me when I first moved here was how relatively tasteless or even harsh a lot of dispensary bud was. I mean, that shouldn't really happen in a vaporizer. And smoking joints was a super harsh experience. I now have the luxury of only smoking/vaping bud that has been cured for at least a month, that I know has been properly flushed and cut at just the right time. Nothing ever rushed. There is one dispensary I get clones from every couple of months, but for the most part I don't have to visit them anymore. Saves me a whole lot of money, though getting the perpetual grow going to the level I have it at was quite an investment upfront. But hey, what is a couple grand upfront to be able to have limitless bud for a minimal increase in electric costs?"
COents,3clu7f,myrandomweedacct,2,Thu Jul 9 17:47:25 2015 UTC,I just want to say i've been extremely disappointed with the quality of rec bud here.  I've lived here all my life and the brick weed i used to get for 40 an oz is better than some of the buds i've seen for $30 an eighth before tax.  The quality is downright embarrassing.  I don't have any grower connections any more but the quality I've seen from rec isn't even worth the money.
COents,3clu7f,DDiggler321,4,Thu Jul 9 23:45:15 2015 UTC,"It really depends on how you rate things. Quality is king but price and selection matter almost as much, when you add in service and ease of shopping (waiting for dealer to call back, hanging out with dealer watching How It's Made for an hour because fucker ain't got friends). Regular store hours and lab testing are both beautiful things.   As for pure quality? Small batch will always be king. The amount of love and attention each plant gets is maxed with small batch cannabis and stretched way thin is large production grows.   You can find rec shops with amazing quality, but you have to visit 12 shops selling hoop house mids to find that 1 stand out."

I also work in a shop down here and because of that I really try not to suggest specific shops down here. I have hit a few places in Springs and Denver that had great quality in that moment, but all of those were single visits and a quick gram or 2 while I was stuck out of meds for a day or 2.   I have been an Ent for a long time and have no trouble seeing why people fork over 2 or 3 times what they should be paying per gram just not have to deal with black market bull shit.  It's not always that they're friendless, If it was a dealer I liked and respected (their work ethic, price, selection, reliability) I don't want to look like ""in and out traffic"" it's always better to look like you're there for drum lessons or to hang out with a friend for a little bit after work than someone on the block to buy weed from the house on the corner."

COents,3cl6kh,capytan,2,Thu Jul 9 22:20:17 2015 UTC,"I've got some friends that have used it successfully.. Depends on what test they use and what they're testing for. Find out as much as you can about the way you need to give your sample, as well as how they test (dipstick, gas chromatography, etc). If you're going to be watched, you're not going to pass with it. Any court ordered tests I've heard of there's someone in the room right there to ensure the urine comes out of your body.  I've heard of three people using it in the last year (for jobs) that all passed. But the most recent person I heard use it got flagged as ""not human"" and was ordered to retest.  Bottom line, it's the best thing if you're SOL anyways and they're not going to watch you. If they're watching you, they'll catch you and you'll be in a lot more trouble. Trust me.  Also, make sure you're getting it from a credible source, if you do choose to go ahead with it. Good luck, I hope everything works out!"

Being from the great state of Colorado and it being on such short notice, I can't think or any other option at this point."

Not to ruin your day, but I've heard from 100% reliable sources that if it's dilute the first time they watch the second (but that's for jobs). So do what you can you prepare for that. If you use the synthetic, be sure to practice keeping temp where it needs to be. If you don't mind, pm me if they watched or not. Best of luck to you."

Do you know how damn easy it is to get a pure cannabis extract and put it in a empty vape pen? oPens are for tourists or those who don't know any better.  Also, in recent studies they found the PG in ecigs to be harmful to lung tissue. We were given this amazing plant in a pure form, why fuck with that?"

COents,3cfgq6,ugdave,2,Tue Jul 7 18:01:39 2015 UTC,"I used o.pen for about a year, and also got co2 stuff in a syringe. I always tried to figure out how to refill the cartridge part but always failed. My advice would be to just buy a new one, however, if you do try it, do some research on the burning temp and such because that could influence your rip.   Did that make sense?  Not sure anymore, if I'm writing English..   Edit: Also I just got them at any dispensary, however, alive herbal medicines had some good deals for a cartridge. But really, I've moved on to just buying wax shatter or something else to smoke with a rig. These are usually only 25-35 dollars. Any more money and I start to not notice a difference quality because I smoke way too often"
COents,3cfgq6,yeradolt,2,Tue Jul 7 14:53:33 2015 UTC,"i was in the same boat as you and after much research am glad to share the answer with you.  ejmix is what you are looking for.  the co2 oil in the syringe is too viscous to fill the cart.  ejmix costs like $30 for 50 ml which is expensive for PEG/PG or whatever they are making that out of, but they got the mix exactly right.  I have tried VG/PG with no success.  I mix about 1.5-2 ml of ejmix with a gram of concentrate (wax, shatter, or the oil from syringe) and then use a blunt tip syringe (you can get one for free at a local pharmacy normally) to suck that shit up and fill the carts.  you can get empty carts from a company called Elegant Aware.  That's what I do.  So I get CO2 oil that's like 80% thc so when I do this process my final cart is around 30% thc.  So mine are stronger than open and end up costing me like $10-12 for 500 mg.  I can make about 3 carts out of a gram of oil.  The cart and ejmix cost per cart is about $2.  I don't use this 100% of the time.  I prefer straight concentrate off my vacavapes cannon/eleaf istick 50W.  But there is nothing better when I'm on the go, and I have even gone through TSA with these carts on top of my liquids bag and nobody bats an eye.  The stealth factor is off the charts on these.  edit because i put 500 ml but meant 500 mg."

COents,3cck9f,Crashpad03,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:52:18 2015 UTC,Works perfectly just don't over tighten it. It actually works way better than my titanium one but it was pretty shitty to begin with. Holds heat extremely well. Temp used to drop 15-20 degrees with my ti nail and with this it stays within 2-3 degrees of the set temp even when dabbing. Only thing you really need to take into consideration is there aren't really any carb caps that fit it except maybe the Hive (no idea.) I've been using a cheapo ceramic carb cap that doesn't fit but sits on top. And makes a nice seal.   Edit: the dab cap and side carb are supposed to be the shit according to the creator but I'm cheap and didn't spring for it.

The green dot is great, especially the black label (but it is very pricey).  As has also been said, it is not the cheapest shop around.   But, I have found they have several great discounts for members and for those who are badged in the industry, as well as loyalty cards and some other stuff.

Also lots of in-house CBD oils and tinctures and stuff to choose from, just to name a few things. The store itself is very nice too. A bit pricier than a lot of medical places, but worth it imo.

There were literally 15 plus people back not including the group I was in roaming around and trying to check out.

When Emerald first opened they came on here posting trying to stir up some attention. They said they were pricing their bud competitively ""out of respect to Maggie's farm."" I called them on their bullshit, informed them that we know they're busting heads because they can and for no other reason, and they deleted their entire account.

I ask bc I honestly don't know, I was under the impression you could use CO2 & ice or something similar to make hash. I know theres a lot of dispensaries that make hash without the use of butane. Is it just not feasible for residential purposes or just not as efficient?"
COents,3bx8rz,Dank_Kushington,2,Fri Jul 3 15:23:05 2015 UTC,"Co2 extraction is banned under the new rules.  (Plus it requires expensive equipment.)  Ice water hash will not work in an e-cig style vaporizer.  Butane and Co2 are the only real ways to make hash oil.  There is a way called rosin, but it is extremely small scale, (as in you can only process one or two hits at a time, it would take days to process three large harvested plant's worth) and many people do not like the taste/product it produces."

COents,3b7srq,irieCO,3,Fri Jun 26 17:40:04 2015 UTC,If you're a single issue voter and that issue is cannabis then you should be primarying/caucusing for Paul or Sanders.  Is anyone shocked by that?
COents,3b7srq,nopantsirl,4,Sat Jun 27 09:04:14 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure even if you aren't a single issue voter, those are the best each party has to offer.  People are too eager to shit on one to boost the other despite the fact that they're not competing against each other, and likely never will get the chance. Personally, I would love a DNC more like Sanders and a GOP more like Paul."
COents,3b7srq,rainbowwow,6,Sat Jun 27 16:47:22 2015 UTC,I've never heard of that site. What I do know is Bernie Sanders wants full legalization and Rand Paul is still spitting stupid GOP propaganda (source: http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/3460009)
COents,3b7srq,TheSpaceFish,5,Sat Jun 27 02:00:02 2015 UTC,"You've never heard of the Marijuna Policy Project? They are the lobbying group for weed in Washington. Also, do you have a source saying Bernie Sanders is for full legalization? Cus from what I understand is he is pro medical, states rights, and decriminalization, but I have never seen anything from him supporting outright legalization.  I don't necessarily agree with these ratings, but MPP is pretty big."

COents,3b7srq,jleastin,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:27:23 2015 UTC,"This sounds like total decriminalization, like what they have in Portugal, but that is quite different than a legal and regulated system. Someone else posted another article that said he was in favor of regulation, but it wasn't a direct quote of him so who knows. I know he is in favor of decriminalization, medical, and state rights, and I mostly support him because he considers himself a socialist."
COents,3b7srq,mr_lemonpie,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:41:33 2015 UTC,"I believe he has said he is in favor of regulation, but like many others wanted to wait a bit and see how things went in Colorado, so far things are going great there.  That letter was written in the 70's I believe, right before the ""war on drugs"" really started.  It is old, but he has always stood by everything he has said.  I will see what I can find about it.  Oh and the MPP scored Bernie a B or B+ I think, which I'm perfectly ok with, I don't vote for president based on who's going to legalize a recreational product, as I""m sure most people don't base their vote on it ;)  Full legalization is coming, the first dominoes have toppled, the others will soon follow."
COents,3b7srq,jleastin,5,Sun Jun 28 05:52:14 2015 UTC,"I mean he was the the first senator to endorse recreational use. He also has great track of not arresting people for marijuana offense when he was mayor of Burlington (http://thehill.com/regulation/legislation/242569-bernie-sanders-talks-pot) (Good interview which talks about his legalization efforts as a senator (http://time.com/13328/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-2016/)   Sorry I'd never heard of the Marijuana Lobby, that's interesting and great that we have money in Washington fighting the good fight but Rand Paul would be a horrible choice not just from a broad presidential standpoint but specifically from a cannabis standpoint."
COents,3b7srq,TheSpaceFish,2,Sat Jun 27 15:20:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah he is for sure the guy I'm backing because I believe in socialism (universal health care, free uni for all etc). That second article is very interesting because it does say he supports legalization and taxation, which I haven't seen anywhere else, just that he is a fan of decriminalization (of all drugs), medical, and states rights."

COents,3b74qf,STEBCO,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:08:28 2015 UTC,"Here is basically how testing worked up until a month or so ago when I quit the industry.   A strain needed to be tested for potency like 6 times initially. Then a dispensary could take an average or range of those numbers for the label requirement. A strain needs to be re tested every 6 months (I believe) after that.   Testing for potency is required, but I'm sure lots of places are non compliant. Testing for contaminates and microbial was NOT required. Shit I saw go to the store is what helped me to decide to leave....   This may be an unpopular opinion, don't fully trust any company when it comes to genetics or their product in general."

She would dig it so I figured I'd ask.  But totally honestly there would be no hard feelings if that isn't something that you feel works.  Interested to know how BSG plays.

She understands and agrees with that opinion, but does not partake herself.  I actually use my vape while we watch tv together.  I feel it's important for the next generation to not be raised with the stigma I was - it creates un-natural responses (both in desiring to partake before you would personally choose to as well as fervor against). As for alcohol, I haven't seen any behavior so far that would be inappropriate. I had a problem with alcohol for many years so you guys can't touch what she's seen with me - haha!  She is also really fun and would be a good player addition.  She's my little geek clone but in gay female form.  haha!  Maybe we can try it out if you have one next week.

I don't understand the whole creating a public nuisance angle, any place that allows for this would be just as it was before except the smoke coming out of it would be much better smelling and less carcinogenic.

COents,3ao3qp,sonowruhappy1,2,Tue Jun 23 14:26:45 2015 UTC,"Hey there, sonowruhappy1!  We certainly don't want to violate any rules for COents or for Reddit. We made this account specifically because we had noticed some less-than-favorable comments about our dispensaries and we wanted to be able to dispel any rumors and misinformation floating around.   For example, a user recently posted saying they had paid $75 for an 8th from one of our stores, which is strange since we do not charge that much for an 8th. We informed that user of our pricing and they seemed to genuinely appreciate the information.   As to the user who posted an unflattering photo of our product, we always encourage our customers to have the budtenders open up the bottle they plan to purchase so they can inspect the quality of the product for themselves. Some nugs come out better looking than others, and our customers are free to choose a better looking batch before they make their final purchase.  Now, we did post some promotional content earlier (which we have gone ahead and deleted). If this type of post is unacceptable, we sincerely apologize and will refrain from posting in that manner in the future. We're still new to Reddit so please be gentle!  If there are any other rules we should abide by, please let us know! We'd love to continue being a part of this great community, and we don't want to do anything that would jeopardize the integrity and fun of COents.   Thanks for moderating!"

COents,3amaeg,Duh_Dernals,9,Sun Jun 21 16:53:22 2015 UTC,"Heres what I came up with while smoking and drinking at the pool. I don't know a ton about the rec side since I'm a med patient and mostly I grow my own. Hopefully some other more knowledgable people are willing to contribute to this.   Another thought would be to just have a stickied post called ""COents: Ask Us Anything"" or something similar where out of towners could ask their questions. At least that way everything is located in a single thread for all the lazies out there.      COents VISITOR FAQ     Dispensaries      Are all dispensaries pretty much the same?  Just like liquor stores dispensaries will vary widely from what they carry on their shelves to the overall atmosphere. Feel free to shop around. Don’t feel bad about taking a look at everything on offer and don’t feel bad if you decide not to make a purchase. Your best resources for finding places to shop are weedmaps, leafly, or even westword magazine.        If the budtender hands me a big jar of nugs to look at can I pick some up to examine them closer?  All dispensaries operate differently. Some places will not let you touch the cannabis while examining, others will. It is always best to ask your budtender.       What time do dispensaries close?  It varies by city. Inside Denver city limits all stores must close at 7pm. No exceptions. This means that usually the final transaction will happen around 6:45pm.  Some of the surrounding cities can stay open until 10pm or even midnight.       I’m getting into town late, where can I shop?  Inside Denver city limits all stores must close at 7pm. No exceptions. This means that usually the final transaction will happen around 6:45pm.  You can use weedmaps or leafly to find other shops but here are some of the surrounding areas and a few shops s that stay open late in the greater Denver area:            Greenworkz – Edgewater         5840 w 25th Ave.         Edgewater, CO 80214         Monday – Sunday: 10am to 11:55pm          Terrapin Care Station – Aurora 10pm         11091 E. Mississippi Ave.         Aurora, CO 80012         303.954.8402 x3         OPEN DAILY 8 AM - 10 PM          Medicine Man Aurora         Open 8-10pm 7 days      Possession, consumption, transportation:     I’ll be at the airport for X amount of time on a layover; do I have time to get to a dispensary/smoke?  If you have less than a 5 hour layover you probably won’t have time to make the trip and you certainly won’t enjoy the experience. The closest dispensaries to D.I.A. are located on Peoria St. @i70. The closest of the bunch is Pink House and according to Google maps it’s 15.3mi or 20min each way without traffic issues. There is a good chance you will have to wait a few minutes to get waited on and you will have to smoke somewhere as well. It will be very rushed.        Where can I smoke?  A bit of courtesy and self-control go a long way in making cannabis consumption enjoyable for everyone, including those who don’t consume. All public places are off limits. Public consumption is illegal and you will be ticketed.        Can I smoke in my car? Can I smoke while driving?  No. Just like drinking and driving you shouldn’t do it first because it’s a danger to others and second you can be given a DUI. You shouldn’t smoke in your car because if pulled over you will very likely get a DUI when the officer smells burnt marijuana, if you are suspected and required to submit to a test you will likely fail as the threshold for what is considered impairment is so low.       Is it legal to have cannabis in the car when I travel?  Yes, as long as the cannabis is in an opaque childproof container. If the cannabis is not properly stored it will be considered an open container and a citation will be issued.       Can I bring cannabis home on the plane?  No.       What would happen if I forgot some cannabis in one of my bags before heading to the airport?  If you for instance forget a joint or small personal amount within the legal limit (7g for out of state) in your bag and were caught, you’re not going to go to a back room to be interrogated before being sent to federal prison. There are stories of a very small number of people who have been caught with cannabis in their possession by the TSA who will bring in a uniformed police officer and the person being detained is simply asked to throw whatever they had away."

The wiki exists even if there's no link the in sidebar, and maybe they'll add a link: http://www.reddit.com/r/COents/wiki/index  However, I think it's insane /r/denver devoted their sticky to the shittiest types of posts that hit the community.  You're only allowed one sticky, I think it should continue being the rec deals -- that serves locals and visitors alike.

COents,3amaeg,DeviatedNorm,3,Mon Jun 22 00:59:22 2015 UTC,"Ok so my thing is that there's a potential for the same questions to be asked by a tourist and a resident.

A resident could ask about friendly hotels and camping outside the metro area. Aside from easy questions, what's the criteria I use to remove? Just mentioning you're from out of town? I like clear criteria for myself and others to follow. Also, if this is something people want then we need another mod.

I really admire that you really want to play fairly within clear rules but it really isn't that big of a thing to have ""vague"" rules like ""no tourist questions"" and then moderate each on a case by case basis.

The content of those questions is irrelevant.  It doesn't bother me that those folks want our opinions, it bothers me that there's so many of them and it's all the same couple of questions.  I don't want to not hear anything, but I also don't want to just hear noise.

COents,3amaeg,ClarkEnt420,2,Mon Jun 22 13:36:13 2015 UTC,"Well, and we've already got /r/vacationcolorado -- no reason for two shitty subs devoted to shitty questions, I'll allow weedy questions to be posted and unanswered over there lol  I'll do a new FAQ, but really there already is one and aside from ""what dispensary should I visit?"" I think all the standard questions are answered.  Is it read? Of course not.  FAQs, wikis...these ultimately are just a lot of work for no one's benefit, the people we want to use them never do.  But ultimately, I don't think we need to be doing anything.  I think /u/hellvis had a great idea over at /r/colorado -- we're not the tourism bureau and there's already tons of people all over the internets devoted to giving a fuck about you visiting Colorado.   We don't need to give a fuck too."
COents,3amaeg,diospacifico,3,Mon Jun 22 13:57:37 2015 UTC,"It's not about the basic info. The basic stuff is in the sticky like all the other FAQs on the subject. I think the larger issue is that this is one of the few places on the internet you can find a concentrated group of almost all COents.  People don't want a FAQ. They want to talk to people. The locals. The boots on the ground. They want to know why locals may pick up some of bontanicos shatter, instead of mahhatmah. They want to know who cures their buds for a month or two before sale. They want to know if ""Steve"" at ""X"" shop is always an asshole on  the morning shift. They want insider info.  I really think the people looking for the type of answers as above, don't have many options in places to ask. Not saying that means that /r/COents should be it, but a FAQ will never cover more than the most basic tourist questions.  Mind you, I'm pointing out reasoning, not offering a way to fix it. I don't think you can fix the mass of touristy posts without a mod slapping them down non stop. That'll be a part time job by itself.  Edit:  Source: Past resident. Current tourists."

COents,3aqgpz,Mojo_Funkmaster,2,Mon Jun 22 17:57:57 2015 UTC,"Without any experience working in the industry, you're going to be limited to budtender, trimmer, and packaging positions.   Pretty much the only way you can get a growing job is by having prior experience growing in the cannabis industry (they usually don't care if you have black market or home grow experience), or have a related college degree like in botany or horticulture. Many places will give trimmers the chance at a low level growing job once they've worked for them awhile though, so if you want to grow but don't have the qualifications then that would be your best route.  Honestly it isn't too difficult to get a job in the industry.  There may be 100 other applicants to the same position, but 90% of those probably have no chance at the job anyway because of their appearance or employment history.  Its not that hard to stand out from the pack if you really try to present yourself as professional as possible."

COents,3ad1xx,DeviatedNorm,4,Fri Jun 19 04:17:38 2015 UTC,Open carry in Denver isn't banned in Denver because the law was around first.  A Denver court found that Denver's population density and crime rate were big enough mitigating factors that it outweighed any need for statewide uniformity in laws.  The case was then brought up to the Colo Supreme Court who was perfectly split (a judge abstained) and because they were split the decision reverts to the earlier court.  Denver is permitted to ban open carry because the courts found they're special.

But my main point stands, that it's a moot point to say Castle Rock allows open carry with some derisive implication. The entire state allows open carry, and Castle Rock cannot pass a stricter law.  However, I feel like the language of the law allows local jurisdictions to regulate cultivation as long as it is not stricter than the 6 plant per person limit. Kind of silly, but the lingering fear and stigmas will eventually pass."

Just tried Sweet Leaf on Evans Black Cherry Pie sap, 53% CBD and around 20% THC. Very medicating but I'd prefer a 1:1 ratio.   I originally replied to this post because I dislike the term 'stoner' simply because you have a card (but I really don't mean to get into a debate about my personal beliefs).    Just out of curiosity, what's your medical condition?  It'd help your doctor to know exactly what you're medicating for, that way you can get the proper ratio set up. 1:1 ratio isn't always the best way to go, especially depending on your condition.  I have my card to treat ideopathic epilepsy (chronic seizures), and mild OA (pain & inflammation) so my products are suited to meet my needs --R4 strain from a dispensary on Broadway, Charlotte from Realm of Caring, Apothecanna creme from my local shop--.    Did you get a red card so you could get different strains, or did a doctor sit down with you and explain some things to you?  Either way, enjoy the card! MMJ is top notch, but cheaper isn't always better.  True meds cost money sometimes (lots of hoops to jump through if you want Charlotte).  I'd be more than happy to edit this post later this evening, and put up the names, addresses, and phone numbers of a few places for you to check out."

Do you just mean like the REAL DEAL from the Stanley bros/CW botanicals? I've seen CW a few times at Kind Love (my main dispensary) and I've tried it twice but wasn't impressed in terms of what it did for my pain. Other strains I've tried are harlequin and cannatonic, can't remember where I got them TBH. Both seemed a bit better than the CW I got from KL.   I medicate for IBS and for chronic wrist pain from multiple injuries/surgeries. I mainly use topical's to treat my wrist which is great especially during the day as I can use as needed wherever I find myself. On the other hand if my IBS causes me issues during the day I haven't found a great solution for medicating as the best strains I have found for IBS are all heavy Indica's. I can't medicate with Indica's during the day because they tend to leave me too lethargic and ruin my productivity. This leads to a compromise where I use a hybrid that leans towards the sativa side of things. I'm currently freelancing from home so I can medicate during the day if I need. I prefer smoking/vaping to edibles.   Any info on CBD strains or places to look would be greatly appreciated."

Real quickly, let me post this (which I get directly from the Stanley brothers/CWB):  ""In addition to our commitment to provide products of the highest possible quality, we are also dedicated to continue our support of RoC by providing discounted pricing to RoC members.  As access to Charlotte’s Web™ Hemp Products has been restricted to the RoC wait list, all pricing to date has reflected our commitment to RoC members. You will notice on our new website that other CW™ products will soon be available to the general market and that retail pricing has been implemented.""  http://www.cwbotanicals.com  In other words, I get a discount if I fill out a shitload of paperwork (hooray, epilepsy?), I get bumped up on the list of patients waiting to receive Charlotte products if they're in short supply, I get CW directly from RoC, I don't have to pay retail price.

That stupid strain looked great growing though and smelled good so I always kept it going and tried to make it work. She was such a tease. I even tried different mediums (soil, soilless, full hydro) nothing made a difference in the end product, it always sucked major ass. Also bumped into powdery mildew like I mentioned too.

Now that both of these are im effect together, i can do something completely for my health, and get fired for it. I would like to see how the ADA covers this."
COents,39x2z3,doctorwaiter,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:43:11 2015 UTC,yeah i kinda figured that would be how this would go.

COents,39x2z3,RagingOrangutan,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:44:23 2015 UTC,Maybe so but taking it off the narcotics schedule and letting states set their own laws on it is actually a position that both democrats and libertarians can get behind.
COents,39x2z3,mario_meowingham,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:49:54 2015 UTC,"I would say Republicans are bigger advocates for state's rights than Democrats. And while pretty much all libertarians support legalization, it's only the most socially liberal Democrats that support it.  All successful legalization at the state level has happened by referendum; there isn't even a single state whose legislature was significantly in support of legalization for a bill to even come close to passing.  It's taking some time for the (older) legislators to get up to speed with the (younger) populace's shifting attitudes towards legalization. And it's not a big enough issue for most people to really sway their vote, so the politicians are playing it safe."
COents,39x2z3,RagingOrangutan,3,Tue Jun 16 02:01:47 2015 UTC,"Republicans claim to be in favor of states rights but i dont think their rhetoric really matches their actions. For example, two deep red states filed suit against colorado trying to overturn amendment 64 because, they claim, the federal prohibition on marijuana trumps our state law.

I'm not usually a defender of O-Pen...but I just recently tried their new blends with proprietary cartrdiges and I have to say, I was pretty damn Impressed.  No PG throat harshness like I get from others on the market.    I also typically prefer pure c02 oil cartridges, and O-Pen have pretty much the only GUARANTEED cartridge to work.  Even companies who said they would in the past don't guarantee those anymore: Golden Barn, EvoLab, Colorado Cannabis Company, etc.   Everyone is right that EvoLab oil is bomb though.    Never did I think I would be defending O-Pen on these boards, but those dudes have seriously upped their game in the past year.  If you haven't tried them in awhile, it may be time to test out another.  I for one am glad I got the opportunity to."

It costs $33, much less than 500mg of Open ""juice"".

The regulations state that the cultivation areas have to be in a locked space that is out of public view.  The only large-scale outdoor commercial grows that I know of here are either in greenhouses or secluded compounds that have 10 ft high fences and razor wire.    Also growing outdoors in Colorado is not as profitable as growing indoors.  Outdoor grows are cheaper to build and get started, but are severely limited by the cold winters here and only being able to grow 1-2 crops per year.  Compared to a self-contained warehouse that can grow the exact same quality product 365 days a year, outdoor greenhouse grows just can't produce the same consistency."
