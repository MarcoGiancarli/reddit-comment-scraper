I've got the first banshee and this works just fine. I would make sure the vst is outputting as it normally should (aka out of your speakers), before you connect the tb. If you still can't get sound out of your tb it's either the cable or the tb itself. This could easily be tested by plugging in almost any low level device into the tb directly, like an ipod or a guitar.   The only thing I would add is:   Make sure you're going ""line in"" into your interface since the output of the mic pre is line out.  Force your vst to mono, since it will all come out of a single output."

FL_Studio,3e57ff,Falvio,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:40:13 2015 UTC,"Tons of ways !  You can add a filter to the synth's mixer track and automate the cutoff to slowly let in new frequencies. This is probably the most common way and is probably what you're looking for.  You can automate the volume of the instrument via the channel window volume knob. (Don't automate the mixer volume, it will cause you tons 'o trouble)  You can create a unique pattern and set the velocities of each note to gradually get louder. Also, with this method, you can link the velocity to some parameter (keytracking) and get even better results.     To automate a parameter/knob, RIGHT-CLICK and select 'Create Automation Clip'."
FL_Studio,3e57ff,giga_mango,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:40:24 2015 UTC,"Try adding an instance of Fruity Love Philter to your synth mixer track.  RIGHT-CLICK on the left/right arrows at the top-right of the Love Philter window and select the 'Simple lowpass' preset.  Make sure the '1' tab is selected and then play with the CUT knob to experiment with the effect.  You should notice that when the knob is turned all the way to the left your sound will be very dull and bassy. As you turn to the right, more frequencies are allowed through and the sound will brighten and get louder."
FL_Studio,3e57ff,giga_mango,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:47:55 2015 UTC,"You're gonna use something called automation. Which basically is a way to control parameters automatically as the song goes on. Right click on most any knob or control in FL and you will see an option reading ""Create Automation Clip"". It's helpful to highlight the section of your playlist you specifically want to automate so that you don't create an automation clip for the entire song, just one section. You could accomplish the effect you desire by automating a filter cutoff, a compressor ratio, an EQ cutoff, or straight just the mixer fader or a gain nob in say ""Fruity Limiter"". I would go on youtube and look up something like ""FL Automation Tutorial"" I'm sure youll find a video that can show you exactly what you're looking for"

If you still have FL 11 installed, hover over the Circular Panning Law button and the hint bar tells you that it's a toggle between circular and triangular panning laws.  Why are you changing the panning law anyway? There's no need to.  :)"
FL_Studio,3e16yh,coranns,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:28:39 2015 UTC,Oh ok thanks :) I usually don't anymore but I always thought it sounded a little bit different even if you're using just one sound centered. Is that not true?
FL_Studio,3e16yh,coranns,4,Tue Jul 21 04:31:42 2015 UTC,"Yes it does sound different, but it's only a volume difference. From the FL manual:   The purpose is to maintain a constant apparent volume as a sound is panned. For example, if a sound is panned hard left or right, only one speaker will be active. This will sound quieter than the center position where both speakers are active, unless steps are taken to counteract this effect.  Circular panning maintains a constant apparent volume by progressively lowering the combined volume of the L+R channels by -3dB as the pan passes dead center.  Triangular panning does not apply this compensation, so the apparent loudness will increase as the sound passes the center position.   All DAWs follow panning laws, and circular is a very common because it allows for even loudness.  :)"
FL_Studio,3e16yh,nadfest,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:36:20 2015 UTC,"As the FL Studio GURU says ""The F1 key is your friend"". http://www.image-line.com/support/FLHelp/html/songsettings_settings.htm the manual goes onto say  NOTES: Don't fret over what panning law is or isn't used. When you mix a song, the relative pan positions and volumes are adjusted according to what you wanted to hear. In other words, you made the mix, you made it how you wanted it to sound (hopefully). So, a mix is a mix! Panning law is only a concern when sharing projects to make sure both installations are using the same settings. Changing the panning law after a project is mixed will change relative volumes and apparent stereo locations and so the mix (bad idea). If you are sharing track stems (audio from individual mixer tracks) then the panning law used by the project is 'rendered' into each stereo track, so is not a factor to worry about."
FL_Studio,3e13c6,pyotur,8,Tue Jul 21 03:36:23 2015 UTC,"They can't do that internally. They are mixer effects, which means they receive audio input, not MIDI input. There's no way for them to know when the next note starts.  However, you can replicate this behaviour by adding a Fruity Envelope Controller in the Channel Rack, routing MIDI into it, then simply mapping Love Philter knobs to the Envelope Controller. Enveloper Controller can be set to retrigger each time a new MIDI note is received.  :)"

If you've played around with the band settings, raising one or two of them by more than a little bit will noticeably increase the volume. With all EQs, it's better to remove frequencies than to try to add them."
FL_Studio,3dw0aj,Nanteitandaro,2,Mon Jul 20 00:15:34 2015 UTC,"Have you tried soloing each track, exporting them separately, and seeing if they succeed? It may be that one track is the culprit, and that all the others are fine. If you notice that only one has issues while exporting solo, see how things work if you export all the tracks together except that one.  My guess is that when you're exporting, your plugins are either all turning to render quality (way more demanding than preview) and hitting the CPU ceiling (Make sure you have it set to High-Performance, so that you don't have issues the clocking changing during the render), you're hitting a memory size wall, or you have a misbehaving plugin or automation track hiding from you.  If you can verify everything exports on its own, and it's only when it works on the whole thing, it's almost definitely a hardware limitation and you'll be stuck chunking up recording, or turning off the render-quality settings in the export panel."

It might be that I've got so much side chaining going on..  I'll try all of your suggestions though, thanks a lot for taking the time to help, I really appreciate it.   If you ever need feedback on something I'd be happy to help in return!"
FL_Studio,3dw0aj,lecoine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:25:16 2015 UTC,Like exactly mid track or just somewhere in the track?   Yeah I'd try to disable third party plugins in the master as test first
FL_Studio,3dw0aj,Mr1derful816,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:58:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's just random.. Sometimes it will export silence, other times 3/4  Really killing me, gotta get this out.   I'll try thirdparty plugs but I'm not using anything new"
