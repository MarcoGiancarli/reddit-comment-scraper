It was a traffic nightmare, especially for east nashville, when it was closed. But it beats 2 years of massive construction delays and traffic. If they divert through traffic onto briley, 440, and 840, then it should be inconvenient but ok.  http://archive.tennessean.com/article/20120410/NEWS01/304100029/Construction-will-close-24-bridges-Nashville"

I don't think you'll have to deal with much traffic working that far south of town if you live there. And that's a fairly inexpensive part of town to live in. The riverwood subdivision in Hermitage has townhouse for less than 200k, but they go quickly. There are lots of places around Old Hickory Blvd.   Set up a zillow search for that area or talk with a realtor about properties in that area. I can give you the contact info for the person we're working with right now. We looked at 12 properties Saturday.  The apartment looks nice, though. Well kept from the photos. That area is much less expensive to live than pretty much anywhere farther west of that point.  Good luck with everything. I hope you get lots of free shoes!"
nashville,3e2lrb,rwaynick,0,Tue Jul 21 14:12:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for the response. My girlfriend and I probably won't be looking to buy a house anytime soon. We like to rent, and we are looking to rent a house as well. We like to move around! Do you possibly have any recommendations at finding houses to rent?"
nashville,3e2lrb,rwaynick,2,Tue Jul 21 14:16:03 2015 UTC,"Zillow is a good bet. My realtor can help out with rentals, too. She'll charge a finder's fee, but I think it's $250 or something like that. If you're wanting to stay close to work, you shouldn't have much trouble finding something in your budget. As I said, that's a cheaper area to live and you won't have to deal with Interstate traffic."
nashville,3e2lrb,rwaynick,0,Tue Jul 21 14:31:52 2015 UTC,I would love to talk with your realtor today if that is possible!

nashville,3e2lrb,hoyter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:46:22 2015 UTC,"My fiance lived there for 3 years before we bought a house. It is a bit sketch, but the rent was really low. New owners bought the complex a few years ago and tried to update it (paint/flooring) but left alot of glaring issues. The gate was broken for years. Sometimes it would just get stuck in the pathway and you had to manually move it or drive in the exit. She had issues with the upstairs unit leaking water constantly down her walls. The fix was for maintenance to paint over the water stains rather than find the leak. I would be curious if her unit had mold in the walls.  Another issue was with some of the residents. She never had an issue with people breaking into her car, but it was common to walk outside and find a needle or other used paraphernalia laying on the ground.    She has been out for about a year, so things might have changed since then. She surprisingly felt safe there, though I didn't feel safe with her there. Once again, things might have changed in the last year for the better. The location was great! It was a cheap uber ride to downtown/east nashville for drinks."

nashville,3e2hux,Souliss,2,Tue Jul 21 17:28:33 2015 UTC,"Spikeball is the greatest new sport in the United States. (You might have recently seen them on Shark Tank.)  They say the sport is a mix of volleyball and 4-square, but really it is just like volleyball.  The difference is that instead of hitting the ball over the net onto the other team's side, you hit the ball onto a trampoline in any direction that you want. Teams are 2 on 2 and if one team lets the ball hit the ground, the other team gets the point.  Here is a how to play video: https://youtu.be/RULU1m9_008  And here is a video of how intense it can get if you really get into it: http://youtu.be/iiFR4XYnhGE"

It's my boyfriend's favorite venue just not my favorite. It's enjoyable though. I know it depends on the act/artist you're there to see.   Side story: We went to see Bob Seger with my boyfriend's parents. The concert goers there were the worst. The 60 yo lady in front of us did all of this during the show: filmed and took pictures on her iPad, watched Bob Seger videos on youtube while he was performing in from of her and shopped for Bob Seger t-shirts  in Amazon. And they say millennials are the worst..."

My husband and I were watching TwentyOnePilots and the lady who was sitting behind us went up closer to make a video.

nashville,3dy67h,Trueno07,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:11:47 2015 UTC,Had seats at the end of the aisle on the balcony last time I was there.  The performer on stage could only be seen smack dab at the end of the aisle from my vantage point.  I didn't see the first 20 minutes of the performance because ushers kept getting entire rows of people up and into the aisle to accommodate the late-comers.    The rest of the show was then punctuated with ushers coming down the aisle to escort people out for being on their phones or for being drunk and disorderly (which also involved getting people out of the rows to get to the troublemakers.) Would not want an aisle seat again unless I was in the first row of the balcony; the view was terrible.
nashville,3dy67h,37214,2,Mon Jul 20 16:58:52 2015 UTC,i never sit in the top. no leg room. no ass room. just sucks.  Section 5/6 for LIFE!

nashville,3dy67h,MakeMeBeautifulDuet,7,Mon Jul 20 14:46:57 2015 UTC,Truth has been spoken.  It sells out in seconds thanks to scalpers.  Wish we still had a way to get tickets in a lottery system at the box office.

Jason Isbell ""sold out"" in minutes, but I was able to get 4th row tickets after waiting for a few."

nashville,3dy67h,lazrbeam,3,Mon Jul 20 14:42:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the seating is a nightmare.  Happens at every venue, but there are always ""seat jumpers"" that the ushers have to move to get you to your seats.  I think the rows/aisles/seats are so tight there that it's extra annoying."
nashville,3dy67h,oshoney,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:48:28 2015 UTC,We went to see Nick Offerman and Megan Mullally a few months ago. The usher near us would beeline  towards anyone who was on their phone and tell them to put it up or they'll be escorted out. This was before the show started.   Being an usher there looks like an awesome job though.
nashville,3dy67h,Xandari11,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:23:43 2015 UTC,"I saw a girl escorted out after the usher told her 3 times during the show to put her phone away.  I've also seen the ushers be rather cool with patrons. Was at Bob Weir & Ratdog older lady in front of me took out a joint and sparked it up during a killer Stella Blue. Security walked up took her out, I thought damn that sucks about 10 minutes later she sat back down in her seat minus all her belongings."
nashville,3dy67h,Hubbardd,2,Mon Jul 20 19:32:34 2015 UTC,It could depend on the day too. Some people just have bad days at work and I'm sure ushers get tired of people trying to get closer seats and causing issues that they over-correct their attitudes.

nashville,3dy67h,oshoney,3,Mon Jul 20 17:22:22 2015 UTC,"honestly, what i love most about the ryman contributes to what i hate most about the ryman.  i love that you can see bands in such an intimate setting. for whatever reason, this gives the crowd extra incentive to be complete fucking douchebags. they show up late, film the whole damn thing with their phones, don't stop talking, and constantly try to heckle the performers."
nashville,3dy67h,Hubbardd,6,Mon Jul 20 22:21:43 2015 UTC,Yeah but the acoustics are just so perfect. I'm willing to sit in uncomfortable seats to not see something in a terrible sounding venue. Everyone ends up standing at most of the shows I've been to there anyways.
nashville,3dy67h,oshoney,-2,Mon Jul 20 15:24:50 2015 UTC,I was about to say the acoustics are nothing special actually.
nashville,3dy67h,lonelyinbama,6,Mon Jul 20 19:25:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're completely wrong. The Ryman's acoustics are second only to the Mormon Tabernacle in the entire world. If you ever are lucky enough to see an artist perform on stage without amplification, you'd understand why.  EDIT: Words are hard on phones."

nashville,3dy67h,jbraden,3,Tue Jul 21 00:50:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've been lucky enough to be there for some sound checks where an artist plays acoustically and without mics for a few tunes. You can hear every detail, even from the back row of the balcony. I also remember Jeff Tweedy closing a Wilco show this way doing Acuff Rose back in the early 2000s.   The problem, and I've talked to more than a few engineers and artists about this (Kenny Vaughn I think wrote an article about it), is that when they did the renovations to gain dressing room space, they lost some space in the auditorium and really limited where you can put the PA. Now it's EXTREMELY easy to blow out the room if you have a shitty engineer running sound with a band who brought in a giant PA and just cares about volume level. It's why shows there can be sort of hit and miss acoustically and very dependent on the band and their crew. But the room itself is very nearly acoustically perfect."

We were separated by an arm rest. The comfortableness of the seats didnt matter since as soon as they hit the stage everyone stood. We had a great time and it sounded awesome. I havent gone to many shows here though. I have been to Bridgestone Arena a couple of times and it was not great for sound. I also went to several Dancing in the District ten years ago. The Ryman was way better IMO.  I do hate that ""Mother Church"" nickname though."

nashville,3dze6j,jugglinglivebabies,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:39:42 2015 UTC,That's because Nashville isn't a major city on either coast.
nashville,3dze6j,OCCUPY_BallsDeep,10,Tue Jul 21 13:36:59 2015 UTC,The reason I ask this is because many employers use a Cost of Living Index to adjust salaries/wages compared to the rest of the nation. If our pay is adjusted to fit the slightly below average cost of living that Nashville was at a few years ago instead of what it is now (which I would assume has to be well above average) then a lot of us are getting the shaft.
nashville,3dze6j,Auriel619,8,Mon Jul 20 22:38:24 2015 UTC,"I'm with you 100% on this. I moved down from a decent-sized suburb in NJ, about 25 minutes outside of New York, for a new job in nashville. Although the job pays more, one of the ways my job justified not giving as much of an increase was due to the idea that the cost of living down here is less. According to that website, nashville should be 33% cheaper on average than up in NJ, but I'm paying the exact same, if not more, on most things like food and rent. I'd say the cost of living index needs serious adjustment and that the cost of living here is, anecdotally, the equivalent of living in NJ close to NYC."

nashville,3e0xke,RogerGoiano,2,Tue Jul 21 03:09:48 2015 UTC,You're right. I have been in a room with doctors who were being super sweet to me until they inevitably ask about birth control. The visit always goes south from there. It's about being comfortable talking to someone who examines you and takes care of you. It's a very vulnerable position to be in.
nashville,3e0xke,AmazinglyAudrey,2,Tue Jul 21 03:18:08 2015 UTC,"and on the doctor's side here - i wonder if they just lack training dealing with the LGBTetc. community, like they genuinely don't know/don't think that they are making their patient uncomfortable, or if they are acting unprofessionally on purpose. completely unrelated to my sex/gender/orientation, i've had doctors make me 100% uncomfortable and i guarantee you they had no idea. but when you're in the examining room in the midst of it all, it's very difficult to speak out and say something, especially when they hold information that's critical to your well-being."
nashville,3e0xke,RogerGoiano,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:32:20 2015 UTC,"As someone who is friends with/related to a few MDs, it's far more of an issue with older docs and docs in more conservative suburbs/areas than say with a doc in his 30-40s in Nashville proper.    Most of the Docs I've been to in Nashville proper could give less of a shit about who/what gender you're sleeping with, but I'm also not someone who's looking for my PCP to be my best friend and be warm and cuddly. I value knowledge, the ability to explain something in a way I can understand, and someone who admits when they don't know something far more than bedside manner.   That said, I think that the medical community in the south probably isn't the best equipped to handle a trans individual, I'm sure pronouns would get confusing during an exam and I'd be curious to know exactly how much training Med Schools do now dealing with trans pts.   it's very difficult to speak out and say something   You're paying them. They work for you. If you have a problem or if they made you feel uncomfortable, remember that, and then bring it up to them. You should leave an MD's office absolutely clear on your diagnosis (or what steps they are taking to make one) and treatment and how it affects you. Too many people have this thing about their MD being intimidating, and not wanting to look stupid/complain so questions go unanswered and things never get fixed. I'm not saying you should complain about the temperature of the office or something like that, but if it's a legitimate issue, you should bring it up and if you doc isn't receptive then it's time to find a new one."

No Panera, no Starbucks, no Publix.  We do have some great local businesses like Ugly Mugs and Sip and Village Pub, but just about every restaurant is a fucking ""experience."" We desperately need some quick, healthy food options that aren't 100% employed by people with bong resin for brain material.  We also have aggravated assault Kroger (Eastland), larceny Kroger (Hart Lane/Greenfield) and triple-homicide Wal-Mart ""Neighborhood"" store. I think there's a Piggly Wiggly somewhere and a creepy-ass Aldi (they're ALL creepy... so many off-brands... and they don't give you bags for your groceries, wtf?!) and probably a half-dozen ""craft grocery"" places where you can get $10 tomatoes.

I'm not anti-chain, don't get me wrong. If EN had a chipotle, i'd never fucking leave. I agree with a lot of restaurants being geared towards an ""experience"" it's annoying, and a lot of them are really damn expensive. I've never had a sketchy experience at either kroger, won't goes to wal-mart because fuck wal-mart. Aldi fucking rules man, they have cheap items that are just the same in taste/quality most of the time. There are some things I wouldnt' get there, but they are solid. Owned by Trader Joe's, in fact, if that makes you feel better. They don't give you bags because it encourages you to be more environmentally friendly and makes their check-out process more efficient, which is what a shit ton of german companies are all about. Payday lending places are such a problem. They wouldn't be in business though if laws exists to ban them or if people didn't use them. I want them gone as well."

Like, if you just want a good, quick healthy salad, I have no idea where the fuck to go. Or just a good sandwich (other than Mitchell's)? Pharmacy is fun and all, but the waits there are often ludicrous. Hell, we could barely get into Rosepepper on Saturday... and they're merely decent.  Aldi is great for what it is, and I get what they're doing. But you wouldn't find a single person in the entire universe who would choose Aldi over Trader Joe's.  Gallatin is a serious eyesore though and I'm not even sure what could be done to beautify it at this point. Dickerson Pike actually has far more potential in my mind, if there ends up being enough interest."

The salads at the wild cow are pretty awesome too. Yeah, East Nashville seems to have more expensive restaurants than reasonably priced ones, and once you've hit them all, EN seems way smaller. have you eaten at calypso cafe or piped piper? they have pretty affordable and decent tasting food. Calypso, i'd say is above decent.   so you want gallatin to turn into one giant stretch that looks like hillsboro village? i don't think it's that bad."

I just want it to have a good grocery store (I'll take Publix or Trader Joe's) and better food options. If the only way to do that is through chains, so be it. I'm fine with local shops too, though they tend to have shitty hours.  East Nashville to me is very good, but not great -- yet.

And Mitchell's has great sandwiches, but they're fucking huge and expensive and the place gets way overcrowded at times. I already eat there too often.  I'm talking cheap, quick-hit places to get food at that aren't ""fast food."" Elliston Place has a Fresh to Order. I'd love one of those, or some sort of salad/soup place.   As cool as East Nashville is (and I mean that sincerely, I do like living here), I can't tell you how many times my girlfriend and I can't figure out where to get food because nothing appeals to us.

For me to change the job posting (to a lower position), it would take about 2 weeks of internal re-approvals. And a bunch of questions about ""is this another position? Did finance approve this headcount?"". It's easier to tell HR to find lesser experienced candidates, in hopes you stumble on the one you wanted in the first place.

A couple of the candidates share roughly the same position on a number of the major issues and they're hard to tell apart based on the limited information presented on a few of the other sites I've seen.  This goes a little deeper, beyond the basic talking points, and helped me to differentiate between the candidates and understand their positions to greater depth."

nashville,3dt6k8,WCC335,9,Sun Jul 19 15:49:52 2015 UTC,"David Fox.  We've seen two potential paths for Nashville over the past few decades; become like Atlanta, with a subpar road network, subpar public transit, and relatively little homegrown culture, or become like Chicago with functioning infrastructure but a downwards spiral of debt leading inexorably to a default.  Scylla and Charybdis are alive and kicking, it seems. But Odysseus managed to come out relatively unscathed. Can Nashville?  The three biggest issues the next mayor will have to focus on are education, transit, and growth, all while preventing Nashville from losing its way, or its wallet.  David Fox was a very successful Metro Nashville Public Schools chairman, who oversaw a moderate implementation of charter schools to supplement the ailing system while improving many of the schools around the city. He wants to continue to use charter schools as a tool and as a laboratory to improve the public school system, rather than extricate them entirely or rely on them exclusively.  He initially supported the AMP project, and worked to try and make it a reality, but prefers a larger network that incorporates such areas as Bellevue and Donelson rather than focusing all the transit growth along West End.  Nashville is growing, but growth does have its downsides. Rapid population growth taxes our already aging basic infrastructure networks. Our roads may be the most noticeable symptom, but rapid growth is likewise affecting our electrical, water, and sewer networks, all of which were designed to handle a much smaller city. While some candidates (most notably Howard Gentry) want to continue the focus on large projects (a new Titans stadium, for example), David Fox is the only candidate to take a strong stand on basic infrastructure. One of my favorite moments of this election was when he said that, if elected mayor, he'd like the David Fox Memorial Sewer Pipe to be his legacy.  Nashville also has to find a way to pay for our recent growth. That'll involve raising taxes and reducing spending to some extent, or at least reducing the overall deficit. Otherwise, Nashville will begin to take on more and more debt that we cannot sustain--and if making payments on our debt becomes a large portion of Nashville's spending down the road, we will lose in the long-run. David Fox not only has the most financial experience of any candidate (he was a partner at a hedge fund after leaving MNPS), he also has come out hard against profligate spending.  Hope this helps!"

He supports charter schools as a supplement to the existing system, as a way to see what can be improved.  Just because a Koch-funded Super PAC backs someone doesn't mean they're connected. Especially since David Fox has repudiated some of the tactics used by said PAC against Linda Eskind Rebrovick.  And yes, taxes will almost certainly need to be raised if we want to pay for infrastructure improvements."
nashville,3dt6k8,Odpipe,2,Tue Jul 21 21:02:35 2015 UTC,"Hedge funds helped put us into the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.  Charter schools are just a no-go for myself and a lot of folks in Nashville.  You're naive if you think a Koch PAC would support a candidate that they're not connected to.  And no, they won't need to necessarily be raised. Rising property values = rising tax revenue, which is why we haven't had a tax increase in years.  Fox is fighting in the trenches with Rebrovick to see who can finish last."
nashville,3dt6k8,illimitable1,0,Sun Jul 19 17:02:55 2015 UTC,I really like this response. The idea that the Koch brothers want Fox to win simply means that I want someone else to win. What we don't need is ANY Koch brother influence in Nashville.

nashville,3dt6k8,Kaarboer,2,Mon Jul 20 12:25:21 2015 UTC,"I saw something different. He seems to be into privatizing significant parts of government services and reducing taxes. If that's not so, where did I go wrong?"
nashville,3dt6k8,FucktheNapkin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:37:50 2015 UTC,"I've been to a few campaign events and never heard him mention privatization. He may have mentioned public-private partnerships, though."
nashville,3dt6k8,phyloh,4,Mon Jul 20 04:28:38 2015 UTC,"I think it must be that he's known for outsourcing the janitorial work at Nashville schools while he was on the board.  The Scene continued: ""The notion of public-private partnerships shows up elsewhere in Fox's vision. In transit, for instance, he says Nashville (and surrounding areas) should pursue a European model: a private company builds a regional transit system, and municipalities lease it, charging a user fee that — if the math is done right — can cover the city's cost.""  Whatever the case may be, I got a distinct tea-party, libertarian, cut the taxes, scale back government services, use free markets to get better efficiency vibe out of what I read in his profile in the Scene. I like his stance on transit and infrastructure, and if he really did believe in raising taxes to pay for better services, I would support him in that.   Unfortunately, I'm not clear that he really wants these things. He thinks we're too far in debt, which I take to mean that he'd bring austerity measures to bear. Because most public infrastructure projects are expensive, and the cost has to be amortized, I don't see how his concern with debt is consonant with more spending on infrastructure. I do appreciate his willingness to raise taxes, but many of the things we need cannot be bought in a single year's budget, no matter how much we tax ourselves.  I also think that government is so unlike business in its purpose that his appeals to being businesslike are unfortunate. Government is not here to be merely efficient or to break even, but rather to work for the common good through a political process. Business does not prepare a person for that role.  He also likes charter schools like a bee likes honey. I find that off-putting. He was sued for being a part of a possibly racist rezoning scheme enacted while he was on the school board.   I like his emphasis on spreading development around evenly so that not only downtown benefits. I like what he says he wants in terms of transit, though I think there's a conflict here with his fiscal position. I like that, at least in the Scene, he mentioned that we incarcerate people at too high a rate. But I have other concerns that I've mentioned."

Freeman has been promising the world to a bunch of groups (which explains his endorsements), every candidates forum I've seen he talks about how he would fund everything more, and though it's against state law wants to almost double minimum wage. Now, I'm for more money for low income workers, but I don't see how a one county increase would do anything but drive business to ring counties.

He didn't support it in the beginning, but changed his mind.  For the record, I think it's a good idea. Low income workers spend a higher percentage of their wages in their local community.

I'm in support of a minimum wage increase, but not one that's so much it'll affect the rest of us financially. You go making a 40-50% hike in minimum wage and EVERYTHING becomes more expensive.

Freeman is the one who first brought up increasing minimum wage and Barry followed. Just like she follows as a councilwoman. She isn't leading, she just votes with what's popular. We need someone who doesn't have a political agenda, who can make the tough decisions and won't care if their image is tarnished when they run for office again. Bill Freeman won't run for another political office position. This is it for him. I like that.   Barry is a career politician who looks at the mayors office as a stepping stone to her next job. She's made plenty of promises she won't keep. More importantly, Nashville needs a smart businessman in office. Somebody who understands growth and understands how to make things happen."

nashville,3dsn73,shortmonkey757,3,Sun Jul 19 01:53:03 2015 UTC,"You can find roommates in Brentwood from time to time. There are ""hidden"" duplexes that have a single front door so they look like a regular house scattered around. But since it more of a family area, there aren't many single people looking to share. I know because I tried to rent out a room there years ago and it took me months to find someone willing to live in Brentwood."
nashville,3dsn73,parawing742,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:19:39 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. If something comes through I will take it.

Brentwood is a suburb for upper middle class families that live in houses, not people who are looking for roommates. I could see why you'd look for a roomie in the Nashville area so you can commute to Brentwood, but I honestly don't know of good places to get anything other than a house a or maybe a condo in Brentwood. I'm also assuming a lot about you, so correct me if I'm completely off.  Source: I am a Brentwood fat cat."

nashville,3dvia9,ruuustin,-4,Tue Jul 21 12:57:24 2015 UTC,"No, of course not. But if you compare Nashville to a city like New York or Chicago, they have a much longer history of being mixed areas with large populations. Nashville is in transition. Sure, there are people who are relatively urban and rightly so. But I'm saying, due to its regional prominence, Nashville has a higher proportion of non-urbanites than other cities."
nashville,3dvia9,lawndart471,2,Mon Jul 20 02:21:55 2015 UTC,"Maybe part of its ""allure"" is that its is NOT New York or Chicago. Its funny, because those people (and LA, San Francisco, and a couple other places) are all moving here, not staying there. Why? If those places are so great?"

nashville,3dvia9,TrustMeImLeifEricson,10,Mon Jul 20 17:24:05 2015 UTC,"I was not expecting such blind dogmatism and nationalistic sentiment in Nashville's Reddit.   TL;DR: Oh, bless your heart...  First, weird word choice there.  Where the heck did ""nationalistic"" come from?  I think a lot of the ""dogmatism"" in the form of ""don't let the door hit you on the ass on your way out"" comes from your admitted lack of familiarity with the town.  Like you said, you've lived here for all of a year and don't seem to really know what you're talking about.    Second, it's not that you're wrong, you're just an asshole [or come off that way].  Even though some of your points and characterizations are wildly inaccurate, most people who've lived in cities/towns of various sizes have probably dealt with some variation of what you were trying to articulate.  Yes, our city is designed a little weird, but that's more of a Southern thing.  In contrast to NYC, DC, or other cities that were initially laid out where space was a concern, many Southern cities were designed with the ""screw it, there's plenty of space to grow"" mentality.  It's a little late for us to get too bent out of shape about it.  At least Old Hickory is less confusing than ""Peachtree"" is in Atlanta.   But a lot of the things you're complaining about, aren't our fault.  Being at the intersection of major freeways and a hub for tourism brings the consequence of lots of tourists or people who aren't familiar with our city.  And as much as we love taking their hard earned vacation money, it means we have to put up with their BS a lot of the time, which often includes them standing in the wrong places, taking photos of everything, and being generally inconvenient.  I would complain about this crap all the time when I lived in DC, but I also realized that was just the nature of the town.  For someone as well traveled as you present yourself, you seemed to disregard this rather significant factor.  Surely you encountered that in your stays in NYC and Chicago.    Third, where you lost the sympathy of the crowd was calling those folks hillbillies.  And by calling us hillbillies, too.  Contrary to being home to the world's largest ball of twine, Nashville has a history of education, arts, and entertainment as significant industries.  We do have that whole ""Athens of the South"" thing.  Heck, Nashville even gave Oprah a college education and her first big break.  What greater gift to the world could we give?   Finally, the good news.  You're here now.  Which means that you can be part of the fixing these problems.  If you don't like the infrastructure, the lighting, the bike lines, you should get involved.  Get your neighbors involved.    It's going to be a long, hot summer, my friend.  Ice down some beers, make a julep, throw something on the grill, and chill out.  Oh, and Gold Bond.  You'll thank me later."
nashville,3dvia9,-packrat,-2,Mon Jul 20 04:54:52 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right. I'm here. I'm a tax-paying, voting citizen. I am part of Nashville whether others like it or not."
nashville,3dvia9,pistashley_O,8,Mon Jul 20 17:29:36 2015 UTC,"I have these thoughts sometimes, when my mindset is that of an arrogant and self-deluded cunt. Like you, OP, I come from culture and education and global travel and speaking with proper, accentless diction. I'm a denizen of the city, I've got street smarts, I've proven myself to be physically tough, I know how things work and can use logic and critical thinking to figure out new concepts when I see them. Like you, OP, I am clearly the Übermensch, yet cursed to deal with the simple-minded plebeians of the South. Oh, the agony.   But let's disengage Holden Caulfield mode and act like the flawed humans we actually are. It's true, different people come from different backgrounds that offer different life experiences. I was born to most of my advantages, and not everyone has had opportunities to excel at life. Some people are/become smarter than others, or are more skilled at a specific thing, or are more experienced. Does that make them better than anyone else? I'm not some omniscient, divine being capable of making such an objective judgement. You aren't either.   Honestly, I think you're full of yourself and don't even realize it. I get frustrated with people that seem stupid from my point of view (people like you, Cocrates), but I try and I pray to remember that many other people hold that view of me, and since I would want those people to treat me with patience and kindness in spite of my glaring ignorance, I need to do the same to others, especially when I don't know a thing about them or their life experiences. You are where you are in life due to cosmic luck, and your good fortune could change at any second. Don't forget that.  Two bits of advice come to mind:   ""Treat others in the way you want to be treated."" Whatever level of religiosity you adhere to, doing this frequently will make your life better. ""Be kind, for everyone is fighting a battle."" That older lady that's taking too long to cross the intersection? She's remembering an accident that seriously injured her father and is being cautious. Or perhaps she's distracted by wondering how she's going to deal with the bills from a necessary medical procedure that she just doesn't have the money to cover. Or maybe she's just off the bus (much like you) and just doesn't know where she's going. It's also possible that she literally sees something you don't.   TL;DR Be patient with people, especially when you're frustrated with them. Others have done the same for you and you'll never know it."

Hattie B's - hot chicken (but they have tame options too)  Edley's BBQ - maybe not germaphobe friendly   Baja Burrito/Mas Tacos/Taco Mamasita/Local Taco - Mexican food, but Nashville has a huge Mexican population, so it's not like Mexican food and Nashville food are exclusive.   M.L. Rose - has some spicy food on the menu   Monell's - family-style (sit a a 12-person table, pass around delicious southern food.)   Food Trucks - maybe not germaphobe friendly, and they don't provide seating, but there might be picnic tables nearby where you might have to share.   Now that I think about it, most of the ""Nashville"" places would easily fall foul of his requirements. I think he's probably enjoy Franklin places more. They generally appeal to an older clientele, so alcohol selections would be more limited.   Loveless Cafe  55 South   Red Pony   Puckett's   Etc.   Someone also mentioned the newer places on ""the gulch"" which he might like, but also not very ""Nashville."" These places would all be near the "" Biscuit Love"" restaurant.  Edit - more upscale options might be right up yall's alley.   City House   Rolf & Daughters   Butcher Town Hall   Silo   Etch   Mad Platter   Husk   Burger Up"

Hermitage Steak House is my best suggestion."
nashville,3dtka7,TrustMeImLeifEricson,3,Sun Jul 19 14:19:47 2015 UTC,Go to Rolf and Daughters. Best restaurant in Nashville. It's comparable to Publican or Longman.

Etch and The Southern are close to each other and nearer to downtown. Both can be pretty expensive, so consider a drink and app at each.   If you feel like taking a 30 minute drive one day, try Burger Shack for a delicious  In-N-Out style experience.  Also, find a way to include a trip to Prince's. If you ask me, it's an essential part of any kind of Nashville food tour."

There of course are pockets of progressives in Nashville but more so in the ATX (even though it is Texas)  I've seen people dressed in nothing but a speedo riding a bike in Austin, that wouldn't fly in Nash. There are no Hippy Hollows or topless sunbathing at the spring. There are not as many churches and there are more out and about fabulous people in Austin.  I expect the cost of living to be at or near Austin within 2 years. The ATX is more bike friendly and public transport is better (there seems to be more convenient routes) and you will definitely need a car in Nashville.    That's just my two cents.

Assigning your own fears and own misgivings about someone who says they own or carry a gun is, in my opinion, no different than judging someone by how they look, how their name is pronounced, their religion, or even the color of their skin. You know nothing about me, or people like me, beyond your own prejudicial view.  Do you feel unsafe around Law Enforcement, Security, and/or military personnel? They all often carry... openly, at that.  Nice name-calling too... Often resorted when one can't come up with an intelligent point to debate.  Tell the enforcer thing to the Anaheim Ducks. They just signed McGrattan who was the last real enforcer the Predators had. Weber and Fisher fill that role now, but they need to stay on the ice."
nashville,3dnesn,lawndart471,0,Sat Jul 18 16:53:40 2015 UTC,"Buddy, referencing a movie isn't exactly name calling? Enforcers bounce around the NHL all the time because no team actually needs them, and if you think that Weber and Fisher are enforcers you're being ridiculous. Enforcers are players who aren't really good at hockey, they're players who are used specifically for fighting, which is useless in today's NHL. (BTW Clune was an enforcer as well, good try though) Also, I do feel safe around cops/military personnel because it's a part of their job to have guns. A civilian with a gun is far different than a cop/military person. And let's be clear here, I'm all for wanting to own a gun and keep it in your home for protection, but I think wanting to carry it around with you for your ""safety"" deserves a negative connotation."

My wife is visibly foreign (she's korean) while i'm a hispanic caucasian (i can go undercover until people hear my very hispanic name). She gets stares, though she's very pretty, so that might have more to do with it too. Less so next to Vanderbilt, more so outside of there and in the outer areas/cities (murfreesboro, franklin, etc).  People in Nashville in the hipster areas and near the universities seem very liberal and friendly, and that's ok with us. Being a first-timer in the south, I must say that all the people we've encountered are unfailingly polite and friendly. I can't speak directly to alternative lifestyles, but near Vanderbilt and the downtown area there is a strong LGBT community. 45 minutes outside of nashville, there are events that raise eyebrows but hey, there are nutters everywhere, including in LA and NY. Tennessee and Nashville are low on the diversity ladder, but the immigrant population has been growing, accounting for 3/5ths of the population growth in recent years.  Having been here for less than a month, Nashville seems like a vibrant, liberal, and diversifying town (in a conservative state) with lots of young people doing lots of different things, and people really do love this city. we don't feel out of place here, and while i might miss afghani brunches, tamal dinners, or the 4 am last call you might get in NYC, there's some great restaurants and bars that wouldn't be out of place in venice beach or williamsburg.

Would you consider Chicago, New York, or LA ""normal""? By all accounts, those are very diverse, liberal cities.  This is sort of what I meant earlier when I said to someone else that I can't understand for the life of me why people leave a place (ostensibly because they believe they will have better opportunity/more happiness elsewhere), but then spend their time either trying to change or comparing what they believe are shortcomings of the new place."

OP was concerned about whether Nashville is progressive. I'm from Chicago and the point I was trying to make is that East Nashville ""feels like"" other urban liberal neighborhoods in other cities, but the rest of Nashville does not.  I love Nashville btw and I'm not trying to change it and the shortcomings here are the same as the ones I didn't like in Chicago.  The biggest difference in ""feel"" though for me is that when I left my ""hip"" neighborhood in Chicago the rest of the city still felt like the same city.

A good chunk of reproductive rights have been lost recently here as well as a bunch of other places. That said - there's a new SURJ (standing up for racial justice) group here pretty active right now and some great groups doing crucial work (Open Table, Workers' Dignity). There's Nashville feminist collective (monthly trivia nights, lots of reading groups and activism branching off of it - the calendar is intense) I am sometimes overwhelmed with love for the people I know who are doing hard difficult thankless work, and I think the south is a really important place for various types of this work in particular (wage theft, worker protections, racial justice), it's why I came back here after college and grad school.

Lots of younger people are going to college which means less of us going and getting into the construction trades.   I'm in an apprenticeship program right now that goes for 5 years. You get training both in class and on the job. Paid and benefitted fairly with your pay rate increasing as you finish more and more of the schooling.   Its a pretty good over all program.   So I'd say check into contruction. Of course you'll be doing more physically demanding stuff but the prerequisites shouldn't be too high to not get into and you can make some good money doing it.  EDIT: I've had a couple people message me and reply to this comment with some interest in how to get into such an apprenticeship. You can go to this website to get more info and the number to call and get more info that way if you'd like. This is an apprenticeship for the electrician/electrical side of construction, but there are many other trades out there such as a brick mason, insulator, pipefitter, etc. etc. that all have some form of apprenticeship that you can get into.   http://www.nejatc.org  One other thing that I should probably note is the apprenticeship is done in partnership with a Union. So if you have any sort of political issues with being part of a Union you may want to keep that in mind. That said, the IBEW (the union that this apprenticeship works with) is a pretty solid one. A bunch of the guys on the job site gathered up money to help me pay for my insurance deductible a while back when I hit a deer. The guys in the Union all treat and see each other as brothers and will help you like one when you need it. Of course, there are a few bad apples but as long as you are cool with everyone they'll be cool with you.

nashville,3dkl3b,NashvilleRedditors,8,Fri Jul 17 00:52:32 2015 UTC,"I attended the mayoral forum where downtown businesses were invited to ask questions. One of the questions out of the fish bowl was concerning Williamson County and how they are at 90% capacity for grade A office space. They are having a major push to build more office buildings and the question pertained to how that will affect Nashville's plans to compete since many of the buildings downtown are class B or C.   He didn't try to answer the question and only said ""I don't care what happens in Williamson, I only care about Nashville."" ( not verbatim, but pretty darn close )  How can a leader not care about what happens in surrounding areas? I saw it as very short-sighted and thought it revealed an unwillingness to work with others.   As an aside, Barry and Bone were the only ones with facts and numbers to back up their answers which were very thorough.   Kane kept mentioning his wife, and seemed like a really nice guy but didn't come across as having the experience to be a mayor of a city this size.  I was waiting for Rebrovick to say ""synergy"" at any moment.  Fox looked really uncomfortable since it was in the convention center and he didn't vote for it. He kept mentioning his experience as superintendent of schools. All I know is Overton High School smells like piss all the time and is falling apart and has a 2-3 out of 10 rating.  It seemed Gentry was banking on Eddie George as his treasurer to get him ahead. His answer to revitalizing the Nashville Speedway was to bring in a rodeo. What?  Sorry for the wall of text. Just wanted to share my observation of what I got out of the mayoral forums I have attended."

He has spoken a lot about the meeting with the director of the school board down there as well as other business leaders, but his focus is on Nashville getting jobs, better schools, and more affordable housing.   The idea there is Nashville paid for the airport, the stadium, the parks, the convention center...and when people leave Nashville for better school of Williamson county, they still benefit. Very few people fly to Nashville to visit Brentwood, but Brentwood benefits from everything we do.   That's what he was talking about. Not that he doesn't care, but Williamson county isn't his focus."

nashville,3dkl3b,a3akbari,3,Fri Jul 17 04:22:32 2015 UTC,"I've met all the candidates personally and I like him and Megan Barry.  I don't care that he has a sig. investment in check cashing businesses bc I don't think that will influence his decision making as mayor - It's definitely not his primary investment/venture.  He, like Barry, is genuinely interested in diversity and that's one reason I like him.  I think his history as a successful commercial developer is why he's most prepared to tackle the growing pains nashville is going through.  Commercial real estate is a very tough field to understand and has a lot of moving parts.. For me, it boils down to I trust Freeman to be inclusive and smart  about our tax dollars.  I don't have anything negative to say about Barry, matter fact, she's awesome too, but I think Freeman being personally successful will mean he'll owe less favors and has a proven track record of understanding Nashville's development.  Uniquely capable."

nashville,3dkl3b,phyloh,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:55:07 2015 UTC,"For me, it's Barry, Bone, Freeman. Gentry could conceivably win me over, but I'm not convinced so far.  Barry has the experience, is probably closest to Dean, but probably also more liberal (which I say as neither a plus nor a minus, necessarily). She hasn't spoken as well at times as I'd like to have seen from her during debates and I'm a bit surprised she isn't polling better (if any of the internal polls are to be believed).  Bone, to me, is probably the smartest of the candidates. Dude has a command of the issues and sounds great on a stage (both style and substance). He's also an attorney (again, not necessarily good or bad). He's also running a pretty subpar campaign, though, so I'm not sure about his chances.  Freeman is a longtime politico with money and influence, which can be good or bad. He's got connections and I've liked his answers on some of the issues. He's also a developer and investor in check cashing/cash advance businesses and I have questions about some of the folks on his campaign (who are likely to run the city if he wins).  Gentry... I don't feel that he's particularly serious so far. He got into it late and hasn't seemed to have done much. I also question his grasp of the city's current issues since his big focus is on crime. It's like... the easy answer when you're running for office (I WILL LOWER CRIME!!!), but ignores the fact that crime is on the decline and other issues are probably a bigger priority (growth and planning, transit, etc.).  Rebrovick is like the Shingy of this race. Hard to take her seriously.  Kane is a charter school guy, so that disqualifies him for me.  Fox is a conservative backed by out-of-state PACs, including one tied to the Koch Brothers. Nuff said.  So, again, for me it's Barry, Bone and Freeman that I'm mulling over at this point."

We will open for the 2015 blueberry picking season on Wednesday, July 1.  Our hours will be from 7 am until noon each Wednesday and each Saturday in the month of July, and possibly during the first week of August.  Since July 4 is a Saturday, we will be open regular hours on this day.  We are a pick your own farm, and there are no pre-picked blueberries available.  You may pick your own blueberries for $3.00 each pound, and we never use pesticides on our blueberries.  We are located at 4080 Clovercroft Road in Franklin, TN.  Our driveway is just past the stoplight at the corner of Clovercroft Rd and Oxford Glenn Drive.  We hope to see you soon!"

nashville,3djwch,Secretskeptsecretly,3,Thu Jul 16 21:31:44 2015 UTC,Where are you coming from? A romanticized cabin with a hot tub is usually something that goes along with mountains and those are about 3 hours east in Gatlinburg / Townsend / Pigeon Forge. There are lots of cabins over there and they are completely awesome and well worth it.   I'm sure you could find what you are looking for but IMHO it would hurt your Nashville exp. Just stay in the city at a hotel or AirBnB and enjoy the city and head east for a Cabin. In early November the foliage of the Smokies is wonderful.

Here, pee in this cup"". They tried to 'guarantee' what sounded like a guess.   When I called to receive my results by phone, I specifically inquired about the test they said existed, and I was assured it was tested for, and all was well. I called them twice to confirm this....  Except, such a test does not actually exist. (Verified through research and other medical professionals).  Also during my visit, they assigned someone else to my exam room (was walked in on). Simple mistake, sure, but with everything else, this left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth as it could've been a lot worse and seemed unorganized.   If you're just interested in b-12 shots, then you've found a great establishment, though. I saw at least 2 people in and out within 5 minutes for those."

nashville,3dfxea,illimitable1,2,Thu Jul 16 18:30:47 2015 UTC,"You might consider buying, as $1500/month in mortgage can get you a whole lot more than renting.

I am sorry I can't be more helpful. I don't know those complexes, but I do have friends that live in some near us (there are a lot near Edmonson/OHB) that like the area a lot."

Thank you!"
nashville,3dfxea,Highball2814,0,Thu Jul 16 01:04:55 2015 UTC,"Smart, in regards to buying. Edmonson and Old Hickory Blvd. is a nice area and has decent apartments, though I don't know prices. You are 4-8 minutes from 65 and 24. Depending on the time of day your boyfriend has to be at work, the commute might not be too bad. I lived in Bellevue 20 years ago. It just feels remote. Getting to Brentwood takes you through some of the only sections of Old Hickory that are still 2-lane (mostly due to old Forest Hills money blocking any attempt at widening).  I just looked at a map and The Preserve at Brentwood is very close to me. If you can afford them, it's a decent locale.  Wynton Pointe is a little further from the 65 corridor and a little bit sketchier. I don't know where you live in Memphis and how comfortable you are. I lived off Nolensville Road for 11 years. The area I was in was slowly but steadily declining. Nolensville Road/OHB is a far cry from the worst parts of town, but they aren't the best either.  Legacy Hill would be my second choice, based solely on location. You could take Charlotte downtown.  Carrington Hills is in a nice place, but the commute might get downright brutal.  Again, value this advice at what you paid for it. This is coming from a 43-year old dad of 2. I'm at a different stage of life than you. These are ranked as to where I would want to live if I had a downtown job.   The Preserve Legacy Hill Carrington Hills Wynton Pointe Bellevue Preserve"

nashville,3df73j,MetricT,3,Wed Jul 15 20:35:25 2015 UTC,"For 2), the temperature in the winter here is more variable than you are used to because we don't have a nearby ocean to moderate our weather.  I've seen it be 70 F in December, and -10 F in January.  You will need a range of clothing to be comfortable on any given day.  Autumn in Tennessee lasts until the week of Thanksgiving.  I don't know why the weather transitions so abruptly and consistently that time of year, but you can almost set your watch by it.  November and December are the two rainiest months of the year.   If you are from the Pacific Northwest, you will feel right at home those two months.  January and February are mixed.   Most years we only get one decent snow, but every few years you can expect to be trapped at home for large portions of the month (I bought a Subaru with snow tires because I was tired of being marooned the winter of 2010/2011.   Had a couple of normal years, then again this winter it was a constant barrage of snow/ice.)  Tennessee drivers simply can not drive on snow, yet still try to anyway, with predictable results.  My Subaru with snow tires drives fine on ice, I literally couldn't make it slide in several dozen attempts on solid ice, but it was still no match for a moron riding down the middle of the road who wouldn't/couldn't get out of the way, and so I ended up in a ditch to avoid a wreck, and having to drive across someone's yard to get back on the road.  Consequently you should have a cache of food, water, cooking stove (you can get butane stove for $20 at Wal-Mart) and anything else you might need sufficient to last a week or two with no power.  For 3) Bicycles here are a form of recreation, not transportation.  They're completely fine in area parks, otherwise you are very much taking your life in your own hands.  As it turns out, Tennessee drives can not drive on dry, bare pavement either."

Would love to see it laid out in a way the flows chronologically and logically rather than the cluttered 'granny's basement' we currently have at TPAC.  Given all the memory-holing that we're currently doing regarding southern history, it's important to invest in preserving our state's history (good and bad) in a museum even as we discuss digging up bodies of people we no longer like and removing uncomfortable moments built by past generations who held different values.  This isn't a boondoggle like Ghost Ballet (aka the broken roller coaster), investing in a state museum is a way of preserving our history and providing a free, accessible educating experience to adults and children alike.   It provides a unique sense of place, history and heritage that's very distinct from national history and easily lost in the broad strokes of 'big' history and   popular narratives."

You can rationalize it however you want, if schools are the last priority in the present then we will fail at running an efficient, functional government in the future.  this project is not privately funded. it's ""lets get some private money together so we can put that label on it and sell it as a success of private money, but really we are mostly spending public money to get this built."" it's gonna be built on state land. this is a PUBLIC PROJECT w/ corporate sponsors (TN History brought to you by Pilot Fuel).  for christ sakes, TN gave more money to Volkswagon ($300 million) just to prevent them from unionizing.

nashville,3dap0m,mechanicalpulse,0,Wed Jul 15 18:19:16 2015 UTC,"i've had this very same argument before. i really don't understand how anyone think schools getting more money each year implies they are getting enough money. underfunded is underfunded, no matter how much more they are getting this year than last.  More money spent on schools each year =/= more money spent on education than the other socialized programs.  show me those numbers for the budgets for Dept of Corrections, Dept of Safety, and TDOT. compare and contrast the results. you'll see how Family Services and Education get the smallest slices of the pie.  Besides, those increases in cost can be entirely attributed to the additional layer of testing standards and the adjustments to the educational programs that were required by those tests. Tests that have not been proven to work by any measure that isn't proprietary and owned by the private education industry.  No pure money doesn't equate with better students, but less students per class does, better equipped students do better, better teachers do and students that are falling behind can benefit from extra lessons.   Furthermore, more money would allow schools to bring on better facilitation staff, like therapists, planners, assistants, and family educational coaches which would allow teachers to focus on teaching and not having to fulfill the roles that the administration, in all it's wisdom, has required be done, but is powerless to do.  in the very least, one should acknowledge that even though we've spent more and more on Dept of Safety and Dept of Corrections, we haven't seen ANY reduction in crime or the number of incarcerated criminals. so i can offer that as proof that spending additional money in those areas is WASTED."
nashville,3dap0m,aDDnTN,3,Wed Jul 15 18:33:18 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry; you appear to have misconstrued my comment as suggesting that there was somehow ""enough"" funding for education.  Education could always use more funding.  Teachers are underpaid and schools are underfunded.  Chronically.  The simple reality is that there's only so much money and there are many needs.  A museum is educational, albeit less automatic than some more lazy, free-range parents would prefer.  I don't particularly care to argue with people on the internet.

First though, two state agencies would have to talk to each other; one miracle at a time.

Foggy Bottom *personal favorite |  Adventures on the Harpeth |  Tip-A-Canoe |   If you brought your own gear, you can find a drop point on the Harpeth since it's public property.  The 5 Spot and East Nashville in general will be a safe haven from country music. It's also has a great bar scene if you don't mind the smoke.  I'd also check out these other venues and see what's on their calendars. Most of the country music will be in the bars downtown.  The End - local or very small touring acts |  The Basement & The Basement East - usually local stuff |  Exit/In - up and comers |  Marathon Music Works - more established acts  Another good spot is Acme. It's downtown, but it's usually a local hang. If you're staying through the weekend, definitely check it out. They might have a ticketed show on the third floor and most likely will have a DJ up on the rooftop.  Enjoy your time in Nashville!  edit - formatting"
nashville,3dbuf4,ImProbablyOnAList,18,Wed Jul 15 01:36:18 2015 UTC,"I've been here all my life, and I'm puzzling over this question.  Planners make decisions behind the scenes to alter the flow and cadence of life.  People now get to ""live over the shop"", like was normal a hundred years ago (""mixed use"").  Tax codes are written to encourage some business models and discourage others.  Certain things like public art and fireworks and festivals are interspersed in the city calendar to attract the type of young person who will spend at the Chamber of Commerce partner venues.  Crime has to be strictly held below a certain level to have new businesses come in and put a corporate office here--the kind that has a bunch of six figure jobs attached to it, rather than rebuilding industrial goods at minimum wage with all sorts of chances of industrial pollution--The Marta Program, and the clean Air Board of the 1960s are part of that. People are trying to nudge the quality of public education higher, although we have some nice magnet schools and a few universities right now.  East Nashville, where I am from, has a new vibe that puts it on some invisible high-bandwidth telegraph line with Portland and San Francisco and Austin and NY...There's this whole eatwell/drinkwell/create/playlistentogreatlocalmusic thing.  The city keeps emphasizing diversity--one of the blue dots in a traditional red state. We've got a TV show named after us, like Dallas (showing my age) so people come with ideas of greatness from personal recommendations or crafted on a screen.   Some of it is having chips fall the right way--no water rationing for us on the Cumberland, no crippling exodus--but a lot of it is canny planning, IMHO, and I'm not smart enough to see more than the edges.  I worked on 12th when it was a down at the heels warehouse district.  I would have never predicted people would want to live in a high rise within the old Marshall and Bruce/Fehr Block/Javanco footprint.  Where do you park?!? It doesn't seem to matter to the next generation.  Turnip Truck in the Old Ash-McNeil welding building in the gulch--and Cox body shop out East long before that.  Wow, wall of text.  Your question is one I often Zen-Ponder over.  I am continually amazed by the changes in Nashville and strongly believe we have not come to the fastest part of our rollercoaster ride yet."

The head of IT at UBS also said that Nashville is like Seattle was before it got a big IT industry.  If you combine no state income tax, and a ""low"" cost of living (compared to a NY or LA) - it makes business sense for a lot of companies to move their positions here.   With that, I can also say that the pool of talent that currently exists in Nashville for high tech or IT jobs is very small. Most of the hiring I've seen happen is from out of state candidates."
nashville,3dbuf4,lawndart471,2,Wed Jul 15 12:13:47 2015 UTC,"I don't see how Nashville can be the next Silicon Valley.  There are just not a lot of good IT jobs here, and they're mostly healthcare.   There isn't remotely the IT diversity that Silicon Valley has."

It is a really hard time filling anything mid-level network admins to high level-network architects and usually would hire outside the state and relocate or give the option to telecommute.  With that being said - the best option for most any IT folks that are higher level is to find the telecommute jobs out of NYC/SFO that pay those market rates and live in Nashville.  Best of both worlds!   The one part on Nashville's IT is that they try to underpay you compared to most other markets in the country."

I may have the very best IT job in town.    Most Nashville IT is a) Microsoft or b) Java, and largely revolves around healthcare.  We don't have a wide breadth of IT jobs.  What business in town is doing fundamental research that doesn't involve healthcare?  Name the local workplace that is going to attract a Linus Torvalds or Jon Carmack or Michael Abrash or Jack Dongarra due to the caliber of problem its trying to solve?     And Nashville VC's are low-risk and low-imagination.  They can't wrap their heads around truly pathbreaking IT technology and consequently won't fund it (trust me, we've tried and had to go elsewhere...), but I have personally seen them whip out their checkbooks for someone trying to create ""social networking like Facebook, for pets"".  The near-monoculture of jobs (working in Detroit was great, until it wasn't) and the poor VC climate are two reasons why Nashville is in absolutely no danger whatsoever of being the next Silicon Valley.

I was once a lowly pctech/tech support (For Dell in 1999) and the path I've been able to take in Nashville without a degree has turned out better than I ever imagined.

So, he moved to Nashville where he has family and convinced me to give Nashville a shot.   For me, I'm choosing to move here for love and our relationship. It's definitely a change for me but I was pleasantly surprised to find a lot of CA based companies popping up in the area, which makes it feel less foreign. To me, Nashville feels like California minus the beach + weather + traffic + high cost of living. Was happy to see Blaze pizza out there, lol. I hear a Sprouts grocery store is supposed to be coming to Nashville. Anyways, it's nice to see Wes Coast culture in diff parts of the US and I think it'll be nice to have a change. Rest of our friends from TN chose to stay in CA, lol. We're just swapping spots I guess."
nashville,3dbuf4,kimchiandrice,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:06:17 2015 UTC,"As a recent immigrant to Nashville, the reason I came is for a job.  I received a great job offer in the IT field for a VERY large company in Nashville.  We bought a house about 30 minutes outside of the city, so I do contribute to the traffic problem.  But, the cost of living 30 minutes out is very good and I don't mind the drive. Nashville is a great city.  I just hope that city planners can keep up with the growth.  I read on here a lot about the gentrification issue in the city.  I hope something good can be figured out.  Like any growing city, it has a lot of pros and a few cons."

Major industries here are healthcare, education, music -- industries that aren't necessarily recession proof, but are far more stable than manufacturing or construction.  As a result, home prices have skyrocketed, crime has gone down and more businesses are relocating here.  It's boom times, it's an ""it city."""

nashville,3dad3s,nashvillebuyer,3,Tue Jul 14 19:06:37 2015 UTC,"So - if you're looking at the Woodbine map I'm not technically included, but I'm pretty close. I'm sorry, I guess my flair is a lie. But it seems like ""Woodbine"" has grown to include a lot of areas both north and south of its boundaries. So, when you are looking for a place, be looking all around those perimeters because a lot of these neighborhoods have the same vibe. If it was me, I'd be looking south of the fairground but north of the zoo.   It's probably a little safer overall than the east side, or at least the old east side. We have break ins every now and then but getting your lawnmower/shovel stolen out of the backyard is way more common. No one I know in the area has ever been broken into, but my car was rummaged through once, (a somewhat common occurrence in the area).   Depending on where you buy, your neighbors will probably either be Hispanic, recent college grads, or middle aged white folk that really love their 16th District. The middle aged/older residents are good ones to make friends with. They tend to be good about keeping an eye out for suspicious activity/being heavily armed.  Overall, it's a great area. It's cheaper than east side, but probably on the way to having competitive prices. Look out for stupid drivers on Nolensville rd."
nashville,3dad3s,yolo_____swaggins,2,Tue Jul 14 22:39:55 2015 UTC,Look out for stupid drivers on Nolensville rd.   What is it about Nolensville Road? The worst drivers in Nashville.
nashville,3dad3s,WCC335,3,Thu Jul 16 13:05:08 2015 UTC,"I live in the heart of woodbine... just moved here and I love it. A little history... I owned a house in EN for 3 years until I sold it in 2011 (yeah we all make mistakes lol). In my opinion, Woodbine is not only much safer than EN, I predict that in the not so distant future it will be a better investment.   It's significantly more convenient to down town, no bridges or highways, Nolensville pike turns into 4th and 2nd and boom you're down town. Gotta get to west end or hillsboro village? 440 and your there in 5 minutes. Very little traffic at any time since it is so close to everything.   Historically, the area has been mostly hispanic and kurdish. This is indeed changing, but frankly I enjoy living in the area with the most diverse food and culture. Another thing that we considered was the fact that there is very little (if any?) government funded project housing. When it comes to Nashville... that's actually pretty rare. We have't seen or heard of much crime... especially if you compare it to when we lived in EN. The property value isn't where EN or German Town is... for the next 30 seconds. However, it is catching up quickly.  The problem you are going to face is actually finding a place for sale. People here know they have land increasing in value, they don't plan on leaving and have no interest in fighting to find another place. We had to be VERY patient and have high attention on the area, which for living in Nashville for 10 years is just plan weird (once upon a time you couldn't give away land here).  All that to say, we love it! It's the last normal, small community, hard working area near down town. I doubt it will stay that way for long. If you're trying to get in, good luck! It's possible.   If you don't mind me asking, what is your budget and what size place are you looking for?"
nashville,3dad3s,guitarokx,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:41:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply! Looking for a 2bed around $200,000"
nashville,3dad3s,guitarokx,3,Wed Jul 15 16:01:30 2015 UTC,"how much work are you willing to put into it? If you want a ""mild"" fixer upper that is 2 bed 1 bath, it'll be around $160K and 900-1100 sq ft. If you want ""move in ready"" for that size, they are going for around 220K-240K (based on what has recently sold in the last month). My best suggestion is to find a realtor that REALLY knows the area. You will be making an offer on something before it hits the market, otherwise you will find yourself in bidding wars you likely can't win (unless you are able to pay in cash). No matter what the seller agent says.. like, ""we won't accept an official offer for x days"" (yes that is a popula tactic right now to get them into a bidding war).. put a 24 hour response limit on your offer. Reasoning is a little weird but necessary in this market. If they accept... AWESOME! But if they wait for more offers, you can place another offer on another home after 24 hours without being legal bound to the first offer. If after their time period they end up accepting your offer or making a counter, you are in control to accept, counter or deny without legally binding agreements. This is the only way to come close to beating the bidding wars unless you get in before it's on the market.  edit: an no, seller agents NEVER look at the offer expiration right now because they know they can likely accept or counter and you'll be thrilled. If you put multiple offers on the same day, you are in fact legally bound to all of those offers. Source: just went through all this myself :)"
nashville,3dad3s,Nutbrella,2,Wed Jul 15 16:47:34 2015 UTC,"Ideally I'd like a ""move in ready"" situation, but understand that may not be possible. The square footage you mentioned is right in the ball park of what im looking for.  Do you have any suggestion re: realtors? Out of curiosity, did you buy move in or fixer?"
nashville,3dad3s,guitarokx,2,Wed Jul 15 18:01:06 2015 UTC,"Me and my wife just moved into the neighborhood last year. We found a newly renovated 3bed / 2 bath ~2000 square feet for less than 220K.   It's a great neighborhood and it's really coming together.  Everyone in the area wants to see it develop, and we are all doing what we can to make it happen.   Like u/guitarokx mentioned, find a realtor that knows the area well.  We put an offer in on our house the minute it hit the market. We had a good realtor who knew the contractor doing the flip, this let us preview the house before it was for sale, and we a little more faith it wasn't a cheap and quick flip."
nashville,3dad3s,guitarokx,2,Wed Jul 15 19:43:33 2015 UTC,"and to be fair... your price for the house was last year. That house this year is closer to 300K. The market seems to be increasing at around 10K every 3 or 4 months. Which is insane, until you compare it to other places in the area. A 900sqft 2bd 1bath and no renovation just sold for 220K 2 weeks ago... I was shocked. And even more so, in 1 year they will have gotten a great deal."

I know that a new house will be going up soon on Lutie Street near Nolensville rd... but that's probably going to be closer to the 300K range since it is new and likely larger."

Small local businesses like us need to help each other out.  Also, I would suggest joining the NCVC. They are super helpful in introducing you to out of state businesses that have an interest in your business category. Alot of the times, the intro will become a partner or sale. They also give you a good feel for whats happening in the city and gives you access to things like the mayoral forums where local businesses can ask questions directly.  We have been in business for over ten years and I have found these two organizations to be totally invested in helping grow successful small businesses in Nashville.

They found a place that is typically rented out for parties, dances and private events, but they were the first people to book it for a wedding. It could be a long shot, but planning my own wedding taught me that calling a product or service ""wedding ______"" allows you to tack on a higher price tag in general.

nashville,3d6wch,Alexander_Supertramp,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:57:00 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  So... We haven't gotten one of these letters. However, about a week or so ago, I noticed that we were getting pretty much rock-solid 60 Mbit down, which was a change from how the connection would behave before, so I had been wondering if something was up.  Seeing this thread, I just went and cycled the modem, and sure enough, now we're getting north of 90 Mbit down. So...yay?  For some of you not seeing these speeds, it could be the modem (esp if you're renting one from Comcast), your cabling, or your wireless network. Wireless networks (even new tech) can/will be a lot slower than a wired connection and may be limiting what speeds you're getting at your machine."
nashville,3d6wch,AirborneGeek,-1,Tue Jul 14 16:09:18 2015 UTC,"I don't know why people here think that Comcast is going to charge more, Comcast bumps speeds often and leaves price there same. Unlike their TV pricing, their internet pricing is much less rapey. My internet price had never been raised but I also only ever buy the service and then never talk to them again.  Anyway, bumping speeds like this brings out the people that have ancient networking equipment such as old wireless routers that can't handle the speeds. Many older routers designed for 100Mbps wired and 54Mbps wireless have difficulty handling those speeds in the real world. For those that can't seem to reach advertised speeds, consider the age of your equipment; if it's around five years old then it might be time to upgrade."
nashville,3d6wch,dumb_jellyfish,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:00:39 2015 UTC,Maybe they won't change your rate (for now) but they'll change the rate for going over your data cap.

Comcast is only providing a multimode fiber hand-off and matching 10 Gb SFP+ module for the installation fee. No router with 10 Gb SFP+ WAN port (there are no consumer grade options here that I am aware of.. Probably $2000+ for a business class device?), no layer 3 switch with an SFP+ cage for the uplink ($1000 for a consumer grade 16 port Netgear model) . No 10 Gb NIC with an SFP+ cage for your PC ($500-1000). All of the equipment is on you. Your current PCs will only support 1 Gb so you will need that 10 Gb NIC for each of you want to max out the line. Or two 1 Gb NICs that you team together (and even then you would need multiple simultaneous transfers to do it.)

nashville,3d232z,slayerslayer,4,Mon Jul 13 02:19:45 2015 UTC,Agreed. From watching the actual debates Kane seems the most intelligent/reasonable.

Barry seems to be hitting the LGBT segment hard, I wouldnt be shocked if she sucked face with a chick the closer we get to the election.  Her husband works for the Scene, so that worries me.

nashville,3d232z,bargles,15,Mon Jul 13 01:19:51 2015 UTC,You want to hand the keys to a city that's already overdeveloped and needs to be curbed and done smartly to a developer who stands to benefit financially from the continued demolition and building of two homes on the same lot trend that we've seen the past 3 years?  I don't. I'm sick of that shit.
nashville,3d232z,Hubbardd,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:23:31 2015 UTC,It would be great if you knew a little about what you're talking about. Please show me one home that he's torn down and built two in place of. I'll just wait here.
nashville,3d232z,bigmur72,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:18:10 2015 UTC,"I don't see him as the person doing that sort of demolition/replacement. He's too big time for small flips like that. However, I don't see him curbing growth or going about it intelligently when he stands to benefit just like every other developer from the continued interest/growth/displacement of Nashville residents who can't afford 1200/mo rent.   Freeman to me looks like the Monopoly man, and Nashville is his board to play with once he hits the mayor's office. Add in the fact that he owns a piece of a payday lending corporation, and that he owns a large swath of the city's low income and subsidized housing and I get real uneasy, real quick.  Nashville needs to slow it's roll, develop smartly, and make sure that the entire county benefits from the growth, not just the downtown core. I don't see that strategy from Freeman, all I see is dollar signs rolling around in his eyeballs."
nashville,3d232z,Hubbardd,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:00:56 2015 UTC,I'm curious who you support.

nashville,3d232z,Hubbardd,-4,Wed Jul 15 13:16:46 2015 UTC,Fair enough.  I think I'm actually for a continuation of that trend.  Good to know there is a candidate that is looking to keep it going
nashville,3d232z,bargles,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:41:39 2015 UTC,"I would be fine with development if we had good public transit to support the density, AND if it was good build quality. Right now all these new homes going for 400k are built like shit and will look like so in a few years. They're really just a quick cash grab.   Development is going to happen is rather push for it to be done right than bitch about it on every front."
nashville,3d232z,OJSamson,2,Mon Jul 13 12:11:46 2015 UTC,"The State is going to make sure the transit isn't done. Much like the council members that got up in arms over the floodwall happening downtown, ""but not in my backyard"" - the rest of the state won't (and hasn't) looked kindly at Davidson County being the beneficiary of such a large spending project that ""only benefits"" it's residents."
nashville,3d232z,beer_geek,2,Mon Jul 13 16:25:49 2015 UTC,"this is somewhat true, but if you are referring to TDOT assuming they must be against mass transit because they torpedo'd the AMP, that's not entirely accurate.  TDOT helped prevent the AMP from being setup on West End because the city paid for a plan that required TDOT to be willing to give up roadway the state has constructed and maintained without any oversight, while still requiring TDOT to continue to maintain it afterwards. In short, the city didn't even attempt to involve the people who manage their roads on that halfassed plan to grab some Federal Funding.  But yeah, 8/10 state senators are from rural districts, that have combined the same population as the other 2/10. So we have a lot of rural influence on spending money and they want it all to be ""equal"".   For example, try telling someone in Jefferson county that it's unfair that they get more money per capita (and per mile) than Knox county, when they think it's unfair the other way because they only get their roads mowed 3 times a year instead of 4 like in Knox county..."

That's the point I was going for, TDOT itself can't really operate without the grace of those other 8/10 state senators, whether it's highways or public transit or otherwise."

Black Abby in South Nashville does Belgium style beers and they are extremely well done.  If you continue South, go to Cool Springs Brewery but that's kind of a drive.  If you are feeling like going to a pub, go to Craft Brewed on 8th ave about a mile or two away from Yazoo. This place has the best selection in Nashville."

nashville,3d136y,Vataro,2,Sun Jul 12 17:35:27 2015 UTC,Awesome. After some further research it seems like Blackstone is the only one I'm missing that top a lot of people's lists. Honestly with them being so close it seems a little foolish to try anywhere else. Thanks!
nashville,3d136y,vw195,3,Sun Jul 12 17:37:54 2015 UTC,"Ah yea, Blackstone is good too. Honestly I don't always remember them as a brewery because they're actually a full restaurant (and a pretty good one, at that!). So what you may consider is going there for dinner and hitting up the other breweries before/after. They have great fish and chips as well as a good shepherd's pie!"
nashville,3d136y,Vataro,6,Sun Jul 12 17:40:44 2015 UTC,I concur Blackstone is a brewery masquerading as a restaurant (with a great bison burger). Id go to TN BrewWorks for a brewery atmosphere.
nashville,3d136y,rousselin02,3,Sun Jul 12 18:47:40 2015 UTC,"Yea, TNBW has the best brewery atmosphere of the 3. Great view of the brewery itself from the taproom, and their taproom is spacious and they also have great food!"

Not a huge menu, but their burger is great, and the hot chicken sandwich is also really good. They also have a fancy cheese plate and charcuterie board which is quite interesting. Honestly if you haven't been there since they started it, it's awesome. I believe the chef they hired was the sous chef at a different local establishment, and he's crafted their menu himself using their different beers in most, if not all, of their menu."

nashville,3d136y,mrbrambles,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:43:17 2015 UTC,"Yea, there's a lot you can take in. If you like hard liquor I also highly recommend Corsair Distillery. It's a very highly rated distillery that has a couple good bourbons/whiskeys, and also some good gin, vodka, and other stuff. They also have a taproom where they serve local beers.   I also saw someone else recommend Craftbrewed. If you want to get a good taste of local breweries (and others in the region) without having to drive all over the place, they're also a great place to check out, and it's just a mile or so down 8th from Jackalope. They have 20-30 taps, you can do pints and growlers, they also have a great selection of bottles and cans to take back with you (all craft beer of course), and they also run a liquor store next door (which will have most or all of Corsair's products as well if you just want to grab a bottle instead of visiting the distillery)."

My gf and I got done with the yazoo tour and walked to Czann's after. They have about 6 on tap at the moment, and do a half pint flight of all of them for $15 (half pint of everything they have)."
nashville,3d136y,the_lost_carrot,3,Sun Jul 12 21:24:31 2015 UTC,Czann's has amazing beer.

If you're more interested in the beer itself, I'd personally rather go to a bar that has a big local tap list and try various local brews that interest me.  To that end, look at Hop Stop or either of the Filling Station locations.   12 south tap room would also be on that list, plus maybe Hops and Crafts or Craft Brewed, though I've personally not been to either of the latter two (double check to make sure wherever you're headed is open Monday, but most everything is, except some finer dining spots)"
nashville,3d136y,myroomisonfire,2,Sun Jul 12 23:40:35 2015 UTC,Yeah I've been on enough brewery tours that I'm not dying to do one. There is something about getting the beer from the  source and seeing all of their options that I do like though. 12 south taproom is right near our hotel and the fact that Yazoo is closed means I'll have to probably go there and do some sampling. Thanks for the advice!

Black Abbey and Little Harpeth are pretty good as well (Little Harpeth is lagers only).   Blackstone, Yazoo, and Jackalope are good, but it really depends on the beer.

If you know their music taste you can't beat at the Ryman or even purchase them a river queen voyage ticket (a guided kayak trip that passes by downtown Nashville - neat way to see the city).

Then there's also McKay's which is a huge warehouse full of used movies, games, books and CDs. They also have a pretty big selection of used vinyl, and lately they've been ordering some new ones too. You can get lost in there.   Oh and there's Phonoluxe which is only open on the weekends and has mostly old stuff but is pretty cool to visit."

I have had some good luck finding new and old HC releases used at the groove but it's very hit or miss. Fond Object was a gold mine when it first opened but it was picked over pretty fast  (it was one guys personal collection). FO will stock reissues of some 80's HC.

nashville,3cxj5j,sdana,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:47:07 2015 UTC,I think it depends on what your looking for as in New Vs.  Used. The new is hands down Grimey's. The used i like great escape cause the collection is just massive.  If you looking for only top flight used Grimeys has a rep of scanning it harder when they buy.  The worst has to be Mkays they don't care and there collection is always sub par

nashville,3cwt3n,chuck_c,2,Sun Jul 12 02:00:53 2015 UTC,"Biggest idea is to live near where you work, but too late for that, huh?  There are cycle safety courses that you can take. Learn to ride comfortably in traffic. Make sure your bicycle actually fits you, that its tires are inflated properly, and that it has the safety gear you need. Some bicycles are more efficient than others; you might consult with the people at Halcyon about your steel steed.  Consider, if you can afford it, getting a rear pannier rack installed on your bike. You can then attach milk crates or square buckets on the side so that you don't have to wear a backpack. Backpacks are unwieldy, and can block your view.  As for that hill, if you go on church instead, it's a lot easier. The capitol building is on the highest point downtown. There's no real purpose of going over that hill."

They suggest Mohu and they claim we can get around 38 channels with one of their models. I'm kind of waiting to get some good reviews and I'm also hoping that the OTA converter price drops. It's like $80 now.   I've got AppleTV, XboxOne w/ Netflix and Amazon Instant Video, and hulu.  I've also been thinking about getting SlingTV that runs on my Xbox One. I did the trial a bit ago and it works pretty well.   This gets me the major news channels I really want, some sports channels, and the rest of the stuff I'd want to watch (AMC, HGTV, etc.)  I also have 25Mbps from Comcast. I pay $39 a month. This is more than enough to get 1080 through Netflix, Amazon, and Xbox Video.   SlingTV is a little grainy, but it does get up to 1080 in spurts. It's a little annoying. Also, Sling DOESN'T support surround sound. Nearly a deal killer.   So, based on all the stuff I've found, I'll be spending about $85 a month. Right now, I have my $40 comcast bill and a $90ish dish bill, netflix @ $10. I also have planned on hulu but that's on the fence.   My main reason for cutting the cord is that I pay so much for dish. Dish doesn't really give me 1080. It looks like it's compressed quite a bit and is really pixelly and grainy. I spend $90 a month and have a grainy feed. Makes me so mad."

VHF signals don't penetrate walls as well as UHF, so if they're marginal inside your house and the atmosphere provides more resistance, your signal will fall below the threshold. I have a friend who works at one of the local stations, and he  says that 95% of the reception issue calls he gets are from people using indoor antennas. He hates them, especially the ones touting ""built in amplifiers."" If you have a very low signal-to-noise ratio to begin with, amplifiers boost both the signal and the noise, so you still get no picture.  He says put up a rooftop antenna like our Dads did for best reception."

nashville,3cs0lv,mcchopnslice,8,Fri Jul 10 08:30:14 2015 UTC,"Germantown is an area of Nashville currently undergoing a major Renaissance.  It is the closest neighborhood to the Farmer's Market. It is directly North of downtown, so you could walk or bike most places with comparatively minimal effort.  It is also close to the major bus hub I believe. The Capitol greens aren't exactly a secluded park, but are right there. A significant portion of the ""hottest"" new restaurants in town are opening in this location. It's not the cheapest neighborhood in town, but if you're coming from L.A. the rents probably won't seem crazy to you. The only real concern I would have is that this is an area on the upswing and still has an element of grittiness to it, but it is poised to become even nicer and safer than it already is in the coming years. As someone with the better half of two decades experience in upscale and fine dining, I say welcome to Nashville. We have a significantly burgeoning culinary scene here and a population that appreciates good food. I believe Nashville is going to explode in the coming years. It's a good time to be here."
nashville,3cs0lv,BlueVeins,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:23:38 2015 UTC,+1 for Germantown.  Sounds ideal for every situation except for the big parks and West Nashville is 15 mins for the Warner parks/Radnor and another 15 to get to the Harpeth to kayak.

nashville,3cs0lv,nashnl,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:03:36 2015 UTC,"Nashvillains?? That's the coolest reference to locals i may have come across yet! It's called Stout, it's a craft pub with semi-routine gastro fare and such. I'm not familiar with the concept, even though they are based here, but i was approached by the owner (who is good friends with the owners of the coffee shop i work next to) after he heard we were moving to TN. From what i gather, it isn't quite the level of food I'm used to preparing but maybe, with the move and all the new things to explore, a simpler kitchen/menu would be a nice change of pace. I'll keep you updated."
nashville,3cs0lv,lurkin7777,5,Fri Jul 10 19:37:10 2015 UTC,"Hi Tony and Sara,   There are tons of great neighborhoods in Nashville that, from what you wrote, you'll fit right into. Keep in mind that Nashville is much smaller than LA in sprawl so even if you can't get all of what you want, likely you'll be much closer than before to everything you could need or want. Can I ask what your budget is?   Here are some options: If you are looking for a true one bedroom for 1200-1400 or less/month: Your spot is likely going to be in the suburbs- which is fine as long as you have a car. Donelson, Hermitage, Madison, Antioch, and maybe between Antioch and Brentwood might be good places to look. All (or almost all) have a nearby farmer's market. Hermitage is very close to Music City Bikeway, a huge running/biking path that runs from Hermitage to Rivergate. Hermitage and Donelson (East of Nashville) also has access to Music City Star, a commuter train that runs to and from downtown Nashville during work hours. Warning: Traffic into Nashville is terrible. Not LA terrible, but still bad, and no one knows how to drive here.  If your budget is 1400-1600 you should try East Nashville- Towards the North (Trinity Lane area). Everyone wants to live in East Nashville so you have to be at the right place at the right time.   You should also look at the new neighborhoods popping up on Charlotte Pike- I've never lived along Charlotte but it's up and coming. Another place to look is the Nations.  1600-1800 You can try East Nashville closer to downtown. Some places are within walking distance (although you have to walk under an interstate in some cases). You are close to Nissan Stadium, the walking bridge, Shelby Bottoms Park, downtown attractions (honky tonks/broadway)- but you are far enough away from the tourists (even the lost tourists).   for 18-2000 you should also look in Wedgewood Houston, Sylvan Park, outskirts of 12 South, Hillsboro and Germantown.   In Germantown you'll be close to the new Sounds Stadium, the Nashville Farmer's Market, and downtown.   Hillsboro is near Belmont and Vanderbilt. On 21st Avenue, you'll find a ""village"" of trendy coffee shops and independently owned stores. The Belcourt Theatre is one of my favorite places to go. It is host to Nashville's only independent movie theatre playing cult classics, indie films, mainstream movies, documentaries, and special screenings.   12 South is a great spot with lots of local foods, a very small Farmer's market popup and a small park. It has easy access to Green Hills (which has a few more food options, coffee, a mall and Trader Joe's).   For 2000-3000 check the Gulch. It's very close to downtown but it's pricey.  You really cannot go wrong in Nashville- I gave you generic price levels but every neighborhood has its own price ranges from super cheap to extremely pricey. For example, there's a place in Hilsboro running for about 1,200 for two bedrooms and 800 sq. ft. called the Cheateau. In contrast, there are places in the suburbs that are outrageous for their locations.   Here are lists of parks: http://www.nashville.gov/Parks-and-Recreation.aspx  Waterfalls near Nashville:  http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g55229-i154-k6676426-Closest_Waterfalls_to_Nashville-Nashville_Tennessee.html  Nashville up and coming foodie scene http://nashville.eater.com/  Nashville music venues/schedules:  http://www.nashvillescene.com/  Good luck!"

I didn't really have my eye on Nashville or anything. 3 of my friends from Memphis moved to CA and only one is moving back (we ended up dating for 1.5 years now). The other two have made CA their perma home and haven't looked back. BF wants to be closer to family and found a great job opportunity and the rest is history.

I think it will be very nice for me to feel moisture again, jump in a pile of leaves and shovel the driveway. I think she'll be quite excited and open to an actual white Christmas. We're just fed up with the west coast. If i didnt think she would enjoy it i would have suggested a different part of the country. Additionally, i would thoroughly enjoy it if you stopped by Stout, in Brentwood, after we open in Oct and say hi. I'll be more than happy to give you a little Cali throwback cuisine. Additionally, i always offer personal cooking lessons and cater small dinner private parties at the host's homes and would be more than elated to serve a fellow redditor!!

nashville,3coj8u,thomfountain,10,Thu Jul 9 14:44:10 2015 UTC,"Your 7-step plan to a great Nashville Sunday, targeting restaurants, shopping, bars and etc.   Find a bar to get brunch at.  Most places will be open for this from 10am-12noon, my favorite is Tavern. Proceed to get brunch-hammered, this should involve mimosas, delicious breakfast food, and socializing with other tables (depending on where you're at). Go home, have sex, take a nap.  Now it's maybe 3-5pm, depending on when you wake up and when you want to get dinner, decide whether or not to nix step 4 Go to Opry Mills Mall, shop and people watch.  You could also do this in Hillsboro village or downtown if you want a different mood.  Really the point here is to shop, burn time, and keep walking so you get hungry.  If you like parks, Centennial is your place and Vanderbilt's campus is awesome for checking out old stately buildings and beautiful lawns/gardens.  Do this until dinnertime, which I'm guessing should land around 6-8pm Eat delicious chicken at McDougal's.  2-for-1 beers all day every day, and free ice cream after your meal.  Your call on outdoor seating, there's a very cool nashville-hipster decor inside and outside is Hillsboro village for some great scenery. I always eat outside when the weather is nice, but that's me. Did you see any movies that looked good at the mall?  Go check it out.  Into more artsy flicks?  The Belcourt is walking distance from McDougal's, and they'll give you a parking pass for their lot with your ticket.  Double Dogs just opened up there too, and will probably be a happening sports bar for Football around that time. Go home, have sex, go to bed.  Mission accomplished."

nashville,3coj8u,Sand_isOverrated,2,Thu Jul 9 18:50:59 2015 UTC,"I've been lurking reddit for 2-3 years, and finally found a post that compelled me to register.  So, lets start at the top addressing the other comments..  1) Unless you are up at 10am and in line, kiss a trendy brunch spot goodbye.  There are a few places that always have room and are amazing, but I won't mention them here for fear you are going to take my seat.  For a good brunch that you have a fighting chance at being seated you need to look around.  I will list some fallbacks: Germantown Cafe, Suzy Wongs (patio, the inside has some horrific loud music), Tin Angel  2) Don't get suckered in to the Sunday Funday places that offer bottomless shit.    3) Church?  wtf?  A real Nashville Sunday?  The place you eat depends on when you wake up.  If you are early, you can land a popular and good place (Eg, Tavern, like someone else mentioned).  If you aren't, its an adventure.  Shoot for either new places (eg Steadfast, Butchertown) or older places (eg  the aforementioned Tin Angel, Germantown).  Other places are a waitlist.    If you drink enough at brunch, you end up at one of the watering holes, which on Sunday is typically Midtown.  If you are from out of town and haven't been able to consume as much country music as you would like, downtown is hopping.  Otherwise you take a nap and do something productive.  That is pretty much the run.  You wake up Monday with an inevitable feeling that you have wasted a relaxing weekend day.  You will vow to not do the same thing the following weekend, and you fail at that promise in seven days."
nashville,3coj8u,stevejones90210,3,Fri Jul 10 06:55:12 2015 UTC,"Truth is, about 70% of Nashvillians start the day at church (ca. 9-noon).  Which is why Satan's playmates are engaged in drink and debauchery.  If you see a big church (5,000 to 1.5 million sq. ft.) find another route.  Just because they're ""saved"" doesn't mean they won't kill you.  You can buy an on-premises cocktail as early as 10AM Sundays.  You can't buy hard liquor or wine at retail stores all day Sundays, though you can get beer.  Stock up Saturday or plan to dine (and drink) out.  A semi-tradition I have is Indian food at lunch Sunday.  Sitar http://www.sitarindiannashville.com/ is the best in town, and they have a really popular buffet all week, including Sundays.  It's pretty close to Centennial Park, which has live music most weekends in the Musician's Corner and plenty of grass to enjoy some sun or shade, as well as a nice little duck pond.  There's a Barnes and Noble bookstore across West End Ave right at the park where you can pick up your Sunday NYT and cool off a bit whilst browsing books (skip The Tennessean ""newspaper"" unless you have a cat).  Don't forget to check out Lake Palmer, which is usually pretty quiet on weekends."

nashville,3cl107,_nightingail,32,Wed Jul 8 19:02:49 2015 UTC,"Water moccasins are cottonmouths, Agkistrodon piscivorous.  They can be found in and around any body of water in Tennessee. But they're not like krakens that rise from the deep to bite your leg while you swim. They breathe air and only swim to move around. They eat amphibians and small mammals like rodents who are also live around the water, or just want a quick drink.  Don't go messing around reclusive shore areas. If you do, have your wits about you, and don't do anything foolish. They are just trying to survive like the rest of us, and only strike when they feel threatened. They can see you're bigger than them and can't eat you. They'll go away if you make their environment uncomfortable.  They're also relatively uncommon, compared to other snakes. If you see a snake near the water, it's more likely to be a garter snake, king snake, or black racer than a cottonmouth. You can tell by the keeled scales and more pronounced triangular head."

nashville,3cl107,malachus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:58:26 2015 UTC,"So then, by your own maps, you can see there have been a handful of sightings of cottonmouths in East Tennessee. As far as I know, there's not been a full inventory done in that area, and it would be impractical to do so. But you can bet that with climate change warming the traditionally cooler East Tennessee region, cottonmouths will begin to migrate in that direction. Fewer freezing nights, less snow/ice, means they can set up more permanently, and there's a hell of a lot more habitat out there than there is in West Tennessee. All they have to do is follow the Tennessee River."
nashville,3cl107,TheLurkerSpeaks,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:48:52 2015 UTC,"If you read the references you will find that the East TN sightings are unsubstantiated written reports from one guy in 1956.  While I do think it is possible for them to survive in some of those waterways, I am still highly sceptical of the idea that they can be found in all TN waterways since there are no confirmed reports for most of the state (or Davidson county, for that matter) and some of the waterways in East TN are very cold.  Hopefully a helpful redditor can take a decent photo and send it to the people who maintain the atlas."

Nevertheless biologists include them as part of the fauna of Tennessee. Same as Coral Snakes and Pygmy Rattlers.  When someone asks me if cottonmouths are in East Tennessee, I'm going to say its unlikely, but possible. I have all the evidence to make such a statement."

nashville,3cl107,mk454,3,Wed Jul 8 19:20:50 2015 UTC,"Yes there are various areas around Priest where cottonmouths nest. Usually coves with rock ledges. There are several rec areas around the lake with designated swimming areas, but if you wanna take a tip in a non designated area, I recommend throwing in a few rocks around the area you wanna swim to frighten off any snakes if there are any there. Nests of baby snakes are what you should be cautious about, but they are usually in the shallows on the banks, so just look where you step when getting in the water. I have grown up in the sticks of TN, swimming in creeks and such, and just followed these old tips and have never had any close encounters. Copperheads aren't as common around here, but do exist. Just watch where you step walking through the woods. Copperheads will shake their tail like a rattler when the feel threatened. Usually they will be in some leaves and it will sound similar to a rattler. Not trying to scare you or anything. I have only seen a few venomous snakes around my entire life in middle TN, but it is important to know the precautions just in case. I have heard that if you do get bit, not to panic (like that's possible) and don't run or do anything that would increase your heart rate. Also, don't attempt that whole suck the poison out thing, just seek medical attention quickly and calmly. You aren't gonna die immediately, but the affects will increase as your heart rate does. But yeah, all that info is just in case of the unlikely event of a snake bite. There are tons of nonvenomous snakes around the lake as well."
nashville,3cl107,lothartheunkind,3,Wed Jul 8 19:33:15 2015 UTC,"I used to jump the cliffs at Elm Hill a lot back in the day and only ran across snakes twice. Once there was one in the water with a girl screaming like a maniac (understandably so) They are around but not out in the middle of the lake. If you swim in a less busy area start by chucking some rocks in the area to scare them out. They're just as scared of you as you are of them, just don't jump into a nest and you'll be fine."

It's in an old house and the entire place just feels nasty. They also can't fry potatoes for shit - their potatoes are always super greasy and soggy.   I do like their red beans and rice though.

And I made the mistake of getting a cherry dip and that tasted like shit. I threw away the cone after three bites.   International Thai sucks.   Brown's Diner is ok. Not handicap accessible.   Swett's is too expensive and not as good as Arnold's.
nashville,3cp6cb,mechanicalpulse,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:09:25 2015 UTC,"Hole in the wall?  Bolton's for hot chicken.  417 Union for American food.

Corner Pub Midtown if you want a loud, smoky dive bar that serves hellfire wings and is packed with college kids.  Puckett's Grocery for southern cuisine (though it's not a hole in the wall, unless you're going to the one down in Leiper's Fork).  Take a look at the Gulch, too.

nashville,3clthh,QuackerMTG,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:40:10 2015 UTC,"The best you can ask for around here is not tiny shrimps, freshly and properly fried food and not too sweet sauces. I currently like Chopstick House, although it seems like they're changing chefs often or something.   China Gourmet in Franklin is decent in the criteria above. It seems to be owned and operated by a small family, which I like. They're worth a try if you're in the area.   My favorite in the area is China Wok in Hendersonville. They've had the same menu for as long as I've known them and their General Tso's Chicken dinner combo is pretty terrific - doubly so if you sub in lo mein for fried rice. I just don't get over to that side of town much any more - but every time I am, I stop here for a to go order.   Golden Coast has a ""chinese chinese"" buffet on the weekend, or at least they used to. You can eat things like chicken feet and congee. I thought it was meh but my chinese friends thought it was OK."

nashville,3clthh,TheLurkerSpeaks,4,Thu Jul 9 11:54:29 2015 UTC,"China Cottage in Madison. Chinatown in Green Hills. Lucky Bamboo on Charlotte. Fulin anywhere. These are your consistently good restaurants.  However, the traditional buffet served on weekends at lunchtime at Golden Coast on West End is the best Chinese in Nashville. It is packed full of Chinese people who will push you over to get the fresh stuff while swearing at you in Mandarin. It's no joke. They are inconsistent as to what is on the buffet, but it's always authentic.  I'm sorry, but that's all we've got. A long time ago there was Golden Dragon (which was excellent before it buffeted out), and before that Peking Garden. Those days are long gone."

I think (for a buffet) Hibachi Grill over by the zoo is pretty impressive for quantity, and a decent quality.     A friend recommended Hong Kong off Charlotte and it was decent (also had folks say that's cat, and there are roaches everywhere etc).   Sushi Train also has some Chinese menu items that are ok.

Also, how about a rule that says the confederate flag can't be flown unless some number of conf soldiers came from that county.

nashville,3chgig,southernITdude,-2,Wed Jul 8 13:57:23 2015 UTC,I shouldn't have said most because they is no way of knowing. Tennessee was a battleground and a lot of men went North and South to enlist in other states. The bottom line is that the state was fairly evenly split between Confederates and Unionists which makes flying only the Confederate flag in Tennessee to celebrate ancestors who fought in Civil War a complete denial of history.
nashville,3chgig,Ignatius_Atreides,5,Wed Jul 8 15:58:40 2015 UTC,"Actually, there are ways of knowing. In particular, roll call lists, pension requests, and unit rosters are available on microfilm held by the National Archives (for both Union and Confederate units) and various state archives for southern states. This is one of the primary ways that Sons of Confederate Veterans applicants prove their genealogy, for example.  About 136,000 Tennesseans fought for the CSA, less than 38,000 joined the Union soldiers (Source: American Civil War Research Database). These numbers are based on factual, concrete records. Even if thousands of soldiers somehow slipped through the cracks, it is clear that Civil War soldiers from TN overwhelmingly fought for the South. If anything, it's more difficult to find records of Confederate service as many were destroyed or lost during the war and Reconstruction."

The highways cut through there and made it into a little pocket with lots of dead-end streets. I know there are some deals there, and I even looked at a house on Claiborne. But it just doesn't look good to me.  Example: when I thought to buy on Claiborne, I asked a guy, taking care of his lawn, what he thought about the neighborhood. He said ""I don't talk to anyone, I keep my head low, and nobody messes with me."" That's not a recommendation."

If you want to live on that side of town, I would at least try to get in the Wedgewood-Houston or Woodbine areas.

South Nashville is what I love & define as Nashville - more so than where I grew up, which was in Donelson- even now & when I was a kid in the early 80s.    The only crime I saw there was when they removed the Statue of Loretta Lynn from her Country Western Wear store on Donelson pike. Heh, When I was very young, I thought that was actually the real life- Loretta Lynn on top of  her Horse. I mean, of course I did, right? I miss that statue. Anybody know where it ended up?

nashville,3cfmvn,ZapRowsdower756,4,Tue Jul 7 16:44:19 2015 UTC,"Yes! OP, pay attention. Virgin Falls is incredibly overlooked. There are no fewer than THREE nice waterfalls on this trail. One of which flows over a huge open cave allowing you to walk behind the falls. Virgin falls itself actually flows out of one cave up on a cliff and back into another cave below. It's remarkable.   The hike also features incredible rock formations virtually the entire way, and follows a nice stream. The hike used to also offer great caving, but you can no longer enter the caves due to white nose syndrome (a disease that is killing bats)."

There is plenty of primitive camping if so inclined (make sure to get a permit from ranger station). Greeter Falls has upper and lower falls that is worth the trip as you'll only ever see two to four people, if any at all. With all the rain lately, I'm sure the falls will be really great.There is a close parking lot if you weren't camping or just wanted a short hike."

That place has miles and miles of trails. The landscape is beautiful and surprisingly rugged. You'll have easy access to water pretty much anywhere you go there. You'll find creeks, small waterfalls, sinkholes, and interesting rock formations. It's one of my favorite places to hike.   Edit: The only downside is they allow horses on some trails, so keep an eye out for holes stomped in the trail so you don't break an ankle."

nashville,3cfmvn,WFU_Showtime,3,Tue Jul 7 20:34:47 2015 UTC,"Very private. Easy access to water at most sites. There are usually a couple of logs set up near the fire ring where you can sit. They limit campers to one group per site, so unless there are people passing by, you won't have other campers closer than a mile or two away. I've had a much easier time finding firewood here than at denser camping areas like those at Foster Falls where camp sites are set up in groups close enough to see from one to the next.    I have a ton of picture from around that area. I'll dig through them later and upload a few for you."

nashville,3cfmvn,AuthenticHuman,3,Tue Jul 7 22:23:53 2015 UTC,"Cookeville resident here, you've got to come out this way for any waterfalls really.  As others said, there's Fall Creek Falls, which is the tallest waterfall east of the Mississippi, but it's too accessible for my tastes. The parking lot is all of 100 ft from the falls overlook, so there are always a ton of people there.   There are some overnight trails there as well, but still too crowded for me.  Have a look at Virgin Falls, that's my go to for easy hiking/camping and there's always just a group, maybe two you'll run into whole there.  It's in Sparta, TN, which should be about 90 min from Nash, the hike to the main fall is about 4-5m each way, so it's not very long, and the trails themselves aren't too troublesome to navigate.   You pass by two small falls on the way to Virgin Falls, which is 110ft. There is a camping spot on the bluffs overlooking the falls, as well as another camping spot about 0.5m from the head of the falls on the bank of the Caney Fork River, which is normally where you'd want to do any swimming at."

nashville,3cgy22,AngelInThePit,3,Tue Jul 7 22:08:37 2015 UTC,"I have no idea about pedicures (FOOT FUNGUS) but can comment on the state of shellac manicures in Nashville. This doesn't help you (sorry) but I just wanted to let the ladies (and men?) know.   Apex Nails on West End does a terrible job on shellac manicures. I noticed they often pain into the skin which allows for easy peeling of the polish. Once I went to hot yoga the day after a manicure and literally every nail was peeling. Yeah, I know, expanded nail bed from moisture but that has never happened even with home nail polish.  The most popular place is Signature Nails in Green Hills. They do an excellent job for an average price. Be warned, it's the best so it's busy, and they run it like a factory. Many Yelp reviews comment on how the customer was mad they weren't ""pampered"" enough. They sound like rich suburban ladies who don't work and have nothing to do with their time. If you want a manicure than makes your nails look good and lasts and I realize the world doesn't revolve around you and your need to feel special, I'd recommend Signaure Nails.   Nail Bar in Green Hills is exactly like Signature with higher prices because the have a better, less assembly line, atmosphere. Been there only once because of the price but the manicure did last 2+ weeks and looked great.   For what it's worth, my best friend only gets pedicures at Signature despite living in Franklin. I like in Midtown and will deal with traffic to get my pedicures there.   TL;DR: Signature Nails in Green Hills is best but not the cheapest. Apex Nails on West End is cheaper but does a lousy job."

And my aunt really really likes her pizza. But the thing is pizza out here sucks unless you enjoy slop like dominoes or pizza hut. So like one night after a movie or something shes all ""ooh lets go pick up from Salvos we order there for lunch at work and blah blah"".  So I go in there to look at the menu and I'm all meh and fleh cause I'm the one in the family who kinda hates pizza. If you had to eat it 3-4 nights a week growing up, you'd dislike it too. Anyways, nothing on the menu appealed to me..it was all either pizza, or pizza sandwiches, or some really lame pasta. Basically, if you want anything more than tomato or alfredo sauce you are shit out of luck at Salvos. So I got their spinach roll, and I was pissed off cause there was barely any spinach in it and just a shit ton of mozzarella cheese.  Anyways, fast forward about 2 years later, it got brought up again one night and and I opted to try their ""Salvo stromboli"" which is basically a hot sub in a roll. It wasn't bad, not like I'm used to though, but I found I liked it better cold. My aunt by mistake ordered the WRONG sausage calzone and was grossed out to find it was half ricotta and mozzarella.

So Smooth Soul Food is a trailer on the corner of Murfreesboro Road and Waldron Rd I think? It's very good. Open Thurs-Sun.  Best Chinese is from Chopstick House on Murfreesboro Road.   Blue Coast Burrito makes a good burrito.   Karin's Kustard is OK. I wouldn't go there expecting something that'll blow your socks off but it's solid All-American food.   Honorable mention for the Jersey Mike's in Smyrna. Bert, the guy who manages the place, runs a very good shop.   Buddy's Eatery sucks. It's run half-assed and everything is pre-made in catering trays. They just slop it out for you."

My Yelp review that Yelp just wont publish:  Blue Coast Burrito $ Mexican 635 President Pl Smyrna, TN 37167 1.0 star rating 1/1/2014  This place sucks. Just stay away. If I could give it zero stars I would.  The moment you walk in, you are beaten to death literally by huge signs that yell DUDE and YO and RAD in your face. The food itself is extremely subpar. Probably the lowest quality cuts of steak I have ever had in my life inside the burrito. The food was bland and tasteless.  The only thing I can think of after having been here, is that it would be the Subway of mexican food. And it literally is. You stand there and tell them what you want in it, and they do it all subway style. My food was cold, tasted kinda nasty. The chick at the counter may have been pleasant, but I couldn't even tell. Just the moment I got in there, and saw those signs I wanted out. My friend however insisted on trying the food.  I understand that this place is supposedly californian, but the whole experience just made me want to carve out my eyes. Go instead to Oscars, La Siesta, El Rodeo, Margarita House, whatever. I'd even rather eat Taco Bell than this slop.  I will never be back, to any of their locations, ever."
nashville,3ch796,QuackerMTG,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:11:37 2015 UTC,"I never said they were the best burrito but that they were a good burrito in the Smyrna area. I'm not sure where you saw Dude and Rad - I think you inserted those in your memory because of the California theme to the restaurant. The steak is never good at any of the taco restaurants in Nashville. There are rare exceptions, but as a general rule, I stay away from steak and Mexican. Oscar's also has terrible steak.   I like the salsa bar and they are generous with their portions. The staff is usually friendly, although they have a lot of turnover. It's a nice, fresh option in the sea of fried food that is Smyrna.  Also, there's a Reel Fish Market on Almaville road. Only open on the weekends and their menu changes weekly. It's quite good, although a little spendy."

I'm less than impressed with all the bbq and southern cooking, not to mention all the mexican places that are pretty blah compared to where I'm from.  If you're down with some greek/mediterranean fare, Maro's Gyro over by the kroger on ridley gets a lot of my business. Foods good, I recommend the big sampler platter. They give you enough stuff for 2-3 meals for only 13 bucks.   Also, there's this Buddy's Eatery place which is more homestyle food. It's inexpensve and you get ""seconds"" which is new to me for a restaurant. They let you change your main dish for that too, and usually have 7-8 things to choose from, and you get a couple sides and a dessert. Food was good there. I had a chat with the owners dad when I went, friendly guy. It's over in that same plaza where the sullivans bar is, like behind jim & nicks or whatever.

nashville,3cbnra,subcinco,15,Mon Jul 6 20:49:22 2015 UTC,"i would point out the sharrows (that's what these are called) that are in the middle of the on-ramp lane of Rosa Parks near metrocenter, both directions. I would point out the sharrows on Spring Street, which seem to be invitations to suicide, at least at peak hours. These sharrows also point towards on-ramps to Ellington, which is weird.  And the Shelby Street sharrow route follows the route of highest elevation gain to get to the park, which is just plain odd. No one who is going to Five Points is going up the hill to tenth street; we are going left somewhere between fifth and eighth to get on Woodland, which has a nice gentle grade. It's nice that they extended the bike route to the KVB, too: it used to end abruptly in the middle of an on-ramp lane. Like, oh! Yay! We've guided you here so you can die! Have fun!    All in all, a lot of the sharrow bike routes seem to be a kafkaesque attempt to convince cyclists that cycling is too much work or too dangerous. I'm glad the effort exists, but sometimes it seems insincere or even duplicitous.   Just to balance things out, I think the effort on KVBlvd is really top-notch, though a lot of those lanes are in the door zone for parked cars. I really like the protected lanes on the 31st Ave Connector. The lane markings on Charlotte end abruptly in several instances, but I'm glad there was thought that went into those.  I hope they have a bike route plan, but I think they may just be putting in sharrows and bike lanes haphazardly, perhaps to look better in Federal transportation grant applications."
nashville,3cbnra,illimitable1,10,Mon Jul 6 21:32:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I moved here from Dayton, Ohio, where we had hundreds of miles of connected, dedicated bike paths.

Here is seems confusing, dangerous and unorganized. I see most bikes on the sidewalks, which makes me extremely uncomfortable. It's incredibly dangerous. In my opinion, more dangerous than riding on the somewhat scary streets."

I actually think that Woodland Street is a really good choice for bicycle infrastructure. People in cars can go northward on Gallatin/Main instead. And people in cars can use the ample middle turning lane to pass those who are riding bicycles, when it safe to do so. There's usually space for everyone.   I think eleven miles an hour is a good expectation for most people who are riding a bicycle for transportation. Those people in cars who swerve into oncoming traffic?

nashville,3cbnra,chuck_c,3,Tue Jul 7 14:27:47 2015 UTC,"I think people who don't ride bicycles for transit tend to look for bad behavior by some people on bicycles to denounce all people who ride bikes. Everyone violates traffic laws from time to time, whether on a bicycle or while driving a car. Because most of the people who are on the road are driving cars, it's a straightforward fact that most of the red lights run, most of the rolling stops at stop signs, and various other infractions are committed by people driving cars.   But people with an axe to grind against bicycle riders use the fact that they've seen people on bicycles violate traffic laws as a way to reinforce their opposition to bicycling.   I've violated traffic laws in a car and on a bicycle. The main difference is that if I violate the law on my bicycle, I'm not going to kill anyone but me."

Everyone would be better off if cars and bikes followed the rules, and I gripe at cyclists who are obviously making things worse. As illimitable mentioned, a vast majority of the lights in this city do not turn green for cyclists. Nashville has a ""dead red"" law, which states that a cyclist can run a red light if it has not turned for a ""reasonable amount of time."" It is sometimes safer to look both ways and run a red light than it is to wait for cars to trigger them or shuffle over to the sidewalk and back to hit the walk button."
nashville,3cbnra,chuck_c,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:08:38 2015 UTC,"I didn't know about that law, but its a good one. However, what you described is NOT what I have witnessed. What I've witnessed is cyclists barely slowing down before barreling through a red light, simply b/c there wasn't a car coming at that exact time. I understand that motorists need to be more aware/careful/respectful of cyclists. However, if cyclists want respect, especially ones afforded by law, they need to follow the laws."
nashville,3cbnra,WFU_Showtime,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:01:48 2015 UTC,"Yes. I see it too. Even though biking is my main transportation, I would love to see police start ticketing for this stuff, along with cell phone use and taking blind rights."
nashville,3cbnra,chuck_c,0,Wed Jul 8 14:06:45 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you mean by stopping. Do you mean ""slows down to about 2 miles per hour, looks both ways, and keeps on going""? Do you mean ""comes to a complete stop, puts at least one foot on the pavement""?   My personal opinion is that some of the rules that are engineered for people in cars make less sense for people on bicycles. Bicycles are slow, and sometimes the safest thing is to look at an intersection in the long lead up to actually arriving at the signal, slow down to just as near stopped as can be without unclipping or taking feet off the pedals, and then proceeding.  Another thing is that if I'm at the head of a group of cars, and I get to a red light, I'm not going to stop if there's no cross traffic because it's safer for me to look both ways and get ahead of traffic than it is to hold up the line when the light turns green.  And finally, a lot of lights in town are triggered by in-the-ground sensors that only detect cars, anyway. So there's that, too.  These are the reasons I don't always do stoplights. Your mileage may vary."
nashville,3cbnra,illimitable1,2,Tue Jul 7 22:51:34 2015 UTC,"Well if you are going to willingly break or ignore clear laws, then you shouldn't complain when other people do the same. A motorist not giving you 3 feet is breaking a law. You are breaking the law when you don't stop at a red light. You can't have it both ways."
nashville,3cbnra,WFU_Showtime,0,Wed Jul 8 14:03:10 2015 UTC,"In terms of stoplights and stop signs, I actually would prefer a redesign for bikes. Sometimes laws and road design really need to be redone to take the use of bicycles into consideration.  I'm into using the roads safely. That's something you and I agree on.

nashville,3cbnra,barto5,0,Tue Jul 7 11:58:55 2015 UTC,"So two is cool, but three is too many? Or how is it, exactly?  My usual take is that if people in cars have to wait behind people on bicycles, that's okay. It's a short delay that is like a lot of other delays that a driver might encounter, like an elderly driver or a schoolbus stopping. It's obvious with three that there is not enough room to pass, I guess. But that's not going to last for half a New York minute before you'll be on your way?"
nashville,3cbnra,illimitable1,3,Tue Jul 7 13:15:28 2015 UTC,Pretty sure that by law three is too* many.
nashville,3cbnra,Daniel0745,0,Tue Jul 7 14:00:47 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to imagine how this could be. A person on a bicycle can take the entire lane if, in his or her judgment, s/he is safer doing so. And the law generally treats people on bicycles as vehicles, i.e. with all the prerogatives that people in cars have.   It makes sense, perhaps, that only two or fewer bicycles could be in a lane, I guess? Or that people on bicycles shouldn't take up more than one lane at a time in most circumstances. But I don't think it's against the law. Will you look with me?  http://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/2010/title-55  Oh, look here! It does say that.   ""(b)  (1)  Persons riding bicycles upon a roadway shall not ride more than two (2) abreast except on paths or parts of roadways set aside for the exclusive use of bicycles. Persons riding two (2) abreast shall not impede the normal and reasonable movement of traffic and, on a laned roadway, shall ride within a single lane.""  I think that's going to be  a hard sell in terms of enforcement, but it does, indeed, say that in the law, right after it says that people on bikes can use as much of the lane as needed to get where they are going safely."
nashville,3cbnra,illimitable1,2,Tue Jul 7 14:36:24 2015 UTC,There's a lot of two lane roads around my home that are very popular with cyclists and I'm aware of them and pass them carefully.   But it irritates me no end when they ride two or three abreast like it's the peloton at the Tour de France.   I'm perfectly willing to share the road with cyclists. But sometimes it seems like they're not willing to share the road with me.
nashville,3cbnra,barto5,-1,Tue Jul 7 17:23:39 2015 UTC,So you wish that the people on bicycles would leave you at least half the lane so that you could more easily pass?
nashville,3cbnra,illimitable1,6,Tue Jul 7 17:50:37 2015 UTC,"Yes.  So that when I pull ALL the way in to the other lane to pass, there actually IS three feet between my two ton vehicle and the cyclist.   I would think the cyclist would want that too.  But when they insist on riding side-by-side there's not three feet of space even when I am entirely in the other lane."

What bicycle advocates say, and I have no reason to dispute, is that per hour of use, you're more likely to get into a serious accident while driving than biking.   My sincere hope is that Nashville, and other cities like it, can do whatever is necessary to make the perception that cycling is dangerous-- and the not unrelated idea that people in cars have more of a right to be out there-- go away. Maybe it takes dedicated cycle tracks everywhere, or better education for those of us who drive. Dunno."

nashville,3ccyrw,Daniel_EJohnson,30,Mon Jul 6 23:08:05 2015 UTC,"Id just like to put some things in perspective here.  To compare Los Feliz & brooklyn to here is almost comparing apples and oranges.  LA has a population of over 3.8 million.  Brooklyn has a population of 2.5 million.  Nashville has a population of not even 700k.  Its just not a similar market when it comes populations.    Personally, I think you are insane if you are spending $1600-$2000 a month in rent.  But thats me and my financial perspective talking.  Why do I think its terrible?  If you take home $40,000 a year, then seriously 60% of your income is spent on rent.  I personally think 40k is absolutely fine for a normal person with a steady job and actually the average household income in 2012 in davidson county was $43,399.    The average house value in 2012 was $164,200.  So really, you could purchase a home here and pay it off in under 10 years, or spend that money on rent.  But hey, if you want to shell out a $1500-$2000 in rent a month you go right ahead.  Id take your money too but understand that people who have lived in TN for awhile see the price gouge and thats why they speak up.  I guess really I dont see any problem with them asking that much for rent.  I just think people are dumb for paying it."

nashville,3ccyrw,KiIIYourself,20,Tue Jul 7 15:07:01 2015 UTC,"You realize that Nashville doesn't compare at all to the cities you mentioned right? Brooklyn has a world class food scene and public transportation into Manhattan and is entirely walkable. Los Feliz (Where I lived once upon a time) is the same way, and is located basically in the best part of LA to get nearly anywhere. My rent in Boston (a very long time ago) and Chicago was less than I'm paying now, and those cities have a similar level of dining/art/public transit/amenities as the other cities above.  Nashville is at best a B city, with D level public transit and walkability, and C level dining/amenities, commanding A level rent prices. That's why people are pissed. (The music/art scene here was great but seems to be tapering off with the addition of all the transplants and the rise in rent.)  And the people who made East great? They may have been transplants, but they were artists and people willing to take risks because you could cover your living expenses with $600/mo. No one is running out to start a new restaurant venture when you have a mortgage on a $400,000 1500 sq/ft house, and artists aren't moving to places with $1,200/mo rent.  This is why Detroit's art scene is absolutely BOOMING right now.  EDIT: And just so you know, you are on the WAY cheap end of East Nashville rent at this point. Consider yourself lucky.

I'm seeing 1 bedroom places pop up in places like 12th south, and downtown for what I was paying in lower east side (Manhattan) back in 2003.  $2300 in Nashville???  Crazy.   Someone in this thread mentioned supply and demand, and that's really it. So many people are moving to Nashville these days(I keep reading Nashville is the new ""It"" city all over the place), that's driving up the prices.   I blame music, celeb centric culture, TV show, and the growing business  population in Nashville.   The side benefits are good - New fantastic restaurants, more cultural events, etc etc. But long story short, I don't think the benefits justify the price yet*.   They will but, not yet.   I would hate to be a young family in Nashville right now making average income. It's why so many are moving further and further outside of metro."

nashville,3ccyrw,sunny_bell,6,Tue Jul 7 21:47:08 2015 UTC,"Not including taxes, someone earning around $40k a year would be bringing in around $3300/m.  If you remove $1500-2000 of that for rent, this person will not be able to afford much else.  Median income in Nashville is just under the national average, so around $52,000 a year per household, which is generally defined as dual income.  The safe rule is that housing should be no more than 30% of your income, which would put that at around $1300/m.  I would say that finding a reasonable rental in Davidson county in a minimally desirable area for a family of 3 or 4 is going to be very hard to do at around $1300/m.  In a high desirable area at best you will find a 1 room condo for that amount.  Second to this is the fact that rent keeps going up year to year.  There is little stability right now in rental prices, so even if you find the perfect house, in an area you want to live that rent is unlikely to stay at the same rate for more than two years."

I think the problem with any city that has low rent is that it's only a matter of time before it starts to gentrify and rent goes up.   Honestly, though, we owe a lot to gentrification for Nashville becoming what it is today. Outside of Broadway, and the existing culture that was here before Nashville became the ""it"" city, I've heard that East wasn't at all what it is today. A lot of the cool neighborhoods and trendy areas turned into that because of transplants.  I hear people talking all the time about how the Nashville 15 years ago was so much better. Now, I'm a transplant myself, so I can't really get mad about the growth. However, I don't understand how/why people get mad about transplants ""ruining"" their hometown."

nashville,3ccyrw,cumyounut,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:20:34 2015 UTC,"One of the main reason why rent is going up is because of the demand for rental properties. In the past year there are more people looking to rent closer downtown than there are places to rent. Also, a lot of people want to rent from an apartment community opposed to renting from a private landlord. This allows property management companies to keep increasing rental amounts. In addition to the increase  of demand; new residents want nicer and newer appliances. Since most property management companies try to provide things to attract new prospects, the company must provide these products. This also increases the base rent. Also and most obvious, since Nashville is becoming so popular, the taxes and property values are going up. This again will increase the rental amount. I work for a property management company, and do market survey for south nashville area. If a company uses Yieldstar for they resident system, and the property if close to 97-98% occupied then the rental amount will be higher than average. The property i work at, we set the rental amount in January for the year. By the end of the year our prices are low to mid range."

(no sarcasm)  Centennial Park has been mentioned a few times that should certainly be on your list, the Lane Motor Museum is one that's often overlooked. The Bicentennial Mall is also really cool, but more a place to eat lunch and Cheekwood should certainly be worth considering.  Nashville, in the 20 or so years I lived there, really shines with it's downtown and bar areas, there are tons of places to do Karaoke and the live music scene is fantastic.  If natural beauty is what you're into I'd suggest checking out Radnor Lake, Percy Warner, and for a bit of history the Belle Meade Plantation and perhaps Belmont Mansion.  Lastly I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the sticky it's far from perfect but there are some good ideas there.  -Have fun!"
nashville,3cdgch,Sheriff_Shitface,5,Thu Jul 9 04:59:04 2015 UTC,"Opry Mills was made for your parents. So many chain stores and restaurants right next to the grand ol' opry. There's a theater there as well, which might help you kill a few hours. Check out the Opryland hotel while you're in the area; there's a river walk inside with fountains, restaurants, and boat rides. It's like being outside, but not. Your parents will be safe from nature there.  You could also go on a tour of Hatch Show Print, which does those iconic music show posters you see everywhere.   I feel like your parents would like Sperry's restaurant on Harding, but check the prices first.  Go downtown and walk around Broadway during the day. At night it might be too fun/smokey."
nashville,3cdgch,Hubbardd,8,Tue Jul 7 11:39:07 2015 UTC,"Your parents sound white bread as fuck.   Go to a songwriters night at the Bluebird. Check Parnassus Book's calendar and see if there are any author events that look interesting. Go to a Sounds Game, the stadium is brand new. Do they like beer? We have a few breweries within walking distance of one another."

(My dad is very much a homebody who isn't comfortable traveling, but we've managed some great trips, because he is willing to compromise.) Where are you staying?    Opryland/Opry Mills are good suggestions. The Opryland Hotel has nice indoor gardens, which probably aren't ""nature/outdoors.""   For historical tours, there's The Hermitage, Belle Meade Mansion, the Parthenon, and the museums listed. The Frist Center is also a nice art museum (current big exhibit is post-WWII Italian fashion). You could/should also tour the Ryman.   Hillsboro Village might be ok to walk around, though it's fairly small. The Belcourt is an independent movie theater. The Mall at Green Hills is the upscale mall, or you could drive south to Cool Springs Galleria and the surrounding stores."
nashville,3cdgch,andrewhy,2,Tue Jul 7 14:48:53 2015 UTC,"What is interesting to them about travel, and Nashville in particular?   They just want to go for the whole country music deal. That's about it.   Why even leave home at all?   I wish I had an answer. I think they like the idea of going on vacation, but don't like it when things get too different. Generally, when we go somewhere, they'll go to the one or two sights that they want to see, and then sit outside on lawnchairs drinking and playing Facebook games for the rest of the trip. That's their idea of a perfect vacation.   Where are you staying?    At an RV park (and, yes, I know the fact that they own an RV is a big ball of irony); I'm not sure which. There are a lot of details of this trip that I'm in the dark on unfortunately; they planned this trip without telling anyone else and sprung it on us last week.  I might sneak off and check out that art exhibit, though. That sounds really interesting. I'll also definitely look into the places you recommended for shopping!   Unfortunately public settings where people are expected to be quiet are probably not going to work if we go as a family. My mother tends to yell, talk over people, and just make a general ass of herself -- normally this isn't an issue in touristy places, but she's been known to do it at movie theaters. :("

And like many here said, Opry Mills, maybe the General Jackson or a Grand Ol Opry tour/show.  Green Hills Mall too, take them to a movie or something.

For renting 1,400 square feet of a reasonable apartment or house (well-maintained, in a safe area, close to the 440 loop) I'd be prepared to pay at minimum $1,200 a month. That's for your standard 2BR/1BA setup, no frills. If I was really out for somewhere I wanted to live and price was less of an object, it'd go up quickly- probably slow down around $1,800. At 60k a year that price point will seriously hamstring saving for a house and enjoying life at the same time depending on your other recurring expenses.  I'd suggest that you ring up some of the places you see advertising rentals during business hours and simply ask what they charge. I've had much better luck on the phone than scouring websites."

It really just depends on what your standards are, but paying 1800 for a two bedroom is more than I'd ever dream of paying.

It's all about how stylish or ""nice"" you want your neighborhood to be. Some neighborhoods, like the gulch or the area right around five points, add a surcharge for trendy.

I went to the Jack White show in January with a general admission ticket. I got there an hour or so before and there were three lines down the building (3 out of the 4 doors). I saw the 4th door had no line so I walked up to it. After about 15 minutes I realized that door was specifically for people with special tickets (early entry, boxes, etc). So, my plan of attack was to slowly ease myself into the next line, which I successfully did over the next 40 minutes.   While that may not apply to you, the next part will. When you get through the door, the GA tickets are mad dash. Most people run into the first entry to the arena and a big line starts there because they check tickets before you get on the floor to get to the stage. However, they have attendants at every entry to the floor around the arena. So, if you'll go to the second or third entry portal the line will be much shorter where they check your tickets and you'll be more likely to be first to the stage."

As a former fat person I can attest to this fact. And that's without taking into consideration honesty into the the equation. I lied to my past personal trainers because I was already ok with lying to myself.    Honestly I don't care about your opinion on my honest but bitter advice. We don't need any advice to be sugarcoated.  OP, it is not my intention to shame you. I just want you to understand that fitness isn't temporary. You need to make lifestyle changes to truly benefit.

nashville,3ca2tp,copper_rainbows,8,Mon Jul 6 16:44:04 2015 UTC,"The most important step in losing weight is diet.  If you don't watch what you eat, you probably won't lose much weight no matter how hard you exercise.  Cut out the carbs for most meals.  Lean meat, low glycemic carbs like brown rice, and lots of fresh fruit, vegetables, and nuts.   Your body will only burn fat once it has exhausted its carb reserve, so you have to keep your body in a state of ketosis, or near so.  Exercise is secondary, but still important.  I switch between long-duration aerobic exercise (I run 10 miles in Centennial, 2-3 times a week during the summer) to burn through my body's carb reserve and keep it in a fat-burning mode, and a good muscle exercise (P90X is what I love, Tony Horton is an amazing coach, but right now I seem to be stuck doing ""Yardwork X/Housework X"" for a few more weeks).  Find something you love, something that's a challenge for you, and do it, and then keep doing it.  Between the diet and exercise I lost 20 pounds (190 -> 170) in 2.5 months last year."

If you're a new member (under 3 months) you can sign up with a trainer. 3 one on one sessions for 99$.  I did this recently and had a great trainer. Her name is Stephanie. She taught me the machines and helped figure out a program for me to continue on my own when our time was up.

Its a ways off, but you can easily see everything going up between L&C tower and the Batman building.  Makes for a quick get away, too.  If you're hardcore about fireworks you might be disappointed, but if you're kinda 'meh' like me, its perfect."
nashville,3c5xvy,37214,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:47:30 2015 UTC,Sounds like how we watched from the TBI hill off Hart Lane last year. I would have just thought the hill downtown is on would have blocked you from Centennial. Good to know.
nashville,3c5xvy,pwnicholson,9,Sun Jul 5 22:24:23 2015 UTC,A lot of it has to do with the humidity in the air. The humidity keeps the smoke trapped so that it can't disperse properly. Smoke particles bind to moisture droplets and it essentially turns into fog. This happened last year too.

nashville,3c5xvy,RabidMortal,4,Sun Jul 5 03:47:40 2015 UTC,Watched from the north near the new sounds stadium and had a pretty solid view. Especially the second half as the rain cleared.

nashville,3c5xvy,scroggs2020,3,Sun Jul 5 04:20:53 2015 UTC,I watched from there too. On Davidson under the Shelby street bridge. My new favorite spot. Great view and easy to get to and out of. The smoke accumulation was disappointing but I thought it only obstructed about 5 minutes of the 30ish minute display. Did miss seeing the music note firework and the color changing 'wave' firework they hyped.

nashville,3c5xvy,RAIKANA,3,Sun Jul 5 05:06:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I heard the smoke was bad from every direction. I ended up stopped on the side of 24 right behind the Stadium Inn, along with everyone else. So surprised I didn't see a wreck with all the idiots just pulling out in front of people and slamming on breaks to squeeze into spots. Would have been a perfect view if not for the low smoke. Still pretty entertaining though.   Edit: Before I get down votes from people telling me not to be an idiot, I was actually parked completely off the highway and just walked up to the side of the highway because it was on a hill and had the best view. Everyone who actually parked on the  shoulder of the highway are idiots and putting lots of people in danger. I saw way too many close calls from both people parked where they didn't need to be and people going way too fast on a wet highway full of people. Rant over."

NOW; the good part, people are nice and pretty polite from what I find, there is a great art scene for a city this size, some good bars (most bars here, however, are pretty new and somewhat too overthought: fellow Nashvillians - does that seem like a good description?) - and the people watching downtown is quite fantastic.

There are bean counters whose sole job it is to count how many times an artists' songs got played on the radio. There are managers. There are roadies and tour workers.

It also tells me they don't have to be good fundraisers or campaigners bc they don't need to beg for money.  These candidates were all employed or entrepreneurs before they ran for office.  Some are MORE successful than NFL players by simply running a business well or inherited money.    Rich candidates: BONE, FREEMAN, FOX, ESKIND  Not rich candidates: BERRY, GENTRY"

Idk, it seems a little ridiculous that granting a marriage license conflicts with one's beliefs. You're not officiating the wedding or participating in any personal way. You're a clerk. That's it!

nashville,3bwp4p,thisisntlemonade,35,Thu Jul 2 23:54:41 2015 UTC,"Um, good?    It amazes me that some Christians go brain-dead stupid about homosexuality as a sin.   Littering is also a sin, except littering actually affects me by making me pick up someone else's garbage, whereas whatever two consenting adults do in the privacy of their own home doesn't affect me.   But you don't see any stores banning litters, or holding protests at the courthouse against rednecks chucking beer cans out of their pickup truck.  It's not Christianity's fault.   I'm a Christian, and gay people are just people.  It's pseudo-Christians using the Bible to rationalize their own hatred.  They hated black people, then they moved to gay people, and I'm sure they have Top People working to find a new demographic to hate.  They need, desperately, to be able to hate someone, so they can be ""better"" than them.  Pharisees are just as active today as they were in Jesus's time."
nashville,3bwp4p,MetricT,16,Thu Jul 2 20:17:08 2015 UTC,"Plus, even all of this aside, even if you accept the premise that homosexuality is a sin, where do they get the idea that they have to RUN AWAY AND HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT, AAAAAAAAH!   Christians associate themselves with sinners all the time. That's sort of a key part of being a Christian. Even if you think homosexuality is a sin, you aren't engaging in or enabling homosexuality by putting paperwork through for a gay marriage license. You're just a bystander. You're the one doing the paperwork. Get over yourself."

That said, I also think they are being extremely silly. I wonder if they did the math as to just exactly how few same sex marriage licenses are likely to be applied for in a rural Tennessee county of 12,000.  I mean, it’s not like it’s going to same sex marriage licenses all day long.  Plus, thwy would just be putting the paperwork through, that’s all. It’s not like they're MAKING the marriage happen.  It’s not like they have to perform a ceremony or be a godparent to the couple's children. Put the paperwork through. Stamp it, file it, move on. Big deal."
nashville,3bwp4p,halfdiminished5,12,Thu Jul 2 21:32:38 2015 UTC,"Decatur County has a population of 11,661 as of 2013.  The marriage rate in the US is 6.8 per thousand per year, so that's ~80 marriage certificates per year.   In TN, 2.6% identify as LGBT according to Wikipedia, so that works out to 2 gay marriage certificates per year in Decatur County.  I can't help but wonder if there's another story going on here.  Gwen Pope is 58 and appears to have worked for local/state government for most of her life.  Maybe she has some kind of early retirement, or her husband does.   Or maybe she's exactly as dumb as she seems."
nashville,3bwp4p,MetricT,4,Thu Jul 2 21:58:06 2015 UTC,"That is an extremely valid point, especially when you consider most same sex licenses will likely be applied for in Knox, Shelby, Davidson and Hamilton counties. I imagine Decatur would have none for a year or two or possibly longer."

They feel that homosexual relations are morally wrong, so they stepped aside to let others legally marry those whom they could not in good conscience.  They did it correctly.

nashville,3c0a4k,Burnmeafterreading,2,Fri Jul 3 16:29:34 2015 UTC,"Most venues around here are going to want you to guarantee a turnout, or buy tickets upfront so they get money either way. It's hard to get a gig around here. The open mics have long, long waiting lists. If you're just here for one night I think that would be a waste of time. You'll wait for two hours to play, and then you'll get a two-song spot in front of all the other performers. Not a great gig.   Outside of Broadway, there's not really a market for open-mics, or venues for anyone who isn't already known. However, if you want to try something new you could reach out to coffee shops in town to see if you can play an acoustic show. Crema, Portland Brew, Ugly Mugs, Bongo Java might be prime for something like that.   Good luck to you!  Edit: spelling"

It may seem like splitting hairs, but the vocabulary used by these legislators shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the function of law.   This is not a federal statute, this is not a federal initiative. This is constitutional law. The Supreme Court held that our state law was UNCONSTITUTIONAL under the 14th Amendment to the United States constitution. It isn't about voting or not voting. The Supreme Court gets to interpret the Constitution. If a law is violative of the Constitution, it is invalid and cannot be enforced, no matter how many people vote for it."

It's too big a hammer to swing precisely, and there are too many people who are ""nominally religious"" when talking about enforcing human rights but who will become ""rabidly religious"" when you start talking about legislating what their churches can and can't do.

If a business can prove it contributes to the good of society and that no one profits monetarily from their works, only then can we consider eliminating any unfair tax burden that a business might incur.

Because of that, we don't get live price tables for items in the store, so sometimes we come out in the green on covering delivery costs, and sometimes we just flat out don't. The membership aspect of our business is really what keeps us profitable, otherwise we'd make nearly nothing.

nashville,3bo1rp,must_find_truth,2,Wed Jul 1 03:09:22 2015 UTC,That's good to hear because Kroger is probably next on the list for Nashville. We're already working on it for other cities so it'll be easier to get it going there as well.
nashville,3bo1rp,ShiptGroceries,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:40:29 2015 UTC,$9 a delivery.
nashville,3bo1rp,TwistedDrum5,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:35:06 2015 UTC,"I've read that there is a $9 delivery charge.   Still, I know moms that would pay $9 on top of their $100 grocery bills every time.  Once a week is $36 a month plus adding in the yearly fee is $44.25 a month.  So they could spend $45 a month and save the time and hassle, if the mom has young kids.  But for a single guy like me...I can't afford to be that lazy.  edit: See the response below for the ""catch""."
nashville,3bo1rp,TwistedDrum5,2,Wed Jul 1 04:30:55 2015 UTC,"Hi, so the original version of Shipt, which was same day delivery from stores like Best Buy, did have a $9 delivery charge. Since we moved to grocery delivery we dropped that. As long as your order is $35 there is no delivery fee. If the order is smaller than that then there is a $7 delivery fee."

nashville,3bo1rp,browsilla,3,Tue Jun 30 20:55:21 2015 UTC,"Hi, I can at least answer your first question. Yes! We definitely plan on delivering alcohol with your groceries, although not right away. Tennessee has better laws surrounding alcohol delivery than Alabama so we're still working through that process. Hopefully it will be added to our inventory soon!"
nashville,3bo1rp,ShiptGroceries,3,Wed Jul 1 02:23:37 2015 UTC,Looks like there is $5 charge on a delivery of $35.  If I'm not mistaken that's like a 14.2% up charge for delivery right?  (math: 40/35 = 1.1428)
nashville,3bo1rp,GuyWhoCropDusts,5,Tue Jun 30 21:37:17 2015 UTC,"Talked with live chat, here is what they said on an order of $100.   It's not an exact percentage across the board. Sometimes our prices are actually lower than in store. We do not have live pricing data from the stores so our prices will different. On average you can expect to pay about $15 more than you would in store for a $100 order but it might be lower or higher depending on the make up of the order is."
nashville,3bo1rp,GuyWhoCropDusts,3,Tue Jun 30 21:38:19 2015 UTC,"This is spot on! Without live pricing from Publix we have a pretty good idea of what each item costs, but Publix can lower it and raise it on a whim. Sometimes we make a couple bucks on an order, and sometimes we make nothing. Having a membership allows us to keep markups to a minimum while still keeping our company in the green."
nashville,3bo1rp,ShiptGroceries,2,Wed Jul 1 02:51:34 2015 UTC,Are there any plans to partner with stores that will give you that access?
nashville,3bo1rp,dunstonchecksout,3,Wed Jul 1 05:16:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, absolutely. Basically we just want to be able to show that we're the real deal to these grocery stores when we go to them offering partnership. It will certainly make things a lot easier."
nashville,3bo1rp,ShiptGroceries,2,Wed Jul 1 12:39:29 2015 UTC,"So if you spend $100 on groceries per week, which my wife and I do, that adds $15 per week to our bill on top of the $99/yr charge.  So... $880 per year.  Plus, I'm sure they don't have to tell you about the sales/specials that could have saved you even more.  PLUS they don't offer everything in the store so you will likely still need to go anyway.  Some of you don't care about money as much as I do."
nashville,3bo1rp,AeroZep,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:56:14 2015 UTC,"You should be able to choose anything from the grocery store that you'd like to buy, and that will soon include alcohol once we have sorted out the licensing process for Tennessee. Our app also includes all of the buy one get one sales that Publix offers in it's weekly ad to help  keep your costs down."
nashville,3bo1rp,ShiptGroceries,2,Wed Jul 1 13:32:32 2015 UTC,"Ah, so we're just back to spending $880 more a year.  There are all kinds of other questions.  For instance: since this is a partnership with Publix, if I order a gallon of milk, am I going to get one of the gallons that expires in 6 days, or am I going to get the new ones that expire in 2 weeks?  If I order produce, is someone going to find me the apples without bad spots or the tomatoes that look fresher than the rest?  If I want ground beef, will I have any way of knowing there's a manager's special sticker on a few packages that would have saved me $2 since I'll be using it that night?  I know you're with the company, but I'm letting you know why I'm skeptical.  This seems like a great way to guarantee the stuff that Publix wants off the shelf first comes off the shelf first.  I get it, some people mow their own lawn and some people are willing to pay $20-30 every week of the summer to get it done.  If you're lazy and rich, this seems like another great service."
nashville,3bo1rp,AeroZep,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:50:49 2015 UTC,"We have no partnership with Publix right now and our only priority is making our customers happy. That means choosing milk the farthest date out, choosing produce that is fresh and free of bruises, and following any notes the customer has for the item, including savings like the manager's special. Those are things we cover in our shopper training to ensure customers are satisfied with our service. We certainly recognize that this service isn't for everyone, but the response we've had from customers has been great so far!"

My order was perfect and on time, my delivery person was very communicative and polite. Pretty pleased. My only complaint (hopefully /u/shiptgroceries sees this) is that the app kind of sucks. It doesn't keep you signed in and you lose your cart contents really quickly. It would be awesome to be able to build a list even over days, or at least hours. I have little kids and get a few minutes here and there and it sucked to lose where I was because someone threw turkey at their brother or whatever chaos is going on.

nashville,3brh6r,MetricT,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:54:17 2015 UTC,"16th District (Woodbine/Flatrock area) race is going to be tight. Tony Tenpenny is the incumbent - he's an incompetent, tea party jackass and the village idiot of the Nashville council. He grew up in the neighborhood and through his friendships and fear mongering he's managed to maintain support. Currently, he's striking fear into the neighborhood by making up stories about his opponent Mike Freeman. Example #1 is that he's told me and neighbors that Mike Freeman wants to move the fairgrounds. Mike Freeman has no interest in moving the fairgrounds and even if he did, he doesn't have the power to do that. Also, the fairgrounds are in the 17th district so I don't really give a shit.  Do a google search on Tenpenny and you'll see all the stupid shit he's done."

That's my area and I don't like having an ineffectual laughingstock as a councilman.  I take it that Tenpenny has been canvassing your area? If you still have access to a flier I would love to see it. I heard it was really negative.  I met Freeman and he seems very well put together, though not exactly seasoned or political, which might hurt him. It would be easy to get overconfident as Freeman if all you see is your facebook feed (a la 16th District Nashville), but there are parts of the district covered in Tenpenny signs that it doesn't appear that Freeman has knocked yet.  Slightly off topic, I wonder the coincidental name sharing between Mike and Bill Freeman will have any bearing on the election?"

My big concern is that Tenpenny's base is the senior population in the area, and for better or worse, that is always the one group of people you can guarantee is going to vote in the election.

No idea why I've suddenly been branded unreasonable for simply asking a reason an elected official suddenly changed their policy.  And I don't take that as a loaded question at all. I'm not sharpening my pitchfork or lighting up a torch. I'm genuinely curious because the initial post comes off as a bit inflammatory.
nashville,3bmcr3,kimay124,3,Tue Jun 30 20:54:04 2015 UTC,"This is just a change in practices for the county clerk's office. A law probably wasn't needed but perhaps they aligned the change with the date that law changes would go into effect (I am assume UR_Face knows what they're talking about with the date). This change in practice in NO WAY stops marriages from being performed in Williamson County. The county clerk's office will still issue marriage licenses, they just won't perform your ceremony. There are plenty of individuals authorized to do so in the state of TN. Perhaps it's because of the County Clerk's personal beliefs or perhaps it's because she just doesn't have time with the likely surge of people that will be wanting the get married quickly now that they are able to and instead of saying no to some she's just saying no to all. We'll likely never know. But again, that does not stop those individuals from legally getting married."
nashville,3bmcr3,phyloh,-2,Tue Jun 30 16:59:46 2015 UTC,"I fully understand the implications of this and that it doesn't affect certificates. My point was, there is no apparent law or ordinance in Williamson County that mandates this.  It's most likely an internal decision based on... Reasons?  In any event, I'd be asking them why the decided to stop doing marriages at this particular time."
nashville,3bmcr3,aDDnTN,2,Tue Jun 30 17:13:51 2015 UTC,"In any event, I'd be asking them why the decided to stop doing marriages at this particular time.   policy implemented because they are too busy to take the time to perform a ceremony. lots of hunting licenses to issue, etc. maybe they eliminated some employees so the overall workload is increased, making it impossible for the clerk to take the time to perform ceremonies. he is legally required to do his job and performing a legal marriage ceremony might be within his abilities, but isn't part of the job requirements.  Or the office might be full of hateful bigots. it's williamson county, your ire towards them is basically pissing up a tree!"
nashville,3bmcr3,phyloh,2,Tue Jun 30 18:19:11 2015 UTC,"Where did I express ire? I'd just like to know why.

It's a valid question."
nashville,3bmcr3,UR_Face,3,Tue Jun 30 20:10:35 2015 UTC,"Technically, the supreme court decision isn't effective immediately. The rules surrounding decisions say that they give the losing party 3 weeks to appeal, after that time it becomes legal. States are known to abide by the ruling immediately, given the likelihood that it is not overturned.

nashville,3bmcr3,cmonsmokesletsgo,9,Tue Jun 30 11:56:00 2015 UTC,"A lot of county clerk offices nation wide stopped performing (or started the process of no longer performing) marriage ceremonies in preparation for the SCOTUS ruling. This is an effort to prevent staff members who oppose gay marriage from being involved in the process outside of the bare legal minimum, probably to avoid the headaches that come along with unhappy and protesting staff. It's possible (though unlikely) that the Williamson county court clerks are no longer providing marriages for an unrelated issue, but the timing is suggestive."

nashville,3bmcr3,iTim314,9,Tue Jun 30 12:03:40 2015 UTC,"No, you CAN get your marriage license there, which is what is required to be married.

nashville,3bmcr3,shoppedpixels,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:17:01 2015 UTC,"If they are flat out refusing to license then they are refusing to do their job and you can hold them accountable. But if they are refusing to perform the ceremony then that's fine, it's within their right to do so for whatever reason.   I've been seeing the threads about some counties refusing strictly due to fight the Supreme Court decision. They are doing it in the wrong channel, sending the message to the wrong people. But what can you expect I suppose.   This one just seems like bad timing. I know a county back at my home put a post that they won't be performing ceremony until November, they put it up the day Supreme Court decision came out. But they also posted on their facebook and twitter explaining it's due to man hours and not because of legalizing gay marriage. They did it right by notifying the people."

On Sunday night I had to call three times because I kept losing signal to modem.  Ping times, when they were up, were in the 30s, very few spikes into the 100s but then I would just drop again.  The first few reps just refreshed the modem signal which worked for about an hour, until it dropped again.  Third tech diagnosed my modem as bad.  I need to switch it out soon.  But I haven't had an issue since.  I also called in on Saturday night and was told my ticket was being escalated and I'd get a call back within 24hrs.......still haven't gotten one.  I was about 3/4 through my data allowance as of yesterday, so that's not the issue.  It also pisses me off that you don't get a single case number, they kept giving me new ones."

nashville,3boe8w,UR_Face,2,Tue Jun 30 23:50:35 2015 UTC,"When you go to the fireworks, everything is shot off near and on the stadium so the best places to watch (though very crowded) are on the bridges over the river.  You may want to get there a few hours early and park in the huge public parking lot at the end of the bridge closest to the stadium.  There is a fee to park there, something like $5.  Bring a cooler and blanket with you and get yourself a spot on the bridge; lots of people come with friends and do that.  Have seen people drinking beer but you probably have to be sneaky about it.  This year Nashville is going to have the biggest show in the country, so don't be surprised if you feel like you're packed into the crowd like a sardine.  Have no idea what's going on at bars after the fireworks, but I'd steer way clear of Broadway.  As soon as the show ends, everyone moves onto Broadway.  It would take forever to get drinks and it'd be pandemonium.  I'm partial to The 5 Spot and Drifters in East Nashville for drinks, but they may not have anything special going on that night.  You could check and see if any special events are being held at venues like Exit/In, Marathon Music Works, War Memorial Auditorium, or Mercy Lounge.  Hope you find something good to do!

nashville,3bknvj,mpelleg459,2,Wed Jul 1 04:02:46 2015 UTC,"I have had successes and serious failures going to the fireworks. Here is what I learned:   (1) Avoid Rolling Mill Hill up by Pinewood Social. I thought this was a BRILLIANT idea, and it is a very good perspective. Unfortunately, everybody else had the same idea. The tiny streets and poor layout over there was a complete nightmare. Two hours of traffic jams. Misery.  (2) Park on the east side of the river and walk over the bridge into downtown. That way you avoid the traffic in and around downtown. You walk back over the bridge, hop in your car, and you are right by the interstate.  (3) If you want to avoid downtown all together, check out East Park. It has a great party and a good view of the fireworks without as much of the traffic/parking headaches."
nashville,3bknvj,halfdiminished5,3,Tue Jun 30 13:39:51 2015 UTC,(3) is terrible advice.  Everyone stay away from east park. EVERYONE.

nashville,3bihwt,frostfromfire,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:14:09 2015 UTC,The bar ghost tour was very lame. The historic ghost tour of downtown was really cool and enjoyable. Especially if you arent that familiar with the downtown area. It is more or less a great excuse to walk around downtown. And it ends at printers alley so hop into fleet street pub and have a pint or two when it's over.

nashville,3bjln9,-packrat,2,Mon Jun 29 22:38:30 2015 UTC,"Y'know, the prices were such that the guys I shopped with didn't do much checking around, AND THEY BOUGHT CASE LOTS.  But, to be honest, I have no idea what the ""floor price"" on various types of fireworks are.  The store is set up like an old general store, and the shopping carts are true antiques, just one size up from the Barbie kind, and were probably bought off a scrap pile forty or so years ago.  In my experience the folks were great to talk to (could've been the repeat customerage) and if you are in the area you might want to go in to see what they have around the place--some worn antiques, some very brown newspaper clippings of local history--what a Cracker Barrel would look like without a corporate decorating budget.  But do some tire kicking on some staple items and see.  If you're buying a grocery bag of bottle rockets and firecrackers, it doesn't matter too much if you're paying 120% of bottom dollar.  If you're loading a frame with 20,000 bottle rockets you can argue for case price. (random video from the internet to show mass consumption)"

You can have anyone become an ordained minister at the universal life Church website for free.   I don't know what people charge, because I just do it for free."
nashville,3bi09l,TheOtherRedditorz,4,Mon Jun 29 12:41:30 2015 UTC,"UNIVERSAL LIFE MINISTERS ARE NOT APPROVED OFFICIANTS.  There was a TN Attorney General's opinion on this several years ago.  While you might get away with it, I personally don't plan to take any chances.  I think our marriages are going to get extra scrutiny, so I am following the law very carefully.  Here's what's in the statute:   All regular ministers, preachers, pastors, priests, rabbis, and other religious leaders of every religious belief, more than 18 years of age, having the care of souls. Current and former members of county legislative bodies. County mayors/executives and former county mayors/executives. Current and former judges and chancellors of this state. Current and former judges of general sessions courts. The governor. The county clerk of each county. Current and former speakers of the senate and speakers of the house of representatives. Mayors of municipalities.   I found this resource helpful."
nashville,3bi09l,jerri-blank,3,Mon Jun 29 13:37:40 2015 UTC,"Universal life is not an issue.  It fits under number 1 above.  Also, here in Nashville, they are not allowed to ask what your official role or title is.  There was a challenge years ago in certain counties, but, universal life members perform marriages all over the state with no issue."
nashville,3bi09l,SkepticalConspirator,5,Mon Jun 29 14:31:08 2015 UTC,"The main issue is that the  clerk cannot ask...but if you tell them, they can give you trouble."

I mean, do you what you want - you're probably not going to get caught if you use a non-sanctioned officiant.  But it's not that hard to get someone who's clearly legally eligible to do it."
nashville,3bi09l,jerri-blank,2,Mon Jun 29 15:21:27 2015 UTC,"It's hard when you don't know anyone there. That's what I'm getting at. We only know two people there, and we only want someone to sign it for us. We've been together for ages, and know how we feel. But anyway"

nashville,3bi09l,Hubbardd,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:00:24 2015 UTC,"Again, a county clerk has neither the authority or duty to ask for the qualifications of the officiant.

nashville,3bfmtk,lfgbrd,2,Sun Jun 28 23:12:25 2015 UTC,To think he would take air force one into Smyrna seems silly. What other airport can handle a jet that size in Nashville?
nashville,3bfmtk,Breaking-Good,2,Mon Jun 29 00:53:57 2015 UTC,"I fly out of the two every day. There's really no advantage to going into Smyrna. They might have gone into Smyrna to avoid closing down BNA but in an emergency most pilots wouldn't care what they shut down, just give them the longest runway with the biggest fire truck.  Smyrna's 14/32 is 8050 feet.  Nashville has 7700, 8000, 8000, and 11000.   Smyrna regularly has a 747SP (the short version) in, but I believe I've seen some of the regular sized 747's there in the past. A fully loaded 747-400 needs almost 10,000 feet to take off and about 7500 to land, but those numbers can be greatly reduced by simply reducing the weight. A VC-25 (Air Force One) is of a similar configuration.  Either way, the TFR is already posted over BNA."

Would have gotten you there as you were barely coherent and he kept saying (sloshed himself) that he was driving you home, but the bouncer we tried to ask for help from started threatening us.  Got you guys a cab and honestly don't know if you're dead now.  Your friend started yelling about how he was a veteran or some shit which just pisses me off because my active duty tipsy husband was the one trying to take care of you while your ""friend"" appeared to be fine letting you potentially die while at the same time trashing us for not letting you lay there--and at the same time, trashing us for not treating him respectfully because he was in uniform at some point.

Although I doubt he's actually awake yet.  In retrospect probably should have just called the cops and let them deal with it as we were getting yelled at for narcing anyway (which is probably where I pissed off the bouncer when I asked if he was drunk because how is a cab to a hospital a cop?), but...hindsights a bitch and you don't really think about that at two in the morning."
nashville,3bdwg1,onewaybackpacking,6,Sun Jun 28 18:41:33 2015 UTC,Wow. Hope he's ok. You guys are awesome for helping out. Was downtown myself tonight and it was a zoo.
nashville,3bdwg1,frostfromfire,2,Sun Jun 28 10:28:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've never been downtown Nashville before and I think it would be more fun if we weren't dehydrated and exhausted from hiking and caves all weekend haha.   Coyote Ugly was fun for about five minutes until it clicked how pervy half the guys were being and how exhibitionist-desperate half the girls were (split evenly, girls up on the bar and skeevy dudes staring at them eating it up on the other side of the room. Everyone else in the middle.  I see the appeal it just got weird quick.  Some of the other bars were great though! I thought we'd be able to find one that had original music artists playing but we didn't look hard enough I guess. It's a little blah to hear covers (good covers! No problem with the covers) playing and then the singer remind you to tip them.  Overall 8/10, would do again and 1) actually call a cop in to take poisoned guy out and 2) probably let myself punch girl who grabbed hubby's ass instead of managing to keep it together and just leave the bar with everyone."

My husband's female co-workers take pictures hugging him for Instagram and he's been blatantly flirted with and touched (on the stomach and around the waist) at bars while I'm standing right next to him.  Glad to hear a messed up situation like that didn't ruin your time here.  Haven't been to Coyote Ugly and probably never will; it sounds awful.

If whatever shop you go to doesn't show you their sterilizing machine and guarantee you that everything touching your body has been sterilized, get up and go."

As a single guy who has lived and traveled all over I haven't seen as much jesus references in online profiles nor have I been dismissed because I wasn't christian. That's all.

nashville,3bg1yn,slayerslayer,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:08:17 2015 UTC,"What's interesting about this comment is that there seem to be two ways to interpret it ...and I'm okay with both.  Either you are saying that as a 'fellow' non-christian you have seen and experienced this phenomenon as well, or that you're indirectly giving kudos to a fellow Christian that has no interest in dating someone that doesn't share the same bond and view of religion."
nashville,3bg1yn,37214,5,Mon Jun 29 01:02:06 2015 UTC,I think if you're a christian then you should definitely try to meet a fellow christian because family and relevant beliefs are very important.  All I meant in my comment is that there are less people in my dating pool because of the christian population.  It's not something I complain about at all. I'm just not what they're looking for so I make it a point to highlight it early.

nashville,3beirm,Awarsen,11,Sun Jun 28 14:13:04 2015 UTC,Opry Mills is the only true IMAX in town.
nashville,3beirm,gunslingers,2,Sun Jun 28 14:14:39 2015 UTC,And they are only showing it in 3d.  The RPX is a good 2d substitute.
nashville,3beirm,infinitevalence,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:03:11 2015 UTC,"True. I enjoy 3D when the film was shot in 3D, not when it is a post-production conversion."
nashville,3beirm,gunslingers,2,Sun Jun 28 15:20:26 2015 UTC,"Genuinely interested, what are the other IMAX theaters? Why can they say that they are IMAX?"
nashville,3beirm,CheddarJalapeno,4,Mon Jun 29 01:38:07 2015 UTC,"So IMAX is both a format (15/70) and a brand. What IMAX has done is retrofit multiplexes that don't have room for a traditional IMAX 15/70 setup (Which are MASSIVE and VERY EXPENSIVE) with a digital one so that they can charge you more money for a ticket.   Traditional IMAX is shown on 15/70 film and has an aspect ratio of 1.44:1, Digital IMAX (or lieMAX) is shown on a screen placed closer to the audience using two Christie 2k digital projectors with proprietary image processing and with an aspect ratio of 1.9:1. Don't get me wrong, the digital setup is still a huge improvement in audio and picture quality from a normal digital theater, especially for 3D pics. The problem is they are charging the same amount for this digital ""IMAX"" experience as a real 15/70 screening. And no matter what people say, digital still can't touch the resolution of 70mm film.  Have a look at the comparison between a real IMAX 15/70 screen and the digital IMAX here. This is why people are complaining about paying more.  EDIT: Just know that traditional IMAX 15/70 is going the way of the dodo. Most of the large screens are going to eventually be converted to a new IMAX Laser digital projection system. Which while still good and extremely bright and vivid, is only a 4k image. (15/70 is roughly around 11k)  This is happening because of money and money alone. A single IMAX 15/70 print can run $10-20,000."
nashville,3beirm,Hubbardd,3,Mon Jun 29 03:25:26 2015 UTC,Thank you for the explanation.  I will make sure that I don't throw my money away.
nashville,3beirm,CheddarJalapeno,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:31:02 2015 UTC,"I used to work as a projectionist for Carmike. We didnt buy prints. We rented them.

nashville,3beirm,Daniel0745,0,Mon Jun 29 14:49:51 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about the cost to the studio to make an IMAX print, not the cost to the theatre to rent them."
nashville,3beirm,Hubbardd,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:58:04 2015 UTC,How big is the Big D screen at the thoroughbred theater in cool springs? Isn't it pretty similar size? I like going just for those high back leather seats as much as anything.
nashville,3beirm,Sirflow,0,Sun Jun 28 16:18:06 2015 UTC,"It's roughly the same size as an IMAX screen. The projection is going to be a lot different though, as 70mm film is equivalent to about 11-12k resolution and as far as I know, the real D theaters are only a 4k digital projection."
nashville,3beirm,Hubbardd,10,Sun Jun 28 20:08:10 2015 UTC,"Belcourt is obviously the best theatre in town, but if you're looking for imax, Opry Mills is the way to go. All others have fake imax."

Wear hiking shoes or comfortable sneakers. Not handicap friendly at all.  Also nifty: If you pass through the creek that's right beside the stairs, you'll be in Davidson County and it's an island called Mansker's Island. It was a beautiful wooded area before the flood.

It's so much better than Gallatin's by a looooooooong shot.   Everyone else seems to have covered the drinking spots, but they forgot to mention Vous Pours. It's a fancy liquor/high gravity beer store in the Indian Lake shopping mecca. They sell growlers of all kinds of beers, ales, IPAs... They allow you to try two testers before pouring one for you. Briarscratch Cottontown Brown is my favorite.  If you've got a free weekend, hit up Bledsoe Creek State Park in Gallatin/Castalian Springs. There's not a whole lot to that State Park other than some camping spots and a few short hiking trails.  Are you into history at all? There's a lot of old historical sites/homes  around Hendersonville. It's kinda creepy how many pre-civil war graveyards have businesses plopped right beside/behind them.  There's a really awesome spot in Hendersonville just outside of the Indian Lake shopping area. From Buffalo Wild Wings, head out to Indian Lake Boulevard. Stay in the left lane through the two stop lights. When you hit that first intersection with Stop 30, take a right. You'll drive past the Catholic church and keep going until the road hits a sharp curve. Turn left and be fucking careful. There are a lot of sharp turns. Keep going straight through the next 3 stay stop and head up a steep hill. Follow the road until ends. Turn your car around and enough a view of the Nashville Skyline from Hendersonville. :)"

Outdoors: Sander's Ferry Park (note the frisbee golf); all of the parks in Hendersonville. If you're a mountain biker, Lock 4 mountain bike trail has different routes depending on skill level and is highly rated.  You're probably aware of Old Hickory Lake, but there is also fishing and canoeing not too far away: Fishing; canoeing. There are a number of waterfalls and places to hike within 1 to 2 hours.  Depending on where you are in Hendersonville, it doesn't take long to get to downtown Nashville for bars, etc. There have been some discussions in this subreddit about bars. There's a discussion about non-touristy bars in Nashville here.  Beyond what you asked about:  Live on the Green will be happening in August and September. Be sure to check out shows at the Ryman Auditorium (Kraftwerk 3D, what?). I prefer the balcony because the sound seems to be better and those obnoxious poles aren't in the way.

nashville,3b8yt7,yolo_____swaggins,4,Fri Jun 26 23:03:21 2015 UTC,Who did you go with
nashville,3b8yt7,sziehr,2,Fri Jun 26 23:17:38 2015 UTC,"So. This is at my girlfriends. She went with u-verse. I think the cap is lower than Comcast but they don't charge you for going over unless you have DSL. She got faster, dedicated internet and all HD channels for the same price as Comcast's SD channels and shitty bogged down speeds. She also got rid of misc fees - like when she works from home and then is charged $70 because the technician came by to diagnose a problem and said she wasn't there. She's very glad to be rid of them and loves u-verse  edit: after reading other comments I feel like AT&T just ignores over-cap-charges in general."
nashville,3b8yt7,darktofu,8,Sat Jun 27 03:50:03 2015 UTC,"The problem is it's so slow you can't really get over the cap...  Kidding..   Sorta..  I wish, sigh."
nashville,3b8yt7,420Killyourself,5,Sat Jun 27 04:06:42 2015 UTC,We're all screwed until fiber gets here. But at least it's less bullshit than Comcast   edit: also where is my damn fiber shirt!?
nashville,3b8yt7,k3vk3vk3vin,2,Sat Jun 27 04:46:05 2015 UTC,You didnt get your shirt yet? Mine came in like 2 weeks ago
nashville,3b8yt7,Tehboognish,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:29:18 2015 UTC,I got my shirt while I was at Roo. So did all my friends that ordered one.

nashville,3b8yt7,King_Abe_Froman,3,Sat Jun 27 04:40:26 2015 UTC,You're disgusting. Ok.
nashville,3b8yt7,CurrentlyInHiding,6,Sat Jun 27 04:46:25 2015 UTC,"http://www.speedtest.net/  I want to see what her new, faster interet is."
nashville,3b8yt7,EditingAndLayout,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:51:54 2015 UTC,"Here you go.  She's paying for ""Max Plus"" which according to AT&T gets you speeds up to 18 Mb/second so she's getting a bit faster than what she's paying for."
nashville,3b8yt7,QuackerMTG,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:29:34 2015 UTC,1.94mb/s upload. That's pretty terrible.
nashville,3b8yt7,emptyshark,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:43:02 2015 UTC,"Maybe if you're streaming, but unless you're doing that, upload speeds aren't really that noticeable."
nashville,3b8yt7,EditingAndLayout,3,Sun Jun 28 04:45:41 2015 UTC,I've gone over the 300 GB cap every single month since I moved here . . .
nashville,3b8yt7,ot0,3,Sat Jun 27 02:50:30 2015 UTC,"I almost blew my top when they first implemented the cap. I mean, c'mon - is this Europe in 1997? Should we go back to being charged by the minute like with AOL?   Shit."
nashville,3b8yt7,YouMustRegulate,2,Sat Jun 27 12:03:35 2015 UTC,I just moved to the area and still on my first month. Is there anywhere I can check to see how much I've gone through?
nashville,3b8yt7,Cryp71c,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:22:22 2015 UTC,I think the website shows you.

nashville,3b8yt7,Cryp71c,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:13:38 2015 UTC,"Please tell who you are changing to. Xfinity sucks, but at least they have a higher data cap."
nashville,3b8yt7,chandleya,2,Sat Jun 27 00:21:18 2015 UTC,"Everywhere I have heard, AT&T doesn't really charge for their data caps. They're there in fine print for that jackass that has torrenting running all month and racks up a terrabyte worth of bandwidth."
nashville,3b8yt7,Cryp71c,2,Sat Jun 27 01:17:49 2015 UTC,"In certain states, TN included, AT&T has a 250GB data cap. That is the current cap in Nashville. Every additional 50GB you are charged a fee. Last time I checked, Comcast's fees were slightly lower for overage charges & your cap is 50GB larger. I don't like Comcast, but they are the lesser of two evils for me right now."
nashville,3b8yt7,malachus,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:42:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, AT&T does have a cap, but like I said, I've known dozens of AT&T users with either DSL (one or two) or UVerse and all have told me they've gone over this cap several times with no charges."
nashville,3b8yt7,EspressoRoast,2,Sat Jun 27 03:13:26 2015 UTC,Even comcastic gives you 3 strikes
nashville,3b8yt7,bargles,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:50:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, AT&T has a similar policy, again...no one has ever gotten any notices, strikes, etc. for overages.  Don't get me wrong, I'm still with Comcast because Uverse isn't in my area and doesn't have as good a speed as I'd like"
nashville,3b8yt7,UhhNegative,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:43:38 2015 UTC,"Back when we still had DSL a few years ago we got strikes and then switched to uverse for a larger cap and haven't gotten any since, despite the fact that I am fairly certain we exceed the cap now."
nashville,3b8yt7,bargles,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:38:24 2015 UTC,I download around 800GB monthly with UVerse. Never have been charged for it.
nashville,3b8yt7,Breaking-Good,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:45:55 2015 UTC,Have AT&T for years.  Never been charged an overage charge
nashville,3b8yt7,bargles,2,Sat Jun 27 01:47:54 2015 UTC,Maybe you've.... Never gone over the cap.
nashville,3b8yt7,chandleya,2,Sat Jun 27 02:38:33 2015 UTC,"If I've never gone over the cap, I'm not sure why anyone would need to go over the cap"
nashville,3b8yt7,CaptainInsane-o,3,Sat Jun 27 02:42:09 2015 UTC,They use the internet differently than you maybe? Maybe they watch all of their content on Netflix and Hulu.
nashville,3b8yt7,bargles,3,Sat Jun 27 03:11:46 2015 UTC,"I don't have cable. I watch all my content on hulu, netflix, and hbo now"

nashville,3b8yt7,I_AM_GOD_MAYBE,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:49:52 2015 UTC,"300 gigs isnt that much.    This is my past 3 months of usage:  http://imgur.com/0wsfHFK    And im currently within about 30 gigs of going over this month as well.  When you dont have cable and use the internet for work, movies, tv, music, etc... then 300 gigs really isnt much.  For example, software/games are no longer sold on CDs or other physical media really.  If you install few large pieces of software or download a large game you may easily be using 50-100 gigs of data in one transmission.  Comcast are pretty backwards with the way they run their service.  They arent selling internet access, they are selling 300gb of data then you pay more to use that data faster and pay even more when you use more than the 300gb."
nashville,3b8yt7,elephasmaximus,0,Sat Jun 27 12:31:45 2015 UTC,"The point I was trying to make was that I don't think AT&T is enforcing its data cap.  I've heard others say that in this sub.  I actually tried finding my data usage on my account page because I'm moving and having to switch to comcast, but I couldn't find a usage meter anywhere in my account."
nashville,3b8yt7,chandleya,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:42:29 2015 UTC,"I've had U-verse for almost 6 years and I've exceeded 250GB/month several times and I've never been charged or even notified. People here love to bitch about it being slower, but I ALWAYS have the speed I'm paying for and service has gone out maybe twice in 5.5 years."
nashville,3b8yt7,CaptainInsane-o,0,Sat Jun 27 18:34:21 2015 UTC,"But att charges fuckloads more for higher speeds, so I'd still much prefer comcast if I could take them."
nashville,3b8yt7,fifty2imeanfifty4,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:51:14 2015 UTC,"What's the process for cancelling Comcast? Do you have to give them some notice, or do you just pack up your equipment, take it to one of their offices and say sayonara?"
nashville,3b8yt7,QuackerMTG,2,Sat Jun 27 02:04:59 2015 UTC,Depends on contract..
nashville,3b8yt7,-packrat,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:50:28 2015 UTC,Not everyone has a contract. I pay month to month and am free to cancel at any time.

nashville,3b8m1n,gtzeke,8,Fri Jun 26 21:38:45 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. But also because every politician knew that this would be decided in the courts, none of them took any action. Even if someone was pro marriage equality, it's easier to just let it play out and not have to potentially upset anyone in your constituency. Which is playing politics and pretty shitty. Oh well."
nashville,3b8m1n,lawndart471,2,Fri Jun 26 22:20:14 2015 UTC,Also lucky that there was a court willing to do the legislators job for them. It's a sad sign of how our government operates now.
nashville,3b8m1n,timotheus911,0,Fri Jun 26 23:36:42 2015 UTC,"I don't often say this, but this is EXACTLY how our government is SUPPOSED to operate... 3 Branches. This wasn't a matter of legislating new law as much as it was interpreting existing law. The courts didn't do anyone else's job but their own.   No one, including me, likes this Congress, but there was no requirement that they go and make a new law specifically for this. It was truly up to someone to interpret what existing law meant."

I can call you a cracker because your white skin reminds me of saltines... and wonder bread, and sand, or white grapes. The Nword has history and deep hateful meaning behind it. Racism doesn't equal name calling dude, racism is denying someone a job because you dont like their skin color, its walking into an elevator and noticing the white woman clutching her purse tighter, its getting shot while running because officers seem to think the only time or reason a black man can run is because he has just committed a crime. Its not letting your daughter marry someone because you see her boyfriend as dirty or because you prefer having white grandchildren THATS RACISM  not getting your feelings hurt after being called cracker"

nashville,3b93k3,upthatknowledge,-1,Sat Jun 27 13:15:05 2015 UTC,Huh. I pass this statue every day on my way home for work and always thought it was kind of a poorly done statue. And seeing the confederate flag controversy I wondered the other day if that statue was related somehow. I never really paid attention to the flags since I pay more attention to the roads than random things on the side of the road.  Kinda crazy to think that the random mental connection my brain made was correct
