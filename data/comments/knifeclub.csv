It feels very solid.  It came pretty sharp but it's shaving hair after a very quick strop.  After loosening the pivot screws a bit, the blade flips out smoothly and easily.  I expected nylon washers but the look to be bronze.  My only complaint, if any, is that it's a tad on the heavy side.  That may just be because I've grown accustomed to the Manix 2 LW.  A little drilling of the liners should fix that.  I'm very pleased considering the $14 price tag.  This should be my beater blade for quite a while."

Over all I've had 9 different ZT's  and I'll say that as good as the regular ones are, they are not even close to being on the same level as the limited edition knives. The designs in particular are just on another level, especially when compared side by side with their ""production equivalent"" like the 0452 for example, or the 0770.

It had been unused for quite a while and had turned pretty much green with old gunk and dirt. I cleaned it and keep it with me now. All of the tools still work and are very, very sharp. Just the unfolding is a little tough with the smallest knife.  I'm very curious as to what brand this might be, but no biggie if you guys don't know! I thought you might appreciate this piece."

knifeclub,3e32wf,madrigal50,3,Tue Jul 21 16:10:41 2015 UTC,"If you're on a budget, I think the CRKT Squid is a better value for $20. Here's why -   Black wash finish steel > black coating and g10  Frame lock > liner lock  $20 > $40  CRKTs deep carry pocket clip > Spydercos standard clip  I personally like the Squids hollow grind spear point blade shape > the tenacious family's ffg leaf shape.  The Squid is hefty and strong, but nice and small.  I used to have the tenacious, and it was too big, wide, and sharp looking for me to use in public.   They both have the same steel 8cr13moV. It's pretty good. Doesn't hold an edge as long as most of the new steels.   The squid has a better lanyard hole, and I like the extra strength of the backspacer.  The tenacious is tougher, easier to open, has the nice Spyder hole, and might slice better.  The Squid is designed by a great custom knife maker Lucas Burnley. The Tenacious is just Spydercos budget design. They are both made in China however. Probably the same factory lol!  http://imgur.com/aLhn6E1"

knifeclub,3e0krt,blitz331,3,Tue Jul 21 12:59:51 2015 UTC,"I can only give my thoughts on what I own.  I think the PM2 might be as close to perfect as a mid-range production knife comes. Everything feels premium and well designed. Lockup is really strong, blade cuts really well, and deployment is buttery.  The manix2 is another decent choice, but it is very big in the pocket. The ball bearing lock is super stiff at first and might be a turn off.  The dragonfly2 is a favorite due to its small size and light weight. You can get ZDP-189, but good old VG10 will be cheaper, and is still really adequate.  Lastly, the techno. This is really new to me at this point, so I can't say a lot, other than, fit and finish wise, it might be the best spyderco I've seen. Lockup is strong, blade is super chunky, and it cuts really well so far. Not much bigger in the pocket than the DF2, either."

Having a lot of blades I never used, fotated near daily, or didn't love carrying wasn't doing it for me any longer. I've decided to carry the Brous until it is beat to hell and back a few times.   As for the TLC:  It had bad action, sharp jimping, a huge burr, and minor up/down blade play when locked. Problems with the gen 1 Bionic were varied. The previous owner did a swell job on the jimping on the handle, but i further smoothed it and the jimping on the blade. Fixed the action with a little rem oil, a ton of compressed air, and hours of flipping. Sharpened completely to eliminate burr and  put a nice low edge with a good secondary bevel. So far the minor blade play still exists, but you only feel it if holding the blade and handle and wiggling up and down.   However, now I love it. Super fun to flip and slices with ease."

knifeclub,3dzawf,TheCaptainR,3,Mon Jul 20 19:16:56 2015 UTC,"Don't just look at super-steels, look at edge geometry. The Adams has a saber grind and is pretty fucking thick, right? It's supposed to be a hard-use kind of knife, so the edge geometry might work against it being great for slicing things all day.   You might want to look at something with a full-flat grind that was ground down from thinner stock, honestly. If you're not prying or batoning, if you're actually cutting with this thing a lot, you can get a thinner, 'lighter' use knife that will stay sharp for a while. Just pick up an Opinel No. 8 and see how that does ;)  But seriously, it might be better at slicing all day. Cheap experiment, at least."
knifeclub,3dzawf,flat_pointer,2,Mon Jul 20 21:56:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, its a pretty thick heavy blade. Excuse my ignance, but why does a thinner blade lead to the edge staying sharper longer?"
knifeclub,3dzawf,flat_pointer,2,Tue Jul 21 04:26:41 2015 UTC,"They're not directly related - the thin FFG on a Swiss Army Knife doesn't make the 420HC steel stay sharper longer, it just means that the knife itself is easier to push or saw through things.   Think about using an xacto knife. Now imagine you have an xacto knife and a Elmax doorstop you ground an edge onto. Elmax steel will retain its shape for longer than the 'surgical steel' or whatever the xacto knife is made of. But it's going to be harder to push through a piece of cardboard or the like because you have a wide wedge behind the edge. You're not just slicing, you're wedging. A thin blade means you don't have to wedge things apart once you're past the edge. And even when the edge is dull, the secondary bevel behind it isn't exactly impossible to get through things."

It carrys very well for its size, and I like that the tip is in line with its center mass like a spear point.  The can opener at work was broken a few days ago so I used my Contego to cut a can of tuna open because I was hungry. The edge that was used to cut the can open was still shaving sharp with very minimal damage afterwards. I wouldnt recommend replacing your real can opener for a Contego, but its nice to know that it can take a little abuse and laugh it off like it was no big deal."

knifeclub,3dzawf,tehoose,2,Tue Jul 21 02:13:13 2015 UTC,"Steels will vary in edge retention, mostly based on their heat treatment.

Properly heat treated S90V, CPM3V/4V, 10V, S110V, CTS204p/M390 will be the top of the range. Some Japanese steels such as Cowry X and some of the steel Rockstead uses have proven to be exceptional as well. Additionally, like others have said, blade geometry plays a huge part as well."

knifeclub,3dzawf,accountonphone,2,Mon Jul 20 22:09:49 2015 UTC,"A lot depends on the sharpening media, sharpening method, heat treat, blade profile, etc. I would recommend you browse through Ankerson's edge retention thread over at BladeForums for a larger context. He's put in years of work, and in fact, he's since altered his testing procedure to account for that sort of thing.  If you're looking for high edge retention while still being relatively easy to sharpen, I would stay away from ZDP and S90V, and look instead to M390. IMO it's not terribly more difficult to sharpen than S30V, while still giving you great edge retention. Plus it's become much more widely available within the past couple years. You mentioned M4, which is a joy to sharpen because it doesn't readily develop a sizeable burr, the only drawback is that it's not stainless. And while Elmax is a nice steel, you wouldn't see as big a jump over D2 as you would with the other steels."

knifeclub,3dvkph,Lubanski0796,2,Sun Jul 19 22:02:02 2015 UTC,Ordered some accessories to take care of my knife. I really thought about what people where telling me in my last thread that I should learn everything I can with my first knife. That way by the time I order my next one I'll be more inclined to maintain it.
knifeclub,3dvkph,maflickner,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:04:24 2015 UTC,"I have the same things! Well, not the rat. But tuff glide and my lansky are go tos.  Although I would really reccomend a strop on top of it. It helps so much. It takes your knife from ""this is pretty sharp"" with the lansky to ""holy balls this glides thru paper"""
knifeclub,3dvkph,Antlered_Ostrich,2,Mon Jul 20 01:25:04 2015 UTC,I actually have a strop sitting in my Amazon wish list as we speak. I'm just waiting until Friday to put in my order.

knifeclub,3dvkph,Antlered_Ostrich,2,Mon Jul 20 03:40:56 2015 UTC,You should really make the step. I banged up my RAT 1 a little bit since I got it. I even had to cut through a braided steel security tag on a watch at my work due to lacking any better tool for the job. It got the job done but at a cost for a ding in the blade's grind. The diamond stones included in this kit took care of my problem in ~20 strokes. Then after finishing up on the ceramic stones I could glide through paper like it was butter again.
knifeclub,3dvkph,Antlered_Ostrich,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:38:37 2015 UTC,That's awesome. What system exactly is it that you use? And do you strop your blades too?
knifeclub,3dvkph,Antlered_Ostrich,2,Mon Jul 20 16:00:42 2015 UTC,It's called the Lansky Turn Box. There are two models. One that comes with two sets of ceramic stones and the verison I have that comes with a pair of diamond stones and a pair of ceramic stones. I currently do not strop but will start this upcoming Friday. I already have my desired strop picked out.

knifeclub,3duord,Pickle_Slinger,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:33:41 2015 UTC,"Is sharpening with sandpaper an effective method? Never even considered it, but it sounds plausible."
knifeclub,3duord,Chadzy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:10:27 2015 UTC,"YES! Very effective. You can normally start with 600 grit (lower grit if it's a really dull blade), and have it on a flat, hard surface. Some people use  ceramic bathroom tiles & spray adhesive to fix the sandpaper on. I normally will do that or just put it on a hard piece of wood. Use the same sharpening technique that you would use as if you were sharpening with a stone. Try to use wet/dry sandpaper so you can use water to lubricate and wash away the metal particles. Work your way up grits from 600, to 800 to 1,000 (higher grits can be found at your auto shop, like the 1,000, 1,500, 2,000 & even 3,000. You can get even higher grit sandpaper like 4k, 6k, and 12k at hobby shops (I went to the Hobby Lobby). It works really well, whether you want to sharpen a dull knife or just hone a already sharp knife to hair popping sharp with a mirror finish. Follow this up with a leather strop and appropriate compound, and you are set!"

knifeclub,3duw39,usmcknifeguy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:19:35 2015 UTC,I just ordered a 0562 and am really looking forward to it. I've been needing a new flipper since I got my Southard a few months back.
knifeclub,3duw39,justanothershell,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:40:25 2015 UTC,"If it means anything to you, I've sold all of my ZTs (I peaked at about 8 of the popular ZT folders) and ended up with 2 XM-18s - one 3.5"" spearpoint and one 3"" spanto. They don't feel the same, but ZT isn't at all a bad choice. I just figured that if you had a $500 soft cap on your budget, you could snag an awesome XM-18.  CRK is great - I wouldn't get a Sebenza 25 though (hopefully I don't get scolded by the 25 fans). Stick to the Sebenza 21 and buy used to save ~$100 and still get a like new 21. I like the 21 because it's a no frills knife, and is the easiest-to-disassemble knife I've ever owned. Being able to disassemble, clean, and reassemble by yourself adds to my pride of ownership. Aside from that, it's a very well thought out design.  To be honest though, there are more fancy modern midtechs out there, or even customs if you go for the less expensive ones, that I would consider nicer than a Sebenza (in some aspects), like the Southard Avo/Tolk or any Shirogorov, but I would never let go of my 21 if I got a fancier knife.  Also, an XM-18 is not $300 more expensive, at least not anymore. Check BladeForums and it'll be easy to find a like new XM-18 for $375-425."
knifeclub,3duw39,justanothershell,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:11:12 2015 UTC,"Definitely things to consider. Thank you. If I could find an XM for bottom-tier Sebenza money, I'd definitely do that."

knifeclub,3duw39,LuckyD93,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:06:04 2015 UTC,"To be honest I don't own any ZT's, but their fit and finish is awesome. It's cool knowing that each of them is worked on by Elliot and his brother Chris, doing all of the tweaking to the detents and lock up, sharpening and other custom touches like the anodizing on the frames and custom pivots. Elliot is a true student of the craft of knife making so you know that heat treat and everything is done right. They only make 100 of each of the runs then that model is done for good and they move on to the next one, so there's only a handful of each color and model ever made. They take a lot of pride in their work and it shows, it also has things like the Hoback rolling detent which is a nice touch on a midtech.  I became a big fan of them by watching some of the videos they put up on youtube and even more so when I finally got one of their knives. I own two at the moment and have a Mordax on order as well as two of their more expensive model runs of 25 pieces, they're good guys and great knife makers.  If you're not very interested in a flipper, Monkey Edge has the Les George Talos midtech for 425$ with their frag pattern in bronze, blue or plain titanium that would also be a great choice. Another flipper is the new Defiant7 knives from Les George and Chad Nichols.  As well as another one I've had my eye on, the Remedy from Liong Mah made by Reate, I've been super impressed with their quality from the start and love the design of the Remedy and Warrior One, both are at 350$ and limited runs from my understanding.  The ADV Pathfinder and Tac Butchers are kinda cool looking as well but I don't have any experience with them other then wanting a Pathfinder at some point.  And if you wait a little bit Brad Southard is coming out with the next models in his performance series that are usually a bit under 500$ and very well made by one of the best custom makers in the game today. Or you might be able to find someone selling a brand new Tolk for a the same price they were direct from Brad like I did, it's an awesome knife.  There's also the ZT 801 S110V in all black at Going Gear for a bit over 300$ and it's a limited run of 98 pieces, I'm thinking it might be my first ZT if I get a chance to buy one before they're sold out.  Any of them would be great choices and top notch quality."

Maybe consider a Reate for something a bit more exotic, though I haven't used one. The improvements you see in knives in the $300+ price bracket are extremely minute. They do change the character of the knife, almost always for the better, but not at all overwhelmingly so.  As for CRK knives, they're boring but well made. And Chris Reeve, though at least a bit of a jerk, will help you take care of your knife forever. I got a chance to try one for the first time recently and it was, indeed, impressively built, but I would never buy one."

Companies like the above and even Kizer produce on such a high level I wouldn't pay twice their price for something so modestly improved.

knifeclub,3duw39,merkon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:14:08 2015 UTC,"No, but I would expect it to be similar to a Sebenza in many ways. M390 is a slightly better steel than S30V, possibly much better depending on CRK's heat treatment. I heard recently CRK was changing their treatment, as it was considered subpar for a while, but honestly I think steel gets far too much consideration in pocket knives. If you like the feel in hand and how it deploys, you'll like the knife whether it's S35VN or Aus-8."

Three of those are from attempting to catch something sharp; two were knives, one was a box of plastic warp. The surgeries are more expensive than some tip repair work, or indeed a brand new knife, but thankfully all of their cases have been covered by their employers. More importantly two of them have fingers that don't do or feel anything. The third is fortunate enough to have partial movement and sensation."

knifeclub,3dtu0v,dangers91,2,Sun Jul 19 16:07:42 2015 UTC,"Adding to the rule about not cutting towards yourself, pay attention to the grip you are using. A controlled grip like the one you would use on a paring knife (fingers around the handle with the blade facing the thumb to give you more control) are safer if you are trying to cut towards yourself. Also if for some reason you like to stab into things please be careful, especially if the blade you are using doesn't lock. Your hands can slip down onto the blade or it can fold over on your fingers.  General advice is to avoid making people uncomfortable if you can, but honestly there's no pleasing some folks. Just try not to play with a gigantic, tacti-cool folder in heavily populated areas and you should be fine.   Edit: Example of the paring grip"

knifeclub,3dtu0v,Core77i,9,Sun Jul 19 12:14:13 2015 UTC,Another rule to observe is not to set an open or unsheathed knife down absentmindedly. Always close or resheath your knife after using to prevent accidents or loss. Especially important if there are children around.
knifeclub,3dtu0v,gigajim,4,Sun Jul 19 13:05:33 2015 UTC,"Looks like everyone is chiming in with some really good ones. I want to take a second and mention something about ""knife safety"" that you are probably familiar with from being a gun guy. Some people don't understand knife ownership. I just got this comment the other day when I told people I own guns. ""WHAT DO YOU NEED A GUN FOR!?"" They are shocked and can't understand it. The same thing will happen with knives, especially if you live in a less rural place. That being said, I'll throw this under knife safety: be cognizant of where you are and who you are around when taking out your knife, whether it be to fondle it and hold it or to use it on a task. We all know knives are tools for us. Not everyone else sees it that way. They are evil scary weapons. So yeah, that's my add on.. be careful when you deploy.   It's especially said because I would love to carry a fixed blade every day but I go the folder route since it's more discreet. Fixed blades have much more social taboo."
knifeclub,3dtu0v,Mc_douchebag,3,Sun Jul 19 17:23:18 2015 UTC,"Very basic knife safety would be: cut away from yourself, keep your fingers away from a closing blade, YOUR KNIFE IS A CUTTING TOOL AND SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR ANYTHING EXCEPT CUTTING (that's a huge one), and know how your knife functions, know the mechanism and how to operate it safely. Knife safety is really basic and I just listed the obvious ones."

knifeclub,3dqsy9,TheYukbob,2,Sun Jul 19 01:37:08 2015 UTC,"What he did is called an edge quench. It hardens the beveled portion for edge retention qualities but it leaves the spine of the knife softer than the blade so it can be beat on, or used for batoning through wood, without breaking the knife. Also to address the second question, he didn't show him tempering the blade in this particular video, but in some of his other videos be does. I'd check out more of his videos. They're a treasure trove of knowledge.  Oh, almost forgot the last part. The temperatures that he heated the wrench to would ruin/soften any kind of heat treat or temper that it previously had."

Far better then the local knife shop I was taking my blades to. I even managed to reprofile a couple of knives I had given up on.
knifeclub,3dqw0e,GeneralPurposeGeek,2,Sat Jul 18 22:46:45 2015 UTC,"There's a trick you can do with the KME, too. Buy a cheapo angle cube with magnets, and fasten a strip of metal on the back of the stone holder. I just cut a small strip of galvanized steel sheeting I had laying around and glued it on. Then, remove the guide (the piece with the plastic ball), and put it back on upside down. Now you can go down to a 10° angle. Use the angle cube to set it correctly. It's magnets should hold it securely to the metal strip on the stone holder, so it will give you the angle as you adjust."
knifeclub,3dqw0e,Boomerkuwanga,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:18:45 2015 UTC,I'm saving this comment as a reference. I do not think I need any angles that shallow right now but I have a long wish list. ;)

knifeclub,3dqw0e,Boomerkuwanga,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:30:30 2015 UTC,"I love the KME system, but one thing that always kept me from ordering one is having to go through KME to get stones, and lack of options for said stones. At one point they had Chosera stones, which really piqued my interest (AND THEY WERE EXPENSIVE AS HELL), but they no longer offer them.  Meanwhile, you can throw a stone at any online knife retailer and find Spyderco/Lansky/DMT stones. If I could easily use DMT or Spyderco stones on a KME system (like, without having to take a hacksaw to all my DMT stones), I would seriously consider it."

knifeclub,3dqw0e,Al_X,3,Sat Jul 18 21:24:07 2015 UTC,"Lansky works great for small/mid-sized knives, but is a pain for most kitchen knives or big choppers etc.   I haven't tried the edge pro varients but knowing what I know now if I went back to when I first night the lansky kit years ago, I'd probably try out a generic branded edge pro clone instead. You may have to buy some additional stones and do some tinkering, but I think you could put together something pretty useful for about 50 bucks that would be much more versatile and faster than the lansky.   That said, practice makes perfect with hand sharpening. Don't give up on the waterstone, maybe try amending your technique. I like the cliff stamp 3 step technique if your goal is sharpness and edge retention rather than aesthetics. Cut into the stone to remove damaged metal and give you a flat edge that reflects light. Then shape your edge bevel until the reflection is gone and it will easily slice paper. Then and a micro bevel with a few light passes at a slightly higher angle. Bam. Sharp as hell."

The rubber inserts in the clamp weren't very good at holding the knife in place, and since the blade was fixed in place, the angles weren't consistent along the whole length of the blade.  I'd say go for an edge pro clone. I have one, and it fine except for the stones, which were terrible. You'll have to spend another $50 or so on edge pro stones, but overall, I think it's a fantastic system for the money."
knifeclub,3dqw0e,flyingpomatoes,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:15:24 2015 UTC,"I've used a sharpmaker for a while now, and racked up a few hundred sharpening sessions, and it works like a charm. It requires a little patience; while it's great for keeping a knife sharp, it's not ideal for when you've absolutely destroyed an edge (the diamond rods help with this considerably, but still not the best). If you don't deal with that on a regular basis, it's affordable and effective. I also really appreciate being able to sharpen serrations with the corners of the triangles, as well as the 30 degree angle for when I want an edge a little keener.  I've heard great things about the Edge Pro as well, but I didn't want to drop $250+ for my sharpening system."
knifeclub,3dqw0e,SeungOfStorms,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:42:22 2015 UTC,"Currently own a Spyderco Sharpmaker, Lansky, and DMT Aligner.  Depends on what you're doing, but I find the Sharpmaker to very limiting for knives due to the angle limitations (yes, I know there's fuckery to get around it, no, don't pretend it isn't a pain in the ass to do so) and it's a living hell to reprofile harder steels on the default stones.  Lansky is hit or miss. A few ""hones"" that I've ordered for the Lansky system have not been flat, have not been set correctly, plus I don't really care for their clamp system (on smaller blades, utilizing the 17 degree slot is damn near impossible).  DMT has opened my eyes to the wonders of diamond sharpening, however. Their stones are amazing. Flat as flat can be, can reprofile in no time and also their clamp is a lot better than Lansky's in my opinion. They have sub-200 grit stones that will make any steel their bitch, going up to .2 micron (IIRC) ~8000 grit stones for the same system. So you can go from a metal slab to mirror polished edge on one system. Drawback is it's not where near as versatile as the Lansky. Have a karambit? Forgetaboutit. Lansky has curved ""hones,"" diamond hones, Arkansas, serration hones, stropping hones, ect. DMT used to put out a curved blade accessory for their Aligner, but good fucking luck finding it. The stones are also larger. DMT's are about a inch in width (perhaps slightly smaller) when Lansky's are about half an inch of so.  I would recommend the Lansky for a beginner. Lansky system + diamond hones + regular kit hones + sapphire hones + leather strop hones = a hell of a sharpening system for almost any knives. And if you do have hawkbill style blades, you can pick up the curved hones for it. Less than $100 will get you pretty much all you need."
knifeclub,3dqw0e,beltfedvendetta,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:38:53 2015 UTC,"I actually am going the opposite way. I started with the sharpmaker, went to the edge pro apex clone and then the wicked edge pro clone and just recently got a good pair of whetstones.   The sharpmaker is one of the easiest and quickest with the least chance of marking your knife. Re-profiling is terrible though. Never got the knives as sharp as the other methods though even with the ultra-fine stones (still very sharp though). Also personally I found that the system made it easy to blunt the tip,    The edge pro worked very very well but I would it a bit more fiddly and seemed to always mark the blades. Good results though (hard to determine angle though).    Wicked edge gave amazing mirror finish results but was took a while to set up each time and the included stones got clogged very easily and took a while to clean. Also more expensive than the edge pro clone.    Whetstones as you know can give some of the best results but require more effort and training than the other systems."

knifeclub,3do218,ohitsjerico,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:21:15 2015 UTC,"To the touch, pretty identical. However, visual inspection reveals the Dauntless to have a slightly porous carbon fiber with small (<0.5mm), shallow holes, intermittently dispersed.

Sure deep carry gives you that stealthy look, but the deeper the knife is in your pocket, the tougher it is to draw and then adjust it into a useful grip.  Admittedly I may just be super used to having a decent chunk of knife sticking out of my pocket these days, as I've mostly been carrying my Emerson MCom and if you tried to carry that any lower in the pocket, the wave would be near useless."

knifeclub,3dkj51,mutokangius,5,Fri Jul 17 03:17:00 2015 UTC,When you get one you realise that Spyderco sacrificed traditional aesthetics in favour of functionality. Then you start to appreciate their unique aesthetics too.

Still, in a way, it's beauty is in it's functionality.   I'm a ZT fan at heart.  On an aesthetic level, the knives just do it for me on a regular basis.  Very solid, well built knives that are sexy as hell.  However, I gave the PM2 a shot based on reviews/reputation and I've been blown away by it's quality and design.  The PM2 is almost pure function over form.  If you can appreciate a knife for just being a damn good knife regardless of looks, you'll like the PM2. I respect the hell out of it and it's my ""go to"" folder for outdoor activities like canoeing, backpacking, hunting, and manual labor.  (Yes, I also take a fixed if the situation calls for it, but I like to have a folder in my pocket at all times regardless)"

Sal just about perfected ergonomic grips and finger choils with the Caly 3, Stretch, and Native series(s), all of which have more robust tips and similar cutting edges. Don't get me wrong, I think the PM2 is a better  heavy-duty knife than all of those, but I think the PM2 design could be improved upon."
knifeclub,3dkj51,SaintZvlkx,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:40:01 2015 UTC,"See, I like the tip just the way it is.  I actually find having a fine tip on a knife is stupidly useful.  I don't pry with my knives, so I've never had tip issues.    The PM2 fits amazingly well in my hand, as well.  However, ergonomic quality will vary from person to person."
knifeclub,3dkj51,sqweexv,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:46:36 2015 UTC,"Oh, the PM2's ergonomics are great. That being said, the excellent ergonomics aren't exactly unique in the Spyderco catalogue. The Caly 3, Stretch, Native, and Manix series are all just as ergonomic, although people will have different preferences on an individual level."
knifeclub,3dkj51,SaintZvlkx,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:12:00 2015 UTC,"Didn't mean to imply that good ergonomics were unique to the PM2, though it does have a larger handle to blade ratio than many other knives.    The one thing I will say the PM2 could improve on...the compression lock.  Now, I'm thrilled with this lock, but IMO, the lock bar itself could be a little beefier and the tab (the one you press on to release the lock) could be a little more refined.  Unfortunately, I suspect changing those, at least the way I envision it, would have a significant increase on cost just due to the extra machining complexity."
knifeclub,3dkj51,sqweexv,3,Fri Jul 17 18:59:53 2015 UTC,Agreed! It is even more perfect when you start using it for tasks that start to wear on the black finish!

I'm saying: don't do it out of laziness or just carelessness. I've seen guys pry and screw with a knife when a suitable screwdriver is within arms reach. Why risk damage to an expensive knife and whatever you're working on when you have a $5 screwdriver that's perfect for that job?  I'm a big believer in the right tool for the right job. It's safer and more efficient."

You could ship it in and get them to re-blade the knife for $10, or just grind the tip so it's just flat and unsharpened.

A lot of times, ""Damascus"" coming out of China or Pakistan is lower quality steel or not even pattern welded at all.

There is nothing wrong with pattern welded steel, you seem to have the impression that pattern welded steel is cheap and bad. It isn't. It is only bad if you weld it out of shitty scrap steel. The term was pulled from older historic texts and dubbed ""damascus steel"" by Bill Moran who that term for billet or pattern welding process to make pretty knives. They are not the same thing as Damascus steel that existed in the Middle Ages. Real historic damascus steel is made from crucible forged steel ingots that are basically pure iron that have been heat treated at very high temperatures unlike most medieval steels."

knifeclub,3dm4bf,RissyQuicks,0,Fri Jul 17 19:43:46 2015 UTC,Sure. That's one way of doing it. Another is to get a few less expensive knives and when I lose one I am only out $30 instead of being bummed that I lost a $250 item. Either way.

knifeclub,3dm4bf,ZiLBeRTRoN,2,Fri Jul 17 19:44:10 2015 UTC,"This is a substantial knife. As I am not Active Duty anymore (retired in March 2013) I have been carrying smaller blades due to smaller pockets. This one however caught me off guard. On sale at Woot for $17.99 I really just went in to get a knife because they were so cheap. Once you are under the magic $20 mark I tend to be less discriminating.  For the money this is a fine knife. Aus 8 steel, great action that is smooth and linear. Perfect lock up for my taste. The scales and liner are all perfectly aligned. It is like a much more expensive knife.  The blade is a beast. It is as if a Tanto met a sword from ""Game of Thrones"". I really like that it came with the lanyard. I have never used one on a knife. A 4 way clip rounds out the package.  A really good value at $17.99. This was a good impulse purchase."
knifeclub,3dm4bf,Milligan1888,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:32:13 2015 UTC,"I love mine, I have the drop point PE but for the price they are a ton of bang for the buck. I wasn't a fan of the lanyard but butter smooth and great lockup, I agree it feels like a much more expensive knife."
knifeclub,3dm4bf,Zickefoose,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:53:42 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I generally hate tanto/combo blades. They don't add anything for me and seem to make the knife cumbersome to use. However I can get behind this style. Serrations along the entire straight portion and if you need more precise cutting you have your little razor part. For under twenty bucks I'd say a good choice."

The real appeal of this knife for me is that it's not too heavy (for a wide knife) and it's relatively thin. It's a fair bit thinner than the S30V G10 Leek.  It's not grippy, but I look at this an EDC office knife. It's wider than I normally like, but the main reason I usually don't like wide folders is that they tend to be more than 4 or 5 ounces in weight."

knifeclub,3djde5,overrule,2,Fri Jul 17 00:57:48 2015 UTC,"I reprofiled this knife at 15° per side to a mirror like finish after posting... and it takes a fine edge better than S30V or S35V (which like a toothier edge). It's less toothy, like VG10, 154CM, and 14C28N. I've found that with S30V and S35V (to a lesser extent), if I go too fine the blade just doesn't cut as well (I still like those steels though). I'm not going to have a favorite knife steel (I like most modern knife steels), but right now Elmax is looking great for at least light EDC use."
knifeclub,3diuyh,threatdownbears,3,Thu Jul 16 17:00:07 2015 UTC,I much appreciate this pile. Which is your favorite ?
knifeclub,3diuyh,pm_me_your_poop_plz,3,Thu Jul 16 22:07:50 2015 UTC,"Impossible question. I will say that lately the most pocket time is given to the chestnut Case Peanut and the red GEC serpentine jack. Historically, the most carried in that particular pile is the Buck 55.  Most of my whittling has been done with the wood covered Boker (Tree Brand) whittler, but my last project was mostly with the new Grinling (GEC 38 with the blood red covers)."

knifeclub,3dgqq4,Zamboni_Driver,5,Thu Jul 16 03:32:53 2015 UTC,"This is a ""Anton Malyshev"" Gnome. Purchased from ""Y-start Trading"" on Aliexpress.   The story according to posts by the designer in this thread, is that the designer uploaded an early concept drawing to instagram to fish for some feedback, and the design was quickly scooped up and reproduced by chinese makers. Anton Malyshev decided not to persue the design, but has publicly stated that he is ok with people purchasing the clone if they would like to experience the knife.   There are two versions of this knife, one with satin flats on the handle, and the other, which I purchased, that has a beautiful stonewashed, pebble-like finish. Handles and pocket clip are full titanium.  Fit and finish is excellent, the grind is even, the knife came clean, and perfectly adjusted out of the box. I literally picked it up out of the package and it flipped perfectly as if I had been playing with it for days.  I really like small knives with 50/50 choils, I also own a chaparral, and a SRM 605, and SRM 605. For my uses i really value an overall smaller package that I can still get a four finger grip on.   I have not yet used this knife for much cutting so I can't comment on heat treat or edge retention. The product page listed D2, but it is much more likely one of the chinese 8cr** steels. I'm sure its no super steel but should be fine for everyday use. I honestly not that bothered by a steel like this in a knife at this price point. The overall package is amazing, so I'm willing to comprimise on the steel to get a knife like this at this price point ($50USD).  If I had anything bad to say about the knife it would be the following. The pivot is not loctited in place and comes loose with repeated flipping. Not a big deal to me as I always take things apart anyways - I will loctite it myself for correct the issue. The other gripe is that there is no flat between the finger choil and the beginning of the edge. On most knives with a 50/50 choil there is usually some sort of barrier between the finger and edge in case you slip up a bit. This knife puts the finger almost right on the edge. In the future I may dremel a little 1-2mm flat spot next to the choil for safety. This isn't an issue with the maker as it seems that the original design of the knife by Anton Malyshev  had it laid out like this as well.   Overall, I think this is a real winner. This knife is going to be replacing my chaparral as my EDC for the foreseable future."

Those free parts and relaxed blade replacement policy is built into the price of those knives. Spyderco knives are very often cheaper than their Benchmade and ZT competition. So you paid for the clips and great warranty regardless of if you are going to use it some time down the road.

And I really do think the action is better. Did all the anodizing myself with 9v batteries in series. Do you guys think I should acid-stonewash the blade or leave it as is?  Learned quite a bit today about anodizing and how imprecise my set-up is. This final product is still very flawed and was not at all the original plan. I sanded these scales a few times to redo everything. Still, I'm happy with this until I get a real anodizer set up.   Question for the other pimpers here, how can I get a colored Ti finish that isn't so damn sensitive to oil? As you can see in pic 2 the color looks all weird when there's little smudges of oil or moisture. I'm thinking of picking up some multi-etch but if you guys have any tips I'd appreciate it."

knifeclub,3ditlf,Knife_Guide,2,Thu Jul 16 16:54:15 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but those things are stupidly janky (IE, flimsy garbage) and not really worth your money. If you're looking for a small knife, I can't recommend the SanRenMu 605 enough.   It's small, nonthreatening, very well made and a very functional design. It's not a gimmicky piece of dangerous garbage and you'll get vastly more use out of it. Can't comment on UK carry laws, but that thing's about as friendly towards knife laws (doesn't have anything that usually makes it illegal - no auto, short blade, single edged, etc) than most stuff.. that crap card sharp included.   I bought one and gave it away as a joke gift within hours. Save yourself the money  edit:    COUNTRY OF ORIGIN Far East   That doesn't inspire confidence."
knifeclub,3ditlf,NoRedditAtWork,2,Thu Jul 16 22:43:24 2015 UTC,Doesn't the UK have laws against locking knives?
knifeclub,3ditlf,slowwburnn,2,Fri Jul 17 00:01:43 2015 UTC,The laws are somewhat up for interpretation. Walking around with one for no reason? Nope. Using one for work is fine.
knifeclub,3ditlf,Milligan1888,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:17:48 2015 UTC,No this would not be legal in the UK to carry around without a good reason. You need a good folding nonlocking knife or a reasonable reason (eg chiefs knife at work) to carry around a knife that is fixed or has a lock.
knifeclub,3ditlf,ItIsOnlyRain,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:18:45 2015 UTC,"I'd steer clear of the cardsharp in general but here's a quick run down of UK knife law for a fellow Brit enthusiast: You can carry any knife with a blade of under 3"" that folds and does not lock without need for reason (however it would be unwise to do so at football matches, pubs etc.). For anything that locks, doesn't fold or exceeds the limit you need just reason to carry it (needed for work, you're camping etc.). These two rules cover most things you'd be looking at but there is a list of forbidden weapons that would make it highly illegal to own a knife on the list (the list includes balisongs, autos and disguised knives). Hope this helped!"
knifeclub,3dhxdc,mattyparanoid,2,Thu Jul 16 12:25:21 2015 UTC,"So, Sunday night I binged and bought 7 knives. 2 have gone back already, a Boker Kwaiken and a Kershaw Nura. This Gerber is a knife that I wouldn't call a grail because it is quite common. It is however a knife that I always wanted to buy because I like the shape/design. I must have seen this knife in every Base Exchange for the past 10 years! Never got around to buying it.  So, I bought it. Well, what do I think of it? I still love the shape, but I should have gotten the smaller one. It feels big to me, but I like smaller blades so that is just me. The action is gritty (has been described as so elsewhere and I concur). The knife itself is nice quality with close tolerances and good finish. The blade is a mystery steel. EDIT: NOT mystery steel, a quick check of the amazon specs shows it as Blade Material: 440A  I am thinking about sending this one back too, maybe getting the smaller version. Or maybe I will keep it for a trade later. I am glad I finally got it and I do like the shape and design very much."

Either way after using it to hone up a few different knives (even some in VG10 and 154CM) I've concluded that it's a great finishing stone for carbon steels, leaves an edge that shaves very comfortably but can still slice well (especially if you set up edges to perform well in both endeavors like I try to do). As far as getting edges for shaving I'll have to test it out on my old Solingen Razor Co. straight razor and see how it worked on period appropriate steels. As far as working on  Super steel like S30V and stuff like that, it works... I don't know how or why (Dunno what the stone is made of or much about the manufacturer) but somehow after putting a nice edge on a couple knives in S30V ending on a Spyderco Fine Ceramic and then going to this, the edge it finishes with is outstanding, even without stropping after it's toothy yet extremely fine."

knifeclub,3def1d,Hallucinosis,3,Wed Jul 15 16:59:07 2015 UTC,"My Leek is a thousand miles away at the Kershaw Magic factory getting a new blade. I'm actually going through sub drop, I miss it so much. I have a picture of it I look at before I go to sleep, I'm so pathetic."
knifeclub,3def1d,-shoshana-,2,Thu Jul 16 00:28:16 2015 UTC,"Oh god, the one thing that stops the Leek from being a perfect EDC for me is the lack of traction on the blade.  If they made another version with FRN or the like handle scales and maybe a upgraded blade steel, I would die happy. The Chill has very similar dimensions, but has a different blade shape, 8CR13MoV vs the 14C28N of the leek, and isn't assissted.  Ken Onion pls."
knifeclub,3def1d,overrule,2,Wed Jul 15 18:42:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it basically has the 2 small bits of jimping as other Leeks (on the flipper and behind the thumb studs). That said, I look at this as a lighter use EDC (relatively thin blade, fine tip), though the G10 is fairly grippy (more so than a Spyderco Paramilitary 2) and I had to make those small flat spot mod under the pocket clip to save my pants.  I love the Kershaw Chill--such an amazing value. 2oz flipper with a 3.1"" blade."
knifeclub,3def1d,suitaroh,2,Wed Jul 15 19:02:26 2015 UTC,"To me it seems Kershaw doesn't make the G10 Leek or the Random Leek with any regularity because the price they ask would start to get into KAI's Zero Tolerance territory. They can sell out a few runs of them every so often to satisfy the knife lovers (but they'd really rather them buy ZT's stuff) and keep the regular versions going strong to satisfy everyone, knife knut and casual knife users. But that sounds like too much of a conspiracy theory to be true.  Sidenote: Imagine a ZT Leek, though the 0808 is close-ish-sorta. Ti framelock-possibly carbon fiber show side, KVT, CTS-204p. Hnnnnnng. Or just go buy a Kizer Splinter."
knifeclub,3def1d,overrule,2,Thu Jul 16 04:30:11 2015 UTC,"It's not really a conspiracy theory and more of a well thought tides by you and Kai. Market segmentation and branding works.   Many retailers do the same thing: Gap has Old Navy, Gap, and Banana Republic; there's J. Crew and J. Crew Factory as well as Lexus vs Toyota.   I'm not really that familiar with Zero Tolerance, mostly because I've only been into them for a few months. Can you give me some models of ZT that are similar in size/shape to the Leek or Zing? Time to check out some more reviews"
knifeclub,3def1d,suitaroh,2,Thu Jul 16 05:15:47 2015 UTC,"Until recently it was less about similar models and more about price brackets. ZT is exclusively 100$ and up, while Kershaw has very few models in that range, Elmax knockout and Camber are the onle ones that come to mind. The ZT 0808 and 0450 were released this year and are the closest ZT models in size to the Leek. Their other models are all rather larger."
knifeclub,3def1d,overrule,2,Thu Jul 16 13:43:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Funnily enough, those are the only two models that were reviewed on www.everydaycommentary.com, which was the very first knife/EDC site I found. Unfortunately, if they're just Leeks or Zings with upgraded fit and finish + materials, I'll pass. Really looking for a Leek sized that's lightweight and has a composite handle."
knifeclub,3def1d,suitaroh,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:05:54 2015 UTC,"You might want to take a look at the Benchmade 940-1, it's way pricey, but packs a lot of knife in a profile that isn't significantly bigger than the Leek, in addition to having a great steel and carbon fiber handles. As for the ZT's, they're by different designers with upgraded materials. Though bearings vs speedsafe is, imo, a worthwhile upgrade. Given the popularity, at least in my eyes of the 0450 and 0452, ZT might, hopefully, maybe, produce an 0450 with carbon fiber scales. But that's just empty speculation. Hopefully ZT continues to produce some great smaller folders next year."
knifeclub,3def1d,overrule,2,Fri Jul 17 02:41:02 2015 UTC,"I would be all over the 0450 in CF.  The 940-1 is a sexy beast. That CF contouring and blade steel....unf. Though at that price point, I would very well just jump into a small Sebenza with micarta inlays and cry myself to sleep on my credit card statement.  *sigh I'm seriously considering the mini Presidio, though. Maybe in a few months when I've saved up, I can consider the Valet (485) or Sequel (707)"

knifeclub,3dektf,JimmyRnj,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:15:05 2015 UTC,It looks like it but it's hard to tell. You can kind of make out the Spyderco logo and Spydie hole as well. I can see a little curve to the spine which would rule out the first version of the Yojimbo. His finger partially conceals the spine so that could be why the angle seems a bit off to you as well.

knifeclub,3derg5,bjornkeizers,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:25:00 2015 UTC,"I finally got around to adding some bayonets to the knife collection. While not a knife per se, I still like having them because of the awesome look.   The orange bayonet is an actual Russian model, produced in Izhvesk, date unknown. The black model is an East-German bayonet, produced between 1985 and 1987. The Russian was acquired from a private collector, the German one from a military dump store. These bayonets were produced in Russia as well as other countries in the union during the Cold War. China and some other countries produced them as well. There are subtle differences in terms of steel used, sharpness, markings and other aspects.  I've been obsessed with the looks of these classic AKM type II bayonets for years. They have such an awesome look, with the orange polymer, contrasting black pommel, the nice blade and the utilitarian sheath that doubles as a wire cutter. This is done by putting the blade over a post on the sheath, then grabbing both sheath and knife handle to cut.  There are four main types of bayonet that were produced for the AK47 and the later AKM (the one that most people are familiar with as 'the Kalashnikov').   This is the third generation of these bayonets. It has some notable improvements over the first two versions. For one, the blade doubles as wire cutter with the sheath and it has a steel pommel instead of a plastic one. This facilitates using it as a hammer.   All in all, these are lovely little items to have, even if a bit impractical :D"
knifeclub,3derg5,Ganjingo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:30:01 2015 UTC,Such a cool knife(or bayonet) I have to pick one up from the militairy dump someday just because they are so awesome.
knifeclub,3derg5,Russell_is_kool,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:58:34 2015 UTC,"They certainly aren't too difficult to find right now. They were produced in great quantities and there are no doubt warehouses full of them. Basically, you should be able to find one that's both cheap, easily available and decent looking.  It probably pays to visit a store instead of buying sight unseen. Since stores have them in bulk, it might be a gamble if you get a new, lightly used or 'run over by a Soviet T55 tank' condition."
knifeclub,3dh46y,cooperred,2,Thu Jul 16 05:49:50 2015 UTC,"Happens sometimes. Unless loosening it makes the blade wildly off-center, you don't need to worry. The other side doesn't need to be messed with, just keep tinkering with the screw you can access so it opens to your liking."

I can feel the smoothness, its in there, I just have to help it out some. Mine wasn't too terribly stiff in the beginning but definitely tight. I didn't loosen any screws. Also it might be worth it to get a small torx set. On the knives that I have there are a few that are T6 so at least this way if you buy a set you can move the pocket clips on (all) your knives"
knifeclub,3dh46y,mrb4ttery,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:34:38 2015 UTC,"Try loosening the screws on the stop pin just a bit, it seems to help loosen up the action on the PM2. Either way, it will break in with more use."

knifeclub,3dgnuf,cmikles1,2,Thu Jul 16 03:51:56 2015 UTC,"That's a tough one. It really comes down to which one you like the looks of better. They have the same blade steel.  Here's what I like/don't like about each.  Oso Sweet: I like the overall handle and blade shape. The drop point blade is very useful for general cutting tasks. I love the speed safe assist, in taking them apart, they are simple and robust.   I don't like the scale pattern on the handle, like my burst, I would sand them smooth. One of the reviews on Amazon shows what it looks like smooth. It's a nice look, and the flipper and handle shape will keep your hand in place. Also the pocket clip is hideous. It reminds me of the Junkyard Dog clip. Modifying it wouldn't help much and I don't know if any other clips will fit it.   Cryo: I like the all metal construction. It has a heavy duty feel to it. The drop point blade is again very useful. The pocket clip is low key and four position moveable. The frame lock is strong and simple. The jimping around the edges helps offset the sickness of the handles. It also has speed safe. It feels like a working man's knife.  I don't like the length of the handle. I am very vain when it comes to knives. I don't like folders with a lot of extra handle past what is needed to cover the blade. On the Cryo, I would probably grind down the end past the lanyard hole. I'm sure many people would hate that I would, but it's my knife.   So there's my drawn out opinion. If you can't decide, get them both. They are worth it."
knifeclub,3dgnuf,Knife_Guide,2,Thu Jul 16 03:52:04 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for the breakdown. I think I will probably end up with the Cryo, it certainly has a great reputation."

As far as steel grades, it's a step above something like AUS-8, because it's about the same as AUS118.   The steel is capable of performing perfectly well, it's actually used in a lot of japanese kitchen knives. However, it's entirely possible that CRKT doesn't do the best job heat treating it."

knifeclub,3db9kz,UncannyGodot,2,Wed Jul 15 00:23:44 2015 UTC,VG Max with 32-layer Cladding.  We sell a lot of Shuns here.
knifeclub,3db9kz,Silverlight42,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:49:48 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking of getting a Shun...  I have a few Grohmann kitchen knives which are nice.  I'm just wondering why Shun doesn't call those blades they do San-mai, because it was once described to me as two forged welded steels with a sandwiched different steel core, which is what you're describing I think.   I think the translation means 3 layers or 3 steels or something.  There may be some subtle difference i'm not understanding.  Also... vg-max?  first time I heard that.  Thought it was vg-10.  what's the diff?"
knifeclub,3db9kz,ColonelBunkyMustard,5,Wed Jul 15 00:58:50 2015 UTC,"Shun does identify them as clad knives in some media, but that a high end kitchen knife is clad is common enough it doesn't bear mention most of the time.  VG-Max is a somewhat new proprietary steel. It's got a little more of many of the alloying elements you see in VG-10, but it's similar enough to VG-10 I can't really tell the difference.  If you want a Shun, look at the Kaji line. It's the best thing they make. Shun's SG-2 is much more impressive than their VG-10 and the handle is more organic than the classic line. But even then, unless they're heavily discounted, there are much more impressive knives than Shun for the price."
knifeclub,3db9kz,UncannyGodot,2,Wed Jul 15 02:19:34 2015 UTC,"Kaji    cool.   Thanks for the opinion.   I'll keep it in mind if I see an 8"" chef knife for a deal somewhere...   real nice polish on those.   Not really looking at the moment anyhow.  Too many pretty folders to get that are ahead of the line."
knifeclub,3db9kz,ColonelBunkyMustard,2,Wed Jul 15 02:30:09 2015 UTC,"I just tell people it's VG-10 with more of everything.  I haven't seen much of a difference in side by side tests, aside from being slightly less chippy."

knifeclub,3db9kz,SphericalTriangles,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:17:52 2015 UTC,"The Shun Blue line is aogami #2. It's less finicky to heat treat than aogami super, or so I'm told. It doesn't hold an edge as well.  More salient is their price. The Kaji line, as a house line for William Sonoma, goes on some big sales. I've seen them discounted down to prices comparable to or lower than the Classic line, which makes them worth considering. I haven't seen the same price dips from the Blue line. And the Blue line lives in a price range filled with wolves. Konosuke, Takamura, Akifusa, and Masakage are all great companies that make a variety of styles in that price range. The Gesshin and Richmond house lines are competitive there, too. There are also quite a few individual smiths who make knives in that price range. Yu Kurosaki and Katsushige Anryu's knives can be ordered from North American resellers for $250-ish and they are extremely impressive. You can even order direct from smiths like Nakaya Heiji or Teruyasu Fujiwara for that. The designed by committee Shun is a bit of a lame duck at its current price."
knifeclub,3db9kz,Core77i,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:01:24 2015 UTC,"Shun's biggest weakness, at least on the product side, has always been their high end.  Their newest stuff, things like the Dual Core, is cool, and nice to look at, but it is insanely expensive.  I've paid less for nice handmade stuff, that I am pretty sure performs better.  But, in terms of volume, visibility, and marketing, no knife company out there can overpower KAI.  They are just too big."
knifeclub,3db9kz,Core77i,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:08:56 2015 UTC,"My mistake, Blue #2 is still a great steel @ 63 HRC but I wouldn't ever buy a Shun knife anyway, for the price I would prefer a Kohetsu in AS or Hap-40"
knifeclub,3db9kz,ColonelBunkyMustard,0,Thu Jul 16 17:55:46 2015 UTC,"The purpose of san-mai is more to have a really hard core (maybe plain high carbon steel) with an outer layer of a more resistant or stainless steel. Thus when a knife is sharpened, the hard center is exposed as the edge, but the faces of the knife serve as a protective permanent sheath.  Folded steels are a little bit different. So far, my understanding is that folded steels are more of a demonstration of a blacksmith's technical abilities. I have yet to find anything that makes me think folded steels are better than monolithic forged steels.   On a side note, Tojiro is a good brand if you want to test out the Japanese kitchen knife waters. If you like the look of folded steel, I recommend the Tojiro DP Damascus Starter Knife Set, otherwise I would just get ther normal two piece set."

knifeclub,3db9kz,zsks,4,Wed Jul 15 00:58:35 2015 UTC,"I'm an electrician and this is indeed what happens. When you cut something live, the copper gets so hot it melts and welds to what ever you cut it with. I'm actually really surprised that it didn't do more damage seeing as a knife blade is a lot thinner then my cutters and my cutters have roughly the same sized hole! Be careful guys, you can't  see, smell or hear electricity (in most cases) but it will sure as hell kill you instantly if you're not careful. I hope that knife wasn't full tang with the tang exposed, the user probably got a nice zap."

knifeclub,3db9kz,satanonaskateboard,2,Tue Jul 14 23:26:28 2015 UTC,"Presumably the marked line is how you plan to reshape the blade. Is there any reason, other than aesthetics, why this backward swept angle is preferable to a more forward one that would retain more of a point on the blade?"
knifeclub,3dex73,ZomShaw,2,Wed Jul 15 19:04:55 2015 UTC,I have the Charge and the Surge.  The Surge is bigger and I  prefer it.  It only has one screwdriver bit but has a swappable saw and file. The scissors are large enough to use comfortably. it has replacable wire cutters so if they are damaged you don't have to get a new multitool.  The Charge I have is the ALX.  It has 2 bits and no scissors. The knife steel is better (154cm vs 440c) but the blade is smaller than the charge. The serrated blade on the Charge has a hook cutter that the Surge doesn't have.  Bit kits and bit extender work on both.

knifeclub,3dd6tl,jtalaiver,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:16:07 2015 UTC,"How about the Cold Steel Hold Out II? http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Z4QYHA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004Z4QYHA&linkCode=as2&tag=mocbd-20&linkId=5VSTMW3ZJSHTXBB3  I carried one for a long time as an EDC last year (still do on and off these days) - it's very lightweight, with an extremely sharp AUS8A blade out of factory, and the linerless G-10 handle has good traction and feels good in the hands. Seems this knife is available under Prime (just checked), and a lot cheaper than what I paid for it (about half the price)."

knifeclub,3dd6tl,kjbenner,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:19:24 2015 UTC,"Yep. Went for $31, which is a bit less than normal, but really not much less than a trip to Walmart. Plus you have to wait two days for that impulse checkout-line drink to show up."
knifeclub,3dd6tl,thesohoriots,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:17:27 2015 UTC,My Walmart sells Leeks for $50. But yeah $30 is not the best deal around.

knifeclub,3dcjao,Benassi,3,Wed Jul 15 06:42:00 2015 UTC,Now this is what I'm looking for
knifeclub,3dcjao,shiftypoo269,9,Wed Jul 15 14:11:05 2015 UTC,If it fits in your pocket then you can carry it.  If it doesn't? Then get pants with larger pockets.
knifeclub,3dcjao,cmikles1,3,Wed Jul 15 11:30:19 2015 UTC,I see we have similar ideas when it comes to fashion :)
knifeclub,3dcjao,Rumzdizzle,2,Wed Jul 15 13:07:22 2015 UTC,Yes! Exactly how to solve the problem.
knifeclub,3dcjao,king_human,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:14:15 2015 UTC,You could always get some Jynco jeans off eBay
knifeclub,3dcjao,gigajim,5,Thu Jul 16 01:12:23 2015 UTC,"Welcome!   The Tatanka is a great knife, but tends to be expensive (a great value, to be sure, but it's 150 bucks). Also check out Cold Steel stuff:  Voyager XL  Large Espada (G-10 version)  6"" Ti-Lite  Counter Point XL  Hold Out I  Pocket Bushman  Rajah II  Talwar 5 1/2""  XL Recon 1  Also, the SOG Pentagon Elite II is about 50 bucks less for similar materials and pretty darn good build quality.  Again, the Tatanka is a great knife. I only wanted to offer some other options for a large-handed bro.  Edit: Man, my formatting was bad, and I feel bad. But, yeah, Spyderco makes good knives. I am carrying a Manix 2 XL, a Pacific Salt black, and their discontinued Spydercard today, so I might be a bit biased."
knifeclub,3dcjao,gigajim,3,Wed Jul 15 11:30:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I was looking at a tatanka because spyderco is the one major knife brand I never owned yet heard so much good stuff, so I wanted to give it a try, I'll definitely look into some of these others, thanks for the tips :)"
knifeclub,3dcjao,gigajim,3,Wed Jul 15 13:05:35 2015 UTC,"I've heard good things about the Tatanka, but as a fellow large-handed person I prefer the Zero Tolerance line for comfort."
knifeclub,3dcjao,VelociraptorVacation,3,Wed Jul 15 12:20:27 2015 UTC,"Knife before my last was a zero tolerance, I even looked at getting a zt0300 again, but I decided to give something else a shot"
knifeclub,3dcjao,VelociraptorVacation,2,Wed Jul 15 13:08:58 2015 UTC,"The 0560 is nice and beefy and one of the more comfortable knives I own.  Spyderco-wise, I like the PM2 and the Military for comfort (PM2 is a little small).  If you're even considering Benchmade, look at the Contego (I like the knifeworks.com exclusive one with blue/black G10 and M390 steel).  Edit - Spyderco K2?  It's got a 4.5"" blade and is fairly wide."
knifeclub,3dcjao,infinity526,2,Wed Jul 15 14:21:29 2015 UTC,"Which would you say holds up better, the k2 or the tatanka?"
knifeclub,3dcjao,chatttheleaper,2,Wed Jul 15 15:02:22 2015 UTC,"Not sure about build quality, but the K2 has 10v steel which is known for having VERY high wear resistance.  You wouldn't have to sharpen it often at all."
knifeclub,3dcjao,Dr-Mabuse,3,Wed Jul 15 15:34:19 2015 UTC,"EDC? That's a bit large just as far as pockets are concerned. I would say manix 2 xl. I love mine. But hell, I've never actually held or pocketed the tatanka, so take that with a grain of salt"
knifeclub,3dcjao,gigajim,3,Wed Jul 15 05:54:54 2015 UTC,"Online it sounds like it's still manageable/pocketable, plus I usually have fairly large pockets, but the manix 2xl looks pretty good too, wish it came in a larger size however"
knifeclub,3dcjao,mafiace,6,Wed Jul 15 06:01:25 2015 UTC,Looks at a manix xl and wishes it came in a larger size?I like the cut of your oversized jib.
knifeclub,3dcjao,mafiace,2,Wed Jul 15 07:25:02 2015 UTC,"Hehe go big or go home, had a knife the size of it but it was still a little small for me."
knifeclub,3dcjao,adequacy,3,Wed Jul 15 13:03:34 2015 UTC,/u/chatttheleaper carries one as an edc.
knifeclub,3dcjao,wirelessjunkie,3,Wed Jul 15 06:10:31 2015 UTC,"I do edc it. Having fairly large hands, I can hold it very comfortably. What exactly do you want to know about it?"
knifeclub,3dcjao,GreenLizardHands,2,Wed Jul 15 06:24:47 2015 UTC,Is it worth the money/ how has it held up?
knifeclub,3dcjao,GreenLizardHands,3,Wed Jul 15 14:21:46 2015 UTC,I always wondered who was in the market for those folding machetes. You must be one big dude. I don't know anyone that has one but all my spyders have been very high quality.   Do it. We need more pocket sword wielding giants in this world. Do it because the rest of us would be dwarfed by it's might.
knifeclub,3dcjao,walkingagh,3,Wed Jul 15 08:35:52 2015 UTC,"Only 6'5 but I have annoyingly large hands for my size... I'd trade smaller hands for the ability to use a small keyboard in a heartbeat :) but yes, I shall do this because it's what the world needs!"

knifeclub,3dcjao,NoRedditAtWork,3,Wed Jul 15 14:30:19 2015 UTC,"Generally I prefer 4"" blades for EDC, as I've found those over that length that I own are not so carry-friendly. I was going to suggest the new Steel Will GEKKO 1500 (http://steelwillknives.com/our-knives/outdoor-series/gekko-1500.html) which I now carry as my regular EDC, but I read in one of your comments that ""Spyderco is the one major knife brand I never owned yet heard so much good stuff"", and you're right. If 5"" is what you're after and you've actually held one for size, then go for it. There isn't that many options at that blade length when it comes to folders. Personally, I carry the Spyderco Resilience (http://www.devonbuy.com/spyderco-resilience/) because I was looking for a 4""-blade budget model from Spyderco, and the Resilience fit the bill. Other folders at 4"" and under from Spyderco worth considering are their ever-popular Endura and Para Military 2, the Southard (though quite expensive) and the Manix 2 (may be a little too short for your taste). Just some suggestions. Have fun with your search and do let us know what you get end of the day!"
knifeclub,3dcjao,NoRedditAtWork,3,Wed Jul 15 15:02:16 2015 UTC,"I'll definitely look at those, still looking at the 5"" range. Thanks for being so helpful! So far this is the only sub that's been so incredibly welcoming, I really appreciate it :). I'm also partial to the KaBar brand but people are usually shocked when I say I've never owned a spyderco... Figured I'd give it a try :) Also, I think I have that exact gekko knife somewhere in my collection, great knife"

knifeclub,3deim1,Todrick,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:28:39 2015 UTC,"I thought about that possibility. But i wouldnt think i could get the blade to stay half open if the only issue is that its not lubed.

knifeclub,3dbkmx,Calamariecalender,3,Wed Jul 15 01:45:13 2015 UTC,Nice pick. The leek is such a great EDC. I like the color(s) on that one.

knifeclub,3ddbp9,mattyparanoid,3,Wed Jul 15 11:18:07 2015 UTC,"Two months ago I bought the Böker Plus Anti-Grav because it was on sale at woot. I was intrigued with the ceramic blade and carbon fiber handle. After getting it and seeing that there was a similar model in titanium I had to have it too.  So this is one of the 7 I bought over the weekend. I have since returned two that I wasn't happy with. I am very happy with this one. The ceramic blade makes it a special knife and obviously I am not going to be using it for rough duty.  The titanium is really nice (this is my first titanium anything). The blade was perfect out of the box and that gorgeous mirror finish is a finger print magnet. The blade is absolutely evil. Glossy black with a great edge and those really awesome brushed lines.  The action is just like the Anti-Grav and that is to say it is stiff. It is smooth and slow with a steady, velvety friction all the way out. You won't be snapping this one open all lightening fast.  The knife is stupid light and just feels high-tech, modern and futuristic all at the same time."

It cuts well.  It's straight and a perfect EDC.  Reverse tanto aint bad... but for this knife I would probably prefer the normal profile.  If you want a reverse tanto get a 940 at a later date, I would say.  it's on my list.

If you look closely, the blade isn't identical; while the standard Leeks run a hollow grind, making the tip especially thin, the Leeks with upgraded steels (The S30V runs, the composite D2 blade, and now the Elmax blade) have a flat grind. While it's still not an especially strong tip, it's significantly better."

knifeclub,3d8wpc,yohojones,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:04:27 2015 UTC,"It's the space that allows the edge to taper.  So you have full thickness at the spine and taper down to the tip.  The more belly you have to more room there is to taper and the thinner the knife can be behind the edge.  The grind type, (hollow, flat,...) also has an effect on this."

As that wears in over time, the amount that it engages is going to increase. Eventually with enough wear, it won't make contact at all and the blade/lock will be freely independent.   It'd be more worrisome if that thing came almost fully 'engaged'."
knifeclub,3d933c,NoRedditAtWork,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:54:41 2015 UTC,Thanks for your input. As answered in other replies I sent it back. I have little to no experience with frame locks so I may have been premature BUT I didn't like it as compared to the other frame lock I bought at the same time (Kershaw Cryo). That coupled with the horrible flip-action made me send the Nura back.  I may get a Nura 3 a bit later.
knifeclub,3d933c,NoRedditAtWork,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:06:55 2015 UTC,"Someone else made the point that lockup does matter if you're looking to do shit like whacking the hell out of your spine while batoning with a folder or some dumb shit like that, but generally speaking early lockup just means a longer lifespan. Same principle holds true for liner locks.  If you're really looking to get into that nitty gritty, get a fixed blade. It's not a massive factor for most light/medium EDC use"
knifeclub,3d933c,outphase84,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:22:03 2015 UTC,"As I pointed out to another person, engagement like this isn't just susceptible to batoning.  OP was able to make the lock fail with light hand pressure.  What would happen if OP was, say, shaving pine to make kindling for a firepit, and the blade got stuck?  When he tried to free it, the lock would fail and the blade would come right down on his grip.  Early lockup can be a good thing.  This is not early lockup -- this is a lock not fully engaging."

knifeclub,3d933c,outphase84,2,Tue Jul 14 17:16:46 2015 UTC,Great description of lock up and I see the issue. Noted for my next frame lock purchase.
knifeclub,3d933c,AthieFoLyfe,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:26:39 2015 UTC,"Its a cryo. Most I've seen have at least a 65% lock up, and seeing as its steel on steel it shouldn't wear enough to reach 100% anytime in the foreseeable future."
knifeclub,3d933c,outphase84,2,Wed Jul 15 00:23:39 2015 UTC,"Exact same thing happened on my Kershaw. I sent it into the warranty black hole and a month or so later got it back working.  *to be clear, it resulted in not locking correctly and closing on fingers."
knifeclub,3d933c,AthieFoLyfe,4,Tue Jul 14 19:42:22 2015 UTC,The lockup on that is nearly perfect. Not too early and not too late. Plenty of room to break in. That's what most people look for when they get a Framelock.
knifeclub,3d933c,outphase84,2,Tue Jul 14 16:55:14 2015 UTC,"Well, I respect your opinion (and I have no experience with frame locks) but it had such a small bite on the base of the blade. The Cryo I bought at the same time has such a strong bite on the base of the blade so comparing the two made it seem as though the Nura was not right.  The action was also horrible. I sent it back. May get a Nura 3 and see how that turns out."
knifeclub,3d933c,AthieFoLyfe,-3,Tue Jul 14 17:04:48 2015 UTC,There's nothing perfect about that.  I 100% guarantee it would fail from light hand pressure on the spine.
knifeclub,3d933c,outphase84,3,Tue Jul 14 20:13:07 2015 UTC,I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not...

And the funny part is, I'm being down voted when after I posted that, OP said this:     And I did make it fail with just my hands as a test of whether I was keeping it or not. When I snapped it loose with medium to light effort I was convinced it was going back."
knifeclub,3d933c,outphase84,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:52:49 2015 UTC,"Op never stated how he got the lock to disengage, you can put pressure on any lockbar laterally and it'll disengage. An early lockup is what most people look for in frame lock knives. Go look at most any custom maker... almost all high end knives have early lock up with the exception of CRK. I have several knives with the same lockup and I would like to cash in on your 100% guarantee because they won't disengage. Please do some research about knives, Framelocks, lockface geometry, or just go use some knives before spreading misinformation in /r/knifeclub."
knifeclub,3d933c,askeeve,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:10:01 2015 UTC,"If loading the blade in any way causes lock disengagement, the lock failed.   The blade should only release if you intentionally disengage the lockbar. Anything else is a lock failure.   You can try to talk yourself up on knowledge, but the fact is that the lock failed on OP. Not only that, but another poster here had this to say:   Exact same thing happened on my Kershaw. I sent it into the warranty black hole and a month or so later got it back working.  *to be clear, it resulted in not locking correctly and closing on fingers."
knifeclub,3d933c,outphase84,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:17:36 2015 UTC,"If you're laterally pushing on any frame/liner while pressing against the spine of the blade to put knife in a bind, every knife will unlock... because you are unlocking it.

knifeclub,3d933c,askeeve,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:37:36 2015 UTC,"In order to unlock it your finger needs to be in the blade path.   Unless you're talking about side loading the blade causing lock release, which is a lock failure.   The one you linked has about double the lock face engagement with a much thicker lockbar that has more spring tension.  It's safer, but I still wouldn't use that for any hard use tasks."
knifeclub,3d933c,outphase84,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:42:25 2015 UTC,"Got this as one of my 7 binge knives over the weekend. One of the main reasons I got this knife is the bearings and action. Was dissappointed upon opening the box to find it very stiff. OK, no worries, it will work in...  After playing with it at my desk all day I am really unhappy with the lack of frame lock purchase on the blade. If you really crank the blade open with two hands and push the frame lock over, it engages more, but on the whole I am not satisfied.  Maybe it needed more time to work in, maybe it is just the way this knife is and maybe it is a defect but it is going back."
knifeclub,3d933c,Silverlight42,2,Tue Jul 14 13:37:52 2015 UTC,"While that's earlier lockup than most of my knives it's certainly not unsafe.  I think people get really hung up on lock strength when 9 times out of 10 the lock they're worrying about is reinforcing against spine whack which you shouldn't ever do anyways.  It can also come into play if you're prying but... yeah you also shouldn't do that.  This is why cold steel's video's showing 500lbs dropping onto the back of their triad locks never made any sense to me.  Who the fuck is doing that to their knives?  Send it back if you like, but that Nura looks perfect to me.  The lockbar will move over by itself the more you open and close it, and it's certainly not at an unsafe level for light to medium use right now."
knifeclub,3d933c,blitz331,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:56:22 2015 UTC,"I hear what you are saying and I certainly don't have experience with frame locks (this was my first one) but it seemed like it had significantly less purchase on the base of the blade than the other frame lock I bought at the same time.  I also thought about giving it some time but the action was so crappy out of the box that it turned me off. So, didn't like the action, frame bites less of blade than other frame lock=sent it back.  I wasn't thrilled with the design or hand feel after buying it anyway and I bought way too many knives this week so it was a no-brainer to get rid of the one I didn't like."
knifeclub,3d933c,gigajim,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:01:20 2015 UTC,Not just batoning.  What if you're cutting something and it gets stuck?  Last think you want is for the knife to free itself and slam shut on your hand.  I'd never use a knife with lockup that early.  I guarantee you could make that lock fail with nothing but your hands.
knifeclub,3d933c,CorrectionCompulsion,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:14:33 2015 UTC,And I did make it fail with just my hands as a test of whether I was keeping it or not.

I see what everyone else is saying about early lock up and wear-in and I agree but feel this wasn't a keeper for me.

You might wanna get a flat sanding block and 1000 grit paper to clean up the flats of the blades if you want them looking really good again.  My opinion on knives that are tarnished and worn like that is that parents/grandparents take care of their kids in hopes that their kids will wind up better than they were. I take care of the things they give me as heirlooms better than they do. Which means making it nice, and keeping it nice for future generations while getting some use from it. My grandpa or dad wouldn't give me a tool thinking I won't use it, they'd expect me to."

I'm wary of the brass pins, though. Should I even try? I read it's hard to get them out without the proper tools, and even more difficult getting them back in again.

knifeclub,3d8tzz,boomermax,6,Tue Jul 14 12:09:35 2015 UTC,I wouldn't try to take them apart.  I wouldn't soak them either.

Out of the box it is a bit stiff but nothing out of the ordinary and it has loosened up some already.  Blade is not razor sharp as my Leek but a visit to my local farmer's market and their resident knife sharpener will solve that. The overall fit and finish is fantastic. Especially for the price point of this knife ($24.99 on Amazon).  My first frame lock!  Edit: To add, I bought 2 similar Kershaws in this order. This Cryo and a Nura 3.5. I was concerned before they got here that I should have gotten the Nura 3.0 because I am not a fan of large knives but went round and round on getting the Cryo 2... Ends up I feel like the Nura 3.5 is a pretty good size and that I could do with a bit bigger Cryo ala the Cryo2... Never satisfied."

When you heat steel like that, it pulls more chromium into the surface oxide layer and reduces the chromium content of the steel itself.  This makes it much more prone to corrosion, especially when the soft oxidized layer on the surface rubs off.  Notice all that rust forming on your pliers?  That'll happen to any steel you heat.  The darker the colors formed, the more you've damaged the stainless properties of the steel."

What's happening when you heat it is the heat is causing a chemical reaction that forms Fe3O4, which is a form of ferrous oxide, aka black rust. During the formation of the rust, it pulls the chromium to the surface, which forms an invisible layer that refracts light and produces the colors you see. This weakens corrosion resistance of the steel beneath, which is now also exposed to black rust.   The chromium surface layer is also not particularly hard, and wears off, exposing the weakened steel beneath it."

I never really considered just how annoying of a hot spot the default clip was, not to mention the fact it didn't actually function well as a clip.  The stone/acid wash with satin flats has also dramatically reduced the ""billboardiness"" of the blade. Under most light you can hardly see the logos if you're not looking closely.   Lastly, the screws that used to hold the tip-up clip were shortened slightly so they could be reinserted and not stick out too much.   I actually emailed CRKT suggesting that it would be nice to see a tip-down clip on future versions of the Eros, and mentioned that more toned-down blade logos would be nice too. They responded quite quickly and said they've taken those suggestions to heart, that I'm not the only one that has mentioned those things about the Eros, etc. The tone of the reply seemed to express genuine interest about their customers' opinions and a willingness to act on constructive criticism. I suppose we'll see!  Anyways, everything else about this knife is perfect: a nice crisp detent, super smooth IKBS (which CRKT does better than anyone, I'd say), great milling on the handle and blade (the spine of which is nicely rounded), no sharp spots anywhere on the handle, takes a keen edge with quite-serviceable Acuto+ steel, super light with the titanium frame (1.5 ounces!), rock solid lockup, etc.--you get the picture.   Oh, and this was done by Nath Custom!"

knifeclub,3d5l8b,ZiLBeRTRoN,2,Mon Jul 13 19:26:24 2015 UTC,That's a great idea. I'm on it.
knifeclub,3d5l8b,konzy27,5,Mon Jul 13 22:10:17 2015 UTC,So pointy!

knifeclub,3d5l8b,umich2005,3,Mon Jul 13 19:10:25 2015 UTC,"So, on a scale of couch change to spare kidney, how much do I need for this?"
knifeclub,3d5l8b,hippiesrock03,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:22:17 2015 UTC,I can do everything but the clip for about a fraction of a kidney. 1/8733 of a kidney priced by the black market in the US according to Google :)
knifeclub,3d5l8b,Milligan1888,4,Mon Jul 13 20:44:04 2015 UTC,Yeah but how do I know I'll get my kindneysworth?
knifeclub,3d5l8b,hippiesrock03,3,Mon Jul 13 22:24:08 2015 UTC,Its been tested already. You don't remember that night a week ago?
knifeclub,3d5l8b,Vaper_Bern,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:01:38 2015 UTC,The ugly ass tip down clip has been show stopper on buying this knife. It's too bad because I really like the look of it and it would be a great office EDC for me. This mod is amazing and now I may have to grab an Eros and have this done.
knifeclub,3d5l8b,Butchered_human_meat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:11:13 2015 UTC,Man. That thing looks beautiful without that awful stock clip.

knifeclub,3d5dg7,mattyparanoid,2,Mon Jul 13 17:33:54 2015 UTC,"So, it just got here about 2 hours ago. Initial impressions are positive. The box was torn open, so not sure this was a return or at least got gawked at in the warehouse or something. Knife seems to be good, stiff.   I am unsure about the pivot screw, it has the appearance of having been raped by an allen wrench. I'm open to opinions.  The knife itself is such an appealing design to me. The straight back edge, scales with their worn denim appearance and AUS 8 steel is a wonderful tactile mix. It is way to stiff to open with the thumb stud. This is a downer. Also, not a pocket knife! I had read about the blade bite by the tip and the base. I gave it a half-hearted try and I can most assuredly slice my fingers on the blade and catch them on the tip. Not a major issue for me as this is not going to be an EDC, pocketed knife. Definitely a design over-site though.  I feel like it would be amazing in a Tanto blade!  Despite the negatives (Stiff, hard to open with thumb-stud, blade bite issues, possible marred pivot screw) I am really in love with this knife. The materials and design are just that good for me."
knifeclub,3d5dg7,_psycho_dad_,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:43:21 2015 UTC,They've supposedly fixed all of those issues with the flipper ones. Those also come in better steel but are a bit pricier. I haven't heard many positive things about the non flipper older versions.
knifeclub,3d5dg7,Craig,2,Mon Jul 13 18:03:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, saw that after I bought and researched. That'll teach me to buy 7 knives at midnight.   I do love the knife though. The materials, finish and design just grab me."
knifeclub,3d5dg7,RussianFingerTrap,2,Mon Jul 13 18:13:39 2015 UTC,"I just got the titanium version in. I can just catch a finger on the tip while it is closed. Not the sort of thing that is likely to cause a problem. The edge is also a bit close to the open back of the frame when closed, but I think that someone would have to try pretty hard to injure themselves there.  Fantastic flipper. Super sexy design. A bit big for edc, but that didn't stopped me over the weekend.  Even with minor flaws, it is absolutely amazing. I'd love to see one that is about 3/4 the size. There is reportedly a smaller version in the works, but I haven't been able to find any specifics.  OP, check out the Alex Dietz mod for the model you have - it reportedly takes care of the pivot/thumb stud issue you are experiencing, and I think it is a pretty elegant solution."
knifeclub,3d5dg7,RussianFingerTrap,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:19:53 2015 UTC,Looks like the pivot has been abused a bit did you get it off amazon or something?
knifeclub,3d5dg7,Sancho_IV_of_Castile,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:14:17 2015 UTC,"It was Amazon, yes."
knifeclub,3d5dg7,RussianFingerTrap,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:18:50 2015 UTC,I'd let them know you received it that way it was likely an uninspected return they sent you
knifeclub,3d5dg7,uberkeks117,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:28:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have been coming to that decision for the past few minutes or so... Torn between getting another of the same or upgrading to the titanium flipper for $30 more. I really like the scales on this one!"
knifeclub,3d5dg7,uberkeks117,2,Mon Jul 13 18:30:21 2015 UTC,"I'd return this one, get the refund, and wait for the Mini Kwaiken to come out!"
knifeclub,3d5dg7,uberkeks117,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:45:07 2015 UTC,Go ahead and tell them what's up they'll give you options to return for refund or exchange

knifeclub,3d5dg7,sqweexv,2,Mon Jul 13 21:08:45 2015 UTC,topre switches are nice i see why people like them. they feel better than membrane switches and arnt as loud as cherry switches. i just cant type on anything that isn't mx blue any more... but its okay so do my co workers.
knifeclub,3d5dg7,tonhe,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:14:00 2015 UTC,"Cherry mx blue is my prefered switch as well, but the sound doesn't make it ideal for all applications. To put it mildly."

knifeclub,3d59ci,BernoulliMagic,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:29:09 2015 UTC,Has your 940-1 been reprofiled at all? I ask because mine from factory was surprisingly dull and I've since done smaller profile tests but haven't run the full course of the blade to quite the extent I'd like.
knifeclub,3d59ci,BernoulliMagic,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:14:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, from the factory it's quite obtuse, so I reprofiled it to 17 degrees per side, with a 20 degree micro bevel. It slices like a laser beam now."

knifeclub,3d59ci,BernoulliMagic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:36:15 2015 UTC,I had to reprofile mine as well. Definitely worth the effort!
