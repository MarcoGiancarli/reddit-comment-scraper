kratom,3e5exi,CoitusMerryweather,4,Wed Jul 22 02:25:26 2015 UTC,"Make your own posts! As long as it is a useful, honest, and relatively thorough review, most consider that quality content and not bogging down the sub like the same old questions and advertisements we see every day.   Regarding your idea, that was what /r/kratomkorner originally did - a master review and discussion thread for each vendor where people could add their experience or ask questions, vendors could pop in and post updates, respond to feedback or answer questions in one convenient place. It worked for a while, until the mods realized that people can't comment or add anything new to posts over 6 months old. So the vendor threads eventually freeze up where you can only read them. Kcforums uses that format successfully, but that is a totally different forum where posts can remain active for years and aren't based on up or downvotes.   Another issue, most of these good ideas users have would require moderation, something we don't have here. Sure, users could jump on anyone's thread outside the unofficial main and tell them where to go, but it isn't enforceable without active mods. And we all know they ignore us and don't really care about bettering this sub.  Sometimes I will post a mini review in someone else's thread, but if I have something more in depth to say, I like to start my own. A comment can get lost or overlooked more easily. I don't think that kind of content is bad or annoying. Reviews are helpful and can help people make decisions, especially for a vendor that people don't have much experience with. The more the merrier, as long as it contains more information than ""they were good, use them!"""
kratom,3e5exi,Mrs-Poop,2,Wed Jul 22 04:08:58 2015 UTC,It's a good idea but then only people that know of the threads would really use them because how would a newcomer know about them?

kratom,3e5exi,Mrs-Poop,0,Wed Jul 22 02:37:30 2015 UTC,"That's a lovely idea that will never happen. I explained it semi recently, but the short version is the mods tried this once, didn't like the feedback, banned half the sub and have ignored it ever since. They even jumped in and pretended to participate in one of the recent threads trying to form a verified list, only to demand their own business be included in any list ""because fair"", and have ignored any further questions, discussion, or follow through.  Edit: and that was how /r/kratomkorner did it - linked in the sidebar. But after 6 months, you can only read and not participate in the threads."

kratom,3e4gki,fathertedisgod,7,Tue Jul 21 21:52:22 2015 UTC,"I was a courier for fedex for 7 years, and i can tell you one thing, it's not the driver opening your package. It's a violation for them to, and even if they found drugs they wouldn't get promoted. FedEx does bring cops with drug sniffing dogs to the stations and go over everything every once in awhile. Often times the different kinds of envelopes tear in transit. Does this happen to you all the time? The only time they will open a package is if they have a reason to believe it's drugs, or if they have intel from authorities. The authorities will call and tell them to hold whatever they are concerned about, and they come check it out. So yeah, it's definitely not the driver. Those guys are super busy, and have almost impossible deadlines to meet. So they don't give a fuck what they are delivering, they just want it off their truck.(IME)"
kratom,3e4gki,H8toFeel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:18:13 2015 UTC,"good to know it's not the driver as i like that dude. this last time they told me they opened it as ""there was an error and they had to"". that's all i could get out of them.  the other times were no mistake i can assure you. thanks for the inside info on fedex. all i know is when it comes to drugs they work closely with the government and seem to find joy in nailing people.  edit: shit, your post really got me thinking. i'm being watched you think? i deal a lot in bitcoins. they think i'm buying from silkroad? i have never used bitcoins for anything but kratom. oh christ, they do not need a warrant to raid me right? i have nothing illegal but i got 2 dogs and don't want them hurt."

Is it possible that your vendor is being monitored? Do they sell any other substances in addition to kratom? (Note: I'm not asking you to name the vendor, just raising the possibility.)   I vaguely recall reading about a kratom operation that was busted by the police at some point during the past two years. At first, people in the forums were up in arms about the harassment of the kratom industry. But then it turned out that this group was also distributing some genuinely destructive substances (e.g. bath salts) as well as kratom.   I always hate it when people say ""If you're not doing anything wrong, you've got nothing to fear."" There is no good justification for people opening up your mail. But... as far as you and your dogs are concerned, I don't think you need to worry about you or your dogs being hurt."

kratom,3e4gk3,Theresbeerinthefridg,3,Tue Jul 21 22:22:20 2015 UTC,"Ha! But, really, I don't think my question was entirely stupid... I mean, we know that there are differences between drinking kratom as a tea and taking it in capsules. It seemed possible that there might be a difference between swirling it and just swallowing a chunk of powder. I wasn't asking for some sort of superstitious kratom lore. My question clearly stated ""I don't fully understand how drugs are metabolized by my body, so can someone help me out here."" You can mock me for not having a better understanding of these issues, but that's not the same as actually discussing the mechanisms involved."
kratom,3e4gk3,Theresbeerinthefridg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:44:10 2015 UTC,"I don't think it makes a measurable difference. You could theorize that in a toss and wash, stuff clogs up and might get metabolized a tiny bit more slowly than when you swirl, but really, it's not going to make a difference. The reason I don't do toss and wash is that I have no desire to get any of the crap into my lungs, so I want that powder nice and wet before I ingest it. I boil it and drink it as a tea. If you can stomach drinking it (hot or cold), I'd say that's a safer route."

kratom,3e4gk3,Yogihead,2,Wed Jul 22 02:06:25 2015 UTC,"There is no placebo effect with good quality kratom.  Just great Kratom effects.  You need to find a good supplier.  I just mix my one heaping teaspoonful with about two to three ounces of very hot tap water (mild heat only and it seems to activate it better - not hot enough to burn your mouth of course and just enough to mix it up well).  Been doing this for ten years now and any straying away with other methods, etc., would make me think there are placebo effects because other ways (like capsules and toss and wash) don't work with me.  Toss and wash does not work in my mouth at all and is very unpleasant.  Brewing a hot tea makes even tasty kratom taste horrible to me as well.  With my method, I love the taste of kratom and it ALWAYs works superbly."

The batch you mention was fresh, we had literally just gotten it in, but we are honestly having  some difficulties with the vendor that we got it from.  We are still a very new company and are still in process of finding the few solid vendors over seas that we plan to do long term business with.

kratom,3e1roq,bennn30,2,Wed Jul 22 06:04:03 2015 UTC,That's good to hear. At least someone actually cares if they get a bad batch. HS was making me sick for months but wouldn't even reply my emails saying something was wrong. Then that's when you guys came it.

Meaning all pain will be perceived as stronger than it is.

IMO daily use for chronic pain is fine as long as you can manage to take breaks and have a ""wash out period"" every so often. This gets harder the longer you go, I'm definitely dependent on kratom at this point but that is nothing compared to having no quality of life due to pain, and I want to stay away from pharmaceutical opioids as I have had problems with them in the past.

I don't know about you, but the highest dose of any meds my docs will give me is 800mg Ibuprofen, since I'm ""young"" and ""need to learn to handle the pain"".   As others have stated though, it CAN be addicting and you can build up a tolerance to it. So I personally use it on flair days or only a few times a week. I also live in a state where MMJ is legal, so that helps a bit on the off days too. High CBD stuff is awesome for us spoonies!

I have always found that enhancing plain leaf with extracts have given me great results, as it allows me having to take less leaf at each dose."

Here's a bump in that direction.  https://www.google.com/search?q=kratom+alkaloids+synergy&oq=kratom+alkaloids+synergy&aqs=chrome.0.69i59.7823j0j4&client=ms-android-verizon&sourceid=chrome-mobile&espv=1&ie=UTF-8
kratom,3e19nw,Pure_Alks,2,Tue Jul 21 17:53:42 2015 UTC,I have been mixing with regular leaf each time. Im not new to this
kratom,3e19nw,Pure_Alks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:56:27 2015 UTC,"Wasn't saying you were new or not, simply answering your original post of ""not sure how that is even possible"". It's possible because plain leaf and all of the alkaloids within give a synergetic experience vs the emptiness of a couple of alkaloids by themselves."
kratom,3e0r58,MooseKnuckler28,3,Tue Jul 21 01:54:05 2015 UTC,"You can also try fresh kratom, they do not have a $100 min and it is the same as buy kratom-us. A sister site I guess. It is pretty decent kratom and worth it for bulk."
kratom,3e0r58,Chinadollx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:18:30 2015 UTC,"The non-hyphenated one is absurdly expensive and they seem a bit careless and/or irresponsible about the ""not for human consumption"" thing. Too much product detail that implies consumption but then they have the standard disclaimer. Makes me kind of uneasy with how much traction the drug war nazis have gained with kratom."
kratom,3e1n40,Kancklebreaker69,2,Tue Jul 21 07:04:31 2015 UTC,"I've had it once, from Speciosa Specialists I think it was.  It totally screwed up my tolerance and it was so one-note it became unpleasant fast.  It gave me many nasty side effects.  Kratom is best used when taking the full spectrum of natural leaves IMHO."
kratom,3e1n40,Credditsdue,2,Tue Jul 21 16:51:12 2015 UTC,P.S.  I didn't mean full spectrum tincture or any extract like that.  I meant to say the best kratom experience for me comes from good quality kratom in just its natural powdered leaf form.

kratom,3e1n40,esbhb115,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:17:46 2015 UTC,"If it were legit, it'd put us on the fast track to making kratom legal all over, unfortunately. Unless a miracle happened and they decided to research all the alkaloids and their benefits instead."
kratom,3e1n40,Tdrank,6,Tue Jul 21 09:46:09 2015 UTC,Did you mean illegal?
kratom,3e1n40,esbhb115,5,Tue Jul 21 11:21:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes I definitely did lol"
kratom,3e1n40,faceclassic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:48:09 2015 UTC,It is legit. It's an RC.   You're not going to find sources on public subreddits though.
kratom,3e1n40,Brdman_dareal1,0,Tue Jul 21 11:51:11 2015 UTC,Darknet maybe? Or china?
kratom,3e1ftu,budsicle,0,Tue Jul 21 05:39:43 2015 UTC,Is this your shop op?   What do you reccomend for someone with a high opioid tolerance?
kratom,3dzoi4,Herefornow78,5,Mon Jul 20 20:54:00 2015 UTC,"maybe it's a bit of a blessing in disguise, now you'll never need to worry about building a tolerance and you can always be sure you have the option of having a very special weekend."
kratom,3dzoi4,vctflooring,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:58:58 2015 UTC,very good point
kratom,3dzoi4,stackz07,2,Mon Jul 20 21:01:54 2015 UTC,I replaced my add prescription with kratom. Works way better.
kratom,3dzoi4,Chinadollx,3,Mon Jul 20 22:20:50 2015 UTC,When I worked in food service I needed my adhd meds. I was able to get off of them because of job changes but that is not always a possibility. They were a blessing in disguise when I needed them the most. Some strains of kratom do work for some of my symptoms but tolerance grows so fast that I cannot take them all the time. I am glad you found kratom and can use on the weekends to unwind. In comparison to other things it is safer (in my opinion) than drinking or other things. Enjoy it when you can.
kratom,3dzoi4,WhosCountin,3,Mon Jul 20 22:18:18 2015 UTC,"It's so interesting how different people react to things. I take kratom after work only on weekdays because it basically fixes my adderall comedown completely. Before I'd use weed or other drugs to kind of dull the shittiness, but kratom doesn't do that. Instead of fucking me up until the comedown doesn't bother me, it actually makes it go away: takes away the fried feeling, the negative emotions, gives me energy and focus, makes me social again... Basically just takes me from amphetamine crash to feeling normal and in a good mood. And if I've taken too much, it definitely gives me more of an opiate stoned out feeling even on adderall days. My go-to is Maha Kali from Herbal Salvation. 3-4g usually balances out the adderall comedown whereas 5-6g is much more sedating and druggy and ""recreational"" by some definitions. I usually enjoy the lower dose more because I've spent long enough choosing between feeling drugged and feeling shitty. Feeling good without being altered is a godsend"
kratom,3dzoi4,Mrs-Poop,3,Tue Jul 21 00:38:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks everyone.  Honestly, given my meds work so well and their monitored by my MD, I'd prefer to stay on my ADHD meds... That and my insurance covers my meds, not Kratom lol."
kratom,3dzoi4,Theresbeerinthefridg,3,Mon Jul 20 23:26:49 2015 UTC,"It's almost like a guarantee that when anyone posts about any meds they rely on, there will be a few comments telling them to just get off them, that you don't need that shit! I'm sure that works for some, and good for you!  In general, this is irresponsible and I am glad you left this comment saying you don't intend to do that. I know some meds aren't necessarily the best or safest and a lot of doctors are too quick to just hand out pills. But you mentioned the severity of your condition. You didn't come here for advice or opinions on your meds. We are not experts, do not have intimate knowledge of your condition, and you could be seeing an amazing doctor for all we know who is truly helping you. To OP and anyone else who receives similar comments, please take this kind of advice with a grain of salt, especially when you weren't having a problem and weren't asking for the advice.  It would be lovely if everyone was perfectly healthy and didn't need to rely on some kind of assistance. It would be wonderful if the state of medicine and healthcare, at least in the US, was better. But too many people have these prejudices to medications and think no one needs them. That is just irresponsible advice to push on someone who wasn't asking and these types of comments bother me.  Anyway OP, I have seen people mention using kratom for the comedown of those types of meds safely. I am sure I would want the option. But if you think it would be a problem, it is best to be safe. Some people talk to their doctors about kratom but it seems very hit or miss if they respond favorably or even know what it is. Some meds have been found to kind of cancel out the effects of kratom. My Xanax used to but strangely the Klonopin I get now doesn't really seem to as badly.   If you do have to keep it to the weekend, like vctflooring said, that probably isn't a bad thing. You won't go through as much product as fast or spend as much, you have something small to look forward to, you can keep your tolerance in control, you are less likely to develop a dependence, and you can likely retain a lot of that ""magic"" that people talk about and sometimes lose if they use kratom too frequently. As long as you have some good strains on hand, you have a better chance of enjoying the times you are able to use it. I'm sorry you aren't finding it to be an option on those bad days though."
kratom,3dzoi4,otistoole,2,Tue Jul 21 12:20:20 2015 UTC,What a great response.  Right on!
kratom,3dzoi4,keyboardcat0,2,Wed Jul 22 02:32:32 2015 UTC,"Has anyone found any scientific evidence around Kratom's safety?  And when picking a supplier, how do you know they can be trusted...?  I imagine the hands of the workers, the bags the leaf is stored in, etc are most likely filthy.  Not to mention pesticides.  I personally only have used suppliers that specify they're organic but how do I know they're not just saying that?  Also, I gaurentee were all ingesting lots of crushed bugs... That's probably not a health concern but nevertheless, gross!"
kratom,3dzoi4,thrroow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:31:35 2015 UTC,"No one knows exactly how safe kratom is. It's probably pretty safe because it's been used for a long time, and if any particular diseases were associated with even moderate kratom habits, this would probably be well known by now. However, that does not mean that the astronomical amounts some people take for recreational purposes are safe. It doesn't even mean moderate consumption is safe in the long term. So, what you are planning is actually a very healthy thing. Keep your intake low and, enjoy your low tolerance, and don't put more kratom into your body than necessary.  As for the filthy hands, that's true. But then again, life is filthy. The person who makes your food at a restaurant, the pickers who pick your apples, etc. I don't think there is a need to worry about that. Same for pesticides. Pesticides are expensive, so I doubt they spray trees that grow naturally all over the place. And again, if you consume only small amounts of kratom, this is not something you really have to worry about."
kratom,3dzoi4,otistoole,0,Tue Jul 21 05:44:36 2015 UTC,"I read somewhere that combining stimulants and kratom could cause seizures.  I don't have a source or anything, but it might be something to check into."
kratom,3dzoi4,esbhb115,3,Mon Jul 20 22:48:38 2015 UTC,"Panic attack maybe, seizure no"
kratom,3dzoi4,stacyships,2,Tue Jul 21 14:49:04 2015 UTC,"From what I've read, that's not true for Kratom and my med but who knows, you could be right!  Either way, I'm not mixing."
