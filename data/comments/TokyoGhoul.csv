TokyoGhoul,3e3yds,LeMitchington,2,Tue Jul 21 22:07:11 2015 UTC,"There's too much left out to make a ;re anime. They'd either need to ignore Root A or give it a Fullmetal Alchemist treatment and remake the whole thing following the manga (Highly unlikely but hey a guy can hope!). They do show Kanou talking briefly at the end of ep.1 of Root A but then proceed to never show him again. The fact that he can artificially create ghouls, working with Aogiri to do so now and Rize still being alive are all too big to leave out and anime only watchers will get confused as shit. Then Hide being dead in Root A is another thing seeing as it looks like he might still be alive (As Avokk says in a earlier reply). More or less too much was left out to carry on."
TokyoGhoul,3e3yds,konart,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:50:27 2015 UTC,"What would the anime do if the he were to resurface in the manga   They just would continue with original script, not manga, lol."

TokyoGhoul,3e3yds,Kyuubi87,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:06:53 2015 UTC,"The anime wasn't really made with the intention of continuing I think. If they do a third season, they might just ignore Root A and follow the manga continuity (covering the earlier events in flashbacks or OVAs).  EDIT: Black Butler Book of Circus is doing something like that, so it may be possible for TG. A reboot would be great, but it's likely Pierrot will want to adapt :re sooner rather than later."
TokyoGhoul,3e3yds,TheMikarin,2,Tue Jul 21 20:12:06 2015 UTC,I hope they'll continue in some form at least
TokyoGhoul,3e3yds,LeMitchington,2,Tue Jul 21 20:24:26 2015 UTC,"I hope so too, I'd really like to see the Quinx and Pineapple animated. It would be great if they could follow the manga instead of going with Root A's version of events. That way there's less chance of it having to go ""original"" again."
TokyoGhoul,3e3ent,Saliber,9,Tue Jul 21 17:31:02 2015 UTC,"RC pathways, when half ghouls get injured, their newly transferred kakuhou sends RC cells to the area of injury to heal it instantly and the damaged muscles are repaired and made stronger...apparently these trail of RC cells are permanent and Rc cells can move to such locations with ease to heal or strength it Note~ Ghouls already have RC pathways from birth and it is standard and can not be increased as it heredity, Sasaki's strength is also owed to Rize's abnormal regenerative RC cells not just his injuries."
TokyoGhoul,3e3ent,Vermillion-ghoul,3,Tue Jul 21 17:50:54 2015 UTC,"Wow thank you so much :D!  One last dumb question, did the doctor explicitly say that only the Q's and half ghouls can become stronger using RC pathways? Maybe it was a translation error, but I took it to mean that he was informing Urie that this trait applied to he and the Q's as well, not that the Q's and half ghouls exclusively had this ability. I'm probably completely wrong XD"
TokyoGhoul,3e3ent,konart,2,Tue Jul 21 18:01:21 2015 UTC,ghouls coming stronger through being hurt   Pretty much the same goes for any human. You hurt you muscles during workout and as a counter-measure your body builds more muscle.   PS: that's why Urie is trying to over-stress his body in a gym
TokyoGhoul,3e3ent,Akiba_kei,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:31:34 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, I think that both normal and ""half ghouls"" (including the Q's) benefit from the pathways. As Konan says, when you work out you tear your muscles, so your body builds stronger muscles. However this does not mean that both ghouls and ""half ghouls"" gain equally by being injured. It could be that ""half ghouls"" gain strength faster because as they are injured their ""human parts"" regenerate as ""ghoul parts."" Also, genetics have a big factor on the level of strength as a ghoul, some ghouls are just naturally stronger than others. As for the Qs, their kagune should be stronger than most weaker ghouls because A) the CCG wouldn't give the Qs shitty kakuhou, and B) the aptitude test the Qs took meant they had the best genetic capabilities for the job."

Which is fine, I think we just need some ideas, not the generic discussion bullshit I did in the past. Stiff that is fresh. An example being Mikarins Arima vs Kaneki thing. I'm fine with hatching up some ideas just give me time."
TokyoGhoul,3e210p,stauf1515,2,Tue Jul 21 14:38:30 2015 UTC,"I'd like to suggest that if you do reread, use twisted hel scans site. They've already finished all of tg and are currently doing :re. I recently reread the whole series and what I read when the chapters were first released and what I reread on twisted hel scans was like night and day. Excellent translations, all the bonus pages at the beginning and end of chapters are there, and the redraws are extremely crisp and clean. My favorite TG site by far until I eventually buy the manga. You'll notice a lot more things clearly and the translation makes the read much better if you haven't read their version already."
TokyoGhoul,3e18jv,Gregory_Fontaine,10,Tue Jul 21 04:25:50 2015 UTC,"I personally don't think Eto is the strongest ghoul. I mean I wouldn't be surprised if someone like Kaiko was 10x stronger.  But I will say she's the strongest ghoul we've seen yet, her speed feats are certainly OP. Her kakuja is pretty ridiculous and while she may give up speed in that form, she's still swift in that giant thing.  Arima is as everyone deems him, the death god, he pretty much carries the CCG on his shoulders, he's fast, intelligent, and strong.  But at the end of the day, he's still human. One good impale from a kagune of any type is enough to put him out for good.  I mean the only thing that makes him so strong is the fact that he stays calm during battles.  He doesn't lose control or is under the influence of insanity like Kaneki and Eto.  As for Shachi, well....  ""KAI!"""
TokyoGhoul,3e18jv,Pyrofrozen,3,Tue Jul 21 06:56:03 2015 UTC,"I imagine there's stronger ghouls out there possibly some in V however Kaiko isn't even close to as strong as Eto, I think some of the ghouls that live underground may be extremely strong due to the amount of cannibalizing that happens down there.   He brought 2 other people with him when approaching Yoshimura and then goes on to say he'd of brought more then ""a lot more you know"" if he'd wish to kill him.   Eto after the timeskip if she's continued eating ghouls may have gotten much stronger / her kakuja will have grown/strengthened. She may be strong enough to kill Arima now and I imagine she is/will in RE however until we see evidence she's gotten stronger the order will be -   Arima > Eto > Shachi"
TokyoGhoul,3e18jv,TG_Juuzou,2,Tue Jul 21 10:20:29 2015 UTC,"This is true about Kaiko, he's definitely not a beast like Eto.  Pretty sure that Kaiko meant the CCG when he mentioned ""a lot more.""   I don't think Arima could die at the hands of anyone but Haise/Kaneki for plot reasons, and he'll definitely be strong enough eventually, but it's possible that Eto would be capable of killing Arima, especially if she's still cannibalizing. She'd have to use a kakuja form with more speed I imagine"
TokyoGhoul,3e18jv,dippindots326,3,Tue Jul 21 14:52:29 2015 UTC,Personally I see it as Arima>Eto>Shachi. I don't think we have seen enough from Shachi though to say how strong he really is and people may have gotten stronger over the time skip between TG and :Re
TokyoGhoul,3e18jv,Jalidric,2,Tue Jul 21 04:42:33 2015 UTC,"THIS IS GOING TO BE LONG!, Eto can never affect a raid on the scale of the huge one eye owl as a tiny & petite lady, do you know how many people she alone kills in a raid?(answer:a lot), and she is left open during transformation and reversion...Arima is systematic and intelligent too but he can't face off eto as a petite half ghoul. Because after transformation she is more chaotic than reasonable....Shachi is durable but sorry he is not on their level, and we also neglect the effects of electricity on any ghoul, electricity causes numbness in any typical manga and just imagine how many jolts of electricity reducing Etos speed considerably.Noro is another competitor...his kagune is formidable too...his piece back healing is also remarkable."
TokyoGhoul,3e18jv,Vermillion-ghoul,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:31:13 2015 UTC,Arima is the god of death for a reason. I doubt Eto or Shachi could come close to beating him alone especially since he absolutely dumpstered eto.
TokyoGhoul,3e18jv,skumbag_steve,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:26:46 2015 UTC,"But I would argue that Eto took that form not as a means to go toe to toe with the likes of Arima but to be able to tank damage and dish it out. She was there specially to retrieve Yoshimura, the only reason she fought for as long as she did was because she's a sadist and enjoys it. I feel that if her intent was to kill Arima, she would put up a better fight and IMO would slaughter him."
TokyoGhoul,3e18jv,skumbag_steve,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:48:31 2015 UTC,Eh idk it depends on w/e ishida wants to write. I'd still argue that Arima is near unkillable at the moment because if Eto really could beat Arima she'd have already done it since Arima fucks up Aogiri's plans all the time.
TokyoGhoul,3e18jv,TheMikarin,2,Tue Jul 21 07:50:31 2015 UTC,"Eto probably could kill Arima, but it would be a very difficult fight where her own life would be on the line. Her Kakuja form gives her enough protection to survive the encounters without much injury, but it takes away the speed she would need to actually fight Arima evenly. If she fought Arima without her Kakuja, both of them would be fighting on even grounds more or less (Arima probably still having a slight advantage). Eto probably isn't willing to risk her life just yet, and also wants to keep her identity as hidden as possible for the time being, so fighting him outside of her Kakuja state isn't worth it.   Basically, the Kakuja form keeps her safe but prevents her from fighting him properly due to the speed difference. She's probably not willing to risk her life until it's absolutely essential for Aogiri's goals."
TokyoGhoul,3e18jv,Alluka-,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:05:26 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I guess we'll have to wait and see"
TokyoGhoul,3e18jv,stauf1515,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:54:34 2015 UTC,"I think Eto stands more of a chance in her regular form because of how fast she is. When she activates her Kakuja she's basically a huge target even though she's insanely strong and tanky.  I'd say Arima is the strongest out of these 3 though. If you were to include other ghouls into this, I'm still a believer that Uta could go toe to toe with Arima."
TokyoGhoul,3e18jv,_Iroha,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:33:06 2015 UTC,"I see what your saying to about eto's speed in her non-kakuja form, but it was against the twins (who are probably s level) and banjou. Might I remind you that arima has a similar if not better speed feet as well.   Eos kaneki in Tokyo ghoul (who beat 2 special classes, Amon with arata and a new quinque, and who fought sachi pretty evenly the second time before being the centipede) was staring straight at arima from across the room when arima warped behind him and stabbed him through the head. Kaneki didn't even realize arima moved until his head had already been impaled.  If blitzing end story centipede kaneki isn't considered fast, I don't know what the hell is."
TokyoGhoul,3e1guu,jas0660,3,Tue Jul 21 05:51:07 2015 UTC,"They flipped 2 arcs in the show. They didn't skip chapters, they ""moved"" them. Don't worry."
TokyoGhoul,3e1guu,awsomthing,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:42:42 2015 UTC,"Ok good, thanks for the heads up. I was really annoyed because the missing/moved chapters had good material in them. This being my first run through of the show, I thought it was cut entirely to keep the plot moving"
TokyoGhoul,3e1guu,TheMikarin,3,Tue Jul 21 12:53:55 2015 UTC,"Remember, read up to chapter 79 or so before watching episode 11 and 12. The anime switches around some events there, so it's better to finish the arc in the manga before watching the anime's version, to avoid getting confused.  Don't bother with Root A until you've at least read until the end of the first manga (chapter 143). It spoils some twists in the story while omitting major plot points, and is just a what-if version of events which expects you to have read the manga already to fully understand it.  The Gourmet arc and Doves arc were switched in the anime. While it's not nearly as bad as cutting the Doves arc out, it does present some issues regarding Kaneki's development, especially when you get to the last episode of the season. Cutting out Touka training him also caused some problems there (Yomo training him alone was supposed to replace it, but it wasn't done properly at all)."

TokyoGhoul,3e0atz,Vosska,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:27:46 2015 UTC,The people who choose to become a ghoul probably won't live an interesting enough life afterwards to warrant all the risk and sacrifice. The likelihood of living an unbearable life (since they've already experience being human and now they can't go back) and dying a miserable death becomes very high.

Its not solely a dark action packed series, nor is it just a how much suffering can be heaped on one person, its a series about what it means to be Human and how everyone, human or ghoul has wants and needs and companionship.  Love is a part of this, a very natural part and it serves to humanise the characters more and make them far more relatable. That's why I think it will happen in some form as Ishida seems to understand this. Sasaki never felt more relatable to me than when he was a early 20s man having a crush in the pretty waitress at the coffee shop, same as Touka falling for Kaneki when he was sweet, shy and caring, not his ""badass"" Shironeki side. I don't think Touka even realised how she felt until we see her in RE anyway, realistic for a teenager with the issues she has, not being able to understand her own feelings until she got older.  Anyway that's just my opinion on the matter, so yes I do think something will happen"
TokyoGhoul,3dz6b8,Vanayzan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:36:38 2015 UTC,I think that with all the dark things happening in the series this could be a bright spot you know? Like sasaki/kaneki has a dark life but touka brings light to it

The art gets significantly better and the characters become more complex and interesting. The manga does a great job of giving many characters a spotlight and helps develop them from being background characters to characters you actually care about. That's what I love about Tokyo Ghoul the most.
TokyoGhoul,3dxw5w,Eliteshinobi14,16,Mon Jul 20 12:59:40 2015 UTC,There's a theory that Hide is part of the Washuu family. It's been mentioned here a few times.

Floppy is a group of ghouls consisting of Amon and the twins  \4.

TokyoGhoul,3du8oe,uncountableB,11,Sun Jul 19 15:03:25 2015 UTC,"I feel like with the arcs being parallel to the original, Haise is bound to run into Tsukiyama, I'm sure everyone agrees. The thing with ;Re in comparison to TG, everytime someone significant re-enters Haises life in stressful situations, Kaneki becomes more dominant and even in some cases, like with Nishiki, he takes control again. This is bad, or as you put it TRAGIC for Haise because the more Kaneki returns, the more Haise fades. Now don't get me wrong, I wanna see Kaneki back BUT the timing has to be right. If something happens to Tsukiyama and Haise has another episode, the CCG higher ups could react badly to it. If Haise can't keep control who knows how that'll take with the rest of the Q's. Like you said if something happens to Tsukiyama there will be serious implications on the future plot! Solid theory too by the way! :)"
TokyoGhoul,3du8oe,LeMitchington,8,Sun Jul 19 18:57:59 2015 UTC,"I personally don't subscribe to the idea that Haise and Kaneki are two separate people. Haise is just Kaneki with lost memories, and a chance to grow out other parts of his personality other than his quest for power, like his sense of humor, empathy, strictness (but not excessive), etc.   And true. Either Haise has to keep himself in check no matter much pain he feels, or he might end up in Cochlea (super bad if Tokage would be in charge of him, but not likely). And thanks! We'll see what happens, but with Ishida, who knows!"
TokyoGhoul,3du8oe,_jkim_,5,Sun Jul 19 21:14:57 2015 UTC,"hmm I agree with a lot of the things you're saying. I also think Tsukiyama may suffer a tragic death, one that translates to more development of the Haise/Ken struggle with identity. I am gonna go ahead and predict that Tuskiyama will sacrifice himself for Kaneki's sake, abandoning his family and its reputation which will result in his family's demise. BUT in a very much Ishid-esque moment of complete badassery, Kanae will be inspired by his beloved master's death and will to shift his loyalty to Kaneki. So excited for this arc!"
TokyoGhoul,3du8oe,Earthbounded,6,Sun Jul 19 19:05:21 2015 UTC,"this seems pretty plausible but I STILL don't want Tsukiyama to die :( I feel like literally no one substantial dies in this manga...Hide (maybe, probably), Kaneki, Nishiki, Amon, Tsukiyama survived un-survivable situations, which makes me doubt if anyone will die in this manga."
TokyoGhoul,3du8oe,_jkim_,3,Sun Jul 19 21:05:58 2015 UTC,"Wow. That would be crazy. And extremely sad. But I have been wondering why exactly Kanae has been getting so much screen time. If he was just a device to bring Tsukiyama back into the fold, he wouldn't need this much development. Heck, even now, we only really focus on Kanae, despite Tsukiyama being back in the picture. I'm super curious at where his development will lead."
TokyoGhoul,3du8oe,LeMitchington,2,Sun Jul 19 21:17:16 2015 UTC,yea Ishida is not one to waste his efforts on characters who won't have a significant impact on the course of the arc. Kanae has yet to fulfill a greater purpose in the Haise/Kaneki dilemma.
TokyoGhoul,3du8oe,_jkim_,2,Sun Jul 19 23:32:34 2015 UTC,And that way Kanae would become Haise's sword much the same as Tsukiyama was Kaneki's! D:
TokyoGhoul,3du8oe,LeMitchington,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:21:34 2015 UTC,Yea exactly! I think it follows very well with this dual theme of continuity vs change that Ishida has been focusing on.

TokyoGhoul,3dvljt,Eliteshinobi14,8,Sun Jul 19 22:09:11 2015 UTC,"i will make you a summary but wont give you too many spoilers: after the fight with arima, due to the brain damage kaneki has amnesia and can't remember nothing about himself. He become a ghoul investigator and makes his own squad with half ghouls human (more like 30-40% they are more humans then ghouls). now we are on a route to discover what happened with the others characters in this gap of 3 years and Haise (kaneki's new name) struggle to accept himself (again...) and discover who he was."
TokyoGhoul,3dvljt,Dobor_olita,2,Sun Jul 19 22:56:02 2015 UTC,Ah so basically he is most likely going to find and completely accept himself again and become keneki or something. Cool

TokyoGhoul,3dvljt,TheMikarin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:08:26 2015 UTC,yea most one eyed ghouls seem to be vastly superior to ghould where with the quinx it is the opposite they are like a weak ghoul you could say.

TokyoGhoul,3dvljt,LeMitchington,4,Mon Jul 20 12:41:53 2015 UTC,"You did read the first manga right? If you only watched the anime, go back and read the manga from chapter 1, since the anime left out a lot of content and changed things. There's a lot of important plot points that the anime skipped that play a major role in :re. If you read the manga already, the anime is a what-if version of the story that you can check out if you feel like it. It's pretty good as a supplement to the manga (not so much as a standalone). There's also some other TG related content you might want to check out.  Basically here's the reading order:  Tokyo Ghoul (chapters 1 to 143): http://bato.to/read/_/67864/tokyo-ghoul_v1_ch1_by_lazy-ass-scans  Tokyo Ghoul:JACK: http://bato.to/read/_/269972/tokyo-ghoul-jack_v1_ch1_by_kawa-scans  Tokyo Ghoul:JOKER: http://bato.to/read/_/257690/tokyo-ghoul_by_twisted-hel-scans  Tokyo Ghoul:re (absolutely essential to read after the first manga, no matter what you think of the first manga's ending): http://imperialscans.com/read/tokyo-ghoul-re/1-bone/1  JACK and JOKER are optional, and can be read even after you catch up to :re. Despite JOKER taking place in between the first manga and :re, it was actually released around halfway through the first manga. Most people assumed it was non-canon, but it turns out it actually takes place after the first manga. Since it does contain minor spoilers, read it only after finishing the first manga. JACK actually has a different style from the regular manga.  Another bit of content you can read for fun is the Tokyo Ghoul  ONESHOT. It's essentially the prototype for Tokyo Ghoul, the early version the author drew before doing the actual series we know. It's completely non-canon, but interesting to see.

Then there's an awful lot left out of the Aogiri arc, it only shows Banjou briefly in Anteiku before Yamori takes Kaneki. Then after that it jumps forward to the CCG Raid on the place when Kaneki breaks but leaves out him and the Anti-Aogiri trying to escape and Kaneki fighting the Bin Brothers never happened in the anime too. More or less S1 leaves a lot out but you get most of what's happening. S2 then ... well it was Ishida's original plan for the manga and I'm glad he didn't go with it. A lot of things happen in Root A that happen in the manga, but with a completely different context eg Shinohara vs Kaneki happens but for completely different reasons, then it comes to a pretty similar conclusion except a 4 minute acoustic version of Unravel to make you cry like a bitch!  Overall I'd say if you wanna watch it, definitely do. Just know going in the manga is much better and not to expect the same really."

TokyoGhoul,3duvi0,old-mcdonald,2,Sun Jul 19 23:22:18 2015 UTC,It's neither Ishida's original plan for the manga nor has season 2 any relation with the draft Ishida made for the anime staff. The anime staff ignored Ishida's draft. Ask the director of the anime why that is so.
TokyoGhoul,3duvi0,old-mcdonald,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:27:56 2015 UTC,"Cool. Exactly the explanation I was looking for. I'll throw it on my To-Watch list, but I'll wait until the manga isn't so fresh in my mind, maybe I'll enjoy it more then. Thanks."

Its great seeing most of the scenes you read about in a beautifully animated scene (first season only, they fucked up real bad in the second season), and comparing the different outcomes that came with 1 key choice in the first episode of Root A. (Root A is pretty terrible tho, even worse for those who didnt read the manga as nothing is really explained and plots and characters are left out or introduced and later forgotten)  And then cry like a bitch at the end of Root A"

TokyoGhoul,3dq2lq,FogKnight22,7,Sat Jul 18 09:53:38 2015 UTC,"This is great, but I sort of wish they would first just do an OVA or two recapping the manga's events or something so that we could get a good :re adaptation sooner. There's enough content for a single season, and they wouldn't have to cut out so much content if they only adapted around 30 chapters.  I'm starting to get the feeling that there will be a third season based on :re since the OVAs are related to characters who are important in it, but with the changes made in Root A and the content that was outright omitted I'm worried that they'll have to go ""original"" again or run into major plot holes if they stick to the Root A continuity. I suppose they could adapt it up to the Auction arc without running into any major problems that can't be easily explained in dialogue, but now the story is slowly starting to address and reference earlier manga-only events, so the :re adaptation would have to pick a continuity at some point.  I'm glad Tsukiyama will at least get a bit more screentime, since despite being poorly developed in the anime, he was immensely entertaining when he did appear."
TokyoGhoul,3dq2lq,TheMikarin,2,Sat Jul 18 15:16:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah this OVA element for tsukiyama is a nesscesity as anime onlys tend to to think he's just some mindless psychopath, which he's not."

It seems the management of Pierrot also wasn't happy with the work of the anime's director."

I especially like the parallels in terms of personality and even appearance (eyepatch, etc.)   Considering that Mutsuki and Suzuya have worked together closely on the Nutcracker case and Suzuya knows of the interrogator's true nature (at least in terms of killing animals), I think there's also a good chance of another 'Suzuya to the rescue' event.  I'm just struggling to think of how Mutsuki would end up being tortured in the first place- perhaps the QS go renegade at some point in the future or the interrogator goes as far as abducting a fellow CCG member."
TokyoGhoul,3dqvby,Briguy52,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:22:33 2015 UTC,"I think the only reason they made mutsuki transgender was because Ishida wanted a character that was similar to kaneki but fans wouldn't go crazy speculating a romantic relationship between the two. I think besides that there isn't many major differences in who kaneki used to be. And yamori said he hated people like kaneki who are weak and morally guided. If the investigator in this series in Yamori then Mutsuki is the innocent kaneki and Haise is just himself, a strong version kinder version of ghoul kaneki, but he's different than the old kaneki even Hinami commented that their personalities are different.  Edit: Just wanted to add glad you found it interesting though I just wanted to add that bit about why the writers wanted a transgender mutsuki."

TokyoGhoul,3dnwvv,yourstrulyct,-2,Fri Jul 17 23:58:58 2015 UTC,It was an example.
TokyoGhoul,3dnwvv,ThreeEyedFool,3,Sat Jul 18 00:01:32 2015 UTC,"Floppy = Amon is pretty much 99% confirmed, I don't think we need someone to hear someone call Floppy Amon to be sure.  As far as who he's working with, I highly doubt he would be working with normal ghouls like Banou or Hinami given his bias. First of all Banjou cut himself off from Aogiri for good, I don't see a weakling like him voluntarily involving himself further with anything to do with Aogiri, much less be sought out by Amon. Hinami was a high ranking member of Aogiri and her main focus was to find Kaneki, I doubt she would have needlessly endangered herself by being a mole for an anti-Aogiri group.  Amon's group is likely made of other formerly CCG human half-ghouls screwed over by Aogiri. He mentions the name Yasuhisa so one of the twins could be with him."
TokyoGhoul,3dnwvv,oredaore,0,Sat Jul 18 07:22:25 2015 UTC,The link I show though confirms that floppy whether its a group or amon as an individual is against aogiri. Banjou was against aogiri alongside kaneki and just because kaneki is gone I doubt he would just give up the fight against them so easily. Afterall after the timeskip he should be mastering his kagune by now.
TokyoGhoul,3dnwvv,oredaore,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:20:17 2015 UTC,"Banjou was forced against his will to be part of Aogiri. If he managed to escape back then he would have been living peacefully probably in another ward with his friends. The only reason why he continued to go against Aogiri after the 11th ward HQ was destroyed was because he wanted to help Kaneki to repay him. If Anteiku hadn't been destroyed he would have joined Anteiku alongside Kaneki. From what Hinami said, Banjou's group hasn't had anything to do with Aogiri in those two years, and it's unlikely that Amon or Banjou would be in contact with each other to form a group."
TokyoGhoul,3dnwvv,ThreeEyedFool,2,Sat Jul 18 15:09:41 2015 UTC,"The first part, obviously heard it before. But Hinami being a mole for Floppy would be quite interesting and fits for a likely scenario, I'm just wondering why they would work together now."

TokyoGhoul,3dnwvv,TG_Juuzou,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:49:19 2015 UTC,Ty I will when I first took up the manga I read the major arcs and skimmed through the boring ccg ones and used combination of wikis and summaries to fill myself in so I could go through the last 10 chapters along with the anime into tokyo ghoul re. I haven't had the time to analyze the previous chapters so far like the numbers that randomly appear on characters when major things are going to happen.
TokyoGhoul,3dnwvv,Ultagh,2,Sat Jul 18 01:00:36 2015 UTC,"We know Floppy is the name of the group not an individual it was a translation error by imperialscans.   We know Amon is part of the group Floppy and it appears he's began cannibalizing, Kurona/Nashiro are very likely part of Floppy if they're alive due to when Amon says there names could of just been remembering them/imaging them in the struggle he is now etc.  There's no chance they'd use Hinami as a mole especially as she was still essentially a child when she went to Aogiri. In Tokyo Ghoul when she visits a coffee shop with Tsukiyama Eto comes into the Cafe using her human identity as the author Takatsuki. She clearly has an interest in her + like you mentioned she also did with Amon, she even gives her contact details in case she needs to talk. I'm pretty sure she was manipulated into joining and regrets it but knows she can't just leave without any repercussions.  Banjou is highly likely a Floppy member and I personally think Shachi is a member as well. Banjou would never allowed Hinami to go into Aogiri as a spy either you have to remember they spent around 6 months as a team and became pretty close he'd of viewed her like a little sister.   I don't think RE is involved with Floppy in any way at all however with Hinami imprisoned + Kaneki starting to break through I think they'll be dragged into something soon. Currently I imagine Touka is just helping ghouls out like Yoshimura did and Yomo is likely just being a shady bad ass."
TokyoGhoul,3dnwvv,ThreeEyedFool,4,Sat Jul 18 15:48:19 2015 UTC,"It's not a group. They said ""Floppy-tachi"" in the raws which means Floppy's group or Floppy and his group. So Floppy is an individual but is affiliated with his own group."
TokyoGhoul,3dnwvv,TG_Juuzou,2,Fri Jul 17 23:45:45 2015 UTC,Hinami also killed Mado and is a chimera ghoul. Who also had both her parents killed and those who cared about her. I don't think her age matters.

TokyoGhoul,3dltfb,Vermillion-ghoul,5,Fri Jul 17 08:49:24 2015 UTC,Yoshimura's orders. He probably tailed Kaneki's group knowing he was going after Kanou. Anything else beyond that you'd have to ask Ishida.

TokyoGhoul,3dhrjg,Loathsome_mask,11,Thu Jul 16 11:16:41 2015 UTC,Well according to this google docs (Which is pretty damn good imo):  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fqsUoWwlLm0ineOAzAQrpW7BHqPvPi3NgdzMBDjpIGs/edit  It will be around Volume 5-6 when he passes through the Moon and Sun and completes the required journey through that part. So around Chapter 70-90 would be the most likely.  Though my calculations might be a bit off.
TokyoGhoul,3dhrjg,Ellefied,6,Thu Jul 16 11:52:43 2015 UTC,"correct, if ishida is doing a parellel to TG (which i think he is) then it will be around that time, since chapter 70+ was when kaneki accepted his ghoul side."
TokyoGhoul,3dhrjg,Cradenz,8,Thu Jul 16 13:23:19 2015 UTC,"When they sentence Hinami to death he will have to make a choice of what is really important for him, it will be then when he will have to accept himself, he is Haise and he was Kaneki, he needs to accept his past and what happened to him, he is a half ghoul and he had friends in Anteiku that were good people and helped him when he needed, he can't forget his past, when that happen, I believe he will save her and accept his right punishment or get away."
TokyoGhoul,3dhrjg,Radinax,4,Thu Jul 16 16:16:09 2015 UTC,"I agree. Something drastic is going to have to happen to Haise again. Just like what happend during the torture session with Jason. Although it might not be turture in this arc. Someone will either have to die, or Haise will learn about how close Hide and Kaneki were. I doubt they would sweep Hide's existence under the rug just because he's ""dead"". He was much to important to Kaneki. Since Kaneki couldn't help save Hinami's parents I doubt he would lay back in Haise's sub conscience and do nothing while they execute her. Either way this volume is about the build up until Hinami's execution day arrives."
TokyoGhoul,3dhrjg,Nelfrey,2,Thu Jul 16 17:18:07 2015 UTC,"They send Hide to the CCG in Germany since Kanae pronunced his name as Heisse, and in German it means ""To Be Called"" Sasaki, also Arima said in the last chapter ""I leave the name to you"" and it seems it was ment to Hide, ofc this is a theory where Hide is a Washu and made a deal to get Kaneki power to help the CCG and he ended up going in Germany, ofc Arima was sent to evaluate Kaneki potential as a investigator, he concluded he was powerful and human as well."

TokyoGhoul,3dhrjg,Nelfrey,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:53:55 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty positive they will not sentence Hinami to death. There is a reason that there is a prison of ghouls in which have all lived for many years, for example Amons guardian has been there since Amon was a child, even though he has committed crimes that the CCG know of unlike Hinami. Just like they use Donato for information, they will continue using Hinami for information as she is in Aogiri and has committed no crimes in record."
TokyoGhoul,3dhrjg,KuroiKokujin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:17:24 2015 UTC,Pretty sure Akira wants Hinami's head.  Her execution is inevitable.
TokyoGhoul,3dhrjg,Pyrofrozen,3,Sat Jul 18 17:01:11 2015 UTC,I think his hair being almost black is a sign of something extremely traumatic is going to happen to him. His hair will go completely white instantly when it happens just like it did with Yamori.
TokyoGhoul,3dhrjg,snakeitachi12,3,Thu Jul 16 21:29:24 2015 UTC,I hope it goes yellow or something just because ishida wants to fuck with us.

TokyoGhoul,3dhrjg,geeluc,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:02:59 2015 UTC,"Here's how I would make it go down if I was Ishida, but not really what I think will happen. Alright so we are at the very end of the Tsukiyama Arc, a kakuja Shuu is messing everybody up, then Haise enters the room expecting a fight. Shuu's kakuja falls apart and he lets of a faint smile upon seeing his old friend. Before anything becomes of it though Shuu is killed by Kijima. Haise reacts poorly to this and starts to cry despite not knowing why. This event brings Haise's loyalty to the CCG into question. Kijima through permission of Matsuri Washuu who Is currently trying to take over the CCG takes Haise and tortures him (believing him to be expendable like everyone else). I'm going to say that Kijima was the one to torture Yamori so he will have the same tricks. Given that the torture was probably Kaneki's strongest memory and his catalyst for change last time the same could be said for this time. Eventually Haise is offered the ""choice"" between Hinami, and one of the Q's, probably Saiko, because she's the weakest one. But this time he embraces his ghoul side in time and kills Kijima. Haise and Hinami run away, and try to find Haise's history, while the Q's remain but in increasing danger. This would mirror the original story (maybe a little to closely tbh) allow for a way for Hinami to get out of Cochlea, and put Haise on the run from the CCG. Sorry if I had any logic gaps in there."

He has amnesia and he knows it.Arima and Akira told him some stuff but it's between them and the higher ups and is kept a secret for other. Arima didn't feel guild about him, more likely pity for what happened to him. But he also admire him and like his books tastes (he even praise him while fighting in the last chapters of Tokyo Ghoul). SO this torture think is soo bs but yeah something happened that led kaneki to become a ghoul investigator More likely was: work with us and help us defeat the ghouls and create new soldiers or we will kill you."
TokyoGhoul,3dj3da,Dobor_olita,2,Thu Jul 16 19:29:10 2015 UTC,"And if you are wondering what kaneki knows is that: He was part of an illegal experiment made by kanou that made him in a half ghoul. That's kinda all. They didn't told him who he was , relatives , friends or anything.He heard his name for the first time(i think) while fighting Nishiki but didn't knew how was written (cuz maybe you knew or not the names in japanese mean something , every kanji mean something) and he found 3 ways to write Kaneki Ken. but when in chapter 31.5 in the mask made by uta and sent as a present."
TokyoGhoul,3dj3da,Dobor_olita,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:34:37 2015 UTC,Yeah it was actually from TG when Kaneki was teaching Hinami different kanji I got curious and googled it so funnily enough I only knew from the anime (I watched S1 before I read the manga)
TokyoGhoul,3dj3da,kilpsz,-1,Thu Jul 16 20:02:25 2015 UTC,"It's not amnesia, he shows all the traits of someone with Dissociative Identity Disorder, in which the individual experiences two or more distinct identities or personality states. It's brought on by extreme and repeated trauma, we see Kaneki develop this before when Yamori does it but clearly he's still himself just with a tweaked personality. Haise is a seperate personality though so wouldn't it suggest something worse happens to Kaneki after Arima defeats him?"

TokyoGhoul,3dj3da,Dobor_olita,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:37:04 2015 UTC,The CCG didn't torture Kaneki to change his personality his memory was most likely wiped. That's why Haise is substantially different yet keeping some of Kaneki's natural qualities.
TokyoGhoul,3dj3da,Saliber,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:30:29 2015 UTC,They didn't need to do a thing. Arima did a lot . More precisely 2 holes in kaneki's head. The brain damage was enough to give him amnesia. (I've read somewhere that if you sustain a big trauma your brain tends to forget that event to protect you)
TokyoGhoul,3dj3da,Radinax,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:40:01 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure Kaneki subconsciously suppressed his own personality. In chapter 140, while Kaneki is in his own mind, he is comforted by his old self. His old self suggests that they rest a while before Kaneki's subconsciousness turns to ash, wipes tear.  On a side note, on the third page of chapter 2, we see presumably a recovering Kaneki in CCG's custody wearing and eyepatch and sitting on a mound of books. And on the last page of chapter 143 we see the director ask Arima what he will do about (presumably) Kaneki's new name. He responds, ""I'll leave it to you. "" It is assumed that he is talking to someone else when he says this, possibly Kaneki. If he was allowed to read and choose his own name, I doubt Kaneki was tortured, but that doesn't give Dobor_olita the right to be so rude about his answer. Hope this helped bud! ;D"
TokyoGhoul,3dj3da,TG_Juuzou,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:18:18 2015 UTC,I think Arima was asking Hideyoshi about the name.
TokyoGhoul,3de0ed,geeluc,5,Wed Jul 15 15:11:54 2015 UTC,"this. but with the entire Quinx investegating, remember he was wondering how his squad could help out? they all have a ghouls eye, if they all wear eye patched masks they can go undercover and help out the investegation. thats probably what haise requested from uta, 4 more eyepatched masks for the Quinx"
TokyoGhoul,3de0ed,xgameboyy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:31:08 2015 UTC,I think that wouldn't be okay with the CCG. Plus they would have to wonder how Haise got Kankei's mask?? I think it would be weird if they all had masks.
TokyoGhoul,3de0ed,ImAnAppleBiteMe,7,Wed Jul 15 16:36:59 2015 UTC,"It's gonna be his special investigation. I doubt he will tell anyone in the CCG, similar to how they discovered the hideout by crossdressing. No one knew until after they produced results.  Haise seems to be plunging the Qs deeper into the ghoul world then they originally planned."
TokyoGhoul,3de0ed,oredaore,3,Wed Jul 15 17:35:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel like I could see that happening but idk if all the Q's would be down for that. I guess I dont care either way as long as Haise gets a mask and is using it. I want him to go deeper into the ghoul world so that wouldn't bother me one bit. I dont think this would happen soon but I do want Haise to get a little crazy like white haired Kaneki but still be sane at the same time. Pretty much I want Haise to be the perfect combination of black haired Kaneki and white haired Kaneki. (if that makes any sense)"
TokyoGhoul,3de0ed,oredaore,2,Wed Jul 15 17:44:50 2015 UTC,"On the contrary, I don't think CCG would care that the Qs pretend to be ghouls in order to infiltrate. On the outside CCG seems like they care about ethics and public image, but the reality is they only care abour the end result. Matsuri is a walking example of that.  On the outside HySy is advertised as an art mask shop, not a ghoul mask shop. Uta himself said that he sometimes gets human customers. So even if Haise got masks from HySy he wouldn't get in any trouble at all."
TokyoGhoul,3de0ed,Hjgduyhwsgah_RP,3,Thu Jul 16 09:27:04 2015 UTC,"The last thing he asked Uta in his shop was Spoilers If you combine this with the earlier scene of him thinking about how the Qs team can contribute to the Roze investigation and then him looking at the mask you should be able to put two and two together.  Haise will probably end up using his old mask for massive hype, but I highly doubt he'll go looking for Tsukiyama specifically for various reasons. Haise is not going to be ditching CCG and the Qs team any time soon."
TokyoGhoul,3de0ed,derpasaur9000,2,Thu Jul 16 09:44:51 2015 UTC,"I believe this too. He could be getting masks for the Quinx, yeah, but the first thought I had was that he was getting a mask for himself. ""Eyepatch"" is known to the CCG - he needs a new mask. If he went out wearing his old mask, using his kagune, the CCG would instantly know the culprit."
TokyoGhoul,3de0ed,derpasaur9000,-5,Wed Jul 15 17:06:35 2015 UTC,"First, Haise doesn't who shuu is, he had amnesia  Second, why would Haise order a mask (I doubt he's cosplaying)"
TokyoGhoul,3de0ed,Doxtator007,5,Wed Jul 15 15:17:54 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I'm saying this under the impression that after meeting Shuu he'll remember at least something about him which would be why he wouldn't kill Shuu."

There's a movie that hasn't been released online yet that concludes the story), Death Parade and Another are some relatively short anime that might be good to do this for."
TokyoGhoul,3dgnvk,yourstrulyct,0,Thu Jul 16 03:41:27 2015 UTC,"I got a couple episodes through Psycho-Pass a while ago, but I fell into the same hole I did with Ghost in the Shell.  Both are phenomenal shows/movies/media franchises. I enjoy watching them and they are both equally suspenseful. However, I feel like I don't know enough of the background (ie how all the technology works) and it keeps putting me off. Like, I don't know where to draw the line of disbelief and I'm always wondering ""well, if you could do that before, why are you only just doing it now"" or ""why hasn't anybody else thought that"".  Again, I think they are both great. I probably just need to educate myself better on futuristic crime dramas (blade runner, here I come)"
TokyoGhoul,3dfo7s,Alphadude314,19,Wed Jul 15 22:15:14 2015 UTC,"Even Kaneki did a lot of killing before his ""death"". Remember when he straight up murdered all of those people at the fighting pits. I think him not wanting to kill was more or less just an early on thing that stuck with Amon and changed his perspective. That said I don't think Kaneki ever killed an investigator."
TokyoGhoul,3dfo7s,hyphenated_guy,10,Wed Jul 15 22:37:41 2015 UTC,"Kaneki became a killer shortly after he formed his group with Tsukiyama/Banjou/Hinami. He killed multiple ghouls and cannibalized for around 6 months, I imagine he'd of killed Shinohara if Amon didn't stop him eating through the Arata.   He may have unintentionally killed Hide/Someone underground unless Hide fed him something. He's not killed any humans yet unless they died randomly off screen as part of collateral of his fights and I don't think he would unless he was forced to to save people he loves.   He killed 50 ghouls alone in the ghoul restaurant (It's heavily hinted it was alone + Tsukiyama/Banjou guarded outside), they were also signs of cannibalizing there. I don't think he wants to leave the victims he chose alive, like you said most ghouls would die anyway.   I think he intentionally left Jason suffering like that to suffer, past that people always forget the dark route Kaneki took in choosing to cannibalize for 6 months he as a half ghoul accepts they're a person but rationalizes it by only killing bad ghouls to ease his conscience.   Kaneki was a killer, Haise is also a killer."
TokyoGhoul,3dfo7s,TG_Juuzou,0,Wed Jul 15 23:29:39 2015 UTC,"Imo you villainize Kaneki too much. Part of his resolve after beating Jason was staying true to his original personality, not completely changing but rather combining his new traits with his old ones.  I think if he was gonna eat Shinohara he would've done so right away, since human meat is extremely attractive to ghouls. Yet even in that messed-up Kakuja state, Kaneki was still only eating Arata.  Same for leaving Jason, he could've done a lot more to make him suffer. I got the distinct feeling Kaneki felt like he had gotten all he could from Yamori and just wanted to be free from him after that, without harboring grudges or remaining malice."
TokyoGhoul,3dfo7s,uuu-san,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:37:27 2015 UTC,"Kaneki is obviously the good guy of the series but people forget how broken he is and when Kanou made his offer Kaneki looked like he was about to accept before Yomo made him snap to his senses by saying walk your own path.   Kaneki's when in his kakuja state is essentially insane and Arata still was priority as it was classed as cannibalizing once through I think he'd of eaten Shinohara seeing as he almost killed him it shows he wasn't in control.   He left him in the most agonizing pain possible rather than just ending him after dropping a centipede to rip him apart inside + eating him, this wasn't mercy it was purposefully inflicting torture upon him.  You have to remember shortly after he decides to break half the bones in Ayato's body which wasn't necessary at all to subdue him, Kaneki at this point is a changed man he's ruthless yet still very soft / nice natured which seems illogical but is true.  He shows no mercy to his enemies yet his friends he's still the warm old awkward Kaneki. I'm not trying to villianize him but he does begin to fill an anti-hero with how far he can take things, like killing 50-60 ghouls while trapping them inside trying to catch 1."
TokyoGhoul,3dfo7s,TG_Juuzou,4,Fri Jul 17 11:09:58 2015 UTC,"I think he's only ever killed ghouls, I could be wrong, but I don't ever remember seeing him even harm humans and only damaging investigators."
TokyoGhoul,3dfo7s,dragonscones,4,Wed Jul 15 23:15:17 2015 UTC,"he promised not to kill humans when he still felt like he was human, though after the aogiri arc his look on the world drastically changed, he will kill those who deserve it for example aogiri, id say kaneki would off killed those who were gonna buy human slaves in the auction arc. and thats what haise did, i dont think kaneki would hate himself for it if he has control over his body again and remembers killin ghouls in the auction arc. so no imo haise has not broken kanekis promise"
TokyoGhoul,3dfo7s,xgameboyy,4,Wed Jul 15 23:25:02 2015 UTC,I mean are you forgetting the ghouls Kaneki killed? The ghoul restaurant. He killed something like 50 ghouls and cannibalized them. He cannibalized tons of ghouls. The Kaneki that made that promise to Amon and the Kaneki that emerges maybe be similar in a lot of ways but he is also very different. That is when he knows what he is. He's a ghoul. He may not be evil but he is a killer.
TokyoGhoul,3dfo7s,DrRad,2,Wed Jul 15 23:49:07 2015 UTC,"I know right, the part where he RIPs everyone in the restaurant just because they were in the way of his fight. And we also see him kill a few ghouls during the auction XD"
TokyoGhoul,3dfo7s,Saliber,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:41:30 2015 UTC,kaneki killed ghouls who he thought were bad and never killed humans although he did try to kill investigators towards the end of tokyo ghoul
TokyoGhoul,3dfo7s,mariololftw,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:57:17 2015 UTC,"Which investigators did he try to kill? As far as I remember he never actually tried to kill any investigators other than when he was in his insane Kakuja state. He disarmed and knocked them unconscious, but he never tried to kill them as far as I remember. I could be mistaken though, since I haven't read some parts of the Anteiku Raid arc recently, I'll have to refresh my memory."
TokyoGhoul,3dfo7s,TheMikarin,2,Thu Jul 16 02:30:12 2015 UTC,I count his insane kakuja state lol   just held himself back from killing shinohara   almost killed amon  and really tried to kill arima but he was destroyed
TokyoGhoul,3dfo7s,mariololftw,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:33:29 2015 UTC,"Ah okay, I assumed you were referring only to what he did in his moments of sanity, so was thinking of the other investigators he fought."

TokyoGhoul,3dfo7s,Happyhungryghoul,2,Thu Jul 16 02:37:07 2015 UTC,"He wasn't using his Kakuja, but he was still in a state of insanity for part of the fight. I sort of assumed in his brief moments of clarity that he wasn't trying to kill Arima so much as going all out in a desperate attempt to survive, so wasn't sure whether it would really count since he didn't have any choice there."
TokyoGhoul,3dfo7s,TheMikarin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:47:36 2015 UTC,"Haise actually has the Gold Osmanthus award, for killing/subduing 100 ghouls in a year, possibly during ""mole-whacking"" missions underground when he was being trained by Arima. Consider that some of the ghouls may have simply been in hiding and not even hostile, but he probably killed them anyway on orders. Though it doesn't really matter since he's already broken his ""promise"" as Kaneki.   Kaneki's insistence on not killing was his principle from before he was tortured and his mindset became darker, because in not killing he could still cling to his humanity(although this thinking is flawed to begin with since he assumes that ghouls are inherently evil while humans are inherently good). He still tries to follow his principle except after Aogiri he now excludes ""bad ghouls"" from his policy. Even though he took the high road with Yamori it was ok to kill the patrons at the ghoul restaurant so basically it was up to his whim. Kaneki's mindset was flawed to begin with this and further emphasized his fall into the depths."

Really only 2 scenario's exist Kaneki fed on Hide possibly even killing him in the process, Hide fed Kaneki.   Say Kaneki fed on Hide seeing as he thought he was an illusion he could of easily killed/seriously injured Hide. Now he either couldn't comprehend what he'd done as he was in his kakuja form or he did regain control realized what he did and completely broke down not being able to handle it put up a mental barrier.   Kaneki trying to deal with regaining his memories then that image of Hide laying there lifeless (dead or not) would seriously break him and for some reason I want that to see how he deals with it."

TokyoGhoul,3dcvtn,staticccc,6,Wed Jul 15 13:42:44 2015 UTC,Yes you should definitely start the manga from the beginning. The first season skipped a ton of scenes and details and the 2nd season is basically just a 'what if' scenario. I thought the anime was pretty good too until I read the manga and realized just how much content they skipped and how much of a difference it makes.
TokyoGhoul,3dcvtn,Jalidric,2,Wed Jul 15 08:01:08 2015 UTC,So basically the manga and the anime follow the same storyline but the anime excludes alot of content?
TokyoGhoul,3dcvtn,Alluka-,6,Wed Jul 15 09:07:40 2015 UTC,"Season one condenses about 70 chapters of content full of dialogue and character interactions into 12 20 minute episodes.   The second season cuts up the remaining 70 chapters of content full of dialogue and character interactions and replaces it with stuff that doesn't even happen. This results in things being completely different than what they should be.  So yes, the manga is VERY different and VERY worth reading if you want the full Tokyo Ghoul experience."
TokyoGhoul,3dcvtn,Jalidric,4,Wed Jul 15 13:47:27 2015 UTC,Yep. Trust me you wont regret reading it.
TokyoGhoul,3dcvtn,gladephant,3,Wed Jul 15 09:11:40 2015 UTC,"I read the manga before the anime, and I found the anime a little disappointing.  The manga follows a completely different storyline, and in my opinion was a lot better than the anime adaptation itself. More characters are introduced, and their backgrounds are also explained in more depth. Also, there are more ass kickings. Sorry 'bout dem bones."
TokyoGhoul,3dcvtn,TheMikarin,2,Wed Jul 15 12:36:56 2015 UTC,"Copying and pasting this comment of mine from another thread.  The anime was a what-if version of the story, you need to the read the manga to follow the actual story. Even if you don't normally like reading manga, give it a shot. It's worth it, and far better than the anime version. READ FROM CHAPTER 1. The anime omitted a lot of important information and scenes throughout, so you need to read from the beginning to avoid missing anything and to properly understand the story. It's worth reading from the beginning though, many of us have read it more than once since it's packed with so much foreshadowing and symbolism that's easy to miss the first time around.  Basically here's the reading order:  Tokyo Ghoul (chapters 1 to 143): http://bato.to/read/_/67864/tokyo-ghoul_v1_ch1_by_lazy-ass-scans  Tokyo Ghoul:JACK (since you've watched the anime, you can also read this first if you want to view everything chronologically): http://bato.to/read/_/269972/tokyo-ghoul-jack_v1_ch1_by_kawa-scans  Tokyo Ghoul:JOKER: http://bato.to/read/_/257690/tokyo-ghoul_by_twisted-hel-scans  Tokyo Ghoul:re (absolutely essential to read after the first manga, no matter what you think of the first manga's ending): http://imperialscans.com/read/tokyo-ghoul-re/1-bone/1  JACK and JOKER are optional, and can be read even after you catch up to :re. Despite JOKER taking place in between the first manga and :re, it was actually released around halfway through the first manga. Most people assumed it was non-canon, but it turns out it actually takes place after the first manga. Since it does contain minor spoilers, read it only after finishing the first manga. JACK actually has a different style from the regular manga.  Another bit of content you can read for fun is the Tokyo Ghoul  ONESHOT. It's essentially the prototype for Tokyo Ghoul, the early version the author drew before doing the actual series we know. It's completely non-canon, but interesting to see. You can read it whenever you want: http://bato.to/read/_/278968/tokyo-ghoul-oneshot_by_kawa-scans  DO NOT TRY TO READ :RE WITHOUT READING THE FIRST MANGA. The anime was a what-if version of events, so you'll be missing a huge portion of the story and will misunderstand several things if you rely on the anime. The manga's version of the story is much better than the anime's. Don't skip even early manga chapters either, since a lot of what the anime cut out is important throughout the series."

Joker is a chapter about suzuya that takes place inbetween the end of tokyo ghoul and the beginning of tokyo ghoul:re.  ahem. :RE IS THE DIRECT STILL ONGOING CONTINUATION TO THE ORIGINAL MANGA IT JUST HAS A DIFFERENT NAME OK ITS LITERALLY THE STORY CONTINUEING FOLLOWING ALL THE MAIN CHARACTERS WITH JUST A 2 YEAR TIMESKIP THATS IT WOOOOO

TokyoGhoul,3dbeuz,jacksonrslick,12,Tue Jul 14 23:35:03 2015 UTC,I think that Arima is gonna get crucified one of these chapters
TokyoGhoul,3dbeuz,DontWorryYuri,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:50:16 2015 UTC,"D.. Don't say that, Haise would be sad and you wouldn't like him when he's sad."
TokyoGhoul,3dbeuz,Syborg49,2,Thu Jul 16 08:26:44 2015 UTC,"Arima is OP although I'm sure he'll die sometime during RE perhaps his next meeting with Eto with an extra 3 years cannibalizing under her belt.   I personally like/liked these CCG members more though Shinohara/Juuzou/Haise/Amon/Q's(Except Urie, fuck you Urie)/Amon/Hanbee.    Arima is just too badass, usually I like overly badass characters but he's just way too OP / hasn't got the personality."
TokyoGhoul,3dbeuz,TG_Juuzou,2,Wed Jul 15 02:08:12 2015 UTC,Eto's kakuja has been completely developed so it wouldn't make a difference
TokyoGhoul,3dbeuz,LegendOfCookie,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:00:59 2015 UTC,"It's been discussed a few time and her kakuja has clearly grown in size from when she was younger, in the timeskip we can only assume it's grown more due to the amount of RC cells she'd of absorbed she must be at a shocking amount of them now."
TokyoGhoul,3dbeuz,TG_Juuzou,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:49:58 2015 UTC,I mean I think the way Arima treats Haise/Kaneki is enough personality (atleast for me)  Btw ur like LITERALLY in every single thread I read holy shit dude
TokyoGhoul,3dbeuz,mak1rby,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:16:15 2015 UTC,Hey I like tokyo ghoul discussions :)   It seems odd he does act like that with Kaneki although even when younger seems pretty cold in general with people.
TokyoGhoul,3dbeuz,TG_Juuzou,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:55:02 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I doubt that Arima is going to die. Maybe at the very end of the manga, but it would probably be Kaneki / Haise who kills him. Eto killing him wouldn't really be all that interesting."
TokyoGhoul,3dbeuz,Jorisdaporis,0,Wed Jul 15 09:22:19 2015 UTC,"Just things like him wanting to train people to his level possibly as replacements, we've been told by Ishida he has weak genes + it'd be pretty interesting as it'd confirm she'd become basically unstoppable + it'd be an awesome chapter long fight.   Kaneki will never kill Arima after spending time as Haise."
TokyoGhoul,3dbeuz,TG_Juuzou,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:56:26 2015 UTC,I think Haise will be the one to kill him IMO. Seems fitting.

TokyoGhoul,3dbuvj,Psychoshy1101,2,Wed Jul 15 01:39:57 2015 UTC,"I don't remember the details about Aogiri set up a shopping mall as their base for 'two months' and stuff. But I think since the 11th ward was in a pretty bad shape, their first priority was to defend their base first before sending people to investigate the Aogiri base and prepare for an offensive, right?   For the second point, remember that a ghoul only requires to consume a body for every one or two months to survive. And Aogiri openly attacked and took over the 11th ward headquarter, so I assume all the CCG investigators stationed there at the time would be enough to feed them for a while."
TokyoGhoul,3dbuvj,shinny099,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:53:31 2015 UTC,"They did know they were there, not sure when they found out but they knew for a while prior to the operation. I actually was wondering the same how do Aogiri sustain themselves with so many members without killing stupid amounts of other ghouls, I'm guessing some of them cannibalize ghouls who don't join/aren't strong enough. It's never really mentioned but they obviously kill humans/ghouls for food however you'd think they'd mention the huge death toll but they don't.   Season 2 of the anime is an alternate route with Kaneki joining Aogiri. In this route Kaneki never forms a group with Tsukiyama/Hinami/Banjou and certain events like Kanou's lab for example don't happen. Season 2 is basically completely different to the manga but it was meant to be as it's an alternate route."

TokyoGhoul,3dbfv9,hyphenated_guy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:41:18 2015 UTC,"It's probably possible to have a quinque steel tattoo needle. The last chapter of the auction arc revealed that there were two missions happening November 11th, the auction raid and a simultaneous mission to protect transportation trucks carrying quinque steel that Aogiri was after.  But it's probably way easier to just inject RC suppressants."
TokyoGhoul,3dbfv9,dippindots326,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:17:19 2015 UTC,"I have a side question to this, shouldn't the Ghoul healing abilities ""fix"" his body by removing the ink? I'm a little fuzzy how it all works in that regard, as well as extreme healing in other fiction for that matter. Like if a Ghoul was hit with a quinque bullet, and it left shrapnel inside the body, would the healing expel the foreign object first or simply heal around it leaving it inside?"

TokyoGhoul,3d7fe4,uncountableB,3,Tue Jul 14 04:30:55 2015 UTC,"I've never gotten the feeling that Arima had a problem with Hirako, and just by how he calls him by his given name shows he's actually quite close to him.  Though for Hirako's end, Ishida did build up the whole ""Arima envy"" problem thing a bit and together with Uta's insinuating it's easy for people to think that Hirako has a problem with Arima. People also assumed that because he's always skipped for promotion that Hirako is actually resentful of that, and that this somehow goes back to always being regulated to the shadows by Arima. But with the recent chapter we know that the promotion thing is probably false. I don't agree that he's bummed about being transferred out of his own squad though since it was mentioned that a few other squads were trying to scout him, Kuramoto seems more bummed about that.  Hirako though does probably have a problem with Haise, especially if he knows the truth about Centipede."
TokyoGhoul,3d7fe4,oredaore,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:20:47 2015 UTC,"I think Hirako feels that Haise could potentially be a liability to the CCG, and judging by their relationship, a liability to Arima as well."
TokyoGhoul,3d7fe4,Exiliahh,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:35:08 2015 UTC,"Haise definitely does have the potential to be a big liability to the CCG, that's why there's protocol that exists to deal with him if the time ever arises, and I don't mean by calming him down when his kagune runs rampant. A lot of investigators don't trust Haise for the very fact that he is half ghoul, and should he ever turn on CCG he would need to be dealt with swiftly and thoroughly.   Hirako also seems to pin the failure of the Anteiku raid on Centipede. If he knows the truth about Haise and Centipede then Hirako definitely holds it against Haise for having been on the side of Anteiku(which the CCG believes to be affiliated with Aogiri) before he had amnesia, no matter what he's become now under Arima's mentoring."

TokyoGhoul,3d7fe4,Happyhungryghoul,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:43:34 2015 UTC,"Very interesting opinion but I still think Hirako dislikes Arima or if it is not dislike, he thinks negatively of him in a way. Like, he still repects Arima and all and might actually considers him a friend because go way back but he still suffers from Arimaphaty.  Basically, for Hirako's end, he has a very complicated and complex relationship with Arima where you just can't say it's clear cut friendship or clear cut hatred. Imo, it's a combination of both."
TokyoGhoul,3d7fe4,oredaore,3,Tue Jul 14 09:21:06 2015 UTC,"I feel like Hirako, who is probably the person who knows Arima best, may be immune to ""Arimapathy"". Everyone who does have ""Arimapathy"" may have seen Arima's genius in action once or twice and without trying to understand him end up feeling like life is too unfair that this one guy is so gifted. Hirako however was partnered with him for 6 years and was personally trained by Arima so Arima's feats are a normal occurrence and his excellence is something he expects (which is why he was so bothered when Owl ended up escaping). He's also seen both the human and inhuman sides to Arima unlike everyone else who bitterly thinks of him like an untouchable god. Rather than arrogantly feeling indignant about Arima's genius (like Atou the ""pineapple"" associate special class for example) he opted to learn from Arima instead (which was brought up in the tumblr post)."
TokyoGhoul,3d7fe4,TG_Juuzou,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:32:33 2015 UTC,"As everyone has noticed Hirako has distanced himself from Haise and it's because he knows how dangerous he could be, this is likely the only reason he dodges events with him at. CCG drills the mentality into the investigators all ghouls are evil and he's probably struggling to comprehend they're prepared to give him rank knowing he's a true half ghoul.   I think Hirako attacked Uta out of pure rage that'd he'd mock Arima by cosplaying him, we'll likely see some bro moments now he's back with Arima to put an end to the Hirako theories."

As was shown early in the torso investigation when some people were getting pissed that he was bringing back to many ghouls alive."
TokyoGhoul,3d9tii,hyphenated_guy,6,Wed Jul 15 20:24:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's the case. He's a ghoul investigator, and in his past life he readily killed other ghouls. If he was truly against quinques, he wouldn't even use one. What's the difference in a quinque made from a ghoul killed by someone else and a ghoul killed by you?"
TokyoGhoul,3d9tii,Hjgduyhwsgah_RP,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:05:39 2015 UTC,"But he can not remember his past life, so I think it's a plausible assumption"
TokyoGhoul,3d9tii,Vermillion-ghoul,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:52:33 2015 UTC,"True, but he's got a Golden Osmanthus medal, which is awarded to investigators who have eliminated 100+ ghouls in a year. Which means he's actually killed more ghouls than most investigators have."
TokyoGhoul,3d9tii,Hjgduyhwsgah_RP,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:02:17 2015 UTC,"I think it's safe to say he doesn't care what they're made of seeing as he's killed ghouls himself, I think killing them is worse than wielding a quinque made of one. Remember the scene he speaks to Shirazu after he gets upset after seeing his?   If we see him take down a big ghoul as Haise I imagine he'll get them as quinque."
TokyoGhoul,3d9tii,TG_Juuzou,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:26:50 2015 UTC,"Usually you only get a special quinque made from a ghoul you personally take down. I guess either the ghouls he's killed aren't good enough to be made into a special quinque or he's never taken down a higher rated ghoul himself and only assisted (this still gives you merit in a mission).  And you have to realize, Haise thinks from a human and CCG investigator's perspective, he may treat ghouls more humanely than most other investigators but he's not a ghoul sympathizer.  Wouldn't it be shocking and sad if in the future he goes against Tsukiyama, kills him and then makes him into his sword literally?"
TokyoGhoul,3d9tii,oredaore,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:24:10 2015 UTC,"Or imagine if Arima meant it when he said he needed a new quinque, and a bit of Kaneki's kakuhou was taken to make a quinque? Imagine Sasaki using his own kagune as a quinque."
TokyoGhoul,3d9tii,Hjgduyhwsgah_RP,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:36:44 2015 UTC,"It's entirely possible. Arima's line about needing a new quinque, and then showing a black case at the end seems like a big red herring now that we know what happened to Kaneki, but has Ishida ever put red herrings like that in TG? They could have probably farmed him while he was out, we still don't really know the reason why he woke up with amnesia and it could be related to being put under the same conditions as Rize."
TokyoGhoul,3d9tii,oredaore,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:45:56 2015 UTC,What if Haise has a secret Quinque that's like just a big centipede or something idk that would make me quit TG tbh

TokyoGhoul,3dbeof,MIGFirestorm,5,Tue Jul 14 23:33:40 2015 UTC,Read the manga from the beginning. That's all.
TokyoGhoul,3dbeof,Chazyyyy,5,Wed Jul 15 00:21:57 2015 UTC,"First of all did you read from the first chapter of the original manga, or did you try to read from :re directly after watching the anime? If you didn't read the first manga, go back and read from the beginning, there's a massive amount of content that was omitted and changed in the anime, so you're missing a lot of the story. The second season was almost entirely different from the manga, while the first season also left out some important content.  After that, get up to date with :re if you aren't already. It's pretty clear what will happen eventually. I can explain certain things for you if you've already done all of this."
TokyoGhoul,3dbeof,TheMikarin,-2,Wed Jul 15 01:28:05 2015 UTC,I'm pretty up to date with the newest manga and i might go read the older ones i'm just asking for clarification on whether or not Kaneki will reunite with those at Anteiku or if that part of his life is over.
TokyoGhoul,3dbeof,konart,3,Wed Jul 15 07:27:32 2015 UTC,"asking for clarification    Nobody can give you this, besides the author himself."
TokyoGhoul,3dbeof,TheMikarin,2,Wed Jul 15 08:26:44 2015 UTC,"It's pretty clear he will reunite with them at some point, though we don't know the circumstances yet.  Also you NEED to read the older ones, you've missed some major plot points by skipping straight to :re. Once they start addressing them again you'll be lost. There's already some of them that have been brought up in :re, though you probably missed or misunderstood them entirely since you didn't see the earlier chapters. That and the manga version of the earlier events was much better than the anime's.  The manga is fantastic, and needs to be read from the beginning to fully appreciate it. The anime is a what-if version of events, so it should not be relied on when following the story. You aren't going to appreciate the manga's story going forward if you've missed a good portion of it."
TokyoGhoul,3dbeof,Alluka-,3,Wed Jul 15 12:41:46 2015 UTC,You're completely lost because you have no clue how the story went. Read the manga from chapter 1. :re is the sequel/continuation.

TokyoGhoul,3d32ns,Kaneki_99,3,Tue Jul 14 08:06:16 2015 UTC,"My thoughts on TG as a Harem  -Touka is waifu ofc  -Rize is super fucked up, not really fap material, but I guess she works for the Harem  -Hinami is basically his younger sister - and that's on an emotional level. If it was purely genetic, sure it could spawn an SAO style love triangle, but when emotionally they have a strong brother-sister relationship, there's not really room for pseudo-incest. Ayato x Hinami might work though.  -Not enough interaction between Haiseki and Eto for her to be a solid member of his harem  -Akira  x Amon OTP, I can't imagine her as part of the harem  -Haise has a mother-daughter relationship with Saiko, so she wouldn't work as part of the harem for the same reason Hinami doesn't work  -I've been rooting for Tsukiyama x Kaneki since the beginning, so I'm going to assume that was durhurr's seventh contender, and I fully support it.  So the way I see it, there's only a few contenders for slots in Kaneki's harem - Touka (#1 Waifu), Eto (depending on her future contact with Haiseki), Akira (a possibility, though I'm still rooting for Akira x Amon), and Tsukiyama (El Dorado)"

TokyoGhoul,3d5tvj,xgameboyy,5,Mon Jul 13 20:04:18 2015 UTC,Now that you mentioned :re : the way Noro's head reattached after Yomo kicked it reminds me of the way Takizawa's hand reattached itself after Hinami chopped it off.

TokyoGhoul,3d5tvj,Dannyr1,3,Mon Jul 13 19:57:20 2015 UTC,"Well, although he didn't look serious, neither Yomo OR Uta used their Kagune against him either so you can't necessarily say he CAN take on 3 people it's just that no one there was going 100%."

TokyoGhoul,3d5tvj,ThreeEyedFool,2,Tue Jul 14 00:13:32 2015 UTC,i think noro has no mouth and may be the reason he eats the way he does and doesn't talk
TokyoGhoul,3d5tvj,staticccc,5,Tue Jul 14 11:50:45 2015 UTC,"There's no way that's his kagune which he eats with, you see frames in which he eats a human whole and it's either a kakuja/he's just a detachable kagune OR highly unlikely but he's dual RC type the second one being an unknown type the CCG have never seen which takes form around the head.   If Noro is in fact an actual person I'll agree and say his a kakuja it's pretty obvious however I'm still not sold on the fact he's not just a detached kagune/kakuja.   There's been a lot of evidence hinting he's just a detachable kagune/kakuja and essentially seems mindless until given commands. When he has his head kicked off and it re-joins they says something like it's un natural even for a ghoul.   It's mentioned plenty of times he eats abnormal amounts, I imagine this is so the kagune/kakuja can stay separate constantly. Eto/One Eye King/Possibly an unknown character is controlling their portable kagune/kakuja aka noro.    It's entirely possible his normal kagune is just that and his kakuja is the mouth thing but I don't buy it too many subtle hints about it."

Its been shown during events like the anteiku raid and the 4th ward attack that arima thinks about his movements and his opponents movements, then uses speed to execute his decisions. Thus hirako is a person who understands arimas thought pattern, as shown when shinohara and kuroiwa tried to mirror arimas strength while hirako was amongst the 11th war aogiri raid not as excellent but expendable but rather as someone who could make judgements like arima.  Tldr hirako understands arima thats what keep up means"
TokyoGhoul,3d3uft,cellcommander2,5,Mon Jul 13 09:04:53 2015 UTC,"I'd probably say that his actual attack/offensive skills are limited, but he's gained enough actual experience to avoid serious damage from most attacks and uses his kagune in a very different manner when fighting (Eg; making the mask of Arima's face).  If I had to guess, I'd suggest that he is probably around the same level as Matasaka ""Shachi"" Kamishiro though his fighting seems to be based more around dodging whereas Shaci's uses brute force and aggression (from what I've read/seen).

And since he's only a fragile human, even non-life-threatening injuries will bring him down quite easily.  That said Uta could probably be among of the strongest ghouls we will see in TG if his regeneration and mysteriousness is anything to go by, I'd say SS-rate sounds about right. Except he never fights seriously and doesn't seem as if he ever intends to so I don't think it really matters. It's not his style to use his strength to accomplish his goals whatever they may be."
TokyoGhoul,3d3uft,Happyhungryghoul,3,Mon Jul 13 12:49:32 2015 UTC,"Nah I think Hirako is solid. He's no Arima nor some kind of prodigy but he's hella strong in a non flashy kind of way. He does produce great results you know.   He's a recipient of the Silver Osmanthus Award   Silver Osmanthus Award: The second level, given for eliminating 50 Ghouls in a year.   Also a recepient of the Double White Wing Award(Same with Juuzou)   Double White Wing Award - Awarded for defeating an SS-rated Ghoul.   He's quite decorated for someone who's supposed to be the epitome of plain and ordinary."
TokyoGhoul,3d3uft,oredaore,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:31:13 2015 UTC,"Well yes compared to your average investigator Hirako is pretty impressive and he's the kind of guy you can count on to be reliable, but I still wouldn't say he's hella strong. His strong point is that he's good at analyzing the flow of the battle and acting accordingly and it probably helps a lot that he's so plain that foes would underestimate him."
TokyoGhoul,3d3uft,evilbride,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:09:33 2015 UTC,even if uta doesn't seem to excel the most in close combat but guy has a lot of tricks up his sleeves that will surely advantage him during fights so yeah SSS-rate is very possible for his level
TokyoGhoul,3d3uft,staticccc,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:40:35 2015 UTC,has Uta used his kagune yet?
TokyoGhoul,3d3uft,ThreeEyedFool,0,Tue Jul 14 11:41:35 2015 UTC,"Well we need to remember that Kaneki also destroyed Hirako in one shot. Kaneki was only a SS ranked then, so if Arima destroyed Kaneki while not even being scratched which he in fact did then it's blatant Hirako is not on the same level as Arima, meaning of course it was easy for Uta to take him down. But then again it's been three years but I still don't believe ( Especially considering its Hirako) that he's up to Arimas level. But if I were to guess where Uta is on a scale maybe on the border of SSS as he's the same level as Yomo and Yomo was wrecked by Arima."
TokyoGhoul,3d3uft,BlackProdigy,2,Mon Jul 13 14:04:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's nor fair to say He destroyed Hirako. It was pretty even, Hirako deflected some of Kaneki's attacks but commented how his Quinque couldn't stand up to Kaneki's Kagune. Which is when Ken destroyed Hirako's weapon. Furthermore, comparing Arima and Hirako's fighting ability isn't really fair. Arima is a prodigy and has probably the most power Quinque we have seen in the manga, while Hirako is only seen using normal quinque with the exception of the one he used to fend off Eto. But he had to pick that up."

TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,PakiIronman,95,Sun Jul 12 15:10:12 2015 UTC,"Many, many things happened this chapter.  -Hirako and Arima are going to have some sort of conflict. It's going to be a shitshow, eventually.  -Uta is making masks for all of the quinx, which means Mutsuki would have to come there in person, and if he recognizes Uta...(to be fair, he might be in denial, because he saw that ghoul stabbed in the face multiple times by Suzuya, and he doesn't know about insane ghoul regeneration yet).  -Kijima is giving me the vibe that he was the same guy that tortured Yamori and the same guy that framed Juuzou for all of the cat killings, giving his penchant for torture and his past appointment at Cochlea. It could be a red herring, like with the whole Torso/Tsukiyama thing, but who knows.  -Kanae and Hori are going to make a deal over Tsukiyama. What a surprise.  -Yoriko was basically introduced in the same way Touka was. And she knows Bujin. Oh my Gawd.  P.S. I don't know why, but the picture of Urie bench pressing made me LOL a lot. It just seemed out of place this chapter, but that's just me though."
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,uncountableB,53,Sun Jul 12 15:20:42 2015 UTC,"Urie bench pressing isn't that out of place though, I actually thought it was a nice touch. He was jealous of all the praise Kuroiwa got for killing a ghoul with his bare hands, so he's looking for ways to make himself stronger physically so he can do the same thing too, that is so in character for him."
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,littlegreenbot,11,Sun Jul 12 17:25:50 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, it's definitely in character. I was just poking fun at Urie, is all. It still seemed funny to me, for some indiscernible reason."
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,uncountableB,31,Sun Jul 12 17:43:54 2015 UTC,I think the same about Kijima which makes his relationship with Haise even more interesting.  Though if you tortured the shit out of a ghoul and it stabbed and ruined your face it seems pretty stupid to continue torturing ghouls to me.  You would think he would have learned his lesson...
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,enfermedad,2,Sun Jul 12 15:26:14 2015 UTC,"Rather than him learning his lesson, I think he would take his revenge on some poor ghouls instead...."
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,shinny099,19,Mon Jul 13 01:36:46 2015 UTC,-Yoriko was basically introduced in the same way Touka was. And she knows Bujin. Oh my Gawd. whos is Bujin ? sorry im so bad with names
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,bleh10,37,Sun Jul 12 15:28:14 2015 UTC,"Yoriko was Touka's human friend from the original series. Bujin is the nickname of Takeomi Kuroiwa, the guy who snapped the ghoul's neck in the auction."

TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,Scholars_Mate,9,Mon Jul 13 00:40:50 2015 UTC,"Tooru was framed for the cat killings, too.  For now, I'm doubting that Kijima is Yamori's torturer. While Yamori's torturer was scarred in Juuzou's memories, he wasn't scarred as badly as Kijima is now and he didn't have a peg leg. And we haven't seen Kijima do the finger crack until now. But they might be related in some way."
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,old-mcdonald,6,Sun Jul 12 17:39:09 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I might be jumping the gun. I guess we'll have to wait and see.  Oh yeah! Tooru did have the same problem Suzuya had back in the academy. That's super interesting, actually."
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,uncountableB,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:47:18 2015 UTC,"Could be that Ishida changed the design of the torturer since he was first introduced. It's rare that he would do something like that but it's not impossible, especially considering that the original guys design didn't look very fleshed out."
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,hyphenated_guy,8,Mon Jul 13 18:28:31 2015 UTC,Why would Mutsuki recognize Uta? If I recall he never saw Uta's face right?
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,markypoo4L,15,Sun Jul 12 15:35:13 2015 UTC,"True. But, the hairstyle and build are pretty much the same, not to mention he heard him talk to her. The voice might spark something."
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,uncountableB,8,Sun Jul 12 15:39:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah guess you're right, if anything I think Mutsuki would get a familiar or suspicious feeling about him"
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,markypoo4L,5,Sun Jul 12 15:41:17 2015 UTC,"At the very least. This is assuming Haise brings the quinx person, but he'd have to, right? It doesn't make sense to get personalized masks if the persons in question didn't like them."
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,uncountableB,3,Sun Jul 12 16:34:22 2015 UTC,he said custom. I think haise might design them.

TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,uncountableB,5,Mon Jul 13 05:02:04 2015 UTC,Didn't the same guy who tortured Yamori get killed after?
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,Doxtator007,27,Sun Jul 12 15:47:38 2015 UTC,No he ended up becoming a instructor at the academy where Suzuya and the twins were. In chapter 122 we see the bottom half of his face where he is badly scarred. And it is revealed that he still enjoys torturing things as he repeatedly tortures the animals located there.  Edit: Oops put chapter 112 instead of 122
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,Syzygi,10,Sun Jul 12 16:05:35 2015 UTC,That's cool!  I had no idea he was still alive. Thanks for that dude!

TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,ohaiguys,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:11:42 2015 UTC,"Nope, that guy who fought Black Dog was Associate Special Class Hachikawa Chu. In addition, Yamori's torturer had scars located all over his face while Hachikawa had scars only around his mouth plus their jawlines are different."
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,Syzygi,4,Thu Jul 16 20:26:10 2015 UTC,Kijima is giving me the vibe that he was the same guy that tortured Yamori and the same guy that framed Juuzou for all of the cat killings   Didn't they already show that guy? He looked nothing like Kijima
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,Boylanator_94,11,Sun Jul 12 17:24:49 2015 UTC,"http://twistedhelscans.com/read/tokyo_ghoul/en/13/122/page/16  http://imperialscans.com/read/tokyo-ghoul-re/33-embracing-books/19  I guess its a bit of a stretch. The thing is, the first picture is shadowed out a lot, but he has a lot of facial scaring. Also, he's a little chubby, so he could have packed on some weight. That, and if his nose and mouth were cut off, would make it somewhat compelling. But I don't fault you for reserving judgment. I guess we'll have to wait and see."

TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,MrTalha,52,Sun Jul 12 15:26:19 2015 UTC,"I see it going one of two ways  A. After getting that confirmed he tries on the mask to find it fits perfectly, thus confirming it was custom made.. For him.  B. He gets a new mask made for himself, so he can do things under the guise of a ghoul, while also escaping the influence of the CCG. (How funny would it be if he made a reputation for himself, and his squad was put in charge of investigating him)"
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,fightn,15,Sun Jul 12 17:57:46 2015 UTC,B. Is some Death Note type of shit.  I'm down.
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,BitchImaKillYou,3,Sun Jul 12 21:12:08 2015 UTC,Looks like Sasaki has it all according to keikaku.  translator note: keikaku means plan
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,TKG8,25,Tue Jul 14 18:34:44 2015 UTC,"I immediately thought of B. Never thought he's want to make masks for the Qs, because that doesn't seem to make much sense to me... they don't need masks at all. However, Haise could be wanting to do some more investigations that only a ghoul could... I think the most likely though is A."
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,ShitsNGigglesdTB,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:34:44 2015 UTC,Interesting.... I could see that happening.
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,sojiki,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:56:56 2015 UTC,"I say why not both? He asked about custom made because he does intend of having a mask made for himself but it's only when he tries on Kaneki's mask out of perhaps curiously that he realises it must have been custom made for him.   I really hope option B happens, it fits in with Haise pondering over how they could break through in this investigation and seeing it play out would be amazing."
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,bhvgcf,4,Sun Jul 12 21:55:08 2015 UTC,"Haise was wondering what special attribute the Quinx had that could be used for the investigation. Looking at the mask seems to have given him the idea to get masks made for them, possibly so that they can gather information while pretending to be ghouls. He may also do either A or B, or even both."
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,TheMikarin,5,Sun Jul 12 19:35:19 2015 UTC,I have a feeling that option #2 is more likely to happen. I'm getting crisis core vibes from Haise.
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,crowsloft666,4,Sun Jul 12 20:18:42 2015 UTC,It would be pretty epic if haise started running around as a ghoul again :0

TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,csmslt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:29:13 2015 UTC,"Hell yeah, Haise will get a custom made mask and knowing Uta he'll be troll and make him another one eyed mask with the mouth thing (maybe), then Haise will be doing undercover ghoul shit and maybe even release his inner Ken to fuck shit up and maybe even rediscover himself.

This seems like it will end up being pretty important soon, given her connection with the Q's so far. They know she's a reliable source of information to them.   -I refuse to believe haise is so stupid. Oh my God. Come on Haise. Eye tattoo's, really? He cannot be this naive. Inner Kaneki recognized the mask, he's got to know deep down it's probably his old one. Honestly I think maybe he might just be feeling Uta out? What kind of person/ghoul he is. Of course we all know what kind of ghoul Uta is.   -Maybe Uta will make masks for the Q's, that's what I'm hoping happens anyway. Wouldn't Mutsuki remember him? Unless he changed his voice at the auction, but his hair is pretty distinct regardless.  -BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY Uta said he could keep the mask. Haise is keeping the mask. If Sasaki is thinking of having the Q's wear masks for some kind of undercover operation for the Rose investigation, that means Haise might be wearing the mask soon.

TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,-AlexGrey-,4,Sun Jul 12 16:48:29 2015 UTC,"I think Hirako resents Arima for a variety of reasons. Mostly because Arima is kind of an asshole to him, and he has a really strong sense of morality from what we've seen, so he probably doesn't like what Arima did to Kaneki.. while also resenting him since Arima favors Haise so much.   I'll just be breaking out the popcorn when all of this comes to a boiling point."

TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,-AlexGrey-,7,Sun Jul 12 16:26:57 2015 UTC,"I think we're all jumping the gun here. There are two immediate questions: one, did Yoriko know that Touka was a ghoul in TG? And two, if not, did Yoriko piece it together after the end of TG, since Touka abruptly left after the raid which was publicized to everyone in the 20th ward?    If either of those are confirmed, then we can start talking about whether or not there is an ulterior motive for Yoriko being friends with  and investigator, and if she knows whether or not Touka is alive."
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,konart,3,Sun Jul 12 16:45:47 2015 UTC,"It's just a speculation, don't take me so seriously. But is higly probable Yoriko knows about her being a ghoul, and she (Yoriko) knew Touka's dream about running a coffee place."

It's obvious that they are keeping a pretense of normality but they are having a go at behind the words and gaining info from each other.  -There is big possibility of the Quinx posing as a Ghoul Organization and infiltrating the Ghoul World with those masks to get closer to Rose. Also HAISE WEARING THE MASK HYPE  -Seems like we'll know the cause of the bad blood between Take and Arima soon enough.  -Ihei also has the Arima moves! Seems like we have contender for best girl here.  -Getting Yamori vibes from Kijima, especially that last panel smile.  -Yoriko! She seems way cuter now and she has dem buns.  -Urie is ripped, look at those arms.  This is a pretty well made chapter. Keeps on building more and more for the whole arc."

TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,bhvgcf,36,Mon Jul 13 09:29:28 2015 UTC,"So Uta seems to be keeping with his bizarre trend of lying to people for no discernable reason.  It made this chapter a frustrating read but at the very least it’s keeping the manga unpredictable.  I thought for sure Uta was going to say something to lead Haise to Tsukiyama.  I’m going to play the devil’s advocate for a minute and say that maybe Haise doesn’t actually believe what Uta’s saying in this chapter.  His inner Kaneki recognized the eyepatch mask right away. He obviously knows it’s somehow important to him, that’s why he’s investigating it by himself.  That wouldn’t be the case if he had received an object meant for something else.  Plus, if he really believed that Uta had mistakenly sent him the mask, why would he just accept it if Uta gave it to him?  Especially if it was supposed to be someone else's custom mask.  The entire conversation between the two of them is strange.  I want to see the Q's in masks so I hope Uta ends up making them.  Wouldn’t it be interesting if Uta’s eyes were actually tattooed and that’s why it looks like he has an active kakugan all the time?  It would be sort of funny if it turned out that was the only thing he was telling the truth about.  And before there are an influx of commenters complaining that they can’t keep track of characters someone posted these character status charts they got from /a/ a couple of weeks back. There's a character reference chart for the CCG, ranked ghouls, and unranked ghouls.  If anyone finds an updated version of the character lists for this week on /a/ feel free to send them to me and I'll edit this comment."
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,beatlesgirl95,16,Sun Jul 12 15:23:14 2015 UTC,"I think he's at least 80% sure Uta's full of crap and 70% sure he's lying about the eye tattoo, so I guess he suspects he's a ghoul. I'd say he's maybe just trying to suss him out to see what sort of relationship this ghoul had with Kaneki and if he's friend or foe. Which is an interesting question since us the audience dont know either.  Another interesting thing to come out of their conversation is that the book didnt come from him so further points to the likeliness that it was Hide."

To me that seems like it would be putting them in more harms way then necessary, especially since they aren't actual half ghouls(yet). To me it seems more like he is either getting a new mask made for himself(so he can do investigations as a ghoul, while also not having the CCG breathing down his neck) or that he was confirming that the mask was custom made, therefore if it fit him, it was obviously custom made for him."

That other guy was a coward who himself buckles under the threat of pain and would kill small animals to feel strong, can't see him amounting to much of anything much less making associate special class rank. Kijima himself is pretty mangled (people who work in Cochlea seem to have this kind of look) and seems like a guy who can deal and take pain.

TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,xgameboyy,3,Sun Jul 12 17:35:32 2015 UTC,"How awkward for Haise when he goes out to socialize, he'll always be the only sober one. Kuramoto looks suspicious, but he's pretty nice to Haise and he seems to be showing genuine feelings. He's one of the few who actually treat him like a fellow investigator.  It's interesting that Haise's vision seems to be getting worse, full ghouls don't really seem to need vision correction and only wear glasses for fashion. Takatsuki Sen also has glasses so perhaps it's due to being half human. He reminds me of Arima here.  Speaking of which, I have a feeling Hirako's transfer into Arima squad is related to his encounter with the Clowns at the auction. Maybe Arima is forming a task force to finish Clown off, and no better candidate than Hirako who has experience dealing with them.  Seeing the full chapter, we can see that Uta sent the mask hoping that Kaneki would visit him, but instead it was Haise so he passed it off as a mistake. A lot of people were questioning Haise's intelligence for buying his story about his eyes being tattoo'd, but he may not be lying. He certainly looks like a guy who would tattoo his eyeballs, and Uta could have actually tattoo'd them for the lolz and irony. In any case whether the tattoo is a lie or not, his kakugan look allows him to essentially hide while being out in the open so it's not a bad plan.   Haise's hair is growing back black really fast. It's only been 5 months since the auction. Yet during the 2 years since the Anteiku raid the black in his hair was only that bit at the crown. It must be related to changes in his mental stress, except it's the opposite effect. Instead of growing whiter with stress it's growing back more normally.  So Ihei was giving creepy stares to Haise because she thinks of him as a rival for Arima's acknowledgement? lol she's a fangirl.  Wow Haise's giving lectures at the academy? I wonder what the students would think if they knew he was half-ghoul, or maybe they might not even care since the Qs project seems to be getting more attention now.  Yoriko's mysterious reappearance. It's possible they were classmates, but probably not at the CCG academy. Now that I think about it they are about the same age, I always think that Bujin is older than he is."

And Haise might use the Eyepatch mask, but he is totally unaware how infamous it is. If he does use that mask, rumors among the general ghoul populace will probably start to spread that the Eyepatch ghoul is back. The repurcussions of that might be huge.  weblio thesaurus says オーダーメードする is about ordering, not making, but I guess the difference doesn't really matter here and I don't feel like looking deeper into this expression."

TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,AstralTrailerPark,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:42:13 2015 UTC,"It's probably a koukaku...judging by the fact that it must be sense but light quinque, not brittle"
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,Beddict,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:07:21 2015 UTC,That's actually a valid point. But I wonder if a Koukaku would have enough piercing power to destroy that wall.
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,RainyDayAnime,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:24:13 2015 UTC,"Koukaku quinques are typically heavy, like the giant ones Amon was always slinging around. I imagine her quinque is a bikaku since those are strong, fast and have no inherent weaknesses. Would probably have good striking power while being lightweight without sacrificing durability."
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,InfernoBA,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:04:13 2015 UTC,"If somebody told me last year that Kaneki would be wearing his mask while working as a CCG agent, I would have thought they were crazy.  Now it's the coolest thing I've heard so far. I want it to happen so much. If he wears his old mask I wonder if somebody will show up that will recognize him and cause some sort of misunderstanding... like somebody thinking he was back to his old self. Or if he has a new mask... I can only imagine that badassery.  Edit: Holy shit, I never thought Kaneki would come back through another type of torture situation... but since Chipper was revealed to be an interrogator... it doesn't seem that far off an idea anymore."

TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,Alphadude314,2,Sun Jul 19 03:13:34 2015 UTC,Ah. This is a tattoo.   Is Uta fucking stupid? Is Haise even more fucking stupid?
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,samper_,17,Sun Jul 12 15:49:38 2015 UTC,"The thing is, thats probably Uta's normal response when people ask him about his eyes. It would be more suspicious if his answer would suddenly change. And I dont believe for a second that Haise believes that excuse. That entire conversation was weird to begin with, and while Haise's primary reason was for the Qs masks, this was also a trip to discover Kaneki. He already has recognized the mask, and with knowing that this is its origin, the idea that he knows Uta and that Uta is a ghoul is not a far leap in the slightest"
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,Alphadude314,9,Sun Jul 12 16:04:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I get that none of them are telling each other (or us) what they really think. The conversation actually, to me, gave off vibes of Littlefinger and Varys from Game of Thrones, especially Uta's ""This was a present for a regular customer"" line.  I'm just poking fun at the fact that when you look at it on a base level that excuse just seems really dumb, you know, almost like a ""The dog ate my homework"" kind of excuse."
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,pickledchickenfoot,4,Sun Jul 12 16:18:29 2015 UTC,"But that excuse is only really dumb in the face of an investigator, who could possibly recognize the kagukan.

TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,samper_,4,Sun Jul 12 16:42:13 2015 UTC,scleral tattoo is a real thing
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,arcanix93,9,Sun Jul 12 17:07:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's a real thing, but:   Haise is a ghoul investigator; Ghouls use masks to hide their true identities; Uta is a maskmaker who happens to have eyes very simillar to a kakugan.   C'mon, the tattoo excuse is at least a little bit flimsy."

TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,syndbg,5,Mon Jul 13 00:16:29 2015 UTC,A tattoo huh...?   Maybe that being in bold in the chapter suggests that Haise knew what's up.

TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,oredaore,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:45:02 2015 UTC,Unlikely. Arima is the one taking in Take to be his partner. It's probably because he trust him and Ui the most that's why he recalled him to his squad.
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,konart,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:25:44 2015 UTC,The fact that Arima calls Hirako by his given name shows that he has a n amicable relationship with him. And it would be uncharacteristic for Arima to hate anyone.
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,oredaore,0,Tue Jul 14 03:49:42 2015 UTC,"Why do people think Uta will make masks for Qs or even Haise? Haise\Kaneki has no need for it. At all. As of now every dog in this manga knows who he is/was.  Qs? For what? They can wear some balaclavas or something like that, lol.  The only logical thing why Haise can be interested - if Uta make custom masks - he may have ghoul customers (he doesn't have to know whether they are ghouls or not). So Haise most likely will ask him for info about his customer as a part of investigation (he was thinking about the ways to get some info in this chapter too).  This is a good opportunity for Uta too - he can give whatever info he wants and once again manipulate Kaneki\Haise. What is more fun - he even can use this to become a regular source of info and thus be triple (quadruple? :D) agent, lol. The more - the merrier"
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,EKasis,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:35:44 2015 UTC,"Actually the IS translation doesn't reflect this, but Haise seems to be asking if Uta can make him a custom mask."
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,konart,-2,Tue Jul 14 03:53:10 2015 UTC,"Guys, maybe im just tired of it, but dont you think that the last (idk how many have been) chapters have just been mostly filler wanting to start some sort of situation or arc, then getting barely touched in the next chapters, and now theres too many filler stories?  Like I was already bored in the last chapter until O saw Haise entering the mask shop, and what do we get? The stupidest moment a ccg investigator has ever been in. Like youre just gonna ask if he sent the mask and not worry about the ghoul eyes in a ghoul-esque masks shop?  Like, seriously, i thought kaneki was already coming back in his battle against owl, and what we get is everyone forgetting about it and just slamming more stories in the book.  What happened to lizard in the first chapters? What about touka and the :re coffee shop? What about aogiri? What about the little (not so little now) ghoul girl that haise saved a few chapters ago? (Sorry forgot her name)  To me the story is going nowhere and is just filler until we get some anteiku reunion or something like that to slam kaneki back into the story.  I see maybe eith yoriko she will make some comment about touka (please i hope she does) and the story goes back on its rails, but theyre also capable of just buying some bread and walking out forever like they did in :re.  I just want the main story back, not ""The Daily Lives of Haise and the CCG"""
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,EKasis,6,Mon Jul 13 05:25:15 2015 UTC,What happened to lizard in the first chapters?  What about the little (not so little now) ghoul girl that haise saved a few chapters ago?    You should try to read the story before complaining. Seriously.
TokyoGhoul,3d0otr,Spoygg,0,Mon Jul 13 12:06:57 2015 UTC,"I did. Really. However, so much filler has been going on that so far I had forgotten about lizard until I rewatched the first season. I remember touka and the other dude (forgot his name) whenever I read the name of the manga, nothing else that happens makes me remember them. The ghoul girl I just know shes in cochlea and haise's custody was about to expire, however her only usefulness so far to bring kaneki back has been calling haise oniichan.  Point is, the story should focus on those points to not drift away from the main story, instead of giving us 3 chapters of some kind of yaoi admiration/respect/service to shu and his family (Shu's hunger and frenzied state was pretty cool tho, and the only good subplot there has been so far, in my opinion).  Hopefully with Haise making contact with Uta, another way to connect Touka to the story through Yoriko, Shu's state worsening over time because of his culinary delights, the girl's custody at cochlea about to expire, and a new brutal interrogator coming into the scene, we may see some of what made Tokyo Ghoul great in the first place... Instead of what we have now which is CCG Investigator Simulator 2015"

At first I wanted to make something about Yoshimura in Owl mode but it didn't really worked out so I just took the Kaneki vs Arima (which is the part that got me impressed the most in the entire manga) scene and started making something out of it ( http://bato.to/read/_/324959/tokyo-ghoul_v14_ch138_by_twisted-hel-scans/3 )  Since it was my first job I didn't really have in mind what to do. Everything changed when I tried to put the ""V14"" text into it in ""exclusion mode"". Well, it's kinda hard for me to explain what ""exclusion mode"" is with my poor english skills but - in very poor words - it makes the color of the object change based on what's behind it.

The bottom of the top left panel starts with ""demo"" meaning a contradiction probably.  Bottom right panel, Kaneki is saying ""Touka Chan"" in a lovely dovey way. I think it also says arigato. The bottom left panel, all I could make out was the character for father.

The only websites out there that are reporting that there is a season 3 are not reliable sources, there is nothing official announced. There will be an OVA (1 episode) adapting Tokyo Ghoul Jack, a side story about Arima airing in the fall.  The content that you are describing is the sequel to the original manga, Tokyo Ghoul :re.  If you haven't read the manga but want more Tokyo Ghoul I highly, highly recommend starting from Chapter 1 because the anime adaptation changes/omits details very early on. After you finish reading the first 143 chapters you read Tokyo Ghoul :re, the sequel.  Do not attempt to just watch the two seasons of the manga and then jump to :re, you will be extremely confused, you have to read the manga first.

But the breifcases do seem heavy enough to be used to club weaker ghouls to death with them, though it's confirmed they are made out of q-steel so that might be what that is adding to the weight."

TokyoGhoul,3cul3b,5yk0515,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:17:34 2015 UTC,"Speaking of the briefcases, what actually happens to them when the Quinque is being used? In the anime it looks as if the briefcase itself becomes the weapon."
TokyoGhoul,3cul3b,TG_Juuzou,2,Sat Jul 11 06:50:43 2015 UTC,"They take the ghouls Kakuhou make a suitcase round it + edit to make a Quinque shape they want and when they open it I think it's an electrical charge or chemical that emulates what happens within the ghoul when they release it, where the briefcase goes or how it goes back into it is never explained.   Perhaps the Quinque steel on the outside of the briefcase forms around the quinque then when finished it reverts back to it's original shape.   I think there's a lot of flaws with it if you wanted to nitpick but hey it's not a grounded universe anyway."
TokyoGhoul,3cul3b,LeMitchington,2,Sat Jul 11 11:20:28 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say whether or not the briefcase becomes part of the Quinque. When you think about a Quinque like Seidou's is even smaller than the briefcase it would fit in to then you'd think it can't be part of the Quinque or it would be bigger. Then there's the Arata and Doujima that Amon gets mid-battle with Kaneki and he's just holding the cases as they open and a Arata and Qunique appear, that really looks like the case is part of those so it's really hard to tell if it's different for each Quinque or just something that wasn't considered when drawing it."

TokyoGhoul,3cul3b,MacawsInMacau,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:41:26 2015 UTC,"Im not too sure when this is said since I've done too many rereads, but I kind of recall them saying one major attribute of a quinque is its density of rc cells, so they probably vary in weight, so maybe the investigators try to keep the weight at manageable levels. I think this has to do with why amons was said to be so heavy it was nearly impossible for the other investigators to handle."

She may have had some involvement but I think there's a little more to it.  The mask was sent by Uta at Hysy for Christmas.  That's why Haise showed up to Hysy at the end of chapter 35.  Whether the mask he was sent was the original (possibly retrieved by Hide) or was a replica made by Uta is still up for discussion.  In chapter 31.5 Haise is shown wondering what Touka might be doing on Christmas, wondering if she might be on a date (Christmas in Japan is a big couples event).  Whether or not this means anything is to be determined as well.  I would like to interpret this as Haise showing a romantic interest in Touka but we'll have to see where it goes.  The book was sent anonymously.  It was sent to Ken Kaneki for his birthday, which was December 20th (which Haise did not know).  I think it is likely to have been sent by Hide, see the this post for more info."

TokyoGhoul,3cmr57,uberscheisse,15,Thu Jul 9 02:53:54 2015 UTC,"I think I might have a glimmer of faith now, knowing that there are kids who love TG in the next generation."
TokyoGhoul,3cmr57,ThreeEyedFool,5,Thu Jul 9 04:32:23 2015 UTC,"She and her two school friends are obsessed with it. Other kids, not so much. It's getting more popular with younger kids, though."
TokyoGhoul,3cmr57,ThreeEyedFool,7,Thu Jul 9 04:41:39 2015 UTC,"I'm glad it's getting around it deserves the attention, also kudos to your daughter for being into it. It's something that requires alot of intelligence especially for an 11 year old."
TokyoGhoul,3cmr57,NothB,12,Thu Jul 9 04:48:28 2015 UTC,"She reads at the level of a 17 year old - when Chinese characters are in the mix, that's a steep learning curve.   But the show has put a curiosity in her about homosexual and androgynous personae. A fascination, ""What is this"" (since we live in rural Japan you do not see it on any level) and she, coming from a fairly conservative family, is of the opinion that love is beautiful regardless of who is sharing it.   It's one of the reasons why I'm supporting her in watching such a violent, fucked up show at age 11 - it's taken her to a higher place of thought, and she did it with only the guidance of art. Same thing I did with punk rock when I was a kid. So... I'm on side."
TokyoGhoul,3cmr57,ThreeEyedFool,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:26:52 2015 UTC,"OMG that thing with homosexuality is so true.Good conclusion.I think every anime is proof to hollywood that with simple animation knowledge and budget you can make a great story!Wait a minute punk rock no way!Im into same stuff from my earliest days I started with RHCP and Green Day.And today i bougt Bleach (Nirvana LP).Im also into NOFX,Rancid,Sum 41.."
TokyoGhoul,3cmr57,NothB,2,Thu Jul 9 12:17:30 2015 UTC,"Being 43 I've seen most of those  bands in concert (even promoted a Rancid show once).  Especially with young women it seems there can be a fascination with more feminine male figures, which somewhat explains the popularity of more androgynous/feminine-identifying bands such as The Cure, Placebo, Nirvana, etc.   In fact, I think every TG fan could become obsessed with Placebo... the whole idea of the show reminds me of this song."

TokyoGhoul,3cmr57,NothB,-1,Thu Jul 9 13:05:54 2015 UTC,"Hey threeeydfool,I disagree.I think TG and other 'seinen'and 'horror anime aswell as shounen doesnt require alot of intelligence in the way other people see intelligence.I would call it emotional intelligence.OK 11 year old girl watches TG.I watched it when i was twelve.Just saying if I rewatch it with 40 years i will probably lose my emotional intelligence where,one of my favourite anime becomes extremely boring cartoon.I think thats why here mom isnt into it but she could maybe try Death Note,which i wouldnt find boring at age of 40 im sure.Im 13 now.Have a nice day!"
TokyoGhoul,3cmr57,TheMikarin,4,Thu Jul 9 09:06:54 2015 UTC,"You'd be surprised how much of Tokyo Ghoul goes over people's heads. We're referring mainly to the manga here when speaking of the intelligence, which was more complex than the anime in terms of story, symbolism, foreshadowing and development. The anime doesn't give the full picture, but the way the story progresses and such does require some level of maturity to fully appreciate.  Death Note involves a lot of mind games, but it really doesn't require the reader to be particularly intelligent since they explain pretty much everything for the reader."
TokyoGhoul,3cmr57,Edadinasni,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:26:37 2015 UTC,I havent read manga.I watched both anime like 3 times and I think Death Note is kinda better.Maybe its just mine personal opinion.Anyway thanks for the explanation I rly like it.I read a bit of AOT manga and in compare with anime it was idk...It felt diffrent and I havent liked it.I hope with TG its not the case since I  rly wanna try it out!
TokyoGhoul,3cmr57,shinny099,2,Thu Jul 9 19:15:06 2015 UTC,"You'd have to read from the beginning since the anime left out a lot. It's definitely worth it though, especially since the anime was just a what-if version of events, and probably won't continue. The manga is still ongoing."
TokyoGhoul,3cmr57,MadGameHouse,3,Thu Jul 9 22:45:14 2015 UTC,"I'm curious about what you mean - I watched Death Note at age 41 and found it dull as shit. I didn't find a significant difference between DN and TG as far as being emotionally intelligent goes... I actually found DN to be more focused on emotions, TG to be more focused on primal instinct...  But it's cool to hear it from you, being 13 and all. I'm 30 years older than you and this is all new to me, 絶対おっさんだな・・・"

TokyoGhoul,3cmr57,ThreeEyedFool,2,Thu Jul 9 23:43:45 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't completely agree with you but I do understand your point. I think of Tokyo Ghoul to be less of having to be intelligent, but more knowledgeable than anything. Reason why is because to fully understand the incredibly structured story and symbolism in Tokyo Ghoul, is to know the reasons behind it's symbolism. The water's a lot deeper than you think when looking at the surface would be a good metaphor to apply to it. Tokyo Ghoul has a ridiculously large amount of Psychological levels that one must understand the ideas of human nature to even grasp. Now not all of them are mindbogglingly hard to understand but a good amount require a lot of thought and research. I've spent many hours going through countless theories and ideas that explores Tokyo Ghoul to the very depths and every step I take I feel like there's more things Sui Ishida left around for us to discover. But that's also thanks to him just being an overall great writer in general. Just my two cents though."
TokyoGhoul,3cmr57,Edadinasni,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:50:11 2015 UTC,I'm really interested in what your saying. But I seriously don't understand what your saying not because of your grammar I'm genuinely confused could you please elaborate further?
TokyoGhoul,3cmr57,ThreeEyedFool,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:20:20 2015 UTC,"Im from a far away country called Serbia.Im really sorry about my grammar.So anyway my point was in DN there was much more mindgames.The trick with writing with his blood on piece of paper from Death Note was mindblowing.The position of L and Light feels like the one between Walter and Hank in Breaking Bad,if you know what i mean."
TokyoGhoul,3cmr57,NothB,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:14:26 2015 UTC,"Oh know your grammar was fine, though I still don't get the point your trying to make..."
TokyoGhoul,3cmr57,NothB,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:03:37 2015 UTC,"I don't know what ""emotionally intelligent"" means, but I guess what he's trying to say is Death Note is miles away from Tokyo Ghoul in terms of strategy and mind-games.   It's something that requires alot of intelligence especially for an 11 year old.   He's countering this statement."
TokyoGhoul,3cmr57,shinny099,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:35:41 2015 UTC,His statement doesn't really seem to be efficient at countering my statement

TokyoGhoul,3cmr57,Edadinasni,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:17:28 2015 UTC,"I find DN to be more of 'pratical' intelligence as it's about mind game where you have to instantly come up with new ideas and be flexible to defeat your opponents, just like one playing chess. Compared to TG, I don't see any depth to the story as everything is explained, characters' motives are straight-forward except Light who got corrupted near the end of the story. The point that the author tried to raise was a person's morality. When gained an overwhelming power, one might get devoured by their own power."

If you've read them most of what's happening is relatively clear, especially since we haven't had any confusing fight scenes or anything.  Here is a super brief summary of each though:  Chapter 33: Tsukiyama's father is upset because he is not sure how to help Tsukiyama.  He mentions that because of inbreeding he is unable to control his kagune and might not be able to become a kakuja.  The CCG is discussing investigating the Rosewald family.  Aogiri tree talks about maybe breaking Hinami out but worry that the security has been upped so it is harder.  There is a flashback to when Hinami first joined Aogiri.  Haise visits Hinami in Cochlea, as he is leaving he sees a freaky looking guy (Shiki Kijima) that says he is going to be helping his team with the investigation.  Chapter 34: Shizaru has a nightmare about his father and Nutcracker.  The CCG continues to talk about the investigation.  Ui's partner is introduced, Hairu Ihe. Shizaru and Haise go to pick up Shizaru's new quinque made from Nutcraker but Shizaru gets sick just looking at it.  Kanae is talking to Hori and freaking out that he can't help Tsukiyama and is too loyal for his own good.  Chapter 35 : The chapter is almost entirely Tsukiyama freaking out and the staff trying to subdue him.  Kanae continues to be super upset about it.  The CCG set up a decoy to try to capture members of the Rose family.  Haise goes to visit Hysy to learn where the mask he was given for Xmas came from."

The point about the art being nearly identical is just bullshit, has he ever set foot in DeviantArt? There are literally thousands of people who can mimic their favourite mangaka's art style.  This guy is equivalent of the 'jet fuel can't melt steel beams' conspiracy for mangaka."

TokyoGhoul,3cemu1,Alluka-,2,Tue Jul 7 20:58:26 2015 UTC,haha i think ishida just really likes hxh and i can see how he got a lot of inspiration from togashi  if you remember ishida was really stressed when making the tokyo ghoul anime and it was easy to tell it was all new to him unlike togashi who has a lot of experience already  so I think that right there debunks this crazy theory lol  I cant get over how the guy in the youtube video butchers the majority of eveyones names lol

TokyoGhoul,3chq9a,Gorodhaner,4,Wed Jul 8 02:06:36 2015 UTC,Read the manga tbh. Would be best to start from chapter 1. Season 2 of anime is pretty different from the second half of the manga.

TokyoGhoul,3chq9a,enfermedad,2,Wed Jul 8 02:18:26 2015 UTC,"Copying and pasting this comment of mine from another thread.   The anime was a what-if version of the story, you need to the read the manga to follow the actual story. Even if you don't normally like reading manga, give it a shot. It's worth it, and far better than the anime version. READ FROM CHAPTER 1. The anime omitted a lot of important information and scenes throughout, so you need to read from the beginning to avoid missing anything and to properly understand the story. It's worth reading from the beginning though, many of us have read it more than once since it's packed with so much foreshadowing and symbolism that's easy to miss the first time around.  Basically here's the reading order:  Tokyo Ghoul (chapters 1 to 143): http://bato.to/read/_/67864/tokyo-ghoul_v1_ch1_by_lazy-ass-scans  Tokyo Ghoul:JACK (since you've watched the anime, you can also read this first if you want to view everything chronologically): http://bato.to/read/_/269972/tokyo-ghoul-jack_v1_ch1_by_kawa-scans  Tokyo Ghoul:JOKER: http://bato.to/read/_/257690/tokyo-ghoul_by_twisted-hel-scans  Tokyo Ghoul:re (absolutely essential to read after the first manga, no matter what you think of the first manga's ending): http://imperialscans.com/read/tokyo-ghoul-re/1-bone/1  JACK and JOKER are optional, and can be read even after you catch up to :re. Despite JOKER taking place in between the first manga and :re, it was actually released around halfway through the first manga. Most people assumed it was non-canon, but it turns out it actually takes place after the first manga. Since it does contain minor spoilers, read it only after finishing the first manga. JACK actually has a different style from the regular manga.  Another bit of content you can read for fun is the Tokyo Ghoul ONESHOT. It's essentially the prototype for Tokyo Ghoul, the early version the author drew before doing the actual series we know. It's completely non-canon, but interesting to see. You can read it whenever you want: http://bato.to/read/_/278968/tokyo-ghoul-oneshot_by_kawa-scans  DO NOT TRY TO READ :RE WITHOUT READING THE FIRST MANGA. The anime was a what-if version of events, so you'll be missing a huge portion of the story and will misunderstand several things if you rely on the anime. The manga's version of the story is much better than the anime's. Don't skip even early manga chapters either, since a lot of what the anime cut out is important throughout the series."

TokyoGhoul,3cea8e,killer1joker,3,Tue Jul 7 06:08:49 2015 UTC,I think it'll look good but should leave some space in the center where the smallest poster is for a small shelf.  Shelf could house all the manga as it comes out + a few figures to complete the wall. I ordered a mask 2-3 days ago just to hang off my manga shelf as decoration could be a nice touch to finish it.   On the posters I'd spend a while looking as there are some amazing posters.Search properly so you know they're your favourite from what's available + don't ask opinions on posters long  as you'll have to look at them everyday so as long as you like them it's fine.
TokyoGhoul,3cea8e,TG_Juuzou,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:49:10 2015 UTC,I do like the idea of a shelf however right now I'm loving in a house off my college campus so per my lease I can't put shelves up. That is a good idea for when I move out though. The 2 side scrolls are my favorite pictures of Touka/Kaneki.

TokyoGhoul,3cajk8,konart,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:44:36 2015 UTC,I did some googling and found that that user moved their tumblr to laelith.tumblr.com.  Here is a direct link to summaries and semi-translations.  I'll add things as I find them.  Here is an additional tumblr post with a few others.  Here is a bato.to forum link that has some of the illustrations.  The TG wiki has a summary for one of the chapters about Kaneki.
TokyoGhoul,3cajk8,enfermedad,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:13:15 2015 UTC,What's it about?
TokyoGhoul,3cajk8,-AlexGrey-,3,Mon Jul 6 20:19:03 2015 UTC,They are a series of novels that are side stories about some of the characters.  I think the most important one is the Tsukiyama one that introduces Hori because she's part of the current arc in :re.
TokyoGhoul,3cajk8,enfermedad,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:25:15 2015 UTC,"was never scanlated, someone on tumblr did translate it though should look for that"

TokyoGhoul,3cboln,xgameboyy,5,Mon Jul 6 17:59:48 2015 UTC,"I hope to keep doing more (fingers crossed)  I'm a big fan of cinemasins and I know the anime already takes a lot of heat, so I figured people would enjoy seeing someone take a comedic take on it rather than a rant-a-thon.   But yeah, I hope to keep this going. Hence why I'm going a week at a time"
TokyoGhoul,3cboln,T-Rex_whisperer,3,Mon Jul 6 18:03:30 2015 UTC,"Please keep doing these, I really enjoyed reading it!"
TokyoGhoul,3cboln,TheMikarin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:40:10 2015 UTC,That's the (hopeful) goal! One episode per week so I can stay (somewhat) humorous and not rant all over the place.
TokyoGhoul,3cboln,Alluka-,5,Tue Jul 7 04:45:30 2015 UTC,"You might want to read until around chapter 79 (around the end of the arc) before continuing with the anime since season 1 covers a few more things past chapter 60. That way the anime won't spoil anything for you (anime is supplementary, while the manga is the actual story). You might actually like the anime season 1 finale more if you've read the manga version, since that was one of the few parts that was done very well.  Don't bother with season 2 until you've finished the manga though (season 2 sort of requires reading the manga first to understand fully), and maybe even after you've caught up to :re (to help avoid getting mixed up between anime and manga events)."
TokyoGhoul,3cboln,TheMikarin,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:30:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this information!! I was expecting the anime to cover two chapters per episode, but it felt like they covered almost five in the first episode (I assumed it was to try and hook audiences as fast as possible), but what you're saying makes more sense with the span of episodes."
TokyoGhoul,3cboln,LegendOfCookie,3,Mon Jul 6 19:33:14 2015 UTC,You are sadly mistaken my friend. Season 1 adapts about 5-6 chapters per episode on average. Hope that helps puts things into perspective.
TokyoGhoul,3cboln,Edadinasni,2,Mon Jul 6 20:44:06 2015 UTC,"The anime omits a lot of information and scenes throughout, so it's really just bonus content for manga readers. It doesn't work as a full story on its own, so for those who haven't read the manga it's intended to be an extended, spoiler-filled promo for the manga."

TokyoGhoul,3c9fpl,TheCoxer,43,Mon Jul 6 03:15:42 2015 UTC,"I trust Ishida to give us a good ending regardless whether it's happy, sad, or somewhere in between I think I'll be satisfied.    Though I would like Kaneki/Sasaki to have a break, he has been suffering this entire series.  It makes for a great manga but you gotta feel bad for the guy."
TokyoGhoul,3c9fpl,enfermedad,11,Mon Jul 6 03:55:55 2015 UTC,"It will be a bittersweet ending, possibly. Atleast, that's what I think anyway."
TokyoGhoul,3c9fpl,SkyrimForTheDragons,32,Mon Jul 6 04:53:48 2015 UTC,"It was foreshadowed a happy ending when one of the beginning pages says ""The sky next to tragedy is a clear blue."""
TokyoGhoul,3c9fpl,Kamishini,20,Mon Jul 6 04:24:44 2015 UTC,if RE isnt going to be a happy ending the whats the point of it.
TokyoGhoul,3c9fpl,staticccc,5,Mon Jul 6 04:20:20 2015 UTC,To close up the series?
TokyoGhoul,3c9fpl,MadGameHouse,2,Mon Jul 6 05:20:20 2015 UTC,hence the first being a tragedy and the second being ......
TokyoGhoul,3c9fpl,staticccc,4,Mon Jul 6 05:56:46 2015 UTC,It never really stopped being a tragedy. It is a continuation of the last manga after all. Lots of misfortunes have occurred in :re regarding characters from the previous manga and new ones that were just introduced into the series rather than Kaneki Spoilers. I guess the point I'm trying to get across is I personally think of :re as a continuation of the tragedy from the first manga. It hasn't ended yet and there is still plenty more to witness in the future chapters.
TokyoGhoul,3c9fpl,MadGameHouse,2,Mon Jul 6 06:27:59 2015 UTC,"There's definitely more tragedy on the way. No doubt about that, but unlike the first installment of the series which began and ended with tragedy, :re from its very first chapter with the quote ""the sky next to the tragedy is.. clear blue"" looks like at least its ending wont be."
TokyoGhoul,3c9fpl,bhvgcf,16,Mon Jul 6 14:40:05 2015 UTC,"They all die, Tsukiyama finds his beloved Kaneki and walks into the sunset eating him"

TokyoGhoul,3c9fpl,18custodioj,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:02:16 2015 UTC,we know...
TokyoGhoul,3c9fpl,balamory,14,Wed Jul 8 17:04:57 2015 UTC,":Re is no longer a tragedy, but the series is also not one of those ""happily ever after"" types. From how things are playing out and the things that are foreshadowed it will probably end ""well"" for Kaneki, but that doesn't necessarily mean it will be happy."
TokyoGhoul,3c9fpl,oredaore,9,Mon Jul 6 04:31:02 2015 UTC,The series follows a very interesting parralel to the fool's journey. As most long time fans should know the tarrot cards play a major role in the series. They even put tarrot card numbers in chapters to show which stage we're in. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fqsUoWwlLm0ineOAzAQrpW7BHqPvPi3NgdzMBDjpIGs/edit The final tarrot card is The World. Which is supposed to symbolize a major accomplishment and is generally a positive happy card. This could mean many things for the ending but it probably symbolizes kaneki's accomplishment of something. Possibly bridging the gap between humans and ghouls or some personal triumph over his enemies whoever they are by the end of this series.
TokyoGhoul,3c9fpl,Thatcoolguy1135,5,Mon Jul 6 07:55:57 2015 UTC,"The World plus Sun and Judgement basically confirm Kaneki's success in the final arcs of the manga. I imagine that includes fully merging his personalities, getting a full kakuja, surpassing Arima, defeating V, bridging the gap between humans and ghouls"
TokyoGhoul,3c9fpl,dippindots326,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:13:42 2015 UTC,"I agree except I'm not sure if V will be an ally or an enemy. As of right now Aogiri seems to be the biggest threat with 3 super powerful ghouls eto, noro, and tatara. Although the leader of V and the clowns might be equally strong too."
TokyoGhoul,3c9fpl,Thatcoolguy1135,5,Mon Jul 6 08:47:25 2015 UTC,I want a happy ending. We've already gotten a tragic end in the first manga. So what was the point to continue it if it wasn't gonna change?
TokyoGhoul,3c9fpl,AceMan117,2,Mon Jul 6 06:39:52 2015 UTC,Imo it would be bad if it wouldn't get an happy end.
TokyoGhoul,3c9fpl,Dooder39,2,Mon Jul 6 09:33:13 2015 UTC,"Maybe Kaneki will become the next One-eyed King and work with CCG to try to work out better rights for ghouls. Since he'll act as ""boss"" to a large organization of strong ghouls, and he has a positive relationship with the CCG reaper Amira they could work something out. Even if in the end most of his friends are either dead or missing, or he just lives in isolation from the world, I'm thinking he'll have met a balance on how he sees both humans and ghouls."
TokyoGhoul,3c9fpl,KisaTheMistress,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:27:35 2015 UTC,"I expect for there to be a happy ending, but I also expect struggles and heartbreak along the way. Regardless, I think Ishida will do a good job with it."
TokyoGhoul,3c9fpl,JokersMaze,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:32:57 2015 UTC,"It's not going to be completely positive, but Sasaneki will essentially be an all powerful Buddha full kakuja at the end, judging from Herman Hesse references, the ""legend"", and of course the fool's journey. He'll definitely be short a few friends"
TokyoGhoul,3c9fpl,dippindots326,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:07:57 2015 UTC,"Personally yes. As much as I like my boy Kaneki, I just can't imagine him riding into the sunset feeling everything is okay because it's fucking not.

Of course, this would require closure in a number of areas, but there will definitely be some mysteries left unsolved."
TokyoGhoul,3c9fpl,Karguk,0,Mon Jul 6 14:55:08 2015 UTC,I'd like the loose ends to be tied up and Kaneki to finally have the release he needs (death). :3

TokyoGhoul,3c9z8k,PleaseMakeMeSmile,5,Mon Jul 6 06:53:19 2015 UTC,"Recently Ishida has been coloring his hair blue as opposed to the previous purple color he used. These pictures are of Tsukiyama in part 1 as well, so I'm not sure of it really means that his hair color actually changed. It could also be related to some sort of symbolism (I've seen a post somewhere regarding hair color symbolism, though I'm not sure how true it is), or Ishida may have just decided he wanted to change Tsukiyama's hair color because he felt like it.   The colors he uses aren't always consistent, he's also colored Touka's hair as black, violet and blue in different colored images from part 1, where her hair color remained the same in-universe. In :re her hair has actually changed colors though.  Since Tsukiyama's hair is being shown as blue even in part 1 images now, it's likely that his hair hasn't actually changed color unlike Touka and Kaneki's. I could be wrong though. I haven't seen any confirmation by Ishida, but I may have just missed it.  Here's a picture of him with blue hair from Ishida's twitter:  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B_HBY-xVIAAGChh.png"

TokyoGhoul,3c9z8k,Alluka-,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:52:25 2015 UTC,It's probably for symbolic reasons.  Anime colors can't be seen as canon most of the time because they are almost always different from the original.

TokyoGhoul,3c6wab,Hjgduyhwsgah_RP,21,Sun Jul 5 12:31:24 2015 UTC,"Kaneki was starving to death when he smelt the dead body, when sane we've never seen him use the ability but I'm sure he could.   Haise rejects his ghoul side and only uses it when completely necessary so perhaps can't tap into these senses. It's like Kaneki always had the strength to break free from his chair (When fed and not being surpressed) but it took him accepting his ghoul side to tap into that power I feel it's the same kind of thing as Haise.   I'm confused with the Q's as it's clearly effected Urie at times like a ghoul but even if the frame was 99% removed it's still just a quinque framed inside them, I feel the procedure modified them more than they've been told."
TokyoGhoul,3c6wab,TG_Juuzou,4,Sun Jul 5 13:12:20 2015 UTC,I think somehow having parts of a ghoul (in this case their kagune) inside them increased their RC cell count. Maybe if the Quinx reach a high enough RC count they'll stop being able to eat human food? Maybe humans with a high RC count begin gaining ghoulish qualities.
TokyoGhoul,3c6wab,TG_Juuzou,7,Sun Jul 5 13:22:40 2015 UTC,"This is what I mean though just have a Quinque inside you within a frame separating it from your body shouldn't affect you like this, also the fact they can deploy it + control it like a ghoul. It's definitely more a part of them than just aframed quinque."
TokyoGhoul,3c6wab,Alphadude314,2,Sun Jul 5 13:25:32 2015 UTC,Yeah. And it was supposed to be a high risk operation too. Perhaps the quinque is acting as a kakuhou of sorts?
TokyoGhoul,3c6wab,TG_Juuzou,9,Sun Jul 5 13:32:07 2015 UTC,"As far as im concerned the CCG just repeated Kanou's experiments with the Quinx.   1) He was orginally part of the CCG and his depature has been hinted to have to do with the half-ghoul experiments.  2) The CCG got complete access to his lab, though important parts were destroyed, Its by no means a small find.  3) The Quinx show every sign of being half-ghouls, increased regeneration, ability to eat human flesh to recover, enhanced senses, high RC count, a kagune  The entire ""built in Quinques"" thing is probably just a cover up to prevent people from freaking out or trying to kill them. Though the Kakugan is different, I would expect the Frame to have something to do with that. If removed  the Quinx will likely become full half-ghouls"
TokyoGhoul,3c6wab,oredaore,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:34:44 2015 UTC,They have to have a Kakuhou or some sort of chemical reaction similar to what happens with investigators briefcase quinque's to activate them.   I highly doubt they told them but I think thye must have a Kakuhou inside them there's no other way there's a risk of them becoming half ghouls without it.
TokyoGhoul,3c6wab,FatedAwakening,3,Sun Jul 5 14:38:46 2015 UTC,"What's inside the Qs is a quinque steel coated kakuhou capable of releasing an actual kagune. The only reason why CCG refers to it as a built-in quinque is because the same quinque steel that is used to make quinque is used to contain the kakuhou so that they can control the extent of the transplanted kakuhou's effect on the investigator's body (the frames). The kakuhou inside appears unmodified (unlike normal quinque) so it's really no different from what ghouls have but with a limiter.  The Qs also do know they have a kakuhou inside them, when Urie and Shirazu were getting into a fight Shirazu taunted that he would rip Urie's kakuhou out and roast it."
TokyoGhoul,3c6wab,TG_Juuzou,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:32:30 2015 UTC,"It's like Kaneki always had the strength to break free from his chair (When fed and not being surpressed)   Well, in the manga, it had nothing to do with accepting his ghoul side, it was just that he was starved; he took a bite out of Jason's cheek so he could have the strength to break out."
TokyoGhoul,3c6wab,FatedAwakening,0,Sun Jul 5 19:59:51 2015 UTC,"Yes it does (+ accepting he was just being weak) upon acceptance however he basically rips his own face off, he does take a bite out of Jason but I don't think it was necessary to break out (Jason is talking about cannibalism) as he was being fed + he had essentially ripped his face off which was fully healed so he wasn't starved."
TokyoGhoul,3c6wab,TG_Juuzou,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:04:58 2015 UTC,"He rips his own face...u wot m8? Where'd you get that from? his face was covered in blood From eating Rise, no faces were harmed in the production of that panel. Also, took place in his own head.  Either way, he was only fed enough to able to heal; because RC cells are most comparable to fuel, it was all being dedicated towards healing, so he couldn't use the energy to break out of his restraints. Think of when you're sick. You have low energy, possibly very drowsy, and you're recommended to rest so your body can fix itself."
TokyoGhoul,3c6wab,FatedAwakening,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:55:12 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure he did that to himself and wasn't imaging it.   You do realize a human lasts them a month? Kaneki was being fed enough to heal daily I imagine, he obviously had enough strength to do something as small as break out considering he was surpressed.   Imo opinion he bit Jason as a fuck you as he spoke about cannibalizing but it's open to interpretation I guess"
TokyoGhoul,3c6wab,TG_Juuzou,2,Mon Jul 6 15:09:32 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure he did that to himself and wasn't imaging it.    Do you have any evidence for this? no? Then we shouldn't assume he did. God, I'm tired of people using things they think might have happened that are unfalsifiable to justify their reasoning.   You do realize a human lasts them a month? Kaneki was being fed enough to heal daily I imagine, he obviously had enough strength to do something as small as break out considering he was surpressed.   And only enough to break put. Regardless of how little it takes, he just needed to be fed less than that.   Imo opinion he bit Jason as a fuck you as he spoke about cannibalizing but it's open to interpretation I guess   Might be a bit of both."

TokyoGhoul,3c6wab,FatedAwakening,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:05:03 2015 UTC,no faces were harmed in the production of that panel   what about Rise's face? and Jason's face when Kaneki bites his cheek
TokyoGhoul,3c6wab,HokageEzio,2,Tue Jul 7 11:22:45 2015 UTC,of that panel
TokyoGhoul,3c6wab,HokageEzio,8,Tue Jul 7 12:05:35 2015 UTC,"At the current state, I can guarantee the Quinx can't smell the difference.  They're all still eating human food, to my knowledge.  For all intents and purposes, they are human.  The only ghoul in their squad is Kaneki.  Now if they keep pulling back those gates, like Urie has, then soon maybe."
TokyoGhoul,3c6wab,HokageEzio,4,Sun Jul 5 13:25:08 2015 UTC,"Yup, all eating human food, although I think they gain some boost from human flesh (Urie ate a bit of his arm to get his ""kagune"" to deploy, didn't he?) It'll be interesting to see where that goes."
TokyoGhoul,3c6wab,oredaore,2,Sun Jul 5 13:32:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, anybody with a kagune can get benefits from flesh I believe.  It's just the nature of having a kagune.  From what I remember, Kaneki was trying to mix more into Mutsuki's diet because she has the lowest amount of RC cells.  It's basically just going to be that the closer they become to ghouls, the stronger they will become.  And that is exactly what the CCG want, guinea pigs to see how far it will go before making them monsters (I'm sure they are in love with Urie as a subject)."
TokyoGhoul,3c6wab,Gruhnts,3,Sun Jul 5 13:37:04 2015 UTC,"Mhm. Which'll be interesting to see. Will the CCG just dispose of them once they get out of hand? How will the investigators handle it? I could see some of the more ethical/prominent ones being against it, saying the CCG made them into monsters, but some might just see it as more ""Hurr durr ghouls are bad""."
TokyoGhoul,3c6wab,0Ninjaz0,3,Sun Jul 5 13:54:28 2015 UTC,"Well they're already prepared to kill Haise if the time comes, we saw Arima tighten up real quick when he saw him walk down those steps at the auction.  Difference is he's SS rank already, so they have reason to prepare.  Especially Arima, he got scratched by him.  He knows first hand how dangerous Kaneki would be.   I'm sure most of the CCG would be happy to kill them, we already saw them getting trash talked near the start of Re when they called them ghouls (which is like spitting in someone's face when they feel like they are on humanity's side)."
TokyoGhoul,3c6wab,KuroiKokujin,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:59:33 2015 UTC,"True, but Mutsuki got complimented by one of the squads at the auction (I honestly can't remember which squad, there's just so many investigators being introduced...). I'd like to think if they had to be exterminated, the investigators would at least feel bad about the Quinx. Maybe not Haise, seeing as Eyepatch/Centipede was such a dangerous ghoul, even if he didn't kill any investigators."

TokyoGhoul,3c5abu,SkyrimForTheDragons,67,Mon Jul 6 06:22:35 2015 UTC,Compared to last week this chapter was really exciting.   Classic. Shuu looks like he's been stuffing his face for quite a while yet he's losing a lot of weight. I still have no idea what happened. Did Kanae really go full Dobby? He's hurting himself like a house elf would lol. This dude looks way too much like the guy Touka mistook for Kaneki for it to be a coincidence. Everything ranging from the hair to the freckle to the head tilt is the same. Hairy's a yandere then. RIP Matsumae. Can't wait for the clowns to finally make Sasaki/Kaneki their toy again :) Oh and up till now I wonder why no one questions Uta's constantly active kakugans. I suppose he just kills any humans (including ghoul investigators) that walk into his shop or something...then again that would attract too much unwanted attention. There could be another Anteiku raid.
TokyoGhoul,3c5abu,Pereeia,14,Sat Jul 4 22:52:39 2015 UTC,"He's always with his kagunan that i started thinking it was an ocular tattoo. Besides, isnt it easy to identify Uta as a ghoul since is mask doesnt cover his personal characteristics like tattoos, size and hairstyle?"

TokyoGhoul,3c5abu,majihpo,43,Sat Jul 4 22:57:10 2015 UTC,but Haise enters the shop and Uta is not wearing the sunglasses so it's either he knew by the scent that it was Kaneki or Uta does not give a flying fuck
TokyoGhoul,3c5abu,nikanna28,20,Sat Jul 4 23:14:27 2015 UTC,"Since he was the one that sent the mask I think he would be expecting him to come, but yeah I could see Uta not giving a fuck about people seeing his kakugan."
TokyoGhoul,3c5abu,majihpo,13,Sat Jul 4 23:27:02 2015 UTC,Yeah but he sent that mask months ago in the manga and Uta has said that he does have human customers so he either had to know it was Haiseneki or he doesn't give a fuck.

TokyoGhoul,3c5abu,ImAnAppleBiteMe,14,Sun Jul 5 07:20:17 2015 UTC,I'm sure uta is very crafty and manipulative ghoul but I doubt he is on youshimuras level unless he got a powerup over the timeskips. Afterall him and yomo are supposed to be about equal strength. Yomo probably wasn't as strong as yoshimura was otherwise he would of helped anteiku overwhelm the ccg. Although the manager may of just wanted yomo to stay out of the fight so that he could protect touka and hinami but still the ccg would of gotten rekt by two owl level kakujas.
TokyoGhoul,3c5abu,Thatcoolguy1135,5,Sun Jul 5 10:56:54 2015 UTC,Uta is probably way stronger than Yomo because he always held back and never used his kagune
TokyoGhoul,3c5abu,LegendOfCookie,6,Sun Jul 5 16:39:59 2015 UTC,"It never actually showed yomo's and uta's battles we don't know if uta used his kagune, but he probably did use it. The only reason they never went all out, as stated in the manga, is because they were so equal they thought they would kill each other if they tried. Even after the time skip they are probably still even because both him and yomo either still train or just stayed the same level. I think at some point in the manga those two are going to fight and it's going to be really cool seeing their kakujas activate."
TokyoGhoul,3c5abu,Thatcoolguy1135,6,Mon Jul 6 01:40:00 2015 UTC,Wait if he turns 360 degrees wouldn't he just be facing uta still and walk towards him. But yeah lol he literally just walks through the door and uta is just oh hi im a ghoul nice to meet you dove this is my place of business.

He admits that he has human customers occasionally, so wouldnt such a thing cause him trouble? I could see him justifying it as a contact lens, but thats still quite out of the ordinary."
TokyoGhoul,3c5abu,Alphadude314,13,Sat Jul 4 23:28:06 2015 UTC,"Uta gives no fucks, even when hes fighting he doesn't care, it looks like he knew Haise was coming and he feels like he is in control here and thats why he can show the ghoul investigator both his faace and kakugan."
TokyoGhoul,3c5abu,killmenow506,5,Sat Jul 4 23:47:17 2015 UTC,I remember him being worried about the ccg seeing even his tattoos in a chapter ages ago so it seems a little out of character that he would just run up to the ccg and go see this is me I am ghoul. although he propobly knows its haise so he figures he must want to know about kaneki because what other reason could he be there other than to return the mask and get info on kaneki. in short I think this is a trap.
TokyoGhoul,3c5abu,balamory,2,Sun Jul 5 01:28:01 2015 UTC,It wasn't just the CCG but his tattoos appearing on camera at all when he's fighting with Tsukiyama and Yomo.
TokyoGhoul,3c5abu,CandyAltruism,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:21:20 2015 UTC,"Haise has a separate agenda aside from the CCG even though he works for them. If CCG were to review camera footage and identified him through his tattoos it would have been troublesome for him, but since it's Haise who he knows won't blow his cover then it's not really a problem. And he sent the mask directly to Haise, not the CCG so it's not likely the CCG will ever find HySy on their own."

I haven't updated it in a couple of chapters.  His hair is longer and blacker now.  Edit: I started a new image starting chapter 32 after the time skip of a hair comparison since the other image was getting large/long.
TokyoGhoul,3c5abu,enfermedad,8,Sun Jul 5 00:18:19 2015 UTC,it's because is more black than whait now. it was almost totally white before.
TokyoGhoul,3c5abu,marniconuke,2,Sun Jul 5 00:10:21 2015 UTC,it reminds me off arima's haircut in jack. all it really looks like is he decided to actually comb it now.
TokyoGhoul,3c5abu,balamory,3,Sun Jul 5 01:16:38 2015 UTC,"And that might actually be the reason for the changed haircut, just like Fura's reintroduction: It's cross-promotion for the Jack OVA. It's not like Ishida hasn't done this before. Do you remember that Kaneki went to Kanou's hospital wearing an Arima wig? Or that Fura appeared in volumes 9/10? Jack was being serialized at that time."

TokyoGhoul,3c5abu,killmenow506,12,Sat Jul 4 23:44:50 2015 UTC,"I know people have mentioned how :re is paralleling the original TG before but you see it again here in this chapter.  In chapter 34 of the original TG Kaneki goes to the Helter Skelter bar to meet with clowns (Itori and Uta) who send him to the Gourmet where he almost gets killed with the promise of giving him more info (on who crushed Rize with the beams). I wonder if Uta will do the same thing here, somehow sending Haise to meet with Tsukiyama with the promise of giving him info if he does."
TokyoGhoul,3c5abu,enfermedad,9,Sun Jul 5 01:35:49 2015 UTC,"As much as I love the parallels, I hope it doesn't have so many, because I want it to feel ""fresh"" at times, and with how much we sleuth out every little action of Shui nowadays it feels like its not some cool little thing for us to realize later but something we expect now =/ . Either way, as long as I get my RE I'm happy."
TokyoGhoul,3c5abu,fightn,2,Sun Jul 5 05:21:45 2015 UTC,"For me at least, the inclusion of new characters like the Q's, wild cards like Takizawa (seriously who expected him to come back), and the inner struggle of Kaneki vs Sasaki has kept the story exciting enough for me to look forward to it every week.  I see the illusions to the original story but I'm still constantly surprised and on the edge of my seat by it.  I didn't even expect Haise to visit Uta at the end of this chapter at all.  It makes sense that he would seek it out after getting the mask in 31.5 though.  I only noticed it was similar to the original TG when I went back to it to see what was happening in the original that I noticed the similarity."
TokyoGhoul,3c5abu,enfermedad,11,Sun Jul 5 13:06:45 2015 UTC,"Translation error where Mirumo is talking to Kanae, he's actually asking him if he'd also like some wine. Also on the first page in the raws as Mirumo grew exasperated with repeating Kanae's name he says loudly for the last time THE Kanae in English, I thought it was a funny character quirk of Mirumo that should have made it into the translation.  Tsukiyama's blanket has a checkered pattern dundundun!  Kanae is not supposed to be shouting ""bring me my"" he is shouting about a powder, which you can seen the servants administering to Tsukiyama in the very next page.  ""The family is in your hands now"" while it's not completely wrong I find this translation a bit too dramatic, he's simply trying to say ""please continue to take care of things"".   Seems while Tsukiyama is in the state of his kagune running loose he doesn't remember any of it and his servants are candy coating everything for him. It's almost as if they are enabling his downward spiral by being too nice to him rather than letting him know just how bad things are with his condition.  Poor tormented Kanae. His suffering mirrors Tsukiyama's. They are both suffering due to the loss of one they care about; Tsukiyama lost a cherished friend and ultimate dish, Kanae lost the master he deeply revered. And to top it off he has to make the decision of leaving the Tsukiyama family or stay and serve but risk getting the family caught by CCG.  When they said Matsumae was out ""harvesting"" I guess they meant she was looking for food. I wonder if she will make it out alive, CCG was really efficient this time to be able to get the jump on Roze this fast. The Qs haven't even shown up so perhaps the Roze case will not end this fast. Previously they couldn't even put a dent on Matsumae's kagune wall (I guess they didn't try very hard though) but Ihei's quinque easily sliced through, I wonder why? A special characteristic of the quinque?  Also, Furuta is the guy Touka mistook for Kaneki when she went to Kamii. Now the question is, was he a legit student there or was he investigating something...  Haise visiting Uta means he wants to know more about Kaneki, yet to Hinami he declares that he has no intention of being Kaneki. I wonder if he's only trying to learn more for self preservation or is simply curious. But of all people, Uta is not a very good person to consult. While we have no proof that Uta has ever lied to Kaneki we also know he has ulterior motives and may be spinning stories that serve his purpose. And since Haise (and Kaneki) is so naive..."
TokyoGhoul,3c5abu,oredaore,7,Sun Jul 5 09:13:24 2015 UTC,"So Matsumae and her friends are gonners right? Somone's got to die to show us that Kijima and Ihei are dangerous.  Also Kanae deserves some kind of Nanny of the year award, making sure Shuu has his meals and doesn't act up."

TokyoGhoul,3c5abu,joulito,10,Sun Jul 5 01:01:19 2015 UTC,"Man Uta really gives no fucks when it comes to his Kakugan.   He either didn't bother hiding it because 1- he knew who was coming and feels in control of the situation. Of course Haise would eventually seek him out knowing where the mask came from HySy.  2- Heavy body mods such as his are fairly rare in Japan and it could easily pass as something he did to himself, especially in the context of his weird little shop.   Seeing Tsukiyama pre-Gourmet days is really making me like him more as a person. Before it seemed like he was really cold and loosened up during his time in Kaneki's group, but seeing him having fun with Kanae and Chie and messing around in the rain really shows that he had people who cared for him in his private life. It's sad to see the impact Kaneki's death had on his health. They probably feed him a lot but he looks starving. He just needs a lil' Kaneki in his life. :(   If Kirijima and co. fuck up Matsumae and take her into custody this fight could be the catalyst for Haise  eventually meeting up with Tsukiyama.   I won't even try to predict what Haise's intentions are. Fucking Ishida and his cliffhangers, man. I'm a tsundere for Uta's character tbh, I can't wait until next week."

TokyoGhoul,3c5abu,sugatooth,3,Sun Jul 5 01:30:00 2015 UTC,FOR UTA TO ANSWER THE DOOR WITH HIS GHOUL EYES..!!!  I feel like he's gonna have some realtalk with Haise coming right up.
TokyoGhoul,3c5abu,Thatcoolguy1135,3,Sun Jul 5 02:58:37 2015 UTC,Interesting chapter so apparently shuu is looking a lot different. He's looks emaciated in his face but his arms look weird almost disproportionate to his body. And it looks like Ihei and the investigators got a lead on the rosewalds by capturing a few members which should lead them to the mansion. The most profound thing though is the ending where Haise walks into uta's mask shop and uta just right off the bat reveals his kakugan. This will probably lead to a conversation between haise and him. In chapter 31.5 haise recieves his old mask and it is revealed that the book and mask were sent by uta's studie hysy in the note that came with the mask. I guess haise investigated the name and got an address.   Thing is he's already in deep he got a note and a book with his original name in it and didn't say anything about it. Just because he knows uta is a ghoul he can't report it without having to tell his story of why he went to the studio. The ccg will get suspicious if he snooping around his old identity.  I wonder what they will say to one another. A part of me hopes that uta would become kaneki's teacher in how to use his kakuja. I think that would be really cool if at some point in the manga that happened. I know a lot of tg fans go nuts over uta.
TokyoGhoul,3c5abu,oredaore,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:52:41 2015 UTC,"Tsukiyama looks emaciated, which would be natural for someone who won't eat out of being depressed, but the way his hands are drawn makes them look like they are swelled or even fat.

TokyoGhoul,3c5abu,Thatcoolguy1135,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:27:41 2015 UTC,yeah the swelling thing I wonder if that has to do with his transformation into a kakuja. His family according to his dad aren't typical kakujas because of inbreeding they don't control it as well. It's kind of weird that the rest of him is skinny and now his arms look weird. I wonder how strong he is though now as a kakuja and considering he is eating again.
TokyoGhoul,3c5abu,Flananigans151,2,Sun Jul 5 10:51:00 2015 UTC,"In terms of straight up strength he's probably just a strong as he looks judging from how easily they were able to hold him down and keep his mouth open.

TokyoGhoul,3c5abu,oredaore,12,Sun Jul 5 05:07:07 2015 UTC,"""The family is in your hands now"" is an overly dramatized translation. What he really says there in the raw equates to ""please keep up the good work""."
TokyoGhoul,3c5abu,ImAnAppleBiteMe,3,Sun Jul 5 09:16:33 2015 UTC,"Tsukiyama is becoming a kakuja. The problem is that because of his pure, royal ghoul blood, becoming a kakuja takes longer and is harder for him. So his kakuja kagune takes over and runs rampant and he can't do a damn thing about it.   The fact that he can't handle his kagune insanity and that he is still depressed because he can't satisfy his tastes leaves him incapacitated. So he is saying that kanae has to take care of everyone because kanae is a strong fighter and he himself can't do it at the moment.  TL;DR no he isn't dying, he is going kakuja insane. He meant kanae should take care of everyone since he can't anymore."
TokyoGhoul,3c5abu,oredaore,4,Sun Jul 5 07:32:25 2015 UTC,"Tsukiyama becoming kakuja is debatable. His father outright says it's impossible for the Tsukiyama bloodline, and that his foul eating habits will end up ruining him (if he continues to consume ghouls, and being so picky with his food so as to starve if he can't eat anything worthwhile). What's confusing is the comment Mirumo makes about how it would be a good thing if Tsukiyama could become a kakuja (since he is consuming ghouls anyway), but it's never stated anywhere or by Tsukiyama himself that his intention is to become a kakuja."

TokyoGhoul,3c6793,DontWorryYuri,11,Sun Jul 5 05:22:57 2015 UTC,"posted this comment on the vid earlier but ill just drop it here too,  sorry gonna have to break ur 103 chapters theory. the first chapter is actually called ''born'' not bone, every chapter so far has a specific name that has a different meaning if you put ''RE'' before it. chapter 1 is called born, add RE to it: ''reborn''. this is for every chapter, though the words can be interpreted as you want to. but every chapter is a word that you can put RE before it. i think last chapter was something called shape, add re to it, reshape/reshaped. this has been going on since re started ;) imperialscans probably doesn know about it yet and uses a literal translation, wich is not bad i mean knowing ishida theres probably multiple meanings to chapter names so it could still be helpful. (there was a big tumblr post about this with all the chapter names with ''re'' added to it and stuff i really cant find it if someone finds it link it as a response to this comment)(4th time editing this comment lol, scuse me, it is not for every chapter. but for alot of chapters the RE before the word thing is correct)  I still think :re will end at volume 8 with kaneki regaining all his memories in volume 7. (read tarot card 20 wich is what volume 7 will be all about) https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fqsUoWwlLm0ineOAzAQrpW7BHqPvPi3NgdzMBDjpIGs/edit and after that a 3rd part of Tokyo Ghoul starts. or it just continues. because at the end of the fools yourney it does say ''This cycle is over, but, the Fool will never stop growing. Soon he will be ready to begin a new journey that will lead him to ever greater levels of understanding.'' http://www.learntarot.com/journey.htm"

TokyoGhoul,3c6793,balamory,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:16:18 2015 UTC,"Though I agree the Tarot card theory, the first chapter is indeed bone. Here is the raw.  骨 is the title, pronounced hoe-ne (ほね) typically, which translates to bone or skeleton. As for the re: pattern look here at dooder39's comment. Rehone  is to make something new again, or to reborn which sounds like rebone.  edit: re: pattern"

TokyoGhoul,3c5vpu,MacawsInMacau,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:56:06 2015 UTC,"I always took it as an alternate/hidden meaning. Some of Urie's lines come off to me as what he's thinking while he says other things out loud or being muttered quietly so people don't hear.   I'm fairly sure scanlators are mostly preserving the format (phrases are written out side by side in some cases, or are in parenthese in others) ...as an example, :Re 12 here has Kanae's German actually written out with the transliteration above and a translation in parentheses below. On the next page he yells ""Scheisse"" though and that one has only a transliteration w/o the translation, so different lines might vary. An example of Urie's lines in parentheses. Here is one of the last pages in TG, you can see how it just has the word ""Anteiku"" right beside ""our place""."
TokyoGhoul,3c5vpu,csmslt,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:47:43 2015 UTC,With Urie it's usually what he's actually thinking at the time. He'll say something but be thinking completely different. A really good example of this is at the promotion ceremony when Iwao was touching him.

TokyoGhoul,3c3frf,danielson666,9,Sat Jul 4 11:37:03 2015 UTC,"There's been no word on season 3 however due to the poor reception of season 2 I highly doubt we'll see a season 3 hopefully we get a remake by a better studio in the future OR studio P to do season 2 staying true to the manga (Much rather a remake Studio P are terrible).   Tokyo Ghoul Jack is airing soon which is Arima in his early years.   I highly suggest reading the manga from chapter 1 as although season 1 sort of stays to the manga they change the order + miss out huge amounts of information.  Tokyo Ghoul Root A (Season 2) was a complete alternate version of events and is not canon. Barely anything in season 2 stays true to the manga and Kaneki as character is completely changed, they miss complete interesting arcs + lose all his development in the anime.   http://twistedhelscans.com/series/tokyo_ghoul/   Once you're finished Tokyo Ghoul RE is currently 35 chapters in and it's the sequel to Tokyo Ghoul"
TokyoGhoul,3c3frf,TG_Juuzou,6,Sat Jul 4 12:00:49 2015 UTC,No and many don't want one.   If possible a remake with a different studio would make it 100 x better.
TokyoGhoul,3c3frf,gg_tfti,3,Sat Jul 4 18:29:58 2015 UTC,No word for season 3 as of now. I don't even think we'll get one since Root A was a mess. The watchers won't be able to comprehend the story if ever.
TokyoGhoul,3c3frf,AceMan117,3,Sat Jul 4 11:51:44 2015 UTC,"No word on season 3, and it's pretty unlikely given how much they left out and changed in the anime. The anime was a what-if version of the story, you need to the read the manga to follow the actual story. Even if you don't normally like reading manga, give it a shot. It's worth it, and far better than the anime version.  Copying and pasting this comment of mine from another thread. Basically here's the reading order:  Tokyo Ghoul (chapters 1 to 143): http://bato.to/read/_/67864/tokyo-ghoul_v1_ch1_by_lazy-ass-scans  Tokyo Ghoul:JACK (since you've watched the anime, you can also read this first if you want to view everything chronologically): http://bato.to/read/_/269972/tokyo-ghoul-jack_v1_ch1_by_kawa-scans  Tokyo Ghoul:JOKER: http://bato.to/read/_/257690/tokyo-ghoul_by_twisted-hel-scans  Tokyo Ghoul:re (absolutely essential to read after the first manga, no matter what you think of the first manga's ending): http://imperialscans.com/read/tokyo-ghoul-re/1-bone/1  JACK and JOKER are optional, and can be read even after you catch up to :re. Despite JOKER taking place in between the first manga and :re, it was actually released around halfway through the first manga. Most people assumed it was non-canon, but it turns out it actually takes place after the first manga. Since it does contain minor spoilers, read it only after finishing the first manga. JACK actually has a different style from the regular manga.  Another bit of content you can read for fun is the Tokyo Ghoul ONESHOT. It's essentially the prototype for Tokyo Ghoul, the early version the author drew before doing the actual series we know. It's completely non-canon, but interesting to see. You can read it whenever you want: http://bato.to/read/_/278968/tokyo-ghoul-oneshot_by_kawa-scans  DO NOT TRY TO READ :RE WITHOUT READING THE FIRST MANGA. The anime was a what-if version of events, so you'll be missing a huge portion of the story and will misunderstand several things if you rely on the anime. The manga's version of the story is much better than the anime's. Don't skip even early manga chapters either, since a lot of what the anime cut out is important throughout the series."

I think it should be read WITH TG but I feel, still, that it could be read alone. Try to re-read the first few chapters. It seems as if it could be a single story. MC is a CCG investigator and has these flash backs and crazy alter ego that he is battling. Who is it and why? I feel the readers will learn of it and its significance just as Haise will. I'm pretty sure Ishida will show that, but I could be wrong.  Also, it's outdated because it's 5 months old? It's not as if the information from that post changed right?"

For those who have no idea about the story, nearly all of it will go right over their heads.

TokyoGhoul,3buero,Slyric_,3,Thu Jul 2 06:35:04 2015 UTC,"yea, i've heard some stuff like that, but i didn't know root A was that out of it. i still enjoyed watching it, being completely oblivious to the manga, but there's a lot of unanswered stuff that i want to know about, which is why i gotta start reading lol"
TokyoGhoul,3buero,brandong567,3,Thu Jul 2 08:12:19 2015 UTC,Honestly watching the anime first was prolly the way to go. If you went the manga route first you most likely wouldn't have enjoyed the anime as much ay all.
TokyoGhoul,3buero,Justyouraveragefan,4,Thu Jul 2 23:16:59 2015 UTC,"This. I watched the anime, fell in love with it. It convinced me to read the manga. I LOVED WITH IT EVEN MORE."
TokyoGhoul,3buero,TheMikarin,7,Fri Jul 3 04:35:23 2015 UTC,"Just read the manga from chapter 1.   Read it here: http://bato.to/read/_/67864/tokyo-ghoul_v1_ch1_by_lazy-ass-scans  Don't skip chapters, since it will be harder to follow the story, and you'll miss some important information. The anime left out quite a few important bits. It doesn't take long to read from the beginning, so don't worry too much about that.  You'll actually understand Root A much more once you've read the manga. The anime was written as a what-if story, so reading the manga is sort of essential to fully understanding it.   The manga's sequel Tokyo Ghoul:re is currently ongoing, read it only after reading all of the original manga (and you will need to read it, since it's a continuation of the first manga's story). The anime had some major story changes and removed some major plot points, so you can't jump into reading the sequel after the anime. The removal of plot points and these changes also make it much less likely for the anime to continue.   Explaining Root A's ending without spoiling is difficult. There's a lot that was changed from the manga, and the rest was vague enough that it could be the same as the manga or entirely different. The manga's ending is much better though, and sets up the sequel manga nicely.   Basically, just read the manga and you'll get some answers to most of your questions. You can pretty much ignore the anime's version of events when it comes to following the story, since it was just a what-if version of the story, and just a nice supplement to the manga."
TokyoGhoul,3buero,seiferfury,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:00:06 2015 UTC,thanks for the link! so should i read from the original tokyo ghoul and read straight forward? there isn't any jumping around i need to do right?
TokyoGhoul,3buero,TheMikarin,3,Thu Jul 2 08:13:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, as said by others they left quite a bit of information (even a whole arc) and changed some scenes here and there. We cannot tell those changed/deleted scenes because it obviously will spoil your experience."
TokyoGhoul,3buero,staticccc,2,Thu Jul 2 09:18:39 2015 UTC,"After reading all 143 chapters of the original Tokyo Ghoul, you can read Tokyo Ghoul:JACK (a prequel spin-off) if you feel like, and Tokyo Ghoul:JOKER (a single chapter) which takes place between the first manga and :re. Both aren't necessarily essential to read, but they do give a bit more insight to certain characters. JACK is getting an OVA episode soon, but you might still want to read the manga version since the anime has a tendency to change and omit details.  Basically here's the reading order:   Tokyo Ghoul (chapters 1 to 143): http://bato.to/read/_/67864/tokyo-ghoul_v1_ch1_by_lazy-ass-scans Tokyo Ghoul:JACK (since you've watched the anime, you can also read this first if you want to view everything chronologically): http://bato.to/read/_/269972/tokyo-ghoul-jack_v1_ch1_by_kawa-scans Tokyo Ghoul:JOKER: http://bato.to/read/_/257690/tokyo-ghoul_by_twisted-hel-scans Tokyo Ghoul:re (absolutely essential to read after the first manga, no matter what you think of the first manga's ending): http://imperialscans.com/read/tokyo-ghoul-re/1-bone/1   JACK and JOKER are optional, and can be read even after you catch up to :re. Despite JOKER taking place in between the first manga and :re, it was actually released around halfway through the first manga. Most people assumed it was non-canon, but it turns out it actually takes place after the first manga. Since it does contain minor spoilers, read it only after finishing the first manga. JACK actually has a different style from the regular manga.  Another bit of content you can read for fun is the Tokyo Ghoul ONESHOT. It's essentially the prototype for Tokyo Ghoul, the early version the author drew before doing the actual series we know. It's completely non-canon, but interesting to see.

TokyoGhoul,3bswf3,Edadinasni,10,Wed Jul 1 23:50:36 2015 UTC,"I hate doing this but...THIS. So much this. The whole point of Root A and this huge change was Kaneki joins Aogiri. Great. Wait...not so great because nothing fucking comes of it. They literally got to the same place the manga ends (albeit differently) and nothing comes of him joining Aogiri. No fight with someone from Anteiku or something that is mad at him, nothing. Nothing came of it. I figured once Tsukiyama and Banjo and co. went to save him it would transition into the manga plot of Kaneki joining up with them but nothing also came of that. Let's not forget Tsukiyama and Kaneki meeting being utterly pointless on the rooftop because there was no development with their relationship."
TokyoGhoul,3bswf3,DrRad,21,Thu Jul 2 01:49:34 2015 UTC,My ideal Root A would follow Ishida's draft more closely.

TokyoGhoul,3boxth,hazeissmart,2,Thu Jul 2 13:52:34 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, and I think that ""Phoenix"" has a better ring to it than ""Centipede"" ;D"
TokyoGhoul,3boxth,Saliber,8,Wed Jul 1 14:59:38 2015 UTC,But 'Kanekipede' sounds great! Now what shall we call it?
TokyoGhoul,3boxth,Nidies,7,Wed Jul 1 01:37:58 2015 UTC,Phoeniken? Phoeneki?
TokyoGhoul,3boxth,talae_ni,5,Wed Jul 1 08:59:17 2015 UTC,"Phoen-aise, haisenix, sasakix, phoenasake, bird man attorney at law"
TokyoGhoul,3boxth,hyphenated_guy,2,Wed Jul 1 12:46:01 2015 UTC,"Woah, that's really nice. I haven't seen anything like your theory, and i think it's pretty plausible. I wonder how would be a phoenix kakuja lol"
TokyoGhoul,3boxth,another_bruce,2,Wed Jul 1 18:26:25 2015 UTC,"It may be too late to post this, but I've just checked in with a German friend about the story that the ""egg is the world"" quote is from. She told me that the idea of the Phoenix in the story was that the Phoenix had to be both good and evil, and that God himself has to include both the good and bad qualities of man. ""God's name is Abraxas."" She said that ""Abraxas"" is both a good and bad god, and that the story itself is seen as anti-christian over there."
TokyoGhoul,3boxth,fagnerd,2,Wed Jul 1 02:32:35 2015 UTC,"With all this evidence, I am astonished by how amazing Ishida is doing this."
TokyoGhoul,3boxth,connor_wainn,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:21:51 2015 UTC,"I had always suspected that this might be the case, even without reading other people's theories on it - but this is super in depth and really well thought out with lots of evidence to back it up. Additionally, I really enjoyed reading the tumblr post about the Phoenix.   I think that if Kaneki/Haise's could link back to a phoenix after Kaneki get's his memories back. Its said that ""After death it rises gloriously from the ashes and flies away."" Since Haise is another word for ""ash"" (supposedly), which is the middle ground for the rebirthing process, the new Kaneki would be considered the phoenix, and would be reflected in the look of his Kagune then (at least I hope - I mean, its already slightly happening now....)   Man, Ishida is really blowing my mind."

TokyoGhoul,3bonc1,JessieMulay,12,Tue Jun 30 22:08:07 2015 UTC,"匂いはキライじゃない.   ""(I) don't hate the smell"". As in Touka doesn't hate the smell of the apples.  The hashtag just says it is Touka's birthday."
TokyoGhoul,3bonc1,S013,9,Wed Jul 1 00:23:47 2015 UTC,"Is it possible that ghouls' tongues makes everything taste horrible but their noses are unaffected? Tsukiyama and Kanae love to sniff roses and now Touka likes the scent of apples...  Won't that suck even more, to be able to smell delicious things only for them to taste nasty."
TokyoGhoul,3bonc1,oredaore,3,Wed Jul 1 02:21:24 2015 UTC,I don't know if roses are tasty either way
TokyoGhoul,3bonc1,sora677,2,Wed Jul 1 07:38:31 2015 UTC,Rose jam is really good though.
TokyoGhoul,3bonc1,konart,8,Wed Jul 1 09:51:08 2015 UTC,Brain jam is even better.

TokyoGhoul,3borcw,Trackmania,7,Tue Jun 30 22:38:15 2015 UTC,"way better than the others ones posted on this  sub, only complaint is you should make the white background to the very left of  the image the same color as  the offwhite behind kaneki cuz it looks weird being such a sharp line there"
TokyoGhoul,3borcw,HazelnutSpread,3,Tue Jun 30 23:00:25 2015 UTC,"Alright, I've done it but imo it looks a bit weird looking at the picture as a whole. There is a lot of white and then at the left it's all dark. But that's just my opinion eh :P http://i.imgur.com/SJCQlTb.png"
TokyoGhoul,3borcw,JessieMulay,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:42:24 2015 UTC,I didn't forget to save a .psd this time so let me switch the background there to black and let me know what you think of it then :)
TokyoGhoul,3borcw,IdRatherBeLurking,6,Wed Jul 1 10:09:04 2015 UTC,I actually love it
TokyoGhoul,3borcw,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Tue Jun 30 22:55:55 2015 UTC,"That's well done. Personally, I like how the mods have kept Tokyo in the theme. Some of my favorite panels are when Ishida draws the city."
TokyoGhoul,3borcw,BaloohGN,2,Wed Jul 1 15:13:35 2015 UTC,"I though about making it so that kaneki has a bit of tokyo behind him but scrapped it later on, I could still try if you'd like to see what that would look like"
TokyoGhoul,3borcw,theoldwisemen,2,Wed Jul 1 15:20:11 2015 UTC,Do whatever you feel like! I was just adding my two cents.
