And we wouldn't want to invite people to the crew if we knew they wouldn't have the best possible time playing games.   It's sad for ps3/4 users, but I kinda understand the way he's thinking.

It will weed out the players that joined the crew but haven't played with us since joining. Also, separating the XB & PC crews will help us organize. I think we should create new subreddits for each crew platform as well. The new subreddits for REBLXB & REBLPC would be used for XB or PC specific posts respectively. While r/TheRedditRebels, the main sub, should be used for non-specific or Crew-wide posts. Just my 2 cents, though.  I sent a request to be invited to the new crew, REBL PC, through Social Club, Magnar. Hope that helps you expedite the process."

I submitted an invite request to join the MC clan via social club.  Is this something that is only processed after a playlist win, or is this something necessary to join in the festivities tonight?  Second question, i prefer rocket bikes.  Do i need leathers and a hog to ride with the MC or will you accept your less-manly brethren? -EDIT- btw, my flair remains unchanged from forever ago...this is GSE 03"
TheRedditRebels,3dep7b,dtarnstrom,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:03:07 2015 UTC,"GSE! Long time no see! We pretty much ride daemons, baggers, inovations. and hexers. You can really ride whatever you prefer, but might look a little out of place for pictures. Also, to be in the MC it is earned by winning a playlist. But sometimes we may have other ways to get a crew invite. Looking forward to playing with you tonight man!"

TheRedditRebels,3d0r6w,jettj12,2,Sun Jul 12 15:32:35 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't think R* has any idea how broken MP is. The solution is so bullshit simple, a five-year-old could do it: Don't do security checks client-side. If you're going to do MMO-like features, fine, but you can't do it in a P2P environment.  That makes no sense."

TheRedditRebels,3cqo4v,Greg2727,2,Fri Jul 10 00:19:31 2015 UTC,"Time to bore you...  Originally when we started, the crew leaders and early members were all XB1 players, so naturally we became an XB1 only crew.  However, several of us also played others games on PC, so when the game was released on PC a bunch of the leaders and hosts jumped over to PC... As a result we had the people in place to allow us to accept PC members...   Since then, we've accepted XB1/PC members into the crew.    Unfortunately, at no point have we had the people here to help start up a PS3/4 or 360 crew...   We could easily allow PS3/4 members into the crew anyway, however with nobody to organise events and hosts games, it wouldn't be a lot of fun for the PS members... And we wouldn't want to invite people to the crew if we knew they wouldn't have the best possible time playing games.  That's why we've stayed exclusive to PC/XB1.    We have been exploring our options, as we'd love to have a PS4 crew... However at this point in time we don't have the people or anything in place.  Hopefully this will change soon."
TheRedditRebels,3cqo4v,Pulchy,3,Fri Jul 10 00:39:59 2015 UTC,"Cool! Thanks for the explanation I really appreciate it. I found the reddit rebels recently while looking for active and chill gta online crews for the ps4 and I saw this community and looked through the post and it looked like exactly what I wanted, then I saw it was xbox one and Pc only and I was pretty sad. Oh well though, I understand it's really hard to start a ps4 section of a crew that's been xbox one only for so long, because  the only people that come here don't have ps4's so who would be the audience right? Again thanks for taking time to explain, I appreciate it. If you guys ever add a ps4 section to the community I'd be glad to join!"
TheRedditRebels,3cqo4v,Juissismi,3,Fri Jul 10 00:49:53 2015 UTC,If we do open up a PS4 crew we'll definitely be making some noise about it!  I'll send you a message if anything happens =]

TheRedditRebels,3cljrx,Pulchy,2,Wed Jul 8 21:51:26 2015 UTC,That looks absolutely fantastic!
TheRedditRebels,3cljrx,gameratwork666,2,Thu Jul 9 02:23:06 2015 UTC,You forgot the most important thing about that bike :(.  It doesn't have a horn because it has boost which works in multiplayer as well.
TheRedditRebels,3cljrx,gameratwork666,2,Thu Jul 9 04:46:54 2015 UTC,"Holy money Batman!  Oh BTW, how does one get so much freakin' money?"
TheRedditRebels,3ck1l1,MagnarHD,2,Wed Jul 8 14:53:30 2015 UTC,hnnng I need that Rally Fighter
TheRedditRebels,3ck1l1,tangiblesunshine,3,Wed Jul 8 19:42:40 2015 UTC,I love the looks and the speed is good but the thing CANNOT STOP TO SAVE YOUR LIFE (which sometimes stopping does do).
TheRedditRebels,3ck1l1,venrod,2,Wed Jul 8 20:27:54 2015 UTC,I love my tricked out Panto despite its extreme shortcomings (and quite possibly because of them); I'm hoping the Brawler's imperfections will only add to its personality.
TheRedditRebels,3ck1l1,tangiblesunshine,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:12:15 2015 UTC,Yup.... I rock the Stirling 90% of the time despite RWD because of style points.
TheRedditRebels,3ck1l1,venrod,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:18:14 2015 UTC,Christ and ive been playing civ all day...time to go waste some money
TheRedditRebels,3ck1l1,localstoner,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:52:13 2015 UTC,I bought everything...  I'm not even ashamed of it.
TheRedditRebels,3ck1l1,DomCaboose,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:09:07 2015 UTC,This has had so many issues with the heists today though where we never had any issues before.  It is really getting annoying.
TheRedditRebels,3cjuxs,HTGeorge10,3,Wed Jul 8 14:00:03 2015 UTC,This is awesome - hope to see more content like this on the sub!
TheRedditRebels,3cjuxs,RebelLeader785,2,Wed Jul 8 18:54:02 2015 UTC,"For sure I am getting it when I get home tonight, looks awesome"
TheRedditRebels,3cjuxs,The_Dogg,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:35:42 2015 UTC,I've had a lot of fun today with it.
TheRedditRebels,3cjuxs,Just_some_n00b,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:36:42 2015 UTC,Need to make like 300k tonight cause I'm so getting one of these!
TheRedditRebels,3cjuxs,chetoflep,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:28:28 2015 UTC,"Drove it for 10 mins this morning before work, it's a joy, and it's much higher than I expected it to be which is awesome!"
TheRedditRebels,3cjuxs,Hockey868,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:32:34 2015 UTC,I have some issues with rocks that my Mesa just rolls over but the grip it has is insane.
TheRedditRebels,3cjuxs,andersleet,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:41:12 2015 UTC,"Looks sweet! Too bad steam won't recognize that I do, in fact, have GTA installed already.  13 hours to go."
TheRedditRebels,3cjuxs,zedie,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:17:00 2015 UTC,Looks badass! Is it electric like the Coil Voltic?
TheRedditRebels,3cjuxs,zedie,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:20:58 2015 UTC,"no, it's gas powered apparently, basically a direct copy of Rally Fighter."
