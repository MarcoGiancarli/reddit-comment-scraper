lowpoly,3deg6f,TriadPwn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:30:36 2015 UTC,The pink background was just a backdrop placed behind the character far enough away to not have shadows cast on it. The shadows where through a mixture of ambient occlusion and an area light. The ambient occlusion really helped make the image vibrant and a good sized area light brought in the nice soft shadows.

lowpoly,3c7vk1,rdvl97,2,Sun Jul 5 21:04:11 2015 UTC,Blender has a papercraft plugin that will make a net for you.
lowpoly,3c7vk1,spockish,2,Mon Jul 6 05:36:23 2015 UTC,"Here's how to do it for free:  The easiest way would be to find a 3D model that you like from Thingiverse, grabCAD, 123d app gallery, or wherever. Look for files that end in .stl or .obj. Alternatively, you can design something yourself. TinkerCAD and Sketchup are both free and very, very easy to use. This also means that they have limited capabilities, but if you just want to make shapes like these, that isn't really an issue.  After you have a 3D model, install 123D Make. Import your model and under construction technique, select ""folded panels"". There are plenty of joint types to choose from. You probably want ""diamond"", but that's up to you. Under ""get plans"" click the page icon. At the bottom of the screen, export/print as a PDF.  Print it out on your printer, and cut along the outside lines. Fold along the dotted lines.  Good luck! And if you have any questions, PM me or I can make an Instructable.    Edit: Made a ~1 hour from 3d design to finish version from a single 8.5x11 sheet of paper. This prototype is severely simplified from the one posted, but the basic techniques are there: http://www.instructables.com/id/Introduction-to-low-poly-papercraft/  Good luck!"

lowpoly,3bn50o,PresidentPark,3,Tue Jun 30 15:41:59 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I'm just an average /r/lowpoly Joe here. By no means am I contributor here, and my opinions come straight from a guy who just looks at the pretty pictures.  Now, I think the water looks pretty great right now. Your work makes it look like there are waves and depth to it, which is something I don't always come across on this sub.  I also think the flower pot looks nice. If I had any criticism on that, I'd say to make the colors pop a little bit or make it a little larger (on mobile so my opinion may just be ignorant). By that, I mean the colors of the flower pot and dock are too similar in my opinion. Perhaps you could add more flowers to cover the pot a little? I like the solemn idea of a lonely little flower, too. I'm a bit conflicted on that now.  However, the dock is a little too ""real life"" looking to me. Don't know how large this scene is going to be or what the focal point of it will be, but if it's the dock, I'd attempt to render it a little more lowpoly looking, if that makes any sense. Right now, it grabs my attention a little too quickly and aggressively. I do like what you did with the imperfect design of the wood of the dock, though.  Don't be mistaken, this is a wonderful start!  My opinions TL;DR-Dock looks too much like real life, less like lowpoly. Water is nice. Flower pot is a solid addition, don't know if the color execution was flawless.  EDIT: I think you could play around with the idea of a single flower on some driftwood. Like a little less wood than right now, but still capturing the ""hopelessness"" of the flower, if you will."
lowpoly,3bn50o,nickdewey,3,Tue Jun 30 19:01:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!  I think the problem with the planks is that they don't contrast too well with the water. But I'm really not sure how to get them looking a bit more simple, 'cause they're literally just some long wonky cubes. But I'll play around and see what I can do.  I'll probably have less planks -maybe some floating around at different angles in the water- and mess about with the plant pot some more. I kinda just plopped that in there so it was a bit more varied.  But I'm glad you like it so far, thanks a lot!"

lowpoly,39oj8d,FonderPrism,1 point,Sun Jun 14 11:12:06 2015 UTC,Hmm.  It is a tilt shift effect.  Would another camera angle work better?
lowpoly,39oj8d,FonderPrism,2,Sun Jun 14 11:28:53 2015 UTC,"That's what I thought you were going for. For that effect to work you want to blur the stuff close to and far from the camera. This means that blurring the top and bottom works for many images, but not yours.   Most of the stuff in your image is at the same distance from the camera, so I think you would have to add something close to and/or far from the camera for the tilt shift effect to work.  Many 3d programs let you adjust the aperture width of the camera when rendering (at least Blender, which I know of). Try adjusting that. This is much better than applying blur after rendering, because it blurs close/distant stuff like a real lens would.  *Edit: adding a simple texture to the ground might help..?"

lowpoly,383y51,kinglooper,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:52:00 2015 UTC,is there any other game mechanics at the moment?
lowpoly,383y51,STEALTHM0UNTAIN,6,Mon Jun 1 19:11:14 2015 UTC,"You can interact with every item in the game, that's kind of the selling point also the time loop mechanic influences the dialogue options. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driwZ9SdPzc here are some sneak peaks of how you will be able to interact with different objects in the game. Also you can flush the toilet, turn on the sink, pour some cereal into a bowl etc. Also every building, fence, pole fruit stand is destructible. Check out the greenlight page, my twitter and youtube channel for more examples, but there's tons of stuff about the game that I haven't made public."

lowpoly,385k0o,Bibdy,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:21:52 2015 UTC,"One thing you can do if you really want that blockly, Virtua Fighter-esque look is to select all the polygons on your model and then clear all of the smoothing groups off of it. It causes every polygon to be lit independently of every other polygon, which is a super-cool effect."

It took me a long time to figure that one out when I started! :))  If you're looking for improvement I'd say making the top part of the planks a little brighter just for some extra difference, but that is just if you think it looks better, as of now it's a great prop! :))"

lowpoly,362pzx,Cygonaut,4,Fri May 15 16:29:15 2015 UTC,"Really cool!  As for critique, you have the same problem as most people starting 3D, and that's the importance of lighting. The colors you chose for textures are too dark and saturated, and the light is too weak for the whole scene. That's why you lose a lot of detail in the shadows.  Try placing more light sources around the scene, make them weaker and contrast the main light source. This will give you more depth, and enhance the details of your scene.  I prefer to use less saturated colors, and then use different lights to make the colors ""pop""."

I would turn the specular on each material to 0 and turn ambient occlusion on if you haven't already. Also if you add a blend sky, the background would look a little more realistic. Great work!"

A timelapse will be here, once the upload has finished: http://youtu.be/S_VDXPJIw4s  If anyone has a tip on how to easily speed up OBS (open broadcast software) recordings, let me know - right now I am messing around with framerate filter in avidemux and then reencoding.

lowpoly,35or3r,PizzaFetus,1 point,Tue May 12 07:29:10 2015 UTC,"This is looking really cool! Some feedback:   My favourite part is the city, you've done a great job with it, but all the buildings are the exact same colour. Which makes it a little boring to look at. I think you could change a couple of the buildings to a lighter or brighter colour to bring some variation and interest. The desert on the far left ends very abruptly before changing to the city scene. It's a very vertical break between the desert and the city. Many of the different biomes have abrupt vertical breaks. I think if you changed the desert break line to be a little less harsh and a little less straight up-and-down, it would add more interest to that area. Same goes with the sea/river, it's just a vertical chunk in the landscape. The water colour itself is very metallic and steel/gold looking which looks cool, but maybe it could be a bit of a brighter blue to make it more watery."
lowpoly,35or3r,drysider,1 point,Tue May 12 07:48:38 2015 UTC,Thanks! That's some great feedback. I think you hit the nail on the head with what I was thinking was wrong with the desert scene. It was feeling very empty but if I change the transition a bit I can blend it better with the next area.

I think your next step would probably be to try and increase the size of some of the polygons without losing the shape of the face. Idk if that means taking the photo at a different angle/with different light that allows for more space that is roughly the same colour? Maybe around your forehead or cheek would be a good place to try this.

lowpoly,34nb6d,mattt_damon,2,Sat May 2 21:43:45 2015 UTC,"should not have colored the guy blue, i guess :) Wasn't intended to look like sonic."
lowpoly,34nb6d,mgm961,5,Mon May 4 16:56:39 2015 UTC,"TL/DR: Trying to make a low poly browser game with blender stuff  & threejs & cannonjs  The landscape (as of now without any objects in it) is a plane with different materials and only changes in the elevation of the vertices.   (Which makes it a heightmap, which is good because I can map it to a collision heightmap in cannon.js which I plan to use for physics).  The character is a little guy I cam up with yesterday after watching hyden's cool blender videos.  It was hard to get him to animate correclty with threejs in the browser. (The exporter requires some stuff.. model needs to be in an animation where the first frame is the unmodified position and so on :) )  Right now you can control the guy with cursor or asdw - and he will allways walk on the ground. (no flying or falling through) this is done by shooting a cannon.js ray down at the heightmap.  You can see the physics working with heightfield."
lowpoly,34nb6d,mgm961,3,Sat May 2 18:59:17 2015 UTC,That's a cool concept and I hope it goes well for you but I personally don't think the color scheme is really working. It kinda strains my eyes. I feel like there's too much contrast.
lowpoly,34nb6d,Nile_LTR,3,Sun May 3 00:36:47 2015 UTC,"I have found a way to fix my colors:  Much nicer now - imho  I am stopped using a material per color, instead I UV-Mapped the ground to a minimal texture. Much easier then to find out what's off between blender and threejs with material colors. (Also this should render faster, because it just uses one material.. I guess.)"

For modelling, animation, rendering I'm using Autodesk Maya, its what I first learned with in University and its what I'm most comfortable with.

lowpoly,2wecni,silverfirexz,2,Thu Feb 19 04:51:08 2015 UTC,"Really good, very pretty and intriguing. A couple of thoughts: rocks so low to the water wouldn't usually have sharp points; the foreground point especially seemed a little odd. Also, there is an irregularity in the serpent's coloring that is very noticeably repeated: that slightly diminishes the illusion that the animal exists underneath; varying it more or regularizing it would likely fix that."

They could have simply animated it with CGI ... and they would have had to in order to create all of the frames for the 3D model. But instead of creating it out of CGI, they printed it off and filmed it in stop-motion and in doing so created the smoothest, most life-like and interesting stop-motion I've ever seen.  It reminds me of the process the guys used for ParaNorman and kind of gets me thinking about the possibilities for 3D printing in animation.

I don't know what you used to model this, but polys relates to the number of facets or 'sides' that an object has. It is easy with cubes since they can only have 6 faces, but irregular objects need to be trimmed, either by creating them with less subdivisions or by recalculating their shape with a lower polycount."

These changes essentially removed some of the fun from playing with the physics, and limited creativity (I had planned on making a bouncy path to my house filled with tricky platforming...that's not possible anymore). They also still listed on their website that the game has planetary gravity, even though that was removed months ago, so they falsely advertised features to get sales.  These alone are bad enough, but I want to go back to focusing on the devs themselves.  These are people that pretty much always had to be reminded to post patch notes whenever an update came out. If people didn't do that, they wouldn't even bother. They always talked about being able to create your own universe in early videos (they also mentioned water, which never made it into the game), but the truth is you can't make anything unless it's attached to something else first. And then when you break a huge planet off after making it, guess what? It will fall right back down, likely pushing you through the floor if you get hit. Some universe...  Considering all the problems the game had that were definitely in need of being fixed that got ignored (terrible camera, lack of information on making formations like bombs, multiple bugs with collision), I'd either say this was a scam from the start, or the dev team really is just that bad, either way, I'm not inclined to buy or recommend anything they make ever again.  Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to play multiplayer just one last time before they shut down the servers..."
