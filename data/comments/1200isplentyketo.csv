Chop one onion finely and sprinkle over bottom of pan.  Drain one can of tuna and spread over onions.  Completely cover with shredded cheese - probably about 4 cups.  Whip 4 eggs with 1-1/2 cup cream and salt & pepper.  Pour over cheese mixture.  Bake for 15 minutes; then turn down oven to 350 degrees and cook for another 30 minutes or until knife inserted in center comes out clean.  Be creative you can use any kind of veggie instead of onion, such as broccoli, spinach, peppers.  You can also use any protein instead or with the tuna."
1200isplentyketo,3dk1fa,pennyprepper,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:51:03 2015 UTC,"Hey there, I read on either this sub or 1200isplenty or progress pics that tuna can be kind of toxic to you if you eat is too much or too often. Apparently tuna accumulates mercury due to pollution, and the effects are really different on everyone (some have no symptoms from eating it as often as others who do). It's possible that it's nothing to worry about, but I suggest you read a bit on it. Before learning about this I was planning on starting to eat a lot more tuna, but have since limited myself to one can a week.   To answer your question, if you are into Korean food (including rice and seaweed) you could try making your own kimbap (sushi kind of roll) with tuna in it. This was my favourite kind of kimbap. You could also try to substitute the rice with quinoa, cauliflower rice or something more keto friendly (not sure what applies, sorry! I subscribed to this sub for recipe ideas, so please excuse any of my recommendations that are not keto)."

I guess it is a bit greasy.  recipe:  1) for the biscuit I used the Carbquik drop biscuit recipe (eg, Carbquick and water), 4 biscuits from 1 cup of mix, baked on parchment paper at 400deg until the top start to brown, about 20 min. This works out to 75cal, 2g carbs each.  2) once biscuit cools, I prefer to slice the very top off for optimal yolk absorption.  3) fry up 1 strip of Costco bacon (45 cal, trace carbs) and place on top  4) crack one lovely egg into the hot bacon grease (70 cal, trace carbs) and cook until edges are crispy  5) place the egg on top, preferably upside down, again for yolk purposes.  should work out to: 200 cals (190 but I'm gonna round up for grease that clings to the egg), ~3g carbs.

Nuts are great for snacks, just make sure you measure out portions!

If you're sticking to under 40 (which I think is a good idea) and find a relatively low carb kombucha then go for it! I also love sugar free sweetened teas and lemonades.   I am also going to recommend some bullet proof coffee. I just add a tablespoon of coconut oil to my coffee and froth it up. It does add an extra 120 calories, but you really need that fat to feel satiated. If you can spare it, give it a try. Maybe you could have only one egg on days you do a bullet proof coffee? In any case I would say add some fats to your diet because personally I'd be hungry on the food you just laid out for us. Maybe some avocado with lunch or breakfast, things like that :)"

I'm having to do once-a-week higher calorie and carb-boost days to keep my milk up, but spend most of my time in ordinary keto.   If you pump, remember that the pump isn't clearly indicative of how much milk you actually produce (baby's much better at getting it out), but changes in your pumping output can show the trend.  Please don't feel bad about acting to protect that milk supply, even if it slows down your weight loss. You're a champion at 21 months. Good work!"

1200isplentyketo,349oor,twelfthy,2,Wed Apr 29 12:22:36 2015 UTC,I do a very similar mix but I use the powdered peanut butter so the calories are much lower as well as the fat so I add a bit of butter to fatten things up.
1200isplentyketo,349oor,BoneGnawerGirl,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:39:40 2015 UTC,"i've never used the powdered stuff before, assumed it was for people trying to avoid fat. if you're mixing it up with butter, wouldn't it have similar stats to regular peanut butter?"
1200isplentyketo,349oor,BoneGnawerGirl,3,Thu Apr 30 12:29:01 2015 UTC,"Stats wise sure it comes out about the same once you add butter but the texture of the powder is amazing.  It really thickens things up and can work in ways that regular peanut butter can't.  Like I make whipped cream and then whip in some P2B and it is this crazy good peanut butter fluff where if you mix in real peanut butter it is just kind of a greasy blop.  Keto mug cakes etc (which I don't make often at all) are great with the peanut butter powder in them.  Also we add it into smoothies.  It is only 45 calories for two tablespoons of the powder, which is way more than enough to give a peanut butter taste to the chocolate protein powder we use. So it ends up being a big, filling, peanut butter cup tasting smoothie for less than 200 calories (100 from the muscle milk, 45 for the P2B, 30 for almond milk, 0 for water) which fits my macros perfectly and kills any sweet cravings.  I tried using regular peanut butter in a smoothie, and it is REALLY delicious but it is closer to 400 calories that way."

I always prefer to eat at home because I like to weigh things. Sometimes you can't do it though! I'm going on a weeklong business trip this week and I am going to default to more fast-food-esque stuff  just because I'd rather sacrifice yumminess/quality in order to be accurate with calorie counts :) Although I'm planning to walk to the local Trader Joes my first day there and stock up on nuts and premade meat and stuff if my hotel room has a mini fridge :)

1200isplentyketo,346brf,dlldp,2,Thu Apr 30 17:21:06 2015 UTC,"Good tricks that I'm hoping won't fail me on my trip (and I hope they help you!):   Ask if they can make a simple grilled chicken breast or prepare any fish grilled.  Order all items with sauce on the side (just in case when it arrives you can just TELL it's super carby, I will taste test and if it's dense/floury or sugary, I leave off) Foolproof items: Steak, burger no bun, seared ahi tuna, grilled shrimp, Caesar salad no croutons (add chicken if possible!) Don't be afraid to ask for substitutions. I was always shy but if you just ask in a friendly voice, ""Is it at all possible to substitute X veggie side/salad for these mashed potatoes/risotto/biscuits that come with my entrée? Thank you!""  If you're going to any chain restaurant, not even fast food, but like Chilis or a common steakhouse, look online ahead of time for an idea of what the menu looks like. You'd be surprised how much you can eat that's (most likely calorie-dense) but low carb if you are familiar with the menu. Don't be afraid to eat around your plate in order to avoid the higher-carb tidbits. No reason you can't pick out the green veggies and protein and leave behind anything you don't want in your body.   Good luck :)"
1200isplentyketo,346brf,lgbtqbbq,2,Thu Apr 30 17:30:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I definitely always scope out the menu ahead of time, but it's tough to estimate sauces, I'll try to ask for it on the side! I just get antsy when I can't log everything, but it's probably good for me to go on short breaks of not tracking. I'm gluten-sensitive, so that helps a bit :)"
1200isplentyketo,346brf,dlldp,2,Thu Apr 30 17:49:34 2015 UTC,What do you usually get that's low cal and low carb at Taco Bell? I was at the mall today and since the burger place is being revamped..

1200isplentyketo,346brf,somekindawonderful,2,Wed May 27 04:42:32 2015 UTC,"Ask for a bunch of sides of things, in a bowl. Super cheap.   side or two of ground beef (has some carbs from filler but nothing drastic, maybe 3 or 4 net carbs from 2 servings) side of chicken side of guac side of salsa side of sour cream side of cheese lettuce add or subtract based on preferences or calorie needs   It's like the way less tasty version of a Chipotle bowl.

I used a non stick pan, but added a tiny bit of bacon fat to saute the garlic, onion, and spinach in. I whisked 3 eggs and added a half tbsp of heavy cream, then added the spinach mixture to the eggs, beat a bit more then poured them in the heated pan. I put a lid on the pan, let the eggs firm, then flipped the egg mixture. I immediately put maybe 1/8 cup of tomato sauce, 1/4 cup of cheese, and maybe 9 pepperoni then put the lid back on, turned the heat off and let the steam melt the cheese.   My boyfriend does not like omelettes, so he really didn't like the eggs. I really enjoyed this though and it will definitely be a weekly meal for me.    half a small yellow onion (1/4 cup chopped) 2 cups roughly chopped spinach *1 tsp garlic 3 eggs 1/2 tbsp heavy cream salt pepper 1/8 cup tomato sauce 1/4 cup cheese ~10 pepperoni or toppings of choice   My brother will be making this in the morning with sausage and mushrooms, so that should be awesome as well!

1200isplentyketo,33j2ao,CumquatDangerpants,2,Fri Apr 24 01:37:20 2015 UTC,How long do you let the chia bloom and how do you prevent them from sticking together in clumps? I don't know why but mine always clump up!
1200isplentyketo,33hcgx,eairy,4,Wed Apr 22 15:07:06 2015 UTC,Chia seeds and avocados!

1200isplentyketo,33hcgx,GetMeTheJohnsonFile,4,Wed Apr 22 15:50:28 2015 UTC,"I love microwave flax bread/pizza crust. Just 4 Tb of flax meal + 1 whole egg, mixed together, spread on a plate. Microwave each side for 1 min. You have a flexible base for whatever you want to eat, with a nice protein kick too. You can let it air dry for 10-20 min if you want a stiffer, more cracker like consistency.   I either do a pizza type thing or pile on meat/veg that I'm eating that day for lunch.  Avocados are also very high in fiber. And try to incorporate leafy green veggies if you don't already. Also there's no need to get excessive fiber. It can keep you regular, but after 4 months on keto I find I have no issues even during days/weeks where I don't get fiber."
1200isplentyketo,33hcgx,lgbtqbbq,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:41:32 2015 UTC,Is that a US tablespoon or a Australian tablespoon? I just learned they are slightly different after I just could not get something to come out right despite being really careful with measurements.
1200isplentyketo,33hcgx,BoneGnawerGirl,1 point,Fri Apr 24 14:11:59 2015 UTC,"I measure in grams, because I weigh all my food. My flax seed has a serving size described in Tb and g, so I just use that for reference. Sorry I'm mobile so I can't check exactly."
1200isplentyketo,33hcgx,lgbtqbbq,1 point,Fri Apr 24 15:14:14 2015 UTC,No worries. I use grams normally too.  Just a heads up on the tablespoon size though

1200isplentyketo,33hcgx,lgbtqbbq,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:03:37 2015 UTC,Perfect thank you! I cannot wait to try the pizza crust.  Do they come out soft enough to use as a little wrap for deli meats?
1200isplentyketo,33hcgx,BoneGnawerGirl,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:19:12 2015 UTC,"Yes but after they've cooled off they're more like sandwich bread texture, pliable but not like able to be rolled really. I eat them as soon as they come out of the microwave, so they're very soft. I advise adding salt and spices because it will taste ONLY like flax, which is pretty bland :)"
1200isplentyketo,33hcgx,lgbtqbbq,3,Fri Apr 24 20:32:04 2015 UTC,"Leafy veg. Spinach, collard greens, bok choy, lettuce, etc. I allot nearly all my carbs to vegetables in order to get the fiber in. Honestly unlike a lot of /r/keto I even have to cut back on things like broccoli/cauliflower because the fiber:carb ratio just isn't high enough."
1200isplentyketo,33hcgx,binderclips,3,Wed Apr 22 16:26:01 2015 UTC,"leafy greens, cauliflower, broccoli are most of my fiber sources. I was using chia seeds for a bit, have not noticed a difference since. I take magnesium and that has seemed to sort out my regularity problem!"

I also eat lots of spinach you can eat big volumes and its low in calories and carbs and mostly fiber, asparagus is good too!"

The whole video He talks about people not knowing facts and science and then he ruins it by not knowing his facts about keto. He keeps saying ""low protein"", rather than low carb and confuses it with ketoacidosis. So disappointing. I wanted to show this to my mom, but now I can't because she'll start panicking about me poisoning myself."

1200isplentyketo,33e6t1,Jennynot,2,Wed Apr 22 10:51:07 2015 UTC,I buy at least 2 bags of broccoli slaw a week! Use it instead of salad ALL THE TIME.  I do this with canned tuna or chicken and maybe throw 3oz of avocado on there as well instead of cheese.
1200isplentyketo,33e6t1,aegault,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:51:12 2015 UTC,"I just made this today and I'm really happy with it. Sorry for the gnarly picture, it was delicious and made a really filling substantial serving.  Ingredients:  1 C broccoli slaw (I got the bagged pre cut one at Safeway)  2 cans chicken in water (approx 6.5 oz in my case, varies by can size)  2 Tb Mayo  2 wedges Laughing Cow Cheese  3 slices ham  Garlic powder/salt/pepper/seasoning to taste (I used garlic powder + Trader Joe's Everyday Seasoning + salt)  Directions   Dump broccoli slaw in large bowl Drain chicken and add to bowl, shred with fork into little flakes, combine with slaw Add mayo and Laughing Cow cheese, mix well with fork to coat slaw and chicken. Shred ham and add, stir briefly to distribute Season to taste   Macros via MyFitnessPal: calories: 499, net carbs 7, fat 28, protein 46  (I WAY overestimated the garlic powder, so those net carbs are lower)  This was 500 cal, and since I don't eat breakfast, it very comfortable fits into my 1200-1300 calorie day. The size of the portion was really big though, so I can see making less of it and having an adequate serving, or splitting into two for more than one lunch. This was easy to whip up in a few minutes and made me a happy camper this afternoon. The LC Cheese adds carbs and is pretty empty in terms of calories, but I couldn't handle more calories by adding MORE mayo. The combination gives enough creaminess but a good light flavor.  I'm already planning on making variations of this, the ease of the broccoli slaw made it an ideal workday lunch to throw together, but I can see using other veggies in the base. Adding bacon or chunks of cheese would be good. Substitute tuna for the chicken. Add spices like curry powder, add different flavors of mayo, hot sauce, etc."
