I've been in love with Touhou for 8 years and apart from big communities like shrinemaiden, mostly everywhere got boring and filled with random fanarts since 2011. Touhou is big, but vague. It's a fuel for imagination and discussion, but at the same time an axe for the very same activities. Unless you get someone that think the same thing you do, like the same pairing you do, it's impossible to keep the conversation for more than 5 minutes without getting in a fight."

touhou,3e0qef,MadoMadoMado,7,Tue Jul 21 01:48:09 2015 UTC,"Well, considering that Japan has to host a convention entirely separate from Comiket just to host all of the doujinshi dedicated to Touhou should answer how far the fan base has gone.  As for how much farther it'll go, I think it's too early to make any predictions in confidence. Touhou has barely begun its official expansion internationally, so there will definitely be new fans in the future.  But if you are referring to circles specifically, that is another story. Even with the new fans incoming, I doubt there will be a significant increase in the number of circles forming. In fact, I'm actually expecting the overall number to drop from here on out. Doujinshi is really only a Japan thing and Touhou's influence has already been spread over there. I don't want to say that this is Touhou's end game, but it kind of feels like it in regards to newer circles forming. So I wouldn't be expecting new circles to be appearing, but that doesn't mean that the older ones will be disappearing. Just remember, as long as a circle does not disband, you can always have hope that they'll go back to Touhou.  And sure, there will be fans outside of Japan that are capable of expressing similar mentalities (a large handful of members in this subreddit are proof of this), but I think the number of willing and organized fans will be spread too thin, making it difficult for them to form their own circles.  But of course, even if all of this turns out to be true, which I'm hoping it won't be, Touhou has definitely left its mark on history. Not even including the official releases, there are thousands upon thousands of musical arrangements out there, as well as a countless number of artworks and comics, and even fan-made animations and games, too. Even after Touhou reaches its peak and begins to decline, the appreciation of all of its fans, both past and present, will always been known."

touhou,3e0qef,mashibana,2,Tue Jul 21 07:09:47 2015 UTC,"They commercialized too quick, and their fans don't hype about Fantasy Kaleidoscope like we do. They will come and go quickly like all other franchises."
touhou,3e0qef,Sakuya_Lv9,2,Tue Jul 21 14:17:37 2015 UTC,"Love Live has been around for more than 5 years now, and is very likely currently at the peak of its popularity. It's main ""draw"" is that the multimedia strategy also involves actual live concerts, with the voice actresses being a very vital part to the project. Hence it is also appealing to more than just anime otaku, but also idol otaku. The project's history is interesting in its own right, too.  Kancolle is in a similar situation, with a shorter time frame and a more explosive popularity in terms of fan involvement. It is far closer to Touhou, as it is a project that combines Moe with historical elements (In this case, warships). By getting an appealing browser game + art drawn by a team of really good artists, they managed to make a product with broad appeal by, once again, engaging both anime otaku and (to some extent) military/history otaku.  Frankly, I don't think they will go as quickly as you say, but, they do have a life cycle, just like any franchise. Love Live might actually be at a turning point, as expanding the existing story with the existing cast will be impossible, and now they're going to release a new group of school idols that might or might not go well with the existing fans. Kancolle might actually last for quite a bit more, what with the PSVita game coming out, and other potential spinoff games in the works, as well as a second anime season (Which will happen).  The appeal of Touhou is a little different, though. For us, creators, it is in the inspiration: ZUN managed to create a work that inspires artists that work in multiple media, and encourages the artists to be part of a creative fan effort by allowing derivative works. Add a big community of people who enjoy the games and the derived works, and you have a fandom that, even if it diminishes, might last for longer than most people even think."
touhou,3e0qef,AnatoleSerial,4,Tue Jul 21 20:31:21 2015 UTC,How far do you think this fanbase has come?   not far enough.
touhou,3e0qef,-blank,4,Tue Jul 21 12:34:03 2015 UTC,"I think it suffers the same sickness as Vocaloid. Quoting Kouhei's theory on Vocaloid, translated from memory:   Vocaloid is on its way down now. The talents flooded out like a waterfall, and those big Ps are running out of ideas. To keep their fame they make series. But that can't last long. On the othe hand, The anime industry is using them. The fans are of those characters and not Miku herself. That leads to less Miku dancing and more original characters. The Vocaloid category on nico is now unappealing and boring. Eventually no one would remain and Vocaloid finally become a piece of musical instrument.   Touhou might be following the same path. The talents have been at it for more than a decade. ZUN is god, but are his followers gods? New faces are rare, and whoever that can remix at least has a SoundCloud. So."
touhou,3e0qef,Sakuya_Lv9,3,Tue Jul 21 05:13:45 2015 UTC,"FYI based on various estimates we hit peak Touhou long ago. As far as anyone is concerned Touhou's popularity reached its apex around the time of IaMP-PoFV. Touhou had been holding steady for a long while since then, until about UFO, but is now on a decilne because of newcomers like KanColle coming along and taking a big slice of the fandom pie. (This is based on various data and graphs and stuff I'd seen over the last 1-2 years, combining search hits, # of circles at conventions, etc.)  I wouldn't expect KanColle to keep trending and growing, but even if it doesn't, it doesn't mean Touhou will get back what it's lost over the past, I don't know, six years. There have been some series that made a dent (iDOLM@STER, Vocaloid), but ironically KanColle is the biggest ""threat"" to Touhou and is doing it by being the most similar it, just more calculated and commercialized.  There's definitely a concern with the lack of new circles coming along producing content. There are still most of the old standbys, but what happens when they grow tired of it? We've already seen it somewhat with some jumping aboard the new thing in KanColle.  Unfortunately, you see some fans bemoaning that Touhou isn't what it used to be. That the music isn't as good as it once was, the characters aren't as good as they once were, etc. Maybe this is one reason it isn't drawing enough new fans and even driving away others. Though I still like nearly everything ZUN puts out, for some reason, some characters and games and music aren't resonating like they once did.  As far as the Western fanabase is concerned, it consumes, but doesn't create as much as I would have liked to see. Doujin manga production was probably never a reality, but the number of music circles is dismal. It's all a reality of the fact that we don't really have a do-it-yourself doujin and convention culture like Japan does.  Touhou was probably always too insular to sustain growth. It's a niche game, it requires some time investment to get into, ZUN shuns advertisement and avoids whoring Touhou out the way most series' would have by now, etc. with anime and manga in major magazines, etc. Of course, it has manga, but the magazines it runs in has relatively low circulation. That doesn't make it easy to introduce potential fans to it, compared to something like KanColle which has done everything the opposite.  One shouldn't be scared, Touhou will always be around, as long as ZUN is producing content. Though he jokes about quitting, I don't see it in him. Touhou is basically his business anymore and he still has a passion for games. But even if he wasn't there would probably be fans remaining to fill the Touhou void. It's just not the big (and really, the only) fish in the pond anymore."

There just seems to be so many circles that are gone now, along with others just moving on to something else (most notably kancolle).  but who knows, maybe I'm wrong and something amazing will happen as new games are released and as more older games are released to the west."
touhou,3e0qef,ayanodesu,2,Tue Jul 21 02:32:40 2015 UTC,"As someone who frequently visits the hentai websites (You know who you are and where you've been), there's always something new to see in the porn section, and then some regular SFW yuri bits.   You don't see the new characters get much art of that matter until at least a year, and actual doujins are another year before the circle has an idea of what a Touhou's personality is like anyways.  From this perspective, I think Touhou will continue to encapsulate the minds of many for years to come. Happy 20th anniversary, Touhou Project!"

touhou,3e0qef,Entropy263,3,Tue Jul 21 03:42:35 2015 UTC,"When something gets more popular, it makes sense that more poor quality content will be produced (and maybe disproportionately), because more content is being produced in general. It doesn't mean there isn't still lots of good stuff out there too. In my experience, there's just so much content out there to begin with that I'm still finding new awesome art, music, doujins, etc pretty often.  Anyway, as far as 'tired out memeness' goes, I figure it's kind of up to us as fans to intentionally seek out and encourage originality and fresh takes on things."

touhou,3dtceh,-blank,2,Sun Jul 19 13:49:48 2015 UTC,"Me? I found out bout a year ago browsing myanimelist (Believe it or not the first character I saw was Reisen). Yes, I know ""Touhou isin't an anime. Stick a CARROT in it"", but i'm watching the fan made ones and ""Summer days dream"" is quite appealing. I love how Tewi calls Aya ""Newspaper"" instead of her name. I also like the ""Touhou sketches"" on youtube. They are done by different people with their own unique jokes (YSE) as an example."

touhou,3dtceh,Vivit_et_regnat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:20:38 2015 UTC,"Oh, certainly. I actually think the 2hus fall across a broad spectrum of huggability, with individuals like Marisa and Nitori being near the end of ""most huggable"". I imagine Reimu being somewhere closer to the middle: kind of a grumpy hug-recipient, who might let you hug her, and might even secretly appreciate the attention, but who wouldn't hug you back.  And then on the other end of the spectrum, you have people like Rumia, who might interpret a hug as an invitation to eat you.  But still, they're all huggable in that I'd love to hug every one of them, if I could get away with it."

She also has to put in effort to use magic as a human, so of course she's not zapping everything on screen.  Reimu on the other hand was pretty much born for this. To me, that makes sense with her homing amulets and tiny hitbox - annihilating youkai just comes naturally. Power wise though, she's not going to put in any more effort than she needs to."

I think Youmu is some sort of guardian angel to newbs. All the touhous where Youmu is playable are the ones hardcores say to stay away (Imperishable Night, Phantasmagoria of Flower View, Ten Desires). I dunno how she does it, but if she can cut stuff like spirits and hesitation and even people's lies, I guess that includes difficulty levels?"

touhou,3du2qf,Soundshifter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:29:13 2015 UTC,Sakuya also might be a guardian angel. Sanae is a reverse guardian angel (guardian devil?)
touhou,3du2qf,Fluffy8x,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:55:12 2015 UTC,"I said Youmu is some sort of guardian angel because the games where she is a playable character also happen to be the games that are better for newbies. But she's not an easy character to use herself, that's totally against her personality.  So with Sakuya you feel the same thing, but when Sanae shows up the games are harder? Then again she shows up at the same time as Youmu does at Ten Desires, but Youmu seems to override her woot."
