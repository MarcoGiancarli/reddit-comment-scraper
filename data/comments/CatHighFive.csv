They can be quite vocal and Min's brother is a lovely cat but his voice is awful to the point of considering a laryngectomy. Price is an issue and they quite a commitment as they very long lived.

CatHighFive,305hig,warpedbullet,8,Tue Mar 24 17:21:11 2015 UTC,"It's totally possible. I trained my roommate's two cats to do it, and they are both adult cats.  There are a few training guides in the sidebar, plus lots of good suggestions in this thread.  Basically there are two key things, no matter what method you use.   First, cats naturally like to paw at things. (See here for example.) When you are just starting out, you want to use this, and encourage them to paw at your hand.  The second important thing is whenever they do something right, give them a reward, like a treat. Then you can slowly modify their behaviour into a proper high-five. The reward has to be something they really like, otherwise you will quickly lose your cats attention."
CatHighFive,305hig,jsmooth7,5,Wed Mar 25 01:36:19 2015 UTC,"Some cats, like one of ours, is naturally sassy. If I tap her forehead she'll start high fiving me, though sometimes with claws out. Ouch."

CatHighFive,305hig,poppagrunt,2,Fri Mar 27 21:34:05 2015 UTC,"I taught my cat to wave to me when she was sitting in the window and i was outside.  i did it by starting to wave and waiting until i got a reaction from her. Typically she would lift a paw and i would immediately reward her. I kept doing it and rewarding her for getting a higher wave, etc. After time she figured out that if i wave, she should wave.  It would impress the neighbours, stopping for a chat in the yard, when i would point at my cat and wave, and have the cat wave back.  Paw shaking, waving , meowing on command, she knew many tricks.  Cats can be trained.  I tried the ""use the toilet"" trick but she wouldn't go for it."

You can youtube videos that explain it better, but basically buy a clicker, and every time you click it give the cat a treat. Once the cat learns click= treat, use it to mark behaviors that are closer and closer to what you want.  The steps I used are:   Shaking bag= treats (she learned that on her own) She doesn't get a great until she sits. Once she knows to come and sit, then  Hold treat above head. She'll naturally stand up to get it, and place both paws on hand for balance. Once she learns that, Only click for one paw, never for two, then Hand flat, treat between fingers, to get the high five look   After she means that, you can remove the rest from your fingers, and voila!

The way I did it was I held a treat in my hands so the cat knew it was there, but couldn't get it. After a while, the cat pawed at my hands. As soon as he did that I gave him the treat. I repeated this until he got the hang of it.   Next I started doing it with no treat in my hand. Then once the cat got the hang of this, I started opening my hand so the cat was doing an actual high five.  Also each repetition I would say ""Give me five!"" and I would say ""yes!"" the moment the cat did something correctly. This makes it easier for the cat to learn what they did right. (You can also use a clicker for this.)"

CatHighFive,2w2fvr,autowikibot,1 point,Fri Feb 20 14:20:56 2015 UTC,"Bicolor cat:       A bicolor cat or piebald cat has white fur combined with fur of some other color, for example black or tabby. There are various patterns of bicolor cat. These range from Van pattern (color on the crown of the head and the tail only) through to solid color with a throat locket.  Where there is low-to-medium grade white spotting limited to the face, paws, throat and chest of an otherwise black cat, they are known in the United States as a tuxedo cat. High grade bicolor results in Van-pattern cats. There are many patterns between, such as ""cap-and-saddle"", ""mask-and-mantle"" and ""magpie"" (more randomly splashed). Bicolors are found in many breeds, as well as being common in domestic longhair cats and domestic shorthair cats.  Solid color bicolor cats occur because there is a white spotting gene present along with a recessive allele of the agouti gene, which evens out the usual striped pattern of the colors of the coat. In contrast, tabby cats have an agouti gene that produces striping of the coat. The Abyssinian has agouti (ticked tabby) fur, giving the appearance of even color with color-banded hairs.
