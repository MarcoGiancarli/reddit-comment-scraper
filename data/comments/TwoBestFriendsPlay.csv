Had something to say, and was afraid that I might lose it if I waited.    Woolie, I'm pretty sure that you kinda messed up in Odin Sphere. At the end, before the Book of Armageddon, you are allowed to go back to the other characters and grind them up. You just got to pick up one of the other books that feature said character. The game doesn't tell you this, if I recall, so I don't fault you all that much(gonna highlight this with bold, as I don't want to come off as being a huge jerk). It's also a bit tedious, as you need to replay the story modes(though you keep your levels, and most bosses shouldn't pose a threat anymore).     The game is also skill based, so technically you don't need to level up to beat the bosses. They're just super hard if you don't. I mean, I do hope they fix that. Like, drop you off before the final boss of each character's book rather than replay the game.     Super hyped for the remaster though. It has all the stuff I want from a remaster, from what I'm seeing in the trailer. The purists should be happy that the original version of the game, if the changes are not satisfactory for them."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,Ckarasu,2,Tue Jul 21 08:14:22 2015 UTC,"The game doesn't tell you, but it doesn't stop you from picking up the other books. It's not like the books get deleted from the game world."

I wanted a PS4 game from Vanillaware but there is no way I'm spending money on this fairy ass furry game. I wanted Samurai or DnD or even something new and I got this shit. I am bummed as hell.

Your statement proves you have no idea what the game is about at all. I, and quite a few others, wanted this quite a bit. Odin Sphere is a good game, but definitely needed some improvements(which this will have).    Muramasa was already rereleased on the Vita, and Dragon's Crown doesn't really need a sequel yet."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,Ckarasu,-21,Tue Jul 21 10:06:05 2015 UTC,Muramasa was rereleased on the shitty ass Vita. And I'm sorry that I'm not as hype for your furry fairy game as you and the other twelve year old girls. Literally anything would've been better.

TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,TheBazBlue,24,Tue Jul 21 18:48:20 2015 UTC,Liam that wasn't Hungrybox who threw his medal into the crowd it was Mango because he didn't get 3vo and was super salty that Hungrybox beat him.

TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,Fried_puri,11,Tue Jul 21 16:48:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right that it was Mango that threw his 5th place medal into the crowd. IIRC he really wanted to win this Evo this year for personal reasons, and he was salty that he didn't get his win. Some Smash redditors have concluded that he would rather not keep the medal to remind him of his failure. And the whole act fits his personality in general.  Hungrybox was as miffed as Liam was when Mango threw his medal to the crowd."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,ZennyOne,3,Tue Jul 21 11:04:14 2015 UTC,"tbh it's what i'd expect from mango, he played his heart out to get a threepeat and didn't even get top 3. it's a huge upset and ""if you're not first, you're last"" is mango's mentality. it's why he's considered a god of melee, and it's why he was among the first to get sponsored."

TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,ikenjake,24,Tue Jul 21 16:57:20 2015 UTC,"Man the argument about stages in EVO by comparing them to real sports is so weird.  Yes Woolie, you can change the color of a tennis court. Not to bright pink, but there's like 10-16 standard colors for both the inner and outer court. A hockey rink is different from game to game. NFL and NHL videogames have those different stages as options. It might not be an obvious difference but at least it's not the same inside of a 3D modelling tutorial every god damn time like the Street Fighter training stage."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,IcarusCDN,10,Tue Jul 21 12:01:35 2015 UTC,"Exactly. At any given time, at any major stadium, there's probably 30-50 ads of varying size, color, and animation going on in front of the players. You don't hear them complaining about it."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,Djinn_n_Tonic,4,Tue Jul 21 15:28:52 2015 UTC,Not to mention that huge amount of body painted fans.
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,cdstephens,3,Tue Jul 21 17:50:11 2015 UTC,"But they're not directly on the field in the player's FOV. Imagine playing tennis and the court periodically flashes holograms while you play.  And as far as tennis goes, the players do complain about noise and distractions. You're not even allowed to enter the stadium seating until there's a break in the action."

TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,GameBoy09,21,Tue Jul 21 10:22:53 2015 UTC,"I think that trying to look out and make sure that players are as comfortable as possible is a noble outlook and needed overall.  However, kind of like Matt said, in pretty much any other genre of game, plenty of which also come down to frames of differences, those same top players would be told to get over it if they were complaining about something like dinosaurs in the background."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,ThisGuyIsNotDendi,29,Tue Jul 21 11:05:52 2015 UTC,Liam: He's the best Matt: Well apparently not if a dinosaur in the background fucks him up!!  Yeah that sold me more than anything
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,Ginoza108,4,Tue Jul 21 11:14:18 2015 UTC,Kind of proves my point though. Some stages can be distracting. See Final Destination in Smash 4.
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,2BFLiam,11,Tue Jul 21 15:19:18 2015 UTC,"And every other player in every game deals with it. See smash 4, Melee, Brawl, Killer Instinct, Marvel and every game where there's a background. I won't say there's no stage preference but I will say that it is a lot larger than Street Fighters 2."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,Viruszero,7,Tue Jul 21 16:53:45 2015 UTC,We'll see how well pro sports players keep their focus when I let loose dinosaurs in their stadiums!
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,2BFLiam,14,Tue Jul 21 15:28:34 2015 UTC,"Pro sport players keep their focus despite flashing ads all over the stadium, blasting music, different color screens all over the stadium. They're never like ""oh I missed my shot cause the pepsi ad behind the goal became a optometrist ad."""
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,Viruszero,3,Tue Jul 21 16:44:51 2015 UTC,"Dinosaurs make everything better, so you're not really helping your point."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,MrKenta,7,Tue Jul 21 20:26:23 2015 UTC,"Cosmetics are cool and it would be nice if they were included more in fighting game tourneys. But it's ultimately superficial and if the players feel it could potentially cause you to fail or get distracted in a match, then don't risk it, pick the training stage.  You don't go watch the Grand Finals for visuals. You watch the Grand Finals for the matches."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,CrownlessKombat,11,Tue Jul 21 15:00:38 2015 UTC,"The main problem I see is that in most other fighting games at EVO this year (Melee, GG Xrd, KI, Smash Wii U, Tekken 7and P4AU) they didn't use a bland training stage (for smash it's mainly due to the physical changes of the stage rather than the visual) even look at the past great fighters we've seen that haven't done that (KOF 13, SF3, SF2, GG AC... the list goes on)  Also as Pat said if the background can be distracting then how are the character costumes not? I get some stages are really bad visually Volcanic Rim for SF4 is the best example so they shouldn't be picked but most stages aren't distracting at all  I know it's a different genre but some DOTA 2 cosmetics change the way moves look to some ridiculous degrees to the point where it looks like a totally new move it coming out (not going to bore people with examples :P) but they aren't banned for a $17 Million dollar tournament coming up in a few weeks  Also just to further add about the whole hockey/tennis part not changing colour.... uh they don't need to if matches are held in different areas around the world? Hell with tennis they change the surface which actually affects how the ball reacts when it hits the ground, most games for say Hockey, NFL etc are held on one of the teams home ground which has their own team logos printed onto the terrain, different sponsors put around the fences/stands. The main reason I think it annoys both Matt and Pat as well as others is that the stage is literally just grey squares with red outlines, it actually is the most boring looking stage in any fighter ever."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,TakFR,10,Tue Jul 21 12:54:20 2015 UTC,"I'm with Pat on this one. I can totally see where Woolie is coming from, and I respect that the competitors want to maximize their performance and that means minimizing distractions, but, honestly? Fuck that. You think they turn off the ads and jumbo-tron when the football players are about to kick off? You think they tell baseball fans not to scream ""Daaaaryyyyl"" at Daryl Strawberry? No, they don't, and those athletes are playing for waaaay more money and waaaay bigger stakes than anyone at EVO is.  This bullshit of ""Oh, well that character in the background distracted me!"" is so lame and nonsense I can't even begin to scoff and roll my eyes at that attitude.   Again, Woolie, Liam, and all professional fighter game players, I respect what you do because it's awesome and I could never come close to emulating your skill, but come the fuck on.   And to those who say ""well you can't compare video sports to real sports!"" I say: so you don't want professional video game fighting to be taken seriously like other sports?  EDIT: And you can't say ""Oh, well why don't you want pink tennis courts or green hockey rinks?"" as an argument against wanting varied stages in Street Fighter tourneys. The difference between stages in SF is waaaay more than just color. It's the difference between an active volcano and the woods. So, yea, if the choice came up between watching hockey be played in an stadium or see it be played in the middle of the jungle primeval, guess which one people want to see."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,Djinn_n_Tonic,2,Tue Jul 21 15:26:19 2015 UTC,"But there's huge differences between what a fighting game player has to rely on versus what a professional athlete does.  Fighting games are determined by micro-movements in spacing and footsies, is a one on one contest, and is played out on an arena the size of a television screen.  Most professional sports rely on huge movements- either of players or objects-, are team reliant- so even if you have an off day you still have the handicap of the rest of your team-, and play out in huge arenas where distractions are minimalized because of the sheer size of the playing field.  Neither gamers nor athletes are completely distraction free, but both try to minimize their ability to be distracted, and shouldn't be shamed for trying to do everything they can to maximize their personal performance. Saying that fighting games can't be taken seriously because they've standardized their arena is ludicrous and discredits all the skill of the players themselves.   When your entire game is focused around paying close attention to actual millimeters of movement, it becomes so much more important to remove background elements than, say, another human being coming at you.    The better real sports analogy would be contact sports, such as MMA or Boxing, since they rely on the most similarities to fighting games, but even there the analogy falls apart for stage differentiation, because fighting rings are about as standardized as arenas come.  Sure, you could theoretically argue that ""Well hey, they have different colors in logos in an octagon in MMA!"", but those are such a minor component of the arena, you could equate them to the lines on Training Stage."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,BrometheusBound,12,Tue Jul 21 17:22:40 2015 UTC,"Completely with Matt and Pat. Woolie and Liam argued it like shits by laughing at them and making them out to be dumb. It's a fucking video game who gives a fuck if they can't play on a certain stage, play the video game."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,Chaps_Play_Games,7,Tue Jul 21 13:57:57 2015 UTC,Absolutely Pat. It was my first time watching other games at Evo this year besides Smash and GG and the training stage on Street Fighter just turned me off completely. Even with exciting fighting going on it was still so boring and I often found myself getting distracted with other things during the fights.
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,scrandwich,5,Tue Jul 21 14:28:55 2015 UTC,"But, see, like... with that argument, I would just say that you're not the target audience of the FGC. If you're getting bored during the SF4 Top 8 because of a bland stage, then you're not really the fighting game fanatic that EVO is targeted at.  I get that side of the argument, but I don't think that applies here."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,CrownlessKombat,0,Tue Jul 21 14:49:28 2015 UTC,"Is SF4 the only part of FGC? If so, then I agree. I don't even play fighting games so I'm definitely not who they're targeting, but I feel like they aren't just focus on the devoted fanatics of the genre otherwise I wouldn't have been on twitch watching the whole weekend.  But I watched top 8 of Sm4sh, melee, GG, KI, MK, and UMvC and I was engaged the entire time. Maybe I was just fatigued from like 10 hours of fighting games before SF4 but I just generally found it not as engaging as the games before hand."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,scrandwich,3,Tue Jul 21 15:03:46 2015 UTC,"SF4 is pretty much the core of the FGC. Like, the FGC would not exist if not for Street Fighter. It's definitely not the only part, but it is the core tenant.  EVO is a very niche tournament, despite it being the world tourney, that not a lot of people know about. It is on Twitch, but so is my friend's shitty Dragon Age Origins playthrough.  I get the idea that the stage is bland. But if you were actually bored during the Loser's Final of SF4 because of a training stage and you're not just hyperbolizing then you really aren't the audience here. Even as a casual fan, you're not the audience here because visuals mean shit when it comes to fighting game tourneys, you're supposed to be engaged by the gameplay."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,CrownlessKombat,6,Tue Jul 21 15:08:30 2015 UTC,"Aesthetics and atmosphere are nearly equal in importance to gameplay for me. I play a wide variety of fighting games and when my opponent picks ""the training stage"" I get super bummed out, especially in games where each stage has different music. As such an important part of the videogame overall, I feel that when playing the videogame, the entirety of the game's content should be included in the competitive circuit.Spoiler That being said, that would never work in a competitive sense because competition should always be as fair as possible. So fighting games should either not have training stage, or ban all stages except training stage."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,Psychomeister,5,Tue Jul 21 13:05:15 2015 UTC,"Training stages prevent possible problems with the players. For instance, I play a shit ton of fighting games and I'm color blind. So if Volcanic Rim in Street Fighter 4 is picked online then I have to quit out because I can't see anything happening on the screen, but that's considered in bad taste. There are other stages like this too, usually most fighting games have one it's just that Volcanic Rim is the most known, but a training stage prevents this happening with me.  I agree with you, and I wish other stages were more common in competitive circuits, but unfortunately, that's not likely to happen."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,CrownlessKombat,2,Tue Jul 21 14:35:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah if you have a physical disability that can really negatively impact your play on a map then you can request a different map, that's understandable. If you demand a re pick because ""that lady in the background moves sometimes and it throws off my entire game. I need absolutely nothing happening and no detail or else I can't play well."" That's dumb. Every other fighting game, even those with training stages, boasts a higher competitive stage array. There are preferences sure but not anywhere near the limited choice of SF"

And the biggest contradiction to Woolie and Liam's point is the godfather of competitive sports: the Coliseum. Gladiatorial games where explicitly for the crowd, and any competitive event in a public location is implicitly going with that mindset where the games are for the spectators."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,TheSalteseFalcon,2,Tue Jul 21 16:24:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Woolie is just wrong hard core on this one. You think Capcom is giving away half a mill because they want to know who the best street fighter player in the world is? Madcatz is throwing money at  Daigo and Mago because they want to be part of a dick measuring contest? Of course not, they're doing these things because 220 thousand people were watching Evo grand finals this year.

There's no difference between half of the way right and all of the way right.
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,TheKamenWriter,2,Tue Jul 21 15:48:38 2015 UTC,This is pretty much true. A good way to test if a Hitbox is a good match for you is to just set up a keyboard in a configuration like a hitbox and see if you like it.

Most of them were terrible people who were made out to be cool by peasants who would tell their stories who were afraid of them. Hercules would just go out and kill people randomly because he was drunk and pissed. Theseus has been described as a rampant rapist. Odysseus cheated on his wife all the time. And Jason went to another country, fell in love with a princess, was going to bring her back to get married and put her through the murder of her own brother to do that, but then says, nah, fuck it, Imma go fuck the pussy I got at home, peace. So she kills herself. And he doesn't care.  The point is that pop culture makes Greek heroes look cool when most of the time they're bad people who were put in positions of power."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,vorpalBucket,3,Tue Jul 21 13:13:57 2015 UTC,"I know Jason and the others are irredeemable assholes, but what about the tragic heroes who get punished for their hubris, like Arachnea, Tantalus, and Prometheus?  Were those written in different times, or maybe modern retellings leave some super dickery out?"
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,CrownlessKombat,4,Tue Jul 21 16:33:53 2015 UTC,"Arachne and Prometheus are legitimately tragic figures who were good people that were given a bad rap because the Gods are petty assholes. Tantalus was a horrible person. Tantalus was a cannibal serial killer who offered up his own son as a sacrifice and cooked him.  But yeah, those first two were actually good beings."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,Ahh_forget_about_it,2,Tue Jul 21 17:18:44 2015 UTC,"Hm. I'd say that makes some of the heroes flawed instead of just assholes. Sure, Hercules beat the shit out of people for stupid reasons. But he was still a hero who saved people and fought monsters, and (I think) didn't deserve the fate he got.  But I'm no expert or anything, so this is going off of basic knowledge."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,CrownlessKombat,2,Tue Jul 21 16:37:04 2015 UTC,"Hercules helped people for selfish reasons. He did it mostly to absolve himself rather than for any heroic reasons. He would go on military campaigns where he would rape and pillage people for the hell of it. Hercules definitely tried to help people a lot more than the other heroes, but he did a shit ton of terrible things while doing so.  Hell, the actual Hercules was a Greek warlord everyone was scared of because he did those terrible things."

TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,CrownlessKombat,9,Tue Jul 21 13:34:35 2015 UTC,"But that's how it was. They beat people up and raped people all the time. I think criticizing something for showing a more accurate depiction of what these ""heroes"" were is pretty unfair. They were symbols of power in Greek society, that's true enough, but power corrupts and that's why GoW2 made the heroes unlikable along with Kratos, who was also supposed to be a hero in that context."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,TimeShinigami,8,Tue Jul 21 13:58:33 2015 UTC,"Hades gets a bad rap too. He isn't the Greek version of Satan, despite western media portrayals. How many stories of Hades transforming into animals and raping women did you read? None. Zeus and Poseidon were pricks, capricious and petty. Meanwhile, Hades kept to himself, did his job, and started no shit."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,CrownlessKombat,7,Tue Jul 21 14:07:55 2015 UTC,"Hades was always the tragic brother of the Big Three. Undoubtedly, he had the best moral compass out of the three, but his brothers shafted him with the worst job of running the underworld. Hell, he gave chances to heroes that would visit him to prove themselves, like Orpheus with his wife and Hercules with Cerberus. The worst thing that he ended up doing was falling in love with Persephone and kidnapping her. But even that ended up being okay in the end because she fell in love with him too and they created the seasons together.  I really like Hades as a character. I think games/movies/books could do something interesting with him as a main protagonist of something, they've just never done it successfully to my knowledge."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,TimeShinigami,4,Tue Jul 21 14:20:25 2015 UTC,"You should check out the Dresden Files by Jim Butcher. In the latest novel, Skin Game, they go to rob Hades' vault and some really cool stuff happens. It's a long series though, and excellent reads, so it's kind of a time investment however."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,CrownlessKombat,4,Tue Jul 21 14:24:38 2015 UTC,"Hah, I actually own a few of the Dresden books. Just never gotten around to reading them. Do you have to read them all in order, meaning, should I start from the beginning? Or can I pick and choose stories that sound interesting?"
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,TimeShinigami,4,Tue Jul 21 14:30:22 2015 UTC,"You don't have to read them all, though the World Building is pretty big, and they all have an overarching plot. It's very possible to just read one here and there because there is resolution at the end of all but two of the novels.   They also follow a kind of pattern-every 3 books is Vampires, every 5 books is Demons, etc. The first two books are the most skippable, though you could also start at Dead Beat and work your way forward from there and not miss the most important stuff."

TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,CrownlessKombat,3,Tue Jul 21 18:58:47 2015 UTC,Duuuuuuude if there was a Telltale-style adventure game where you play as Hades or another Greek God I'd be so down for that!
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,MachoFan,-2,Tue Jul 21 19:01:04 2015 UTC,"I think someone who can show the worst people in a good light is a better storyteller than someone who can show them in the true light.  Fuck your ethics, I want a heroic tale. It gives people hope, no matter how false that hope is.  To quote a certain undead summoner ""Hope is.. comforting."""
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,CrownlessKombat,5,Tue Jul 21 15:08:12 2015 UTC,"That's not true at all. It varies from storyteller to storyteller. Vagabond is a portrayal of Miyamoto Musashi that is very accurate and is one of the best mangas of all time. Musashi the book is extremely inferior to Vagabond in almost every way and it showcases Miyamoto in a good light rather than the truer, darker one that Vagabond opts for.  Like the extreme of that argument is a book comes out today and it showcases Hitler in a good light. ""He might've killed the Jews, but boy he was a good painter I'll tell you what."" It wouldn't be okay. Your opinion doesn't apply to everything with a story. You're just saying you like Greek heroes being depicted as heroic. Rather say that."

I just want to read a fucking Spider Man comic without him being replaced every ten issues.  Rather than try and have these characters try to take the place of these giants that are known around the world and will never be able to fill their shoes, how about, I'unno, making new characters? And building them up to eventually become as big a deal as Thor, Cap, and the rest? Huh? How's that for an idea, Marvel?  EDIT: Okay, this post went from +10 to -3 in less than a span of like ten minutes. I'm cool with downvoting my stuff if it's off topic or rude or whatever, but don't manipulate votes. That's not cool."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,Freeman720,11,Tue Jul 21 12:47:04 2015 UTC,"Eh. The story and art are good, but the writing for the new Thor has been terrible. Also the fact that, you know, Thor is the guy's fucking name. Not a title to be passed down to whoever wields the hammer. When Storm used Mjolnir, she didn't become Thor. She was Storm, plus the powers of Thor. I dunno. I tried to like it, but I just didn't.  Also her identity was super fucking obvious.  Like the most obvious.  Like if you thought it was anyone else you're dumb."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,CrownlessKombat,5,Tue Jul 21 13:27:18 2015 UTC,"It has been. Jason Aaron at times can be a really great writer but some of his shit is horrible. His run on Hulk a while back was just plain bad. But I've enjoyed the art and the overall story, even if the actual writing for all the characters has been... meh at best.  Your problem with Thor is the same problem that I was talking about up there. Take Batman for example, even though he's DC and not Marvel. I don't particularly like the idea that Batman is a mantle that anyone could take up, because, frankly, that's not true. Bruce Wayne is a man with signs of schizophrenia, OCD, complicated grief, and plain insanity that fuels his burning desire to become the most dangerous man in the world, which he does, and then wears a Bat costume to justify his insanity. The Batman is a symbol to Bruce Wayne. He became Batman because he had a fear of Bats and he was overcoming his fear, which in turn, was symbolic of him overcoming his grief. It's so personally connected to him and him specifically that when Dick Grayson, Jason Todd, Tim Drake, and others try to take up his cowl, it feels fake and just makes me wish they could make those characters as important as Wayne. Only guy I could ever accept becoming Batman is Damian because of his similar circumstances.  And yes, her identity was obvious. So obvious that at one point I convinced myself it couldn't have been her because that's just too on the nose. But damn did they prove me wrong."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,sugakiwi,3,Tue Jul 21 13:55:38 2015 UTC,"I really liked Dick Grayson as Batman. I felt like that was the proper and best choice other than Terry McGiniss. I will never accept Damien as Batman since he was mostly terrible for 85% of his existence. That 15% being his portrayal in Batman and Robin.  And I would have fully been on born if Female Thor was revealed to be Beta Ray Bill ""NO ONE WILL RECOGNIZE ME WITH THIS WEIRD HUMAN CHEST BUMPS AND HIPS AHAAAA"""
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,fawfulator2,3,Tue Jul 21 16:19:50 2015 UTC,"couldn't agree more. I've seen claims that the whole replacing characters thing helps draw in new readers, but I don't see the logic there. like, if little jimmy sees avengers, and his favorite character is thor, and he's like, ""now I want to read a comic about thor"", what's currently on the shelf for him? a girl with a hammer and a cape that uses lightning powers. that's cool, she's a cool character, but she's not thor. that's a potential reader that was probably turned away."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e1qmn,cdstephens,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:09:50 2015 UTC,"I would actually prefer if the people under the mask switched up more often or like aged with real time: I'm pretty tired of seeing Bruce Wayne and Peter Parker etc. all the time. Imo it'd be better if their character's story just ended, and then the mask was passed onto someone else so it'd be more like in manga where a character's story actually ends at some point instead of continuing on for 60 years with retcons and crises. Let Peter Parker settle down and get married or Bruce Wayne get mad old like in Batman Beyond instead of having to make a deal with a devil to get Peter Parker back (I guess Superman gets to live forever though...)   Of course, it should actually make somewhat sense on who the next person should be (i.e. Terry or Dick as Batman instead of Damian, that sort of thing). I'm also fine with making a more diverse cast this way if it's written well, but I'm a bit biased since I wished I saw more LGBT characters growing up as a kid instead of literally no one."

Or Pakistan, another nuclear power, with an unstable government that goes through like two coups a year and is half aligned with the Taliban.  It's honestly a miracle that no bad guys have gotten their hands on a functioning nuke yet."

India and Pakistan... are quite hostile with each other. If there was ever a nuclear exchange between them, the whole thing would be over before the rest of the world could react.  Also, it's quite likely some bad guys have nukes, just no way to detonate them. I think Pat even said that nukes are intentionally hard to detonate, and often require codes the bad guys could never hope to acquire."

But if they want footage at a convention that isn't recording everything, they would need to set up their own camera and hook the audio equipment into something that would record it.

TwoBestFriendsPlay,3dxy0a,sirmidor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:21:37 2015 UTC,"Hmm, yeah alot of people say that, I dont rlly get it. Theyre there, cuz direct dmg was OP as fuck b4, so u just merc the front rows, then the ranged are stuck using their crappy front attacks. Shuffle attacks, back row attacks, almost entirely worthless. Now, if i shuffle a ranged in front of a melle, then wrek him with melle, their melle isnt just right back in my face cuz corpse :)  I was pretty happy that more of my characters movesets were viable now. They had a weirdly big negative backlash tho :/"
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3dxy0a,Mrthedecoy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:42:03 2015 UTC,Oh yeah like in terms of shuffling enemies around the corpses are fine but the reason i find it annoying is just cause if i dont take a ranged guy with me (which i dont do on occasion) then i just have to beat through like 1 or 2 of them to get to that last party member
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3dxy0a,sirmidor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:47:14 2015 UTC,"I get ya, ok. Im happy, cuz for pure balancing reasons it makes more interesting, indirect tactics viable. I can kinda see though, if u felt like just smashing em with melle/direct dmg itd be more boring to have to one guy has to spend a turn to clear corpses, which he didnt before. Now i get it. They just introduced it tho, im sure itl get tweaked to be more substancial as it goes on."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3dxy0a,Mrthedecoy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:55:53 2015 UTC,"yeah totally, it doesn't matter much to me since it only usually takes a turn or two without someone doing ranged stuff, but it'd be neat if they added something like an extra gold bonus or something as a reward for clearing the corpses before the disappeared"
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3dxy0a,FomorianKing,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:12:04 2015 UTC,"don't forget you can just back out super hard if you encounter a shambler in the dark, as opposed to summoning him yourself.    dark runs are great (well, used to be), mad dosh and more chance of crits (the enemies don't get a higher crit chance, only higher damage), which means you can heal stress much more easily."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3dxy0a,Mrthedecoy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:48:42 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, i never considered retreating from the shambler fight, but still continuing the dungeon. Does he just fuck off then?"
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3dxy0a,FomorianKing,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:58:23 2015 UTC,"i don't actually know, i've never retreated from a shambler fight, nor died to him (didn't encounter him till later levels, when i was a lot stronger, got lucky). i can imagine that  he won't disappear, but let's say you're exploring the last part of a branch of a dungeon that you don't need to (explore 90% of rooms missions), it might still be better to run."

TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e0y5t,Mrfipp,6,Tue Jul 21 03:57:22 2015 UTC,"That's true, but that also misses an element: one that's interesting for the viewer, as well as everyone else in the LP.

TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e0y5t,Mrthedecoy,24,Tue Jul 21 04:14:49 2015 UTC,"Shitty games all the way.  Anything David Cage is gold due to the horrible stories, and Ride To Hell has been one of their best LPs EVER."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e0y5t,_Burgers_,5,Tue Jul 21 03:10:01 2015 UTC,"Shitty games are always great, but you're really underestimating the RE4 and Silent Hill 2 LPs, which were also fucking sick awesome."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e0y5t,JaycobN7,2,Tue Jul 21 08:45:48 2015 UTC,"RE4 has plenty of dumb plot elements to play up for yucks though, and Silent Hill 2 was more like a guided tour of this amazing psychological experience than it was an LP.  I think dumb shit is the golden standard for quality LP games."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e0y5t,SickWheelchairCombos,6,Tue Jul 21 13:00:03 2015 UTC,"Both can be great. Revengeance playthrough is one of my all time favorites, as is the W101 video, but I've watched the Sadness trilogy about a thousand times because the deep despair is so hilarious. On the other hand we have Deadly Pee, the game that is both hilariously terrible and super hype at the same time, so there's a middle ground there too."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e0y5t,MrSups,5,Tue Jul 21 03:16:16 2015 UTC,Any game as long as it's not boring.
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e0y5t,longringlong,4,Tue Jul 21 03:44:39 2015 UTC,"I like the jank third person games like Man Vs Wild, Bug Island, and Disaster: Day of Crisis."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e0y5t,DragonEevee1,2,Tue Jul 21 06:40:48 2015 UTC,Medium range in length and fun to watch
TwoBestFriendsPlay,3e0y5t,hicks1012,2,Tue Jul 21 05:21:10 2015 UTC,"I think as long as a game isn't mediocre, then they can make a great LP out of it.  It's kind of like the pro team sports.  You either want to make the playoffs and compete well or you want to tank your season and get a good position for the draft so you can build a better team for the future.  If you are always stuck in the middle you never improve and your fans lose hope."

Part of it is definitely the fact that it was the first full LP of theirs I watched, but it was also the hilariousness of the game combined with their commentary that got me. I'm rewatching it now and it's still as good as it was a year ago when I first saw it."
