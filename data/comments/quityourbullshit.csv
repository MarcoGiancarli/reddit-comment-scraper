quityourbullshit,3e1fql,Thanewspaperguy,57,Tue Jul 21 06:17:03 2015 UTC,"As a welder, I've actually worked in heat like that. Take the ambient temperature, and add another 40 degrees minimum for the work area after I've been welding for a while. It's a combination of actual air temperature, and the radiant heat off of hot metal. You sweat your balls off - and don't overheat IF the air is dry enough for it to evaporate. The real killer is heat with high relative humidity. If you're a dumbass and don't drink enough water, you will get heat exhaustion very quickly. That's not something you want.  The bright side of things? I never, ever get cold in the winter while I'm working - although it's possible for my feet to be freezing and for the rest of me to be sweating excessively.  The bottom line? Plausible but unlikely. If their kitchen is getting that hot, they need better ventilation, period. It should be more like 90, maybe 100 max in there."

People who are contortionists. People who like being able to say ""I made that.""   In all seriousness, you can find ""clean"" welding jobs in shops. But they don't pay very good, not compared to stuff out in the field. They're usually very repetitive too. Not ""a robot should be doing this"" repetitive, because robots ARE doing the stuff that is THAT repetitive, but it can be boring if you're just sitting in a shop all day welding pretty much the same things over and over.   It'll get food on the table and rent paid (and then some), but you might go crazy doing it. I suppose shop work is not that different from office work, just more dangerous, dirtier and hotter.   To get the really great jobs you've got to work with a contractor that goes around repairing stuff for companies, be able to weld exotic metals like incoloy or work in an oil field.

You could make the same non-argument that because we supplied arms to all these rebel groups the fighting has gotten worse. I thought more guns made people safer?   Yes I define more dangerous guns as guns that carry larger and more bullets, shoot farther, and generally kill people more efficiently. You could have figured that out.   I don't have anything to contribute to your NY Safe Act reference. Sounds like people writing legislation are not so grounded in reality, not at all surprising. I also don't see how you can make the claim that ""...has not saved any one from to the handgun violence that still occurs."" Based on what study?   Fix the crime problem   OK you have to see why that is not as simple as it sounds. Everyone wants to fix the crime problem. How?  In summary, everyone is a law-abiding citizen until the moment they aren't. When they cross over that line of ""good guy"" to ""bad guy"" they could be committing a cold-blooded murder / armed robbery, or they could be committing a crime of passion based on some emotional/psychological stress in their lives. They might shoot themselves, their spouse or family members, or they could go on a rampage and kill dozens or more. There is no room for second chances once something like that happens. The cultural meme of ""good guy with a gun will stop bad guy with a gun"" is so far removed from reality in most cases. Try to find instances of a citizen hero that stops an armed robber or mass murderer in the act, and compare that with the list of tragedies where that did not happen. The results will speak for themselves.   I agree that we shouldn't be punished for something that isn't liked by others. End the Drug war, Legalize prostitution, Marriage equality, all those are similar arguments that don't get the same standard that we are giving to gun rights. Doesn't hurt you if you don't want to engage in those activities right?  That is simply not the same when it comes to guns, you can absolutely be affected by guns in very dramatic ways regardless of if you participate. The speed and severity with which you can ruin countless lives just doesn't exist with those other rights.  I'd like to see the same standard of responsibility we apply to cars/motorcycles/airplanes. We aren't allowed to just buy those things and use them however/whenever we want. Sure, its still possible to go offroad in your SUV and massacre a playground full of children, but at least we made an effort to see that you were competent enough to operate this very dangerous vehicle before you were legally allowed to use it. Give me a ""shooters license"" that requires at least some attempt to check your mental competency before you enjoy your fun and freedom. For the record, I don't see that happening anytime soon, however I believe those kind of laws as well as universal background checks (which is supported by the majority of Americans) are a step in the right direction. We will never get going in the right direction if people willingly swallow the argument that ANY gun regulation is a slippery slope to all out tyranny."

Distributive?  Right, so this means that the operation in question can basically be ""shared"" over some other operation.  Many many people have been equated to Hitler, so I'd say he's distributive.   Now in mathematics, ""operators"", such as the Hermitian operator, are associative but non-commutative.

I have seen the courage of parents, students, pastors, and police officers all over this country who say ""we are not afraid,"" and I intend to keep trying, with or without Congress, to help stop more tragedies from visiting innocent Americans in our movie theaters, shopping malls, or schools like Sandy Hook.""  From 2013 SOTU:  ""Each of these proposals deserves a vote in Congress. If you want to vote no, that's your choice. But these proposals deserve a vote. Because in the two months since Newtown, more than a thousand birthdays, graduations, and anniversaries have been stolen from our lives by a bullet from a gun. Gabby Giffords deserves a vote. The families of Newtown deserve a vote. The families of Aurora deserve a vote.""  He's talking about banning ""assault weapons"" and ""high capacity magazines"" in these situations. So yes, as far as government regulations go, he does want to take away guns. He never goes into much detail but basically anything that goes ""PEW PEW PEW"" and not ""PEW eject, chamber PEW etc"" is on his shit list.  Also after, I think, Sandy Hook? He said he was going to have a comprehensive study done on gun violence... presumably to show how bad guns are. The results came back and suggested that civillian ownership of guns is an important crime deterrent. He has not mentioned the study since.

quityourbullshit,3dyx8v,MURICA_BITCH,4,Tue Jul 21 04:35:02 2015 UTC,There was never any research done on gun violence. Obama ordered it but the most done was a summary of current research and recommendations. No actual research was done due to a 20 year old funding ban on gun violence research (which Obama tried and failed to overturn).
quityourbullshit,3dyx8v,live22morrow,4,Tue Jul 21 04:50:50 2015 UTC,"Summarizing and concluding the findings of multiple studies counts as research, whether or not you want it to, and the only conclusion they could find was that their gun laws have done nothing productive and that self defense is a viable reason for gun ownership in the United States.  Further, he ordered that done and refused to even bring it up again thanks to those findings. Even more than that, gun crime now is drastically lower than it was in the 90s so the antiquated studies on gun violence should, in theory, be somewhat supportive of an anti-gun agenda. If they analyzed modern FBI crime states, I think they'd find that gun crime is becoming a non-issue in many places and the study would be even less in Obama's favor.  So yes, there was research done. It was, largely, a statistical analysis of the net result of gun laws   Also I'd recommend you read the actual study. If you had you'd see numerous citations that are less than 10 years old. It's not like the 20 year ban on federal funding preventing data from being collected."

If people would just stick to that, they wouldn't get caught up in shit like this.  While my personal belief is that their should be tighter gun control due to poor mental health of some Americans, it should not effect responsible gun owners.   This is where the NRA and other ultra conservative groups fuck up. If they gave in a little and just did the right thing, normal gun owners wouldn't have so many issues. Instead we are looked at as scum of the earth due to poor representation by said groups.   My rant for the night."

It would be political suicide in 'merica to suggest that all guns should be banned, but his voting record speaks wonders on this topic.

I'm sure that there are many presidents and ex-presidents that are against guns that could be up there with Hitler as well, if we apply this logic to everyone.

There are thousands of different denominations, each with a tweak to scripture and practice. I'm sure most people overlook the fact that Mormon's are Christians, and if you compare the practices of a Mormon vs a Catholic you would see huge differences.

quityourbullshit,3dwjaq,pnt510,3,Mon Jul 20 08:32:16 2015 UTC,"You can't just wake up one day and say you're a Christian just because you think you believe the same things Christians do.   According to the doctrine, you must repent and accept Jesus Christ as your savior, receive the Holy Spirit which if truly received will change your behavior and set you on a righteous path, and you will most likely have to be baptized.  Even then it's not a sure guarantee that you are a Christian. Some people go through the motions because they want to feel accepted by a group of people or for political reasons, and not because they are genuine believers of the faith.   In the end you will know them by their fruits, says Paul if I'm not mistaken. So they must give testimony of righteousness (not absolute holiness) throughout the span of their life.   That is how you differentiate between true Christians and charlatans, there are serious, consistent requirements for being a Christian and most believers in the U.S. are merely ""cultural Christians"" because they go to church every once in a while and like to hear some otherworldly entity loves them and forgives their wrongdoings; in other words, they are not Christian, they behave as any other worldly person and have most likely not received the Holy Spirit into their lives (behavior, lifestyle choices, and attitude are great indicators of this).  In the end God will only know for certain but the Scripture does give us a litmus test or two to make sure a follower is indeed a true Christian or not, contrary to what most ""BUT THE NO TRUE SCOTSMAN FALLACY"" zealots will have you believe."

I'm pretty sure the latter one has at least hundred times more people. Sure, Obama might not be a Christian, but since he is standing in a church, the odds of him actually being a Christian are significantly higher. It's like having a non-Muslim standing in a mosque. There might be a few, but odds are, 99.99% of the people standing there are actually Muslims.  The evidence does seem to support the claim that Obama is actually a Christian. At least it is way more likely than if he is not."

In the last 15-20 years, companies like Tama, Yamaha have moved the majority of their manufacturing facilities to China, and I'm wondering if you have any information on whether the presence of formaldehyde in their glue would be an issue? Or is it just a flooring thing since they're producing so much and a slight drop in production cost makes more of a difference?"
quityourbullshit,3dsuvz,ANumenorean,6,Sun Jul 19 15:49:18 2015 UTC,"Well personally, I'm involved more in plywood and door cores, so I don't really know a great deal regarding that aspect of the industry.   It's not just the flooring industry that cuts corners, and it's not just with regards to formaldehyde content that is an issue. Most of everything from China should be treated with a little bit of scepticism. Be it the source of the material they say they use (or the specie), the type of glue they use, the quality of the glue the use, the grading and certification etc. Everything can be faked on paperwork or through bribes, including inspections.   And there's definitely issues with the due diligence on our side of things. You'll be hard pressed to find a big company that doesn't know they're being lied to, but because the price is right and the paperwork says it's right, they turn a blind eye (this is exactly what will be happening with Lumber Liquidators).   That's not to say there's no quality available in China, but it's just you really have to pay for it and you have to make proper inspections and keep on top of them to make sure they're not cutting corners."
quityourbullshit,3dsuvz,Fire_Bucket,2,Sun Jul 19 18:46:13 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not worried about the type of wood, that's very easy to determine when viewing grain patterns and hearing the tone. I'm wondering if these same formaldehyde containing glues are being used in the drum manufacturing process. Like the guy in the video said, they can make it CARB 2 compliant, but it's more expensive. I've only ever read that the manufacturing process hasn't skipped a beat since these companies have moved to China, but I'm just wondering if we're getting the full story, or if I should be looking into starting a lawsuit lol. Free drums ahead boys!"
quityourbullshit,3dsuvz,ANumenorean,3,Sun Jul 19 18:53:34 2015 UTC,"but I'm just wondering if we're getting the full story,   Very unlikely that you are. It might have been true in the past, but the West initially moved a lot of production to China due to the cheap source material and especially the cheap labour. The labour isn't so cheap any more, so they make up for it by cutting corners.   or if I should be looking into starting a lawsuit lol   Honestly, I don't think you'd be able to do much. However, if you are seriously interested in pursuing something like this, gather as much information you can and take it to a rival dealer/agent who doesn't use Chinese manufacturing. Someone who will gain from the exposition and also has the contact details to push forward with it."
quityourbullshit,3dsuvz,Fire_Bucket,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:01:25 2015 UTC,I can send sample drums in to get tested similar to what they did on 60 minutes. Is there a way that you'd recommend going about finding a lab that could test for that sort of thing? Any idea the cost? Sorry for all the questions...I just don't know how to go about finding that stuff.
quityourbullshit,3dsuvz,ANumenorean,2,Sun Jul 19 19:17:54 2015 UTC,"Find out if there's Wood Science department to any local universities, as at the very least they'll be able to do specie analysis or glue bond strength tests, and possibly for the formaldehyde content of the glue too."

I know some lazy people, but I don't know anybody who would lie about an injury to skip work. Most people I know go to work injured, just because their job is important to them.  I guess it comes down to the fact that the guy doesn't care about his job and his responsibilities. That's really sad to see if he is a grown up. If he was a teenager or something I could understand skipping work from time to time, but what is the excuse for skipping work on a whim as a grown person?"
quityourbullshit,3dldi5,Iamsherlocked37,76,Fri Jul 17 20:07:52 2015 UTC,"Depression. Anxiety. Attachment issues. Basically, mental illnesses of any sort. Especially with depression and anxiety, it can appear to people that the sufferer is just lazy (either because they are depressed, or because they are avoiding things because they're anxious). Even the sufferer can think this. However, it's not true. Medication and behavioral therapy can work wonders for these problems.   I'm someone that has struggled with anxiety and depression and it has prevented me from showing up to work pretty often."
quityourbullshit,3dldi5,smekiar2,16,Fri Jul 17 20:47:38 2015 UTC,"Well that's the thing. You can't know if he has problems or if he is just lazy and cocky. People need to talk about these things otherwise as I assumed, he is lazy as fuck.  I've suffered from depression when I was a teen, but I quickly realized that it's better to talk about your problems instead of hiding it.  Sure I had a sister I could talk to and ask for advice, I understand not everybody has that. But people still need to talk about their problems.   I've lost 3 years of school  because I tried to run away from my problems and not talk about them, now I'm 20 and I'm last year of high school. I wish I could turn back time and tell myself that running from my problems only makes it worse and I need to talk to someone. I realized it late, but not too late.  What I'm saying is, I understand your point. I've experienced it first hand, but as it was assumed for me (that I was skipping school because I had fun), it's assumed for other people too. That's precisely why if you have a problem you need to talk about it and try to solve it.  I mean without knowing the guy OP is talking about, it can be either avoiding his problems or he is just lazy."
quityourbullshit,3dldi5,gunhorseunlimited,4,Fri Jul 17 21:21:54 2015 UTC,"This is very, very true. Talking about it is the best and fastest, and almost always the only way to get help and get better.  Unfortunately, there's a significant social stigma against mental illness, and that social stigma - combined with the fact that most people just don't understand - makes it extremely hard for people in these situations to talk about it, especially if their issue is social anxiety or something like that.  It's a really terrible situation, frankly. People with mental health issues are best helped by reaching out, but we live in an environment where reaching out is extremely difficult."

quityourbullshit,3dldi5,ILikeMyBlueEyes,5,Fri Jul 17 23:36:01 2015 UTC,"I was honest with the owner of a place I worked at about my mental illness. I had run out of my medication, and since I had just moved to a new state, I didn't have a doctor who could give me a refill (nor did I have health insurance). The only way I could get a prescription ASAP was if I checked myself into a mental and behaviour hospital. I explained all of this to my boss and she even encouraged me to check myself in. Said they would make the schedule work with me out for a few days.  I spent one night at that place, got my medication, and went home. Called my boss to let them know I was out. She said she went ahead and gave me a few days off. Cool. A few days later I get a call from her saying they needed a note from the doctor that saw me while I was in that place, saying I was fit to return to work. I figured they needed it for legal reasons and had no problem getting it for them. I personally delivered the note and she told me to return to work the next day.  The next day comes around and as soon as I walked in, she calls me into her office. Her mother was with her (she helped to run the place). We all sit and they tell me that they were gonna have to let me go because of something I said to a coworker when I dropped off the note. They claimed I said, ""I get so irrationally angry sometimes, and fear I will hurt someone."" I never said that. I look at them, flabbergasted. Quickly they say that other workers heard me say it too. I asked, ""So you're firing me because I have a mental illness?!"". Of course they say no. I tell them I never said what they claimed I did. They just pushed further that I did.   I left feeling uterly betrayed. These people, just a few days ago, were 100% supportive and understanding when I informed them of my mental health. Then used it against me while claiming they weren't (Of course they denied it. Firing me for having a mental illness is illegal. Especially since I wasn't a harm to myself or anyone else.) That wasn't the first time someone began treating me differently, or used their new found knowledge of my mental illness as a way to shut me out. It's like once they know I suffer from a mental illness, they think I'm crazy or gonna kill myself. But I'll tell you what, that was definitely the last time I will ever be open to people about my illness. I am not discouraging others to keep quiet. This stigma attached to mental illnesses needs to go away. And being open about it will help. It's just a personal choice for me to not talk about my mental illness. I've been burned one too many times.  Ugh, sorry for the length. Just needed to vent somewhere."

I didn't have any family to speak of,  so they were my family.  When they knew I was sick,  they said I had a demon in me,  and that it would be contagious if they continued to hang around me.  They said I should pray more and that would fix me.  Then every one of them stopped returning my calls.   I was furious for years.   But,  I've had lots of experiences where professors and bosses were completely understanding and have gone far down the extra mile to help and support me. I think it depends on the own person's experience with mental illness.    I'm so sorry you had that experience.  While they are frequent,  try to cherish and remember the other type of reaction to MI: compassion and supportiveness.  Don't let a few assholes keep you from telling employers if you're struggling.

I was extremely generous with the points on the test, even giving a point for putting tbe right tea and ice in the drink. She got a 50 percent after 3 weeks of training, which is normally 1 week but nepotism. She asked for a do over but at that point even my monumental patience was gone and I told her no and fired her. She still doesn't get why apparently"

quityourbullshit,3dldi5,tacomalvado,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:39:40 2015 UTC,I wouldn't go so far as to say she was the worst employee ever   Who was the worst one then?
quityourbullshit,3dldi5,enelson1991,16,Sat Jul 18 04:04:28 2015 UTC,Either the heroin adict who stole constantly or the guy who believed in shapeshifting lizard people and spilled 3 gallons of soybean oil on the floor. Both were bad in their own special ways.
quityourbullshit,3dldi5,tacomalvado,3,Sat Jul 18 04:06:18 2015 UTC,Can I please hear about both? And were you one of the lizard people?
quityourbullshit,3dldi5,enelson1991,13,Sat Jul 18 04:07:37 2015 UTC,"Sure I've got time. First the heroin adict, to be referred to as HA. She showed up about a month or two into my employment at a previous employer, sandwich shop. The woman she referred to as her mom, who had no relation to her that anyone around either of them knew, knew the owners and HA basically always had a job with them when she needed it. Hooray for nepotism again I guess. Well her story is pretty brief, constant source of drama and was constantly calling out/leaving early because she was sick. This led to me working a good 70 percent of the winter rush alone from open to close, because we were in a mall food court this was particularly bad. She was also dating one of the guys on housekeeping who was fired for bringing a gun into the mall. She would also constantly disappear to smoke or whatever, sometimes leaving the store unattended. She eventually got worse as time wore on, as she started leaving early every day, pretty much working until another person came in. She would ask them to leave her clocked in until her shift was supposed tp end. That didn't work for me and as soon as she was out the door I would sign her out, then everyone else she did this to started following suit after they realized how much prep work she would leave us with. She got really mad and started making stuff up about us trying to get us fired, she targeted me the most but I was such a good and reliable worker that my bosses pretty much discounted her lies but did nothing else. Eventually HA was caught stealing by another mall worker who reported it to the owner's daughter as the owner was overseas in England. She fired HA on the spot which was glorious.  Now, lizard people guy, LP for short, was a different level of crazy. He always had some excuse for everything, my favorite was that he had a liver disorder that prevented him from remembering things. Now that's all well and good, those do exist, but he also talked about how much he drank constantly. Now to give you a picture of what this guy looked like, he was about 5:7"",200lbs, shaved head, scraggly beard and messed up teeth. He was also an Italian from Boston. I mention this because if you interacted with him he would remind you every few seconds. LP was horrible with customers, once a woman said she was just ordering for her kid and he looked at her and said ""we got salads"" to which she retorted  ""do I look like I need a salad"" he said yes. He also called the cops on a mall employee because she complained about a sandwich he made. After he was fired and we knew the store was closing I told her that she would eat for free because of that until we closed for good. His first night flying solo he spilled a gallon of soybean oil on the floor and tried tk clean it with cornmeal. That was fun to clean. As for his conspiracy theories, yeah they were off the wall. He didn't think I was a lizard person, even though I AM a lizard person in the sense I am a cat person as I like reptiles. What I remember from his rantings, there are shapeshifting lizard people living among us and there have been for a while. They've mixed with the Asian races, and have also infiltrated out government. Tesla worked with them to punch a hole in our atmosphere so they could pump their atmosphere in and that's what chemtrails are... yeah. He got fired because he assaulted one of our staff and security had to be.called."

quityourbullshit,3dldi5,enelson1991,2,Sat Jul 18 07:01:21 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah they were real. It was super frustrating dealing with them but I'm a better person for it. I'm a lot more patient with people which shows when I deal with my staff, on the other hand I do not tolerate bs and don't hesitate to call people on it because I've seen how things go from little infractions to big catastrophes. Which is why with that high school girl I put all my effort into training her but since she wasn't taking things seriously I decided it was time for her to go. Don't need someone like that bringing down the whole shop."
quityourbullshit,3dldi5,ponte92,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:10:41 2015 UTC,God and I thought some of the people I have to train were bad. Thanks for these stories I will try and remember them tomorrow when dealing with the new staff.
quityourbullshit,3dldi5,enelson1991,2,Sat Jul 18 14:59:46 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, here's some advice from me. It comes from both having to train people at every job I've been at and having educators for parents. People learn better when they're comfortable, so be calm and a little upbeat. If they make a mistake point it out but don't dwell on it, maybe let them know how common it is as well. There is no reason for them to be stressed or afraid of anything yet, unless there is some dangerous like a meat slicer or something. I guess that's it really."

Hate to say it, but seeing them get a pay cut for their bullshit recently was a tiny bit satisfying after taking up the excess of the work on top of my other roles.

quityourbullshit,3dli1s,crybannanna,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:09:54 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. There is a website online for bartering games; you find people with a game you want, and offer them games you dont want anymore.  It is pretty much impossible to trade a game for any game that is older than it, because older games cost less so they have less value to them. That means you can only at best trade games for other games that were released on the same year, unless you are the party willing to barter ""at a loss"", like when I traded Skyrim for Brutal Legend.  Games like InFamous sare pretty much untradeable unless you use them as dealbreakers, as in ""Okay, so how about I give you this game you want, plus InFamous?"""

quityourbullshit,3dli1s,crybannanna,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:28:41 2015 UTC,"IMO the middle is often the best option, what I was trying to convey was that everyone gets so set on their way being better that coming to meet in that middle becomes impossible. An example for how I think everything would work in the perfect world would be kind of like the experience I had with someone recently who was fairly conservative and personally opposed to gay marriage but also in our conversation reviled to me that he thought it should be legal because the government had no right to tell anyone who they could marry just as they couldn't tell him to like it.   Unfortunately I think at least in the US our party system has recently begun to tear apart compromises like that because of the above issues."
quityourbullshit,3dli1s,bbluech,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:40:33 2015 UTC,"I agree.   Though just to play devils advocate, have you ever wondered if maybe it's that very concept of middle ground compromise that pushes people into the extremes.   What I mean is, let's say we tend to compromise in a middle ground between extreme positions. If one side becomes more extreme, the middle ground shifts to their original central position. The remedy (perhaps subconsciously) is for the opposing side to push the agenda to their own extreme... Thus correcting the middle ground into the true original middle.   I tend to think that we should all abandon our extreme views in favor of practical ones. We should attempt to find policy that works best for our society... Assess the outcome and adjust incrementally when appropriate until we find an optimal. We are so concerned with being right we completely abandon actually testing to find what works. That's a shame.  Why we completely abandon results centered ideology based on evidence is beyond me."

It doesn't mean that all conservative news sources are inaccurate; it just means that Fox is one example of propaganda and pandering marketed as news. There are certainly liberal sources that are just as bad, (although maybe they aren't as big as Fox). The anti-vax movement exists largely in liberal circles, and there are loads of liberal websites that spread related misinformation.

If you do choose to eat the flaming flower make sure to shoot fireballs at your father.

quityourbullshit,3dhwf9,SpotNL,19,Thu Jul 16 16:14:24 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I feel like the comedy does the movie's tragedy good.  When I was in college, I took a short story class. Long story short, every story turned out to be ""Hey, here's some people. Now they're miserable forever, the end."" It numbed me to the characters; I saw them as if they were Sims in someone's masochistic video game. I developed an almost mockingly critical attitude when watching any sort of drama.  Life is Beautiful tore that attitude apart. The first half of the movie is devoted to making you love this man and his family, and then they get sent to the concentration camp, where he continues to be the very man you fell in love with in the first half.

It's /r/legaladvice, and they gave him legal advice.  Bullshit it may be, but ""no, you're lying, and doing it badly"" isn't really the point.  They answer hypotheticals all the time.  This is no different, just presented by a moron looking for attention.  Someone might get actual use out of the thread, at least."
quityourbullshit,3dhwf9,ripleycat,53,Thu Jul 16 15:51:52 2015 UTC,"I think it's one of those things where it costs /r/legaladvice very little to take the story at face value, but if they call BS on it and are wrong, they've potentially dissuaded a person in serious trouble from seeking out advice or help in the future. I mean seriously, what's been lost by assuming it was real? Some people lost some time writing out good advice - advice that even if it wasn't helpful to this person, might be very helpful to someone reading, or someone who searches for similar advice in the future.   It's a bit like how many subreddits try to handle people who share their rape stories. As long as the person isn't accusing someone by name or asking for money or something, why not just take the story at face value and offer comfort? What is to be gained by trying to poke holes in the story, or accusing the victim of lying? But if the victim was being honest, then you may have done serious harm to them by attacking them that way.   It's simple cost/benefit analysis."

quityourbullshit,3dhwf9,teefour,11,Thu Jul 16 14:10:29 2015 UTC,As a native spanish speaker I can confirm. When someone is learning english they try to directly translate the words without changing the structure. The way words are placed in the post has nothing to do with spanish. It is indeed a very poor attempt to fake a native spanish speaker.

quityourbullshit,3dhwf9,05U,126,Thu Jul 16 14:05:25 2015 UTC,"""I not you understand"" seems like reasonable translation of ""yo no te comprendo"", so not the best example maybe.  Linguist seems to know his shit, though."
quityourbullshit,3dhwf9,thebigbadben,34,Thu Jul 16 14:05:21 2015 UTC,"Hmmm.....I'm Mexican-American and I can't recall someone saying ""I not you understand"".  That seems like a google translate type of answer.   Perhaps the word 'not' is the biggest give away but adding 'you' in that sentence doesnt' seem typical.  I think most spanish speakers with terrible English would say ""no understand' or ""I no understand' or if they had a 'you', it would probably be ""i no understand you'.   That's just my experience."
quityourbullshit,3dhwf9,daimposter,11,Thu Jul 16 13:10:59 2015 UTC,"""Entiendo"" would work better than ""comprendo"" in this case. Yo te comprendo would imply empathy rather than simple comprehension."
quityourbullshit,3dhwf9,waiv,45,Thu Jul 16 16:00:51 2015 UTC,"I'm just beginning to learn Spanish, and I have to ask.  Why add the te?  Wouldn't it be yo no comprendo or simply no comprendo?  And on the subject of the liar, the Latinos here in SoCal that don't speak English tend to just say i don't know when asked something in English.  That is at least my observation."
quityourbullshit,3dhwf9,irapeninjas,79,Thu Jul 16 14:52:21 2015 UTC,"Same in English. You can say ""I don't understand you"", but ""I don't understand"" makes just as much sense so the ""you"" is technically unnecessary. I can't speak Spanish but I imagine it's a similar situation."
quityourbullshit,3dhwf9,HMJ87,45,Thu Jul 16 13:45:18 2015 UTC,"This is correct. The te is a direct-object pronoun indicating whom the speaker doesn't understand. It's not strictly necessary. It's the difference between ""I don't understand"" and ""I don't understand you."" You could also drop the ""yo"" (the conjugation of ""comprender"" as ""comprendo"" signifies the first-person), or you could say ""no lo comprendo"" for ""I don't understand it,"" as in, ""I don't understand what you're saying.""  Lots of different ways to say basically the same thing."
quityourbullshit,3dhwf9,vexion,25,Thu Jul 16 13:48:20 2015 UTC,"Te gives the sentence a second subject, ""you"".   Yo no comprendo - I don't understand  Yo no te comprendo - I don't understand you"

My relatives who barely speak English know fewer phrases than the OP but can communicate better than that post because of all the reasons the linguist states (which, I wouldn't have known how to put into words, just that I knew it sounded totally off for a native Spanish speaker). If he hadn't stated what language he spoke originally, my guess would have been some Eastern European country."

quityourbullshit,3dhwf9,IIdsandsII,13,Thu Jul 16 13:32:21 2015 UTC,"Also, the use of the plurals is* quite abnormal, since both English and Spanish usually form them with an -s at the end"

quityourbullshit,3dhwf9,mlpsla,48,Thu Jul 16 16:15:52 2015 UTC,"As a non linguist married to a Slavic speaker, they seem to love the shit out of adding ""the's"". My wife speaks perfect English but her family learned English in their 20's informally. A lot of ""let us watch the TVs"" and ""I looked it up on the googles!""  They also have trouble spelling in English. In their language, each character has a sound and if the word makes that sound, that character is there. Makes for funny text messages. They text what they would say in English but with their accent. So ""sick"" they pronounce ""seek"", so that's what they type. I couldn't see a Slavic person writing all that without a single spelling error."
quityourbullshit,3dhwf9,SigO12,12,Thu Jul 16 17:46:38 2015 UTC,"I'm Russian and was raised in a Russian community here in the states and I would say most Russians actually never use ""the"" even when necessary. It's always like ""I am going to mall"" ""How much cost?"" ""What is best way to airport?"" or they always confuse the order since in Russian you can say most phrases in very different orders so instead of saying ""I am going to store"" they will say, ""Store, I am going"" since in Russian either would be valid."

quityourbullshit,3dhwf9,kangaesugi,10,Thu Jul 16 12:56:34 2015 UTC,"Yeap, I get it all the time. Hell, even people getting dicked by auto correct or just completely misspelling a word without auto correct on 90% of the time you know what they meant but other people come in and be all like ""that post made no fucking sense wtf"""
quityourbullshit,3dhwf9,epicmtgplayer,10,Thu Jul 16 13:04:52 2015 UTC,"One of the people who responded to you did exactly as you said. I wanted to reply to them with ""Dude, you can stop mentioning that you're not a native speaker -- nobody will know."" Then it hit me that as someone who learned English as a Second Language I know what they mean - we will write correctly for very many years, but every now and then we'll slip... and it will be due to holes in our knowledge as English Language Learners. In the meantime a great number of native speakers are struggling with ""its"" vs ""it's,"" ""your"" vs ""you're,"" ""they're"" vs ""there""... etc."
quityourbullshit,3dhwf9,Dencho,8,Thu Jul 16 13:21:36 2015 UTC,"They'll type out a perfectly formatted paragraph, and then end it with ""sorry for my poor grammar"".   I used to do this! I learned English all by myself and it used to be a valid disclaimer; it really changed the way people correct you, or at least it did in the phpbb times, Reddit has less grammar nazis."
quityourbullshit,3dhwf9,JamesMean,15,Thu Jul 16 13:54:22 2015 UTC,"fewer  And a lot of that has to do with how the person correcting you comes across.  If they correct you like a pedant or in a way that makes them seem like a dick, Reddit doesn't like that too much, but if they do it in a way that says ""Hi, I'm just trying to help!  Looks like there was an error there, no hard feelings!""  Then it's usually seen as OK.  I thought about just saying ""fewer"" and leaving it at that, but I wanted to make sure that you knew I was just trying to help, and to be sure there are no hard feelings."
quityourbullshit,3dhwf9,N8theGr8,11,Thu Jul 16 15:05:35 2015 UTC,"I've seen a lot of ""I hate to be that guy but..."" here as opposed to ""it's your you retarded monkey"".

quityourbullshit,3dhwf9,JamesMean,42,Thu Jul 16 14:45:17 2015 UTC,"LOL. I wish you could have seen me learn to speak Russian when I first moved to Ukraine.  In the train to Kharkov, we got a private sleeper and some dude walks in and starts unpacking. In a panic, i mustered up all the Russian I could remember from my 8 week language training course: ""Brother! Brother! You not automobile! Not your home! Not here! Not here! We money!""  Edit: For the Russian speakers, I will transliterate what I said, ""Brat! Brat! Vuy ne nash machina! Ne vash dom! Ne sdes ne sdes! Muy plata!"

quityourbullshit,3dhwf9,IHateTheLetterF,20,Thu Jul 16 14:54:41 2015 UTC,LOL. The only time someone ever pointed an AK at me in Ukraine was actually about 3 hours before this exact incident. I got off the plane in Kiev and was walking down a hall. At the end of the hall was a split with a dude in military fatigues holding a Kalyashnikov. He didn't say anything or motion which direction to take. So I went the direction that caused him to shout and point his gun at me. I quickly got back in step and was safe from being shot again.
quityourbullshit,3dhwf9,lawjr3,7,Thu Jul 16 13:39:20 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, pointing a gun at someone for walkign the wrong direction? WTF? Was a simple yell and point to the right direction not an option?"
quityourbullshit,3dhwf9,V0RT3XXX,10,Thu Jul 16 14:20:29 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I think he may have been using the gun to point the direction for me to go, but he was definitely waving it at me, a dude who had roughly no clue what he was saying.  I don't understand why he just didn't stand in front of the hallway he didn't want me to go down."
quityourbullshit,3dhwf9,lawjr3,4,Thu Jul 16 14:28:49 2015 UTC,Why did you move to Ukraine out of interest?
quityourbullshit,3dhwf9,Imthecityexplorer,11,Thu Jul 16 14:38:01 2015 UTC,"Yep what makes it hard to understand IRL is the accent usually, a lot of the the people I know who speak English as a second language know the language fine but their accent is so strong you can barely understand."
quityourbullshit,3dhwf9,_procyon,11,Thu Jul 16 14:47:44 2015 UTC,Thank you. I am a native Spanish speaker and when I was reading that post none of it made any sense to me. Even when I was starting to learn English I never wrote like that. And I do find it offensive that this guy thinks this is the way we communicate.
quityourbullshit,3dhwf9,ih8erryone,5,Thu Jul 16 15:59:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I tutored students in essay writing while in college, and a ton of international students came in to be tutored. There were basically 3 kinds of ESL writers: those with impeccable grammar, those who wrote well but made mistakes specific to their language (Chinese students not including articles), and those who just ran their essay through Google Translate."
quityourbullshit,3dhwf9,flargensblarg,4,Thu Jul 16 13:06:29 2015 UTC,"As far as I can tell, for people who English is a second language on reddit, they tend to have perfectly fine grammar, and often they are better than native speakers.   To be fair, those are people who have taken a lot of English courses and are proficient in English as a second language. What the faker in the OP is doing is more representative of people who have only picked up English from exposure but have not taken several courses to learn to read and write properly in English   However, as a Mexican-American, I read that post and can easily tell it's fake. Just doesn't seem typical.....it sounds more like a stereotypical Russian (or eastern European) than a Spanish speaker."

Why ""year"" and not ""years""?? In spanish you'd pluralize year as ""años"".  Why didn't he pluralize it here?  Did he suddenly forget how to type the letter s?  He pluralizes plenty of other words. ""take us to mexico back"".  Putting ""back"" (de vuelta) after ""mexico"" would be legal spanish, but really awkward. ""what to do?""

I've had numerous conversations with friends about how odd I think it is that they all prefer when I lie to them. I frame it in a way to suggest I'm referring to my other friends/family and not them personally.  They all agree it's best to lie in many cases.   Taking their assertions about how I should behave around other friends and applying it to them, I feel less guilt for small lies now.  I don't do it for me, I do it because they have expressed a desire that I do it.  I'm not comfortable lying, but I'm sick of being the outcast so this just works better for everyone.   Edit: called out for bullshitting... Changed the word to reflect a more accurate statement. My fault."

She and all of her friends are completely unaware of reverse image search and so far no one has called her out on her bullshit, including me. The reason for that is... well, she's my mom, and I'm a socially inept coward who'd rather let it slide than have a potentially relationship-destroying confrontation about it. I know I would come at it from a place of love, but I have a feeling she would feel cornered and be pissed at me. However unfair that is, I'd just rather avoid it.  So, what does she lie about? A lot of it is textbook narcissism, where she's garnering esteem and admiration for things she didn't (and could never) do. She'll post a picture of some complexly crocheted blanket and say she just finished it up, and then sit back and soak up the ""Wow! That's amazing!"" compliments. Usually someone will offer to buy it from her, and she'll reply that she donated to the pediatric ward at the hospital or to some battered women's shelter. How convenient, that. Too bad the image was stolen off some website. Too bad she's had a half dozen carpal tunnel surgeries and can barely hold a spoon, let alone crochet anything.  But some of them are downright pointless. A couple years ago her cat had kittens. They were super cute. She posted pictures of them on FB and everyone agreed they were adorable. But interspersed with these real pictures she'd taken with her phone were ones that were blatantly taken with a different camera. I reverse image searched and... yep, totally stole those. Just found pictures of kittens that looked vaguely similar and passed them off as her own. She has cute kittens, she has a camera! Why would she possibly throw the fakes in there? What the fuck is there to gain from that?  I think with her and the others that do this shit, it usually comes down to narcissism. Somehow they are able to glean pride from compliments given to them for things they didn't actually accomplish. But I think sometimes they resort to it because they have nothing else to post, and they feel as though there's an expectation for them to post. Something, anything. They just want to get their voice out there, regardless of its truthfulness.  And that depresses the shit out of me."

Is that the right word to use?  For example, I did pretty well in school, but instead of saying I got 80/100 on X test, I got 95/100 on X test.   I've come to realise that instead of lying to people about the person I wish I was, I'm using my time to become the person I said I was, if that makes sense. So I said to people I spoke Norwegian (no fucking idea why, but it is what it was) and so now I'm learning Norwegian.

Or maybe they grow up where no one calls out their lies.  They never experience the downside of being caught lying so they learn it's worthwhile.

quityourbullshit,3djeb5,Sprogis,7,Thu Jul 16 22:30:12 2015 UTC,"I think the internet in general just caters to Pathological Liars, read:   Lying is the act of both knowingly and intentionally/willfully making a false statement. Most people do so out of fear. Normal lies are defensive, and are told to avoid the consequences of truth telling. They are often white lies that spare another's feelings, reflect a pro-social attitude, and make civilized human contact possible. Pathological lying is considered a mental illness, because it takes over rational judgment and progresses into the fantasy world and back. Pathological lying can be described as a habituation of lying. It is when an individual consistently lies for no personal gain. The lies are commonly transparent and often seem rather pointless.   When I say 'caters', I mean I am constantly astounded at how many people actively defend being bullshitted on a regular basis. Take the thread about the fake Mexican redditor right now: there are people in the comments praising what he did on the basis that because it inspired useful information, it was an acceptable action. This type of defending (along with 'who cares if it's a lie as long as it's funny?) is rife."

quityourbullshit,3dbj9l,Tattered_Colours,46,Wed Jul 15 06:31:11 2015 UTC,Why did you censor out the names? They're public figures.
quityourbullshit,3dbj9l,Levy_Wilson,38,Wed Jul 15 04:57:50 2015 UTC,"Rule 2 - LINKS TO REDDIT ARE FORBIDDEN - ONLY SCREENSHOTS ARE ALLOWED. PERSONAL INFORMATION MUST ALWAYS BE CENSORED.   Edit: In a response to your deleted comment,    A username is not personal information, genius.   It's a rule to avoid witch hunting. In this case it's blatantly obvious who is talking to who, but the rules are put there to help avoid problems before they happen.  Plus I would argue that a username is personal information when someones account can contain loads of personal information about that person which was possibly posted anonymously. If somehow Reddit suddenly found out every usernames real name and included that next to their username, then many lives and careers could easily be ruined. Imagine finding out your friend, family member, or co-worker was the one that posted the cumbox, or basically anything in this AskReddit Post. It's a preventative measure to avoid issues like that."
quityourbullshit,3dbj9l,Stevenson_The_Last,3,Wed Jul 15 07:19:52 2015 UTC,"Reddit usernames are 100% allowed in the image links. The only thing that's not allowed are direct links to the threads, however non-participation links are allowed in the comments.  The personal information rule is typically with regards to off-Reddit public profiles, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, personal websites etc."
quityourbullshit,3dbj9l,Fire_Bucket,-2,Wed Jul 15 16:40:14 2015 UTC,"Well I've seen Reddit usernames censored in screen-caps quite a bit so I assumed that rule went along with it, but that could just be a common courtesy type thing. Looking through some posts it seems to be a hit or miss thing that people do.  But I don't really see a point in not allowing links if you can just search for the title in whatever sub it's in through the info on an uncensored picture, or even just search through the persons profile."
quityourbullshit,3dbj9l,Stevenson_The_Last,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:08:55 2015 UTC,"And the same logic applies to the fact that, if by the rules np links are fine, then there's no reason for usernames to be censored. No point censoring them when you can link to the threads anyway.   People just censor the usernames, either out of courtesy or just to be sure they don't break the rules. I've got no issue if people do though, sometimes it's better to be safe than sorry.  That said, in all the time I've been here and with all the np links, or easily findable/poorly censored posts, I don't think I've ever seen downvote brigading from this sub. Usually the Reddit posts that make it to here are already massively negative, due to the nature of having their bullshit called."

Each time, it was stated Voat is working on its infrastructure to make sure it doesn't go down again... until it went down again. It can't compete with reddit until it can handle people actually using the site.  Other than that, it's pretty much set up exactly like reddit with supposedly less rules.

I ended up in hospital because a cafe assumed I was making up my milk allergy (actually milk allergy not lactose intolerance) because its rare and they gave me contaminated food.

quityourbullshit,3d9ut6,crybannanna,82,Tue Jul 14 17:14:14 2015 UTC,The difference between a disease and an allergy isn't a minute detail.   Nor is the difference between having a legitimate disorder and a psychosomatic one.
quityourbullshit,3d9ut6,Apocalypticoreo,9,Tue Jul 14 17:23:19 2015 UTC,"Or being celiac, but thinking you're allergic and therefore not seeking treatment."
quityourbullshit,3d9ut6,AwesomerOrsimer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:01:58 2015 UTC,"What's the difference between the two? Eat gluten > have adverse effects, right? I don't know too much about the disease, but surely the difference isn't that relevant when asked ""can you eat gluten?"""
quityourbullshit,3d9ut6,crybannanna,4,Fri Jul 17 15:07:35 2015 UTC,"Gluten intolerance is like lactose intolerance. Certain foods ""don't agree"" with people but do not create an allergic reaction.   For allergies can be very serious and deadly. People with peanut butter allergies can die from it.  People with lactose intolerance just fart a lot (or whatever).   It's about severity and immediacy of condition more than anything else. Though it's also about factual accuracy. A dietary intolerance isn't an allergy, it's a different reaction. Requires different treatment.  Most people have a bad reaction to a bee sting (it hurts and can swell up a bit)... But some people have an allergy to bee stings and can die.   Some people have ulcerative colitis. It's a condition of the bowels that make it hard to digest certain foods and really problematic if they attempt it. They have to avoid a bunch of stuff or they get sick.... But it's not an allergy."
quityourbullshit,3d9ut6,AwesomerOrsimer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:09:29 2015 UTC,"Though it's also about factual accuracy.    I see what you're saying, but for all intents and purposes, a person with a gluten intolerance still can't eat a slice of bread without becoming sick - I see more people complaining about semantics than anything else."
quityourbullshit,3d9ut6,crybannanna,5,Fri Jul 17 18:15:30 2015 UTC,"I guess it's semantics, but medically it's sort of an important distinction.   If I were to say that I'm allergic to the flu, most people would call me stupid. I'm still sick from the flu, but an allergy is a specific condition not just a term for all illness.   It takes no greater effort to be correct than to be incorrect in this case. It just takes the ability to quit bullshitting."

The worst part about her, though, is that she's really sneaky about it, and knows that it's partially bullshit, she's just in it for the trendy-aspect.  For example, she pressured her three daughters to be vegan, and then, when we were all together as a family during Christmas, we bought some hot chocolate at a stall and her daughters looked like they wanted some.  Of course, if you don't drink milk for a few months, and then suddenly drink a big cup of it, you're gonna have a bad time.   When we got home, I overheard her telling her daughters, who were running in and out of the bathroom, ""That's why I told you that milk and things from animals aren't good for you.""  Ooo....having to allow bullshit because it wasn't my house and I had been asked to ignore it...it hurt me so much.  Because of her I have a very negative image of diet trends. There are actual human beings that fake this shit just so they can hang out with other miserable people who fake it as well.

quityourbullshit,3d9ut6,probeater,5,Tue Jul 14 19:29:13 2015 UTC,"I'm too lazy to do any thorough research but the body of work supporting a gluten sensitivity that is neither related to Celiac or a wheat allergy is pretty shaky, a cursory glance found only a few, small studies that seemed to show any correlation, and I didn't see anyone with any solid ideas as far as causation."
quityourbullshit,3d9ut6,Zephaerus,8,Tue Jul 14 21:30:28 2015 UTC,"Just to play Devil's Advocate, that doesn't mention anything about it not being the nocebo effect. The Facebook post did link to something showing that a lot of people were encountering psychosomatic problems and didn't actually have any sensitivity to gluten.  Also, NCGS specifically means you don't have a Wheat allergy or Celiac disease. They literally define it as Gluten sensitivity unrelated to Wheat allergy or CD. Please read what you're linking to.   there is a group of patients whose symptoms have disappeared with gluten withdrawal from diet and they are not affected with either celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy (WA) [7]. The first case reports of NCGS in children were described in 2012 [8].  NCGS can be diagnosed in those patients with gluten intolerance who do not develop antibodies that are typical neither of CD nor of WA and who do not suffer from lesions in the duodenal mucosa, which is characteristic of CD   The pedantic argument is sound, though still very pedantic."

quityourbullshit,3d2e9l,Khnagar,31,Mon Jul 13 15:30:53 2015 UTC,"some people who are repost karma whores do it because they're paid to.  they earn a bunch of karma on an account so that it's a ""trusted member of the community"" and then they sell the account to companies' PR departments to use for viral marketing.  and then some people just like to wrack up points for no reason."

I believe that alot of karma whores act in the way that they do just because it gives them a sense of purpose or some sort validation. Sorta like the way people who think that having the fastest car makes them a better person, or having the most Facebook friends. They need to find a justification."
quityourbullshit,3d2e9l,Negromancers,34,Mon Jul 13 07:15:40 2015 UTC,"If you frequent /r/movies, /r/TIL, /r/funny or /r/pics/ or other major subreddits you must have noticed the amount of funny pictures, anecdotes, stories and facts about actors that sometimes flood the site just as the PR storm for a major new release by this or that actor is happening.  Before the release of Guardians Of the Galaxy and Jurassic Park some subreddits were flooded with Chris Pratt related images and imgur links to funny bits with him on Parks and Rec's. A lot of the posts were from brand new accounts, and often they'd be upvoted to the top really, really fast. Two weeks after Guardians of the Galaxy had premiered there were just a few of them posted.   Or the amount of dogs overjoyed to meet their owners back from  military service overseas, posted in /r/videos. From brand new accounts on youtube, and it's the only video ever posted there. Often posted with a new reddit account.  Or if you browse /r/news you might notice the upvote/downvote patterns of some stories, and how that changes from the weekends to monday-friday.  I'm not suggesting all of these posts are planted for PR purposes. But some clearly are. It's not like Putin with his offices with hundreds of workers doing nothing but trying to influence opinions online. But the US military organisations and large corporations are spending a lot of money trying to influence social media, and it'd be silly to think that it does not happen on reddit to a certain degree."
quityourbullshit,3d2e9l,theBERZERKER13,9,Mon Jul 13 08:07:31 2015 UTC,Not to mention Bernie fucking Sanders.
quityourbullshit,3d2e9l,thesecoloursdontrun,4,Mon Jul 13 09:36:47 2015 UTC,"This.   I even like the guy, but the high number of people talking about him, and how it comes in waves, seems suspect."
quityourbullshit,3d2e9l,Khnagar,6,Mon Jul 13 13:27:31 2015 UTC,"Again, I'm not arguing for or against any of these claims. I'm just trying to wrap my head around it. But I always figured the reason that top reaching posts about actors/politicians/famous entities gained traction around the same time that these people were in the news was because of that exact thing.   Oh Jurassic World is coming out? Lemme Wikipedia that... Chris Pratt is the star, let's look at his page... Oh he does this or that.. Let's post it to reddit!"
quityourbullshit,3d2e9l,deadlypinfish,8,Mon Jul 13 09:31:54 2015 UTC,It's called having a good PR team.
quityourbullshit,3d2e9l,Jablon15,3,Mon Jul 13 09:44:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah.   A better way of putting it would probably be to say that companies and organisations spend a lot of money and effort to influence social media to promote a product, brand or point of view. I don't think anyone will argue that they aren't doing that.  It's safe to assume the same companies and organisations are also spending time and money trying to do the same thing on reddit.  How they are doing that and how successful they are is of course something that can be argued about."
quityourbullshit,3d2e9l,Boracho_Station,2,Mon Jul 13 10:28:45 2015 UTC,Can't this also be because people are starting learn about an actor and want to hop on the band wagon? Like I've noticed every single time a tv show comes to Netflix we get hit with the panels and text of a joke.
quityourbullshit,3d2e9l,ChainedProfessional,25,Mon Jul 13 15:32:50 2015 UTC,People like this boggle my mind. I actually feel sorry for them.

quityourbullshit,3d2yrp,Surilliar,3,Mon Jul 13 03:46:35 2015 UTC,"I'm sure the German government does it's own fair share of citizen shitting. Actually overall he is fairly happy with the government at the moment, apart from their attitude to the EU. Anyway, with dual citizenship he doesn't have to worry about which he wants to use so that's good.   If I were his biological son like 2 of my brothers are, I would definitely get a German passport as well (they only have UK at the moment). Quite useful I think."
quityourbullshit,3d2yrp,dannycdannydo,3,Mon Jul 13 04:00:19 2015 UTC,"As passports go the UK passport is just about the best, as it allows free passage to more countries than any other passport (also there is no issue with dual nationality).  EDIT: Just checked and it looks like the German passport has the same number of visa free travel countries, so I guess it is equally as good!"

They concluded Swedish was the best but only because it was slightly cheaper to get than the others...  Edit: Although having said that, I know of at least 1 example where the UK has an advantage. In HK British passport holders get up to 6 months visa free (I think), whereas others only get half that. Don't know if there are other countries where this happens as well."

It can be based on citizenship, at which point it does matter who your ancestors were. Let's say hypothetically that Obama was born somewhere other than the United States, he would still be considered to be a natural born citizen because his mother was an American citizen.   It can also be based on cultural requirements, which then becomes very difficult because of how much culture can vary across a country. It's very difficult to define what an American is ethnically, because it's the ""great mixing pot"". If you base the culture that is located in one geographic area, e.g. the South, New England, West Coast, you exclude a huge portion of Americans. Therefore, most people rely on the commonly held ideals to answer the question of ""what is an American?"", e.g. the rights embodied in the Bill of Rights, or handed down through the common law system (all people are equal)."

The real change is how seamlessly and without thought a picture can be uploaded to the Internet.   I can't decide if it comes with age or not. Or if it is a standard of all youth. But as I think about it, I remember when the Internet was young and it was largely considered an innocent amusement. We learned quick enough that if you are not careful it can have far reaching consequences. Now we understand that all too well.   Here's the thing. The youth of today in many places has completely failed to understand this concept. I mean totally missed it in the most spectacular way. Now that it's all the more a pressing concern, they seem even less aware of the danger. I have family that works at my old high school and the children were all outfitted with Ipads. As I understand it the system works pretty well. The whole school runs off of apple basically and I've seen it put to use where they can do presentations automatically with the projector systems. Nifty stuff. The downside is these kids use these Ipads and all the linked accounts to share naked pictures. Make drug deals. Openly discuss all of the various wrongs they are committing. While actively doing them.   Guess what. When they got the fucking Ipads. Every single one of them signed an agreement saying that the school was permitted to observe any data transmitted on the iPad, as they are school property. And that they did. These idiots went on a school trip and were making live posts about how drunk they were getting and all the sex they were having. The principal was able to track the posts and every single kid involved was pulled and faced punishment.   The best part is they all assumed it was another kid that reported them. Everyone was told exactly what the deal was when they got these tablets. But they are oblivious. The girls seem hell bent on taking as many nudes as they can. The boys make a game of trading them.  Dont get me wrong. This is not new. But it's never been this widespread and systemic, nor considered normal. And there almost seems to be an understanding or acceptance that your nudes will be leaked. Shared. Posted on the Internet. And etc. Like that's just how it is now.   I would have thought this generation would have been raised to understand the risks. But it seems the alternative is the case. Even with full disclosure as to the risks, they push the bar much further than when we assumed it was all innocent and nothing could go wrong."

Take snapchat for example, most people I know think it's %100 secure and that pictures taken can't be saved because that's how the product is marketed. I knew right away it wasn't secure because the very act of displaying the picture on your device means there is a way to save it.  I see people taking dumb pictures like them smoking weed and putting it on snapchat without even thinking that this could come back to bit them in the ass."

Kids aren't known for their risk aversion and level-headedness. Kids do dumb things for no reason, especially when they know the danger, and when consequences happen they try to defer the blame to something/someone else.   I would have thought this generation would have been raised to understand the risks.   The internet has become like any other utility; it's there, it's useful, and people born with it take it for granted. If you grew up with the internet being ubiquitous, it's not something to be revered and handled carefully like someone who remembers dial-up. I sure as hell don't know how indoor plumbing works, or how to change the spark plug on my car, or how to change a blown fuse in my house; but that's because those are common everyday utilities that everyone grew up with. I'm not an expert on how modern conveniences work, because i grew up with them. They're not special, to me. Same with people who grew up with internet-connected phones; it's not special to them."

Worked his way up through the military. Got through all the difficult tests and for years was a model member of the military.   Except 1 problem. He was a semi popular Csgo streamer (I think that was the game). And in college he had used a website to film himself masturbating for a little cash. Neither was a problem until someone went digging and found his video on the Internet and sent it to his CO. It was a disaster. Long story short he was out. No more possibility he could fly.

They trade the fleeting satisfaction or whatever they get out of it now for the potential shit storm of later without ever considering it may have far reaching consequences.   The thing here is you've never been in the position of being targeted. When the shoe is on the other foot. When someone really maliciously goes after you for whatever reason, it doesn't matter if 'you were being free and expressing yourself'. There's still consequences. You still have to deal with that for potentially years afterwards.   The Internet doesn't go away. It is frozen in stone. For the duration of our lives without question. And access to data will only become more simple. More detailed. Peoples ability to manipulate it to direct future inquiries about you to unwanted things will continue to evolve. I just want people to be smart. If you're going to do it think about what you are doing. The guy or girl you met 30 minutes ago and fell in love with may not always be on your side.   And let's not forget that there's next to nothing you can do should someone be so inclined to find their way into your Icloud or whatever. As we saw in that massive data dump aka the fappening. Yes it was just celebrities. But such is the reality we face now.   The bottom line is. You are trying to paint this as if being smart is living in fear.

Also, I'm pretty sure someone could even spin the comment I'm responding to in a way that would make you seem like an asshat (which you're kind of acting like right now, but I get that this is a difficult thing to grasp and explain).   You don't have to share nudes. You don't have to be a Nazi sympathizer. The kind of people that hold office and need to really worry about people ""taking them down"" aren't the antisocial type. They're going to post comments and share pics and participate in the internet culture like everyone else. No, they aren't going to ""go sharing that shit with every person"" they meet, but nobody actually does that. People don't want their private pictures leaked, but it's likely many kids don't understand or care about the risks that come with posting or sharing provocative pictures.  And that's the core of the problem- these kids have grown up with the internet and don't see it as something dangerous OR are just doing what the other kids do and don't want to think it's really a problem. Ideally there would be better education about this, but I'm starting to believe that if sharing nude or semi-nude pictures of yourself is this widespread then eventually we may need to just get over it.  You weren't being called a coward for not sharing nudes. What u/realigion said was that controlling your expression in general for fear of some possible Orwellian repercussion is cowardly. It's not just about sharing nudes, it's about not being afraid to say what you really think about something as well. Should you call someone else retarded or equate everyone that shares a nude picture to someone who is unreasonable and unintelligent? Not if you care about anyone seeing your internet activity and judging you for it. But you should say it because who the fuck cares? What are the chances of someone giving a shit what you did online?

It's not being a dumbass. I'm sorry I don't care how many times I have to say it. It is simply how I say.   You keep saying well.. If everyone does it it won't ever have consequences. Bullshit. Lots of people do it. There's lots of instances where it fucks people over. It is what it is. I stress again go for it if you feel so inclined. But be aware that people like to fuck each other over.

Still for fighter pilots its no joke. YOu have to be top tier, clean as a whistle, no question. It would require far less to have you booted from the program."
quityourbullshit,3cz6ra,Raincoats_George,6,Sun Jul 12 17:27:24 2015 UTC,Seems really dumb for something like that to keep you from being a fighter pilot not like that makes him mentally unstable or something.
quityourbullshit,3cz6ra,Thedominateforce,3,Sun Jul 12 17:56:54 2015 UTC,There is an excellent documentary series on a (i dont know if its the only one or not) Canadian fighter pilot school. These men and women are held to the most intense standard. They take tests where in certain sections if they miss any question they risk being removed from the program. Obviously its for good reason. But it just shows how easily you can get cut from the program.

It wasn't really until I was in my 30s that they became even vaguely common.  As a result, there is virtually zero pictorial evidence of the shenanigans I got up to, for which I am grateful.  There are probably some actual photos in somebody's loft, but nothing digital, that's for sure.

quityourbullshit,3cz6ra,CupcakeValkyrie,15,Mon Jul 13 04:39:14 2015 UTC,"Nonsense. Things like cleavage, exposed midriff, short shorts/exposed legs have been commonplace for decades, even amongst teens.  And I'm not even taking into consideration things like the mods and rockabillies of the 50s and 60s, the hippies, stoners, rockers and early metalheads of the 70s and then the punks and glam styles of the 80s, and the emerging hip-hop styles of the 90s. You could even go back to the 20s and 30s with the flapper styles.   Subcultures offered provocative styles without necessarily being exposing and if anything, I'd say we actually lack more distinct subculture styles now than we did back then.   And just look at the OP picture again. Are those girls dressed especially provocatively? Not really. One of them is literally in a tanktop and jeans, a combination that has been popular for decades and the other has exposed midriff and that's it. And from what I can tell they're both wearing relatively common/popular styles of clothing.   Provocative clothing (revealing or otherwise) is nothing new."

The cynic in me that is me says that he wouldn't be as revered if he hadn't died in such a tragic way. Same as Kurt Cobain, Bob Marley, Layne Staley etc. All undoubtedly great musicians and undoubtedly influential in their respective genres but because they died young in tragic circumstances they're elevated to almost a martyr figure and placed on a pedestal, and if anyone dares to have an opinion other than ""they were the best ever"" then they're chased out of town with torches and pitchforks.

The confederacy existed for such a brief period, and literally all it was was ""we want slaves, we're committing treason."" People who say it's a part of their ""culture"" are full of it - sure, the flag might be a (bad) part of their culture but the confederacy isn't.

My Pizza Hut had a rule requiring everyone be at work those days, like, the entire staff."
quityourbullshit,3cshjl,cwearly1,14,Fri Jul 10 15:34:46 2015 UTC,"Well currently working at Pizza Hut, and having worked the past 3 Super Bowl's, it's not that hard to figure out how many pizzas that is (for my (small) store).  Typically for SB we sell around 4-5 grand of product. Low, I know. The larger stores are around 6-7 grand.  Now if we're looking at an average of $12 a pizza, then we're looking at 333.333--> 333/416 pizzas. But, that's not including drinks, appetizers, desserts, etc. But more than likely the non-pizza products probably sum to around $800.  So now we're looking at 266/350 pizzas. But for the average store it is a little bit higher than that.  To be honest it really depends on your region and the store's output of pizzas, but I'd say on average a ""Super Bowl"" worth of pizza, for an average Pizza Hut, is 350-400 pizzas.    Of course, after some Googling, it appears that PH typically sells/predicts to sell 2 million pizzas per Super Bowl. And with over 6000 stores in the US (which I predict sell 99% of SB pizzas, even though another 6000 stores are international), then the more official amount of ""Super Bowl"" pizzas turns into roughly ~350 pizzas.  350 pizzas. That's one for every day of the year (almost), and if they're just cheese pizzas, then that's just shy of 1 million calories. (Which means that if every slice is eaten on Super Bowl, then over 6 trillion Billion calories are consumed just through PH pizzas.)  Well that was fun :) Have a great day!

quityourbullshit,3cshjl,Bucsfan499,65,Fri Jul 10 16:26:42 2015 UTC,"Well, I can't tell you exactly, my daughter is only 7 so I'm not sure if I'm even doing it right yet. What I can say is build empathy. This is what I try to do. We feed the homeless, we do toy drives for poor children, we collect food for kids with cancer and I always point out people on the street that are begging for money and explain how lucky we are, and yes, I give them a few bucks. We do all this while I try to get her to understand that some people have nothing. I think this country is suffering from a serious lack of caring for our fellow man, I am desperately trying to instill it in my daughter. Hope this helps."

quityourbullshit,3cshjl,GetHisWallet,16,Sat Jul 11 14:10:58 2015 UTC,"You can't.  You have to go after the dad.  I'm fighting the opposite situation here.  I have a 1-year old son and I'm a complete asshole.  The thing is, I'm self-aware and actively fight my instincts around others, trying to be a nice guy.  I have to consistently set the example for my kid and pray he never notices that I'm naturally combative.  Sometimes I rule people out as nobodies and I just let loose around them, but I can't ever let up around my kid.  I have to always be the person that I want him to be.  He has to see that at all times.  I can never let up until he himself is established.  He's making me a better person if nothing but so that he will be a better person.  That dad needs to understand this.  He needs to know that the world doesn't need another piece of shit."
quityourbullshit,3cshjl,abbeyrogue,23,Fri Jul 10 16:31:52 2015 UTC,"The dad is a big problem. This kid was a huge accident and he has 3 other full grown kids (19+) so he's written this one off. His favourite thing to do is get her hopes up that he will spend time with her and then keep her waiting on our front porch for hours. We'll tell her to come inside and she will insist on waiting because ""he promised"". The very rare times she sees him she absorbs the things she tells him like a sponge.   We are court mandated to provide him parental rights when he is available, so we work something out and he ditches. The law is never on the fosters side though, so he keeps all his 'rights'. It's really quite frustrating.   But you, I like you. I only wish that her father would take the same care and consideration and realize that he needs to work on himself around his daughter for her future."
quityourbullshit,3cshjl,GetHisWallet,8,Fri Jul 10 16:38:28 2015 UTC,"Have you tried at least mentioning it?  Are we simply assuming that he doesn't care about her?  And if so, if he's written her off entirely... maybe someone should ask him why he still exercises any parental rights?"
quityourbullshit,3cshjl,abbeyrogue,17,Fri Jul 10 16:46:04 2015 UTC,"We've been pretty blunt with him about his parenting with her, but I think he exercises his rights because he likes to cause us grief. He knows her life would be better without his drunk ass, but he refuses to go away because I think this kid is probably the only person in the entire world that is excited to see him.  We know he doesn't care about her because he has said so (and varying levels of sobriety). Direct quotes include statements like ""I already have 1 boy and 2 girls, I didn't need another of either"", and when the child asked in front of us ""daddy why don't you want to spend time with me"" he said ""I figured I would be done parenting but then you came along and fucked that up. Now I have to pretend like I give a shit"".  Yea, it's swell and dandy. But since he doesn't' miss his court dates and always shows up to the appointments when a Social Worker oversees the kid swap, he keeps his rights."
quityourbullshit,3cshjl,caicosdog,4,Fri Jul 10 17:07:42 2015 UTC,"my dads a piece of crap, sometimes I'm glad he just bailed. It would have hurt so much more if he stayed around just To torture me and get my hopes up. He visited me once when I was around 6 and we started building a Lego spaceship together. That was the last time I saw him and that half built Lego ship still collects dust in my closet. I want plan on finishing it with my kids one day, and he won't get the satisfaction of seeing the glorious ship we started in its final form. His loss, really. You seem like a really good parent, this kid needs someone like you in her life and I'm glad you're supporting her. As long as she knows you're there for her, it'll cushion the blow when he decides to finally drop off completely, which will hopefully be soon for everyone's sake.

It took a bit of growing up to realize life is so much better without him around.  But she's 9. And It sucked when I went through the ups and downs of negative parenting so to watch another person do it when I remember the feelings, it's going to be harder this time around. And since we only have her for temporary care at the moment it'll be really hard when her mother finally gets back on her feet and gains full guardianship. Her mother is our family, and she is having a bit of a mental crisis - seeking appropriate help at a mental help facility. She rescinded guardianship to our province/us by requesting us as fosters - here we are today! It's been a whirlwind of the last year, that's for sure. I still don't know how everything works.  Thank you for the compliments :) It's really hard parenting kids that aren't yours but I would like to think I'm doing a good job. They have a safe place to sleep, food in their bellies and people to care for them, which is really all you need I think."

He's great when the social workers are there but when it's a free visit he's a jerk."

quityourbullshit,3cshjl,Forgot_Last_Password,9,Fri Jul 10 14:43:34 2015 UTC,"Why did his dad's work get involved in it?'   This is probably going to sound like bullshit but something very similar actually happened to my mother with chick-fil-a. She went to a new chick-fil-a on its opening day during her lunch break on its opening day and two young employees, one in a mascot suit and another guiding him, decided that the mascot suit guy was going into the bed of my mother's pickup truck and he'd ride in it on the main road for a bit. This is obviously insane, illegal and makes no sense at all. So my mother argued them down and when she got back to work she called in to complain to the store manager and in that conversation indicated that she was at work and she'd gone on her lunch break. The store manager apologized profusely and offered to cater her work's breakroom when she wanted in the future. And he followed through about a week later. Her work probably had about 75-125 employees too.   That said, obviously the pizza story is fake. But things like that have actually happened at least once before."
quityourbullshit,3cshjl,maninorbit,14,Fri Jul 10 16:16:34 2015 UTC,"This might have just been a bit of good fortune on the part of your mother. Think of it from chick-Gil-a's stand point. Brand new franchise needs to establish a customer base. Giving free food to an office if over 100 people gets the word out to that entire building (plus anyone they talk to in nearby office buildings) quickly. The new franchise was probably planning on giving away a similar sized platter at a nearby event to advertise and just adjusted fire when an opportunity to appeal to a large number of people who work nearby every day arose.   Alternatively, being a new store the workers would need experience catering an event in the near future, why not gain that experience in an environment where the customers didn't have to pay? The venue would be filled with much less stress then one in which the food was paid for.  From the managers stand point he appealed to a new customer base, provided relatively stress free training for his inexperienced staff, and could laugh off a story about inexperienced workers while rewarding a woman who probably saved him from a law suit and an injured employee. Good on him."

Or do people not do jager bombs in vegas like we do in the uk? Standard glass of coke red bull drop a shot full of jager glass and all into the coke red bull glass and then drink it in one.  I'm not even certain I could drink a yard of coke red bull, it would probably make me feel sicker than drinking a yard of beer. Also while we are on the subject, what the fuck is a yard in terms of drink size? I'm just imagining a standard pint glass that is a yard long. How much liquid is in a yard and why are you mixing units of distance and volume up, isn't the imperial system fucked up enough as it is?  So many questions, so little time."

I imagine the person who wrote this story is 14 years old and has only heard of Jäg Bombs in passing.  Quick edit: to answer your question, I refer you to Google.

quityourbullshit,3cshjl,jiggabot,15,Fri Jul 10 16:25:07 2015 UTC,"There is no thirty minute delivery guarantee anymore.  Know why?  Despite company policy not to harangue drivers for being late the managers and the drivers of one store in Michigan gave a driver a hard time about his lates. This was in the late 1980's  So the kid (he was in his late teens) gets a pizza run, jumps in his car and speeds off to get the pizza delivered on time.  He was killed in an accident. His mother sued Domino's Pizza and won.  A Federal Judge said, ""That is the end of the thirty minute guarantee.""  If these idiots had honored the carry out guarantee they would have given away a few bread sticks.  Dumb motherfuckers."
quityourbullshit,3cshjl,Meebert,9,Fri Jul 10 21:55:14 2015 UTC,"Wow.  I wonder how many pizzas the mother won from Domino's for the lawsuit.  If an order of breadsticks equates to 150 pizzas, a human life has to be worth somewhere in the six figures of pizzas."
quityourbullshit,3cshjl,xoites,3,Fri Jul 10 18:35:39 2015 UTC,Another factor is 30 minutes is literally impossible to make happen on busy holidays and days where there is severe weather. If orders were free after 30 minutes the entire super bowl would be a raid where hundreds of people order pizza knowing the store is so fucked that you are guaranteed free pizza.
quityourbullshit,3cshjl,Meebert,3,Fri Jul 10 20:01:26 2015 UTC,"No, that is not really how it worked. Between 1985 and 1989 I worked for the busiest Domino's Pizza in the world in Towson, Maryland just north of and including a small part of Baltimore City.  This was in the early heyday of pizza delivery when there was just one company really into doing it right.  When I started there were 75 drivers on the payroll, two managers, five managers in training and thirty inside staff people.  We had two 200 pie hours back to back on Friday nights and i once saw two 300 pie hours which we handled with one late with a much smaller staff a couple years later.  Human beings are organized creatures and they practice what they do and they get better at it if they want to.  Most of our pizzas came out of the oven eight minutes after they were ordered and the farthest place from the front door doing the speed limit was twenty minutes away.  We staffed up for big events and we did quite well."
quityourbullshit,3cshjl,xoites,3,Sat Jul 11 01:25:17 2015 UTC,"See that's how a store that size should be run, the store I work for has three managers total, three ovens and maybe 20 drivers. It gets to be a cluster fuck on busy days because the store is over capacity. Some people think labor management is seeing how few people you can use to get the job barely done."

quityourbullshit,3crb3v,serenewaffles,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:06:06 2015 UTC,Ok. Still. Labor Participation Rate. Love that metric. Because it is simple and measures something really useful.
quityourbullshit,3crb3v,Dishevel,3,Fri Jul 10 16:14:48 2015 UTC,"""The labor force participation rate is the share of the civilian population over age 15 that is either working or searching for work.""1  The labor force participation rate is thus impacted by a number of factors:   Increases and decreases in the population Increases and decreases in the number of retired persons of working age Increases and decreases in the number of stay at home parents Increases and decreases in the number of persons attending school   This list is by no means meant to be exhaustive.  Furthermore, as with the elimination of unemployment, full participation in the labor force is not necessarily a good thing. A certain amount of unemployment is necessary for improving an economy: a non-zero unemployment rate indicates new entrants into the jobs market, re-entrants, and people looking for a better job. All of these things help to improve the economy. Were there no unemployed persons, companies would have a hell of a time trying to expand their offerings. They would be required to increase the number of tasks performed without increasing the employees available to perform them.  Returning to the labor force participation rate, maxing it out at 100% wouldn't be that great. First, it would mean that no one is retiring. Retirement provides some pretty large benefits for the economy. As workers retire, positions are opened. This creates places for new workers to enter the workforce. If no one retired, college graduates would be having an even more difficult time of finding work.  Second, it would mean that no one over age 15 is attending school. While that would certainly work for some people and by no means do I mean to suggest, imply, state, or otherwise indicate that a higher education is either necessary or wasteful in any individual case, it would really hurt our prospects for growing our economy. Why start a company in a place that requires you to import educated workers when you can start that company where your workers already are? It would also be pretty difficult to staff hospitals. If no one is continuing on to higher education, it's going to be difficult to find doctors, nurses, etc. This would also lower the number of lawyers, however, which would probably be a good thing (I kid......mostly).  Third, it would mean that no one has left the workforce to raise children. (Shout out to working parents! You da MVPs!) While being a working parent is definitely a viable path, there are a number of working parents who would love to be able to stay at home and raise their children full time (shout out to stay at home parents! You da MVPs!). However, with our 100% labor participation rate, that's not an option. The reason why it's not an option is irrelevant.  All this is to say that the labor force participation rate is not the be-all and end-all statistic for examining the economy. Any such narrow view is going to have gaping holes, whether your view is based on the unemployment rate or the labor force participation rate or the gold exchange rate or the frame rate. It doesn't matter what your statistic is if it's the only one you're looking at.    1) The Labor Force Participation Rate Since 2007: Causes and Policy Implications Page 6"
quityourbullshit,3crb3v,serenewaffles,0,Fri Jul 10 16:58:27 2015 UTC,"Never said that you would want the rate to be near 100%. A larger or smaller population has an effect. Of course it would. If you labor market fails to grow with the population the labor participation rate will go down. Are you saying that makes it inaccurate or less useful? That rate is affected by everything. It should be. Many more people claiming ""Disabilities"" that in the past would be laughed at? Counted in labor participation rate. As it should be.   Lots of people emigrating to the country with no corresponding rise in jobs making employment more difficult to find? Counted in labor participation rate. As it should be.     Job market shitty with bad pay so people closer to retirement give up and leave early? Counted in labor participation rate. As it should be.     Many people leaving the job market because they only worked to get insurance and now they can get coverage for free if they do not work? Counted in labor participation rate. As it should be.     Just because something works out for a person does not mean it is good for society. Lower than normal labor participation rates that do not cause labor shortages that increase wages and then increase the labor participation rate are bad. Lower percentages of people working and the labor market itself shrinking is an issue.  You do not want people retiring earlier. Lots of people leaving the job market early (Not paying taxes) to start collecting SS benefits when the participation rate is low causes an increase of tax burden on a smaller work force. 4 to 5 years things are going to be worse than they are now by far. I tell you this. I would not want to be winning the next Presidential election.  The next POTUS is going to be hated.

quityourbullshit,3crb3v,savage_nobility,2,Fri Jul 10 04:17:15 2015 UTC,"The reported unemployment rate that currently hovers around five to six per cent measures the number of people who are not working and looking for a job. The effect of this way of measuring is that if people get discouraged and stop looking for a job (because presumably they are able to get by somehow without one, but would prefer to work) the unemployment rate goes down without jobs being added. This absolutely happened during the recession, particularly among an aging population that retired a few years earlier than they normally would have and families that normally would have two people on the work force but were settling on one paycheck.   So some anti-Obama people have claimed that the drastic decrease in unemployment during the Obama administration is a mirage. They also point to statistics showing people are ""underemployed,"" meaning that if the economy was better they would have better jobs, but are settling in the current market. Basically it's bullshit to say that the unemployment rate is twenty per cent, and bullshit-ish to say that the five per cent unemployment is reflective of a booming and healthy economy."

Regardless it got changed to make numbers look better. http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11300000 So that is a BLS chart chowing labor participation rate. If your working people are not working, bad things happen. Production and GDP will go down. I am not female so I have no idea how they feel. But I feel like shit (depressed) if I am unable to work for a period of time. (Even if my bills are getting paid) Most men I know are the same. Large numbers of bored, depressed men with too much time on their hands is bad as well. Men (No idea about women) need to feel productive in the workforce. The country needs a large workforce to stay healthy. We have a very low rate here and that (politics aside) hurts us."
quityourbullshit,3crb3v,ZedHeadFred,2,Fri Jul 10 16:09:54 2015 UTC,Going by the actual bls statistics might be better.  http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000  Seems 5.5% is a pretty close average of 2015 so far.
quityourbullshit,3crb3v,Dishevel,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:23:46 2015 UTC,Labor participation rate is the best measure. It all other metrics are picked for what is convenient to the current administration. Even if you are not going to use labor participation rates using any metric other than U6 is really a lie. Everyone in U6 plus more people think they are unemployed.
quityourbullshit,3crb3v,JurgisRedux,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:03:16 2015 UTC,U6 counts marginally attached and part time workers. It also counts from the age of 16.

Jobs for young people to learn work ethic makes for a much better society. First jobs are very important. Which is why minimum wage laws have some bad effects.

Came back a week later, our first sergeant went and picked him up after he called them. First sergeant took him out to dinner, and talked with him for a while. Apparently the guy just had a lot of shit going on and used the whole Wiccan thing to basically zonk out on life. Pretty sad actually. They let him stay to the end of basic, but then they sent him home.

Plenty of generations had those.  Insane Clown Posse? Nope, mostly faded as well.   I thought it might be polyamory, but now I'm starting to wonder, will it actually be other-kin? Will there be otherkin sitins? Laws agains wearing costumes in public? Fights to be able to go to work as such? Will cosmetic surgery and other body modifications become more common? Forked tongues, sub-dermal scales, spinal modifications?   If this happens more and more, where will I stand? Will I ridicule the passionately different? Or will I hold signs calling them unnatural?

All the kitchen staff of the restaurant I worked at gamed, and told me how notoriously hard it was. I popped it in and played for about an hour before I was just confused and frustrated and gave up.   Then, last week I was home for vacation, and after seeing a bunch of Bloodborne LetsPlays, I decided to give Dark Souls another shot. Holy shit! In 5 days I put over 40 hours into it, and time not spent playing was usually spent looking up game mechanics and stats. I got to Quelaag, killed her, then got lost in BlightTown before the end of my vacation and had to stop playing.   For the past couple days I've been watching speedruns and Let'sPlays (I can barely comprehend the plot, so I don't care too much about spoilers) and I can't believe there was still over half the game to go! And it's so amazingly designed and detailed and the sense of progress is insane, and I've never played a game that I only began to understand after 8 hours of playing!  All that is to say that I am a new fan, and want to play all of the Souls games, and obnoxiously bring them up at every opportunity."

I was fat, didn't have friends, got bullied, had dysphoria, was sexually repressed because I was afraid to come out,  I really just hated life as a human.  I spent a lot of time on the Internet (not like I had friends) and I stumbled upon these people. I always thought dragons were pretty cool, but more importantly it provided a mental escape for me. I could keep telling myself it would get better, that I would be a dragon again someday. That I only had to put up with this shitty human reality for so long until I was ""me"" again. I even had a really elaborate dragon back story based off of dreams I started to have, in which I was a dragon.  It never worked out though, nothing ever did happen and no matter how much I told myself I was a dragon, I knew I was lying. I knew I was afraid that it was a lie, because than I'd have to be me again, and I hated me. Eventually I broke out of it, I realized that my life would only ever get better if I made it better, so that's what I did. I still think dragons are really cool though"

quityourbullshit,3chib3,liskoturri,5,Wed Jul 8 02:03:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what happened to me, but after my third burn-out I could feel how a part of my brain was fried permanently. I just wasn't myself anymore. Someone who once was a social person who loved partying, seeing people and was a president of two clubs, I turned into a social recluse who had developed what was first diagnosed as major depression, then as a bipolar depression, with some other problems like panic attacks and anxiety. I couldn't even stand bright lights, loud sounds, smells and touch anymore.  So anyway, I got into therapy. Got these meds so I could get back in shape. The first weeks were kinda weird as I started having weird delusions or hallucinations of having a tail, horns and wings. I could feel them. I was kinda scared at first but then realized how euphoric it felt so I kept my mouth shut. Of course I knew I was a human being, but somehow my wish of being a dragon got mixed up with the side effects and apparently re-wired my brain to me thinking I'm actually a dragon inside.   I'm an engineer and would never ever believed in this bullshit had it not happened to me. I thought furries and other guys who thought they are actually animals were weird as fuck (I'm fine with fursuits and so as long as you don't pretend you're actually a dog and bark at me something). At some point I found about otherkin forums but noped the hell out of there as those are full of really fucked up people, on a level I haven't even seen some furries reach.  It's been couple of years now. I've since got new medication which has pretty much destroyed the effects I had couple of years ago, but has a positive effect on my health. The panic attacks have turned into ""slow"" anxiety attacks which have about half a hour of ""early warning"" before the effects set in, so I've got plenty of time to get home or some place silent. I can make do with 7 to 9 hours of sleep, instead of 14 or so I slept when I was seriously ill. I've lost weight. I'm a perfectly functional human being who has a career and healthy hobbies. Friends. Family. Everything one needs to live a happy life.  Still, when I close my eyes... I'm a dragon. I know it, I feel it, that's just how I am now. It's like staring at your legs or hands and seeing you've got them. Or watching yourself in the mirror, you know it's you. It's the same thing but mentally.   The thing is, I don't have a problem with this at all. For the first time in my life I've finally found myself and what I am and am super happy about how things turned out. I know it's just a wiring error or a bug in my brain and it can't be real, but to me, it is. Maybe I'm delusional, but to be honest it's fun as hell being what I am; a blue bipedal space dragon from space.  Edit: spelling"
quityourbullshit,3chib3,VanillaDragon,3,Wed Jul 8 02:34:41 2015 UTC,"There were moments of the whole fiasco that felt very ""real"" to me. Like I said I used to have dreams, some of them were incredibly vivid and clear, even looking back on them now I wonder what they could of meant. Drugs could've been a thing for me to, I was also in therapy at the time and I felt practically experimented on.  I was put on a lot of different medications for a lot of different reasons, that honestly were really unnecessary.  After therapy stopped because it wasn't working and I wasn't on those drugs anymorr, my mental state cleared up a bit. The whole idea of being a dragon is always one I can entertain, but I'll never believe it again. Would it be cool? Maybe, dragons don't technically exist so I have no idea what their supposed lives would actually be like. But that belief and ideology consumed me for a large period of time, and kept me in darkness. I'll never do that again"

quityourbullshit,3chib3,CortinaOmega,18,Wed Jul 8 01:19:31 2015 UTC,"Story time.  I knew a soldier who really did think he was a dragon.  I encountered this guy at Fort Gordon in 2005.  He was in what the Army calls Advanced Individual Training.  The purpose of AIT it to train soldiers in their specific job.  This soldier was only supposed to be there for about six months, but he was well past that when I met him.  He had injured his knees and was medically unable to proceed to his first duty station.  As the story goes, a Drill Sergeant was doing inspections of rooms in the barracks.  DS sees rocks on the window sill and asks the soldier why they're there.  Soldier claims that the rocks are moonstones that give him power.  Apparently a disagreement about these rocks/moonstones ensued and the soldier bolted from the room with DS chasing him.  Soldier gets halfway down the stairs, shouts ""I'm a dragon!"" and attempts to fly away.  Except he's not and gravity is a motherfucker.  He lands wrong and jacks up both knees.  Believe it or not, that's not even the strangest thing I encountered in eight years of Army service.  *Edit because people have asked.  I have to be a bit vague because I don't want to give away a person's identity.  Google ""army soldier proselytizing"".  You'll find some raw Al-Jazeera footage.  One of the people featured in that video takes the prize as the weirdest individual I've ever met.  He had full-blown alopecia which made him hairless as a baby.  He claimed to be an ordained minister and was working to become a chaplain.  He left his Fruit-of-the-Looms out so everyone to see his poor technique on the toilet.  At a urinal, he'd pull his pants all the way down.  He was a proponent of Gorean life and was rumored to have been the original author of the Wikipedia article.  He claimed to have PTSD which made him so forgetful that he left his weapon at the gym, dining facility and porta-john.  An Afghan local found it the third time and returned it to MPs.  He was reduced in rank because of it, but I think he may still have made chaplain."

And they get together and get wasted and leave the sacred site a mess.   Lance Browneyes has been making about a million posts a day to media sites, news outlets.. It took them until the hippies arrived in the black hills for anyone to pick up the story and help fan the outrage. Then Ironeyes, who comes from a well respected family comes in and gives the Rainbow Family his fucking blessing to be there. Possibly for cash, motives are unclear.  But that shit is still going on."

And to examine history, we know that something bad always happens to the invaders. This is sacred land. It has a way of defending itself. The rainbow family won't escape unscathed.  A lot of these kids are resorting back to their ""Cherokee ancestry"". They feel entitled to share secret and sacred things, the black drink, the peyote, the dances, the ceremonies..

quityourbullshit,3cb64y,LilithImmaculate,4,Mon Jul 6 18:22:47 2015 UTC,I was going to ask about her facial expression. Every picture seems to have that awkward half open barely showing teeth look.

I mean hell, of all the reasons I don't find her attractive, her looks are close to the bottom. She might be an amazing person, but all I have is that music video and a few budget modeling shots and that sure as hell ain't doing it for me.

It started to unfold through campus emails that the victim may have fabricated some details, then it turned of it was all false, then it came out that she had posted an ad on craigslist a couple weeks before that she wanted a man to meet up and have sex with her and then hit her (or something of that fashion)."

Pathological lying (also called pseudologia fantastica and mythomania) and closely related to compulsive lying, is a behavior of habitual or compulsive lying.   It was first described in the medical literature in 1891 by Anton Delbrueck.  Although it is a controversial topic,  pathological lying has been defined as ""falsification entirely disproportionate to any discernible end in view, may be extensive and very complicated, and may manifest over a period of years or even a lifetime"".  The individual may be aware they are lying, or may believe they are telling the truth, being unaware that they are relating fantasies.

quityourbullshit,3c82xk,FortheThorns,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:18:17 2015 UTC,"Well, it happens.    Obviously if someone is male and a prostitute, the odds are they're serving male clients.  But on a site with 40 million users, there's going to be some gigolos."
quityourbullshit,3c82xk,Corky_Butcher,14,Tue Jul 7 19:21:03 2015 UTC,"Is there a sub where people admit to making up posts for karma?  TBH I'm becoming more interested in the art of thinking and writing posts for the sole sake of maximizing karma more than calling out bullshit.  I love a lot of posts here calling out people for making up bullshit when they're going for sympathy points or making up excuses, but when it comes to reddit posts where that's not the case, I'm just more impressed. Reading a thread then thinking about a post, no matter what, that maximizes karma would be fun I'd think."

quityourbullshit,3c8x7v,thewookie34,107,Mon Jul 6 03:57:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was cringe-worthy. I felt embarrassed just reading it."
quityourbullshit,3c8x7v,himynameisjay,58,Mon Jul 6 04:52:08 2015 UTC,Sadly /r/pcmasterrace has devolved into a subreddit that no longer recognizes that it's supposed to be satirical.
quityourbullshit,3c8x7v,Bluntbows,26,Mon Jul 6 07:22:11 2015 UTC,I know this first hand. I myself am a PC gamer and used to be subbed to it. I think the last straw was when I made a comment about the easy of use of a console compared to a PC. I merely stated that it's a lot easier to go from not playing a game to playing a game with the console when compared to the PC and all he kept arguing was mods and graphic when it had no real context in my main argument.
quityourbullshit,3c8x7v,thewookie34,11,Mon Jul 6 07:42:35 2015 UTC,"I used to be subbed to it but I couldn't handle the 'Hail Lord Gaben' shit anymore.  Don't get me wrong, I love Steam and Valve games but they're absolutely not flawless. Support that takes 8 months to respond, or not at all. Or get automated messages every time you try to explain your problem.  Heavy bugs in CS:GO that do not have priority, instead they keep making cases with a new key to open them every time.  Oh and taking 15% of the money you make on the market for your items every time it gets sold?  They make so much money yet they can't improve their support platform etc.  Fuck you Gaben, fuck you so much."
quityourbullshit,3c8x7v,TimV55,4,Mon Jul 6 15:29:52 2015 UTC,Yea I love steam I have 1300 games but it is far from flawless. I don't understand why so many people have such a blind love for all that is valve.

quityourbullshit,3c8x7v,thewookie34,2,Mon Jul 6 20:37:01 2015 UTC,Yeah getting Fallout 3 to run is a god damn wasteland adventure in itself.  Also I got Dead Space on PC and it wouldn't work. Basically all I could find out is that it either works for you or doesn't work for you and you just have to get lucky.
quityourbullshit,3c8x7v,nastynate66,2,Tue Jul 7 16:38:24 2015 UTC,"Really? Didn't know that.  Dead Space is great for the first few chapters, after that the suspense just kind of disappears, though.  Never had any real problems with FO3. You do need to ramp up the maximum RAM usage and use a borderless windowed mode application for crash-free gaming."
quityourbullshit,3c8x7v,Wizc0,2,Mon Jul 13 19:13:16 2015 UTC,"That hardly seems relevant to it being on PC, though? My friend had the same thing happen to his New Vegas copy on XBOX 360 except there wasn't much he could do about it. Really not trying to be a dick here, just trying to understand!  I absolutely agree that pcmasterrace has become obsessed with ""peasantry"" and all but overall I find it extremely difficult to compare other consoles with PC as it's just not a fair comparison. PC's will always be ahead in terms of technology since they are not a set physical specs device like consoles which take several years to develop, but both have their downfalls, of course."

quityourbullshit,3c7wfs,lazercats,40,Sun Jul 5 21:38:26 2015 UTC,"Someone posted about a shark being killed on a beach, turns out the shark wasn't killed or fished at all and was looked at and returned to the water."
quityourbullshit,3c7wfs,OperationJericho,27,Sun Jul 5 21:46:19 2015 UTC,It expressly states in the news article that it was released unharmed so to the best of any our knowledge (excluding if you're a shark expert?) it will probably be fine. They probably get hooked in the wild sometimes.
quityourbullshit,3c7wfs,ProLifePanda,28,Sun Jul 5 22:14:16 2015 UTC,Maybe they were fishing for a different sport fish and they hooked a shark? I have not found the article but the tone I get from the comment makes it seem like that is the case. At that point it would be best to pull it in and remove the hook rather than cutting the line and leaving the hook along with a lot of line in the shark.
quityourbullshit,3c7wfs,OperationJericho,10,Sun Jul 5 22:18:08 2015 UTC,"Not to jump in, but I live in the area, and we've recently had a slate of shark attacks. So if this happened recently, I can understand why there is little sympathy for a shark in the area. Some of the locals are discussing a ""Jaws"" type scenario (jokingly, of course)."
quityourbullshit,3c7wfs,Jwood013,4,Sun Jul 5 22:21:28 2015 UTC,"Seems to me that that would explain why the fishermen  caught a shark instead of a sport fish. Also, as long as it is legal, I don't really see a problem with taking a shark. It doesn't taste too great in my opinion but to each his own."
quityourbullshit,3c7wfs,YourOwnDemise,6,Sun Jul 5 22:30:06 2015 UTC,"Fisherman here. Hooks don't injure given they hook the mouth and are unhooked properly. If you're shark fishing, the hook will be set in the mouth. In freshwater environments the fish aren't as resilient, but we're talking about a shark here. These things are tanks."

quityourbullshit,3c7wfs,RearNakedGrope,6,Mon Jul 6 10:50:25 2015 UTC,"I don't want to be that guy, but the hook is set by the fisherman. You'd need an enormous hook for the shark to set it on its own. Regardless, no injury was done."

quityourbullshit,3c7wfs,RearNakedGrope,2,Mon Jul 6 10:52:10 2015 UTC,"There is potential for the shark stick the hook into its own mouth, but when the fisherman feels the shark ""hit"" it, he pulls the rod back which tightens the line and pulls on the hook. That's what sets the hook, sinking it into the mouth and making it so the shark can't ""spit"" the hook."

quityourbullshit,3c7wfs,emailyou,2,Mon Jul 6 17:22:13 2015 UTC,"That's all well and good, but I've never interacted with an animal that didn't want to eat something if I had something to feed it. It's not like they can put it in their pocket for later.  In the meantime, sharks don't actually ""get"" hungry. They attack and feed out of convenience. I'm not saying they WANT to kill people, but if they see a person, they'll have a poke to figure it out. Sometimes that involves biting. So no, it doesn't mean they're ""hungry.""  But since sharks never actually ""feel"" hunger (no fish do) my mocking the person's comment is still apt. ;)"

Two kids lost limbs due to severe injuries, and a 68 year old man was attacked in waist deep water by a 7ft shark and had to fight it off. Most the attacked happened in shallow water too.   I was not very comfortable going in the water. Sharks are scary as hell, I don't care how many people say they aren't dangerous monsters because they certainly look like one when it takes off your arm.  The very idea that a shark could be next to me in the ocean makes me want to jump out and run along the surface of the water like Gilligan."

quityourbullshit,3c7wfs,SneakyTigers,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:51:41 2015 UTC,"Quick note: Just because the shark swam away doesn't mean they didn't kill it. Fighting it for 40 minutes on hook and line probably caused more stress and harm to the animal than sitting it on the beach briefly.

quityourbullshit,3c87jr,reh888,9,Mon Jul 6 03:54:37 2015 UTC,"I live very close to a Home Depot and go there regularly.  In my experience, the people working at Home Depot have zero fucks to give about anything.  I was walking out with something from there recently that was expensive enough to set-off the door alarm as I went out.  I stopped with my receipt in hand ready to prove I had paid and nobody even made eye contact with me.  There were maybe a half dozen employees in sight (front of a busy HD store) and not a one cared if I was walking out with stolen goods.  The people who work at HD are good for telling you where stuff is (in general) and not a lot else.  I apologize to any HD workers who really are great and knowledgeable workers.  It really doesn't seem like they reward that there though.  Also I saw a guy getting a BJ in the parking lot in broad daylight with cars parked all around him."
quityourbullshit,3c87jr,explohd,14,Mon Jul 6 14:12:06 2015 UTC,well the employees at most retail places don't care if you're stealing shit. they don't get paid enough to chase somebody out in the parking lot and risk their lives.
quityourbullshit,3c87jr,brufleth,8,Mon Jul 6 15:14:35 2015 UTC,"More likely they are prohibited from chasing you at all. At the store I work at we cannot confront them about them stealing, but we can give them the big old customer service speel while they're ""shopping"". If we chase them, we will be terminated. It's all about liability and personal safety."
quityourbullshit,3c87jr,reh888,3,Tue Jul 7 23:34:05 2015 UTC,"I wasn't running though.  I stopped and looked for someone to care.  I worked in retail.  I can't claim I cared all that much about theft other than a generally sense of doing the right thing, but we had to count inventory every day (sometimes several times a day) and being short looked really bad.  So there's certainly some motivation in some cases.  I don't mean to knock the people working there.  From what I can tell, HD isn't the greatest employer.  I imagine the workers do exactly what their bosses deserve to get out of them."
quityourbullshit,3c87jr,brufleth,10,Mon Jul 6 15:26:16 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Guy standing there looking around instead of running = not a thief. From what I can tell, having worked there, HD is on par with every other big box retailer. It's the same at Lowe's or Target or Walmart. The percentage of merch that walks out the doors isn't much compared to the volume."
quityourbullshit,3c87jr,Jacobtait,4,Mon Jul 6 15:41:50 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  I think Best Buy was the one place where they took it marginally more serious.  I think it was largely just an act though.  They had the dude at the entry looking at cameras and such to be an obvious ""see we're watching you"" sort of deterrent.  I'm pretty sure most of the shrink was internal at all the places I worked though.  Employees were always taking stuff.  I rarely even wanted any of the shit I was selling and I was too damn honest for that.  I do know that some people would trade stuff with employees at other stores.  It was an interesting internal theft trade market.  I'm glad I don't work in retail anymore."

Based on that, chances are his boss is either young and stupid also, or a middle-aged individual with no hope for anything better than middle management paid by the hour. Neither one of those situations normally makes for someone known for their professionalism and tact."

And it's possible he called him out on Facebook because it was the last straw and the guy is known for doing that. Public shaming is a good motivator.   Seriously, calling out on holidays puts everyone else in a bind and can lead to some unintended consequences.   I know retail and food service suck, trust me I do because I was in retail for 8 years while I was in high school, community college, and university, but please don't just call out on busy days. Everyone else would rather be doing something else too."

When I was a kid, for a short period of time my parents used food stamps. Large colorful ""money"" you had to pull from a book. There was a certain level of shame attached to using them. This is a good thing. Because no one ever had their children starve to death because they did not want to be seen with the ""funny money"". I will bet though that many people were motivated by that same shame to get any fucking job they could to be able to pay with real money. Now food stamps are done on EBT cards that look and work like an ATM card. Zero shame. Spending millions on commercials to convince more people to use them. When you remove shame from a behavior, You get more of that behavior. Period."

In recent days he's been making a ton of sales--so much so that he has difficulty keeping up. People were interviewed after just coming from his shop to purchase Confederate flags for family members and friends ""before they run out."" The owner of the shop, when interviewed, did the usual ""heritage not hate"" routine. Well, turns out that inside the man's store wasn't just flags. Inside were racist depictions of black people on minstrel collectibles and a full Nazi uniform on display. The man continued to deny having any racist intentions.   I'm glad that Walmart, Amazon, Ebay, and other large retailers have discontinued their sales of Confederate merchandise. But not just for the reason that such sales are immoral. It allows for people like that small shop owner to be exposed for what they really are and what they represent."

Going dark only serves to deprive people of viewing the threads on the subreddit, thus punishing the readers/subs. It will not bring Victoria back and will not force Pao to quit.  If you want a soapbox to stand on go to one of the many petitions being posted, or find a subreddit that focuses on this issue. If you think going dark will ""spread the message"" more than this whole issue already is... Well I call your bullshit.   This is all over the news, going dark or staying dark will make you more of an enemy in the eyes of other redditors who just want to participate in the subreddit.  Also, Victoria being let go and moderators being let go are NOT the same. Mods, to my knowledge, are mostly unpaid. Getting removed from a position with no pay doesn't require warning or reason. It isn't always fair but losing a volunteer position doesn't affect your living situation like losing a paid position.  Finally, Victoria surely will be compensated for her work and has many positive reviews to likely get another job in her field. By all accounts she was amazing and great to work with. Turning her into a martyr for the cause is BULLSHIT.   /rant"

The site traffic isn't affected much.  As a neutral guy who doesn't really care about AMAs or about the shitty HR practices and admin behaviors of a private company that doesn't deal in anything essential (like health care)....  If you really care, and you want to make a statement, then setting subs to private does zip. You need to talk to your friends on reddit, and log off, and stay off reddit for a week. That's it.

I'm just trying to point out that the great 'go dark' strategy didn't actually accomplish anything, but it was getting hysterical news coverage of 'reddit is tearing itself apart'.  Really, what would have happened if the mods continued with everything private? Nothing, if the users all still stay on. All that would happen is some users would start new subs, or subs that were small would suddenly swell and get bigger, and all the ad revenue that was lost from the big subs would be back."

New users don't post content, they lurk for awhile. If the popular subs were dark than only the unpopular (or less popular) subs would be available. They tend to be less popular for a reason don't they?  Fewer people find them interesting.   If every sub that I subscribed to was unavailable to me than I would check back tomorrow. If it was still unavailable I might check back the next day. On my third check I'm ditching reddit altogether. Hardcore posters would stay and reform, but many more casual users would abandon in a matter of days. What's more they would be looking for an alternate site that fills the niche reddit currently occupies. That's bad for reddit, good for its competition.   It would take more time, but if enough subs went private it could hurt reddit. Though I suppose they could just remove the option of private subs altogether... Or require that admins approve privatization."

quityourbullshit,3byjr3,Miss_Meltymel,-6,Sat Jul 4 01:59:17 2015 UTC,The issue for most users isn't the issue the mods are having. Our problem as users is that those that run Reddit have chosen to run it as a business instead of a community. Every decision is dictated by money so they make all of those decisions without making the community. Content that could jeopardize the ad revenue is deleted and Reddit is no longer the platform for open discussion and free speech it used to be.

quityourbullshit,3byjr3,06sharpshot,3,Sat Jul 4 02:41:41 2015 UTC,The word censorship implies denial of a right or ability to communicate. You are no more being censored on Reddit than someone removing a sign they didn't approve of from their front yard.

quityourbullshit,3byjr3,Pixelated_Fudge,7,Fri Jul 3 08:24:43 2015 UTC,"It's pointless because it doesn't affect the base numbers that matter to the investors. It's pointless because most of the people who go to reddit were still on reddit and so there's no long term effect on ad rates. And having a drop in gold purchase for a day does not affect the perceived value of the company. It's not threatening, especially as people quickly return to their normal reddit use patterns (many of them didn't even stop).   We are post-dark now. Did anything get resolved? Alexis whatsisface gave a weak non-apology, no specifics as to how to address people's concerns.... and it's back to business as usual.  It's like nothing happened, as if reddit's servers hiccuped for a day on a technical glitch.  In fact, in some subs, it looks like the posts of people upset about going back to business as usual so soon are being actively suppressed. So it's even more like business as usual!  Everyone going off for a day, on the contrary, would seriously shock the perception of reddit's value. That would actually have a chance of getting Pao fired, and admins scrambling to keep people happy.  Now, like I said in other places, I don't care about AMAs, I didn't know who Victoria was before, and I don't really care about the HR behavior of a non-essential company.  But the people who say they care.... Yeah, they didn't accomplish a damned thing with the 'go private for a bit' strategy."

If they'd made an early morning announcement and pointed specifically to a person who would be taking over Victoria's duties then this would have been much less rocky.

It makes sense for subs that relied on her to go down. It makes sense to be protesting against bad treatment of moderators. But I doubt half the subs that went down even knew chooter existed before this.  You seem like the kind of person who prides himself in free thought, but I feel like you've made up your mind. But you just have to think of it from a business decision. When something happens, it happens for a reason."
quityourbullshit,3byjr3,steelviper77,3,Fri Jul 3 05:28:50 2015 UTC,"It's not about her being fired, it's about the lack of communication that the reddit admins have with the people that make reddit what it is."

quityourbullshit,3byjr3,Solunity,2,Fri Jul 3 06:04:16 2015 UTC,Pretty risky making her the face of a movement without knowing why she was terminated or if she even wants our support.  She could have completely deserved an immediate termination. What if she was taking bribes from the producers of Rampart 2 for a another godawful Woody Harrelson ama?  We're sitting here complaining about our entertainment being interrupted and our solution is to further interrupt the process of getting Reddit working again without the apparently irreplaceable Victoria.

quityourbullshit,3byjr3,finite_turtles,-2,Fri Jul 3 08:28:35 2015 UTC,Apparently Reddit wanted to make video AMAs and other things that changed how AMAs are and Victoria thought it was a bad idea. They felt she was holding them back and they fired her. I can see why they did it but it was an awful idea considering how important she was to what is arguably their biggest subreddit.

quityourbullshit,3byjr3,polkadel,7,Fri Jul 3 08:01:18 2015 UTC,"that is not the reason why all the subs are going private.  its the fact that she was fired but no one told any of the other mods and no one was going to replace her. Now all the scheduled ama's couldn't continue because no one had any form of contacting them.   But this was just the final straw, all the mods have had issues with admins loongg before that.  They are not being supported or communicated with whatsoever.  I  at the end of the day the mods are volunteering so much of their time to keep the subs running, especially IAMA seeing as Victoria was the one who looked after majority of the most famous ama's, bringing soo much traffic to reddit, and they don't even get any ounce of support."

quityourbullshit,3byjr3,Khnagar,-1,Fri Jul 3 07:43:05 2015 UTC,"She was fired for not wanting to along with the ideas for commercializing the AMA's proposed by the higher ups / managment. There was a conflict going on there for a while reportedly.  Also, Victoria asking Jesse Jackson a question deemed inappropriate escalating the conflict about the nature of the AMA's, leading to the abrupt firing. (When Jesse Jackson does an AMA I think its natural to assume someone is going to ask some uncomfortable question. I wouldn't have it any other way to be honest.) The Jesse Jackson may or may not have had something to do with her being fired.  She felt the change would not be beneficial to reddit and the reddit community. She put her foot down, and managment eventually promptly fired her without notice to anyone.   Her being fired in that manner have created all sorts of problems for the other mods who dependend on the job she did, and the reasons for her being fired is of course also something most disagre with here."

quityourbullshit,3byjr3,lewildcard,-1,Fri Jul 3 07:48:06 2015 UTC,"I definitely think this subreddit should. Victoria being unceremoniously let go without warning is bad, however, the fact that this action is very representative of how the admins have treated mods for a long time is the real problem. /r/iAMA went private both in protest of Victoria's termination, but also largely because there was no communication between admins and mods. Mods on /r/books first discovered Victoria was let go when an author who was scheduled to do an AMA today messaged one of them asking what was going on and where the woman he had been communicating with for months was. No one had any idea, leaving a lot of mods shit out of luck with no way to contact the people who were actually supposed to hold an AMA today. The admin team still hasn't responded. While it may not have affected /r/quityourbullshit today, the admin team's complete disregard will affect us eventually (the admins lack of communications is uniform for everyone including the major subreddits). First they eliminate /r/fatpeoplehate (which was a terrible subreddit), then they gentrify /r/IAmA where only cheesy pandering questions are asked, then it affects everything reddit once stood for. This subreddit is literally called quit your bullshit, I think it's quit fitting for us to go private in protest of this corporate posturing and general admin blowhard bullshit as soon as possible."

If an oil company president says we need environmental protection policy that is great, if he suggests he should be the one to oversee it... That smells like bullshit.   Let's say you were running for president during the time of slavery, suggesting that slavery was evil and needed abolishing. Then it turns out you have a shitload of slaves working your plantations... Well, that just doesn't fly, does it?    Trump doesn't just say ""these policies should be changed"" he suggests they are morally wrong. He suggests Mexicans are ""sending us their rapists"", not that immigration policy needs to be fixed. It would be a bit different if he didn't conflate the rhetoric so much... But that's how he operates.  He purports to speak from a position of moral authority, which requires consistency of action he never actually has.   The funny thing is that he has no intention of becoming president. He just likes attention and promoting his own brand. He did this last time only to drop out right when his TV show premiered... It was a ratings stunt. This time it backfired as NBC fired him as well as Macy's because of all the racist stuff.  This time, lacking anything worth promoting, he might actually keep running and see what happens.

quityourbullshit,3bw3ib,SavageSavant,0,Thu Jul 9 16:08:30 2015 UTC,"All this business about China is red-herring bullshit to distract from real issues.   You may take note that they'll all probably start championing that now, 'bringing back industry to America', because it's going to happen anyway. Textile, tech, and general widget production, industrial automation has gotten to the point that it's cheaper to replace labor with robotics. China's initial reaction to this has been to buy enmass the robotic automation systems etc. and try and implement the systems before the USA can. But.  It won't matter at all, at this point it becomes cheaper to localize production by continent, and with California's rare earth mineral mines reopening all the resources will also be mined, harvested, etc. on the north american continent. In the far term, as automation advances the production of goods will become ever more and more localized and our economy will shift to being a resource based economy.     Why I say this is you're going to see a bunch of bullshit politicians, left and right, championing a bullshit cannard of bringing back 'industry' to the US, as if they have any control over it and as if the new automated foundries haven't been being planned and built for years now and that they are all their doing. Industry will return but they won't require hardly any human labor to run. Meanwhile China's still has a massive asset bubble to answer to, depending on what they do with it and the results they get, it will really set their economic outlook to the near future more than anything happening in the now. They will inevitably pass us, it's a matter of population, either way, that's a great thing for us and everyone on the planet their growing middle class (now 300 million) will consume a great deal, all of our economies will be better for it."

He doesn't say his mom abandoned him and his family supported him, he says that his family and friends abandoned him but his mom and his fiancee were the ones who supported him him.  People typically have two sets of grandparents so there's nothing outwardly false about saying more than one grandmother died. I'm not sure where you think the third grandmother is, but the first image he says step grandmother. The story in his first image is about his step father driving drunk and ""his mother"", which would be the guy's step grandmother, being the one to give step dad the car keys back.  I also don't think it's that hard to believe at all that he isn't close to his little brother's younger brother. If guy's mom and dad have joint custody, he very likely could only see his younger brother when he's visiting their dad. Since the 7yo brother is not blood related to this guy or this guy's dad, he probably isn't going to be coming along to visits on holidays - he would be spending holidays with his own parents.  I'm not saying everything he's claiming is true, it's obvious he switches from fiancee to wife, but that's really the only flaw I see in his stories.

quityourbullshit,3buxal,THRILLPOW3R,8,Thu Jul 2 12:12:11 2015 UTC,"My grandmother was in a car crash 15 years ago and she used a wheelchair, but as she progressed through PT she was able to get up for longer and longer periods. Standing up absolutely does not mean you aren't disabled, because it's completely normal for mobility to be slowly regained after a spinal injury.  I mean, what I'm saying is people might be jumping the gun on calling him out..."
quityourbullshit,3buxal,THRILLPOW3R,18,Thu Jul 2 12:18:10 2015 UTC,"The difference is this guy played it up and it gained sympathy from his viewers. He claimed he couldn't move his legs and it was only a month or so after the big scandal (he received so much money in donations) those other streamers went to his apartment and filmed him walking around like normal.  EDIT: Just to clarify in case I mislead, the other streamers didn't go and sneak up to his window to film him - they knew eachother via Twitch.tv and knocked on his door and he greeted them.   There's no reason to doubt he may have been in a car crash, may have been disabled and may use his wheelchair because he's used to it or just plain lazy (dude I'd probably rock the shit out of one if I had one spare). That's not why people are outraged... people are outraged that up until he got ""caught"" he played up his inability to walk during the peak of his popularity on Twitch and that netted him tons of money and sympathy from mislead viewers."

quityourbullshit,3bqo4e,dumbestfish,5,Wed Jul 1 20:05:01 2015 UTC,"Section 1. Song credits of article  Bitter Sweet Symphony:       Although the song's lyrics were written by Verve vocalist Richard Ashcroft, its distinctive passage for strings was sampled from the 1965 Andrew Oldham Orchestra symphonic recording of ""The Last Time"", arranged & written by David Whitaker, inspired by the 1965 Rolling Stones' song of the same title.    Originally, The Verve had negotiated a licence to use a five-note sample from the Oldham recording, but former Stones manager Allen Klein (who owned the copyrights to the band’s pre-1970 songs) claimed that The Verve broke the agreement and used a larger portion.   Despite its original lyrics and string intro (by Wil Malone & Ashcroft), the music of ""Bitter Sweet Symphony"" was sampled from the Oldham track, which led to a lawsuit with ABKCO Records, Klein's holding company, and eventually settled out of court. The Verve relinquished all of their royalties to Klein, owner of ABKCO Records, whilst songwriting credits were changed to Jagger/Richards/Ashcroft.   The Verve bassist Simon Jones said, ""We were told it was going to be a 50/50 split, and then they saw how well the record was doing. They rung up and said we want 100 percent or take it out of the shops, you don't have much choice.""  After losing the composer credits to the song, Ashcroft commented, ""This is the best song Jagger and Richards have written in 20 years"",  noting it was their biggest UK hit since ""Brown Sugar"".  On Ashcroft's return to touring, the song traditionally ended the set list. Ashcroft also reworked the single for VH2 Live for the music channel VH1, stripping the song of its strings. Ashcroft is quoted as saying during the show: ""Despite all the legal angles and the bullshit, strip down to the chords and the lyrics and the melody and you realise there is such a good song there.""

Shmurda is a drill artist which lyrically talks about killing people more often then just selling drugs. They are minor differences but you can see thematically the differences between the Chicago drill scene and the Atlanta trap scene (even though Shmurda is from New York but he has a heavy chicago influence).

quityourbullshit,3bqo4e,KoalaExpress,26,Wed Jul 1 15:51:07 2015 UTC,"No, the bail hearing isn't about how guilty the judge thinks the defendant may be. It's about the defendants ability to flee the jurisdiction as well as the likelihood he would flee.  In reality it is often used as a punishment. Either a financial one because there is rarely a situation where you will get all of your bail money returned to you, or by keeping you in jail before you've had a trial because bail is too much to afford."

It isn't as simple as you make it seem. The issue is that the ""poor kid"" is still going to have bail set to the point where they probably wouldn't be able to afford it. Since most poor people work hourly jobs that could easily be filled, any time in jail would mean that they would lose their job and be even less likely to be able to post bail."
quityourbullshit,3bqo4e,TrxpThxm,17,Wed Jul 1 13:54:59 2015 UTC,"That's not the issue... it's based on circumstances and flight risk.  So you want a bigoted mass murderer to be released on bail while he is awaiting trial?  Ok.  I mean I suppose someone could post it for him, but no one is going to.  It's laughable to think that any bail was set at all for the alleged gunman."
quityourbullshit,3bqo4e,jhartwell,5,Wed Jul 1 14:24:17 2015 UTC,"That's not the issue... it's based on circumstances and flight risk.   You just said that it is about wealth and not race, so that would be the issue you were talking about.  As for bail for an alleged ""bigoted mass murderer"" (as it is innocent until proven guilty) it depends on the location. There are some states that have a bail schedule and no matter what extenuating circumstances they judge has to follow that schedule. There are other states that can refuse bail if there is a flight risk or immediate danger to the community.   The point being, that your original comment is that it is about wealth is true and it is the problem. A wealthy person could afford a large bail whereas a poor person could not"
quityourbullshit,3bqo4e,TrxpThxm,5,Wed Jul 1 14:39:22 2015 UTC,"Ok, it's about wealth, circumstances and flight risk.  Edit:  As I take it from your reply, but mainly wealth, right?  Does South Carolina have a bail schedule?"

I was speaking on your comment    If you have more money/means, the bail is higher.    This is simply not true. Robert Durst was/is worth hundreds of millions. His family is in the top 50 richest in the country and his bail was 3 billion...for a short time. Then Texas lowered it to 450,000 (less than the Baltimore kid) and he fled after easily paying. And that's after he already jumped bond once before. Fortunately they ""learned their lesson"" and he is being held without bail now."

quityourbullshit,3bqo4e,erktheerk,-1,Wed Jul 1 16:56:53 2015 UTC,Actually the kid turned himself in. The chances of him rejoining the riots or fleeing were almost non existant. You don't turn yourself in just to post bail and go right back to it.

It created an uproar on the internet that spawned this indiegogo campaign.  Josh Paler Lin then posted this video on December 29, 2014 of him ""graciously"" giving Thomas a makeover, a suit, lodging, and dinner.  He follows it up with this video on February 16, 2015 of him flying Thomas's biological father out to visit him.  He then ""graciously"" helps him obtain his birth certificate, ID, and a bank account.  However, as featured in this article posted January 2, 2015, Thomas's brother states that Thomas is in fact sitting on a large inheritance, and actually goes by the name Kenni, as Thomas is his middle name.  In this article, a nursing student also states he witnessed the original video being staged.  Here is another article/video detailing the arguments from both sides also posted on January 2, 2015.  Kenneth Thomas Nickel was found dead in an L.A. alleyway at the end of May 2015.  The coroner stated he died due to chronic alcoholism.  Josh Paler Lin posted two videos, a month after Kenneth's passing, displaying his ""grief"" over the passing of his ""dear friend"".  Here and here.  He cites Kenny as a ""dear friend"" in both videos, but did not know of his passing until a month after the fact.  Then there is this article/video I included in the original post, detailing the passing of Kenni and I won't break it down, you just need to watch the video and read the article.  I will point out, however, this image of the legal document the Nickels would have had to sign to receive the funds.  It explicitly states they would have to reimburse Josh Paler Lin for nearly $20,000 for the ""feeding, lodging, clothing, legal fees, and other related costs connected with supporting the Nickels until the disbursement of the Campaign Funds"" that he so ""graciously"" offered them in the videos Paler Lin posted to Youtube.  So with all the above information and the supposed feel good, graciousness, and generosity that Josh Paler Lin feigned in his videos... Quit your bullshit, Josh Paler Lin.   Also, regarding rule #4 of this sub, I had concerns myself.  However, /u/doxep gave me permission to submit the link.  If this comment is grounds for breaking rule #4, feel free to delete it.  I just thought I'd share some extra detail on the situation, get the bullshit out there, and make readers more aware to the authenticity (or lack of) of some of the videos and campaigns they find from these Youtubers.  I think the legal document included in the video that I linked is pretty much as bullshit as you can get, given the context of the videos and the ""graciousness"" of the Youtuber."

quityourbullshit,3bucvj,debango,8,Thu Jul 2 08:48:00 2015 UTC,"A homeless advocate called Josh Paler Lin out one night in Florida in early February.  This was Lin's response.  ""Dedication and hustling.  Every day I'm hustling.""  To follow up on that, Lin posted these two videos after learning of Kenni's passing (a month after the fact) Here and here last week.  When asked back in February which video he had on Youtube that he thought to be the most popular, he responded with ""I think, uh, the homeless guy"".  Instead of referring to his ""dear friend"" by his name, he referred to him as the ""homeless guy"".  I'm sure they were very close.  I'm sure they were very dear friends given his responses in the aforementioned video and the legal document requiring reimbursement for all the kindness, Josh Paler Lin showered upon Kenni Thomas Nickel in the videos Josh Paler Lin uploaded to display how kindness, generosity, and good will can go a long ways to make a difference in life, and convey the message Josh Paler Lin was trying to send to his viewers."
quityourbullshit,3bucvj,endyn,4,Thu Jul 2 09:14:10 2015 UTC,"I don't even know what to say to this. I'd feel better if he would just speak honestly and get this shit worked out. I don't want any hiding away from the issue at hand, and I don't want to see other people having to resort to facing this guy personally to get an answer. This fuckhead is not worth anyone's time and effort, and to think that he would make a video to 'honor' the passing of his 'dear friend' makes me sick.  And you know what's worse? I skimmed over the comment section on the original video where he gave the money, and a few talked about how inspired they were by his actions. I'm sure they didn't know what really happened, but as soon as they do they'll lose a lot of faith in humanity. I hope that well-meaning stunts on Youtube stay well-meaning. No more fucking acts, no more 'It's just a prank! bullshit for attention. Just people being people. Is that too much to ask?"

quityourbullshit,3boy3u,wtmh,67,Tue Jun 30 23:33:29 2015 UTC,"This is a lot of debate for a problem easily solved by google image searching ""19xx united states coins"". You can find thousands of pictures from any year you like. Here's a 1903 half dollar that has it, and a 1910 penny.  Or you can just look it up like /u/regeya did:   The motto has been in continuous use on the one-cent coin since 1909, and on the ten-cent coin since 1916. It also has appeared on all gold coins and silver dollar coins, half-dollar coins, and quarter-dollar coins struck since July 1, 1908.   So blue might be correct that 1903 was slightly too early for pennies to have it, but talk about missing the bigger picture"

quityourbullshit,3bnqbf,1q2w3,8,Tue Jun 30 22:50:24 2015 UTC,"Care to show an example? So far, MDE is unfunny, and h3h3 is tres funny."
quityourbullshit,3bnqbf,SCATMANJAWN,-10,Tue Jun 30 22:12:43 2015 UTC,"okay but that doesn't matter. crazy hats, lack of facial grooming/general hygiene, ridiculous outfits, mannerisms, opinions/video topics, intentionally low quality vlogging -- all ripped directly from sam hyde. Additionally, their editing style and music choices are again, reminiscent of MDE. If you don't find MDE funny, thats you're prerogative, but you can't deny that this ethan guy is shamelessly ripping off another channel's shtick."
quityourbullshit,3bnqbf,mastermoebius,7,Wed Jul 1 01:52:14 2015 UTC,"Can you provide some actual examples? I'm just not seeing it, but I'm open to it. I think the reference to editing as far as like 80s-90s lo-fi weird shit transcends both of these dudes, big time. It's all over the art world, and I would argue that things like ""Look Around You"" and ""Tim and Eric"" were sort of catalysts for a lot of that becoming popular."
quityourbullshit,3bnqbf,SCATMANJAWN,-5,Wed Jul 1 02:26:31 2015 UTC,"okay, I'll give you five. if you're not convinced by then I really don't care anymore. but, before that, I want you to consider a few things. first of all, MDE predates Tim and Eric/was released roughly around the same time as awesome show. If anything, I would consider them as contemporaries rather than inspirations for one another. Second, the major difference between h3h3 and MDE in terms of production quality is that h3h3 is tacky and kitsch whereas MDE is actually REALLY well edited and quite original.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d47Jibt-EOE social commentary/critique of internet videos and figures https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix3JUJKb_k8 in the same vein; social commentary but more emphasis on sam's vlogging style and mannerisms. Ethan's 'coughing' = Sam's mic clipping except for its less gratting https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PjaKZHueP8 what I was talking about earlier -- the editing throughout is phenomenal https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2KIzcmuT5E&list=PL0O8ixe70Z252fAeg46H_1V5TcMnntL_U&index=51 sam's crazy outfits https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cS0jTbzd8Q8 little tack on for good measure; I personally think this video is absolute genius"
quityourbullshit,3bnqbf,mastermoebius,8,Wed Jul 1 02:41:45 2015 UTC,"One point, right off the fucking bat, Tim and Eric premiered a decade ago, the oldest MDE video is 5 years old. Not a contemporary in any ""contemporary"" artistic sense. For the record.   Beyond that each of MDEs video apparently are 1/2 an hour long so watching 2 1/2 hours worth of shit just to reply to your comment isn't going to happen.   1) Very very little about their reactions to these things are similar, critiquing videos and other youtubers is definitely not a unique nor stolen idea. Their pentameter is similar in ways, I get that, but not enough to justify stealing content. I know a few dudes that talk this way and have since long before youtube was even popular.  2) (for the record, I like plenty of MDE shit) but again social fucking commentary or reactionary video is very far from unique to either of these people, and certainly not evidence of any sort of ripping off.  3) Exactly what I was talking about, public access reactionary post-modernist shit. It's all over the fucking place and neither of these people invented it. MDE is way more over the top and grotesque and inappropriate about it, h3h3 only really utilizes that in their intro, and occasional spots, and there's sort of recurring fashion and things that deal with this aesthetic.   4) Sweatpants, tshirt, and a beanie. Fuck me, if you wear that in a youtube video you're stealing content from MDE? Again, it's an artistic trend to be sort of a white-ass dad. I was really hoping for some side-by-side comparisons as proof of ripping off, not ""hey look MDE wore sweats and a beanie, so no one else can make fun of gomers that actually wear that shit."" Come on, seriously, if you think MDE invented this shit, you're too young to know what the fuck you're on about.  5) Again this a whole fucking artistic aesthetic, and it leads me to believe you've seen very very few of h3h3 videos. I like both, a lot. They really really aren't similar.  I know you won't respect my opinion, you made that clear with ""if you're not convinced by then I really don't care anymore"". That's fair. I'm not out to prove anything either, I just wanted to see if the parallels were obvious enough that I should not respect h3h3. I'm just not seeing it, at all really. For me, you've clearly highlighted their differences.   Cheers man, and thank you for the effort honestly, it was cool to examine, regardless of outcome."
quityourbullshit,3bnqbf,SCATMANJAWN,-8,Wed Jul 1 03:10:38 2015 UTC,"Tim and Eric premiered a decade ago, the oldest MDE video is 5 years old. Not a contemporary in any ""contemporary"" artistic sense. For the record.    Sam's shot his first MDE video as his final project for college loooong before the channel was up. so my original point stands   Beyond that each of MDEs video apparently are 1/2 an hour long so watching 2 1/2 hours worth of shit just to reply to your comment isn't going to happen.    okay so you can't possibly grasp the comparison between the two   pentameter   nice try but google the word first   (for the record, I like plenty of MDE shit)   i definitely believe that ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)   public access reactionary post-modernist shit   haha what   Again, it's an artistic trend to be sort of a white-ass dad.   ...no definitely not that   it leads me to believe you've seen very very few of h3h3 videos   I mean maybe not as much as you have but I think I've watched enough to have a decent enough understanding of their message   I know you won't respect my opinion   No, its just you don't really have an opinion to speak of   I know a few dudes that talk this way and have since long before youtube was even popular.

Okay, I think you're missing the point I'm trying to make. It's a combination of all of these stylistic choices together that makes art what it is. Sure, there's all sorts of influences present in MDE, and sure certain elements from MDE videos have made their way into the wider youtube community. But plagiarism isn't stealing one little piece here and one little piece there, its taking all of the common components of a single artists' work and reusing them. You'd be hard pressed to find a 'side-by-side' comparison because those rarely exist in art (and if they do, someone gets sued). It's not like Ethan wears IDENTICAL hats as sam, or reacts the exact same way as him, but he makes all the same artistic and stylistic decisions so in my books he's a thief.    I just wanted to see if the parallels were obvious enough that I should not respect h3h3. I'm just not seeing it, at all really. For me, you've clearly highlighted their differences.    hmmmmmmm   Come on, seriously, if you think MDE invented this shit, you're too young to know what the fuck you're on about.   exactly, thats how you argue, call me a kid and you win"

So if I formed a jazz band that was heavily influenced by Miles Davis, I'd be a thief just because it sounds similar to Miles Davis? Even though the music isn't IDENTICAL at all, but it has the same artistic style to it, I'd be stealing?"
quityourbullshit,3bnqbf,SCATMANJAWN,-3,Wed Jul 1 04:03:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, because Miles Davis is recognized for his iconic trumpet tone. If you recorded a song where you played the trumpet with the exact same tone and style as him, improvised most of the parts, had the same backing ensemble he used, and named the track 'marly moocher' you'd have a problem. If you didn't get sued, people would at the very least hate your guts.   In fact, this exact same problem recently happened with the blurred lines lawsuit.

TPP (the trans-pacific partnership) is a deal Obama struck that essentially lays terms of an agreement of how intellectual property laws are handled internationally. He recently fast-tracked this to make it go into effect sooner than originally planned.  Confederate flag guy, thinks that Obama made gay marriage legal (the president has no power over the supreme court) as a smokescreen to outsource literally 50% of American jobs to China (I don't think the TPP even mentions the word ""jobs"")  Hope that helps!"

quityourbullshit,3blll5,a2089jha,2,Tue Jun 30 22:03:40 2015 UTC,"TPP is still (I think...) a proposed trade agreement. What Obama is pushing for, and recently received, is TPA or trade promotion authority (aka ""fast track""). Basically, the administration wants to negotiate a deal, and present the finished agreement to congress for an up or down vote without amendments. This is a power that the president has had in the past, expired, and was up for renewal.  There are IP bits in the leaked TPP documents, along with there are other, more traditionally trade things too. I'm not sure if anybody, aside from the negotiators and the president, really knows what is in the TPP.  As it is, if TPP really does suck, it can still be voted down by congress. The congress with that healthy 15% approval rating..."
quityourbullshit,3blll5,trismagestus,2,Tue Jun 30 18:30:31 2015 UTC,"if TPP really does suck, it can still be voted down by congress   It can be voted down, but they won't have a chance to look at it or debate it, because of the Fast Track.  It generally sucks though, as it gives corporations the ability to sue a country for practices that disadvantage them profit-wise. Say we pass a law banning fracking - that law can be challenged in a court run by international lawyers and the country involved can be forced to pay for the lost profits. Ban pollutants or shoddy products? Pay the difference.   It really is not a great trade deal for anyone who isn't a multinational corporation."

Of course they will have a chance to look at it. Nothing makes congress read these things, but the chance will be there.   Anyway, there is.. 45? days to debate it, and the amount of debate time is limited. There is a motion to close debate, and this is usually debatable; this motion will not be debatable under fast track, presumably to avoid filibusters.  This wikipedia link talks about the TPA process in general.  Please keep in mind that I'm not really discussing the merits of TPP itself, and really only the technical nature of TPP/TPA."

I know it's just a period of time, and I'll get over it, but I have some issues which were almost non-present when I lived with her.  I'm lucky I have my younger brother and a friend, who've helped me move out. They've also been coming around everyday since, and it is starting to help a lot.

quityourbullshit,3bfsdm,danjr321,2,Mon Jun 29 07:18:48 2015 UTC,"I've been fortunate in that most of the freelance work I've gotten over the years has pretty much fallen into my lap. I have a full-time web development job and do the freelance stuff on the side; a lot of my freelance clients have been friends or family of my work colleagues. So unfortunately I don't really have much advice for you in terms of finding work because I haven't ever had to look for it.   In terms of what to do once you get a project to work on... it sounds cliché, but client communication is key. Get their approval (preferably in writing) on every step of the project. The biggest headaches happen when you misinterpret what the client wants, spend a ton of time on something, and then find out that it isn't even close to what they had in mind. Some clients are easy to work with and are good at communication; others are mind-bogglingly terrible at it. Don't be afraid to fire a client if they're unreasonable or acting sketchy; there's just no way to work with someone who's dead-set on ripping you off."

Yeah my first ever client was a friend of a friend but I never made up a contract or a design spec etc and I was still in college (now in University) so I was just excited to get paid. It ended with me getting paid months after I was supposed to, and them asking for more than what they originally wanted (they wanted a simple WP theme made and then requested for me to make a shopping system for free...).  I think I need to mostly build my confidence to be in control, rather than worrying in case the client thinks that I am charging too much etc...  Thanks again!"

quityourbullshit,3bfsdm,ScienceWasLove,90,Mon Jun 29 04:44:07 2015 UTC,Lev 19:28 is specifically talking about using some ancient form of body modification in worship of a deity. I personally think Bible believers are pretty safe to ignore it. But what about if you get a tattoo in worship of Jesus?! Or all those people with cross tattoos?!

quityourbullshit,3bfsdm,graygrif,4,Mon Jun 29 01:30:25 2015 UTC,"Well, there's a WHOLE LOT of theological debate over that, but in the simplest form, yeah. It's why angels in old copies of the Bible don't have human forms, or why so many figures in printed texts seem to be half-human, half-animal- they're not technically graven images of existing things."

quityourbullshit,3bfsdm,sleeplessorion,7,Mon Jun 29 01:30:47 2015 UTC,I have some friends who got YHWH in Hebrew (the name of the Lord) tattooed on their arms. Their hearts were in the right place. But they didn't realize how offensive it is to a practicing Jew to have the most Holy Name tattooed on human flesh.
quityourbullshit,3bfsdm,remccainjr,10,Mon Jun 29 01:40:23 2015 UTC,"Here is something I found that speaks about what the possible meaning behind the original Hebrew word that is translated to ""tattoo"" in English and the reasons why it would have been prohibited in Old Testament times.  And here is something I found that analyzes both sides of the tattoo issue among Christians.    I think the issue that has to be answered by each person thinking about getting a tattoo is how will the tattoo affect other individual's relationship with God.  1 Corinthians 8 and Romans 14 talks about how Christians have a duty to ensure that their actions does not cause another individual's relationship with God to falter.  It can be argued that should a Christian sin while having a tattoo with Christian symbolism, especially if the tattoo is visible when the sin is committed, then the person who saw the sin being committed may either encourage them to sin or become a stumbling block, which is exactly what Paul warns Christians about in those two chapters cited above.  Please note that I feel that Christians should be asking themselves that line of questioning concerning every action they make, not just about getting a tattoo.  I feel one of the biggest problems Christianity is facing (at least in the US) is that too many times Christians are views as hypocrites.  I'm not saying that Christians as a whole need to adopt some of the more conservatives things pushed forward in the Bible, e.g. subservience of women, but rather that they should be careful about what they complain/rail against.  For example, Newt Gingrich stated that gay marriage was morally wrong according to the Bible, but yet the Bible also states that divorce, adultery, and getting married after getting divorces is also wrong (Gingrich has had two divorces and is with his third wife).  Jesus made it clear in Matthew 7:1-6 that Christians should be careful about what they pass judgement against because their standard of judgement will be used by others to judge them."
quityourbullshit,3bfsdm,Occams_Lazor_,8,Mon Jun 29 00:50:32 2015 UTC,"Well the bible also specifically says, ""if a man lays with another man, he shall be stoned"" so as long as we legalize marijuana at the same time, we'll be okay!"
quityourbullshit,3bfsdm,BigLebowskiBot,18,Mon Jun 29 01:24:27 2015 UTC,"Well from a Christian standpoint (non practicing but decently read I guess), Jesus's dying on the cross for our salvation cancelled out all that Old Testament nonsense (IIRC). Don't only people who practice Judaism follow Old Testament still? Or am I wrong?"
quityourbullshit,3bfsdm,CookieDoughCooter,11,Mon Jun 29 01:32:36 2015 UTC,"It's debatable.  Some denominations, like Seventh Day Adventist, believe that more of the Old Testament laws (such as dietary restrictions) apply than other denominations.  While others argue that only the moral laws apply to Christians today.  It really comes down to the denomination's, or the denominational family's, interpretation."
quityourbullshit,3bfsdm,morphine_wakeup,11,Mon Jun 29 03:43:44 2015 UTC,"It's the 'ritual laws' and the 'moral laws'. Not wearing mixed fibres is a ritual law. Not killing your neighbor and raping their wife is a moral law. Jesus' sacrifice supposedly made the ritual worship laws unneeded, as one did not need to practice such rituals to believe in His sacrifice."
quityourbullshit,3bfsdm,cameroncac,13,Mon Jun 29 00:41:15 2015 UTC,"You are correct, but a lot of people don't know that's how it works."
quityourbullshit,3bfsdm,graygrif,8,Mon Jun 29 01:39:28 2015 UTC,"Depends on if you want to believe the very words of Jesus Himself.   Matthew 5:17-18  17 “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. 18 For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.   So who do you believe? Jesus, or John the cult leader of the Corinthians with his crazy visions?"
quityourbullshit,3bfsdm,cameroncac,12,Mon Jun 29 01:42:28 2015 UTC,"It seems like he's saying that at first glance, but he's really not. Especially when you consider that this passage (not to mention the rest of the Gospels) is directly bracketed by Jesus doing exactly that.   And, the original Aramaic doesn't translate as well in that version. The verb Jesus used for ""abolish"" is closer to ""loosen"". He doesn't mean that the Old Law is not being changed at all; he's doing that in the same discourse in which he delivers that statement. He can't be saying that. He means that he is not coming in opposition to the Law or Prophets, but is more finishing what they started, ie fulfilling them."

They printed it in the bulletin as,   Our (Father, Mother, Creator, God) who art in Heaven, ...   When they recited it there was a silent pause from the pastor during that part so that everyone could insert what they wanted in that phrase."

Edit: I have no idea of what the Catholic Church's official opinion on it is, I'm almost certain that there is one, but I can't be bothered to dig up a document that may or may not be really in force, and probably is translated from latin."

quityourbullshit,3bh7ke,moonshinemicky,9,Mon Jun 29 12:48:32 2015 UTC,"Belle Gibson:       Annabelle Natalie ""Belle"" Gibson (born October 1991) is an Australian app developer, blogger, and alternative health advocate whose marketing platform was founded on her fraudulent claims of having donated significant income to charities, and of having foregone conventional cancer treatments to positively self-manage multiple cancers through diet and controversial alternative therapies.  Gibson is the author of the The Whole Pantry smartphone application and its later companion cookbook, both of which were subsequently withdrawn from sale. The Whole Pantry application was scheduled to be a default application on the – at that time unreleased – Apple Watch but was removed from Apple advertising after the controversy broke.     In early March 2015, after media reporting identified Gibson's apparently fraudulent claims of charity fundraising and donation-making, further media investigation soon revealed that Gibson had also apparently fabricated her stories of cancer, and lied about her age as well as other details of her personal life and history. Concerns were expressed that Gibson had led a profligate lifestyle, renting an upmarket town house, leasing a luxury car and office space, undergoing cosmetic dental procedures, purchasing designer clothes and holidaying internationally, on money claimed to have been raised or destined for charity.

quityourbullshit,3bge2v,FrostytheSnowColt,23,Mon Jul 20 08:55:07 2015 UTC,"""Men don't have to get creeped on half as much as women do""  Not a right. Why do you think this is? Is there something different about women compared to men that makes this happen?  ""Women can't watch a single commercial, tv show, movie, etc without seeing half naked chicks""  Not a right. I would blame the market and biology. Men are attractive to women and it sells, therefore more content of the type that sells is produced. Don't like it? I don't care for it but I ignore it as it does little to no harm.  ""Women are taught at a young age to be proper, have babies, and be moms.""  Not a right. What do many little girls like playing with? Barbie, dolls, dress up, taking care of a baby. Sure, some of the behavior is taught but I'd argue some of it is instinctual to act that way due to biology.  *""I remember being a kid, wanting to get dirty and play with dangerous things, and I always were told ""give that to your brother"" or ""you can't handle that"". "" *  Not a right. A question that would be excellent to think about is why in some cases women and men are treated differently than each other in specific circumstances. As you have given an anecdote concerning your childhood, why did people tell you that? Please don't latch onto the first thing that pops into your mind, keep thinking. Did other people tell that to your brothers? Were they trying to protect you or make things easier for you? Did they want to protect whatever you were holding (kids brake stuff right?) Do you see that happening to other children now that you are older?  ""People always bitch that women claim false rape, so now people barly believe the girls that do call rape.""  HAHAHAHAHAHAHA, they barely believe women? Sure but does Duke Lacrosse, Rolling Stone, Hofstra University ring a bell? Many of these women, that are proven later to be crying wolf, were taken at their word when they claimed they were raped. Some did not even file a police report but went through the college's system (which is not the legal system and therefore it is out of their power to handle criminal cases), those that wrote about the story were then shocked that the police did nothing, well of course not because they weren't informed until the accused was socially tarred and feathered. If those claiming they were raped went to the proper authorities then there is no problem, otherwise people bitch about it as it's not through the system that we, as a people, set up to handle.  What is the default position one should take, if they are to be honest, concerning any claim provided without any evidence? To dismiss it as there is no evidence to substantiate it. This is what the legal system is based on, yet has been perverted as of late, innocent until proven guilty and since the burden of proof is on the one making the claim it is up to the accuser to prove the accused guilty. Look up the Yes Means Yes law in California (or college policies concerning sexual assault and rape) and how they treat a person whom are accused, they are by default guilty. This here, is the violation and lack of rights for the accused, and who are the one's most likely to be accused? Men.  ""Not necissarily ""rights"", just unfair social norms that men don't seem to understand""  I would agree that there is some inherent unfairness in life that happens to both men and women, some we can change while others we cannot. We either learn to be helpless and let these trivially bad things (half naked chicks on tv and the like) to make us bitter persons OR we can learn some tolerance for behavior we do not agree with but harms no one.  Also, it's disingenuous to claim (without proof) that men don't understand that these social norms exist, ESPECIALLY after the media and feminism as been screaming it for the past few decades. WE KNOW ABOUT IT! EVERYONE KNOWS! The one's that do not, and think no one else does, are those that just learned about it, aka college students, or those pushing an agenda. Social norms are not a huge problem, it's up to the individual to do what they want and if people whine concerning that one's behavior (that does not harm anyone else) is not adhering to social norms, screw 'em. I encounter the same thing, social norms, yet I do not bitch about it to everyone saying it's horrible and bad, I ignore them."

Then it follows that they can be understood and it does not matter, as many feminists proclaim, who does the job they are both equally capable.  What you are doing is called special pleading, what you argue is that woman are a special case, an exception, when they are anything but that. You completely ignore anything else, communication what?, to make women into a victim class (we just can't understand their plight!!), you are a misogynist (according to feminists) since you consider women beneath men whom are unable to object to their supposed oppression. At the same time though, this is what feminism advocates for, that women are oppressed and men the oppressor, treating women special compared to men. A contradiction in their words and actions is it not?  You really wish men could keep an open mind? Men are specially tuned to the plight of women, it is what men are, protectors, or have you not noticed millions of men sent off to die during war? Do you even consider men human?"

At Artios Books on Turner Street, Walter Lantz had come into possession of more than 100 pages of what looked like a raw, type-written story called ""The Cannibals.""  It looked a lot like the real thing. The manuscript was slightly yellowed with age and the scribbled edits were all in place. Hopes that it was a genuine King first draft were bolstered by the fact that ""The Cannibals"" manuscript had once been reported lost by the famed Maine horror writer.  Not so fast, said spokeswoman Marsha DeFillipo. Lantz has a nice souvenir but not an original King.  At some point over the years, somebody simply printed out a copy of documents that had been made available on King's website. That printed copy would later end up at Lantz's store to cause a fun but short-lived buzz around the Twin Cities.  ""Turns out all he has is a printout of the pages that are on the website as we have two PDF docs that total 122 pages,"" DeFillipo said. ""We'd added the second document after people asked for more.""  Neither the spokeswoman nor the creepy author she represents blamed Lantz for the misunderstanding. No harm, in other words, and no foul.

We see polygamy recorded, even with some of the godliest men, but it often ends badly. Not everything recorded in the Bible is condoned, we see mistakes made by followers of God time and time again. Solomon had hundreds of wives, but they were ultimately responsible for the division of the kingdom of Israel. In the New Testament, all references to the duties/positions of husband and wife refer to each in the singular which again strongly implies monogamy, though the only explicit command is for overseers of the church (this doesn't include laity) to be the ""husband of one wife"" in 1 Timothy 3:2."

quityourbullshit,3bby59,TheIdesOfLurch,2,Sun Jun 28 19:41:10 2015 UTC,The way my pastors explained Song of Solomon to me back in middle school was that it basically represents godly love in a godly marriage.  Sounds fair enough to me.  On your opinion as a poet:  What's your favorite Bible book?
quityourbullshit,3bby59,Rakmon_,2,Wed Jul 1 03:00:03 2015 UTC,"I grew up without any kind of religion, and so my understanding is a bit more disengaged. My understanding of the Song of Songs and it's interpretation by Christian scholars is that it began as a litany between lovers, and, over the years, became to be know alternately as an allegory of the relationship between the Church and Christ, the relationship between God and the Virgin Mary, a description of, as you say, love and sex in a godly marriage, etc.   I am not a biblical scholar by any means, but my overall understanding is that this book is the most out-of-place of any books of that bible, and that exegetic interpretations over the centuries have been varied, but inclusive.   As my very limited role as a poet, I would say that the Song of Solomon is my very favorite book of the Bible. It contains so much strange, evocative imagistic language. It is not obscure in the way that Revelations or Ezekiel is -- incredibly interesting unto themselves, they are.   Song of Songs is my favorite because it is describing the feeling between human beings. We forget about God for a moment and revel in what is earthly; the strangeness of its imagery is related tot he strangeness of trying to use words to capture emotion, which is very much a poor tool to describe emotion."
quityourbullshit,3bby59,TheIdesOfLurch,3,Wed Jul 1 03:35:22 2015 UTC,"I have heard of some scholars trying to twist it into an allegory, but all the theologians or pastors I know read it as what it is, a song about a husband and wife (probably Solomon and one of his wives). The ones who twist it that I hear about seem pretty uncomfortable about sex, but the Christians I've met are all about sex (between a husband and wife) as a beautiful act of intimacy, something created by God, and something intended to be pleasurable and even fun, because it bonds a couple."

I always get nasty looks from family members when bringing that up during Seder.  Also, somewhat relevant, it's a common myth that they supposedly helped build pyramids. Instead, they helped build Pithom and Ramses, the first of which is only suspected to be a known archaeological site and the other is pretty much in doubt."
quityourbullshit,3bby59,goal2004,57,Thu Jul 2 04:43:07 2015 UTC,"Western society has redefined marriage multiple times.  In the early 1200s, the Pope issued a statement saying that a priest had to be witness to a marriage for it to be valid (This one).  Before that you just had to have a witness.  This is when marriage became one of the Christian sacraments, basically.  I don't know when exactly polygamy (multiple wives, not multiple husbands - I don't think that's ever been valid in the west) got knocked out, but that was a redefinition of marriage.  The idea of marrying someone you're in love with is only about four hundred years old (according to the Annals of Pornographie, anyway).  Before that, marriages were mostly business transactions: the parents of a girl would pay a dowry to the husband's family, essentially buying a share in a son (sons could make money accrue wealth and support old people, daughters mostly couldn't).  Also, the brides in these situations would usually have been underaged by modern standards.  The concept of an ""age of consent"" was a redefinition.  The idea that a woman could choose who she was going to marry, instead of marrying the man her father told her to, was a redefinition.  More recently, we've had the legalization of divorce, which was huge.  According to a strict Biblical interpretation, any ""marriage"" you have after your first one is an adulterous relationship and is subject to very similar punishments as homosexual relationships.  (EDIT: I didn't phrase this well, what with the Bible's acceptance of one man having multiple wives.  My understanding is if you'd abandoned a wife and married another one, that would have been considered adultery.  Thanks /u/tollfreecallsonly for pointing this out.)  Then we had interracial marriage, of course.  I've always been amused by the way the anti-gay-marriage crowd echoed the anti-interracial-marriage arguments almost word for word.  None of those arguments had any bearing on American Constitutional law.  The bottom line is we haven't been adhering to any Biblical definition of marriage for a long fucking time.  EDIT: there may be some inaccuracies in this post.  I'm half drunk and working on memory.  Corrections will be appreciated."

quityourbullshit,3bby59,alaricus,7,Sun Jun 28 01:16:22 2015 UTC,But the old testament seems fine with.multiple concurrent wives.  Just not adulterery.
quityourbullshit,3bby59,tollfreecallsonly,7,Sun Jun 28 00:14:33 2015 UTC,"The new testament is ok with multiple concurrent wives as well.  The only exception is that overseers were a class of Christian limited to one wife First Timothy 3:2   A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach   As mentioned by /u/alaricus, it was the Romans that forced Christians to change.    Actually, a LOT of Europe was monogamous and a lot of Asia Minor and the Levant was polygamous.  Some have suggested that monogamy gave the Europeans an edge when defending against invading Asians.  Normally if you King X takes King Y's lands, you keep on paying taxes but to a new king.  No biggie and not a tremendous reason to rick your neck.  However, Europeans knew that polygamy would be the rule of the Asians one, and that meant that the poorest European males would no longer have access to wives.  That is pretty good reason to put up a serious fight against King Y (AKA Xerxes I)."

quityourbullshit,3bby59,reverendfrag4,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:18:30 2015 UTC,"The Old Testament isn't really THAT okay with polygamy.  Sure, Solomon was swimming in pussy and David had a one night stand or two, but those are very, very clearly regarded as fuckups on their part that were ungodly.  After David boned Bathsheba (after seeing her bathe one day), he went 'oh fuck I just knocked this chick up, and she's already married, and her husband is in my army', had the husband abandoned during a battle, and let the enemies kill him.  Then he married Bathsheba himself.  This all resulted in God telling David (via a prophet) 'What the fuck, man?  That's so fucked.'  Bathsheba ends up miscarrying the child.  However, God calms down after David repents, and grants them another child - Solomon.  Solomon, as we all know, had 300 wives and 700 concubines.  All those ladies led him to fall out with God and begin building temples to their various idols instead of the God of Israel."

Yes, there are some monogamy-centric verses, and you have pointed those out, but one can find a few dozen verses that go the other way.  The bible clearly condones multiple wives, cuncubines, and sex slaves. One doesn't have to look very hard to find verses that lay that policy out.  /r/atheism used to list these verses on a daily basis, perhaps they still do.  As far as we know Jews, like all the groups in that part of world, practiced polygamy.  That being said, polygamy generally leads to very few amount of men with many wives, a very large amount of men with one wife, and a smaller amount of men with no wife.  Depending on how many wars had been fought recently, the 3rd group might be very small.  Any biblical author writing for the common man would have discussed marriage the way it was (1 man, 1 wife).  This doesn't mean such verses lay out the moral teachings (the bible is clearly pro-polygamy as far as I can tell), it simply means they are relevant to the majority of their intended audience."

In the former situation, you have a person engaging in god ordered polygamy.  Deuteronomy 22:28-29"

quityourbullshit,3bby59,DiscCovered,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:40:07 2015 UTC,"I acknowledge that there are verses that mention one man & one wife = marriage.  I am not denying that.  However, mentioning that marriage may be composed of one man & one wife (which describes more than 99% of marriages in a polygamous society.  Only the elite have enough resources to maintain 2+ wives) is not the same as requiring that it be.  There is no verse that stipulates that monogamy is a requirement or that polygamy is a sin.  There are plenty of verses that describe polygamous men as righteous men of God.  There is also the fact that the Pentateuch purports to contain an exhaustive list of sins, and yet it doesn't mention polygamy.  We also know that polygamy was practiced by ancient Jews and they didn't perceive it to be in violation of God's law.  We know that early Christians were polygamists as well, and that they didn't perceive that it was in violation of God's law.  Finally, we know that both Jews and Christians were forced by European cultural norms to switch over to monogamy in the current era.  Is the Bible unclear on the issue?  Sure.  But then the bible is vague, unclear, or contradictory on hundreds of issues.  There are some verses that vaguely seem to favor monogamy (and you have mentioned these).  At best one can say that, taken as a whole, the Bible is neutral towards polygamy.  I think the bible is more pro-polygamy than that, however. The Bible doesn't ever label polygamy a sin or a wrong behavior (except in the case of too many wives in the OT or overseers in the NT).  I feel that, on the whole the bible is slightly pro-polygamy, but due to the wiggle room in the text, I am more than willing to grant you that the bible might be neutral on the issue.  I cannot see the Bible as anti-polygamy, however, and we know that prior to 100 CE, Jews and Christians did not perceive the Bible as being anti-polygamy.  As for refuting Deut 22, what do you mean?  That God is not credited with claiming that rape victims should be killed or forced to marry their attackers? The Bible is quite clear on that and I am not aware of any wiggle room in the Hebrew.  There are other parts of the Pentateuch that claim that the man should be punished, but not the woman, in the case of a man-on-woman rape.  That gets back to my point that the bible is frequently contradictory.  However, it is generally acknowledged that the Pentateuch was written by four different authors.  It appears that one of these authors was much more misogynistic than another, and thus you have the mutually contradictory instructions on how to react to a rape.  If you want to refute one passage by saying that it is nullified by the contradictory passage, then you are disrespecting the Bible IMHO.  The passages on rape are quite clear and to pick one passage and claim it means the opposite of what is written is disrespectful to the Bible.  As a former minister, I have seen the phrase ""refuted by Biblical scholars"" quite a bit.  Often (but not always) what that boils down to is that a subset of Biblical scholars wrote so much about a topic, they were able to convince themselves that down was up, left was right, and in was out.  They then concluded that they refuted the clearly stated words of the Bible and discovered that it meant the opposite of what was written.  This type of theology is more common among Fundamentalist, evangelical, and Pentecostal types, but isn't completely lacking among other types of religious scholars."

quityourbullshit,3bby59,MuayThaiJudo,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:06:51 2015 UTC,"Not sure if someone else said this...but here's a quick explanation of this because it comes up a lot.   Everyone except Jesus in the bible is a sinner. It's their defining characteristic. The ones with multiple wives are usually the ones that would have been following the law of Moses which is the kosher foods / no tattoos / sacrificial animals / etc. which I believe allows multiple wives.   Later, Jesus came to fulfill the laws but also negated some of them. One was to say that it's good to eat all foods put on the earth, because that's why they're here. Another was about honoring and caring for your wife (singular) so pretty much all Christian religions take that to mean a single wife, not plural. I don't know the verses for this stuff but it's probably at least in Matthew and Mark.   Leviticus 18:22 is the line that says not to lie with a man as one would with a woman. However that's Old Testament and Jesus never addresses it. So it's an oft debated topic because other than a few disciples the New Testament is pretty quiet on homosexuality as well as some other laws / rules from the Old Testament. Tattoos, for instance, are banned right next to being gay. Yet a lot of Christian churches say you should just be mindful of what tattoos you get while also saying being gay is wrong even though they both have the same context as they are right next to one another in the chapter. Churches typically point to Paul also saying that being gay is wrong, but who's to say he wasn't saying that for another reason to the Romans or Corinthians (or whoever, I'm paraphrasing)? Maybe he felt one of the problems they were having was the result of gay sex.   Personally, I'm a Lutheran, but as far as homosexuality I believe the government shouldn't restrict it because there's no legal downside to do so, and religiously I'll let God make that call. Are gay people going to hell? I have no idea. I also don't know if it will rain tomorrow. I'll let God handle both of those. I have lesbian friends, they know I'm neutral and care about them, but we never talk about it beyond that. Or politics, or guns, or health. Because we know we'll disagree. But I will always support their legal marriage and attempt to gross them out when playing cards against humanity."

I don't personally get morality from religion. I find some of them historically interesting especially the more ancient ones that are millenia out of the main stream.    Either you're Christian/Jewish/Muslim/etc. or you're not, there's no inbetween in my eyes.    I'm none of those. But I can listen to and consider what they say without necessarily changing my beliefs.    Anything less is just hypocrisy.    Anything less is what all humans are. No one is all things all the time. Even the most religious zealots fall short of the ideals.   It's not hypocrisy, it's dogma."
quityourbullshit,3bby59,sumneradam,4,Sun Jun 28 14:10:28 2015 UTC,"I wasn't talking about you, specifically. I was just speaking in general terms. But I wonder. why would you be picking and choosing what works for you from different parts of religions if you don't get morality from religion? I think I misunderstood what you were saying, because that doesn't make sense to me.  And I think that the part about hypocrisy is a problem with religion in general if the ideals it upholds are unattainable. Following scripture to a ""T"" is unrealistic, so either nobody is actually a part of their religion if it demands strict adherence to Its rules, or anybody can call themselves a part of whatever they want, and anybody who says that they can't because they don't follow the rules is a hypocrite.   Or shit, I might be completely off base and have no idea what I'm talking about. That's always a possibility too."

quityourbullshit,3bby59,imtarrah,-3,Sun Jun 28 01:26:54 2015 UTC,The Biblical def of marriage is guy and girl not multiple girls. Just because there are stories of it in the Bible doesn't mean that that is the Biblical def of marriage. It was just talked about bc that was common in the time.
quityourbullshit,3bby59,MayorOfBellona,3,Sun Jun 28 03:02:37 2015 UTC,"God provides instructions to his people on how to make women from conquered tribes and make them into unwilling concubines.  This is not merely allowed, it is something God instructs people to do.     Deut. 21:10-14 When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the LORD thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast taken them captive, And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife; Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails; And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife. And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast humbled her.   The bible is extremely redundant.  The Pentateuch is supposed to have a list of all the thou-shalt-nots.  However, polygamy is not listed.  The Jews were polygamous (as were all the cultures in the Levant) and yet in the exhaustive list of sins, polygamy is never once mentioned.  Early Christians (just like the Jews before them) also practiced polygamy and the the New Testament does not mention it as a sin (though overseers are forbade the practice).  Abraham is considered to be a pretty righteous person.  Perhaps the most righteous person in the OT, yet God never bothered to tell him that he was in the wrong for having multiple wives and concubines.  From Numbers 31:   Now kill all the boys and all the women who have slept with a man.  Only the young girls who are virgins may live; you may keep them for yourselves. (also see Deut chapter 21)   Genesis 16 tells us how a man can sleep with or marry property of his wife.  The bible a fairly lengthy book that claims to contain a list of all the things God doesn't want people to do, and yet polygamy is no mentioned.  At the same time, a ban on idol worship is mentioned more times than I care to count.  Some of God's most favorite people (described of as righteous) have 2 or more wives.  Jews and Christians understood from the OT & NT that God was totally ok with polygamy.  The practice was stamped out among Christians in the first century AD, as you couldn't be a Roman citizen and practice polygamy."

If Wordpress fits my needs for a project then why wouldn't I use it?

Some really large websites use WP that I wouldn't consider 'unprofessional'.

I've always wondered how one actually proves they have earned a belt since I'm sure it's easy to just purchase one online. But I guess it's like serving in the military there are just some questions you'll be able to answer off the top of your head.
quityourbullshit,3b9wj9,NegroNerd,4,Sun Jun 28 23:19:36 2015 UTC,"If you do enough research, you'll be able to get by faking it with name dropping (instructors, schools, techniques, etc.) but sparring will tell all. You can tell within the first 30 seconds of rolling with someone if they're a black belt or not, if they were a wrestler, if they're a Judo practitioner, etc. It's hard to fake grappling skills in BJJ because sparring is part of a daily exercise and the martial art itself is scientific in every aspect. I've grappled with Black Belts before as a white belt in BJJ. It's lie drowning, you feel stupid for every mistake you make, and worse yet, the black belt doesn't use much strength, instead uses superior technique and experience to submit you. It feels unfair that it's seems so effortless for them, but that's the results of 10-15 years of training and fighting. :)"

It isn't like some boy scout bullshit where you rock up to one class, learn how to do to something and get a badge for it.   This man (Ruben Alvarez) would have spent years and years training to achieve what he did. He's have persevered through mental, physical, and emotional challenges to achieve a black belt. And then for someone to come in and disrespect something you have given blood, sweat, and tears towards is pretty awful. So don't compare it to a Boy Scout badge, because that's absolute bullshit."

It's a right to a service from another individual and his/her team. I never knew he considered court appointed attorneys modern slaves."
quityourbullshit,3b5dqf,crybannanna,4,Fri Jun 26 03:02:24 2015 UTC,The difference is that the government is the one charging the person with a crime in the first place.
quityourbullshit,3b5dqf,setagaya,3,Fri Jun 26 05:33:02 2015 UTC,"Sure, but that's no excuse for slavery. You can represent yourself in court as easily as you can suture your own wounds.   Either making the service of another person a right is slavery, or it isn't. (Hint: it isn't)"
quityourbullshit,3b5dqf,crybannanna,-8,Fri Jun 26 14:27:19 2015 UTC,Hint. That is exactly what slavery is. Apply it to everything and see how well you like it. If people can come to my house and force me to set up a network in their home and I am not free to refuse it. What would you call it? What if people could grab you from your home because they have a right to have their cotton harvested? Is that slavery?
quityourbullshit,3b5dqf,Dishevel,13,Fri Jun 26 15:43:53 2015 UTC,"You don't seem to understand. No one is being forced from their home to work in any field. That's an absurd exaggeration.   Firstly, no one is forced to become a doctor or a lawyer. That's a voluntary process.   Second, no one is forced to continue working as a doctor or a lawyer. Also voluntary, and often financially rewarding.   Third, people who choose to be doctors and lawyers are financially compensated. Not conscripted.  Fourth, voluntarily choosing and continuing a profession is not the same as being able to determine your clients. If you choose to be a doctor, and in your work (which is voluntary) you are mandated to accept clients... That is not the same as being a slave by any definition. You can quit your practice if you like... No one will stop you.   By your definition, all work is slavery. You get told what to do, who your clients are going to be, and when your work is needed. Except the big whopping difference is you can quit whenever you like... No one forces you to continue working in a given field. No one is suggesting otherwise. I might add, that no one is suggesting doctors not get paid by treating people... They are just saying the pay would come from an alternate source.   Trying to compare slavery to this is just dishonest, and I have to believe you know that. I am certain Rand Paul knows it."
quityourbullshit,3b5dqf,crybannanna,2,Fri Jun 26 17:52:27 2015 UTC,"The irony here is that Libertarians have always used the ""freedom of choice of employment"" argument to reject things like a minimum wage and regulation of workplace conditions, etc, precisely because ""no one is holding a gun to your head as an employee, you are free to go elsewhere if you don't like it"".  So for them to defend this line of reasoning here makes very little sense."
quityourbullshit,3b5dqf,hepheuua,2,Mon Jun 29 06:32:35 2015 UTC,"I suppose in those cases, the government is enslaving the corporations by making them pay a decent wage. It's not entirely inconsistent, they seem to see all government t intervention this way. It's insane, but it has an internal consistency to it.   In all cases, the government is evil and every rule is a form of slavery. The funniest part, is using this logic they could argue that the governments ending of slavery itself was an overstep. It enslaved the slave owners by forcing them to free their slaves. Logically, if government restrictions are slavery, than the ending of slavery by governmental intervention was slavery.   I have no problem arguing the benefits/problems of government intervention, but when things are erroneously reduced to the most absurd degree there is no hope of reasoned debate. Likening voluntary work with slavery is a rhetorical tool for imbeciles. It's like considering a schoolyard bully a nazi.  It's so fundamentally untrue, that it hobbles the original argument and makes the conversation a lesson in vocabulary and history."
quityourbullshit,3b5dqf,crybannanna,0,Mon Jun 29 16:08:37 2015 UTC,"You are confusing positive rights with negative rights, which is the source of your logical fault.

The right to enslave is not natural law, you aren't oppressing slave owners by upholding freedom, there is no paradox."
quityourbullshit,3b5dqf,NeedsLoomis,2,Wed Jul 1 12:32:24 2015 UTC,"I'm aware of that... I'm suggesting that this is their logic, not my own."
quityourbullshit,3b5dqf,crybannanna,0,Wed Jul 1 13:24:34 2015 UTC,If you've been following along you would have noticed that this line of thinking has already been discarded as nonsense.  The right is not to conscript a doctor into service to you.  The right is to have access to medical care just as you have a right to legal council.
quityourbullshit,3b5dqf,brufleth,-3,Fri Jun 26 16:06:42 2015 UTC,"Understand. Except for a few things. 1) Rights. Rights can not be something you have to take from someone else. Rights are things that can not be taken from you. (Yes. The right to a lawyer is a bad right. Should not exist. Instead I would suggest a legal system that does not require lawyers. Simple laws are good laws.)    2) Every one of these fake rights people demand, Right to an Attorney, Right to Medical Care, Right to a Cell Phone, Right to Welfare and so on, every one has to be paid for by someone else. These monies are taken by the government. If you wish to not comply it will be taken by force. If you want to say something is good and it would be nice if we decided to provide it. That is an argument we can have. By just stating that a thing is a right though shows either shallow thinking or shows that the person is willing to lie a bit to win the argument. Bad. TLDR:   Rights are never a thing you take from another person. Rights are things that a government should promise to not take from you."
quityourbullshit,3b5dqf,Dishevel,2,Fri Jun 26 16:35:40 2015 UTC,"You don't seem to understand the concept of normative rights, which is the way in which people are using the word ""right"" when they talk about right to a lawyer, right to healthcare, etc.  In other words, unlike many Libertarians, these people don't claim that rights exist as objective indisputable 'laws of nature', that we somehow offend the sensibilities of the Universe when we fail to uphold them...what they mean when they talk about rights is that we have a capacity, as individuals, and as a society, to establish principles for the way we want to live, for the kind of society we want to be a part of, and that we can instantiate fundamental expressions of that as political 'rights' that we want to embed in the constitution and laws of that society.  Rights, for them, then, are always human-made, and are agreed upon through the democratic process.  You, and many Libertarians, have a different conception of what rights are, namely that they're either God-given, or somehow endowed on us all by the Universe, not constructed and agreed upon.  That's fine, but simply restating that conception of rights as if it's the only one, then implying other people are using the word incorrectly because they work with a different one, doesn't work on any level...it just suggests that you don't actually understand what you're arguing against."
quityourbullshit,3b5dqf,hepheuua,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:37:46 2015 UTC,"I understand their existence.  But when your positive, normative right interferes with a person's natural, negative rights, we have a problem."
quityourbullshit,3b5dqf,Dishevel,2,Mon Jun 29 12:51:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure the distinction between negative rights and positive rights is as clear as a lot of people like to make out it is.  Let me give you a thought experiment.  Say you and I live on a remote island.  Just the two of us.  Neither of us have any chance of getting off the island or living elsewhere.  This island has a certain amount of food.  I got here a little bit earlier than you, so I have secured all the food sources and am productively working them.  But I don't want you to have food.  You ask me if you can have some?  I say, no, by natural right it is mine, I own it, I've mixed my labour with it, and I can choose whether or not to give you any.  You say, well can I work for you? help you produce and have a little bit of what I produce in return?  I say, no.  I have no interest in hiring you.  I simply don't want you to have the food.  Now on a Libertarian account, if we follow the logic through, you should agree to sit there and starve, and die, because I'm not 'taking' your life, I'm not impinging on your negative right not to be killed, I'm simply influencing the conditions, by exercising my right to property, within which you struggle to sustain it.  Not my problem.  I'm not directly killing you, right?  Except I do seem to be killing you, nevertheless.  So you either end up in one of two places with this thought experiment.  You either say that it is natural that the person has no right to the food, that they should quietly starve and die and bother its owner no longer; or you feel that the starving person has a right to sustain their life, and so has a right to 'reasonable access' to the food, and therefore, the rightful owner of the food, has a positive obligation to provide that access.  If you fall on the former then I'm not sure what else I can say.  I think all talk of rights probably goes right out the window for the starving person at that point.  It becomes basic survival.  If you fall on the latter, then you've basically admitted that the idea of negative rights, particularly in the case of a purely 'negative right not to be killed', get a bit complicated when you follow them through - to the point where they seem to sometimes entail positive duties on behalf of another.  Maybe there's another option.  What do you think about the thought experiment?  Does the starving person have a right to access to the food?"
quityourbullshit,3b5dqf,hepheuua,-1,Tue Jun 30 11:01:48 2015 UTC,"In that case...  Dose not matter. Person without food will attempt not to die. Other persons rights be damned. Of course none of the arguments we are having in the US are anything close to complicated. Nice one.   Natural, negative rights will always be what they are, but... 'The right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness"""
quityourbullshit,3b5dqf,Dishevel,4,Tue Jun 30 12:36:10 2015 UTC,"Oh so you're just a crazy idealist.  Got it.  Well.  There are still some places you can probably go with virtually no rule of law.  They're generally total shit holes, but fuck infrastructure right?  That's just another word for ""theft and out of control government spending"" right?  Good luck finding your utopia."
quityourbullshit,3b5dqf,brufleth,-7,Fri Jun 26 17:02:45 2015 UTC,"Again. If we think something is a good idea, we can argue it. Trying to win by calling something a right that is not one is a bad way of going about it. I am not saying that roads are a bad idea. We pay for them. No one had to scream ""Roads are a fucking RIGHT!"" to get them built. They show the cost / benefit, argued their case and won. What is so bad about honest? Healthcare paid by the public, may be a good thing. It though is not a ""Right"". Great job trying to win your point by making a point for me that you could defeat though. True sign of an idiot."
quityourbullshit,3b5dqf,Dishevel,2,Fri Jun 26 17:14:30 2015 UTC,"But it could quite easily be argued that there are no such things as the types of rights you're talking about.  Essentially it always comes down to a ""should"" statement on your behalf.  Right to life?  Wrong.  I can dispute that by shooting you in the face.  Right to property?  Wrong.  Watch as I negate that supposed 'right' by taking what I want from you.  It will always come down to an argument of what ""should"" be the case, not what ""is"", and that's no different from those who argue that health care should be a right, or a minimum living wage should be a right.  What you mean isn't that you have a 'right to life' but that you should have a right to life.  It's not different, it's just that Libertarians try and pretend that they're not saying ""should"", that they're simply describing something that ""is""...you're just trying to give illegitimate authority to a particular set of rights that you feel strongly ""should"" be rights, and then turning around and trying to argue that because you're not saying ""should"", but ""is"", that they're the only ones that matter and everyone else is using the term incorrectly."
quityourbullshit,3b5dqf,hepheuua,2,Mon Jun 29 06:42:42 2015 UTC,"TLDR: Rights are never a thing you take from another person. Rights are things that a government should promise to not take from you.   So what would you consider a hospital turning away someone ill because they can't afford the payment? Is that not them taking away the right to live or good health?  How about the people, who whilst do have ok medical cover, end up hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, simply because (through no fault of their own) they ended up hurt or sick? Is that not also taking away their right to health and a living.  How about if I talk to you in economics too? Maybe, by not helping the sick, you're taking away those persons rights to contribute to society and the economy? What about someone who is fighting for the American dream of working hard and for themselves, operating their independent business, helping and growing their local community. Would that person be able to work, employ people, grow the local economy etc, if they can no longer sustain their business because they're thousands of dollars in debt due to an unforeseen illness?  What about the people in society who offer vital roles and yet are paid a pittance and get no credit. Nurses, teachers, carers...  I'm English and have grown up with the wonderful NHS. At the time I make around $25k and pay about $120 in National Insurance a month. That covers the UK's NHS, unemployment benefits, sickness benefits, maternity leave and my own personal state pension. That's a fucking bargain. If I was earning $30k, it'd be $180 and it's still a bargain.   How much do you pay for your health insurance alone? Does it cover everything but basic dental and eye care like mine? A lot of anti-UH Americans cite not needing it, so why shoudl they pay for someone else to use it, as a reason not to pay the government for it. But, do you not mostly still pay independent organisations for it and still not need it? Would you rather selfishly pay a business your money, knwing it lines the pockets of a few businessmen, or you government knowing someone somewhere else might actually have a better life for it?  And shall we take a step back and look at exactly how your 'right' to not be taken from is working for you. According to this 2011 study, not only is (compared to 10 other Western countries) America's healthcare system the worst, but it also costs over $5k per capita more to run that than the number 1 positions (the UK).   So how exactly is your attitude benefiting you and your country?"

So in effect these people are making a choice. Same thing. Once you start defining rights as something that must be given to a person you go down a slippery slope from which there will be no recovery.

The republican nominee game feels unusually weak this election, and should Bernie be nominated he would be sent into a multitude of debates and interviews which is where he shines, what he suffers from is a lack of attention from a public fascinated by the prospect of a female President.  Still though, if it's Bernie vs Jeb Bush/Marco Rubio/Rand Paul/whatever it'll be white guy vs white guy, meaning minority or female votes won't be swayed by any candidates background, but by their political views, where Bernie represents the masses far better."

Services of another professional are counted as a ""right"", and it is not considered slavery by anyone.   Pointing out the differences doesn't change the fundamental similarity. Legal right to service =/= slavery.   The doctor, just like the lawyer, would have the right to leave the profession. He would have the right to never become a doctor. He would get compensated for his work. How could anyone with a functioning brain not see how it differs from slavery in the most fundamental way?    I'm not saying it should be a right, just that it's absurd to consider it in any way close to slavery considering it doesn't equate in any way."

To be fair, Paul was also arguing against an idiotic strawman. Sanders obviously isn't arguing that health care is a right in the sense that doctors should be obligated to treat patients free of charge. He's arguing that the government should pay for quality health care for everyone, regardless of ability to pay."

It was pretty serious and she had to have surgery and... I think some sort of radiation therapy? (Again, sorry, I'm pulling these memories from 8 year old me.) She made a full recovery and it was hailed in the family as a miracle.   Aaaaaanyway, right around this same time my aunt suddenly developed breast cancer in both breasts. She was ""sick"" for months, and was always using her ""cancer"" as an excuse to get out of things. She was supposed to get a double mastectomy when suddenly she made a miraculous recovery! Isn't it amazing everyone? Her boobies are saved! Until a few years later of course when she had breast and lung cancer. And then fibromyalgia. And MS. And a witch turned her into a newt. But she got better.  It wasn't until I was much older that my mom told me my aunt had made all this shit up but even as a wee lad I remember thinking this lady was bonkers.

quityourbullshit,3azalt,Backfjre,2,Wed Jun 24 22:43:51 2015 UTC,Care to share what they are and what you like about Android that iOS lacks?
quityourbullshit,3azalt,DARIF,10,Thu Jun 25 06:48:24 2015 UTC,"Android in general I'm just aware is more open and customizable so my perception is that it would be a better match for me over stock iOS.  With Jailbreak though there is some dynamic that has created some hugely powerful tweaks, probably because it's so well centralized by Saurik. The combination of all these great tweaks becomes part of my usage habits, and now I can't live without them. Off the top of my head:  -Activator: The most powerful gesture program for any device ever. The possibilities are literally endless. I have a ton gestures set up for easy music control, constant efficient brightness control, and all other QOL uses. I also have set a daily reboot at 5am, and there's about a million other possibilities that one paragraph wouldn't do it justice.  -ICaughtU: Essentially, if the PIN number on my phone is entered incorrectly twice this tweak makes the phone take a picture through the front and back camera, a picture of the GPS location of the phone in maps, and emails all that to my email address with a time stamp. If someone tries to get into my phone (or I'm sleepily failing to) then I'll immediately know when, where, and who is trying.  -Themes/Customs: Nightmode for a consistent dark gray/red theme across the entire device, Colorflow for a dynamic music app/lock screen based on album covers of music, NextGenUI5 for a unique home screen that is just fun.  I'm beginning to ramble. I guess my point is that I'm extremely familiar with iOS and I love it's user friendly intuitive design. With jailbreak I can easily layer on top of that my specific customizations and controls. My device is perfect for me, and I'm not sure I could recreate that on a Windows phone or Android, and since I'm so happy with what I have, I see no reason to jump ship at the moment."
quityourbullshit,3azalt,Lotronex,3,Wed Jun 24 23:13:38 2015 UTC,that sounds awesome. how do you do this?
quityourbullshit,3azalt,frankysnes93,5,Wed Jun 24 23:54:04 2015 UTC,"It's pretty easy.  Which iPhone are you on, and which OS?  With those 2 things, you can just download the jailbreak program on your computer, plug in your phone and hit Jailbreak.  After a few minutes your phone will reboot and you'll have a new app called Cydia, the ""App Store"" for Jailbreak tweaks.  Load up Cydia once and it'll set up file systems, then your phone will reboot. Then load Cydia again, refresh apps, and go download tweaks!  Personally, I look at ""Must have tweaks on iOS 7!"" Or similar YouTube videos like that, then just use search in Cydia. The tweak should have the appropriate compatibility details displayed.  Currently iOS 8.1.3-8.3 is jailbreakable, but a crucial tweak needs to be updated first so if you're after 8.1.2 it'll be a day or so before you should jailbreak that.  This was a really brief summary of the experience, for any and all questions definitely go to /r/jailbreak, they have guides and FAQs all over the gaf.  There's a learning curve, but it's not steep, figure out the basics and you'll be set."

quityourbullshit,3azalt,gtroare,2,Thu Jun 25 01:54:32 2015 UTC,"Yep no problem! With jail breaking you won't have to reset your phone. Do you know what OS you're on?  Check it with Settings < General < About and look at Version, what numbers does it say there?"
quityourbullshit,3azalt,EffYourCouch,4,Thu Jun 25 03:52:01 2015 UTC,"With Jailbreak though there is some dynamic that has created some hugely powerful tweaks, probably because it's so well centralized by Saurik.   Same for Android: XDAdevelopers+Xposed+apks can be installed from any source on stock phones anyway  Alternatives to your tweaks: Tasker for gestures and Nova Launcher+custom themes+icon packs+gravitybox for themes. Cerberus is a good anti theft app, don't know if it has that exact functionality but it can can be flashed as a system app making it almost impossible to remove. Nightmode looks nice, anyone know if there's anything for this on Android?

I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis in December, and now suddenly she suffers from a debilitating case of it. She has to be on 9 different medications for it (I am on 3), but tells me I should take an antibiotic and I will be cured.  She uses these excuses and lies as a means to justify her perfectly shitty attitude and outlook on life, and as a reason to just shit on every single person who has ever given her the time of day, including her daughter (me.)

I got over 300 new subs today and my skype blew up for roughly 8 hours straight with hundreds of compliments about how dam funny it would have been and what a good actor I am. I have mental issues ? lol I know how to have fun with the game and do funny shit like troll. Evolve thinks this is real life and takes it serious like a business.

I have no clue where he's getting being ""number 1"" from but I can see now that's precisely where the person in OP's photos realized it was just Mario. I thought it was like a well known fact that this Mario guy was really good but it's obvious he was tooting his own horn, which is pretty fucking stupid, let alone not knowing wtf an IP address is. Could have at least tried."
quityourbullshit,3azuri,spellingerror,15,Tue Jul 14 19:46:33 2015 UTC,"At a quick glance Mario has created;   /u/lmario4LYF3l /u/Aticuss /u/anonymous69GTA /u/CloggedOpossum   to defend himself and make it look like people agree with him... Either that or those three were browsing reddit and decided that this injustice was the final straw and that they had to make accounts just to defend Mario... I don't even know who the fuck ""evolve"" is but wow this guy is pretty sad..."
quityourbullshit,3azuri,spellingerror,0,Thu Jun 25 10:51:05 2015 UTC,"I believe the same thing but would add /u/perpetualplex to the list. Mario's account was made just to comment on this post and commented within an hour after it was posted. After that it looks like a struggle war. It's all too convenient and too quick so I believe OP and Mario are one and the same and this post is one big troll.  Also OP in the screen shot would have to already know Mario IP address before calling him out. Only way that would happen is if A. He looked at it before and has a really good memory, B. No IP Staged or C. OP is Mario and no IP."
quityourbullshit,3azuri,spellingerror,10,Thu Jun 25 11:04:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not mario, look at my post history. I am the leader of another GTAV stunting team, SHRED BMX. I am in a community skype chat, the screen shot links were posted there by an Evolve member along with the matching IP screenshots that I didn't include because of privacy rules on reddit. I just really wanted to put this guy in a public setting and watch him go off. It's worked out well so far."
quityourbullshit,3azuri,Dystrophy_of_Ideal,-8,Thu Jun 25 12:48:40 2015 UTC,I can't 100% say you are Mario or the other accounts are you but the timing of your posting and him commenting is too close to say that Mario isn't you. It's way too convenient. It's more probable that you are also Mario or Mario and you are friends from the time frame of responses. Even if Mario visits every day on QYBS it's still slim he stumbled on this post in that time. So only probable scenarios is you told him about your post or even more plausible is your him and trying to reap karma by playing victim and Mario being the bad guy. I don't even know if Mario is a person or made up persona; if he is a real person then does he frequent reddit? Is he famous? I am saying no on all accounts because his name would had been taken a long time ago before 30 minutes after this was posted.  So which is it?  Note: keep on mind I am talking about the reddit account not the twitter or game.
quityourbullshit,3azuri,Toraden,7,Thu Jun 25 22:26:09 2015 UTC,"Dude   I'm not mario  There are 41 people in the stunting community in that chat, few people from almost every team, one of them sent him the reddit link and that's why he responded so quickly. I put the link there after I posted it."
quityourbullshit,3azuri,CloggedOpossum,-5,Fri Jun 26 02:20:18 2015 UTC,So basically you left a trail strait to this post so he would come in and create drama with you after he failed to troll you.
quityourbullshit,3azuri,Toraden,2,Fri Jun 26 10:57:20 2015 UTC,"You need to keep up to speed here man, I've said this several times.  I. Am. A. Third. Party.  I am not in Evolve, I am not Mario and yes I did leave a nice trail for him to follow, come here and rant as he does. For entertainment. I was pretty damn entertained, I don't know what your issue is. I have only talked to Mario once before this, and it was a very short conversation. I didn't come here to 'create drama' I came here to CALL OUT A BULLSHITTER. I didn't even know if he used reddit, if anyone would actually send him the link but I of course was hoping this would happen."

Don't know if it was part of your edit or if I just missed it, but during his long winded messages the other guy could just have looked up his IP... Also apparently OP said in the comments he's not even a member of evolve?"
quityourbullshit,3azuri,Toraden,-13,Thu Jun 25 11:08:41 2015 UTC,"I'm cloggedopossum, this isnt a ""fake account"" dumbass. Do you think of yourself as some kind of detective? And I'm in the stunting community, so I wasn't just ""browsing reddit"", the whole community knows about this shit. And if you're not in the community, then your opinion is invalid. You have no idea whats going on and your basing your opinion off of one persons side of the story. And if you have no idea who evolve is, then you have no business even commenting on this"
quityourbullshit,3azuri,CloggedOpossum,8,Thu Jun 25 11:15:27 2015 UTC,"... Well since this is /r/quityourbullshit and I'm commenting on a thread were someone was called on their bullshit I can comment however I want, but thanks for your input.   And sure, if this happens all the the time on this sub or even reddit in general then surely you'd have commented somewhere else before now, instead of just making an account to defend Mario (whoever the fuck he is) in this particular post?   And no, not a detective, just someone bored at work who noticed that 3 accounts had popped up to defend Mario who all write long winded comments that look like they were typed by 12 year olds..."
quityourbullshit,3azuri,Toraden,-13,Thu Jun 25 11:20:12 2015 UTC,"I made an account a long time ago, I never really use it. And no, this is huge, this doesn't happen often. And seriously, did you even read what I wrote? No 12 year old would say that. And what really happened is mario was just trolling evolve. And now everyone is trying to make it viral. As you can see, anyone who defended mario immediately has 10 downvotes, and anyone disagreeing with mario has 10 upvotes."
quityourbullshit,3azuri,Toraden,8,Thu Jun 25 11:28:23 2015 UTC,"Hahaha you have apparently never used reddit before especially since you claimed here that people were deleting your comments, so here's 3 things you should know for free;   When someone makes a post in Reddit they don't get to control the comments in the thread, so the only people who can delete a comment are A) the person who wrote it and B) the mods/ admins, and I'm pretty sure they don't give a fuck about your comments since they don't give a fuck about ""stunting"" as this is /r/quityourbullshit  When a comment gets deleted on reddit it doens't disappear, it get's replaced with;  [deleted] And since there are only two deleted comments in this thread, both of which the mario account has admitted to posting, you're either talking complete and utter shit about your comments being ""deleted"" or you just admitted to being Mario. Your profile page shows how long you've been a redditor, 24 days is not ""a long time"", but fair enough it's older than the Mario account, which makes me think this was your ""Original"" account that you browse with and saw this post so decided to make the other accounts to defend yourself.   So either your Mario or your a ""fanboi"", I don't know which is sadder atm.    And no, this is huge, this doesn't happen often   I beg to differ, it's incredibly pathetic and sad, ""hur dur I tried to troll evolve why wont you believe me! They're all assholes which is why I was trying to troll them!""   did you even read what I wrote? No 12 year old would say that   ""this is huge, this doesn't happen often""  ""this isnt a ""fake account"" dumbass""  ""And if you're not in the community, then your opinion is invalid.""  ""if you have no idea who evolve is, then you have no business even commenting on this""  ...Umm yes, yes they would."

He tried to convince some people of one thing, got called out then said ""hur dur you're all idiots, I was trolling the whole time"" as if he had fooled anyone, then he came here and attempted to defend himself?

I mean I had a lot to say but its just cause I hate seeing these guys go around lying about me. they need to stick to facts, accuracy and stick to the stunting skill since this is what we do. I told the leader that he needs to loosen up and get a real life and stop trying to be a somebody in the game cause that actually gets you nowhere. I stunt to and have a channel but Its just a game to me thats why I do trolls like this cause its just a game and I don't take it serious enough to care about the professionalism in it. So i can have fun and just mess around like this sometimes. But evolve oh good lord they see it and decide lets change it up make mario look bad and spam twitter and every website we can we need everyone to hate mario since we cant compete with his skill that he doesnt even try at. we need mario gone so we can go back to calling ourselves the best in the world and walk over everyone else lmao. I'm sorry you had to waste a part of your day reading something so dumb that you probably gave 0 fucks about and if your a viewer of either of us you will probably just keep on watching anyways cause who cares about this personal crap. I'm a troll and evolve likes to lie oh well still gonna watch the video :P"

quityourbullshit,3azuri,Dave_McDavis,-19,Thu Jun 25 00:19:19 2015 UTC,I didnt even delete that. I only deleted one text and only because I hit it by mistake when trying to reply then re deleted it when OP thought i was trying to hide it and i only re deleted cause i re posted and and it was getting comments on both and that was kinda dumb so i said bring this chat to just one spot. I thought that post was still up there is nothing in that i dont want to be seen   scroll to my other comment and click the links showing that 128 people were in on this troll then the other picture from a week ago showing me talk about how mad evolve will be when i reveal its me. undeniably proving that This was in fact a troll and evolve and the OP is lying through their teeth desperately trying to say that the troll part was just a cover up. Evolve is so desperate to try and convince everyone that I want to be in their team and thats only because they are embarrassed that they bugged me to join them and I said no. I SAID NO... clearly i dont want to be in their team. but they are embarrassed clearly and really want people to think it is them who are rejecting me and not the other way around. like that cocky girl who gets rejected by a guy then acts like she was the one who didnt want him (thats evolve) go ahead go look at the photos evolve tries to hard. they then saw a comment on it and said that was me so i posted another photo proving its someone else. I have a real life and know how to have fun in this game and just fuck around and do funny shit like troll people. evolve and OP are so pathetic because they think this shit matters and is real life and try to treat it like a business. hilariously i got over 300 new subs today and nothing but 8 hours of compliments from every other team and the rest of the community about how dam funny it would have been.
quityourbullshit,3azuri,Alabaster_Sugarfoot,18,Thu Jun 25 03:57:36 2015 UTC,Man does your bike only go in reverse? Seriously quit your backpedaling and own up to being a jealous child.
quityourbullshit,3azuri,grungebot5000,-18,Thu Jun 25 06:26:33 2015 UTC,lmao bruh im done with you. your trying to argue what i was doing after i posted proof lmao thats insane.
quityourbullshit,3azuri,SmoSays,10,Thu Jun 25 07:04:57 2015 UTC,"Good, just read this. There is one part that I agree with... That all this doesn't matter. The game, the argument and all the negativity. You have fun doing stunts in gta? Great! Do other people bother you about it? Ignore them. They think your not the best or a backpedaling troll? It like you said, it doesn't matter! Make your videos but stay out of these weird and frankly immature politics, its not doing you any good."
quityourbullshit,3azuri,SmoSays,-18,Thu Jun 25 07:06:22 2015 UTC,"you are right about that and thats what i do but I use to be friendly with these guys. then over time I watched as they went to every other teams videos and would dislike and even comment dislike as they would legit sit there listing why they suck and why their team is still better. thats not so bad kinda pathetic but okay. then i started to see them try to end other teams and recruit their members so that team would have to stop cause their members gone. maybe just a theory but they would actually be bold enough to be like we are going to absorb this team so not a theory anymore. I would receive screen shots people would send me of chats with their team members where they talk pure shit to kids who are trying to be nice. ive witnessed so much these kids being is a chat and someone trying to be very very nice to them and they are like shut up cunts were the best and just talking shit its insane. I have seen them lie to try so hard to make poeple look bad because these guys want everyone else gone and it to be only them. thats not what stunting in this game is about it use to be everyone doing it and sharing but now these guys dont actually care about stunting all they care about is their popularity in it so they want everyone else gone. and they want to have everyone whos big. i became number 1 in jet stunting and even they admit it. they tried to bug me to join and I said no and suddenly I suck and then they started shit talking me as well. they will unblock me on twitter talk a lot of crap and before i can really reply they block me so noone sees me bust them in the reply.   But what i really got to hate them for is when I see dozens not just a few but DOZENS of little kids who play this game they are between ages of 11 and 15 and they are huge fans of evolve and other teams and trying to stunt and ill see the screen shots where these little kids who are trying to take part in something all the older kids are doing are doing nothing wrong and ill see some of these evolve members threaten them and say they will destroy them, their rep and their channel they say we have the subs to do it.   That is why I attack evolve. because they cant touch me. they cant do the stunts I do, im 21 and have a real life to me this is just fucking around so they cant harm me or hurt me in anyway so im not afraid to come at them.   There fake as it comes. thats why they are working together to upvote every other comment and downvoting mine or anyone else that says something they dont like. they dont want to have comments on here that are gonna say mario was clearly trolling you guys are dumb or anything they dont want my exposed photos being seen. thats nothing some poeple are commenting and then asking me if i see their comment and i will and ill go to reply to it and when i hit send it says that comment was deleted. they are even deleting comments on this thread now. they take a troll and lie about it to make themselves look good then try to hide the proof of their lie."

Its these guys pretending I was trying to get in down voting my comment that shows the proof cause they cant just delete it cause then ill laugh at them for hiding the proof so all they can do is downvote it while at the same time upvote everything else to make sure my post is at the bottom hoping noone scrolls down far enough to see the proof. You dont know what pathetic is. they tried to lie about me because they cant handle the truth then when i shared the proof that they are lying they try to hide it.

Since he has such a bad reputation he tried to join Evolve under a fake name, then he was going to challenge himself to take the title of #1 jet stunter (No body is #1 in stunting, he's delusional) and put his channel 'on the line' but his plans failed because he didn't hide his IP address.

I cant tell you who the other guy who commented is as he hasnt said anything to me on skype about himself commenting so I am clueless for now.  You find it strange that randoms come and decide to defend me which if they are interested isnt hard to believe because some people who go around on threads like to be detectives and when they see the OP thread and then see i posted photo proof they know that the OP is lying and might decided to speak up. but .... The stupid community is very big in this game it has thousands of stunters but it comes down more to hundreds of members who are actually recognized. and all of us are on skype with each other talking all the time. everyone tho hates these evolve guys because how much they lie and try to talk down to everyone. they never leave anyone alone because they see other teams and other stunters and feel threatened they think this is their teritory and they need all the attention for it so they go around to other teams channel others stunters just talking shit trying to put their videos down. there one member fishy who is also in the team with OP called shred i have been given countless screen shots of him threatening all these little kids who play the game saying he will destroy them that he has the subs to do it. they are grown men who bully kids. thats why they are so hated.  You constantly will hear them say things like mario tried so hard to get in because we rejected him and every team kicked him out.  here is me https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TojQ24Ddu_w I never tried to join evolve. I was first in a team called VA who was hosted by one of their members name nightmare. evolve leader JB BARZ then bugged the shit out of me all day one day to leave VA and join them I remember telling the VA team all about it.https://mobile.twitter.com/Mario4LYF3/status/614181152430125056 this is a chat with me and nightmare he is a member of evolve now and was the leader of VA at the time it happened. He bugged me about it but I told him no that i wouldnt join his team. ever since then they have been embarrassed about it becasue nobody ever says no to them. they cant find a pilot stunter to compete with me so they dont like that I was playing for other teams. ever since then they have tried and tried so hard to create this illusion that I wanted to with them but they rejected me because they dont like people knowing that they are the ones who actaully wanted me but I was the one who said no to them. They cant stand that so they go this far to even make a reddit thread to lie about it. clogged is right look at my comments and look at others. they downvotes everything i posted with the photo proof and upvoted everything else because they are trying to push my comments that prove this thread is a lie to the bottom hoping noone scrolls down far enough. the stunting community is huge and everyone is sitting around laughing about this troll and wishing it went down and they all know all the truth already and are just sitting here watching how hard these guys are trying to lie. while they lie I just keep posting evidence. funny how they try to argue proof. oh and btw I was never kicked from any of the teams i see he wrote that somewhere VA shut down when too many members left and then I was in cryptic but ask any of the members besides the leader who is pissed at me for leaving ask any of the other members they will tell you I was never kicked I left and then they all begged me to come back and even the leader after he shit talked me for leaving told another member that i could come back i have that screen shot somewhere https://mobile.twitter.com/Mario4LYF3/status/614188236764790785 heres a cryptic member confirming i was never kicked and left.  If you feel that you are a detective then enjoy looking at all the proof that everything I say is completely true proving that these guys just sit around trying to make up everything they can as long as it will make me seem bad. they try so hard to make me look bad but i always prove myself while they just make themselves so bad. cause all everyone sees is how threatened they are by me that a 24k sub team will devote this much to try and spread lies about 1 person.  this stunt made everyone see how threatened evolve is by me when a full team goes so hard to try and lie about a single stunter. this stunt made evolve lie over and over about me while i posted photo proof of everything showing everyone that evolve lies like crazy and tries hard to make people look bad. evovles rep and this guys rep took a huge tole from this because now everyone else in the stunting community is calling them posers who lie. I got almost 400 new subs in 24 hours because how fucking funny it was to act so good to be some one new my channel isnt on the line my rep isnt either I talk to everyone in the community and the pilot community except evolve and shred lol idc about the poeple everyone else hates. i dont care about my channel either I pklay this game for fun not to be so serious thats why i can fuck around and do trolls. but my channel is doing great. and i dont even focus on it

quityourbullshit,3as8tk,moremysterious,59,Tue Jun 23 02:27:43 2015 UTC,"My main point of contention with this story is: in an unmarried-parent, no-name-on-birth-certificate kind of situation, the state would have ordered a paternity test the instant she sued him for child support, especially in a situation like this where the father is insistent on his paternity and the mother is in denial. Upon legal (and very voluntary) establishment of paternity, his name would have been put on the birth certificates by the state. In fact, there is a form that he could have signed in the hospital that voluntarily establishes paternity that she would have had to fight and disprove in court.  While I don't argue that women may have the upper-hand (unfairly) in situations like this, this particular story is utter bullshit, as others have said. She CAN'T just shrug her shoulders and say she doesn't know who the dad is only to then turn around and say ""Oh, State of <blank>, sue this guy over here for child support because I said so!"" It doesn't work that way! States have to establish paternity before ordering child support for unmarried couples or there has to be voluntary declaration of such by the father. If it was that easy to get around, women would just blame any Tom, Dick and Harry for child support."
quityourbullshit,3as8tk,ChasinJason,-6,Tue Jun 23 16:17:25 2015 UTC,"Well... the mother CAN make it difficult for him to sign the affidavit of parentage because it's voluntary on both of their parts. She can say no, and the hospital will respect her choice. The state will only get involved if she's receiving state benefits (WIC, Medicaid, etc). I'm not saying I entirely believe this story, but unmarried fathers do face an uphill battle when the mother is uncooperative."

quityourbullshit,3as8tk,WillyTheWackyWizard,102,Tue Jun 23 17:35:43 2015 UTC,"TL;DR - Custody doesn't work like that  First thing's first. OP is right about women having the power when it comes to custody. It makes total sense that the man has to prove the kid is his, but the mother does not. This is because, well, there are plenty of eyewitnesses who saw the baby in question removed from the woman. Since stealing a baby and cramming it up your whoo-ha isn't a thing, this is considered 100% proof of maternity. The exceptions being if she gave birth at home with nobody to help because she sneezed real hard or something (which I sincerely hope does not happen).   But because of this (and other reasons), most of the time the mothers are granted custody. It is due to sexism (both toward males and females) and people just seeing women as maternal caretakers and dads as sort of satellite figures who provide money and food. This is, obviously, a fucked up thing. While there are fantastic mothers and shit fathers, there are opposite cases of shit mothers and fantastic fathers.   TL;DR so far: OP is right, women tend to have an easier time getting custody.  THIS IS WHY THIS POST SCREAMS BULLSHIT.   See, there would be no point for lawyers to try tricks to swing the custody the mother's way. It isn't necessary because chances are, she'd be given all the rights anyway because she is a woman. It isn't in the law that way (I think?) but it is just how it works out.   Here's a real example. My cousin's ex-boyfriend tried to get his and her daughter taken from her. In this situation, my cousin is a delightful mother and the dad is a piece of shit. While he lied out of his ass, he did bring up a few sticky points: she had recently checked herself into a hospital for suicide watch, her then-husband had a pending child-endangerment charge (for his kids, not hers). The suicide-watch thing was an easy thing to bat away since she had made the decision to check herself in and it turned out to be due to her new medication. But the charge was another thing.   First, her and I (because she's not very good tech-wise and I am) gathered up every shred of evidence we had to disprove all the bullshit (for example, his mom was saying he's a great father, but there were texts with her telling my cousin he shouldn't be let around kids, etc.). Then we worried over the pending charge.   Her lawyer then said that she shouldn't worry. She's the mother, and the law leans in her favor. Plus, he hasn't been in her life (by his own will). In the end, the judge pretty much laughed them out of court and my cousin retained full custody of her daughter.   Please keep in mind that laws vary state-to-state. My mom and cousin (not the same one in the story above) both work in child support, but in Nebraska. So I am only familiar with Nebraska's laws, not any other state.   Second, her refusing to allow him visitation that has been granted by the courts is completely illegal. The authorities wouldn't just 'do nothing'. They would intervene. Would she be arrested? Probably not. But she would be forced to comply or then face jail time. If these people were refusing to act when she was breaking the agreement, he would be fully within his rights to get a new judge, to bring up charges or even sue.   Thirdly, child support is determined by a few factors, not least of which are: how much it takes to support the child and how much the father makes and is able to afford. Yes, it is a lot of money to pay, but it wouldn't be enough for her to buy a new house and car because, you know, kids still need to be taken care of. A scumbag mother might squander all the money on herself, but he doesn't mention she is in any way neglectful toward the children. Also, she has her own lawyer/court fees to pay. With custody battles, unless one party is being sued and that is in the agreement, both parties have to pay their respected fees."

It took me seven months for her to show up to the third trial (she never showed up in the first two) where the judge basically told her to give him back to me or go to jail.  She did give him back and now respects the court order (weekend visitations etc). I guess the judge made an impression on her.  She still owes me about 52000 euro's for all those days she didn't return my son, but I'm never going to see that money.  Just sharing my experience in this."
quityourbullshit,3as8tk,roltrap,2,Tue Jun 23 13:25:19 2015 UTC,I'm glad things worked out for you buddy. Well wishes from the U.S.
quityourbullshit,3as8tk,Acquiescenttyler,6,Tue Jun 23 16:47:49 2015 UTC,"Second, her refusing to allow him visitation that has been granted by the courts is completely illegal. The authorities wouldn't just 'do nothing'. They would intervene. Would she be arrested? Probably not. But she would be forced to comply or then face jail time. If these people were refusing to act when she was breaking the agreement, he would be fully within his rights to get a new judge, to bring up charges or even sue.   Half right. I've been in this situation before. The police will ask her to give up the kids and try to enforce the order, but they will not extend that to pressing charges or arrest. I was told its a civil matter and I'd need to deal with it in court. The court conciliator actually sided with the mother saying there must be a reason she didn't want to give the kids up. Now luckily no custody was changed (or reduced) but to think the courts will take action for a mother not following a court order is not entirely true. I'm sure if you can show repeated attempts over months/years it'd be a different story.  On the other side of the coin I've seen a situation where a mother called the father in for kidnapping. He legally was allowed to have the kid (was within the custody order's time, even though she had primary). They treated him like a criminal, surrounded the car, brought the child out by gun point (because of an amber alert I think), and after it was determined he wasn't doing anything illegal (by the court order), he was released (after the kid was returned to the mother of course). The kicker is nothing negative happened to the mother for filing a fake police report. I can't say it didn't hurt her custody in court later though, I honestly don't know what happened after that."
quityourbullshit,3as8tk,bateller,2,Tue Jun 23 18:28:25 2015 UTC,"I felt absolutely horrible for this guy at first and I usually don't fall for crap like this because reddit has made me pretty cynical. I even left a comment to him letting him know how terrible I felt for him.   I actually thought about this off and on over the past day or so and the more I did, the more things didn't just add up.   The sheriff doing absolutely nothing, for instance. I just don't believe that a woman (or anyone for that matter) who continues to defy court ordered visitations would just get off Scott free. That the police and court system would basically be like huh, oh well. Sorry dude, we tried. The only case I can see that happening is, and I mentioned this in my comments, if she had friends in high places which isn't unheard of. My sister, and I don't say this because she's my sister because quite frankly I can't really stand her, is a wonderful mother. However, she lost custody of her boys to her ex because his father was a mayor and his family was very well connected.   And while it's still more favorable for women to get custody, it's not unheard of for a man to get it. Believe me or, but I have a guy friend who got custody of his two kids. Two kids that biology are not his. He'd raised the girl as his own since she was 3 and he was with the mother when the boy was born and he was put on the birth certificate.   The more replies I got to my comment to this guy, the more I could see this seemed trolly and very the red pill-ish.  Edit: okay... Every reply to me, even the ones that weren't him, have been deleted. Maybe he had multiple accounts or something."

quityourbullshit,3as8tk,MySafewordIsCacao,4,Tue Jun 23 17:48:47 2015 UTC,"It's a very long story and it really depends on who you ask. There are crazy vocal minorities in every group and I think they get the most ""press"".  US feminism basically is defined in three waves.   Wave one was the late 19th and early 20th century. This is the classic suffrage movement most are familiar with.   Wave two started in the 1960s and through the 90s. This is the very radical group that came to be during the rise of the Vietnam War, civial rights and major times of public upheaval. The dominant issues were reproductive rights and getting the Equal Rights Amendment passed. This is when the idea that bras and other feminine trappings, like pageants, were bad. The general ideas of radical feminism developed during this time.  Third wave is the current iteration of the movement. This is the stuff you hear about women taking back their sexuality. Being feminine is no longer bad, women can do what they want without shame such as porn or wearing heels, it is not identified as male oppression as other waves saw it. It has move away from the ""us vs them"" mentality of the earlier waves. What the concern is now is that the hetronormative gender definitions hold back both males and females. For women to truly be equal the ideas of both gender's roles have to reevaluated. Men are not always the breadwinner for the family. Women are not all maternal and better suited to child care.  There are those that see third wave as a backslide and still argue the past waves stances. That is where most of the arguments come from, I believe. It's basically like any radical group, but the word gets demonized without understanding behind the differences."

quityourbullshit,3an54d,DankAxeFoam,150,Sat Jul 4 18:39:43 2015 UTC,"I may be playing the devil's advocate here, but this actually seems like a legit scenario. He shot a rifle at a range and asked for a picture for brag rights. The owner maybe got this in an email and doesn't really wanna fold out the gun or whatever you do with a gun, figures it doesn't matter if it's his guns aslong as it's the same model.  Benefit of the doubt aside, he does seem to be a little bit too angry."
quityourbullshit,3an54d,smittywjmj,78,Sun Jun 21 23:21:52 2015 UTC,"Gun owner here.  It's possible, but I don't think it's very likely. First off, he would probably have to know someone with an M82/M200 already, and OP would probably know about it. You don't just go to a range and borrow the gun of the guy next to you, they have to offer it to you. It's range etiquette. And no one's going to offer up their $5000+ long-range anti-materiel rifle or its expensive ammo. I also don't know of any range that would rent an M82 or M200, although it's not impossible, but then OP's friend would not have a picture of them laying on some guy's kitchen floor.  On the other hand, say he does know someone who let him shoot their guns and OP just doesn't know about them. You might have a point with not wanting to drag his rifles (especially those large, heavy rifles) out of the safe/closet/hole-in-the-ground/wherever just to take a picture. Then again, borrowing several thousands of dollars of your friend's guns would probably be something of an event and OP's friend would likely have brought a camera along to take pictures of him with the guns. But then again, maybe neither OP's friend nor his rich friend own a camera."
quityourbullshit,3an54d,shpadoinkle92,14,Sun Jun 21 23:57:04 2015 UTC,"Don't want to speak for all gun owners or anything, but I know I have pictures of most of my guns on my phone from range days and posts online, especially the ones I'm particularly proud of. If I owned a freaking m200 I would absolutely have pictures to show off to anyone vaguely interested in guns. I would be so obnoxious about it. You'd have to bug me not to send you pictures of it."
quityourbullshit,3an54d,smittywjmj,7,Mon Jun 22 02:02:07 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, but if it's not your gun, I was thinking that you might want a picture of you with the gun. I mean, you can go Google all the pictures of M200s you could want, but a picture of yourself with it would help you remember that one time you shot it.  ...but that's just what I think would be more likely."
quityourbullshit,3an54d,shpadoinkle92,3,Mon Jun 22 02:50:29 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, definitely. I know the one time I shot a full auto Uzi I definitely made sure someone took a picture. Gotta get some action shots if you're handling something particularly cool. Every time I take new shooters out they always want to get pictures or video of them with my AR or whatever. I'm just saying that even if for whatever reason the guy didn't get a pic of him with the guns, I doubt the owner would just grab something off google images."

So he says he has a friend with both saying he got to sight them in brand new and  said he had taken a picture of them before he put them away.  Now just to clear a couple comments up this isn't the first time he had done something like this before he is a chronic one-upper I just decided to call him out on it this time and the response was funny.

A competent snake owner knows at a glance if their snake is shedding. This one is what you'd call ""blue"" because of the hue they take on while in this state. You don't need to take them out and stress them to ""check on them"" - you should be able to peek at them in their enclosure to see what they look like, you can tell immediately if they're in blue.  If this person didn't know their snake was shedding, there is no excuse but being inadequately educated about keeping snakes - it's something very regular and is just as important as knowing how to feed or house them. The bullshit is that she's passing it off as ""I didn't know what was going on"" - which is marginally worse than actually being stupid enough to not know basic snake-keeping."

That's why I'm dismissive of that statement - nowhere else has she expanded on the situation.  Like it says in the picture - either she's a liar, or doesn't know basic snake husbandry. I feel there's more evidence of Option A, trusting that she's a competent snake owner who - if she's as responsible as a snake owner should be - would know what a shed looks like and what it means for the snake. You believe option B, where there is a possible backstory that the snake owner posted to another venue to ask if her snake was sick, before she posted a romantic little post about her shedding snake being ""dependent"" on her and ""being sad"".  If this was so irrefutably non-bullshit, I'm sure this post would have crumbled by now. I respect your interpretation and understand it, but I have to respectfully disagree.

quityourbullshit,3akvxu,radialomens,6,Sun Jun 21 15:29:12 2015 UTC,Not 24/7. The point is that you can't assume weather or surrounding objects (there could be something shading the roof such as another piece of the building or a tree) Just because you see sunlight doesn't mean it's scorching hot outside and just because it looks overcast doesn't mean it's the dead of winter either.
quityourbullshit,3akvxu,radialomens,0,Sun Jun 21 16:36:30 2015 UTC,No... there is a middle ground between below freezing and hot. There is a lot of middle ground. Like if it's 50 degrees F and overcast.

I don't know where you've lived, but where I live the photo could easily be winter.  I don't think the snakes are legit, but the argument you're trying to make is weird as fuck."
quityourbullshit,3akvxu,Kilo353511,8,Sun Jun 21 16:12:02 2015 UTC,Not to mention that most snakes don't move like that in the first place; unless they're travelling through forest or rocks a snake won't waste time with that back-and-forth zigzagging motion. They can travel in relatively straight lines just fine.

It doesn't really work though.  It took about two days for birds to figure it out. I've seen birds perched on top of the owls.

A dude posts his standup comedy routine, which IMO is pretty bad and judging by the downvotes other people felt the same. He did this either because a: he's an unsuccessful standup comedian (or his audience just has a very different sense of humour to reddit) and he wanted to show off or b: he's not a standup comedian and made a lie up about being one OR c: he made the comment on purpose to be bad so he could get upvotes on his next post and he just did a shitty job of covering his tracks. I mean at least use an alt account or something.   He then defends himself by saying that REDDIT has fucked up and attributed his username to a comment he didn't make. Understandably noone believes him.   Then he posts to yet another sub, once again with the same account, is found out again unsurprisingly, and then pulls the ""lol guys it was my brother"" excuse which seems like a 5th grader's go-to backtrack when he sent a message to the girl he likes only to get turned down and then say ""Oh I don't like her anyway, my brother did that"". One of the oldest and least believable excuses out there.   Your username is long and your account isn't a throwaway so at least I can be sure this isn't OP trying to reap yet more karma.   This is by far the most thinking I've ever had to do on this sub..."

Right or wrong, here's how I see it: I saw his post in /r/comedycemetery and only clicked on his name because I was curious about the awful stand-up ""comedy"" and hoped to find more.  It was immediately apparent that it was his own post.  I clicked back one page on his history and saw that he claimed his friends were encouraging him to get into stand-up, but he wasn't sure.  After I called him on it he told me and another user that Reddit must be fucking up.  After a lot of people doubted this, he posted on /r/oopsdidntmeanto calling himself out.  It worked like a charm, because they ate it up in that sub.  Seeing that, he posted the equally awful ""stand-up"" about his brother and then promoted the lamest subs ever that he happens to be a moderator of.  tl/dr:  he may have turned it into a positive (and more power to him for that), but it wasn't his intention all along."

He basically refuses to mention who it is he represents, almost demands to speak a lawyer of the owner of stopstealingphotos.com, and is essentially just threatening them with a ""cease your actions or we will serve you"" ultimatum. If they really were serious about a lawsuit, why wouldn't they just serve the owner of that website? Seems like a scare tactic to me."
quityourbullshit,3afwf8,Iamdarb,39,Fri Jun 19 20:55:03 2015 UTC,"That is what it sounds like. Empty threats at best. If this lawyer had a leg to stand on, he would have had paperwork served."

Defendants are being contacted before the lawyer even knows what he is going to do?  -And of course the silly speech on the evils of the defendants without actually listing any real legal violations (not a single case/law/court ruling reference anywhere).

quityourbullshit,3ac9jd,_potaTARDIS_,19,Fri Jun 19 04:34:29 2015 UTC,"I don't really see those reddit posts as any different than ""found footage"" style movies. Sure it's contrived if you think about it for more than 3 seconds, but it's a fun storytelling medium that lends an air of immediacy and, potentially, draws you into the story in a way that circumvents the fourth wall.  Unless you're a cynic who would rather quest for truth than enjoy a decent story. Sure, we all know that The Blair Witch Project wasn't real. But it was pretty fun to believe it was, for the duration of the movie at least."
quityourbullshit,3ac9jd,Dizmn,5,Fri Jun 19 15:12:38 2015 UTC,"Unless you're a cynic who would rather quest for truth than enjoy a decent story. Sure, we all know that The Blair Witch Project wasn't real. But it was pretty fun to believe it was, for the duration of the movie at least.   Poor excuse for lying (I don't really see why one would be defending lying in the first place). We 'all know that The Blair Witch Project wasn't real', but much of the time there is no immediate way to determine whether the story you are reading on reddit is truth or complete fabrication.   You end up at the point where a thread that is supposed to be asking for real answers ends with a fiction overtaking all the truth because the truth simply cannot compete; you end up at a the point where sophistry and downright nonsense like 'Reddit, I think a nuclear coverup is afoot' or 'I have proof that Monsanto has engineered their own race of bees' hits the top of /r/all and spawns a wave of hysteria; you end up at the point where the FBI launches a criminal investigation over nothing.  The sheer mass of lying on this site is precisely why there are so many 'cynics' who won't believe any story that is even slightly incredulous without mountains of proof."
quityourbullshit,3ac9jd,SyndicateSamantharoo,9,Fri Jun 19 04:23:35 2015 UTC,"The found footage trope is as old as the hills, like the novel that starts with ""This is a true story..."", but unless you're still at the age where you believe in Santa Claus, you nonetheless understand it's a work of fiction. Lying on anonymous internet forums, however, especially about poignant or tragic stuff, like cancer, war or abuse, is mainly attention seeking with a tinge of vandalism. There's a reason AMA seeks verification. It's why calling out fakes and frauds on their bullshit is such a righteous activity. It's not about defining truth, just about having a decent respect for truth-telling per se."

quityourbullshit,3ac9jd,Protuhj,35,Fri Jun 19 17:47:43 2015 UTC,"People (in cultures where social media pervades everyday life) are being raised to ""want attention"".     Think about it: If you were born in the 2000s, you've grown up around social media. People talk about their Facebook/Twitter/Instagram followers as a measure of popularity. No longer is your measure of popularity limited to your podunk school, it has become global.    You see the 'popular' people in your school posting mundane garbage on their social medias, and get hundreds of likes, so you decide to post something ""interesting"" in hopes of getting attention.    When most of us were growing up if you weren't popular at school, it didn't matter for the most part as soon as you left school. Nowadays, you have to deal with popularity at school AND when you go home and check your accounts and see the same people popping up in all of your circles of friends.      I'm glad I didn't grow up with that crap."

And so we're bombarded with the truly extraordinary. The best of the best. The worst of the worst. The greatest physical feats. The funniest jokes. The most upsetting news. The scariest threats. Non-stop.  So people want to ""brag"" about their achievements or w/e so they can have ""attention"", thus feeding their ego."

quityourbullshit,3ac9jd,nogodsorkings1,2,Fri Jun 19 03:57:37 2015 UTC,"You say that, but studies of social media consumption suggest that people are strongly affected by relative attention and status, a basic human trait that is amplified by the information saturation and filtering mechanisms of current social networks.

I felt conflicted because on the one hand, it was like a scrapbook of my tween years that I was erasing, and in the distant future I may want to look back on those memories. But on the other hand, I did some embarrassing shit that I never want to see the light of day.  I have no idea what I'm going to do in the future when my someday kids enter the realm of social media.

quityourbullshit,3a9geo,prettyslattern,14,Thu Jun 18 18:12:46 2015 UTC,"Its a vicious cycle. If she had friends, she wouldn't do things like this, and if she didn't do things like this, she'd have friends.  I've been on both sides of that relationship.

quityourbullshit,3a9geo,Podruzny,3,Thu Jun 18 21:19:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no shit. I think that if she saw an easy way of escaping from her situation, she would. She's like, what, 13, 14 years old? I don't think she realizes that acting like this is the reason for her predicament. Or that she's even in one. When I was in her shoes, I didn't know why I was different or why the other kids didn't like me. Things just sucked and that's the way they were. There wasn't some sort of obvious cause and effect going on, it was just a big mystery to me. And events like the one in this thread aren't born out of logic or sound reason. They're born out of desperation. I wasn't thinking right in those days, and I doubt she is either. So ending the cycle isn't as simple as just breaking the cycle. There's a bit more at play than that."

They lie so much that they can't keep their lies straight and end up telling the same lie multiple times with way different details.

Chariz  Most stores will not buy or touch a card over 5 bucks unless it's proofed. This is mainly due to an influx of counterfeit magic cards back in the 90s and has gotten worst over the years.  Black lotus is one of the most expensive cards in the world.  Unminted is about 400 to 500. These could be counterfeit.  Mint 7 to 9 goes to 10k to 30k. Not counterfeit.  I have never seen a mint 10 in years being sold.  Edit correction: mint 10 100k to 125k.  Not minted but mint original. Char is 49 buck.   A mint 9.5 hologram char is about 5k to 6k range.  So if ether way I believe some BS was called and his whole story is just a lie.

quityourbullshit,3a8cr8,parzx,26,Thu Jun 18 12:15:02 2015 UTC,"Well, this is exactly ""collecting antiques""... so yeah."
quityourbullshit,3a8cr8,MonkeyDisco,5,Thu Jun 18 12:21:06 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much collecting antiques. I mean, you can get more use out of a Black Lotus than you can out of a really old painting because you can actually use it in a Vintage M:tG deck in addition to letting it dust in your collection.  I don't know why you would ever play a real one, considering the fact that every time you shuffled it you could lose several thousand dollars worth of value by bending it ever-so-slightly, but that's still more card games than you could play with the painting.  EDIT: Though this does remind me of the time I saw a Vintage M:tG game played in real life. Seeing all the cards I've heard about online just felt so weird. Seeing people actually play a real-life $1200 Mox Saphire to ramp into a turn 1 $900 Time Walk, only to be shot down by the $100 Force of Will (cast turn 0, naturally) made me realize why I'm not getting into any Magic format older than Modern."
quityourbullshit,3a8cr8,Regorek,-4,Thu Jun 18 23:00:05 2015 UTC,"Yea the thing is that if it's a good painting by a famous artist, it's value will only appreciate. There's a large market for art and so it's value will always hold. What if people decide one day that they don't want to play Magic anymore and it loses all popularity? The cards will become worthless to all but maybe a couple of super hardcore, super rich former Magic players"
quityourbullshit,3a8cr8,parzx,2,Fri Jun 19 02:14:24 2015 UTC,"The people who buy and sell antiques don't deal with these ""what ifs"" because they don't affect the market in the real world. The reason the painting's value will only appreciate is because there's a limited number of them in existence and people have yet to simultaneously decide that all paintings are stupid. Similarly, Black Lotus will only evaluate because there's a limited number of them in existence and people still play Vintage Magic for some strange reason.  The likelihood of a huge number of people who would otherwise be playing Vintage Magic (who are already only the super-hardcore, wealthy players, as most people are playing other formats) suddenly playing some other game is very tiny, so tiny that the magic community seems to be more worried about people buying too many cards in the market and driving prices up."
quityourbullshit,3a8cr8,Regorek,0,Fri Jun 19 02:32:53 2015 UTC,The world is just as likely to suddenly decide that Picasso was a hack as to suddenly decide they don't want to play Magic anymore.
quityourbullshit,3a8cr8,CuvisTheConqueror,-4,Fri Jun 19 13:46:07 2015 UTC,"I sincerely doubt that a card game will outlast art. It doesn't have to be Picasso. Humans have been painting for around 40,000 years and sculpting for a long time as well. Magic has been around since 1993. Slight difference between the two I think you'd find"
quityourbullshit,3a8cr8,parzx,4,Fri Jun 19 13:55:28 2015 UTC,"I love that you're comparing a specific game against the entirety of art, rather than a specific artist or a specific artistic movement.  If you want to compare apples to apples, the general concept of card games dates back to seventh century China."
quityourbullshit,3a8cr8,CuvisTheConqueror,-1,Fri Jun 19 13:57:28 2015 UTC,I'm comparing a specific game against the entirety of art because that was the whole point of my argument.

That had nothing to do with the general concept of card games

There are plenty of sales of $5+ cards sold to vendors without being graded.

quityourbullshit,3a8cr8,mirrth,0,Sun Jun 21 23:29:47 2015 UTC,"Right, but how does that relate to coins?"
quityourbullshit,3a8cr8,GetHisWallet,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:24:27 2015 UTC,"An irreplaceable object, like an old coin which can never be minted again (think Roman coin or Spanish dubloon) intrinsically holds high value. If there are only three left, there can never be more. This means the coins command a high price.  Pokémon cards can be printed by the manufacturer, since they are still in business. But the manufacturer chooses not to, in order to create value.   This is seen by some to be a lesser form of collecting. Look at Coca-Cola limited edition cans. They are only valuable because Coca-Cola decided to only print a few hundred of them. They could have printed forty eight million, but decided not to. The Roman coin doesnt have a manufactured rareness, it just is rare."
quityourbullshit,3a8cr8,GetHisWallet,3,Thu Jun 18 13:32:48 2015 UTC,"The coin's value doesn't come from the plates used to make it - same with the card. You could make exact replicas of the coin, but you couldn't make 1000 year old original coins - just like the company could remake the card, but couldn't remake original printings of it. No matter how exact the reprints, they wouldn't be original."
quityourbullshit,3a8cr8,Penguin--Soldier,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:17:44 2015 UTC,"Except most the most valuable rare coins in the world aren't roman coins; they're US coins. (in case you don't believe me check wikipedia)  the value of a collectible is only based on supply and demand, and rare cards are no more reproducible than coins. the value of a coin is typically based on how many of that type (distinguished by date, mint mark, and occasionally minting errors that briefly went unnoticed and allowed a few defective coins to circulate), but that's also completely arbitrary because any given mint could have produced 100x more of a particular coin than it did. we chose to have some mint produce very few of a certain coin in whatever year,  and people decided later that they wanted to try to collect all of them, so everyone has to compete for the really rare ones. it's exactly the same as cards except one is printed on paper and the other is stamped on metal."
quityourbullshit,3a8cr8,GetHisWallet,3,Mon Jun 22 02:26:08 2015 UTC,"Books would have been a better analog.  A first edition of a book, printed in a certain time.    Yes, that book can be printed again and again and again, however First Editions can still be extraordinarily expensive because they only printed so many (or only so many survived in a specific condition).  Comic books too."

I remember a coworker of mine took a day off of work so he could go to the bank and get quarters... then sit around and look through them.  I think it was the Iowa quarter.  I remember an ear of corn.  Anyway, he shows me (with a magnifying glass) that there's one little line that's not supposed to be there.  It was then considered a misprint or something, and the $0.25 coin was now worth like $1.50 or some shit.  Our conversation went roughly like this when he came back the following day:  ""Wait, so you went to the bank and basically bought money."" ""Yup."" ""And then you sorted the money and sold it."" ""Yup."" ""You bought quarters for a quarter each and then sold them for a dollar?"" ""Yup."" ""You bought money and sold it for more money."" ""Yup."" ""How the fuck does this happen?""

I had a shivan dragon back then and used to be excited that it was worth like $15 or so bucks.  For somebody 14 years old that's good money.  A lotus would have been jackpot even back then when it wasn't worth but a few hundred.  My kid brain would have exploded if I got one.  It would have meant I could get nearly any of the other cards in the game that I wanted.  I remember looking in Scrye magazine every month to see pricing on it.  I bet even most older gamers weren't thinking too far into the future in terms of picturing that card as an investment.

You can find articles and people talking about the big 1996 counterfeit of magic but they are few sites that has these as a reference. Counterfeits has been going on since the game came out but you didn't hear about them unless you read it in a magazine or a store posted about it. This is nothing new and it's not rare ether. The other problem is you know they are fake cards but how do you spot them. Magic has only been around since 1993, Pokémon was released in 2003 in America so it takes time and people figuring it out to spot the fakes.  Edit note and correction: I thought I corrected all of the 03 statements but missed this one. It was officially released in 1999. 03 was when wizards took rights of Pokémon. My mistake."

quityourbullshit,3a8cr8,madchains,7,Thu Jun 18 14:20:46 2015 UTC,"As someone who is currently a highly enfranchised MTG player, and has previously worked in a card shop, I can tell you that right now, the MTG community is dealing with the highest quality fakes it's ever dealt with. That said, they're all still pretty damn obviously fakes to anyone who spends any amount of time looking at or touching magic cards with any regularity. Bad text kerning. Way too glossy of a finish. Too much/too little light shines through. There's dozens of youtube videos that outline the problems the most 'convincing' fakes have.  Shops will purchase 100s of dollars of magic cards off of people without grading, gladly and often, so I'm not sure where you're getting the impression that nobody wants to buy something that's ungraded. Grading is actually super uncommon except in the cases of highly sought after collector's pieces (i.e. Black Lotus, the moxen, etc.) and even then it's almost never done as a verification of authenticity but rather as a proof of quality (in other words, that's why a GM10 Lotus will cost you an additional arm over an 8.9 of the same edition).  Additionally and somewhat unrelated, you linked to the Collector's Edition Lotus. CE cards don't have the Deckmaster/Magic back, and have squared corners similar to Alpha edition cards. Notably, CE cards aren't tournament legal for these reasons. The CE Lotus is $400. An actual Unlimited edition Lotus, the cheapest tournament legal edition, will run you ~$3.5k easily, graded or not."

The reason fakes are cheaper is because they cut corners whether it's lower quality materials, hastily done stiiching/printing or much more relaxed quality assurance.

The Left and Middle Cards are ""Shadowless"", because if you look at the right-hand edge of the Charizard image box, there is no shadow on the red background, like there is in the Right Card.

Just because it's worth several hundred doesn't mean someone's going to pay for it, and I had several rare Charizard cards in particular.  And even selling a lot of good cards together, which were worth probably like $500+, I never got that amount. No one is dumb enough to spend that much (and everyone interested was going to re-sell them). I got them for like $300, and it was only because of the sheer amount of cards I had.

quityourbullshit,3a7cyk,Cleverly_Clearly,115,Wed Jun 17 20:19:27 2015 UTC,Why let site mods edit disqus comments?
quityourbullshit,3a7cyk,XiamenGuy,32,Wed Jun 17 20:43:29 2015 UTC,"Let's say you have a Wordpress site and you activate the Disqus plugin. All comments are put into the WP database, in duplicate. You could effectively disable the plugin, then edit the comment in the WP database, and reinstall Disqus, which will suck any old comments (edited comments) back into the Disqus system. Source: I hack shit all day long and my speciality is finding broken things, like this."
quityourbullshit,3a7cyk,Gurueffect,11,Thu Jun 18 03:08:06 2015 UTC,I'm having trouble following this. Could you give an example of what this would look like?
quityourbullshit,3a7cyk,KimJungWin,11,Thu Jun 18 03:36:23 2015 UTC,Disqus comments are saved.   Mod turns of Disqus.   Mod edits the saved comment.   Mod starts Disqus again.   Disqus loads back comments it previously saved.   Disqus now had the edited comment by the mod.
quityourbullshit,3a7cyk,Fermats_Last_Account,10,Thu Jun 18 07:10:34 2015 UTC,"From my understanding of what he said, the Disqus plugin takes input like comments, and adds it to the WP site  Disable the plugin, and the comments that's already been inputted is still there on the site. You can edit them,since you can edit the whole site and virtually anything about it, like headers, pages, format, text, etc.  Re enable disqus.  Disqus sees the format of the things that were originally comments(now edited) and see they are comments; They're still displayed as comments.  Essentially, disqus will normally handle comments and organize them. But when disabled, the comments are still there with the rest of the website's information. Like any other component of the site, the comment text can be changed. When Disqus comes back, it still sees them as comments and displays them like comments."
quityourbullshit,3a7cyk,ShrimpFood,60,Thu Jun 18 04:05:13 2015 UTC,I hope they reported that mod to someone else at disqus and that they too aren't corrupt assholes.
quityourbullshit,3a7cyk,Bobgoblin1,9,Wed Jun 17 23:59:47 2015 UTC,It can be done on a site-by-site basis. Nothing to do with disqus itself.
quityourbullshit,3a7cyk,MundiMori,22,Thu Jun 18 03:27:07 2015 UTC,"Actually, it has everything to do with Disqus, specifically in how they implement the comment delivery."

You can program a website to do damn near anything with comments, if anything you'd want to make it more obvious that a Mod had edited the comment. The only times I've ever seen mods have the ability to edit comments (before this instance) on any forums the comments gained a very clear ""MODed"" tag.   If mods had the ability to edit anyone's comment it would probably be obvious that a mod had edited."
quityourbullshit,3a7cyk,VladVV,3,Fri Jun 19 11:41:59 2015 UTC,"But if it is in the interests of the owners of the site to be able to censor user content, it's probably more beneficial to be able to censor content silently, isn't it?  Besides, you could argue that on sites where there are is no immediate evidence of cenorship, which would include most mainstream sites on the internet, there could just as well be some form of censorship."
quityourbullshit,3a7cyk,Nishnig_Jones,-2,Fri Jun 19 12:26:56 2015 UTC,"Not really, if you want to silence someone its best to just delete a comment and all replies.

If you have a problem with cashiers doing such a simple task, you should call up 7-11 and try to get the company to fire them all and replace them with vending machines.

To be visible, they would all have to hit just the right angle of the sun, all at the same time, and all be in OP's field of vision, who is 1100 feet below and 1+ mile away.  Stars don't typically fall from the sky in bunches. As far as I know, they're pretty stationary in the night sky. Thus, OP must have only  caught a very brief glimpse of them and quickly looked away, because a bunch of random bright stars in broad daylight all in the same spot (it was a cloudless day) must have looked so unremarkable.  Chinatown is to the northeast of the WTC, so OP surely would have seen the northern face of the tower that was hit, but I guess s/he didn't notice the giant cloud of smoke nor the impact it left on the building. Only the glass shards. Which were bright and stationary enough to be mistaken for a majestic cloud of stars when seen from over a mile away.  But it's okay, he was only a third grader, right?"
quityourbullshit,3a2gic,Atwenfor,27,Tue Jun 16 21:11:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying this happened but I do know when I remember past events I am positive that I mentally change details as time goes on.  This effect is shown in the ""Bugs Bunny Study"" in which people were were shown pictures of Disney Land with Bugs Bunny and then asked if they met Bugs when they went to Disney Land as a kid. one third of the participants then remembered meeting Bugs. This is impossible because Bugs Bunny is not a Disney Character.  This could have happened and over time his memory of the events has changed or maybe it didn't happen at all and somehow he picked up a memory of the event for whatever reason. The fact that he was in third grade makes this even more likely. I mean, I'm sure most of the memories I have from third grade are not that accurate...  tl;dr maybe he wasn't intentionally lying."
quityourbullshit,3a2gic,s2514,2,Wed Jun 17 06:33:57 2015 UTC,"True.  I remember taking a psychology class in college, and literally the exercise to teach us this idea was to ask us all about what we remembered about 9/11.  It was then followed up with an explanation of why this is the type of memory that we are very likely to distort.  Essentially, we really do remember it as the way we tell it, but it's just not what actually happened, we've just reinforced the story so many times over the years (lazy explanation, about to go to bed...).    For instance, I could have sworn I knew the exact time I heard the news, but after re-thinking the experience having gone through the exercise, I realized that it was not possible for me to have watched as the second tower hit on tv, as they didn't let us watch until the first period of class was over, so I must have been watching a replay.  For years though, I thought I watched it in real-time."
quityourbullshit,3a2gic,TheHolySynergy,40,Mon Jun 29 04:06:14 2015 UTC,"I don't know, it's not all that unlikely that he saw twinkling in the distance, coming from the occasional reflection from debris catching sunlight in a particular area. honestly it kind of leads credence to the memory- he probably saw the smoke and whatnot too but what really stuck in his memory is the twinkling and his young brain trying to figure out what would cause that. Memories from a long time ago when someone is young are often like that: remembering particular things that stuck out that he then thought about, but which are trivial in retrospect, and not recalling the rest of what was going on"
quityourbullshit,3a2gic,cxn,28,Wed Jun 17 02:20:42 2015 UTC,"To be honest, you are probably right.  Not long ago, I remember I was driving to work when I saw a car in front of me trying to merge onto a lane where another car, one directly in front of me, was already driving. I was sort of halfway paying attention to them because I was running late for work myself, but I could tell that they are just not going to make it. When they made contact, I saw a burst of confetti explode.  In a few seconds, I realized that those must have been the shards of a rear light bursting into a thousand fragments in complete silence (I had the radio playing, so there was no sound effect to the occurrence). However, I distinctly remember how, for longer than some split second, my mind went ""whoa... confetti.""  I was around 25 at the time.  Your mind's perception of events plays tricks on you here and there, so I guess I might give him the benefit of the doubt. Having said that, perhaps because I was also at school in the NYC during 9/11 and I was just a few years older, or perhaps OP's story is just chock full of gaps, it just does not come off as a legitimate retelling of events. Just my take on it, because seriously, what the heck do I know about what OP saw?"
quityourbullshit,3a2gic,Atwenfor,12,Wed Jun 17 02:48:35 2015 UTC,"More likely, he's remembering what he imagined at the time.   Memory is very plastic and we can be absolutely certain about things we visualized being things we actually saw."

quityourbullshit,3a2gic,ReginaldDwight,43,Wed Jun 17 02:59:34 2015 UTC,"People remember tragic events in different ways, and oftentimes with conflicting memories.  Hell, I distinctly remember watching the first space shuttle explosion January 1986) from the Library of my high school (I was a freshman), and just last year I was back for Homecoming and the same librarian was there (yep, she was very young then). I said to her, ""I remember standing right here, watching the TV as the space shuttle exploded"".  To which she replied, ""That would have been impossible, we didn't have cable in the library at that time, the only ""live"" TV in the school was in the teacher's lounge.  We lived in a small town too far away to get any broadcast TV so it would have HAD to be on cable, so I didn't see it AT ALL. Yet even after being told with certainty that I did not see it.. I still remember seeing it.  She did say that several teacher's aids ""ran from the teacher's lounge to the classrooms"" with ""regular updates"" (small school, only about 40 classrooms). It's also possible that I watched the TV thru the open teacher's lounge door during my lunch hour. But I distinctly remember standing in front of the TV in the library...."
quityourbullshit,3a2gic,tn_notahick,12,Tue Jun 16 21:54:36 2015 UTC,"In my college psychology class we discussed this exact subject. When people undergo a trauma such as 9/11, often times they mis-remember or completely make up new memories. Example, there was a man in NYC at the time of the attacks that swears to this day that he was in Yankee stadium, watching a game while the planes were hitting the buildings. No amount of contradicting proof can convince him otherwise. He is absolutely convinced his memory is correct. It was a traumatic event for him, as well as countless others across the country and the world. Yes, people may make things up to make themselves sound more important, but at the same time, a child would be more likely to simply mis-remember or exaggerate the events in his/her mind. It's no crime. But it's more than likely the truth to him/her."
quityourbullshit,3a2gic,mgulley08,8,Wed Jun 17 03:14:12 2015 UTC,"I've read a few different things on how people were interviewed within days (maybe even hours?) following finding out about the attacks and then again after a few weeks/months/years and how the memories changed over time. It was really interesting and made me doubt my own memories of that day. At the same time, it made me feel better about certain things I didn't remember. Like, at some point in high school I was talking with somebody and they mentioned having a fire drill before we found out about the attacks, but I can't recall that at all. The day didn't become unique until they told us (and even then my memory of that is oddly disjointed, like I was watching from the ceiling for parts)."

I remember watching a broadcast on tv when the first plane hit and the anchors were guessing that it was a suicidal pilot of a small plane. I don't remember what time it was. I would have guessed it was around 8:30ish, though, because I was late for first period and waiting at home for my friend to pick me up for class. I actually thought I'd have an exciting story for last period American History. It wasn't until second period that we knew what was going on. So, I guess that time discrepancy means I'm talking out of my ass because I didn't realize that in my shuffle to hurry out the door to class that the ""small plane hitting the WTC"" was actually a pivotal point in history.

quityourbullshit,3a2gic,gigyas6,2,Wed Jun 17 03:28:43 2015 UTC,"I think he would remember for two reasons:  Flashbulb memories, memories of extremely traumatic moments in time, are often burned into our brains. That's why everyone remembers where they were when they heard about 9/11. I remember watching the aftermath of the first crash at the end of first period history. Then I remember going to American Literature. I didn't see the towers come down live on camera because instead of letting us keep watching, our teacher made us watch the Scarlet Letter movie. 9/11 is one of the only days of high school I actually remember.  And the second reason he would remember is that most people have had the ""where were you"" conversation a hundred times, especially if you're from NYC. You'd know if the towers were standing or not at lunch time.  And if you're from NYC, and were at least school-age when the attacks happened, I'd expect you to know the time course of events as just a matter of course. But on that point I could be over estimating other people's interest in recent history. My other points still stand, though."

Once you see skyscrapers on fire in Manhattan your world changes, and that memory would be with him the rest of his life. I have no doubt he would remember what was happening, who he was with, what time it was, etc. Also, like I say, we've all had the ""where were you"" conversation a hundred times in the last fourteen years.

quityourbullshit,3a2gic,RompeChocha,2,Wed Jun 17 06:02:49 2015 UTC,"I used to use one called podcaster, but since Windows Phone 8.1 there has been a built in app which is almost identical so I use that instead now just to save having two apps installed for the same thing. However, the built in app seems to crash my whole phone if I don't wait for it to finish 'loading your podcasts' which is a bit annoying. I don't like lots of features I just like to see the podcasts I subscribe to and then a list of episodes to stream or download when I click on one (with the option to auto-download x number of new episodes), nice and simple. (Looks like Podcaster isn't working any more anyway)  I think I just used to use the itunes app when I was on iOS to subscribe and download stuff then the music app to play them."

She chose a random victim's name and proceeded to make up a fictional romance between her and a man she'd never met. Because she yo-yo'ed back and forth as to whether this man was her fiance or her husband, she lied more, doubled down and shamelessly told people that she was being permitted to posthumously marry him. His family have no idea who she is.   She also claimed Welles Crowther who died in the collapse saved her life and brought her to safety. His family invited her to speak at his memorial service. The memorial was televised and, as was usually the case with more widely televised appearances, she was unable to speak because she was so ""panicked"" and a friend spoke for her. She's truly awful or maybe just very mentally ill. Or both. But it's a pretty fascinating story. Here's a quick article if you're not up for the documentary."

Principal got on the intercom, told all teachers to keep their TVs off so we wouldn't see the coverage (I guess bc they would think it was too disturbing). I am still angry with them to this day about that. As a huge history fan, I wish I could have experienced it live as so many others did (however morbid that might seem). The biggest event in my lifetime was broadcast live on television and I couldn't watch.  When I got home I watched CNN until I went to bed."

The channel cut to some breaking news, and we saw the second tower get hit before the teacher turned the TV cart around and muted the audio.

I told my mom ""Look another plane hit the tower""  She told me it was just a replay. She then came back into the living room and realized what had happened.  At school the teachers were noticeably different. All the TVs  were on. A lot of kids didn't show up. When the towers collapsed the teachers turned off the TVs. They probably didn't want to scare us. Some parents came in and took kids home. We joked that it was dumb because what terrorist would attack a random elementary school like 40 miles from chicago."

She was taking attendance in gym and all we were doing was sitting down in the gym. One of the parents who used to help out during lunchtime came in and he said my dad was here to pick me up. So he walked me into the main building and saw my brother in the lobby, already packed. We were the first of the students in the school to leave. My dad had just signed us out and we were gonna be on our way home. My brother who was in fifth grade said two planes crashed into a building and I laughed, saying that it was impossible. Planes can't do that!  My dad tried to pick up two of my cousins from their schools too. We were only able to pick up one. Her sister didn't have my dad as an emergency contact listed for some reason, so my other brother picked her up as soon as he could.  We got home, and my dad left the TV on. We were flipping channel to channel. I was hysterical. My mom worked in Brooklyn and I thought I would never see her again (second grade logic).  My dad was installing a cable box in the living room earlier that day after he dropped us off at school. He said he thought the first time he saw the WTC they were doing like a small news segment or documentary about the bombing that happened in '93. Then he flipped the channel, WTC again. And he flipped again - WTC. It was on every channel. He watched for a few minutes. He came to pick us up after the south tower fell."

quityourbullshit,3a2gic,TWK128,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:33:53 2015 UTC,That's because they're attempting to create real ones.   Exact times of events can also be elements within actual memories as well.   Poor liars believe that exact times are one of the most important parts and so try to anchor their fabrications to something immutable and undeniable like a point in time.
quityourbullshit,3a2gic,stencilizer,6,Tue Jun 16 20:37:40 2015 UTC,"I mean, you can remember the actual time of events, but the need to specify times is more common by liars, when not asked to describe the time and place of the occurrence (12pm, music class). The fabricated memory sticks to a certain timeline, that could help the liar follow each occurrence in said memory.   Also, you can notice the inconsistency of the story beyond the lying about the time and place of events - he claims he saw people running around with black faces. Other than the fact that the dust was grey, at that point of the day, Lower Manhattan was on lockdown and probably, Chinatown was engulfed in that dust cloud. Exploding planes and crashing towers, would make such a noise that no 3rd grader would stay nonchalant to the level of thinking they see stars mid-day (can't see stars because of pollution at night - both wrong and a lie. A 3rd grader tries to reason seeing stars mid-day ""knowing"" pollution would make that impossible? top kek). I doubt that any school in NYC and NJ that day was still open hours after the first plane crashed. Fucking music class when hell broke loose on earth, goddamit.    Anyway, I'm not an expert.

I was looking out the window and saw all these stars (which was weird because of light pollution) and I distinctly remember it was 8:30, because my mom came in my room and asked me if I knew what time it was (which was weird because she only ever asks that during the day), and I said 9:00?  and she said NO, 8:30!  At this point I knew something was up.  I instinctively turned back to the towers in time to see the third plane miss, and it ended up landing in our family's land, but everyone was dead."

My mom, as head of the PTA (I was in 7th grade) had me sit & read in the office while she called every parent... 360 kids in the school, I think. We got out at maybe 5 pm, and we took all the ""uptown kids"" with us because their parents were in the Bronx and couldn't enter Manhattan. We tried really hard to get a cab but no one would take us out of the neighborhood (upper east side, we lived in Washington heights). We finally got a bus and it took about 3 hours. On a normal day it would have been 1 hour. The 11th was a Tuesday. We didn't get the New York Times the next day, and schools didn't open back up til the following Monday.  That whole week, we all just kept calling it ""Tuesday."" We didn't know there was going to be a name for it.  Also, what third grader walks home from school without a guardian in this city?!"

The reason I remember the time so clearly was because I was hanging out killing time before my 10am class (sophomore in college) and saw people standing around a TV in the student union. It was probably around 9:15 or 9:30, because they were cutting back and forth between footage of the second plane hitting and live coverage of the towers burning. But if I had been 8 and hadn't had that clear time marker in my head, I don't think my recall would have been as clear."

A friend passed along an image to me that was supposedly a tornado that touched down in our town. So I shared it because I was adamant that the storm couldn't have been hail alone. My local news even sent me a Facebook message asking about the legitimacy of the photo. It was at that point I had serious doubts and told him I didn't take it. I felt pretty stupid. It was never confirmed as a photo actually taken on the date, and I have since come to the belief that it was definitely not taken that day. So I'm here admitting my own bullshit."

She also had more pictures of this model and captioned them like ""just at the beach having fun"". For a while I assumed she was just role-playing or something. She also talked to people on that site, lying about how she was pregnant and expecting a baby and dating some made up, extremely attractive guy. I felt bad for the girl. After a while I could tell she wasn't role-playing and was instead just lying to people online about herself and creating this imaginary character. In reality she had little to no friends. I guess making up a new persona for themselves fulfills their wants in life.

There have been several research studies affirming this, while some just calling it a bunch of BS. What you choose to believe is up to you."

We don't know how long it took to take effect or how long he was out for. He never explicitly says how soon it was between getting injected and falling asleep or how long it lasted. We are left to infer it from the context but we can not be sure.  EDIT: actually, come to think of it the duration would have to be about a minimum of 5 hours to qualify and that is bullshit. Unless he also claims the paramedics kept him sedated after the incident."
quityourbullshit,39veuh,finite_turtles,3,Fri Jun 19 12:15:42 2015 UTC,"Either he is the worst ever at context cues in his descriptions,  or he's done well enough to make a rough guess.  After that they take my wallet,  I don't remember much else as they knocked me out with a needle...   This suggests that the chronological order stops suddenly until the next period, when he's waking up...in the morning, except he was unconscious until that afternoon or something.    The mention of the woman being arrested later while the 2 men were caught is a very weird way of saying they were caught a few days later and not within the immediate period of time.    You can't be sure about anything unless we have notated timelines.  However, you also can't be blind to specifics peppering the story.    He's wearing a coat and the movie ended and he states ""sometime after dark"" which suggests it began while still daylight, otherwise this is an odd context to use that description in.   So if he's wearing a coat one can assume that the time is likely between 6pm-7pm at the latest,  because of sunset time in non summer is pretty early and unless he was watching some 4 hour run of some movie about the mating habits of seals.

When I was under general anesthetic last time it took me about 24 hours to be completely back to normal, I was awake but not really ""with it"" and my vision still seemed off for a long time.  But what I'm doing is deliberately chosing interpretations and situations that could possibly make the time frames match up.

quityourbullshit,39veuh,rfopsh,42,Mon Jun 15 11:56:34 2015 UTC,"What junkies do is not under the same statistic as needles pricks. We're talking subcutaneous usually, and pricks differ in two ways, they're not intravenous nor are they injecting tainted blood from the needle into themselves. The exposure with a prick is incidental and indirect while injection is direct and a primary exposure.    On top of this, needle junkies rarely do this just once, so you have multiple instances direct exposure to the most viable vector, blood to blood."
quityourbullshit,39veuh,robeph,0,Mon Jun 15 14:00:34 2015 UTC,"OP never said he was just pricked by the needle. If you read it dude alludes to having been injected with something that knocked him out, not just pricked and at no point does he say anything about being diagnosed the following day."
quityourbullshit,39veuh,pbjandahighfive,10,Mon Jun 15 22:37:36 2015 UTC,"The whole story reeks.   There's so much wrong with it.   His date called the cops,  yet he remained there until the afternoon of the next day unconscious, even though apparently the sun woke up him,  he decided to remain for another 4 or 5 hours.  How is it the cops found the two men after the date called the cops but not him?   I'd say okay, maybe he meant they found them later,  but he dismisses this possible out for his story by noting that the woman was caught later,  after trying to rape a teenager  apparently.      That said,  this is not TV.   During my time as an EMT if I was deft enough to stab someone with a needle and hit a vein during a struggle,  or even just a moving ambulance,  in one swift go, I'd likely have my photo hung over the wall at the station.     Furthermore,  the onset time of most anesthetics that would last as long as he is suggesting,  intramuscularly injection,  unless this needle jabbing junkie robber was a secret ninja, is more than 30m.  You wouldn't get hit and just fall over as he suggests,  even IV would take a bit more than the few moments he's suggesting,  and dosing becomes sketchy,  I mean sure you could hit him with enough to knock him out but he'd be dead and you'd have to get it in the artery to have any hope if it being more than a few minutes.   An example with valium,  IV has about 4-6m onset,  IM is 30 minutes.  If it lasted, let's assume his movie was a later one,  around 11-12 getting out,  the anesthetic used lasted at least 7 hours but he remained semi/unconscious for about 5.   This is very likely a benzodiazepine, not much else lasts that long.   But he was up after 12 hours total,  which suggests that the dose was significant enough to keep him under for 12 hours,  but was scrubbed fast enough that he wasn't out for 2 or 3 days (like valium could do at high doses like he is suggesting he had).    Ultimately too much of this is all over the place to believe.   Sorry.    As for my discussion of pricks,  this was because of the statistics he cited,  he wasn't differentiating between pricks and injections."

The difference is your skin is an example of stratified tissue as it has multiple layers. Simple squamous is about the thickness of a detergent bubble. It's thinness is to allow the easy transport of gasses and fluids into the blood stream. This is how HIV will enter.   In the case of PiV sex, both the vagina and penis have thick layers of protective stratified squamous.  It's extremely difficult for the virus to make it into your body.  ."

quityourbullshit,39veuh,Lyco_499,11,Mon Jun 15 14:04:45 2015 UTC,"It's because of ""risk taking behaviour"". IV drug users get HIV and other BBVs (Blood Borne Viruses) from sharing equipment (needles, spoons etc) and if someone uses used equipment once, they are more likely to do so again. Thankfully, the introduction of needle exchanges which provide free and easy access to new, clean equipment has seen a big drop in drug users contracting BBVs. Someone finally got the logic of addicts being incredibly unlikely to spend money, that could go on drugs, on clean needles. Plus, here in the UK, drug treatment agencies do their best to get addicts to have Hepatitis vaccinations (though these only effect certain types of Hepatitis), which are free (likely due to the NHS).  I'm apparently a twoofer, in that I'm a gay guy who used to be an IV drug addict. Thankfully, I never contracted anything but I'm doubly unable to donate blood. During my using days, I knew 3 (heroin addicted) people with BBVs, all with Hepatitis C. One got it from continuously sharing equipment, the other two were a couple but I have no idea how/when they got it. Sadly the female in the couple, died a year ir two ago, likely from complications linked to Hep C."

quityourbullshit,39veuh,chantistar,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:57:36 2015 UTC,well if they have other diseases that can make them more susceptible to hiv. like hep c. which is also transmitted via needles.
quityourbullshit,39veuh,SilentLurker,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:26:38 2015 UTC,"Any number of reasons, I'd imagine, but I'd think the main reason is the continual use of used needles.  We're talking about one needle getting passed back and forth for days.  Junkies don't just stick themselves with a used needle one time and immediately have it.  Their conditions are a little bit worse than that.  If the .3% is correct, and a static (meaning that each additional use adds an extra .3% and doesn't exponentially raise it), if a junkie shoots up with the same dirty needle 5 times in a day, that would be a 1.5% chance.  Say the needle is used for a week (7 days), that is 10.5% assuming they only used 5 times a day.  This is just flat, QnD math.  I don't think this is anywhere close to correct, it's just a step in the direction.  I'd think it would probably be an exponential raise with additional exposures, plus the junkie doing the infecting might still be using the same needle too, or they might use it more or less than the 5 times a day that I used for example.  There are other factors, such as thinned blood and lowered immune system from the intravenous use of the drugs.  Maybe they don't use the same needle every time, but maybe they share needles constantly.  TL;DR - Repetitive use, as in they don't stop at one exposure."
quityourbullshit,39veuh,binkpits,3,Mon Jun 15 11:59:12 2015 UTC,"That a not how cumulative percentages work. If you have a 10% chance if something and you do it 10 times in a row you aren't guaranteed it will happen. The probability of it happening once is 1-(the probability that it hasn't happened at all). So 1-(0.910) which is about 65%.  In any case, the real answer as to why IV drug users are more likely to contract HIV given the low transmission in medical use is:   more likely to be untreated meaning a higher viral load and thus more infective frequent use as you pointed out direct injection into blood stream compared to a stick into soft tissue hopefully through a glove or even two injection through the needle instead of just the blood on the outside of the needle as happens in a needle stick sexual transmission probably plays a role as well, and concurrent sti's dramatically increase transmission, as does risky sexual behaviour   The other issue which I'm not sure is accounted for is post exposure prophylaxis which medical incidents will receive but IVDU's are not. Idk of the 0.3% is with PEP or not. I'd assume it is."
quityourbullshit,39veuh,SilentLurker,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:35:19 2015 UTC,"I said it was QnD and that i imagine it would exponential and not how I did it.  Mine was purely example, but I did say I felt it was wrong the way I said it.  I figured someone would come along with better facts than me."
quityourbullshit,39veuh,Pixelated_Penguin,0,Mon Jun 15 15:41:09 2015 UTC,"Actually, the main thing is, it's a relative prevalence. Seroconversion happens at a rate of about 3.14 per 100 person-years among IDUs in at least one US study, which is MUCH higher than the general population which is avoiding sticking strange things into their veins and wearing condoms whenever they dip their wick... but still isn't that high.  Which, actually, is the biggest problem with getting people to stop taking risks like this. It's not an imminent, obvious threat. If your chance was 50-50 of getting HIV from re-using needles for a year, people would be a lot less likely to do it... but a lot of IDUs won't even have ever met someone who's gotten HIV from sharing needles."
quityourbullshit,39veuh,One__upper__,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:13:56 2015 UTC,"But there are only so many times a needle can be reused.

quityourbullshit,39veuh,SilentLurker,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:08:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not expert on used needles by any stretch, but even at 5 times, that could be once for the infected, and 4 more times for the re-user.  Then there are also those that are so desperate that they might continue to try even if the needle isn't working well.  As I said though, I'm no expert and this was just speculative QnD math, but at the same time, even if they only use the needle once each, if they share every time and the infected person uses first, the re-user gets exposed every time they use."
quityourbullshit,39veuh,jenesaisquoi,3,Mon Jun 15 12:12:53 2015 UTC,"Based on some research I did a while back about reuse of needles, most can be used safely 4-7 times before the tip degrades enough to injure. Of course, if you're a junkie you might go past that number."

After 100 times, that's pretty significant, and if you needle share with a person(s) with HIV often and you're shooting up many times a day, you could have a very high chance of contracting it within even a year."

Perhaps they cooled the body down with ice to give a more authentic feel, which lowered the immune system, resulting in him being super susceptible to getting HIV from the guys raping him.    Maybe they gave him too much sedative and really roughed him up so the doctors kept him in a medically induced coma for months.

It's currently estimated to be about 1 in 1.5 million.   Still, yeah, most likely it's a lie. It's incredibly rare, and there have only been one or two reported cases of it happening in the past 15 years in the U.S.   (It's a little more likely in other countries with poorer screening procedures, like I know India has had quite a few transfusion-associated infections in the past few years)."

quityourbullshit,39veuh,Byorun,2,Mon Jun 15 20:04:46 2015 UTC,"1 unit of blood doesn't necessarily equal 1 transfusion. Around ~5 million patients in the US receive blood each year.  Like I said, there have only been one or two cases reported to the CDC of people getting HIV from blood transfusions in recent years (in the US). Are there more that we don't know about? Possibly, even probably. It's also complicated by the fact that people who receive lots of blood transfusions (and thus are at higher risk) are often people who are very sick, and thus are more likely to die long before they can develop complications from HIV. If someone contracts HIV from a transfusion, but dies three days later from whatever caused them to need a transfusion, we wouldn't detect it."

Fire in the microwave, kitchen was black with smoke in the upper feet. Had to scrub the residue off the cupboards afterwards- all that crap.   In my case it was a cup of noodles, with some water, which I'd cooked many the same way and never had an issue.   Honestly I think every once and a while some impurity is in the paper of the package, like metal filings, or some heat reactive dye or something.   So yeah, the story sounds dumb but it happened first hand to me so I do believe there are inflammable ramen/cupanoodles out there."

If the person is claiming that they singlehandedly defeated 100 duck sized horses, I'm suspicious.    Also, look for mentions of audience reaction.  Most of the time people aren't going to notice your victory, so they aren't going to applaud or congratulate you.  Then there's stuff that just couldn't happen.

Fat acceptance is about not being a fucking chode to someone because they are fat, not about normalizing obesity as the standard of beauty and health. Likewise HAES is about promoting healthy lifestyles as a goal rather than losing weight. The idea is that people will generally lose weight as a result of making healthy lifestyle choices, but weight loss as the explicit primary goal can frequently lead to some psychologically damaging shit as well as bad health (fad diets anyone?)"

quityourbullshit,39hejy,antsugi,22,Thu Jun 11 23:47:15 2015 UTC,"Or simply the fact that if you really detest fat people that much, why don't you actually act in a way that fixes the problem. No one enjoys being fat. Overeating stems from feeling bad and using food to feel better. The amount of people that get bullied for being fat and turn their shit around versus those that do it from having positive reinforcement and help is like comparing a bucket of sand to a desert. Freedom of speech doesn't mean you literally can say whatever you want without repercussions. Inciting violence or unrest via speech is literally illegal. Also as a business, reddit has the right to remove any of their products or services from their customers. And FPH reached the tipping point when they started posting personal info about the IMGUR staff after they blocked FPH posts. And even within the subreddit if you expressed any type of opinion that wasn't hating fat people you were downvoted to oblivion or met with ""found the fatty"" comments. FPH along with any hateful discriminatory subreddit should be banned. I agree with FPH in the sense that society should do more to promote healthy lifestyles but they cared more about bullying others than trying to effectively bring about a shift in worldwide obesity rates."

It's all documented there.  They'd steal other redditors photos if they were fat and put them in the sidebar and abuse them in the sub and laugh at them if they ask for the photo to be taken down.

The pictures of her with freckles and signs of heavy tanning are a little suspect.  I guess I wouldn't be able to tell either way.  I'd believe mixed race no problem.  This is all such a mess since it ""shouldn't"" matter and her lying just gives everyone reasons to make it matter more."

The bigger deal here is definitely that she almost definitely planted a ton of fake harassing letters in her own mail.

quityourbullshit,39eudz,unprdctbl,35,Thu Jun 11 15:29:01 2015 UTC,No. Many subreddits are set up to have your score hidden from anyone but you for a certain amount of time. That amount of time is chosen by the mods.

Because if it doesn't, then it's still visible to spoil for people before the mods get a chance to delete it."

quityourbullshit,39e5zd,bloweyquinn,6,Thu Jun 11 13:57:11 2015 UTC,"Posted this elsewhere, but I'm going to point it out here, too. The damage done to the drone being handled in the interview couldn't have been done by the shot seen in the video. Bird shot spreads too much to punch such a small hole at that distance.  First, let's take a look at the distance from the drone. Here are shots both from the drone and from behind the guy taking the shot. Given that the drone is clearly well above the peak of the house in the background (which is typically 15-20 feet high), it's safe to assume the drone is at least 30-35 feet in the air.  Assuming the guy is six feet tall, an average height, that would still mean that even if he were directly under the drone, he'd be shooting at a distance of roughly 25 feet. However, he's not directly under it. Judging from the video, he's probably another 30 feet or so from where it landed. Judging the distance is a simple matter of finding the hypotenuse of the triangle. In this case, that would be the square root of 252 + 302, which is about 39 feet.  The only three loads he could be using in that video would be buckshot, bird shot, or a slug. A slug would have completely obliterated the drone, so that's out. Buckshot would also have torn clear through it, leaving several huge exit holes. Bird shot is the only thing he could have shot the drone with to leave that much intact.  Now let's look at the damage to the drone. The hole punched in the drone is extremely small. You can see in the frame of the reporter holding the drone that the hole is smaller than his palm, and that very little damage is done to the rest of the drone. All four rotors are still in tact and have no holes in them, and only one rotor guard is missing, while the rest show minimal damage.  The reason that's important is because at 39 feet, bird shot fired from a hunting shotgun would spread out way too far to punch such a small hole in the drone without also causing heavy damage to the rest of the drone.   Here is how much bird shot spreads at 40 feet. Notice how there is no tiny, concentrated cluster of shot at that distance.  Compare it to the lower right corner of this demonstration, which shows bird shot fired at ten feet. That looks a lot more like the damage caused to the drone.  Bird shot could certainly bring the drone down at that distance due to the force of the shot and damage to electronic components, but it wouldn't blow a small hole in the center while leaving the rest of the drone mostly intact.  Also, as /u/mengman-work points out, the drone in the interview is a cheap $50 toy drone, has no video transmitter ability, has an extremely limited range of a hundred feet or so, and doesn't have enough thrust to be jury-rigged with video transmission equipment."
quityourbullshit,39e5zd,CupcakeValkyrie,3,Sat Jun 13 07:14:19 2015 UTC,"The quadcopter shown is a Syma X5C(-1, possibly) which I own. The range is very small, and there is no way to see what the camera sees. My guess is the person controlling the quad was behind the house somewhere, because otherwise, they wouldn't have control over it.  EDIT: The video also shows the camera being shot, but yet, the camera isn't touched. Also, when the battery dies, the camera footage is corrupted. So I don't know how the hell they got that footage."
quityourbullshit,39e5zd,Coffeechipmunk,5,Mon Jun 15 08:58:33 2015 UTC,"The photoshopped cracks in the image are a dead giveaway, too. When you damage a camera lens, it doesn't just display cracks like that, it deforms the image because of light refraction.  Also, the camera lens on that drone is, what, 10mm across? It wouldn't display so many finely-detailed cracks anyway."

quityourbullshit,39e5zd,betelgeux,-12,Thu Jun 11 19:02:44 2015 UTC,what the hell are you talking about? Have you handled a real life shotgun before?
quityourbullshit,39e5zd,Diluxx,11,Thu Jun 11 19:06:29 2015 UTC,Yes I have.  https://youtu.be/HIQEkxKFky8?t=86 http://www.shootingillustrated.com/articles/2012/1/31/buckshot-basics/  He took a 1 inch chunk out of the center and missed all 4 rotors from 20+ feet with what looks like birdshot. And the path of the shot goes THROUGH the rotor disk. Total bullshit.
quityourbullshit,39e5zd,betelgeux,6,Thu Jun 11 20:58:08 2015 UTC,"Have you?  Let's take a look at some figures, here.  First, let's take a look at the distance from the drone. Here are shots both from the drone and from behind the guy taking the shot. Given that the drone is clearly well above the peak of the house in the background (which is typically 15-20 feet high), it's safe to assume the drone is at least 30-35 feet in the air.  Assuming the guy is six feet tall, an average height, that would still mean that even if he were directly under the drone, he'd be shooting at a distance of roughly 25 feet. However, he's not directly under it. Judging from the video, he's probably another 30 feet or so from where it landed. Judging the distance is a simple matter of finding the hypotenuse of the triangle. In this case, that would be the square root of 252 + 302, which is about 39 feet.  The only three loads he could be using in that video would be buckshot, bird shot, or a slug. A slug would have completely obliterated the drone, so that's out. Buckshot would also have torn clear through it, leaving several huge exit holes. Bird shot is the only thing he could have shot the drone with to leave that much intact.  Now let's look at the damage to the drone. The hole punched in the drone is extremely small. You can see in the frame of the reporter holding the drone that the hole is smaller than his palm, and that very little damage is done to the rest of the drone. All four rotors are still in tact and have no holes in them, and only one rotor guard is missing, while the rest show minimal damage.  The reason that's important is because at 39 feet, bird shot fired from a hunting shotgun would spread out way too far to punch such a small hole in the drone without also causing heavy damage to the rest of the drone.   Don't believe me? Here is how much bird shot spreads at 40 feet. Notice how there is no tiny, concentrated cluster of shot at that distance.  Compare it to the lower right corner of this demonstration, which shows bird shot fired at ten feet. That looks a lot more like the damage caused to the drone.  Bottom Line: Just like /u/betelgeux said, a shotgun firing bird shot would have too much spread to inflict that kind of damage at that distance."

There was some thing semi-recently. TL;DR a youtuber was buying cheap pendants and shit from China, and selling them on Etsy as ""One of a kind pieces"" for way above their value (About 3 bucks to make, selling for over 100 in most cases)  When people started calling her out for it and providing the shops in China where she gets her supposedly ""locally obtained one of a kind pendants"", a lot of her dumb shit fans were like ""IT'S ILLEGAL FOR YOU GUYS TO DO THIS TO HER BECAUSE IT HURTS HER BUSINESS YOU CAN ALL GET SUED IF YOU DON'T STOP"".

Moreover, the panel added, Massachusetts defines ""actual malice"" as ""actual malevolent intent or ill will.""  The implication of these two holdings is that the publication of a truth, with nasty intent, can lead to a large damages award. That's outrageous: Telling the truth can be costly, but it shouldn't be literally so.   Granted, it's just in Massachusetts, but I swear I've heard of other cases where this has happened - publishing 100% truthful statements with the intent to harm a person or business got slapped with a defamation lawsuit and lost."

quityourbullshit,398zlt,phil_katzenberger,17,Wed Jun 10 10:22:23 2015 UTC,I am thinking that English may not be a first language in either case. The intended meaning is decipherable.

quityourbullshit,398zlt,quasiix,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:12:58 2015 UTC,Don't the words 'cease' and 'desist' mean the same thing? In fact... isn't it the same with 'pick and choose'?
quityourbullshit,398zlt,TheFlyingBastard,21,Wed Jun 10 13:07:33 2015 UTC,Cease is to immediately stop the action and desist is to abstain from doing the action again. Just covers all bases.

quityourbullshit,398zlt,mbaines,-2,Wed Jun 10 23:47:20 2015 UTC,"Yes. English does that a lot.  I've read that a lot of it comes from the mix of Anglo-Saxon, Latin, and French that was sloshing around England in the 11th century or so. People got in the habit of using synonyms in case the person they were talking to didn't know all the words.   Can't find a source on that, though, so it might be apocryphal. The closest I can find is this blog post that treats that theory skeptically."
quityourbullshit,398zlt,jaycatt7,3,Wed Jun 10 16:24:44 2015 UTC,"You're really attributing the binomial ""cease and desist"" to 11th century customs? lmao"

I cannot recall the story I heard on the topic recently, but here is a similar story. Basically there is precedent that clothing copying is perfectly legal. However, I believe that while this applies to design, it probably does not apply to art on the clothing. But what do I know? Jon Snow and I know all the same stuff about this."
quityourbullshit,398zlt,mrheh,-8,Wed Jun 10 14:38:05 2015 UTC,DO they still own it when the post it online in a public space like instagram? I don't think they do
quityourbullshit,398zlt,Kl3rik,10,Thu Jun 11 04:33:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, of course they do. Copyright is copyright. That's like saying does an artist stop owning the art if they put it up in a public gallery. Displaying something in public does not cause the forfeiture of copyright."

quityourbullshit,398zlt,Goat_Proteins,3,Wed Jun 10 16:31:40 2015 UTC,"No, not unless somebody gives permission to use it. I believe it's that once somebody creates something, it is automatically copyrighted. Unless somebody gives you express permission it's not ""for free use"" to do whatever with, and even then the original creator still holds the copyright so they can forbid you to do certain things with it, like sell it.   Public domain is only for copyrights that have expired or for things that can't be copyrighted."

quityourbullshit,399t49,myredditfordrinking,21,Wed Jun 10 13:41:19 2015 UTC,"Because on reddit, everyone is male unless you specifically say otherwise. There's no way we could just, you know, not care at all about the gender of a bullshitter because it has absolutely nothing to do at all with their bullshit - being female is far too weird and out of the ordinary for that. /s  (I guess the real reason is something along the lines of ""it's statistically unlikely that a maths prodigy/student is female so it IS weird and out of the ordinary! So we should mention it"". But I think that's still a bad reason, since her being female doesn't have anything to do with the bullshit. Nothing useful is added to the title by including that fact, unless you think the statement ""being female is sooo weird"" is useful. I mean, it's also statistically unlikely for a Stanford/Harvard maths student to be Korean, or from Virginia, but those unrelated facts aren't pointed out in the title...)"
quityourbullshit,399t49,wafflepie,2,Wed Jun 10 15:05:42 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you know this.

quityourbullshit,399t49,wafflepie,3,Sun Jun 14 04:55:27 2015 UTC,"? Given that a person is a maths student in Stanford, it's more likely that they're non-Asian than that they're Asian. Even so, it's not weird that she's Asian and so it didn't need to be stated in the title. Just like how it's not weird that she's female."
quityourbullshit,399t49,wafflepie,0,Sun Jun 14 13:42:00 2015 UTC,"By that logic it's also more likely that a student would be male than female.

Everything isn't a patriarchy."
quityourbullshit,399t49,porphyro,2,Sun Jun 14 14:21:49 2015 UTC,"??? That's the point? Even though it's more likely it's still strange to bother to point it out, since it's an unrelated fact? Like, there are slightly more women in the world than men, but it would be strange to bother to point out whenever someone is a man by calling them ""a male student/teacher/nurse"",  especially when it has nothing to do with the actual story.  Also you do realise that you're the only person bringing up reactionary buzzwords like ""the patriarchy"" and ""misogyny"". We never claimed that this was ""oppression"", or compared it to lack of women's rights or anything! Just saying that it's kind of strange and annoying. When I was at uni it was incredibly irritating to be referred to as ""a female maths student"" for no reason, instead of as ""a maths student"" like the men were."

quityourbullshit,397b4z,iplawguy,2,Wed Jun 10 06:46:23 2015 UTC,Calling Plantiga and Craig pseudo philosophers is pretty incorrect. For one.
quityourbullshit,397b4z,gstorm666,1 point,Wed Jun 10 10:30:59 2015 UTC,I thought he did them the courtesy of calling them real philosophers
quityourbullshit,397b4z,DiamondFiretail,4,Wed Jun 10 15:16:30 2015 UTC,Yesssss I came here to post the same thing. That first response is rich.
quityourbullshit,397b4z,Motafication,20,Wed Jun 10 00:59:56 2015 UTC,"Havent seen the full context, but from what Ive seen it appears the author of the wiki articles was the one who knew what he was talking about. Also, such articles arent merely reviewed but corrected by a broader community. One would have to have a decent understanding of the subject to write or contribute. In my experience, only blowhards in r/philosophy claim that a poster hasnt studied philosophy."
quityourbullshit,397b4z,JamesTBagg,17,Wed Jun 10 00:15:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm with you. Maybe I'm missing something. I get that wikipedia isn't some top level scholarly source of philosophical information, but I wouldnt argue that contributions made to it are completely without merit."
quityourbullshit,397b4z,ccmulligan,7,Wed Jun 10 01:31:02 2015 UTC,"I agree with both of you, and am inclined to side with the OP (despite how verysmart he clearly is), but I also think that he should have stated at the outset that his articles were on Wikipedia. After he's called out, he implies that being a Wikipedia author is a lofty and respected role but he somehow forgot to include that detail in his original post."
quityourbullshit,397b4z,shannondoah,2,Wed Jun 10 05:50:38 2015 UTC,"Maybe he wanted to avoid the bullshit that would go with saying that, ie. this thread."
quityourbullshit,397b4z,CDSEChris,2,Wed Jun 10 09:06:46 2015 UTC,It's the way OP presented himself. Anybody can edit a Wikipedia article but that isn't proof of studying anything in an academic setting or earning any credentials.
quityourbullshit,397b4z,shannondoah,3,Wed Jun 10 05:58:48 2015 UTC,"I feel that the claim from the ""author of hundreds of articles""  is reasonably substantiated  to the extent that his post doesn't qualify as bullshit.  I feel that u/Ibrey and r/quityourbullshit are getting close to crossing the line of cyber-bullying."

quityourbullshit,397b4z,deadcelebrities,12,Wed Jun 10 18:45:02 2015 UTC,"I know i, for one, have NEVER gone to Wikipedia to learn or otherwise familiarize myself with a topic. Who cares if it counts as ""scholarly""? If he didn't know what he was talking about, his contributions would be edited out. This is like someone calling a guy out for contributing to dictionary.com instead of Webster's."
quityourbullshit,397b4z,KRosen333,13,Wed Jun 10 01:18:09 2015 UTC,"No one is disparaging OP for being a Wikipedia editor, as he seems to think. The reason he is at the top of /r/quityourbullshit is that when you assert you have written ""articles"" in response to the charge of not having studied philosophy ""in an academic context"", you are saying that those articles do count as scholarly. The clear implication is that they were presented at academic conferences or published in academic journals and books. In that case, it would make sense to brag about the quantity of your output, since there is some assurance of its quality and originality. Saying ""of course I've studied philosophy in an academic context, in fact I have written hundreds of articles,"" especially when he could have said ""I have a bachelor's degree,"" was puffing himself up with non-existent credentials."
quityourbullshit,397b4z,Neptune9825,2,Wed Jun 10 03:16:17 2015 UTC,"Also,his remarks on Philosophy of Religion in /r/badphilosophy was really hilarious."
quityourbullshit,397b4z,Neptune9825,-1,Wed Jun 10 03:19:14 2015 UTC,I think you're calling him out because you're insecure. How many wikipedia articles have you written? The guy obviously has a devotion to the subject. I think you calling him out here is petty.

quityourbullshit,397b4z,raptorrage,9,Tue Jun 9 23:20:26 2015 UTC,Do you know why he got banned?
quityourbullshit,397b4z,ncrwhale,13,Tue Jun 9 23:24:52 2015 UTC,I assume he was shadowbanned for upvoting his own posts. The thread included at least one comment (now deleted) from an alt account he forgot to log out of.

We turned around and grabbed it, it was in terrible shape. He's sitting there, silently mulling it over while my other friend is in the back seat going ""but dude, you LOVE that laptop!""

They would do their best to make procedures that would keep us from actually helping the legitimate customers out. On the other hand, we did deal with many crooks and con artists. People would use the SS# of their children or family members to get their cable. We had people call us because they disconnected their illegal cable. Some people would get most of their bill wiped clean and then call us because they had to pay for the next month. The worst part was that I was forwarded these calls, and I never supposed to deal with TV or most internet issues. Most of the people I work with were good people. The first and second level/tier people would love to hand their job off to others. It is no wonder that Comcast outsourced these jobs to Brazil, The Philippines, and India.

quityourbullshit,392up7,ju11ce,2637,Mon Jun 8 21:18:37 2015 UTC,She probably rode a bike
quityourbullshit,392up7,Nicholas_Fehn,1588,Mon Jun 8 21:56:44 2015 UTC,"Looks like 15.3 mph average, which is a pretty reasonable biking speed. That sounds pretty likely."
quityourbullshit,392up7,Nomeru,167,Mon Jun 8 23:22:46 2015 UTC,"Just report them, they get removed. Also /r/strava"
quityourbullshit,392up7,matt-s-perrin,35,Tue Jun 9 02:23:45 2015 UTC,"you should just go race instead. Strava's a joke, either people are cheating or people are reporting others for snagging their koms on some morning commute route. My favorites are people who post ""afternoon spin"" and you can clearly tell they hammered their brains out."
quityourbullshit,392up7,zazazello,13,Tue Jun 9 03:18:26 2015 UTC,"like this cheapen my efforts.   Don't think of it this way. Are you doing these times for yourself, or for impressing others?"
quityourbullshit,392up7,Artefact2,19,Tue Jun 9 03:26:02 2015 UTC,"It will automatically suggest a name based on time of day, but it can't reasonable guess that you weren't riding a bike when you had your world record 'run'?"
quityourbullshit,392up7,pconwell,40,Tue Jun 9 08:38:37 2015 UTC,fyi strava automatically names your activities based on time of day. Morning Run is an auto-name
quityourbullshit,392up7,brendax,12,Tue Jun 9 10:11:41 2015 UTC,"That case honestly looks like a mistake. If you select run it will make the title Morning Run, even. I have accidently submitted runs as rides before."

quityourbullshit,392up7,EggheadDash,177,Tue Jun 9 11:58:17 2015 UTC,Left the app running while doing errands.
quityourbullshit,392up7,Chemical_Castration,115,Tue Jun 9 03:44:30 2015 UTC,Probably had to pop into starbucks for a mid run frap.
quityourbullshit,392up7,evbomby,121,Tue Jun 9 04:12:41 2015 UTC,Soundd about right. I sometimes stop by Starbucks for a mid run fap
quityourbullshit,392up7,Abacabadab3,51,Tue Jun 9 04:02:01 2015 UTC,and then into the gas station for a mid run crap.
quityourbullshit,392up7,evbomby,29,Mon Jun 8 23:02:12 2015 UTC,Then into the dungeon for a mid run strap.
quityourbullshit,392up7,analogkid01,37,Tue Jun 9 00:40:22 2015 UTC,now it's time for a post run nap.
quityourbullshit,392up7,evbomby,17,Tue Jun 9 01:56:30 2015 UTC,Oh no! A mid-dream trap!
quityourbullshit,392up7,samueljerri,31,Tue Jun 9 02:23:52 2015 UTC,"I do that all the time.  EDIT: oh, FRAP. I read that wrong. Nevermind..."
quityourbullshit,392up7,killerwin,216,Tue Jun 9 02:44:40 2015 UTC,I'm thinking bad GPS. The distance between the mile markers is way inconsistent. I'd bet her location was bouncing all over the place and it added the noise up instead of smoothing it out.
quityourbullshit,392up7,twerps,46,Tue Jun 9 03:17:23 2015 UTC,"That happened to my boss when he first got into running. He was using his phone's GPS with Endomondo and thought he was running 8 minute miles. I mentioned that I bought a Garmin watch because my phone's GPS would give me inaccurate results, so he checked his the next night. He was so disappointed when he realized he was doing like 10 minute miles instead.  Funny thing is, now 2 years later the guy does 7:30min/mile 5k's like it's nothing."
quityourbullshit,392up7,geoman2k,116,Tue Jun 9 03:19:19 2015 UTC,"7:30min/mile 5k's like it's nothing   That's still a shit pace, though, I mean did you see this girl, she's doing 3:55min/miles."
quityourbullshit,392up7,blorg,104,Tue Jun 9 04:38:26 2015 UTC,"I was thinking this, too. I even wrote a comment about it. But, another possibility is that she is pausing her work out and then running a quarter mile and un-pausing so the app picks her up a quarter mile away and no time has passed. Looking at some of the long straight lines, I bet that's what she did."
quityourbullshit,392up7,DJP2M,42,Tue Jun 9 02:27:15 2015 UTC,"No, it's not that, it's RunKeeper recording inaccurate GPS data. I've had this happen a lot: individual GPS points are scattered all over the place, it doesn't seem to smooth them, and the net result is this.   This happens often enough that normally I check my distance after a minute or so. If it says I've done 0.25 mile at a casual distance pace, I stop it, adjust my phone in its strap, and start again. Pretty sure this girl just hasn't worked that out."
quityourbullshit,392up7,grandmaster_crake,21,Tue Jun 9 01:38:05 2015 UTC,"No way she could even run a sub 60 second 400, let alone several in a row."
quityourbullshit,392up7,lukeilsluke,58,Tue Jun 9 03:47:18 2015 UTC,"I use runkeeper on my phone and it's pretty accurate, so I don't think it's that."
quityourbullshit,392up7,acar87,155,Tue Jun 9 08:35:22 2015 UTC,"Me too, It says I'm running a 5:00 minute mile but I know I'm faster."
quityourbullshit,392up7,rgarrett88,190,Tue Jun 9 02:03:26 2015 UTC,"I know for sure that I run 3 minute miles, but my app always says something like 8:05 or some bullshit. I know in my heart I'm running at a 3minute a mile pace though. This technology is just broke."
quityourbullshit,392up7,Terrh,54,Tue Jun 9 05:22:09 2015 UTC,"well, when I run 8 minute miles my heart sure feels like it's a 3 minute mile so I believe you."
quityourbullshit,392up7,VisionsOfUranus,16,Tue Jun 9 03:35:02 2015 UTC,"Well, I run 2 minute miles. I'm not trying to brag, I just do it got my own fitness."
quityourbullshit,392up7,SeahawkLover,12,Tue Jun 9 01:44:35 2015 UTC,I know. My app has similar times as her and I know I'm faster.
quityourbullshit,392up7,intellos,67,Tue Jun 9 02:13:12 2015 UTC,"The app being used doesn't matter, it's the accuracy of the phone's gps that's the problem. I've seen phones that will constantly drift 20+ meters, that adds up fast."
quityourbullshit,392up7,wallyhartshorn,23,Tue Jun 9 03:05:49 2015 UTC,"I use Runkeeper, and its GPS accuracy is dependent on the phone, not the app. I switched from an iPhone 4S to an iPhone 6, using the same app, and the distance it reported for my daily walk switched from about 1.35 miles to 1.15 miles. Either the GPS in her phone is poor or she's in an area with plenty of obstructions (e.g. trees) that are affecting the accuracy."
quityourbullshit,392up7,G19Gen3,13,Tue Jun 9 03:29:21 2015 UTC,First thought I had.   Or she has a pit bull hover board.
quityourbullshit,392up7,Jape_aus,14,Tue Jun 9 05:41:40 2015 UTC,"Its says below..  ""Compare your other 2.4 mi times""  I've never used the app but is it possible she photoshopped a 3 on top of the 2?"
quityourbullshit,392up7,Rock_You_HardPlace,20,Tue Jun 9 02:39:04 2015 UTC,I think it says compare your 2-4 mile runs
quityourbullshit,392up7,fuckboystrikesagain,23,Tue Jun 9 02:06:21 2015 UTC,Maybe the entire route is downhill.
quityourbullshit,392up7,redflag45,107,Tue Jun 9 02:57:46 2015 UTC,That'd still be a hard pace to keep even downhill.
quityourbullshit,392up7,profnutbutter,122,Tue Jun 9 01:16:12 2015 UTC,You're assuming she stayed on her feet the whole way down.
quityourbullshit,392up7,redflag45,34,Tue Jun 9 02:43:14 2015 UTC,Thats what I was thinking too. If I'm running downhill at a breakneck speed I'm gonna fall face-first very quickly.
quityourbullshit,392up7,Krono5_8666V8,14,Tue Jun 9 03:11:57 2015 UTC,"Not if you're wearing roller skates... that's still running, right?"

quityourbullshit,392up7,Lampmonster1,57,Tue Jun 9 02:01:03 2015 UTC,"Which would put her at around 11 miles an hour. I'm slow as shit on my rides, but I do better than that."

quityourbullshit,392up7,Shanman150,24,Tue Jun 9 02:47:22 2015 UTC,"I thought 11mph sounded slow as well until I checked a group ride I did this weekend. I normally complete that specific course with an average above 16mph (climbs, ya!), but on this occasion the average worked out to 8.6mph.   We have to remember that a lot of people get on a bicycle, find a really easy gear, then never change out of that gear. It's frustrating at times to cycle along side them since you just want to be constantly riding as fast as your heart will let you but that's how they ride.  The actual math seems to be 15.3mph though, which would put her up there with my usual pace over a longer ride."
quityourbullshit,392up7,profnutbutter,32,Mon Jun 8 22:35:35 2015 UTC,"I did some of the math and it seems like it could have also been in kilometers for some reason.  It'd lead to the relatively speedy time of 6 minute 21 second miles running 2.14 miles, (according to my quick math), which could seem rather fast to the girl, making her feel like the measurement was accurate.  Running a sub-4 minute km would be the equivalent of running a sub 6:40 mile, which of course is very doable with some training."
quityourbullshit,392up7,Shanman150,87,Mon Jun 8 22:56:42 2015 UTC,"Except for the fact that it clearly says ""3.46 mi""."
quityourbullshit,392up7,G19Gen3,26,Tue Jun 9 00:59:50 2015 UTC,"Hence the confusion!  I'm just saying that if it's a bug, then it really makes a lot of sense that she'd believe it's a fast time worthy of putting online, ('cause a 6:21 is definitely respectable), but would look ridiculous to anyone who knows time comparisons."
quityourbullshit,392up7,Jdericson,28,Mon Jun 8 23:53:39 2015 UTC,Run keeper works pretty well I doubt it's a bug.

quityourbullshit,392up7,darnon,20,Tue Jun 9 00:34:49 2015 UTC,Going faster doesn't necessarily mean you'll burn more calories on the trip. Keeping your heart rate up for longer is a big deal.
quityourbullshit,392up7,norrisgirl22,19,Tue Jun 9 00:43:23 2015 UTC,"Well, sorta. Just from a physics perspective, you'd definitely burn more calories from the actual movement if you run faster, but heart rate kinda does play a factor I'm sure..."

quityourbullshit,392up7,Conambo,44,Tue Jun 9 02:25:19 2015 UTC,Yup. My moms is like this. I finally got tired of it when she was posting on FB about how Flemish is her native language. She's from Indiana. Fucking Flemish. I called her out on it and she just doubled down and told me she also speaks fluent German and Dutch. I gave up after that. She can keep her life of lies if thats what makes her happy.

I was never anywhere near the fastest on my team so I never thought my times were that impressive. I'd tell people I broke 5 minutes in the mile and theyd be like ""WAOW"" but the runner always thinks ""yeah well it isn't really that fast, i know a ton of people better than me."" as a runner its just kind of embarrassing that people think you're some great athlete when you always consider yourself average."
quityourbullshit,392up7,Cideleetivy2,25,Tue Jun 9 03:56:46 2015 UTC,"5minute/mile is not average. It's extremely exceptional, and you should be aware of that. Even silver medalists think themselves failures, though there are over 7 billion people on earth worse than them."

I've run 4:49, and I usually just say I've run a sub-5 mile.   Then again- she may be referring to the 1500m.(what is considered the traditional Olympic mile in track) Not the 1600m.  My best time for that is 4:25. An estimate of her time for the 1500m is 4:11... and people tend to go faster in that race because it's the outdoor season.  College women?  College Best: Jenny Barringer - Colorado 3:59.90 (6/7/2009)  *She lost to Gelete Burka, from Ethiopia, who won by .01 seconds. (3:59.89)  women's record for the 1500m is 3:50."

Granted I bet she was riding a bike and is completely lying, but there is a slight chance the app fucked up and she does actually believe she is the fastest runner in the world."

The reason for this is that America lives in a culture of certainty, where being wrong or unsure on anything is seen as a sign of weakness, so you get all kinds of retarded as shit behaviour where nobody backs down from any arguments, everybody has the strongest partisan views on politics and there is absolutely no room for losing face in any situation.  This pretty much explains all of America's problems. Probably. I might not be right you see, because I'm from England."

Just maybe the program is screwing up by losing the GPS location, picking it back up and it thinks she's a block away then it fixes itself and suddenly she's 1.5 blocks away in 1 second.  The program doesn't know ""well it is just a glitch"" and records her running that fast.  However, all of that theory gets blown out of the water later when she says that she has run this numerous other times and when confronted with some information still holds steadfast to the fact that she ran those times."

quityourbullshit,392up7,legotri,61,Tue Jun 9 00:57:31 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily- my running app occasionally will suffer from gps jitter, so your location will bounce around a lot for a few seconds. When this is happening you seem to be covering a lot of distance in almost no time."
quityourbullshit,392up7,irlcake,12,Tue Jun 9 01:18:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it seems the gps in phones are not very precise. I have a route measured out to 10.6 km, but the gps will often say I have run 11.5. Zooming in on the map to see the route and it looks like I run zigzags on the road."
quityourbullshit,392up7,mildcaseofdeath,20,Tue Jun 9 15:02:23 2015 UTC,"This is GPS jitter, she ran about 1.2 miles is my guess and the GPS was just really jittery. It's happened to me before.

quityourbullshit,392up7,bcrabbers,57,Mon Jun 8 22:20:05 2015 UTC,"Might be as simple as the app misreporting the times, and she'd rather listen to the app than somebody who's going out of their way to call her out on the internet."

quityourbullshit,39488v,Zapfaced,3,Sun Jun 14 21:32:16 2015 UTC,"i7+SLI 970s here, absolute max settings (8xMSAA, everything set to max) I get 84fps. At only 2xMSAA I believe I get somewhere around ~120-144, not entirely sure on that.    The 860M only has 2GB of vram and puts out 1.3TFlops. My rig comes close to 7TFlops with 3.5GB of Vram.   I think OP just hit 'optimized defaults' which usually yields 1080p 50-60fps on the lowest settings it needs to do so. Optimized must mean absolute max. And 3 fans plus a near freezing room for $25/month? Why not take everything out of the Alpha case and into a MicroATX case with some fans and a $35 air cooler on the i3 which can't even be overclocked anyway (FSB OC still possible, but silly)."

So actually, I'd say that for what you're spending, the alpha is not a bad deal. It's actually cheaper than I could build it on newegg...  Granted, the GPU in that build is better than the one in the alpha, though I don't know how much. I tried to find the closest one possible."

She has no regard for the truth and is lashing out and hurting anyone or anything that tries to take away her attention. She has quite possibly the most advanced case of Münchhausen's I have ever even heard of, including HAES and SJW.  She said about her own daughter, ""I don't care about your life""."
quityourbullshit,3934ib,TheMightyBarbarian,24,Mon Jun 8 23:11:28 2015 UTC,"Former pathological liar here.  I can say confidently that, while I don't know what all is wrong her at all, it is possible that lying pathologically is her only problem.  In my worst days, I had so many lies moving around that I could barely keep track of them.  When you lie that much, you live in the lie more than reality.  You're nothing without it, it is who you are.  To admit to the lie is basically to slit your own throat.  You're so far in the corner that you don't even think you're in a corner anymore.  You declare it a highly defensible position and you open fire.  You get to lash out at people for not believing you, for not trusting you, despite them having hard evidence.  They should never have even looked for that evidence, and it's them even trying to prove you wrong that's the real offense here.  You take their fucking audacity personally.  You have every right to hate them.  It's very possible that this appearance did a whole lot of good for this woman.  A similar approach was used on me but on a much smaller scale.  Just a level, calm, yet all-encompassing attack on all of my bullshit at once.  I fought it right to the end, though, and walked out with everyone thinking they got nowhere.  I'm not going to kill myself for your entertainment, and fuck you for trying to make me do it.  However, I did walk away with the realization that I can't keep doing that shit.  Except, I needed new people and a new environment to start fresh in.  I still couldn't come clean with those people.  I had to basically separate entirely and start new.  I can't stress enough how much it feels like killing yourself to come clean once you're in that deep.  It's... unthinkable.  Even now as I talk to old friends from those days, I speak about myself back then like it was a different person.  That person never killed himself.  I killed him.  Sorry he was bothering you back then, but don't worry, I took care of him for you.  Let's not even discuss that guy."

quityourbullshit,3934ib,Nzrainmaker,5,Tue Jun 9 02:21:22 2015 UTC,"She isn't ""low"" if she's mentally ill.    If she's mentally ill she believes what she's saying.  She can't control it."
quityourbullshit,3934ib,CarmineFields,-1,Tue Jun 9 03:28:13 2015 UTC,"So people who are mentally ill are exempt from being judged by the same criteria as the rest of us? I am in no way saying mental illness is not a real thing, nor am saying sufferers are in control. This behaviour is low irrespective of the cause."
quityourbullshit,3934ib,Nzrainmaker,7,Tue Jun 9 08:39:05 2015 UTC,Yes.  It's like someone accidentally hitting you while they have a seizure and you demanding they be charged for assault.
quityourbullshit,3934ib,CarmineFields,-2,Tue Jun 9 13:02:25 2015 UTC,"Since when does mental illness cause seizures?   I was thinking more along the lines of someone massacring a group of movie goers and using mental illness as the defence. Yes an extreme example, but gets my point across."
quityourbullshit,3934ib,Nzrainmaker,3,Tue Jun 9 19:17:51 2015 UTC,"Of course mental illness doesn't cause seizures.  I'm saying someone hitting you during a seizure isn't assault because they couldn't control it.  If you live in such a messed up world that voices are telling you to kill moviegoers, you probably can't help it either.    They may need to lock you up for life to keep you from hurting others, but it still isn't your ""fault""."
quityourbullshit,3934ib,CarmineFields,0,Tue Jun 9 19:35:57 2015 UTC,"Right. So the behaviour is still low and I still stand by my original comment. Whether someone blames something intangible like mental illness, under the influence of drugs/alcohol for their behaviour then said behaviour is low.  Mental illness does not justify a behaviour, nor does it make it ok. It simply explains it."
quityourbullshit,3934ib,Nzrainmaker,3,Wed Jun 10 02:03:33 2015 UTC,"Nah it'd be low if she could control it and did it on purpose.   For example you said:   Whether someone blames something intangible like mental illness   Yet she never once seems to believe she has a mental illness. Thus she does not blame it on a mental illness because she believes she has no mental illness.  THUS meaning that this isn't ""low"". This is HER normal.   So yes....mental illnesses do in fact excuse you from being judged by the same criteria; in most cases anyway."

quityourbullshit,38x79r,EvilShallWin,34,Mon Jun 8 02:59:04 2015 UTC,That comic only applies when the person in question is being annoying. Sarcasm and satire don't count.
quityourbullshit,38x79r,UberNarwhalGuy,-19,Sun Jun 7 20:57:21 2015 UTC,"How were the posts sarcastic? And what exactly were they parodying, dumb people online? Yeah, no. Shit posting isn't funny, if you're doing it ""ironically"" then you're part of the problem.  At best, it's closer to being a prank, not a joke."
quityourbullshit,38x79r,amrak_em_evig,7,Sun Jun 7 21:03:25 2015 UTC,who are they paroding? Dumb people online?    Uh… duh?
quityourbullshit,38x79r,Jrook,2,Mon Jun 8 12:20:59 2015 UTC,"Being a prank still makes it a joke though?  They're posts made to elicit reactions out of people/make people laugh at how outlandish they are. If you don't particularly care for stuff like that, you can probably ignore it safely."
quityourbullshit,38x79r,UberNarwhalGuy,-9,Sun Jun 7 21:31:15 2015 UTC,"Way to stifle discussion. That last sentence can be applied to virtually anything, so what's the point of talking?"
quityourbullshit,38x79r,amrak_em_evig,8,Sun Jun 7 21:33:33 2015 UTC,I was specifically trying to avoid this becoming an ongoing discussion because it would've gone nowhere otherwise. There's no point in ridiculing other people's sense of humor because humor isn't something you can argue.
quityourbullshit,38x79r,UberNarwhalGuy,-5,Sun Jun 7 21:38:34 2015 UTC,"You're right. For the record, I didn't dislike these posts, I just don't get the reasoning as to why they're funny.  Being purposely stupid is fine, and works great in most comedy, but with these kind of posts the joke is on the reader, like ""haha can't believe you fell for it when I was straight up lying to you"". It makes the reader the butt of the joke."
quityourbullshit,38x79r,amrak_em_evig,3,Sun Jun 7 21:59:31 2015 UTC,That's the joke. It's like when The Daily Show or Colbert go into an interview with someone who has no idea what is going on. It is to bait a real reaction out of something ridiculous.
quityourbullshit,38x79r,froibo,2,Sun Jun 7 23:32:47 2015 UTC,That's reasonable enough- but usually the funny part stems from how ridiculous the claim was to begin with and not that people ended up believing it. The Tubby Custard Machine post was a good example of it.
quityourbullshit,38x79r,UberNarwhalGuy,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:17:04 2015 UTC,"Well it's funny because some readers are the butt of the joke, and others understand that those readers are getting fooled, and that is funny. People losing it over shitposts on tumblr is hilarious. Misinformation is funny, always has been. If I can get you to believe something absurd then my friends and I can laugh at you and, for a brief moment, forget the brutality of consciousness."

quityourbullshit,38x79r,inEffected,5,Sun Jun 7 20:47:37 2015 UTC,did i ever say tumblr isn't gullible as fuck?  because they are  just that reddit can't exactly claim superiority here

quityourbullshit,38x79r,neverendingninja,0,Mon Jun 8 16:39:34 2015 UTC,"The thing that worries me is about the people behind the scenes. Often on Tumblr you'll see these posts with a huge amount of ""notes"" (Tumblr's version of upvotes). However, click on any of the blogs that made a comment, and often they're accounts that have been deleted or are obviously advertising tumblr bots. It makes me wonder how much of the shit that rises to the top on tumblr is planned out.  The same goes for Reddit's front page."
quityourbullshit,38x79r,jhuynh405,6,Mon Jun 8 03:27:26 2015 UTC,"hah, please. it involves ten million pounds less tinfoil than that  you can change your username on tumblr. people do it routinely. this does not update any old posts, though  this makes it appear as though your account was deleted- unless someone claims your old username, at which point someone who clicks the link to ""your"" account now goes to their blog  and, in the case of people who make comments that go against tumblr's direction of the circlejerk, it's more than likely they'll get at least 5 messages a day telling them they're an idiot for saying that, so they just delete their blog, because frankly, fuck tumblr culture sometimes.  it's a horrific system and i'm amazed they haven't fixed it, but tumblr's web designers are possibly the worst there are out there so y'knowwwww"
quityourbullshit,38x79r,Bobmuffins,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:01:14 2015 UTC,"Well how about the fact that often many of those comments on posts with several notes are often advertising bots? There's also the fact that when you reblog things you can literally delete anything, including people's previous comments.  Of course I'm not saying this happens all the time on reddit or tumble, I'm just wondering how often this happens."
quityourbullshit,38x79r,jhuynh405,-14,Mon Jun 8 08:06:19 2015 UTC,Isn't it funny though how people can believe that those fake posts are real? That speaks volumes to how ridiculous tumblr sometimes is.
quityourbullshit,38x79r,SuperiorAmerican,35,Mon Jun 8 15:05:28 2015 UTC,"No, it speaks volumes to how ridiculous Reddit thinks Tumblr can be.  Reddit's idea of what Tumblr is, and what Tumblr actually is, are wildly different."
quityourbullshit,38x79r,Bobmuffins,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:44:57 2015 UTC,"I know tumblr isn't as crazy as reddit thinks it is, that's true. But I see some of the shit that comes from there and man, it's absolutely crazy. Not all of it, but some of it. It's batshit crazy."
quityourbullshit,38x79r,SuperiorAmerican,25,Mon Jun 8 01:16:02 2015 UTC,"do you want me to start grabbing out-of-context posts from... literally any subreddit and claim they're representative of reddit or no  because if you do that, literally any website ever is full of absurd statements. obviously that isn't true, so why even try to claim it is"
quityourbullshit,38x79r,Bobmuffins,10,Mon Jun 8 01:19:46 2015 UTC,"I mean, the tumblr shit we mock is terrible and worth mocking. So is, for example, /r/theredpill. It might not be fair to say ""tumblr is awful"" but I'll be damned if I stop making fun of the parts that are."

quityourbullshit,38x79r,InterspaceAlien,-3,Mon Jun 8 01:27:13 2015 UTC,"Sure, maybe. But the other ones were true and the fake ones were about as insane as the real ones, and tumblr definitely has a history of saying and thinking some clinically insane shit. That makes it pretty hard to tell."
quityourbullshit,38x79r,SuperiorAmerican,-7,Sun Jun 7 23:50:17 2015 UTC,"Sure, it's shitposting, but they actually believe it."
quityourbullshit,38x79r,MojaveMilkman,11,Sun Jun 7 23:55:27 2015 UTC,"no they don't  that was the entire point of my post  how, exactly, would a dude who openly talks about his fetish for rabbit from winnie the pooh, occasionally posts furry porn, and talks about owning bad dragon dildos not realize that their most iconic dildo is indeed their most iconic dildo  like  trust me dude absolutely no one who posted any of the 3 posts i mentioned believed it. no one."
quityourbullshit,38x79r,Bobmuffins,-2,Mon Jun 8 04:28:33 2015 UTC,"Oh sure, plenty of people know about it, but trust me, the people on Tumblr are both childish and gullible. They'll believe anything that reinforces their extremely narrow world view. The people who originally create some of these are no doubt trolling, but the thousands of notes they get after that? Those people don't know it's trolling. They buy into it. They really thought it was real. And that's the problem.  You're seriously telling me these thousands of people are all just in on the joke?"

quityourbullshit,38x79r,kangaesugi,3,Tue Jun 16 17:41:02 2015 UTC,Someone I used to follow on Tumblr always reblogged that Dominican Republic Mom With Machete post (without the bullshit-calling). Even when I explained that dude it's literally from the trailer of a film she kept reblogging it.  Someone on my Facebook shared that Noble Savage African tribe says nice things to people who do bad things post the other day. I had to stop myself from telling him how crap that post is because frankly I don't like talking to him.
quityourbullshit,38x79r,Trewstuff,3,Mon Jun 8 05:08:02 2015 UTC,"So fun fact about the whole African tribe thing.   About a year ago my sister (who's a med student) went to Africa to do a charity/working exchange thing. Basically they took her to some tiny rural town in the middle of Africa, and had her help out at a clinic for a month or so. She told me the story of one night when a body was brought into the morgue. It was the body of a young man who had been completely burned to a crisp.   Basically this young man had stolen something, bread, a chicken, I can't remember exactly, but by our standards it was completely minor. Anyway, he had been caught, dragged out into the middle of town, and set on fire. Alive.   That's what justice is like in (some parts) of rural Africa. Non of this 'Hugs, spirituality and all is forgiven' bullshit tumblr would like you to believe. Its a brutal place where those who would wrong others (others who have so little to begin with) are dealt with in cruel and horrendous ways."

More likely this type of establishment changes owners cause someone wants to bandwagon on their success rather than fix their demise."

You'll see a few ""Aww...you got me"" remarks and people trying to act like it was all meant in fun, but personally, I've never seen a sincere apology.  People who start a new account just to bullshit will usually delete or just abandon it if caught.  Others, who have a lot of time and karma built up will try to play it off or let their account cool off until people have forgotten about it.  But I'd be interested in seeing a real apology as well.  Especially from the people with fake illnesses or family tragedies, or people who pass off the artwork of others as their own.  That would take courage and integrity, which are usually lacking in these people to begin with."

I was sure I knew what it meant, even though the professor had been leading us in a different particular direction.  I got a B on the essay, with comments alluding to the fact that I didn't understand what the prof. had been hinting at.    I was pissed.  So I tracked down the author's e-mail and summarized my theory about the last passage.  He wrote back a thrilled response saying that it was exactly what he meant, readers like me were a treasure, etc...  I forwarded the e-mail to my lit professor.  When I confronted him about it in class, he actually seemed a little bit pissed, and said that e-mailing the author was cheating (the assignment was already turned in), yada yada postmodernism, yada yada Freud, ergo does the author really know what his own work means, do we really want to know what the author thinks it means?

It shouldn't matter to the artist or anyone else whether or not you ""got it,"" the fact that it elicited a response is good enough.  What we've gotten away from with postmodernism is actually creating work that does have meaning.

I frequented the subreddit very briefly because, like many other people, I simply don't want to have kids. Some people do, and that's good. We need families, we need procreation, and that's great, and if you're a good parent, that's awesome, because more children need good parents. That's just not what I want, and I've been subjected to the same nagging that many others have faced.  That being said, /r/childfree is chock full of people that speak ill of people with children as if they're literally a lower form of life. They use terms like ""breeder"" in a derogatory context to describe people with children, and terms like ""crotch fruit"" and ""crotch goblin"" to describe children. You don't have to hate children to be child free."

You can even hate parents, but you don't have to unfriend everyone who posts the occasional baby photo on Facebook. What has happened to /r/childfree is kind of like what would happen if subscribers to /r/pcmasterrace actually began to think that console gamers should be exterminated.

Obviously there's plenty of legit stories, even if they do sound too good to be true, but people very rarely seem to take anything with a pinch of salt.   Not just on /askreddit either, but it's the reason why subs like /r/relationships, /r/childfree, /r/atheism etc end up being a breeding ground for circlejerking and trolls."

quityourbullshit,38nqer,Coachskau,32,Mon Jun 15 14:45:56 2015 UTC,"Kotaku belongs to Gawker Media, a network of blogs that has been criticized for unethical journalism practices and publishing ""anti-consumer"" articles. The most infamous example is probably this one, which came along with a slew of other ""gamers are dead"" articles from various publications in response to the rise of Gamergate in late August of last year. This all culminated in the creation of /r/KotakuInAction, which has since become reddit's hub for Gamergate activity, looking at journalistic ethics and censorship in general, along with ""gamer culture"" and ""social justice"" related topics.  It's a popular issue at the moment, as many would contest that the allegations have been blown out of proportion, and that gamers are simply upset at having their worldviews criticized and are lashing out at those they deem responsible in the form of trolling, slander, and death threats. See /r/GamerGhazi and /r/AgainstGamergate for some context on that.  Overall, while there are certainly outliers and neutral parties, your opinion on Kotaku will likely depend on whichever side you fall into with Gamergate. If that's something that interests you, I highly encourage you to browse through some of the top posts from all three subs, and form an educated opinion about the issue before jumping to conclusions. But yes, as /u/redditgoogle has pointed out, some people are pretty shitty about it and will get uppity if you try to directly link to any Gawker website, or Polygon for that matter, which is silly. They're pretty big and have created quite a lot of articles, and it's not hard to find some really good, well-researched ones along with the more questionable stuff. I generally believe you should judge each one on its own merits. If in doubt, you can just put an article through archive.org, then nobody really has anything to complain about except the content of the article itself."
quityourbullshit,38nqer,WellThatsJustSilly,28,Fri Jun 5 18:09:18 2015 UTC,"It is also worth noting that people have had beef with Kotaku (and Gawker in general) because they tend to write clickbaity articles with very little actual journalism in them.

More recently their ""native advertising"" has come under fire as well."

The quote “why is there no Korean...” is a translation of a post made on Witcher 3’s Korean Steam page not the Naver message boards. That quote is misattributed.  It's actually a combination of multiple separate comments made by different users. This translation was provided by a Korean Kotaku user for Kotaku. The article you provided never provides the source of where they got these translations (Kotaku). While borrowing heavily from the original Kotaku article they never acknowledge that that is where they’re are getting this info. Your article was posted 2 days after the Kotaku post. In the article you provided there's no links to any of the apologies they're quoting. Kotaku article included many more translations that aren’t censored unlike the article you provided.

quityourbullshit,38nqer,Fermats_Last_Account,0,Sun Jun 7 02:27:30 2015 UTC,Because they posted a handful of articles from The Hated SJW Menace that has led to nearly a year's worth of outraged pearl-clutching since.

quityourbullshit,38nqer,TooSkilled,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:35:25 2015 UTC,"Well, PCMR started off after decades of fighting between the consoles. Eventually PCMR became a meme poking fun at the console-jockeys for all their partisan action. I've never met a PC gamer who was actually down on people who play on consoles, even those who do so exclusively.  They don't actually think themselves superior to console-players - they are making fun of the console players who claim they are better because ""omg XBox so much >PlaySucka!"" ""Na, X-Boner is teh suxxor!""  TL;DR: PCMR is satire, guys."

quityourbullshit,38nqer,TooSkilled,-9,Fri Jun 5 19:01:39 2015 UTC,"I have a PC I built myself. I just fucking hate that people say it's cheaper, when it isn't. Controllers come with the console and everyone has a TV. Even if you buy a TV, whatever. Still cheaper than a PC that will outperform it. I specifically said just Witcher 3 because I knew that even if I said ""not in the long run"" you'd still try to weasel that in. Having a PC is good, you fucking lying, shitty elitists are bad. You people are why everyone hates PC gamers."

quityourbullshit,38pow5,salisburymistake,15,Fri Jun 5 20:02:33 2015 UTC,Some people compulsively lie just to protect their pride. I used to be one of those people who would make shit up just to support their argument.  Happy I kicked that habit.
quityourbullshit,38pow5,xXRandomYoXx,11,Fri Jun 5 20:30:10 2015 UTC,"Wait, are you lying right now about having kicked the habit?"
quityourbullshit,38pow5,damthesehigheels,3,Fri Jun 5 22:07:26 2015 UTC,"No, I honestly kicked it. I used to do the silliest things when I was a kid like make up facts about superheroes to impress my friends. It was probably a way for me to fit in. I stopped doing that kind of thing because I realized that impressing friends with lies isn't really impressive at all."
quityourbullshit,38pow5,xXRandomYoXx,5,Fri Jun 5 22:16:06 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I have a close friend who is a pathological liar, and I don't know what to do about it, and we're in our late 20's.  He makes up the most ridiculous stories almost every single day just to impress people, and gets super defensive whenever you doubt them."
quityourbullshit,38pow5,lasergumball,4,Sat Jun 6 02:06:17 2015 UTC,"Former pathological liar here.  Maybe I can help by relaying the scenario that worked for me.  It takes a huge kick in the ass, and not just about one lie either.  The lies need to be piled up and he needs to get hit with all of them at the same time, in an environment that proves it's not just one man's opinion.  Also, people trying to be ""helpful"" and ""nice"" about it didn't go over well.  It's pretty much gotta be a slam and you can't let him have control of the conversation once the confrontation has begun.  Doesn't need colorful words or anything but you basically have to just hit them with anything you can prove wrong, all at once.  I stress that word because if you can't prove the lie wrong, then he'll walk away from it with nothing but you're all assholes.  He will attack back.  He'll point out shit you lied about, but you have to say something like, ""We can talk about me next if you like, but right now you're avoiding.""  He won't like the answer, but you have to just keep going through it.  He will storm out with you feeling like nothing worked.  He also can't return to the exact same social scenario.  He's ""in too deep"" to totally let go (he's been lying for years and coming clean about everything is irreparable in his mind, the equivalent to killing yourself), so be ready for the possibility that he may not change his act until he has all new friends to start fresh with.  If you're as close a friend as you say, you'll survive the cut, but few will.  Edit: word corrections"
quityourbullshit,38pow5,GetHisWallet,2,Sat Jun 6 13:26:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response, this actually sounds a lot like how he would likely react.  I worry most about how ""deep"" he is.  Every single insane story he's told over the years has been something that make him look like a god.  And they're all ridiculous, like delusions of grandeur.  I have a hard time seeing how he would possibly admit to it all being made up, which it all clearly is.  Every mutual friend of ours is on the same page as me though, and I'll talk to them and see what we can work out."
quityourbullshit,38pow5,lasergumball,2,Sat Jun 6 15:44:54 2015 UTC,I put a bunch of random knives in an old briefcase and told people I was a high profile hitman.  In the 7th grade.

This bias is attributed to a metacognitive inability of the unskilled to recognize their ineptitude. Conversely, highly skilled individuals tend to underestimate their relative competence, erroneously assuming that tasks which are easy for them are also easy for others.

This cop threatens to make up bogus charges of resisting arrest for ""talking back"".  PINAC and other sites have tons of videos of cops claiming you have to ID yourself or that it's illegal to record on public property.  I think it's fucking embarrassing when these sovereign citizen turds throw a tantrum over having to follow actual laws, but there at just as many cases of people following the laws and knowing what they're talking about, and the cops having no clue and making stuff up on the spot.

quityourbullshit,38a6s5,Peaker,3,Fri Jun 5 21:06:28 2015 UTC,"Listen to what your saying...   why should I be aware of what's around me   Are you serious? You're in a car... if the light changes you can miss it, if someone else goes to hit you you are slow to react,  not to mention it's illegal aside from it being dangerous.  Furthermore your closing statement implies that it's the choice of text while driving or text at a stop light which ignores the ""don't text at all while driving"" option."

I was stopped in a traffic light, wasn't I? It isn't more dangerous than a parked car.   ignores the ""don't text at all while driving"" option   Because some texts may be quite important. If I have some emergency to text about, endangering the drivers around me is unacceptable. But delaying traffic in a stoplight for a second (in the less likely case that I don't look up quickly enough) is acceptable. Emergency texts are easily more important than the only downside of potentially delaying traffic by a second."

When my fiance is in the car I give her my phone and she responds to texts, but alone I need help :/  I don't I'm why I'm telling you this on a 4 day old post but I just needed to say it.

Kids will decide to believe in stuff like that on their own without our help, but it's different when we trick them and they find out later. When my daughter is old enough, I won't be giving her an opportunity to doubt everything else I've told her."
quityourbullshit,38a6s5,innocuousremark,9,Wed Jun 3 12:17:17 2015 UTC,"Really? My parents had me believing in Santa, the Easter Bunny, hell, even the Great Pumpkin once came to my door and gave me candy (thanks dad), even after I was so scared by this ghost-looking thing in a sheet that I pushed him backwards into a cactus (sorry dad).   I finally figured it out on my own. Santa brought me a present that was way too big to fit down the chimney. Never stopped me from trusting my parents. Kids are perhaps smarter than you give them credit for, and can figure out the difference between a malicious lie and letting them believe in something magical for a short period of their lives."
quityourbullshit,38a6s5,Eslader,5,Wed Jun 3 15:12:23 2015 UTC,"when I was younger my classmates started talking about how they found out Santa wasn't real. I started having doubts but I wasn't about to skip out on free presents if he was real. So I did an experiment. Every year my parents took me and my siblings to the mall to see ""Santa"". I was't stupid, I knew he wasn't really Santa, but I did think he was an informant of sorts. I don't remember what I asked for, but I remember it was not a Game Cube, which I told my parents I asked for. And sure enough on Christmas morning I walked upstairs to discover a shiny new Game Cube. My suspicions had been confirmed. I humored my parents, pretending I didn't know for a few years until they found out I did. I never told my younger siblings he wasn't real though, I'm not that much of an asshole"

quityourbullshit,38a6s5,Eslader,2,Wed Jun 3 19:53:33 2015 UTC,"I was lucky, having two younger siblings. It's easier to keep getting me a present each year than to explain to them why I wasn't getting a present from Santa anymore"

Later, when talking about video games your friend will say that information as if it's fact because they saw it on their friends feed. The fact that a friend shared it means it must be true.

I'm no expert in anything but I am what you would call ""tech savvy"" and I'm going to give you a real life example.  As a kid my mom claimed that she could ""feel"" the Wi-Fi ""waves"" and that it keeps her from being able to sleep and insisted on unplugging the modem and router at night. On nights where it was unplugged I would plug it back in while she was asleep and ask her about her sleep the next day and magically she would have a good night's sleep. When she thought it was plugged in I would unplug it and like magic she gets a bad nights sleep. Ironically,  if i told her it wad really plugged in on a night where it was ""unplugged"" and she told me she slept well, she would say something like ""oh well it wasn't that good."" To this day she insists this is still true and unplug it at night even though her new apartment has so much noise on the 2.4GHz that the speed of her network degrades by almost half over Wi-Fi.  While this isn't about cancer she also had claims about cancer I knew were bullshit even though I'm not in the medical field for the same reason I knew her Wi-Fi claims were bullshit."
quityourbullshit,38a6s5,s2514,0,Fri Jun 5 15:58:23 2015 UTC,"My point was if your not a scientist in the field, or a doctor reading up on that science regularly. I would not take advice from any of you on the subject. She could be easily as correct in her assumption as you could be, none of you would have any real knowledge on the subject. Even though your thesis is the most plausible.  And even asking a scientist or doctor about this, they would still only be able to give you a theory. There simply haven't been wifi and cell phones for a long enough time to make any real study on it. Cancer can burst out a long time(decades) after being exposed to what caused it.  I'm not trying to arguing in favour of your mom or that cashier, and if I would have to choose sides of opinion I would go with you, just making that clear ;)"

On a more serious note, a drunk crashed his car into a semi-trailer less than a mile from my home (back in the '80s). His car looked pretty much like this 'vette, and he hit the trailer hard enough to crack and dislodge the back axle of the trailer. He was uninjured and walked away from the wreck.

quityourbullshit,382cdw,innocuousremark,3,Mon Jun 1 19:36:14 2015 UTC,"Speaking as a roofer, I can say that a roofer's personal politics come heavily into play when choosing jobs. Three months ago I was offered a job up in the hills. A beautiful house with tons of property. It was a simple reshingling job, but I was told that if it was finished within a day, my price would be doubled. Then I realized whose house it was - Dominick Babyface Bambino. The money was right but the risk was too big. I knew who he was, and based on that, I passed the job on to a friend of mine. And that week, the Foresci family put a hit on Babyface's house. My friend was shot and killed. He wasn't even finished shingling. I'm alive because I knew there were risks involved taking on that particular client. My friend wasn't so lucky. (pauses to reflect) You know, any contractor willing to work on the Death Star knew the risks. If they were killed, it was their own fault. A roofer listens to this... (taps his heart) not his wallet."

quityourbullshit,382cdw,bear_with_hair,24,Mon Jun 1 15:05:53 2015 UTC,"And this is why moderation by voting sucks. Especially when you have up- and down-voting tied to some point/badge/reward system that can actually silence people who post unpopular opinions. It always degenerates into a hivemind circle-jerk.  Facebook's solution also sucks because it ceased to be a ""like"" button a long time ago and is now used only as an acknowledgement that you've seen the message.  If you don't moderate at all, you get a board/sub filled to the brim with illegal porn put there by people who want to sabotage any forum where ideas they don't like are allowed.  If you moderate like a nazi you'll end up with someone eventually corrupting the process and turning the forum into a little ""safe space"" club for the mod aristocracy.  People ruin everything. I'm genuinely curious as to how moderation can be done right."

Reminds me of the old thought experiment: A boy and his father are driving along. The father is driving and the son is in the passenger seat. Suddenly the car is broadsides on the driver side, killing the father on impact and leaving the son in critical condition. EMS arrive and rush the boy to the emergency room, and as soon as he arrives in the OR the nurses call up to the ER and deliver the following message: ""Doctor, your son is in the operating room, and we are in need of your help right away.""  How is this possible?  The answer of course is that the doctor is his mother, but you'd be surprised how many people in real life are perplexed by the question. It doesn't really work as well in text, but I thought the parallels were interesting."

I mean, the customer got a free meal in a privately owned, top notch, expensive restaurant as well as an offered solution which they apparently denied...and they still went off to write an untrue, nasty review that has the potential to hurt revenue. Purely out of malice.  Plus, out of all the insults the owner could have written that one was not all that bad...and certainly not on the same level as the reviewer."

It was also justified as the guys meal was comped, they had tried to fix it but was refused by the customer, and then he still went on and shit talked them for no reason. There was nothing wrong with anything except the chef made a mistake because of the recent menu change. The review was uncalled for and pretty aggressive in tone.

quityourbullshit,38bgsn,MurderIsRelevant,8,Wed Jun 3 03:25:20 2015 UTC,Not only is this not relevant to the sub but a cursory look at Mr Ross's profile exposes him as a complete fraud. The man hasn't written an article in his life.
quityourbullshit,38bgsn,Batyrsik,3,Wed Jun 3 06:48:17 2015 UTC,"Could you provide us with additional information about Terry Ross and his history of fraud? I think everyone would love to fact check his other posts. In a world of media that fails to follow through with legitimate fact checking, people like this man could prove harmful to the truth."
quityourbullshit,38bgsn,nicodiumus,7,Wed Jun 3 06:52:58 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, Terry Ross is a throwaway troll account that's only used on the RT website and page. We can definitely judge he's not an RT journalist by the fact he does not have a single article on RT.com despite claiming to have worked there since 2005. And going by the type of stuff his page consists of, he would have been booted from RT before you could say Jack Robinson. Nobody who likes pages like ""Kill the Putin"" or ""Fuck Russia"" would even make it to an interview with RT.  I obviously can't link his account here but it's pretty easy to find from the article on RT's facebook page. Take a look for yourself. Personally, I think he might be the Terry Ross mentioned in this article, although I could be wrong. That'd certainly explain the frantic attempts to discredit RT."
quityourbullshit,38bgsn,Batyrsik,-4,Wed Jun 3 07:13:50 2015 UTC,That is good information to know. I actually like RT but never assume it or any other media as absolute truth. I just hope the he is not taken serious by MSNBC or FOX.
