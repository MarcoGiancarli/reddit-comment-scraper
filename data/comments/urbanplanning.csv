The Carousel Mall is still slowly aging right in the middle of downtown San Bernardino, with city and county offices as its only tenants, and its vast parking lots serving nobody except city employees and the homeless.  The insult of it is that it's a prime location located right next to the recently-completed sbX BRT, within several blocks of the upcoming downtown San Bernardino Metrolink station and transit hub, and with incredibly easy freeway access. It is literally situated in the best possible spot to start revitalizing the city, but the city is still so far over its head in pension debt that I doubt they have any plans for it, and they've actively stalled redevelopment plans in the past. The mall's current owners even stated they want to do a mixed-use redevelopment when they bought the property in 2006 but nothing's come of it."

I'm not sure who has control of this in San Diego, but I'm willing to bet that the transit agency wanted one and the local DOT either didn't want to grant one or was pressured into not granting one (likely both).  Poor urban design to begin with. According to the article, this corridor already has too many car lanes whether a BRT is running there or not.  Poor land-use integration. Developments along the corridor are subject to the same parking requirements as anywhere else, making (subsidized) driving more attractive compared to BRT."
urbanplanning,3e2hu5,ArcadeNineFire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:01:22 2015 UTC,"The Rapid project, which took a decade to develop, was meant to follow the bus rapid transit, or BRT, model. Initial plans promised a dedicated lane for buses and transit stops with ticketing machines that would speed up the boarding process. Instead, it has a dedicated lane for a short stretch, but shares the road with other cars for most of its route.   It isn't just ""growth"" that follows pavement, in a car-centric society, it is specifically CARS that follow pavement.  This is why the line that light rail is just ""buses for white people"" is bullshit... THIS RIGHT HERE.   Community pushback kept the Rapid 215 from getting its own lane to boost its speed and reliability, including skepticism from the Boulevard Improvement Association itself.  Even if transit improves down the line, he said, the boulevard’s current car culture is affecting its future by impacting new developments as they’re built.    Rail exists to try to help and keep cars out of the way, and out of the path of transit, in addition to providing a fixed modification to the landscape than buyers, sellers, and builders can count on when they chart a path for growth and development.  BRT with ""dedicated lanes"" is never equal to light rail, because those lanes aren't really ""dedicated.""  More like there is a little extra paint splashed down on the otherwise still car-friendly pavement.  It does not change behavior of commuters, residents, other vehicles, or development patterns in the same way."

I have no idea what's up IDTP's ass, but this constant interference and 'thought pieces' always sell the notion of BRT over just an upgraded bus system. The major lobby behind the whole concept of BRT loves to shit all over the normal bus as much (or more) than actual bus-riders.   I know there's political capital in BRT particularly amongst the more active, 'big idea'-crowd that wants to be seen trying something ""new"" and ""innovative"", but at a certain point these high-concept notions always fall flat when the cold, hard engineering and political calculus of the US transport politic comes to bear. The only difference in SD is that this frankenstein got built, which is terrifying in its own right. I'm sure there's some transit planner that pulled their hair out over it.   It'd be a great day when we stop talking about BRT and start just focusing on making a fucking bus network work better and not have to worry about how market it. People aren't stupid, better bus means better bus. I think BRT and all the ridiculous branding bullshit it encompasses actually gets in the way of a small but easy to execute network improvements."

Costs of land acquisition, increased maintenance responsibility, and costs of scaling a BRT service should it reach capacity aren't insignificant, they're only slightly below the capital costs of LRT and can well surpass that mode when wage levels, maint, and other ops costs come to bear. No reason to sell small network upgrades as anything else, BRT is almost impossible to deliver the way it's promised whether as a poor mans trolley or a rich mans bus.

For example, the light rail here in Portland travels at a snails pace from the Lloyd Center east of the river, over the Steel Bridge, through downtown, and all the way to the tunnel where it finally speeds up.  Even though it has a dedicated lane and signal preference in certain areas, it still goes super slow because it's not fully grade separated and there is still a likelihood of hitting pedestrians and cars.    I'd prefer a subway or elevated train."

Therefore improving ground level service will always be beneficial. They will be incredibly beneficial if the pressing need for a subway can be postponed, reduced in scope or eliminated entirely. Light rail in particular provides more than ample capacity for most cities' transit corridors—and can be upgraded to a fully grade separated service selectively."

If you do that in a mixed use neighbourhood it means you'll have multiple shops, an elementary school, multiple parks, rapid transit, and medical offices within a ten minute walk. Essentially, your daily needs are within walking distance and one does not need to own a car.   You need to achieve a density where driving is no longer a necessity and depending on the study/built form/culture/neighbourhood that number is around 5,000-7,500 people/km2.  Certainly you can go more dense, but then you run into the territory of diminishing returns where you either have to build highrises (incredibly expensive) or sacrifice park space. Not to say that highrises can't happen, but for almost all cities they make up such a small part of the urban fabric. Even a place like New York City only has like 8-12% of the population living in a highrise. Concrete is simply too expensive for most neighbourhoods to justify building a highrise.

Useful to consider how density is being measured - if it's being measured as an average across an entire CMA, there can be a wide variety in how a given density is expressed in action. Is it extremely dense in places, and thinner in others, so that people can select from various neighbourhood profiles according to their preference?

But it does have a nice little icon at all the stops where you can transfer to those systems, so if you want to access some place on another system, whether it's a DC streetcar stop on H St or taking Amtrak to Chicago, you find the icon for that system on the diagram, and use that system's own information to plan the rest of your trip. It even treats personal automobiles the same way - stations with parking are shown on the map, but you are on your own getting your car to the station, or getting somewhere else after you get in your car.  The thing is, the DC Metro does have an actual geographic map of its system available at station kiosks, and you'll never guess what it shows: every bus line, commuter rail, streetcar, major road, highway, and Amtrak line within its geographic area.

PATCO is an important part of the regional transit system and that is why it is included in the map. It is differentiated in the legend and also shows that it is not a free transfer from the SEPTA subway.  Likewise, the Purple Line should appear on the DC Metro map, and can be distinguished in similar ways. Show that it's not a free transfer, and include the operator in the legend."

urbanplanning,3dxvb2,Slammin007,-3,Mon Jul 20 21:51:09 2015 UTC,The purple line is not the only light rail in DC. There's a whole DC Streetcar system in downtown/anacostia that doesn't show up on those maps. Just because it goes through the rich white suburbs doesn't make it more important than the H Street/Benning line or some of the other planned lines through downtown.
urbanplanning,3dxvb2,auandi,7,Mon Jul 20 16:14:49 2015 UTC,"Just because it goes through the rich white suburbs   Hold your horses.  A streetcar is not rapid transit, especially a mixed-traffic one, and no more than the regular bus does it belong on a rapid transit map regardless of the racial composition of the neighborhoods it serves. A light rail line, while technologically similar or even identical to a streetcar, has more limited stop-spacing and more dedicated right-of-way enabling it to move faster than a local bus or streetcar."
urbanplanning,3dxvb2,Lol-I-Wear-Hats,2,Mon Jul 20 16:36:44 2015 UTC,"The debate here is that it would not be run by WMATA, but should still be shown on WMATA maps."
urbanplanning,3dxvb2,sensible_human,2,Mon Jul 20 16:20:22 2015 UTC,"I just think either you show all light rail options or show none. Who runs the line shouldn't be the determining factor it should be clarity of the map. If it's a map of DC Metro, and only DC Metro, then don't add anything else. If it's about light and heavy rail, than include the purple line and the DC Streetcars. I would prefer the latter, I just don't see why the purple line should be considered somehow special."
urbanplanning,3dxvb2,auandi,3,Mon Jul 20 16:23:59 2015 UTC,"The Purple Line is different from the streetcars, though. The streetcars (even if you consider the entire planned network and not just the initial H/Benning line) are more akin to a bus in their stops, with a stop every few blocks. The map would be impossible to read if you tried to show every stop on the full (planned) streetcar network overlayed on the Metro map.  The Purple Line, on the other hand, has much more spread out stations, much more like the Metro stations. The stations are also much larger than streetcar stops."
urbanplanning,3dxvb2,voikya,3,Mon Jul 20 18:14:52 2015 UTC,"Well... yeah. But the DC Streetcars don't exist yet, either, and this article isn't debating whether or not they will be included on the map. They almost certainly will. The debate is because of the operator, not the type of vehicle."
urbanplanning,3dxvb2,sensible_human,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:28:32 2015 UTC,"No, it's not a given that they will include the streetcars. Fitting them in would require a rather major redoing of the map to fit the downtown streetcars in. The map as it currently exists simply can't fit it in, so they may keep it just the heavy rail metro not light rail. Just like how San Francisco has a BART map that doesn't include the light rail options."

urbanplanning,3dxvb2,ArcadeNineFire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:24:02 2015 UTC,"This question is brought up in the article.    And if the Purple Line is deserving, what about MetroWay, DC Streetcar, or the multitude of planned BRT lines? Should it show commuter rail, akin to Philadelphia and Boston's transit maps? What makes a service deserving?    I think it boils down to the purpose of the transit mode. Streetcars serve a different purpose than Metro. The latter is more for regional commuting whereas a streetcar is more for local trips. Though both the Purple Line and DC Streetcar can be considered lightrail, I think they serve a different purpose.  The article brings up Boston and Philadelphia, but in the Bay Area, the BART Map shows lines for Amtrak's commuter trains, but not San Jose's light rail system."

But by 2002, business leaders and suburban mayors were recognizing that the segregation of low-income residents in the urban core was holding back the region’s economy. Companies located in the suburbs couldn’t find entry-level service workers, and when they did, those workers would have hours-long commutes through heavy traffic, and would have problems getting to work in inclement weather. The Regional Housing Initiative was founded with the goal of creating more affordable housing for low-income workers in the suburbs.   So this is actually allowing residents to be closer to employment."

It is dangerous and uncomfortable to walk to work over distance in these areas, even when there are paths.  Even before Cash for Clunkers ruined the used car market for millions of low-income families, cars were expensive; once you move into the suburbs most every trip needs to be taken by car or requires despicable amounts of travels time. For a low-income family suburbs (the touted and marketed ideal of freedom and independence) become a prison."
urbanplanning,3dxunt,patron_vectras,2,Tue Jul 21 15:16:24 2015 UTC,"Not every suburb is the same. In Chicago, a lot of suburbs are served by Metra commuter rail, and several of the inner suburbs like Evanston, Skokie, Wilmette, Lincolnwood, Cicero and Oak Park (all of which are majority-white, by the way) are on the 'L' (subway/metro). In some of these places it is hard to even tell you're not in Chicago anymore because the built environment is very similar to the outskirts of Chicago.  To provide another example, my parents live in a 1920s-era inner suburb of Milwaukee (which was served by streetcars until the 1950s and now served by various 15-minute local and express buses).  By all accounts their environment is quintessentially 'American suburban' insofar as they have a detached house with a front lawn and two-car garage. But they also can (and do) walk 2-3 blocks to the grocery store, pharmacy, restaurants and parks. Growing up, my friends and I walked or biked to school, and took the bus downtown.  This may all sound highly unusual if your only mental picture of a suburb is McMansions on cul-de-sacs and strip malls on six-lane roads, but in inner suburbs of older cities in the Midwest and Northeast, you can find plenty of walkable areas with main streets, mixed-use, sidewalks and OK transit. And these are the places that are really good candidates for housing integration programs like the one mentioned in the article."

Many didnt since theft is not a big issue there, and the area is staffed.  Old people tend to work these kind of jobs.  I also find this relevant since cities have parking garages that can be modified to also host bike parking of this kind, and maybe also have more access points with belt assisted stairs like in Urawa, besides the low slope ramp used by cars."

Two hundred years ago London was the largest city in the world at 1,000,000. Now we're talking 100x that.  The longest metros in the world hover around 600km.

urbanplanning,3dvfqh,Husker-Dude,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:18:12 2015 UTC,I find livability drops pretty drastically after the ~2 million mark for a city.   How did you arrive at that number?
urbanplanning,3dvfqh,jigglysquishy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:14:36 2015 UTC,"Just from experience. At that size affordability becomes an issue and I don't know if we can really build our way out of it.  The good neighbourhoods of a city are within walking distance of the core. There's only so many people who can be within a 20-30 minute walk of the core. Once cities get large enough you start relying on large commutes. Not everyone can live within that 3-4 km radius of a downtown.  A city of one million can be more efficient than a city of 500,000. We've always looked at cities at being more efficient as they get larger, but I think diminishing returns start to kick in around that 2,000,000 mark. We need to build more and more transit to serve everyone to the point where it becomes prohibitively expensive. A lot of the main attractions (pro sports, arts, parks) become so busy that they become overrun. Whether Toronto metro has 2,000,000 people or 10,000,000 people there's a fixed amount of Maple Leaf tickets. Even in centres with low/no/negative population growth like Tokyo we still see insane housing prices.  I'd also argue that at those large sizes cities become so busy so as to adversely effect people's stress levels. NYC is crazy busy despite having the best metro system in the Western world. There's no reason to think cities can't have a capacity.  Now, the number isn't set in stone and some communities do it better than others. I find Paris far more livable than a Houston or Atlanta, despite Paris having more people. Built form, appropriate density, and quality metro enable cities to grow larger while still maintaining a high quality of life. But I think cities generally peak in terms of livability in that 1.5-3.5 million person range.   It was only 150 years ago that humanity's first city hit 2,000,000 people. It could very well be that cities simply can't exist at the human scale at populations much larger than that. There's certainly no cities today above say, 5,000,000 that exist well at a human scale."

For one, the surface of a plastic road will deflect far more than asphalt or concrete, making the cars that drive on it far less efficient. Driving on asphalt is supposedly 10-15% less efficient than on concrete due to this effect so I would imagine the material dampening of plastic would be fairly noticeable.  Secondly, the article doesn't address why these would be better for the environment than asphalt. I'm assuming the claim stems from the proposed recovery of plastic from the ocean. However, large-scale recovery of plastic from the ocean is not possible with current technology. If they solve that problem, they can drop the whole prefab road project, clean up the oceans and win a Nobel Prize in the process. Also, it's worth noting that asphalt is a recyclable and renewable resource so it's actually fairly eco-friendly."

Asphalt roads usually have a 40 year lifetime before they need patching or a completely new top layer. That's 40 years of cars and trucks driving, breaking, accelerating, turning as well as temperatures below and well above freezing, occasional water stuck around the road expanding when freezing and creating a substantial pressure on the structure of a road.  Even if plastic roads could come near a 40 year lifetime of this, long before that any unevenness in the surface would be worn away, giving it a perfect slip n slide surface on rainy days."

I agree with him that we should build houses according to ""the best architectural idioms of our time"". But unfortunately our time does not know shit about designing communities and buildings, and the best idioms of our time should therefore be to a large degree to replicate buildings and streets that actually worked. At least until that day that we manage to actually improve on yesterdays standards.  There is an unfounded fear among architects that copying old styles and structures is something bad.

urbanplanning,3dm3xc,uppstoppadElefant,14,Sat Jul 18 18:58:59 2015 UTC,"The video started off well explaining that rising housing costs are actually seen as good by a majority of home-owners, and throwing easy credit/debt at the situation just leads to massive housing inflation.  This is a good point, but the solution isn't ""drain more wetlands so long as the buildings are pretty!"".  Also NIMBY's don't care so much about design as they do the height/density of the building.  Nimby's just don't want change or more people around them.  Working in development/architecture I found people would claim to be against something for other reasons, but when everything is boiled away it always came down to the number of units or the height of the building.  People would rather a cheap ugly 5 story building than a gorgeous 6 story building.  People that say they're against a new condo because it ""won't address affordability"" end up being fine with the project once it's smaller.  Countless times community groups were presented with two choices, say a 100 unit building with a range of affordable and family housing, or a 70 unit building that was shorter and had no family units, no affordable units.  Every single time they choose the later.  They just don't want more people in their neighbourhood.  They have fears about parking, crowds, ""others"" using what they see as their resources and space.  Also this video seems to think we can solve affordability by greenfield development.  We don't need more sprawl.  Sprawl is once again a massive subsidy to home owners.  The infrastructure required to sprawl out on ends up costing more than the taxes the houses they serve generate.  Houses out in the suburbs are artificially cheap due to these subsidies in the form of the infrastructure construction and upkeep.  The video makes some good points about architecture, and obviously nicer buildings is key. But look at the pictures they used.  They showed dense walkable town centres, not sprawl.  It doesn't matter how pretty the buildings you make in your car-centric new suburb, that's not the problem.  What we need to do, in our cities at least (specially in north america) is allow for more organic growth (sorry to use such a tired cliche) in the city's existing land.  The solution isn't plopping a bunch of skyscrapers in the few little ""density ghettos"" the city has decided it will endure them in.  The solution isn't more sprawl of single family homes.  The solution is allowing a natural range of housing styles and densities to grow, providing a fairly even gradient of density from the core out.  In so many cities you have a dense city centre that is extremely expensive, but then you have low density neighbourhoods very close by that are not permitted to become more dense because of zoning and powerful neighbourhood groups.  You don't have to build a bunch of skyscraper condos all over, you just need to allow that neighbourhood of houses to evolve into row-houses and small apartment buildings.  You have to allow that neighbourhood of row-houses and small apartment buildings to evolve into larger buildings, and so on.    The two most affordable models of housing are the skyscraper and the single family home.  Skyscrapers require an enormous amount of structural materials, engineers, elevators, mechanical systems and so on, you can never build enough of them for them to become ""affordable"".  Single family houses require enormous costs in terms of land, highways, and other infrastructure which end up hidden from the price of the home.  The key is the ""missing middle"" of housing densities, which also happens to be the sweet spot for economical construction.    And of course it's icing on the cake if all these new buildings look nice."

Yes, infrastructure costs to provide for dense cities are vastly lower per capita and per square mile. But those costs are typically allocated evenly to rate payers or tax payers, so those savings are appropriated from dense cities and spread around, making it logical to waste some infrastructure. On the other hand, land prices are paid by the person who buys the land and the person who rents it. If policies are very effective (I'm thinking of Copenhagen, Denmark here, though Danish readers may disagree), those prices are relatively low for what people get. If policies are a mess (I'm thinking of Detroit, MI, USA now, sorry Detroit), those prices are higher than people are willing to pay, and we get insurance fires at the low extreme and massive lawns or parking at the high extreme.

urbanplanning,3djjn3,DJWalnut,2,Fri Jul 17 18:27:54 2015 UTC,"I think one very important difference to point out about the development of the Red Wing stadium vs other stadium developments is that the new Red Wings stadium is also developing lots of housing in a time where a rash of building is starting to take place in Brush Park, one of Detroit's most neglected neighborhoods. This helps connect the very ""in demand"" downtown and midtown neighborhoods which increases the vitality of inner city Detroit as a whole. if the new stadium were just another lavish palace surrounded by a sea of parking much like the palace (where the Pistons play), my, and many others opinion would be more than a little critical. But instead of aquariums and swimming pools, this stadium comes with a wide variety of housing for all families regardless of socioeconomic status. here is a rendering of the future stadium and here is where the stadium is being built."

urbanplanning,3dnj8t,beegee_disco,2,Fri Jul 17 18:41:51 2015 UTC,"The Nashville MPO is well-known for being an early adopter of health considerations in planning. From what I understand they extensively integrate health into both land-use and transportation planning.   A social work background could be pretty powerful for you at Nashville given their health focus and your skills. Often we (consultancy) hire interns with special skills for a particular project or area of work, like a type of analysis, a language competency, or a software package. Look into some of what Nashville is doing, and think of how a social work background could help. Although I don't know much in the specifics of either Nashville or social work I would guess that you would be well-positioned to help them with public outreach."
urbanplanning,3dldbv,fakeshits,6,Fri Jul 17 05:17:05 2015 UTC,The idea that people being successful causes problems for others is based on scarcity of property that is not present in Detroit and also to some extent on our skewed economic system that burdens the poor more than the rich in taxes and fees.  It is quite possible that this is the beginning of real renewal which would be great for everyone.
urbanplanning,3dldbv,m0llusk,2,Fri Jul 17 12:20:42 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. I imagine there's so much property and land available in Detroit that you wouldn't see as quick and significant an impact on the poor as you've seen in DC or NYC.  However, this influx of more affluent residents needs to be accompanied by a reinvestment in all residents. It seems like a chicken-or-egg scenario. Affluent people tend to live in places with higher paying jobs. Higher paying jobs tend to be in places with affluent, educated people. I guess some companies are taking a chance with Detroit thanks to low land costs, and that's attracting people who want better-paying jobs with lower costs of living. As more and more affluent people move in to Detroit, the city and its community should reinvest so that other residents may become educated and eligible for these better-paying jobs as well."
urbanplanning,3dlilc,Xerxster,5,Fri Jul 17 06:19:58 2015 UTC,"A grid in a larger sense is a tightly connected network of streets. It's not necessary that it be orthogonal. I assume that by grid you mean an orthogonal grid plan. As it is the genral sense. Some points of criticism: 1) it lacks terminated vistas 2) it doesn't account for the underlying terrain 3) (subjective) it's boring/repetitive/lacks charm...  You can keep a mostly grid-like plan and pierce some diagonals (as in DC, or Broadway in NYC) or have some shorter terminated streets with a square as in Savannah. It becomes boring when evey street is an arterial street. Paris has grand boulevards but most streets are narrow. Most european and japanese cities do this. Introduce skinny streets in the mix. Melbourne did a great job with the laneways. I think that most people praise the grid in comparison to a hierarchical tree-like suburban model. What matters is that the grid be fine-grained (scale) and highly connected (many intersections). Angles don't matter that much."

That spurred the initial call. The children were too close to the road/creating a traffic hazard.   As far as the serving of lemonade, it's a food and health permitting issue. They can't sell lemonade without a permit because it requires inspection of temperatures (as I understand it).  Now if they were giving away lemonade and taking donations, they would have been fine.   This was a bit overblown I think.   In regard to other types of situations, I can understand where food safety can be an issue but there's a lot that may be overkill and a lot that falls through the cracks."
urbanplanning,3dhnch,gboeing,8,Thu Jul 16 15:59:44 2015 UTC,"The reason they had to get so close to car traffic is that there is no other public life where they live.

Really important to know what works when looking at homelessness.   One thing that seems to be a problem in the UK is that with benefits there isn't a smooth gradient of improvement from being on benefits to working and so for some people they'll be better off not working than working. I only mention it because with having a fixed percentage of earning going on rent it may deincentivize people working if only psychologically.

I only mention it because with having a fixed percentage of earning going on rent it may deincentivize people working if only psychologically.   Yeah, from the finding in this report, there seems to be evidence to back this up. Even though people who were given Section 8 housing vouchers were more stable, they tended to be less employed. One way or another, having a stable address goes a long way to obtaining employment, but yes, Section 8 needs to be one part in the societal safety net that helps people bounce back. I think that would also quell at least some of the most reasonable concerns over 'moochers' here in the US. The problem is that there's so little funding devoted to social welfare programs like this that comprehensive assistance is patchy and a pipe dream at best in some cities and states. Instead, we prefer to pump money into militarising our police departments and contracting corrections departments to private firms."

urbanplanning,3deu9b,combuchan,10,Wed Jul 15 18:44:36 2015 UTC,"Some European cities hit this pretty well. I have a friend that went to Vigo, Spain and lived on something like 950 Euros a month in good apartment in the middle of a beautiful city. Spain's oppurtunies may be a bit low these days but it offers safe, affordable, and dense living. I think one of the keys is that they are not obsessed with growth for growth's own sake. They met their housing demand years ago with high quality buildings. Not many people need to pay the high cost of living in a new building. They are living off the windfall of prudent investments from the past. This is something that suburbia cannot do because of the rolling blight it creates or the fact that the buildings are cheaply constructed and will need total demolition to be remade and give a site a second life."

urbanplanning,3deu9b,freedaemons,7,Thu Jul 16 14:28:05 2015 UTC,"Affordability is an issue that comes more from a lack of supply. Want to live in an urban and hip community? The United States only has New York, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, Philly, Boston, Washington,  Chicago, and Miami. Canada only has Vancouver, Montreal,  and Toronto. These communities are also (largely) the top job markets in their countries. So you're sticking an entire country's worth of urbanites into a few communities. Plus, these communities are huge markets for international migration.   There's also the issue that whole these communities have dense cores, they are still predominately suburban. Only so many people can live in the City of San Francisco, but the rest of the Bay doesn't offer the same lifestyle. If these communities expand the amount of urban housing it'll drive prices down.   If more communities were urban the pricing in the aforementioned communities would drop. In Canada, the ascension of Calgary, Edmonton,  Winnipeg,  and Ottawa into desirable urban communities will help drive prices down in Vancouver, Montreal, and Toronto.   You can see this in Europe. Yes, London and Paris are expensive. But the second tier cities in those countries offer an urban experience superior to damn near every NA city and are a fraction of the price of their capitals.   A lack of affordability comes from a demand for urban housing being far larger than the supply of urban housing."

urbanplanning,3deu9b,ArcadeNineFire,7,Thu Jul 16 20:56:12 2015 UTC,"Japanese cities aren't terrible for this. While the homes are generally small, they have all the modern amenities. Nearly all Japanese cities are dense with good public transportation.   I'd argue that this is achieved through good zoning patterns.   In Japan you can build relatively high density pretty much anywhere - even the lowest zoning type still allows for multiple domestic unit homes.  High density is normally expensive because of NIMBY created regulations.  The city starts with a CBD, which is allowed to become dense, while the surrounding suburbs have laws against it.  As the city grows those suburbs quickly become inner city, meanwhile CBD prices soar due to limited demand.   People need to build to keep down prices, but because people in the inner city campaign against zoning changes they're forced to build on the fringe - no one bothers to build density on the fringe.  Of course soon that fringe is feeling pretty central as well, but once again existing regulations prohibit density."

I'm curious about your thinking behind this because it sounds to me like you're implying that density leads to affordability problems.  Density is a response to high demand in a given area. Prices go up because people are competing for limited units, and market rents go up because available spots are going to people who will pay extra. With all else remaining the same, adding density (i.e. increasing supply) will reduce the upward pressure on prices."

There for apartments there are the least expensive anywhere.  Single family homes can co-exist as well but the ones on the fringes will always be more expensive then the apartments near by.  However higher density areas tend to cluster around services and public transit (the BRT in this case).  So in Providence a person living in townhouse or condo/apartment should have better access to services and mass transit, while still having parking, for less money then their counterparts in the single family homes.  Also, if you look at the scale on the plan, some people who can't drive (kids, the elderly) could have to walk 1KM just to get to the BRT.  How well does that serve a household with 1 car?

But you have to pay for it, and accept that you will always have poor access to services and a bad commute.  At least for downtown jobs.  If your commute is only 5 minuets away by car fine.  Nobody is having their choices taken away.  They just aren't getting the publicly subsidized new communities that people got in the 80s and 90s.  Now they have to pay full price.  Isn't that fair to everyone else?  Additionally, if you look at new Calgary communities you will find that they tend to be a mix of low rise condo/apartments and townhouses nearer to the services.  And single family homes further away.  So your ""one size fits all"" argument just doesn't work."

urbanplanning,3d9jib,gboeing,10,Tue Jul 14 15:43:58 2015 UTC,"As a Charlotte native, this is an exciting new feature to a city that is so completely centered around the automobile.  However, I do have to admit that this won't alleviate any any of the traffic problems.  There should be a street car that goes from uptown out into maybe Myers Park area, or somewhere some other residential area.  In it's current form, I just can't see this changing people's current habit of driving into Uptown from the suburbs."
urbanplanning,3d9jib,ptsbbam,9,Tue Jul 14 16:07:03 2015 UTC,"You've hit on the interesting hybrid nature of streetcars, in that they are often as much about development, city character, and other non-transportation features as much as they are about moving people around efficiently. (To be fair, every transportation project involves such tradeoffs.)  Ideally, streetcars connect easily to other modes like bus and light rail to make a car-free trip more seamless. But as /u/Johopo mentioned, it's likely that traffic impacts from this streetcar will be more indirect (e.g. by incentivizing city living vs. the suburbs)."
urbanplanning,3d9jib,ArcadeNineFire,7,Tue Jul 14 17:17:54 2015 UTC,"This was something I studied when I was going to school at Portland State. The streetcar in downtown Portland isn't hugely effective as transit but it provided crucial leverage in getting banks to give development loans to high density/low parking construction throughout downtown.  Most banks in most places still use auto-centric planning guides that mandate a lot of parking for a ""low risk"" development loan. Moreover, as they continue to expand the streetcar network it is becoming more generally useful.  The cost is a little prohibitive, though, which is why I'm glad they're looking at bus rapid transit with dedicated lanes for the next big transit restructuring on Powell Blvd."
urbanplanning,3d9jib,cinemabaroque,2,Tue Jul 14 18:24:25 2015 UTC,Fascinating! I have generally followed our inner city development and had not yet heard about the banking and financing impact of the Streetcar.
urbanplanning,3d9jib,reidpar,2,Tue Jul 14 20:37:49 2015 UTC,"I've talked to several developers in town, I was a student in the Urban Planning school at PSU, and their perspective is very different from a lot of the non-profits and community organizations that I worked with.   The main thing is that banks are very conservative organizations and typically they expect to see at least one parking spot per residential unit in a development to even consider providing a loan. In a lot of places they like the ratio to be closer to 1.5 or 2 parking spaces per residential unit. In terms of commercial development their, admittedly antiquated, planning criteria typically call for enough parking to handle ""saturation"" or ""maximum use"" which means that the parking should be sufficient to handle traffic on the peak day of the year (for a retail business say the Saturday or Sunday before Christmas, or maybe black friday).  Without the streetcar, and a bus line wouldn't cut it because nothing says commitment to an idea like laying miles of steel track into the road, there would be a lot more parking structures in downtown Portland because, regardless of the planning acumen of the City of Roses (edit: for those who don't live here, City of Roses or Rose City is a nickname for Portland), banks would have insisted on parking availability before providing financing for new development."
urbanplanning,3d9jib,cinemabaroque,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:54:44 2015 UTC,"Is that really true?  I understand that the city applied a heavy balm of tax breaks to development around the streetcar, and that the areas developed are more or less the same sort of old warehouse downtown districts that are popular for redevelopment everywhere.   I really have trouble believing all the benefits that have been ascribed to a slow and infrequent streetcar"
urbanplanning,3d9jib,Lol-I-Wear-Hats,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:17:29 2015 UTC,"The tax incentives helped too, of course, but it really was the streetcar that was instrumental in getting banks to issue loans to construct new buildings that didn't meet their parking quotas. It isn't that the streetcar itself could be said to be responsible but you know its going to be there for a long time and it definitely had an important effect.  Banks use antiquated metrics (they're conservative by nature so change comes very slowly to banks) to judge the risk of development and one thing they look at is how much parking will be available. It isn't infrequent to see banks themselves, outside of any city zoning requirement, insist on a project having a lot of parking available, frequently insisting that 1-2 parking spaces be built for every residential unit in a building. To get banks to suspend these requirements and finance the high density/minimal parking structures that have been built in downtown the streetcar was important leverage, showing that the city was willing to invest in a long term low car vision for the area.  I definitely agree that we shouldn't ascribe all the benefit to the streetcar, the puzzle is much more detailed and complex, but much of the development would have been much lower density and there would be a lot more parking structures without the streetcar. Not because the streetcar is a hugely efficient transit system but because, in a roundabout way, it enabled developers to get financing for projects that would never have been green lit without it."
urbanplanning,3d9jib,cinemabaroque,2,Tue Jul 14 23:50:39 2015 UTC,"they are often as much about development, city character, and other non-transportation features as much as they are about moving people around efficiently   That's a bit of a stretch.  It would seem to me that new-build streetcar projects are about 100% about development, character, and non-transportation features and perhaps 0-5% about moving people around efficiently.    I'm looking at you 17 minute mixed traffic streetcars."
urbanplanning,3d9jib,Lol-I-Wear-Hats,7,Tue Jul 14 22:15:14 2015 UTC,"Another Charlotte resident here.  Isn't the plan to extend the line down Central Ave, and up Beatties Ford Rd?  You're right that it probably won't change commuting habits for people who don't live near the line, but it can reduce short car trips around the area.  I imagine it will also encourage more people to live in uptown and more retail to locate there if there's more foot traffic passing by."
urbanplanning,3d9jib,Johopo,4,Tue Jul 14 17:14:19 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, actually.  I would love to see some more population density uptown, bringing on more foot traffic and retail along with it.

Don't forget the countless failed utopian settlements - often with religious underpinnings, from Oneida Community to Jonestown.  As /u/himynameiszck said, cities form for a reason. The main reason that people would start/join a city from scratch is that they are misfits who can't or won't fit in any of the countless existing communities already available to them. Predictably, when you collect all these misfits in one place, you get dysfunction.  My recommendation to you is to move around. There's a huuuge continuum between Minnesota and LA.

IT is still a walking city (60% of people walk to places) and it has the worst congestion on earth - so the extent to which cars can expand the city is at this point about Zero. They are ambitiously building out new subways though, and that should cause residents to probably cluster somewhat to the subway lines. The M2 which is derided for being linear in this article, is incredibly useful. It goes through the two skyscraper districts, and then on through the densest residential districts, and on to the Marmaray, where you can transfer to the under-bosporus trains which opened like two years ago (so the article had that dead wrong).   The M2 again, is incredibly useful however. It has transfers to the T1, M1, Marmaray, M6, and the Metrobus (rt. 34).   Those systems move a combined ~1.5 million people every day, and do not constitute the entirety of the transit system, however you can get from any rail line in the city to maslak/levent with no more than 2 transfers.   The freeways in Istanbul are entirely useless. Unforunately the city still seems to think they're useful and is building a huge freeway and 3rd bridge on the north end of the bosporus, way outside the city.

I think that made it difficult to discern whether the model didn't work because of the model itself or if it didn't work because public housing often concentrates and isolates poverty.  I would say that it's a matter of doing towers in the park well, with perhaps some retail in ground floors and without wasted space in the form of fenced off lawns and vast parking lots."
urbanplanning,3d5411,irritatedcitydweller,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:08:45 2015 UTC,"The issue I see with towers in parks is that the main quality of urban life is gone — urban life, as we've seen it in the European cities, was composed out of a lot of wall-to-wall buildings with retail on the ground floor. In many European cities, most of the downtown area is exactly like that.  And it leads to a situation where you can reach everything by foot. I live in a city with no subway, no LRT, no BRT, only bus lines. And in several of our districts we have car usage quotes of 9% (people who use the car at all) and 0% (people who use the car to go to other places in the same district).  If walk ability and high density life are our aim, we should build a lot denser. Even with only 7-floor buildings one can reach 14'000 people per km², and it improves walk ability and livability a lot."
urbanplanning,3d5411,janne-bananne,2,Tue Jul 14 14:54:04 2015 UTC,Stuy Town is actually able to maintain a higher density than the village because it's buildings are apartment buildings whereas a lot of the village is townhouses. I took a population density map and drew boundaries on it to show what I mean. Here it is. The left is roughly the Village (depending on who you ask) and the right is Stuy Town.

urbanplanning,3d5411,YoStephen,2,Tue Jul 14 01:42:56 2015 UTC,"In the end, it depends on personal preference. Both the Village and Stuy Town have far more vibrance and activity than any suburban subdivision would. However, Stuy Town is more like an enclave within New York that's a hybrid between town and city, with a very strong leaning towards city of course, but a hybrid nonetheless. It's fair to say that the Village is busier but not everyone wants that."

I'd rather be in a pre-war building with thick walls in the Village--quieter even on noisy avenues. Plus Stuy Town is a long walk to any of the subway lines that serve Manhattan.  I've lived in both places and have to say the only advantage of Stuy Town is its proximity to Ess-a-Bagel.

I'm not sure how having a park at your front doorstep is ""psychological warfare"". Sure, from the sky it looks quite dull, but the street scape is what actually matters.  Tokyo is a great example IMO, coming in on the Skyliner it looked really bleak with horrible architecture, outside of the high class central buildings the regular apartments looked like they'd been built out of toilet tiles.  Yet at street level it was completely different. It felt vibrant and interesting, well designed. On the flip side I bet Greenlane looks nice from the sky, with big green space and wide spaces. Yet from the street level it feels like a wasteland, impossible to get around by foot and most people drive through it as fast as possible."

So you can't necessarily point to it and say look how nice it is and use that as the basis of an argument for the merits of value engineered tower blocks. I could just as easily point to Pruitt Igo, Taylor homes, Cabrini Green and other projects that were so unbearable (obviously not for architectural reasons) they had to be destroyed and argue that they were dreary places to live and the lapses in their upkeep were made worse by the fact that they were not particularly pleasant to begin with.

You think there was just a random forest in lower Manhattan in the 1940s? And that developers simply 'built around the trees'?  Before the complex was built there was an entire neighbourhood there. Schools, stores, churches, homes—thousands of families. But it was deemed a 'slum' by Robert Moses, so everyone was forced out, the entire area was bulldozed, and the towers were built there instead. With no schools, no retail, no community facilities or other mixed-use whatsoever.  Oh, and for whites only, by the way.

Here's interview with him:   I wrote Heat Wave to make sense of these numbers—to show, for instance, why the Latino Little Village neighborhood had a much lower death rate than African American North Lawndale. [...] Chicago's Latinos tend to live in neighborhoods with high population density, busy commercial life in the streets, and vibrant public spaces.

I also learned that the Maple Leaf community council has worked very hard to keep a ""suburban"" feel in this part of North Seattle -- tucked between Northgate, Green Lake, and the Roosevelt neighborhood.   I've always liked the more urban feel our city has, and in particular the single family houses we see in the more urban SL areas, such as eastlake, queen anne, capital hill, etc. Places were you'll see a small house on a small lot, with a small garage tucked up against the sidewalk. I see nothing wrong with this architectural style, but the DPD told me many years ago that my garage had to meet certain setbacks, due to codes created to maintain a certain character or style in the city -- but to me -- those codes are ignorant of the fact that garages next to the sidewalk exist all over the city (they just predate the codes) -- and they do nothing to detract from our architecture in the SL areas that have them.  I'm in favor of more duplexes and triplexes in the current SL areas, in particular the areas that already have good transit (such as most of Maple Leaf), are already very walkable, and are close to parks (also like the south part of Maple Leaf).   The alternative -- of keeping exclusive SL zoning in such large swaths of the city, just encourages what my neighbor did -- built a huge 3,500 sf house, on a 9,000 sf lot. I can understand why they did this -- it is the only way to maximize their ROI on the land they bought -- but if the city reduced lot size requirements, and adjusted some of our building codes, then people could get a good ROI on their house by building something smaller -- and more sustainable."

These are then placed in the geographic centre of a region. This one will serve about 300,000 people (the population of the Østfold area it serves, not the patient count obviously).   This is a strategy for sparsely populated rural areas, not for urban areas of high density. Access to trees has always been there and Kalnes does little to change that. Many people in these rural areas now have to travel a lot longer for medical service since their old local hospital is being shut down. Whether a view to trees (past the parking lot) will offset this remains to be seen...  edit: words"
urbanplanning,3cu6zy,h3st,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:38:13 2015 UTC,"Idunno, I don't think there are as many trees around the old hospitals in Sarpsborg and Fredrikstad—they're in the city cores, if you can call it that; this new thing is out in the woods.  Sarpsborg hospital has been pretty dead for a long time though, and it already has a graveyard for a neighbour.   Many people in these rural areas now have to travel a lot longer for medical service since their old local hospital is being shut down.   Yeah, and this is off-axis for the Fredrikstad/Sarpsborg conurbation.  And I highly doubt they'll be able to get the collective transportation mode share they planned/agreed for—even the employees drive there, and then move their cars every 2.5 hours so they won't have to pay for parking. I highly doubt someone from the deep woods visiting a relative at the big hospital will be willing to take the bus out there."

We've had car culture and suburbs for so long now that adult conservatives think of them as normal, and urban areas as some newfangled experiment, when it's really the other way around.  If you listen to some conservatives here in Norway, you'd think we settled the country in the fifties or sixties, when cars became generally available here. They think it's plain impossible to get anywhere without one.  That's probably why I think articles like these, and Strongtowns, are so interesting.

urbanplanning,3cx6hp,shamankous,6,Sat Jul 11 17:10:08 2015 UTC,"From your first link:   Many commenters on this site and others have suggested these maps show the world has plenty of space for billions more people. But take a look at my new infographic and judge for yourself.   Note that seven billion people living like the average American would require more than four Earths worth of resources. Note the France, probably the best comparison if we want to isolate housing density as a factor, uses only two and a half Earths.   Solar power and electric cars will make low density living sustainable.   This is a pipe dream. Solar by itself is incapable of fully displacing coal. Adding in wind doesn't help a whole lot. Furthermore, solar gets a lot more efficient when you don't have to put an expensive battery in each house and start to centralise power requirements.  Electric cars don't solve problems like congestion and long commutes, nor should we expect them to become cheap enough to be affordable for the poorest sections of society, who must still rely on mass transit.  In fact electric cars solve one very specific problem caused by regular cars and they do it in a very specific way. They transform many small sources of carbon dioxide into one large source of carbon dioxide that can more easily be made more efficient or replaced entirely.  This pattern is emblematic of why your position is flat out wrong. Technology reduces the environmental impact of human activity, or rather raises the carrying capacity of the Earth, by centralising certain activities where major efficiency gains can be made.  For example, it requires fewer resources to build an apartment building than an equivalent number of single family homes. Just sharing a wall in town houses saves a considerable amount of resources. Similarly, it is far easier to heat and cool an apartment building than single family homes, and not only because it's cheaper to insulate the former. Having professionally managed parks is far better than everyone trying to maintain their own lawn, especially in drought stricken areas. For all their flaws, massive factory farms are far better than everyone trying to support themselves off of a small farm in their backyard. Regulating the use of water, pesticides, antibiotics, and soil management is easier when you have only two million farms rather than a hundred million.  I could reconstruct this pattern for almost every aspect of human life. The point should be clear that technology is not magic. It offers us efficiency in exchange for centralisation. (Look at assembly lines compared to bespoke manufacturing for an example unrelated to housing.) The source you linked makes it clear that we are already living beyond our means. If we want change that switching from single family homes and two car garages to apartments and trains is the most effective method we have."

So I'm not immune to this. My wife and I built a new house on an abandoned lot in Washington, D.C., and we did our best to clear the shelves of the sustainability store. We've got the solar photovoltaic system, solar hot water heater, dual-flush toilets, bamboo floors. A log burning in my German high-tech stove apparently, supposedly, contributes less carbon to the atmosphere than were it left alone to decompose in the forest. Yet all of these innovations -- That's what they said in the brochure.

Evidence: http://www.kiddermathews.com/research.php?market=apartment  Prices. PRices are SKY HIGH in the city. King County as a whole just crossed 500K median, it was like 350K 5 years ago or something. PEople are paying like 600K for fixxer uppers in Seattle, 1M in S.F.   Prices in the exurbs meanwhile, are dirt cheap.   This is not from some push to make people build in the city, its still only legal to build up on a very small percentage of land, but every available parcel pretty much is being built on right now. There's 40 SFH being built on the lot next to me, and another 40 behind that, but ths SFH being built right now (despite being probably cheaper to build) is not outpacing the multifamily construction at all. Half of this state's growth is in King County, and over half of that in in Seattle City Proper, and almost None of City limits seattle is SFH, and in my suburb the like one lot available for MF housing has like a 7 story apartment building going up on it.

In light of that, what do you expect? When you step back and take a broad view of many cities, is it clear that what I'm saying is correct?

Houston has no zoning or UGB to speak of.  The demand for multifamily housing is there and isn't being met with existing supply.  Your claim that those renting or buying in high density central areas REALLY desire to live in a McMansion in the exurbs but are settling for a condo or towhouse is pretty strained, considering the fact that it costs far less to live in the exurbs.  The construction of high or medium density residential units is happening in every metropolitan area that has a thriving economy, namely because a home in a walkable, bikeable area close to downtown is a desired product whose demand is not being quenched.  Differences in vacancy rates and prices should be sufficient to indicate that to you.  Why is this the one issue in which libertarians are actually arguing against market signals?  I live in ""close-in"" Portland, Oregon (not downtown, but within a three mile radius of downtown), and I can vouch for the fact that people live there because it's convenient and they enjoy the urban amenities.  Nobody who lives there harbors a secret desire to live in Hillsboro, but only refrains from moving because of that nasty urban growth boundary.  Quite the contrary, Hillsboro is cheaper and those who want to live there already do.  People who live in Portland itself would only move to Hillsboro if they got priced out of Portland or ended up getting a job out there.  We don't want to live in Hillsboro.  We want to live in Portland, but our rents are climbing in fast, namely because regardless of how many new apartments we build, it's failing to satiate the demand of everybody who wants to live in close-in Portland.  I have friends who are worried about having no choice but to move to the suburbs in order to afford rent.  They don't actually want to go there.  People could evade the growth boundary entirely by living in Vancouver, Washington or one of it's suburbs.  Housing is way cheaper there, namely because because supply is high in relation to demand.  People are willing to pay more to live in Portland and to not live in Vancouver.  Many people obviously do enjoy living in the suburbs, but we aren't the one making the claim that there is no demand for suburban detached housing.  How many times does this point need to be driven home to you? You never actually refute it.  You just keep repeating the same arguments and pretend to forget everybody's counter arguments every time you post a new article."

Demand is primarily for single family homes though. Have you ever seen a survey of people that says they want to their family to a condo...if only they could find one!? Lol  From the article:   In the internal data of the 2011 Community Preference Survey commissioned by the National Association of Realtors, no specific question was asked about density, but 52 percent of respondents said, if given a choice, they would prefer to live in traditional suburbs, small towns or the rural countryside. Another 28 percent chose a suburban setting that allowed for some mixed uses (Question 5). Taken together, this shows an overwhelming preference for low densities. Only 8 percent of the respondents favored a central city environment.  As for vibrant urbanism, only 7 percent were “very interested” in living in a place “at the center of it all.” Most people wanted to live “away from it all” (Question 17). An astonishing 87 percent said “privacy from neighbors” was important to them in deciding where to live. One can reasonably infer that a majority of this majority would favor low density places with separated uses rather than crowded, noisy mixed use locations that blur the line between public and private.  When presented with a range of housing choices, 80 percent preferred the “single-family detached house” (Question 6). Only eight percent chose an apartment or condominium. Furthermore, 61 percent preferred a place where “houses are built far apart on larger lots and you have to drive to get to schools, stores, and restaurants” over 37 percent who wanted a place where “houses are built close together on small lots and it is easy to walk to schools, stores and restaurants” (Question 8)."

Also, the points they picked out, clearly are leaving things out. 7 percent were ""very interested"" great, what percent were ""mildly interested"", or just, ""interested""  And privacy from neighbors doesn't necessarily mean SFH. I felt more private from my neighbors in my 45th floor condo than I ever have in my homes growing up and where I am now.   There's lots of available condos in detroit, New Orleans, St. Louis I'm sure, places where few people want to live for very obvious reasons.   Look at places like DC, Seattle, Chicago (not the south and west sides), San Francisco, Los Angeles, Denver, Austin. All rapidly urbanizing places, but hobbling towards it because their laws haven't caught up with things.  My super conservative ""I love my car and my space"" parents are getting old and they're gonna move into the city (even though they hate it for what it stands for...) because driving cars everywhere and keeping up their own garden doesn't make sense for them anymore.

You get perfect walk ability, perfect quietness, it's ideal for people of every age (due to the courtyard, children have a safe place to play, they can make a lot of friends, old people can work on garden areas in the courtyard with neighbors, keeping important social connections.)  And it's actually sustainable. With the Single Family Housing model, we need 4.5 times the resources of earth to support everyone. With the European model, we get 2 times the resources of the planet.

The skyscraper was 100x better than the suburbs.   Seattle area is 100 time more awesome than Chicago, but I'd much rather live downtown. As most of my friends tend to prefer that as well. Living downtown near my friends they can come over, and have a beer, and no one has to drive home, among many many other things. We can walk to the grocery store, to everything else.  You have to make compromises to live in the city, sure, but you make different equivalent compromises to live in the burbs. You give up 3 hours of your day to mind boggling traffic and the incredible expense of car ownership living in the burbs. Many people give up their good health to live in the burbs (because people tend to trade longer commutes and less exercise in the burbs with more active time and not as hellish commutes in the city) Living in the city you give up the convenience of having a car to do things (well, not everyone does. I didn't. two of my city years I was carless, 4 I had a car, though I rarely used it- road trips, costco, hardware, and far suburban trips).   Stockholm syndrome? Fuck that. I'm moving to Istanbul.

Single family homes require more public infrastructure spending per capita, they need more upkeep and maintenance, they use much more energy, and they are generally further away from jobs than multifamily dwellings in urban areas. A lucky few people can afford a single family home in an urbanized area with lots of jobs close by, but the prices of such homes is out of range to the vast majority of the population. If you asked people if they would like a single family home with a huge yard in the middle of Manhattan, most people would probably say yes. But that's not very realistic, is it?   And the reality is that Kotkin is demonstrably wrong as the market has already spoken. In Southern California, where Kotkin lives, cheap single family homes on the edge of the urbanized area haven't recovered the housing bust, yet in core urban areas like downtown Los Angeles, condos and apartments are more expensive than ever. More Americans are smart enough to realize that being close to good jobs and looking at the total cost of ownership should take precedence over the idealization of single family home ownership.

urbanplanning,3cx6hp,Lol-I-Wear-Hats,4,Sun Jul 12 15:41:00 2015 UTC,"The very first sentence: Overall, initial infrastructure costs in low-density new developments tend to be higher per unit than they are in smart growth developments, largely because the costs are spread over more units and non-residential uses.  Per Square foot does not matter if there's significantly less square feet!!!!   Per Unit is how cost is distributed across the population. If the population has to pay less for things, they are better off, they can spend more money on themselves, and less on shit like roads which make them unhealthy anyways.  So I did a study of land uses/density levels. I based it on my block in Streeterville at the time. My block in Streeterville (5 acres) has 1312 units on it. Using costs for different road types needed to serve my block, and the perimeter of my block, I calculated the cost to serve it with roads and fixed transit., It went as follows:  Streeterville: (dense downtown skyscraper neighborhood) (1 block) 266 du/acre, .05 miles of urban 2-lane roads - $475,000, .41 miles of urban 4-lanes - 5,494,000, .05 miles of subway - 45,454,545.45 total: 51,423,545.45  Gold Coast:(skyscraper neighborhood) (~2.6 blocks) 100 du/acre, .148 mi urban 2-lane - 1,406,000, 4-lane urban 1 mi - 13,400,000, .147 mi subway - 118,181,818.18. Total: 132,987,818.18  Lakeview:(Dense urban neighborhood) (8.7 blocks) 30 du/acre, 2.46 mi 2-lane urban - 23,370,000, 1.65 mi 4-lane urban - 22,110,000, .5 miles of elevated rail - 75,000,000. Total: 120,480,000  S. Side(half abandoned city-blocks): (32.8 blocks) 8du/acre, 9.28 mi urban 2-lane - 88,160,000, 6.2 mi urban 4-lane - 83,080,000, 1.86 mi Elevated rail, 279,119,318. Total: 450,359,318.18  Norwood (dense suburbs) (43.73 blocks): 6du/acre, 12.4 mi urban 2-lane - 117,800,000, 8.27 mi urban 4-lane - 110,818,000, 2.48 mi commuter rail - 27,293,750. Total: 255,911,750  Hyde Park (wealthy low density suburbs) (187 blocks): 1.4 du/acre, 88 mi rural 2-lane - 572,000,000, 21.25 mi commuter rail - 233,750,000. Total: 805,750,000  I also looked at the average value of property in those areas, value to infrastructure cost was 15:1 in Streeterville, 3.5:1 in the Gold Coast, 4.3:1 in Lakeview, .47:1 on the S. Side, 1.28:1 in Norwood, and 1.04:1 in hyde park (despite having the most expensive housing types) So taxes for roads and transit would need to be 15 times as high in hyde park to pay for things than they would have to be in streeterville.   You just keep pulling out stats that don't matter over and over again to support your argument, and those stats have no bearing on actually anything really. You need to learn how to use statistics to actually show something that matters, and is relevant to the conversation.  You use a TON of fuzzy math.  Subways cost 800MM$/mile roughly, Commuter rail costs like 11,000,000/mile. That doesn't mean its cheaper to serve people with commuter rail. If you only have to go 1 mile with a subway, and you have to go 150 with commuter rail to serve the same number of people, the commuter rail is way more expensive, and I can guarantee you the commuter rail trains are more expensive to maintain by a ton!"

On the one hand, it makes me feel more optimistic about the town I now live in (Bryan, TX), because it's done almost all these things - there's a few popular restaurants, cowork space with fast internet, gigabit plans, downtown lofts (I'm one of the very first residents in some of these new buildings, but there's some smaller and older renovated ones), a downtown business association that is renovating the Art Deco movie theater. They haven't yet done anything about the excess parking (and in fact, they spent millions of dollars to build an extra parking garage because people complained about sometimes having to walk half a block), and there's not yet an ""alternative school"". We've even got some of the ""down the road"" things: we've got a great coffee shop and a farmers market downtown, and Greyhound service to Houston, but not a real neighborhood market or commuter bus yet.  And yet, even with all this, the main growth in town is still leapfrog development several miles out of town, and downtown feels pretty dead except for the one day a month when people come out. Many of the downtown buildings with the special high-speed internet are still sitting vacant, and a large number of the storefronts that are filled have law offices or something else that doesn't really generate foot traffic. Immediately north of the four block downtown strip, there's a few blocks of actually vacant land (I believe it's where the cotton gins used to stand), and then a few blocks of vacant buildings that need a lot of renovation before they can be occupied. (I'm hoping that at least a few of these will eventually be occupied by black-owned businesses, because the entire north half of town is mostly black, but I don't believe any of them are represented in the part that has been revitalized).  It's possible I'm just being too pessimistic about this, because I moved here from an actual big city (I was in Los Angeles the past six years) so that I'm still not properly appreciative of what we have. But it's taken a lot of work to get where we are, and it still seems like there's a long way to go! Good luck with Hogansville!"

I haven't convinced myself that this small-town strategy actually does make sense, but I can believe that maybe there's another model for pursuing some number of tech jobs without trying to pin one's hopes on it as the future core of the local economy."

NO! Do not do this! I have spent a lot of time on the economic development side and I used to believe that I could manage real estate better than the private sector. I can't.

urbanplanning,3cmkh9,Localist007,4,Thu Jul 9 01:59:37 2015 UTC,Or just eliminate deed restrictions and minimum parking requirements that both favor big-box stores over small mom-and-pop shops.
urbanplanning,3cmkh9,traal,3,Thu Jul 9 04:40:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is the answer.  Subsidizing infrastructure for big box stores on the edge of town is part of what allows them to operate the way they do.  Zoning requirements for minimum parking space also discourage the type of development that sustains small stores.  These laws don't seem to change often, and I've seen the harm that the misguided policies of yesterday have done.  I think piling on more attempts at changing lifestyles through regulations could very well have negative, unforeseen consequences."
urbanplanning,3cmkh9,tabloidmoney,2,Thu Jul 9 04:33:00 2015 UTC,"How about you just use the zoning code to encourage these stores in small town main streets instead of on outskirts... what is wrong with a 150,000sqft store on 4 levels on main street? Right beside Linda's bakery, bob's archery and steve's deli? The problem is these big box stores located all by themselves in auto/highway style open air centres. Where the people who travel to them go there and then go home insted of stopping at the small local store. Yes dave's hardware will never compete with Home Depot, but most small stores that are unprofitable to be large and unruly will survives IF the foot traffic and window traffic is there. At least that's my opinion."
urbanplanning,3cmkh9,Himser,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:25:05 2015 UTC,I can imagine some people might not like the idea of forcing large retail into the centres of towns but I think the idea that smaller stores don't do do well is because of their distance from mega stores is interesting. Why not instead of forcing mega stores to occupy land in the middle of towns make sure that when they set up shop further away that other stores have the opportunity to go join them by making it so that other retail space next door to these shops is made available for smaller businesses.
urbanplanning,3cmkh9,moolah_dollar_cash,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:20:58 2015 UTC,I can see that working to a limited extent. However I belive the rent costs in these locations would be unsustainable for small local retail. (I have yet to see a open air mall acutualy have a local business and not a chain in any of their lease spaces) I'm far from an expert in this area but there is most likely a good reason local stores do not take up these locations.

If you have a 4 bedroom single family house on a 5,000 SF plot of land it will have a similar if not slightly greater property value than one of 4 town homes on the same 5,000 SF plot...assuming the quality of construction is held constant for the comparison. The difference is, you now have 4 families living on one 5,000 SF for the same price as 1 family living on the plot.  This creates affordability in a neighborhood."
urbanplanning,3ck6qn,alexfrancisburchard,17,Wed Jul 8 16:05:46 2015 UTC,"The property does not lose value when you upzone it. Individual units however will become cheaper. Which is good.

There's some great parking stuff in there, including reducing/eliminating subsets of parking requirements, implementing cap and trade parking passes, creating parking benefit districts, and limiting residential parking permits.

My main target would be north along Gruvgatan that I would narrow and take away roundabouts from, kick out the gas station from the street... this is a straight street directly to the downtown city and has good potential to live up. Its direction would also get afternoon sun which is good for cafes etc. There are more strange unused lots along this street, but maybe they have been built and google streetview is outdated?  A mining city like Falun ought to be able to dig down E16 and make the old mine pit be the park for the area.   The city plan you made doesnt have many parks or plazas. Also you remove sporting grounds. These are all things that brings people together.  Also, you build over the train tracks from Falun's industrial era.

If you think you're going to spend all day envisioning glorious new cityscapes you will probably be disappointed. Real life is not like Sim City and planners work within larger power structures with many moving pieces.   Most planners play the role of technician. It's your job to understand things like how cities function, how regulations function and what their purpose is, what the ramifications of certain decisions might be, how transportation systems function, and other such things. Planners are not usually elected officials and therefore are typically not making big decisions. Someone else usually sets the goals and you help figure out how to get there.   How you apply this expertise, what kinds of goals you are working towards, and what your day-to-day experience is like will vary depending on circumstance. You will probably be writing and communicating a lot, collecting field data, analyzing data, presenting to all sorts of different audiences. Many planners act as a conduit connecting people with various types of expertise like architects, designers, engineers, and lawyers. Entry level planners in zoning administration probably do the most ""paperwork"" like churning out standardized reports, forms, etc."

Planners do lots of writing, so if you don't like that, then it's not for you.   A big part of planning is ""the process"" which is what I think of ""paperwork"" as; if you are a development officer, you are reviewing plans and ensuring compliance with the rules. Each jurisdiction will have different powers granted to the development officer. Some will give lots of discretion and latitude to make a good decision and negotiate for a better outcome whereas others will be more like a computer system (yes/no, do you meet the minimum requirements or not). If you are a policy planner, then similarly, there are legislative requirements that need to be met and internal processes to get an item in front of City Council. So yes, there is a lot of paperwork.   But depending on your job and how large the municipality is (and generally as a result how specialized your job is), you have other aspects of work that will be less ""paperwork"" focused (i.e. less process focused and more creative writing). For example, I use Illustrator and Photoshop often in my job. I write lots of things that are interesting; I interact with lawyers to ensure what I write will work well. You can build surveys, make phone calls, present at open houses or go out in the field to present to local groups on issues, etc."

That said, I have a planning degree and I am an adjunct lecturer in planning at our local university.  Often times, 'studio' classes in planning are the classes where you work on a group or solo project that takes a full semester complete.  For example, a redevelopment plan for a neighborhood.  First you are researching the demographics, taking photos, reviewing zoning, etc.    I would say, art is not generally a requirement for planning as a profession.  Some planners are designers, but many others are more in the data side of things.    I hope this helps.  Feel free to contact me with any more questions."

In our studios we've hand drawn site plans, street elevations, cross-sections, and done various other sketches and maps involving urban design. You don't necessarily have to be great at art, but in working on projects you'll get better.

The post thing got some extra attention because Norway might for the first time say ""how about no"" to a directive from the EU.  I think both the pro-EU and the anti-EU crowd here feel like we should either shit or get off the fence, because it's really starting to rub (hope you'll excuse me mixing sayings). That is, either join the EU for reals and get to vote, or get the fuck out of the EEC and start ignoring directives.  Leaving the EEC seems to me to be less and less popular, in a way. I don't see people cheering for a grexit or brexit, wishing them into our merry club of non-joiners. When the oil money stops flowing we'll probably join. We pride ourselves on being all solidaric-like, but part of the reason we haven't joined the EU is because we don't want to spend our oil money on helping poor South European countries.

It seems like the city has some incredibly valuable land which could be developed, especially in the east side downtown image, but the city can't develop these areas above a certain height because a state law says certain corridors have to be able to see the capitol building?  I really don't understand why this is such an important issue, can someone please explain why?"
urbanplanning,3bwbkc,Eclogital,9,Fri Jul 3 00:27:57 2015 UTC,"The Texas State Capitol was the tallest building in Austin from 1888 to 1972. When this law was written in 1983  downtown was still full of surface parking, government buildings, old warehouses and low-rise offices, and very few commercial towers--nothing over 25 stories.  Lawmakers and historical societies wanted to preserve vistas of our quite-grand Capitol in our quaint capital city, but the legislature is not known for being especially prudent in considering future development several decades out :)    In the past 10-15 years downtown construction has exploded... there are new condos, apartments, hotel and office towers shooting up.  All those Capitol View Corridors (CVCs) may have seemed reasonable when the law was passed, but they have become quite restrictive in areas.  The issue comes up often in urbanist blogs, news articles, etc--people propose shrinking or eliminating many corridors--but so far I don't think lawmakers have taken any action on the subject.  In the meantime development goes on, contorting to fit the regulations."

Medium density doesn't prevail for many interesting reasons. You'll want to research the reasons of consumer/market preferences. Developers want to build what will sell, not what sounds better in academic theory. Next is do municipalities even allow medium density? Zoning By-laws/codes often don't or make it difficult to build it on small sites due to requirements for minimum parking, loading, etc.  Best of luck with your paper!"

urbanplanning,3bvet7,Planner1991,7,Thu Jul 2 13:48:30 2015 UTC,"""Legitimacy"" is a tricky word and context matters. A few things:    JJ wasn't an ""urban planner"" per se but a sociologist and an astute observer.  When we talk about JJ's ""legitimacy,"" we can twist her legacy into any direction that suits our needs. I think this is a great way to use the mythos of her ideas. Instead of railing for or against the idea of right-sizing or neighborhood-ness, let's pick and choose context and have an honest discussion about why JJ became popular in the first place and her place among the planning folklore.  What we see, and this is why JJ is considered so highly in modern planning, is 50+ year old ideas just now becoming popular and moved from fringe topic to national conversation. There's an attractive and prophetic quality about this.  There's nothing wrong with radical ideology as long as we as planners continue to understand context. I can't stress this enough. JJ should indoctrinate and intoxicate and for many of us, Death and Life was our first foray into the quixotic world of untrained and unrestrained planning.    It is of utmost importance that when we talk about JJ and Death and Life that we don't try to push one idea over another, but rather have an honest conversation about what works and what doesn't, at this specific time and this specific place.   Without context, JJ's ideas can be considered fanaticism and even in context it has been shown in no greater irony than JJ's home rolling over into corporate hipsterism and regenerative urbanism, which has chipped away at the authenticity JJ so valiantly fought for.   For the record, without Moses we don't get all the good with the bad. Say what you will about his authoritarian style, but I'm happy with the hundreds of parks he helped build in equal measure with the West Side Highway and FDR.   That said, there's a certain allure to such a wide ROW on the fringe of the most glorious grid in the world. Once car ownership becomes more or less moot (at some point, relax) we can hope to repurpose these spaces into some serious density.   I predict JJ and Moses will collide soon enough, but not without context and the legitimacy of our own rigorous interpretation of ideology.   Whew."
urbanplanning,3bvet7,Alors_cest_sklar,9,Thu Jul 2 14:03:21 2015 UTC,"You only get a radical ideology from committing to a radical ideology.   Her book is foundational but her actual advice is pretty general and anyone looking for a specific way forward for their city is bound to be disappointed by her. The thesis of Death and Life is basically that a lot of things that make a neighborhood ""work"" can be counter-intuititve to a prevailing mode of rational planning that was ubiquitous at the time. Her recommendation was to basically look at what works and build from there rather than make assumptions about human nature and not actually test those assmptions before implementing a big plan which is what she saw being done."

Lots of people have co-opted her work for their own ideological purposes (usually left-leaning people; for some odd reason supporters of small government and market forces don't seem to go in for her ""let neighbourhoods develop organically"" premise) but Jacob's genius was largely observational, not prescriptive.  Really, if your friend is making these allegations about Jacobs, the onus should be on them to demonstrate that any of them are true. What exactly do they find radical about her?  Not to suggest you should discredit your co-worker, but think about what kind of projects they have done. For someone whose career is a series of suburban cul-de-sacs and auto-oriented commercial centres, yeah, Jane Jacobs will look pretty radical. For anyone educated since the eighties, and certainly for anyone experienced with traditional mainstreets and walkable neighbourhoods, I think Jane Jacobs is pretty conventional knowledge."

I don't really like the false alternative between no towers whatsoever and the Robert Moses'esque urban dystopia involving the complete demolition of entire neighborhoods and their replacement with office and residential towers, parking lots, convention centers, empty parks and freeways.  There are plenty of examples of cities where tower construction did not involve the complete demolition of a neighborhood.  For example, here in Portland, the neighborhood of Goose Hollow was once primarily bungalows, 2/3/4-plexes and garden apartments, but in the 1950s, zoning was changed, and now there are about eight residential towers in the neighborhood.  The prior dwellings didn't get demolished in mass and the majority of them are still there.  The towers ""fit"" with the ""character"" of the neighborhood, in the sense that they are a part of the character of the neighborhood, and nobody really remembers the 1950s version of the neighborhood before the towers were built.  (The West End in Vancouver, BC is a more extreme example of this.)  There are a couple of neighborhoods in Portland, however, that went the Robert Moses route, such as the Rose Quarter, which was still a disaster, and the PSU/Coliseum area, which has only started to resemble a neighborhood again in the past ten years or so."
urbanplanning,3bvet7,strangewool123,2,Thu Jul 2 20:06:49 2015 UTC,"I do not recall her being explicitly anti-skyscraper.

urbanplanning,3bvet7,mr_glasses,2,Thu Jul 2 21:21:53 2015 UTC,"She wasn't really anti-skyscraper, she just correctly pointed out that as cities evolve and land values go up and construction technology advances the ""optimal"" economic building form also changes.  So at one time 3 story walk-ups might be the most economical thing to build, but later 10 story apartments are.  She did point out though that extremely tall buildings really need to make sure their street interaction is just as good as a shorter building.  As long as you kill it on the street level, what you do above doesn't matter so much.  In her day though a lot of skyscrapers had horrible ground levels/podiums and she was just observing that quite often the areas around the bases of these towers were not pleasant.  That's really all jacobs did, she wandered around and observed urban life and how it related to urban design."
urbanplanning,3bvet7,butterslice,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:09:16 2015 UTC,"If observation of peoples behaviour in an urban context is considered radical, then yeah she must be a bit radical.  Some of Death and Life has since been seen as outdated or incorrect, but its importance as a foundation of modern urban design can't be understated. Regardless of the general stuff about small blocks and sidewalk ballets, the chapter on the city as a 'Problem of Organised Complexity' introduced ideas on urban development that we are only just starting to look at in detail. She kickstarted that at a time when the entire profession of planning and architecture was against her. That itself is impressive."

Edit: Oops, didn't see /u/ScipioA's response when I was typing up mine.

urbanplanning,3broe3,strangewool123,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:44:29 2015 UTC,"My point should be pretty obvious.  You said that rent control in Vancouver hasn't prevented the construction of more rental units.  I'm aware that Vancouver has a higher than average population density, but I only read about the construction of condominiums there, not rental properties.  What I want to know is: What percentage of new construction actually consists of rental properties instead of condos?  Obviously, rent control won't discourage the construction of condos, as they aren't subject to rent control."
urbanplanning,3broe3,beguiledfoil,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:53:14 2015 UTC,"Often condos can be purchased by investors and rented.  The fact is that Vancouver is doing a better job of meeting demand than Seattle, despite the fact that Seattle has no rent control. This is because other factors dominate this equation, particularly the quality of public transit and street dimensions (which is what actually enables dense development).  Vancouver has narrow streets (with ample room for pedestrians and cyclists) and excellent transit. So it doesn't need to let developers or other landowners fuck renters. In a vacuum rent control will always lower returns on housing and thus reduce investment, but in the real world that can be sound counter cyclical macroeconomic policy. The fact that Seattle is now a less desirable city than Vancouver is a pretty clear indication that this is possible."
urbanplanning,3broe3,alexfrancisburchard,2,Thu Jul 2 02:02:26 2015 UTC,"It costs astronomically more to buy in Vancouver than in Seattle however. If they're so good at meeting demand, why is that so?"
urbanplanning,3broe3,beguiledfoil,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:20:28 2015 UTC,"If they're so good at meeting demand, why is that so?   There is no one answer for why real estate is so expensive to own in Vancouver, but the fact that it is fetching such a high price torpedoes the naive economic arguments about rent control. Economists expect:   Low quality housing stock because lower rents are inhibiting investment in existing real estate. Low construction rates because rent controls cap future returns from renting new construction   Neither of these have happened in Vancouver. The opposite has happened. That is extremely frustrating, because the debate in Seattle is still framed this way despite the fact that it obviously doesn't have to apply in this region.  Fundamentally Vancouver, as a city, is creating value through good planning and quality development. People that can are purchasing that quality permanently (despite a decade of astronomical prices), people that can't are renting and they aren't getting ripped off as badly as renters in Seattle and SF. This is /r/urbanplanning so I should be preaching to the choir, but when planners do their job better than the competition the result is value, and progressive policy like rent control can widen the population that shares in that value and also buffer against the idiocy of the market (see Seattle in 2008 vs. Vancouver in 2008)."

So I am curious to know if developers still have an incentive to build rental units given BC's laws.  I've been to Vancouver a number of times, and definitely agree that it's an attractive city, hence the strong demand.  However, if developers have to be able to capitalize on said demand if they are going to build rental units at all.  What are the specifics of the BC rent control laws?  Is it like in Germany, where the landlord can raise the rent, but only a specific percentage per year, or slightly more if they make infrustructural improvements?  Or is there an absolute cap?  Or do they primarily build condominiums, which are then rented out by the buyers of the units?"

Yes, province wide price increase limits. 3 month notice of rent increase, and the increase can be disputed if it exceeds the limit set by the province. Here is a table of the amount owners have been allowed to increase rent.   Or do they primarily build condominiums, which are then rented out by the buyers of the units   Condo development is popular in Vancouver, and they are rented by owners. Rent increase limits still apply.   So I am curious to know if developers still have an incentive to build rental units given BC's laws   There will always be an incentive to build units where there is demand for housing, provided material and labor costs are reasonable."
urbanplanning,3broe3,Lol-I-Wear-Hats,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:30:21 2015 UTC,"Sure it does.  They haven't built large numbers of rental units in Vancouver since the 1970s when the TEAM city council zoned most of them out.  IIRC the total annual number of purpose-built rentals built in BC in the last few years numbers in the high three digits.    Vancouver rents are low for several reasons. Certainly a rent control policy which allows rents to rise twice as fast as inflation and allows relatively easy evictions for renovation doesn't hurt rental construction as much as less accommodating policies might, but also Vancouver simply doesn't have the wage levels to drive rents terribly high.   Vancouverites suffer through some of the lowest incomes of Canada's cities (only Abbottsford, Trois Riviere, and Sherbrooke pay worse) and wages here are certainly lower than any comparable city on the US West Coast.   Lastly, Vancouver is highly accommodating of secondary unit rentals, such as basements and laneway houses that take pressure off the rental market to an extent that is less found in other cities. Vancouver suburbs have also be historically much more accommodating of multi-unit housing than similar locations in much of the United States (see Burnaby Apartment Studies, 1966).  While US cities were busy tearing themselves down, in the 1950s and 1960s, Vancouver actually allowed the redevelopment of many older neighborhoods for privately owned (often federally subsidized) apartment blocks. Much of this housing stock at its age comprises a good measure of the region's stock of more affordable housing. Its a pity that the city council banned more of it in the 1970s."

urbanplanning,3bp5j1,CantabKBH,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:46:19 2015 UTC,"Why did this not occur in the past the same way as NYC or other cities I'm leaving out? Were there irreconcilable differences between peoples or was it negligence to what being a large combined urban center would mean in a globalized society?   Well in New England it goes back to Congregationalism. The Puritans adhered to an church organization doctrine known as 'Congregationalism' which held, in brief, that each church (i.e. Congregation) had to follow certain rules, but was otherwise independent of any central hierarchy. Every town in colonial New England would have had a church, which would serve at both the religious, democratic, and civic heart of the community - the first settlements covered massive areas, so there was often a need for disparate settlers to either commute long distances to their town's meetinghouse/church or erect a church of their own. Cambridge, MA for example used to include Brighton, Arlington (which was called ""West Cambridge"" for 50 years after it seceded from Cambridge), Lexington, parts of Waltham, Belmont and Billerica. Since the religious and political functions were so closely aligned in early New England, the establishment of a new parish all but assured the political secession of that parish from it's parent church. To go back to Cambridge, the city we know today as Cambridge is really 3 separate towns (Old Cambridge, Cambridgeport, and East Cambridge) - Cambridgeport and EC tried to secede in the 1830s but the movement failed in no small part because Old Cambridge merchants and businessmen held assets in the other two parishes and didn't want to cede political control.   So that's the socio-political foundation for New England hyper-autonomous communities. There were certainly elements of fear of centralized power, but I wouldn't elevate that fear as the reason for such a balkanized area.   However, there is one very, very important caveat: those drunken, rapey, Papist Irishmen. Or rather the fear of the Hibernians. Yankee Boston was a rigidly intolerant Puritan society (so rigid that once hung Baptists on Boston Common for idk...not wearing a buckle on their hat or something) and one the shared a common heritage with English Puritans who had engaged in some very, very unsavory deeds under Cromwell in the Irish isle. Following the potato famine and the ensuing wave of Irish immigrants, Boston's ethnic and religious make-up shifted rapidly from primarily Yankee congregationalists to one with a heavy dose of Catholic inhabitants. The Yankees had certainly created an astoundingly impressive civic culture, but their fatal flaw was their rigid intolerance to all things Irish. The irish for their part aligned themselves with the Democratic party - in contrast to the Federalist/Whig/Republican Yankees - and slowly acceded to political dominance by the end of the 19th century. James Curley, who wrought the apex of Irish political dominance, used his power to reverse the Yankee habit of barring the Irish from 'polite society' and, quite literally, drove the Yankees from Boston (they persisted only in the Back Bay and Beacon Hill, with a few pockets of middle-class Curley-aligned protestants scattered about the city).  This political revolution coincided with Boston's annexation craze. Many of the surrounding cities still had their traditional congregationalist-derived power structures, so for them, annexation to Boston was a direct threat to their culture and quality of life. The towns that were annexed, were by the late 1800s, already heavily immigrated populated.   In New England in particular, the annoyingly balkanized nature of the modern municipal governance is derived from these cultural factors and not from the later, more economics-inspired annexations of the Midwest, South, etc.. and there wasn't much through (that I know of) put into supporting/opposing a notion of a ""globalized society""."

There are, however, a number of North American cities with suburbs that are becoming more urban, like Bellevue, WA (suburb of Seattle) or all the suburbs of Vancouver, BC, although in their case, Hong Kong is more the model than German cities.  Regardless, if more suburbs start to urbanize their cores, they can sop up much of the demand for an urban lifestyle that's driving up prices in the handful of North American cities that offer amenities like walkability, bikeability, etc."

It has to do with trying to live near work, with not being reliant on a car, with the willful abandonment of pseudo-rural non-communities that have only existed for a generation or two anyways.  The previous generation bought into the suburb lifestyle and the grass-and-car fetishism that goes with it. If anything, the current generation has tastes more in line with traditional non-rural life.   Edit: Places like Fresno and Rochester are a historical abberation.

Sure, if you want a home in a good area it might cost that much, but starter homes should be less than $250k in most cities.   So instead, households with higher incomes and dreams of white picket fences remain in the rental market. Those households take up available units in the mid-to-high price ranges, for which they can afford to pay a premium.   It seems like the problem is not that rent is inherently too expensive, but that people are renting places they can't afford.   But until housing policies change—allowing for more affordable housing to be built more rapidly, or mortgage companies loosen the tight reins placed on credit in the wake of the crisis—rental prices will continue to push upward, and those who can afford the increases least, will suffer most.    What policy is that? People want the luxury apartments, so that's what's being built."

If an apartment is mandated to be minimum of 750 sq. ft., and mandated to come with a parking spot, then it may be that luxury apartments are the ones that make the highest profit margin. But if you're allowed to build smaller units without parking, it's very possible that even under current market conditions, there would be a second equilibrium where you rent/sell three times as many units at half the price for the same total construction cost."

This link suggests that several of the most urban cities in the United States allow units that are below 500 sq. ft., though in some cities (like San Francisco) only a very small number of these small units are being allowed, and in other cities (like Boston) the minimum only goes below 500 sq. ft. in a few very specific neighborhoods, and only allows 500 sq. ft. if the apartment is in a studio configuration. But I notice the article doesn't mention Houston, Dallas, or Los Angeles (top ten population cities in top ten population metro areas), and also doesn't mention any cities other than the core city even in the metro areas that it does address. I would not be surprised if most suburbs even in these cities have regulations mandating larger units (even if indirectly, through zoning codes that  mandate minimum lot size and maximum number of units per lot)."
urbanplanning,3bl79r,aggieotis,5,Thu Jul 2 20:51:28 2015 UTC,"Honestly the whole concept that a starter home should cost X amount is ridiculous. Prices vary. Incomes vary. Interest rates vary. There are a ton of various factors.  Just looking at income, price, and interest rates... Figure that homeownership is probably only really possible for those earning median income ($50k/year). And figure that of that income 30% or less should be allocated for housing. Raw house price is irrelevant. Price per month is all most people care about. And with rates as low as they are $200k at a ""Normal times"" 6% ($1200/mo or ~30% pre-tax median income) would be about the same monthly payment at $250k at 4%. Factor in another 10% inflation since ""Normal times"" and there's a good chunk of your price difference between ""Normal times"" and today."

CIP is continuing to operate, the MCIP designation continues to exist, and all MCIP's have some significant decisions to make in the future.   Before the AGM, members received an announcement from the outgoing Council advising of their resolution to commence the winding down of CIP. This announcement arose from concerns by CIP Council regarding: (a) ongoing challenges associated with restructuring CIP's governance elements, and (b) CIP's organizational and financial uncertainty which arose because of an inability to agree on a sustainable funding model to support CIP's operations.  At the CIP AGM in Saskatoon, the assembled membership engaged CIP Council in a thorough, extensive and frank dialogue on these challenging matters.  The following Motion was passed at the AGM on June 29, 2015:  That the membership inform Council that they reject the outgoing Council's position in their last-minute communiqué, and direct Council to work with the members and affiliates to reinvigorate CIP as a national organization.  A further, positive outcome of the AGM is that a Task Force, co-chaired by CIP members Jennifer Keesmaat MCIP RPP and Kelley Moore MCIP RPP, has been created to advise Council about how to renew our national organization. CIP Council and the newly struck Task Force will undertake further communication, meaningful engagement and extensive discussion with CIP's membership throughout this process.  I wish to emphasize that no substantial change to CIP can be undertaken without a vote by CIP's national membership.  In closing, please note that CIP continues to operate and the MCIP designation remains in effect. I wish to thank the previous Council for its hard work over the course of a very challenging year.  I look forward to working with the new Council as we work to renew the Institute.  Sincerely,  Hazel Christy MCIP, RPP President"

Also, there are numerous people who have done all sorts of valuable research and analysis on cities that has never gotten mainstream recognition, and can form the foundation for better urban policymaking.  Don't you want better policymaking that can help your affordability goals (and presumably those of your city)?  I'm suggesting that there are more answers out there than we typically think.

Drunk driving will cost you your licence. Buses and trains run all night in many cases, and on big drinking days like Karneval (Mardi Gras) they run extra service and advertise heavily.

urbanplanning,3bfkfx,ThePlanckConstant,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:49:45 2015 UTC,I've only visited Hong Kong for a few days but I found I could frequently cut through malls or office buildings that were air conditioned.

urbanplanning,3bfkfx,Gnarmac,22,Mon Jun 29 18:17:26 2015 UTC,"I dunno, Istanbul is like 80s and super humid in the summer and 60% of people there walk for life. only 20% even have cars.   Chicago is cold as fuck in the winter, and tons of people still walk there. Boston has one of the country's highest walk rates, and it too is cold as fuck and snowy in the winter. It's just well designed.   Chicago is also hot as fuck in the summer and at times VERY humid, but people there love it.   I know Houston has less people than Chicago and 1/3 of the population density, so that is why I'd assume walkability is total shit there, Dallas isn't much better. I assume Ft. Worth is the same... I looked it up, it has like 1/5th the population density of Chicago. It's 100 square miles bigger and 2 million people less. I have no doubt that is why no one walks there. The weather is a none-issue. You'd all have cheaper cooling bills too if you didn't live so spread out."
urbanplanning,3bfkfx,alexfrancisburchard,21,Sun Jun 28 21:55:20 2015 UTC,"Traditional ""desert"" cities built in hot, humid places like Houston would have been designed very differently.   For a start buildings are clustered close together, giving full shade to streets between them. Busier/wealthier streets often have water fountains, or covering over the top of them. This further reduces heat.  Most buildings are painted light colours, white (although colouring wasn't so affordable back then) is popular in these places - it brings less intense light to lower levels and reflects most of the cities heat.  Worth noting that most walking is done in mornings/evenings, whereas at central times people will be inside eating, working or sleeping (in some places). This helps as in the mornings/evenings the sun is much less intense.  Edit: Also a lot of these places ""design out"" a need for A/C. Although it would still probably be used in hotter areas, I'd imagine cooling bills would be significantly reduced."
urbanplanning,3bfkfx,bbqroast,6,Sun Jun 28 23:17:37 2015 UTC,"And it would reduce electricity consumption, meaning less CO2 production, meaning less climate change, meaning a lower overall increase in temperature in the future."

On the flipside, here in Southern California, where the weather is essentially perfect year round, the cities are significantly less walkable. All this makes me think that the primary factor is simply just when these cities were built."
urbanplanning,3bfkfx,indonigger,3,Sun Jun 28 23:36:59 2015 UTC,"Bingo. Older hot-climate cities were generally built to suit the need for walking, often with an emphasis on evening and morning activity.  Newer cities are built for driving from one air-conditioned pod to another."
urbanplanning,3bfkfx,Splenda,8,Wed Jul 1 21:42:54 2015 UTC,Probably one of the most beloved features of Minneapolis and St. Paul is their system of elevated skyways that allow you to park your car in a multilevel garage and walk maybe 50 feet over dry ground to a climate controlled corridor. You can get the rest of the way across either city's cbd on foot. The same street layout works for walk ability in the summer.
urbanplanning,3bfkfx,incredulitor,8,Sun Jun 28 21:20:33 2015 UTC,"In order to create walkability, there must be density. In many US cities the density does not exist to allow for pedestrian trip generation. This causes residents to travel by car instead of by bike or on foot. There is increasing demand for walkability in urban areas. This is evidenced by the increase in density in cities like Seattle that practice Urban Village development. Urban Villages increase self containment, therefore increasing pedestrian and bicycle traffic. If Urban Village development was practiced in other cities across the US, the demand for walkability would increase despite the rise in temperature that will likely come with climate change due to the increased convenience."

urbanplanning,3bfkfx,Franksss,5,Mon Jun 29 10:49:02 2015 UTC,"One aspect of climate that I feel is quite important in urban planning terms, is what to do about snow.  if you live in a climate where the snow piles can be 6 feet high, places to put those snow piles become valuable.  Boulevard areas that are just ugly weedy grass by the curb ( weedy because the road salt kills the grass) in summer, are snow storage areas in winter.  Some places where people would normally be able to walk become temporary snow storage areas, making it more difficult to get about.  I remember one time deciding to try to take the normal desire line shortcut home from the bus stop one winter and getting stuck in a field of snow 3 feet thick.  the normal snow had been covered in a layer of heavy snow from the snowplow,  making it just the right consistency to not support my weight yet be impossible to plow through."

Plenty of walking can be done there and the climate is identical. I've never heard anyone say they didn't want to go to New Orleans for the weekend because they would have to walk.   In this heat, you will sweat. You just wake up in the morning knowing it and dress for it.   The reason I pick New Orleans is because of the age of the city as compared to Houston and Dallas. The growth in New Orleans happened way before those two cities, also before the automobile. It should be no surprise that Houston and Dallas are not walking cities. After all, where has most of the money in Houston and Dallas come from? Couple huge oil industry with plenty of cheap gas and cars and mid-1900s American growth and you really loose the need for walkability.   Driving is much more convenient in that heat though. No one wants to go to work soaked in sweat."

Higher market rates mean more people need affordable housing. Getting more affordable housing means market rates need to be hiked even more. Or you're left with a middle class that can't afford market rate housing but doesn't qualify for affordable housing either.  The only way out is to break the cycle and bring entry-level market rates down. This means uncomfortable amounts of development at uncomfortably low standards.
urbanplanning,3b82px,hylje,14,Fri Jun 26 20:58:17 2015 UTC,"Glasgow and Vienna figured out how to provide affordable housing to everyone in the 1920s. It requires commitment to social housing, to the point that the middle class (people with college professor salaries, more or less) can qualify. Through differential rents and non-profit renting, these residents subsidize the rents of those who can pay less, thus preventing the cycle of residualization and degeneration that has characterized social housing in many countries since the 1980s."

There's no free lunch: the ownership model will affect social issues, not money issues. The building will cost the same regardless of how it's organized.

In Chicagoland you would be hard-pressed to land a position over someone with similar/better grades from a Masters Program with better/more experience, and there's lots up here.  That being said, if you wanted to work in a rural setting they are always looking for smart, qualified people. Cruise job boards on Planetizen and APA and see what's available in a rural or small-town setting. Once you get more experience, you can go wherever you'd like really.   I have a grad school buddy who had the same degree as you from UIUC, came back to Chicago and realized he had to go to grad school to get a job he wanted in this area.

urbanplanning,3azrre,genericcommonwords,25,Wed Jun 24 20:35:37 2015 UTC,"Having lived in Toronto before, the response is unsurprising - Toronto is an urban city populated almost exclusively by suburbanites. The lifecycle of the Torontonian is to grow up in one of the far-flung car-clogged suburbs, live downtown in an apartment for part of their 20s, and then go back out to the suburbs to have children and clog the streets up with more cars.  There are precious few life-long urbanists in that city.   She was a spoiled and arrogant NIMBY princess, who opposed everything from the PATH (she thought shopping above ground, in the winter, was more virtuous)   For non-Torontonians: the PATH is a system of underground malls and connecting spaces that span a large part of Toronto's Central Business District. It connects office towers directly to subway stations without having to walk outside (Toronto winters are extremely bitter cold), and was intended to be a vibrant commercial and communal space underground, above and beyond its use as simple utilitarian tunnels. It's been described as an ""Underground City"".  The PATH was, and still is, a bad idea. It is tolerable during weekday working hours because of the incidental foot traffic from local office workers, but is completely deserted (to the point that almost all of its shops are closed outside of core office hours) at all other times. This has created a safety problem that, surprise, Jane Jacobs predicted indirectly in her many, many words written about the incidental safety provided by sidewalks.  The protection it grants from harsh Torontonian winters is very valuable, but as an urban space it's an utter failure. It is not much more pleasant, nor much more useful, than simple underground tunnels between buildings.   The sentiment she seems to be attempting, poorly, to convey is that cities should be managed with egalitarian principles.   No, she never conveyed that at all. What she conveyed would - in today's political climate - probably be better described as a type of urban libertarianism. She was fighting against vast, centrally-planned development in favor of letting neighborhoods grow organically. Which is to say, a grocery store would open wherever there was demand, a barber would open wherever he was needed, instead of the Radiant City model of having the central planner choose where amenities go. The idea is that people who live and work in a place are better qualified to determine where their amenities and businesses should go than an urban planner who is largely disconnected from the reality on the ground.  What a dumb, but typically Torontonian response to urbanism."

Feminism, and being a ""feminist"", is related to a movement with a long history, and to label a cause as feminist is simply giving it more specificity. The error is that they've created a false dilemma: if you're egalitarian, you almost certainly are a feminist, and there's no reason to shirk one label over the other.  It's less like your car example, and more like saying ""I wouldn't say I like lasagna, I'd say I like pasta"", which itself implies that you don't like lasagna. It's fair to say that you generally like pasta but have no special regard for lasagna, but the statements I'm criticising are the ones that would falsely equate baking a lasagna with being anti-macaroni."

The idea is that equality is achieved by being totally gender-blind, race-blind, class-blind and what have you.  Which of course, doesn't at all work. The wealth gap won't fix itself magically by treating all people exactly the same - because it exists already, and if we want to achieve actual equality some work will have to be done to undo the present situation. Ditto gender and race issues.  Egalitarianism is, like all political words, fraught with meaning.

It's dishonest and asserts a privileged ""-blindness"" that doesn't do anything to advance the discussion.

Perhaps I misunderstand the language I'm using, I've never been a master with words.   Are you suggesting that those who benefitted from an unbalanced system in the past owe something to those who where disadvantaged from that same system and therefore should be punished?

Is it not best to bring everyone up to the same level than push some down?    This is a common misunderstanding. Yes, those who benefitted from a discriminatory system in the past owe something to those who were disadvantage from the same system.  No 'punishment' necessary, though - it's not about 'special rights' for some, or 'punishing' others - it is more about correcting historical imbalances by recognizing context/history and elevating disadvantaged peoples up to a higher level.

It is a great asset.

Ford was an expert at exploiting first-past-the-post and turning the city against itself, but I think people in the suburbs suffered the most from his political games.  What everyone needs to understand about Ford-era Toronto, is that this wasn't some disagreement over political ideology. I was really upset during the height of the crack-scandal that the rest of the world was hearing this narrative that Ford was some kind of fiscally-responsible mayor who cut social programs but saved the city money. He cost the city money, and he was dangerously incompetent. He can't even do basic arithmetic. I don't mean that I don't like his numbers or he made a projection that was unrealistic: he literally cannot perform simple addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

It sounds bad denying folks living in less denser areas door to door public transit, but this country is aging. Every year there will be more and more old folks living out in sprawling suburbs. We'll go bankrupt trying to provide taxi services for all of them."

urbanplanning,3aw91p,somethingratherother,7,Wed Jun 24 11:31:07 2015 UTC,"Suburbia is what most seniors have lived in their entire lives (at least since the 50's). Living in a city is a huge life change. What we need is to make suburbs more walkable, and that doesn't mean just building sidewalks and crosswalks. Neighborhoods (and I define a neighborhood as a tight-knit area, maybe 2-mile radius) need inviting, walkable downtowns that make the ""useful walk"" possible. One can't even walk to a grocery store in a lot of suburban towns, imagine trying it when you walk slower and you don't have as much stamina. It's also depressing as hell to need to walk miles in such a hostile environment (4 lanes of cars zipping past you as you walk on a barren 5-foot sidewalk).  The neighborhood I live in (Walkscore=90) has most things you could possibly need within a 10-minute walk - groceries, a butcher shop, a Dunkin Donuts, other cafes, numerous restaurants, a dry cleaner, a doctor's office, dentists offices, you name it), not to mention no less than 6 bus lines and a rapid transit station, and we have a corner store less than a 5 minute walk from my house that has lunch meat, milk/eggs/etc, beer and wine, etc. I could live until I was 80 in that neighborhood and never ever need to drive. This needs to exist everywhere. Having these conveniences close to your house is something anyone could get on board with.  EDIT: I do live in a city  (Somerville, MA - the most densely populated city in New England), but it's a city with <100,000 people and most residences are triple deckers, not tall apartment buildings. It is a suburb of Boston on between crazy Cambridge and more suburb-y Arlington.  Suburbs that emulated Somerville could still maintain their quiet, suburban charm; zoning changes to allow for neighborhood stores is really not that difficult or groundbreaking."

I think you don't understand what true suburbia is like. This is the neighborhood my parents live in. Everyone is technically within two miles of either CVS or Walgreens, and either Starbucks or the other cafe, and I believe there may be a restaurant near each commercial spot too.  Allowing neighborhood stores within the residential areas would not work, because there's not enough people within walking distance of any store to support it. Converting some of these single-family homes to triple-deckers would be seen as a frontal assault on the suburban nature of the area that these people have been living with.  I totally agree with you that there should be Somerville everywhere. But I think many of the people who live in these sorts of massive single-family developments would see conversion to Somerville as the absolute destruction of the ""quiet, suburban charm"" that they live in."

If there's only 1000 households living within a 20 minute walk of the store, and most of them already do most of their shopping at big box stores and mega-supermarkets, then most of them are going to come by at most once a month or so, which only gets you a couple dozen potential customers a day.

urbanplanning,3aw91p,traal,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:26:05 2015 UTC,"That's possible, but it will take some re-learning of habits, since most modern suburbanites are used to having a big fridge and buying vegetables once a week from the grocery store, rather than buying them fresh every day.  And from the storekeeper's perspective, if you're stocking fresh vegetables every day, you need to have a good sense of what vegetables will sell each day, which either means that you need a small number of customers with very regular habits, or a large enough number of customers for statistical regularities to kick in."
urbanplanning,3aw91p,easwaran,2,Thu Jun 25 13:56:03 2015 UTC,Triple deckers are incredibly urban. Most cities are so spread out that upgrading their built-up areas into reasonably well packed triple deckers would fit millions of residents.

Sort of. The point of a transportation system isn't to make every single place easily connected and accessible to every single other place. It's no complaint about our transportation system that there's no easy way to get from Death Valley to the North Pole.  The problem is that some land use patterns are much easier to serve than others. We ask that a transportation system serve the most common trips well. The problem is that with a very dispersed low-density suburban development pattern, no trip is very common, so none of them can be served well by any means other than private automobile ownership and use.  You can't blame a transportation system for not doing the impossible. You have to at least partly blame the land use system for making it impossible to serve. (Though obviously at this point, the land use problem is so bad that we have to figure out ways to try to use every other policy at our disposal to mitigate the problems it's caused, which includes trying to ask our transportation system to do some of the impossible.)  Also, the ""motivations"" for living where they do are in large part based on historic subsidies that are either drying up, or are no help when you can no longer drive a car."
urbanplanning,3aw91p,easwaran,3,Wed Jun 24 14:58:34 2015 UTC,"Yes I'm completely blaming them. Nobody asked them to move out into completely automobile dependent suburbs. Transportation systems cannot and should not be built like that. Imagine if the density was one person per mile. Should taxpayers fund a ludicrously expensive system for those people to have public transit? No! Things have to be feasible. And in order for public transit to be feasible there needs to be density. Something the people off that generation balked at when they made the choice to live out in the suburbs. Now they can either choose to move back into the city, or support rezoning of their suburbs. But they don't want to do either. They want us to fund a massively loss making public transit system for their comfort. These are the same people who will fight tooth and nail against denser rezoning and also against raising taxes. Yet they want us to use the little tax money we have to give them a world class transit system?"

But they're totally car-dependant.  One of their neighbors was recently badly injured in a collision- she was still driving at 90 years old.    Even simply building sidewalks in such a low-density area would be hugely expensive, and if you raise property taxes people who can afford to move will leave.

All that has to happen is a developer builds a new structure a block away. Land value taxes minimize this effect.   Overproducing keeps prices low, meaning rents are kept low. I'm an opponent of ""projects"" because I feel that they end up just making things worse. A healthy neighborhood requires a high density mixture of income classes.  Lastly, too much zoning can prevent high density development. Minimal zoning would allow developers to have more breathing room in what can be built, as well as allowing construction to proceed faster. Coupling this with the other things is what can fight the negative aspects of gentrification."

Knowing what I do now I would have done surveying, or even a trade and worked on building up a business around it. Having a degree I might not get to use is nearly heart breaking. Hindsight is a bitch."
urbanplanning,3au6bj,jun815,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:46:52 2015 UTC,"I found work with a Political Econ/Planning minor fairly easily. The trick for me was to not target only the ""Planner I"" or Junior Planner positions, but rather some more generic sounding positions that would benefit from my (sparse) planning knowledge. For example, my title is ""Research Analyst"" within the code compliance department of a large city. Super generic title, but what I do is mostly GIS work, demographic surveys, neighborhood planning and policy recommendations, and some HTML/CSS/JS and database management that any ""millennial"" is handed. I did this for about a year, and now I'm headed for an urban planning graduate degree to really focus on development and physical planning. But this job was a great foot in the door.  So my advice would be don't despair! Just don't expect to be a ""planner"" straight out the gate - other positions are as interesting/require similar skills and pay the same or often better!"

urbanplanning,3au6bj,GardenLady2,2,Tue Jun 23 19:16:03 2015 UTC,I am a Senior Planner for a municipal agency for a major US city with only a BA in Urban Studies and Planning from a non-PAB accredited program.  I also have 15-years experience to offset the lack of a Master's Degree and some good connections from former graduates of my degree program.
urbanplanning,3au6bj,GardenLady2,2,Tue Jun 23 23:20:38 2015 UTC,"My best suggestion is  to spend your first year narrowing down what type of urban planning you want to do, then targeting your electives toward that goal. It's big subject, so you need to narrow down. Do you want to be a planner at a small but developing town turning into a city? Do you want to be a mass transit specialist? A highway planner? Drawing legislative districts? Rebuilding inner cities? Containing urban sprawl? Flood management?  The earlier you can gain a focus on what kind of job you want and tailor your courses to that, the more jobs will be available because your resume will look more appealing.  And, a hint: Learn ESRI's ArcGIS computer modelling as soon as you can, preferably in your first year.  It's fun once you learn it, you'll be amazed at the publically available data, and just fooling around with it and looking at other people's work will help you focus your interest.  I say this as someone coming to the end of a career in legislative analysis and a member of the city planning commission in a large town/small city (population 57,000).  So, the more focus the more jobs.  There's a multitude of possible jobs.  Some require a master's, some just require a bachelor's, if it's a concentrated degree."

urbanplanning,3au6bj,marissamnzrs,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:22:55 2015 UTC,"Great! There's some narrowing of your area of interest right there! You mentioned civil engineering, which would indeed make an excellent elective. If your interest is in literally -urban- planning, as in  storm drains, traffic planning, building codes and other urban infrastructure issue, that's one aspect. But urban planning encompasses other areas besides cities themselves. As a few examples:  Urban-rural interface (how a city connects services with surrounding areas); public health (both urban health problems and ""feeder systems"" of small regional clinics to large urban hospitals); regional planning of reservoirs, road systems, environmental policies and conservation; economic and development planning; and I could go on but won't.  For these, especially in developing areas, a bachelor's with a good solid minor is about as good as a master's career-wise.  In South America and Africa both, there's a big push to train and hire people from their home countries, who are familiar with the culture and history of how the area got to be the way it is.  That's because most urban areas in those countries have never really had any urban or regional planning; cities have simply grown up haphazardly with no planning whatsoever.  Most have been bringing in advisors and contractors from the First World, but there's a limit to how useful that can be.  Since foreign consultants don't understand the cultural context, they tend to focus on a specific problem, do their work and leave, often with a lot of hard feelings left behind them.  So, to the point, a minor that compliments your area of interest would be great.  Economics, if you're interested in funding projects; public administration if you want to take a more holistic approach to planning; the civil engineering you mentioned. Another complementary minor you may not have thought of is communications. You're going to have the ""sell"" the general public on your projects, along with government agencies and funders, because every urban development project is also going to be disruptive. Learning to convince people, even people who may be losing their homes to a development project, that the project is in the long term best interest of them and their children, is a talent worth learning.  So, I've talked a lot, so I'll stop here.  Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on scholarships and grants available for home-grown urban planners in developing countries."

urbanplanning,3au7e3,buntze24,15,Tue Jun 23 15:25:03 2015 UTC,"Automated cars could also devalue urban cores by making biking and walking, or waiting for transit, less appealing when a robotized car can arrive practically instantly at the touch of a button.   Ah, the elephant in the room, fleet size and coverage. If a robotized car can arrive ""practically instantly"" that means that a fleet has been deployed that is large enough to be responsive even at peak demand, which means most of this fleet is sitting idle for most of the day, similar to our current situation without automated cars.  This is a problem that any transportation service faces and making it automated won't change the spacial realities of providing service to hundreds of thousands of people over a wide area. Will this service operate to anywhere in the city? Or only the densest (and most profitable) sections? Is the fleet big enough to provide near instant service even at peek commuting times? Then where do you put all those extra cars when they're not needed?  Until an engineer and accountant start answering some hard questions I will remain skeptical of the potential radical impact of autonomous cars."
urbanplanning,3au7e3,cinemabaroque,4,Tue Jun 23 18:40:45 2015 UTC,"Houston as an outlier has an estimated 30 parking spaces for every vehicle in operation. There are lots of places for AVs to sit around idle off-peak, while still eliminating curbside parking which makes room for wider sidewalks and/or bike lanes.   Estimates have suggested an autonomous taxi can take anywhere between 3 and 9 privately owned vehicles off the road while still meeting peak demand. I'm more apt to agree with the conservative estimate, but it's substantial either way.   The average (5 passenger) car has 1.4 occupants, and the average (60 passenger) bus has 9. Cars can also ferry people to their destination in half the time or less. Off peak and away from major transportation corridors busses are vastly overrated.   Busses also do exponentially more damage to roads than smaller personal vehicles, they're noisy and burn deisel. Little electric two-seaters aren't just cheaper, faster, quieter, cleaner and more convenient, they also have a smaller urban footprint.   Surge pricing is an effective way to disincentive riders from using Autonomous taxis during peak demand.   Nonetheless, opening up mobility options for those currently limited, and making mobility cheaper, timelier and less stressful will induce demand, and congestion will still be a problem."
urbanplanning,3au7e3,fricken,3,Tue Jun 23 19:29:02 2015 UTC,"Do estimates for automated vehicle occupancy consider the legs when the automated vehicle travels unattended to its next destination? Say, a private automated car accessing a parking lot away from its rider's destination. Without deep application of ride-sharing, we could be looking at average occupancies of under one person.  I maintain that scheduled transit has much more potential for increasing average occupancy than point-to-point taxis do. Scheduled transit forms corridors that are easy to measure, allowing straightforward direction and incentivizing of development towards unused capacity. Point-to-point taxis form a demand-supply field with no clear direction, making it very difficult to find consistent unused capacity and to come up with development that fills those holes neatly."
urbanplanning,3au7e3,hylje,2,Tue Jun 23 20:28:40 2015 UTC,"I can't answer that driectly, but maybe look at the things Uber is doing to see the state of the art in optimizing those sorts of logistics problems. They collect a lot of data and keep a well compensated team of math wizards on their payroll, and clearly have a vested interest  in minimizing the time their drivers spend idle or driving without a fare. They're branching out into carpooling services and delivery."
urbanplanning,3au7e3,fricken,-1,Tue Jun 23 20:49:35 2015 UTC,"I think it is important to understand that when we talk about autonomous vehicles (AVs) we should seek to throw off the constraints of the current paradigm. AVs really don't need to be cars, and could take any form that suits our needs.  For instance, the ability of AV pods to organize themselves into a road train could be transformative. We could have pods collecting people in the suburbs in the morning peak flows, joining together at a hub outside of the downtown area, and then entering downtown as a train - thereby taking up much less space than an equivalent number of conventional cars. The pods could then possibly disperse to individual destinations if the downtown streets aren't too congested.  If we want people to ride-share then the promotion of policies supporting companies like Uber and its Uberpool service now would go a long way to preparing the path for shared AVs in the near future. If we do have policies that take average vehicle occupancy above 1.2 to around 1.8 then we not only deal with induced demand, but actually reduce the number of vehicles on the road = reduced congestion.  It's all about the policies."

urbanplanning,3au7e3,252003,2,Wed Jun 24 14:31:08 2015 UTC,"I think people will still make simple point-to-point trips via subway or skytrain in cities that have them.  For example, the S-Bahn and U-Bahn are both very convenient when getting around in the area inside the Ringbahn in Berlin.  However, robotaxi will be more convenient than the bus and light rail services that serve North American cities, and likely won't be significantly more expensive, given that there's no need to pay a human driver.  Thus I can't see anybody who has the means of paying for the robotaxi opting for slower means of transport.    I think the main reason why anybody who can afford a car would take public transit now is because they commute downtown, where parking is expensive, or because they'd rather focus on something else other than driving.  Self-driving cars would remove both of these two advantages that public transit has."
urbanplanning,3au7e3,strangewool123,6,Tue Jun 23 18:07:16 2015 UTC,"A self driving car still takes up an absurd amount of space, makes a lot of noise and pollutes a lot more.

urbanplanning,3au7e3,252003,3,Tue Jun 23 21:20:36 2015 UTC,"They could take up far less space than currently though, especially if they are single-seaters or Smartcar-sized (like Car2Go).  It's not a very good solution for a place like Hong Kong, but I can only see it improving the traffic situation in medium density cities.  Also, I don't see why they wouldn't be electric, as roughly half of Car2Go's fleet currently is.    Also, I'm not an urban planner and am not making any statement about what one should or shouldn't focus on.  I'm just making a prediction."
urbanplanning,3au7e3,strangewool123,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:44:12 2015 UTC,"You could make a lot of improvements, but the real problem is interfacing the road with the side of the road.  We could make lanes narrower to account for single-seat self-driving cars - 3 lanes can turn into 6 lanes. We could pack cars more closely together because they're computer-driven, etc etc. All of this will let us put more cars on the road.  What happens when they want to stop?  The dream that autonomous car proponents are trying to sell is leaving the grocery store, having an automatic car pull up right in front, getting in, and getting out in front of your home. All of this supposes a sufficient amount of sidewalk space for everyone to be doing just that, and that traffic merging/splitting from the road to pick up/drop off won't create a gigantic clusterfuck - it most definitely will.  There is a very hard to solve capacity limit to the sidewalk - and that capacity limit is way lower than the limit for cars you can move on the road itself.  Complete point-to-point travel via autonomous cars I suspect will be unrealistic in cities - probably more realistic in rural areas. In actual cities you will need to emulate trains (e.g., instead of picking up/dropping off arbitrarily, you can only get a car from a ""car station"" that has infrastructure for rapidly merging pods into traffic, and/or the cars travel along fixed routes in urban cores to speed them along).  You can keep a very large number of cars moving at high speed with self-driving, so long as no more cars need to join and no cars need to depart the stream. But of course, passengers merging/departing is basically the entire point of any transport system ;)"

urbanplanning,3au7e3,252003,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:51:59 2015 UTC,"I think there's also the question of what will happen when public transit itself becomes self-driving.  Autonomous bus rapid transit could blanket a city and provide headways of around one minute, making it cheaper and just as, if not more, convenient than autonomous cars since the need for labor is eliminated and autonomous vehicles would reduce or eliminate the need for inefficient local bus lines in lower-density areas.  I would almost go as far to guess that autonomous vehicles might work more like Bridj today, but without the drivers.  Autonomous minibuses serving local neighborhood trips and making last-mile connections to suburban commuter hubs where one could catch a self-driving BRT or train to the city center or other suburban commuter hubs.    I'm not sure the self-driving car will be as cheap as most people think they will be.  The future of road funding likely lies in tolling and/or per-mile fees; self-driving vehicles would actually make these a lot easier to implement."

After self-driving cars are commercialized, travelling will become cheaper/easier, more people will be able to move to the suburbs, and those suburbs will increasingly be located a further distance from commercial centers. Large capacity systems like subways will become increasingly less important in a world like that.    As existing skytrains and subways age and require expensive maintenance and overhauls, it's going to become increasingly attractive to instead convert them to convey small, low impact electrically powered self-driving commuter pods rather than large/heavy/slow trains. I expect most mass transit corridors will be converted to something like that (if they are still required at all)."
urbanplanning,3au7e3,Sidewinder77,8,Tue Jun 23 19:49:05 2015 UTC,"After self-driving cars are commercialized, travelling will become cheaper/easier, more people will be able to move to the suburbs, and those suburbs will increasingly be located a further distance from commercial centers.    Do you think most of us who live close in actually harbor some dream of moving to the suburbs?  There's nothing preventing us from doing that NOW with existing technology.  Anybody who wants to live in the suburbs/exurbs can already do so at a far lower price than living close-in.  Those who choose not to live in the burbs are doing so for non-financial reasons, namely because they have a preference for the urban lifestyle.  Housing in the center city is after all far more expensive because demand is completely outstripping supply.  Far more people WANT to live close-in than is currently possible given the existing housing stock.  People like myself live close-in because we like in close walking and biking distance to amenities, nightlife, work, etc and because the suburbs are fucking boring.  The mainstreaming of the self-driving car is unlikely to modify this preference in any way.    Places like Manhattan and inner Berlin are not going to empty out as a result of the self-driving car.  These places are attractive and people are willing to pay more to be there INSTEAD of the suburbs.  If anything, robotaxis will make urban areas more practical to live in than currently, and will likely boost the population.  Services like Uber, Lyft and Car2Go have already made it more practical for and urban dweller like me to not own a car, and robotaxi services, which would be even cheaper than Uber and Lyft, would simply accelerate this phenomenon among other urban residents.  Consequently, the need for street side parking and dedicated parking lots will be reduced.  The parking lots can be converted to apartments/condos (thus boosting urban population), and the removal of street side parking can create space for bike lanes or wider sidewalks."
urbanplanning,3au7e3,strangewool123,2,Tue Jun 23 20:14:02 2015 UTC,"Is it actually cheaper? Let's just look at a daily commute. The IRS's estimated cost of driving is $.51/mile. Let's say you have two choices of residences, one 20 miles further away from work than the other.  20 miles * 2 times a day * $.51 * 5 days a week * 50 weeks a year = $5100  $5100 / 12 months = $425/month more that you have as a direct result of living 20 miles closer to your job.  That doesn't even take into account the fact that going to the grocery store and other errands will require much less driving, if they require driving at all. If you can eliminate the car altogether, that's a huge decrease in costs, even given that driving is much cheaper to the user than its true cost."

urbanplanning,3au7e3,Sidewinder77,-3,Tue Jun 23 23:28:12 2015 UTC,"I think most people that live in crowded downtown cities and have never experienced living in the country have a sort of Stockholm syndrome that it's a desirable thing to live downtown. In reality, it's taxing on your health and undesirable to the majority of people throughout most of their lives. As people get married, they typically are unlikely to want to live high density. Already, the majority of millennials would like to live in the suburbs.  If we all wanted to move to the countryside now we'd have to manually drive many hours which is too much of a barrier to most people. We don't yet have technology to eliminate that reality so most people are forced to live within 10's of miles of commercial centers.  The price of living in high-density steel and concrete skyscrapers is unlikely to fall relative to living in low density structures made of wood. As more area becomes available to construct low density houses, the draw to people that currently live in city centers will grow, and many will leave. We will see a period of de-urbanization as self-driving cars and other emerging technologies like fully immersive virtual reality enable the lower and middle classes to live in small villages, but still work productively in the regional and world economy.  I think you're right that self-driving cars will allow a few ultra dense cities to develop. New York, Berlin, etc make sense. But as they suck in all those people who want to be in such a place, other cities will de-urbanize and shrink in size."
urbanplanning,3au7e3,Sidewinder77,5,Tue Jun 23 21:30:01 2015 UTC,"So 66 percent of Millenials want to live in the suburbs.  Even if true, still leaves 34 percent who don't, which is a significant niche market, even if a minority one.  Steel and glass towers are indeed expensive, but the fact that developers build them and expect to rent or sell the units above cost indicates that the demand exist -- and from folks who obviously have enough money to live wherever the hell they feel like living.  They are purchasing the expensive glass condo because that's what they really want, and not because their dream of living in the exurbs has been denied.  You are also painting a bit of a caricature of urban life by drawing a false distinction between Blade Runner-style towers and single family homes.  To stick with the example of Berlin, there aren't many towers in that city -- most buildings are 5-6 story low rise apartments.  Even less extreme, my own city is full of duplexes, triplexes, townhouses, and garden apartments -- all made of wood and cheap/fast to construct.  Even at full occupancy, neither of these cities feel crowded.  In the early 1900s, when people had eight children, they might have been, but it currently feels pretty roomy to me.  You're using a common rhetorical tactic of painting apartments as rabbit hutches, which is really inaccurate and misleading.  I don't think the self-driving car would be much of a game changer in terms of making people more willing to live further out.  A two hour commute in a car is still a two hour commute in a car, regardless of whether or not you have to pay attention to the road.  It might be better in a self-driving car, but I still think most people would rather do something else."

They have a TAD that is active for the next 20 years or so for bonds to finance the loop trail and transit (or a projected 80 percent of capital outlays) as well as a strategic plan for grants and private philanthropy for the rest of it.   The city recently adopted the above plan into its master plan, and from an economic development and public relationship perspective, the first completed section of the trail has been an unqualified success.

The new stadium will have a 100% auto trip rate.   I also disagree with the notion that having a baseball stadium in a city isn't sensible. Baseball stadiums host 81 games per year, more if there are playoffs. That's roughly 1/4 days of the year of tens of thousands of fans (many of whom have money to spend) entering the area right around dinner time. It's a great seasonal anchor for the neighborhood, though it isn't enough to spark year-round activity. Fenway is located in the heart (well maybe the kidneys) of Boston, and every game fills up restaurants in a half-mile radius. The city is building a lot of housing and offices in the area now to spur year-round, walkable, transit-oriented activity that will hopefully keep those places busy the other 3/4 of the year."

If you get there early, which isn't always even possible for weeknight games, you are going to tailgate because it's cheap, not go to a restaurant and buy $6 beers.  And after the game it's 11:00, and you go home.  I could see going to a restaurant after a day game on a weekend, but those aren't that common.

It will require additional signalization to display signals to the contra-flow bicyclists, and manage bike/car conflicts. This is not cheap. Operation/Safety concerns abound. There are more, and more common conflicts on these two-way facilities than the equivalent one way versions. Lets not hurt people with our designs. You will still have bicyclists wanting to access destinations on the other side of the street, but without any route provided.

They were called Hoovervilles and were symbolic of a failure by the eponymous president at the time.  In other countries this sort of informal urbanism is called a ""slum."" Slums are generally unpleasant places as they lack basic sanitation, utilities, institutional services, healthcare and a formal economy. There are a lot of ways this can play out so it's important to realize that slums are different everywhere. That is to say that the conditions in Dhaka are different from those in Sao Paolo and Manilla, and that each slum could be treated as a phenomenon distinct from the others.  For instance, their lack of access to emergency services and health care mean that in slums (India for example), infant mortality rise to levels as if we had never industrialized (18th century scotland as an example). Additionally, disease is more likely to strike and to kill due to inadequate sanitation and overcrowding. Crime and exploitation and the associated human costs are huge problems in slums  What's more studies have shown that the overall impact of slums on social mobility is negligible if not net negative. This most likely relates to the informal economies that exist in slums. Maybe someone else can take this on, but my understanding is that when people are working in informal conditions, the government cannot collect tax to invest in the community, and working condition suffer in terms of compensation and regulation.  The best solution for the lack of homeless shelters is probably to build homeless shelters. Here's a good example of a modern homeless shelter"

Real BRT is pretty much trams, but that is not what many finished BRT look like.  No, I rather see small scale automated van bus services, connecting to mass transit, in the form of metro and light rail. Something that allow you to ask the van to pick you up, and get a time estimate how soon it can be there, and maybe you have some neighbors in the van when it gets to you."
urbanplanning,3anbtx,hallonlakrits,5,Mon Jun 22 12:37:17 2015 UTC,"Proper BRT should be in grade separated, dedicated lines. It should run exactly like trains, but with 1/10th of the infrastructure and vehicle investment.   That is the point of BRT. It is just a bus that works like light rail.   If you do anything wrong, it will be wrong. I don't see that as an argument against the thing, just an argument against bad implementation.   I do agree that private bus services would be nice to see operate from non-core neighbourhoods. However, if it isn't economically feasible to do it with a driver, it probably isn't feasible with automation either (small scale vans won't reach economies of scale that BRT would). I've always thought that funding in the form of an offsite levy for transit should be a requirement for all greenfield developments. If they don't pay, they don't get service."
urbanplanning,3anbtx,J__rad,4,Mon Jun 22 12:40:47 2015 UTC,"I think the problem with the BRT vs Light Rail argument is people think of it as the cheap option vs the high quality option. With nearly every proposal I've seen in western countries, if BRT is chosen the government will keep asking ""What can we cut to make this cheaper?"" (dedicated lanes, high quality stations) whereas with Light Rail it is always ""How can we maximise ridership?""  BRT only works when people don't just consider it the cheap option and instead try to still make it a high quality service.  In my town Perth, Australia the government have been pushing Light Rail for the last 5-10 years, however they now can't afford to build it. BRT could do an amazing job for less money, however everyone is opposing it because they know the government will keep cutting things out and the service will end up being much poorer than Light Rail would be. Even in their announcement when they said they wanted to look at BRT they chose to use Las Vegas as an example of a world class system - which it definitely isn't"

A lot of train stations found at the outskirts of towns could become a lot more viable with cheap taxis to take you the last step.   I'm no expert in these things but in America it seems like you guys have a much larger problem with transport just because of the size of your cities. Geographically they're a lot more spread out but if hubs had automated taxis they could have a much larger sphere of influence making them cheaper per passenger.   It would be interesting to see what the price of automated taxis is predicted to be. I would be very tempted to take a taxi from a train station if it was a competitive price.
urbanplanning,3anbtx,moolah_dollar_cash,7,Mon Jun 22 00:23:19 2015 UTC,"I gotta disagree. We should be focusing on encouraging public transportation a better option for in-town transportation. Intercity rail, as much as I love it, isn't nearly as important as local city transit. Building train stations at the ""outskirts"" of town and connecting them to destinations around town with cars works against the objective of building sustainable cities."
urbanplanning,3anbtx,trainmaster611,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:02:47 2015 UTC,"I agree that local city transit is key to people's daily lives, but I don't think that makes it more important that intercity rail.  I think that people need ways to get almost anywhere they need to go, or they revert to the ""see, this is why I need my OWN car"" argument, especially in areas like the Northeast Corridor where cities are close and multi-city days are common."
urbanplanning,3anbtx,tomyownrhythm,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:07:49 2015 UTC,I'm definitely not saying that we should build new train stations at the edge of town and rely on taxis to take car of the rest! That's rubbish urban planning but it's rubbish urban planning that many towns have to live with because of the way their cities have grown.   We should definitely be aiming to take as many people to their destination by efficient public transport but as it stands many people take cars because their starting point is low density and their destination is low density.   Even if both ends were a 20 minute walk from a train station with an hourly bus service to take them to the door (a reality of where public transport in many places is today) I would say most people would take a car if they could. But cheap taxis might give enough incentive to these people to get on trains or buses again!
urbanplanning,3anbtx,moolah_dollar_cash,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:36:42 2015 UTC,I think I know what you're saying. So like the Route 128 or New Carrollton Amtrak stations?
urbanplanning,3anbtx,trainmaster611,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:40:24 2015 UTC,Sounds interesting but I'm not sure what you mean. I tried googling them but I don't feel very enlightened!
urbanplanning,3anbtx,moolah_dollar_cash,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:33:53 2015 UTC,New Carrollton is a park & ride Amtrak stop on the NEC in suburban Washington in Maryland and Route 128 is a major park & ride suburban station on the NEC just south of Boston where it passes under Route 128 which is the primary suburban loop freeway in Boston connecting most of the major suburbs. The idea behind both of these stations is that suburbanites can just drive to these stations and catch an Amtrak train along the NEC instead of making a trip all the way to downtown DC or downtown Boston to take the train. It seems similar in concept to that you were talking about but with people being dropped off instead of parking.
urbanplanning,3anbtx,trainmaster611,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:43:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah exactly I also think that getting dropped off has some key advantages over parking as well, boosting sites like the ones you're talking about potential."

urbanplanning,3anbtx,lllama,3,Mon Jun 22 07:56:49 2015 UTC,"Automated busses and other public transit are a very exciting proposition. Automated taxis are really not important, and we should not encourage them.   The huge buzz around automated taxis and personal vehicles ignores the fact that even when automated, these forms of transportation are incredibly inefficient and require massive infrastructure that destroys the urban fabric of cities.  We need to transition away from road-centric design. One of the cheapest ways to do this is separated bus rapid transit, and the prospect of automation makes this even more attractive."
urbanplanning,3anbtx,J__rad,3,Mon Jun 22 12:14:27 2015 UTC,"Taxis in general are very important for convincing people that they don't need to own a personal car. If there are a few trips a month that a person needs a car for, then a lot of people think that they must own a car regardless. And once someone owns a car, they'll use it for a lot of trips that would work fine without a car. But if someone can use a taxi for those few trips a month, then they often won't buy a car in the first place, which then cuts down a huge number of car trips (probably more than will be replaced by taxi usage, because taxi usage actually does charge per trip, while using a car you already own feels a lot cheaper per trip).  Automated taxis make this process much easier."
urbanplanning,3am7xp,victornielsendane,8,Sun Jun 21 16:31:19 2015 UTC,"I think people need to realise that a dense city is not a very meaningful term without further nuancing. What you want is public life, liveability and quality of public spaces. Copenhagen, Amsterdam, Paris and Barcelona have traditionally been very good at mixing density with these aspects. A city like Seattle for example is relatively dense in the core but only just realising the need for these things, which is why people have traditionally sought the fringes of the city instead of the core.  As such, density is not really the determining factor for liveability here. A built environment that allows for public life is the key here. This is why many cities are focusing on less auto-oriented transportation systems since it takes up too much space for infrastructure and parking that could be used for other functions.  edit: words"

Some would prefer to hermit in a remote forest by the mountains instead, carving out their own paths in unmolested nature.  The main thing is, it doesn't matter that much. It's not a matter of life and death, of public safety. People can live long and fulfilling lives in a hyperurban hive city. There's no real reason to stop people from stuffing themselves in there. Besides the fact that no city out there is very intensely urban, most barely qualify as urban at all beyond a tiny core.  People speaking against urban density seem to be operate on the idea that they would be forced to endure that urban density, with no option to move out if the city changes beyond their sensibilities. Or maybe they want everything to stay the same forever. These are unreasonable stances at best, authoritarian at worst: dictating to others what is the Right Way To Live, or the highway."

There's a bus/train station a mile away and groceries and things I need to live are within a mile as well. Plenty of places can have houses where there's enough around them that there is little need to drive.

The domestication of horses was great for the economy also, but eventually something better came along. Technology increases the GDP. It's not as simple as just saying it's consumerism. The modern economy is reliant on transportation, but not the car. In fact, the personal car has increased the GDP of certain companies (have a look at the most valuable companies in the world list.... oil, gas, auto). In reality the money could be better distributed if it went to local vendors on a city block than to the oil company bank in Houston. That's not to say there aren't several small businesses being supported by these companies, but that a diversion of funds to the new age of transportation (and possible avoidance thereof) could be better for your neighborhood GDP and slightly worse for your country. I sound like a 1% broken record, but those executives of those companies are the 1%. So ask them which economy they are referring too.

If we didn't have cars, it's not like we wouldn't be able to commute to work; we'd live closer and commute to work some other way, and spend that money on something else more productive. Cars suck away money that could be spent on something else. (Unless you are a Saudi oil barron, in which case cars have been great for you.)  Now, that said, trucks are indispensable to the economy.

In fact, the real problem is quite the opposite: Vancouver's NIMBY's are doing their hardest to take the city the way of San Francisco, and as such, most of the city proper is still zoned for single family residential.  I'm not saying there isn't a problem with housing in Vancouver - there very much is, but claiming that the city is overcrowded is ridiculous. The problem is, some people insist on having their one acre with lush green lawns, and they expect to have it in downtown and they don't realise that it doesn't work that way.   Most people in Vancouver would be perfectly happy living in an apartment. Rent in Vancouver is actually not that crazy. We have a lack of medium size units like townhomes, 3 bedroom apartments, duplexes, etc.  Extra: Vancouver Zoning Map warning: massive PDF  Everything in light blue is single family homes. Everything in light yellow is duplexes and such. Only orange zones and some of the dark blue zones are actually denser housing."

As the report states in its summary:   Core Values: Why American Companies are Moving Downtown examines the characteristics, motives, and preferences of companies that have either relocated, opened new offices, or expanded in walkable downtowns between 2010 and 2015. Smart Growth America partnered with global real estate advisors Cushman & Wakefield to identify nearly 500 companies that have made such a move in the past five years.   (emphasis mine)  So it's really no surprise that further statements read like this:   The average Walk Score of companies’ previous locations was 51; the average Walk Score of the companies’ new locations is 88.   Well of course! It would really be something if that were the typical walk score increase for all companies moving, but this is among the certain 500 companies profiled. Those numbers by themselves don't really indicate the trend implied by the title of the report.

urbanplanning,3ajjni,hylje,0,Sun Jun 21 15:43:46 2015 UTC,What is the standard urban planning formula for how many people can you have per land land area for each lane of accessible freeway artery?
urbanplanning,3ajjni,hylje,6,Sun Jun 21 16:12:18 2015 UTC,"Trick question. Freeway arteries are not the bottlenecks, but the streets that you can access through it are.   These mixed-traffic streets don't take a lot of crossing traffic to become congested. I'm not an engineer with a convenient book of facts to cite, but you're looking at what resembles a sleepy rural town."
urbanplanning,3ajjni,hylje,-1,Sun Jun 21 16:33:46 2015 UTC,People are very interested in unencumbered freeway travel that gets them to their destination faster. The fatal flaw of mass transit is that travel time is too slow.   Urban planners shouldn't have to be traffic engineers to roughly estimate the transportation capacity of their city based on the amount of roads present. Are you saying you have no idea? Does anyone in the profession even look at this?
urbanplanning,3ajjni,URBAN_PLANNER,3,Sun Jun 21 17:01:25 2015 UTC,"Transit is only fatally slow in spread-out, low-density environments. If you plan the environment around a no-congestion paradigm for cars, that's what you get. Huge arterials take a lot of space from everything else.  In a high-density, clustered environment, transit is plenty quick. While car traffic is fatally congested. That is a direct consequence of density, and the only way to avoid it is to limit density.   Are you saying you have no idea? Does anyone in the profession even look at this?   Rated capacities for different roads and intersections are in books of facts, yes. You can use the books to design a city for a particular capacity of traffic.  But you can't predict how much traffic actually shows up without massive margins of error. Traffic is a large and dynamic system that traffic engineers struggle to control. The primary dynamic feedback loop that controls traffic is congestion."
urbanplanning,3ajjni,alexfrancisburchard,3,Sun Jun 21 17:36:59 2015 UTC,"Your answer is 2.5 dwelling units per acre.  I think your premise is flawed, but I'll play. There is no master lookup table for this, and it's far more complicated than you seem to think it is. I've put the numbers below in terms of dwelling units per acre but the density and distribution of jobs/destinations matters too.  2.5 du/acre is the point where auto dependency starts to reduce significantly. This indicates that at densities higher this something about auto-use begins to be less appealing and other travel modes become competitive to at least part of the population.    At 5-15 du/acre, transit services starts to become functional for an important percentage of the population. This density is common in traditional American ""Streetcar Suburbs"" built up to the 1920s.    11-25 du/acre is where light rail based systems operate at a functinal capacity, depending on costs.    If you want freeways to work, you need is a low density of both housing and jobs/destinations. And not only low density, but an even distribution of locations so that no one place is too popular. If one place becomes too attractive, you end up with lots of people trying to get there at the same time. This will lead to congestion.  It would be fun to do the math, but I suspect the density limits you'd need to stay below wouldn't be able to financially pay for the infrastructure you demand."

A clear motorway lane offers 2,000 cars per hour of capacity. Given an average loading of 1.25 = 2,500 people/hr.   Except, the second something blocks capacities drop towards 0.  No matter how much roading you have moving a single percent of the population a significant distance per hour is a massive feat.  London is of a similar population, yet the London Underground alone (which is part of a system including the Overground, DLR and Network Rail systems) moves 3+ million people per day on average.   Salt in the wound? As far as I'm aware Crossrail will be the first new line since before Britain's first motorway.

urbanplanning,3acevt,DavidPuddy666,2,Fri Jun 19 16:17:29 2015 UTC,"a.) Funny! And...  b.) Sort of true: user behavior responds to the capacity of transportation networks, where congestion (as /u/bbqroast sort of gets at below) is an equilibrium state. Otherwise, we have triple convergence: spatial (changing routes during peak hours) time (traveling during off-peak hours) and modal convergence, which we are seeing here. As the road network (as a whole) approaches capacity and ""peak hours"" get longer, only the last user response- mode shift- solves the problem of getting from A to B.  So VMT per capita is dropping, though I will guess that VMT overall remains close to the same as the city's population grows. If we wanted to be really nerdy about your statement, we could say ""nobody new drives in LA, as the road network can't accommodate additional trips by car."""

That is the core part of it, yes. It is much easier to motivate people to move from bad areas to good areas than in reverse.   The reverse, gentrification, will likely intensify and spread out as it gets harder to escape mixed-demographic areas. But that's a much slower process. I don't think it can be forced, either.

urbanplanning,3ab7me,hylje,3,Thu Jun 18 22:55:19 2015 UTC,"The Japanese have a good zoning system IMO.  There's only about 12 types of zoning across the entire country. This means that zones must be very inclusive, not ultra-specific.  Basically you have heavy industrial, the most exclusive, which is only factories and such, but the rest are all multi.  ""Light residential"" allows single family homes, as well as small MDUs (eg 1 or 2 story apartment blocks). In addition small stores, schools and little offices can be constructed within this zone.   Then you move up the scale. Several zones up you have ""mid rise residential"" which allows small apartment buildings as well as offices, stores and hotels.   Quasi-residential is more than half way up the scale, and is the first zone to offer ""vehicle facilities"". That's right, more than half of Japanese zones are not vehicle orientated, so sensible right?  Then you start moving into neighbourhood commercial and higher density areas, these allow small factories (think quiet, low pollution manufacturing) and pretty much every other type of building.  Limits such as height done by measures such as how much sunlight neighbouring properties receive, not random, arbitrary numbers that ""were always there"". In addition, limits such as building coverage (of land area) and total floor area are set as ratios of land area. Eg you're allowed to build a building 120% of your land area, covering 60% of your plot.  Key Points:  Urban design should be ultra inclusive, and minimize exclusion of types of building.   Homes, stores, hotels and even light industry can all coexist peacefully. Smaller roads means less car usage, less upkeep expense and more walk ability (even if road and pavement are combined!) Allowing subdivision, MDUs, etc dramatically elasticizes housing supply. People can quickly devote land they actually don't use (most people where I live don't use their gardens).  Rules for land usage should be very simply, to minimize administrative overhead. Ratios of land area are easy to set and understand for all parties.  House prices needn't be more expensive in desirable areas, we just induce this by legally requiring minimum sizes. More central housing might cost twice as much (/sq m) but half the home area is more practical (because you have access to many shared resources around you)."

Personally, I continue to think we're way off in the way that we're thinking about affordable housing in America. I see the lack of affordable housing as a combination of widespread arbitrary exclusionary zoning like hylje notes, and also really awful property tax policy in America. Building taxes are artificially raising the cost of living versus the actual value of living in too many places, creating an overpriced surplus of existing properties and no demand for new properties, except at the high end in certain areas. I agree that we focus too much on that weird high end 1% and ignore the other 99% of the real estate market at our peril, but I believe that's partly because developers and NIMBY neighbors are hyper-focused there too."

If you wildly undervalued your own property you would have no one to blame but yourself if a competitor came along and offered the local government a decent profit to flip the property( Buy it  from the current owner at their self assessed price and then immediately sell it at a higher price to the competitor).

For example, say you have a Lowes at a prime corner just outside of a small town,  how much is HomeDepot going to bid for a spot kitty corner from that location?  Not much.  However if they could take over the store location from Lowes, that would be significantly more valuable to HomeDepot as not only would they have a big box plus parking lot fit for their purpose, but they would also not be faced with competition from a direct competitor across the intersection. What HomeDepot would pay to take over that store location from Lowes is the minimum property value Lowes would self assess."

Two small centers have more overhead costs but are easier to keep everything else small through activism and involvement. If people don't care about size and spending, then wtf. They probably want to keep the people who want to leave tied up under their elective power to get benefits. Shame!  Not saying you are complaining. Thank you for introducing me to that.

Municipalities need to be able to increase property taxes on vacant properties in the core. It is the only way to combat it.  As a side note, one major retail street in my city had this issue, but for a different reason. There was a certain unscrupulous property owner who decided he wanted more liquor licenses given out (the street is already a major ""drinktainment"" area), and the city said no to protect the unique vibe of the street.  His answer was to jack up rents extremely high, price out all the small business owners in his buildings, and leave the places as vacant holes on the street - boarded up windows and all. He wagered that the city would rather release more licenses than allow the street to decay.  Currently still have several CRUs vacant because of this.

Historic Tax Credits - allowing Buffalo's treasure troves of dilapidated and abandoned historic to be renovated and restored on the cheap. Probably the single most important thing that has really made the city nice in the past 10 years all around.   Then you have the other ""Buffalo Billion"" Projects:   Empire Effects being attracted to town and partnered with Daemen College, helping to boost Buffalo's post-production film industry. 43 North Startup Competition - with $5 million in prizes this is the world's largest startup competition IBM's new Center for Computational Research - being outfitted downtown, 500 jobs and an unknown amount of future spin off. EWI's Advanced Manufacturing Institute - pairing industries with research facilities that they otherwise would not being able to afford. Workforce Training Center - Key to train Buffalo's large amount of people in poverty.   Then you have programs like Startup New York with Buffalo by far leading the State in new jobs and investments. Almost half the projected jobs and investment are in Buffalo. This includes Bak USA which is America's first tablet manufacturing plant and will employ 100 once fully operational, as well as Liazon which is projected to hire 500.

I'm tired of everything being about gentrification.  The fact is, urban centers are becoming more desirable as the economy becomes less industrial and more service/tech/creative driven.

The problem, if I might summarize /u/jts5009, is that people place different values on their time. ""Gentrification"" is not a problem if wages + inflation >= increase in rent or property taxes. As the 'rent gap' grows, however, justifiably frustrated people vent and blame those who move in to 'their' neighborhood. As planners, we have to understand the dynamic that:  a. cities are breathing, albeit quasi-inorganic elements  b. some people have a choice about where they live and others regress from the ultimate freedom via economic indicators (wages being the biggest, but there's also others)   and c. policy continues to focus development first and second and people third and this is automatically regressive on those who earn less.   I'm not for 'equity planning' or 'advocacy planning' and I'm not for rent-seeking either in a closed vacuum, but I think the modern city deserves a healthy mix of its living, breathing residents and here's the kicker...  ...even if profit suffers,  but not in spite of profit.   EDIT: I reread this and realized that I was a little too cavalier on the ""not a problem part,"" when referring to ""gentrification,"" when I should be more sensitive to historical and cultural institutions, familial ties and other non-economic factors that are hard to quantify. I meant, in theory, and in terms of dollars, the relative wage gap, as it increases, detensifies the overall resentment to new opportunity and the cyclical nature of the ""city"" or ""neighborhood."""

Otherwise, they'd have no incentive to live that far away, and would live closer to their job.   From an economic standpoint, as wealth increases, so does value placed on time.

To make this work you'd need a very clear and universal way of interacting with your route and I'm not sure that's something quite got right. The phone system in particular sounds horrible!   The easiest solution for most people is smart phone\website. Literally all could be done on either one and tapping on/off with a card would be all else required.   As for the elderly who may not have access to a smart phone or good computer skills to rely on a website for route planning you need to have a simple system that cuts out all the crap.  A phone system would need you to possess three pieces of information. The name of your bus stop, the name of the bus stop where you want to be dropped off (on that buses route not necessarily the end destination) and the time you can be at the bus stop by, with only one piece of information returned, the time the bus will be there.   This is a system that works for account holders and one time cash fairers and wouldn't require listening to tedious menus of times and places.  I'm pretty sure after the first leg if all other steps will happen in hubs then all next steps can be handled by ticket machines for both cash payers and card holders.   Interesting idea though.

One is that differences in assumed vs. actual diversity, however you measure diversity, is going to depend on the unit of aggregation. This is the MAUP, so it should be pretty obvious. For example, whether a neighborhood is diverse or not depends on what you include in the neighborhood boundaries, and ""neighborhood"" means different things to different people.  The other point is more the technique used by OSU/Rutgers mentioned in the article, and that's space-time activities. That's a much more interesting way of getting at a specific way in which diversity might matter. It helps answer the question of whether people across some axis of difference are likely to interact with each other. Interestingly:   His study found that as residents' socioeconomic status rises, their likelihood of running into other neighbors - of any socioeconomic status - declines.   He then goes into other reasons you may want mixed-income neighrborhoods, like amenity access.  I don't like ""self-segregation,"" because it's loaded with assumptions that people don't like to be around people different than themselves as if that is an important decision-making factor. I find it more likely that socioeconomic access to spaces and amenities is the larger driver of the observed lack of interaction.

Choosing to structure the requirements differently while still incorporating input from affected parties involves coming up with new technology for how to do that.

urbanplanning,39fznc,GNeps,14,Fri Jun 12 10:26:04 2015 UTC,This is another modernist thinktank that will follow the tradition of the urban engineers of the 50's.  Cities arn't about efficiency and we need to stop trying to make them work like machines.  They are ecosystems with infinite complexity.   Traffic 'efficiency' is what led us to building the most efficient- and unliveable- cities in the world.    It is likely that this will do more harm than good.
urbanplanning,39fznc,thelostgeographer,19,Thu Jun 11 15:48:30 2015 UTC,"Cities are about efficiency. Agglomeration is the kind of efficiency cities are about. It can be measured and improved empirically, there's little magic about it: just put things uncomfortably close together, and find ways to make it more comfortable so that you can put things even closer together.  The problem with modernist tradition is it focuses on the wrong kind of efficiency. An efficient modernist city is a highway."
urbanplanning,39fznc,hylje,4,Thu Jun 11 17:13:39 2015 UTC,"As always, the question is: what are you optimizing for? The answer to that question depends in large part on how you conceive of a city—is it a machine, or is it an ecosystem, or is it a consumable product?  So far, the rhetoric of ""smart cities"" has just been a rehash of modernist efficiency. You'll get to work on time, you'll have safety through camera surveillance, you'll have a seamless shopping experience, and so on. Once the private sector gets involved, the rhetoric becomes even more skewed because the citizen is conceived of as a consumer and the city is conceived of as a good you can package and deliver. And if it's Google we're talking about, isn't it fair to wonder if their goals include redesigning the city in order to turn citizens into products? This is part of organizing the world's information—creating services whose real goal is to determine where people go, what they do when they're out, how they spend money, how much time they devote to certain activities, etc. That's exactly how Google runs its other products and there's no reason why it would be any different in this case."
urbanplanning,39fznc,holymadness,3,Thu Jun 11 20:19:30 2015 UTC,"Even the question of a single point of optimization is suspect. There is no uniform perfect city. A city can be perfect for someone, but what about everybody else? Someone wants the city to be a machine, another an ecosystem, a third person wants it to be a product in itself. Are their goals not valid?  If you think of agglomeration on its own, it's not very describing. All it tells you that more agglomeration means more stuff. What kind of stuff? Who knows! That's why it's useful. It's just the foundation. The more agglomeration you achieve, the stronger the foundation. Google City can mingle with People City and Garden City and agglomerate off one another."
urbanplanning,39fznc,hylje,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:56:00 2015 UTC,I think you're bang on the money about how this feels to me. It delicately feels more like being sold something than any true progress.   I'm all for technology revolutionising cities. I get very excited at the prospect of super computers being big enough and their software being smart enough to give us true insight into the mechanisms behind cities.   This to me however seems slightly more to do with Google wanting to make sure it's in a comfortable position for integrated technology in our cities. Which isn't a bad thing per se but it doesn't get me nearly as excited as thinking of an improving science of urbanism.
urbanplanning,39fznc,moolah_dollar_cash,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:42:32 2015 UTC,"I can get on board with this.  I think you're right in saying that modrenists focused narrowly on the wrong form of efficiency.  The thing i'm worried about is that we can only make things efficient if we measure them in a quantifiable way.  There is thus no measurement for sense of place, lived experience or happiness.  In addition to this, if we do seek to make cities more efficient (still not a fan of the technocratic sound it has) then are we seeking to design efficient places or are we looking to make the lived experiences of that place more efficient?  Thanks for your thoughtful response!  You make a very good point."
urbanplanning,39fznc,thelostgeographer,2,Thu Jun 11 19:18:45 2015 UTC,"The thing i'm worried about is that we can only make things efficient if we measure them in a quantifiable way. There is thus no measurement for sense of place, lived experience or happiness.   I think the right answer here is that we have to be very careful about this. We should try to figure out many different ways of quantifying these things that are hard to quantify, and be careful not to set strict rules that try to optimize one of them.  And whenever we try to optimize things, we should pay attention to people who say there are values we are missing, and see if they can point to something meaningful there, even if not yet quantitative.  Also, we should look into things like Gross National Happiness and the wellbeing index recently developed by the City of Santa Monica."
urbanplanning,39fznc,easwaran,2,Thu Jun 11 23:25:41 2015 UTC,"I've actually worked with the wellbeing index!  The Canadian wellbeing index (i'm Canadian) is out of my university.  It is definitely a good measure of how people are doing, but doesn't provide great information for how place design influences the outcomes.    These indicators are definitely useful in looking at the influences on human happiness though- it's just that good urban design isn't yet used as a factor in wellness or GSH- I think it probably should be."
urbanplanning,39fznc,thelostgeographer,2,Fri Jun 12 04:07:04 2015 UTC,"Sense of place, quality of life and happiness among others are things that make city life more comfortable, enabling a higher degree of agglomeration, which makes a more efficient city.   Maximum efficiency cannot be achieved everywhere, so striving for maximizing it where possible does not take away from people who prefer a cozier, less busy environment. At worst, those people will need to move to escape agglomeration."

urbanplanning,396rt3,glorkvorn,4,Wed Jun 10 00:55:30 2015 UTC,"Landlords generally want their aggregate property value to be higher. This is not mutually exclusive with cheaper rents. Cheaper rent means larger market, which means more potential for growth.  Homeowners don't care about rents, and their property values will most likely rise with density. They should be looking at the values, not their idea of a perfect, complete neighborhood."
urbanplanning,396rt3,hylje,3,Wed Jun 10 01:29:19 2015 UTC,Can you give any examples where property values have risen but rents have decreased?  That seems really odd to me (unless theres legislation for rent control or something like that)
urbanplanning,396rt3,glorkvorn,2,Wed Jun 10 02:28:06 2015 UTC,"Actually this isn't really on-point.  Homeowners want their property values to be low due to property taxes. The lower you can keep your property values the better because most places charge between 1-2.5% of the value of the home in property taxes per year. Your 2/1 home just got reappraised from $200k to $300k (happened to me), congrats, you now owe $2500 more per year to live in the same house you lived in last year.  The trick that homeowners do want is to be able to sell higher than they bought. But even that's a fool's game as you have to live somewhere, and then your only options are to cash out and move to the burbs. Not really ideal though considering you probably lived in the city because you, you know, LIKED the city.  What NIMBY's want isn't high property values, it's to maintain their values so that when they do have to inevitably move it's not a financial hit. And they want things to remain the same.  But keep in mind that people who are NIMBYs often 'represent' the area, but don't really necessarily represent the common opinion of people in that area. Typically neighborhood associations are run by people passionate about the way things are, which by default tends to not like change."
urbanplanning,396rt3,aggieotis,2,Wed Jun 10 05:42:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe some people see it that way, but I think most homeowners just want their $number to go up, even if it isn't totally rational.  And most of them do end up selling at some point, plus there's usually a lag between property tax appraisals and what your house is actually worth."
urbanplanning,396rt3,glorkvorn,14,Thu Jun 11 02:57:48 2015 UTC,"I respect what you're doing, but I'd rather see this fight at a higher level of government, ideally federal. NIMBYs have the most power at the local level, but there are federal funds (transportation funds, notably) that could be brought to bear on local zoning codes. Fighting NIMBYs just doesn't work at the city council level."
urbanplanning,396rt3,ohtheheavywater,24,Tue Jun 9 18:26:32 2015 UTC,I disagree. Changing federal policy takes years and is far from guaranteed. Organizing at the neighborhood level can absolutely defeat NIMBYs on a project-by-project basis.
urbanplanning,396rt3,ArcadeNineFire,16,Tue Jun 9 18:56:45 2015 UTC,"There's probably room for both. Now that you mention it, activists not only managed to fight off an effort to kill a development proposal last week where I live in Maine, they added affordable-housing provisions to it. I was at the council meeting where it was voted on and the pro-development side somehow way outnumbered the NIMBYs. So maybe it's not hopeless."
urbanplanning,396rt3,ohtheheavywater,-3,Tue Jun 9 19:07:19 2015 UTC,That's where the issue is occurring. At the local level. To tell me not to fight at this level is intentional misdirection to make me less effective.

see visitors and  residents alike  staring up at the impressive skyline as building seem to grow taller and taller  the question is  is there a limit to their height New York magazine architecture critic Justin  Davidson a pulitzer prize-winner  has taken a look at this issue in his recent article the rise of the mile high  building and he joins us now just a good to see you as always suggest headed back  here  with Metro focused thank you I'll when has this serb race to the sky  start it is this something fairly new forms know it started at the end of the  19th century and has just been going on steadily  you know each generation has buildings that the previous generation  or couple generations back could really hardly imagine and  there've been areas where a moments where that slowdown  and others words picked up and every time there's a new technology that comes  in or there's a kind of  consolidation and the technology you get another spurt  but a lot of it has to do with the economics which change you talk about  technology in the role that technology plays but is a limit is driven  by ego in some way sure I mean  you know being the tallest is  is an aspiration I mean a the city was built by  ego and ambition you know a building real estate is supposed to be a rational  and ever it's about making money it's about  rent per square foot or cost per square foot  but when you're getting to the really high towers there is a kind of element  to the irrationality  that comes in and I don't set up a joint early cuz I think that's really what  built this city is  a and and other cities like Chicago this just desire to go up once you know that  you can  the ability to do it is inherently exciting    is is there a limit we know that as technology advanced we have the capacity  now  do so many more things and certainly in terms of construction but but  about is there a limit do you think to how high we can go practically speaking  for these buildings  so they're two kinds and lets one is technological or physical and the other  probably the margin main one is economic  so the technology if you talk engineers about how high they could theoretically  go  they won't give you a lemon you know Frank Lloyd Wright  designed a hypothetical  mile-high tower for Chicago and  when I ask engineers now could you actually build such a famous ensure  you could build now the tallest tower were actually getting in the near future  is the  Kingdom tower now which is going into construction  in saudi arabia that's a common RI so    can you compare that to some new york city buildings give us a a  a comparative sensible were talking about that much higher than anything we  have  here so the tallest tower now is the World Trade Center  which is if you include a little antenna at the top that 1776 Pete  in practice it's really a para 1455 tower  and we're gonna get a bunch of these 1505 towers in New York over the next  ten years  a we're going to really see that become a i'm new york type  I but the tallest 10 min we're talking and twice that I said Smith  twice that size now mile-high tower is considerably bigger than that if you  figure the  Kingdom tower is going to be around 3,000 feet a mile-high tower would be  about five thousand  a so you're talking about big leaps but technologically  we could actually figure out how to do that Russia engineers can    would we anticipate that any of these these super high rises might end up  being here in New York City  you know I don't think this is where the  d upper limit is going to be reached  again in the foreseeable future wanna because I think we're near City  everything we do is yeah biggest and the best way out the tallest building well  because it's been a while since  we really pursued that as a goal a  and here the economic pressures are in  tats so I said that there's another kind limit which is the economic one  at a certain point as your building higher and higher  you really have to taper that tower which means with every additional  floor a you have to you  and concrete to the base I mean that much more expensive as you go higher to  build another floor  so it's not just because the building that next floor it also how you  how you Queen I know some database act like and  because at tower that all has to taper  a you're not adding that much square footage economically  at a certain point it just makes sense to build another tower next door you  know not to just keep going higher you're not  squeezing the space in a way that makes economic sense  so when you have  a city where construction costs and land and  everything is as expensive as New York those pressures got more intense  and it's that much more expensive to build I saw that that you talk to one of  the issues is as  has we go higher and higher the real question becomes    how does that structure intersect sector how was it interwoven  with the ground below it Gaza mi well that's a huge issue i mean  really you were talking in your introduction about people looking up  but most the time when you're walking around the city york's centre the city  only goes up about 10 stores  you know you interact with buildings at the ground for  how that that building has met to the urban fabric  really has lot to do with the success  in an urban set so that our and so for example  one Vanderbilt is going to be a tall tower nowhere near what are these super  tall  powers but its 1500 feet I mean that's you know  very tall and that's an office building  right next to Grand Central it has access to GrandCentral  part so that are going to be public you're gonna be able to serve connector  underground  areas it's big a tree and you can be able to pass through it  even if you don't actually work in a am  so that has a public to mention which i think is what  you need in a place like that while these towers you know you get close to  the lobby and there's somebody coming out  saying can I help you sir well it's fascinating as we reach for the sky just  Dave's it was good to have you with us  thank you"

It launches on July 1 and I'm really excited to see how functional it is. The 5,000 volunteers are limited to cars and light commercial vehicles though, so if it gets wider implementation I'd also be interested to see the pricing for heavier vehicles."
urbanplanning,391vqk,ChefShimi,4,Mon Jun 8 19:37:58 2015 UTC,The Oregon VMT system is asinine. It creates incentives for larger and less fuel efficient vehicles.  They are going the wrong direction and wasting money to get there.   It would make more sense to use the existing fuel tax and registration fee system.
urbanplanning,391vqk,Insp_Legrasse,2,Mon Jun 8 23:23:44 2015 UTC,You gotta move to a VMT system eventually. Hybrid and electric cars can't be reasonably and fairly taxed without it.  Nor is a VMT tax scheme necessarily complex. It can well be calculated as part of the existing registration fee. Vehicle weight times estimated mileage per registration period. Simple.  It only gets complex if you necessarily want high precision and low fraud. But you quickly reach the point where the costs of additional control overwhelm the potential gains of better compliance. A well defined VMT tax is rough enough that most people fall within its margins just with asking how long their commute is and catches the big-fish fraudsters with routine police/maintenance/registration checks.
urbanplanning,391vqk,hylje,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:55:43 2015 UTC,"You have a good point, at some point all electric cars need to pay into the road network. A system like the VMT could be used for them.   However, this creates a perverse incentive for gas cars, 99%+ of the cars on the road today and for the foreseeable future.  Also, as structured, the VMT does not account for weight. A per weight, per distance fee would be equitable and create at least some small incentive to keep weights down."
urbanplanning,391vqk,Insp_Legrasse,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:47:51 2015 UTC,"VMT is energy agnostic, that's the whole point. If some energy sources are problematic and some are not, they need to be handled with separate policy. That doesn't concern road maintenance, though. The road doesn't care whether the vehicles running on it are gas, battery or nuclear powered.  That's exactly why replacing a dual-purpose tax like gas tax wholesale with VMT will leave a funny incentive behind."
urbanplanning,391vqk,hylje,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:02:49 2015 UTC,"What's the registration fee system? I agree that it's far from ideal from a fuel efficiency standpoint, seems more like the kind of thing that could be used in conjunction with the gas tax. I just like to see new ideas being tried out because my state (Michigan) has been debating ways to increase roads funding for a while now."
urbanplanning,391vqk,ChefShimi,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:34:28 2015 UTC,"Don't existing registration systems also incentive (by failing to account for) larger and less fuel efficient vehicles? An SUV creates about twice the wear and tear on roads as a passenger car. A semi creates something like 5,000 times more damage. By that logic, registration for 16 wheelers should be around a million bucks."
urbanplanning,391vqk,Nacho_Average_Libre,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:13:41 2015 UTC,"This seems incredibly vague - on the one hand, the point is supposed to be more general than just an odometer tax, so that you can get congestion charges.

urbanplanning,391vqk,ChefShimi,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:24:16 2015 UTC,"Vehicle miles traveled tax:       A vehicle miles traveled (VMT) tax, also frequently referred to as a VMT fee, mileage-based fee, or road user charge, is a policy of charging motorists based on how many miles they have traveled.  It has been proposed in various states in the United States and elsewhere as an infrastructure funding mechanism to replace, or supplement the fuel tax,  which has been generating billions less in revenue each year due to increasingly fuel efficient vehicles.   In the United States, a VMT fee currently exists as part of a limited program for 5,000 volunteers in Oregon and for trucks in Illinois.   Internationally, Germany, Austria, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Switzerland have implemented various forms of VMT fees, limited to trucks. New Zealand also has such a system applying to all heavy vehicles and diesel-powered cars. France, Belgium and Russia all have truck based systems under development.

The option where it just records how many miles you drive within each zone is interesting, though I can see potential privacy complaints of people not wanting their spouse to know that they were driving 10 miles in downtown Portland and 15 miles in downtown Salem last month, even without knowing the precise locations and dates."
urbanplanning,391vqk,easwaran,2,Tue Jun 9 01:45:33 2015 UTC,"Oh ya, with congestion pricing based on miles traveled I'm not sure how you'd alleviate privacy concerns entirely. I think a basic daily charge, similar to London's system, makes sense for congestion pricing, but still wouldn't complete eliminate privacy concerns."
urbanplanning,391vqk,ChefShimi,2,Tue Jun 9 02:13:32 2015 UTC,"Congestion pricing should be handled the way Seattle handles it in its HO2+T and HO3+T lanes. The road is embedded with sensors and has piles of cameras that monitor congestion, and then there's a variable rate based on congestion to use the HOT lanes if you have less than 2(167) or 3(405) people in your car.  There's also the 520 method, which is less accurate of simply changing the toll based on a schedule (as it approaches rush hour the toll rises, off-peak it falls, but it does not respond to traffic)  The congestion pricing could be tacked on top of the VMT based taxation, but perhaps a mix of VMT, Gas tax, and congestion tolling would all be appropriate, rather than relying on one or pairs.   This is also how Seattle handles its variable Speed limits into downtown, and why we've had traffic congestion maps for a lot longer than google has for the Seattle area."

(well, one of my Tacoma friends parent worked north of the county line, out of many friends and many parents.) But that's also a bidirectional thing. Federal way is probably like 2/3 a suburb of Seattle, and 1/3 a suburb of Tacoma. Places are suburbs of Tacoma, not so much Tacoma is a suburb of anything else. Seattle is not a suburb of Redmond, but lots of people work in Redmond and live in Seattle.   At any rate - Tacomas growth is mostly dictated by growth in employment in the city of tacoma, which has been flat, and so has the population of Tacoma (in fact I think its shrunk a smidge since I went to high school 6 years ago - it was 206,000 - now it appears to be 203,000)   I mean, I would think more people would live in the nice parts of Tacoma and commute around a bit, but it just doesn't seem to be happening.   Yes, plenty of University students live at home in Tacoma and take the bus to the U, and a fair number of people commute on the 57x and 59x busses to the city every day (probably a couple thousand) and then about 3,000-6,000(I don't remember which it was) a day on the sounder And there's probably a couple thousand that drive to somewhere north of the county line, but most people seem to stay in pierce county who live in Tacoma."

The city began actively planning and revitalizing using road diets, creating parks, and other things and now the downtown is one of the major attractions in upstate SC. It was even featured as one of the APA's Great Places in America: Streets in 2009. And the city is still actively planning projects to improve the city further."

The situation imagined is that several individuals go out to eat, and prior to ordering, they agree to split the check equally between all of them. Each individual must now choose whether to order the expensive or inexpensive dish. It is presupposed that the expensive dish is better than the cheaper, but not by enough to warrant paying the difference compared to eating alone. Each individual reasons that the expense s/he adds to their bill by ordering the more expensive item is very small, and thus the improved dining experience is worth the money. However, having all reasoned thus, they all end up paying for the cost of the more expensive meal, which by assumption, is worse for everyone than having ordered and paid for the cheaper meal.

Mopeds. The streets still support motorized traffic, just not full sized cars. Also where I grew up cargo bicycles were very common - a bicycle can carry an ungodly amount of goods, we just tend not to in the West.   Heck, I remember bicycle vendors.

Heck, now that I think of it, the apartment I grew up in had only one means of egress via the main stairwell. No fire escapes of any sort. Huh, I'd probably consider it a death trap today.  I don't think it's possible to achieve exactly this in the US, but we can get a bit closer. The important thing here is that these passage ways are pedestrian-first, with mopeds and bicycles second, and no cars whatsoever.

urbanplanning,38oqyz,Concise_Pirate,26,Fri Jun 5 16:29:55 2015 UTC,"Some of these really confirm my steoreotype starchitect as being out of touch with people and reality. Here's Libeskind's gem on the horror that is Montparnasse in Paris.   “It’s legendary for being the most hated building in Paris. I want to defend it not because it’s a particularly beautiful tower, but because of the idea it represents. Parisians panicked when they saw it, and when they abandoned the tower they also abandoned the idea of a high-density sustainable city. Because they exiled all future high rises to some far neighborhood like La Défense, they were segregating growth. Parisians reacted aesthetically, as they are wont to do, but they failed to consider the consequences of what it means to be a vital, living city versus a museum city. People sentimentalize their notions of the city, but with the carbon footprint, the waste of resources, our shrinking capacity, we have no choice but to build good high-rise buildings that are affordable. It’s not by coincidence that people are going to London now not just for work but for the available space. No young company can afford Paris. Maybe Tour Montparnasse is not a work of genius, but it signified a notion of what the city of the future will have to be.”   First, defending a project that failed based on the idea it represents is just nonsense. A poor implementation of a good idea is not a success. It looks horrible, is completely out of touch with the rest of Paris and offers only marginal benefits. Diverting from the typical Paris-look with one giant building just imposed a huge aesthetic cost for no real benefit (and led to the immediate implementation of a ban on future buildings of that height). The aesthetic quality only works if it is on a citywide level.   Second, the idea is not good idea by default (towers). Libeskind claims they are necessary for a vital, living city. Ironically all the top scoring cities for livability (Copenhagen, Barcelona, Amsterdam... and yes, Paris) do not have towers. Vancouver has and it can be done successfully, but it is not a criterion in itself.  Third, claiming that people flee to London because they can't afford Paris is ridiculous. London is in the top 3 unaffordable cities worldwide.  I'm baffled but not really surprised at how out of touch Libeskind is with reality.  edit: words"
urbanplanning,38oqyz,Mornic,17,Fri Jun 5 18:05:07 2015 UTC,"Agree. I agree with Libeskind that more density and growing upwards is necessary going into the future, and that Paris cannot stay encased in its own history forever.  But at the end of the day, a project has to fit within the context of its environment. You simply cannot smack a giant tower that aesthetically doesn't fit into a city and expect people to react well. More than that, designing a monument to yourself is the ultimate arrogance in urban planning and the worst aspect of starchitecture. That building doesn't even pretend to be part of the greater Paris.  For me though Libeskind wasn't the most disconnected from reality... Annabelle Seldorf:   Against my better judgment, I like this complex. It’s sculptural, architectural abstraction to the extreme. At a distance, the scale of the skyline exudes a sense of identity and strength for Albany, while at the pedestrian level the Plaza plays an important role in the community. I know that others find it too brutal or forbidding...   This is the ultimate in ""hey it looks really cool from far"" designer wankery and ignores the reasons why everyone hates the damn thing. Yeah, it is sculptural, they sacrificed every ounce of practicality and actual human usability to do it, which is typical of every damn Radiant City bullshit development. The pedestrian plaza is not used, much less ""plays an important role in the community"".

The Paris metropolitan area has tons of room to grow, and just because that growth doesn't happen in the twenty arrondisements doesn't mean it's not happening at all.   Parisians reacted aesthetically, as they are wont to do, but they failed to consider the consequences of what it means to be a vital, living city versus a museum city.   Do we need to remind this critic that Paris is first and foremost a culturally-minded behemoth of tourism? As long as that's the case, they can expand for the future however and wherever they want to while still maintaining the heart of the city and establishing modern economic relevance. Not every landlocked megacity needs to have the same vertical zoning sensibilities as Sao Paulo."
urbanplanning,38oqyz,ApathyJacks,3,Fri Jun 5 23:12:09 2015 UTC,"Well even though there's room to expand outside the center, what you tend to get are the banlieues, with high density of poor people and often only token connections to the transit system. The center of the city already has huge investment in its Metro and other systems - it could make sense to make better use of that rather than requiring whole new sets of transportation infrastructure along with the new buildings.  (Of course, that doesn't mean that it has to be skyscrapers - Paris is already the example to North America that you can have density without high rises. But if you expanded to 7-10 stories in major regions around the Metro, you'd probably have far more development than a few new banlieues, and they'd be better connected to the community as a whole.)"

When designing you are asked to start with the 'concept' around which your building is based. You then throw in enough technical details to make it work, dress is up with a stunning presentation, (those with the nicest renders and models got the best marks, generally, as long as the tutors also liked the concept) and be confident enough to respond well in a crit.  Of course this doesn't reflect day-to-day life in commercial practice where budgets and briefs are tighter, but it explains the basis for modern architectural thinking, which leads to the kinds of structures in the article and explains why mostly architects defend them.  Ironically I learned more about the finer points of design (good public space layout, the right and wrong places to use certain materials, proportions used in massing and spacing, etc.) after I left arch school, and mostly in my own time."

urbanplanning,38lm61,easwaran,-2,Fri Jun 5 13:00:28 2015 UTC,"Train infrastructure is paid for by those who use it. (Unless you're just talking about commuter rail.)  Also, I don't see anything wrong with wanting infrastructure to be funded by those who use it, assuming the fees can be assessed comprehensively, fairly, and conveniently. It would encourage people to use cheaper, more efficient options."
urbanplanning,38lm61,jrmrjnck,6,Fri Jun 5 17:10:05 2015 UTC,"Is that right? I was under the impression that most rail systems (whether urban transit, commuter rail, or intercity) receive subsidies from various levels of government, at least in the United States.  The reason why infrastructure shouldn't necessarily be entirely funded by those who use it is that there are plenty of people who benefit from it even if they never use it, ranging from property owners along the infrastructure, to businesses that get more customers, to users of other infrastructure that have lower congestion."
urbanplanning,38lm61,easwaran,3,Fri Jun 5 18:06:40 2015 UTC,"Local rail-based commuter systems surely receive subsidies, but the majority of rail infrastructure in the US is used for freight shipping, and that's owned and maintained by private railroad companies.  Yeah, positive externalities are a concern, but they can be mitigated to some extent (e.g. parking validation). I'm not suggesting that comprehensive user fees are practical at the moment, but I think it's theoretically the best alternative."
urbanplanning,38lm61,jrmrjnck,6,Fri Jun 5 18:39:50 2015 UTC,"Private Freight companies don't pay shit for the maintenance of their tracks, else we'd have 110 mph passenger service country-wide.   In Chicago - the rail companies are leaning on the public coffers to fix their freight mess, and they can do so because, ""oh we'll just move to St. Louis"" And Chicago puts up with it. This is the same countrywide."
urbanplanning,38lm61,alexfrancisburchard,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:56:36 2015 UTC,"The freights don't maintain 110 mph tracks because they   A) have no reason on their own to do so, and were pushed out of the legacy capacity to do so by subsidization of their competitors and the destructive anti-economics of the old Interstate Commerce Commission   B) Are not paid to do so.  Amtrak pays a pittance relative to the capacity they consume.  Now, it might be just and fair that they do in the 'a deal is a deal' sense, but it's not exactly a motivator  Can we really fault them for what they want in Chicago, anyways? I mean, everyone else is getting a piece of the transportation infrastructure pie, but they're paying taxes on theirs."
urbanplanning,38lm61,Lol-I-Wear-Hats,2,Sat Jun 6 01:38:24 2015 UTC,"Point Stands, Freight rail is no more self sufficient than pax rail, interstate freeways, etc."
urbanplanning,38lm61,alexfrancisburchard,0,Sat Jun 6 01:48:51 2015 UTC,"That point doesn't. Freight rail is considerably more self sufficient. It pays property taxes on its infrastructure and maintains the vast bulk of it on their own dime, with the occasional chip in from governments on some basis or another, usually when there's some sort of passenger trains involved.    Sure, it's not some Randian bastion of free and unentangled enterprise, but it's much more self sufficient than the freeways or passenger rail. Hell, the entirety of Class 1 freight revenue per ton-mile is roughly equal to the uncompensated social costs of trucking"
urbanplanning,38lm61,Lol-I-Wear-Hats,2,Sat Jun 6 02:03:23 2015 UTC,"It's hard to believe that. They never paid for the land they own (land grants) they barely paid for the construction of the tracks (much of that was subsidized) And to this day they don't maintain much of their trackage (it is left to public funding - especially the busiest parts - like Chicago, ports, etc)"

urbanplanning,38ihv4,baklazhan,21,Thu Jun 4 22:17:10 2015 UTC,"Train travel is just more comfortable. People are willing to pay higher prices for the spacious seating, convenience of stations being in city centers, and no security lines.  Over medium distances, high speed rail becomes very appealing connecting regional cities over flying."
urbanplanning,38ihv4,Eudaimonics,17,Thu Jun 4 17:00:08 2015 UTC,"Over short to medium distances (3-5h) fast trains can well outrun a flight. Airport overhead is real.  Comfort and convenience still apply when flights are faster door-to-door.  Trains can also be incredibly cheap: once the initial route is built, the marginal costs to increase frequency and operating hours, adding more cars and using double-decker cars are very low. So long the demand is there, there's no reason not to expand service to the lower rungs.  Trains have everyone beat when it comes to high-demand corridors. Bus lines and airlines however have a massive niche in capturing many low-demand corridors at premium prices."
urbanplanning,38ihv4,hylje,3,Thu Jun 4 17:48:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, the thing that needs to be counted when comparing air to train isn't the speed to destination from takeoff to landing, but from early arrival at airport, security checks and waiting to average delays to the actual flight time and the last mile from the airport to an often distant downtown area.    Where as train travel is usually more regular, has fewer (in some countries, non-existent) delays and tends to take you from downtown to downtown if designed well.    Usually when accounting for those factors, train travel becomes much quicker and more reliable."
urbanplanning,38ihv4,Krases,8,Thu Jun 4 23:49:39 2015 UTC,The cultural factor is also very important. The US has a fair amount of public transport but it is nearly all low end public transport and that is one of the reasons why public transport is considered for poor people. It is as if there were only low budget airlines and economy class tickets. To improve the status of public transport there needs to be atleast a few high end projects catered towards rich and famous people. Just like private jets help raise the status of flying high speed rail can help raise the status of public transport/rail.
urbanplanning,38ihv4,252003,2,Thu Jun 4 17:20:31 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I often take the Metra (Chicago's regional commuter) and it's usually 2-3x more expensive than the L. However you don't have to worry about muggings on the train, masturbators, human waste on seats etc. The premium is definitely worth it."
urbanplanning,38ihv4,tidderreddittidderre,2,Thu Jun 4 20:37:48 2015 UTC,"agreed, just like what tesla did for the electric car, and what ""chic"" cyclers in denmark are doing for commuter cycling"
urbanplanning,38ihv4,vorxaw,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:53:10 2015 UTC,"More comfortable for whom? I get much more nauseated when I ride a train than when I ride in a car or on an airplane.  And how do you know people will pay more for the spacious seating and convenience of trains? Can you cite a study saying so? As it stands now, many Amtrak fares are cheaper than airplane tickets (plus the trains are spacious, convenient, and terrorism-free) but they don't appear to be nearly as popular as air travel.  The concept of high-speed rail may be appealing over medium distances, but consumer appeal isn't the sole variable. There's also cost of construction, cost of operation, routing, noise and intersections, and so on. Just because a train makes sense on your cocktail-napkin doodle doesn't make it feasible in a given physical context."
urbanplanning,38ihv4,jpw5x4,2,Sun Jun 7 18:54:52 2015 UTC,"At least in the Northeast Corridor speed isn't the only consideration. The TX/CA/FL projects, since they're coming up from more or less a blank slate have the flexibility to really pump the infra for speed, but up North I think we're getting sidetracked in these discussions.  It's coverage we want, not the highest possible speed. Yes the NEC could use billion of dollars in investment and yes the speed considerations should be addressed in the empty quarters on the Shore Line and the alternate Inland Route that's finally getting some attention - but there will always be speed reductions through the New Haven-NYC-NJ stretch (even when the Portal Bridge is rebuilt and Gateway happens...), and through Philly and Baltimore (when the B&P tunnel project straightens that shit out). That isn't a bad thing either - the NEC is such a barnstormer because it reaches the most people, not because it has the highest speed. The albeit slowish Acela obliterated airlines in the DC-NYC air/rail market after 2003. So while speed is important, and should be brought up to snuff where it's feasible, I'd the NEC's future should still be quick-as-possible inter-city exp/locals serving the old city center stations on congested, speed-limited track."

Even Google can't generate the level of detail needed for autonomous driving using automatic algorithms... they have to troubleshoot every stop and turn by hand.

If you want to be a real estate developer, the main requirement is to have the money to  build things with. If you want to work for a developer or be involved in the process of making buildings happen, there are all kinds of roles for you.  Here's a very simplistic rundown of who's doing what in urban development: the developer sets out to build something with the intent of making a profit. This building will be designed by architects and engineers, and will have to conform to a set of rules and guidelines previously set out by urban planners who are employed by the city. If the developer wants the building to deviate from these guidelines (e.g. build something taller than the existing height limit) they'll hire an urban planner of their own, who can navigate the necessary processes and policies.  As you can see, no single person is ""getting the job done"" or making a final decision- it's a negotiated process with a number of different actors."

I recently sat in on a mock council meeting over the development and implementation of a youth detention centre in Northern Queensland, and it seems that the process was very much a 'does this tick all our requirements', 'do we have any social concerns, or environmental concerns' sort of thing.   At the end of the discussion the development was put down to a vote between the councillors and the city mayor. I'm positive not every development would require this process but for major developments I can see why they would do this.  The planning scheme is what a council will rely upon when making decisions, and it is what the developer will draw upon when they're making their design decisions. For example the Hinchinbrook Shire Planning Scheme can be found here.   All their codes are written to comply with relevant legislation (i.e Sustainable Planning Act 2009).   Although if the developer wants to develop something that isn't specifically coded against (i.e Exempt developments) they would need to address the legislation directly, and submit the proposal to the local council.  As for getting a job as a developer? Not sure. I hope you find the other information useful.  tl;dr: The council has the last say on the development, developers just make it happen when the application is approved."

That wasn't an isolated movement either, these things appeared in the US, the UK, Sweden, Germany, South Africa, now Chine and Brazil, everywhere - and they haven't fared well in most cases. They were ""pure"" function with all the ornamentation stripped away. The urban planning principles weren't what they are today, yes, but ""beauty follows function"" is just as risk-prone for cities as prioritizing the ""beautiful"" city.

Of course, it's sort of a cheap point to say that form follows function works out, as long as you get the function absolutely right (it could be a sort of ""no true Scotsman"" move that I'm doing here).

The mere existence of the question implies that we should be sorting people, not letting them clump up or separate as they please.  High land values don't inherently mean high cost of living. The magic that makes high land values translate into high cost of living is zoning that limits how you can exploit high land values by packing more cheaper units in bigger-footprint buildings.   If rich people are allowed a zoning stick to make low cost living illegal, they will use it. If that's a problem, why do they have that stick?"
urbanplanning,387wra,hylje,11,Tue Jun 2 15:09:50 2015 UTC,"Zoning is what you make of it. Yes for sure some municipalities use zoning as a big stick to prevent redevelopment and intensification of an area. But other municipalities, or even different areas within the same municipality, can and do use zoning to allow more things to happen on a property.   There is value in knowing what can be built on your neighbours land in exchange for having limits on what you can build on your own land. These rules can be changed through a democratic process and are not set in stone. Compare that to the typical other way that these types of controls are implemented: restrictive covenants. RCs are extremely difficult to change, update or adapt to new circumstances. This gets more difficult the older the development is. At least with zoning there is an opportunity to make changes over time.   Zoning can also control or preserve the building form in the area, so you don't have a 20 storey high rise packed with 200 square foot ""suites"" beside one and two storey ground oriented dwellings. The negative land use impacts of that kind of association are what zoning seeks to avoid. In other words, zoning prevents one person from maximizing their personal profit at the expense of everyone else around him (or her).   In general, I think zoning has too many rules. They should be simplified and more types of uses should be deemed to be compatible. i.e. show me how a duplex is not compatible with a single detached..."

Cities are a jigsaw puzzle, zoning can tell everyone how to fit snugly together.   In other words, zoning prevents one person from maximizing their personal profit at the expense of everyone else around him (or her).   That's stick zoning at its purest. They're not afraid of a 20 story high rise, they're afraid of three story apartment buildings. There'd be no reason to even think about high rises if you could as easily build twenty of three story buildings instead.  The lack of development is an expense in itself, though an expense external to the community."

When demand can be filled in in a quick, low-intrusive, piecemeal and low-capital fashion there's a precious few reasons to build slow, intrusive, large and capital-intensive high rises. Out-of-place high rises are at worst a curiosity, at best harbingers of latent development. Hardly a core issue to base planning regimes around."

The uncanny valley is in the middle, when old perfectly serviceable buildings are clearly not enough to meet today's demand. Then the options are basically to add a floor in-place or increase footprint with new wings (with more floors).  But the comparison is unfair to begin with. Only a big-name developer that can secure a lot of financing at once can even consider a 22-story high rise.

And in.fact seems to contradict your earlier assertion that anyone who doesn't like new development should become a wolf...or something...  In reality, development is a political process. Sure, developers and City Administration have way more resources than a typical person. But City Council is accountable through the democratic process. And through public hearings, the decisions are made in a transparent way. City guiding principles are made in consultation with residents at large.

Well, not just that. There's also the magic of increasing marginal construction costs for taller buildings. As your buildings get taller they need to be made out of sturdier materials, and devote more of their floor space to elevator shafts, escape stairways, plumbing for higher floors, etc.  Construction costs put a floor on how cheap newly constructed units can be. Higher land values mean that it's more efficient to use the per square foot costs of taller buildings, but they don't reduce those costs. I've seen various estimates ranging from $100 to $200 per square foot, which really does mean that anything in a high rise is expensive for a median family, unless it's an existing building that has depreciated, so that the current owner is willing to sell it for less than the construction cost."
urbanplanning,387wra,easwaran,3,Tue Jun 2 19:49:48 2015 UTC,"Indeed, marginal construction costs do increase the higher you go. Because of this, the first direction to expand should be horizontal, increasing the footprint of the building. After that, smaller units to compensate high cost of the floor area.  For properties to depreciate and filter down to lower and lower price points, there has to be a slight surplus of them. This is absolutely achievable."

We should strive to make all of our land as expensive as possible.  Zoning limits the raw amount of real estate on that land and forbids building less useful (but more tightly packed) units for the limited amount of real estate. As the maximum amount of units per land area is reached, the cost of living corresponds to the cost of land. This is bad: if we make land expensive, we have to drive out the people that can't afford the minimum allowed unit.  If we don't make land expensive, or even manufacture low-value land to allow low-cost lifestyles, that's called suburban sprawl.   I think there is very little evidence that wealthy people are using zoning as a weapon.  Capital is a very effective weapon in its own right.   Zoning is used as little more than a weapon. It should be a tool to enable and facilitate more than a laissez-faire environment would, not a tool to limit and curb development to a halt.  Capital alone doesn't allow you to stop your neighbor from using his capital to build stuff that you don't approve. At best, you can acquire enough land that you don't need to care about your neighbor. Or throw cash at him and convince him to do his thing elsewhere.  Zoning policy allows you to project yourself far beyond what your capital reaches. It allows you to dictate what other people can and cannot do with their capital at little cost to you."

It is reflective of high demand and short supply. The goal is not high prices, the goal is optimal allocation of resources. High real estate prices on dense, well planned urban spaces indicates low supply. Meeting that supply will lower prices. That will be a good thing, that means demand was met and that less development is necessary. If prices remain high that indicates unmet demand and will necessitate further resource allocation.   Zoning limits the raw amount of real estate on that land and forbids building less useful   Zoning provides a framework within which the market can function. Without such parameters the market will optimize itself for near term capital appreciation rather than potentially trusting in greater returns over the long run.   This is bad: if we make land expensive, we have to drive out the people that can't afford the minimum allowed unit.   Now you contradict yourself. First you said you want all land to be expensive.   If we don't make land expensive, or even manufacture low-value land to allow low-cost lifestyles, that's called suburban sprawl.   Suburban sprawl is caused by a consensus vacuum. It is a technical failure of planners, developers, and community members.   Zoning is used as little more than a weapon   Only in non-functioning democracies and municipalities. Anarchy is not going to improve those localities.   Zoning policy allows you to project yourself far beyond what your capital reaches.   Because it's easier to buy a vote than it is to buy land?

No. If zoning practically limits the amount of stuff on a piece of land, it establishes the link between expensive land and expensive living. This means expensive land is entirely unaccessible if you can't afford the minimum allowed unit.  Unless this link is dismantled, the only way to create low-cost living is by manufacturing low-value land.   Anarchy is not going to improve those localities.   I am not advocating anarchy. I will however take laissez-faire over terrible regulation. Best have good regulation that has laissez-faire beat.   Because it's easier to buy a vote than it is to buy land?   It's easier and cheaper to appeal to zoning and other building rules than it is to buy land, yes.

urbanplanning,387wra,hylje,-1,Wed Jun 3 00:11:13 2015 UTC,"Zoning on a piece of land restricts the use only of that piece of land. If the zoning practices are poor (and there are many instances of poor zoning laws) then competition will force them to change, as there is no limit of undeveloped land (in North America, sorry for the geocentricism, but IDC about anywhere else).   Unless this link is dismantled, the only way to create low-cost living is by manufacturing low-value land.   You are assuming there is no undeveloped, low regulation land. That assumption is false.

Statistically, poorer people have lower rates of car ownership and shoving affordable housing out to the fringes of the city makes it more difficult to access essential services.

Urban planning in the private sector is booming, especially with the rise of 'integrated' and 'full-service' Architectural-Engineering firms. These firms can bring multiple disciplines to bear in-house and take a project through every stage, from concept to definition, development strategy to approvals, design and engineering, and often project manegement as well. These firms are highly sought after and competition is fierce between them. Getting work as a planner in such a firm is highly competitive but also extremely rewarding due to the variety of projects one will work on, plus working in teams with allied professions is fantastic."

If we're working front counter, we probably stand in front of a computer. So not really active.   Not very easy. You need to take advantage of any sort of co-op program or summer student postings to be able to get 24 months of experience to be considered by most employers. Also, likely be willing to move to an undesirable area for the first couple of years to get that experience. After 5 years experience, it becomes easier.   Demand depends. Anecdotally, it seems that planners are required at a rate of about 1:10000 population. But this fluctuates based on how fast the area is growing. Faster growth means more people are needed to review plans."

That said, it's significantly smaller profession than civil engineering.  That translates into fewer jobs, but there are fewer planners being trained, so it works out.  I've been doing this a long time and I can't say I've ever seen a market where planners were in high demand, but you'd have a set of skills that isn't duplicated in other professions, and you should be employable throughout your career.  Out of college, your lack of experience can be a hindrance...I don't think that's unique to planning.

And there are other planners who, despite their best efforts, are just not as competitive. You can make a good living as a planner if you're competent and committed to finding a job. But to really excel - whether financially or professionally - you have to have that business sense that other providers of professional services have.

urbanplanning,384cmi,evdebs,11,Mon Jun 1 19:36:34 2015 UTC,"The overarching reason, for me, is that the rules of the road were designed to move cars fast, with bicyclists (and pedestrians) coming in as an afterthought at best. For example, traveling on an arterial road, you come to a T-intersection with the side road to the left. You will encounter no cross traffic, ever, except for pedestrians (and then only rarely). But there's a traffic signal which requires you to wait-- for what? It's there for cars traveling at 45 mph, who cannot be relied upon to notice or yield to traffic entering from the side road, or pedestrians crossing. For a person on a bicycle, it isn't relevant-- but you have to stop anyway.  Residential areas peppered with stop signs are another example. They're there because drivers can't be relied upon to notice or yield to anyone while driving 30 mph in a 25 mph zone (and just try getting that speed limit enforced). Stop signs are local residents' only way to get a handle on the situation. They wouldn't be necessary if traffic were moving at 15 mph, and if the vehicles weren't so large. But once they're in, everyone is required to follow them...  Of course, there are plenty of other traffic rules which you ignore at your peril. Unfortunately, people get so inured to nonsensical rules that they often start to ignore the rules entirely, sometimes with tragic results."
urbanplanning,384cmi,baklazhan,2,Mon Jun 1 23:26:57 2015 UTC,"Excellent points.  One minor point of clarification:   Stop signs are local residents' only way to get a handle on the situation.   There are other options: speed bumps/humps/tables, raised pedestrian crossings, chicanes, etc. There's also the option of turning the residential area into a maze of one-way roads that are hard to navigate for anyone not residing in the area (The Annex neighborhood in Toronto does this). Four-way stops are used so frequently because it's the easiest and cheapest option--truly a one-size-fits-all approach."
urbanplanning,384cmi,Cyclo_Jest,2,Tue Jun 2 10:49:53 2015 UTC,"From what I've read, those alternatives are often shot down by fire departments, which require roads to be wide and straight and flat in order to accommodate large vehicles. Of course, the design also makes them ideal for high speeds. Hence stop signs.  I was told, regarding a raised crosswalk, that these were not allowed on the grounds of the ADA: apparently, without a curb/ramp, blind people would not realize that they're stepping into a crosswalk, and that would be dangerous. Because, I guess, the current design is perfectly safe for blind people!  I like the maze idea (of course, bikes should be allowed to go both ways). Berkeley is another city that has implemented this. There are passages in the barriers for emergency vehicles, and which allow the streets to be used as bicycle thoroughfares, while maintaining residents' car access. I'm surprised it isn't more popular.I suppose the argument against it is that it increases traffic on the streets that don't get the treatment-- and of course that would be a negative for people living there."
urbanplanning,384cmi,baklazhan,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:27:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, the maze works pretty well. Because of the difficulty of navigating the roads, vehicle traffic is very low, meaning nobody really cares if you ride your bike the wrong way.

urbanplanning,384cmi,Cyclo_Jest,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:55:09 2015 UTC,"nobody really cares if you ride your bike the wrong way   Which actually brings us back to the original article-- this is why bicyclists break the law. The law makes no sense, so nobody cares if you break it, and nobody bothers to fix it-- they just look the other way, right up until the point that there's an accident, when they say ""it's all his fault because he was going the wrong way, damn law-breaking bicyclists"".  You can look at Google Street View in Amsterdam -- lots of one-way streets, just about all of which have little signs underneath that say ""except bicycles"" (weirdly, many of the signs are blurred out-- maybe because Google thinks the pictures of bicycles on the signs are faces?!)."
urbanplanning,384cmi,baklazhan,3,Wed Jun 10 23:31:30 2015 UTC,"Watch what pedestrians do at a stoplight when there is no cross traffic on a relatively narrow connecting street. Sure, a few will wait until the pedestrian signal allows them to cross, but the majority in that situation (narrow road with good visibility) will cross. And yes, even on a busy street, you'll see a few jaywalkers who go when they think they have a good shot of making it: the equivalent of those jaywalkers also exist on bicycles--they know they're taking a risk, but it's a calculated risk.   A person on a bicycle is able to cross the street a bit faster, so the width of the road isn't as much of an issue. It's all about visibility, and on a road with poor visibility or with lots of right-turning cars, or with unpredictable protected left-turn signals, you do see fewer cyclists running the red light, because they lose that certainty of safety.   Very few drivers feel safe running a red light. They are simply in a much larger object that is more likely to be hit when something unexpected happens. It's harder to maneuver, and harder to see out of. There's also the fear of getting a ticket, which a bicyclist feels a less worry about. Also, I would add that pedestrians never feel completely safe crossing the road (I've had way too many close calls when I've had the green walk sign), so they're more likely to trust their eyes rather than rely on the traffic signal alone."

As such, I tried to behave as much like a car as possible. In 6 years riding around Chicago, I only crashed once as a result of a car (a semi(or bus, don't remember) pulled a left in front of me when I had a stale green to continue across Grand/Fairbanks Southbound on Fairbanks, and I pulled my front brakes to avoid hitting him while waving at him with my right hand.... my dumb fault)  There were times when I ran lights on Lower Kinzie Street because no one ever even drives there, and if it was pouring down rain and I had my laptop on my back, there were a couple times I ignored every traffic control device known to man, but 99% of the time I stopped at signals and such and it worked out really well for me.

urbanplanning,384cmi,Chuckie66g,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:09:32 2015 UTC,"On point 1, I can understand this mentality when dealing with frequent stopsigns in residential areas - they are more of an annoyance than anything else, particularly when there's no traffic around.  On the other hand, while (driving) home from work last week, I watched a rider casually go through a red light (at a freeway offramp!) and then ride on the wrong side of the road for a block before cutting back across the lanes and making a right turn. I've ridden this route with my bike more than a few times, and while stopping for the lights can be annoying if you hit them at the wrong time, I'd rather not be dead.  When you're dealing with signals for potentially high-speed traffic, like a freeway feeder/offramp, you do NOT want to mess around, and it was pretty clear the guy barely slowed down before going through the intersection.

Owning property in the US is culturally important, as it's seen as a rite of passage, and part of the ""American Dream;"" and it's also a really great safety net as over period of time it's very unlikely that the property will actually lose value. Right or not, renting past age 30 is seen throwing money away.  I'm not asking for 5% down NINJA loans, like Canada has or the US had in 2006, just equal treatment for condo and home loans."

urbanplanning,37zcor,Winningdays,6,Mon Jun 1 02:57:57 2015 UTC,Don't tell me the NDP has sent out feelers regarding rent control...
urbanplanning,37zcor,WackyXaky,5,Sun May 31 18:21:21 2015 UTC,"Rent controls are very controversial and I still am not sure if they are a good policy or not, or if they only work when used in conjunction with other policies.  One thing is for sure, we need to look at countries like germany when it comes to housing related policies.  Only half the population owns there, the other half rents and renting is much more comfortable there, people have many more rights.  It doesn't matter if you rent or own, your home feels like your home.  They avoid property bubbles and speculation, and although the government helps build some affordable housing, most all the rental market is built by the private sector who all seem perfectly capable of following all the very pro-renter rules while still turning enough of a profit that construction is always profitable where genuine demand exists."
urbanplanning,37zcor,WackyXaky,1 point,Sun May 31 19:23:47 2015 UTC,"How would we go about enacting changes to make our policies more like Germany's? I would imagine there would almost have to be a cultural shift as people are still enamoured with the idea of buying over renting and renters are given much less attention. Even though it's becoming less and less feasible for younger people to buy, it seems it's becoming harder to rent in many of Canada's major cities. I read recently that Calgary is the Canadian city with the highest average rent despite the housing prices being well below those of Vancouver and Toronto among others. Why is this? I imagine that rent control might be a good option to curb this. I don't know much about the housing situation in Canada, but as a millennial who will soon be looking at either buying/renting on the long term, the housing situation looks pretty scary and I'd like to become more informed. It looks like the housing situation is exacerbating an already problematic gap in wealth between younger people and recent immigrants (renters/people unable to buy) against wealthier, established Canadians (owners)."
urbanplanning,37zcor,Himser,4,Sun May 31 20:38:10 2015 UTC,"Rent control tends to exacerbate the problems with housing supply mostly because it creates unnatural fluctuations in development and the housing market. Rent control might sound like a good idea when you get in at the low price, but even then an individual quickly becomes tied to where they live because to rent anywhere new would be exorbitantly expensive. I don't know the specifics of Calgary, but generally prices are higher whenever supply is constrained. In many American cities like LA, San Francisco, Austin, New York, etc, housing prices have skyrocketed because supply is severely constrained due to zoning policies. People living in neighborhoods experiencing high demand often oppose any sort of development that would expand housing stock and thus keep prices generally affordable. Rent control only serves to help put barriers to increasing housing stock while doing little to make housing affordable except for a select few."
urbanplanning,37zcor,Tweeeked,4,Mon Jun 1 00:14:56 2015 UTC,"In short, yes, planning and policy surrounding development is usually the main driver of housing prices. If housing is getting unusually expensive, this is often (not always) due to constraints put on new development. Often existing residents will push politicians to pass zoning codes that increase the cost of development and limit the amount of new housing stock coming onto the market (parking requirements are a good example of increasing the cost of development and low density residential zoning are an example of limits on how much new housing can be built). Of course, there are good policies that increase development costs, such as building and safety standards to help prevent fires, but the key is to really look at what is important for safety and what is merely something that prevent change and development because existing residents are uncomfortable with any change whatsoever."
urbanplanning,37zcor,Himser,4,Mon Jun 1 00:19:40 2015 UTC,Yes zoning policies such as Edmontons no more then 3 unrelated people per dwelling are huge inhibitors to housing stock increases. Mix that with very little (and risky to the developer) rezoneing and very little infill density increases are happening.   Rent controls only make the problem worse. Right now a small developer cannot build a rental property brand new and make money because density is severally restricted. Yes a small developer can buy an old house and rent out for profit. But building new at our legislated rates is unsustainable and one of the reasons even with the current rental stock growing we have a 1% vacancy and high rent prices. Ive done the math for my own projects i need at least 2 million to build a rental property that is even marginally profitable under our current regulations. If Alberta was serious about lowering rent costs get rid of SFD zoning and force municipalities to have a minimum zoned density in urban areas of 32-48 dwellings per hectare(every hectare zoned density) and the market will fix the problem of high rent and low availability in a relatively short period of time.
urbanplanning,37zcor,Planner_Hammish,2,Mon Jun 1 06:44:48 2015 UTC,"Yes zoning policies such as Edmontons no more then 3 unrelated people per dwelling   Wait, how is that legal? In planning we regulate use but we can't regulate for a specific tenant. It seems like discrimination to say four blood-relatives can live in the same house as roommates but as soon as they're unrelated they can't live in the same house. Maybe I'm missing something though..."

urbanplanning,37tvsf,victornielsendane,45,Sat May 30 10:16:08 2015 UTC,"This is ridiculous. ""Vertical sprawl""? Well it's either that or horizontal sprawl (either as suburbs, exurbs or rural living) which is much worse for community, city life/culture and basically unsustainable. And for what? Your view out the window?  Also pretty much all of these arguments only apply to single-use zones residential high-rises. A proper mixed-zone high density neighbourhood with good transit access is plenty vibrant. The street is always busy, there's no lack of seeing people's faces. Chance encounters are as high as they are likely to get outside a small town/village (and I still fail to see what on earth floor count has to do with that... do people just randomly walk into people's houses if their building has less than 5 floors? what? it has far more to do with walkability). And no, most highrises are not ""luxury units"", even in ridiculous bubble markets like Portland and Vancouver. They are regular units for regular people - they just price out regular people due to the state of the market. And while condos are expensive, their lower density equivalents (town houses etc) are far more expensive still!   The amount of tortured logic going into this article just to make for an attention-grabbing headline is infuriating."
urbanplanning,37tvsf,rubyruy,12,Sat May 30 15:55:54 2015 UTC,"Seriously. It is possible to live in a typical suburban sprawl neighborhood for years and know zero of your neighbors, because your life basically consists of house>car>work/store>house. High rise buildings have just as much for chance encounters as anywhere else, and actually I'd argue they have MORE chances - by bumping into your neighbors between your front door and the lobby, for instance. It's also more common not to have a car in a high-density city, so you encounter MORE people on your commute to work (unlike a commute from suburbia to the office, where your only chance encounter is either the Starbucks barista in the drive-thru, or the other party of a fender bender)."
urbanplanning,37tvsf,melimsah,6,Sat May 30 18:26:15 2015 UTC,"I agree that this is a bit radical, but it does have some points that architects and city planners should consider when building highrises.   If you read Jan Gehls ""Cities for People"" you will find more valuable arguments for buildings being at the height of 5 floors, but he also makes positive remarks about New York.   Edit: He also says you should invite people to the streets, and the more you build up, the less inviting it is. It's not just about the neighbours, it's about meeting the city outside."
urbanplanning,37tvsf,bbqroast,6,Sat May 30 19:59:08 2015 UTC,Erm why is it less inviting?   It just means there's more people with access to those streets.

It's not being out in the suburbs, but it does affect the decision to go out for a quick bite etc (like a gated community in some ways) since it takes some time. Not horrendous. Also, too many high rises does create a certain effect. I think it shows in many places in New York. You can have a plaza shopping area where it won't be affected, but it makes a difference in other places."

The only places where the city is proposing the extending the 460' height limit is the southern end of downtown by Portland State University. The allowable heights in the Pearl (downtown in all but name) are also being increased, but only to 250'.   Think of the South Waterfront in Portland, a sea of speculative high-rises that largely remain empty.   While that might have been true in 2009 (not a great year for selling condos) it's not true today, or in 2014 when the article was written. The buildings are all fully occupied, and there's now the critical mass of people required to support neighborhood retail. Quite a few businesses have opened there in the past year."

That while new urban and smart growth principles should be the guidelines of any new development, the fact of the matter is that most people live in auto-centric, mostly suburban metropolitan areas. So if you want to test something most applicable to our current physical plant, the urban design would be the most appropriate.   It is a good idea.  On the other hand, the article is garbage, confusing urban planning, which focuses on the interaction between people and the built environment, with full-scale technological trials in an urban environment.

Or look at Chicago with the redeveloped Riverwalk that looks to draw thousands of people down to the river. Sorry if I got a bit off track, I was just discussing rivers with my planning friends.  Logistically though, it does cost a lot of money, you have to think about the environments you will be disturbing as well as the wildlife that has flourished close to the outflow of the river. Also how that outflow will effect the current just outside the city. Toronto is looking at redirecting the end of the Don River because when they redirected it the first time, it totally messed with the ecosystem and pretty much ruined the entire river for ecosystems.

There are plenty of examples of redirected rivers, most having been completed prior to the mid-20th century, and very few rivers, especially in cities, that haven't been modified in some way or another.   New York redirected the Harlem River to improve navigation as well as made plenty of other modifcations over the years. The Chicago River was extensively modified from practically a small creek to a major waterway. The little town I grew up in had it's small river both straightened and channeled (with massive concrete walls) as a flood control measure to prevent disastrous floods every decade or so. Dublin's river was modified too, as I recall, to accommodate a section of the Grand Canal.  Rivers would often be dammed or have weirs installed for various reasons such as for navigation, flood control, fishing, or to power riverside mills. Similarly to mills, if you wanted to get radical you could install some kind of hydroelectric power generations system. There are also a few examples of portions of a river being built over entirely, so they run underground or at least under the city. By eliminating a river entirely you also eliminate a massive traffic logjam to both vehicles and pedestrians.   As for disadvantages, well foremost you'll destroy the natural environment, though, since it's a city you've likely done that anyway. You can also impact things downstream, especially wetlands, by reducing or increasing the flow of water, and harbors, by increasing sediment deposits or increasing water flow (say it washes away a sandbar that previously protected a harbor from major storms). You can, and most likely will, destroy fish habitats with extensive modifications as well, especially channelization.   Rivers can be a tourist spot, often with riverside paths and walkway, tourist boats, and whatnot. The Liffey serves that purpose for Dublin as well, you'd lose millions of dollars a year without it. Improve the river too much and you open yourself up to commercial interests wanting to use the river and a need to raise bridges (and approaches to bridges) to accommodate ships and use your previous riverside land for factories or docks."
urbanplanning,37prcq,the_broccoli,1 point,Sat May 30 06:53:18 2015 UTC,"Take annual and semi-annual flooding into account.  Take the Mississippi River. This river floods somewhat frequently as part of its natural cycle (every year, I think, or close to it), which is good for the Mississippi River Valley, which remains healthy and fertile, and the aquifer below, which gets recharged, and the forests and general environment, which gets cleaned. Humans had taken advantage of this cycle for millennia before the European invasions. When new groups of people came and built cities in the floodplain, it created major problems for the people of those cities, who get flooded with the yearly cycle. The solution has been to dam up the river, to attempt to force it into particular channels rather than allow it to flow freely as it has, which has negative effects on the entire valley.  For this reason, you should take elevation into account if building too close to a river. Rivers are not canals. They shift and change and meander. They form new loops and new arcs. They bring fertility and health to riverine lands for miles on both sides. How frequently does Dublin flood?  Maybe by building mounds and putting all structures on higher ground, you can avoid flooding in the city. But then wouldn't the river undercut the mounds and make it dangerous? I'm just thinking out loud here.  What about building the city a healthy distance away from the river, but digging an S-shaped canal to run through the new city, to facilitate water transport? Maybe a series of gates or something to be opened and closed during flood season?"

I am really interested in what city's transit inspires your optimistic estimate of it being generally OK and everywhere it needs to be   Transit use has grown by 60% since 1972, in the US. Transit registers roughly 10.5billion passenger trips per year, with the headiest increases amongst heavy-rail and particularly light-rail, at 3.7billion trip in 2012 and 450million respectively. Throw in commuter rail's numbers 470million per year and the prognosis looks different.   Uber competes with segments of the transit universe (buses in particular), but it doesn't compete and isn't ""beating"" the real heavy-hitters in heavy-rail, commuter rail, and light rail. Why is that? Well it's an issue of scale, distance, and capacity. Uber will never suffice for rapid high-capacity transit, it won't suffice for long-haul CR service (CR accounts for only 5% of transit ridership, but 20% of passenger miles), it's ""sweet spot"" is the intermediate, the gaps in the transit system, the gaps that are somewhat impossible to solve in some cases since transit isn't really about door-to-door travel. This isn't a war, it's collusion.   Transit agencies should certainly explore the opportunities from the tech industry in regards to dispatching, customer service, comfort of travel, and accessibility (like putting up a fucking countdown sign) - high ridership doesn't absolve them of the need to constantly improve, but it also doesn't mean that transit and the uber/lyft/bridj's of the world are somehow threatening or enemies.   Take Bridj for example, and it's success. Why does it work? It fills in the gaps in Boston's network - the transit system in Boston developed from a streetcar-transit node transfer to-rapid transit, the whole bus system is set up as feeder routes and the transit system is almost entirely radial. There's this massive gap in circumferential transit that Bridj steps into and succeeds, it's siphoning off a few riders from the crosstown busses, but those are already way over capacity as it is - transit benefits from this immensely, customers benefit from this, the city benefits from this - I fail to see why Boston and other agencies should compete.

Busways need to be paved with high-grade cement, signal priority needs to be installed, level-boarding platforms are very expensive - the real cost savings is in vehicle procurement and initial capital outlay. Ops costs depend on the route, it's cheaper to run one bus vs. one LRV, but if you need to stock a route with a lot of busses to meet demand then that ops costs in going out-strip light rail.   In the end, BRT is a bit of red herring - just make the busses work better (queue jumps, bus-only at grade lanes, all-door boarding, etc..), going full BRT isn't a necessity in most place. It's just a question of capacity, not cost for choosing one mode over the other as you say, BRT isn't a ""surface subway"", but it's awesome on those ""not-quite enough for high-capacity rail"" routes, I'd love to see more of that, but otherwise I think ""BRT"" kinda distracts from that conversation because it promises something it can rarely deliver (same service at a low cost - you can't cheap out on transit)"

Every morning rush (while colleges are in session) is hell because of the number of riders who're taking the bus to school. The buses become full and end up leaving passengers at each stop. Passengers at later stops can be passed by multiple busses in a row. Adding more buses seems like a silly solution because this problem only exists for a small portion of the line. Maybe a mini shuttle could relieve congestion without having to run a more buses that'll sit empty for the rest of the route.

Many things demanded for everyone by today's building regulation are things that the entire market doesn't want to pay for. Innovation is the process of finding these things, and it can't reasonably do so without a loose regulation frame that allows it to do away with things.  What regulation should remain is to establish expectations between neighbouring properties, with fire management being the major suspect. What happens contained inside a property should be fully up to the property's owners and tenants and their mutual agreements. That's a hotbed for innovation."

I balance this knowing that some goals won't work in all areas, but I would not be doing the public a service by not trying at all.  I think the regulator/market relationship is a positive thing.  Some of the best innovation comes from being restricted.  When options are taken away, clever individuals find out how to best exploit those restrictions for their benefit.

Could the slow pace, then, stem from the fact that REMOVING the mistakes (like demolishing a housing project or re-configuring a street grid) is also expensive? If the Apple Watch, for example, flopped, they could just shelve it for very little additional cost. A new planning development takes tremendous investment to develop, but also remove.  Edit: This also doesn't explain why countries in, say, Northern Europe ARE innovating at a breakneck pace. I studied in Copenhagen for a few months and the amount of fresh ideas in urban design there is staggering."
urbanplanning,37jqgq,beansworth,5,Thu May 28 21:05:44 2015 UTC,"But venture capitalists don't flinch when they see a totally new idea in business.    Yeah, you're right-- venture capitalists aren't financing real estate development because it moves too slow and unlike a corporation, a building isn't easy to merge, break apart, spin off, sell off assets from it, dissolve it, etc..  Northern European countries are innovating in urban planning because there is money to do so. The governments charge taxes and people pay them. Unlike in the US where city government budgets seem to have been on a downward spiral for the last 40 years."
urbanplanning,37jqgq,NehemiahM,8,Thu May 28 23:10:08 2015 UTC,"I would say that is simply the nature of the beast. I am a student as well and I would have to say that the process of development is like the movement of a glacier. There are so many moving pieces and varieties of scale that is hard for new ideas to come to fruition.   There is also a ton of vested interests that have to be convinced in order for anything to get done. You have government officials, developers, corporations, small businesses, neighborhoods and individuals all trying to promote a different vision. So it is hard enough to get something tried and true done let alone something visionary."
urbanplanning,37jqgq,CantabKBH,10,Thu May 28 03:43:24 2015 UTC,"Be careful about the ""new"". Many zoning regimes derive from the 1930ish-Post-War era, they serve political objectives as much as they serve planning objectives. I'm not a fan, particularly not of the old modernist ""divvy up the city into separate res, retail, business zones"" model, but the salve for that issue isn't necessarily ""new"" or ""innovative"". There are myriad examples of good urban areas in the US, the Commonwealth countries, Europe, etc, etc - I think it's far more useful to study how these areas came to be, what forms of tech and circumstance (construction, materials, transportation) enabled their growth, how they operate in the contemporary city, and then extrapolate those lessons to modern city planning.   Take the brownstone blocks in New York or the brick apartment buildings - a lot these were built during the late 1800s, they were built according to available materials and in vernacular architecture of that time and were built to make use of rapid transit which was developing contemporaneously - we can look at a block like that now, look at why it works (is it the architecture, the street wall, the density, the living spaces, the street width, the access to the subway, etc.) and use that.  We don't have to reinvent the wheel for every problem. But I'm more of a transport guy than anything so take it with a grain of salt."
urbanplanning,37jqgq,3fox,7,Thu May 28 11:06:25 2015 UTC,"Well, if you accept walkability as a goal, a lot of the rest will follow simply from human physiology (scale, transit etc.), and physiology changes even more slowly than the planning profession."
urbanplanning,37jqgq,AG74683,4,Thu May 28 04:33:21 2015 UTC,"Most projects that warrant a budget will be routine copies of other projects, with changes occurring very close to the surface elements. I can say this without knowing anything about doing planning professionally - it's true in fields that are externally ""creative and fast-moving"" too, like games or software, both of which I know well. ""Fail fast"" amounts to guess and check, and it's still a hill-climbing method where you do something only if it makes money. If you can't constantly think about the bottom line, you can't operate a business. I've thought a lot about the nature of creative work, and here is my advice.  If you want to do visionary things, you have to go somewhere where there is either ""money to waste"", like a research program - or figure out a DIY method, which may or may not take a commercial form, and may or may not become your full-time gig. Most of the funding and most of the jobs tend to appear around the momentarily popular stuff and the ""they'll be up in arms if we don't"" stuff - neither of those are innovation centers. And the rewards for succeeding at a bold vision can be fleeting. If you only manage the visionary part, you'll mostly be treated as a weirdo (who hangs out with other cool weirdos). If you manage the popular part(whether or not it's visionary), you feel like an imposter. And if you discover the intersection of visionary and popular, you're ridiculously lucky but most likely still feel like a weird imposter. And it's ultimately a two step process: Find the motivation to try out something that should be obvious but that nobody paid attention to, and then follow through by finding the motivation to realize it in a way which is appealing to the public. Just managing one of those two is hard enough on its own. Sometimes one person does one and then a second person rolls in to get the credit for the other.  Either way, if you want to make discoveries applicable to speeding up planning, a practical approach that might appeal to you is to consider each part of the existing process and determine a way to automate: By reducing the design space, either cut the cost of doing the work, improve the iteration time on feedback, or improve the quality of the results.  For example, we used to build maps and scale models of new architecture by hand. After computerizing the workflow, routine tasks are done faster, stakeholders can ask for changes and get faster turnaround times, and fewer human-error mistakes are possible because the software enforces constraints based on our assumptions about physics and geometry.  Automation tends to lead towards designing down. Apple's electronics, for example, consistently try to remove features that were considered essential in prior devices - the things formerly controlled by the user are replaced with more ""default"" configurations with fewer options. Prefabricated buildings are pushed as a way to cut construction time and costs through uniform parts.   But at the other end of the tunnel automation opens up new design realms: The premise of a consistent touchscreen interface, connected to the internet, opened up a new space for software. As prefabs grow into a larger-scale business they can become more modular and present more options while retaining a lower cost basis. So dogged pursuit of incremental aspects of change can set the stage for later breakthroughs.  Another way is to capture the essence of the ideas in planning in a way which motivates new ways of thinking about it, without trying to be a ""real"" solution. Simcity and its ilk come to mind, of course: They aren't realistic sims, but they assert ideas about how the world works or should work and invite people to believe in it and support the underlying premises. Like other media, these games both entertain and communicate a message - some games, like the A-Train series, push the idea of development occurring around transit access. Others, like Simcity 2013, are most concerned with ""traffic management"", pushing an automobile-first approach. These kinds of perspective shifts, however you present them, can be a powerful force for changing process and culture."

urbanplanning,37jqgq,mrpopenfresh,3,Thu May 28 15:10:44 2015 UTC,"In planning education there is a quite understandable tendency to standardize and simplify things so that the student can understand concepts without being bogged down in complexity.  But the real challenges come in trying to apply the good ideas to real life situations -- complete with the quirks and weirdness and unexpected obstacles that eventually form into mind-boggling complexity.   I think many planning profs avoid going into too enough depth about the politics surrounding the planning process because it gets in the way of their pet ideas and, also, they may just not have a great deal of expertise in that arena.  You talk about slow pace impeding meaningful change -- but the fact is we're not just talking about lines on a map here. Planning goes slow because it is important and it can have major impacts -- for better or worse -- on peoples lives in a very real way. So of course people are going to be skeptical of rapid change! I'm not trying to justify extreme NIMBYism but it's much more than that. When decisions about important things close to peoples lives are made, people need (and rightfully deserve) information and time to process. People want an deserve to have their voices heard. And this is all just adding to the complexity -- any good idea that doesn't account for the desires of politicians and the public is essentially no idea at all.   I know this is getting long-winded but consider two possible roles of the planner - the planner as visionary and the planner as technician. The technician's job is to take an agreed-upon decision, usually small in scope, and figure out how it can be achieved.   The visionary's job is to look forward into the future and develop a concept of how a place can or should evolve over time. In order to be a visionary, one needs more than just a MCP degree. It's a subjective and unavoidably political process that requires professional and political buy-in from large groups of people. In other words, the visionary is at least as much politician as technician and perhaps more so.   I have heard many students lamenting about how planning seems neutered, slow, powerless, etc. but to me that'a kind of like saying ""but why don't I get to be the mayor?!"""

When the ""urban renewal"" scheme failed spectacularly, in part due to grass-roots activism by people like Jane Jacobs, planners have given up more and more of their power to these activists. Now we are collectively no more than a voice in a choir; facilitators; paper pusher rubber stampers.   And with that, we have lost our ability and perhaps our credibility to make bold statements like ""Make Now Small Plans; they don't have the power to Stir Men's Blood"".

Nothing's walkable, you use a car to go everywhere.   Older, pre-car cities are of course walkable, but the modern profession of city planning just started looking at traditional layouts. Jane Jacobs was one of the early traditionalists, who defended the mixed use, walkable style of traditional cities. She one in Manhattan, but most American cities still weren't planned with walkability in mind for decades. The New Urbanist Movement is a bit extreme, but a lot of their ideas have been assimilated into main line planning. But that was the 80s.

We're using the same marking in two completely different uses. If I were a driver, I'd be very confused.  The idea behind the dashed green marking is to more clearly indicate that the the area is a mixing or weaving area where there is the potential for conflict.

I think this point is probably more true than any other:   Suburban living is still aspirational among many blacks.  The prevailing narrative for more than 60 years in this nation was that suburban living was the American Dream.  Most Americans were able to act on that dream.  They bought homes and later worked in jobs that moved closer to them.  Many blacks, however, were unable to act on the dream until the last 25-30 years or so -- redlining in urban cores meant little equity to use to buy a suburban home, and exclusionary zoning policies kept suburban home prices artificially high.  Furthermore, blacks often heard about how bad there communities were, full of crime, bad schools, substandard housing.  Today, many blacks are moving quickly to partake in the suburban dream that tens of millions of Americans have enjoyed for decades.   Decent and mostly interesting write up, though a little too anecdotal to apply to the entire black community based on the personal preferences of one guy's wife."

urbanplanning,37czkp,jun815,9,Thu May 28 16:02:02 2015 UTC,"While this is a good write up I think they miss some issues. One being that the near inner ring suburbs are, in a lot of cities, where the cheap housing is as downtowns become revitalized. In part I feel it's the same thing that caused the inner city ghetto in the first place. The great outrush of capital is once finding the city popular again and moving back in, forcing poor people out to the generally lackluster post-war housing stock of the inner ring suburbs. As before that rush of capital (and as the article points out) will not take into account the needs of the minority and poor in the slightest. I don't think the message of new urbanism getting to the black population is that significant a driver of what's happening."

Most of the visiting patients will be driving to the city, and the downtown Mayo buildings are linked via a fairly extensive Subway/Skyway system that includes most of the downtown hotels, government center, and mall.    Does walkable really mean the full exclusion of vehicles?  Especially considering the limited mobility of many patients and the climate, does it make sense to pair the pedestrian-exclusive Subway/Skyway system with lots of pedestrian-exclusive streets?  The plan does call for expanded bike lanes and closing off several more blocks of 2nd Avenue, 2nd Street, and a few others to vehicles (a while back, 2nd Ave was converted to a park/plaza between the Plummer and Mayo buildings, along with an expansion of the Peace Plaza, labeled ""Heart of the City"" on the plan).  The mixed use comment is on-point, and something Rochester severely lacks (something like 40% of the jobs in Rochester are located Downtown, and less than 1% of the population lives Downtown).  This is beginning to change with developments like Metropolitan Market Place (three floors of residential over the food co-op, East side of D15 on the plan), but unfortunately seems to fall outside of the vision presented by most developers interested in Rochester."

I didn't know they planned to replace the public library with a reflecting pool, though. Horrible idea that needs to be changed. Or hopefully a bigger and better library.

Both Google and Bing have the bus schedule built into their respective maps, when searching for directions you can choose between car, transit, and walking directions.  Light rail is included in the plan, but I don't foresee more than one stop at the airport, one or two stops in Downtown, maybe a stop at the Southern and Northern ends as a park-and-ride, then up to the Cities.  More of inter-city transit than intra-city.  Definitely agree about the library.  Tear down the hideous triangle apartment building across the street instead.

I don't know if my friends would want to take the trains.  I don't understand the trend of building sprawling senior housing complexes in Rochester. I drive by the new one on Mayowood Road every day, and it seems like most multi-family housing being constructed or that is new is seniors-only.

urbanplanning,37ektz,Braindrool,3,Wed May 27 01:34:26 2015 UTC,"You don't happen to be involved in citybound do you? Seems quite similar to what the devs over there have been trying to nut out. Maybe send them a pm if you looking for some more information there.  Unfortunately there's not a simple answer to any of these questions as they vary radically based on culture and other factors. So I'll try my best at answering these and if I'm wrong I'm sure some one will fly in a save the day.  Supply and demand and city expansion are pretty closely linked especially given the shift away from traditional city developments in the early 20th century. Long and short of it is architect's got a bit sick of the ineffective and un healthy urban form created following the industrial revolution and so jumped on the ideas creating distributed specialised centres. With the car becoming and increasingly more affordable commodity space and urban form was designed heavily to support this as a single use. Good examples of this would be Le Corbusier and Geddes and Howard (I think from memory he was the American).  Anyway, these designs basically got us into the mindset we have in modern cities of vehicle based transportation, distributed cities. Some of the reasons the US and Europe differ on this is differing ideologies. For memory I believe Howard drew up a plan with nice big grids and large plots of land, which Americans seemed to like so they ran with that for a bit. Whilst in Europe and throughput commonwealth ideas of the Garden city esque design sort of helped influence the radial approach.   What we have now is a greater understanding of how this suburban form influences the physical environment so there is a movement to intensify the existing centres and not spread out as much.  however, where I live especially,  there is a generational gap who see intensification similarly to what was built during the communist regime and what can be seen in Hong Kong and in Asia, insisting we expand outwards to relieve the pressure on house prices, and are highly resistive to change, what some would call NIMBY.  In terms of block structure, the simplest argument I've seen os the whole bid rent theory. Which is a safe diagram to get a basic understanding of the idea. Though in contemporary and mostly non American-centric cities this doesn't always apply. The further away from the city, the larger the land, the cheaper the price. Arguably it is preferential to have 100x100m blocks as this is better for walkability and urban form bur wether or not people give a shit about that in the real world is probably negligible in terms of actually influencing land value. And land value is a really tricky thing, because low quality housing in poorly designed lot will still sell for a ridiculous price deleting on the economic conditions, whilst a highly quality subdivision could sell for a lot more. Id argue that the structure of a block doesn't detrimentally effect it's value but larger better designed plot would increase its value, depending on the housing market. I've read papers that argue that opening up more land reduces current land value and I've read papers that argue that it can increase land value.    Where I live, we have a very large city which holds a significant portion of the population, jobs, cars and houses. Which creates a cycle of people only able to find work there and moving there creating and away from smaller cities and rural areas putting immense pressure on the growth of the city. Reading any council document you will see population growth and the need for housing as the number influence to manage the growth of the city. With the ability to import/export I don't think councils worry too much about how will we feed the people as that is determined by the market, it's more of an issue of how will we house these people.  I'm on my phone at the moment so I can understand this just being a massive mess of idea vomit. If any of this sounds like what you want, I'll sit down on my computer and really write it for you and find some sources for you too."

There's another variable that you missed, too, which is access/transportation. The shape of the city is highly dependent on the means by which people get around it. Early development was limited by reasonable travel distance for the working citizen on foot. As horse-drawn omnibus, electric streetcar and commuter rail became factors in transportation for the masses, cities expanded relatively tightly along those corridors. The automobile blew development patterns wide open and permitted very dispersed, low density development. Within the automobile era, different road networks have had varying influences on city grown and development (and, conversely, demand for transportation infrastructure has been influenced by land use patterns: chicken and egg sort of thing).  If you haven't already, you would benefit from looking into land value economics such as the work of von Thunen, Ricardo and Alonso. /u/TheSuitedNoob gave you a decent rundown of this."

They both point to the issue around power over the built environment, and where they lie. In the context of the UK (not sure how it is in the US) development has been increasingly monopolised by a few big housebuilders and commercial property developers. The private development of the past was mainly at a smaller scale, by individuals or companies with local connections, and this allowed attractive streets and squares to be built easier as local developers followed local custom and tradition.   Only when local government steps in to uphold standards (mainly in conservation areas now) can the scale effect on development be countered.

I am saying that in the normative and not the predictive sense.  If you do this to a street and it doesn't reduce congestion (i.e. automobile travel demand) then all you've done is build a cute street with traffic/parking costs that will be solved through expensive underground solutions mentioned in other comments or externalities on neighboring blocks. Sure, you've built some extra housing but if you need a build underground parking and are pushing the same or more (from new houses) demand into a reduced network, that could wipe away a significant portion of the benefit.

The narrow streets he shows as examples all evolved that way naturally. Even the dutch streets that were retrofitted to woonerf remained the same width, just with bump outs, etc. added. That's important because the utilities buried under the street didn't need to be moved. If the roadway of an SF street were to be converted into buildings, you'd have to rip out all the existing sewers, gas lines, etc. and move them under one of the old sidewalks.  Also, the buildings in that example SF street were designed to line a boulevard, not a narrow street. That photoshop of the street narrowed to 15 feet shows how their proportions look all wrong when the street is narrowed. The row of houses on the right are to scale with the street and engage with it at street level, the ones on the left loom over it and back away from it up those steps."

But it would be nicer if the author looked at this topic through the lens of a geographer, and I think because he didn't he got a few things wrong about Chongqing, which he chose to focus on. For me, at least, this took away from enjoying the article as much as I might have. pedantic rant below  Through the whole of the article Chongqing is classified as a historically isolated, land-locked city, the author even draws comparisons to cities like Denver and Calgary - implying that there could be lessons learned from these cities for Chongqing. This would be all good and well if the author picked almost any other inland city in China, but not Chongqing. Chongqing, which has historically been the regional center of the Sichuan basin (the most densely populated inland portion of China) for over a millennium is landlocked in the same sense that Chicago (which the author mentions but neglects to compare the two) is landlocked. By this I mean it's not functionally landlocked, because its on the navigable Yangtze River. People have been floating boats and rafts from Chongqing to the coast for ages. China's investments in Chongqing are similar to the US building up infrastructure around Chicago or the Twin Cities, currently Chongqing is a major inter-modal terminal (rail/truck to ship) for freight. Chongqing's port moves over 120M tons of freight annually (roughly 6X what Chicage moves). Of any inland City in China, Chongqing is the no brainer to pour development money into, and in Chongqing private investors can find a cheaper alternative to coastal locations (this isn't true for other inland Chinese cities). Positing that ""the path to transformative growth in these historically isolated cities is arduous"" is true to some extent for Chongqing, in that it's easy to overlook, and requires a lot of infrastructural investment to reach its potential. I wonder if an article like this would have be written about Chicago, Dusseldorf, or Cologne 100-200 years ago..."

The problem with the NYC subway is that it has too much interlining, causing slowdowns where lines merge and limiting how many trains can run.  Instead of improving the issue this will only make it worse; for example, his Cross Harlem line (T), shares track with two other lines, meaning you'll only be able to run as third as many trains as the tracks should allow (in fact less, because the other lines share track with so many others).  125th st is a high density corridor where such a limitation would be a huge hinderance, and the map is littered with such examples.  His routing is so convoluted I think even locals would get confused.  Look at the tangle of turquoise lines in Southeast Queens, can anyone decipher that?  There's other issues too, he's proposed a lot of terminals in places I just can't see being feasible either in terms of engineering or politics (Sunnyside, Flushing, East Harlem, ect).  As for the ""intracity rail,"" that I am on the fence about.  Clearly it's based on the London Overground, and I haven't heard much about that system.  However its usefulness I imagine would be severely limited by how many places it shares track with commuter and intercity rail, and it's hard to judge without knowing specific routing.

You can't just draw a bunch of lines on a map and expect everything to work.  If two lines share tracks, and then they split off, each branch has half as much service as they otherwise could.  It's a simple fact.  Lines here branch off and recombine with no concern for frequencies of service, but it will be a problem by design.  Look, I am all for subway expansion but this plan is not well thought out.  As for the terminals I mentioned, again it's quite nice to draw them on a pretty map, but I don't think they will be possible.  The 7 train in Flushing is already very deep, and he wants to put a subway terminal there, one with room for two lines to terminate.  How?  They're going to have to tear up one of the busiest intersections in the city, one of the busiest subway stations in the borough and busiest bus transfers, and also connect it to an existing subway station, which they will also be extending?

If you need to cross a wider road, you're often obliged to use a smelly underpass or a pedestrian bridge with lots of stairs (a pleasure for old folks!). Not to talk about new real estate development or TOKİ-quarters - those are in most cases monofunctional, dull, ugly and as car-oriented as can be. Don't get me wrong, this city is actually a wonderful example of a great, dense, vibrant and diverse city in most parts that were built before, let's say, the 1970ies, but urban hell in many other parts, due to gated communities popping up everywhere as well as a crazy focus on car infrastructure - they are actually still building elevated motorways here, while the rest of world cities is trying to get rid of them. Maybe  the old guard of traffic planners in the metropolitan municipality has been living under a rock.  The extreme pace of the metro network extension (which is a good and and overdue thing) also often leads to bizarre planning decisions and outcomes. The Kartal Metro for example ends in the middle of a highway intersection... maybe those planners are not walking themselves.

Irvine's up to 3800 people per sq mi with these new numbers, which is like 1/3 of what San Gabriel has, and San Gabriel is mostly single-family homes. Even Arcadia has a bit higher population density (~5000/sq mi). Some of that, admittedly, is that Irvine has more not-yet-developed land."

Sounds boring, but can be rewarding when you see a smile on a resident's face as you've saved them the headache and expense of getting a Variance through tweaking placement or recommending other changes.  New home permit applications are on a solid uptick, so plenty of those being reviewed since winter ended.  Usually, I'm just checking setbacks on these, and then kick them to the Building Commissioner, depending on the nature of the project. I'm in regular contact with all of the local home builders and commercial developers and their respective engineers, assisting with projects.  I coordinate all rezones, plat approvals, variances, and commercial development plans among a myriad of other things. Overall, I really enjoy my job.  It also helps that my staff is second-to-none and we try to have some fun at work.  I think I've fared better than some others that I see when I browse through the comment sections in this subreddit as far as the day-to-day.  That's probably due to my Town being fairly young and it's just awesome to see it advance, especially when it's a project that I helped with, or I see the results of a decision that I've made in the actual built environment.

urbanplanning,36ssto,Copernicus_27,3,Fri May 22 04:01:18 2015 UTC,"I'm a transportation planner working for a transit agency on the West Coast. My days are really too varied so I've just made a list of some of the things I do:   Plan review: making sure consultants have followed agency design guidelines (mostly already done by engineers), have taken into account local context outside of the site plan, are paying attention to important but overlooked issues like historical and environmental resources, and know how the project might relate to other initiatives going on in the area that can allow for collaboration/efficiencies. Sitting on committees: This can involve the local municipalities/counties, COG/MPO, and various other stakeholders to make sure everyone is on board for certain parts of a comprehensive plan, or coordination of ROW issues between transit agency and government since the municipalities own the facilities our buses operate on. If an area that our agency serves is doing a comprehensive plan, usually one of our planners is on the committee. Mapping: Maps are great decision making tools and few people can make them.  I end up using GIS to make maps for meetings for use as a decision making tool for anyone involved in the project.  Examples can be as simple as a location map or a map with joined Census information to effects of bus stop changes on residential catchments and access to employment centers in network analyst (which would also fall under the next section). Research/analysis: Looking at demographics to do a dirty ridership projection (larger projects generally use real travel demand modeling that would then be fed to me) and then making sure our facility from a bus stop to a station are sized properly. Reading codes to see what is allowed in an area, seeing if that fits our needs, and then understanding the process of requesting relief. Looking at new development in an area and seeing what changes will need to be made to service because of it. The examples are endless.  This is the meat of the job that makes me valuable when I sit on committees or review plans since I have experience doing these various analyses. Writing plans!: Using those above research/analysis skills, I will usually be involved in writing plans for the agency whether that's related to sustainability, accessibility, focus on an area, something more comprehensive. A lot of the work is disseminating the thinking into the organization. Project management: Making sure the engineers talk to the environmental folks and that they all listen to the public and political stakeholders and that they actually submit their documentation on time so that we don't have to delay out report again just because Timmy makes an excuse again about why he can't do his job. Talking to coworkers/sharing knowledge: If you become an expert on a subject, someone from some department will find out and ask you about it.  You will informally talk to them and help some their problems and it will take up a decent amount of your time, but it is valuable for the organization. Or, maybe I just know someone who works at the city who can expedite an engineer's project so they ask. Memo writing: Making sure everything is clearly documented so that others can understand what has been agreed to is both tedious and incredibly important to progress.  Management doesn't live the daily decision process since they are vaguely keeping track of hundreds of projects so you need to have material ready to brief them.   My job is great.  It can be tedious, but I generally know that what I'm doing will benefit the place I live.  Seeing increased ridership or on time performance after route changes I've made is great.  Knowing that there's a bike rack at a park and ride because I made a comment and then seeing it used is also a good feeling. Making your area a better place tends to turn frustrations into challenges that you must overcome.  Edit: I should be clear, I've been working for about a decade.  I know some younger planners who work in the private sector and almost only do research/analysis.  Now, that could be fun and I'm sure sometimes is, but I have at least one friend who works for a firm that seems to do one simple type of work and he just does the same type of thing over and over.

urbanplanning,36pvlc,robbie9000,2,Thu May 21 04:16:00 2015 UTC,"Is it just me or does this not make sense at all?  The city plans to charge residents/businesses storm water fees based off of square footage of roof area.  Wouldn't it make more sense to charge based off of the percentage of roof square footage compared to the rest of the parcel?  For instance, the home is 3,000 sq. ft., but it's on a lot that's 2 acres.  To me, that resident's yard takes care of a majority of runoff naturally, through grass, plantings, and trees.  Take that same home, put it on a parcel that's 0.25 acres, then an increase in storm water fee would be justified.    Mississauga's chart seems completely backwards.  Townhome/row houses, that by design, do not have much of a yard to speak of, could quite reasonably be expected to pay in the top range of the storm water fee scale.  Water from these properties likely runs off of the roof, and almost directly into the storm sewer with very little travel overland, if any.    Assuming that Mississauga has a proper Zoning Code, the easiest way to do this would have been to assign the different zoning classifications (which SHOULD each have different setback and lot coverage requirements) with a different fee and scale appropriately.  EDIT:  After posting this, it occurred to me that I didn't address situations with ""Planned Development"" zoning.

More active people are healthier, they're more productive, efficient, happier. All of these things contribute to the economy, rather than drain it. Unfit people tend to be sick more (mentally and physically), therefore less productive (earn and spend less) and draining on the health care system.  Enviormentally, less people driving around (better air quality, less noise pollution, less fossil fuel use), less need for mega parking lots (habitat, green space, better for drainage).

Infrastructure for cycling is WAY cheaper than for cars as road-costs are a forth to sixth-order relation to axle weight. A car weighs ~15-25x what a bike weighs, so roads for cars are ~204 = ~160,000 times more expensive to build than paths for just bikes. Exercise before work increases engagement ...the reasons just go on and on   There was recently a study in Denmark that combined all of these various factors and more and found:   The study by Stefan Gössling and his colleague also shows that if we only look at costs/benefits for society, one kilometre by car costs EUR 0.15, whereas society earns EUR 0.16 on every kilometre cycled. - source   This doesn't even touch the social benefits of being able to interact with the people around you as humans instead of metal boxes. The fact that exercise is one of the best anti-depressants in existence. Or that biking with your kids is SO much more fun than driving with them.  So do I agree that biking is good for the economy? Adamantly yes. Just not for the reasons the article is citing.  ...however, I do recognize that the US as it's built now cycling as a main form of transportation for the majority of the population is not a reality. At least not yet. But there is a lot more benefit to putting money towards cycling than to put money into another highway overpass."

As others have noted, the economic activity generated directly from the bicycle industry is tiny, and the indirect effects that they outline (tourism, real estate value) are similarly marginal. If your goal is simply to increase GDP (which is generally what people mean when they describe something as ""good for the economy"") then this article does not provide a strong argument.  Personally, bicycling is justified on a quality of life basis. I can afford to live basically anywhere, but I will never choose to live somewhere that I cannot bike. Despite economists best wishes I do not make a qualified judgement in this case - I will stop participating in the modern economy before I give up bike-able, walkable neighborhoods.  If you do want to make an economic case for biking, I think it should hinge on commute throughput for profitable white collar jobs (software engineers, healthcare workers, lawyers, government bureaucrats, researchers, and other kinds of knowledge economy technocrats). You could also make a strong case based on the externalized environmental costs of alternatives (higher health care costs due to low levels of physical activity, poor air quality, and the ultimate threat of global warming)."

Somehow everybody involved seems to prefer thes GDP-harming jams.

Are we calling a bike what's, like /u/vanneapolis said, probably laying around in a basement somewhere part of it or are we calling biking the entire industry and the lifestyle associated with it? If it's the latter, I think so. Besides the costs of accessories and bikes themselves, jobs for infrastructure and bicycle tourism, jobs for bike maintenance and bikeshare systems, less healthcare costs from healthy lifestyles associated with biking, there's more money left over for the consumer. It depends how this money gets used and whether it gets used, but I think it leads to spending in local service economies, thus helping the local economy with a spill over effect."

I would absolutely prefer public transportation, bicycling and walking but I wouldn't ever say that it is the economics that led me there.  Think of the average cost to operate a car for a month versus operating a bike.  I bet a car is $300 per month on average with gas, car payments, insurance and repairs.  I have spent nowhere near that on my bicycle, and I ride quite a bit.  To keep rambling, I have paid off my car, and not replacing it with a new car is hurting the economy.

People would spend it on other things, most probably on services (whereas drivers spend their money on goods and basic natural ressource). The economy would work differently.  Just look at any city where most people don't own cars, either because they bike (Copenhagen or Amsterdam) or because they rely on foot and transit (NYC, Tokyo, etc). People spend way more money on restaurants, clothes, entertainment, instead of cars. Housing is more expensive and it also leaves more leverage to tax people to pay for public services."

What you have presented is an iteration of the broken-window fallacy.  In the short run, everyone spending money on their cars is stimulative of economic exchange, but in the long run that isn't true.   Nearly everyone being forced to purchase and operate a car doesn't contribute to the economy through their spending money.  It contributes to the economy through enabling them to be more productive - increasing the breadth of employment they can seek and increasing the breadth of employees a business can hire.  But, as you said, you skipped the negatives. The whole reason so many people need a car to participate productively is that decades of subsidies for cars and freeways and pavement and parking have re-arranged society to be spread out and difficult to access without a car, and this has come at the considerable expenditure of public funds that could have been allocated elsewhere or not collected in the first place.   Without this sort of subsidy, society wouldn't have become so spread out, and fewer people would have needed to own cars to maximize their choice of employment, to run errands, or generally live life, and would have lived in many more walkable, more transit-able communities, and many have argued that these communities would be naturally more economically productive, in the manner of that many remaining walkable cities have been.  In so far as a great many people are forced to own and operate cars when they might not otherwise have done so this represents a significant, ongoing, breaking of their windows.  Had this not happened, people would have taken the money they would have spent on cars and spent it on other things, or saved it for the future (thereby making it available for others to borrow) and the range of economic choice would be greater."

That means that a 200 mile commute which would take 11 gallons of fuel, round-trip, and 3 hours 36 minutes each way (!) at 55 MPH would instead consume 32 gallons of fuel, round-trip, and 1 hour and 17 minutes each way, which is almost twice the capacity of its 18 gallon tank.

It would be best to focus your essay on what it is that interests you about urban planning, what your passions are, and how the program can help you achieve your future professional aspirations in the field. I've also noticed that programs really pay attention to those applicants with unconventional backgrounds and niche interests.  Maybe you could somehow tie in your experience as a pet groomer to something related to planning...perhaps your interactions with clients over the years have given you perspective on a macro trend related to urban life, or maybe that pet grooming establishments serve as a proxy for a particular type of economic development...idk...just throwing stuff out there.

I moved to downtown KC before it opened and it's been insane how much downtown has changed and improved since and with the streetcar coming it's picking up even more steam.  The area would still be a ghost town if the city didn't make that investment but now it's turning into a happening/livable area.   It was a worthwhile project IMO and a much better investment than spending that much on suburban highways."
urbanplanning,36ehb7,DnWeava,1 point,Mon May 18 22:24:39 2015 UTC,"I'll just say that I'm not religiously against these deals. They're at least better than most stadium deals, but here's where it comes down to brass tacks;    The city guaranteed the ($295 million) debt under the assumption that new businesses and development in the district would generate $18 million to $20 million in taxes to cover the bond’s annual debt service, allowing the city to repay the bond without digging into its already strained general budget. The project would pay for itself, Mayor Kay Barnes argued back in 2006 when defending the project to skeptics in the City Council and press.  Barnes was off. Way off. The district opened just before the economy crashed. Its thousands of square feet have been slower to lease than anticipated. Annual tax revenues generated in the district have ranged from $4.5 million to $5.4 million in the past few years, according to the city. That means that taxpayers are left on the hook for 70 to 75 percent of the money needed to pay down the debt each year, paying anywhere from $14.9 million in fiscal year 2014 to a projected $8.5 million this fiscal year, according to a recent article in the Kansas City Star.   I live in a smaller city that has done this on a smaller scale a number of times and they've all failed. The latest plan is a AAA baseball stadium/hotel/shopping arcade. The tax revenue projections look almost as misleading as this one.   As a tax payer, I'm ok with this stuff if the tax revenue projections are realistic and the city isn't forever on the hook paying towards a failed project where the private sector folks have already cashed out and maybe made a little. If it's so attractive an idea why does the city need to put up bonds? Answer: It probably isn't, but politicians always need their golden calves to point to and developers know how to play them.  That's nice that you have a supermarket downtown, but how much should the  rest of the city taxpayers pay for you're convenience?  Also, an urban core city won't be putting up bonds for suburban highways most likely. The choice is probably about money for schools, etc."
urbanplanning,36ehb7,RaiderRaiderBravo,3,Tue May 19 04:17:23 2015 UTC,"KC is both an urban core city AND suburban one. It comprises over 300 square miles in its city limits.  Yeah, it's horrible. The actual suburbs are also terribly sprawled.  Power and Light District has done A LOT for our Downtown. It doesn't matter how much the city paid for it. If it hadn't happened, and they not built the arena adjacent, it'd still be dead as a door nail with no real reason for anyone to go there.  Now we have over 5,000 housing units planned or under construction, the population has already doubled from 10,000 in 2000, to over 20,000 now. With just the units currently planned for he coming years, it will add another 10,000 people.  We just had the city announce a 30-40 floor, 800 unit hotel with Hyatt just two to three blocks from Power and Light. Cornish is just finishing up the first 20+ story apartment tower with the second to begin construction later this year.  The streetcar is being built and spurring on billions of dollars of investment. All of this probably wouldn't have happened without the Power and Light District."
urbanplanning,36ehb7,UrbanKC,2,Thu May 21 03:32:12 2015 UTC,but how much should the rest of the city taxpayers pay for you're convenience?   Probably the same amount that city center dwellers pay for suburbanites to have convenience of roads and utilities sent to all their houses individually.

Other than the two new towers that were mentioned in the article, there are half a dozen older buildings that are being remodeled into apartments.  Would this boom have happened if the city didn't invest in things like the Power and Light District and the Sprint Center? I'm not sure, but I doubt it.

This is backed up in the article by efficiency measurements for volume control.    All that sounds great, except that the problem with car-centric transportation isn't the efficiency of flow.  The way you solve transportation problems is by eliminating car trips or shortening them with good urban design principles.  Driverless cars is just another streamlined efficiency measure- no different from the invention of superhighways- as they are designed to move traffic volume in a more efficient way.  This has always caused more problems than it has solved, as it encourages people to live further away from the things that they need.

urbanplanning,36dsc1,DataSetMatch,2,Mon May 18 20:27:44 2015 UTC,"It'd take more than that.  One of the biggest problems is that most of the buildings downtown are owned by one person who bought them on the assumption that riverboat gambling would be legalized.  That didn't happen and he is currently pretty much incommunicado and in legal dispute with the town.    There are, I believe, currently three functioning businesses between the two bridges, along with the town historical society/art gallery.  Most of the main buildings are in an advanced state of decay, even the ones whose facades are intact.  Last year, the fire chief had to write an open letter to the town council stating that he wouldn't risk his men trying to save many of the structures.  The last business tenants in the large Union Station left when the owner gave them space heaters for their offices because he was no longer going to attempt to light the old furnace and heat the entire structure.  There's really nothing left.  On the hill, the town does boast many beautiful and historic homes, as well as a large mansion with great views over the river (Nemacolin Castle), but these are geographically separated from the business district.  People who live there do not work or shop in town.  Most of the churches, the last remaining cultural institutions and civic touchstones, are north of the 4 lane slash through the middle of town.  (Why they were all built so far out originally, I don't know.  Long range, the only real hope is that the current owner of downtown will finally be forced out by sheriff's sale all at once, allowing the whole downtown to be razed and rebuilt along a master plan.  This, of course, would require massive angel investment and a good number of business owners willing to stick in for the long haul.  Since the road was rerouted, there is no reason to go to Brownsville, except to go there.  So, until the town creates its own reason, it can't expect anything to fall its way."

urbanplanning,36b40y,MrDowntown,4,Mon May 18 03:26:01 2015 UTC,Yet cities didn't allow the railways to cut through cities the same way thus why railways went to elevating and tunnelling segments of rail lines in major cities.  Also they already had a system where railways moved goods to/from depots in the cities where trucks only had to worry about moving goods the final few miles.
urbanplanning,36b40y,Psy1,1 point,Mon May 18 15:53:54 2015 UTC,"As labor costs rose, the problem of moving boxes and bags from railcar to local truck became a burden for that system.  Long-distance trucking took the goods from dock to dock, with no delays for transshipment or for one boxcar to be moved out of the middle of a train and delivered by local switcher.  American railroads focused on the more profitable movement of bulk materials and, eventually, containers, leaving ""loose-car"" railroading as a historic curiosity."
urbanplanning,36b40y,MrDowntown,1 point,Mon May 18 23:18:54 2015 UTC,"In the 1920s, the railroads actually developed an early intermodal system with small containers that could be easily loaded onto the era's trucks that solved that problem quite handsomely, but the Interstate Commerce Commission decided to quash the system by insisting on uneconomic rates."

This was done so industry didn't need a full railcar load to efficiently ship something by rail, multiple containers were put on a railcar.    Also with the cars being rated for 95 kph it allowed JNR to offer express freight service for light freight, allowing them to ship light container fright faster then by truck."

I've heard the same story told in the article many times - that interstates were mostly motivated by political interests (e.g. Eisenhower's emergency plan, and to some extent automotive company lobbying). Looking at the before/after pictures, it seems like cities had managed to achieve significant density without freeways. It's not intuitive to me that freeways allow better commercial/industrial access than traditional streets."
urbanplanning,36b40y,jrmrjnck,5,Mon May 18 16:17:56 2015 UTC,"My current favorite history of superhighways in America is Earl Swift's The Big Roads.  Laymen make entirely too much of Eisenhower and the civil defense aspects of superhighways.  As Mark Rose notes in Interstate: Express Highway Politics, 1939-1989, the ""defense"" part was only added to the 1956 highway bill as an afterthought in conference committee, and appears to have been of no importance in any of the congressional debate.   And Swift notes in The Big Roads, p. 157: ""When Dwight Eisenhower took office in January 1953, the Interstate Highway System had officially existed for more than eight years....He entered the Oval Office professing an interest in building 'a network of modern roads'.... He didn't know that the executive and legislative branches had already worked out the details of the network he sought.""  The other major players—Thomas MacDonald of the Bureau of Public Roads, Sen. Albert Gore, Rep. Hale Boggs, even FDR—were as important as Ike or moreso.  Yes, cities had density before freeways.  In fact, density—more specifically, blight and substandard housing—was seen as the problem that needed to be solved.  But what also needed to be solved was the carnage and congestion of growing numbers of autos and intercity trucks.  The urban parkway came to New York in the 1920s, to Washington and Chicago and Detroit in the 1930s, and to LA in 1940, the same year as the Pennsylvania Turnpike proved the incredible demand for an intercity superhighway.  When urban superhighway programs resumed after the war, the emphasis was on keeping the near-downtown industry and warehouses competitive with the cheaper single-story industry and truck-served facilities that had been built during the war and were quickly becoming the new standard.  So as soon as talk of a national program began in the early 50s, city politicians demanded that they not be bypassed.  Thus the ""Yellow Book"" included many of the radial routes that would later prove controversial to build and be criticized in hindsight."
urbanplanning,36b40y,MrDowntown,1 point,Mon May 18 23:09:44 2015 UTC,"It's changed the economics of cities.    Think back to the days, well into the twentieth century when, not just New York, but Manhattan, the densely populated and expensive island, was a significant manufacturing center. This is large part due to the superior transportation access that New York offered as a center of trans-Atlantic, coastwise, river, canal, and rail  services. Despite the high costs of New York, manufacturers could count on cheaper shipping and distribution than they could away from such a formidable hub. This was true to a great extent in in the rest of the great cities.  Meanwhile, outside of the immediate access-shed of various transportation arteries, transportation costs grew rapidly, working in favor of concentration.    The threat from the interstates and the general improvement of the roads and trucking was that they levelized the transportation costs of the country to a great extent.  The transportation cost advantage of being near the hub was considerably reduced, while the costs of urban operation remained.  It was hoped that freeways would reduce the pressure to relocate out of city centeres by allowing quick road access. Sadly for all involved, it didn't really work out that way"

urbanplanning,36b40y,Psy1,9,Mon May 18 22:28:23 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly certain that you're referring to high-speed, limited access roads without traffic signals, hence I'll use the term ""interstates"" in lieu of ""highways"" (which can be a pretty ambiguous term).   Interstates are kinda like the one ring in the Lord of the Rings series, things of great power for good/evil. On one hand, they can be an incredibly powerful tool to move the economy when they are well designed and function well. On the other hand, over reliance on interstates to move a population (without the necessary context of other arterials, mass transit, etc.) will not do well. Interstates should never be considered a panacea to mobility issues in a community. You cannot build your way out of traffic by adding lanes because they induce their own use thus creating more traffic.   In short, interstates are a necessary part of the economic mobility in a large, relatively low density country but were often poorly planned and socially regressive by being built in poorer areas."

It also means step by step removal of more pointless roads, reducing their width and converting the existing right of ways to more efficient usages."

Sitting on a park bench and listlessly philosophizing about the social dynamic of an urban area, while fun for many of us, doesn't equate to a career. Planning is the convergence of politics, private markets, public spaces, architecture and a while host of other factors dependent on the situation the planners are faced with. You can't just be all pie in the sky hypothesizing and expect to find success. I'd suggest you dig a little deeper on the googles and maybe reach out to nearby planning agencies and ask for some time to interview a planner to figure out what it's they actually do.   Also, if you have a hard time applying yourself to disciplines or topics which at the surface you find uninteresting, then you're not going to find success in planning.

In the ghettos, government policy - municipal policy, for example - denied adequate services, garbage wasn't collected frequently.

urbanplanning,363x8i,Smash55,1 point,Fri May 15 22:19:34 2015 UTC,"1: Compare rents and land costs in Houston with comps in nearby zoned cities -- Sugar Land (which has very strict ""polished sprawl"" zoning, like what you'd encounter in Orange County, suburban Denver and Phoenix, etc), Katy, Friendswood, Deer Park, etc.  2:  A lot more complex.  a)  In unzoned areas, land cost dictates the range of land uses.  Higher land costs = higher barriers to low ROI uses.  Lower land costs = lower barriers to low ROI uses.  Low land cost + no zoning =    Increased likelihood of a low margin or nuisance use that could ward off other higher margin uses.  Less property tax revenue, and less of a guarantee that revenue will pay for infrastructure costs. Underdevelopment and its co-morbids - sprawl, decreased transit viability, wasted space/no-man's lands, etc. Much less predictability about the built form, traffic, demand on utilities, etc.   Something many young planners and urbanists forget -- just because land is urban doesn't make it valuable or desirable.  Market conditions inside the I-610/Sam Houston loop are much different than inside ... oh, the Detroit Terminal Railroad belt.  If Detroit zoned that area ""whatever"", Woodward Avenue won't become Westheimer Road.  It won't change the economic and market fundamentals of Southeast Michigan.  The likely result - look at unincorporated, unzoned area in Texas where land costs are about the same as Detroit urban prairie.  Something like this or this.  Besides, land use regulation in Houston is far more complicated than most believe.  There's still subdivision regulations, parking standards, sign regulations, building codes, and the like.  Land use is often governed by restrictive covenants and private zoning (example: the Woodlands area), which can be much, much harder to change or waive than zoning regulations.  In the Houston area, covenants render hundreds of thousands of acres/hectares are off-limits to commercial development.    TL/DR: if there's no land use regulations, you still have to deal with market forces, along with private restrictions that function like zoning.  What might work in some parts of Houston won't work everyplace, because those places aren't Houston.  b)  Experiments can go wrong.    Consider that advances and experiences in urban planning roughly parallel those in medicine.  Planners now have a much better idea of what works and what doesn't than 60-80 years ago, when communities were struggling to deal with what seemed like a ""perfect storm"" of urban issues.  Of course, that doesn't mean our patients -- cities, towns, and villages -- will follow our advice.    The built environment has a long memory.  American cities are still paying a high price for bad decisions that were made 50, 80, or even 100 to 150 years ago.  Given the long-term results of then-unproven remedies to urban ills -- for example, slum clearance, tower-in-a-park public housing, urban expressways, and superblocks -- municipal leaders today aren't too eager to perform ""experiments"" of the same scale.  That is, unless they're very sure the outcome will be positive, or at least benign.    Experimentation is fine with short term, small scale, low-risk projects - LQC, tactical urbanism, and its variants.  However, most long-term planning efforts aim at some desired outcome, not ""let's see what happens.""  TL/DR:  Contemporary planning tools and approaches are far more effective than those the past, but implementation is far more conservative.  Urban renewal was an easy sell in from the 1930s through the 1970s, given the urban issues of the era.  New urbanism is a hard sell today, even though its benefits are well documented.  Try selling a city on ""let's do whatever"".  c)  One early goal of zoning was to address the uncertainty of buying real estate when you don't know what might be built around you in the future.  This was a big deal back in the days when commercial and industrial uses were often quite noxious, and there were no environmental laws.  One modern day example: I live in a somewhat rural area in the Northeastern US, where housing and labor costs are very high, overall quality is very low, and almost no new housing is built at the middle end of the market.  (We're talking about bidding wars for battered, functionally obsolete folk Victorians --- and buyers keeping them that way, because they value the ""authentic"" and ""rustic"" character of 6.5' ceilings, walkthrough bedrooms, and having the main bathroom off the kitchen.)  There is some affordable, middle-end, liveable housing in the area ...  in surrounding rural towns, some of which are unzoned.  It's tempting.  However, there's no guarantee that a motocross park or composting facility won't set up shop on an adjacent lot -- and it happens a lot more than people think.  The ""get the hell off my land"" people who are prone to hoarding or intrusive ""cottage industries"" tend to gravitate to unzoned areas, where there's fewer barriers to their idea of ""life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness.""  It's one key reason why, even with a severe housing shortage in the region, and a zoning/market mismatch throttling development in close-in communities, nearby unzoned communities aren't exactly booming with construction activity.  Certainty has a market value, and it's reflected in the difference in real estate prices between zoned and unzoned towns.  TL/DR: A lack of zoning might bring with it lower land costs, but not necessarily because it increases the supply of commercial land.  It could lower demand."

My fear with driverless cars is that we are going to see another wave of anti-pedestrian laws and infastructure.  Pedestrians will be further segregated from the streets in the name of safety and traffic flow.  Only cross at designated crossings and only after pressing the button and getting a green light or else you may confuse the poor driverless cars and slow a commuter down.  In their tests driverless cars do great on highways and stroads and other such mostly or entirely segregated car-centric environments but have a very hard time mixing with pedestrians or dealing with the many unexpected situations that pop up in a mixed urban environment.  I don't want to see these urban environments re-shaped in the name of making it easier on driverless cars."

It just doesn't make sense financially to go into debt (and lose two years of working time) for a masters degree, which most jobs either require or highly recommend, and then accept pay around like 35k a year. Once I get into the position that pays that much. The very entry level probably pays even less.   Interesting so is most urban design done by the private sector where you are? I love the variety in the urban planning profession but I am afraid of the getting experience part. I am willing to relocate but living in some random rural town in some random state like Montana for a couple years to get experience sounds like a nightmare. Even then when I do get enough experience I won't be able to get a job where I actually make a difference because those positions are filled by those who graduated from top tier schools in the us.

I wouldn't say most of the jobs are in government as in Australia it's probably closer to 50/50.  In Australia, most if not all work done under the governments name (except for day to day planning approvals and higher order policy) is done by the private sector. Say the govt needs a new neighbourhood urban renewal strategy or some urban design guidelines for a new or old precinct, they'll put out a tender for the private sector to compete for the job based off experience, the proposal and the price. Or say the government has some unused land around a train station and wants to see how they can utilise it, they'll or out a tender to the private sector. Or say a city is thinking of implementing light rail, they'll put out a tender to companies with experience this and will let them compete for the job. They will occasionally do their own work (eg master plans) but in my experience, these will usually turn out to be this bastardised monster that gets tweaked and tweaked in order to please everyone in the govt internally and then by the time it reaches the public it's filled with mistakes that a student wouldn't make haha. Anyway my names Riley not Ricardo haha.  But yeah I don't envy your position over there mate, the job market is fucked here and from all reports it's not even half as fucked as over there! If I was looking down the barrel of that much debt I wouldn't do a degree that didn't at least have some certainty of work. Another reason to talk you out of it perhaps would be to say that planners can tend to get stuck in the places where they started as the rules and regulations change from state to state, country to country. So if you get stuck in that type of planning it can be hard to get a job overseas (though not impossible). A lot of private companies are looking to expand into India, Singapore and China so if you state your willingness to go over there you might have more luck? Anyway good luck mate!"

They recognize that arcane rules and processes, many a reaction to ""that one development that ruined it for everybody else"", aren't getting the kinds of results they want.  However, land use regulations in the opposite direction, especially those with vague requirements tied in with discretionary decision-making, are, at least in the US, vulnerable to constitutional challenges -- unlawful delegation of legislative power, due process, and equal protection.  Many planning practitioners ignore market forces.  They often forget that great ideas need to be viable.

urbanplanning,35w2qb,ComradeTaco,1 point,Sat May 16 18:47:09 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot! I will take a look at those when im at a computer. I agree with the market forces part. Culturally i am not one of those folks especially if we're talking about development within an urban area. Im sure there has to be certain regulations within a city due to the density and other variables.  However outside of those areas i think certain places go too far and don't respect property rights. Being a supporter of scaled down living im not sure why there has to be minimum size standards outside of safety reasons or why in most places you can't have a person permanently residing in your backyard in a tiny house or rv. As long as its safe (won't catch on fire or collapse) why can't you build your house out of recycled materials? Certain places require you to use a specific wood and specific types of windows. Where i live your trash can cannot be visible to the sidewalk and you can't park on your lawn. The former seems ridiculous and the latter while tacky i don't see why unless it permanently fucks with the land. These are the types of regulations i have a problem with - they just seem unreasonable.

I am completely for development oriented around transit and sustainable architecture and design. The only problem is that i have a more libertarian political philosophy.   While I might not share enthusiasm for tiny houses, you can still find a niche within urban planning. I don't see why your political views would be an impediment - I don't see why they'd be set in stone, either, but that's another story - so long as you apply to areas where a distaste for bureaucracy and keen eye for cutting down on redundant or harmful municipal policies can produce interesting results. There's room for a libertarian viewpoint on issues like zoning, community development, but I'm warning you - it's not going to be fully accepted. Part of the reason why cities tend to lean more to the left politically is that rules governing and limiting actions community members are a necessity for urban society.

Run, don't walk to a bookstore to get ""The Death and Life of Great American Cities"".   Modernists especially Le Corbusier saw everything only as giant machines for whatever their primary focus is. Cities according to them are machines for living--sleeping, working, and shopping. That produced sterile and function-segregated business districts, shopping centers, and cookie cutter suburbs. Lots of grass though. Jane Jacobs came in in the 60's and her whole thing is that the best and most vibrant places for living are organic, living, dynamic, non-tightly planned places. Rigidly planned cities are merely taxidermied specimens!   If you do urban planning, I think there'd be space to be the person pushing the alternative, to try to shape legislation and enlighten local governments about planning in ways to liberate people to grow and develop neighborhoods into livable places."
urbanplanning,35w2qb,its_the_perfect_name,2,Thu May 14 02:17:04 2015 UTC,Part of the reason why suburbs and sprawl have become so ubiquitous however is because of government. The cost of gas and owning and operating a vehicle is artificially low because of government subsidies. Also zoning doesn't allow for dense development in most places. Rooms have to have a closet and there is minimum square footage requirements which is why people build tiny houses on trailers. Even then there are issues in trying to find where to put a tiny house legally.

urbanplanning,35w2qb,its_the_perfect_name,2,Thu May 14 02:52:15 2015 UTC,"Interesting idea really.  If you had a free market cities would look very different.  Assuming streets and all transit is built by property developers I'd imagine you'd get denser, more transit orientated cities to be honest.  Developers are trying to build more attractive areas for a lower cost. The biggest cost is going to be acquiring land for transit connections, this makes space efficient transit more attractive.  Let's say we have a Neal Stephenson style city. A group of planned areas are each administrated by a private company either renting or long term leasing the units out.   As the cluster grows links quickly become saturated and they look for better connections. Some might look towards motorways - but - catch: motorways require lots of land. No one wants to give up land (especially as they're paying to make their lots more valuable). Overhead construction is most likely but very expensive and damaging (noise, visual) to surrounding areas.  On the other hand an overhead train or busway is less noisy and intrusive while delivering greater capacity.  Without regulation I'd imagine transit would approach a better cost parity with cars. There's really no reason for rail to be so expensive, nor busways. Building private roads wouldn't be too popular then, you move very few people despite a large area and a traffic jam in land you can't control will shut down your system. Likewise, the areas being served would definitely be denser (as nearly all western areas have rules about how small homes can be, how tall buildings can be in certain areas, etc).  tl;dr Think of government advocacy/consulting simply as finding the most socially efficient route without a free market."
urbanplanning,35w2qb,vidro3,1 point,Thu May 14 05:46:03 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. For the most part government is to blame for sprawl and car-dependent design. It just wouldn't be affordable without the government. However, sometimes government can be the solution in the form of quotas for pollution or a carbon tax. If large emitters of greenhouse gases were given the right to pollute but were required to buy and sell these rights according to how much they pollute they would have to take into account they price they place on third parties by polluting. Or you could just tax carbon emissions. They both work to reduce emissions and this type of intervention can only be done by the government."
urbanplanning,35shum,randomdude765,26,Wed May 13 03:22:06 2015 UTC,"The general principals are sound, and over the last 30 years, have become incorporated into modern planning practices. There are just a few issues I can think of off the top of my head.   NU usually advocates architectural control, ie, creating requirements for new developments to have a uniform look, often inspired by classic pre-1939 design. Many people find this stifling, or don't see the value of it, so it can be controversial. The original idea was that the NU principals would replace or be incorporated into existing city codes, creating gradual transitions from dense urbanized areas to rural ones. Instead, though, most authorities only allow a few isolated NU-style developments. The result is that a lot of developments are built under the label of NU that are in and of themselves dense, multistory, mixed use, and walkable. But the NU developments might not mesh with the surrounding areas, which might be elevated highways, auto-oriented suburbs, or even rural areas. There's just not much need to latch onto it as a movement, since, I mentioned before, most of its principles have been incorporated into modern planning already. Of course, you still see a lot of low-density, auto oriented sprawl in the US, but that's not what new planners are advocating for--that stuff usually gets built due to the influence of city councils, private developers, businesses, civil engineering departments, and older planners who like the easy routine of rubber-stamping every Walmart and Olive Garden."
urbanplanning,35shum,beansworth,1 point,Wed May 13 05:28:49 2015 UTC,"I will answer what I can from each: 1. You are right. They do like traditional because it uses classical architecture, which is extremely practical in relevance to humans. Though you can have classical measurements with modern façades. 2. NU developments would mesh with surrounding areas if given the opportunity. 3. I think NU it is still very progressive in the US, wouldn't you think?"
urbanplanning,35shum,beansworth,3,Sun May 17 01:48:59 2015 UTC,"I think NU it is still very progressive in the US, wouldn't you think?   No more so than any current planning practice. Most planners who have been educated in the last 15 years or so advocate for mixed use, density, walkability, public transit, traffic calming, auxiliary dwellings, and zero-lot lines. They don't consider that stuff to be progressive, just normal urban planning. It just seems progressive compared to the planning ideas of the 1950s which are still written into most existing zoning codes."
urbanplanning,35shum,AlbertAugust,24,Sun May 17 02:18:02 2015 UTC,"I've heard it derisively referred to as ""sprawl with porches"". The criticism is that it legitimises suburban sprawl by essentially giving it an aesthetic makeover without addressing some core issues of suburbia. Many early NU developments in the US, for instance, are criticised for not introducing higher densities than traditional suburbia (see, e.g. Kentlands, Seaside etc.) NU developments on the suburban fringe also do nothing to reduce car ownership (though people in NU suburbs do likely make fewer car trips per day on average). Some planners argue that NU is just putting lipstick on a pig and there should be more focus on things like transit oriented developments and urban infill.  Another criticism centres around affordability. Many NU developments are essentially ""designer suburbs"" and houses tend to command a premium. This may just be an issue of local regulations not allowing the construction of NU developments (or developers being unwilling to build them) thus artificially restricting the supply of NU neighbourhoods.  Some also tend to criticise New Urbanism as being ""artificial"" or ""creepy"". Some of these places do admittedly have a bit of a Disneyland feel that's a little off-putting. Some of that can be attributed to the fact that most NU developments are quite new so they have a bit of a sterile look without the natural wear and tear of older urban neighbourhoods.  Lastly, and this isn't really a criticism of NU itself, but many developers have begun to incorporate NU elements into their subdivisions without much regard for the substantive aims of the movement. For instance, an auto-oriented suburb might feature back lanes, smaller houses and front porches, but still be built along windy streets and culs-de-sac and have little public space or mixture of uses. Thus, New Urbanism just becomes something of a real estate marketing gimmick."
urbanplanning,35shum,Planner_Hammish,4,Wed May 13 09:03:27 2015 UTC,"I second this! Especially your first point. I would add that ""New Urbanism"" doesn't look or feel anything like ""old urbanism"", or rather more succinctly: urbanism. And in my training/education, not once did we visit an actual urban street as part of our field trips. We went around to a bunch of new suburban (er, ""new urban"") developments in the fringe of the city. The field trips would have been more valuable if we had examined actual urbanism that developed organically over time so that we could derive our own interpretations of what ""urbanism"" looks like."
urbanplanning,35shum,lemachin,3,Wed May 13 14:58:55 2015 UTC,"Cornell, Markham, Ontario is an excellent example of your criticisms.  It's not a very ambitious NU development. Maybe in name only; a marketing gimmick.  It's been a while since I was there, and it looks even worse on Google Maps: just like your typical sprawl, except the garages are on (very wide) back laneways. Apparently this should encourage front-porch and sidewalk social life, but since Cornell is a.) not well-served by transit and b.) has barely any employment destinations nearby, few services, and only convenience retail, everyone is traveling long distances out of the neighbourhood by car anyway. So in practice they're still entering their houses through the garage, except now it's at the back of the house.

It may be 'lipstick on a pig' and a better solution might be greenbelts, if possible.  The market dictates the prices and they are higher in NU developments maybe because people like it better, thus increasing the demand?  This is a problem. I have seen 2 solutions. 1. Use a lot of different architects. 2. They use materials (like old rooftops or artificially worn out bricks). But at the end, it is a problem.

Haussman's Paris, grunderzeit areas + gemeindebauten, the brownstone blocks...all of those are from this period, not the pre-19th century.

From my thesis:  ""For New Urbanist architects, the isolated yet crowded nature of the blocks, with little in the way of personal space or relation to the street or wider city, was a major factor in the failure of the buildings. With the rise of this discourse, the replacement of social housing with mix-income buildings that better reflected New Urbanist thinking was seen as a gain for the city as a whole.""  Basically, the New Urbanist mindset was one of the factors that led to the ""housing choice"" policy in many parts of the developed world, which is really just a nice way of saying forced relocation."

Adherents of CNU might advocate for healthy developments that are mixed-use, transit-adjacent, and pedestrian-scaled, but they're only interested in creating that from scratch in areas outside the urban cores and inner-ring suburbs.

NU used political structures and developer relationships to modify sections of the built environment (or build them from scratch, more often); LU tries to fix existing areas (not precluding redevelopment) by relaxing and eliminating regulatory and zoning ordinances. There isn't supposed to be a difference in community involvement, but instead of the process in NU being driven by the town or city, in LU it is driven by developers big and small. the idea is to set up a system of guidelines which everyone can use to build a cohesive and healthy town or city rather than the NU way of master-planning everything. The small business owner isn't squished quite as much this way and the process becomes an opportunity for good design and planning principles to take over in a town or city, rather than political squabbling and cronyism."

The first image is particularly shocking in its poor design.  There is a lot of ambiguity here as to whether the cycle lane is part of a shared pavement or part of the carriageway. The kerb and double yellows being outside the cycle lane would suggest it is a shared pavement. The lack of break in the cycle lane suggests it is part of the carriageway.  Having cycle routes on halfway-elevated platforms is not something currently accomodated by the TSRGD, which also states that double yellow lines must be no further than 250mm from the edge of carriageway (which puts them inside any cycle lane).  This junction is suggesting to motorists that cyclists will be instructed to give way, and suggests to cyclists that motorists would give way. In any case as a motorist, I give way if there is ever any ambiguity - but this is not the case with many motorists, and roads should be designed with the stupidest road user in mind.  The author does go on a bit about different alternative designs - and is confusing the difference between cycle lanes and cycle routes as part of shared pavements (and also suggests designs which simply would not fit in the London example).  If there is a particular problem with motorists failing to give way to cycle lane users, then you can use give way markings at the edge of the cycle lane to emphasize priority. Like in this image: http://www.warwicksquarepimlico.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/CS5-Cycle-Lane-Belgrave-Road.jpg  In short, I think that the intentions of the local authority are respectable, but in over complicating the design to cater for cyclists, they've created something that is too complex and is misleading for all road users (pedestrians, cyclists and motorists)."

Also, there will always be enclaves of really rich people distributed through a city who highly value both accessibility and space.    The neighborhoods that are both high-value and walkable are that way because they were built that way purposefully.    Actually probably not. In my experience (anecdotally) these types of neighborhoods were built before land use controls were really a thing and the market was allowed to work by conserving high value land through density. To me, one of the biggest problems in urbanism today is the fact that what ""everybody"" celebrates as ""good/walkable urbanism"" is essentially illegal in most cities."

So, for instance, the future land use plan may zone some areas for density that are previously zoned for single-family. The map may also target areas outside the city for municipal annexation at a later date. This is planning for growth.  However, not everything goes according to plan. Elected officials usually have to be persuaded to adhere to plans. They can also take actions outside the plan.  So, look to the comprehensive plan to see what planned growth and projects that cities are engaging in. But don't take it as gospel, either.   If you want to get on the inside of what projects or growth are being planned, start by attending planning commission meetings.

You're not paying for the useful value of a piece of land, but for the potential useful value of a piece of land at some point in the future. The seller can do this as long as the cost of waiting stays short of the actual value appreciation. The cheaper the wait, the further the seller's sights are. In a market where the wait is free, the seller wants the value of eternity.  A reasonably high property tax makes waiting for the perfect deal a terrible proposition, as waiting is expensive. You have to do something with the property instead. It brings the seller's potential value projections much closer to the present day. A perfect property tax brings it to exactly the present day, but a merely reasonably well measured property tax brings it to the decade. The property market turns into a buyer's market: property owners seek whoever willing to do something useful with their rapidly-depreciating properties.

In the end I don't think there is a one fair rule for all, it's up to each city to decide what's adequate. A city like New York is unique, if people want to occupy its best location they should pay for this privilege. In London where I live property taxes are ridiculously low, that means that a middle class family living in a half million dollar house pays the same tax as a billionaire living in a $100 million house. The result is that we have many properties bought by foreigners in prime locations as investment that remain empty all year round.

urbanplanning,35lsx8,m0llusk,3,Tue May 12 05:38:25 2015 UTC,"In is really interesting how completely disconnected the discussion has become from core ideas of urban planning.  How far are new facilities from police and hospitals?  How does it integrate with the local transit grid?  Nobody cares.  A housing unit is a unit and both quality and length of life are irrelevant abstractions.  More realistic and considered plans for expansion have concentrated on areas in and around downtown.  This is why the ailing San Antonio mall is continuing to see new and dense residential developments.  There are multiple factors here.  Political power in Mountain View remains concentrated in the hands of people who want it to stay a quaint and pleasant place where the value of their houses tends strongly upward.  To the extent there is development it does not belong along the bay shore, and even putting corporate campuses there in the first place was very controversial and done only because corporate campuses were considered easier to manage.  Then there is fear of money, corruption, and the company town image as well.  And probably other factors as well.  If Google is serious about this then they will come up with new proposals that focus on grown nearer to the core of the town.  The word on the street is that Google intents to work with developers in a more traditional relationship that will enable at least some expansion and also limit the cost and exposure which are so prominent in what just got voted down."

Plus those comments from LA Mayor Garcetti: ""How do you spend billions of dollars on fixed rail when we might not own cars in this city in a decade or a decade and a half?""

For the sake of example, let's endow me with a certain amount of forsight that no one had about the car in 1900 (foresight that I do not claim to have in reality).    And you tell me all this great stuff about how the horseless carriage is going to revolutionize society. It'll be the the greatest transportation revolution in nearly a century and I'm not seeing it for what it is.  Why, it will get rid of traffic congestion by dramatically speeding up traffic and reducing spooked-horse delays. Our horse-shit strewn streets will be replaced with clean burning gasoline.  Citizens will be freed from the tyranny of the traction company's five cent pound of flesh, and we can all live like aristocrats in our own miniature country estate.   Now, with the pretense that I am somehow clairvoyant, what are your responses to my criticisms that these vehicles will hollow out cities, destroy the livability and utility of our streets, and transform the roadway into either a dangerous place full of speeding cars, a dead place full of stopped cars, or both, while the business that once dependent on healthy foot and streetcar traffic withers and dies in favor of infrastructure-subsidy dependent crap?   Are you going to start telling me how I'm wrong because the German Imperial Government is making serious plans for controlled access motorways, and the mayor of some metropolis is saying great things about all the horse-shit that won't be on the street?   Listen, I don't doubt that driverless cars won't become important in the future, but let's not overestimate the technological regulatory hurdles present before we can pack them like sardines at speed and 'solve traffic' (while everyone commutes in from ever farther than before for some wonderful demand-inducement   Electric Driverless cars deal with a few issues - car-created pollution, maybe accidents, perhaps increased effective road capacity, but all too often people see driverless cars as some sort of panacea when they only deal with a few problems, and handwaive into existence technologies that do not exist.  They aren't going to deal very well with parking (driverless 'taxis' still need to be somewhere during the off-peak period, and human contact has yet to be effectively replaced, so 'work from home' is never going to be quite what it's cracked up to be either).  In so far as people overestimate their potential benefits, we come to a situation where the reactionary are going to use driverless cars as a crutch to avoid fixing our cities that we wrecked in the name of the first 'future personal transportation' technology.  I foresee a future of driverless cars giving new 'life' to our pedestrian-hostile city streets, poverty-exacerbating costs of living and more endless sprawlburgs of bored teenager and obese adults with ever-decaying civil society.   Driverless cars do not fix these problems of motordom, and may very well likely exacerbate them.    So pardon me for being a bit irritated. We're just starting, in the grand scheme of things, to fix the tragic results of the last bout of wonderful future private transportation technology."

Again Paul - we're having the wrong debate (and it's become an annoyingly regular occurrence on this sub). You've linked three examples of people claiming AVs are going ""change transit as we know it"" - that's great, but it's not at all interesting from the standpoint of this sub. Watery-eyed predictions about just how revolutionary AVs will be misses the point - we need to see the evidence. We need to see how this works in practice, we need the details.   You've linked to reports in the past that try to provide these - continue to do so, then at least the debate is centered on a surer foundation, rather than fanboy statements. The two most recent report that popped up on this sub by the way both made the claim that mass transit is essential to the success of AVs. No amount of smart programming is going to obviate the laws of geometry, nor physics, nor the fact that people walk on streets, nor traffic flow will be congested inevitably. Let's avoid another round of AV barrackers and transitheads lobbing shells at each other across the bow."
urbanplanning,35o9d5,CantabKBH,3,Tue May 12 10:36:46 2015 UTC,"we need to see the evidence. We need to see how this works in practice, we need the details.   Fair comment. But you know you as well as I do that this tech isn't ready for prime-time just yet - all we have is very small scale and limited case pilot studies/demonstration projects at the moment including CityMobil2, the 4 UK driverless car projects, the Singapore-MIT demonstration etc.  But how it will work in practice - a great deal of thought development has gone into that, and there is a rapidly increasing number of papers, research documents and forecasting that is appearing.  Amongst those there are some very clear trends, that all the bright people and leaders that I refer to have made themselves aware of - and are predicting major change ahead.  Just like the weather forecast, it is very clear from current trends that numerous items are converging to result in events that will be disruptive. We don't always heed the weather forecast, because we look outside the window and we just know they have got it wrong. But this is akin to a major storm coming, and forecasters may not get it completely right, but it is definitely coming in some form of other and could be potentially disruptive.  The latest OECD report, which really should be grabbing attention suggests that we can reduce the number of vehicles by 90% and still get better levels of service from our roads than currently. That is equivalent to peak hour flows with half the number of cars on the roads.   With the right policies in place to promote active transportation, walkable neighbourhoods etc. just think how much we could improve cities if we could have peak hour traffic flows? We could remove lanes and make crossing roads easier for peds, we could replace vehicle lanes with bicycle lanes etc. etc.  Autonomous vehicles are not a panacea - but they will be a much more powerful mobility tool than we have ever had before that we can use to improve quality of life.   So just like a serious storm that has been forecast - we can plan and prepare in advance, or we can wait to see how bad it is before we act - which is clearly acting too late to mitigate the downsides.  I cannot give you the details - I can just give you some of the likeliest major trends: - there will be all forms, shapes, sizes and functionality of autonomous vehicles (NOT just cars) - the roadways will be much safer for active transportation - the biggest benefit come when private vehicle ownership makes way for the use of shared autonomous vehciles and we could reduce the total passenger vehicle fleet by as much as 90% (I err towards 80%) - the parking paradigm changes completely - by increasing average vehicle occupancy from 1.2 to above 1.8 we dramatically improve roadway efficiency; allowing lane reductions, faster travel etc. So we can set the policies we want around our quality of life goals - fleets of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) can obey zonal rules, so if you want active transportation to have priority in a zone, then all the SAVs will slow down and give way - housing can be built more densely as parking and garages no longer a planning issue - electric propulsion is the preferred AV power system, thus significantly reducing emissions in urban areas - road safety, which has a societal cost to developed countries of anywhere between 2% and 8% of GDP sees an up to 80% reduction in crashes - workers can start their working day when they get in the vehicle and finish when they get out (with progressive employers) thereby reducing the total working day length by removing commuting time, thus contributing to quality of life - conversion/re-purposing of parking lots and parking structures in urban areas leads to all manner of possibilities of improving quality of life if we choose to put in urban farms, more community living facilities etc."
urbanplanning,35o9d5,Lol-I-Wear-Hats,4,Tue May 12 17:56:53 2015 UTC,"So the OECD-Lisbon report is very interesting, agreed (and references a good host of other resources). I'm not going to tl;dr for everyone, it's worth a read - but there are a few major points I think are helpful to this debate (I'm sure you know the data points, so bear with me):   Mass transit and AVs are compliments, not substitutes. In both the taxibot and autovot iterations - the modal share of rapid transit increases, and increases for both the 100% and 50% adoption scenarios. This ""cuts"" 90% of the car fleet references only the taxibot 100% adoption rate in areas with rapid transit - I think that's a little specious, but I'm well aware that transit advocates are also guilty of choosing the most beneficial stats to support their points. For reference the car fleet, according to their model, will grow for the taxibot and autovot 50% adoption rate in areas without RT, and will only contract by 22% and 18% for areas with RT. To see the big gains, a city needs to go full 100%, which is clearly the more difficult of the options. And in both cases, the fleet size depends on the presence of RT, especially considering 30%-50% of the new ride share demand is expected to derive from busses passengers - i.e. people who use transit, though not rapid transit, so they're accounting for that fact that many more people will be using these AVs than currently drive in cities. Vehicle miles are going to increase. At a 50% adoption rate, the model projects that vehicle-km will increase by 150-200% (and this is Lisbon, not the sprawl-ier US), and still 130-150% for areas with RT. 100% adoption looks better, but is still above the baseline 120-180% increase for no RT, 110-140% with RT. We better hope these bad boys are electric, because if not it'll be less environmentally friendly than our current situation (and going full EL is going to require major countries like the US to figure their shit out in regards to the grid infrastructure, and likely means re-upping on coal and fossils. There will be added cost too, EL is more expensive than gas or diesel). The aforementioned relationship to car-km and automation gets even grislier when you limit the km to peak hour trips. And here's the most important point that I want to make, the claims of efficiency are generally couched in terms of ""we won't need to have parking anymore! Think of all the extra space!"" - and this report seems to intimate that is a bit of a false hope. They project travel volumes on four classes of roadways: motorways, trunks, distributors, and local roads. On all four classes autovot non-RT will increase peak travel volume significantly and will be above baseline levels all day, and likely congestion. TaxiBot with-RT will mirror the baseline numbers on all classes except local roads. Those local roads are precisely the areas that we're hoping to bring into a better relationship with autos and this report is suggesting that's not likely since they'll see an increase with automation. It's a help to be able whack a few lanes from the highways, yes (although with increased travel volume I'm skeptical), but that area reclaimed from these major road is not land that can be easily tied back into the urban fabric (although I can think of a few exceptions). AVs really come into their own on highways - not urban areas, so if we go full AV we should expect it to be a continuation of the current suburbanization/sprawl tendencies that we have today. And I'll remind you to keep in your head that sprawl makes the provision of services more inefficient than necessary   So, in conclusion: if we're going to do the damn thing (and using this report's own modeling) and make it succeed we need to a) go full 100% adoption rate and b) invest in rapid transit. Which brings me back to my first point in a prior comment:   mass transit is essential to the success of AVs   We're allies, I don't agree that it's as revolutionary or frankly as beneficial as you think, but that's the narcissism of small difference."
urbanplanning,35o9d5,Lol-I-Wear-Hats,3,Tue May 12 21:54:03 2015 UTC,"I would love to have the time to explain why there are some important things that the OECD model assumed, or didn't include or allow for, as these could have significant impact on the outcomes.  Numerous other models have all had major variations to this, and we are not even close to optimising between the various models to determine what could be achieved with the right policies and the political will to implement them.  But what all of the modelling has shown is that we can expect significant impacts.  Hence the reason I consider we should already be planning for change - i.e. not assuming the status quo and committing funds and resources to projects that we are confident could be significantly impacted or even disrupted.  I absolutely agree on the importance of transit - but only in heavily used corridors where the volume of people to be transported warrants it. My view is that in the vast majority of US Cities, and probably in a significant minority of European cities and towns, that transit corridors do not meet the threshold at which they continue to outweigh the benefits of SAVs.  Bu until we do more research that simply remains my view base on my own basic desktop analyses."

Trips between LA and San Francisco are projected to keep increasing as population continues to grow. HSR has proven in other areas of the world it can get people out of their cars, meaning we will not have to widen the highways to increase capacity.   Not to mention that ""almost here"" is more than a bit of a stretch. They still have problems ""seeing"" in snow, heavy rain and heavy fog. And even if these get solved in the coming years, that only means a prototype is ready. The average person is not going to start getting self driving cars for quite a while."
urbanplanning,35kpgt,auandi,-10,Mon May 11 15:26:56 2015 UTC,"Self driving cars will be able to drive in platoons increasing the vehicle density of roads.   Given at the current rate of development for both the self driving cars and high speed rail (land access, and build time) the self driving cars will be here sooner.   The far left lane can be repurposed as the self driving lane. This lane will be exclusive for self driving cars, van, and busses traveleing at a higher rate of speed and at a closer proximity. This lane will serve the function of a high speed rail, except its route can be dynamic.   Exciting times cant wait. Good discussion."
urbanplanning,35kpgt,michelework,10,Mon May 11 16:44:02 2015 UTC,"That's a lot of assumptions there, and a big part of it seems to be based on the assumption that self driving cars will be allowed higher speed limits. I doubt that, especially not vans and busses. Stop distance at low speeds can be much smaller with self-driving time, but at high speeds the computerized quick reaction time makes very little difference. The breaks still have to get rid of a lot of energy which goes up exponentially with speed.  Right now the speed limit is 65 mph. Increase it to 90 mph and you just doubled the kinetic energy and possibly more than doubled its stopping distance. HSR can do 220 mph through the central valley. There's no way a car can compete with that.  Most of the I-5 through the central valley is 2 lane. Are you saying they'll ban human driver cars from the inside lane making it a one lane highway? And even in the sections that are 3+ lanes, do you expect people to obey the ban at all times? People don't obey the carpool rule and that doesn't come with an increased speed limit. If you say that the outside lanes have a 65 mph limit and the inside lanes have a 80 mph limit, people will take the inside lane. They just will. And so that makes it no safer and no major change to capacity.  If you want car travel to be faster, you need to have less cars on the road or widen the highways. HSR will get cars off the road, and while it might be going slower than I'd like most major projects take time. The Interstate Highway System for example, it was first signed into law in 1956, but the first state to fully complete its portion of highway (Nebraska) wasn't until 1974. I-5 wasn't completed till 1979. The full system as proposed in 1956 was not finished until 1992! Driverless cars may improve efficiency some, but not a lot at high speeds. Their big advantage is low speeds where driver reaction time plays a bigger part in stop distance. Even if the technology comes as fast as some like you claim, it would really not change much."

urbanplanning,35kpgt,entropicamericana,-1,Mon May 11 22:39:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, it does work when talking about highways between far flung cities. Widening a highway between cities will not induce demand the way widening one going into town does. If someone is going to go from LA to San Fransisco, how wide the highway is will not drastically change how often they make the trip or if they'd rather take an alternative to driving. Widening a highway in the suburbs does do those things."
urbanplanning,35kpgt,auandi,-2,Mon May 11 22:52:26 2015 UTC,"Production cars are already capable of hitting 200 mph today. Give them autonomous capabilities, a dedicated lane of traffic and it will be safe to do. Networked cars can warn of any potential hazard of traffic. My Waze app already does this by aggregating all drivers using the app. The technology already exists, it just needs to be rolled out.   Would you rather take a high speed rail where you are locked in from A-B or a moderate speed autonomous car where you can deviate from the route to stop at a local regional restaurant or stretch your legs at a scenic rest stop."
urbanplanning,35kpgt,michelework,2,Mon May 11 19:38:14 2015 UTC,"Train. I can stretch my legs or get a bite to eat while I travel. And I'll do it in a fraction of the time and without the headache of traffic.  A dedicated lane is not enough to do 200 mph. You would literally need to rebuild the highway from scratch. No grades greater than probably 1%, maybe less. No turns with r<5 miles. Even with a turn of r=5 miles you're going to experience lateral force equal to gravity which could rip tires apart. Outside of airport runways, there are only a dozen or so places where you can safely travel at that speed, almost all of them purpose built race tracks or testing grounds and even then none of them let you travel at that speed for very long.   Not to mention that while cars can go that fast almost none do. Many Japanese and German car makers have had an informal ""gentlemen's agreement"" for years that their cars will be electronically limited to 155 mph, and Germany still has unrestricted speed limits on their motorways. Here is a list of all the production cars that are able to reach 200 mph, the cheapest one on there is the 2016 Cadillac CTS-V which starts at only $84,990.   I'll talk about the Bugatti Veyron, because that's what I'm most well versed in. 200 mph is 322 km/h. When the head of the Volkswagon AutoGroup announced at a staff dinner that he wanted to make a car that could do 400 km/h, the room laughed. He talked about how he wanted 1000 BHP, 0-100 km/h in 2.5 seconds, and still have all the luxuries of a regular car, they thought he was joking. It took 6 years to design it, they lost money on every model they sold, and yet it would not be able to do San Francisco to LA at 200 mph.   Air resistance goes up exponentially. It means engines have to work even harder at the high speeds. More force is being used by the car onto the road, and that wears everything down faster. It consumes gas faster, it wears the tires down, it wears the suspension down, everything is harder. Going full out, a Veyron will empty its (regular sized) tank in about 55 minutes. But that's not your biggest concern, because the tires (which are ~$2,000 each to replace) will wear the tread out to slicks in about 40 minutes. I don't know how much time you'd get on those tires going 322km/h instead of 400 km/h, but the tires would at minimum not be able to make the return trip if they can make the first trip to begin with.   Look, I like driverless cars too. I think they are great and hold a lot of promise, but for transporting passengers it's just not practical to move people at those speeds in cars. The highways we have couldn't support it, and only the rich could afford cars that could do it. And it's not like LA-San Francisco has to worry about if people will want to make the journey, tens of thousands of people a day will. So why not build an option that thousands of people can use?"
urbanplanning,35kpgt,auandi,-2,Mon May 11 21:05:22 2015 UTC,"The roads wouldn't need to be rebuilt/redesigned. Flexible plylons would be affixed to separate the far left dedicated autonomous lane. The cars would only go as fast as the road would allow. Straight as an arrow? Go fast. Bumpy and Curvy slow down as necessary. This is something a human driver can't do. Our current speed limits haven't been raised because we need to cater to the average or below average driver / car combo. The stig in a supercar can go navigate much quicker than a mom in minivan distracted by her kids.   I'm not advocating that self driving cars can go as fast as a train, but speed only part of the equation when debating car vs. train.   There is a good deal of work when installing the infrastructure for a high speed rail. Rolling out autonomous cars is cheaper and quicker."
urbanplanning,35kpgt,michelework,3,Mon May 11 22:11:14 2015 UTC,"Interstate standards say that highways are only designed to a safe maximum of 70 mph for flat terrain, 60 mph for rolling terrain, and less only in very extreme cases. Cars aren't limited because of the average driver, they're limited because the stopping distance and centrifugal forces goes exponentially up as you increase speed. Even the best drivers in the world can not change this simple law of physics. Anything faster than the engineered speed limit is not safe and so the state can not condone it. That is why the speed limits aren't changing.  And again, I'll tell you 100%, if the center lane gets to go faster, people will go to the centre lane. They just will. And that means a car not linked in to any network will be sharing the roads, you can not assume the lane will be empty and so cars can not go much faster than if they are in with regular traffic.  Self driving cars can be rolled out, but it will not increase the capacity of the highway to any meaningful degree. If you block the centre lane you'd actually most likely decrease the capacity of the highway."

No. Right now, if you look at a free flow highway, you see cars going by every 2 seconds. You know how youre supposed to leave 3 car lengths apart between cars, but in LA nobody leaves more than 1? Well, self driving cars will be required to follow the law, and the law will require enough spacing so that someone can come to a full and complete stop before hitting the car in front of them. That means you will probably see capacity decrease. Yes, computers can make decisions faster than a distracted driver, but brake pads are brake pads."
urbanplanning,35kpgt,thebruns,-3,Mon May 11 18:37:45 2015 UTC,"Once the technology is proven, regulations will be loosened for autonomous cars.  Speed limits will increase and vehicle gap will be lessened. It wont be day one, but maybe a year in. These vehicles will be lighter so stop times will also go down.   Think three moves ahead, not one. As far as catastrophic failure, I'd rather have a low passenger count self driving car fail than a hundred plus passenger high speed rail.  Good discussion. Cant see what the actual outcome will be."
urbanplanning,35kpgt,michelework,4,Mon May 11 19:27:52 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Look at rail law. Trains have gotten better and smarter, but they keep adding regulation that limits them more and more. Many subway systems in the world, for example, run trains every 90 seconds apart. In the US, most systems are limited to 6 minute (!!) gaps between trains due to the ""safety"" regulation. Even after spending billions (yes, with a b) on new signal systems that can stop trains automatically (ie, do what self driving cars are trying to do), US regulations mean trains no closer than every 2.5 minutes.  Incidentally, both BART and Washington DC subways were built to be 100% automated. The trains are able to start, stop, open doors, do whatever the fuck they need to do and so forth on their own. And yet not once since the systems have been installed, have they been allowed to run alone.   In fact, DC (and probably BART) took away the automatic door opening feature so that the driver (who does nothing) has something to do. Why? So they stay awake. But wait, theres more! The drivers were so bored they opened the door on the wrong side of the train. So now the regulation is that after the train automatically comes to a full stop, the driver (who doesnt drive) must count 5 seconds out to be able to open the door (which the train could have done instantly and automatically).     Dont ever forget the American ability to use ""safety"" to completely destroy technology.   Automated subways are proven technology, but regulation has gotten stricter rather than looser."
urbanplanning,35kpgt,thebruns,-2,Mon May 11 20:13:03 2015 UTC,The driver is still in place as a result of the employees union. Truckers  should be able to grandfather their own jobs if their union is strong.  I'm all for safety.

urbanplanning,35kpgt,michelework,2,Mon May 11 23:31:16 2015 UTC,"The union is part of it, sure, but when BART and WMATA were built, there was no union, they started from scratch. Even without a union, they hired people to sit it the front and do nothing.   I 100% agree that self driving cars are going to be an enormous safety benefit. I cant wait. I am just disagreeing that they will decrease congestion and compete with HSR, and one of the reasons is the american system of over-regulating transportation based off of ridiculous safety concerns."
urbanplanning,35kpgt,thebruns,2,Mon May 11 23:56:26 2015 UTC,"You think after just a year, that people will trust giving up control of their car to a program? Have you ever been in the passenger seat of your own car when someone else is driving? They could drive at exactly the speed I do, but because I am not in control it feels way too fast!  I love cars, I love driverless cars, I'd be what most would call technologically savvy and an early adopter. I need minimum a decade+ to see how this shapes up before I'd fully trust it. You know how a computer runs slower and slower after a few years of use? Cars need to be able to do 30+ years, often with sub-standard, incompetent or ameture maitainance. I don't have faith that the technology is up for that and probably will not until I've seen it survive longevity.  You know what has decades of test? Trains. Trains are by far and away the safest form of travel per passenger. Yes when a crash happens it can be big, but those kind of incidents are years and years apart! That doesn't change the fact that the roadways are by far, by an order of magnitude, more dangerous."
urbanplanning,35kpgt,auandi,-3,Mon May 11 22:48:05 2015 UTC,"I think if cars today had a giant button in the middle of the dash labeled autopilot , the vast majority of drivers would mash that button in an instant. Google is approaching its millionth mile of accident free autonomous driving. Once the technology is release its tipping point will be quick. No parent will alllow their distracted teen to take the wheel of their own car. I wouldn't. I sometimes drive a large truck. All day long I seem women driving with one hand on the wheel and the other on their lap texting away.   I can't wait for that to end."

And what you're talking about as a shift? That's a generational or possibly multi-generational shift. Not a year. Cars being produced today will be on the road for approximately 30 years. Even if tomorrow, 100% of all cars came with this, you'll have at least 15+ years before you'd have a majority of cars with it in.   Change is slow.   Not to mention, people over-estimate their own driving ability (after all, 80% of drivers describe themselves as ""above average"" drivers). Peoplle are also are much more willing to accept risk when they feel ""in control."" People are terrified of flying, what if the engine dies, what if the pilot messes up? But you're more likely to die driving to the airport than flying in a commercial plane, yet no one fears driving to the airport. If you're behind the wheel, that ""risky behavior"" as you see it is something they feel they have control over and so they don't see the risk."

Say what you mean, don't couch it in marketing. A AV-lane, while I can see the benefit for busses, move less people, less quick, and less efficiently than this proposal. The CA HSR debate isn't really about AVs anyways - they should only come in to the question is we're talking last-mile station to final destination issues.  Also, just to get it out there: AVs are going to operate far more efficiently in cities with mass transit than cities without it. The two modes are complimentary, not substitutes - even AV barrackers will cede that point. To argue that we shouldn't invest in either HSR, regional rail, or mass transit and wait for the AV god to lead us to land of milk and honey is downright asinine."

First of all, we use red bricks only in places where we want to calm traffic. We use it because it looks nice and because clay is an abundant material in the Netherlands. Secondly, we do use asphalt wherever comfort and noise reduction is important (which is every street with a speed limit of 50km/h and up). Also, we prefer our bike lanes to be asphalt or concrete; tiles or bricks are considered inferior for bike lanes. And any street that's going to see a lot of heavy traffic will have asphalt rather than brick too, since brick streets get warped so easily. And warped streets are full of puddles after rain. Drainage is done by slightly slanting the street and having proper drainage gutters on the side. Which is one of the reasons we tear them up and repave them so frequently.  While this does allow more frequent redesigning of the street layout, it is not actually the reason we do it."

Permeable surfaces lead to better drainage but they result in MASSIVE frost heave whenever it dips below zero, resulting in serious warping and road damage.  Cost of material and install is also huge, with asphalt being a fraction of modular material. The labour alone to install a crossing compared to a hot mix patch of comparable size would be several times more. Quick fixes for minor defects ala potholes would not be realistic, and those are hard enough to do on busy streets when all you have to do is apply bitumen bonding agent and level some hot mix to grade. Trying to do that with modular brick would be a nightmare."

Doesn't mean you should do it if you don't like the idea.  If you can, do architecture and get experience through co-op and courses with landscape architecture, public policy, etc. Try to work with firms doing urban design and masterplan projects.  Ultimately it's a crapshoot getting into the field, but you can try to set yourself up for success."
urbanplanning,35mjaa,kluzuh,2,Mon May 11 19:22:26 2015 UTC,"Architecture is a life sucking major and it is in a large part artistic and philosophical, more so than technical. If you love architecture/design and know that you want to do it, go ahead, but don't expect to sleep much.  The job market is pretty crappy but architecture is also a super versatile degree. Although mostly in the design field. Civil engineering will make you more money and give you more opportunities as soon as you graduate and continue to do so for the rest of your life. But if you don't like it that doesn't really matter.  Keep in mind that many schools also have undergrad degrees in sustainability studies, urban planning, urban design, building sciences, and a ton of other things.  Check out your options.  I'd suggest going to the website of the planning department for the nearest large city and shooting some e-mails out to ask if anyone would be willing to sit down with you to talk about career options.  People can be surprisingly open and willing to give up a little time to talk to you.   Trust me, they know a lot more about what types of jobs are available to you because they've likely had multiple job changes in their lifetime and have looked at many options.  Also check out GIS, esri, and maybe look into some programming languages. A lot of interesting stuff is going on with urban planning software  Anyway, the point is, don't limit yourself to those two undergrad tracks. Look around."
urbanplanning,35mjaa,SultanPeppar,2,Tue May 12 00:16:49 2015 UTC,"Any reason you're not considering landscape architecture?    always loved design  passionate about sustainability, walkable cities, bicycling and opportunities for low income/minority populations in large cities   ...because that's landscape architecture, and VT has a great program. Also, about many Urban Planning programs, Tech included, they focus more on policy than design.   If you're worried about the job market, then yes, architectural design-oriented jobs can become tough to come by during recessions. That doesn't mean you'll be jobless. A good program in architecture, and VT has an excellent one, will teach you how to think like an architect, and that skill translates into many disciplines. Going into civil engineering pigeon-holes you into civil engineering."
urbanplanning,35mjaa,exposeyourself2art,2,Tue May 12 17:14:18 2015 UTC,"I will recommend you to study architecture, if this is your strength. Do keep in mind that since you will be in a design background, your design skillset can be transferrable to a lot of different industries - you don't have to limit yourself to being an architect working at an architecture firm. People change careers multiple times in their lives, but it is the transferrable skills that will set them apart.   While money is a factor in a career, doing what best fits your personality and strengths are key in long term happiness. I personally wished I studied landscape architecture in college (I liked what I studied in college) - it would have opened more doors toward design related opportunities that I am able to create. While I do have a planning related job, I feel that I would have been able to provide more value with a design background even in my day to day job."

At Tech you can get a certificate in an area of interest/might want to consider a minor in architecture if you are passionate about it.   Internships and in the field experience with local government or an engineering firm during the summer would be a great way to build your resume. Blacksburg is a bit of a bubble when it comes to finding good opportunities for internships so you may want to look back where you grew up (if it is a bigger area).

Civil engineering will be equally affected by another recession as large scale projects being put on hold.  I wouldn't make your decision based on job prospects is all i'm saying - the two are on par except for salary.  Architecture would be FAR BETTER at preparing your for urbanism.  The types of reading, classes and assignments you will complete are better suited for it.  Civil engineering is going to largely focused on the math.

urbanplanning,35g9qt,Darthran,7,Sun May 10 04:36:27 2015 UTC,"Your undergrad degree tends to matter less in planning. That's partly because many of us don't find planning until later, and partly because you usually need a master's to advance.  That said, kudos to you for being interested this early. You have an opportunity to explore planning broadly. What aspects of transportation are you most interested in? You could use your upcoming summers to do internships at a variety of agency types. Different levels of government plan for transportation in different ways. Municipal might be more focused on engineering if they're smaller, or managing a CIP if they're larger. You could get opportunities to plan and implement specific, unique things like a new streetscape, signal interconnect program,  truck routing plan, and/or a ped/bike plan.   Moderate-sized cities vary. Depending where you are, you could work on a similar set of things to the municipal list, or larger scale projects like new interchanges, a small scale transit system, asset management, etc. You might also work in a big city - these offer a breadth of opportunities. Bigger regional planning entities - MPOs, transit agencies, toll authorities - often focus on project management, evaluation and implementation, so you might learn about best practices, modeling, performance-based programming, project management,  transportation finance, and politics.  You're at an exciting spot. Pursue urban planning coursework that interests you and try find out more via internships. As far as coursework, it's hard to go totally wrong your first year unless you are interested in a purely engineering path. Pursue what you're interested in, get a decent grounding in the field, learn the basic skills, and you'll have plenty of opportunities.  Edit: AutoCorrect is a pain."

I was taking some graduate classes in National Security Studies at the time and decided that I would look into how to get into transit. Fast forward about a year.

First, the alignment of the bikeway through the intersection introduces a significant amount of deflection for the straight path of bicyclists. This will unnecessarily slow bicyclists down, and I worry may create some ambiguity to drivers as to their intended path. Bicyclists have yield priority at this location, but the design does not reflect that.  Second, the wide corner radii and multiple receiving lanes will result in high speed right turns. One of the design principles in a protected intersection is the idea that turning cars will need to slow to a speed compatible with bicyclists (10-15 mph) so that they will be properly aligned with the bike crossing and have a chance to yield.  Also, this is an untested design in the US. Did you face pushback in your office or from your client for this proposal?"

I could not get my hand on the dutch crow manual. I still Haven't. I did the design properly but I had many iterations and changes from the city, and the client. These studies are meant to be schematic to not scare the city or town with drastic modifications. This is a very heavily used road by all modes of traffic. Also many, many driverless vehicles. The design will change about 2-3 times before it is built. But what is important is that they have secured funds to go to the next phase.

There's also the fact that on multi-lane roads it can be downright hair-raising to cut across traffic in order to reach the left-turn lane.

The fact is, roads would last quite a bit longer if heavy trucks were banned. That said, banning heavy trucks is not possible so any increase in road infrastructure funding (new gas taxes presumably) should be skued towards commercial vehicles.  It's my belief that raising gas taxes  2-5 cents more for diesel fuel will help pay for this additional road wear heavy trucks do to our road system and help balance the burden."

While cars cause less damage per vehicle, they are a horribly inefficient use of space and form of personal transportation. In an ideal environment, privately owned cars as a means of personal transportation would be extremely limited, and most (urban) road users would be commercial/public transport etc. It's beneficial to everyone that we do our best to discourage personal automobile use rather than punishing commercial vehicles.

Also with regards to:   ...we should be looking to help the market function efficiently...

It is about recognising that there are considerable costs associated with them when we make decisions about which solutions we prefer and to what extent they should be used to promote mobility. The true costs of a car-dominated transportation system are typically under-represented by a wide margin, and this makes it difficult to argue against construction or upkeep of road and parking capacity in many cities.  Policy-makers, economists and traffic engineers are often afraid it will hurt the economic productivity, which it might in the short term. In the long term there are many benefits from reducing car-dependency (which is not the same as eliminating cars). If the true costs were acknowledged it would appear a lot less economically viable and we would see a more balanced mixed of investments.  The problem is very severe in transportation planning since all cities depend heavily on federal funding, which in turn means a massive appraisal system to rank projects against each other. Because projects that favour car-based transportation have a lot of hidden costs that are not included in appraisal they will always out-compete active or public transportation solutions on paper. This skews the investment priorities even for cities that want to adopt a different system since they can't get any funding for it unless there are dedicated application rounds for those specific types of projects."

Third, it doesn't get at the main usage for a mileage fee which would be to charge more for mileage on congested roads at congested times and less for mileage on uncongested roads."

However, this debate again only focuses on the benefit of the road to the person who actually travels on it. We all benefit from transportation systems even when we don't personally travel on them (because they keep the rest of the economy flowing), so we have decided to subsidize all of them with public tax money.  There ought to be better discussion of how much they are each worth subsidizing (because of their different positive and negative externalities to the surrounding communities) and a better discussion of what is the most efficient way to collect user fees where needed to cover the unsubsidized amounts (congestion charges on busy roadways probably make a lot more sense than making bus drivers wait and collect money at every stop)."

urbanplanning,352t4l,superiority,1 point,Thu May 7 20:29:24 2015 UTC,"How does it over-charge ordinary users and under-charge commercial operators? My understanding is that the gas tax collected from the driving on most roadways isn't enough to cover the maintenance done on those roadways, even if you restrict consideration to roadways that don't have big trucks driving on them. Which suggests that the system is undercharging everyone (though perhaps it's under-charging big truck operators more so).  And yes, we do have large user fees for bus and train use - probably a lot more than makes sense in fact."
urbanplanning,352t4l,easwaran,1 point,Thu May 7 22:18:02 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that the gas tax collected from the driving on most roadways isn't enough to cover the maintenance done on those roadways,    Right. Gas tax is collected from drivers, and a variety of other taxes are collected from the population at large, including non-drivers. All these people fall into the ""ordinary users of roads"" category.  But the damage to roads rises approximately with the fourth power of weight. A 40-tonne truck will cause around ten-thousand times as much wear on the road as a typical car. Are the operators of these vehicles paying anything like ten thousand times as much as everyone else?  Well, looking at fuel taxes:  If the average combined federal + state gas tax is 45 cents per gallon, and the average mileage is 25 mpg, then a typical driver will use 40 gallons to drive 1000 miles, and pay $18 on that gas.  If the average combined federal + state diesel tax is 50 cents per gallon, and the average mileage for a long-haul trailer truck is 6 mpg, then a typical driver will use 167 gallons to drive 1000 miles, and pay $83.50 on that diesel.  If we set the $18 from an ordinary car as the baseline, then large trucks should be paying in the tens (or maybe hundreds) of thousands of dollars to the government for every 1000 miles they drive, depending on their weight class. Do they pay anything like that? Are there other taxes charged to them that make up the difference?  Freight companies receive an effective subsidy through this tax structure, then. They're not paying enough to cover the costs of their own use of the road. The burden then falls on the general population, who, it follows, are being over-charged."

Rather, the tax on gasoline should be conceptualized along the lines of the excise taxes on alcohol and tobacco - it's an extra cost that the user has to pay to make up for the damage that they're causing others by using this particular product.  (There should also, separately, be a fee for driving on a congested roadway, to disincentivize people from that bad behavior, but again, both of these should be separated from the monies that pay for the roadways.)"

Point well made, but I'd add the caveat that in the United States this a reasonable generalization to make, but there are plenty of models in Europe and Asia that achieve far higher recovery ratios, or utilize other revenue streams (real estate, particularly in Asia, and neighborhood-specific transit taxes for capital projects in Europe) that cover the provisions you've discussed and generate enough revenue to back bonding authority for capital investments. I'm sure you know this too, but it's worth reiterating.  As for return on investment, well the trendy catch word is ""value capture"", which I'd really like to see disappear honestly to be replaced by talking about the ancillary benefits of bike, ped, transit projects. Economic development, quality of life, and general mobility all rely in one way or another on effective transportation obviously, and those bike, ped, and transit projects can offer significant advantages over autos in these regards to improving these concepts - they just aren't ""taxable"" (some are, Hudson Yards and the 7 is a decent American example of TIF) so the return on investment is real, but hard to quantify"

Transportation networks benefit everyone, not just the users - businesses benefit from the possibility of customers, and everyone benefits from the mobility of others that allows the economy in general to function more efficiently. Thus, it doesn't make sense to try to get users to pay the full costs. Instead, it makes sense to treat these transportation networks the way we treat the legal system, scientific research, and (in many countries) health and retirement insurance - just pay for them out of the general fund, which can be supplied from a progressive income tax system, and include user fees only as a way to discourage wasteful usage. So it makes sense to have tolls and congestion charges on crowded bridges and bus routes, but to let them be free to the user otherwise.

Raised lanes work in Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, Seville, etc ad infinitum - simply put, it's the right way to do this. Right hooks are going to happen, they're going to happen in any system you can't design them totally out of the equation. There's nothing special about Americans and their relationship to biking, provided the same circumstance as the aforementioned European cities, people are people and are going to respond in similar ways. People don't park in the bike lanes in places with raised lanes (with exception of some delivery vans - but they aren't supposed to) and they don't jog or walk in them by and large (it happens, but you're letting perfect be the enemy of good).

Like I said, right hooks are going to happen. The Danish traffic board even tallies them up as a distinct statistic because, as you say, it's the toughest infrastructural issue in deploying good bike lanes. A raised lane is not an illusion though, yes it requires drivers to be more cognizant, but that's only going to come with experience in the system and education of cyclists. As for intersections, cut parking back a space or two, that offers clear sight-lines for bikes and cars, either extend the raise lane to intersection itself, or have it lead into a shared lane with drivers making the right - it sounds more dangerous than it is, but it's a common feature and one that works better than you'd expect. You can throw in some timed mode-specific traffic light signals to clear queuing cars and/or bikes too.   And you're right, you can't ship the whole Dutch or Danish system and plop it in Cambridge - but you can borrow best practices. A Dane driving in a car is no different than an American driving in a car, so while yes any idea needs to be localized to an extent, it doesn't mean that Boston has to develop a system by itself. One of those best practices is instituting raised lanes on road that can and should accommodate them - it's one piece of a broader puzzle yes, but it is an example of something that's good enough for the most cycle-happy cities and will be good enough for Cambridge."

But that all being said, I'll stand by visibility being by far my biggest problem on a bike.  Yes, I've ridden around long enough now that I'm more comfortable than most on the road.  I don't honestly know how to fix it :-/."
urbanplanning,352zv0,Steltek,1 point,Fri May 8 14:39:50 2015 UTC,"Please, no reason to apologize, I like the discussion! I think you're right-on when you say that visibility is paramount to safety. I think that when Americans talk about bike lanes, we focus a little too much on the safety side of the equation and ignore that the reason for bike lanes is (while also a question of safety) the only way to get more people to use the infrastructure, which should be our main focus.  Maybe I should've admitted upthread that I'm from Cambridge, but have lived (and currently live) several years over in Denmark. It's annoying, sure, coming from a city where biking is so useful to one where it's a little sparse, so it's a sore spot with me at a personal level so sorry if I'm coming off a little manic. I'm adaptable to both systems, but what sorta sets me off is when the debate in the US doesn't move beyond the ""this design works - no it doesn't, this design works - no you're both wrong, this design works!"" debate. I'd like to see our planners/community get a little more active in actually building the lanes, not arguing about them  And yeah, Huron is staying the way it is. When they ripped it up, the community came out and said ""we want protected bikes"", the city agreed, put them on the reconstruction plan and then....suddenly they disappeared. Word of mouth (since I grew up on the street) is that the business went right to council, gave them some dumbass shtick about losing business if there's a loss of parking, and poof no lanes."

I'm interested in knowing why you have an issue with it being a brownfield site, in particular? They've remediated it, after all.  I can see how it is not walkable in a monocentric sense, if we imagine the bulk of opportunities and trip destinations to be located in Buffalo's core, but if we consider that services/jobs/destinations can occur in sub-cores or along corridors like nearby Main Street (which looks pretty good on Google Maps, by the way) I think this area's walkability may be pretty decent.   It's also within walking distance of Buffalo's LRT, so if we're allowing for multi-modal trips the development's connectivity to the downtown may not be so bad."

My own inclination is just to build everywhere there are opportune/underdeveloped sites. Like a vacant brownfield on cheap land. Expensive land can preclude affordable housing, unless your nonprofit housing corp has a lot of capital or an extremely creative development model. Besides, it's not like brownfield remediation itself is cheap."

urbanplanning,353yu6,Mornic,2,Wed May 6 22:21:25 2015 UTC,"The methods totally depend on the project. For a person, the methods you need or must learn totally depend on what projects you want to do. At a high level, in school, future planners should have learned basic statistics (descriptive, basic regression, empirical research design, maybe survey design) so that they can be intelligent consumers of ongoing planning research. Cost-benefit analysis or pro forma analysis are essential for land use and development. Charettes and qualitative methods are essential for planners interested in community engagement.   One person need not be an expert in all methods. One planner might run the land use-transport models and then collaborate with a peer who can run effective charettes to get community feedback.  A couple things I'd add to your list. 1, design methods. Planners need to be able to use Illustrator and CAD to visualize their plans. Too often, graphic design and communication is turned over to architects and L.Architects because planners don't have the design skills to present ""BIG IDEAS."" This in turn means architects set the town for urban development and city design, rather than city planners who have a very important - and very different - set of skills, experience, and education.   2, coding and data science. Something like Python is very useful for compiling, manipulating, understanding, and visualizing data in appealing and compelling ways. This is a great tool for conveying information to decision makers and the public."
urbanplanning,3547j4,DuckDuckDOUCHE,3,Wed May 6 23:33:40 2015 UTC,"I'm studying Urban Planning at university, so I can answer a few of your questions.   My course covers a lot of those things. At the moment I think planning is becoming more people-centric. Less about bettering the built environment to drive economic development and more about bettering the lives of the people in the built environment (which also has the side effect of driving economic development). Universal Design is becoming more common. So I think there's definitely a need for perspective on this. There's quite a wide variety of jobs planning can lead to. I see at least 1 government job advertisement per week for urban planners. However, most of the jobs are mostly paper pushing (accepting development proposals, etc...). None of my coursework (past, present or future) involves maths. I can't really speak for on the job. But I can't see much math involved beyond calculating the areas of lots and building sizes. I think most jobs in planning have you stuck behind a desk all day using a computer. It's more catch-all. You could end up doing a lot of things from working at a local government office approving swimming pool permits to planning a state's infrastructure development for meeting the needs of the people in 2035."
urbanplanning,3547j4,deathwombat,1 point,Thu May 7 01:27:44 2015 UTC,"Universal design:       Universal design (often inclusive design) refers to broad-spectrum ideas meant to produce buildings, products and environments that are inherently accessible to older people, people without disabilities, and people with disabilities.  The term ""universal design"" was coined by the architect Ronald L. Mace to describe the concept of designing all products and the built environment to be aesthetic and usable to the greatest extent possible by everyone, regardless of their age, ability, or status in life.  However, it was the work of Selwyn Goldsmith, author of Designing for the Disabled (1963), who really pioneered the concept of free access for disabled people. His most significant achievement was the creation of the dropped curb - now a standard feature of the built environment.  Universal design emerged from slightly earlier barrier-free concepts, the broader accessibility movement, and adaptive and assistive technology and also seeks to blend aesthetics into these core considerations. As life expectancy rises and modern medicine increases the survival rate of those with significant injuries, illnesses, and birth defects, there is a growing interest in universal design. There are many industries in which universal design is having strong market penetration but there are many others in which it has not yet been adopted to any great extent. Universal design is also being applied to the design of technology, instruction, services, and other products and environments.   Curb cuts or sidewalk ramps, essential for people in wheelchairs but also used by all, are a common example. Color-contrast dishware with steep sides that assists those with visual or dexterity problems are another. There are also cabinets with pull-out shelves, kitchen counters at several heights to accommodate different tasks and postures, and, amidst many of the world's public transit systems, low-floor buses that ""kneel"" (bring their front end to ground level to eliminate gap) and/or are equipped with ramps rather than on-board lifts.

All the topics you're interested in sound a lot like what I'm into, and while we may be being romantic, I really hope we can make a difference in people's lives.   I think your perspective would be a valuable one. I know the city I'm living in now is really inaccessible, and could use some guidance in this. There are also more planning movements now that focus on planning for populations with more specific needs, in order to make the city better for everyone. One example is 8-80 Cities, who say if you plan for 8 year olds and 80 year olds, it will turn out great for everyone. Adding a perspective of disability to that would be valuable, I think. But again, I have no idea how the people who hire urban planners feel.  I have had a fair bit of math work in my course work. Mostly statistics, so that we can do good research and understand the implications of research. There are also some mathematical concepts involved in some of the mapping analysis software you can learn (GIS), but that's not an essential thing to study, just useful.

urbanplanning,34yibr,Ski_3143,7,Tue May 5 16:50:12 2015 UTC,"Hello hello my fellow small town planner! I'm so excited that there are people out there like me! :D  I started working in a small town (population approx. 21,000) last year. I come from the largest city in Canada so it was a huge adjustment. Needless to say, it provided me with great opportunities that I wouldn't have been able to experience in larger cities (i.e. in larger cities I would be the junior, junior, junior assistant planner. In a small town I'm the town planner and I get my hands involved in everything, not just special projects. --this is also the answer I give to people when they tell me to go back to the City. The truth is I'm learning far more now than I did in my previous jobs and more freedom to do what I need to do).  To answer your questions:  What do you wish someone had said to you before you started your job? Buy an agenda with A LOT of space. (my agenda is relatively small)  What's your average day look like? Because I am the only planner (aside from my manager who handles the larger policy directive files, official plan amendments and subdivisions) I do pretty much everything. My typical day consists of fielding a lot of calls and inquiries from residents who want to do a, b, and c and want to know if it is allowed, liaising with the building department and reviewing their applications to ensure it meets the zoning by-law, working on reports to different committees (here in Ontario, we can have a Committee of Adjustment for land division and variances from the zoning by-law) and council (for site plan approval, zoning by-law amendments, etc.), liaising and meeting with proponents/engineers/agents/realtors/etc. about the possibility of development in different areas, preparing the files, notices, etc, for all the applications we receive....quite frankly, right now I'm pulling 9-10 hour days to get things done on time.   What's your favorite part of your job? As mentioned earlier, because I'm the only planner I get to see everything and do everything - professionally this is a dream come true. Previously, I worked at the provincial level of government and there was so much bureaucratic involvement that your dreams as a planner go to die (you can ask me more on this if you wish lol). More importantly, I get to leave a mark on this Town, meet and get to know everyone, be a part of the community rather than some bureaucrat in a grey building, bring ideas from other areas, work with the Town's community, etc. I really feel passionate about how much potential the Town has and it is great because I can work so closely to make concept plans a reality.   What's your least favorite part of your job? It feels impossible to catch up on your work when you take a vacation. I just came back after 5 days of being away and I have felt like I've been sinking. Because we are running on a tight deadline (thank you, legislative timelines) I can't put off doing certain tasks. Also, multitasking is key - you really need to be aware of all current and potential applications (may this helps answer #1). There are some days when I have 'brain-fart' moments and I really feel lost. One needs to bring their A-game everyday, all the time. Also, because everyone in Town knows everyone, sometimes political will trumps everything - even though your proposal, recommendation or idea may be the greatest thing since sliced bread.   What's the best way to get in touch with what the citizens actually want, and then provide that? This is difficult, even for me. I'm technically a foreigner to them. I'm the young girl from the big city come in a farming Town. I'm compassionate and empathetic as heck so I really try to help the citizens rather than say ""no"". If a citizen comes to me and asks ""can i build this detached garage here?"", I would say ""It's not permitted here but let's see how we can work with you to get what you need in the least amount of time and least amount of money invested"". Walk citizens through the process as (almost handholding) and really build a relationship with them this way. Of course, this is through specific applications. On a greater scale you need to really document the phone calls you receive, read the paper, listen to coworkers, participate in social network groups, and try to understand what citizens value, what they complain about, what they take issue with, etc. This works well for me but it is an ever evolving process. Keep in mind that you are a professional first so I wouldn't do drinking with the local developer anytime soon ;)"

urbanplanning,34yibr,charlieab,4,Wed May 6 12:54:40 2015 UTC,"I started out in a small town office; there were six planners there.    Small towns generally are reluctant to change; everyone is established and comfortable and while changing things may be in their best interest, it will take them a while to trust you and then to accept you. So I would recommend keeping a record of things you would do differently, but waiting some time before going about it and trying to learn about why they do things and kind of gently introduce them to new ideas.  Average day was boring; there were several aspects of planning covered, that was good. But their policies made it difficult to prioritize work/manage time.  Um, I suppose uh... yeah. Not much in the small office. Oh, I could walk home for lunch! Yeah, hot lunch every day was great. Also, all the extra calories made me fat.  Pay day! I didn't really like the job; I was the youngest person there by like 10 years. I didn't get any mentorship; the only facetime I got with the boss was when I screwed up (so like twice in three years); I didn't get any traction with any of the ideas I had to make the place better; and the Admin Assistant was incredibly incompatible with my personality. Meh. Life is better now.  Consultation is a big topic of discussion. In your role as historic advisor, I would say that your expertise in determining heritage characteristics on individual buildings trumps public comments. Where you should focus consultation is on streets in the area that people value for their heritage character as a whole. Keep in mind that the balance between private property development rights and public interests in planning is a key part of the role. Too much on private development may lose important heritage features, whereas too much on public comment (who don't have any skin in the game) can make restoration or preservation projects unviable, leading to demolition."

Many people look at cities as a huge waste of energy and resources, and yes they do use a significant amount, but the amount per user is considerably less than say the suburbanite user.  Given how dense NYC is, especially during day time, it's believable the energy use per capita is quite low in comparison to other major cities."
urbanplanning,34ul0j,Eddie-Spaghetti,-1,Tue May 5 03:59:33 2015 UTC,"Energy use per capita is mostly dependent on wealth and income. What cities win in efficiency, they lose in affluent citizens wanting even more. NYC is up there as far as net worth per square meter goes."
urbanplanning,34ul0j,hylje,4,Tue May 5 05:13:09 2015 UTC,"No, it isn't. Per capita electricity usage in NYC is about a third of what the typical American city uses. Large buildings are much more efficient to heat and cool than single family homes. Plus small apartments are much more efficient than single family homes."
urbanplanning,34ul0j,glmory,1 point,Tue May 5 12:48:24 2015 UTC,"Section 3. Energy efficiency of article  Environmental issues in New York City:       The city's unique density, encouraged by much of it being surrounded by water, facilitates the highest rate of mass transit use in the United States. New York is one of the most energy efficient cities in the United States as a result. Gasoline consumption in New York is at the rate the national average was in the 1920s.  The city's mass transit system, multifamily housing, mixed neighborhoods and the fact that greenfield land is no longer available to development, make building in New York very energy efficient. New York City has a larger population than all but eleven states, and consumes less energy per-capita than any.  The average New Yorker consumes nearly less than half of the electricity of someone who lives in Chicago and nearly one-quarter the electricity consumed by someone who lives in Dallas.

Wealthy New Yorkers might spend more on luxury apartments and restaurants, but wealthy suburbanites are likely to spend more on cars and large houses. Even a wealthy New Yorker spending money on eating out is probably more sustainable than a middle class suburbanite with a large, unconnected house who drives everywhere they go."

Self driving cars still have all enormous social, environmental, and economic issues that normal cars do. They simply change the mode of control.   Without investigating the potential benefits that shared automated vehicles (SAVs) can bring you appear to have dismissed them by extending the current paradigm. SAVs do so much more than change the mode of control. If you are open to understanding this better I can point you to some resources that will better explain than any brief forum comment.   We cannot afford to make the same mistake with autonomous cars as we did with normal ones. We cannot afford to spend billions shackling ourselves and our cities to personal vehicles.   Agreed - we should learn from the past - but we should keep an open mind on what the future might offer.  We get to choose the policies that will shape our societies in years to come, and SAVs offer opportunities that no other surface transportation has ever offered before.   The correct solution is not to make infrastructure for self driving cars, it is to make infrastructure for no cars at all.   Agreed - if we have to build infrastructure just for AVs then we have got it wrong.  If you read this report it says that continuing to build infrastructure that fits the current paradigm could well be wrong. Why build parking structures for cars that won't be parking there? Why widen freeways that don't need widening as SAVs see higher average vehicle occupancies that mean existing roads are more than adequate for our future needs? Why build LRT when the road system still has capacity and is already here, in place, ready to be used more efficiently?"
urbanplanning,34vp6w,J__rad,2,Tue May 5 04:46:26 2015 UTC,"I fail to see how self driving cars do anything but change the mode of control. It is pretty obvious that they do not. They are the identical form of vehicle, just with different control.  Trains can be driven by computers now. Does that make them not trains?  ALL of the ails that cars bring, self driving cars will also bring. They will still induce sprawl, destroy our environment, weaken our urban economies, and hurt our communities.  The only thing planners should be excited about is the prospect of self driving busses. Self driving cars are just a new technology for cars. They are still cars.   Don't let yourself be blinded by the hype. I get it, reddit believes that self driving cars are a technology akin to jesus incarnate. But they aren't. They are just cars with less human input. That is all. CARS, with less human input."
urbanplanning,34vp6w,CantabKBH,2,Tue May 5 12:08:14 2015 UTC,"I guess you are right. If we ignore the safety, sustainability, environmental, economic and time saving benefits that Morgan Stanley estimated would save the US $1.3 trillion/yr (median case) then of course, you are right.  As long as we ignore how transformative it would be to promote policies that would see average vehicle occupancy rise from around the current 1.2 to over 1.8, which would see us transporting all of the people that result from induced demand with even less congestion that we have today - in cities where all of the infrastructure needed to make this happen is already in place and the private sector will actually end up paying for almost all of this.  Personally I think it makes huge sense, in existing cities where the road infrastructure is already in place, to continue to utilise, and optimised, that incredible resource. But doing it in a smart and intelligent way that leverages the benefits of automated vehicles whilst mitigating the worst downsides of the private car.  Making existing cities walkable is incredibly hard, so why not use a tool that is a hybrid of both the existing private car and existing transit - that instead provides an on-demand and door-to-door service. That is best served by (at point of use) emission free electric vehicles that will give priority to pedestrians and bicyclists if that is what we choose.  Automated vehicles take ALL forms - from bicycles (yes these are being developed in China by Baidu), to suitcase sized sidewalk friendly deliverbots, to 2 seater enclosed self-stabilised 'motor-bikes'/segways to 2,4,6+ seater 'cars' vans to much larger buses. From vehicles that operate alone, to vehicles capable of forming trains. The new tech is opening all of these up as possibilities within the next 5 to 10 years.  Why do urban planners assume that this is being limited to an automated extension of the private car? Why are there so many anti-car prejudices being attached to consideration of future concepts around automated vehicles?"
urbanplanning,34vp6w,alexfrancisburchard,6,Tue May 5 13:37:00 2015 UTC,"Why are there so many anti-car prejudices being attached to consideration of future concepts around automated vehicles?   Because cars are what's being proposed by the report linked and by the think piece linked yesterday - both of which fall victim to an annoying habit of hyperbolizing reasonable benefits of AVs by obscene orders of magnitude. As you say ""SAVs offer opportunities that no other surface transportation has ever offered before"" - no they don't, they are a (slightly depending on context) more efficient and (slightly) more convenient optimization of current commuting patterns and personal travel. They said the same thing about the segway. And rollerblades.   This subreddit seems to be having an AV moment as of late, so to avoid rehashing points that have already been made and made well, I'll keep this short, ok I won't in hindsight:  When people say AVs, they mean cars. Not that there cant be other automated vehicles (busses and delivery trucks do show potential, but...have fun with teamsters and transit unions), but the only serious application of AV technology at stake here are cars. Cars are big, no amount of technology will obviate basic geometry and physics. None. And AV is likely to increase congestion in dense areas - you know the areas that people want to be. If anything, as the report linked yesterday admits, travel distances will increase with AVs, congestion will increase in certain areas (local roads, urban roads) and decrease in others (highways, arterials), travel times won't differ greatly in cities with existing rapid transit, nor have you talked in any concrete, non-technoevangelical way about the functioning of these cars (how are pull-outs for pick-up/drop-off handled, how is pricing determined, who maintains the fleet, where does the fleet go when not in use - beyond just ""it goes somewhere useful"", etc ad infinitum).   And here's the really crux of why AVs annoy the piss out of me - they are cool tech, do have exciting potential, but effective urban transportation, good urban areas were achievable 60 fucking years ago. ""Making existing cities walkable is incredibly hard"" is not correct, it's not that hard. It's a pretty rudimentary question of what do you prioritize: people, cars, bikes, transit? It's hard politically, not hard in theory. Why should planners ignore proven transportations models with wide-applicability and impressive capability that can, more or less, effect the same and often better results that you're advocating for with AVs? Why should they do it, especially when those models and technology capable of executing these programs was available 50 years ago?"
urbanplanning,34vp6w,victornielsendane,1 point,Tue May 5 18:05:16 2015 UTC,"Because there's no way in hell AVs will have an increase in capacity without restricting the movements of pedestrians and bikes on city streets. They might make some headway on freeways, but freeways honestly aren't always the choke points. The choke points are where freeways meet regular streets, with pedestrians, stoplights, and the whole 9 yards. Stoplights can't really be more optimized than they are because they're set for pedestrians to be able to cross the street. That is never going to change. Unless you advocate getting rid of all pedestrians, and if that is case, fuck you, you'd be destroying the world."

urbanplanning,34v2q9,patron_vectras,12,Mon May 4 20:22:33 2015 UTC,"This guy is a crank. He's pretending ignorance on many aspects of planning. I'll address some of his points.  First, it's a common tactic of libertarians to complain about what they call ""interventionism."" That's a loaded word trotted out when someone doesn't like something the government is doing. But urban planning doesn't exist because some bureaucrats just wanted to mess with people--it exists because of real needs. If courts are overburdened with citizens suing the factories they live near for pollution, and demanding that courts issue injunctions left and right, then it becomes a legitimate use of government to regulate land use. If subdivision developers are demanding roads and sewers to the houses they build, then infrastructure planning and subdivision law are legitimate functions of government, not ""interventionism."" If citizens gather to demand that their favorite landmarks be preserved, then historic preservation is a legitimate function of government. Etc., etc., etc..  The policies that he ascribes to a smart growth movement are actually just the best practices accepted by North American planners as most beneficial. For example, density is not an arbitrarily arrived at metric. Numerous scientific studies and surveys show greater urban density linked with a lower carbon footprint per person, lower infrastructure costs, as well as providing diverse economic, educational, and cultural opportunities for citizens.  He's trying to make it sound like planners just make up things willy-nilly and can't make up their minds. The truth is, our economic, social, technological, and environmental needs have changed over the last 100 years. He might as well criticize plumbers for changing their practice from using copper pipes to PVC pipes--how indecisive of them!  Oh, and talking about force and coercion? Again, this is a guy who comes into this believing in sovereign property rights above all, a position usually held by people who haven't read the history of why things are the way they are. But I'm sure this guy hates interventionism, like building roads and sewers and water mains. It's even possible that he drinks from a well on his property and pays for a septic tank service and paves his own road from his house.  His comments on eminent domain are completely irrelevant. It's not planners, and certainly not smart growth advocates, who are even involved in eminent domain for private corporate use--that's done by the courts. Then he tells some rambling story about land reserved for some environmental purpose, but his story doesn't go anywhere or have a point.  His comment on funding of subdivision infrastructure is actually something that smart growth advocates might agree with--not necessarily out of any ideology, but just because it makes financial sense to limit public expenditures on low-density areas that will have a relatively lower return in the form of tax revenue. But here, I think he's confused. Rather than understanding the suburban growth movement and smart growth movement as differing ideas that served different needs at different points in time, he tries to paint them as the same thing, dual aspects of this imaginary ideology he calls ""interventionism,"" as if planners were just sitting around, thinking, ""How can we best intervene this year?"" The truth is, planners are almost entirely beholden to public opinion. Their job isn't to hand down decisions from on high, but usually just to try to make some compromise out of all the competing needs of a community, according to open, democratic processes.   Ok, so I watched to the end of the video, but I still don't know--what are the unintended consequences? And what would the consequences be of not planning cities?"

He might just be a little exited or has an unreasonable stance on this. In any case, I think it is an extreme and odd statement that stick out from the rest of what I see as a sensible set of statements and arguments.

This is something I want to respond to. Sorry this isn't a full response comment, I should get back to this.   Ok, so I watched to the end of the video, but I still don't know--what are the unintended consequences?   Unintended consequence of Natl Highway system: solidification of car as dominant means of transport, bringing us car-dependant planning and relegating railroads to second-class land use.  Unintended consequence of car-dependant planning: Social stratification, urban decay, an institutionalized poor understanding of efficiant and dense planning. Also, excessive pollution.   And what would the consequences be of not planning cities?   As I said up top, it is hard to believe he doesn't believe in any planning. The idea behind a free market is not to have no regulation whatsoever, but to have decentralized regulation. We discriminate against quality and waste, foresight and foolishness, health and disease, or find privately organized advocates for sensible positions on these. A sensible advocate for planning in a city would be well worth consulting. He is either wrong, or misrepresented his own position. I might read more of his work as I linked below to find out. Judging by how much they cut the interview, he seems much more composed on paper."

A lot of planning, all mostly independent of each other, no one getting stuck on the corridors of the city hall.

urbanplanning,34rno5,janetnotjackson,19,Sun May 3 23:45:51 2015 UTC,"Indeed. Perhaps the biggest effect of this is that, except for important named boulevards, because streets are not named, they don't have to follow the western convention of a linear street (long, non-branching, wide). Instead, there's a dense mesh of streets of size varying from a normal 2 lane road to a tiny, pedestrian-only alley. And because there expectation of linear, continuous streets, the street network can split and branch wherever and whenever, with no awkwardness. Blocks are often multiple houses across, with inner houses reached by tiny pedestrian paths going between the houses or internal courtyards. But because the addressing system doesn't require that every property have frontage on a named street, merely that they belong to a parcel of land bounded by roads (guaranteed, even if it is the only house on the block), the system naturally handles complex and organic development much more gracefully than the European system."

New lots wouldn't necessarily have their driveways on the same road as their lot number, and might not even have a frontage there.  This, naturally, made finding country properties something of a wild goose chase, so some (perhaps all?) states assigned 6-digit grid references to the front gates (which, naturally, got out of date when people rebuilt their driveways), but the maps weren't widely available.  Now numbers have been regularised by being the location of the driveway in 20m quanta (odd on one side, even the other) along the road, with defined rules for which end is the start."

urbanplanning,34tr0i,wheeler1432,3,Mon May 4 14:19:30 2015 UTC,"I think it's better just to link to the study itself it isn't that long anyways.  Some caveats, I'd bring up before we plunge into the infallible taxibot utopia:  The report predicts a 90% of private automobiles in Lisbon, which it extrapolates to a broader a European context. A similar report studying Singapore, referenced in this report puts that number at only about 2/3rds of the current private fleet - it's a bit of an apples to oranges comparison (Lisbon to Singapore), but the 90% projection is, well, optimistic.   Total distance travelled increases under all of the scenarios we studied. Overall car kilometres travelled over the course of the day rose 6% in the TaxiBot system with high-capacity public transport and nearly doubled (+89%) in the AutoVot scenario with no public transport.    More travel means more wear and tear, means more maintenance dollars. It's not a deal-breaker, but absolutely something worth considering.   In all scenarios, we assume that shared self-driving fleets completely replace current bus travel in the city. In the base case, average bus occupancy over the course of the day is low (20%), and it is plausible that these passengers could be better served by a fleet of shared self-driving cars. The diversion of bus passengers accounts for approximately 30% of the final car kilometres travelled in the ride-sharing scenarios and nearly 50% of the car kilometres travelled in the car sharing scenarios.    That's a stretch. They haven't discussed a) how these autonomous vehicles rides will be priced - if it's too high then I don't see how they're substitutes for busses and b) an autonomously operated but fixed route high-capacity bus would be more efficient in many cases. A 60 footer artic can handled roughly 140-160 at crush capacity, far more efficient than a train of even mini-sized personal transit autos. Considering how much cannibalized bus ridership accounts for km travelled, I'd register a little skepticism with the utility of autonomous vehicles.   In turn the biggest increase in travel volumes in the studied scenarios occurs on local roads in areas without high-capacity transit (there are four classifications in the report: motorways, trunk roads, distributor roads, local roads), so the ""re-shaping"" cities argument isn't assured by any means, even by the reports standards. The reports brings up an important point in the local road volume increase: how do autonomous cars pick-up/drop-off people? Are current parking lanes going to disappear or are they going to be re-utilized as boarding/alighting turn-outs for automated vehicles?   The report itself concedes:   It may also mean a change in the nature of local street traffic resulting from the presence of additional traffic on what were otherwise quieter, less-used roads. Such an increase in traffic could have a negative impact on the attractiveness and livability of local streets, as it reduces their availability for non-transport use.     Even the travel time models predict an increase in travel times for peak hour autonomous car travel without rapid transit, and a roughly 30% decrease in private car travel time for cities with rapid-transit.   At the very, very least the report makes some interesting points, but my tl;dr of the whole thing is: a) autonomous vehicles are an improvement, not a panacea, b) there's a ton of regulatory and technological innovation that has not happened to make this is any way a possibility (fx, a single car would feasible travel up to 7x the average distance per day compared to current trends - that means a sturdier vehicle is necessary than what's available), c) rapid-, high-capacity transit is still a necessity and will become even more so in most cases, and d) the report present some reasonable good benefits of autonomous vehicles, but doesn't really get into the details of how the system would work (and the devil is always in the details), it then annoyingly makes from grand claims of the future of autonomous vehicles that are more hot air than provable assumption."

I believe widespread efforts to curb urbanisation do far more damage than they offer in return. What we need is a dynamic, tumultuous city that bends over backwards to meet our needs whatever the needs and desires might be. Not a static, regulated city that only offers depressingly high prices.

I can envisage car sharing, where you go in with a small group of people and buy a car to each use when needed, but considering most people want to move about at pretty much the same time, I can't see this being too common. Families could probably reduce the number of cars they own (car drops kids at school, then drops Dad at work, then drives itself home to take Mum to the supermarket, then drops her back off at home before driving itself to school to get the kids, and then back to work to pick up Dad), but this wouldnt reduce congestion.

My personal sense is that we're probably not going to see much net reduction in the aggregate driving times around a city, we'll just see a more efficient distribution of cars.   I can't find the info right now, but I believe there are some studies being conducted on whether or not Uber, Lyft, etc. will increase peoples likelihood of driving, because (like electric cars) it's cheaper, more efficient, and so on.   I think it all comes down to being explicit about what our goals are as planners: more efficient mobility around a city? Sure, keep going with the car-sharing, if that's all you care about. Do you want more equitable, accessible (monetarily and physically) mobility options that  have lots of other great co-benefits (i.e., better air quality, more active population, etc.)? Then build more transit, move towards more walkable cities. I think planners are justifiably suspicious of the sometimes messianic qualities attached to car-sharing and electric vehicles, though I do think we could articulate that a little more loudly at times to policy makers."

That's immensely more damaging.

What they ought to do is bulldoze great tracts of post-war ex-social housing and abandoned tin warehouses, of mostly lousy construction and no architectural merit whatsoever, and build new developments there. That would probably even be popular with the former residents if they get better homes in the preceding  development.  1 I don't just mean the aesthetics, although that's not unimportant, but also the economic effects of replacing a lot of separately-owned shops with single-owner complexes: smaller landlords and owner-occupied properties, with a wide variety of sizes and qualities, help promote independent businesses, whereas the large commercial landlords prefer to deal with major chains or franchises (who prefer to deal with them)."

The small-scale piecemeal development model would be a contender, but elaborate zoning rules make it very expensive to upgrade existing things—you have to re-approve everything at every turn. The developers working on a blank-slate model only have to approve everything once, having far less overhead.

I think if automated cars were widespread (and available as taxis), it would eventually dramatically reduce car ownership and people would be somewhat less likely to call up a car to be taken short distances.  I know people that will get in their car just to drive 6-7 blocks away. But if it costs 50 cents and they have to wait 2 or 3 minutes for a car to come pick them up, then perhaps they'll just walk instead and perhaps save the automated taxi ride in case it's raining or they buy a bulky item or something like that.

You don't need automated vehicles, the driver walking the last kilometre does the job too.   Then let the market decide the price for the drivers who wish to not walk too far, with no minimum parking requirements for development. You could combine a walkable-dense neighbourhood with mostly driving based transport like so. And do it today! If it gets popular, you can gradually rezone the near-end of the parking field for development and roll out some new parking beyond the far end."

Driverless cars frees you up to put the satellite parking lots 10-20km out of the city, which in larger cities may be necessary. And is still a benefit to people making commutes longer than 20km. Essentially, driverless cars give you the freedom to scale the idea infinitely; as long as the parking lot is closer to the city than the commuters residence, it provides a benefit."

For a lot of communities there is just no realistic alternative to driving. Those people are not interested in living in dense urban settlements and without some kind of massive authoritarian intervention they simply aren't going to adopt those kind of living patterns, at least not within the kinds of timelines we need.  With that in mind, because electricity is at least potentially low carbon, we need to aggressively switch as much as possible to electric. If you are serious about dealing with transportation emissions, there is no other remotely possibility. We just aren't going to get enough people walking and biking to solve this problem in time.

With bicycles and public transport the rural areas would be historically extremely mobile. Cars are very bad for rural areas as they suck money away from the community. A large portion of the spending in an area goes to buying cars and gas which is money that flows out of the community. Cars mean that people drive far to buy things and that kills local jobs and buisnesses.   Before every kid in rural areas could walk to school, today thanks to cars schools are centralized to towns. This means that the rural people pay taxes to a school that isn't in their community and the school doesn't create jobs where they live.  To stop climate change we need to reduce emissions by 80% up until 2050. Electric cars have more than half the emissions. Even if we made every car electric we would still have emissions that are way to high. The only solution is radically reducing energy consumption."

The city centre is the most important, but that doesn't mean that areas further out don't need their own neighbourhood centres. For a wider urban area public transport 'nodes' make sense as they can allow transport into a city centre/elsewhere and can also often act as centres of activity themselves where there is space for shops, employment, etc nearby if space is allowed for that to develop.  Haven't read anything by Jeff Speck though, might do that now."

Changing regional distributions of building density is one way to do it, of course. But we can also be improving walkability in suburban, low-density districts. Many of these kinds of communities tend to have corner stores, neighborhood shopping centers, and the like. Creating safe walking routes to these could help reduce VMT while allowing people their suburban-style housing preferences."
urbanplanning,34n614,6ca,1 point,Sun May 3 01:05:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think in those US cities with many barriers, focussing on the centre should probably take priority, but barriers cause issues with walkability so you might only end up with a very dense, walkable 'island' which is very attractive but disconnected from areas outside. That's where good public transport comes in, connecting outlying areas.   I can only speak for the UK experience though. My own home city, Glasgow has similar issues with significant regeneration in the city centre but a large river and an urban motorway cutting around it. There are still large swathes of ex-industrial land waiting to be developed with a 10 minute walk to the city centre, even though the city has been growing. This growth is concentrating in the existing built-up areas either in the city centre, or areas slightly further out which are well connected by public transport and leaving a belt of underdeveloped land.  Though I wouldn't draw too many similarities due to the difference between UK/US cities, the effects of barriers on urban development and walkability are universal. Pumping up the core can only go so far if you don't take efforts to remove/mitigate the effects of these barriers."

Both, the CBD downtown Seattle and the Loop in Chicago have about 20% rates of car commuting. That's because there's little parking, driving is incredibly painful, and walking/taking the train/bus/bike are very easy. Cities should focus on a single core and do it well first. Do what Chicago and Seattle have done. Creating multiple dispersed cores makes it harder to have good transit service. Concentrating everything in one area makes it easier to serve with transit, and more effective.   Actually, Seattle's Satellite Downtown - (bellevue) is starting to have worse congestion than Seattle Proper (because it is hard to serve with transit, and thus everyone must drive there).   If our cities were tiny like asian cities (geographically) then, yeah, we could have a few cores in our 100-200 square mile cities. But our cities take up 2000+ square miles each (Chicagoland is nearly 10,000 all suburbs included IIRC)   Chicago City is 230 square miles, and does have multiple cores (Illinois Medical District, Hyde Park, O'Hare, //Evanston Kinda - is hardly out of the city) with one incredibly dominant one(Loop/Downtown). The city has been focusing on that one main core and has been incredibly successful in doing so. It's starting to spill out towards and merge with IMD slowly. Chicago needs to continue to focus on and improve its downtown area. Many of the neighborhoods near downtown have been bouncing back rapidly as people look for places to live in a short subway commute to downtown.   This works fine inside the city because they are all close together (IMD is 1 mile from downtown on 2 subway lines, Hyde park is 7 miles out on a more frequent service commuter rail line and with good express bus service, Evanston is at the north end of the subway system, Ohare is at the northwest end of it)   What we need to do is release density restrictions near existing downtowns and allow lots of housing to be built near them - which will extend and enliven them. Once we get that going REALLY well, then we should start focusing on outlying cores, but no city in this country seems to have the money to support more than one right now. Serving lesser cores is very very expensive.   If we have secondary cores they really shouldn't be more than 10 miles from the main core because much further and the economics of serving them adequately break down pretty badly. I mean, Seattle and Bellevue are a mere 7 miles apart, and the traffic between them is horrendous. We're building light rail out to and through bellevue, so we will see if that helps, but that is really expensive.   I guess a big part of it depends on what you define as a ""whole city"" If you mean the core city city limits, I suppose, sure we can have multiple cores inside the main city. If you mean in the whole city-region - hell no. Extra cores outside the city just fuck traffic up horribly and always end up underserved and making things considerably worse."

You can make up the high value of land by building things closer together, building smaller things, and ultimately by building things on top of each other.  Thing is doing that is illegal. All high priced places are already built up to the legal limit. Too bad there's no legal limit to price!"
urbanplanning,34n614,hylje,3,Sun May 3 07:59:57 2015 UTC,"Actually most American cities have large surface parking lots even in there most expensive areas. Lining these parking lots with small box development (20 ft deep row buildings with no setback) would be a fast cheap way to improve walkability.   An even cheaper idea is to simply allow street vendors and food stalls, and maybe rent them space in the parking places next to the sidewalk -- one vendor per parking space.  But as you say, zoning disallows it. People look down their noses at flea markets. But how else can you get a start with no capital? I think zoning laws are one of the main causes of urban poverty in America.  One of my favorite examples of this is Taco Bell. Nothing against them, I have eaten there from time to time. But how in the world did a taco stand get to be a capital intensive business in a country where millions of Mexicans live? Taco Bell can only survive because it is basically illegal to open your own hole-in-the-wall taco stand.  EDIT: You don't even need need to use parking lots in many cases. Look at the intersection of Fremont Avenue and Riggs Avenue in Baltimore. It is an absurd waste of space. Shutting down Fremont between Riggs and Pritcher and simple routing the traffic around the new square would open up a huge piece of open land. Then the city could have a barbeque contest or some other events on the square. The body shops near there probably have welders that could build a barbeque push cart. Planters with wide rims allowing seating could be used to block the roads. The city could provide folding furniture and beach umbrellas in the summer, paid for by rent charged to whatever vendors pop up.  Would it work? Maybe. It did on the Sunset Triangle Plaza in Los Angeles. It works in a lot of places in Brooklyn and Queens, like Corona Plaza. Would it spread? Impossible to say. But it would be very cheap to try.   If you look at European cities you can see they grew up from the merger of multiple centers. Planning how this is going to work probably won't work very well. The best idea is to do things that are cheap and see where it goes."
urbanplanning,34n614,NumNumLobster,2,Sun May 3 09:27:35 2015 UTC,"there is no incentive to develop those lots to that minimal intensity though.  Its not a zoning issue its a real estate valuation/opportunity cost issue.    When you see those properties used as parking, it is because they are waiting to develop them into something bigger.  The ability to do this is what gives them value, not their parking use.  Building row buildings costs more than you can recoup in a few years probably, so its really pointless.  By building you are destroying the value of your option to build something bigger since you have to tear them down.  Zoning isn't whats keeping 1000 taco shacks from opening up either.  Look to your health departments, tax/legal compliance, etc for that."

They don't get any revenue from through traffic, but tolerate through traffic so that some of it will stop and do business for them.  Transit operators, city governments and toll road clubs can still deliberate the need for and then strike deals to rent or buy whatever space necessary for additional public spaces, transit lanes and through-traffic lanes under their respective authority. But that's not necessary. A lean city government can just leave the streets to the respective properties lining the streets, guided only by a generic rule of law that there should be a public street network connection to each separate property—with few reservations on what that connection actually is."

In arid Southern California, ""rain gardens"" does send the wrong message that they need to be irrigated, but in reality drought tolerant plants work great.  The purpose of a rain garden is to ""detain"" the stormwater runoff and allow it to percolate back into the soil, or in some cases go into an overflow pipe.

urbanplanning,34frna,smid17,4,Thu Apr 30 19:49:01 2015 UTC,"I can't give you an exact number, but it's my impression that in most jurisdictions, schools are not permitted by right (i.e. the zoning code says that in this area, you are allowed to build a school if you comply with the parcel requirements), but rather by conditional use or special use permits in certain zoning districts of a city. Of course, that does mean that there are places where schools are explicitly not allowed to be. But where they are allowed, they must apply for special approval.   This is because there are a lot of land use factors that are fairly unique to siting a school. These include traffic (both car and pedestrian, and heavily concentrated in mornings and mid-afternoons) as well as environmental (you don't want a school near a factory or landfill, generally).   Theoretically, if you zoned certain blocks or areas of the city only for school uses, what might happen? Traffic impacts might be intensified as many private schools flock to build their facilities there. You might also have a less-than-ideal distribution of school facilities in your city. So schools are generally treated separately from other typical uses, and are usually allowed by special permit in residential zones. That gives the public, planning board, and city council opportunities to determine whether the plan for the school is appropriate."

There are so many wide six-lane arterial roads in LA county where you could add bike lanes and not even give up any car lanes.

I've heard LA is pretty similar, despite their recent transit strides."
urbanplanning,34c6lo,TheBestPlaceEver,4,Thu Apr 30 18:12:15 2015 UTC,"To Kansas City, which is very similar to mpls in many ways   No way. They are completely different. They have similar populations in city limits, but the similarities end there.  Kansas City's population is about 466,000, but its population density is just 569.2/km2 (1474.2/sq mi) whereas Minneapolis's population is 400,000 but its density is 2813/km2 (7287/sq mi).  Yes, Minneapolis is almost 5 times denser than Kansas City. That is a gigantic difference. MPLS has roughly the same number of people in 150 km2 (58 sq mi) that KC has spread out over 826 km2 (319 sq mi).  Granted, the Minneapolis metro area is less densely populated than the city proper, but its metro population is also larger (3.4 million) than KC's (2.3 million).  That has major consequences. MPLS's walk score, transit score, and bike score are 65, 58 and 79. KC's respective scores are 32, 34 and 40."
urbanplanning,34c6lo,eobanb,2,Thu Apr 30 20:19:59 2015 UTC,"KC is so large that it's not worth discussing as a single unit - I meant more the area called ""Midtown"" or the core, that stretches from the river to Waldo. It's definitely comparable to the urban form of minneapolis."

urbanplanning,34c6lo,RaccoonDispenser,2,Thu Apr 30 14:29:02 2015 UTC,"I think very few people consider how reliant they are upon car transportation until it is no longer there. One car accident and you're suddenly having to share rides, bike, or take the bus, if those are even an option. That these are seen as a ""backup"" rather than the first choice is problematic. We should invest more in transit to have these seen as the better option or even enjoyable, so when someone is in that position they end up taking transit out of preference."
urbanplanning,34c6lo,aensues,2,Thu Apr 30 18:12:34 2015 UTC,"Transit is a decent backup but not a very comfortable status quo.   You want to get everyone close to their commute destinations regardless of wealth and income. Transportation from afar should be something you elect to do because you value space more than commute time, not something mandatory because it's simply not possible to live within your means closer by."

Also, if I understand the yard sign in the photo correctly, the proposed response to the threat of gentrification is a minimum lot size regulation? How does that help?

urbanplanning,34cxb7,glmory,7,Thu Apr 30 03:31:08 2015 UTC,"Shoot the messenger. Developers and investors work within the terms of the market. If policy discourages redevelopment and encourages ownership, that's what's going to happen.  Policy could encourage redevelopment by not only tearing down most zoning rules and making the remaining ones quick to process, but also by providing grants to developments in high-value locations.   Policy could discourage ownership by employing land-value tax, making owning land not an inherently attractive option: the desirability of that land makes its way to the land's running taxation even if it's not developed at all. To profit off a piece of land, it must be developed. Excessive development means more profit up front.  Policy has everything to do with making the right thing also the most profitable thing. High profitability means we're going to get more of it."

urbanplanning,346z8o,Gamma_Ram,30,Wed Apr 29 01:28:20 2015 UTC,"Every other freshly minted planner wants to get into NYC, Boston, Chicago, LA, SF, Portland, or Seattle - always the same hip cities.  Your first job will NOT be making LA a car-free city, doing some  buzzword urbanism installations in Austin, SmartCode calibration (with no T3 transect, because all suburbs suck, amirite?) in Oakland, or planning for the return of streetcars to Brooklyn.  Unless you went to a top tier school and graduated towards the top of your class and have a phenomenal thesis or project and have connections, your first job will probably be a three-and-out as an assistant planner in Dothan, Goldsboro, Wichita Falls, Enid, or another fifth- or sixth-tier city, just like tens of thousands of planners that entered the profession before you.  Because 500 young planners applied for that Planner I position for the City and County of Denver, but only five bothered to apply for the Planner I job in San Angelo, and after nine months of proud-brony-on-OkCupid-level rejection from the God Tier cities you read about every day on CityLab, you've got student loans to repay.   Los Angeles?  Maybe if you're lucky, you'll land a phone interview for a distant suburb like Temecula or Yucaipa.  Hope you went to school in California, because the first question you'll be asked on your interview from is ""What do you know about CEQR?""  New York?  Competing against the hundreds of planning grads from schools in the city, for a handful of CDC and assistant planner jobs that don't pay any more than what you'd earn a couple hundred miles upstate in Utica or Oswego.  You better know SEQRA, too, which makes CEQR seem like a Sunday walk in the park in comparison.  Vancouver or Toronto?  Despite the favorable treatment of planners in NAFTA, the hiring practices of Canadian municipalities tends to be Canada-first-Commonwealth-next-USA-no-way-eh; they'd sooner take in a planning grad from Australia or South Africa than from south of the border.     Anyhow, once you get settled down in Alamogordo, Rolla, or Killeen, you'll be processing lot splits, boundary line adjustments, sign permits, setback variances, and if you're lucky, maybe helping out with a corridor or neighborhood plan.  Much as you hate, hate, hate cars, you'll have to suck it up and count those parking spaces on that site plan for the new CVS, to make sure they've got at least 1 space per 200 square feet of gross floor area.  Three handicapped spaces plus one per 2,000 square feet GFA.  9' x 18' stalls.  24' wide drive aisles for 90 degree angle spaces.  Landscape islands at each end of every row of spaces, and interrupting islands to break up rows into runs of 10 spaces or less.  Driveway throats at least 20' deep, or 40' if there's more than 50 spaces.  A dumpster enclosure located where the front end loader can get to it without blocking the drive through aisle.  Don't worry, it's just for a few years, until you get a body of work on your resume that reflects planning in the real world, rather than some theoretical studio projects inspired by Interurban Queen.  Then, you can move on to better opportunities, in Greeley, Nampa, or maybe even a suburb on the southern fringes of Tacoma!"

As a planner in the public sector, you ensure the developers meet development standards and work with other departments to ensure their standards are met as well.   I wouldn't call it degrading though, and as a planner in a county with large rural areas, cars are necessary. There are parts of the job that are rewarding, like helping the average citizen navigate the zoning code. It's not an easy job though, that's for sure."
urbanplanning,346z8o,beard_lover,5,Wed Apr 29 08:01:18 2015 UTC,"I feel like that's just ridiculous.   I know.  CVS, Walgreens, Rite Aid, and the like usually provide way more parking spaces than what the zoning code calls for, so you really don't have to count spaces.  Save your strength for the rabbit hole you'll find yourself in when deciding if the Walgreens mortar-and-pestle logo displayed above the front entrance is a window sign or wall sign. It's behind a window, but the only purpose for the window is to show the sign, so it functions like a wall sign, and the code really doesn't clarify things much, because it was written by an old school attorney in 1988, in extraordinarily dense legal English that reads like it's from 1788, and the sign code guru in the next town over says it's a window sign, the guru in the other town over says their Board of Adjustment considered it a wall sign ...  Seriously, planning is a lot like psychology.  The adage ""first the patient has to want to change"" is true, whether we're talking about humans or cities -- only cities are far more complex.  There's the same stages of change - precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, maintenance, and relapse.  A large part of our job as planners is guiding communities through those changes.  The end goal is to make a community better at what it is, not turn it into something it isn't.    Humans are like animals - they need a variety of habitats to thrive.  Monocultures are fragile systems, both in nature and the built environment.  The biggest opportunity in planning, IMHO, is creating the conditions where more walkable urbanism and missing middle housing are options; in a sense, making the human habitat more diverse, and thus more resilient.  That's the premise of transect-based planning, one of the building blocks of new urbanism.  Planning requires a blend of idealism, passion, and pragmatism.  There's so many great tools and ideas out there, and a dogmatic approach only limits what you can do. If you believe that there's one right way, one right form, one right practice, it also limits your opportunities, and your potential to be a real agent of change."

You can look at a map or Google Street View to verify this.  The only way to expand the road network is to knock down buildings around it. Robert Moses tried that. There is plenty of literature around that. Just look up Robert Moses.  It is not possible to expand road transport. Transit expansion is barely possible. This is not a problem. Transport in central parts of NYC was designed around the fact that people will walk. This is a reasonable design goal.

Jefferson put this grid system in place everywhere and standardized this as the american survey system in order to aid with western expansion. this used lines of latitude and longitude and broke blocks up int square miles. they used one base line road and continued every 6 miles til they came to the border of whatever township was being planned and then went back and did this east to west. the finished product was a grid of 6x6 square mile plots. these plots were then subdivided into smaller plots and that is where we get the word subdivision."

During the 1950s and thereafter, the US and Europe adopted very different urban plans; Europe built dense, urban cities with rural land separating them while the US built sprawled-out monstrosities. Due to the massive sprawl in US cities, American rail corridors have an order of magnitude more at-grade crossings than their European counterparts. At-grade crossings limit the speed of trains, and add enormous costs and regulatory burdens, making high-speed rail in America less feasible.  To put it in perspective, a high-speed train traveling along one of Europe's first  and most celebrated high-speed rail corridors, from Paris to Lyon, only passes through about 10 miles of suburbs. A train traveling the same distance from Miami to Orlando has to pass through about 100 miles of suburbs. The same can be said of corridors in the US Northeast, Bay Area, Chicago metro and LA."

You may also want to consider contacting the city council, mayor, or other elected offices. They will have more incentive to serve constituents and help you get what you want.

urbanplanning,33wxhc,victornielsendane,42,Sun Apr 26 12:31:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly most of you are starting in the wrong end. If you have a spread out city and you try to turn it into Amsterdam it isn't going to work.  The key concept in urban planning for decades was mobility. How can we move people as far and fast as possible. Lets say average Joe wants to go to the gym, how do we get him there? A 50s planner would talk about bigger roads, better parking etc. A more 21st century approach is put a gym next to average Joe making him not have to travel to get to the gym.  Trying to create mobility by taking away cars and installing bike lanes and side walks isn't going to work. They are slow and short range. People who live 10 km from the mall won't bicycle there regardless of bike paths, except for a few sporty people the rest will just be stuck with narrower and more expensive roads and people will just start hating 21st century urban planning and vote for cars back.  The solution is density. If you don't want people driving to work put work and homes in the same place. If you don't want people driving to shopping centers build stores where the people live.   The number one priority must be get commute distance down. Once that is achieved then the rest is easy."
urbanplanning,33wxhc,kristallklocka,9,Sun Apr 26 15:07:20 2015 UTC,I agree! But how do you increase density in suburbia in a sustainable way?
urbanplanning,33wxhc,zangorn,11,Sun Apr 26 17:36:35 2015 UTC,"Zoning laws and lending rules are the biggest obstacles and the biggest opportunities.   The optimal city blocks are demonstrated in the great European cities. There are two key factors, height and mixed use.   Buildings need to be between 4 and 12 stories tall to provide the density to justify a fast transit system and to attract businesses on the ground level of key buildings. Mixed use means residential upstairs and business on the ground level, and potentially upstairs as well.   Most cities and suburbs in America zone areas for either residential or commercial but mixing is not allowed. So we have all these houses with no restaurants, shops or jobs within walking distance. That's the ""American dream"". So that needs to change.   When cities allow mixed use there are often height limitations. In a most of Los Angeles, 3 or 4 stories is the maximum allowed. That needs to change.   And when a developer wants to buy and build or renovate a property to be mixed use, the banks treat the loan application as if the entire property is commercial. That means it's more expensive. The rent from the apartments is lower than the businesses so there is little incentive to invest in a mixed use project. For your money's worth, it's better to just make it all commercial. That needs to change."
urbanplanning,33wxhc,mapsareuseful,14,Mon Apr 27 00:39:33 2015 UTC,"Increasing density in suburbia is a capable process. The ideas of New Urbanism and more specifically Smart Growth are the answers.  To save you from reading, Smart Growth focuses on taking places like the suburbs, and creating new definitions of centrality. Instead of having a radial approach to a city (where it grows outwards from one central point, leaving the suburbs on the perimeter), we want a poly-centric approach (where there are numerous ""centres"").  The essence of this is mixed-use planning, as /u/kristallklocka suggests. Try to think of the essential things of daily/weekly life that we use, and put them within a reasonable distance to people's homes. The benefit to suburbia is, given that its supporters were so bent on the concept of space and openness, this means that there is a convenient amount of space and openness!  edit: I couldn't leave my comment at that, I think my explanation is a little lacking and I just want to share so much more!  Something New Urbanism/Smart Growth encourage is called Transit-Oriented Development; pretty self-explanatory title. So take the city of Burnaby, BC (I'm Canadian, sorry for the specific example if you're not familiar). This city is largely a suburb of Vancouver, BC. What the Greater Vancouver Area did in it's 1990's phase of regional planning reform was encourage the spread of their SkyTrain LRT. This meant extending the stations out into the suburbs and having a larger reach (that may seem obvious). But the awesome phenomenon of Smart Growth meant that these stations then became little nuclei for development. A smart business owner would want to put her cafe near the station, plenty of customers to come by. From there, a liquor store might open up, a provincial services office, and before you know it a small community can form around an LRT station. What was once a stopping point between home and work has now become the end point for your travel (with the convenient option of hey, hopping on a $3 train to visit Vancouver). You've got a two-fold win, a) people have less reason to commute somewhere else in a car because amenities have become local b) the transit station can serve as the main method of transportation for the reasons that people still commute into the larger city for (without the headache of gas/parking/traffic).  As the saying goes: If you build it, they will come. Regional development on a micro-scale."
urbanplanning,33wxhc,zangorn,6,Sun Apr 26 17:55:32 2015 UTC,"This is happening very well in Los Angeles of all places. The city has been expanding the light rail network for about 30 years, and really ramped it up since 2008 when a ballot initiative passed to use a sales tax increase to fund metro rail projects. The rail network is getting to critical mass now, where it covers enough locations that living by a station has real value. The effect of that is impressive TOD (transit oriented development) projects springing up around the stations. Trendy shops and big apartment buildings are being built around  a lot of stations. So, it's a chicken and egg thing, but having a light rail with stops where people need to go works.   The Beverly Hills crowd working might not sell their cars, but new graduates starting their first jobs might move to LA and never buy a car in the first place if they move into a convenient place and have a job near a rail stop."
urbanplanning,33wxhc,mapsareuseful,3,Mon Apr 27 01:18:38 2015 UTC,"Interesting! But if you take suburbia. You have all the houses, gardens and garages etc. And you make centres around the place so more people have close walkable access to shops, services, restaurants and so on, will the businesses have enough customers? Aren't the people still at the same density or do the centres also include living space? I've heard of tentpoles, is that it?  Edit: Answer to your edit  That sounds like what we have in the Copenhagen area, but I think we have a problem regarding that. It's great idea, but you need to limit the area around the stations. I live in Albertslund near Copenhagen, which is one of these station cities you talk about, but I live in the far north of the city, and it makes any commute to Copenhagen 15 minutes longer, because I need to bike to the station."
urbanplanning,33wxhc,hylje,2,Sun Apr 26 18:06:46 2015 UTC,"Good point!  The suburbs are essentially an untapped market. They developed as a place to drive you car away from the city to sleep until you returned to the city the next day. This is why, for example, it is not common place to have a small movie theatre down the street from a suburban cul-de-sac, everyone just drove to the city for the movies of-course. If an amenity like this showed up closer, would anyone still drive their car to the further location? Of course not! The problem with suburbs is that they typically lack most amenities (because it was assumed you owned a car and could reach the existing ones!).  But the fun doesn't stop there. Though the number of consumers does not seem to be the problem, these solutions actually do lead to growth in numbers. You know what people love more than a huge backyard that takes effort? Money. Off we go again to Vancouver. The phenomenon of laneway houses (or coach houses) is essentially building a second home on your massive suburban lot because it can be rented out and end up being profitable. When people recognise that the square footage of their lot can be used more profitably, they will build accommodation for more people. Thankfully that accommodation is now within walking/biking distance to most amenities, and a $3 LRT ride to the rest. This type of residency is ideal for the economic-class of people without much money and cars (like recent graduates, new families, etc.).  It's making something out of nothing!"
urbanplanning,33wxhc,hylje,2,Sun Apr 26 18:45:39 2015 UTC,"Good point with the incentive for people to make more people use of their land. Like ADU's, but is that what people do? I see that's what they have done in Vancouver, but I have also seen many business go bankrupt, because there weren't enough customers in the area. But if you make dense housing in the ""tent-pole"" area, it could work."
urbanplanning,33wxhc,Mornic,3,Sun Apr 26 19:16:23 2015 UTC,"In general, you don't.  The thing with adding density is it's much harder to create density out of thin air than it is to add it next to something that already has the infrastructure to support a high density—an urban core. Density is inherently undesirable so it needs to make up for it in superior services, culture, lower costs, etc. etc. It's hard (expensive) to kick-start a new dense urban core from scratch. There are few processes in our societies to make expanding existing urban cores practical and fresh new urban cores are not practical, period.  The other thing with density is that it fits a lot of people. Once you get rolling, you quickly start running out of people who would like to move there. You'd be draining existing suburbs and lesser downtown areas to fill your new amazing high-density neighbourhoods with life. You're not playing Cities Skylines where rezoning an area for higher density magically conjures new residents out of thin air! The people who come in are leaving something else behind.  The question you need to ask is not really about sustainability, but whether your political powers that be are deathly afraid of urban development happening at all. They might have everything to lose if urban cores lose their rarity, and if their suburban voting base disappears."
urbanplanning,33wxhc,handburgare,1 point,Sun Apr 26 21:31:37 2015 UTC,"But the development should be focused on making the urban cores instead of spreading out. Then the people wouldn't be the problem anymore, cause you would be making room for them anyway."
urbanplanning,33wxhc,ThePlanckConstant,4,Sun Apr 26 21:44:54 2015 UTC,"Urban cores spreading out is not really at all a problem. They spread on top of existing (less intensive) development.

The solutions can be looked up from a reference textbook once one stops making excuses to not solve the problems."
urbanplanning,33wxhc,handburgare,2,Sun Apr 26 22:25:28 2015 UTC,"The key concept in urban planning for decades was mobility.   No, it was traffic. There is a world of difference between planning for personal mobility and planning for car traffic. Mobility is essential but there are more than one way to achieve it.  I don't disagree with your points on solutions, but I'm so tired of people conflating transportation concepts like traffic, mobility and accessibility. Its part of why things got so shitty in the first place, thinking you can only provide mobility by facilitating more car traffic."

Something definitely needs to be done about the size of cars and pedestrian safety. I wouldn't mind max-sizes where you pay for escort vehicles if your vehicle is larger.  The electric bike is a wonderful development in bikes, we need bike lanes to be safe because they allow everyone to keep a near constant 25km/h speed with ease. Even heavy cargo bikes loaded with children and groceries. They're also costly, so we need secured parking at public transportation stops.  I don't feel that we have really relearned how to build good public places. It is important that we get get back to that, the best ones tend to be from medieval times. Ironically the best modern examples I've seen are these motorway outlet villages if you ignore the huge car park around it. They want to create a place where people want to hang out, typically the opposite goal of most public places. The buildings are just one floor and maybe a second mock-floor facade to define the space better. And of course, you're only welcome if you're a spender."

Another 5-30% of trips are by train, comparable to many European and North American cities. The remainder are by car.  This is possible because Japanese zoning does not prohibit intermixing of different land uses, so stores, restaurants, and various useful services are distributed naturally through primarily residential areas, with most houses not being more than 5-10 minutes away from such a place. Also, streets are generally quite narrow (10-25 feet) encouraging slow/less automobile traffic on residential roads, while also making walking very pleasant. The net result is a very walkable built environment, not because it shuns cars per se, as Japan also has one of the best roadway and expressway systems, but because zoning allows many essential services to be within walking distance.  It's worth noting that Japanese expressways are not subsidized (neither is public transportation though), and tolls are high in order to recoup their cost, and succeed in passing the true cost of the infrastructure onto users. This significantly improves traffic, and is what allows transit to operate profitably, because it is no longer receiving unfair competition. Also, in order to purchase a car in Japan (except for ultra-small kei cars) one must be able to provide proof of parking at one's house, as streets generally do not have free (subsidized) parking."
urbanplanning,33wxhc,autowikibot,9,Sun Apr 26 15:35:51 2015 UTC,"Narrow roads are surprisingly important for density. I find that Tokyo is quite flat further out on the subway lines. Houses are 2 maybe 3 floors max. People tend to live in houses that remind me of a Fischer prince toy house, a door and a tiny garage with a box car that fit exactly. To make that dense you need narrow roads and houses standing wall to wall next to each other.  Medieval towns also have narrow networks of streets. The scale of everything makes things very pleasant. However the streets are often curved and short and generally difficult to orient yourself in. We need some kind of modern medieval."

In Zürich there is frequent (6.5-10 minute, late night 15 minute until ~midnight) transportation.  I don't yet know the land use planning, but its really hard to live someplace not within a few minutes walk of a grocery store within the city, and its never a long tram ride to get to major services.

urbanplanning,33wxhc,RollerRagerMD,1 point,Sun Apr 26 16:19:59 2015 UTC,"Section 6. Switzerland of article  Disc parking:       Many cities in Switzerland borrowed the blue zone concept in the same way as in France with a maximum time of 1 h 30. In cities like Basel the blue zones meant that parking lots were marked with blue lines where the scheme would be effective while other (non blue) parking lots were free. No other signposting was used in these blue zones to mark the controlled space - instead the parking discs showed the regulations on the back side.  A later development in Switzerland was the introduction of red zones allowing for a maximum of 15 hours. This scheme required another parking disc that would allow for 24 hours to be shown.  The EU parking disc design was introduced in 2000 and the old designs abolished in 2003. This gave rise to some confusion among car drivers since the old parking regulations denoted ""1:30 h"" of maximum parking time while the new parking regulations imposed a limit of ""1 hour"". Since this time is rounded up to the next half of an hour there was no real difference however. The blue zone parking lots were kept however in the same way as before so that the new disc parking scheme reads as follows:     Interesting: Blue Zone | Pay and display | Mount Pleasant Square   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

We have another issue in Stockholm, lots of suburbs consisting of multi family houses, but standing quite far apart in random ways. They were built in the 40ies and on, there are local squares and spaces for shops. Families lived in small 50 sqm / 500 sqft apartments. Today singles live in those kind of apartments. The density and customer base doesnt exist, plus people dont go to the butcher, the bakery etc, but to the store that has it all. And if they have a car, they drive to larger shops further reducing the customer base.  The fact that people live alone and want much space is something we have to compromise on. More floors to allow for larger apartments, houses closer together (and narrow roads), but also better engineered small apartments. There are extreme examples of moving walls to functionally have something like 5 rooms in one."

That doesn't preclude the success of urban places though. Most European countries never gave up their walkable cities while also building sprawling suburbs.

Lots of people may want to live in inner neighborhoods but its hard to get all the benefits if everyone still needs to drive to jobs out in the sprawling office parks.

It's comparable to a city center job-wise but lacks any basic pedestrian infrastructure. Even getting lunch requires getting in a car and driving around even if it's across the street (or should I say highway). Not only is it terribly unsafe and uncomfortable to walk, it's almost impossible with surface parking lots, drainage ditches, multi-lane roads, and weird mounds. Sometimes large companies will build office campuses, separate from any other use, further emphasizing the need for cars. In cities like Houston, many of the jobs are not downtown , but are instead in the suburbs such as sugar land and woodlands. While that can be good, without development alongside transit/TOD strategies, this becomes a nightmare to develop walkable city strategies. People don't work or shop downtown as much anymore (though hopefully that is reversing!)"

Even if people are driving an extra ten miles a day as a result of their housing location, it's going to take many years (perhaps decades) of that driving to have as much environmental impact as the destruction and construction of an extra building. The important thing is to figure out how to shape new construction patterns so that they make the existing buildings and communities more sustainable, and not just try to replace everything at once.  Also, while we definitely overuse cars in contemporary urban and suburban life, it doesn't make sense to try to eliminate them entirely. There are certain particular activities, like furniture shopping and fire fighting, for which motor vehicles make by far the most sense. The question is just how to best enable those activities while not radically incentivizing people to overuse automobiles for everything else."

urbanplanning,33wxhc,leathersosoft2,7,Sun Apr 26 17:18:46 2015 UTC,"This is a very interesting discussion topic, but one I feel doesn't have one simple answer.  I'd say that step one is to make driving pay for itself, and then some. Make people pay the true cost for their car, and it suddenly becomes less attractive to own one and live far away from everything. Road tolls, higher vehicle taxes (to pay for the health care costs driving leads to, both for drivers and pedestrians), more expensive parking - and no subsidies or easy solutions to storing your car if you live in the city centre and so on.  At the same time, city planning needs to focus on high-quality public spaces and transportation, both which becomes more viable as population densities in the cities grows (people moving closer to the services they need). This also puts more focus on refurbishing and infill plans (not sure if correct terms, this isn't the language I work in), not to make housing unavailable for people with less resources available.  As driving becomes less desirable, people will start paying more attention to these things and demand better solutions for pedestrians and cyclists. But step one is to make driving a lot less desirable."
urbanplanning,33wxhc,Barney21,2,Sun Apr 26 14:14:22 2015 UTC,"I think another outcome of making driving less desirable, could instead of getting a demand for pedestrian/bike solutions be a demand for getting driving more desirable again, and if it didn't it would hurt the economy, because people have less money.   I think it's better to create better solutions for pedestrians and cyclists to start with so the demand for cars will fall - and then you can make driving less desirable."
urbanplanning,33wxhc,DJWalnut,3,Sun Apr 26 17:33:01 2015 UTC,"One of the best ways I believe to do it is by increasing density. Living in a university area with easy access to inter-city transit and with a gym, grocery store, pharmacy, various coffee shops and restaurants within a 10 min walk means I haven't even considered getting a car and I ideally want to live close as I can to my work so I can continue to not need one. A lot of cities becomes dense due to geographical limitations, such as New York City which has 3 sides water and had no where to go but up.  One thing I heavily support to increase density is Ontario's Green belt http://www.greenbelt.ca/ The Toronto area started to become sprawling with suburban housing and since there were no geographical areas to stop it, they banned most developments in the green area on the map. They allowed the sprawl to happen a bit more, but very soon when the green belt is hit then there will be nowhere to build but up if you want to be connected to Toronto (a rapidly growing city)."

You can live out in the middle of nowhere, and the state will still build provide you with millions of dollars worth of infrastructure, paid for mostly by the cities.

urbanplanning,33wxhc,DJWalnut,1 point,Mon Apr 27 08:22:58 2015 UTC,"Well to move people away from use of the car requires a significant change in mentality. The car symbolises personal freedom and mobility. Public transport and bicycles can't compete with this, not today atleast. If a population in a city is heavy realiant on car, any design choice by city planners going ""against"" them will be met by dissatisfaction/resistance.  Taxes and regulations on use of car is one possible strategy.  If one is pursuing such a strategy it should be accompanied by investment in public transport. A safe, reliable, and clean public transport system. On top of this, design a walkable and bicycle friendly city.   Build more compact. Build higher. Design for mix use. Apartments, jobs, services, school, etc all need to be relatively close to eachother to reduce reliance on car. We want to avoid a ""sleeping city"" where no jobs are situated, and where everyone drives to work in the morning, and drives back in the evening.  Overall it requires a change in mentality, buidling more compact, developing a public transport system of great quality, some form of taxes and regulations, and designing a city where one can get around with bicycles and walking.  But at the end of the day, all these policies and strategies won't get rid of the car. The car is here to stay. Even if say 90 % of those who live in the city's inner area use public transport/walking/bicycle to work or school, the car will still important for them terms of recreational use. Not everyone can live close to where they work, go to school, and for many of these the car is simply too important to give up on."

In all cases, they lack one or both of empirical backing or a technical description.  For example, the first statement about the ""Circular City"" arrangement:   The central dome or theme center will house the core of the cybernated system, educational facilities, access center, computerized communications, networking systems, health and child care facilities.   What is a ""cybernated system""?   The Venus Project calls for a cybernated society in which computers could replace the outmoded system of electing politicians that in most cases represent the entrenched vested interests. This new technology will not dictate or monitor individual's lives, as in The Venus Project this would be considered socially offensive and counterproductive.   How is this done?   Eventually the central cybernated systems will coordinate all of the machinery and equipment that serve the entire city, the nation and ultimately the world.   But how do you make it happen?   For example, in the agricultural belt the computers could automatically monitor and maintain the water table, soil chemistry, and coordinate the planting and harvesting of crops. In the residential sector, the system could maintain environmental cleanliness and the recycling of waste materials.   Who will implement this technology?   These proposals, from an engineering standpoint, seem fantastic and unfeasible within the present monetary system; and they are. The sums involved in ventures of this magnitude would be too huge and inconceivable. No government today can possibly afford this prodigious undertaking. All of this could only be accomplished in a resource-based world economy where all of the world's resources are held as the common heritage of all of the earth's peoples.   And so we go to the ""resource-based economy"" proposal, which is equally full of holes.   Simply stated, within a Resource Based Economy we will utilize existing resources - rather than money - to provide an equitable method of distribution in the most humane and efficient manner. It is a system in which all goods and services are available to everyone without the use of money, credits, barter, or any other form of debt or servitude.   Again, there is no technical description of how this is accomplished.   To better understand a resource-based economy, consider this. If all the money in the world disappeared overnight, as long as topsoil, factories, personnel and other resources were left intact, we could build anything we needed to fulfill most human needs. It is not money that people require, but rather free access to most of their needs without worrying about financial security or having to appeal to a government bureaucracy. In a resource-based economy of abundance, money will become irrelevant.   The problem with money, if any, isn't that we use money to communicate how resources are allocated - it's that we have a generally unfair distribution of money. We can debate about whether money needs to be fair, ways in which fairness can be achieved without changing the nature of money, or specific proposals for replacing money with another mechanism, but if it's left at ""just"" removing money, the only thing one could expect is mass chaos and a violent power struggle.

We've since then learned that that doesn't work very well, and Maidar looks better: I see transit in the plans, and hopefully it'll be nice to get around as a pedestrian or cyclist or whatever you'd prefer.  It's still plopping a city down where there was nothing though, which means that there might be … some discrepancy between how the planners imagine the city will be used, and how it will actually be used. It's a huge project and I'd be surprised if they get everything right on the first go. I might be influenced by modern software planning ideologies though, which tend to be rather iterative.  So it's both a city and an experiment. Hopefully one that will work well, and that can show Ulaanbaatar how to alleviate its problems.

Norway's not as big as Mongolia, but we're pretty sparsely populated, and there are several policies in place to keep it that way (i.e. to keep the whole country settled).  As for avoiding the resource curse, well, with the way the oil prices are going, we'll probably be headed into some rough waters.

The name Soyombo is derived from the Sanskrit word Svayambhu (meaning ""created out of itself""). It serves as a national symbol of Mongolia, to be found on the Flag of Mongolia, the Coat of arms of Mongolia, and on many other official documents.  The elements in the symbol are given the following significance (from top):   Fire is a general symbol of eternal growth, wealth, and success. The three tongues of the flame represent the past, present, and future. Sun and moon symbolise that the Mongolian nation will exist for eternity as the eternal blue sky. Mongolian symbol of the sun, moon and fire derived from the Xiongnu. The two triangles allude to the point of an arrow or spear. They point downward to announce the defeat of interior and exterior enemies. The two horizontal rectangles give stability to the round shape. The rectangular shape represents the honesty and justice of the people of Mongolia, whether they stand at the top or at the bottom of society. The arga-bilge (Yin-yang) symbol illustrates the mutual complement of man and woman. In socialist times, it was alternatively interpreted as two fish symbolizing vigilance, because fish never close their eyes. The two vertical rectangles can be interpreted as the walls of a fort. They represent unity and strength, relating to a Mongolian proverb: ""The friendship of two is stronger than stone walls.""    In the Soyombo script, the two variations of the Soyombo symbol are used to mark the start and end of a text. It is thought to be possible that the symbol itself may predate the script.

Chicago is a rapidly gentrifying city with huge budget shortfalls at the local and state levels. Chicago proper is also pretty much the same size as Minneapolis' metro (2.7 million in 227 sq. miles v 3.7 million in 8,100 sq. miles). Maintaining the infrastructure and providing affordable housing for nearly 10,000,000 people is never and will never be easy, but multiply that with poor government officiating and you're going to run into some major problems.

Though the strengths highlighted (with the exception of public transportation) are true, the ability to expand in every direction makes the Minneapolis/Saint Paul metro area different than Chicago.  As people move closer to the cities, you can live in a suburb and be 10 minutes from downtown, or can live in the city and experience city life.  What you can't do is live in a suburb (or most of Saint Paul/Minneapolis) and take public transportation to work.  Chicago may not be livable for most without a car, but Minneapolis/Saint Paul is almost impossible to live in without a car.  Revisit this discussion in a couple of months and see if the Republican's thrashing of public transportation happens, and see what the effects are in a couple of years. They want to stop all light rail expansion and cut spending to buses.  A poor way to continue growth, moving away from cars is the way to increase the draw of a city."

urbanplanning,33mrhp,Hiptalamus,4,Thu Apr 23 20:00:54 2015 UTC,"Look at older cities for inspiration, a lot of them have very good design. Paris has a somewhat planned shape, while London grows randomly. Both have adopted tight streets and not quite high rise buildings (5-7 stories).  Cars mean reliance on petrol, and congestion is inevitable for any larger city. A city built carefully from the start would have a well thought out tube system, combined with streets designed for walking and cycling.  A flat, motorway-like cycle lane system could provide a very quick way in and out of the city. Greenwich to central London takes about an hour in traffic, but a cycle lane between them could cover the distance in less than 10km, if that lane was flat and separated from crossing traffic you could probably make it in 30 minutes or less.  In a Utopian city most people would spend their travel time walking and cycling. They'd be much fitter than others.  Building codes would be simple as possible. ""Brick, less than 5 stories, etc"" these would then form as a guide for designers with planners approving flexibly. Buildings will use LED lighting and efficient district heating. Zoning would not be restricted beyond what is absolutely necessary (dangerous chemicals, etc).   In a Utopian city rent would be relatively low, as barriers to constructing new homes are low. Most will live in work near to home, although it's not unusual to travel further.   The city would have a well defined limit, which is expanded only when the city really needs it. In warmer climates roof top solar panels gather energy and save homes from hot sunlight.  Ecologically, the impact of a utopian city would be pretty small, much less than if people lived out of the city. Power demands would be very low, thanks to proper insulation and sun protection. Lack of cars means people use little forms of other energy. Unlike most cities, which slide through farms, wetlands and forests this city will only use the land it needs.  imo"
urbanplanning,33mrhp,bbqroast,2,Fri Apr 24 01:20:06 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by ""efficient,"" and why is that your primary ideal for a utopian society? Efficiency is one of many metrics, and like all others it has its upsides and downsides. A perfectly efficient city can still be uncomfortable, aesthetically displeasing, etc. So first I would say try to get a clearer idea of what you're looking for.  If by efficient you mean ""uses as few resources as possible"" (while maintaining a First World quality of life, I assume), then as /u/bbqroast said already, you'll want to design for lots of walking, cycling, and convenient public transit. High-density development is more ""efficient"" in the sense that it uses fewer resources per person compared to single-family suburban developments.   There are a few centrally-planned cities you can look for for inspiration. In the US, Washington, D.C., is a good example, as one of the few major cities that was planned and built from essentially nothing. As a resident, I'm biased, but I think Pierre L'Enfant's plan was quite a good one, creating a predictable street grid cris-crossed by broad avenues that lead to parks, roundabouts, and public squares. These days, unfortunately, we have a housing shortage that makes the cost of living very high -- but that belies enormous demand, meaning lots of people want to live here! So, your utopian city might consider how to retain a desirable, livable city that is also more affordable and accessible to those without high incomes.

A mixed bag overall but definitely no more isolated high-rises.  The city council have still been making some pretty atrocious planning decisions recently... i.e. the recent Buchanan Galleries approval, the George Square fuck-up, and the shambolic management of the Fastlink bus lane. It's increasingly likely that the current party who have been in charge of the city council and therefore planning the city for a long time will be booted out soon, so it'll be interesting to see if the new lot will take a more enlightened approach.  Also the population is predicted to grow by about 100,000 in the next 20 years or so, and the city council have stated they are looking into a grand plan to choose where the new housing for this growth will be directed and in what form it will take in the long term.

In contrast, an urban protected bike lane(including Minneapolis) is a piece of transit infrastructure used by large numbers of people in their daily lives.   There is a certain amount of overlap, but generally speaking trail are not that big a deal, there is little friction because they are added to large open landscapes.

In fact, if you blindly obsess over making all streets two-way, you'll prevent people from building residential streets narrow like they should be. And from a traffic engineering perspective, they're a pretty cheap and effective way to get substantial traffic flow out of a residential street. The fundamental problem here is that we're asking too much of that street. It can either be a quiet residential street, with narrow lanes, obstacles next to the roadway, or a high traffic road, with wider lanes and fewer dangers. Of course, when we convert a residential road to a high-traffic thoroughfare, it will cease to function as a proper residential street.   But the fundamental sin is not them being one-way, it is trying to make them high-capacity in the first place. They were built too wide in the first place, and parked cars served as only a temporary stopgap to reduce traffic speeds. What we should have done is make the residential roads very narrow, one or two way, with very little/any on-street parking, and use the saved space to make proper arterial roads that are designed to handle the traffic properly.   There are many serious advantages to using one-way roads for arterials too. It greatly simplifies intersections, making them both safer and higher capacity, and allows freeway-like speeds and capacities with far smaller infrastructure costs by building things at grade.  So the problem here isn't the one-way roads themselves, which are half-decent solution to the problem, but that we're trying to use residential roads to actually move people around in the first place."

The problem is trying to make them high speed, not trying to make them high capacity.  Interestingly, capacity actually falls when speed increases, because safe following distance increases with the square of the speed. That means density (cars per mile) falls faster than speed (miles per hour) rises, so maximum throughput (cars per hour) falls as speed increases.  A road at maximum capacity with 20 mph traffic carries twice as many vehicles as the same road with 50 mph traffic."

Roads serving the latter function aren't inherently bad, but are certainly less able to fulfill the first function. We need transportation, and as long as cars still are a part of society, and I don't see them leaving, high speed and capacity roads remain a very important part of fulfilling that need. And if a one-directional paradigm can permit such roads to be cheaper, safer, and more space efficient, which it seems it can, then of course we should support them. And of course, we must make the conscious choice which function a right of way will fulfill, as it cannot do both effectively.   Yes, they do not contribute to an active streetscape, as that is not their function. They serve in the single-minded pursuit of moving cars, so of course they are not well suited for walkable streets, shops, houses, or indeed anything but moving cars. But that's ok, because moving people is important, and despite their many disadvantages, cars still do a pretty ok job of that. I'm not saying all streets should be high speed, high capacity thoroughfares, quite the opposite. Nevertheless, they are a necessary part of the urban transportation infrastructure."
urbanplanning,33iiiy,SpaceLord392,5,Fri Apr 24 21:02:27 2015 UTC,"As the article states, one way streets aren't always bad. We need to make sure that people don't turn off their brains and make ""no one-way street"" a mantra.  I've told this story before on /r/urbanplanning.  In my city, they were redesigning a street in a very pedestrian-heavy area (so pedestrian-heavy that sometimes pedestrians spill off the sidewalks into the street). The street was four lanes wide, two in each direction.  Since one block north there's a one-way westbound street, I suggested that the redesign should simply not rebuild the two westbound lanes. This would chop the width of the street in half, making the street two lanes, eastbound only, which could provide the space needed for wider sidewalks and perhaps bike lanes.  The city's response was simply ""one way streets are bad urban design"". And that was that.  So now the rebuilding is almost done and the new street is still four lanes wide and the sidewalks are more narrow than needed. I hear they're putting in a new lighting system that doesn't require lamp posts because they can't spare the sidewalk space."
urbanplanning,33iiiy,CDLTO,1 point,Thu Apr 23 09:58:54 2015 UTC,Sounds like the failure was the failure to not widen the sidewalks.
urbanplanning,33iiiy,entropicamericana,1 point,Thu Apr 23 15:33:58 2015 UTC,"Definitely. But the question is: where could the space come from to widen the sidewalks in a dense, urban location where the full right-of-way is being utilized? The only way it could be done would be to narrow the space available to cars. Since this is a busy location with lots of people being picked up and dropped off, a single lane per direction wasn't really an option.  To their credit, the curb lanes in the new design are narrower (and are designated for pick up/drop off), which offers an extra foot or two of sidewalk space. They did a decent job within the limitations of maintaining four lanes. But overall, the unwillingness to even consider  any option that was one-way due to the mantra of ""one-way bad"" that was so frustrating."

In my van there were only inches either side of me (could this be a factor behind HGV/bus-cyclist collisions?). In some instances, the amount of lanes was not beneficial.  The trouble with London is that it is packed. It has an extensive metro and bus network, but these are running at capacity. Improving cycle infrastructure would alleviate this, but in a city with packed roads, it is politically difficult to reduce road capacity."

In addition, the entry/exit points for motor traffic tunnels require vastly more above-ground room.  That isn't to say I support cycle tunnels, either (other than for passing under busy thoroughfares, rail lines, etc). Tunnels are unpleasant places. Forcing people to cycle through them would affect biking rates.  London needs to walk before it runs (when it comes to cycle infrastructure).

Not sure if it's worth it with the Orange Line, but Metro has been doing a lot of studies/development on streamlining the light rail systems to allow for single trains crossing through multiple lines."

urbanplanning,33hvzg,minidanjer,3,Thu Apr 23 13:38:07 2015 UTC,"From what I remember in school BRT is cheaper and more versatile because you can run the buses on regular roads (which are usually already there) if needed, whereas the trains can only be used on track. I read a fair amount of papers in grad school that suggest people have negative feelings towards buses because they're buses. So, it's entirely possible that a conversion to rail will draw more ridership just because its a train and not a bus."
urbanplanning,33hvzg,ArcadeNineFire,4,Wed Apr 22 21:06:39 2015 UTC,"Right, but ""true"" BRT is supposed to use a dedicated lane to mimic the exclusive right-of-way of (most) light rail. BRT in regular lanes risks running into the same issues as regular buses. Plus, it's a double-edged sword -- lanes granted to BRT can easily be turned back over to all traffic at any time, not so with rail.   So a newly paved lane is almost always desirable, which is not as expensive as rail but still fairly expensive, and asphalt deteriorates more rapidly than metal rails."
urbanplanning,33hvzg,minidanjer,2,Wed Apr 22 22:28:52 2015 UTC,"You're correct, but what I'm stating is that if you absolutely needed to you could drive that same BRT bus on regular roads (provided you can get it outside of the protected ROW onto a regular road). Rail can be used as a travel lane provided it operates as a streetcar, though those types of lines have to battle traffic and are notoriously always off schedule. Asphalt deteriorates due to repeated travel due to varying vehicle weights. If you knew the lane was solely going to be for BRT you could design the pavement as such and it would probably last much longer than one that gets truck travel, car travel, etc. That said, the number of buses using the BRT lane per hour or per day is going to be a lot less than the number of cars that typically drive on a highway so the pavement will last a lot longer than you'd think... especially in CA where there isn't snow (right?).  Personally, I think we need more rail in the US... but I think that's just because I'd rather ride a train than drive in a car or ride a bus."

One week ago  Almost two weeks ago  Los Angeles is huge. Though this BRT is reaching capacity at the current operating constraints, I think it would be better to spend the money building a second line into the valley instead of converting this to Light Rail.   Metro is currently building an 8.5 mile long surface Light Rail down Crenshaw in South LA for about $2 billion. Converting the Orange line over along its 18 miles would cost about 75% of this. So for the about the same price, the Valley could get 6+ additional miles of light rail, who knows how much additional BRT, or convert the existing BRT to light rail.  There is currently no money available for any of these projects however."

urbanplanning,33hvzg,Smash55,3,Wed Apr 22 18:57:38 2015 UTC,"Restrictions imposed by the city through traffic signals and speed restrictions through intersections really limit the number of busses that can run per hour. I believe if longer busses (thinking double-articulated) are run at faster headways (one bus every 1-2 minutes) the ""capacity problem"" will be immediately alleviated. I do not support conversion of the Orange line to rail, given the cost. Especially when you consider that the Purple Line extension - a subway - costs billions of dollars.   Generally, I support BRT as a cost-effective alternative for bringing more, high-quality transit to more parts Los Angeles that desperately need it - at a fraction of the monetary and time cost of rail. There are already several bus routes that meet the criteria for BRT service - particularly the 720 on wilshire (40,000 riders daily, 2-3 minute headways during peak hour) and the 704 on Vermont (don't know ridership numbers off hand- but its busy)."

An upgrade of the Orange Line, be it BRT or LRT will be a sort of a stopgap measure in the meantime. Moreover, the sooner they finalize the technology to be used on the Orange Line upgrade, the sooner they can get started on the extension of the Orange Line to Pasadena."
urbanplanning,33hvzg,ALOIsFasterThanYou,2,Wed Apr 22 22:32:23 2015 UTC,"Good question! I don't know why Metro isn't investigating this - it may just be that the thought really hasn't occurred to them, and some of the local politicians are now obsessed with getting their fair share of LA rail (what a turnabout, right?).  Here's part of the comment I posted over on Metro's blog:  One of the biggest issues facing the line at the moment is rush hour capacity; the buses are getting extremely crowded at peaks. Convoying and larger buses would be one way to resolve that. However, there’s another alternative that seems to have gone unnoticed to date: adding a second east-west transit route to the Valley. The recently announced “Valley U” route helps this, in part, by allowing riders to go straight from Reseda to Van Nuys without making a transfer to the Orange Line. But I say it doesn’t quite go far enough.  Running through the heart of the Valley is another former rail right of way – Sherman Way. That boulevard used to host the Pacific Electric’s Owensmouth line in its center median. The right of way has effectively been preserved (with water wasting grass, I should add.) For roughly the same cost as the high-end Orange Line upgrades, it should be possible to build a center-median BRT (like San Bernardino’s sbX) that splits from the current Orange Line at Valley College, continues along Chandler to Van Nuys, north through the heart of Van Nuys (coincidentally, providing the core of the future East SFV Corridor route) and then west along Sherman Way before rejoining the Orange Line at Canoga.  Why isn’t anyone campaigning for such a line? According to Metro’s own ridership statistics, Line 162/163 posts a daily ridership of over 10,000. With better connections to the Valley’s destinations and transit centers, I don’t see any reason why a Sherman Way BRT couldn’t beat the Orange Line’s existing ridership numbers."
urbanplanning,33hvzg,BurgerBuoy,2,Wed Apr 22 22:34:13 2015 UTC,"I have a question. How exactly does one upgrade from BRT to LRT/Rail.  In my city, they've spent millions constructing overhead and underground corridors dedicated to a BRT line. All the stations have facilities you'd see in a good LRT or metro station (escalators/elevators/electronic ticketing/automated doors etc) but it's BRT. There has been talk of a possible future upgrade to rail in the future but many are skeptical about this.  The infrastructure is there. The BRT corridor (24km) is completely separated from traffic. But is it the same case with LA? Is cost of upgrading to rail really this much? Because we're building a proper metro line in another city worth around 1.2 billion dollars."
urbanplanning,33jbsq,Captain_Unremarkable,7,Wed Apr 22 23:51:40 2015 UTC,"As they are in Japan today. Cars supply 30-50% of trips in Japan, with transit at 20-40% and walking/bicycling another 20-40%, depending on the city. Most Japanese live in single-family detached dwellings, with 75% of Japanese households having a car. Japan, in addition to well-engineered high-capacity surface streets, has one of the best elevated expressway systems in the world. However, free parking is virtually non-existant, and the expressways are tolled at cost. Cars have some amazing advantages (door-to-door, potentially high speed), and some serious disadvantages (low energy efficiency, very low spatial density/throughput, flow choking at high load, low safety, and very high cost of infrastructure). Cars' disadvantages are here to stay, and automated cars aren't going to change most of them, yet so are their advantages. They definitely make sense in many circumstances, but taking into account the whole cost, they certainly don't make sense in all circumstances.   They are a powerful and expensive mode of transportation, and will remain that way for decades to come. However if we want to move forward towards a more balanced and efficient transportation system, the implicit subsidy of cars and suburbs by means of lack of proper tolls on freeways and free parking (and parking minimuns) must stop."

What exactly might you hope to achieve by disrupting car dominated transportation systems and how can you measure that?  Why not go for that quality instead of dealing with vehicles directly?

There is admittedly a bias toward North American planning literature, and a shortage of references for economic development and environmental planning. I hope that /r/urbanplanning subscribers can contribute to a more diverse list."

How comprehensive should this be?  For my part in this, I would like to focus on two areas for improvement:  (1) really capturing 'canon' works among planners and urban studies folk; and (2) correcting a slight North-Americancentrism.  I'm thinking I might create a googledocs spreadsheet tonight."
urbanplanning,33fbdt,lemachin,2,Wed Apr 22 14:07:59 2015 UTC,"I contemplated a section called ""Introductory/Essentials"" - maybe five books at most, for readers who are interested in planning and urbanism but not super familiar with the discipline. Thus far for inclusion in that category I had considered Death & Life, Cities of Tomorrow, and The City Reader.  I agree ""canon"" works is the way to go- or at least the kind of books you might reasonably recommend (as useful, informative, or interesting) to someone who is versed in the field or who wants to learn."
urbanplanning,33fbdt,gboeing,2,Wed Apr 22 15:24:50 2015 UTC,"I think this is the best idea! There's a difference between a canon (a body of texts widely accepted as influential in shaping the field) and a core (or ""introductory/essentials"" -- the 4 or 5 texts that everyone who wants to understand the field should be familiar with). I know when I approach a new field, it's super helpful to have experts point me at the 4-5 book core rather than a 20 book canon!"

I did use the system yesterday, it's fairly expansive and convenient. The most interesting thing about it is that, due to Seattle's mandatory helmet laws, you're forced to rent a helmet from the stand as well."

urbanplanning,33d8mh,Mornic,4,Tue Apr 21 23:14:45 2015 UTC,Its downright stupid. No city or country where biking is a main mode of transportation has a helmet law because it discourages many people from biking and they'd rather go for safety in numbers.
urbanplanning,33d8mh,jr98664,4,Tue Apr 21 23:29:15 2015 UTC,"Turns out that Australia's mandatory helmet laws are also a significant reason behind the lack of success of Australian bike share systems, such as in Brisbane and Melbourne.

urbanplanning,33d8mh,JohnStamosBRAH,1 point,Tue Apr 21 23:39:46 2015 UTC,"Those cities are also properly built out to safely handle bicycling as a main mode of transportation. In most american cities, the bicycle infrastructure is jammed into dangerous roads where cars, trucks, and buses rule the space. Don't blame the helmet laws, blame the infrastructure.   Seattle is doing amazing things for bicycling infrastructure by building out networks of cycle tracks which completely separate bikes and motors. There's also a great deal of bicycle/pedestrian only trails which connect large parts of the region. But in the same breathe, there's still significant problems with the ability to ride safely in its densest and busiest areas like downtown. Combine that with giant hills, terribly bumpy and broken roads, and a constantly wet environment and you'd be out of your mind not to wear a helmet while riding around there."
urbanplanning,33d8mh,Mornic,2,Wed Apr 22 07:19:23 2015 UTC,"Well its the same people that approve helmet laws and infrastructure funding, so they are too blame for addressing symptoms instead of causes.  Seattle is doing better yes, but it is far from amazing and mainly driven by a 'how can we do this as cheap as possible' mentality.   Bike lane many places just randomly ends (e.g. 2nd Ave suddenly ends) Good luck from here on Bike lanes sometimes have both directions in the same side of the road even if the road is not one-way (e.g. Broadway, some University District) Why? Because it was cheaper to convernt a car lane. Nevermind that it is inconvenient to bicyclists and they have to cross multiple lanes, sometimes with opposing traffic, when it ends if they want to continue. Bike lanes on most roads have parking between the sidewalk and the bike path instead of the other way around. This means you are in danger of beeing doored, in danger of someone pulling in front of you to enter or exit parking and not protected from moving cars by parked cars as you would otherwise be. Potholes. Potholes everywhere in a city with 22% slopes. Bikes are often swerving into the road when going downhill even when there is a bike path simply because they have to avoid potholes while going 35 mph.   Seattle is doing something, but the bar is set incredibly low compared to Europe."

It's not like planners are unaware of the benefits of congesting pricing at this point, but political will can be a challenge. A large swath of the American public has thus far not been very receptive to the message."
urbanplanning,33czmz,gboeing,6,Tue Apr 21 16:23:46 2015 UTC,"A large swath of the American public has thus far not been very receptive to the message.   A lot of planners try but bungle the message. They say ""the tolling will respond to demand to ensure free flow"" and stop there and that's a dense way of putting it.   It might be more effective to say ""traffic is gonna cost you something. It'll either cost you time, or money. But the nice thing about charging money is that we can use it to make the road better/provide alternatives for you to avoid paying the toll the next time.""  That said, based on local experience (we've built some new HOT lanes here in the DC area), it still seems like given a choice, a lot of people will still choose paying with their time over paying a dollar amount to get where they're going."
urbanplanning,33czmz,madmoneymcgee,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:33:52 2015 UTC,"In Los Angeles, so many people are choosing the toll that it's maxed out at $1.40/mile or $15.40 for the entire eleven mile route  for much of the 5am til 9am rush ""hour"" and traffic is starting to slow down there as well:  http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-commute-20150324-story.html  Here is another article about the problem in LA and other places as well:  http://www.govtech.com/transportation/How-Cities-Are-Trying-to-Combat-Toll-Traffic.html"
urbanplanning,33czmz,iateone,2,Wed Apr 22 23:39:23 2015 UTC,"It might take the general public a while to connect ailing maintenance and chronic congestion with a lack of a price (value capture in planning terms.) But desperate times call for desperate use of common sense.  I don't think infrastructure without short-loop value capture is sustainable at all. With no decent picture of how much value any one piece of infrastructure generates, you can't upgrade or refit them according to need. One can allocate chunks of tax money according to some usage metrics, but can't really know whether the chunks of tax money are proportional to the value being created. Underspending and overspending ensues.  For long-distance infrastructure, fares and tolls on their users are an ideal form of value capture. For local infrastructure, property taxes and rents."
urbanplanning,33czmz,hylje,2,Tue Apr 21 16:43:07 2015 UTC,"The amount of resistance to the idea that car ownership/operation is subsidized is amazing to me. As a regular cyclist I see so many people complaining about cyclists not paying their ""fair share"" because we don't have to have a license/register our bikes and they think that they are subsidizing bicycles and public transit while not realizing that travel by private automobiles is massively subsidized."
urbanplanning,33czmz,iateone,2,Wed Apr 22 23:43:50 2015 UTC,"On top of just traffic benefits, I think a great benefit of tolls is making drivers pay the cost of driving. Right now a lot of the transportation network is underfunded or isn't at the proper service level it should be and most of this is funded through income, business/corporate taxes and sales taxes. People who don't drive are subsidizing those who do and making it more accessible. This is a great way to help both fund the system and make those who use the service the most pay for it (although it's technically truckers, but that's a different story).  Even if used to help fund construction of a new highway or a widening project and removed after the debt is paid, I think it doesn't always have to be a permanent toll but can help to at least remove a lot of the pressure from the government."

Surveying isn't very related to policy or design but it could be helpful for site analysis. If you can't move elsewhere to find work, sometimes you've got to take what you can get in town until a better position opens up."
urbanplanning,33d73j,ntaylorsiu,2,Tue Apr 21 16:17:57 2015 UTC,I would say that grad school is definitely an option. But I would look to see if I am able to get my foot in the door anywhere with a bachelors.
urbanplanning,33d73j,bhangcat,3,Tue Apr 21 16:41:02 2015 UTC,"Grad school is pretty much a must for planners nowadays although you may be able to break in at a small nonprofit or consulting agency, without an advanced degree the chances are slim. Just a few questions to understand your goals:  -What kind of planning are you interested in? (transportation, economic development, land use, consulting) -Are you willing to relocate? -Have you researched any graduate programs near you or nationwide?  Many different jobs will benefit you as a future planner it just depends on what you want to do in planning."

urbanplanning,33d73j,terranymph,2,Tue Apr 21 20:52:30 2015 UTC,"Surveying will help with a planner job but could also help get into the zoning side as well. If there are openings as an admin assistant in the Development Management division (for us that is planning, zoning, building safety and permits, and engineering and resource protection) that is a good way to get your foot in the door and learn about the policy process.    Also, if you have the time, many divisions are looking for interns over the summer.

Come in with examples of what you have read in their plans.   Assuming you are going into an entry level position, a good question is to ask what you will be specifically working on. If you have already studied what they are doing, you will be able to reply back with an intelligent and relatable reason why you are excited/interested at the prospect of working on that thing.  The real kicker in every interview anywhere for anything though is preparation. Don't study canned responses and generic buzzwords.

Ones that I liked to ask were: Why is this position open? If I did get hired, what would be the general work environment? What responsibilities would I be given in the first few months? if you decide to move forward with me, what is the next step in the process? Do you have a timeline? That last question is pretty important but relax if they don't commit to a firm timeline.   Where do you see yourself in 5 years? Always imply that you see yourself still working there, indefinitely. Don't give the impression they will be having to replace you anytime soon. It took me a little too long to realize this.   What are you hoping to accomplish in your future position?

urbanplanning,3395sp,gboeing,8,Mon Apr 20 17:20:05 2015 UTC,The FRA is a big obstacle. The Northeast Corridor could be a hell of a lot better with some investment on key sections and nicer trains.
urbanplanning,3395sp,BBnet3000,14,Mon Apr 20 23:12:37 2015 UTC,"Even without the FRA, there appears to be a problem with Amtrak and the North East commuter agencies preference for extremely heavy vehicles.  For example, a Bombardier BiLevel, of the type used in Toronto or San Francisco (and thus FRA compliant) weighs a bit more than 50 tons.  By contrast, the Bombardier MultiLevel, developed specially for New Jersey to squeeze under Penn Station, weighs 66 tons for a foot-and-a-half shorter car.  This design has spread significantly among the high-platform agencies.  Long Island's C3 bilevels are even heavier, coming in at a grand total of 71 tons, which is not much lighter than a great big stainless steel Superliner. Even conservative Chicago's stainless steel gallery cars only weigh 58-60 tons,   Now, perhaps there's some sort of engineering weight penalty for high-boarding bilevels, but there seems to be a thing for great-heavy single levels as well. The Comet V single levels come in at 50 tons (same as the Toronto bilevels and much heavier than previous Comets). The Amfleets are 58 tons, and their replacement is unlikely to be any lighter."

urbanplanning,3395sp,japanrobot,16,Tue Apr 21 02:04:14 2015 UTC,"You can pull fewer with a given locomotive.  They require more fuel.

In addition, with the legacy electrical systems to be found on most of the North East Corridor, there aren't limitless amounts of overhead power to move these monsters about with. All of this costs money which Amtrak and the various rail agencies find short supplies of   For comparison,  a similar length of talgo cars in the Pacific Northwest weights in at only 34 tons"
urbanplanning,3395sp,Lol-I-Wear-Hats,1 point,Tue Apr 21 03:16:04 2015 UTC,Interesting. Thanks for the information. So is the preference for them due to safety? Any other reasons?
urbanplanning,3395sp,japanrobot,3,Tue Apr 21 03:41:02 2015 UTC,"From what I can gather it's for several reasons. Above and beyond the FRA, there is a perception of the safety of heavier vehicles.  Furthermore, stainless steel does have certain durability benefits, as testified by the number of 1950s Budd products still riding the rails, such most of Amtrak's baggage cars or VIA Rail's considerable vintage fleet. It would seem that many agencies are making a bet on their own inability to consistently maintain their rolling stock over the long term.   And just plain old institutional inertia"
urbanplanning,3395sp,Lol-I-Wear-Hats,3,Tue Apr 21 04:18:26 2015 UTC,"To give a little more context to /u/Lol-I-Wear-Hats, you have to remember that North America has the most extensive and integrated freight system in the world. Any common carriers that utilize track that could at any time, even if it's an extremely rare occurrence be used by freight, must then meet certain bulk strength requirement. Segments of the NEC are still used for freight moves in CT, MA, and RI - even if it's far off-peak and only for a short time, but because they are used at all Amtrak is bound to guarantee that their rolling stock meets the required bulk strength requirements. This is true for Amtrak inter-cities and true for any common carrier route in the US that shares active freight track - though waivers are allowed, that's not a regular occurrence.   Why is it this way? Well remember that for a long time safety was imagined in terms of strength - the bigger you are, the safer you are - but as you say there are today a bunch of impressive communications-based systems and safety systems that can more or less keep freights and passengers entirely separate - the FRA is slowly rewriting some guidelines to account for this, but it's a long and hard slog."

I don't understand how agencies, especially places like Long Island which is similar to the Peninsula in many ways, didn't jump at the opportunity to phase over to rolling stock that would be cheaper, cheaper to operate, cheaper to maintain, and would provide superior service."
urbanplanning,3395sp,Lol-I-Wear-Hats,7,Tue Apr 21 15:00:49 2015 UTC,"This article doesn't really get to the root of the problem: it's exactly backwards for the rails to be privately owned and the passenger service to be publicly operated. Rail is a natural monopoly, meaning that it's super inefficient for two different companies to build tracks on the same route. That's where government ownership and investment would make sense. But, as much as I love Amtrak, it would make much more sense for private companies to compete to run service on those tracks."
urbanplanning,3395sp,ohtheheavywater,1 point,Tue Apr 21 11:36:53 2015 UTC,"The 'serious' passenger rail systems in the United States are already publically owned, and these combined make up a vastly greater share of passenger transportation than the rest. I'm referring to the North East Corridor, owned by Amtrak, Metro-North, and the MBTA. The MBTA, NJT, Metro-North, Long Island, South-Shore, Caltrain, Coaster, Metra, and Metrolink North Carolina already own the lion's share of their trackage, if not all of them."
urbanplanning,3395sp,Lol-I-Wear-Hats,3,Tue Apr 21 17:33:45 2015 UTC,"The article makes a great point, in that Amtrak service is generally so poor that it makes it difficult to gauge the actual demand for intercity rail.   Greyhound is 10X better IMO than Amtrak for most trips, except for comfort. If I take a long Greyhound trip I barely sleep and seem to catch a cold 1/2 the time."
urbanplanning,3395sp,minidanjer,2,Tue Apr 21 14:55:22 2015 UTC,"The only reason why bus travel is ""better"" is because it's cheaper and more accessible to run rubber tires on asphalt than it is to run steel wheels on rail. The problem with that is that buses add to the existing traffic congestion unless they have designated ROW. This is one of the reasons why everyone gets so pissed when the Red Line shuts down and require shuttle buses to get onto the already jammed peak hour Boston roadway system. At that point, you might as well have just drove in the first place.  In regards to long trips, I prefer train solely because I can get up and move around during the trip rather than sit in a seat and be miserable. Most trains also have bathrooms secluded enough at the end of the train such that you can drop a deuce without breaking ""Rule #1 of the bus: no #2."" And most long distance trains have dining cars where you can buy beer, among other things. The only problem for me is that the NEC is occasionally more expensive than a plane ticket... which is unfortunate because I'd take the train all the time if it was more affordable than driving."

urbanplanning,3395sp,sir_mrej,18,Mon Apr 20 21:31:55 2015 UTC,"To be honest, the US doesn't even really need high speed rail right now. We need intercity rail connection within every megaopolis rather than focusing on high speed rail connecting every major city. If smaller communities don't have rail connection, then there's no stable foundation for a network to grow up on. It's like building  highways before the farm-to-market roads are mapped out."

urbanplanning,3395sp,252003,7,Mon Apr 20 23:29:15 2015 UTC,"Agreed. While I would add the Four Cities of Texas, I still think that a basic rail network would be necessary to transition people away from vehicle dependency and slowly nudge them towards rail commuting. Given how California and the NEC already have excellent passenger rail networks (for the US), there's no doubt HSR would be necessary and excellent there. But in Texas, with the Texas Central Railway, there's a 50/50 chance the company doesn't blossom like it would if there already was railway popularity."
urbanplanning,3395sp,minidanjer,4,Mon Apr 20 23:46:56 2015 UTC,"Never underestimate the massive effect high speed rail has on the development of cities. People don't measure distance in km the measure distance in time. Two places that take an hour to get to feel as far away regardless of the distance on the map. High speed rail ties urban cores together and makes travel between them easy. This is very important for companies. Now a customer that is 500 km away can be visited for a morning meeting, you can take in consultants that live hundreds of kilomters away. Customers will travel far to reach your buisness. A university can take in guest lecturures. Thanks to mobile internet travel time isn't really an issue, you spend two hours writing emails and then you arrive.   This assumes that you are in walking distance of the train station. If you have to take a taxi way out to the suburbs you don't get the benifits. So what do companies do? They try to pile up onto the trainstation creating an incredibly dense urban space. The same goes for employees. I live in one city 3 days a week and in another 4 days a week. It would be a lot less bareable if I couldn't walk to the station."
urbanplanning,3395sp,RaiderRaiderBravo,3,Tue Apr 21 09:40:11 2015 UTC,This is called Transit Oriented Development and it's starting to get absolutely huge in areas nearby train stations/bus depots/ports etc. Right now we're seeing developments pop up around commuter rail stations which are more part of the suburb to urban core network rather than the city to city network.

No good excuses tho :)  Current ROW can't support actual bullet train speeds in much of the Northeast. So yea new ROWs would be needed.

One example would be (in the case of Texas) Dallas to Fort Worth. It's technically intercity, though it does stop at several stations along the way. It's just not necessarily an express service."

At least here in ATL, if they built a high-speed rail from Macon-ATL-Athens like we've heard about every year for decades, I think it would be a disaster.  Atlanta already has an urban flight problem, and the rail would just encourage several of the commuter cities to grow and settle outwards.  If Atlanta built a functioning rail network within the city, extending out to some of the major suburbs, it might see some real urban revival as the route would allow the population to move inwards."

The reasons that US rail passenger service is so slow is that tracks are shared with private companies(who own the rail) using very old, curvy routes through urban areas and b) at this point it'll costs 10s or 100s of billions of $ to obtain right of ways that allow truly high speed.   Proponents are just able to get the subsidies needed to keep the current system operating. The political will just isn't there to allow high speed rail. I'd also guess that the airline lobby doesn't like the idea either."

There is nothing in the article to suggest that bad public transport is good for local business, only that start-ups are have a larger survival rate in these areas.  The results are interesting but it would be interesting with some more info on what is causing start-ups to prosper more in some areas. The obvious explanation seems to be that in large city with a well-developed public transport network there is already established competition in station areas, since these are highly attractive locations. This makes it both difficult and costly to enter the market and probably caters more to an established business wishing to relocate for better access or set up a new unit."

They don't need foot traffic to survive, so they shouldn't be paying a premium to be in the city center.   The real conclusion we should be drawing is probably that high real estate prices don't work for tech startups.   The fact that real estate price and access to public transportation are correlated doesn't mean that access to good transit is bad for business."

Public transportation is not bad for business just because it is more difficult to start new businesses. Maybe it is difficult because the established businesses are already doing so well that you can't compete as a startup. That doesn't mean business is bad in these areas since the established businesses are likely generating a ton of revenue then. It just means its difficult to enter the market.

The PATH train, though hated by the locals, also helped a lot in the redevelopment of the county. Every station on the line is being redevelopped with apartments, retail, and offices. Even the previously obscure city of Harrison is in a huge development boom thanks to the PATH. And even Newark, a city once known for its high crime, is on its way to become the next developed city in the state. Sure, you could say being across the Hudson from New York helped Jersey City's building boom, but it doesn't explain the development boom of a city across a giant mountain range.

The people that moved into San Francisco and made it what it is probably don't want to live somewhere like Brickell. I think that's why they fight development.

urbanplanning,338uj3,combuchan,0,Mon Apr 20 22:55:32 2015 UTC,"This is a painful oversimplification of the situation.    8 Washington wasn't proposed in downtown SF, it was on the waterfront, where height limits have long been established.  While ballot box zoning is problematic, it's not causing gentrification--it's basically a wealthy couple who would have had their views blocked who fought the thing off, and SF is not alone in having referendums to overturn or change local politics.    This article makes the incorrect assumption that rich people like to live in high rises, so if high rises are built, the gentrification problem will be solved.  That's not true at all. SF is also building a massive highrise neighborhood near the Transbay Tower.  Thousands of units are under construction there.  Whether anyone actually lives there is anyone's guess--it's the Mission that has the trendy bars and restaurants, not the Financial District or SoMa or Transbay District that more or less have tumbleweeds blowing through them on weekends.  There are people in the Mission that are paying over $3,000 a month to live in a neighborhood known for endemic violence and human shit on the sidewalks because it's ""cool"" to live there.  The idea that Miami and SF have similar amounts of capital flowing through them is patently absurd.  A simple Google Images Search of a venture capital map shows the Bay Area circulating 200x as much money as Miami.  Miami, I'm guessing, also lacks the plethora of wealthy foreign nationals (most of them from China) that are driving up prices--basically according to realtors if there's not a wealthy tech buyer first in line to buy a place, it's a Chinese national looking for an overseas investment and vice versa.    The sales price for an average new condo in SF, around $1050 sq/ft, is three times as much as an example new Brickell tower."

Miami (the city) is roughly 65% foreign born. Over the past fifty years, the city has absorbed different waves of immigration from Central and South America. Since 2000, Brazilians and Venezuelans have been the biggest new population groups moving in.  Appropriately, 62% of new Real Estate purchases in Miami are from Latin American buyers. Instead of wealthy Chinese, Miami has wealthy Latin Americans.  Additionally, it's difficult to judge the ""heat"" of a real estate market if you're going by price alone, simply because of the supply restrictions. (That's a major point of the article, and of much of what Stephen J Smith writes). From 2000-2010, the housing stock of SF grew by 8% while it grew 24% in Miami, and from 2010-2013 alone, Miami grew 2% while SF grew 0.33%. Miami added more units than San Francisco did despite being a city half the size."
urbanplanning,338uj3,combuchan,2,Mon Apr 20 21:46:21 2015 UTC,"OK, so you may have the foreign nationals, but you don't have the wave of tech money.  Miami also doesn't have rent control and it's median income is about half of SF's.  This is why SF is gentrifying and Miami's not.    Secondly, it's much easier to add housing when it's cheap to demolish existing housing and replace it.  To that end, Miami's median homes sales prices are a fraction of San Francisco's according to Truila.  Crummy land in Mid-Market in SF goes for $30 million an acre--at least twice what it goes for in the premium Brickell area, and San Francisco just doesn't have the slew of redevelopable land that Miami does.

If you're looking at comparable areas, the ""Tall Buildings"" area of Miami (SW15th Rd - N 29th St, b/w 95 & the water until N 15th, then b/w Biscayne & the water) is roughly equivalent to a ""downtownish"" area of SF (Washington-Kearny-Geary-Van Ness-11th-I80-Embarcadero)  While SF certainly has building code restrictions, so does Miami (and all of Florida), which gets hurricanes on a fairly regular basis, and is threatened by flooding much more than SF.  But the key difference is in zoning. Those parcels near Brickell are zoned T-24-O, which means a 24 story height limit and an FLR of 7, by right. Meanwhile, a lot of those SF parcels are much more restricted in their use. 349 8th street in SoMa, for example, has a height limit of 40 feet (1/6th that of any of the brickell parcels!), that may be expanded to 55 if you throw your arms before the public."

The site in question is tiny, it's in a crappy area of town (I've walked down 8th St enough times from Market to know this), it's too small to provide parking and it's a sketchy walk to the metro lines to the sketchiest station on the metro lines.  I wouldn't live in that area of town and I'm a 32 year old male who can take care of myself in a city.  Most of the bars are leather daddy gay bars (note how close Folsom St and Dore Alley are).  It's not a place for families or young couples or retirees.    It's in the highest rating of liquefaction zones, and you have no idea whether you'd get air rights from neighbors to raise a tower crane.

You're not going to find your prince charming development site in a real city, everything's going to be too far, too sketchy, not the idyllic site for your beautiful vertical village. Many cities around the world seem to deal with these problems fine, but when you're looking for model candidates for redevelopment, you're not going to have a sustainable amount of it.   The site in question is tiny   Like in the townhouse areas of Miami, it is always possible to buy out multiple lots   it's in a crappy area of town   Western Overtown (Miami) is getting rebranded as ""adjacent to the medical complex"" as 6-story buildings are going up next to a    sketchiest station on the metro   kind of place. Say nothing about the complexes in unincorporated Miami-Dade that are 100% affordable, all in impoverished areas of the county.   highest rating of liquefaction zones   Many countries on the pacific rim have tall buildings, including Tokyo and Santiago de Chile.   no idea whether you'd get air rights from neighbors to raise a tower crane.   A valid concern, although if you can consolidate, it's much more workable. I don't want to move the goalposts, though, so this point still stands.  I've wasted far too much time (my fault) looking at the SF zoning code tonight, so I'm not going to respond with substantial, research posts after this, but don't take this personally. I understand that your concerns mirror that of the citizens of one of the most important (and beautiful!) cities in America. But the problem just comes down to how much SF (and cities in all of California) are committed to affordable housing.   It's very difficult to make rich people not do what they want, whether it's a pimped out rowhouse in the Mission, or a penthouse suite in Miami Beach, so a lot of times when you try to restrict development to a certain form factor, it just leads to really expensive and odd-looking buildings (see the East Village)."

But today, it sucks.    Many structures are built in seismic zones, but few structures are built on dirt and the remains of wooden ships--that area of SF is solidly landfill, and it's extremely expensive to mitigate that (world's largest foundation is for the Wilshire Grand in LA which is by no means the world's tallest building, and LA wasn't built on landfill).  The next big one will lay waste to the area.    And, lo and behold, a 5 story project is in the planning phase even tho the site will be upzoned soon.

urbanplanning,338ctb,old_gold_mountain,11,Mon Apr 20 14:53:53 2015 UTC,"It's true that the density is similar in size and scope to SF. But that only gets you so far to ditch car reliance.  If you only ever lived your whole life in that ""core"" of Los Angeles, living car-free would be quite easy. But culturally, ""LA"" is spread all over the LA basin and surrounding area.  Say you lived in Lincoln Heights and worked in DTLA - you could take the Gold Line to work and back no problem. But what if your friend is having a birthday party in upper Silverlake? What if you meet an SO and he/she lives in Hancock Park?  Because of topography and bodies of water, the central Bay Area is streched along linear strips of developed land, defined by boundaries of hills and waterfronts. For this reason, you can have a girlfriend in Berkeley, a job in San Francisco, and an apartment in Oakland, and everything will be easy walking/biking distance from BART. Los Angeles is not a series of linear development - it's a matrix spread in all directions. For this reason, it will be a long time before transit truly competes with the car.  I made a mapfrappe to demonstrate this difference, defining the densest areas of the SF Bay Area. When everything is in a line, you just run transit up and down the line. When it's spread across an entire plane, it take a lot more ""lines"" of transit to effectively cover everything.  The Santa Clara Valley (San Jose, Santa Clara, lower peninsula) suffers from the same problem LA does and that's why the rate of public transit usage there is so much lower than the neighbors to the North."

urbanplanning,338ctb,alexfrancisburchard,2,Tue Apr 21 01:11:21 2015 UTC,"Don't know why the author of the article used that picture, but the comparison has a strong statistical basis:  Using US Census data, I decided to essentially draw a city the size of San Francisco around the densest portions of central LA, encompassing downtown and neighborhoods to its west (47 square miles in total, just like SF).  The surprising result? San Francisco and the “city” of central LA (a subset of the larger municipality) are equal in population density over those 47 square miles, with about 837,000 people in both cities (all of SF and the core of LA). Not only that, but the LA core has about 85% as many jobs as San Francisco does, making it a substantial center of employment (though a smaller share of the whole region than SF is, since the Bay Area is much smaller than the greater LA region). That’s a stunning finding for any follower of urban planning, since San Francisco is widely known as one of the densest places in the United States, and the second densest city in the country (after New York).  The difference is that San Francisco is a single coherent city, whereas the author's ""Central LA"" is not its own legal jurisdiction."

He has a great track record of working with really talented people and giving them what they need to create amazing things, but he also has occasionally seriously mucked up projects to force them to fit his initial vision. Another interesting factor for me personally is his history with small scale and temporary construction by way of his set designers, at the moment while I am developing a career in architecture and urban planning myself most of my paid work is freelancing in the area of stage and set design so I would be interested if any of his connections in that area are involved in the design."
